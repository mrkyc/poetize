See all the angels falling
See all the angels falling
The streets are dark
Black streetcar
Walking way too far
To find your way back home
The curtains brown
The windows down
To close the sound
That keeps haunting your soul
Don't you know
You better watch your step
Baby, it's a long drop down
Too many voices calling
You better watch your step
Baby, it'll take you down
To no tomorrow
See all the angels falling
The night is long
And peace is gone
And the right and wrong
Are lost inside the gray
The bridge is high
And life's a lie
You've tried to fly
But never left the ground
Don't look down

Baby, it's a long drop down
Too many voices calling
You better watch your step
Baby, it'll take you down
To no tomorrow
See all the angels falling
See all the angels falling
Oh...
Don't take any more of your time
Believing a lie
Abandon the dark
Oh, won't you come fly
To heaven's saving grace
You better watch your step, baby
Too many voices calling
Oh, you better watch your step
Baby, it'll take you down
To no tomorrow
See all the angels falling
See all the angels falling, yeah
Ooh-ooh-ooh...
Don't you know
You better watch your step
