Just say what you need to say
'Cause you're not alone
But you've got to move on
Got to let go
When the passion surrenders
When the dream you've shared
Is no longer there
And though it hurts so much
Tell me, how in the world
Can you blame it on love
And don't say it's love
That broke your heart
When you trusted someone
'Cause love's the victim
Not the crime
And love will be there
To break your fall
If you'll trust in love, just in love
Know that love
Could never break your heart
But love can break your fall
And I know it's hard to trust again
But I'll stay with you, stay with me now
Hey, let go of your heartache
Learn to forgive
Won't you wait just a moment
And give your heart a chance
To begin again
And though you've run before, oh...
Tell me, where will you go
If you walk out the door
You might also likeAnd don't say it's love
That broke your heart
When you trusted someone
'Cause love's the victim
Not the crime
And love will be there
To break your fall
If you'll trust in love, just in love
Know that love
Could never break your heart
But love can break your fall
I could never have found my own way
Oh, no, 'cause it was God's love
That saved this heart of mine from dying
And when you find His love
Is all that you have
Oh, then you see love is all that you need
And don't say it's love
That broke your heart
When it's over and done
Believe in love forever
'Cause love will be there
To break your fall
If you'll trust in love, just in love
Know that love
Would never break your heart
