Standing alone
Afraid that the answers we question
Will turn us to stone
Estranged to a world we once knew
Who's wrong, who is right
Oh, Lord, shine the hope, shine the way
To go beyond the pain tonight
This world may never be
A place where all pain is severed
But there will be a day
When we can live together, yeah
We can live together, yeah
I see there's a land of plenty
And a land of despairs
Enslaved by the hand of the master
That leads to nowhere
One man in a robe of perfection
Gave grace of His own
So look into your own reflection
Before you cast a stone, oh...
Think twice before you cast the stone
This world may never be
A place where all pain is severed
But there will be a day
When we can live together, yeah
We can live together

When peace will shine down
On our sorrow
Hope in the heaven that waits
Tomorrow, yeah, yeah
Ooh...
Oh, Lord, please bring a day
When we can live together
This world may never be
(Oh, yeah)
A place where all pain is severed
But there will be a day
When we can live together, yeah
You know that love's gonna live forever
(We can live together)
This world may never be
A place where all pain is severed
(Ooh-ooh-ooh...)
Oh, Lord, please bring a day
When we can live with You forever, yeah
(We can live together)
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(We can live together)
This world may never be
A place where all pain is severed
There's gonna be a place
Where we will live forever, oh, yeah
(We can live together)
(We can live together)
Love's gonna live forever
