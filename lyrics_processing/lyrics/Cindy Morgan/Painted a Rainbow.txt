And the sun is shining
Likes it's never going down again
I start to feel like I can fly away, yes
Oh, sweet juniper under the clear silver
Leading me into a place that I've never been
I stand and sigh under the sky
And my heart is like a child, I'm alive again
All the dancing
In the searching
In a daze, never knowing
I was on the edge of this horizon
But Your love showed me the way
Now there's a Rainbow for me
But the promise
That we will live in each day
Gets shaken in the gray
But now I believe
Oh, and life is like the sweetest refrain
Since You painted a rainbow for me
Lord, You painted a rainbow
I think about days that I spent crying
All the games I played
He loves me then He loves me not
So all alone wondering
If I'd ever fill the emptiness
In my broken heart
You might also likeBut now I'm dancing
No more searching
Now I'm free
Walking in an endless horizon
And You're the reason I sing, ooh...
Now there's a Rainbow for me
But the promise
That we will live in each day
Gets shaken in the gray
But now I believe
Oh, and life is like the sweetest refrain
Since You painted a rainbow for me
Lord, You painted a rainbow
Won't you go with me
To where the angels come to sing
Yeah, yeah
His water washes away our sins
Gives hope to life
And gives life again and again
Hey, since You painted a rainbow for me
Since You painted a rainbow
Now there's a Rainbow for me
But the promise
That we will live in each day
Gets shaken in the gray
But now I believe
Oh, and life is like the sweetest refrain
Since You painted a rainbow for me
Since You painted a rainbow for me
Oh, yes, You did
Now I am free
