What a picture-perfect place in time
I recall it so well, oh, in my mind
Oh, yeah, went for a walk in the snow
And got lost in our innocence
He wore his best intentions
And I wore my Sunday dress
How grand it would be to go back
Oh, too bad, life doesn't work
Oh, no, life doesn't work like that, oh-oh...
'Cause you can turn back
To all the memories
But you can't turn back the clock
You can make life all it can be
But you can't make it something it's not
Oh, 'cause yesterday is yesterday
And tomorrow is still a day away
So, what do you say
There's a reason to live today
I see him there
Under a starlit sky
And if moonlight was magic
He'd wander back in time, oh, yeah
To a night just like this
When the whole world was changed
With just one kiss
There was always a sweet light
In her eyes
But now he's sure she's an angel
In heaven tonight
You might also likeHe said, what I would give
Just to see her face
Oh, but life doesn't work
Oh, no, life doesn't work that way
Oh, no
'Cause you can turn back
To all the memories
But you can't turn back the clock
You can make life all it can be
But you can't make it something it's not
Oh, 'cause yesterday is yesterday
And tomorrow is still a day away
So, what do you say
There's a reason to live today
Oh, Savior in heaven
You are the music
That moves us to dance
The love, that leaves nothing
Nothing to chance
Oh, nothing to chance
Don't you know
That yesterday is yesterday
And tomorrow is still a day away
So, what do you say
There's a reason to live
A reason to live
Oh, reason to live
Don't you wanna, don't you wanna
Reason to live today
Ooh, yeah, yeah, today, whoa...
(A reason to live)
(Can't turn back to yesterday)
Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah
(A reason to live)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh...
(Can't turn back to yesterday)
Ooh...
(A reason to live)
(Can't turn back to yesterday)
(A reason to live)
