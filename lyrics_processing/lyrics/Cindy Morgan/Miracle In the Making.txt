The same regrets everyday of the year
He said "I know I can't go back
But I can't move forward"
There's too much pain
That's holding me here
And I can tell by the look in your eyes
You don't think you're worth the time
I guess the bad stuff is easier to hear
After a while
All this time you're taken
But love will bring your heart back around
Haven't been forsaken
Caught before your feet hit the ground
Yeah, don't be deceived
Don't let your faith be shaken
'Cause it's plain to me
Yeah, it's plain to see
That you're a miracle in the making
Yeah, yeah
On the edge of a dream
A stone's throw from sorrow
Come from flames to ashes
And ashes to tears
But when the dam finally breaks
And the mirror crashes
There is peace after all these years

You don't see the way from here
But you know Jesus is love and He's faith
And He's hope, and He's here
All this time you're taken
But love will bring your heart back around
Haven't been forsaken
Caught before your feet hit the ground
Oh, don't be deceived
Don't let your faith be shaken
'Cause it's plain to me
Yeah, it's plain to see
That you're a miracle in the making
(Oh, in the making)
Cast all your cares
All your doubts on His shoulders
He'll hold you close
Till the midnight is over
Yeah, yeah
All this time you're taken
But love will bring your heart back around
Haven't been forsaken
Caught before your feet hit the ground
Oh, don't be deceived
Don't let your faith be shaken
'Cause it's plain to me
Yeah, it's plain to see
That you're a miracle in the making
Love will bring your heart back around
Haven't been forsaken, no
Ooh, don't be deceived
Don't let your faith be shaken, shaken
'Cause it's plain to me
Yeah, it's plain to see
