But the melody faded
And I took it for granted
But I can't take it no more
I guess nobody's perfect
We're always last to admit
That we should blame ourselves
So love is lost
Don't we know our hearts anymore
Now tell me
If this life's a game of give and take
Why are we taking so much
We've been taking so much
We gotta learn how to give
It's time to let it begin
Let it be love, let it be true
'Cause love will be all that we remember
Open up our arms to each other
Oh, let it be love
Don't you know
The heart and soul are what matters
Let it be love
'Cause love will be all that lasts forever
Open up our hearts to each other
And let it be love
You might also likeI stand with a stranger
Wondering what I'm afraid of
And I feel like a prisoner
Holding the key to the door
Why run from each other
We've led ourselves to believe
That no one really cares
So on we go
I wonder what we're leaving behind
Now tell me
What's a broken world supposed to do
We've been hurting so much
We've been hurting so much
We've got to find love in Him
So won't you let it begin
Let it be love, let it be true
'Cause love will be all that we remember
Open up our arms to each other
And let it be love
(Oh, let it be love)
Don't you know
The heart and soul are what matters
So let it be love
(Let it be)
'Cause love will be all that lasts forever
Open up our hearts to each other
And let it be love
Believe in love again
Let it be love, let it be true
'Cause love will be all that we remember
Open up our arms to each other
And let it be love
(Yeah, yeah)
Let it be me and let it be you
'Cause love will be all that lasts forever
Open up our hearts to each other
And let it be love
Let it be love, let it be true
'Cause love will be all that we remember
Open up our arms to each other
And let it be love
Let it be me and let it be you
'Cause love will be all that lasts forever
Open up our hearts to each other
