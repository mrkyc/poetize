Tell me, what you thought you would find
Well, you seem to know what life's about
Tell me, are you changing your mind
Somehow you've forgotten tomorrow
Living for today
I want you to be there
So don't let this chance slip away
There's a moment in time
And I'm waiting
There's still time if you wanna go
Ooh, just imagine
And you won't have to be afraid
You won't have to be alone again
But you've got to believe
There's a moment in time
And I'm praying
There's still time 'cause you never know
Ooh, just imagine
And you don't have to be afraid
You don't have to be alone anymore
I'll be the first to say that I'm on your side
Tell me, 'cause I've been there myself
You play the masquerade with precious time
Tell me, are you fooling yourself
You might also likeOh, the moment of truth is upon you
And you got to decide
And I want you beside me
So don't let this chance pass you by
There's a moment in time
And I'm waiting
There's still time if you wanna go
Ooh, just imagine
And you won't have to be afraid
You won't have to be alone again
But you've got to believe
There's a moment in time
And I'm praying
There's still time 'cause you never know
Ooh, just imagine
And you don't have to be afraid
You don't have to be alone anymore
You've got to believe, and I know
In a moment
We'll be changed in a moment
To say forever
We're gonna trade this ol' world
For eternity, yeah
There's a moment in time
There's still time
Ooh, just imagine
And you won't have to be afraid
You won't have to be alone again
But you've got to believe
There's a moment in time
And I'm praying
There's still time, just imagine
And you don't have to be afraid
You don't have to be alone anymore
(You don't have be alone)
There's a moment in time
And I'm waiting
There's still time if you wanna go
If you wanna go, just imagine
And you won't have to be afraid
You won't have to be alone again
