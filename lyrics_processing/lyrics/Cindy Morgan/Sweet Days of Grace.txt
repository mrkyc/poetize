And then the hard times
Begin to wash away

And then the hard times
Begin to wash away
And sun shines and brings a new light
Where we can recline

That You're never far away from Your steps
The place we long to be

(No way to right the wrong)
Don't have to know all the words

(Won't you let the rain fall down)
(Won't you let the rain fall down)
Fall down
In the sweet, sweet days of grace
Rain falls and then the night calls
And the hard times
Oh, begin to wash away
And sun shines and brings a new light
Where we can recline
In the sweet, sweet days of grace
Rain falls and then the night calls
And then the hard times
Begin to wash away
And sun shines and brings a new light
Where we can recline
