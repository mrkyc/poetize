Bring back the days of innocence
Young and tender
How did those days just pass us by
Mm, times to remember
All but forgotten in our lives
Don't you find when you turn around
That we've lost much more
Than we ever found
So, hold me tight
Oh, Lord, turn the night
Take me back
Oh, how I miss the innocence
To what was right
Help me find the time we once had
Bring back the days of innocence
A time to treasure
A time when the truth
Meant more than words, oh, yeah
Love was forever
A tide that was never meant to turn
So much lost
But there's more to be gained
I wonder what waits
There beyond the rain
You might also likeSo, hold me tight
Oh, Lord, turn the night
Take me back
Oh, how I miss the innocence
To what was right
Help me find the time we once had
Bring back the days of innocence
I wanna tell you time rushes by
There's time to stop and live
Don't live a lie, oh...
Oh, if we just reach up to Him
And all that might have been
'Cause you know that it's good
And you know that it's right
You know He's waiting tonight
Ooh...
And if we reach up to Him
And all that might have been
'Cause you know that it's good
And you know that it's right
You know that He's waiting tonight
So, hold me tight
Oh, Lord, turn the night
Take me back
Oh, how I miss the innocence
To what was right
Help me find the time we once had
Bring back the days of innocence
So, hold me tight
Oh, Lord, turn the night
Take me back
(Hold me tight and turn the night)
Oh, how I miss the innocence
(Turn the night, yeah)
To what was right
Help me find the time we once had
Bring back the days of innocence
Oh, how I miss the innocence
