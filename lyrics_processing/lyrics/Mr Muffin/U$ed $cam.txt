You are the new name
New face on the block
You got some loose lips
Talk shit need a lock
Me and my crew think
You a hoe need a buck
Imma call u bruised lips
On a beat boy u suck
Oh my Lord
Fella want a black boy beef
I knock teeth out with a bar
Don't yeet
I'm all street
Your sugar on my d how sweet
Your rap real cheap money hoes cars C
So I snatch your microphone
Punch you till your eyes gone
You got a swelled ego
It'll show on your face soon
To shine is just a phase moon
The spot will be my place soon
Connect the dots
Whilst you fellas Google

See I'm coming with a plier
Fuck your screw games
You knew fame
You a liar I tire
Boy don't tell me
You are viral
Flush your shit
See it go down

New age
Old cage
Prisoned minds set fake aims and fave race
Born to a pack so we act to old plays
Script wrote renamed as gold rules
So how do u know me
Dirt is the cleanse that most artists use
Creativity murdered by marketing tools
See talent exists
Flex always steals the scene
,And made talent exit
That's how I depict being picked
I have set the scene
I have always sinned on a beat
Beast on anything
They calling me a freak
And you
You have faked a scene
You have faked a dream
Slogan
Money everything
Rhrash I'm marketing
Bring a polythene
Bout to drop some shit
Public packaging
Fancy videos
Plastic booty hoes
Zero craft in studio
Blinding vision folks
Kissing ass
Showing mistletoes
Killing talent y'all the
Criminal!
Bla bla bla bla
Used scam
