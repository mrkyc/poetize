Nobody chose me
But mehn the options
Life got options
Evil n good
Even in food
We choose parts we do chew
Mehn I grew from a city

Shocked  it ain't true
And the heroes of my time
Was the bad crew

Death style by  sentence

They share lessons
We hold blessings
They hold curses
See the mind group
We lie with pretence) 2x

Speech:
See the world as it is now there is no truth in the eyes of the living
Dead tales come to life and living souls turn to ash
As confusing as my mind may be I still focus for the goal of One nation
Whether black or white race doesnt matter Its just life
My bridges My wishes My vision
A better world to live in
Cos the the morning mourning
Those tears they keep on falling and when the morning boring
They rush to the streets n storming
Money is evil and sometimes is good
