Caged In The Album

Mehn  u niqqas are just louder dan bells
U bust a few ryhmes  wid dat u just sell in good time
Is it tru u tlk abt ur money n ass grinds in the club while u never get none
Wat a fool
Your silly flow on dope beats while the public just nod to  the beat
U figa say you on heat
Nigga i kill anything i come across while haters
Shout apuu now fans  where ma round of appause
I come with a force
Shark flow i be gruesome than jaws
Punch to the spine
But they so spineless
Maggots who feed of ma line
Im nad dead in da game
Im a walking zombie with a living brain
Cos ur chick gve more iq
Thnx boo
More head than humpty dumpty
Ha ha!
I kick to the beat i dun need more shoes
Edey pain u kinda like a broken tooth
Now im bak in the kicthcen beef i wanna cook

Barset i murder those who go call me weak
Im on deck captain with a nicki ace of spades

Yall niggas go low limbo

Choke them with ma line homicidal strangle
I got smthin to prove move son
I got a vim so hot i call it solar flare
Yeah You would dare not to shit in ur underwear
You can't tke ma flow is laxative
Your ass wud blow
Automative flow i am mechanical
I transform to destroy decepticon
I see animated haters run chicken run
Democratic flow i speak ma mind son
Cnt get a grip of reality use botox
Or listen to lines cos it ain't bogus
True talk from an emcee with rap force
Called gameshaw who murder any  rapper with pen n paper
Where da undertaker dead men on ma table
Yall drop weak bars yall are too feeble
Caged In the album simple
Nxt track is so deep  yeah dimple
