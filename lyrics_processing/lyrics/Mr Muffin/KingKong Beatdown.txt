Is me i got a message scrap those words
Refix em well is me i hve confessions
Guilty lines guilty ryhmes
See them form a sentence I no be real "kai"
Let me ask this question
Can i say im living if my shadow barely shows
My feet take me to heaven but this seat won't let me go
Bread crumbs on the table
Bread knife sharp to slit wrists
Darkness overpowered the light "dumsor na" my belief
Good n evil on n off daily balanced meal
Broken laws broken dreams
Unsealed chaos blood out of seals womb
Big tombs was raided its secrets moved
Thats how lies rob us of the truth reality was moved
Cold yo doe am bak in the studio
These haters think shootin can a kill a bro
Six bullets in ma chest antichrist feeling ma power flow
How powerful can a feline compel this oga   now i give a standing blow
Punchlines naah I'm pouring metaphors to sink the lyric boat
Im the wolf that kills an eagle when im high bush flavour take me home
Soaring in the sky pple screaming UFO
I made yh its ma time to blow
Because I was under the food chain like "gari" was broke
But gari sells pass maggi "Charley" no joke
Who ever thought a guy like me would really step up n flow
So much that hell would call me hot
A blessing thats what im called by da pope
Woah so many haters my dreams were held on life support
They tried to pull plugs
Rap olympics i try to be fit so I jog
And jump on the beat like ma trampoline loose up
Im the ghs messiah and my closest bro judas true
Loyalty is only seen during money scenes
Money trees hardily grows in my street
Only thing I know is hustle puff pass to the right sideways
When its pay day  na dat be ride day
A living   logic  i render emcees invalid
Power lines shocking flow  brains melt  acid
Beautiful crime we gang bang life unda the sun
The past I f'd wit ur future now today wanna come
Beautiful crime lets tke a note of basic lines
Ryhmes  old school flow faked i analysed
Understand its like callin satellite stars
Devilish mind siamese bars i do combine
Hoodies these nameless gossip faceless  Rats hoodies
No goodies in their mind I call it fake studies
Yeah im all game all game epic tetris
Cos I got the bulding blocks bars u call pillars
Rap season captivated frm the start prologue
These rappers funny u leave me rolling like logs
Oh God  i got a bad thought
If with any beat any beat im a thot
Call this muffin bars
