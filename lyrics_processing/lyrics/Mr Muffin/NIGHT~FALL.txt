Night falls
Sometimes I fall
I call
I crawl
Is there a warmer ground
'Cos my people want feel the heat
Night falls
Sometimes I fall
I call
I crawl
Is there a warmer ground
'Cos my people want feel the heat

Been in this for the long run
Silence when they talk its a short one
Pull la beard
Let them see that you come up
Lay laws
Let them see from the gorund up
Chai eno be play dont act up
Pretty soon ego dey on some bullshit
Understand people all be different
Number one the number sef be missing
Night falls
Sometimes I fall
I call
I crawl
Is there a warmer ground
'Cos my people want feel the heat
Night falls
Sometimes I fall
I call
I crawl
Is there a warmer ground
'Cos my people want feel the heat

It's either love or despise
Yeah see these spies
hot or cold
You will fly just be bold you'll fly
It's either love or despise
Yeah see these spies
hot or cold
You will fly just be bold you'll fly

In the sunshine
In the rain
On the road
In the lane
Let them go
At first ego pain
Let them go
At first ego pain
Chale those days I remember
We dey vibe
Now di3r you feed up
You dey chill
You dey feel
Ei Breda
