Dare ma me beat
A hell of a dream
A hell of a dream
Music a hell of a dream
Gameshaw

Vision blurred impaired dull sight glasses on
Corneal defect Illusion strong
Walking long darkened thoughts
Feeling these notes with lyrics
Um it's all that I got
Yup!
It's all that I got
Let me be free you holding my fight, burying scenes stealing designs
Swine bele with some bad jokes
Feline Ewe bois yeah come cho
Define what's rap on the block
Yo
Refined new strings on a board
Yo
Inside my mind torn ego
Spin word spin flow tornado
Spit bars spit bars TB flow
While wack emcees hold ego
You might also like
A hell of a night
A hell vicious ride
Hi mamacita I'm in for the night
Ain't got some figures
Who who I'm pulling the rod
Choking the throats, evil design
Ha ha
Music a hell of a dream
Music a hell of a dream
I'm pulling the figures
Evil designed evil design

Err vision blurred, blue balls yup viagra stoned
Oh my god gone too hard
Feeling numb to the world
I've never been scared
Ain't ever saved bread
'Hol up you never seen fear
Oh yes I never seen fear
Seen dears seen love just tears
So let me be free, it's all that I got
Yup let me be free

A hell of a night
A hell vicious ride
Hi mamacita I'm in for the night
Ain't got some figures
Who who I'm pulling the rod
Choking the throats, evil design
Ha ha
Music a hell of a dream
Music a hell of a dream
I'm pulling the figures
Evil designed evil design
Um your purpose
To be mad or be nervous
Is it lies mischievous
Is it heartbreak insidious
Or fall fall deep in abyss
Aim for a dream
Don't be deceived
Aim for the trees
My mission ain't dead
I'm coming with shots
'Fellas beware 'cause it's been

A hell of a night
A hell vicious ride
Hi mamacita I'm in for the night
Ain't got some figures
Who who I'm pulling the rod
Choking the throats, evil design
Ha ha
Music a hell of a dream
Music a hell of a dream
I'm pulling the figures
Evil designed evil design
Ha ha
