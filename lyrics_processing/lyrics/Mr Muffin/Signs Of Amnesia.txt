I did a missed call
She never called back
What did I do wrong(do wrong)
The things ain't the same again
Signs of amnesia
My memories escaping me

Six months no you been harder
Six months been booze strong liquor
Stress and lust
No satisfaction in this world why bother
My brother I wonder
I wonder what it takes right now to run am
I wonder what it takes right now to love am
I wonder what it takes right now to hold am
The feeling I get everytime
When you text was warm and sweet
Now everything feeling dead to me
Those promises
Those promises
