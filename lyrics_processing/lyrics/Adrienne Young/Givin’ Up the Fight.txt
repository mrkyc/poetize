To take your hand, climb up and ride away
But the good things in this life grow slow and steady
And I was trying to fit forever in a day
Oh and now I sense there's so much here between us
Needs faith and space and time to make it right
So I am letting go
So that love can grow
Well baby I am giving up the fight
All the while I spent lost in restless wander
For a person, place or thing to make me whole
Is now a memory that I can gently ponder
As a lesson in relinquishing control
'Cause as simple as it sounds I'm finally learning
Well that everything I need is here inside
So just let it go, let's let our love grow
Yeah baby I am giving up the fight
You belong, just as I do
To the dark and to the light
Right or wrong, it's just two points of view
So baby I am giving up the fight
So amazed at all the blessings of our table
At the miracles of love that we've been shown
Well as side by side we sit so young and able
To heed lessons learned and those we've yet to know
'Cause when two hearts reach a deeper understanding
Well their love it can survive the blackest night
So just let it go
Let's watch our love grow
Well baby I am giving up the fight
You belong, just as I do
To the dark and to the light
Right or wrong, it's just two points of view
Oh baby I am giving up the fight
You belong, just as I do
Both to the dark and to the light
Right or wrong, it's just two points of view
So baby I am giving up the fight
The fight
The fight
