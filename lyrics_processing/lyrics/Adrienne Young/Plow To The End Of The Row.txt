Wake up in the morning in the moonlight grey
We got dirt to break, we got a note to pay
I'm gonna plow, plow to the end of the row
I'm gonna wake up in the morning and plow to the end of the row

Down to the kitchen with my feet still bare
Children to the table, papa say a prayer
I'm gonna plow, plow to the end of the row
Down to the kitchen, got to plow to the end of the row

Cornbread for breakfast, won't ya boil the grinds
Got to cut the furrow 'fore the sun gets high
I'm gonna plow, plow to the end of the row
Cornbread for breakfast and I plow to the end of the row

Sun just broke out over the trees
I got a aching in my back and a tremblin' in my knes
If the mule won't pull then the plow won't go
If the seed don't set, then the crop won't grow

Chickens to the market, seven miles to town
Gotta make it home 'fore the sun goes down
Big storm coming, I can see it in the sky
I hope it don't rain 'fore the clothes get dry
You might also like
I got rocks in my shoes, dirt in my eyes
Working like a dog 'til the day I die
You got to plow, plow to the end of the row
I got rocks in my shoes when I plow to the end of the row

My baby's waitin' for me at the end of the day
She likes to ball the jack in the sweetest way
I'm gonna plow, plow to the end of the row
My baby's waitin' for me so I plow to the end of the row

Wake up in the mornin' in the moonlight grey
We got dirt to break we got a note to pay
I'm gonna plow, plow to the end of the row
