With dust on your shoulder
Well you crashed in this mornin'
Wearin' only your pride
Highways and freight trains
Drivers with no names
Well you played such a god game it was easy to ride
With a poor man's scheme and
Rich man's dream
You ran for your life
Over El Rio into Laredo it was do or die
The stars hung bright on the other side
Well I offered a cold beer
And I said you could stay here
I swallowed my own fear
Cos I knew what was right
We spoke in a language that was
Here before Cambridge
Colored bright terracotta and aquamarine
With a poor boy's dream and a
Rich man's scheme
You sacrificed the warmth of your wife's hand
Your children and homeland for a roll lof dice
A bitter slice of American Pie
You might also likeMighty walls of Jericho
Toppled by the sound of tiny feet
Trumpets sound and we will know
Just who's sitting in the driver's seat
Oh these walls are comin' down
Getting back to the ground
And there'll be victory
In the sound of their defeat
Well you slept when the dawn came
So I undid the latch chain I walked
Down to the riverbank and thought about life
Just when did this happen
Was it always the fashion
Playin' just to win disregarding the price
Such a rich man's scheme using
Poor boy's dreams
To fight the fight
How far will we go pretending we don't know what is wrong or right
The stars hang bright on the other side
Mighty walls of Jericho
Toppled by the sound of tiny feet
Trumpets sound and we will know
Just who's sitting in the driver's seat
Oh these walls are comin' down
Getting back to the ground
And there'll be victory
