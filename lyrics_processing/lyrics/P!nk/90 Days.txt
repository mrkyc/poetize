No-no-no, no-no-no, no
Hey
No-no-no, no-no-no, no

We're driving in a black car
And it's blacked out and we're spinnin'
We're listening to "Fast Car"
And you're driving fast and you're singin'
Don't wanna tell you what I'm feelin'
Don't want this night to hit a ceiling
I'm wearing dirty white shoes
A white t-shirt and your jacket
I'm laughing, but I'm lying
When you're smiling, I'm the saddest
I hide my face so you don't see it
I think out loud, hope you don't hear it

It's going on 18 months now
And it's fucked up, but I'm falling
I feel it every day now
But I'm stallin', but I'm stallin'
I'm here, but I'm in pieces
And I don't know how to fix this
And I don't know how to fix this, no

If I'm just somebody that you're gonna leave
And you don't feel something when you look at me
You're holdin' my heart, mmm, whatcha say?
Just let me down slowly, I'll be okay
If you're just some habit that I gotta break
I can clear my system in 90 days
You're holdin' my heart, mmm, whatcha say?
Just let me down slowly

I get up, turn the lights out
And it's four o'clock in the morning
I close my eyes, I can't sleep
A hotel room in New York, and
I feel the space that's in between us
Convince myself that this is real love

'Cause you made this shit so easy
And I told you my secrets
So I don't know why I'm tongue tied
At the wrong time when I need this
I'm here, but I'm in pieces
And I don't know how to fix this
And I don't know how to fix this, no
If I'm just somebody that you're gonna leave
And you don't feel something when you look at me
You're holdin' my heart, mmm, whatcha say?
Just let me down slowly, I'll be okay
If you're just some habit that I gotta break
I can clear my system in 90 days
You're holdin' my heart, mmm, whatcha say?
Just let me down slowly

I-I-I, I-I-I, I-I-I
Ooh, no
We're drivin' in your fast car, your fast car
We're drivin' in your fast car, your fast car
We're drivin' in your fast car, your fast car
We're drivin' all night
We're drivin' in your fast car, your fast car, yeah
We're drivin' in your fast car, your fast car, yeah
We're drivin' in your fast car, your fast car, yeah
We're drivin' all night

If I'm just somebody that you're gonna leave
And you don't feel something when you look at me
You're holdin' my heart, mmm, whatcha say?
(Oh, you're holdin' my heart)
Just let me down slowly, I'll be okay
If you're just some habit that I gotta break (Gotta break)
I can clear my system in 90 days
You're holdin' my heart, mmm, whatcha say?
(Oh, you're holdin' my heart)
