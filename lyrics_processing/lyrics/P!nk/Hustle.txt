Woo

I gave you soft, I gave you sweet
Just like a lion, you came for a sheep
Oh no, don't try to hustle me
You took my love, mistook it for weakness
I guarantee I won't repeat this
No, don't try to hustle me (Don't try to hustle me)

I live my life like a bullet in a gun
Give you all my love 'til my patience is done
Oh no, don't try to hustle me

So don't hustle me (Whoop, whoop)
Don't hustle me (Whoop, whoop)
Don't fuck with me (Whoop, whoop)
And don't hustle me (Whoop, whoop)
So don't hustle me (Whoop, whoop)
Don't hustle me, no (Whoop, whoop)
Don't fuck with me (Whoop, whoop)
Don't hustle me (Whoop, whoop)

'Cause it won't do no good at all to say you're sorry now
Your words, they are falling on deaf ears
