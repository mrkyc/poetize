Laughin' loud so all the little people stare
Lookin' for a daddy to pay for the champagne (Drop a name)
What happened to the dream of a girl president?
She's dancing in the video next to 50 Cent
They travel in packs of two and three
With their itsy-bitsy doggies and their teeny-weeny tees

Where, oh where, have the smart people gone?
Oh where, oh where could they be? (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Maybe if I act like that (Woo), that guy will call me back (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
Porno paparazzi girl, I don't wanna be a stupid girl
Baby, if I act like that, flippin' my blonde hair back
(Yeah) Push up my bra like that
I don't wanna be a stupid girl
