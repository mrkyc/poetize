Paintin' silver on the leaves
It's so beautiful out here
I just had to stop and stare
That's unusual for me
I had a happy heart of stone
No voice to answer but my own
Now I want more from the night
Since you waltzed into my life
You couldn't leave well enough alone
Why
Out of all the people in this world
Why did you set your sights and single out this girl
Oh
Why did you have to go and
Make me love you
Why'd you have to go and make me
Why'd you have to go and make me
Love you
In an instant sweet and strange
Everything about me changed
Whether I want to or not
I come to you with all I've got
And I'll never be the same

Make me love you
Why'd you have to go and make me
Why'd you have to go and make me
Love you
Tell me why
Why'd you have to go and make me
Why'd you have to go and make me
Love you
Maybe this is just a dream
Or maybe this was meant to be
I just pinch myself and wonder
Why
Why
Out of all the people in this world
Why did you set your sights and single out this girl
Oh
Why did you have to go and
Make me love you
