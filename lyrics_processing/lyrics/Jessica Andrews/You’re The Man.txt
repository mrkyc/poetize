On the shelf
This house don' t feel like home to me
I watch the clock up on the wall, Time stands
Still that' s all
When You' re out of reach I wish you could see
Since you went away I' ve been feeling this way
What I really want to stay
I wanna see you, I wanna be with you, I wanna
Feel you
And put my arms around you when I hold you
I won' t let go of you baby
If I could kiss you I' d make love to you ' cause
I need you
Like I never needed anybody, oh baby can' t
You see
You' re the man that brings the woman out of
Me
I took a walk out in the rain, Knowing that
You feel the same
With each goodbye I' m closer to you
Though the miles pull us apart, We both knew
It from the start
Together we can make it through
Every minute that you' re gone is a minute too
Long
Right here' s where you belong
You might also likeI wanna see you, I wanna be with you, I wanna
Feel you
And put my arms around you when I hold you
I won' t let go of you baby
If I could kiss you I' d make love to you ' cause
I need you
Like I never needed anybody, oh baby can' t
You see
You' re the man that brings the woman out of
Me
And when we are together it' s like nothing
That I' ve ever felt before
When you lay your hands on me
It' s lightning and it' s thunder, this sweet
Spell that I' m under
Baby, You' re all that I need
I wanna see you, I wanna be with you, I wanna
Feel you
And put my arms around you when I hold you
I won' t let go of you baby
If I could kiss you I' d make love to you ' cause
I need you
Like I never needed anybody, oh baby can' t
You see
You' re the man that brings the woman out of
