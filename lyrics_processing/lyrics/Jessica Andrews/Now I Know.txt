I just need to make things better
And I'm praying
That you'll let me work this out
I tried to call you on your phone
And it seems you're not at home
This is something that we have to talk about
Here I am
Finally face to face
Here's what I'm trying to say
What was I thinking, baby
Should've seen the writing on the wall
Never thought you'd ever leave me
Now I know
What were you tryin' to tell me
Thought about everything you said
Ever since you walked away, boy
Now I know
There's no other way to say it
Baby, please let's not delay it
Boy, I know you feel the same its in your eyes
You might also likeSince you've gone
My heart's been missing
And I hope that you will listen
Boy, without you
I won't make it one more night
Take me back
I was such a fool
I'm dying without you
What was I thinking, baby
Should've seen the writing on the wall
Never thought you'd ever leave me
Now I know
What were you trying to tell me
Thought about everything you said
Ever since you walked away, boy
Now I know
I can't live my life without you
Everything said was true
I should have known it from the start
Now you own my heart
Now I know
Now I know
Doesn't matter what I do
I can't make it without you
What was I thinking, baby
Should've seen the writing on the wall
Never thought you'd ever leave me
Now I know
What were you trying to tell me
Thought about everything you said
Ever since you walked away boy
Now I know
What was I thinking, baby
Should've seen the writing on the wall
Never thought you'd ever leave me
Now I know
What were you trying to tell me
Thought about everything you said
Ever since you walked away, boy
Now I know
What was I thinking, baby
Should've seen the writing on the wall
Never thought you'd ever leave me
Now I know
What were you trying to tell me
Thought about everything you said
Ever since you walked away, boy
