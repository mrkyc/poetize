With my heart up on the shelf
This house don't feel like home to me
I watch the clock up on the wall
Time stands still that's all
When you're out of reach I wish you could see
Since you went away I've been feeling this way
What I really want to say
I wanna see you
I wanna be with you
I wanna feel you
And put my arms around you
When I hold you
I won't let go of you baby
If I could kiss you I'd make love to you
'cause I need you
Like I never needed anybody
Oh baby can't you see
You're the man that brings the woman out of me
I took a walk out in the rain
Knowing that you feel the same
With each goodbye I'm closer to you
Though the miles pull us apart
We both knew it from the start
Together we can make it through
Every minute that you're gone is a minute too long
Right here's where you belong
You might also likeI wanna see you
I wanna be with you
I wanna feel you
And put my arms around you
When I hold you
I won't let go of you baby
If I could kiss you I'd make love to you
'cause I need you
Like I never needed anybody
Oh baby can't you see
You're the man that brings the woman out of me
And when we are together it's like nothing
That I've ever felt before
When you lay your hands on me
It's lightning and it's thunder, this sweet
Spell that I'm under
Baby, you're all that I need
I wanna see you
I wanna be with you
I wanna feel you
And put my arms around you
When I hold you
I won't let go of you baby
If I could kiss you I'd make love to you
'cause I need you
Like I never needed anybody
Oh baby can't you see
