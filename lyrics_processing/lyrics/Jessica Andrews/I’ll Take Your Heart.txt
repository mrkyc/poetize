Movin' up where you've never been
Tie your seatbelt, ooh, strap yourself in
Start a rumor, nothing to it
It's a dirty job, baby, but someone's got to do it

I don't wanna be the lonely game in town
I just wanna be the only girl around
Yeah I'm gonna take it straight to the top, never ever stop
Show you what I've got

I'll take your heart before you know it's gone
Leave you standing, but you won't be alone
Take your rhythm and leave you out of time
I'll take everything and give you all of mine
I'll take your heart and you ain't gonna feel it
Can't do nothing, babe, you know I'm gonna steal it
I'll take your heart before you know it's gone

Lady luck, just be good to me
Send me love, special delivery
Ain't in a movie, I ain't on TV
I'm a living, loving, breathing, leading kind of lady
You might also like
I don't wanna be alone at the end of the phone
I just wanna be the one that turns you on
Yeah, I'm gonna take you straight to the top, never ever stop
Show you what I've got

I'll take your heart before you know it's gone
Leave you standing, but you won't be alone
I'll take your heart and you ain't gonna feel it
Can't do nothing, babe, you know I'm gonna steal it

Some girls will leave you all alone
Some girls won't even take you home
But this girl is gonna turn you on
You know I'm never wrong

I'll take your heart before you know it's gone
Leave you standing, but you won't be alone
Take your rhythm and leave you out of time
I'll take everything and give you all of mine
I'll take your heart and you ain't gonna feel it
Can't do nothing, babe, you know I'm gonna steal it
