Do-do-do do-do-do-do
It was a stylish congregation, you could see they'd been around (Do-do-do)
And they had the biggest pipe-organ of any church in town (Do-do-do)
But, over in the Amen Corner of that church, sat Brother Ira (Do-do-do)
And he insisted every Sunday on singin' in the choir (Do-do-do)
His voice was cracked and broken, age had touched his vocal chords (Do-do-do)
And, nearly every Sunday, he'd get behind, and miss the words (Do-do-do)
Well, the choir got so flustered, the church was told, in fine (Do-do-do)
That Brother Ira must stop his singin', or the choir was gonna resign (Do-do-do)
So the pastor appointed a committee, I think it was three or four
And they got in their big fine car, and drove up to Ira's door
They found the choir's great trouble sittin' there in an old armchair
And the summer's golden sunbeams lay upon his snow-white hair
Said York, Uh, we're here, dear brother, with the vestry's approbation
To discuss a little matter that affects the congregation
Now, it seems that your voice has interfered with the choir
So, if you'll just lay out, er . . . are you listening, Brother Ira?
The old man raised his head, a sign that he did hear
And on his cheek, the three men caught the glitter of a tear
His feeble hands pushed back the locks as white as silky snow
And he answered the committee in a voice both soft and low
You might also likeI wonder if beyond the tide that's breakin' at my feet (Do-do-do)
In that far-off heavenly temple, where my Master I shall meet (Do-do-do)
Yes, I wonder if, when I try to sing the songs of God up higher (Do-do-do)
I wonder if they'll kick me out up there, for singin' in Heaven's choir (Do-do-do)
A silence filled the little room, the old man bowed his head (Do-do-do)
The committee went on back to town, but Brother Ira was dead (Do-do-do)
The choir missed him for awhile, but he was soon forgot (Do-do-do)
A few churchgoers watched the door, but the old man entered not (Do-do-do)
Far away, his voice is sweet, and he sings his heart's desires (Do-do-do)
Where there are no church committees, and no fashionable choirs (Do-do-do)
