So what are you doing back?
(Man)
Well, I set back and thought about
The things we used to do
It really meant a lot to me
You mean a lot to me
(Girl)
I really mean that much to you?
(Man)
Girl, you know it's true
I'm in love with you, girl, 'cause you're on my mind
You're the one I think about most every time
And when you crack a smile and everything you do
Don't you understand, girl, this love is true?
Your soft, silky hand long, sweet and thin
That candlelight complexion upon your skin
It lightens up my day and that's oh-so true
Together we're one, separated we're two
To make you all mine, all mine is my desire
'Cause you contain a quality that I admire
To put it plain and simple, you rule my world
So try to understand
You might also likeI'm in love, girl

Girl, you know it's true
My love is for you
Girl, you know it's true
My love is for you
This is some sort of thing, girl, I can't explain
My emotion starts up when I hear your name
Maybe your sweet, sweet voice which ring in my ears
Stimulate my senses, girl, when you are near
And with your positive emotions, lovemakin' and joy
There's no need to bust, it's like a girl and a boy
These feelings I get, I often wonder why
So I thought I might discuss this, girl, just you and I
In this relationship am I askin' too much
Just take a second to think what has to be done
Apart we are two, but, girl, together we're one
Now what you wear, I don't care, how you  this before
The reason that I like you, girl, is for what you are
If I sit and think about it, you rule my world
So try to understand
