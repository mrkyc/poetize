(Looking with big brown eyes at you)
(Boy in the tree and you can't run away)
I'm walking along in the USA
I'm thinking of how to be far away
Tryin' to find a game where I should play
And so I made up my mind, I should go by car
For goin' by foot, it was much too far
Lookin' around, I just didn't know what to say
Nothing seemed unreal
I soon realized
The boy in my tree
Boy in a tree who's watching you
Looking with big brown eyes at you
A boy in a tree and you can't run away
There's a boy in a tree who's watching you
Looking with big brown eyes at you
A boy in a tree and you can't run away
We go out in the world as a curious thing
I'm feelin' myself like a fairy tale king
I'm catched in a dream and I, I can't run away (Run)
I'm thinkin' about how to stop that dream
I wanna wake up through our hearts and beat
I'm catched in a dream and I, I can't run away
