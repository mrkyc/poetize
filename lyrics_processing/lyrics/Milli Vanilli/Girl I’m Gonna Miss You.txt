I knew it from the start you would break my heart
But still I had to play this painful part
You wrapped me round your little bitty finger
With your magic smile
You kept me hangin' on a lover's cross awhile
You put your spell on me, took my breath away
But there was nothin' I could do
To make you stay, I'm gonna miss you
All the love I feel for you
Nothing could make me change my point of view
Oh, girl (Oh, girl)
I'm gonna miss you, baby

Givin' all the love I feel for you
Couldn't make you change your point of view
You're leavin'
Now I'm sittin' here, wastin' my time
I just don't know what I should do

It's a tragedy for me to see
The dream is over
And I never will forget the day we met
Girl, I'm gonna miss you
You might also like
Like a honey bee, you took the best of me
Now I can't erase those memories
Like a fairy tale, you were so unreal
You left a scar that's so hard to heal
When you had a taste of paradise
Back on Earth can feel as cold as ice
I'm gonna miss you
I'm gonna miss you (I'm gonna miss you)
I miss you

Givin' all the love I feel for you
Couldn't make you change your point of view
You're leavin'
Now I'm sittin' here, wastin' my time
I just don't know what I should do

It's a tragedy for me to see
The dream is over
And I never will forget the day we met
Girl, I'm gonna miss you
It's a tragedy for me to see
The dream is over
And I never will forget the day we met
Girl, I'm gonna miss you

Givin' all the love I feel for you
Couldn't make you change your point of view
You're leavin'
Now I'm sittin' here, wastin' my time
I just don't know what I should do

It's a tragedy for me to see
The dream is over
And I never will forget the day we met
Girl, I'm gonna miss you
It's a tragedy for me to see
The dream is over
And I never will forget the day we met
