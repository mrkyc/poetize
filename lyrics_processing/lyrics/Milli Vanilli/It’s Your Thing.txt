Hey

It's your thing

I know it's your thing and you can do what you like
But if you want some good loving, don't take all night
I knew it from the start you had a real big heart
Tryna hide what you feel when you shoulda just chilled
You like being served with a silver spoon
Well, you met the right guy, never serve too soon
Oh, I like the way you talk when you look in my eye
I can read between the lines, let's go for a ride


It's your thing
Do what you wanna do, do
Baby, I can't tell you
Who to sock it do
It's your thing
Do what you wanna do, do
Girl, I can't tell you
Who to sock it do
Have no time to run your life
I know you wanna, do, do what's right
Oh, give your love girl to whoever you choose
How can you lose with the stuff you use?

It's your thing
Do what you wanna do, do
Girl, I can't tell you
Who to sock it do
It's your thing
Do what you wanna do
Baby, I can't tell you, ow
Who to sock it do
