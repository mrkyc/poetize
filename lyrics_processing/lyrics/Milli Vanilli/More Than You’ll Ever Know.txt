Hey, you know, Rob
The word, Mike, what's up?
Man, I got something to tell you
Oh, tell me, my brother
While you were gone, your woman
My woman what?
Your woman steppin' out on you
I gotta talk with this girl right now

Girl, rumor has it that you're leaving
Girl, tell me that it isn't so, woah

Never been one to show my feelings, kept my emotions deep inside
Oh, you don't know a good thing 'til you lose it, that's what it took to open up my eyes

Baby, I can't stand to see you go
I love you more, more than you'll ever know
Baby, I can't stand to see you go
I love you more, more than you'll ever know, ever know
Ever know, baby
Uh
You might also like
Girl, I never was a fancy, fancy talker
And girl, I write my passion in a song, oh

Hope my melody is appealing and words that I say can change your mind
Our love is poetry in motion, I need to have you here to make the lyrics rhyme

Oh, baby, I can't stand to see you go
I love you more, more than you'll ever know
I can't stand to see you go
I love you more, more than you'll ever know, ever know


Never been one to show my feelings, kept my emotions deep inside
Oh, you don't know a good thing 'til you lose it, that's what it took to open up my eyes

Oh, baby, I can't stand to see you go
I love you more, more than you'll ever know
I can't stand to see you go
I love you more, more than you'll ever know
I can't stand to see you go
I love you more, more than you'll ever know
I can't stand to see you go
I love you more, more than you'll ever know
Oh, baby, I can't stand to see you go
