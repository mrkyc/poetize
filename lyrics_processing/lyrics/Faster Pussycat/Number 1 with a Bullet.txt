Really gotta hand it to you
Are you positive?
Absolutely sure?
Well just get dressed, don't do this
Just get dressed, don't do this
You spent the night lit and listening to Miles Davis
You said that makes you want to fall in love
Or be smart enough to keep your distance
You can't decide, you can't decide
We're gonna die like this, you know
Miserable and old
Really gotta hand it to you
Really gotta hand it to you
Well just so you know
(Are you positive?)
When we get home
(Absolutely sure)
We're through
(Just get dressed, don't do this)
We're through
(Just get dressed, don't do this)

Oh yeah you've been there once or twice and you still don't like it
I say, "You just never gave it a chance"
Well give me a chance, give me a chance
Besides, did you ever stop to think
If we could keep this up, living like thieves?
But you can't decide, you can't decide
No you can't decide, well you can't decide
