Gettin' weak in the knees and your bruises are beginnin' to show
The only way she knows how to take it is blow by blow
Strapped to the rack with a slap on the ass should make her eyes glow
I ain't no boy of bondage, you can use it, you can use it
I'm a loose-lip talkin' jockey with a whip and track to prove it
I'm the dehumanizing master
You better start your talkin' 'cause I get what I go after
Where, where there's a whip, there's a way
(I'm gonna tighten up the slack in your chains)
Where, where there's a whip, there's a way
The devil in she likes sweet beatin' dreams every day
Where, where there's a whip, there's a way
(I'm gonna take you, gonna take you away)
When it's time to leave, baby, I'll let you know
I've got you buckled to the floorboards
Got you screamin' like a pooch on a leash to let you go
She grinds her leather like Liberace rhines a stone
She rides just like a pony, gonna sign that filly up for the rodeo
I ain't no boy of bondage, you can use it, you can use it
I'm a loose-lip talkin' jockey with a whip and track to prove it
I'm the dehumanizing master
You better start your talkin' 'cause I get what I go after

Where, where there's a whip, there's a way
The devil in she likes sweet beatin' dreams every day
Where, where there's a whip, there's a way
(I'm gonna take you, gonna take you away)
Nobody knows how to tie the simple knots that I know
She grinds her leather like Liberace rhines a stone
Gettin' weak in the knees and your bruises are beginnin' to show
She rides just like a pony, gonna sign that filly up for the rodeo
