Do you take what's in the box or what's behind door 213?
Chocolate man's gone crazy, he's in the Oxford up the street
Gonna take the Green River boat ride with a Sea-Tac walking ho
With a cast of killers, Black and Decker drillers
Fucked up mental load

Hides the hooded zodiac, hey baby, what's your sign?
Got San Francisco shaking like the San Andreas line
Chuckie's selling time share at the San Quentin country club
Gien's the mean lone furniture fiend
Selling tickets to his house of blood

The sweat beads up as the devil in you
Winds your ticking time bomb and lights your vicious fuse

Gone, gone, daddy, you're really gone
On your bed of tales you somber on
Gone, gone, daddy
You're just a body thief (Just a body thief)
Gone, gone, daddy, you're really gone
Does it get you high? Does it turn you on?
Gone, gone, daddy
You're just a body thief (Just a body thief)

Teddy scared my mother and the collegiate debutante
Clicked the switch and watched him twitch, we fried the bastard raw
Jeff's got one foot in the closet, one hand in the cookie jar
That ain't Palmolive you're soaking in, it's the flesh remover sauce

The sweat beads up as the devil in you
Winds your ticking time bomb and lights your vicious fuse

Gone, gone, daddy, you're really gone
On your bed of tales you somber on
Gone, gone, daddy
You're just a body thief (Just a body thief)
Gone, gone, daddy, you're really gone
Does it get you high? Does it turn you on?
Gone, gone, daddy
You're just a body thief (Just a body thief)
