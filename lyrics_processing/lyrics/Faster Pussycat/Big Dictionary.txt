You got the right pronunciation
You got the meaning all wrong
It's my, my first edition
Revise it if you like
But just remember it's a young man's book of bones

There's more to me than the words I read
Is it a language that's new to you?
And if you open your eyes instead of your legs
I wouldn't have to spell it out for you

She just loves me for my big dictionary
She wants my vocabulary
Complete from A to Z
She just loves me for my big dictionary
Mary, Mary's quite contrary
The sorest girl you've ever seen

Can you ride my composition?
It's a tongue-in-cheek religion
That I simply just made up
Maybe it's my, my superstition
You don't love me for my rhyme
Well, you know it's just my luck
You might also like
There's more to me than the words I read
Is it a language that's new to you?
And if you open your eyes instead of your legs
I wouldn't have to spell it out for you

She just loves me for my big dictionary
She wants my vocabulary
Complete from A to Z
She just loves me for my big dictionary
Mary, Mary's quite contrary
The sorest girl you've ever seen

"Hey there, sunflower
If I was to let your fingers do the walking through my fellow pages
Would you know what they mean?"
"Oh yes I would, I know I would and between them I'll read"

She just loves me for my big dictionary
She wants my vocabulary
Complete from A to Z
She just loves me for my big dictionary
Mary, Mary's quite contrary
The sorest girl you've ever seen
She just loves me for my big dictionary
She wants my vocabulary
Complete from A to Z
Well, she just loves me for my big dictionary
Mary, Mary's quite contrary
