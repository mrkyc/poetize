I'm just tired of keeping the rats company
It's not that I need someone to help me
Drag me out of bed and brush my teeth
I'm as aggravated as an old hound dog
Trying to remember where I buried my bone
Knocked off my feet and on my back
And these damn shorts are creeping up my crack
And it's hard to feel the sun when I'm sittin in the shade
It's all a bore to me when everything stays the same
Come on be my power station
Everyone needs a light
I don't need no paid vacation
To get me electrified
Come on, charge me up
And don't ever let me come
Don't ever let me come down
Charge me up
Cause it's all I need to keep me sound
I hate to sound ungrateful
But honey I could take to a little more of your energy
Well you're my, my addiction
And I'm strung out from your head down to your feet
You finally got me out from under my stone
And the big old dog finally found his bone
Back on my feet and off my back
And ripped those shorts right out of my crack
And it's good to feel the sun, I'm out of the shade
What was a bore to me just up and went away

Everyone needs a light
I don't need no paid vacation
To get me electrified
Come on, charge me up
And don't ever let me come down
Don't ever let me come down
Charge me up
Cause it's all I need to keep me sound
It's not that I'm lonely
I'm just tired of keeping the rats company
It's just bad company
Well you're my, my addiction
And I'm strung out from your head down to your feet
Just a fix is all I need
I don't need to paid vacation
To get me electrified
Got me a sweet little power station
