I left the evergreen combat zone
For a taste of a sweeter life for me, yeah
The star dog left the mother bone
For a jewel he'd never find or see, oh yeah

You may have hated me, I don't know
But I loved the way you played your role
You couldn't stop to kick the jive
It left your kin with salty eyes

Hey Mr. Lovedog (Mr. Lovedog)
You will always be
The one back home that could've had it all
Hey Mr. Lovedog (Mr. Lovedog)
Lord knows you never really knew me
God bless your velvet gifted soul
Makes no sense at all

Now you're the holy roller
With the hub cap diamond star halo, yeah
This is goodbye to Captain Hi-Top
Hope your Pearl Jam can keep it strong
You might also like
They may have hated me, I don't know
But I loved the way you played your role
You couldn't stop to kick the jive
It left your kin with salty eyes

Hey Mr. Lovedog (Mr. Lovedog)
You will always be
The one back home that should've had it all
Hey Mr. Lovedog (Mr. Lovedog)
Lord knows you never really knew me
God bless your velvet gifted soul
Makes no sense at all

Higher and higher and higher and higher we go
Where it stops, nobody knows (Nobody knows)
Higher and higher and higher and higher we go
Where it stops, nobody knows (Nobody knows)
Higher and higher and higher and higher we go
Where it stops, nobody knows (Nobody knows)

You might have liked me, I don't know
But I loved the way you played your role
You couldn't stop to kick the jive
It left your kin with salty eyes
Hey Mr. Lovedog (Mr. Lovedog)
You will always be
The one back home that should've had it all
Hey Mr. Lovedog (Mr. Lovedog)
Lord knows you never really knew me
God bless your velvet gifted soul
Hey Mr. Lovedog (Mr. Lovedog)
You will always be
Hey Mr. Lovedog (The one back home that should've had it all)
Oh, you could've had it all
Hey Mr. Lovedog (Mr. Lovedog)
Lord knows you never really knew me
Hey Mr. Lovedog (God bless your velvet gifted soul)
Makes no sense at all

Higher and higher and higher and higher we go
Higher and higher and higher and higher we go
Where it stops, nobody knows
Higher and higher and higher and higher we go
Higher and higher and higher and higher we go
Where it stops, nobody knows
Higher and higher and higher and higher we go
Where it stops, nobody knows
Higher and higher and higher and higher we go
Where it stops, nobody knows
Higher and higher and higher and higher we go
Where it stops, nobody knows
Higher and higher and higher and higher we go
Where it stops, nobody knows
