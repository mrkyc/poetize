Where pussy ain't no feline
Rev up my Chevy
I'm gonna pay to play
I'm gonna lickity-split I like that taste
I push ahead and I fall behind
Hav'n such a good, good time
I just wanna stay
Just got back from the best cathouse in town
And had the best piece of Mona Lisa I ever found
And I'm going back to the best cathouse in town
To get some more of that cheap little tramp right about now
Let's go to the house
Where business is a pleasure
Perversion is an aversion
That don't go away
I'm a hard, hard act to swallow
And she's my buried treasure
It'll be a long, long time
Before I'm on my way
Just got back from the best cathouse in town
And had the best piece of Mona Lisa I ever found
And I'm going back to the best cathouse in town
To get some more of that cheap little tramp right about now
You might also likeOoh I'm gonna get her to move in
Just got back from the best cathouse in town
And had the best piece of Mona Lisa I ever found
Now I'm goin back to the best cathouse in town
To get some more of that cheap little tramp right 'bout now
I won't get a movin
Gas up my Chevy, headed down the way
Sayin just God, get me back, get me back, I say
Just got back from the best cathouse in town
And had the best piece of Mona Lisa I ever found
And I'm going back to the best cathouse in town
To get some more of that cheap little tramp right about now
And I'm going back to the best cathouse in town
And had the best piece of Mona Lisa I ever found
And I'm going back to the best cathouse in town
To get some more of that cheap little tramp right about now
I'm going back from the best cathouse in town
To get some more of that Mona Lisa right about now
And I'm going back to the best cathouse in town
