I have dreamed the dream of every common man
Ahh, hoping to rise to the top
I have sworn by my blood as your man, my love
That one day, I promise one day your heartaches would stop

But I've never, never, never, never, changed
I never changed one single grain of sand
Oh, thanks to you, baby (Thanks to you, baby)
Haha, for just loving a common man
I want to thank you this evening, honey

Oh, I thought, I thought that I'd failed you so
But that's when you turned around and looked me in my eyes
And you let me know
You said, and you said it softly
I didn't have to worry about being a common man
You said, "David, you don't have to worry about rising to the top"
You said, you said, you said I didn't have to swear by my blood
But ah baby, that one day your heartaches would stop

Then you put your arms around and you said
You never, never, never, never cared
If I never change one single grain of sand
You said, "I love you, baby" (I love you, love you, baby)
"I love you for just being a common man"
