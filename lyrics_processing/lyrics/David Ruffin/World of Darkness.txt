But my world is black like the the darkness of the night
For me the stars up above refuse to shine
Since I lost that precious baby of mine
Since I lost that precious baby of mine
The month of May, may bring blossoms to the trees
But all of this beauty I'm much to blind to see
Take away my sight it's no good to me
'Cause loneliness is my destiny
Lonely loneliness is my destiny
And I feel like crying, crying
Almost dying, dying, dying, dying
She left me in a world of darkness, darkness
When she took her sweet love away from me, oh yeah
She took her sweet love away from me
I walk the street at night with no destination
Since she been gone I have no inspiration
When I stop to see just what she's done to me
I see tear stained eyes, cloudy skies
I'm lonely man, just a half of man that needs his baby
So I feel like crying, crying
Feel like dying, dying, dying, dying, dying
The girl she left me in a state of confusion and darkness
When she took her sweet love away from me, oh yeah
Why did you take your sweet love away from me
Ooh why did you take it, baby?

She left me I a state of confusion and darkness
Girl, why, why, why did you take your love?
Oh baby, why did you take your love away from me?
I'm a world of darkness, can't see no light
No satisfaction, baby, nowhere in sight
I'm a lonely man
Just a half a man
That needs his baby
And I feel like crying
I'm in a world of darkness
I'm all alone, baby
Once she took her love
Why you take your love?
Why you take your love, baby, away from me?
I fell like crying in the morning
Crying in the evening
Oh baby, feel like dying, dying, dying, dying, dying, dying
You left me in a world of confusion and darkness
Why did you take it baby?
Why did you take your love away from me?
Why did you take your sweet love away from me?

I'm crying, no satisfaction in sight
I'm crying, oh baby, I feel like dying
Lord have mercy, I feel like crying, crying, crying, crying
She left me in a world, in a world of confusion
Don't take it, don't take it, don't take it a way from me
Oh baby, don't take it away from me
