Ow
Mhm, mhm, wanna say it, wanna say it again
Mhm, listen, baby

When I had you to myself
I didn't want you around
Those pretty faces always made you
Stand out in a crowd
Then someone picked you from the bunch
One glance is all it took
Now it's much too late for me
To take second look

Oh baby give me one more chance
(To show you that I love you)
Won't you please let me (Back in your heart)
Oh darling, I was blind to let you go
(Let you go, baby)
But now I see you in his arms, I want you back
(I want you back)

I, I do now
(I want you back)
Oh baby
(I want you back)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
(I want you back)
Hey, hey now
You might also like
Trying to live without your love
Is one long sleepless night
(Yes it is, yes it is)
Let me show you, girl
That I know wrong from right
Every street you walk on
I leave tear stains on the ground
Following the girl I didn't even want around
Listen

Oh baby, give me one more chance
(To show you that I love you)
Won't you please send me (Back in your heart)
Oh darling, I was blind to let you go
(Let you go, baby)
But now I see you in his arms, I want you back
(I want you back)

A-buh-buh-buh-buh (A-buh-buh-buh)
A-buh-buh-buh-buh (A-buh-buh-buh)
A-buh-buh-buh-buh (A-buh-buh-buh)
A-buh-buh-buh-buh (A-buh-buh-buh)
A-buh-buh-buh-buh
All I want
(A-buh-buh-buh-buh)
All I need
(A-buh-buh-buh-buh)
All I want
(A-buh-buh-buh-buh)
All I need is one more chance
To show you that I love you
(Baby) Baby
(Baby) Oh baby
(Baby) I want you back
Forget what happened then (And let me live again)
Oh baby, I was blind to let you go
(Let you go, baby)
'Cause now since I see you in his arms, I want you back
(I want you back)
Spare me of this cause (Get back what I lost)
Oh baby, I need one more chance
To show you that I love you
Baby (Baby)
Oh (Baby)
Baby, I want you back
(I want you back)
Forget what happened then (And let me live again)
Oh baby, I was blind to let you go
(Let you go, baby)
'Cause now I see you in his arms, oh, I want you back
