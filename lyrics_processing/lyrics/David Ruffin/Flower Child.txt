Well, well, well

I caught a passing cab
To a part of town that was worn and drab
I walked down the dingy stairs
Ignoring the dirt that was lying there
From a space beneath the door
A light reflected on the floor
I saw shadows of passing feet
There was incense smelling sweet

So long I hesitated
I knocked and then I waited
My thoughts were running wild
Then I saw my flower child
I did, I did, I did (Flower child)

Although her voice was still the same
The years had truly made a change
My angel in disguise
Had long, dark hair and big black eyes
And then flowers, bright and tall
Splattered all over the wall
I just couldn't believe my eyes
"Was this the child?", I analysed
You might also like
Where, where, where did I go wrong
To make her leave her home?
I hid my shame with a smile
When I saw my flower child
Yes I did, I did (Flower child)

Ooh, ooh
Ooh
When, when I saw my flower, flower, flower, flower child (Flower child, flower child)
When I saw my flower child, yes I did (Flower child, flower child)

Well, well, well, well
Before I left, she kissed my cheek (Kissed my cheek)
There were no more words to speak (Words to speak)
'Cause at last I understood (Understood)
And it did my heart some good (Heart some good)
She said happiness was love
Something she had plenty of
Oh, I no longer felt the shame
'Cause my daughter made it plain

Sad, sad 'cause I had to go
I loved my baby so
My trip was sure worthwhile
At last, at last I saw my flower child (At last I saw my flower child)
I did, I did, I did, I did (Flower child)
Sad 'cause I had to go
I loved my daughter so
When I, when I saw my flower child (When I saw my flower child)
I did, I did, I did (Flower child)
Honey, at last I understood
And it did my heart a whole lot of good
