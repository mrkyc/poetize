Let me tell you all about it
Sometimes, I think about it
And my poor heart wants to die about it, ooh
About this sweet, sweet love i lost
And the way i got double crossed
By a guy who was my friend
I see him now and then, but
I pretend I'm doing fine, but I'm about to lose my mind
Ohh

You know i told my father all about it
And he just jumped up and walked all around and laughed out loud all about it
He said "The love I think I lost"
And the way i got double double crossed
By a guy who was my friend, if I ever see him again
Tell him he can't really win
Cause she'll be back to see me again!
Ohhhh love, oooh

Oh now my father, he may know best
But I forgot, I forgot to tell him all the rest
I received an invitation about a month ago, yes I did
To a wedding, to a wedding I decided not to go
'Cause I couldn't stand the pain, I would have been so ashamed
To see the girl I love, walk away and take another name
That's why I sit down, I sit down and ask my mother all about it
Yes I did
Ohh, I sit down and I talk with my father all about it
About the love I think I lost, and the way I got double, double Double, double crossed
By a guy who was my friend
If I ever see him again
Tell him she'll be back again
Ohhh, ooh ohh ooh

Ohhhh, baby not the double cross, yeah
I don't wanna lose a good thing
That's right sit down, 24 hours, ooh
