If I became President, I know I wouldn't last a day
I'd lower all the taxes just to suit your taste
I'd bring home all the fellas over in Vietnam
Station them around your door, so the world couldn't do you no harm
I would name that state and city, Honey, after you
In the fight against poverty, there's no limit to what I'd do

I could never be President
Just as long as I'm lovin' you (Do-do-do)
I could never be President
Just as long as I'm lovin' you, you
Oh, honey

Honey I would make you, the first lady of the land
Don't you know being president, the power's in your hand
Congress would veto the first bill I would pass
First, would be to tear down the White House and build new houses there
I'd lay out a carpet surface on every downtown street
So, your little feet wouldn't get tired when you go on a shopping spree
Hoo!

I could never be President
Just as long as I'm lovin' you (Do-do-do)
I could never be President
Just as long as I'm lovin' you, you
Ooh! Hoo!
Oh, yeah
Oh, no, no, no
You might also like
Honey to make sure, you never, never, never have a care
I'd open up the doors to Fort Knox and tell you to help yourself
I'd build a nation and if that didn't seem to do
I'd send up Gemini 12 and stake a claim on the moon for you

Oh
I could never be President
Just as long as I'm lovin' you (Do-do-do)
I could never be President as long as I'm lovin' you (Do-do-do)
I'd build a nation and if that didn't do, woo! ( I could never be President just as long as I'm lovin' you, do-do-do)
Woo! I could never be President as long as I'm lovin' you (Do-do-do)
Woo! Baby, woo! (I could never be President just as long as I'm lovin' you, do-do-do)
I could never be President
