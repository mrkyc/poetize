'Cause you gave me the love I needed so
But now you say you're leavin'
Baby please don't go
No I won't try to hurt you
To hurt your feelings bad
If you ever leave, if you walk out the door
No, this won't be a home
If your love is gone
Without your smiling face, this house is an empty place
So please, ooh
Don't stop lovin' me baby
If you do it's gonna break my heart
(Lovin' me baby)
Don't stop (lovin' me baby)
If you do it's gonna tear me apart
Trust I gave my heart to you for a lifetime
Don't say it's over baby
Please change your mind
I'll be weakened and foul from being alone
If you take back your love
If you treat me wrong
You might also like'Cause my heart that you've received
Lord, I can't take it back from you
Couldn't live another day if you've gone away
So please, ooh
Don't stop lovin' me baby
If you do it's gonna break my heart
(Lovin' me baby)
Don't stop (lovin' me baby)
If you do it's gonna tear me apart
(Don't stop lovin me)
Ooh, lovin' me baby
(Don't stop lovin me)
Yes darlin'
One more thing I gotta say
Night and day I weep
And I won't get no sleep
My heart would ache with pain
If I never see you again
So please, ooh
Don't stop lovin' me baby
(Don't stop lovin' me baby)
If you do it's gonna break my heart
