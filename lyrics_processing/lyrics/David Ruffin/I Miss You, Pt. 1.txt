Ooh, ooh

(Oh, I) Oh, I
(Oh, I) Oh oh, I
(Miss you) I miss you baby
(Miss you, miss you, miss you, miss you, miss you)
And oh, I (Oh I)
(Oh, I) Oh oh, I
(Miss you) I miss you baby
(Miss you, miss you, miss you, miss you, miss you)
I swear I do (I wish I could)

Every since you went away
I ain't been doing nothing everyday but
(Thinking, thinking, thinking)
Thinking, thinking and thinking and thinking
With my head in my hands
(Thinking, thinking)
You been away from me so long
I just don't think I can carry on so I start
(Drinking, drinking, drinking)
Drinking and drinking and drinking that good feeling again
Each and every night
(Drinking, drinking)
You might also like(Ah, ah, ah)
Oh, ohh
So I drink all my loneliness away
And go from day to day
Oh lord, on my hands and knees
I wait here for your return
(Oh how I yearn) Oh, how I yearn

(If I come back, would things be any different?)
(Oh, I) Oh, I
(Oh, I) Oh oh, I
(Miss you) I miss you baby
(Miss you, miss you, miss you, miss you, miss you)
I wanna see you one more time
(David, I miss you too)

Can't you can look in my eyes and see
That a great big man like me has been
(Crying, crying, crying)
Crying, crying and crying my soul and heart out to you
(Crying, crying)
(Don't do that, you make it so difficult)
I'm getting tired of
Sitting in my lonely room
Filled with nothing but gloom and I feel like
(Dying, dying, dying)
Dying and dying and dying
(Dying, dying)
I guess I better hang it up
(If I could believe you ...)
Ever since the day you left
I don't know what to do with myself
Oh, on my hands and knees
I wait for your return
(Oh, how I yearn) Oh, how I yearn

(But after all we've gone through)
(Oh, I) Oh, I
(I just can't, I just can't walk back in)
(Oh, I) Oh oh, I
(Miss you) I miss you baby
(Miss you, miss you, miss you, miss you, miss you)
I wanna say it with my heart
(You sound so sincere)
Oh, I
(But how well I know you)
Oh oh, I
I miss you baby
(Miss you, miss you, miss you, miss you, miss you)
I swear I do
(If only)
Oh, woo
(Oh, how I yearn) Oh-oh-woah
(If only I knew that this time things would be different)
(Oh, I) Oh, I
(Oh, I) Oh oh, I
I miss you baby
(Miss you, miss you, miss you, miss you, miss you)
I'm tired of drinking and drinking and thinking and thinking and crying and crying
(Oh, I) Woo, oh oh I
(If I could just trust you)
(Oh, I) Ooh, you sound good
(If I could just try)
Oh, I'm getting tired
I guess I better hang it up, get back in my room
(Miss you, miss you, miss you, miss you, miss you)
(Oh, I) Oh oh, I
This lonely room is getting crowded
(Oh, I) Oh oh, I
I miss you baby
(Miss you, miss you, miss you, miss you, miss you)
On my hands and knees, I'm beggin' you
