Hmm, hmm, hmm-mmm

I was raised an only child
My folks died when I was four
They were trapped in a fire
Way up on the fourteenth floor
So my lovin' granny raised me
'Til I reached the age of ten
But the good Lord took her too
And left my dog Jeff my only friend

Oh, baby
Seem like the odds are against me
Nothing works out right for me, ooh

I've lost everything I've ever loved
Honey, honey, now I'm losing you, baby
I've lost everything I've ever, ever loved
Honey, honey, now I'm losing you
Oh, baby

So all my love I gave to Jeff
'Cause he was all I had right then
But the wheels of an automobile
Brought his life to a tragic end
From an orphan home to college
Now I found true love in you
I felt sure one day we'd marry
But your folks did not approve
You might also like
Oh, baby
Seem like the odds are against me
Nothing works out right for me, ooh

I've lost everything I've ever loved
And now, and now I'm losing you, oh
I've lost everything I've ever loved, baby
Honey, honey, now I'm losing you
Ooh

Oh, baby

You accepted their decision
Without any type of defence
They said if we wait a few more years
That would make a little more sense
So we waited three or four
Every day we kept in touch
But when we came face to face
You didn't love me quite as much

Oh, baby
Seem like the odds are against me
Nothing works out right for me
Ooh, ooh
I've lost every, everything I've ever loved
Baby, baby, baby, now I'm losin' you
I've lost everything, honey, I've ever loved
Ow, ow (Now, I'm losin' you)
Now I'm losin' you
(I've lost everything I've ever loved)
I've lost every, every, everything, baby, I've ever, ever loved
(Now, I'm losin' you)
Honey, now I'm losing, I'ma-lose, I'ma-losin' you
(I've lost everything I've ever loved)
I've lost my dog Jeff, oh and I lost Granny too
(Now, I'm losin' you)
