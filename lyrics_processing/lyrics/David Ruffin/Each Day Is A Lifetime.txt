I remember holding you, and feelin' like a king
How I miss you baby, when I think of all the little things I used to do with you
Now that I'm without you, I'm so blue

It seems that I just kissed your lips a little while ago
Everything around me makes me stop a while and think of all the things we used to do
How the time goes so slow without you baby
So I

Sing a little longer in the shower
And I fuss around a little more at work
Each day is a lifetime
Each day's gettin' so long I'm about to go out of my mind

Try to waste another hour
And I take another walk around the bar
Each day is a lifetime
Each day's gettin' so long I'm about to go out of my mind
I'm out of my mind

Oh baby listen
I can almost see your face, right here before my eyes
And I can almost taste my tears
That drip right down up on my lips the moment that I knew baby
That never again would I be seeing you no
You might also like
Listen there's no one that can take the place
Holdin' my heart
Nothin' seems to cross my mind as knowin' right now your in the arms someone new
And here I stand with nothing to do baby
So darlin' I

Sing a little longer in the shower
And I fuss around a little more at work
Each day is a lifetime
Each day's gettin' so long I'm about to go out of my mind

Try to waste another hour
And I take another walk around the bar
Each day is a lifetime
Each day's gettin' so long I'm about to go out of my mind
I'm out of my mind

I wonder how I'll ever make it through the day baby
When I know very well that you'll never come again
So that's why baby

I sing a little longer in the shower
And I fuss around a little more at work
Each day is a lifetime
Each day's gettin' so long I'm about to go out of my mind
I'm about to go out of my mind, out of my mind
Oh baby
I sing a little longer in the shower
And I fuss around a little more at work
Each day is a lifetime
Each day's gettin' so long I'm about to go out of my mind
I'm about to go out of my mind, out of my mind
I sing a little longer in the shower
