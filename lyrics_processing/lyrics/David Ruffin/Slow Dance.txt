Slow it down
Ooh, baby
Slow it down
I've been watchin' you all night long, baby
I've been wantin' to get next to you, darling
You look so good baby
And I just wanna dance with you, Oooh

I've been waiting all night long
For a slow song
To dance with you
I don't wanna jump around
I don't wanna boogie down
I don't wanna prance
'Cause I need romance
I just wanna hold you near
Whisper in your ear
The picture is clear
I want you my dear

Lets slow dance
Slow dance with you
Oooh, Slow it down
Dance the night away
You might also like
All the music has been to fast
A slow dance comes at last
How long will it last?
Now that I have you in my hands
We'll gently slow dance right away
The music almost done
But we can still have fun
Why waste any time?
Lets go to your place or mine

Lets slow dance
We can Slow dance
I wanna dance with you
Cause you know what to do
In those skin tight pants
I love the way you dance
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna
Slow dance with only you baby

Oooh, Slow it down
Oooh, Slow it down
Slow it down
Take it slow don't let go
We got time, baby
Lets go to your place or mine
Need it bad, it's the best, the best I've ever had
I want you more and more and more
I've been waiting all night long
For a slow song
To dance with you
I don't wanna be jumpin' around
I don't wanna boogie down
Don't wanna prance
'Cause I need romance
I just wanna hold you near
Whisper in your ear
The picture is clear
I want you my dear

Lets slow dance
I wanna slow dance
I wanna slow dance
With you all night long
It won't take to much time
Let's go to your place or mine

Oh you move me
You groove me baby
Those skin tight pants
I love the way that you dance
I don't wanna
Jump around all night long
I wanna hold you close in my arms, baby
Just to see what its like being near
Wanna slow dance with only you my dear
Cheek to Cheek, Toe to Toe
