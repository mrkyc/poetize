Darkness falls upon the city, yeah yeah
The smell of violence fills the air, do you believe
Somebody raped another woman, yeah yeah
A gun will kill another man, listen to me

Situation critical
All over the land
Listen, people

Blood donors needed
Bad, bad, bad
Oh, give all you can
Gotta give it up
Listen, people
Hoo hoo

Emergency rooms are overflowin'
Through the night I hear the sound of screamin' sirens
A shotgun blast I heard from the ghetto, guess what?
Just took the life of a boy of sixteen

Oh, people
Another would-be mother, her baby she's killin'
Before the fingers form up on his hand
You might also like
Ooh ooh
I'm screamin', "Blood donors needed"
Don't make me cry
Oh, Lord, we need it, woo hoo
Give all you can this evenin'

Blood of the times
Oh, blood on your mind
The blood of your aunt
The blood of your loved one
Got to tell ya, woo hoo

5:45 in the mornin', yeah yeah
Dawn break the darkness in the East, hallelujah
It's the mornin' sun risin', yeah yeah
To bring the weary city just a little relief

And all you people who slept so safely
Get up, start your day
Let me ask you a question

When you read your mornin' paper, tell me, tell me, people, tell me
What do your headlines say? Woo hoo
Woo hoo
Blood donors needed
Give all you can, yeah yeah
Can I say it
Blood donors needed
Ooh hoo
You know you got to give all you can this evenin', yeah
Got to say it again
Blood on your mind
Blood on your mind
Gotta give it up
Blood on your arm
Blood on your arm
Right now, right now
Blood on your arm, arm, ooh ooh

Blood donors needed
Give all you can, give it, give it up right now, yeah yeah yeah
Gotta give all you can, yeah yeah
