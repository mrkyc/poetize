Huh yeah, hop on the dash
I gave her horse while she gave me some ass
Woah wait, I'm running fast
Biting my dust like I'm smoking some gas
Beat on my drum, just like a rum pum pum
Okay okay, then wash it all down with a bottle of rum
Huh yuh Sam I Am
I gave her green while she give me some ham
Woah wait, I'm in a jam
I'm in her throat like an oral exam
I be spin it to win it, like a TV Program
Okay Okay
Then melt all your ice like I don't give a dam (damn)

Talking that shit I will fight you, aye
Shock on your tail like a Raichu, aye
"What are we" bitch I don't like you, aye
I just might fuck on your waifu, aye
Shine at yo head, but no Cailou, aye
You last 6 seconds like Vine do, aye
Rent-a-bitch, no one would buy you, aye
Double wrist watch on me; times two, aye

You can ask if your mom if she wants to
Hot stuff, but you not, cause you're unware
That your woman crush Wednesdays in my underwear
Diamonds be everywhere, Iceman Etika
I'm on that medicare you on that pedicare
Make it Spray, on your hips, let the Rain drop
Open up, give me head, issa drop top
Pussy nigga you be dead, with a pop pop
Pussy nigga, cut you out like a Box Top
I likes the sound of my beats
She likes the taste of my meat
I got new j's on my feet
Swerving these bitches like Yeet

Slim it now, dick her down
Like her dad is outta town (x4)
