Pokemon balls down her throat
Yuh wait I'm playing Pokemon Go
I do not fuck with no hoes
Yuh wait I just poke em' and go
Putting my stacks in a row
Yuh (count em'!) I think that I need a boat
Bitch you know I am the goat
Yuh wait I got fur coat to my toe
I got paper like recycle bin
I steal some bread like Aladdin did
Spending it all on a diamond ring
I saw yo mans at the Dollar Tree, I be like
Drip drop in an April shower
Lemon grab cause I make it sour
Bed times been past the hour
Spit fire that's Flower Power
Get out of line and you'll have a bad time
Genocide if they lie
Pacifist if they cry
I don't mercy these niggas I pull up in triggers
And shoot at your figure until u are triggered
I whip it I whip it Papyrus spaghetti
Put you in the ground like your name is ressetti
I'll slice u in pieces with Auron's machete
Then, I'll snatch your waifu my body is ready
