I gotta try, no for fucks sake let me die
It's hard to say hello when I love to say Goodbye
On God, this hurts the worse, just end my life so
Death can be my sweet dreams, you're my lullaby
Shots firing, I'm a loose cannon
Suicide called me, "Get me off this planet"
Can't fix what's broken, straight jacket
Hand filled with a rachet, rose that's on my casket
Fuck a gun, grab a knife to bleed slowly
Stab my heart out to end my life story
In the rain, droping quaters for the payphone
To say my last word before my names on a gravestone
Never once did I say that it's not true...
But now I'm feeling that I want you
My words are what my emotions don't protray
Lay me down and pray, I'll never see another day
"I live miles away" don't even start
Girl, how can you be there when you're right inside my heart
Champagne stirs deeply in my brain, I drink until my colon kneels down like my stomach reigns
When I always pleasure myself I get the notion that the only girls I'll see undressed is covered with some lotion
Why would you love me? My body is disturbing, a trashcan with a lid where it's derserved in
You might also likeI get nauseous, think that I'm allergic
From the way you smile, it fills me up with courage
All I ever wanted was friends, but got enemies
The only ones I got are straight dead to me
Once told to do what makes me happy
But if I did that, then I wouldn't be alive b

Woke up, with a knife in my 'ralis
Let me ventalate while I'm looking at it
Taking shots to my head like an addict
Try to live it on, but I fucking had it
Once dancing with the stars, now you're old rust
15 years waiting for the supernova
I'm not the type of guy, that you make me of, but I guess if the shoe fits, then I'll wear it, huh?
Men are cruel, he's a fool, plentiful, these niggas are canibals, is your perception on on every guy that ever tried to touch your mandible
Just shut up, I just had it. Ever tried asking if I'm different from the pack, yet? Bitch I'm doing magic, and you're causing racket, listen to my dialect, before going batshit
Like
I'm just sick of the games
When can I aim at my brain
Love isn't feeling the same
Just put a dead to my name
Don't light my candle with flame
Yeah...
