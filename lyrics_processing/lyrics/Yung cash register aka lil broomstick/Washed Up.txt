Skrrt!
I guess I'm feeling washed up, I'm washed up, yuh
I'm washed up, I'm washed up
Yuh, aye, I'm washed up
Yuh, aye, I'm washed up
I guess I'm feeling washed up, I'm washed up, yuh
I'm washed up, I'm washed up
Yuh, aye, I'm washed up
Yuh, aye, I'm washed up

Born with an unseen purpose
Make you contemplate if you're worth shit
Try to hide the pain but isn't working
When the only way is to tell a person
But it's worthless (worthless)
They don't understand that you're really hurting
And you're cursing every word in cause your mind just keeps on turning
Fuck the world and Donald Trump, and basically the Ku Klux Klan
Our president is the candidate for the worst bitch on this planet
But my ex-girl would be first but what's saving her is her thirst for me
It's cocaine in her skirt, but she still deserves the worst
I gotta keep my pace up, no sauce but I still keep my bank up
No one's gonna stop me till I'm bankrupt
I need a girl in the world that's not banged up
I need one that understands where I came from
There's a reason why I'm acting like an a-hole
Because people fuck me over like it's anal
They enjoy it but never feel the pain, though
Fuck it, I'm gonna be ignorant, yuh
Since you don't read my own sentences, yuh
I crush a Xanax and sniff that shit, yuh
I got the ice on me, that's Christmas, yuh
But I melt all of the ice
Never gave a fuck if I was naughty or nice
I'm just tryna reach out like I turned off the lights
But turn it back on cause my dreams outta sight
Popping Xans turn to Contraband, don't you understand?
Wearing Vans with some Jogger Pants doesn't make you man
Make a stance, if you got a chance, don't you reminisce
Intelligence was the sixth sense that you people missed

I smoke some blacks with my Glock
I got my targets on lock
Just like a racists ass cop
I can not wear my own socks
Cause they think I'm hiding rocks
I'm just composed to these cocks
Even though I am not Bach
Might as well go and get shot
Yeah, I just might go and shot

My best friend was the love of my life
And it pains me, she'll never be my wife
What's wrong with me, got me tearing at night
Because she didn't like the way that I write
She's the reason why I love the taste of wine
I drink to numb the pain but I still cry
I would literally give you all of my time
But she'd rather take her own life than to be a part of mine

Let's try this again
I'm just the man with the plan
Got bread on my head
Sand man on my bed
Slept on once again
Cause somebody can't like all the good men
I'm hypocritical, let's all get biblical
If God accepts me then it's a big miracle
If you are spiritual, if you're not spiritual
What's the big issue here, we're the same figure here
Don't get so triggered, yeah
Let's all assume the worst
If God didn't exist and we deceased with the gases of the universe
Would you still be hurt or would it even hurt
When we disperse into waste and dirt
Then refill the earth till it all gets merked?
And wouldn't we get shipped up, Lil Uzi Vert?
I guess I'm feeling washed up, I'm washed up, yuh
I'm washed up, I'm washed up
Yuh, aye, I'm washed up
Yuh, aye, I'm washed up
I guess I'm feeling washed up, I'm washed up, yuh
I'm washed up, I'm washed up
Yuh, aye, I'm washed up
Yuh, aye, I'm washed up
I guess I'm feeling washed up, I'm washed up, yuh
I'm washed up, I'm washed up
Yuh, aye, I'm washed up
Yuh, aye, I'm washed up
I guess I'm feeling washed up, I'm washed up, yuh
I'm washed up, I'm washed up
Yuh, aye, I'm washed up
