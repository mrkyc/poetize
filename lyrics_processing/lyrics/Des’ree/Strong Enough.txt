Just where your life is goin'
Can you see the picture
In the purple sky?
Silently you're walkin'
But where are you headin'?
Questions terrorize, ah, yeah
Space inside your mind, ah, yeah
Are you strong enough for love?
Are you strong enough for peace?
Are you strong enough to die?
Tell me why
I'm strong enough for you
Are you strong enough for me?
'Cause down, down in the city
Love ain't always pretty
They try to take your soul and mind
But you won't let them
Never wear your destiny
Outside your smile
Always talk in riddles
So you keep them guessing
Never criticize, ah, yeah
Keep an open mind, ah, yeah
Are you strong enough for love?
Are you strong enough for peace?
Are you strong enough to die?
Tell me why
I'm strong enough for you
Are you strong enough for me?
'Cause down, down in the city
Love ain't always pretty
They're holding out their hands
Begging for some time
Can you spare a shilling
Can you spare a life?
You try to give them food
But they just refuse you
Deep down inside, ah, yeah
You know you've tried
Are you strong enough for love?
Are you strong enough for peace?
Are you strong enough to die?
Tell me why
I'm strong enough for you
Are you strong enough for me?
'Cause down, down in the city
Love ain't always pretty
'Cause are you strong enough?
Strong enough for me?
Strong enough
Strong enough to see
Strong enough
Strong enough to be
'Cause down, down in the city, yeah
Love ain't always pretty
Strong enough for love?
Are you strong enough for peace?
Strong enough to die?
Tell me why
Strong enough for me
Oh, I'm strong enough for you
'Cause down, down in the city, yeah
Love ain't always pretty, no
You're strong enough for me
I'm strong enough for you
You're strong enough to see
That down, down in the city
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah
