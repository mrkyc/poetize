Yeah yeah, aye aye, yeah yeah, yeah!
Sitting in cafs, drinking Brazil
Watching old ladies struggle up the hill
The sun is winking at me, giving me the eye
There's no better place to watch the time trickle by
'Cos we're living in the city, there ain't no room for peace
Wow, we're living in the city, there ain't no time for sleep
Hey, we're living in the city where everything is free
Oh, where I wanna be, hey hey, is living in the city
City, city
Walking 'round the buildings, watching pictures on the wall
People lying homeless, got no love at all
Standing next to history, everything is grand
People from the country never understand
That we're living in the city, there ain't no room for peace
Wow, living in the city, there ain't no time for sleep
Hey, living in the city where everything is free
Oh, where I wanna be, hey hey, is living in the city
City, city
City, yeah yeah
City
Find yourself a place
(Oh, find yourself a place)
Where there's caring and there's sharing
Find yourself a space
Where there's loving
(Loving)
Hoping
(Hoping)
Touching, feeling, feeling
Living in the city, there ain't no room for peace
We're living in the city, there ain't no time for sleep
We're living in the city where everything is free
Where I wanna be is living in the city
We're living in the city, there ain't no room for peace
Wow, we're living in the city, there ain't no time for sleep
Hey, we're living in the city where everything is free
Oh, where I wanna be, hey hey, living in the city
Living in the city, yeah
Wow, we're living in the city now, hey hey
Wow, we're living in the city, yeah yeah yeah
Where I wanna be, where I wanna be
Living in, living in, living, living in the city
We're living in, living in, living, living in the city
We're living in, living in, living, living in the city
Where I wanna be, where I wanna be
Oh oh, ah ah ah, oh, ah ah
Oh oh, ah ah ah, oh, ah ah
Oh oh, ah ah ah, oh, ah ah
Where I wanna be, yeah yeah yeah
We're only, we're only, we're only
