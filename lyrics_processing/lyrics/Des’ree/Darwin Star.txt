From a child, he was golden
Now he's a man
Whose looks were stolen
From some glossy page
Promising dreams of pure caviar
Starting out, wouldn't listen
His mother tired
Father reasoned 'bout painted-on smiles
Reel you in slowly to steal your place
Dah, de daah
(Dah, de daah)
Yes I trusted you
Do de daah
(Do de daah)
Yes I trusted you
Inside and out
(Do de daah)
Oh I trusted you
New world age
Dah, de daah
Dah, de
Try again, feels defeated
(Defeated)
Once again won't be depleted
You'll survive true survivor, a Darwin star, yeeah
Turn the key, let me out gently
Into the light, I walk eagerly
I breathe in, I surrender
And I'm not afraid
Dah, de daah
(Dah, de daah)
Yes I trusted you
Do de daah
(Do de daah)
Yes I trusted you
Inside and out
(Do de daah)
Oh I trusted you
New world age
I am, now ready to fly away
Give away, gave away
Sometimes life, it gets in the way
Give away, given
Yee yeah
Haa
Yea yea
Nothing to blame
Never has very much to say
Laugh last, laugh longest
I know sometimes life gets in the way
You'll survive, be strongest, yes
We know you are here now

You'll survive, be strongest
