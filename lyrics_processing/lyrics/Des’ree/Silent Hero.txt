First he's got to find his Queen to share his golden throne
He'll know he's met her when their spirits face to face
Then they can rule the world and heal the human race
Because he only wants to be a hero
He's tryin' to fly but his wings won't let him go
He wants to travel but don't wanna go solo
Daddy when I grow up, I want to be a silent hero
Standing by a legacy that wasn't very bad
Chained to a history that wasn't always sad
His mother and his father said that, "Boy you should be glad"
He had pride and respect for everything he had
Because he only wants to be a hero
He's tryin' to fly but his wings won't let him go
He wants to travel but don't wanna go solo
Daddy when I grow up, I want to be a silent hero
Shadows pursue me, confusing my life
Causing me grief, sometimes causing me strife
Enjoy your youth 'cause it doesn't last very long
Do you know the words to your song?
He wants to fly but his wings won't let him go
He wants to travel but don't wanna go solo
Daddy when I grow up, I want to be a silent hero
He only wants to be, wants to be a hero
He's tryin' to fly but his wings won't let him go
He wants to travel but don't wanna go solo
Daddy when I grow up, I want to be a silent hero
Daddy when I grow up, I want to be a silent hero
Daddy when I grow up, I want to be a silent hero
Daddy when I grow up, I want to be a silent hero
Daddy when I grow up, I want to be a silent hero
Daddy when I grow up, I want to be a silent hero
I be a hero, you be a hero
She stand a hero, he stand a hero
(I be a hero)
I am a hero, you are a hero
(You be a hero)
