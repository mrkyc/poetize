I tried to run away
Somehow I couldn't stay
You reached to hold my hand
You led me to the promised land
There we were all alone
There are no danger zones
We only had each other's eyes
And I feel now
They were the best days of my life
Hey yeah, yeah
Where did you find this place?
Had we arrived in space?
Here we are kings and queens
You know exactly what I mean
Now we are all alone
There were no telephones
We only have each other's smiles
And I feel now
They were the best days of my life
Hey yeah, yeah
Yes, I feel now
They were the best days of my life
The astonishment, written on my face
As the beauty, it happy dazed
Of the scenery, I was so impressed
By the way the paradise was smartly dressed
Hey yeah, yeah
Hey yeah, yeah
I tried to disappear
From all my aches and fears
But now I close my eyes and journey
To this paradise
So beautiful, simply wonderful
I sit down and take my time, ohh ho
And I feel now
They were the best days of
Yes, I know now
They were the best days of
I'm convinced now
They were the best days of my life
