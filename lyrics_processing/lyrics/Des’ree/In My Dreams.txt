I was your Queen you were the Captain of my sea
We felt we were the only ones to see
Mermaids combing their hair with coral brushes from the sea
In my dreams you were food and wine
In my dreams we had space and time
In my dreams baby we could fly
In my dreams you'll never die
Sweet, sweet music, we made our own
The tree in our garden was our surrogate home
We drank blue lemonade and ate mud pies
We owned the land, oh yes we owned the sky
In my dreams you were food and wine
In my dreams we had space and time
In my dreams baby we could fly
In my dreams you'll never die
Can you believe every secret I had
I shared with you, yes with you
Always always in our games
I took the blame for you?
In my dreams you were food and wine
In my dreams we had space and time
In my dreams baby we could fly
In my dreams you'll never die
In my dreams you were food and wine
In my dreams we had space and time
In my dreams baby we could fly
In my dreams you'll never die
Can you believe every secret I had
I shared with you, yes with you
Always always in our games
I took the blame for you, yes for you?
In my dreams you were food and wine
In my dreams we had space and time
In my dreams baby we could fly
In my dreams you'll never die
In my dreams you were food and wine
In my dreams we had space and time
In my dreams baby we could fly
In my dreams you'll never die
In my dreams you were food and wine
In my dreams we had space and time
In my dreams baby we could fly
Never die, never die
In my dreams you were food and wine
In my dreams we had space and time
In my dreams baby we could fly
Never die, you'll never die
In my dreams you were food and wine
In my dreams we had space and time
In my dreams baby we could fly
