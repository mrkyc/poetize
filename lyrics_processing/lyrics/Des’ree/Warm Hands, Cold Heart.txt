Asking for directions to a good time
Dashing was his smile, responded I instinctively
Accept the invitation for a while
I couldn't get away, I sipped the wine, I wanted more
He was psychological addiction, I bowed my head to pray
But the devil said, "Girl, stay and play"
I was so exposed, had no protection
He had warm hands, cold heart, tryin' to love and tryin' to please
With charm, a head start, almost brought me to my knees
Warm hands, cold heart, tryin' to love a better day
Almost spirited me away
My will left home, packed its bags and flew away
Dashing was my succor, was my weakness
I was so alone, would have stayed that way a thousand days
I enjoyed his bitter, not his sweetness
He had warm hands, cold heart, tryin' to love and tryin' to please
With charm, a head start, almost brought me to my knees
Warm hands, cold heart, tryin' to love a better day
Almost spirited me away
He was messin' with my psyche, he was playin' with my mind
Adventure and excitement can be hard to find
But the pleasure in the danger was so intoxicating
I had to break away, yeah, yeah, yeah
Warm hands, cold heart
With charm, head start
Warm hands, cold heart
With charm, head start
He had warm hands, cold heart, tryin' to love and tryin' to please
With charm, a head start, almost brought me to my knees
Warm hands, cold heart, tryin' to love a better day
Almost spirited me away
Warm hands, cold heart
With charm, head start
Warm hands, cold heart
He was psychological addiction
He had warm hands, cold heart, tryin' to love and tryin' to please
With charm, a head start, almost brought me to my knees
Warm hands, cold heart, tryin' to love a better day
Almost spirited me away
Warm hands, cold heart
With charm, head start
Warm hands, cold heart
Warm hands, cold heart
