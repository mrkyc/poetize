But the message don't get much better
Always competing with someone else, beating up on yourself
Deep inside you've always had this dream
Crazy as it sometimes seems
Always thinking up some excuse, you just need some juice
It Doesn't matter, if your black or white
Doesn't matter if your wrong or right
All that matters, don't give up the fight
Doesn't matter if your rich or poor
All that matter's is you know the score
Doesn't matter, you can open any door
Never listen but you wanna teach
Do you practice what you always preach
Take a deeper look inside yourself
Before you look at someone else
Please don't rush, take your time
Challenges are hard to climb
Before you think of hanging up your boots
Just sip on some juice
It Doesn't matter, if your black or white
Doesn't matter if your wrong or right
All that matters, don't give up the fight
Doesn't matter if your rich or poor
All that matter's is you know the score
Doesn't matter, you can open any door
You might also likeCos in life we only get one chance
We gotta live it up, we gotta do it right
If you wanna dance the last dance
Then you gotta be prepared to fight
There's no point in having dreams
If your gonna spend your life asleep
Really there is no excuse. You just need some juice
It Doesn't matter, if your black or white
Doesn't matter if your wrong or right
All that matters, don't give up the fight
Doesn't matter if your rich or poor
All that matter's is you know the score
Doesn't matter, you can open any door
It doesn't matter, oh no
Doesn't matter, oh no
Doesn't matter
It doesn't matter, oh no
It Doesn't matter, if your black or white
Doesn't matter if your wrong or right
All that matters, don't give up the fight
Doesn't matter if your rich or poor
All that matter's is you know the score
