Ten letters behind his name
Born up in the cornfields
Tafari doesn't know the game
The game is no respect for life
Even less for rules
Winners only need apply
Sorry no rooms for fools
Tafari, looks up to the stars and
Wonders if there's life on Mars
Some say, he should shave his head
But he's proud to be a dread
'Cos, I'll be better, I'll be stronger
For the truth, I know takes longer
I've the cunning of the tiger
And the Wisdom of the trees
I won't be sad, refuse the sorrow
I look forward to tomorrow
I'll release my anger
'Cos I'm proud to be a dread
Selassie, tries to find a home
To rest his weary head
A place where he can take his girl
To share this spiritual bed
When he's greeted at the door
The sign has changed his tune
Though the queen is full of child
Sorry, there's no room
Selassie looks up to the clouds
He curses hard and shouts out loud
Remembering his father's words
A whisper from the dead
'Cos, I'll be better, I'll be stronger
For the truth, I know takes longer
I've the cunning of the tiger
And the wisdom of the trees
I won't be sad, refuse the sorrow
I look forward to tomorrow
I'll release my anger
'Cos I'm proud to be a dread
'Cos in this life, you have to take a chance
Why else live at all
'Cos in this life, to climb a mountain
Sometimes expect to fall
'Cos in this life nothing comes easy
If it does, it has a price
'Cos in this life a martyr suffers
Look at Jesus Christ
Leo, faces many trials
But hold hid head up high
He won't allow the hatred
To Make his spirit cry
Leo looks up to the moon
Sitting in its silver spoon
Maybe I should change my job
Be an astronaut instead
'Cos, I'll be better, I'll be stronger
For the truth, I know takes longer
I've the cunning of the tiger
And the wisdom of the trees
I won't be sad, refuse the sorrow
I look forward to tomorrow
I'll release my anger
'Cos I'm proud to be a dread
I'll release my anger
'Cos I'm proud to be a dread
'Cos, I'll be better, I'll be stronger
For the truth, I'll be a seeker
I've the cunning of the tiger
And the wisdom of the trees
In my dealings I'll be honest
