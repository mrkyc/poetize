Sit beside me, make me laugh some more, yea
We're all looking for a savior
I can see one coming through the door
To the light, are you a follower?
For the truth and for the destiny
This long night has lasted forever
How do we get there?
God only knows
In the darkness, he sits shedding skins
How it happened? He doesn't know
Was it karma stuff and baggage from another life?
Why did it take her, why did she have to go?
To the light, are you a follower?
For the truth and for the destiny
This long night has lasted forever
How do we get there?
God only knows
There I go thinkin' again of you
There I go thinkin' again
There I go thinkin' again
Thinkin' again
I go thinkin' again
I go thinkin' again
I go thinkin' again
I thinkin' again
Where are you going? Are you having fun?
What's the lessons, what we got to learn?
Can't be right, 'cause I'm the dancer
I wrote the steps and I know how it goes
To the light, are you a follower?
For the truth and for the destiny
This long night has lasted forever
How do we get there?
God only knows
To the light, are you a follower?
For the truth and for the destiny
This long night has lasted forever
How do we get there?
God only knows
To the light, are you a follower?
For the truth and for the destiny
This long night has lasted forever
How do we get there?
God only knows
Thinking, there I go again
Thinking, I go thinking
Thinking, there I go again
Thinking, I go thinking
Thinking, there I go again
Thinking, I go thinking
Thinking, there I go again
Thinking, I go thinking
Thinking, there I go again
Thinking, I go thinking
Thinking, there I go again
