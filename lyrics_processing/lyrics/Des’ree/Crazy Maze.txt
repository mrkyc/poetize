Money don't make my world go 'round
I'm reaching up for the higher ground
To a warm and peaceful place
I can rest my weary face
Life's answers we're trying to find
(Oh we're tryin' to find, yes we're tryin' to find)
Battling inside our minds
Where do I go from here?
Will all my friends be there?

'Cause we're livin', we're livin' in a crazy maze
And we're fighting, we're fighting to rise above the haze
Light's at the end of the tunnel
Sometimes the journey is long
There are many theories
On who's right and who's wrong

Pressure is on I have to choose
I've got nothing to lose
I close my eyes I take a chance
I-I-I-I know there's different days
What's the key to a happy life?
Tell me no, no, no, no
A healthy mind and lots of spice
Running barefoot through the trees
That's my idea of free

'Cause we're livin', we're livin' in a crazy maze
And we're fighting, we're fighting to rise above the haze
Light's at the end of the tunnel
Sometimes the journey is long
There are many theories
On who's right and who's wrong

I've packed my bags, I'm on my way
I don't know where I'm going to stay
I'm on a train bound destiny
I can set my spirit free

'Cause we're livin', we're livin' in a crazy maze
And we're fighting, we're fighting to rise above the haze
Light's at the end of the tunnel
Sometimes the journey is long
There are many theories
On who's right and who's wrong
'Cause we're livin', yes, we're livin' in a crazy maze
We're fighting, we're fighting to rise above the haze
Light's at the end of the tunnel
The journey may be long
There are many theories
On who's right and who's wrong
'Cause we're livin', yes, we're livin' in a crazy maze
And we're fighting, we're fighting to rise above the haze
Light's at the end of the tunnel
The journey may be long
There are many theories
On who's right and who's wrong
'Cause we're livin', oh, we're livin'
We're dying, yes, we're dying
The journey may be long
Who's to know
When you have got to go
You got to know
We're livin', yes, we're livin' in a crazy maze
