Why do you keep on fleeting away?
I hear the wind chimes jangle in my mind
Oh how I wish you stay
Look at the time, it's after five, soon the day is over
Mr.Magic said,"We'd meet before the rise"
I recall when 60 minutes used to be an hour
As usual I find myself reading sky
"Never mind", I said to myself
Never, never mind, I'm not owned by myself
Many have these feelings, they remain on the shelf
How can I be sure?
Time oh time, yes I need more time
Why do you keep on fleeting away?
I hear the wind chimes jangle in my mind
Oh how I wish you could stay
Sitting around I hear no sound, only the clock is ticking
Seconds turn to minutes purely on their own
When asleep and all is dark, I spend my dreaming wishing
I got a feeling I'm not all alone
Time oh time, yes I need more time
Why do you keep on fleeting away?
I hear the wind chimes jangle in my mind
Oh how I wish you will stay
Got a feeling, yes I'm reeling
I'm trying but I'm lying to myself
When I'm sitting and I'm thinking
How can I be sure?
How can I be sure?
Oh, time oh time, yes I need more time
Why do you keep on slipping away?
Time oh time, umpteens I have to time
Oh how I wish you will stay
Time oh time, yes I need more time
Why do you keep on slipping away?
I hear the wind chimes jangle in my mind
Oh how I wish you will stay
Oh, time oh time, what can I do?
I find myself, I'm relying on you sometimes
I get in right, I follow through
Yea yea yea yea
Yea yea
