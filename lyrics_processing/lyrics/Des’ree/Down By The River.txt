Down by the water will you come with me?
The fish are watching, I don't really care
Down by the river if you dare
Down by the river, down by the stream
Down by the ripples, promise I won't scream, oh
The flowers are whispering, what do they say?
Down by the river where we play
I can see the magic in your eyes
Down by the river, down by the shore
Down by the ocean where we wanted more, oh
The trees are listening, they turn away
Down by the river where we lay
I can see the magic in your eyes, baby
I can feel the sunlight in your smile
Maybe I could deceive myself
But why should I deny that you belong to me, I belong to you oh
I can feel the magic in your eyes, baby
I can see the sunlight from your smile
Maybe I could deceive myself
But why should I deny that you belong to me, I belong to you, you
Yea yea yea, yea yea yea, yea yea yea
Down by the river, down by the lake
Down by the water, promise I won't fake, hey hey
Sun is shining in its heat we bathe
Down by the river we were saved
I can see the magic in your eyes, baby
I can feel the sunlight in your smile
I could deceive myself
But why should I deny that you belong to me, I belong to you oh
You belong to me, I belong to you, you, yea yea
Yea yea yea
Down by the river, yea yea
Down by the river, yea yea yea yea yea
Down by the river, yea
Down by the river, yea yea yea yea yea
Down by the river, yea yea yea yea
Down by the river, yea yea yea yea
Down by the river, yea yea
Down by the river, ooo yea
Down by the river, deep down, deep down
