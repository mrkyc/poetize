Oh oh, yeah, hmm
La, da, da, da

Don't get me wrong, I love who I am
I don't wanna be ungrateful
It probably sounds strange
I really love the role I play, the songs I sing
But with all the fame
The things that seemed so simple
Are suddenly so far out of reach
I wish that they could see that underneath

I'm just an ordinary girl
Sometimes I'm lazy, I get bored
I get scared, I feel ignored
I feel happy, I get silly
I choke on my own words
I make wishes, I have dreams
And I still want to believe
Anything can happen in this world
For an ordinary girl
Like you, like me
For an ordinary girl
Like you, like me
You might also like
How are you?
Hello, goodbye
One day here, one day there
And again it's time to go
Miss Popular, always on the road
Put my best foot forward
Gotta get on with the show
Strike a pose for the front cover of a magazine
Everywhere I arrive, I get high-fives
They paint me larger than life (Yeah)

I'm just an ordinary girl
Sometimes I'm lazy, I get bored
I get scared, I feel ignored (Yeah)
I feel happy, I get silly
I choke on my own words
I make wishes, I have dreams
And I still want to believe
Anything can happen in this world
For an ordinary girl

So give it everything or nothing at all
And get back on your feet
When you stumble and fall
A little luck can go a long way
So don't you worry about what people say
Who knows when the wind may blow
For an ordinary girl, hmm
I'm just an ordinary girl
Sometimes I'm lazy, I get bored
I get scared, I feel ignored
I feel happy, I get silly
I choke on my own words
I make wishes, I have dreams
And I still want to believe
Anything can happen in this world
For an ordinary girl
Like you, like me, yeah
For an ordinary girl
Like you, like me

For an ordinary girl
Mmm, for an ordinary girl
