We haven't met, and that's okay
'Cause you will be askin' for me one day
Don't wanna wait in line
The moment is mine, believe me

Don't close your eyes
'Cause it's a chance worth takin'
And I think that I can shake you

I know where I stand, I know who I am
I would never run away when life gets bad
It's everything I see, every part of me
Gonna get what I deserve
I got nerve (I got, I got, I got)

Electrified, I'm on a wire
Gettin' together and we're on fire
What I said, you heard
Now I got you spinnin'

Don't close your mind
The words I use are open
And I think that I can show you
You might also like
I know where I stand, I know who I am
I would never run away when life gets bad
It's everything I see, every part of me
I know I can change the world, yeah, yeah, yeah (I know)
I know what you like, I know what you think
Not afraid to stare you down until you blink
It's everything I see, every part of me
Gonna get what I deserve
I got nerve

You (You), you need to discover (to discover)
Who can make you feel free
And I, I need to uncover
The part of you that's reachin' out for me, hey

I know where I stand, I know who I am
I would never run away, when life gets bad
It's everything I see, every part of me
I know I can change the world, yeah, yeah, yeah
I know what you like, I know what you think
Not afraid to stare you down until you blink
It's everything I see, every part of me
Gonna get what I deserve
I got nerve
(I'm what you want)
Yeah, yeah, yeah (I'm what you need)
I got nerve (I'm what you want, I'm what you need)
I know what you like, I know what you think
Not afraid to stare you down until you blink
It's everything I see, every part of me
Gonna get what I deserve
