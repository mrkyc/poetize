Everybody makes mistakes
Everybody has those days
One, two, three, four!

Everybody makes mistakes
Everybody has those days (Oh yeah)
Everybody knows what, what I'm talkin' 'bout
Everybody gets that way (That's right)
Everybody makes mistakes (Uh huh)
Everybody has those days
Everybody knows what, what I'm talkin' 'bout
Everybody gets that way, yeah

Sometimes I'm in a jam, I've gotta make a plan
It might be crazy, I do it anyway
No way to know for sure, I figure out a cure
I'm patching up the holes, but then it overflows

If I'm not doing too well
Why be so hard on myself?

Nobody's perfect, I gotta work it
Again and again, 'til I get it right
Nobody's perfect, you live and you learn it
And if I mess it up sometimes (hey)
Nobody's perfect
You might also like
Sometimes I work a scheme, but then it flips on me
Doesn't turn out how I planned, gets stuck in quicksand
But no problem can't be solved once I get involved
I try to be delicate, then crash right into it

But my intentions are good (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Sometimes just misunderstood

Nobody's perfect, I gotta work it (Work it)
Again and again, 'til I get it right (That's right)
Nobody's perfect, you live and you learn it
And if I mess it up sometimes (Oh)
Nobody's perfect, I gotta work it (C'mon)
I know in time I'll find a way (Oh)
Nobody's perfect

Sometimes I fix things up, and they fall apart again
(Nobody's perfect)
I might mix things up, but I always get it right in the end
(You know I do)

Next time you feel like it's just one of those days
When you just can't seem to win
If things don't turn out the way you planned
Figure something else out, don't stay down, try again
Yeah
Everybody makes mistakes
Everybody has those days (That's right)
Everybody knows what, what I'm talkin' 'bout
Everybody gets that way
Everybody makes mistakes  (Here we go)
Everybody has those days (Uh huh)
Everybody knows what, what I'm talkin' 'bout
Everybody gets that way

Nobody's perfect, I gotta work it (Work it)
Again and again, 'til I get it right
Nobody's perfect, you live and you learn it
And if I mess it up sometimes
Oh, nobody's perfect, I gotta work it
I know in time I'll find a way
Nobody's perfect, you live and you learn it
'Cause everybody makes mistakes (Oh)
Nobody's perfect (Nobody's perfect)

No, no
