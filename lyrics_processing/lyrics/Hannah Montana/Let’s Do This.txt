I rode all night on a big old bus
You came a long way to be with us
You pay good money to see a show
Yeah, let us get ready because here we go
Get on your feet because I am plugged in
So c'mon, let us do this

I turn it on, I crank it up
I will show you all what I am made of
I will get loud, I will wear it out
I will bring the roof in this house down
I know just what you came here for
And I want to hear you scream this more
Get on your feet, you know you cannot resist
Yeah, let us do this
(Na-na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na-na)
Let's do this
(Na-na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na-na)

Got all this work but I am payed to play
And the real party starts backstage
And all my friends, they sing my song
I wish you all could come along
To take a picture to show your friends
So c'mon, let us do this
You might also like
I turn it on, I crank it up
I will show you all what I am made of
I will get loud, I will wear it out
I will bring the roof in this house down
I know just what you came here for
And I want to hear you scream this more
Get on your feet, you know you cannot resist
Yeah, let us do this
(Na-na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na-na)
Let's do this
(Na-na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na-na)

Everybody, c'mon, now is the time to get loud
Throw your hands up, let me hear you shout it out
All my people, let me see you jumping up and down
Let me hear the words, you know you know 'em, sing it out
Freak out, scream, shout
This is what it is all about
Let me hear the hook now

I turn it on, I crank it up
I will show you all what I am made of
I will get loud, I will wear it out
I will bring the roof in this house down
I know just what you came here for
And I want to hear you scream this more
Get on your feet, you know you cannot resist
Yeah, let us do this
(Na-na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na-na)
