You walk away from me tonight
Not knowing the real me
'Cause you believe in all the hype
I just stepped out of a magazine

Take away the glamour, the world that is show
And forget everything you know
Take away the mirrors, the limos, the lights
'Cause I don't wanna dress up tonight

I'm gonna put on my old blue jeans
Gonna walk out of here and into the street
Would you put up resistance?
Would it make a difference?
Would you know the real me?
Me in my old blue jeans

You think I'm unapproachable
That I don't feel enough
Should read a book cover to cover
And not be so quick to judge
You might also like
Take away the glamour, the makeup, the clothes
And forget everything you know
Take away the ego, the trick of the light
'Cause I don't wanna dress up tonight

I'm gonna put on my old blue jeans
Gonna walk out here into the street
Would you put up resistance?
Would it make a difference?
Would you know the real me?
Me in my old blue jeans
I'm gonna put on my old blue jeans
Gonna walk out here into the street
Would you put up resistance?
Would it make a difference?
Would you know the real me?
Me in my old blue jeans

I wanna show you what you get

I'm gonna put on my old blue jeans
Gonna walk out here into the street
Would you put up resistance?
Would it make a difference?
Would you know the real me?
Me in my old
I'm gonna put on my old blue jeans
Gonna walk out here into the street
Would you put up resistance?
Would it make a difference?
Would you know the real me?
Me in my old blue jeans
I'm gonna put on my old blue jeans
Gonna walk out here into the street
Would you put up resistance?
Would it make a difference?
Would you know the real me?
