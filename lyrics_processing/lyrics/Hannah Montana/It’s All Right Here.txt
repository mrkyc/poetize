Why would you rather be anywhere else with me?
I tell you man, it's all right here
(Wherever we are, wherever we are)
Check out the scenery
We won the lottery
I tell you man, it's all right here
And I can't believe you'd even think
Of being any place, any place but right here
The grass may be greener in the end, I swear
But you'll be wishing you were here if you were there
It's wherever we go

(Wherever we are, wherever we are
Wherever we are, wherever we are
It's all right here)
Excuse me officer!

If you're smart
You know you wanna be in the mix of white hot energy
It's all to welcome you
Time so good, it's moving way too fast
If we could, I know we'd make it last
It's all here for you, it's all here for you, it's all here for you
It's all right here

(Wherever we are, wherever we are
Wherever we are, wherever we are
It's all right here)
It's all right here
It's all right here
(Wherever we are, wherever we are
Wherever we are, wherever we are)
C'mon
C'mon, let us go
It's all right here

Any open road (any open road) will take us anywhere
And as long as I am with you, I won't care where
And we can choose the desert or the sea
'Cause the good times are in front of you and me

Why would you rather be anywhere else with me?

Of being any place, any place but right here
The grass may be greener in the end, I swear
But you'll be wishing you were here if you were there
You wish you were here
You wish you were here
And if I could make you want to stay just one more day
Maybe everything would be okay
C'mon
Oh, c'mon
Oh, c'mon

It's all right here
(Wherever we are, wherever we are
Wherever we are, wherever we are
It's all right here)
It's all right here
(Wherever we are, wherever we are
Wherever we are, wherever we are
