It's easy to feel like you're all alone
To feel like nobody knows
The great that you are, the good that's inside you
Is trying so hard to break through

Maybe it is your time to lift off and fly
You won't know if you never try
I will be there with you all of the way
You'll be fine

Don't let anyone tell you that you're not strong enough
Don't give up, there's nothing wrong with just being yourself
That's more than enough
So come on and raise your voice
Speak your mind and make some noise
And sing-  hey, hey!
Make some noise - hey, hey, yeah!

You want to be known, you want to be heard
And know you are beautiful
You have so much to give, some change you wanna live
So shout it out and let it show
You might also like
You have a diamond inside of your heart
A light that shines bright as the stars
Don't be afraid to be all that you are
You'll be fine

Don't let anyone tell you that you're not strong enough
Don't give up, there's nothing wrong with just being yourself
That's more than enough
So come on and raise your voice
Speak your mind and make some noise
And sing-  hey, hey!
Make some noise - hey, hey, yeah!

You can't just sit back and watch the world change
It matters what you have got to say
There is no one else who can stand in your place
So come on, it's never too late

Maybe it is your time to lift off and fly
You would not know if you never try

Don't let anyone tell you that you're not strong enough
Don't give up, there's nothing wrong with just being yourself
That's more than enough
So come on and raise your voice
Speak your mind and make some noise
And sing-  hey, hey!
Make some noise - hey, hey yeah!
Hey, hey! - Make some noise
Speak your mind and make some noise
And sing - hey yeah, hey yeah, hey yeah
Make some noise
Hey yeah, hey yeah, hey yeah
Make some noise
Hey yeah, hey yeah, hey yeah
Make some noise
Hey yeah, hey yeah, hey yeah
