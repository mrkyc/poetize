The other side (The other side), the other side (The other side)
The other side of me (Side of me)

By day, I play the part in every way
Of simple, sweet, calm and collected
Pretend, to my friends, I'm a chameleon
Can make a girl feel disconnected

Feel like a star, a superhero
Sometimes it's hard to separate
(Got too much on my plate)

If you could see the other side of me
I'm just like anybody else, can't you tell?
I hold the key (The key) to both realities
The girl that I want you to know, if only I could show
The other side (The other side), the other side (The other side)
I want you to see (Oh)
The other side (The other side), the other side (The other side)
The other side of me (Woo!)

Inside (Inside), I try to make the pieces fit right
A jigsaw puzzle everywhere
'Cause I flip (I flip) the script (The script)
So many times I forget (Oh)
Who's on stage, who's in the mirror
You might also like
Back in the spotlight, the crowd is calling
The paparazzi and the fame
(It can drive a girl insane)

If you could see the other side of me
I'm just like anybody else, can't you tell?
I hold the key to both realities
The girl that I want you to know, if only I could show
The other side (The other side), the other side (The other side)
I want you to see
The other side (The other side), the other side (The other side)
The other side of me

Down inside, I'm not that different
Like everyone, I have a dream (Have a dream)
Don't wanna hide, just wanna fit in
Sometimes it's harder than it seems

If you could see the other side of me
I'm just like anybody else, can't you tell?
I hold the key to both realities (Oh)
The girl that I want you to know
If you could see (C'mon)
The other side of me (The other side of me)
I'm just like (Just like) anybody else, can't you tell?
I hold the key (The key) to both realities (Both realities)
The girl that I want you to know, if only I could show (Yeah)
The other side (The other side), the other side (The other side)
I want you to see (Yeah)
The other side (The other side), the other side (The other side)
The other side of me

The other side (The other side), the other side (The other side)
I want you to see (Oh)
The other side (The other side)
