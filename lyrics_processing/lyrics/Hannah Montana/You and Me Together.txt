Looks like we found ourselves up against a wall
In need of a little help, but no one wants to call
After all we've been through
Should we let our friendship end?
You need me and I need you
No, we will not break
Never break
But even if we bend

Yeah, it's you and me together (Together, together, together)
Yeah, I'm always on your side (On your side)
No one, no one, no one can ever change it
C'mon, let 'em try (Let 'em try)
'Cause it's you (It's you) and me together now

Anyone can have the day when their heart is on their sleeve
No one wants to see it our way
Can agree to disagree
You think it'd be easier
But it feels like you just can't win
But somehow we'll make it work
'Cause we deserve it
You know we're worth it
You can't give up on friends
You might also like
Cause, it's you and me together (Together, together, together)
Yeah, I'm always on your side (On your side)
No one, no one, no one can ever change it
C'mon, let 'em try (C'mon let 'em try)
'Cause it's you (It's you) and me together now

Now (Oh, now, now, now)

It's you and me (And me) and me together (Together, together)
Yeah, I'm always (I'm always) on your side
On your, on your side
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh

No one, no one, no one can ever change it
C'mon, let 'em try (C'mon, let 'em try)
It's you and me (And me) and me together (Together, together)
Yeah, I'm always on your side (On your side, I'm on your side)
No one, no one, no one can ever change it
C'mon, let 'em try (C'mon, let 'em try)
Cause it's you and me together now
(Together now!) Now
