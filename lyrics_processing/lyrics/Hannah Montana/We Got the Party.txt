Come on guys, tell me what we're doing
We're hanging 'round, when we could be all over the place
The sun is shining, just the way we like it
Let's get out of this hallway, show the world our face

It's Friday, but there's nowhere to go
Anywhere is cool, but we're not going home
And we could do anything we wanna do
It's all up to me and you

Turn this park into a club
The stars are lights and the moon is the vibe from above
Skateboard, here's our ride, so pull on up
Everyone is waiting for us
Anywhere we are, anywhere we go
Everybody knows we got the party with us
Anywhere we are, anywhere we go
Everybody knows we got the party with us
We got the party with us
We got the party with us

Radio, let me be a DJ
I'll turn you up, keep us moving 'til we're on a roll
Everyone is dancing to their own beat and letting go
Everybody here's got a soul
You might also like
It's Friday, and there's nowhere to be
We're kicking it together, it's so good to be free
We got each other, and that's all we need
The rest is up to you and me

Turn this park into a club
The stars are lights and the moon is the vibe from above
Skateboard, here's our ride, so pull on up
Everyone is waiting for us
Anywhere we are, anywhere we go
Everybody knows we got the party with us
Anywhere we are, anywhere we go
Everybody knows we got the party with us

We got the party with us
We got the party, we got the party

Life is for dreamers and I'm a believer
That nothing can stand in our way today
Let's find a place to play, yeah

Turn this park into a club
The stars are lights and the moon is the vibe from above
Skateboard, here's our ride, so pull on up
Everyone is waiting for us
Anywhere we are, anywhere we go
Everybody knows we got the party with us
Anywhere we are, anywhere we go
Everybody knows we got the party with us
Turn this park into a club
The stars are lights and the moon is the vibe from above
Skateboard, here's our ride, so pull on up
Everyone is waiting for us
Anywhere we are, anywhere we go
Everybody knows we got the party with us
Anywhere we are, anywhere we go
Everybody knows we got the party with us
We got the party, we got the party, we got the party
We got the party with us
