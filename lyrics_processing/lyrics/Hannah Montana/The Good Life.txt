I tell you what we're gonna do
What you need to know
What you've gotta get to get where you wanna go
Never ever miss an aisle
Keep your eye on all displays
When you find your style, every day's a holiday

I'll show you how to work it
To find the fit that's perfect
You know that you deserve it
Whoa, whoa, whoa

This is the good life
Take a good look, have anything you want
This is the good life
Dining with your friends at the fancy restaurants
Living the good life, we have such a good time, I know

Grab a little Gucci bag and some Prada shoes
(Here) Take my credit card, they're all here to wait on you
Jimmy Choo calls out your name, D&G on every wall
When you can't decide, that's okay, just buy them all
You might also like
There's no better feeling
There's nothing more appealing
Couture from floor to ceiling
Whoa, whoa, whoa

This is the good life
Take a good look, have anything you want
This is the good life
Dining with your friends at the fancy restaurants
Living the good life, we have such a good time, I know

Can't be slow, never stop
Fill those bags up to the top
Turn around, try it on
Now off to the hair salon
Don't needs sales, I'll just pay
There's no need for layaway
Slide your plastic, flash your cash
Ring it up, it's such a blast
(One, two, three, four)

This is the good life
Take a good look, have anything you want
This is the good life
Dining with your friends at the fancy restaurants
Living the good life, we have such a good time, I know
Oh-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh, the good life
Oh-oh, whoa-oh, whoa, I'm living the good life
Oh-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh, oh, the good life (good life)
Oh-oh, whoa-oh, whoa, I'm living the good life
