When I feel all alone and nobody knows
Still gotta smile for a while, I can't let it show
Dry my tears (Dry my tears)
Hide my fears (Hide my fears)
And when I'm (And when I'm) backstage
Feeling down and the lights come on
No time to worry
Gotta hurry, gotta sing my song
Gotta shake it off (Shake it off)
And strike a pose (Strike a pose, here I go)

Snap my fingers just like that
Don't get what I want and that's a fact
Snap my fingers just like that
Don't get what I want just 'cause I want it
(Just 'cause I want it)

I'm super cool, super hot, living like a rockstar
You think I'm super, you think I'm super
On the cover of your magazines
Wherever I go they make a scene
I'm super, super, I'm super duper
So you want to be just like
So you want to be just like
Think you want to be just like me?
Everybody's watching me
It's never as easy as it seems
To be super, super, to be super, Supergirl
You might also like
When I walk in the room, everybody stops
Cameras flashing, people fighting for the best shot
They like my hair (They like my hair)
The clothes I wear (The clothes I wear)
Everybody wants to know what I'm doing next
Sometimes I wish I could stay home, just be by myself
I wanna be (I wanna be)
More carefree (More carefree), can't you see?

Snap my fingers just like that
Don't get what I want and that's a fact
Snap my fingers just like that
Don't get what I want just 'cause I want it
(Just 'cause I want it)

I'm super cool, super hot, living like a rockstar
You think I'm super, you think I'm super
On the cover of your magazines
Wherever I go they make a scene
I'm super, super, I'm super duper
So you want to be just like
So you want to be just like
Think you want to be just like me?
Everybody's watching me
It's never as easy as it seems
To be super, super, to be super, Supergirl
Wish you could see I'm like everybody else
Struggling to let go and always be myself

I'm super cool, super hot (Super)
I'm super, super, super, super
On the cover of your magazines
Wherever I go they make a scene
I'm super, super, I'm super, super
So you want to be just like
So you want to be just like
Think you want to be just like me?
Everybody's watching me
It's never as easy as it seems
