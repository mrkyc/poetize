How did I get here?
Turned around and there you were
I didn't think twice or rationalize
'Cause somehow I knew
That there was more than just chemistry
I mean, I knew you were kind of into me
But I figured it's too good to be true
I said, "Pinch me
Where's the catch this time?"
Can't find a single cloud in the sky
Help me before I get used to this guy

They say that good things take time
But really great things happen in the blink of an eye
Thought the chances to meet somebody like you were a million to one
I cannot believe it
Oh, whoa
You're one in a million

All this time, I was looking for love
Trying to make things work
That weren't good enough
'Til I thought I'm through, said I'm done
And stumbled into the arms of the one
You might also like
You're making me laugh about the silliest stuff
Say that I'm your diamond in the rough
When I'm mad at you, you come with your velvet touch
Can't believe that I'm so lucky
I have never felt so happy
Every time I see that sparkle in your eyes

They say that good things take time (Whoo!)
But really great things happen in the blink of an eye
Thought the chances to meet somebody like you were a million to one
I cannot believe it
Oh, whoa
You're one in a million, yeah, yeah

All this time, I was looking for love
Trying to make things work
That weren't good enough
'Til I thought I'm through, said I'm done
And stumbled into the arms, of the one

I said, "Pinch me
Where's the catch this time?"
Can't find a single cloud in the sky
Help me before I get used to this guy

But really great things happen in the blink of an eye

You're one in a million
Yeah, you're one in a million
