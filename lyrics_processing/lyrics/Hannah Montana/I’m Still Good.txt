So I might slip again, let it in now and then
That won't mean anything, I'm still good

I look around me
How did I get here?
Not part of my plan
I ended up in a situation
Wasn't in my hands

I think about it when I want to give up
How to keep on going, how to keep my chin up
Somehow I know it, I'm not gonna give up
Never gonna give up

So I might slip again, let it in now and then
That won't mean anything, I'm still good
Trying to be my best, when I fall in some mess
Pick myself up again, I'm still good
I'm still good
I'm still good

When days are like that and I can shake 'em
It's weighing on my mind
So I'm just saying, I'm only human
Life gets you down sometimes
You might also like
I think about it when I want to give up
How to keep on going, how to keep my chin up
Somehow I know it, I'm not gonna give up
Never gonna give up

So I might slip again, let it in now and then
That won't mean anything, I'm still good
Trying to be my best, when I fall in some mess
Pick myself up again, I'm still good
So I might slip again, let it in now and then
That won't mean anything, I'm still good
Trying to be my best, when I fall in some mess
Pick myself up again, I'm still good

Life puts up a fight with me
But I can take on anything
I'm gonna make it real, this dream I believe in

I think about it when I want to give up
How to keep on going, how to keep my chin up
Somehow I know it, I'm not gonna give up
Never gonna give up
So I might slip again, let it in now and then
That won't mean anything, I'm still good
Trying to be my best, when I fall in some mess
Pick myself up again, I'm still good
So I might slip again, let it in now and then
That won't mean anything, I'm still good
Trying to be my best, when I fall in some mess
Pick myself up again, I'm still good

I'm still good
Pick myself up again
I'm still good
