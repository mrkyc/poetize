When you are a superstar
They know your name wherever you are
Life is crazy and I like it
Pictures in magazines
Autographs and 90,000 screams
Get the dream and then you live it

Oh, would not you want that too?
Who could blame you?
Oh, 'cause what I say is true, oh yeah

When you are a VIP, you get whatever you please
What's not to like?
The fans screaming your name
All the fortune and fame
What's not to, what's not, what's not to like?

Yeah
Do-do-do-do-do
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
