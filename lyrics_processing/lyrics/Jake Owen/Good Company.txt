We're just back porch sitting
Doing some old school picking
Got some brand new strings on my Gibson
Yeah, I'll play your favorite song

The cooler's down to the last drop
But it won't last that way long
Cause Tommy's making a beer run
So baby, come on

We in good company
Yeah, the only thing missing
Is a pretty girl sitting here next to me
Kissing up on me, and I got a spot waiting on you
So B.Y.O.B, it means bring yourself over, babe
Got what we need to make good vibes, good times
And a damn good memory
We in good company
Yeah, we in good company

Well, the pool's full, come on get in it
Got a hole, throwing bean bags in it
And Robby's painting on the brisket
It's a KC masterpiece

Is a pretty girl sitting here next to me
Kissing up on me, and I got a spot waiting on you
So B.Y.O.B, it means bring yourself over, babe

And a damn good memory

Oh, we in good company

We got them good vibes

Off that good vine
It's a damn good night to be...

In good company
The only thing missing
Is a pretty girl sitting here next to me
Kissing up on me, and I got a spot waiting on you
We in good company
