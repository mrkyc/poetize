It's just an old 88 four door banged out floorboard
A to B, nothing more, never seen a showroom floor
But it'll get heads spinning, as long as you're in it
It could be red dress, blue jeans, tied up two piece
One of my old T's or wrapped up in a sheet
It don't make no difference (looks good)
As long as you're in it
As long as you're in it, girl

So baby, let's ride
Wherever we go, whatever we do
As good as it gets, gets better with you like tonight
There ain't nothin' missing in this life I'm livin'
As long as you're in it

Don't care if it's a dressed up five star cabernet caviar
Or a no cover charge, chair down dive bar
I stay all night sippin', as long as you're in it
Or a creek bank, midnight rope swing moonlight
No trespass sign, double dare, alright (Hell, I'll skinny dip it)
As long as you're in it
As long as you're in it, girl

So baby, let's ride
Wherever we go, whatever we do
As good as it gets, gets better with you like tonight
There ain't nothin' missing in this life I'm livin'
As long as you're in it, yeah

I ain't too sure about the future
But I'm saying it looks bright
If you keep looking at me like you're looking at me tonight
Saying baby, let's ride

Wherever we go, whatever we do
As good as it gets, gets better with you like tonight
There ain't nothin' missing in this life I'm livin'
As long as you're in it
So baby, lets ride
Wherever we go, whatever we do
As good as it gets, gets better with you like tonight
There ain't nothin' missing in this life I'm livin'
As long as you're in it
As long as you're in it
