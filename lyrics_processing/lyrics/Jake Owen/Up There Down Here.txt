I'm more four-letter word than a Sunday prayer
More backroad than a front pew
Ain't always been tight with the man upstairs
And scriptures, I can quote a few
She's a cross on a chain and a red wine stain
On her Mamaw's hand-me-down Bible
"I heart Tennessee", "John 3:16"
On the bumper of a white Chevy Tahoe

She's a little up there, down here
Puts a little King James in my John Deere
Thank the Lord the girl's got my back
Hangs her halo by my Carhartt hat
I'ma raise a little hell, she's Heaven on Earth
The grace to my grit and the rain on my dirt
I'm a little downhome, cold beer
She's a little up there, down here
Amen, amen

She's an FM hymn with her hand in the wind
Little Saint in my shotgun seat
It's like G-O-D heard an SOS
I'm one lucky S.O.B.
Yeah, I could see me and her in a stained-glass church
"Just Married" cans rollin' down the highway
Yeah, when life gets a little bit sideways

She's a little up there, down here
Puts a little King James in my John Deere
Thank the Lord the girl's got my back
Hangs her halo by my Carhartt hat
I'ma raise a little hell, she's Heaven on Earth
The grace to my grit and the rain on my dirt
I'm a little downhome, cold beer
She's a little up there, down here
Amen, amen
Amen, amen

She's a little up there, down here
Puts a little King James in my John Deere
Holy water in my ninety-proof
Little angel in my Red Wing boots

She's a little up there, down here
Puts a little King James in my John Deere
Thank the Lord the girl's got my back
Hangs her halo by my Carhartt hat
I'ma raise a little hell, she's Heaven on Earth
The grace to my grit and the rain on my dirt
I'm a little downhome, cold beer
She's a little up there, down here
I'm a little downhome, cold beer
She's a little up there, down here
Amen, amen
Amen
She's a cross on a chain and a red wine stain (Amen)
