We're all kicking, we're all screaming
We're all sleeping at the wheel
We're all California dreaming
Playing house and paying bills
We're all going through the motions
Just following the script
If we don't stop and smell the ocean
Boys, we might just miss our ship
Every last heart breaks when the summer snapshot fades
Every teenage kiss ends way too soon

It don't matter how long we're here
It's never gonna be long enough
It ain't about the amount of years
It's about the amount of love
It don't matter if you're 18, 45 or 91
We're all waiting for our moment in the sun
Everybody dies young
Oh yeah, everybody dies young

From the moment that we're born
Yeah, we start running out of sand
You can't bargain with the mirror
You can't ever fight the hands of
Time flies by like the Fourth of July sky
When the morning sun high fives the moon

It don't matter how long we're here
It's never gonna be long enough
It ain't about the amount of years
It's about the amount of love
It don't matter if you're 18, 45 or 91
While we're here we oughta have a little fun
Everybody dies young
Oh yeah, everybody dies young

You only get one life, so you gotta live it
You only get one heart, so you better give it
You only get one life, so you gotta live it up
You only get one heart, so you gotta get to giving it up

It don't matter how long we're here
It's never gonna be long enough
It ain't about the amount of years
It's about the amount of love
It don't matter if you're 18, 45 or 91
No matter what we do, we're never done
Everybody dies young
