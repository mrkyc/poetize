Girl, well, I don't know what kind of fool he must be
To think that he could leave you alone
And nobody would be taking you home

Girl, I need to talk to you
'Cause I got a question, it's more like a suggestion
And here's the deal
If he ain't gonna love you
If he ain't gonna love you, I will
Like you've never been loved before
Up against the wall when you walk in the door
Looking like you wanna leave, you want some more
If he ain't gonna love you, I will

Girl, well, it's obvious that something ain't right
Or else you wouldn't be here tonight
And I don't wanna come on too strong
Don't get me wrong

Girl, I need to talk to you
'Cause I got a question, see, it's more like a suggestion
And here's the deal
If he ain't gonna love you
If he ain't gonna love you, I will
Like you've never been loved before
Up against the wall when you walk in the door
Looking like you wanna leave, you want some more
If he ain't gonna love you, I will
Oh, girl, I will

Love you like a lover is supposed to do
If he ain't gonna love you, I will
I will, oh, girl, I will
