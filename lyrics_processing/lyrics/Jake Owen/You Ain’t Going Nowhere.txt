Put a hundred thousand miles on this Bronco
Running, gunning, flying up and down the gulf coast
Climbed a mile-high Colorado rock
Trying to leave our love at the top, at the top, girl
Tried to lose you in a New York city skyline
Rolled you away, Vegas table, let it all ride
I've been going every place there is
To let this love go like you did

I'm going out of my mind, going out on a limb
Going out on the town with all my friends
I tried a new girl, new look, a new town
I didn't get it when you said you'd always stick around
You're out in a crowd in the dark of the night
Saying you'd never leave, you've never been so right
See you in a blue sky, breathe you in the night air
Girl, you're always right there, you ain't going nowhere
You ain't going nowhere

Usually time will patch up all this pain I'm feeling
But I ain't forgetting nothing, I ain't healing
I guess it's true that a heart, it don't break even
I thought you were leaving

Going out on the town with all my friends
I tried a new girl, new look, a new town
I didn't get it when you said you'd always stick around

Saying you'd never leave, you've never been so right
See you in a blue sky, breathe you in the night air
Girl, you're always right there, you ain't going nowhere
You ain't going nowhere

I'm going crazy, baby, I'm going down
It's like we're the last two left in a ghost town

I'm going out of my mind, going out on a limb
Going out on the town with all my friends
I tried a new girl, new look, a new town
I didn't get it when you said you'd always stick around
You're out in a crowd in the dark of the night
Saying you'd never leave, you've never been so right
See you in a blue sky, breathe you in the night air
Girl, you're always right there, you ain't going nowhere
You ain't going nowhere
No, you ain't going nowhere
