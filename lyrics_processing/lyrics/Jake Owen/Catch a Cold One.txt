Colorado cans on the Tennessee water
Nothing really nibblin' on the end of that bobber
Me and my old man's old man just talkin' it up
He said just 'cause you drop a line
Don't mean the fish'll bite

So if it don't rain, talk to the good Lord
If it don't crank, it ain't from Detroit
You want a good song, play an old one
The only good boat is a sold one
Work ain't always done when the day's done
You can't always catch a break or a big one
But you can always catch a cold one

Yeah, I didn't get it then, but I sure do now
It's kinda up to you how it all turns out
Life ain't always pinewood docks and blue skies
Every time I reach down in the ice
I can still hear him from the other side

Sayin' if it don't rain, talk to the good Lord
If it don't crank, it ain't from Detroit
You want a good song, play an old one
The only good boat is a sold one
Work ain't always done when the day's done
You can't always catch a break or a big one
But you can always catch a cold one
Yeah, you can always catch a cold one

If it don't rain, talk to the good Lord
If it don't crank, it ain't from Detroit
You want a good song, play an old one
Any good boat is a sold one
Yeah, if it don't rain, talk to the good Lord
If it don't crank, it ain't from Detroit
You want a good song, play an old one
The only good boat is a sold one
Work ain't always done when the day's done
You can't always catch a break or a big one
But you can always catch a cold one
