I got a house down a back road
I got a flag on the front porch
I got a dog named Waylon
I got a driveway that needs pavin'
I got a boat with a two stroke
A couple guaranteed-to-make-ya-laugh jokes
I got friends in low places
Yeah, life is what you make it

I might not end up in the Hall of Fame
With a star on a sidewalk with my name
Or a statue in my hometown when I'm gone
Nobody gonna name their babies after me
I might not go down in history
But I'll go down to the honky-tonk

I got a girl named Shelia
She goes batshit on tequila
Got a job that gets the job done
I got a loan at the bank, it's a big one
The only place you might see my name
Is on a wall, "For a good time, call"
I'm a local legend on a Friday night
Then a Pabst Blue Ribbon and a neon light

I might not end up in the Hall of Fame
With a star on a sidewalk with my name
Or a statue in my hometown when I'm gone
Nobody gonna name their babies after me
I might not go down in history
But I'll go down to the honky-tonk

I go down to the honky-tonk
I go down to the honky-tonk
I go down, I go down to the honky-tonk
I go down to the honky-tonk
I go down to the honky-tonk
I go down, I go down to the honky-tonk
(Yeah, let's go, come on)

I might not end up in the Hall of Fame
With a star on a sidewalk with my name
Or a statue in my hometown when I'm gone
Nobody gonna name their babies after me
I might not go down in history
But I'll go down to the honky-tonk

I go down to the honky-tonk
I go down to the honky-tonk
I go down, I go down to the honky-tonk
I go down to the honky-tonk
I go down to the honky-tonk
