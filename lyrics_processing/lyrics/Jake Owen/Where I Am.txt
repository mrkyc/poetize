You know this world can drive you crazy sometimes
Get you all tangled up in your mind
Make you wanna just disappear
So when you want to, come over here
I can be the safe that you need
Don't you know you're never bothering me?
You never have to wonder if I'm free
I'm free for you

Girl, you know I'm never more than a call away
Light me up all night, light me up all day
If you wanna hang out, if you wanna get drunk
If you're tripping and you're looking for a place to land
Anytime that you need a little company
If the night's too long, you can run to me
If you wanna be good, if you wanna be bad
If you want it, baby, you know where I am

You know you ain't gotta worry 'bout what you wear
You ain't gotta do a thing to your hair
No, you don't need a map to the stars
Like you don't need a map to my heart
You don't need no reservation cause it's an open invitation
My door ain't ever gonna be locked
No, not for you
