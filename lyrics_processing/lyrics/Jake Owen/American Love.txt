I pick her up about 7 for the football game
My Camaro all painted up in flames
But damn, she was the one that was on fire
She was head-to-toe red, white and blue
That lipstick, tank top, daisy dukes
She had my head spinning faster than them four bald eagle tires

I was all caught up in that American love
Two young hearts, one cool car
And all we wanted to do was park, kiss, smoke, drink
I love this song, baby, what do you think?
She turned it up, windows fogging up
We were living it up, up, up in that American love

I parked the Chevy by the levy on a Friday night
We were naming all the stars up in that sky
And I named the brightest one right after her
And the summer sunset was something to see
With her leaning all up real close to me
And with a six pack, the next thing I knew, we were in the backseat, you know

American love
Two young hearts, one cool car
And all we wanted to do was park, kiss, smoke, drink
I love this song, baby, what do you think?
She turned it up, windows fogging up
We were living it up, up, up in that American love

We were living it up, up, up in that American love
Park, kiss, smoke, drink
