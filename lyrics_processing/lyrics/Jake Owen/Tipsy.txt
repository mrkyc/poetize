You got your hands all over me
You sure making this room spin
Moving your body to the beat
Sure got me feeling
Like I'm losing it
Oh, but girl keep doing it, 'cause

Jack in my coke's got me dizzy dizzy
Radio rocks a little mini pretty ditty
Woah oh it's a Saturday night
She shake it so sweet you got me on a sugar high
And I don't know if it's you or the whiskey
That's got me feeling all tipsy tipsy
I can feel myself about to fall
Every time you kiss me, kiss me
I better lean you up against the wall
I'm tipsy, tipsy

The way you rock that miniskirt
Yea, you turn me right side down
Girl you're making my vision blur
It ain't what I'm sipping got me tripping
Now, girl you're looking so fine tonight
I couldn't walk a straight line tonight 'cause

I was thinking we should just lay down
