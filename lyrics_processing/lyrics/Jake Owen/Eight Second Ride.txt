I said, "Hey girl, what's your name?
Haven't I seen you before?
I recognize them dark green eyes
When you do-si-doed across the floor"
"Are you alone, or are you with someone?"
She said, "As a matter of fact I'm not"
So I took her hand, that's when it all began
And we headed towards the parking lot

And she said, "Hey boy, do you mind
Taking me home tonight?
Because I have not never seen a country boy
With tires on his truck this high"
I said, "Climb on up, but honey watch the cup
That I'm spittting my dip inside
And hold on tight cause it's going to be wilder
Than any eight second ride"

We went riding around rocking to the sound
Of "A Country Boy Can Survive"
And I knew then she was my kind of a girl
Cause she was singing every single line
Then she slid on over put my hand on her shoulder
And I asked her what she wanted to do
She said, "It really don't matter where we go
Just as long as I'm riding with you"

And she said, "Hey boy, do you mind
Taking me home tonight?
Because I am not never seen a country boy
With tires on his truck this high"
I said, "Climb on up, but honey watch the cup
That I'm spittting my dip inside
And hold on tight cause it's going to be wilder
Than any eight second ride"

So we headed out to Old Tobacco Road
Put the tailgate down and we made love
She said "A true country boy is hard to find
But I found one wilder then any eight second ride"

And she said, "Hey boy, do you mind
Taking me home tonight?
Because I am not never seen a country boy
With tires on his truck this high"
I said, "Climb on up, but honey watch the cup
That I'm spittting my dip inside
And hold on tight cause it's going to be wilder
Than any eight second ride"
Yeah, hold on tight because it's going to be wilder
