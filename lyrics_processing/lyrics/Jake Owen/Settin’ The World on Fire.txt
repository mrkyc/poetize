Well that big red sun was sinkin' slow
That rising had a haunting glow
I could see those heat waves rising off the ground
We were sittin'on go at that old stop sign
Headlights shinin' on the county line
It was do or die, had to get out of that town
Well honey, you said run
We were so young

Tryin' to set the world on fire
Turn the key and spark the wire
Chasin' down a feelin' runnin' on desire
The future was an open road
Gone in a cloud of smoke
Leavin' a trail of flames behind those tires
Just you and me girl, settin' the world on fire

Yeah, we were settin' the world on fire
We were blazin' down the road like Kerouac
No time to stop and cover our tracks
We were too damn hot for any one town to hold
Yeah, we burned through a few good years
Then you started looking back in that rear view mirror
Right outside of Reno the trail got cold
You said you'd had enough of this ramblin' love

Tryin' to set the world on fire
Turn the key and spark the wire
Chasin' down a feelin' runnin' on desire
The future was an open road
Gone in a cloud of smoke
Leavin' a trail of flames behind those tires
Just you and me girl, settin' the world on fire
Yeah, we were settin' the world on fire

Pullin' on a lucky strike 'bout to head west
Ridin' off into God's sunset
It's times like this a always think of you
But honey you know me I'll always be..

Tryin' to set the world on fire
Turn the key and spark the wire
Chasin' down a feelin' runnin' on desire
The future was an open road
Gone in a cloud of smoke
Leavin' a trail of flames behind those tires
Just you and me girl, settin' the world on fire

I'm settin' the world on fire
