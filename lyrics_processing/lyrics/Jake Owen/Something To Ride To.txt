She really broke my heart
Now I'm just drivin' down this highway
Listenin' in the dark
And all I really need is a catchy hook
No poetic words from a fancy book
No lies about love and forever
Just somethin' that'll make ya feel better
Give me somethin' to ride to
And forget about life to
The kind you wanna get high to
Lay back in the night to
Yeah used to be dance songs
Slow jams and romance songs
But now that she's gone and the radio's on
Yeah I just want one that don't sing about her
Give me somethin' to ride to
I don't know where I'm goin' right now
But the sign on the road says south
And if I hear one more slow down sound
I'm bound to turn back around
So give me somethin' to ride to
And forget about life to
The kind you wanna get high to
Lay back in the night to
Yeah used to be dance songs
Slow jams and romance songs
But now that she's gone and the radio's on
Yeah I just want one that don't sing about her
Give me somethin' to ride to
Yeah yeah
Give me somethin' to ride to
