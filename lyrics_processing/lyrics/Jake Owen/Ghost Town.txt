Thought it was safe to go outside
But I guess I was wrong
Thought I could take a little ride
Just to see what was going on
Girl, I know it's been a while
A while since you've been gone, I swear
Oh, but baby, I still see you everywhere

Around every corner, cafe, back road, stop sign
Stoplight, streetlight glow
Around every highway, driveway, fast song, slow song
On my radio
At every party, dive bar, backseat in my car
Sounds crazy I know
But you just keep hanging around
You got me living in a ghost town
Girl I see you every road I go down
Your memory of me about to throw down, showdown, oh now
Why'd you leave me living in a ghost town?

Across the room I see your face
Then it disappears
I hear your voice call out my name
Whispering in my ear
I reach for you but you're not here
You're still here

Well, I know you don't want me
So why, oh why, oh why do you haunt me?
