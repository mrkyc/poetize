Neighbor got a brand new Cadillac
Still got my old Ford truck (But it runs)
Got a sweet saltwater pool in the ground
We got a three-footer sittin' above (Splish splash)
Got a new John Deere, just ridin' around
With a cold beer in his hand (Hell yeah)
While I'm still pull, start, push
Hell, but it gets the job done, amen

We're always gonna want a little more than we got
Yeah, that's just the way the big world turns
Ride-riding that stock market rocket with holes in your pocket
Yeah, there's just one thing I've learned
If you're mad at the man or you're mad at the hand
You were dealt, well then, you're missing the point
Grass is always greener in somebody else's joint

Hey yo, Bobby
Sup, Jake
Hey man, what's it looking like over there on your side of the fence?
Looking pretty good brother, check it out

If you wanna live a little, give a little, take a little
But don't be so brittle, my friends (Stand up)
Just wiggle and giggle, stay tickled and whistle
And give more when you got it to hand (Give it up)
Don't spend your life chasing rainbows, baby
Just deal with the weather at hand (Deal with it)
And live life free and I guarantee
You can make it to the promise land

Come on, baby, singin' "Sweet Caroline"
