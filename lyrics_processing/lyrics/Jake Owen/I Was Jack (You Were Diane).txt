It was yesterday, it was years ago
We were singin' every word on the radio
Kinda like them songs could save our souls
Somehow, someway
We was fallin' fast, we was jumpin' in
Blue-jean halo hangin' off the limb
Two American kids just like them
Every time they played
And it blew us away

Do you turn it up? Do you sing along
Every time you hear that song?
Like we did then
Like we did when
Do you close your eyes? Does it make you laugh?
Do the memories take you back
To six-packs and a Chevy Cheyenne?
Way back when I was Jack and you were Diane

Yeah, and the music played

Yeah, we were never growin' up or growin' old
Breakin' up or lettin' go
Girl, just like rock 'n' roll
Where has it gone?
But I hope like hell every now and again
I blow across your mind like that summer wind
And you're holdin' on to sixteen long as you can
Every time that it comes on

Like we did then
Like we did when
Do you close your eyes? Does it make you laugh?
Do the memories take you back
To six-packs and a Chevy Cheyenne?
Way back when I was Jack and you were Diane

Oh yeah (Oh yeah, oh yeah)

Do you turn it up? Do you sing along
Every time you hear that song?
Does it still move you?
Baby, Hallelujah (Hallelujah)
Do you close your eyes? Does it make you laugh?
Do the memories take you back
To six-packs and a Chevy Cheyenne?
Way back when I was Jack and you were Diane

Yeah, way back, way on back
When I was Jack and you were Diane
Yeah, do you close your eyes? Does it make you laugh?
When I was Jack and you were Diane
