Kiss me, baby, I am Snow White
Sleeping in a coffin
Waiting for you (Waiting for magic)
Baby, I am Snow White
Sleeping in a coffin
Waiting for you (Waiting for magic)
Waiting for magic

A man of the world but lost in a dream
You look at something from a different angle
But I exist, I'm waiting for you
In a coffin made of glass

Kiss me, baby, I'm attractive
Baby, get to know me
Show who you are
Give me that music
Baby, I'm eternal
Lying in a coffin
Waiting for you

In your dream, a girl is dancing
Close to you (That girl is me)
Once a witch made her sleep
But a prince will wake her up, it's you
You might also like
Kiss me, baby, I'm attractive
Baby, get to know me
Show who you are
Give me that music
Baby, I'm eternal
Lying in a coffin
Waiting for you (Waiting for magic)

In the tale is the place to find her
Reach out and get to know her
It means so much to me
The meaning of the book

Oh, kiss me, baby, wake me up
Oh, kiss me, baby, wake me up
Join in the story of the fairytale
Believe the dream, you will not fail
Oh, kiss me, baby, wake me up
Oh, kiss me, baby, wake me up


Oh, kiss me, baby, wake me up
Come on, baby
Kiss me, baby, I am Snow White
Sleeping in a coffin
Waiting for you, waiting for magic
Baby, I am Snow White
Sleeping in a coffin
Waiting for you (Waiting for magic)
It's what I do (Waiting for magic)
For me and you
Oh, kiss me, baby, wake me up

Caught in a dream, how lucky you are
You can see me, I'm the girl behind you
So, open your eyes and turn around
And watch me dancing, join the fairy tales

Kiss me, baby, I'm Snow White
Kiss me, baby, I'm Snow White
Hey hey
Kiss me, baby, I am Snow White
Sleeping in my coffin
Waiting for you (Waiting for magic)

You cannot reach her on the planet
That the scientists want to call the earth
But if you use your imagination, you will see her
You will find her in your dreams
You cannot reach her on the planet
That the scientists want to call the earth
I see no shadows in my dreams
It is something so romantic
