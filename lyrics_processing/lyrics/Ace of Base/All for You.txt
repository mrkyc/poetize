Tout pour toi
Liaison dangereuse

I tried to write you a love song I thought I could
So far what I told, you misunderstood
It used to be so good
What went wrong with us
I remember our night in Montparnasse
You gave me a painting made of us
So I cherish our moments when we still were young

I won't give it up
Can't you see I'm not strong enough
Don't call my bluff
A sunny, sunny day

I'm doing it all for you
But you're letting me down, you better turn around
I'm doing it all for you
A-a a-All for you
L'amour ou le neant
You might also like
Hand in hand on our journey we're set for love
You and me against the world, never apart
So naive I could be, I thought our love would last

I won't give it up
Can't you see I'm not strong enough
Don't call my bluff
A sunny, sunny day

I'm doing it all for you
But you're letting me down, you better turn around
I'm doing it all for you
A-a a-All for you
I'm doing it all for you
But you're letting me down, you better turn around
When I am singing the blues for you
A-a a-All for you

Come to me honey, help me understand
About your feelings, about your plans
Just one more chance to hear my prayer
All for you
All for you
I'm doing it all for you
But you're letting me down, you better turn around
I'm doing it all for you
A-a a-All for you
(All for you)
I'm doing it All for you
(I would do the same tomorrow, all for you.)
But you're letting me down, you better turn around
(Without regrets, no sorrow, all for you.)
I'm doing it All for you
(I would do the same tomorrow, all for you.)
A-a a-All for you
(Without regrets, no sorrow, all for you.)
All for you
I would do the same tomorrow, All for you
