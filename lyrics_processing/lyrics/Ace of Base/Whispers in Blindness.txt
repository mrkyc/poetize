Darling, you were looking good
When you came to me
And asked for a dance
And I said, "We can dance"
I felt like a queen
Swedish summer nights are hot
And the trees can talk
We lay on the grass
So easily, so blessed
Whispers in blindness
And I didn't hold you back
I'm talking about it, babe
'Cause you've been teasing me
I'm talking about it
'Cause you are bad right through
Stay with me and I shall want no other love
Stay with me, another love, another lie
Stay with me, and I shall want no other love
You were talking so sweet
But you were touching and teasing

I can hear the soft bells ring
Through a thousand years
They call out to me
They say it's only once
In a life we love
I can hear the soft bells ring (Only once, my dear)
Through a thousand years
They call out to me
They say it's only once (Only once my dear)
In a life we love
Now I've had that honor too
You might also like
I'm talking about it, babe
'Cause you've been teasing me
I'm talking about it
'Cause you are bad right through
Stay with me and I shall want no other love
Stay with me, another love, another lie
Stay with me, and I shall want no other love
But you were touching and teasing

You were holding my hand
Ooh, you were kissing my skin
Oh, you were holding my hand
Ooh, you were kissing my skin

Stay with me and I shall want no other love
Stay with me, another love, another lie
Stay with me, and I shall want no other love
You were talking so sweet
But you were touching and teasing

Stay with me
Trees are whispering
Stay with me
Only once, my dear
Stay with me
Trees are whispering
But you were touching and teasing
Stay with me
Trees are whispering
Stay with me
Only once, my dear
Stay with me
Trees were whispering
Stay with me
