Whenever you're near me
I give you everything I have
Someone to believe in
When things are good or when they're bad
You know how to please me
Like nobody can
Someone to believe in
Be my lover, be my friend

When every race is run and the day is closin' in
I feel the need to hold you, let the night begin
Come softly to me, show me why

Whenever you're near me
I give you everything I have
Someone to believe in
When things are good or when they're bad
You know how to please me
Like nobody can
Someone to believe in
Be my lover, be my friend

I cannot wait to feel the beating of your heart
The days are long and they're just keeping us apart
Come softly to me, show me why
You might also like
Whenever you're near me
I give you everything I have
Someone to believe in
When things are good or when they're bad
You know how to please me
Like nobody can
Someone to believe in
Be my lover, be my friend

Whenever you're near me
Love is the reason we can feel this way inside, oh oh-oh
Turnin' the world around, makin' us wild
Love is the music beatin' in our hearts tonight, oh oh-oh
Lightin' the way to take us deeper inside
Whenever you're...

Whenever you're near me
I give you everything I have
Someone to believe in
When things are good or when they're bad
You know how to please me
Like nobody can
Someone to believe in
Be my lover, be my friend
Whenever you're near me
Someone to believe in
When things are good or when they're bad
You know how to please me
Someone to believe in
Be my lover, be my friend
