We live in a free world
I whistle down the wind
Carry on smiling
And the world will smile with you

Life is a flower
So precious in your hand
Carry on smiling
And the world will smile with you

When every race is run
And the day is closing in
I don't care about the world
I'm living for the light
Don't cry for me today, a ha ha ha

We live in a free world
I whistle down the wind
Carry on smiling
And the world will smile with you

Life is a flower
So precious in your hand
Carry on smiling
And the world will smile with you
You might also like
I can not be your judge
Mr. Jailer is your host
He's keeping you inside
And hides you from the world
No catcher in the rye can help you from yourself

We live in a free world
I whistle down the wind
Carry on smiling
And the world will smile with you

Life is a flower
So precious in your hand
Carry on smiling
And the world will smile with you

Please Mr. Agony
Release them for a while
Learn them the consequences of
Living without life

We live in a free world
I whistle down the wind
Carry on smiling
And the world will smile with you
Life is a flower
So precious in your hand
Carry on smiling
And the world will smile with you
We live in a free world
(Free world)

Life is a flower
(Is a flower)
Oh, oh

Oh, oh
I whistle down the wind
Carry on smiling
And the world will smile with you
Oh, oh
So precious in your hand
Carry on smiling
And the world will smile with you
We live in a free world
(Free world)
Carry on smiling
And the world will smile with you
Life is a flower
(Is a flower)
Carry on smiling
And the world will smile with you
We live in a free world
(Free world)
Carry on smiling
And the world will smile with you
Life is a flower
(Is a flower)
