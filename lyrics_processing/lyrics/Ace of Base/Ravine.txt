Have you heard
Have you heard
'Bout this girl who was ripped up by her roots?
Wanna know what she learned?
Like humility - you win when you lose
I have learned
I have learned
The most horrifying nights have ends
I was hurt
I was lost
In the dark, I found the way to a friend

I am standing here in my ravine
Once again I see a piece of the sky
And my joy'll never be denied
'Cause I was meant to be here
The only place on earth
Where you are near
Where you are near

Was a flower
So frail
And I let the trees grow wild around me
Grew so high
Hid the sky
Shaded everything I needed to see
Then one night
Someone came
Took a knife and ripped me up by my roots
Tossed astray
Far away
In my darkest night, I started to pray
You might also like
I am standing here in my ravine
Once again I see a piece of the sky
And my joy'll never be denied
'Cause I was meant to be here
The only place on earth
Where you are near
Where you are near

Why do you
Why do you ask
Why I'm not blaming my God? (Blaming my God)
I'll tell you
I'll tell you what
He was the only one there

Well, I am standing here in my ravine
Once again I see a piece of the sky
And my joy never will be denied
'Cause I was meant to be here
The only place on earth
Where you are near
I am standing here in my ravine
Once again I see a piece of the sky
And my joy'll never be denied
'Cause I was meant to be here
The only place on earth
Where you are near
