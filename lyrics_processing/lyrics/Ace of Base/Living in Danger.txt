Live for yourself, it's a wonderful thing
You can do what you want, you can live in a dream
Get up, get in
Get the rhythm, get down

You're living your life in peace and in harmony
You making your own decisions
That's how it's got to be for you and me
So many people are running around and 'round
Without a sense of logic

I see lies in the eyes of a stranger, whoa
(Live for yourself, it's a wonderful thing
You can do what you want, you can live in a dream)
You'll be living in danger
I see lies in the eyes of a stranger, whoa

You'll be living in danger
I see lies in the eyes of a stranger, whoa
You'll be living in danger
(Huh)

People are the same today as they used to be
The same expectations
So high, no-one can reach that high
Nor I, nor you get satisfied today
We never get enough
