I looked at this game from a different angle
Angels are conquering the skies,while we are twisting ankles
I feel followed by these nasty creatures
They think being a rapper is as easy as dealing with paychecks
Another day down the stretch
Tryna ignore it like a kanye with a cunning fetch
My mind is like a newspaper it waits to go to the next page
Padded portions of my life are locked in this gilded cage
Yeahhh,anger and stress are synonyms to cancer and depress
Excessively seeing people doing what they don't like
Looking loathed at gypsies,talking gibberish
Subliminal messages everywhere that's supreme devilish
My prophecy isn't written in the ancient mathematics
Aristotle to me it's like acrobatics
Shit im full of vices
Vividly judged,i think i need a messiah to break these devices
Devising new ones called consciences
Society wants me to become a follower
Shit,i'll rather be narrow-minded than a swallower
Serenity is not what society wants to make an entity
Entirely sure this is a trap
I prefer to stay in the anonymity,key to fame stands behind the trapdoor
I'm hardcore,hard to ignore,i can outscore ya with my vision
I'm in my own division,felt a bit safe
Confidence built over our faces
Until this tv shit will argue about another felony
HOOK
You might also likeThey act like they were dripped in holy water
Broke the parallel universe it was because of them
They act like they are going HAM
Hollow as a machine ,they still go hard as a motherfucker
Yeah i'm surrounded by the mirrors of society

Verse 2
Disgusting shit,society prepares the crime and the criminal commits it
Thank you momma for showing me that freedom doesn't exist
I persist to find it by trying to play it safe like cp3 on the assist
I assisted to all of this bullshit
I insisted to ball 'til i die to not get on bulls's dick
A detour with Willy tryna avoid violence with silence
We expect Samsonites to solve all of this chaotic defiance
Can't believe why i'm sentenced to live
In a world of distress with no diversity
Another chapter begins ,society will bring a new face in this adversity
New leaders, messing with the same cheerleaders
Shit i feel like i have no faith in humanity,cheers
Fears,tryna prick your fucking ears up
You still veer away from the subject,im just taking my luck upon these profits
These scumbags want me to be a philanthropist with the rich who appeases the puppets'
Tired to see muppets perceived as targets on these fucking streets
We all take monotony as a solace like a cannibal going back to his meat
I meet danger everyday ,it looks like nemesis with a reaper
Reappearing again , this shit is groundhog day again
Hah,i expect you to reflect to my point of view
You won't cuz the mirrors of society will make you to eschew
The truth will make you to review your life overthrew
