Born to be a child,just a little creature born in the wild
In a fucked up world tryna be mild
Tryna remain immature and not surreal
Cuz i'm stil like a toddler stealing that holy water
Molly-coddle tryna understand the meaning of life in this milk bottle
I felt insecure in my childhood,like jayceon taylor with no hood
Lemme put mine on
I used to think is good to be an adult
Learned from my mistakes
Missed those breath taking moments
Now i'm part of the wrath waking movement
Cuz moving forward with babysteps
Will make me cry like a baby with no maps
Mysterious and obvious why can't you spell my name right
Delirious and anonymous,but i still rap in these gaps
Putting my sweat in this beaten notebook on my laps
Just face the facts
My life is like a continuous memento
Tattoos are taboos i put them on facades to remember
That ember on my mind for my memories pronto
It's almost december and my parents are bankrupt
Honesty and modesty didn't make them bank corrupt
I didn't sink in my psychopath dreams with a psycholaugh
Cuz imma kid living like a loner
No responsibilities,but my problems get bigger when the cash ain't either

I just wanna stay young
A kid who can't define the right and wrong
My pains are growing along with my past
Those are envisioned in the mirror
I've overcome them with no terror
Wish this times will forever last

	
Verse 2
Shit's gettin' worse when you can't get through past decisions
Decisive deceptions grindin' for my atrocious anomalies against your dirty allusions
Illusions of staying ignorant with my parents as backup
I knew that i can't succeed with these lessons as lay up
Cuz it ain't easy when you're kwame brown tryna layup
Enjoying the best of me,i hope the future won't take the rest of me
Just tell me,how am i gonna sell out the world if you ain't a sellout
Adolescence made me a humble pie person
Cracking codes like a crack addict ,that's a fumble curse son
I don't do drugs cuz my parents want me to get a decree
You know grades ain't pink toes for your druggy foes who don't go to college for free
I'm just limitless,brainstorming it's way boring cuz i'm reckless
Seeing hunger like it's a game will make me gonna wreck less
Word is bond ,i'm a kid with a vast imagination
First love sounds like a dumb cover book that's my perception
Inceptions with Christopher Nolan drinking coffee in the same prison section
I wish my life was a movie,but when i saw the bigger picture,that shit just wrecked my brain
Time is passing,i think i'm running relentlessly out of line
Ya know ,i've lowered these clocks tryna go back and unlock this rock of memories
My grandpa is now the only child in me
