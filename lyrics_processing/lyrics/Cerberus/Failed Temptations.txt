Yeah,i'm living the nightly nostalgia
Looking at the moon with my sniper eye view
Like i knew that light won't fright at my daddy's rear view
Hah,that's a rare view that not even dreams can afford
Late nights that can't be pronounced by bottles
Shit that never eased my pain
My conscious told me to to keep my memory lane away from the prejudices
I didn't listen cuz i was focused on getting laid with some hoes
Focused on the money,when the banks were full of thoughts
I tried to run away from it, what's my existence
Stuck in this game full of sharks,that lost its fragrance
I ended up using a frag to brag about my toughness,like i knew this was about to reminiscence
Life is the only code,that hackers can't brake
Cuz afterlife ain't a program for fuck sake
Psyched to translate my mind into a pseudo code
Shit,this is dark comedy i think i got the lode
My temptations led me to an arrogant person
I guess the nonchalance is calculated per sin
Hook:
Yeah,i'm unpolished cuz i'm just a kid
My Temptations turned this into life lessons
Don't be like me,a shallow soul
Just play your own character and be a mazinger

Yeah you're are the bitch who was waiting for the knight in a shiny armor
The Genghis Khan in a lambo,worship him like a lamb,hoe
I shit on people who don't read books
A mind like a wireless connected to the masses with the looks
A mind disconnected to the truth with no wire to reconnect em
An obstacle to pass,but i guess gandalf won't let me
This ain't a song about random shit,i wrote this from my soul
Playing poker with the minions of lucifer
They always won so i've earned a crucifer
I got crucified by that,like friends stab you in the back,just like that
Homicide became a human mistake
True that,we love to kill each other,that ain't a moot fact
Endless world wars with fake pacts and not a chance to react
This is history in the making with a shitty sequel
What if it was calm and peace
That won't happen when you give God:blasphemy,abomination and jealousy all in one piece
I tried to tempt ya in becoming a better person
