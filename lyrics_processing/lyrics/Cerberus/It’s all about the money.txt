Frankly you need to earn your bread
Money puts knowledge a price on its head
Ahead of my time,staying and hitting them lies with an arrowhead
Are you scared? i ain't flinching
You want an appointment with a pointing bitch
Heading nowhere with this mentally dead rich
Man,this ain't business,there're backups
Busy bussing and begging to them like you're kicking the beach with flip-flops
Bitches look at my struggle just to double the amount of push ups
That ain't smart
It demands more IQ to release the demon from your pocket
Pock-marked,having no choice,but to endure,store them like a locked locket
Low budget,all i see is fancy cars,chancy kids and families with a high heirloom
Hair zoom,that shit costs more than a fucking glamorous tomb
Tom cruise, a gloom on a cruise searching for angelina in a tomb
She's zombie,who eats cheese from the producers
Pathetically,conceptually you know what rules around us
You don't need to go back to your ugly past to know what levitates in us
Live your life by waisting your money on stupid dreams which no one cares about
It goes around like a casino roulette,you roll them like it's a packet of cigarettes
Civilized human beings didn't attend the ceremony of the keys
I have started the inception of enlightenment, Indiana Jones
Yeah treasure hunters are searchin' in my grandma's basement
Most of the rich are reincarnated now that shit makes me mad
You're desperately going to the cash machine
Transfer them,take them,use them,now you are an addict
Like adolf hitler, adding pain to the poverty district
Yeah,it's all about the money

I don't want to reach the so called standards
Money causes ultra violence in violent lands
With beaches full of quiet quicksands
People don't like to be helped cuz they want something in exchange
I always tell them to take this dick and extend their range
What's really important is blessed in disguise
Seize the day, i mean seize today
Don't tryna improvise for tomorrow
You can be the bitch of the system cuz u'are already shallow
The truth can't be handled,that's my motto
Let's just stare at the bottom cuz we'll all end up there
Consciously asking myself:When we will even care?
You tryna rent my good thoughts, bitch don't you dare
Aloha to this poison world, we are all manipulated
Thinking is the the first you worked with it is outdated
22nd century we will kill each other for money
It will be another meaningless world war
