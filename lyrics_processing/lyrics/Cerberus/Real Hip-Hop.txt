I have no idea why eyedea is rapping in the heavenly clouds
I guess i act as suicidal as a flock of homicidal crows
Primordial and loyal to this game you gotta play strategic like chess
I've remained cordial to my lyrics,i've embodied em in eccentric art as a form of progress
Rap is not a way of protest,some of us wanna be as good as the pro's,while hoes sniff coke in excess
I inject my thirst of knowledge in the wrists of music addiction
My veins are like moshpits people expect to mosh on my hits like shmurda's conviction
Lemme take my daily fruition,this game should bring healthy raps with no one judging ur perception
Call me the blacksmith,imma hammer up these lame rappers ,hah you can't touch this
Mic,but if you do you might wanna clean it up and let someone else to run circles around you
Call me the locksmith,i lock and block whack rappers in their natural habitat
You gotta be ill to escape it,you gotta feel it in order to embrace it
Fake emcees think they know the password
When words don't pass this ain't football or puff puff pass,it's something unheard
Rhymes and poetry is all i deliver through my conscience while the others flipping the bird
I toss this verbal aerial godlike messages like poseidon's trident
People be obsessed by street ideology
They don't know i ain't a gangster nor homeless i bump these rappers with my wicked mythology
Call me the wordsmith,my words reveal secrets about the world we are living inn
I worship the greats,they're my mates,put them on my warship to regain balance
In this miseducated era full of materialistic people so malice so selfish like a king drinking from its chalice
Let's put time in perspective,life is too short  you gotta cherish every moment
Every minute,every hour,every second can spark your mind ,be anti-violent with ur deadly opponent
Water is the healing component
Cuz that's all i need to kill these boring rappers with a cocky attitude
I come straight from romania,a country full of bullshit
Here,bulls can't be battled ,they bully you until you're part of the system
All my life was full of failures,mistakes are the thing that gave me wisdom
Lemme paint my lyrics with a rembrandt flamboyance
