I'm out of my mind
Lemme portray my thoughts
Coming off with this intro
Showing all of my skills like a sneaky de vito
A deep beginning with food for thought on the table ,i'm on my incognito
I spit lyrical bombs with bin laden under my feet
While your average rapper's listening to commercial waiting for a classic beat
Hah,i'm a white rapper waiting for wealth like kennedy's assassination waiting for stealth in the backseat
Backing my records,regularly tried to make black music
People tryna stop this obsessive passion,i cherish lines to the poor cuz i'm too sick
I'm too slick,such a dick ,bringing you my first mixtape
Bringing my mixed emotions linked with duct tape
This darkness that i'm embracing with this bitches enticing to be raped
I hope you like my struggle art
I started to rap for a chick,damn she had a boyfriend,it cut me deep like Mona Lisa
I'm a romanian representing the revolution,sticking to the present with this presentation
Now don't fuck with me, my lyrics mean war,warning you to leave my nation
Alone,All above my conscious,i might feel more philosophical
I might need more water to drown my talents
I'm sick of people who come across at me like patients
Patience brought me to inconspicuous in front of my parents
Apparently,my raps are full of parental advisories
I bring a lot of substance cuz the chemistry between us brought a mural of soliloquies
Yeah,i'm here to bring some social commentary
In motion with the universe
I might bring more verses than an unique teamwork ethic by the spurs
I like San Antonio cuz i ball in objectivity
Introspective in a sense that my stories are told from the future
I drop knowledge without autotune i just stay in tune without being a preacher
The teacher of my world is my grandfather
He taught me how to ball and to become as wise as an indian bird caller
A deep beginning

16s a heavyweight, straight outta prison break
Chevy chase on the final straights
My mind is a runaway freight horse comin out the gate
I lay grace when the pen and paper combinate
And from that state of mind leave ya mind in 5 states
Fever like beyonce multiply the crime rate
Droppin the drama vomit dramamine for nausea
Mcs thinkin they sicker they pop lots of em
Im croppin em, circle out, watering creative drought
I ain't the greatest out but lately all you make it sound
Like asians when im gazing round, the same damn smile
And you wonder why they sayin hip hops down?
Fuck the crown, ima rick grimes ya geeks
With a legion of beats sharpened lead a couple sheets
Then ya brain ventilated the pain i main vein
