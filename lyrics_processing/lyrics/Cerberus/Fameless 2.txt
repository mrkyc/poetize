My first day as a rapper was the worst day ever
I tried to be a spitter,but my rhymes were shallowly bitter
Better bent them or open my third eye to make em endlessly matter
I'm passing words over passports while record labels tryna pass swords
Smash boards showing me them numbers on the dashboards
Number one in the charts,but the last one in collecting new hearts
The beat bangs on your belly button
But c'mon you know i'm kiddin' for the sake of the limelight
Limes for the little kids,lemme put this piece to support greenpeace
I just speak my piece,tryna squeeze them like damn that's a dimepiece
Fameless,no worries,forever on my grind
Nudging and judging celebrities on the mic for increasing their egotistical minds
Be preferring memories and stories and facts over fat stacks,spotlights and ugly smiles all around
Gotta live the life and remain grounded for the sake of fame
Not become another wind-up doll or another gucci mane
See the sights,like flashlights lighting houses over the main insane brain
Hype train,misleading way,mistaking your talents with Michael Bay
Hook
Road to redemption or road to perfection
These bitches play with your mind like medication
They put money in your pills
Don't be a slave to them record labels
Just be you,play safe and remain fameless

I'm an independent artist,honest and reliable in my work
Admirable and sophisticated rappers are ate with knife and fork
Murk papers,i always act blind when i see dots and lines
Like a thief being spotted and continuously hides
Abnormally cries for not getting paid
Normally he spends stacks on racks,hearts and spades fake made
Human clueless in his own stubbornness his life got split into earthquakes
Slated in the unknown,spiteful decisions stuck in mindless emissions
I call'em tv shows,he chose to take a shower and wash his brain,cuz of his raged concussions
Aged in the same assumptions,he is a lame consumer who became a salty loser
A ballsy abuser who plays the game,claiming to be a contributor
Continues to drown his talents in the nasty temptations
Lost in the unfriendly hood,he realized money never puts you in a chill mood
You can't go back when your whole-souled got sold out
He felt like a prisoner with no way out
He had no choice,but to stop making music
