My homies are talking behind my back
They don't know what can be found inside the Santa sack
This Clause needs a good cause for a refund
My stress day starts with a poor kid being defunded
By school,for being a fool and stealing from others absconded
Absolutely,abs for gigolos,gigling about their success
Tempest,80 years old,80 tales told,same ending with an abrupt guess
I'm a guest to this conquest of my life
Stressed with low key ideas and unrealistic goals
Folks,porky won't save the day with his unapologetic sows
Seeds for human beings they need meticulousity like noble steeds
Tired to see a regular dumb asshole with a diploma
Dealing with drugs,hangin' with thugs who don't know shit about lymphoma
The longevity of the issues we are dealing with
Is like walking on the moon without feeling it
I opened the TV to improve my knowledge
Now i regret it to prove my fanatic rage
I engaged the gods not to disregard
The system played by obama's card
I guess he cares just like pepe who fair plays
Reloading my raps look at me shooting with a machine gun
Kelly like grace embracing the awards with fun
We feel tortured by jobs which no one likes
Lies behind his tight tie,that's how your boss vibes
With both knives on the table,your fate is unstable
He might end up your life and put you in a crisis
Crying in the abyss with Iraq waiting for the beloved Isis
Shit we are still being caught in the stereotype
You tryna seal the deal
I'm so stressed of every decision to make
It's annoying why the world treats me like an apprentice

On monday,people moan a lot cuz it's the worst day
While,The poor and the homeless are still praying for a better life on their birthdays
Sparkles and happiness in their eyes when you give them an useless gift
We are still dreaming on finer things
Our lives are measured now with liner rings
I take my lebrons and sphinxes to make it safe until tuesday
Another day in this hypocrisy,hypothetically speaking this is doomsday
Lemme put my metal face so i can be colder than Pryor on april fools day
What more can i say tomorrow is wednesday,shit people call it the hump day
Middle of the week,now it's my time to decipher my riddle rhymes with fiddle chimes
For the weaks who are impatient for thursday,hope has started to grow in your eyes
My breakfast look is not cosigned,i cosine the angle between fame and strangle
I got 0,it takes more than one week to be a hero,just chill bro cuz tomorrow it's friday
Maybe the 13th will give me less fortune and more knowledge
I know this song got you on the edge of your seat
I might call my favorite wrestler as a beta tester
Master of the spears,you got one in your stomach
Or just take the oil,boil it and give to the arabians
African-Americans cherish their lives more than the romanians
Wrong twisted turn,a throng of wicked riots might burn yo home on saturday
A satire way of thinking,the week came to an end
Sunny days on Sundays fun days with your family
Kid restrain youreslf,go to high school and then faculty
Don't go berserk just cuz your mommy and daddy ain't there
