Yeah,sense my anger
Adrenaline is what i need for this addictive banger
Bewildered by this humongous chaotic world
Willing to change it while both sides want to erase it
On this side they murder with a malevolence  hit
On this side murder is dressed elegantly with a knit suit
Both sides act the same when money plays the main role
Frustration and fury next to a jury is the ticket to system control
Damn,look at the struggle that surrounds us
Fam,look at the luck that abandoned us
Hit the bus with all the fuss
Like a circus celebrating cold hearted clowns at the surface
Criticized for not being a mean motherfucker with that usual white face
White scarfaced kid with no coke in his veins
Violet violence with screamed voices accompanied by violin
Shit, this world should sink in hell
Like atlantis,blinking and casting a curse spell
I pray for the lost ones to boost my respect
Shit's real it costs self-esteem to inject in this human infect

Hook:
I see cruel people all over the place
Cruelty flows in their veins
They all tryna kill
I live in a cruel world and this how i feel

Verse 2
Everyday is a bath full of blood
Buried alive tryna survive these mud covered
Creatures protecting us from good people
This world is constantly changing
Pride,lust, gluttony,i face these kind of people every single day fading
If they see the president they all obey
They obliviate how to spell war backwards
This means raw,raging evasive like i earned the backstabber award
Explicit background images,imagination stuck in the past
With the ancestors that never knew about this mass massacre blast
Suicidal thoughts no one to trust
Seriously throw your nuts so i can bust shots
Bust rhymes,beggin ya to bust 'em out with the morse dots
Duplicating identities,i feel like i'm in shutter island
I landed in this world leveled to the ground
Shit michael buffer wants to go for another round
Bound bell sound of death
Found my meaning on this fucking planet
I guess it's too late to make a plan with a bandit
I'm swallowed and sentenced to live between fake humans
