(It goes AMG)
Did you know I came from the bottom like an orphan
Been broke my whole life
'Bout to buy the whole Nordstrom
When I get a check we gon' ball like Jordan
But ammo for my .40 i forgot
That's important, torch 'em
Watch when I get on imma be on magazines
Have them bitches nekkid
Fucking in my limousine
Mobbing with my niggas
We be fucking with that lean
Diamonds on my neck
Feeling like I'm Mr.Clean
Tell me why you mad
Is it cause I brag
Or I could fuck your mother
Is it cause I'm gettin' cash
And I ain't never slipping
That .40 gave me a rash
I want a nigga try me
I put his ass in a bag (Nigga)

Leave these bitch niggas rottin'
You don't want no problems
Hold up boog I got 'em
If it go down I'm riding
Leave these bitch niggas rottin'

See me I'm real
Fuck around get killed
Come around my niggas
Actin' like you totin' that steel
This is not no game
I leave your ass in the field
I ain't talking no grand mansion
We put your ass in that grill
Hit you up with that steel
Pussy ain't even like that
You came straight from the hill
Keep shootin' them 20 T's
Nigga you ain't really tryna kill
I'll take a look at your bitch
And worry no goin off to Brazil
This shit for real I'm gettin' money nigga
She heard I signed to AMG
So she a dummy nigga
You know the old me
Nappyhead bummy nigga
I ain't never had shit
You ain't taking it from me nigga

(I said)
Bitch you really wanna take a picture
With a nigga she be suckin' my dick
Man I hope you don't kiss her
Young nigga from the hood
In chinchilla we be gettin' that money
Got niggas like Killa
Hope a nigga pull up front front me
New lane if a nigga play dumb
Put his bitch on Game
And we fuckin' her duckin' her
Doin' her suckin' her
Bitch wanna baby
She told me to bust in her "nah"
Damn, lil nigga bout to go ham
Put this dick in her around me
Dick in her mouth what she sayin'
Got her on me like she grindin'
Don't give a fuck 'bout her man
I beat it up like a ram
She wanna get famous
I bring out the cam
Honestly you don't want no problems
You niggas broke so how the fuck we gonna rob 'em
.40 with the rubber grip I'm gonna drop 'em
You talk a lot of shit
Till your people tell I rock
