That's my attitude
Hello
Who is this
Baby do you realize what time it is
What's up/Nothing's up
I'm asleep
Wait a minute
I thought you weren't talking to me no more
Remember just the other day you were fronting on me
Talking about my head was big now that I'm making records
You now what I'm saying
Oh/ when did you make that change
Well listen/ I got things to do
You know what I'm saying
You got to get off my line
You know/Straight up

You say you don't like
The way that I am
Frankly baby
I don't give a damn
After all the things you put me through
I'm not gonna take this
Take this stuff from you
You might also like
You say that you can't believe
That a man could be so rude
Hey baby, that's my attitude
You call me up on my phone
Telling me, don't be cruel
Hey baby that's my attitude

You don't understand why I'm acting like this
You want me to sit here and explain why?
Listen I'm tired of talking, Yo Allen kick it

I gave you my money
I gave all my time
All you did was mess around with my mind
Then you go and find you another lover
I want you to know, payback is a mother
(Cry, cry, day and night)
Now you wanna come back
But it just isn't like that
Don't think for a minute
Baby, I'm not with it

You say that you can't believe
That a man could be so rude
Hey baby, that's my attitude
You call me up on my phone
Telling me, don't be cruel
Hey baby that's my attitude
You say that you can't believe
That a man could be so rude
Hey baby, that's my attitude
You call me up on my phone
Telling me, don't be cruel
