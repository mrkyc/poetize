I've imagined faces of many lovers
To ease the pain of having no one in my life
And I'm tired of being undercover
It's time to navigate my feelings tonight

The sky is calm, the stars are bright
What's better than to be in flight
I'll relax my mind and be at ease
And let this journey set me free
Set me free
And I'll

Spread my wings (Oh) and fly away (Hey)
To a place that I long for
And my heart will be (My heart will be) the pathway (Say)
I'm searching for a love that's ever more (Ow)

I often wondered how I managed
Always searching but not finding a true heart
What does it take to find me a lover?
I'm hoping that I don't have to fly too far

The sky is calm, the stars are bright
And what's better than to be in flight?
I'll relax my mind and be at ease
And let this journey set me free
Set me free, set me free

Spread my wings and fly away
To a place that I long for
(I've been lonely, oh)
And my heart will be the pathway (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
I'm searching for a love that's ever more
(Ever more, oh)


Tommy, you play
Spread my wings and fly away
And my heart will be the pathway
(Spread my wings, baby, say)
To a place that I long for
(Someone give me love)
(My heart will be, yeah)
(Oh, oh) (Oh, hey)
(Think I'm gonna take off)
(I say, girl I wanna fly away)
Spread my wings and fly away
(I'll take my wings and fly away, oh, oh)
To a place that I long for
(Just you and me, baby)
And my heart will be (Oh) the pathway
I'm searching for a love that's ever more (Ever more)
Spread my wings (Oh oh) and fly away (Hey)
To a place that I long for
(Just you and me, baby)
And my heart will be (Oh, oh) the pathway
I'm searching for a love that's ever more (Oh oh)
Spread my wings (I said oh oh) and fly away (Oh oh)
To a place that I long for
And my heart will be the pathway
