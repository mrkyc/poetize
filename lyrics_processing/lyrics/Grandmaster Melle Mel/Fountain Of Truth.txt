All the children just clap your hands
Everybody just clap your hands
And have a ball, y'all
Everybody just clap your hands
All the children just clap your hands, (clap your hands)
And have a ball, y'all
Everybody just clap your hands
All the children just clap your hands
And have a ball, y'all
:
I've always been looking
Been trying, been yearning
Continually seeking
And searching and burning
Exploring and hunting
And everywhere turning
For that power fountain
That fountain of truth
No answers at all in the streets or the mall
I saw it in the ocean, found raging emotion
Nothing is stable
I'm really not able to find that power fountain
That fountain of truth
You might also like:
The future is yours
The time is now
The place is here
Shout now
So every kid can hear
So every woman and man in the land can understand the new world
Inherited by the children
Free from famine or disease
That's right
Free from the gun and the knife
Forever, for life
Free from all the mistakes that we made in the past
Throw your hands in the air and let the truth last
:
I've always been looking
Been trying, been yearning
Continually seeking
And searching and burning
Exploring and hunting
And everywhere turning
For that power fountain
That fountain of truth
No answers at all in the streets or the mall
I saw it in the ocean, found raging emotion
Nothing is stable
I'm really not able to find that power fountain
That fountain of truth
:
You got the power
The wind in every hour
To blossom like a flower under the rain shower
The reach like the branch of the tree up in the sky
So reach high and soar with the eagles as we fly
Flight of great heights
Fight the great fights
Strong and sing songs of wrongs just made right
And the never ending search for the fountain of youth
In your youth you're bound to find a fountain of truth
:
I've looked in the city
A place without pity
Seen mountains of wealth
Not fountains of health
Nothing is stable
I'm really not able to find that powerful fountain
That fountain of the truth
:
Everybody just clap your hands
All the children just clap your hands
And have a ball, y'all
All the children just clap your hands
Everybody just clap your hands
And have a ball, y'all
Everybody just clap your hands
All the children just clap your hands, (clap your hands)
And have a ball, y'all
Everybody just clap your hands
All the children just clap your hands
And have a ball, y'all
:
Fountain of truth
Fountain of truth
