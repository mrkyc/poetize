They smile in your face and they talk behind your back
And when you get the story, it's never exact
Some say, they're your friends but they really are not
Because they are only out to try and get what you've got

It's called survival, only the strong can survive
It's called survival, in order to stay alive

Like Hercules, your body is strong
But your mind is like the Devil, your ideals are wrong
You hurt people's feelings and mess with their minds
And have the nerve to call me brother and wave the peace sign
The young and the old, they all hate your sight
Because of people like you, they're scared to walk in the night
It's called survival and only the strong can survive
It's called survival and only the strong can survive
It's called survival in order to stay alive
It's called survival, survival, survival, survival

The problems of the world today are bigger than life
You have recessions and depressions, men are cheating on their wives
Babies born each morn' with parts of their bodies gone
Because of some crazy drug that their mothers was on
This country is fightin' not unitin'
Always putting each other down
Blacks and whites don't realize that they're really pink and brown
You got; gun-totin' cut-throats, stress and strife
And looking out for number one is a way of life

It's called survival and only the strong can survive
It's called survival in order to stay alive

You've got to lock all your windows, chain up all your doors
To protect what's inside of your house's stores
Beware of the food, it might be no good
'Cause there's someone trying to poison the whole neighbourhood
Today they found something in somebody's door
They said, "killed ten people and hurt four more"
You can't even trust a pill to make life easier when there's
Sudden death on your grocer's freezer
Survival, only the strong can survive
It's called survival, only the strong can survive
It's called survival, in order to stay alive
It's called survival, survival, survival, survival

About to lose your mind because life is hard
And yet you believe in everything but God
Those pretty women, lots of money, yeah, that's alright
But don't you ever forget the man with the might
Now get a hold of yourself man, think positive
Because that's definitely the only way to live
Don't let you mind flow, like water from a cup
And don't you ever let me hear you say that you're giving up
It's called survival, only the strong can survive
It's called survival, only the strong can survive
It's called survival in order to stay alive
It's called survival, survival, survival, survival

Remember: a child is born with no state of mind
He was blind to the ways of mankind
God is smiling on you but he's frowning too because only god knows what you'll go through
Survival, only the strong can survive
It's called survival and only the strong can survive
It's called survival in order to stay alive
