I'm guilty of diving in the deep end
My feet never touch the ground
And I put you on a pedestal so high
That when you fall, it's a long way down

I'm always going over the limit
I coulda laugh till I start to cry
I give in till there's no more giving
Then I get mad cause I'm empty inside

I need something in the middle
Not too much and not too little
I turn love into a riddle
And I get bored if it's too simple
Cause I either worship the ground that you're walking
Or I'm walking all over you
Don't need a rebel or a hero
I need something in the middle
Something in the middle with you

Can't have one sip from a bottle
I gotta drink every drop of the wine
I drive all night, all the way to a breakdown
Must be something about the thrill that I like
You might also like
Wish I could say I'm on the same level
Wish I could say I was mortified
I keep chasing the thing I've always wanted
Till that moment that I make it mine

I need something in the middle
Not too much and not too little
I turn love into a riddle
And I get bored if it's too simple
Cause I either worship the ground that you're walking
Or I'm walking all over you
Don't need a rebel or a hero
I need something in the middle
Something in the middle with you

I need something in the middle
Not too much and not too little
I turn love into a riddle
And I get bored if it's too simple
Cause I either worship the ground that you're walking
Or I'm walking all over you
Don't need a rebel or a hero
I need something in the middle
Something in the middle with you
