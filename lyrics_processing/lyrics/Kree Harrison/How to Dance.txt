I'm on the bleachers, sitting love out
Watch from a distance, blend in with the crowd
If I don't get up then I won't fall down
So many roses out on the floor
I've been just  here by the door
Picking their petals, playing hearts for sport

Then you walked in, took this flower off the wall
Said, "Darling, don't you worry I'll catch you if you fall"

I never wanted to know all the moves
But that look in your eye makes it easy to do
I ain't afraid to look like a fool when you take me by the hand
Something that seemed so impossible
You got my heart beating to the tempo, I'll give it a chance
You make me wanna know how to dance

Don't know if I have the hang of this yet
I know you'll be here with my every step
We'll learn as we go, just make up the rest

No, I don't care what it looks like
As long as you're with me under the spotlight
You might also like
I never wanted to know all the moves
But that look in your eye makes it easy to do
I ain't afraid to look like a fool when you take me by the hand
Something that seemed so impossible
You got my heart beating to the tempo, I'll give it a chance
You make me wanna know how to dance, dance

Put your hand in mine
Spin my heart 'round one more time

I never wanted to know all the moves
But that look in your eye makes it easy to do
I ain't afraid to look like a fool when you take me by the hand
Something that seemed so impossible
You got my heart beating to the tempo, I'll give it a chance
You make me wanna know how to dance
