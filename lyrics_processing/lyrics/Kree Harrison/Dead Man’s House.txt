You rolled in on a cold wind
I remember that night so well
Say a widow in a window
You thought she needed your help
Like a wolf in sheep's clothing
Just covered her eyes in wool
You're not a savior, you didn't save her
You just played like a fool

You ain't the king of this castle
You ain't the rule of this roost
Baby, let me save you the hassle
Your feet will never fit in them boots
You're just standing in the shadow
There ain't a shadow of doubt
You're never gonna win this battle
You're never gonna where that crown

You're just living in a dead man's house
Living in a dead man's house
You're just living in a dead man's house
Living in a dead man's house
You might also like
You can lay there, you can stay there
You can keep on trying to pretend
It's a joke though, cause we both know
Who's chair you're rocking in
So go on, put a show on
If it helps you sleep at night
But you can't be that man
No matter how hard you try

You ain't the king of this castle
You ain't the rule of this roost
Baby, let me save you the hassle
Your feet will never fit in them boots
You're just standing in the shadow
There ain't a shadow of doubt
You're never gonna win this battle
You're never gonna where that crown

You're just living in a dead man's house
Living in a dead man's house
You're just living in a dead man's house
Living in a dead man's house
You're just living in a dead man's house
Living in a dead man's house
You're just living, living in a dead man's house

You ain't the king of this castle
You ain't the rule of this roost
Baby, let me save you the hassle
Your feet will never fit in them boots
You're just standing in the shadow
There ain't a shadow of doubt
You're never gonna win this battle
You're never gonna where that crown

You're just living in a dead man's house
Living in a dead man's house
You're just living in a dead man's house
