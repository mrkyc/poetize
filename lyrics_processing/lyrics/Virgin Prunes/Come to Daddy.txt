This day, this day goes so slow
Like every other day
Day in
Day out
So boring
I don't know what to do
I have so much, so much to do
Time and time and time again
Time and time I hear a call
Love is lost, far away
Love is lost like yesterday
Where would you be without mummy?
Where would you be without daddy?
It's only natural, what you say
It's only natural, what you say
Say
Down on all fours crawling like a dog
Oh the pain!
Mirror mirror on the wall
Mirror mirror I see it all
My face looks old
Old and grey
My face looks older than yesterday
Yesterday is tomorrow, only backwards
Only backwards

On the bed
In the kitchen
On the floor
Come to daddy
In the bedroom
On the bed
In the kitchen
On the floor
Come to daddy
Take a chance
Take a chance today
Take a chance and blow it away
It's all in the head
Day in
Day out
So boring
Oh we are, we are so young
Oh you know
We have so much to look forward to
Time and time and time again
And Time and time I hear my call
Your dreams are lost and far away
Your dreams are farther than yesterday
Oh mother
No one cares about mommy
What would we do without daddy?
I told you not to wear that dress
I told you not to wear that dress
I don't like it
Down on all fours crawling like a dog
Oh the pain!
Mirror mirror on the wall
Mirror mirror I see it all
My face looks old
Old and grey
My face looks older than yesterday
Yesterday is tomorrow, only backwards
Only backwards (Backwards!)
Only backwards
In the bedroom
On the bed
In the kitchen
On the floor
Come to daddy
In the bedroom
White sheets on the bed
In the kitchen
On the cold floor
Come to daddy
This day, this day seems so long
This day, this day oh, goes on
And on
My love is lost and far away
(Help me, help me)
My love is lost, just like yesterday
Mirror mirror on the wall
Mirror mirror I see it all
My face looks old
(It looks old)
Old and grey
(Old and grey)
My face looks older than yesterday
(Looks older)
Oh you know, we are so young
Oh we have so much to look forward to
I told you not to wear that dress
I told you not to wear that dress
No one cares about mommy
No one cares about mommy
No one cares about mommy
The life I lead is here today
The love I need is far away
No way of getting there
Is there anywhere of getting there?
Oh we are, we are so young
