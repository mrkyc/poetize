Last winter
I stood so tall and then fell down
But you still stayed around
You moved me
You changed me
You made it good to be alive
Oh Lord it's good to be alive
So
Take a little bit of my love and hold it
Close to your body when the nights are long
Take a little bit
And hold on to it
Take a little bit of my love and hold it
Our lives are
So precious
And time can always pass us by
But you never know why
So hold on
Let's hold out
And play for keeps with what we got
You know there's only one shot
Girl I'm beggin' you to
Take a little bit of my love and hold it
Close to your body when the nights are long
Take a little bit
And hold on to it
Take a little bit of my love and hold it
(take a little bit of my love and hold it)
Hold me
(close to your body when the nights are long)
Life's so short
(Take a little bit and hold on to it)
Life's so precious so ah
Hold me hold me hold me hold me
You might also likeTake a little bit of my life and hold it
Take a little bit of my life and hold it
Hold on to me
I gotta mean somethin' to you
Don't let me go
Please
Please don't let me down
So
Take a little bit of my love and hold it
Close to your body when the nights are long
Take a little bit
And hold on to it
Take a little bit of my love and hold it
Take it take it take it
Oh oh ah oh
Take a little bit of my love and hold it
Hold me
