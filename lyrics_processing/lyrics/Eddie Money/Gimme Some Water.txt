When her number one son goes bad playing cards with the Devil's Hand
Daddy got real sick so quick - four walls never understand
I was the one who got good with the gun - took the money from the rich man's land
Give me some water 'cause I shot a man on the Mexican border
Cool, cool water
Give me some water
I need a little water
Jimmy grew up so fast and he met me at the pass one day
Said, "You're a wanted man. Take your brother's hand - I'll be running with you, anyway."
So we rode late in the night like fires on the desert sand
'til one day the posse caught us 'cause the sheriff always gets his man
Give me some water 'cause I killed a man on the Mexican border
Cool, cool water
I need a little water
Oh, geeze, if I just get loose my hands
I'd run just as fast as my legs can
But, Lord, I've got no room to run
Shouldn't have done what I did without that gun
Give me some water 'cause I killed a man on the Mexican border
Cool, cool water

Take the restless horse; tie may hands, of course; tell my mother that I'm finally free
Let me die like a man - no one understands; let me pray that a poor man pray
Smack that horse in the ass; with my last dying gasp my brother could hear me say
Give me some water 'cause I shot a man on the Mexican border
Cool, cool water
Give me some water
Give me some water 'cause I shot a man on the Mexican border
Cool, cool water
Give me some water
Give me some water 'cause I shot a man on the Mexican border
Cool, cool water
Give me some water
Give me some water 'cause I killed a man on the Mexican border
Cool, sweet water
