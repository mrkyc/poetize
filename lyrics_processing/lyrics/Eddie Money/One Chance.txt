I'm staring at an empty space
I feel it's all over, gone without a trace
Oh, one moment held by a thread
One time to hold on to love
If I could see my way clear
And it takes me through, through the night
Just give me one chance
(Can't let it go on this way)
Just give me one chance
(Gotta get out of the rain)
Just give me one chance
(You're the one who can kill this pain)
We're worlds apart and miles away
I can't take it another day
No no no
Well, you and I have been runnin'
Running all our lives
We should have seen now, now this time comin'
Came as no surprise
One moment held back in time
The silence starts to tell the truth
Thought I'd go through it again
If it takes me back to you
You might also likeJust give me one chance
(Can't let it go on this way)
Just give me one chance
(Gotta get out of the rain)
I'm just lookin' for that one chance
(You're the one who can kill this pain)
We're worlds apart and miles away
I can't take it another
Baby, can you hear me'
Won't you stop the music for my baby?
Yeah yeah yeah now!
Ah, I wanna hear you talkin' to me now
Can you hear me talkin' to you now?
Have a little mercy, baby
Listen, baby, can you hear me now?
Oh, oh, no
One chance baby
(Can't let it go on this way)
All I need is one chance now
(Gotta get out of the rain)
Please baby, give me that one chance
(You're the one who can kill this pain)
One chance
We're worlds apart and miles away
I can't take it another day
(Can't let it go on this way, gotta get out of the rain)
Just give me one chance
(Can't let it go on this way, gotta get out of the rain)
Said that, one more chance, one more chance
One more chance, yeah yeah yeah, please baby
Can't let it go on this way
