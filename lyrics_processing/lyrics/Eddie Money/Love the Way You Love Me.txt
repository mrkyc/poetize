The taste of honeysuckle on your lips
My dusty hands
On your driving hips
Oh, and I
Love the way you love me
(Love the way you love me)
Love the way I love you, too
(Love the way I love you)
Now tell me what you wanna do
(Love the way you love me)
'Cause I love the way you love me
Yes I do
You are fed up with loving
I have started seeing two
But, gee whiz, gee whiz, I just wanna tell you
Shhh - she don't kiss me the way you do
And I
Love the way you love me
(Love the way you love me)
Love the way I love you too
(Love the way I love you)
So tell me what you wanna do

1, 2, 3, hey
Can you hear me?
Baby
Now listen, baby
I am not really jealous
And I kinda understand
But, oh God, this is just likely to kill me
I mean, when I see you with another man
Oh, I still
Love the way you love me, baby

Now tell me what we're gonna do

Can't you see that I love the way you love me?
Can't you see that I need you?
Can't you see that I want you?
Ooh, baby
I said, "Come on, come on, come on"
I said, "Come on, come on, come on, now"
