Lately, it all starts to look the same
Took a good look at myself
There was no one else to blame
Love is confusing, I hate the thought that I'm losing
And I can't hold back, 'cause you mean so much to me
I can't hold back, 'cause you give me what I need
I can't hold back, but I don't know where to start
I can't hold back, 'cause I feel it in my heart
I can't hold back, oh, no, no, I said I can't hold back, no no
Somewhere I've lost all my pride
Somewhere it's locked up inside
Everything went to my head
What's been done has been done
What's been said has been said
My heart is showing, yeah, now
Don't know if I'm comin' or goin'
And I can't hold back, 'cause you mean so much to me
I can't hold back, 'cause you give me what I need
I can't hold back, but I don't know where to start
I can't hold back now, 'cause I feel it in my heart
I can't hold back, no

'Cause I'm sinkin' deeper everyday
We've got a love, girl, worth fightin' for
Don't let the past get in the way, yeah, yeah
And I can't hold back
Ooh, oh no
I can't hold back, 'cause you mean so much to me
I can't hold back, 'cause you give me what I need
I can't hold back, but I don't know where to start
I can't hold back, no, no, I need you in my heart
I can't hold back, 'cause you mean so much to me
I can't hold back, no, no, no, you're everything I need
I can't hold back, 'cause we'll let you all be gone
