I have tracked you down through the tears that I have cried
Spent a long time waiting for you
But that's alright now I said, that's alright
I have to see for myself to believe
And now that day has come
I'm at peace with myself
I guess my story has an ending after all
Oh how, I've prayed for you
And now you've come to me
I can see the love in your eyes
And this feeling that you've given me
Is stronger than I realize
I can see the love in your eyes
My destiny has come to be
There's nothing left but blue skies for me
Hey, hey, hey, hey, yeah
I can see it, see it clearly
Out of the ashes of this fire in my heart
I've been searching for you for such a long, long time
Now suddenly I'm free to be myself
I am overwhelmed by, by the joy you've given me

And I need like anyone else
And I'm ready to give it all to you right now
Right now, now, baby
I can see the love in your eyes
And this feeling that you've given me
Is stronger than I realize now
I can see the love in your eyes
My destiny has come to me
There's nothing left but blue skies for me
Wishin' on star to star
And this miracle keeps coming home
Closer than I've ever been
I can almost see the rainbow's end
Yes, I can
Ooo, I, I can now
'Cause I bleed like anyone else
And I need like anyone else, honey
And I'm ready to give it all to you right now
Right now, now, baby
