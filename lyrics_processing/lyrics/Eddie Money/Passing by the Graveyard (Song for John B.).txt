When he played the guitar
He lost control of it
And took it too far
Until one rainy night
He never came home
She waited in the front yard
Standing all alone, all alone
Standing all alone
He was a fool
He overplayed his role
He couldn't stop
He had to go man go
He loved his whiskey
And he loved his cocaine
But he really loved that girl
And he'll never see her again
Passing by the graveyard
(Whoa, whoa, whoa)
It's lonely and it's so hard
(Whoa, whoa, whoa)
She never really goes far
(Whoa, whoa, whoa)
She's standing at the graveyard
(Whoa, whoa, whoa)
She knew the cop
She knew the doctor, too
They tried to save him
There was nothing they could do
Don't waste your life away
Like my long-lost friend
What happened to him
Can always happen again, yes it can
(Whoa, whoa, whoa)
You never have to go far
(Whoa, whoa, whoa)
It's lonely and it's so hard
(Whoa, whoa, whoa)
When you're thinking 'bout the graveyard
(Whoa, whoa, whoa)
When the cold wind blows
And it sweeps across her shoulder, yeah, yeah
Now the whole world knows
She'll never let him go
She just can't let him go
Buried him deep
In a piano box
Made sure he was lying
With the lid facing up
It's cold and lonely
And the wind sings his song
Remember him
When you're passing along
Passing by the graveyard
(Whoa, whoa, whoa)
It's lonely and it's so hard
(Whoa, whoa, whoa)
Never have to go far
(Whoa, whoa, whoa)
Thinking 'bout the graveyard
(Whoa, whoa, whoa)
Passing by the graveyard
(Whoa, whoa, whoa)
It's lonely and it's so hard
(Whoa, whoa, whoa)
Never have to go far
(Whoa, whoa, whoa)
When you're passing by the graveyard
(Whoa, whoa, whoa)
Sing it one more time
(Whoa, whoa, whoa)
Sing it one more
(Whoa, whoa, whoa)
By the graveyard
