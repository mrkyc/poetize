Love supposed to be
Surrounded by fire and magic
We long to be free
Cheating, heating up
Down on the streets of shame
To be strong enough
To fly without love
Like a phoenix from the flame
You've gotta have faith
To work it out, faith and hope
Without a doubt, give us strength
To make a start
Put a song in our heart
Never gonna break down the walls
And build a prison with the stone
'Cause you and I know
What love is worth
We're gonna build
A Heaven on Earth
Running in the
Wheels of fortune
Turning water into wine
Gonna make love the bottom line
Gonna find peace in our time
You might also likeWhoa, oh, peace in our time
Sweet, sweet darling
When there is lightning in the sky
Come out of the storm
And into the warmth of
The healing I'll supply
Gotta have faith
And get it fast, faith and hope
If you let it last, give us strength
To reach the stars
Put a song in our heart
'Cause you and I know
What love is worth
We're gonna build
A Heaven on Earth
Running in the
Wheels of fortune
Turning water into wine
Gonna make love the bottom line
Gonna find peace in our time
Whoa, oh
And the sign of the dove
Gonna shine, shine, shine
On the wing and prayer
We'll get by, by, by
Keep on keeping on
As long as our dreams are true
When cities are dust
It's Heaven or bust
In the shape of me and you
Gotta have faith (faith)
To goad us along
Now there's hope (hope)
To carry us on
Give us strength (strength)
We'll never go wrong
With this song in our hearts
Never gonna break down the walls
And build a prison with the stone
'Cause you and I know
What love is worth
We're gonna build
A Heaven on Earth
Running in the
Wheels of fortune
Turning water into wine
Gonna make love the bottom line
We're gonna find peace in our time
Never gonna
Break down the walls
And build a prison
With the stone
Cause you and I know
What love might be worth
We're gonna build
A Heaven here on Earth
We're running, running
With the wheels of fortune
Turning water, water into wine
Making love the bottom line
