Those crazy songs I heard on the radio
Rock n roll melodies drove me frantically
Soon I would be tappin' on the table
My mother would jump and shout, she'd say what's that noise about
Finally turn that dial back to her station
But I knew right then I'd turn that dial back again and I
Knew right then I would make it
Cause I wanna be a rocker
Wanna be a rocker
Wanna be a rock n roll star
Yes I wanna be a rocker
Wanna be a rocker
Wanna be a rock n roll star
When the DJ say
My music coming your way, I always waited
So I'd be shaking my hips and doing the Elvis twist
Dreaming about the day I would make it
Cause I wanna be a rocker
Wanna be a rocker
Wanna be a rock n roll star

My girlfriend thinks I'm crazy but I want to be a rock n roll star
Cause I want a mansion on the hill
I want to burn thousand dollar bills, wanna to be a rock n roll star

I pray to God
