A red dress, looking too serious
When she walsk into a room
Wearin' those high heels
Man, she makes me feel
Like a rocket that's off to the moon
She's about a mover
Hey, what can I say
She takes my breath away
Dancin' like the floor's on fire
And we're never touchin' the ground
Well, she lifts me a little bit higher
And I love when there's no comin' down
She be runnin' red hot, I can't put out the flame
She tears me up, like a hurricane
She's a rollercoaster, she's a tidal wave
She takes my breath away
Chorus:
Well, she takes (well, she takes)
Takes my breath (takes my breath)
Everytime she moves that way
All my words (all my words)
Hard to say (hard to say)
Well, she takes my breath away
You might also likeWatch out, she's like dynamite
She could go off anytime
Fascination, stimulation, uh huh
Now she's got me so hypnotized
When she moves it
I can hardly say
She takes my breath away
(Chorus)
(Na na na) Na na na
(Hey hey hey) Hey hey hey
And my heart is beatin' faster now
Oooh yeah
(Na na na) Na na na
(Hey hey hey)
Well, she takes my breath away
(Solo)
Everytime she moves around
There's no way I'm comin' down
And my heart is beatin' faster now
I can't get her off my mind
Somethin' happens everytime
Now what more can I say?
And I gotta have her, oh night and day
She takes my breath away
Well, she takes (well, she takes)
Takes my breath (takes my breath)
And I love the way she plays (come on baby play with
Me)
Every move (every move) that she makes (that she makes)
Well, she...she takes my breath away
Well, she's got (well, she's got) what it takes (what
It takes)
And I'll never be the same (never be the same now)
All my words (all my words)
Hard to say (hard to say)
'Cause she... she takes my breath away
