Baby, ask me why I'm lookin' in your eyes
With a smile on my face
I got to thinkin' 'bout the shit that had to go down
To get us both to this place
You got exes, I got exes and a string of in-betweens
Missed connection, co-rejection, guess it wasn't what it seemed, no
So baby, here we are, puzzle piece together hearts
And all I got to say

Shout out to the stupid girls, baby
Screw must have come lose kinda crazies
I don't mean to be mean
But I don't think they knew what they were losin'
Every time I'm looking at you, I can't believe
There was somebody somewhere that had you and gave you back
It's all love and admiration, I got mad appreciation
For the stupid girls

You gotta know I knew after one look at you
That was it I was done, woah
And thank Heaven every one of them
Was either blind or just dumb
You might also like
Shout out to the stupid boys, baby
Screw must have come lose kinda crazies
I don't mean to be mean
But I don't think they knew what they were losin'
Every time I'm looking at you, I can't believe
There was somebody somewhere that had you and gave you back
In that other situation, I got mad appreciation
For the stupid boys

Stupid girls (Stupid boys)
Stupid girls (Stupid boys)
Stupid girls, stupid boys
Stupid

Baby, ask me why I'm lookin' in your eyes
With a smile on your face

Shout out to the stupid girls, baby
Screw must have come lose kinda crazies
I don't mean to be mean
But I don't think they knew what they were losin'
Every time I'm looking at you, I can't believe
There was somebody somewhere that had you and gave you back
It's all love and admiration, I got mad appreciation
For the stupid girls
Stupid girls (Stupid boys)
Stupid girls (Stupid boys)
Stupid girls, stupid boys
