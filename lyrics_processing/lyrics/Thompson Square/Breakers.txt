They say you hurt the ones you love the most
Well I must be lucky you must really love me most
I guess I'll never understand why you can't be happy
If you know I'm happy no
Loving you is putting my head in the fire
Hoping that it worn't burn this time
Or the next time or the next time

Some people are leavers
Some people are stayers
Some people run when it gets too tough
Some people are braver
You're supposed to love me
Oh but I can't make it
I'm getting tired of giving all I got to a taker
Some people are fixers
But some people are breakers

I'm never gonna figure out
What I did to ya
To make me lose you're love
One to many times
That line you crossed it
And this time it cost too much
Turning your back on me way too soon
You would have thought I asked for the moon
All I needed was for you to be there
You might also like
Some people are leavers
Some people are stayers
Some people run when it gets too tough
Some people are braver
You're supposed to love me
Oh but I can't make it
I'm getting tired of giving all I got to a taker
Some people are fixers
But some people are breakers

And I give and I give
And you take and you take
And I bend and I bend
Then you break me
And I give and I give
And you take and you take
And I bend and I bend
Then you break me

Some people are leavers
Some people are stayers
Some people run when it gets too tough
Some people are braver
You're supposed to love me
Oh but I can't make it
I'm getting tired of giving all I got to a taker
Some people are fixers
But some people are breakers
And I give and I give
And you take and you take
And I bend and I bend
