Baby you're out of my league
I'm so like an old farm pick-up truck
And you deserve a limousine
And baby, I can't believe you're with me
'Cause I'm more like an old "Andy Griffith Show"
And you're so "Sex in the City" so

For the life of me I'll never figure out
What you see in me baby, why you're hanging around
Just what it is that keeps us together
'Cause we both know, you can do better
For the life of me, 'til the day I die
I'll be waking up every morning, wondering why
Right by my side is where you say you're always gonna be
For the life of me

Honey you really got it all wrong
You might be a little bit out of tune
But you're still my favorite song
Honey you got it upside down
I feel like I won the lottery
The day you rolled into town
You might also like
For the life of me I'll never figure out
What you see in me baby, why you're hanging around
Just what it is that keeps us together
'Cause we both know, you can do better
For the life of me, 'til the day I die
I'll be waking up every morning, wondering why
Right by my side is where you say you're always gonna be
For the life of me

So let's just agree to disagree
'Cause I was made for you and you were made for me
The rest don't matter, it don't matter anyway

For the life of me until the day I die
I'll be waking up every morning, wondering why
Right by my side is where you say you're always gonna be
Yeah right by my side is where you say you're always gonna be
For the life of me
