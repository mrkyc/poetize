Putting both pillows underneath my head
TV blaring all night long
Nothing but ESPN on
Picking up my buddies on a Wednesday night
Dollar beers till they turn off the light
Nobody checking in or up on me
Who you with, where you gonna be
But ooh, you make it look so good
Yeah, you got me wondering
What it might be like
Knowing every night
Who I'm waking up with
On the other side of the bed
And I never thought I'd let
Anyone ever get close enough
To make me fall in love
But ooh, you make it look so good
Lately you've been
Taking up all my time
I used to spend with
My friends talking, drinking wine
Love was never really high on my list
Baby, now you're showing me what I missed
You might also likeOoh, you make it look so good (so good)

Knowing every night
Who I'm waking up with
On the other side of the bed
And I never thought I'd let (I'd let)
Anyone ever get close enough
To make me fall in love
But ooh, you make it look so good
Woah, oh
You make it look so good
You

Girl, you got me wondering
What it might be like
Knowing every night
Who I'm waking up with
On the other side of the bed
And I never thought I'd let (I'd let)
Anyone ever get close enough
To make me fall in love
But ooh, you make it look so good
You make it look so good
You make it look so good
You make it look so good
(Yeah, yeah)
So good
Baby, you've been
Taking up all my time
I don't, I don't mind
I don't, I don't mind
You make it look so good
