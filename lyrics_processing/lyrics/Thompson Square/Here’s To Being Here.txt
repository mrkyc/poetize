We could be anywhere we want to
We're just a little blue dot on the GPS
We got all night and nowhere to get to
And it don't get no better than this

So here's to being here with you
Ain't no place that I'd rather be
Here's to being here right now, tonight
Here's to good friends, let's crank it up to ten
Live tonight like it's never gonna end
No worries, no cares, get your glasses up in the air
Here's to being here
Na na na na na na na na na na
Here's to being here
Na na na na na na na na na na

Sometimes life just smiles down on you
And everything works out just right
We're not quite sure just how we got to where we got to baby
But we're sure gonna have a good time
You might also like
So here's to being here with you
Ain't no place that I'd rather be
Here's to being here right now, tonight
Here's to good friends, let's crank it up to ten
Live tonight like it's never gonna end
No worries, no cares, get your glasses up in the air
Here's to being here

Here's to us all night
Here's to turning loose
Here's to me and here's to you
So come on, come on, come on

Here's to being here with you
Ain't no place that I'd rather be, yeah
Here's to being here right now, tonight
Here's to good friends, let's crank it up to ten
Live tonight like it's never gonna end
No worries, no cares, get your glasses up in the air

Here's to being here
