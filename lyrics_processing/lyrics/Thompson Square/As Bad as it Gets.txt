You always make us late
Messing with your make-up
And it's a big debate
If you think you're pretty enough

You laugh at all your jokes
When nobody else does
You're always sneaking smokes
And leaving the seat up

You know, you know, you know you drive me crazy
But we're gonna make it, that's a pretty safe bet
You know, you know, you know I love you baby
That's why we ain't killed each other yet
I guess we got it good, I guess we got it good
If that's as bad as it gets

Your closet's full of shoes
And clothes you never wear
Two hundred dollar do's
And you're still cussing your hair
You might also like
I hate your poker nights
Hanging here with all your buddies
And mornings walking 'round the house
In nothing but your undies

You know, you know, you know you drive me crazy
But we're gonna make it, that's a pretty safe bet
You know, you know, you know I love you baby
That's why we ain't killed each other yet
I guess we got it good, I guess we got it good
If that's as bad as it gets

You love shopping, I hate shopping
I know you go 'cause it makes me smile
When we get home, yeah when we get home
You know I know you're gonna drive me wild, yeah
Baby, baby, baby

You know, you know, you know you drive me crazy
But we're gonna make it, that's a pretty safe bet
You know, you know, you know I love you baby
That's why we ain't killed each other yet
I guess we got it good, I guess we got it good, I guess we got it good
If that's as bad as it gets
Guess we got it good
