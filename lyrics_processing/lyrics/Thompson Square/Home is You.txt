Used to be the squeak in the screen door
And the creak in the old floor
The paint peeling off the porch that
Wrapped around and 'round
Used to be the breeze through the windows
The sound of sizzle on our stove
Yeah, that was always home
Until now

That's just four walls and a front door
Some place we don't live anymore
My heart isn't in those empty rooms
As long as you're waking up with me
Baby I don't mind if every night
We lay our heads down somewhere new
'Cause home is you, home is you

I remember when it all changed
When the miles pulled us away
Like the halos of the headlights on the highway
That's me and you
It was turning our wheels 'round
In some rusted up old town
Some faded out old house
To tell the truth
You might also like
That's just four walls and a front door
Some place we don't live anymore
My heart isn't in those empty rooms
As long as you're waking up with me
Baby I don't mind if every night
We lay our heads down somewhere new
'Cause home is you
Home is you
Home is you
Home is you
'Cause home is you
[Background:
Home is you
Home is you

When I'm with you I can feel the world roll off my shoulder
And where I'm meant to be with every mile we get closer and closer
Oh you're more than four walls and a front door
Some place we don't live anymore
My heart isn't in those empty rooms
As long as you're waking up with me
Baby I don't mind if every night
We lay your heads down somewhere new

'Cause home is you
Home is you
It ain't the squeak in the screen door
Home is you
Home is you
The creak in the old floor
'Cause home is you
Home is you
We could rush to that old town
Home is you
Home is you
