We got cracks in the window (cracks in the window)
We got no money in the bank
No gas in the tank
No jingle in my drank
Baby don't you think that we could take our love and turn it into money
We'd be rolling in the door let me tell you honey
We'd be millionaires (millionaires)
You know that we'd be millionaires (throw it up in the air)
If I could bottle your kiss baby you would think
You'd be falling from the sky we could make it rain
We'd be millionaires (millionaires)
You know that we'd be millionaires (throw it up in the air)
We got Chevy envy
The kind that's lifted up high (lifted up high)
We got engine smoke, radio broke
Four bald tires rolling down the road and
We could take our love and turn it into money
We'd be rolling in the door let me tell you honey
We'd be millionaires (millionaires)
You know that we'd be millionaires (throw it up in the air)
If I could bottle your kiss baby you would think
It'd be falling from the sky we could make it rain
We'd be millionaires (millionaires)
You know that we'd be millionaires (throw it up in the air)
You might also likeI wonder what it's like to have more than you need
Hundred dollar bills hanging from the trees
Diamonds, swimming pools anything you please
Honey I'm just dreaming but if we could
Take our love and turn it into money
We'd be rolling in the door let me tell you honey
We'd be millionaires (millionaires)
You know we'd be millionaires (throw it up in the air)
If I could bottle your kiss baby you would think
It'd be falling from the sky we could make it rain
We'd be millionaires (millionaires)
You know that we'd be millionaires (throw it up in the air)
