Catfish Billy
Comin' straight out of Alabama
Yeah, that side of town with the bootleggin' to minors, hammers
Flip flop on the paint job like your mama's sandals
Prepared, got my clique, homie, I'm cockin' hammers
You pop out my lane, doggie, I drive a van and slam into your Phantom
Take a can of paint and vandalize your camper
L-A-M to the E, fuck the police
Bangin' inside the Chevy Caprice
N.W.A, I'm from the trap
Not from a little house on the prairie, yeah
Mama used to whoop that backside, I took that Bible belt
Ever since then, it's been, "Yes ma'am," and, "Mama, how can I help?"
Take a bucket to the well
Bringin' water to the house
Get your ass off of the couch
Bitch, I grew up in the South
PBJ and paper towels
Mama never did get child support for the boy, but I was never let down
She was choppin' up the pounds, so I learned how to double up on an ounce
Fuckin' kids these days (Days)
Y'all got some lip these days (Days)
Poppin' Xannies and rappin', go to your crib and play (Play)
Put that back in your fanny pack, we don't pistol wave (Wave)
So don't get mad if you get hit when that shit ricochets
No need to be macho (Yeah), I put on a rock show (Yeah)
You may see some albino gorillas from the Congo (Yeah)
You may see some black folks from the projects flexin' all gold (Yeah)
Disrespect the culture, motherfucker, then we all go
Jump in that Slumerican moshpit and bury that nonsense
Take a shot of Creek Water and get with the chaotic order of my clique
Whether I'm droppin' a pop hit or mobbin' with Three Six
I got my city on my back, a crown for a hat
I'm a king where I sit, I'm 'bout it

I bought a '53 Pontiac and then I got a guitar to match it
Everythin' manual except for the semi-automatic, hah
Pull up in traffic, my passengers look like a beauty pageant
Pupils is bigger than tennis rackets
Went from Oodles of Noodles to Cobb salads
Now I'm mob status, uh
Fuck fame, what you sayin'? These ain't games
Don't be playin' with my motherfuckin' name, ho
(Ho, you know they call me)
Top Gun, never run
Bitch, I'm maverick on the bike, magic with the pipe
Fuck her, make her cum (Uh)
She want a star (Uh)
I'm a rock and roller but my jewelry alone is a supernova
Got these glasses on me like I'm in the solar
Ain't nobody colder, call that bipolar
Tell them, "Bye, bitches," I ain't Casanova
I'm a rollin' stone, gotta meet a quota
Drank the bar until all that they had was soda
'Bout it, 'bout it like I'm from the Nolia
I'm a motherfuckin' soldier (Ayy)
Always rollin' up the doja (Ayy)
Maintain composure (Ayy)
Nickname King Cobra (Ayy)
Came from workin' at the store but (Ayy)
These brown bags not Krogers (No)
The green leaves not clovers (No)
Lucky Charms with the Folgers
Hold up, wake, bake, get my life straight
Ridin' by the lake, double X's on my license plate
(Bitch, I keep that) big bass, so they know I'm in the place
So if they wanna hate, say it to my face then
