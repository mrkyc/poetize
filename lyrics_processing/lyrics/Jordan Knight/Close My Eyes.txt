I live my days with the nights that we spent
All the love we shared
I put my heart on the side for a while
Knowing you're not here

I tried to carry on
To face the fact you're gone
But I need you
So I close my eyes

I close my eyes
And I dream about you
I close my eyes
I can almost feel you in my arms again

Mornings remind me of showers and talks
In the soft sunlight
Evenings of passion and cries of joy
Hold your memory tight

You've been away so long
And I sing so many songs about you
I just close my eyes
You might also like
I close my eyes
And I dream about you (Oh, I dream about you)
I close my eyes
I can almost feel you in my arms again

When I close my eyes, I'm a kid again
I can think about the time we became best friends
And we're playing in the park, didn't have a care
Then you smiled at me and I knew right there
I would hold your hand, it would be the start
Of a promise that no other lover'd steal my heart
Now the pain of losing you I just can't erase
But when I close my eyes it's a better place

No, no one really sees
You're watching over me
And I hope you feel me watching over you
And when you go to sleep
I pray the Lord will keep
You in my dreams
When I close my eyes

I close my eyes (My eyes)
And I dream about you (Dream about you in my life)
I close my eyes (Ooh baby)
I can almost feel you in my arms again
I close my eyes
And I dream about you (Every day, I dream about you)
I close my eyes (And I can dream about you)
