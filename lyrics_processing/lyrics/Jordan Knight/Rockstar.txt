I saw a difference in her from any other
She stood alone
She was five-foot-something
But ten feet taller than me
She had her thing on her own
She didn't need nobody to take her home
But she knew what she was doing
When she got into it
It started to turn me on, yeah

Like she wore it off the runway
Like she just stepped off a plane
Straight out a movie scene
Like she owns the crowd
Can't help but look at her now
She's a cover of a magazine

She's got a body like a rockstar
Look at her put on a show
She's got a body like a rockstar
You can put her on a stage and let her go
She can entertain you all night
She won't be able to fight
Begging for the encore (Begging for the encore)
So put your lighters in the sky
She's in the spotlight
Yeah, that girl's a rockstar
That girl's a rockstar
You might also like
I'm in a daze, I'm truly amazed
I've become a fan (I've become a fan)
She's got me hanging off of every word
Hanging off of every curve
Tonight, she's in demand
I'm in love with the feeling
That she's giving as she works the room
She's not restricted, where did she get it?
I'm so addicted (Addicted) to her
(She looks, oh)

Like she wore it off the runway
Like she just stepped off a plane
Straight out a movie scene
(Straight out a movie scene)
And she owns the crowd
Can't help but look at her now
She's a cover of a magazine

She's got a body like a rockstar
Look at her put on a show
(Look at her put on a show)
She's got a body like a rockstar
You can put her on a stage and let her go
She can entertain you all night
Won't be able to fight
Begging for the encore (Begging for the encore)
So put your lighters in the sky
She's in the spotlight
Yeah, that girl's a rockstar
That girl's a rockstar
Rock, rock, rock your body, baby, baby, oh yeah
Said she's a rockstar
Just rock, rock, rock your body on me, baby, oh yeah
Said she's a rockstar
Rock, rock, rock your body, baby, for me, oh yeah
Said she's a rockstar
Just rock, rock, rock your body, baby

Yeah, she's got a body like a rockstar
Look at her put on a show (Do it, girl)
She's got a body like a rockstar
You can put her on a stage and let her go (Yeah)
She can entertain you all night
Won't be able to fight (No)
Begging for the encore (Begging for the encore)
So put your lighters in the sky, she's in the spotlight
Yeah, that girl's a rockstar
