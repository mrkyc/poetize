One day I just can't forget
I follow you, you follow me
We left footprints on the beach
You're so wrong, you're so right
I can see us bathing in the moonlight
Can you, can you see, see it, see it too
(This is what I wanna do)
I wanna search for sea shells on the sea shore
I'm a serve you like a cabana boy
I wanna take you out till the tide comes in
Then we can do it over again
Like a wave, baby, I never even saw it coming
You crashed over me
And I'm never gonna be the same
I can't deny it, I won't fight it
So I'm a ride this till it breaks
You got a hold of me and you pulled me under, babe
You're love is like a wave
Vacation's over
Girl, we had to say goodbye
But I can't get over us
Wish I could text you from this flight
I would tell you
You are the best thing
Let's make reservations for next spring
Right now, baby, right now
I'm already in the middle of booking my flight now

I'm a serve you like a cabana boy
I wanna take you out till the tide comes in
Then we can do it over again
Like a wave baby
I never even saw it coming
You crashed over me
And I'm never gonna be the same
I can't deny it, I won't fight it
So I'm a ride this till it breaks
You got a hold of me
And you pulled me under, babe
You're love is like a wave
Until we meet again
I'm a keep your picture in my cell phone
(digital wallpaper, ring tone)
Our song takes me back every time it's on baby
I guess you got me in a rip zone
Life guard's telling me, I'm in too deep (too deep, too deep)
Oh but right now there's no place I'd rather be
And that's when it hits me
Oh oh oh (like a wave)
Like a wave, baby, I never even saw it coming
You crashed over me
And I'm never gonna be the same
I can't deny it, I won't fight it
So I'm a ride this till it breaks
You got a hold of me and you pulled me under, babe
Like a wave, baby, (oh like a wave)
I never even saw it coming (like a wave)
You crashed over me
And I'm never gonna be the same (I can't deny it)
I can't deny it, I won't fight it
So I'm a ride this till it breaks
(I am gonna ride it till it breaks)
You got a hold of me and you pulled me under, babe
