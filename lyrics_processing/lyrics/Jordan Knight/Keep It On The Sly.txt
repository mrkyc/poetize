Keep It On The Sly
Yeah, oh oh
(you know what-listen up)
I've got a girl
You've got a man
But the beat is hot
And i'm feelin' good tonight
I know it's hard
To understand
But i just can't stop
Regardless what is right
I won't tell if you won't tell (yeah)
I know just keep it low
So why we makin' out on the dance floor, girl
I won't tell if you won't tell
You know nobody gotta know
But by the way we're acting, we don't care no more
(and we are out of control)
Out of control
(we've got to keep it on the sly)
Keep it on the sly
(i don't wanna get caught-no)
Want to get caught-no
(wanna keep it on the sly)
Keep it on the sly
I wanna turn out your body
All i really want to do is party
But damn, i'm lovin' your body
Your body
That's it girl, i can't take it no more
Take ya home do it on the living room floor
Do it all night 'til i can no more
But we gotta be on the low for sure, for sure
I won't tell if you won't tell
I know just keep it low
So why we makin' out on the dance floor, girl
I won't tell if you won't tell
You know nobody gotta know
But by the way we're acting, we don't care no more
(and we are out of control)
Out of control
(we've got to keep it on the sly)
Keep it on the sly
(i don't wanna get caught-no)
Want to get caught-no
(wanna keep it on the sly)
Keep it on the sly
Girl, the situations rough
But i can't get enough
Can't help it if you're always on my mind
We gotta be discreet, you and me
'cause somebody may see
And we don't want that to be
Yeah, i like this
I know you want to touch
But, keep this on the hush
(baby, we're out of control)
Out of control
(we've got to keep it on the sly)
Keep it on the sly
(i don't wanna get caught-no)
Want to get caught-no
(wanna keep it on the sly)
Keep it on the sly
(baby, we're out of control)
Out of control
(we've got to keep it on the sly)
Keep it on the sly
(i don't wanna get caught-no)
Want to get caught-no
(wanna keep it on the sly)
