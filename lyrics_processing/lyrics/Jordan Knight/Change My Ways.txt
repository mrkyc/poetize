I've seen the crystal ball
I've got a lot to mend, yeah
I drank a thousand nights
I had a million friends, yeah
I watched the world go 'round
At speeding light and then
Sometimes she walks the hall
I hope it never ends, yeah

Ooh, no other woman gets to me the way you do
(Ooh, and baby, you know)
Baby, I would change my ways
If I could be with you
(Ooh, and baby, you know)
Make me your lover (Make me your lover)
I'll make your dreams come true
(I'll make your dreams come true, ooh, and you know)
Baby I would change my ways
If I could be with you (Be with you)

Sometimes it takes a light
To see the room you're in, ooh yeah, yeah
You got it all until
You recognize the sin
I don't wanna use the sun
To melt away my blues, ooh
Ooh, I need you to keep me warm
And give me something true
Ooh, and baby, you know
You might also like
Ooh, no other woman gets to me the way you do
(Ooh, baby, you do)
Baby, I would change my ways
If I could be with you
(Girl, let me be the one you fall in love with)
Make me your lover (Make me your lover)
I'll make your dreams come true
(I'll make your dreams come true
I'll make your dreams come true)
Baby, I would change my ways
If I could be with you (If I could be with you)

When she walks, I hope it never ends, yeah, yeah
I've seen the crystal ball
And I've got a lot to mend
Do you save a helpless flame
Or rather watch it burn, ooh yeah
I need to read from you
'Cause I've got a lot to learn

No other woman gets to me the way you do
(Ooh, and baby, you know)
Baby, I would change my ways
If I could be with you
(Girl, let me be the one you've had enough of)
Make me your lover (Girl, make me your lover)
I'll make your dreams come true
(I'll make your dreams come true
I'll make your dreams come true)
Baby, I would change my ways
(Baby, I would change my ways for you)
If I could be with you (If I could be with you)
No other woman gets to me the way you do
Baby, I would change my ways
If I could be with you
Make me your lover
I'll make your dreams come true
Baby, I would change my ways
