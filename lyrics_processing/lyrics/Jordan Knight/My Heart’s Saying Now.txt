How you live in my dreams, my dreams
Something about your smile
Starts the butterflies inside me
Maybe you don't see
The two of us like I do, I do
But no one wants you more
Than this dreamer standing right beside you
Whatever it takes
I'm taking it all the way
Now it's all or nothing
Never gonna find me a better day
Never gonna love any other way
Baby my heart's saying now
Hoping that I waited for the right time
Praying for the words that'll make you mine
Baby I'm shaking
But my heart's saying now
When I think of you
My heart takes a tumble, tumble
If I could have one wish
The walls around your heart would crumble
I've waited for so long
Until the perfect moment came along
Don't let me be invisible
Tell me girl
Is it me you really want?

I'm taking it all the way
Now it's all or nothing
Never gonna find me a better day
Never gonna love any other way
Baby my heart's saying now
Hoping that I waited for the right time
Praying for the words that'll make you mine
Baby I'm shaking
But my heart's saying now
Tell me now, my baby
I need to know, you drive me crazy
All night, i think about you
Now i'm telling you, telling you the way that i feel
Cuz i know it's for real
Whatever it takes, whatever it takes
I'm taking it all the way
Now it's all or nothing
Never gonna find me a better day
Never gonna love any other way
Baby my heart's saying now
Hoping that I waited for the right time
Praying for the words that'll make you mine
Baby I'm shaking
But my heart's saying now
(in the background)
Never gonna find me a better day
Never find me a better day
Never gonna love any other way
Never love any other way
Baby my heart's saying now, heart's saying now
Hoping that I waited for the right time
Baby when my heart's saying now
Praying for the words that'll make you mine, ohhhhh
Baby I'm shaking
