It ain't the same
I was givin' you the chance to prove me wrong
But all along you just dug a hole deeper
I'm done with tryna figure you out
You played with my lovin' now you got nothin'
Bet you never saw this comin'
'Cause everyday your tearin' me apart
So everything I gave you from my heart
Kiss it away (you might as well just)
Kiss it away (so turn the lights out)
Put your lips like this and close you eyes
Time to kiss our love goodbye
Just kiss it away(you might as well just)
Kiss it away
You are not who you portray
In any way such a beautiful
Disguise the smile I had
Left me with a hangover
Till I finally I figured you out
You played with my lovin' now you got nothin'
Bet you didn't see this comin'
'Cause everyday your tearin' me apart
So everything I gave you from my heart
Kiss it away (you might as well just)
Kiss it away (so turn the lights out)
Put your lips like this and close you eyes
Time to kiss our love goodbye
Just kiss it away(you might as well just)
Kiss it away
You might also likeI knew it was a matter of time
Before it came to this
It took alot of courage to say
I'm done with this, so long baby
I got alot to do and I
I really wish the best for you girl
Just accept this kiss goodbye, oh whoa oh oh
'Cause everyday your tearin' me apart
So everything I gave you from my heart
Kiss it away (you might as well just)
Kiss it away (so turn the lights out)
And put your lips like this and close you eyes
Time to kiss our love goodbye
Just kiss it away (you might as well just)
Kiss it away, just kiss it away
(Kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss) kiss it away
(Kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss) kiss it away
(Kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss) kiss it away
