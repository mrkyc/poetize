Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Alright, alright, alright, Jo
Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, listen
Candles lit, moonlight, diamond ring, your smile
Accentuates everything about you
On top of that we're alone, no phone, nobody home
So we could do anything we want to, alright
I can't stop, I can't wait
'Cause it feels like our very first date
And when you glow
That's when I know for sure
I love you, I love you
More than anybody in the world can love you
Clearly 'cause you're with me
I'm a better man that I thought I'd ever be
I found out the way to have your cake and eat it too
Convincing your heart to let me have you
You feel me? Yeah
Fortunately I got a chance
But one day we can have that dance
In front of friends, family, together happily
Forever we'll be
You might also likeTruth be told, I gotta know
Would you love me
The same body, mind and soul
I want you to make this official with me, yeah
I can't stop, I can't wait
'Cause it feels like our very first date
And when you glow
That's when I know for sure
I love you, I love you
More than anybody in the world can love you
Clearly 'cause you're with me
I'm a better man that I thought I'd ever be
I found out the way to have your cake and eat it too
Convincing your heart to let me have you
Yeah, yeah, yeah
If you find it in your mind for you to trust me
God knows I would never do anything to tarnish you
You are the one for me, you make it all complete
So I gotta make you see, I gotta make you see
I love you, I love you
More than anybody in the world can love you
Clearly 'cause you're with me
I'm a better man that I thought I'd ever be
I found out the way to have your cake and eat it too
Convincing your heart to let me have you
Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
I love you, I love you
More than anybody in the world can love you
Clearly 'cause you're with me
I'm a better man that I thought I'd ever be
