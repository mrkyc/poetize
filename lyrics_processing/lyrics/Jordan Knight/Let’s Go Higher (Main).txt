You are rattling my world like an earthquake
I'm up in the clouds like ooo oo ooo oo
Somebody bring me down yeah
I'm trying to keep you here where it feels great
But i don't know how to dooo oo ooo oo
I'm losing solid ground, again
(Pre-Chorus)
Don't pinch me
I'm falling in love, and if I'm dreaming
Let's baby then don't wake me up
You got me hoping and wishing
That this could last for one more night
(Chorus)
Baby you and me
We can take it to the middle of the dance floor
I got what you need
Tell the DJ keep it spinning on the dance floor
And let's go higher, let's go higher
And let's go high
Let's go higher, let's go higher
Lets go high
(get high off of love)

You can set it off if you want it
All you gotta do is ooo oo ooo oo
Your body's calling me, again
And i don't wanna have any regrets
When I'm next to you
Its like ooo oo ooo oo
Your touch is all i need, oh yeah
(Pre-Chorus)
Don't pinch me
I'm falling in love, and if I'm dreaming
Let's baby then don't wake me up
You got me hoping and wishing
That this could last for one more night
(Chorus)
Baby you and me
We can take it to the middle of the dance floor
I got what you need
Tell the DJ keep it spinning on the dance floor
And let's go higher, let's go higher
And let's go high
Let's go higher, let's go higher
Lets go high
(get high off of love)
(Bridge)
Like a roller coaster
Take me up and let me fall
Just as long as you're by my side
I'll go through it all
(get high off of love)
(Chorus)
Baby you and me
We can take it to the middle of the dance floor
I got what you need
Tell the DJ keep it spinning on the dance floor
And let's go higher, let's go higher
And let's go high
Let's go higher, let's go higher
Lets go high
(get high off of love)
Baby, get high off of love
Get high off of love
