I feel like the world is on my head
I don't wanna lose what made me a man
Still when I call your name
I'll wait, you'll say you're so far away

Now that I feel the well so dry
(Now that it's dry)
I need you to fill me up inside (Fill me inside)
Baby, you turn me on and on
(You know you turn me on and on and on)

Just wanna hold you
I'm dying to show you
Don't run from me (Don't run)
Don't turn your back on me (Turn your back on me)
We're getting closer
Don't say that it's over
Don't run from me
Don't turn your back on me (Don't turn your back)
Come out of the dark
Don't tear us apart
Don't run from my heart, ooh
You might also like
It took me some time to understand
What all along I held in my hands
If you give me one more chance
I'll prove, I'm true to you

Now every night it seems so wrong (It seems so wrong)
I'm here all alone where you belong (Where you belong)
Girl, let me turn you on and on
(Baby, let me turn you on and on and on, yeah)

Just wanna hold you
I'm dying to show you (I'm dying to show you)
Don't run from me (Don't run)
Don't turn your back on me (Don't run from me)
We're getting closer
Don't say that it's over (Don't run)
Don't run from me (Don't run)
Don't turn your back on me (Oh)
Come out of the dark (Oh yeah)
Don't tear us apart (Oh yeah)
Don't run from my heart, ooh

I'm such a dreamer
When I'm sleeping, I'm thinking of you
A million roses, waterfalls, around a bed for two
(Around a bed for two)
Sippin' booze with the best, babe
I'm not here for the rest, babe
Need your candlelight, sweet love tonight
I can't afford to lose you, oh no, oh no
Ooh, oh, oh
Come out of the dark
Don't tear us apart
Don't tear us apart
Don't tear us apart
Just wanna hold you
I'm dying to show you
Don't run from me
Don't turn your back on me (Oh no)
We're getting closer
Don't say that it's over
Don't run from me
Don't turn your back on me
Just wanna hold you (Don't run)
I'm dying to show you (Oh no)
Don't run from me (Don't turn your back)
Don't turn your back on me (Don't run from me)
We're getting closer (Getting close)
Don't say that it's over (You know)
Don't run from me (You just stay)
Don't turn your back on me

Don't run from me
Don't turn your back on me
Don't run from me
