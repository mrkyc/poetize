Only found in dreams
He is the kind of man
Who leaves your heart to bleed
Let me wipe your tears
Protect your fears
And make you feel like you can love again
Baby I'm here waiting for you to call me in
Can I come over tonight

Can I come over tonight (baby)

And what can I do
To make it alright for you
Tonight, can I come over tonight

I saw you with him
And he could not have treated you worse
Like he was ashamed
To be holding a goddess of the earth
