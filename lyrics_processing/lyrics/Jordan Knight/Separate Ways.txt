It's a big step, when you fall in
And every single touch says
How you need it, can you feel me
It comes on a whirlwind
And it blows in, like a hurricane
Till you wonder where you are
And how you got so far
I'll be with you
When we go our separate ways
You'll be with me
When we go our separate ways
I have to believe when you're fast asleep
I'll still be the first one in your dreams
'Cause I'll be with you
When we go our separate ways
We had to find a way out
For escaping, from the faking
Put our open hearts up
Not expecting they'd be taken
You know that I will always
Take you with me, when I don't know where to go
You know that you will always be the answer
To the questions I don't know
You might also likeI'll be with you
When we go our separate ways
You'll be with me
When we go our separate ways
Baby sometimes I get so excited
The night that we met
I was bursting inside
We know that
It must have been fate
That we found it too late
A special relationship died
And I hate that night
It was so good when
It felt like it should
Are the ones that we can't have again
When times just get too tough
And we've both had enough
Maybe we'll find out
That we're still in love
I'll be with you
When we go our separate ways
You'll be with me
When we go our separate ways
I have to believe when you're fast asleep
I'll still be the first one in your dreams
'Cause I'll be with you
When we go our separate ways
Even though I know you should be living at home with me
I'll be with you
When we go our separate ways
You'll be with me
