No matter what you do
If I let you down, just tell me now
And I'll fix it like a man's supposed to
What part of I know we can work, don't you understand
Maybe I'm just making it worse, but I can't let go of your hand
Let's fix it, let's fix it all
Baby stop, right there, take a breath, no it's not too late
To wait, search yourself, before you steal, steal my life away
You don't want to try this time, I'm here to fight this crime
Don't you leave me empty hearted, girl don't leave this love of ours
Unfinished, unfinished, unfinished whoa oh oh
How can you complicate what I see so clear
Maybe you're just scared
But if you run away in fear
That just won't be fair
So close your lips and don't say those words
I know you want to say
Just let me kiss you anywhere it hurts
Tell me where to start first

To wait, search yourself, before you steal, steal my life away
You don't want to try this time, I'm here to fight this crime
Don't you leave me empty hearted, girl don't leave this love of ours
Unfinished, unfinished, unfinished whoa oh oh
Unfinished, unfinished, unfinished whoa oh oh
Just think it over, for a minute
We'd be losing so much, so much, so much
If you didn't stop, right there, take a breath, no it's not too late
To wait, search yourself, before you steal, steal my life away
You don't want to try this time, I'm here to fight this crime
Don't you leave me empty hearted, girl don't leave this love of ours
Unfinished, unfinished, unfinished whoa oh oh
