Sitting here waiting for tomorrow
All because of yesterday
I wish I had all the answers
For all the things you had to say
I wanna come and change your mind girl
No more lies and no more games
I never thought of missing you, I never thought I'd need you
Before you left tonight
Since I can't be kissing you and since I won't be holding you
Will it be alright?
And how can you just say we're though after all this time
I'm standing here with open arms the thought just crossed my mind
Where is your heart tonight?
Your heart tonight?
Feeling a little loneliness and sorrow
I only have myself to blame
Had a good girl and I lost her
I start to cry and feel ashamed
I wanna come and change your mind girl
No more lies and no more games

Before you left tonight
Since I can't be kissing you and since I won't be holding you
Will it be alright?
And how can you just say we're though after all this time
I'm standing here with open arms the thought just crossed my mind
Where is your heart tonight?
I'll never understand what ever happened to us
What ever happened to us
Our love was like summer the sun always shining above
Ooh yeah, then all the rain came crashing down
And I can't turn this thing around without you
I never thought of missing you, I never thought I'd need you
Before you left tonight
Since I can't be kissing you and since I won't be holding you
Will it be alright?
And how can you just say we're though after all this time
I'm standing here with open arms the thought just crossed my mind
