95, Jordan Knight
Remix, so tight, so slick
You ain't know, y'all ready
Here we go
G, grab it if you want it
I, need a lot of time
V, very high maintence
E-P-E oh can't you see
I cream a body all the time
You shy, I wish you were mine
True it's all about you
Give it to me and I'll give it you
I'ma say it again
Like I said before
Dirty South coming through
Oh you ain't know
I'ma give it to you
And I got you boo
Cause I ain't never seen a girl as fine as you
I got it, we can get it
Cause babygirl you are with it
So holla at me baby cause you know my name
Take a trip down South and we can do that thing

You say it's been too long
Since you had some
Would you say I turn you on
Like the fire that's burning inside
You think that I'm the one
You see in your dreams
I know what you mean, yeah
Its creeping around in your head
Me holding you down in my bed
You don't have to say a word (shhh!)
I'm convinced you want this
1 - Baby you know I can give it to you
I can't deny I'd do it right
Just let me know and I'll give it to you
Show me where I'll taste you there
Baby you know and I'll give it to you
Your body needs a man like me
Anything goes when I give it to you
Without a doubt I'll turn you out
(You know I'll give it to you)
The feeling is fine, giving you everything of mine
I'm the place to be
And soon you'll see
I don't care who leads
As long as we move horizontally
Anyone can make you sweat
But I can keep you wet
Its creeping around in my head
Me holding you down in my bed
I can't wait to give you some
I'm convinced you need it
Repeat 1

You don't have to say a word
Just relax, I'll do the work
I can't wait to give you some
I'm convinced you need one
Baby you know I can give it to you
I can't deny I'd do it right
Just let me know and I'll give it to you
Show me where I'll taste you there
Baby you know and I'll give it to you
Your body needs a man like me
Anything goes when I give it to you
Without a doubt I'll turn you out
(I'll give it to you)
I want to satisfy your every wish and mine baby
I know just what you need and I could get you off baby
No one could ever do you like I do you right baby
There's nothing we can't do once we're together, oh baby
