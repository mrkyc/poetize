I see you doing me and baby this thing is twang, twang
I think I'm just about to make my move somehow
I got a proposition, let me buy you what you're sipping

I don't mean to rush you
I don't want you to feel pressure
It's just a question and if the answer is no
I'll wait all night, girl, I could wait all night
Till the feeling's right, girl I can wait all night
See her working all around, I'm losing control
When you go up N down, up N down
I like it when you keep me guessing
Got me acting like an adolescent
Up N down, up N down
Up, up, up, I want down
And when you go up, up
It goes down
Oh when you go up, up
I go down
When I move up, up
It goes down, oh
It's gettin' after dark
Let's take this way too far
Jump on my spaceship
I'll make you so you see the stars
Lights will hit you right
Reflecting of your backside
And girl, I kinda like how
You do, do, do, do it
You might also like
Up, up, up, go down
And when I go up, up
It goes down
Oh when you go up, up
I go down and when I go up, up
It goes down, oh
Your body's working, baby
I like how you work it, girl
Your body's working, baby
I'm working your body, girl
Your body is working, baby
I like how you work it, girl
Your body is working
'Cause I'm working your body, girl
(Let's go)
See her working all around, I'm losing control
When you go up N down, up N down
I like it when you keep me guessing
Got me acting like an adolescent
Up N down, up N down
Up, up, up, I'll go down
And when I go up, up
It goes down
Oh when you go up, up
I go down and when I go up, up
