First lonely night
What will I do?
I feel my heart breaking in two
I'm such a fool
When will I learn?
I fell so deep
Then I got burned

If you gave me just one reason why
My heart just might let go
Maybe one day I will fall in love again
But for now I'll just leave my heart in two

If I never fall in love again
If I never touch your skin again
If I never feel again this way
If I never see another day
Remember me, remember this
'Cause one thing that will never change
Is the feeling in my heart
So broken by you
Oh, oh, yeah
You might also like
Love still remains
After you're gone
Girl, please explain
Where did I go wrong?

If you gave me just one reason why
My heart just might let go
Maybe one day I will fall in love again
But for now I'll just leave my heart in two

If I never fall in love again (Never)
If I never touch your skin again (Never)
If I never feel again this way (Never)
If I never see another day
Remember me, remember this
'Cause one thing that will never change
Is the feeling in my heart
Hmm, this melody reminds me of you

La, la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La, la-la-la, la-la-la-la
I can't let go
If you gave me just one reason why
My heart just might let go
Maybe one day I will fall in love again
Maybe one day I will fall in love again
Maybe one day I will fall in love again
Never fall in love again
Never pass this way again
Never, never, never will fall in love again
Never fall in love again
Never pass this way again
Never, never, never will fall in love again
Never had my heart broken by you
