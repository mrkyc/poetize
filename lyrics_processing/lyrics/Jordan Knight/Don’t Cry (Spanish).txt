Ma what's the problem..Blige gone fix it
Take you on a trip, on a Caribbean ship tip
Chanel the lipstick..More Prada than hips get..
Gucci for ya eyes..Gabbana the mistress
I need ya interest..Ya leave me speechless
More like butterflies..Got his eye on my weakness
Ya needs to keep this..
The way I freak this..
Hit ya in the spot..baby leavin you sleepless
I can't believe this..The block is heated..
Dance for me mommy, baby, papi he needs it
The top I peeped it..the bra release it..
Shake it for me mommy, you the bomb believe it..
The Don I keeped it
The Cris we popped it
Work it on the dance floor, mommy don't stop it..
The drop I copped it..my motto is shop it
Roll with me mommy, pick it up, and drop it
So we can get it on..if we can break it down..
If we can get it right.. we can get it on tonight
If we can get it on..if we can break it down..
If we would work it right.. we can get it on tonight...we can get it on tonight
Don't Cryyyyyyyyyyy
Your bad, bad, bad, so bad
