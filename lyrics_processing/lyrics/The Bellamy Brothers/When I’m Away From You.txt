My thoughts won't move from the way I feel
It happens time and time again
And the circle never ends
When I'm away from you
Well it hurts to say
My sense has gone so far away
I'm up all through the night
And I can't tell wrong from right
When I'm away from you I see great big clouds
In the fog and rain all the lonely crowds
They seem to be so blue
Every night I'm missing you
When I'm away from you well the sun don't shine
The mood don't come
The words don't rhyme
When I'm away from you I can't let go
And you know, oh, you know
It's all the things you do that make life worth while
Like the way you talk and the way you smile
It's all the things you do keep me hanging on
And you know, don't you know
