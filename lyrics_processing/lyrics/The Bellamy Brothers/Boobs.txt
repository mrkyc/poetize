To tell you the truth my darlin' you're the only reason I came
But your beauty's so distractin' hope it don't lead to my demise
Can you please tell your boobs to stop lookin' at my eyes
They're playing crummy rap music and there ain't even a band
And I wouldn't even be here but you hold my heart in your hands
So before I lose my cool and start actin' like them other dirty guys
Would you please tell your boobs to stop lookin' at my eyes
Yo there brother we're giving' you a shout
Got the bitches in stitches and we're all hangin' out
Lookin' good in the hood tell you what it's all about
Shoot that rapper and let the guitar player play
If it wasn't for the alcohol I would be quoting Voltaire
But with that cute rocking' bod' of yours I can't do nothin' but stare
Let's go to your place baby stay up and watch the sun rise
But first please tell your boobs to stop lookin' at my eyes
I'll be your sex object I'll be your good ol' boy toy
We'll have the perfect redneck wedding then a little bundle of joy
And somewhere down the road we'll look back and we'll laugh about this night
When I said tell your boobs to stop lookin' at my eyes
Yeah later down the road we'll look back and we'll laugh about this night
Yes we will  right now won't you tell your boobs to stop lookin' at my eyes
