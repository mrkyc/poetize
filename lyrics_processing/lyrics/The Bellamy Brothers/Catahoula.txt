Well I left Okeechobee I was on a quest
Stopped at Weeki Wachee where the mermaids nest
I seen Sopchoppy, I turned it left
I hit Apalachicola, headed west

Crossed two more states and a drivin' rain
Finally reached Lake Pontchartrain
In the bayou town I found my dream
In the purtiest hound you ever seen

Catahoula, best friend I ever had
I scratch his ear and he brings my beer and comforts me when I'm sad
My cajun queen went to New Orleans, spent up all my moolah
Well I don't give a damn I'm a happy man I got a dog called Catahoula

In a plywood shack eatin' etouffee
Drinkin Dixie beer passin' time away
If the sun goes down on a lazy day
It's time to dance while the 'cordian plays

We'll hunt them 'possums by a southern moon
Just to hear 'em bark makes a-my heart swoon
From the Atchafalaya to the Chandeleur
The zydeco rhythm and my old pal Blue

Well the crawfish boil and the alligators bark
Oh I want a little more tobasco sauce
That sawin' fiddle sure feels fine
I'll sing his praises one more time
