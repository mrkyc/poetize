You run but I'm always a step ahead
I'm a stalker you embrace while dread
I'm not your lover
You're not my only one
I'm not your child but you made me
Your creation, your enemy
That one thing you'll regret forevermore
You can't destroy what I have become
Too little too late, damage's done
From here on out its torture while I laugh I laugh
And you will cry

Cause and effect and then you die
There's more to pain than meets the eye
I'm deep inside you and you're mine
So take this to your mind

I am dominant
Vile, too malevolent
The more you suffer I hurt
I'll get under your skin
When you scream I hurt
Mother fucker I'm pain
You might also like
I give you life, then you take mine?
Don't forget you were the partner in crime
I might be your slave but you're not my god
You're neither inside my head nor fiction
My malady my affliction
The cross I carry
On my knees until you laugh
And then I cry

Cause and effect and then you die
There's more to pain than meets the eye
I'm deep inside you and you're mine
So take this to your mind

I surrender
Got no fight left in me to render
I wanna forget
You remember?
I gave you a go
The light's now green
All you gotta do is kill me
But you keep me alive
To reap what you sew
Just let me go
Let me go
Cause and effect and then you die
There's more to pain than meets the eye
I'm deep inside you and you're mine
So take this to your mind

I am dominant
Vile, too malevolent
The more you suffer I hurt
I'll get under your skin
When you scream I hurt
Mother fucker I'm the end
I am dominant
Vile, too malevolent
The more you suffer I hurt
I'll get under your skin
When you scream I hurt
