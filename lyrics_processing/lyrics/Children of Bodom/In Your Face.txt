Conflict, terror, hear the noise
You're on the edge of a nerve-racking force
But, oh, my god, here's the fight
Never siege, never riot, must defy
Well look at me, what do you see?
Another trophy, a living fucking dead beat
Close your eyes take a step with me
You're gone but it's not too late
Exhibiting Abnormality
Careful what you call reality
But you will always forget
One thing I'd like you to know
I don't give a flying fuck motherfucker
I don't give a flying fuck motherfucker
I don't give a flying
I don't give a flying
I don't give a flying FUCK
I'll never wait for any interference
When the other people talk all over my shit
But do I speak thee, yes I do
So fuck hypocrisy and fuck you too

Say one, more word, I double dare you (bring it on)
It's my world, you're in it, it'll take you down in a minute
You can alter your look, diversify your age
But the truth seems like a bitchslap in your face
