Sometimes it's the night
And the way it seems to cry
And whisper terrifying secrets in your ear
Sometimes it's the day
And the sun has got no mercy
Lighting up and burning everything that's in its way
There are times I gotta run
Times I gotta hide
Things I've left undone
Things I've cast aside
So many things to try
So many things denied
If I ever tell you the truth
I'd swear you would leave me
I need the proof
That you would believe me
(Karla DeVito)
You think I fly like an angel without any tears
Higher and higher, above the world and all its fears
(Ellen Foley)
Everybody's ready to fly
But the storms are never so very far

Let's run away
Let's go so far
(Meat Loaf)
There are secrets I never can tell
There are shadows of darkness in heaven
There are so many suburbs of hell
And their hours are 24/7
There are so many wounds you can't heal
So many nightmares are turning too real
So much of paradise lost and you add up the cost
But there's nothing to be sorry for
Now we can feel so much more
Now I can be loving you
Nothing that we're scared to do
(Ellen Foley)
You see me smile and you swear that I could walk on air
You see me dancing, the moonlight glancing at my hair
You see me as powerfully strong
But the nightmare's never so very far
(Karla DeVito)
And you think my life is shining like a star
But the tears are never very far
The fears are never very far
And...
(All)
We always seem so much braver than we ever are
We always seem to be braver but we never are
(Karla DeVito & Ellen Foley)
Let's fly away
Let's go too far
(Karla DeVito)
Sometimes it's the flesh
And the way it seems to yearn
For all the magic of the single perfect touch
(Ellen Foley)
Sometimes it's the soul
And it's waiting for salvation
You know when you get it
There can never be too much
(Karla DeVito & Ellen Foley)
There are times I gotta run
Times I gotta hide
Things I've left undone
Things I've cast aside
So many things to try
So many things denied
If I ever tell you the truth
Would you ever believe me?
Show me the proof
I'm so scared you would leave me
(Meat Loaf)
You think I fly like an angel without any care
Higher and higher, as if I'm breathing sacred air
(Meat Loaf & Karla DeVito)
Everybody's ready to fly
But the storms are never so very far
And you think my life is shining like a star
But the fears are never very far
Or the nightmare's never very far

We always dream we seem braver but we never are
Let's run away
Let's go too far
