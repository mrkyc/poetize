Whatever happened to
Saturday Night
When you dressed up sharp
And you felt all right?
It don't seem the same
Since cosmic light
Came into my life
I thought I was divine
I used to go for a ride
With a chick who'd go
And listen to the music
On the radio
A saxophone was blowin'
On a rock 'n' roll show
You climbed in the back seat
Really had a good time

Hot patootie, bless my soul
I really love that rock and roll
Hot patootie, bless my soul
I really love that rock and roll

My head it used to swim
From the perfume I smelt
My hands kinda fumbled with her
White plastic belt
I'd taste her baby-pink lipstick
And that's when I'd melt
She'd whisper in my ear
Tonight she really was mine
Get back in front
Put some hair oil on
Buddy Holly was singing
His very last song
With your arms around your girl
You try to sing along
You felt pretty good. Woo!
Really had a good time!
Hot patootie, bless my soul
I really love that rock and roll
Hot patootie, bless my soul
I really love that rock and roll
Hot patootie, bless my soul
I really love that rock and roll
Hot patootie, bless my soul
I really love that rock and roll
