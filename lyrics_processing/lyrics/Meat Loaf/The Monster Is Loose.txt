I've been living my life in a cage
Freedom spit in my face, it was such a disgrace
And I was lonely
Burnt out and empty, desperate
I had my head in a noose
I had nothing to lose, had enough of abuse
So now I'm dangerous
Hate's so contagious, it owns us

I'm angry (I'm angry), I'm raging (I'm raging)
I'm breaking through the pain

The monster's loose
And now you know the truth
Tell me, can you feel it
As you hit the wall?
The monster's loose
And now you have to choose
And prove that you can take it
To the top before you fall

I've walked a slippery road
With revenge in my soul through the wind and the cold
With no protection
Just one direction, destruction
I've paid for all my mistakes
Taken all I can take 'til I'm ready to break
Life can be vicious
It's so outrageous, it breaks us

I'm bleeding (I'm bleeding), still breathing (Still breathing)
I'm tearing through these chains

The monster's loose
And now you know the truth
Tell me, can you feel it
As you hit the wall?
The monster's loose
And now you have to choose
And prove that you can take it
To the top and never fall


I've lived a thousand years in darkness (Darkness)
Banished all alone
Inside my mind with just my madness (Madness)
Behind these walls of stone
I was waking up, stuck in a dream
Ran out of air, couldn't scream
Wasted away by my fears
Oh-oh-oh
The monster's loose
And now you know the truth
Tell me, can you feel it
As you hit the wall?
The monster's loose
This game is win or lose
The time has come to do it
And show the world you want it all

Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
