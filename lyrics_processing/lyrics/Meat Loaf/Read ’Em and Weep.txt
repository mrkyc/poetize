I thought I'd leave you with a letter of fiery speech
Like when an actor makes an exit at the end of a play
And I've been dying for hours trying to fill up all the holes with some sense
I'd like to know how you faded and you threw it away
I'd like to give you all the reasons and what everything meant
Well I could tell you "good-bye" or maybe "see you around"
With just a touch of a sarcastic "thanks"
We started out with a bang and at the top of the world
Now all the guns are exhausted and the bullets are blanks
And everything's blank
If I could only find the words then I would write it all down
If I could only find a voice I would speak
Oh, it's there in my eyes, oh can't you see me tonight
C'mon and look at me and read 'em and weep
If I could only find the words then I would write it all down
If I could only find a voice I would speak
Oh, it's there in my eyes, oh can't you see me tonight
C'mon and look at me and read 'em and weep
I've been whispering softly
Trying to build a cry up to a scream
We let the past slip away
And put the future on hold
Now the present is nothing but a hollowed out dream

With just a touch of a sarcastic thanks
But now the rooms are all empty, the candles are dark
The guns are exhausted and the bullets are blanks
And everything's blank
If I could find the words then I would write it all down
If I could only find a voice I would speak
Oh it's there in my eyes, can't you see me tonight
C'mon, will you look at me
And read 'em and weep
It's there in my eyes and coming straight from my heart
It's running silent and angry and deep
Oh it's there in my eyes and it's all I can say
C'mon, will you look at me
And read 'em and weep
(Read 'em and weep)
For all the hours we'll be spending alone
(Read 'em and weep)
For the dreams we'll ignore
(Running silent and deep)
And all those promises we promised to keep
They won't be kept anymore
(Read 'em and weep)
For the magic that our bodies had made
(Read 'em and weep)
For the blood that we've lost
(Running silent and deep)
And all those secrets that we somehow betrayed
For whatever the cost
(Read 'em and weep)
For the memories still alive in the bed
(Read 'em and weep)
For the lies we believed
(Running silent and deep)
And all the things that can never be said
Why don't you look at me and read 'em and weep
C'mon and look at me and read 'em and weep
(It's there in my eyes and coming straight from my heart
It's running silent and angry and deep)
It's there in my eyes, it's all I can say
