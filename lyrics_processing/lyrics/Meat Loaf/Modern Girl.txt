Had a little baby girl, born on a stormy night
But that was once upon a time, now it's a brand new world
Gimme the future, gimme the future
Gimme the future with a modern girl
Gimme the future, gimme the future
Gimme the future with a modern girl
Somewhere just between the past and somethin' dawnin' new
There's a break in the chain, a skip in the clock
Girl that's where I'm gonna find you
Between the boy I was before and what I'm gonna be
There's a clash on the border, a flame in the sky
Girl that's where you gonna find me
Can't ya hear the planet groanin' like a broken down machine
Rusted with the guilty tears of fallen kings and queens
But you and I stand innocent, baby it's a brand new world
Gimme the future, gimme the future
Gimme the future with a modern girl
Gimme the future, gimme the future
Gimme the future with a modern girl
(Gimme the future, gimme the future)
(Gimme the future with a modern girl)
