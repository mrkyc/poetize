After love's curtain comes down
Listen and you'll hear the sound
Hear the sound of a heart breaking
I can still see you standin' there
Midnight wind blowin' through your hair
Remember kisses sweet in the salty air
When love was forever
Turn the page and we fade to blue
The scene has changed now I'm without you
Well, you just walked away when the act was through
And the dream was over
It was almost like a movie
The way you said goodbye
You must have spent a lot of time
Rehearsing each and every line
Now there's not a dry eye in the house
After love's curtain comes down
Listen and you'll hear the sound
Hear the sound of a heart breaking, breaking
Not a smile left on my face
The ending's just too sad to take
And there's not a dry eye
Not a dry eye in the house

We had it all we had everything
But now the story's done, it's just history
The last act is over
Your every line had the sweetest sound
Your every touch turned my world around
But then the light came up and my world crashed down
End of show, it's over
It was almost like a movie
Those nights we touched the stars
Time stood still for you and I
Now it's sad enough to make you cry
And there's not a dry eye in the house
After love's curtain comes down
Listen and you'll hear the sound
Hear the sound of a heart breaking, breaking
Not a smile left on my face
The ending's just too sad to take
And there's not a dry eye
Not a dry eye in the house

Act Two: I fell in love with you

Act Four: You don't love me no more
Not a dry eye in the house
After love's curtain comes down
Listen and you'll hear the sound
Hear the sound of a heart breaking, breaking
Not a smile left on my face
The ending's just to sad to take
And there's not a dry eye, not a dry eye
Not a dry eye in the house
After love's curtain comes down
Listen and you'll hear the sound
Hear the sound of a heart breaking, breaking
Not a dry eye in the house
Not a dry eye in the house
