I remember every little thing. As if it happened only yesterday. Parking by the lake
And there was not another car in sight. And I never had a girl looking any better than you did. And all the kids at school. They were wishing they were me that night
And now our bodies are oh so close and tight. It never felt so good, it never felt so right. And we're glowing like the metal on the edge of a knife. And we're glowing like the metal on the edge of a knife. C'mon! Hold on tight! C'mon! Hold on tight!
Though it's cold and lonely in the deep dark night. I can see paradise by the dashboard light
Girl:
Ain't no doubt about it. We were doubly blessed. Cause we were barely seventeen. And we were barely dressed
Ain't no doubt about it. Baby got to go and shout it. Ain't no doubt about it
We were doubly blessed
Boy:
Cause we were barely seventeen And we were barely dressed Baby doncha hear my heart You got it drowning out the radio I've been waiting so long For you to come along and have some fun And I gotta let ya know No you're never gonna regret it
So open up your eyes I got a big surprise It'll feel all right Well I wanna make your motor run And now our bodies are oh so close and tight It never felt so good, it never felt so right And we're glowing like the metal on the edge of a knife
C'mon! Hold on tight! C'mon! Hold on tight!
Though it's cold and lonley in the deep dark night I can see paradise by the dashboard light Paradise by the dashboard light You got to do what you can
And let Mother Nature do the rest Ain't no doubt about it We were doubly blessed
Cause we were barely seventeen And we were barely-- We're gonna go all the way tonight We're gonna go allt he way An tonight's the night...
Radio Broadcast:
Ok, here we go, we got a real pressure cooker going here, two down, nobody on, no score, bottom of the ninth, there's the wind-up and there it is, a line shot up the middle, look at him go. This boy can really fly! He's rounding first and really turning it on now, he's not letting up at all, he's gonna try for second; the ball is bobbled out in center, and here comes the throw, and what a throw!
He's gonna slide in head first, here he comes, he's out! No, wait, safe--safe at second base, this kid really makes things happen out there
Batter steps up to the plate, here's the pitch-- he's going, and what a jump he's got, he's trying for third, here's the throw, it's in the dirt-- safe at third! Holy cow, stolen base! He's taking a pretty big lead out there, almost daring him to try and pick him off. The pitcher glance over, winds up, and it's bunted, bunted
Down the third base line, the suicide squeeze in on! Here he comes, squeeze play, it's gonna be close, here's the throw, there's the play at the plate, holy cow, I think he's gonna make it!

Praying for the End of Time
Boy:
I couldn't take it any longer Lord I was crazed And when the feeling came upon me Like a tidal wave I started swearing to my god and on my mother's grave
That I would love you to the end of time I swore that I would love you to the end of time!
So now I'm praying for the end of time To hurry up and arrive Cause if I gotta spend another minute with you I don't think that I can really survive
I'll never break my promise or forget my vow But God only knows what I can do right now I'm praying for the end of time It's all that I can do Praying for the end of time, so I can end my time with you!!!
Boy:
It was long ago and it was far away and it was so much better than it is today
Girl:
