Aah, if only
Aah, if only

If you listen to the night
You can hear the darkness call
I can barely stand to wait
I can barely stand at all
Come on closer to me now
Like we're sharing the same skin
We gotta get out of this jail
We gotta let the future in
So many things in your life
That you're bound to regret
"Why didn't I do that? Why didn't I do this?"
So many chances you've lost
That you'll never forget
"Why didn't I make it? Why didn't I take it right there?"

The loneliest words you'll ever know
"If only, if only it was so!"
The emptiest words that they'll ever be
"It could've been me! It could've been me!"

You'll have to pay for it later
If you don't get it when it's going for free
Believe me!
Believe me!
A kiss is a terrible thing to waste
A kiss is a terrible thing to waste
It's something that's always been so
A kiss is a terrible thing to waste
A kiss is a terrible thing to waste
And one of these nights
You're gonna show me that you already know
There's a feast waiting for you
And you've never even gotten a taste
It's later than you think
And a kiss is a terrible thing to waste

You shouldn't tremble when we touch
There's no reason for these fears
It's a promise that was made
We've been promised this for years
I wanna show you it all
What to do and where and how
'Cause we'll never be as young as we are right now
We'll never be as young as we are right now
So many cries in the night
That you try to ignore
"Why didn't I do this? Why didn't I do that?"
So many unanswered prayers
So many unopened doors
"Why didn't I take it? Why didn't I make it come true?"

The loneliest words you'll ever know
"If only, if only it was so!"
The emptiest words that they'll ever be
"It could've been me! It could've been me!"
The loneliest words you'll ever know
"If only, if only it was so!"

Believe me, believe me!
A kiss is a terrible thing to waste

And a kiss is a terrible thing to waste

Tire tracks and broken hearts
It's all we're leaving behind
It doesn't matter what we're losing
Only matters what we're going to find
Tire tracks and broken hearts
It's all we're leaving behind
It doesn't matter what we're losing
Only matters what we're going to find
Tire tracks and broken hearts
It's all we're leaving behind (Let's get away from the past)
It doesn't matter what we're losing
Only matters what we're going to find (So many ways to go fast)
Tire tracks and broken hearts
It's all we're leaving behind
It doesn't matter what we're losing
Only matters what we're going to find
Tire tracks and broken hearts
It's all we're leaving behind
It doesn't matter what we're losing
Only matters what we're going to find

There's a feast waiting for you
And you've never even gotten a taste
It's later than you think
And a kiss is a terrible thing to waste
