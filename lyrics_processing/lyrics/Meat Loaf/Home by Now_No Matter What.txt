The sun is red
It's gotten so late somehow
There's gonna be trouble
You know what they said
We should have been home by now
We should have been home by now
The thunder is rolling
The sky is black
It's gotten so dark somehow
There's gonna be danger
God, I wish we were back
We should have been home by now
We should have been home by now
No matter what they tell us
No matter what they do
No matter what they teach us
What we believe is true
No matter what they call us
However they attack
No matter where they take us
We'll find our own way back

I can't be what I'm not
I know I'll love forever
I know no matter what
If only tears were laughter
If only night was day
If only prayers were answered
Then we would hear God say
No matter what they tell you
No matter what they do
No matter what they teach you
What you believe is true
And I will keep you safe and strong
And sheltered from the storm
No matter where it's barren
A dream is being born
No matter who they follow
No matter where they lead
No matter how they judge us
I'll be everyone you need
No matter if the sun don't shine
Or if the skies are blue
No matter what the ending
My life began with you
I can't deny what I believe
I can't be what I'm not
I know this love's forever
I know no matter what
(I can't deny what I believe)
I can't be what I'm not
I know this love's forever
That's all that matters now no matter what
The thunder is rolling
The sky is black
It's gotten so dark somehow
There's gonna be danger
God, I wish we were back
We should have been home by now
