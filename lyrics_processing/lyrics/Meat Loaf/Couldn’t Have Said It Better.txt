And you said nothing at all
Well I couldn't have said it better myself
Tonight the conversation takes the fall
Just love me like you love nobody else

Little lady
I think there's something on your mind
I've known you long enough to know
The words are not that hard to find
And the harder you try
And the longer you go
Well there's nothing but love
In those eyes anymore
You know what to say
But you never know how
You can keep your mouth shut
Because it doesn't really
Matter right now
I will guide you all the way
Because I know exactly
What you're trying to say

To remain silent
I'll get the lights
You get that smile

And you say nothing at all
Well I couldn't have said it better myself
Tonight the conversation takes the fall
Just love me like you love nobody else

I see the angels
They're standing right outside your door
They're watching over me
They're watching over us all
You can send them home tonight
Because you won't need them anymore
In your arms
I think I've found
The safest place to fall
When I step in the door and I stare at your face
There are so many things that I wish I could say
Well i struggle with words but they put up a fight
You can keep your mouth shut
Because it doesn't really matter tonight
I will guide you
All the way (tonight)
Because I know exactly
What you're trying to say

You have the right
To remain silent
I'll get the lights
You get that smile

And you say nothing at all
Well I couldn't have said it better myself
Tonight the conversation takes the fall
Just love me like you love nobody else

And I know you feel the same
You've been searching for the words
Now you know what to say
Oh yeah
Just say nothing
Don't say a word
Silence is gold
Don't say a word
Shhh


This is the moment we've been waiting for (ohh yeah!)
If I exercise my right
I will take your body language
And hold it against you tonight

And I know you feel the same
I've wondered all my life
If this moment comes
Would I know what to say

Then you say nothing at all
(So many times I stumbled on the words that I wanted to say)
You said nothing at all
(So many thoughts that I should have just let my heart explain)
You said nothing at all
(So many ways we could turn the words around)
You said nothing at all
(So many nights our hearts came crashing to the ground)
You said nothing at all
(So many dreams that are finally coming true)
Well I could'nt have said it better myself
(Now you finish me off when
You finish my thoughts the way you do)

And you say nothing at all
Well I couldn't have said it better myself
Tonight the conversation takes the fall
Just love me like you love nobody else
You say nothing at all
Well I couldn't have said it better myself
Tonight the conversation takes the fall
Just love me like you love nobody else
You say nothing at all
Well I couldn't have said it better myself
Tonight the conversation takes the fall
Just love me like you love nobody else
You say nothing at all
