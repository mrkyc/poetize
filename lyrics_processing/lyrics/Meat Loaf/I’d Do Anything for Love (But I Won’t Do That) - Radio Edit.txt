I would do anything for love, I'll never lie to you and that's a fact
But I'll never forget the way you feel right now, oh no, no way
And I would do anything for love, but I won't do that, I won't do that
Anything for love, oh I would do anything for love
I would do anything for love, but I won't do that, oh I won't do that
Some days it don't come easy, and some days it don't come hard
Some days it don't come at all, and these are the days that never end
Some nights you're breathing fire, and some nights you're carved in ice
Some nights you're like nothing I've ever seen before or will again
Maybe I'm crazy, but it's crazy and it's true
I know you can save me, no one else can save me now but you
As long as the planets are turning, as long as the stars are burning
As long as your dreams are coming true, you better believe it
That I would do anything for love, and I'll be there 'til the final act
I would do anything for love, and I'll take a vow and seal a pact
But I'll never forgive myself if we don't go all the way tonight
And I would do anything for love, oh I would do anything for love
Oh I would do anything for love, but I won't do that, no I won't do that
I would do anything for love, anything you've been dreaming of
But I just won't do that
I would do anything for love, anything you've been dreaming of
But I just won't do that
I would do anything for love, anything you've been dreaming of
But I just won't do that
Some days I pray for silence, and some days I pray for soul
Some days I just pray to the God of sex and drums and rock 'n' roll
Some nights I lose the feeling, and some nights I lose control
Some nights I just lose it all when I watch you dance
And the thunder rolls
Maybe I'm lonely and that's all I'm qualified to be
There's just one and only, the one and only promise I can keep
As long as the wheels are turning, as long as the fires are burning
As long as your prayers are coming true, you better believe it
That I would do anything for love, and you know it's true and that's a fact
I would do anything for love, and there'll never be no turning back
But I'll never do it better than I do it with you, so long, so long
And I would do anything for love, oh I would do anything for love
I would do anything for love, but I won't do that, no no no I won't do that
I would do anything for love, anything you've been dreaming of
But I just won't do that
I would do anything for love, anything you've been dreaming of
But I just won't do that
I would do anything for love, anything you've been dreaming of
But I just won't do that
I would do anything for love, anything you've been dreaming of
But I just won't do that
I would do anything for love, anything you've been dreaming of
But I just won't do that
I would do anything for love, anything you've been dreaming of
But I just won't do that
I would do anything for love, anything you've been dreaming of
But I just won't do that
But I'll never stop dreaming of you every night of my life, no way
And I would do anything for love, oh I would do anything for love
I would do anything for love, but I won't do that, no I won't do that
Will you raise me up, will you help me down?
Will you get me right out of this Godforsaken town?
Will you make it all a little less cold?
I can do that, I can do that
Will you hold me sacred? Will you hold me tight?
Can you colorize my life, I'm so sick of black and white?
Can you make it all a little less old?
I can do that, oh oh, now I can do that
Will you make me some magic, with your own two hands?
Can you build an emerald city with these grains of sand?
Can you give me something I can take home?
I can do that, oh oh now, I can do that
Will you cater to every fantasy I got?
Will ya hose me down with holy water, if I get too hot?
Will you take me places I've never known?
I can do that, oh oh now, I can do that
After a while you'll forget everything
It was a brief interlude and a midsummer night's fling
And you'll see that it's time to move on
I won't do that, no I won't do that
I know the territory, I've been around
It'll all turn to dust and we'll all fall down
And sooner or later, you'll be screwing around
I won't do that, no I won't do that
Anything for love, oh I would do anything for love
