I knew our love would be so strong
And from the very first moment I kissed you
I knew our joy would last so long
And then I saw you making love to my best friend
I didn't know whatever to say
I saw you making love to my best friend
So I looked him right in his eyes and I said
Listen boy
Why don't you take some more, it's what you came for
And don't mind me I won't throw you no curve
Have yourself a ball with my good woman
Won't you take some more boy, it's more than you deserve
Won't you take some more boy, it's more than you deserve
When I saw you hanging round the truck stop
Shining like an angel in the night
And when I saw you crying like a baby
I knew you'd have to be my wife
And then I saw you making love to my best friend
I didn't know whatever to say
I saw you making love to my best friend
So I looked him right in his eyes and I said
Listen boy

And don't mind me I won't throw you no curve
Go on have yourself a ball with my good woman
Won't you take some more boy, it's more than you deserve
Won't you take some more boy, it's more than you deserve
Now I think I'm going to have to leave you
Because I'm feeling much too weak to share
And the pie, oh it's cut in too many pieces
The flavor that I crave is no longer there
And then I saw you making love to two of my best friends
I didn't know whatever to say
I saw you making love to a group of my best friends
So I looked them right in their eyes and I said
Listen here, group
Why don't you take some more, it's what you came for
And don't mind me I won't throw you no curve
Have yourself a ball with my good woman
Won't you take some more boys, it's more than you deserve
Won't you take some more boys, it's more than you deserve
