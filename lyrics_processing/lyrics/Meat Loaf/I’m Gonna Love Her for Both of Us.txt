Goddess
But you treat her like a slave and you can't hold her back anymore
She's like a dreamer in a dungeon or an Angel in a cave
And I'll be closer to you now than any other boy
And you know that what I'm saying is true
You're gonna break her up and tear her down and fade her away
And then there's no telling what I'm gonna do
I'll make you pay for everything that you do
I'll make you pay for everything that you do
But if you give me your girl and then you give me your trust
And if you give me till the end of the night-
I'm gonna love her for both of us
I'm gonna give her everything you always wanted to give
I'm gonna love her for both of us
I'm gonna take her every moment that she wanted to live
I'll let her shine like a jewel in the crown of the holy sun
You turned her into a ghost but she'll be burning when the night is
Done
I'll let her shine like a jewel in the crown of the holy sun
You turned her into a ghost but she'll be burning when the night is

When the screws are tightenin' and the tears are falling
I can hear her crying out to be saved
And like a bolt of lightning
I go answer the call but she's singing like a siren to me over the waves
I never wanted to take away your lover
Until I heard her cry out to be saved
I always thought of you as one of my brothers
But she's singing like a siren to me over the waves

There ain't no holding me down
