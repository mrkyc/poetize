I'm still alive
Must have been a miracle
It's been a hell of ride
Destination still unknown
It's a fact of life:
If you make one wrong move with the gun to your head
You better walk the line or you'll be left for dead

I'm a runaway train on a broken track
I'm a ticker on the bomb that you can't turn back this time
That's right
I got away with it all and I'm still alive
Let the end of the world come tumbling down
I'll be the last man standing on the ground
As long as hot blood runs trough my veins
I'm still alive

Lost in the night
Feeling so invisible
Oh, a dead man walking the wire
High above the devil's net
That's made of fire
And it's a long way down from the top of the world
You better look around or you gonna get burned

I'm a runaway train on a broken track
I'm a ticker on the bomb that you can't turn back this time
That's right
I got away with it all and I'm still alive
Let the end of the world come tumbling down
I'll be the last man standing on the ground
And as the dust clears, look in my eyes
I'm still alive
I'm still alive

The darkest night ain't black enough
To keep the morning light from shining
The highest wall ain't tall enough
To keep the smallest man from climbing
The more that you resist the tide
The more it pulls you in
The more you hang on for your life

(I'm a runaway train on a broken track)
(I'm a ticker on the bomb that you can't turn back this time)
(That's right)
That's right
I got away with it all and I'm still alive
I'm a runaway train on a broken track
I'm a ticker on the bomb that you can't turn back this time
That's right
I got away with it all and I'm still alive
Let the end of the world come tumbling down
I'll be the last man standing on the ground
And if my shadow's all that survives
I'm still alive
I'm still alive
I'm still alive
I'm still alive
(I'm a runaway train on a broken track
I'm a ticker on the bomb that you can't turn back this time
That's right
I got away with it all and I'm still alive
Let the end of the world come tumbling down
I'll be the last man standing)
