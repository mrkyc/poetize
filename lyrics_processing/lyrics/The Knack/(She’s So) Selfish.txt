She got a funny little face
But her body don't quit
An-an-and every time she come around
She give a wiggle and a wink
But she don't give a shit about
Anybody else but herself
No she doesn't care for nobody else
It's just me me me me
She's so selfish
Everybody plays her game
She got the style and the class
And she get what she wants
Yeah and everybody knows her name
She got the smile and the ass
And the power to flaunt
'cause she's really in it just for herself
No she doesn't care for nobody else
It's just me me me me
She's so selfish
And she say
Gimme gimme gimme gimme
