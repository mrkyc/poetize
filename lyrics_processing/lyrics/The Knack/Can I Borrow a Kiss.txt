In the summer i'll always remember
Said i was high-strung middle-class oversexed underemployed
By september i was a man
I followed the throng
Out to the coast and found
A girl who stepped out of a song
And my world filled with light and sound as she said to me
Can i borrow a kiss that's what i heard
Can i borrow a kiss no cost incurred
And i'll pay it back with interest
If you'll only say the word
Can i borrow a kiss like lovers do
Can i borrow a kiss make dreams come true
Let me know i exist can i borrow a kiss
And i'll give it right back to you
And i'll give it right back to you
She was a dark-haired satin-skinned velvet-eyed wisp of a girl
With a smile that could stop you from breathing
She had me coming on getting off tuning in and out of this world
And believing love was for real
Just like in a poem
She smiled that smile and then
I knew i would not be alone
And that soon all my cares would end when she said to me
You might also likeCan i borrow a kiss is what i heard
Can i borrow a kiss no cost incurred
And i'll pay it back with interest
If you'll only say the word
Can i borrow a kiss like lovers do
Can i borrow a kiss make dreams come true
Let me know i exist can i borrow a kiss
And i'll give it right back to you
And i'll give it right back to you
When i look back upon the time that's passed away
It always seems that all my dreams are yesterday
And i'll pay it back with interest
If you'll only say the word
Can i borrow a kiss like lovers do
Can i borrow a kiss make dreams come true
Let me know i exist can i borrow a kiss
And i'll give it right back to you
