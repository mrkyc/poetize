Don't waste time, boy
'Cause I'm up on your stuff
Can't you see that I am sorry
This was my first mistake
Ooh, I'm no fool, and that's for sure
So come on now and give me a break
You ought to quit with your jive
You ought to quit with your lies
You ought to quit with your jive
You ought to quit with your lies
Please understand me
I have to let you go
What's important now is
That we both know
Don't you know if we should part now
This would break my heart?
Oh, no, no, there's nothing else left between us
You have what you want, now we must part
You ought to quit with your jive
You ought to quit with your lies
You ought to quit with your jive
(Stop tellin' lies, babe)
You ought to quit with your lies
You might also likeI did my best to try and fight it
I know that I was wrong
You should have thought about it then
Now go away and leave me alone
You ought to quit with your jive
(Say what?)
You ought to quit with your lies
You ought to quit with your jive
(Stop tellin' lies, babe)
You ought to quit with your lies
You ought to quit with your jive
(I didn't mean to you wrong)
You ought to quit with your lies
(I'm so sorry)
You ought to quit with your jive
(Please)
You ought to quit with your lies
(Give me one more chance)
You ought to quit with your jive
(No more stories, no more lies)
You ought to quit with your lies
(Can't you see I'm tired of your jive)
You ought to quit with your jive
(Ooh, oh, oh)
You ought to quit with your lies
{Sorry, baby)
(It's too late)
