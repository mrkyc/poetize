Don't think about it
Hoo-hoo
Na-na-na na-na-na

It's been a long time coming
We knew it would come to this
Time for us to part, no one want to take the risk
We tried to stick together, pretend there was nothing wrong
Is it all over, girl?
I really have to know
Let's wait and see, give love a try
Let's leave the past behind

No, don't think about it (Don't think about it)
Don't think about it (Don't think about it)
No, don't think about it (Don't think about it)
Let's give love a try (Ooh, don't think about it)
Don't think about it (Don't think about it)
Girl, let's leave it behind (Don't think about it)
(Don't think about it)

If we ask each other now, "is it time for us to part?"
The answer would be "yes", not coming from the heart
We should wait a while, girl
Forget about our past
Don't think about it any further, let our future last
Let's wait a while, give love a chance
Leave the past behind

(Don't think about it, don't think about it)
No, don't think about it (Don't think about it, ooh)
Don't think about the past (Don't think about it, don't think about it)
Girl, just leave it behind (Don't think about it)
(Don't think about it)

Don't-don't-don't, don't-don't-don't-don't-don't (Think)
Don't-don't-don't, don't-don't-don't-don't-don't (Think-think)
Don't-don't-don't, don't-don't-don't-don't-don't (Think)
Don't-don't-don't, don't-don't-don't-don't-don't (Think-think)

Baby, hold on, put your suitcase down
Oh, don't give up so soon
True love is homeward bound, girl

No, don't think about it (Don't think about it)
Don't think about it (Don't think about it)
No, don't think about it (Don't think about it, ooh)
Don't think about the past (Don't think about it, don't think about it)
Girl, just leave it behind (Don't think about it)
Oh girl (Don't think about it)
No, don't think about it (Don't think about it)
Don't think about it (Don't think about it)
No, don't think about it (Don't think about it, ooh)
Let bygones by bygones (Don't think about it, don't think about it)
And leave it behind (Don't think about it)
Oh-ho (Don't think about it)
No, don't think about it (Don't think about it)
Don't think about it (Don't think about it)
No, don't think about it (Don't think about it, ooh)
I wouldn't lead you wrong, girl (Don't think about it, don't think about it)
I know the two of us can get it on (Don't think about it)
If we keep on (Don't think about it)
Girl, don't think about it (Don't think about it)
Don't think about it (Don't think about it)
No, don't think about it (Don't think about it)
Ho-hey! (Ooh)
Don't think about the past, girl (Don't think about it, don't think about it)
No, just leave it behind (Don't think about it)
No, no-no no-no-no-no (Don't think about it)
Don't think about it (Don't think about it)
Don't think about it (Don't think about it)
No, don't think about it (Don't think about it, ooh)
Let's try and work it out, girl (Don't think about it, don't think about it)
Leave the past behind (Don't think about it)
Girl (Don't think about it)
No, don't think about it (Don't think about it)
Don't think about it (Don't think about it)
No, don't think about it (Don't think about it, ooh)
(Don't think about it, don't think about it
Don't think about it, don't think about it
