Oh-ho, ah, ah, ah, oh-ho
Oh-ho, ah, ah, ah, oh-ho

I've been with you for a while now
And you're still so nice
Not like all the others I've been around
Who love to fuss and fight
You've changed in no way
You're always at your best
I love your style, your personality
You're better than the rest

You're so considerate when it comes to me
I'm so glad to have you (Oh, oh)
So splendid you are to me
I love your everything

'Cause you're a lady (Lady)
Lady, you are
You're a lady (Lady)
And I'm so proud of you
You might also like
You're so sweet and innocent
In all the things you do
Not to mention your lovely smile
So plentiful and true
You've changed in no way
You're always at your best
I guess that's why I really love you
You try so hard for me

Multitude, self-gratitude
You deserve in every way (Oh, oh)
Astonishing you are to me
I love your everything

'Cause you're a lady (Lady)
Lady, you are
You're a lady (Lady)
And I'm so proud of you

Lady, lady (Oh, oh, oh, oh)

You're a lady (Lady)
Lady, you are
You're my lady (Lady)
And I'm so proud of you
I wouldn't know what to do with myself
(Lady; lady, you are)
If I ever lost you, no no
I love the way you carry yourself
(Lady, I'm so proud of you, ooh, ooh, ooh)
'Cause you're a lady
I, I, I don't wanna lose you, no
(Lady; lady, you are)
'Cause you're a lady
Lady
(Lady, I'm so proud of you, ooh, ooh, ooh)
You're better than the rest
(Lady; lady, you are)
You're a lady
I love the way you carry yourself
(Lady, I'm so proud of you, ooh, ooh, ooh)
'Cause you're a lady
I, I, I, I don't wanna lose you, no
(Lady; lady, you are)
