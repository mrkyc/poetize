I just thought that you were friendly
But here we are passionately embraced
I suppose it's kind of funny
But it's also kind of scary
That your kiss brought back a feeling I'd erased
When you said that you were lonely
And I said I thought you would be
Then you took me to a darker holy place
Then I said I liked to kiss you
And you said you loved to kiss me
Then kissed the sweetest kiss I'll ever taste
'Cos I've known you for an hour
But you're growing like a flower In me
I've known you for a lifetime
Or we're soul mates from a past life
Daisy
It's all mixed with indecision
And a painful soulful spilling
Of everything I've ever felt or known
And you know that they're all looking
So you kiss me even harder
Then hold me and I just feel right at home
You might also likeYour touch is soft and tender
So I raise my flag surrender
Then say "I feel you staring at my soul"
And it makes them all feel awkward
But our time here's more important
So we sink into our closed eyed painful hole
I'm scared of what will happen
So I kiss you, say I'll call you
Then I tell you so much I don't understand
Then you kiss me with an answer
And my question seems invalid
And I go to bed with daisies in my hand
I call you there's no answer
But I know I have to see you
So I call and call and call and call again
But you never get my message
Or you choose not to return it
Because you shouldn't, needn't, wouldn't or just can't
I'm lonely and I love you
For the moment that is what's true In me
I've known you now forever
Joined at the soul together
Daisy
There'll be no way to avoid you
When I see you in the movies
And I realize right now you're not here with me
If I'll see you in my lifetime
If again I'll feel you kiss me
I suppose that I'll just have to wait and see
But for now I'll just be grateful
To be touched by such an angel
And put it down as life experience
That my muse is just a daisy
With the most beautiful nature
Will one day fall back in my flower bed
And I know you said you love me
And that's the only memory left For me
'Cos I need you more than ever
Joined at the soul together
