Folks, they try to tell me, don't let your ship capsize, don't let life pass you by
The world reality is the rat race where only the strong survive
It's a dog eat dog world
Wake up, world
Wake up, world
Wake up, world
Wake up, world
Wake up, world
Wake up, world
Give peace a chance
Are you afraid?
Time is running out
Give peace a chance
Are you afraid?
Time is running out
Sure it's strange
