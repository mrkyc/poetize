Do I have to keep on talking till I can't go on ?
While you see it your way
Run the risk of knowing that our love may soon be gone
We can work it out, we can work it out
Think of what you're saying
You can get it wrong and still you think that it's alright
Think of what I'm saying
We can work it out and get it straight or say goodnight
We can work it out, we can work it out
Life is very short and there's no time
For fussing and fighting my friend
I have always thought that it's a crime
So I will ask you once again
Try to see it my way
Only time will tell if I am right or I am wrong
While you see it your way
There's a chance that we may fall apart before too long
