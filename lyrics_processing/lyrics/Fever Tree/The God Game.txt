You who expect that we all genuflect
At the sound of your name
You're playing the god game
Say little man with the gun in your hand
You who expect all your guards to protect you
From fear and from blame
You're playing the god game
Say little man with the mace in your hand
You who reject all the laws that protect us
From crosses that flame
You're playing the god game
You say one man can't change things
So there is no use in trying
But a swarm of bees makes honey
In the carcass of the lion
You can't see that everywhere you look
Someone is dying
And you can't hear the silence
Where a baby once was crying
You sing a shattered atom song
Of dissonance and drumming
And you can't see the tidal wave
Of revolution coming
You might also likeYou drop a Sunday dollar
And then six days you coast
And become the father and the son
And the holy most
Say little man better hide if you can
You can't take what the brothers
Will make of the world plane
You're playing the god game
Say little man with the world in your hand
You who expect that we all genuflect
At the sound of your name
You're playing the god game
The empty premise of your life
Is like a sunless dawn
Your barren greed will take you where
No cardboard kings have gone
Inside your waspy little mind
You're frantic for escape
The blood just wants a place to stand
And you're afraid of rape
Say little man better hide if you can
You who can't take what the brothers
Will make of the world that you claim
You're playing the god game
Say little man with the gun in your hand
You who expect all your guards to protect you
From fear and from blame
