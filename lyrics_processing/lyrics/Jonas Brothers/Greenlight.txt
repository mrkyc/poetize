Oh girl, I'd never change a thing about you
I fell in love with the way that you move
Got me eyeing all the things that you do
Make me never wanna leave the bedroom

Ain't nobody in the world does it like you do
Got me begging you for more yeah it's nothing new
Before you came around yeah I was feeling blue
So tell me if you're down I'll fly you to the moon

Just say I got the greenlight (Light)
The things we do past midnight (Night)
Just me and you and it feels right (Feels right)
Just an empty room and a greenlight
A greenlight (greenlight)

Thinking back to the night we met
Like a song that you can't forget
In this light it's a perfect view
Make me never wanna leave the bedroom

Ain't nobody in the world does it like you do
Got me begging you for more yeah it's nothing new
Before you came around yeah I was feeling blue
So tell me if you're down I'll fly you to the moon
