I don't trust myself when I'm around you
I don't trust myself when I'm around you

Lately, I don't think I even know me
Every time you come around, I'm like the old me, old me
Take me back to when you were my only
Well, we were thicker than thieves, like a pod, two peas

And all at once
It's like I'm being someone else, yeah
You're all I want
But I know that you're bad for my health

I don't trust myself when I'm around you
I don't trust myself when I'm around you
Doing things I never do, acting like a damn fool
I don't trust myself when I'm around you

I know that I'm better off without you
But I know that I could never live without you, 'out you
Thinkin' 'bout my lips upon your mouth, yeah
Got me weak in the knees, my God, can't breathe

But I know that you're bad for my health (Oh, no, no)

I don't trust myself when I'm around you (Hey)
I don't trust myself when I'm around you (Without you, baby)
Doing things I never do (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
Acting like a damn fool
Yeah, I don't trust myself when I'm around you
(When I'm around you, baby)

I don't trust, I don't trust myself
I don't trust myself, yeah
I don't trust, I don't trust myself

I don't trust myself when I'm around you

I don't trust myself when I'm around you (Hey)
I don't trust myself when I'm around you (Around you, baby)
Doing things I never do (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
