Mr. Misdemeanor
Call me up and say you're needin' my love
Now you say you're leaving, oh yeah
Like you never even needed my love
Then I don't even see you (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Not even for a weekend or a month
So much you left between us (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
But you don't ever think about us (Ooh)

Why do, why do, why do, why do I want you
Even though you make it hard and I don't want to?
And now I'm out here catching feelings like I want you
But all you ever do is look a-, look away

Every single time, I keep on coming back to you
You're always on my mind, it doesn't matter what I do, I do
Every single time, I keep on coming back to you
But keep me on the line, if loving you's a crime
Then I won't keep my love locked down for you
Every single time

Yeah, I remember when we met
Like it was yesterday in Amsterdam (Smoke it up)
Making love through every season
Oh, every day, oh, every day
And I can't believe it now (I can't believe it)
You think, you think it's only physical (Oh, no, no)
No good at getting even
The way you play, the way you play

Why do, why do, why do, why do I want you
Even though you make it hard and I don't want to?
And now I'm out here catching feelings like I want you
But all you ever do is look away

Every single time, I keep on coming back to you
(I keep on coming)
You're always on my mind (Always on my mind)
It doesn't matter what I do, I do
Every single time, I keep on coming back to you
(I keep coming back to you)
But keep me on the line, if loving you's a crime
Then I won't keep my love locked down for you
Every single time

Every single, every single time
Every single, every single time
Every single, every single time
Love locked down for you

Because there's too much water
Under this bridge to go down like this
I never thought that we'd come this far
To **** it all up and e-end like this
Every single time, I keep on coming back to you
You're always on my mind, it doesn't matter what I do (I do)
Every single time, I keep on coming back to you
But keep me on the line, if loving you's a crime
Then I won't keep my love locked down for you
Every single time

Every single, every single time
Every single, every single time
Every single time
Every single, every single time
