One day we were at home rehearsing
When we heard a funny noise
Opened the backdoor to find out
It was a dude with a British voice
Stood there, said his name was James Corden
And we hadn't heard of him

He told me he built a time machine
Described all the things he'd seen, yeah
And he said:

"I've been to the year 2019
You won't believe who the new President is
It's the guy who hosts "The Apprentice"
And it's pretty weird, super weird"

He showed us the future through the portal
And we saw everything
Spider-Man, and another one, and another one
And another one
Found out there's a mascot called Gritty
He made us terrified
See Jonas Brothers LiveGet tickets as low as $18You might also like
We thought the future would be the best
So what's new with Kanye West? Yeah (Uhhh...)
He said:

"I've been to the year 2019
TV has changed, now it's all on your cell phone
You can filter any photo
Look! I'm a dog, a sexy dog"

I took a trip to 2019
Twitter sucks, Instagram is thriving
Everybody's wearing really tight jeans
You'll be married (That's surprising)
I took a trip to 2019
So many brand-new milks we're trying:
Cashew, almond, flax milk, oat milk
Rice milk, soy milk, hemp, and goat milk
I took a trip to 2019
Lonely Kevin's still the best meme
Everybody is obsessed with flossing

He said that Blockbuster is shut down
And Apple makes watches now, yeah
I've been to the year 2019
Fyre Fest was a total disaster
And The Rock is now a big actor
Box office champ, Dwayne Johnson (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
I said:
"I've been to the year 2019
There's dogs on planes, for emotional reasons
The Kardashians have had 15 seasons
They're everywhere, we're keeping up
I've been to the year 2019
Some things have changed, but it still can get better
