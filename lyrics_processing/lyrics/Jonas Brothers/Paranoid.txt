I make the most of all this stress
I try to live without regrets
But I'm about to break a sweat
I'm freaking out
It's like a poison in my brain
It's like a fog that blurs the sane
It's like a vine you can't untangle
I'm freaking out

Every time I turn around
Something don't feel right

Just might be paranoid
I'm avoiding the lines 'cause they just might split
Can someone stop the noise?
I don't know what it is, but I just don't fit
I'm paranoid
Yeah!

I take the necessary steps
To get some air into my chest
I'm taking all the doctor's meds
I'm still freaking out
That's why my ex is still my ex
I never trust a word she says
I'm running all the background checks
And she's freakin' out

Every time I turn around
Something's just not right

Just might be paranoid
I'm avoiding the lines 'cause they just might split
Can someone stop the noise?
I don't know what it is, but I just don't fit
Consider me destroyed (Consider me destroyed)
I don't know how to act 'cause I lost my head
I must be paranoid (I must be paranoid)
And I never thought it would come to this
I'm paranoid

Stuck in a room of staring faces (Yeah)
Caught in a nightmare, can't wake up
If you hear my cry
Running through the streets
I'm about to freak
Come and rescue me

Just might be paranoid (Might be paranoid)
I'm avoiding the lines 'cause they just might split
Can someone stop the noise? (Can someone stop the noise?)
I don't know what it is, but I just don't fit
Consider me destroyed (Consider me destroyed)
I don't know how to act 'cause I lost my head
Oh, I must be paranoid (Must be paranoid)
I never thought it would come to this
