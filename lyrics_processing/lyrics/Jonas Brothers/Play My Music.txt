Music

Turn on that radio as loud as it can go
Wanna dance until my feet can't feel the ground
(Feel the ground)
Say goodbye to all my fears
One good song, they disappear
And nothing in the world can bring me down
(Can bring me down)

Hand-clapping, hip-shaking, heart-breaking, there's no faking what you feel
What you feel when you're right at home, yeah (Yeah)

Music's in my soul
I can hear it every day and every night
It's the one thing on my mind
Music's got control and I'm never letting go, no, no
I just wanna play my music

Woo
Music
See Jonas Brothers LiveGet tickets as low as $18You might also like
Got my six string on my back
Don't need anything but that
Everything I want is here with me (Here with me)
So forget that fancy car
I don't need to go that far
What's driving me is following my dreams, yeah

Hand-clapping, earth-shaking, heart-breaking, there's no faking what you feel
What you feel when you're on a roll, yeah (Yeah)

Music's in my soul
I can hear it every day and every night
It's the one thing on my mind
Music's got control and I'm never letting go, no, no
I just wanna play my music
I just wanna play my music

I can't imagine what it'd be like (What it'd be like)
Without the sounds of all my heroes singin' all my favorite songs
So I can sing along

Music's in my soul
I can hear it every day and every night
It's the one thing on my mind
Music's in my soul
I can hear it every day and every night
It's the one thing on my mind
Music's got control and I'm never letting go, no, no
I just wanna play my music
Music's in my soul
I can hear it every day and every night
It's the one thing on my mind
Music's got control and I'm never letting go, no, no
I just wanna play my music all night long
