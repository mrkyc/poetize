Morgan moves back to the familiar charms of his fiery days when Morgan still felt something
No longer, Morgan's like a slave, three feet of paper and a family of four
Morgan wonders why his wife is so slow, blames his wife for his slow love
He shakes his head as he climbs into bed
Grits his teeth as he moves between the sheets
Morgan feels like sudden laughter when he sees
He doesn't sleep much on account of a terrible pain in his head
And sometimes Morgan sits up in the loft reading from a book of children's stories
Jaws no ordinary sucking harder, sagging eyelids and pocked cheeks
Intelligent the television buzzes and crackles and preaches
Morgan feels like his family have made a conscious effort to cause him misery
His taste buds have deserted, sneaking away from his wife's cooking
Morgan dreads the family meal, clenching one hand under the table
The bland wall hangings nod at the food in recognition
They are all too familiar with one another

Now, listen
Well I don't want to question your decision
In my opinion you've made an excellent choice
I don't want to put the doubt in your mind
In my head , well, you're just fine excellent choice
Excellent choice, excellent choice

Morgan's work for minimum wage is no comfort whatsoever
He thinks about the items that have sapped his money over the years
Shoe polish, oven cleaner, vacuum bags, sugar substitute
A pathetic collection of unwanted gifts and dream-sapping commerce
Any creative reserves once stored are long gone
Morgan seethes at the realization he has given his children too much of the little he has
Morgan wishes his family dead

Now, listen
Well I'm not trying to alter your opinion
I'm so happy that you've finally found your voice
I don't want to put the doubt in your mind
In my head, well, you're just fine excellent choice
Excellent choice, excellent choice (x2)

Lacking imagination, and full of despair, Morgan turns tail and leaves without a word
The door shuts compliantly as he moves outside
Morgan crunches down the path with regular, driven feet
Pushing through the grey clouds escaping his mouth
