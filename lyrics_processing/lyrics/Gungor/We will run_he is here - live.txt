He's right here
In this room; In your Heart
He is near
Nearer than you are to you, closer than second chance, or next opportunity
Closer than tonight, or yesterday
He is real
More real than touch; see, hear, smell, or taste
More real than reality; He is our reality!
More real than joy, pain, sorrow, or the love of being in love
He is present
Like space, wind, time, silence, night
He is waiting
Like; creation
Like words on the tip of tongue
Like; songs that have yet to be sung
He is beauty
And oranges, blues, every hue, every shade
Sunset and sunrise whisper his name
He is holy
Cannot be touched, explained, like; sweet seconds of prayer
Like; grandmother on knees
Wood floor, bare
He is old hymns
The extending of limbs, stretched across trees;
Stripes to heal disease
He is son
Distinctly three; distinctly one
The only one
The only wise
The only resurrector of lives
He is king
And no earthly throne can house him
No amount of elegant words can espouse him
He is moment, and voice
Power of choice
In word
And deed
In fruit
And seed
Nailed hands; nailed feet
Innocent wounds, that bleed
He is believe
He is all
He is call, and purpose
Everything we can sacrifice hes worth it, and more
Much more
Our good deeds are mere pennies; well never even to score
He is behold
And wow, he is who, what, when, why, how
He is the one who puts on the show
He is the one that we come to see
He is souls cry, and sinners plea
He is the epitome that no one can light a candle to or, come within a million-foot pole of
He is above
He is a fathers love
Maker of waves, of earth and wind
Ancient of days
Has no fear
Have no fear!
