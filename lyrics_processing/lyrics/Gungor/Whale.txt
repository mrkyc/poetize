How it all relates outside the mind
How the light defines the form
How the real is hiding so much more
So we break the world into
The left and right
The black and white
The me and you
Stuck within duality
Trying to find reality
But these lines are not so clean
The right and wrong
The you and me
You are beginning
You are beginning
You are beginning
You are beginning
I am the branches
I am the branches
I am the branches
I am the branches

You are the ocean
You are the ocean
You are the ocean
I am the whale
I am the whale
I am the whale
I am the whale
So the poets shape their lips
Fill their pens and fasten God to script
While the mystics lose their words
Writing music found in notes unheard
There's no need to tear the world
To left and right
The black and white
The me and you
Leave behind duality
To infinite reality
There is more than what we see
The endless world of you and me
You are beginning
You are beginning
You are beginning
You are beginning
I am the branches
I am the branches
I am the branches
I am the branches
You are the ocean
You are the ocean
You are the ocean
You are the ocean
I am the whale
I am the whale
I am the whale
I am the whale
You are the color
You are the color
You are the color
You are the color
I am the sky
I am the sky
I am the sky
I am the sky
You are the ocean
You are the ocean
You are the ocean
You are the ocean
I am the whale
I am the whale
I am the whale
