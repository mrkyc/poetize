Always looking, never see
It's always them, it's never me
Keeping me from home
Oh-oh-oh

Always waiting, never here
Happiness postponed for there
When I finally find a home
Oh-oh-oh

Someday (when I'm old enough)
Someday (when the time is right)
Someday (when I'm strong enough)
Someday (when I'm feeling right)
Someday (when the schedule clears)
Someday (when the worlds align)
Someday (when the money's there)
Someday (when I see a sign)
Someday (when I find my feet)
Someday (when I'm on my own)
Someday (when it's only me)
Someday (when I'm not alone)
Someday (when I find a girl)
Someday (when I get my stuff)
Someday (when I rule the world)
Someday (will it be enough)
You might also like
Always right in front of me
But I never quite arrive
Will I ever find a home?
Oh-oh-oh


What if now is the only time that we have somehow?
Tomorrow is a phantom row between real and the dream
What if now is the only peace that is ever found
Only love that can find a ground
Truest way to see

Someday, someday
Someday, someday
Someday (when I'm old enough)
Someday (when I'm strong enough)
Someday (when the schedule clears)
Someday (when the money's there)
Someday (when I'm old enough, when the time is right)
Someday (when I'm strong enough, when I feel alright)
Someday (when the schedule clears, when the worlds align)
Someday (when the money's there)
Someday (it's already here)
Someday (it's already here)
Someday (it's already here)
Someday (it's already here)
