She shoots that pretty smile your way and it feels like a bullet hole
And all the other girls around you disappear like gun smoke
The first time you meet her
Then you'll slip up, say mushy stuff about her 'round all your friends
Before you know what hits you those green eyes are reeling you in
Hook, line and sinker
Yeah, buddy, she's a keeper

When she gets a hold on you she just has a way
Of making a full grown man do things
He swore he never would
Man, that woman's good
You'll be picking wild flowers, dancing in the rain
You won't mind it, you'll even be smiling
All the while she's tearing your world apart
But when she gets a hold on you
Good luck holdin' on to your heart

You'll be buying scented candles trying to tidy up that man cave
She'll convince you that your favorite boots could use an upgrade
To some new ones
You'll find yourself in yoga class or sitting on a church pew
You'll take her home to mama
And your daddy says, "I hope you don't
Screw this one up, son"

Man, that woman's good

You won't mind it, you'll even be smiling
All the while she's tearing your world apart
But when she gets a hold on you
Good luck holdin' on to your heart

When she gets a hold on you with those soft gentle hands
You'll walk through hell to feel that close to heaven again
Swear you're losing your mind, curled up, sipping on wine
Down on one knee with a diamond in the pouring down rain
You won't mind it, you'll even be smiling
All the while she's tearing your world apart
When she gets a hold on you
Good luck holdin' on to your heart
When she gets a hold on you
