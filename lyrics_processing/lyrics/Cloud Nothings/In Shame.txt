Don't care about lying
If it's what I like and it feels right
Don't care about hurting
If it's what I like, and it turns to light
Just want to have power
And feel like I've done it right
Just wanna be stronger
Than anyone on any night

Oh the mind, the life, the mind, the life
It feels so good to me
The mind, the life, the mind, the life
It feels so good to me

They won't remember my name
I'll be alone in my shame
They won't remember my name
I'll be alone in my shame
They won't remember my name
I'll be alone in my shame
They won't remember my name
I'll be alone in my shame
No, nothing turns out right for this high life
