Whaaaaaaaaaaaat!!!

Now all my niggas say what, we dont give a fuck
Gotta let a bitch be a ho (hoooo)
Now all my niggas say what, we don't give a fuck
Gotta let a nigga stack dough (money, money)
Now all my niggas say what, we dont give a fuck
Gotta let a bitch be a ho (hoooo)
Now all my niggas say what, we don't give a fuck
Gotta let a nigga stack dough (money, money)

All the niggas fuckin in between, be the main man
Never get stuck on the scene without a game plan, understand
I went from pop lock into tops droppin
To one of the reasons why the day parties keep rockin
No stoppin niggas is like (wa-what?)
And shorty from the south keep fuckin it up
I'm the glitter and the gliss of this industry
Makin hits, is how ya'll remember me
Niggas dream to be like this one here
JD type cat dont dissapear
I'm the J to the E, R to the M
A-I-N-E, got so many
Bitches I should set up shop
Bettin against me? (Please!) My bank dont stop
I come through, bumpin Clue, with a 7-5-0
Screamin, I gots to have it, I love the dough

Nobody wanna fuck with the R.O.C
Young G from the streets and he's banned from TV
Nobody said life was easy, out on the block
I got shot, ain't nobody come and see me
Back on my feet, packed my heat, got back in the beef
Blazed it up, are ya muthafuckas lookin for me
Raised it up, now they see I'm makin rap songs
All I ask is my real dogs smash on...
I said yea and ya don't stop
Cuz its a 1-8-7 when ya fuck wit R.O.C
I said yea and ya don't quit
I'm comin live from the Bricks wit the gangsta shit
All my niggas on the corner at the end of the block
In front of the stores, shakin my dick at the lady cop
Shakin my clip, til the haters drop
And I'm in a drop-top, bumpin down ya block
And I'm dumpin
Now all my niggas say what, we dont give a fuck
Gotta let a bitch be a ho (hoooo)
Now all my niggas say what, we don't give a fuck
Gotta let a nigga stack dough (money, money)
Now all my niggas say what, we dont give a fuck
Gotta let a bitch be a ho (hoooo)

I seen a lot of niggas go down the wrong path
And I learned from they mistakes, how to keep cash
In this world of snakes, I don't bend, I don't break
Push a Benz, cuz a nigga know how to create
On and on like the beat go
Any nigga standin in my way of my papers, automatically finito
Suckin on the end of Rosco Pico's
Trained to name, deleted from the muthafuckin game
Ain't no mo' shoppin throught the glass
Beggin for ass, if it ain't 1st class, I let it pass
Ya'll that dont got it talkin all that trash
Tryin to play tough ya'll when ya really bitch-ass
I'm the cream of the crop, the dream of the top
I'm the one they come and see when they don't want it to stop
I'm the bass, the snare, the one that don't care
Rip shit the fuck up then I'm outta here
Now all my niggas say what, we dont give a fuck
Gotta let a bitch be a ho (hoooo)
Now all my niggas say what, we don't give a fuck
Gotta let a nigga stack dough (money, money)
Now all my niggas say what, we dont give a fuck
Gotta let a bitch be a ho (hoooo)
Now all my niggas say what, we don't give a fuck
Gotta let a nigga stack dough (money, money)
