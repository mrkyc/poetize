The stories in the public press, the deal with life at this address do not reflect our point of view, in fact they're awful far from true. The public image we have built, we play in public to the hilt. But here I let my muscles rust, and I can cover up my bust.

We're cultural, not sexual, intrigued with the intellectual! Here we sit engrossed in , ignoring the allure of anything less pure. In our bedroom classic art is all, Shakespeare wall to wall! We're cultural, not physical, so keen to learn, so quizzical! I would rather go to bed with .

You must have deduced she can't be seduced.

No, we think love should be a proper noun.

Sex steers the body down.

What disgrace, all this talk of passion plus...

Peyton Place is quite enough of sex for us.

Oh, you're telling me Mickey, too much!
We're cultural, not sexual, sex makes one an affectual. With each affair, they say a brain cell dies, and so libido-wise, we economize! And all through life, we'll sit and read in bed, then leave our brains to Harvard men. We have read Greek mythology, Oedipus Rex, the Kinsey report in the history of sex, and a gay Russian novel, what wit and what charm, it's called "Lolita Of Sunnybrook Farm".

Tell me darling, how do you feel about Ibsen?
Oh, I adore Ibsen. While tippling in Ibsen...
Ha ha! Speaking of tippling, how about Kipling?
Oh, well I- I don't really know, I've never kippled.
We're studious, not passionate, and as for sex, we ration it! Love's a bore, and strictly entre nous. We sometime score it's true, but only our IQ. My IQ is easy to recall, it's just the size of my bust!

Think of that!

We're cultural, we read a lot, and as for love, don't need a lot. Sigmund Freud said love is an abuse, and it's only use is to reproduce. So we're happy, life is never hard sharing a library card! He's my guy, intellectually inclined.

I'd never try putting  over mine.
