I was told that the lesson is to learn until it hurts
And I know to forgive or I will surely end up burnt
I'm sure there's a reason that you do the things you do
And I am sure there's a reason you'll be acting like a fool
I was told I was different by the early age of six
That the world couldn't handle me whenever I did
Like I wanted to
I I I did like I wanted to

You can't mess with an original, that ones me
Extraordinary, Visionary, yep that's me
You can't mess with an original, that ones me

I've been waiting for all my life
Now I'm ready, ready machete, watch me fly
Time has never been on my side
Now I'm ready, ready machete, watch me fly
(Ah, Ah Ah, Ah, Ah)

Now everybody got a story that hasn't been told
And the secrets that we keep no they will never be old
We tell them to the children that are playing in the yard
That life is what you make it, it don't have to be hard
You might also likeI would say that I am different and I got the upper hand
And the world is my playing making castles in the sand
Like I wanted to
I I I did what I wanted to

I've been waiting for all my life
Now I'm ready, ready machete, watch me fly
Time has never been on my side
Now I'm ready, ready machete, watch me fly

You can't mess with an original, that ones me
Extraordinary, Visionary, yep that's me (x4)

I feel No Shame, No Shame at all
I feel No Shame, No Shame at all

I can't feel this, I can't feel this

I've been waiting for all my life
Now I'm ready, ready machete, watch me fly
Time has never been on my side
Now I'm ready, ready machete, watch me fly
I've been waiting for all my life
Now I'm ready, ready machete, watch me fly
Time has never been on my side
