Shout out to Justin Bieber
Chris Brown, what up?

Bass loud, hands up, I don't really give a fuck
They say I ain't old enough, but I be young and actin' up (Roth)
Actin', a-actin' up, actin', a-actin' up
They say I ain't old enough, but I be young and actin' up
Go, go
Go, go
Go, go

Here I go (Oh)
Yeah, yo, what's the scenario? (Oh)
Can't understand, what you starin' for?
Like you've never seen a white boy dance before
But (But), d-d-damn she fine (Fine)
That's one chick I can stand behind ('Hind)
Play in my field like a dandelion
Then put-put-put it on-on 'til you can't decide
Oh, what's it gon' be? (Be)
You, me, her, her, her, you, me (Me)
Girl, go berserk, gotta beat 'em with a tree
Go ahead, fall back, need a boy gon' breathe

So I walked in the club with a dope hairdo
Checkin' my fresh, everythin' brand new
Sexy old dude, heard him sayin' "Who's you?"
You do me and I'ma do you
Wh-What, what you talkin' 'bout, Willis?
Man, fall back, I'm just chillin'
Hate when they check for a bad-bad bitch
Gotta have respect for my bad habits
Pa-Pa, now pass me the drink
I'ma get wild, I'ma nail you to me
Pull out the camera, then shoot me a links
'Cause I'ma act up, sweetie pie, what you think?
Go insane in the membrane, brain do my thing-thing
Yeah, talk my slang, come and hang with a real thing
Words of the same, same shit and same lovers
Badder than a mother, MJ level
Face down, ass up
Skinnies on, dirty Chucks
Showin' off, I'ma swag it up
Good girl gone bad, boy, grab my Bud'

Bass loud, hands up, I don't really give a fuck

Nineteen years old and I gotta act up 'cause I'm so, so fly, yeah I'm so fly
A-A-And I don't know why, really know I, go so wow 'til the bass goes, "Oh my"
Oh, I, I gotta slow it down
Yeah, I'm on the loose, and I won't stop now
'Cause I go so loud, and I go so wow
So you better watch out 'cause I'm oh so ah
I'm on some risky business, I like women and French kisses
Mama told do the dishes, but I'm out here catchin' fishes
'Cause I'm still young and actin' up
Girls on my mind, so I still mack up
Yeah, you see the money, see the money, rack up
'Til the walls dark green 'cause I'm stackin' up (Cha-ching)
Bass loud, hands up, I don't really give a fuck
They say I ain't old enough, but I be young and actin' up
Actin', a-actin' up, actin', a-actin' up
They say I ain't old enough, but I be young and actin' up

Yikes, I guess I'm actin' up
I'm about to go in, let me wrap it up
Y'all old school like Galaga
But I'ma call these shots, caliber (Bloaw!)
What it is, JB?
My Ray-Bans in my jacket might give you rabies
And if my chain heavy, give it to the ladies
DJ hold up, hold up, watch 'em go crazy (What?)
Chillin' with Asher Roth
Girls let me touch 'cause they ass is soft
Yes, I'ma score with them basketballs
She gon' give it up, but I don't pass at all
My crew neck match my two-step
I just had group sex on my new jet
So many pretty girl, I'm like, "Who's next?"
So drunk, all my white friends like, "Do it"

Ease off, back up (Haha), I'm about to act up (Haha)
