Boom bap, original rap
Boom bap, boom bap
Boom bap, original rap
Refreshin' when you hear it
Hard rap is all that, so...

What's happened to rap? Dag nabbit, it's half assin'
It's bad habbit it bad babblin and gag gaggin' em
Back packin' it
Rap battlin' bags packed and sent back to the back alley and dragged out
But don't back down or back out, we back now
Manny Pacqiao knock the pretty swag out
It's the last bout, don't ask how without doubt
The crowd shout "Wow" would make KRS proud
The loud sound downtown eastbound and down it  down around now, where art thou?
New York, New York, new work, let's do work
Who hurt went berzerk and be heard what you were
Doin' in the studio, ruinin' with your booty flow
You should go jump in the pool, shoes made of aluminum
Thrownin' up on the radio, all ya hear 'em playin'
Is the same damn thing over and over again, gimme

It's all polluted; screw it, you fuckin' ruined it, goonie
I should be suin' it
Tooted it and fuckin' booted it
Really? We need some nudity?
Batteries not included, B
Coochie coo and some boobies are prudent as all the food we eat
But it be cool to see some kids get on that Kool Moe Dee
The Cool J or some Wu would get it jumpin' like it's jubilee
It's a zoo like Zoobilee
True indeed we are human, so we are doomed to the umph degree
This used to be so fun for me but now I'm strugglin'
I'm tryin to get a number one, dyin' to get another run
Lyin' to get a cut on the waves, man I'm tryin to get paid
Hey cut me a break, I start playin' at raves
Naw homie I'mma never flip the script to fit in with the bu-ll-shit they spinnin'
I be chillin' with some women, sippin' on some juice and gin and
Thinkin' it may take a minute, bring origin rap again
