Hey what's up?
Leave your name and your number
And I'll call you back
God bless
(Changing Faces)
It's been so long
Since I've held you
Yet thoughts of you come to me
And your face appears while lying here
It's like never being here without you
And even when you're far away
I appreciate you every day
I may be in Japan
London or France
No matter where I am
You're still my man
Winter, spring, summer, fall
Whenever you should call
No matter where I am
You're still my man
(Leave a message)
(Malik)
Even I write undertone love songs
The verses are addressed to you
My lady, my baby
It's like always writing songs in love with you
These insides of mine don't lie
You're always on my mind
You might also likeI can be on city streets
Or down south in the country
Any where in the world
You're still my girl
Eight days in a week
Whenever you need me
Any where in the world
You're still my girl
(Changing Faces)
Sometimes I find it hard to bear
The pressures of this world
Until I speak, or think, or dream of you
(Malik)
Sometimes it's strange to find
All that matter is you at times
It feels so good to know
That you're all mine, you're mine
(Changing Faces)
Ooh I may be in Japan
London or France
No matter where I am
You're still my man
(Malik)
I can be on city streets
Or down south in the country
Any where in the world
You're still my girl
(Changing Faces)
Winter, spring, summer, fall
Whenever you should call
Anywhere in the world baby
I'm still your girl
(Malik)
Eight days in a week
Whenever you need me
No matter where I am
I'm you're man
(Malik & Changing Faces)
