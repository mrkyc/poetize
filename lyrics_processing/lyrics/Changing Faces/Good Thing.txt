Shoulda thought about love
You need my love

You don't know a good thing 'til you lose it
And you won't realize 'til it's gone
You don't know a good thing 'til you lose it
And you won't realize 'til it's gone wrong

A good thing
Is the touch of a breeze blowing cool air on your burning face
Yeah, that's a good thing
Oh a good thing
Is to know someone's there when your heart's craving for a warm embrace
Yeah, that's a good thing
A good thing, a good thing
Is something I thought we had and prayed it would never end, ooh no, no
But now that you did what you did
I don't think that my heart will understand
Your loving in my life will never mend
Oh no, no, no, but you never

You don't know a good thing 'til you lose it
And you won't realize 'til it's gone
You don't know a good thing 'til you lose it
And you won't realize 'til it's gone wrong
You might also like
A good thing
Is to help someone out when they're down and in need of a friend, oh
A good thing (Good thing)
Is to come home and be with the one you love again and again, oh, oh
A good thing, oh
Is something I thought we had and prayed it would never end, oh no, no, no, no, no
But now that you did what you did
I don't think that my heart will understand
Your loving in my life will never mend
Oh no, oh, oh, oh

You don't know a good thing 'til you lose it
And you won't realize 'til it's gone
You don't know a good thing 'til you lose it
And you won't realize 'til it's gone wrong

Ooooh, shoulda thought about love
Ooooh, shoulda thought about love
Shoulda thought about love (You don't know a good thing)
You need my love

You don't know a good thing
You don't know a good thing
You don't know a good thing
You don't know a good thing 'til it's gone wrong
You don't know 'til you lose it
You don't know 'til it's gone far away
You don't know 'til you lose it
