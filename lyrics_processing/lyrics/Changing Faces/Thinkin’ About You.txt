I'm your girl, you're my man
And we stand hand and hand
When we're together
You know it
But when we are apart
It just breaks my poor heart
I need you forever
By my side

Baby I want you
And you want me
Can't stand the fact
That we can't be
Together constantly
I wanna be in your arms
Makin' love allnight long
Ooh baby, ooh yeah
You got me thinkin' of you

Thinkin' about you on those lonely nights
The sun doesn't shine on those sunny days
Without you right here, baby by my side
The stars don't twinkle and shine bright at night
You might also like
There's no doubt, in my mind
If we both had the time
We'd spend it together
You know it
You and me, me and you
You know just what we'd do
Allnight
Over and over again

Baby I want you
And you want me
Can't stand the fact
That we can't be
Together constantly
I wanna be in your arms
Makin' love allnight long
Ooh baby, ooh yeah
You got me thinkin' of you

Thinkin' about you on those lonely nights
The sun doesn't shine on those sunny days
Without you right here, baby by my side
The stars don't twinkle and shine bright at night
You got me thinkin' about you
Mmmmm
Ah yeah
Ery second
Oh
Uh
Uh huh
You got me thinkin' about you

Thinkin' about you on those lonely nights
The sun doesn't shine on those sunny days
Without you right here, baby by my side
The stars don't twinkle and shine bright at night
Thinkin' about you on those lonely nights
The sun doesn't shine on those sunny days
Without you right here, baby by my side
The stars don't twinkle and shine bright at night
