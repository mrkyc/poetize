Yo, I'ma tell you 'bout them four letter words
Your momma used to tell you about, uh-huh
I'm not talkin' 'bout cusswords
I'm talkin' 'bout this word, often said
But do we mean it?
Heh, I'ma tell you 'bout L-O-V-E, know what I'm sayin'
You get around your crew, I'm just "aiight"
Heh, but you ain't say that last night
For real, you know, it's all gravy baby
Uh, yeah, it's all gravy baby
But uh, I'ma break it down to you like this
Uh, uh, hit me
Tryin' to get nobody comin' at me
Cuz you with your good buddy
It seems to me it's all of a sudden
Cuz the night before
You treated me so different, see
Tryna say it wasn't too funny
Sayin' that you playin' like you really love me
Sweet nothings, so you can
Cut somethin', touch somethin'
Last night you really thought you
Were tryna do something
You might also like
Don't you want me?
Don't you need me?
To give you kisses
And to hold you tight
Don't you love me?
Don't you trust me?
Cuz I remember
That's what you said last night
So what you wanna do baby?
Are you still showin' out? Are you actin' shady?
You can keep that boy, it's gravy baby
But I refuse to let you come around my way
And continue to play me baby
Cuz I believed when you said to me
I was all you need
Or was you fakin' me?

Don't you want me?
Don't you need me?
To give you kisses
And to hold you tight
Don't you love me?
Don't you trust me?
Cuz I remember
That's what you said last night
I really wanna be your lover
I want you to love me like no other
If you feel you in a tired situation
Won't be the one that you're playin'
I know you feel the same way too
But you front in front of your crew
It's aiight, I can play that too
As long as you remember
What you say you'll do
Don't you want me?
Don't you want me?
Don't you need me?
To give you kisses
And to hold you tight
Don't you love me?
Don't you trust me?
Cuz I remember
That's what you said last night
Don't you want me?
Don't you need me?
To give you kisses
And to hold you tight
Don't you love me?
Don't you trust me?
Cuz I remember
