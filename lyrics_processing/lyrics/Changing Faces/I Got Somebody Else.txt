I got somebody
I got some
I got somebody
I got some
I got somebody

I got somebody, I

I was a fool to let you in
After all the things you did to me
I wasn't happy, oh-oh
You held me open like you did
Didn't see the things I should've seen
Now you remind me

I used to cry every night
You weren't here, you should've been by my side
And now it's time I'm saying that I
Am making it clear
You should be saying bye-bye
'Cause I

I got somebody else (Somebody)
The one I've waited for (For)
He gives me love and all that I wish for
I got somebody else (Somebody)
Someone who's really sure
I'm so in love, he's all that I wish for
You might also like
Used to hang out with your friends
Fool around and then pretend to be
Thinking about me, oh-oh
But now I got somebody new
Who doesn't treat me like you used to do
And now he's my baby boo

I used to cry every night (Cry every night)
You weren't here, you should've been by my side
And now it's time I'm saying that I
Am making it clear
You should be saying bye-bye
'Cause I

I got somebody else (Somebody)
The one I've waited for (For)
He gives me love and all that I wish for
I got somebody else (Somebody)
Someone who's really sure (Really sure)
I'm so in love, he's all that I wish for

You did me wrong (Did me wrong)
When I moved on
I was free to find someone who loved me
I made up my mind to leave you behind
Now I got somebody else
I got somebody else (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
The one I've waited for
He gives me love and all that I wish for (All that I wish for)
I got somebody else (I got somebody else)
Someone who's really sure (He's really sure)
I'm so in love, he's all that I wish for

I've got somebody else
I've got somebody else
I've got somebody else
I've got somebody else

I, the one I've waited for
Someone I've waited for
Got somebody, I
I, the one I've waited for
Someone I've waited for
Got somebody, I
I, the one I've waited for
Someone I've waited for
