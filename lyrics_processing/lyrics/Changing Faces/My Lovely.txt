Oooohh, mmmm
Hey
Mmmmmm-mmmmm
Hey-ay-ay
Mmmmmm-mmmmm

It's been awhile since I've heard from you
For so many nights I've contemplated
On what you're going through baby
It seems like everything is changing now
Cause we don't show love to each other
The way we used to

Please believe that I want
To truly understand you
And if you open up, babe
I promise to try
Try to give what you need
To show you that I'm willing
To listen with my heart
And let go of my pride
Cause you're my
You might also like
You're my lovely (My lovely)
You're my lovely (You're my lovely, lovely)
You're my baby (My baby)
You're my lovely (Yeah)

Maybe I've been too possessive baby
I know that I've tried to control you
And rule your everything (Your everything)
But if you
But if you give me something (You give me)
That I can focus on (That I can focus on)
Want you to know that I've decided
For you
For you I will change

Please believe that I want
To truly understand you
I know there's something wrong
I can feel inside
So I want to hear what you need
Show you that I'm willing
To listen with my heart
And prove to you your my
You're my lovely (You're my lovely, lovely)
You're my lovely (My baby)
You're my baby (You're my baby, baby)
You're my lovely

I took it for granted
That you would always be by my side
Ooh yes
And now there's a chance
Oh, that I might be losing my
Lovely
Oooh, yeah

You are my lovely (You're my you're my)
You are my baby (My my my my my lovely)
You are my lovely (You're my you're my)
You're my lovely
