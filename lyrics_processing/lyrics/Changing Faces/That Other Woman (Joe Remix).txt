(No, no, no, no, no, no)
I can't be that other woman
(No, no, no, no, no, no)
You only see me every Friday night at nine
Can't imagine what you told her this time
You never take me to a public place
(Worried that somebody might notice your face)
Rush to the liquor store and then a motel
Call up your friends to just cover your trail
Not a word until the week goes by
You call me when you want some pie
Bridge
Why am I crying every night over you?
You're never gonna leave her
Finally I woke up and smelled the coffee
I understand
Why two women can't share one man
Chorus
I can't be that other woman
I can't love you down
Can't keep creeping around
Can't be that other woman
Yes I want you bad
But she needs you much more
You might also likeChorus
You never see me on the holidays
You disappear and won't return my page
You take my body in the middle of night
(I ain't gon' lie cause boy you do it so right)
And then you melt me with them same three words
Sweetest seduction that I've ever heard
And in the morning with the sun rise
You run to her, I realize
Bridge & Chorus x2
Can I get a witness?
(Yes you can)
Oh can I get a witness?
(Oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah, yeah)
Can I get a witness?
(You know you can)
Have you ever been in love with another girl's man?
Can I get a witness?
(Yes you can)
Can I get a witness?
(Oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah, yeah)
You said you're leaving a thousand times
But I won't believe till the papers are signed
I can't be that other woman
(I won't believe it, no)
(Gotta be the only one)
I can't be that other woman
(She needs you much more)
I can't be that other woman
(Can't, no)
(No more late night booty calls)
I can't be that other woman
(She needs you much more)
Chorus
In the morning, with the sun rise
