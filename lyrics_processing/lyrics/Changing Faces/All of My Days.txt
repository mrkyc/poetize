Changing Faces

How we do
Yo, all of my rhymes for all of my days I trade
All of my dimes and all of my bad ways I fade
Kill the late nights cruisin'
All you see is the brake lights, and hair blowin'
You know where we goin'
Or at the club in the rear frontin', poppin', droppin'
The amount some cats will wear, ain't trying to hear nothin'
Probably was wilder than Bobby, are you the Whitney
To get me hold me down and make me slow down the V-twizzy?
Keep the ice out the club lights, change faces
Get I love wifey on the license plate
Wait, make me think about you even when you're not around
Use the bathroom, put the toilet seat back down
Cop you some sprinkles, the hound with the wrinkles
If preferred his and her furs to the ankles
Keep your friends buggin', lovin' all my ways
Jigga keep you jiggy all of my days, uh huh

In the middle of the night
You got me thinkin' 'bout you babe
Got me dreamin' 'bout you baby

All that I have
All that I have
Baby it's yours
Baby it's yours forever and ever baby
All I want is to be with you all of my days
All I want, all I need
All I want is to be with you all of my days
All I want, yeah, yeah

Anything that turn you on
I'll be givin' it to you babe
You don't have to worry baby

All that I have
All that I have
Baby it's yours
Baby it's yours forever and ever
All I want is to be with you all of my days
All I want, all I need
All I want is to be with you all of my days
All I want, yeah, yeah

Yeah ha ha, check it
All I want, all I need
Is you in my life, loving me
All I want, all I need
Is you in my life (Uh huh)
Loving me
Now we going house shoppin'
Everybody wanna know the price your spouse droppin'
Keep that on the low R. Kelly style, it's quite shockin'
A year ago, all I did was spend nights hoppin'
In the club in search of pretty faces and nice stockings
Who would have thought I'd walk down the aisle, rice droppin'
Got you a nice rock and...
Now it's on and poppin', droppin' hotter than platinum bracelets
Jigga, R. Kelly, Changing Faces, uhh

All I want is to be with you all of my days
All I want, all I need
All I want is to be with you all of my days
All I want baby
All I want is to be with you all of my days
All I want, all I need
All I want is to be with you all of my days
