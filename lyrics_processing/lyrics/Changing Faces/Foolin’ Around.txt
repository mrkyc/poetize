We used to be so close
But now things have changed
It's not the same (No, no.)
Since I heard you calling her name
So quick to tell me that she was just a friend.  (Oh yeah.)
I don't wanna hear that same old line again, again
I got a hunch, something ain't right.  (No, no.)
This is no illusion
I've come to this conclusion that
You're foolin' around
Foolin', foolin' around
You're foolin' around
Foolin', foolin' around
You're foolin' around
Foolin', foolin' around
You're foolin' around
Foolin', foolin' around
You might also likeI can't believe that I was foolin' myself
When all along (Oh yes.) you were with someone else
No more games
I'm letting you go your way
'Cause three is a crowd
So I'm giving you your space
I got a hunch, something ain't right.  (Oh, no, no.)
This is no illusion
I've come to this conclusion that
You're foolin' around

I gave you the chance to give me romance
I was there for you, boy, and you know it's true
See, you're weak, not strong
You should've held on
'Cause toys are for boys
Ohhhh, oh, oh, oh
You're foolin' around
Foolin', foolin' around.  (Yeah, yeah.)
Oh.  (Yeah, yeah.)
