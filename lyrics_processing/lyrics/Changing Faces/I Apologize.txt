As I look back in time
Baby I apologize
Must have been blind
Now I need you by my side
As I look back in time
Baby I apologize
Must have been blind
Now I need you by my side

As I look back in time
Baby I apologize
Must have been blind
Now I need you by my side
As I look back in time
Baby I apologize
Must have been blind
Now I need you by my side

Remember the sin
When I was young and so much fun
Playin' the games that we would play
I hurt you in a bad way
Never did I imagine that
I would yearn for your lovin' back
Back in my heart again
Back in my heart again
When I look back now
You might also like
As I look back in time
Baby I apologize
Must have been blind
Now I need you by my side
As I look back in time
Baby I apologize
Must have been blind
Now I need you by my side

In the begining
I was just so in love with you
Momma said wait you're way too young
You got your whole life ahead of you
Never did I imagine that
I would yearn for your lovin' back
Back in my heart again
Back in my heart again
When I look back now

As I look back in time
Baby I apologize
Must have been blind
Now I need you by my side
As I look back in time
Baby I apologize
Must have been blind
Now I need you by my side
I'm lookin' for someone I can love
Lookin' for some I can trust
And I know that you're the one
I am not to afraid to let you know I'm wrong
You're the one my heart beats for
No need to look no more

Want you to know that
I want you, need you, oh
Let me know
Let me know boy
Tell me if you're out there
Cause I need you right here
Let me know
Let me know boy
Tell me if you're out there
Cause I need you right here
Let me know
Let me know boy
Tell me if you're out there
Cause I need you right here
Let me know
Let me know boy
Tell me if you're out there
