I can't be that other woman
I can't be that other woman

You only see me every Friday night at nine
Can't imagine what you told her this time
You never take me to a public place
Worried that somebody might notice your face
Rush to the liquor store and then a motel (Motel)
Call up your friends just to cover your trail
Not a word until the week goes by
You call me when you want some pie

Why am I crying every night over you
You're never gonna leave her
Finally I woke up and smelled the coffee
I understand
Why two women can't share one man

I can't be that other woman (Woman)
I can't love you down (No, no)
Can't keep creepin' around
Can't be that other woman
Yes, I want you bad (Bad)
But she needs you much more
I can't be that other woman
I can't love you down (No, no-no, no)
Can't keep creepin' around
I can't be that other woman (Can't be, no)
Yes, I want you bad
But she needs you much more
You might also like
Mm, you never see me on the holidays
You disappear and won't return my page
You take my body in the middle of night, uh-huh
I ain't gon lie 'cause boy you do it so right
And when you melt me with them same three words
Sweetest seduction that I've ever heard
And in the morning with the sun rise
You run to her I realize

Why am I crying every night over you
You're never gonna leave her
Finally I woke up and smelled the coffee
I understand
Why two women can't share one man

I can't be that other woman (No, no, no, no, no, no, no)
I can't love you down
Can't keep creepin' around
Can't be that other woman
Yes, I want you bad
But she needs you much more
I can't be that other woman (See)
I can't love you down (What goes around comes around)
Can't keep creepin' around
Can't be that other woman
Yes, I want you bad (I want you, oh, so bad)
But she needs you much more (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Can I get a witness?
Yes you can
Oh, can I get a witness?
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Can I get a witness?
You know you can
Have you ever been in love with another girl's man?
Can I get a witness?
Yes you can
Can I get a witness?
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You said you're leaving a thousand times
But I won't believe 'til the papers are signed

Can't be that other woman
I won't believe it no
I gotta be the only one (Can't be no)
Yes, I want you bad
But she needs you much more

I can't be that other woman
I can't love you down (I can't, no)
Can't keep creepin' around (No more late night booty calls)
Can't be that other woman
Yes, I want you bad (Woman, no)
But she needs you much more
In the morning with sunrise
You will run to her
No, you're never gonna leave her
So I'm saying goodbye
In the morning with sunrise
You will run to her
No, you're never gonna leave her
So I'm saying goodbye

I can't be that other woman (Can't be that other woman)
I can't love you down
Can't keep creepin' around (Can't be that other wo-ooh-ooh-oman)
Can't be that other woman (Can't be that other woman)
Yes, I want you bad
But she needs you much more (She needs)
I can't be that other woman
I can't love you down
Can't keep creepin' around
