Anytime I need you, baby
You give good love
And every time I turn around
You're all that I am thinking of
Lately, you've been kinda rushin'
Goin' too fast, yeah
Can we try it tonight, now, baby
Can we make it last? Ooh, yeah

Keep it right there, keep it right there
If you wanna please me (Yeah, mmm)
Keep it right there, keep it right there
And I'll make it easy (Make it easy for you)
Keep it right there, keep it right there
If you wanna please me (If you wanna please me)
Keep it right there, keep it right there
And I'll make it easy (Ooh, ooh, ooh)

Whenever you wanna do it
Wherever you wanna go
I know that I can get right with that
If you just take it slow, yeah (So baby, let's go, let's go)
'Cause you know that everything you do
Is so damn fine
And I would like your lovin'
If you could take your time, so you gotta
You might also like
Keep it right there, keep it right there
If you wanna please me (Ooh, please me)
Keep it right there, keep it right there
And I'll make it easy (I'll make it easy)
Keep it right there, keep it right there
If you wanna please me (Keep it right there, keep it right there)
Keep it right there, keep it right there
And I'll make it easy (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

Do you know that
I like what you do so
Slow down (So slow down)
And catch this groove
Woah, woah, woah
DeVante, won't you help us sing it
Won't you help me say oh-whoa

Oh-oh-oh, keep it slow
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, and make it easy
Oh-oh-oh, keep it slow
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, and try to please me
Oh-oh-oh, keep it slow
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, and make it easy
Oh-oh-oh, keep it slow
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, and try to please me
Keep it right there, keep it right there (Oh, oh, oh)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, and make it easy (Make it easy)

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, and try to please me (Try to please me)
