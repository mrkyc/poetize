Hey, hey, yo, is this thing on?
Oh, for a second there I thought that I was the only one
Whose man put his car before his girl
Put his friends before the relationship
But I guess these are the things
We just gotta deal with, huh?

Stood me up for the thousandth time (Thousandth time)
Said he was running 'round
He was crazy busy at the studio
I wanted to key his car, cut his clothes
I wanted him to die
But then he slipped in for a second
And he hit it and he made it alright
Oh, yeah, yeah

He's a ladies man, a playboy
Smooth talkin', dough trickin', ho pimpin'
Gotta go, gotta roll tight
Was the same excuse
Used every trick in the book
Game no good, shoo
But I love this man

But never fall in love
