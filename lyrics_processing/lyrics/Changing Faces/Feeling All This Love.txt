Every night I sit home waiting
To feel your tender touch
Can't face it, but I know
That you won't be back again
Can't help feeling...

Feeling all this love for you
And I just can't stop
(Can't help feeling this love for you)
Feeling all this love for you
And I just can't stop
(I won't stop, no)

Holding on to hope 'cause
I want us to have a second chance
Don't know where we went wrong
It happened oh so fast

Each day goes by
I think of you and I, oh my
What fun we had
Now I'm oh so sad
And as sure as there's a God above
I know I'll get
Get your love again, again
I'm feeling...

Feeling all this love for you
And I just can't stop
(Ooh baby, got me feeling this love, I can't stop)
Feeling all this love for you
And I just can't stop
(For you and I just can't stop)
Stop, stop, stop
(I'm feeling, I'm feeling, I'm feeling, I'm feeling)
Stop, stop, stop
(I'm feeling, I'm feeling, I'm feeling, I'm feeling)

Feeling all this love for you
And I just can't stop
(This love for you, I can't help feeling)
Feeling all this love for you
And I just can't stop
(This love for you)
Feeling all this love for you

Feeling all this love for you

Feeling all this love for you
And I just can't stop
(This love for you, baby)

Feeling all this love for you
