Yeah, so what you wanna see me for, baby?
- I wanna show you something
Oh yeah, and what's that?
- Turn the lights down halfway
Huh, ayo, that's cool with me

Do you mind if I stroke you up? (I don't mind)
Do you mind if I stroke you down? (I don't mind)
All through the night (I don't mind)
Holding your body tight (I don't mind)
Do you mind if I stroke you up? (I don't mind)
Do you mind if I stroke you down? (I don't mind)
All through the night (I don't mind)
Making you feel so right (I don't mind)

Come on in and close the door
I've got what you're looking
Dim the lights, unplug the phone
And turn the radio on
I've got what you need
Just put your trust in me
And I won't let you down
So give me your love right now
You might also like
Give it up (That's what I wanna do)
Keep it comin' (Don't stop)
I've got a question for you

Do you mind if I stroke you up? (I don't mind)

Do you mind if I stroke you down? (I don't mind)
All through the night (I don't mind)
Making you feel so right (I don't mind)

I know the things to do
To make you feel alright
Giving you all of me
And keeping you satisfied
Boy, there's no mystery
You know how I feel right now
I want to lift you up
And make your love come down

Give it up (That's what I wanna do)
Keep it comin' (Don't stop)
