Introducing Brett
You you want me to tell you
I mean do you really want me to tell you

What is it about you
Just tell me how you do what you do to me
Whatever you want to
No questions asked you know it's okay with me
You can't do nothing wrong
You know just where to go how to play with me
We can play all night long
Cuz with you all night long is where I wanna be

You got me doin things I never did before
And when you touch me you open every door
I'm not afraid to see how much you mean to me
No I just can't explain what you're doin to me

What are you doin to me tell me
What you're doin to me baby tell me what you're doin to me
What are you doin to me tell me
What you're doin to me baby tell me what you're doin to me
What are you doin to me tell me
What you're doin to me baby tell me what you're doin to me
What are you doin to me tell me
What you're doin to me baby tell me what you're doin to me
What are you

Where did you go to school what you're doin to me
How did you learn to do what you do to me
The way you use your tools what you're doin to me
See every touch you took had to get at me
Sometimes I scream your name
And I don't feel no way I don't feel no shame
See all I feel is you
So keep on makin me feel the way I do

You know what it means you're my fantasy
You put it on me never hold back gave it to me
I'm not afraid to see where you're takin me
No I can't get enough of what you're doin
You're doin to me

What are you doin to me tell me
What you're doin to me baby tell me what you're doin to me

But I rather show than tell, please hold on askin the questions
But you want me to talk dirty thug you out type aggressin
Or show affection, pipe you down, sweetly caressin
Or when my tongue headin from your forehead and

To that soft spot between your legs and
Oh the school? Changing Faces

Aight I'll make this confession
