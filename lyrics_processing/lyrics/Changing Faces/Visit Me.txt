Sittin' here lonely
Wonderin' if you're home
Thinkin' about callin' you
Cuz I don't wanna be alone
The fireplace is burnin'
But baby yet I'm still cold (Mm-hmm)
Without your body next to me
Somehow I just don't feel whole, no
I'll leave the door unlocked for you
Just come right on in
And make yourself comfortable
I'll treat you like a friend

We can talk about some things
And baby we can do some things
The perfect night for company
I need you to visit me
Let's disappoint some friends
And let 'em know we're stayin' in
Makin' love until no end
I need you to visit me

Now you don't have to phone me first
Cuz baby I'll be right here (right here babe)
I've got the whole night planned for us
Now all I need is your body near
Boy you know what bell to ring
Don't you make me wait too long
Now you should get over baby
Make yourself right at home

We can talk about some things (We can talk about some things)
And baby we can do some things (Oh-oh)
The perfect night for company (Perfect night for company)
I need you to visit me (Come on over baby)
Let's disappoint some friends (Oh)
And let 'em know we're stayin' in
Makin' love until no end
I need you to visit me (Now once you get over)

Once you get over here my darling
You will never wanna leave, no
You won't ever want to leave my darling
See forever is a plan that I have for you
Are you ready? (Are you ready?)
To come over (Come over)
Cuz I'm waiting for your loving
We can talk about kissing and huggin'
And touchin', feelin'
Are you willing? Ohh...

Come on over to my place
And let me love your body down (love you down)
Said we both could use some good lovin' tonight, yeah
So much to talk about
Here I am, a lonely woman
And there you are, a lonely man (mmm)
See we got so much in common
That baby you should be my man (mm-hmm)
See my body is calling you
And your body is calling me
So come on over baby
And let's talk about something
We can talk about some things
And baby we can do some things
The perfect night for company
I need you to visit me
Let's disappoint some friends
And let 'em know we're stayin' in
Makin' love until no end
