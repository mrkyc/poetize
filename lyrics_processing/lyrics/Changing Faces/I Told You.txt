You told me, I heard it all before
You lied to me, can't take no more
(Dave)
Have I told you lately, mmm
How much you mean to me, heh
You are my lady, heh
And it's no mystery, mm-mm
What you do to me
See I know I done you wrong, oh yeah babe
But baby I just wanna move on
See I wish I could do it all over again, heh
'cause I would never ever hurt my best friend
Baby I know I told you once before
Chorus
(Dave) (Changing Faces)
Girl, I told you (you told me)
That I loved you (I heard it all before)
I told you that I cared (can't take no more)
I told you (it's too much)
I'd be there for you (you lied to me)
Forever (you told me I was the only one)
You don't believe me (boy I don't)
Don't mistreat me (it's too much)
Girl I'm sorry (it's not good enough)
I'm on my knees (boy just get up)
See I told you (you told me)
That I loved you (I heard it all before)
Forever (you told me we'd be together for life)
You might also like(Changing Faces)
It's so hard to forget
All the pain you put me through
How could you throw it all away
And expect me to stay
(You went away)
There's nothing more in this world
I'd rather have
Than to come back
If you'd only think with your head above
Then maybe we'll still be in love, yeah
Boy, you told me...
Chorus
(Changing Faces)
It's funny how, how things have changed
Since I've fallen out of love with you
I'm not in love, not like before
Don't need you in my life no more
(Dave) (CF) {Dave}
Please babe, I'm begging, please stay
I wanna be with you {I wanna see you babe)
Please won't you stay with me {stay girl} (no, no, no, no)
Girl without you, I will die (no, no, no, no)
Baby please, can we try? {please try} (no, no, no, no)
I'll do what I gotta do, to be with you
For life
Chorus x2
(Dave) (CF)
Hey yeah (yeah)
Girl I love you
Baby I'm sorry (ooh)
Forgive me please
Take me back (no babe)
