Words are not enough for you now
It's hard on your pride
I can't find you though I know you
You are just a step out of line
Come closer to me
When the lines are drawn
And no one comes to break us down
And the walls that stood between us
Tumble to the ground
It's time to find someone to run to
I've got a place in mind
It's known as conscience point
It's where the clouds roll by
They say that nothin' really matters
I'm goin' out to find
Why people come this way
And put the past behind
You know there really is a reason
Changing faces trading places
Nothing lasts anymore it's hard when you try
Star-crossed lovers run for cover
I don't know if it's right but I know how I feel
You might also likeWhen you're tired of all those things
You never said before
And although you've tried you never opened that door
It's time to find someone to run to
We'll run the roads tonite
We'll meet at conscience point
I look into your eyes
You say that nothin' really matters
If I could change your mind
If you would look my way
And leave it all behind
You'd know you really mean so much to me
When you've tired of all those things
You've never done before
And you never took the time
To fall in love before
You've got to find someone to yea
We'll run the roads tonite
We'll meet at conscience point
I'll look into your eyes
And know that somethin' really matters
'Cause we can change our minds
And we can find our way
And leave it all behind
'Cause you really mean that much to me
Conscience point take a walk with me
And put it all behind
