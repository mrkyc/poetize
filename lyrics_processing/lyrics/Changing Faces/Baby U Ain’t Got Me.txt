Boy, I think that you should know
You could have all the dough
But you can't buy me, money can't buy me (Oww)

You can have all the whips (Changing Faces)
You can have all the cribs (Queen Pen)
You can have all the chips (Bounce uh)
You can have all the hits (How you feel about this?)
You can have any girl you need
You can be living like a king
That don't mean anything you see
Cuz baby u ain't got me

Baby, I know you're not tryin' to tempt me
Gas me up on empty
When you know I peep game right from the door
You're mistaking
To think that I'll go crazy
You may think that I'm hating
But I'm not the least bit infatuated

I'm not impressed (No, no)
With all these things you own (No)
Could care less, save that (Yeah, yeah)
For some chick, who don't know
I want a man who's got
It goin' on up top (And down low)
And I know dough is cool
But it don't buy my love, oh no

Cuz baby u ain't got me

Now you're skatin'
On Cloud Nine cuz they been
Playing your song on the station
And all them fakers are your new-found friends
Livin' lavish, way above your average
You're too much with karats
Check out, you got a Benz
I was diggin' you more when you had nothing

I'm not impressed (Oooh no, no)
With all these things you own (Ohhh)
Could care less, save that (Yeah, yeah)
For some chick, who don't know

And I know dough is cool
But it don't buy my love, oh no

I see this industry done fucked your head up
You done made a little doughs and stepped your game up
But you can't handle it like a real nigga could
I'd rather you stay broke and never left out the hood
You don't impress me yo, cuz I knew you from before
When you was doin' spot dates before doin' major tours
Before you hit it big, when you didn't have no whip
You was a nice guy, way back then
And I, can't deny, now you ain't worth shit
Tell me how you gon' live off of one good hit?
Go on, run your game on some new jack chicks
Cuz me and Changing Faces, we own our own chips nigga

No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no

You can have all the chips (Yes you can)
You can have all the hits (Oh-oh)
You can have any girl you need (Any girl)
You can be anything a king (Anything)
That don't mean anything you see (That don't mean a thing)
Cuz baby u ain't got me (Baby)
You can have all the whips (You can have all the whips)
You can have all the cribs (You can have all the cribs)
