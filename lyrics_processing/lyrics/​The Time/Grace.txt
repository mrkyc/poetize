Hi. I'm Bridgette Harrington and I'm here to interview Morris Day, lead singer of The Time:  Mr. Day, How are you?

Need you ask?

I'll take it that you're fine

Yes, I've been told that

Oh, OK. Tell me. Are you really so cool?

Is money green?

When did you first notice your coolness?

I didn't. The doctor did
You see, most people were born in birthday suits. I was born in a zoot suit

You got to be joking

Baby, I ain't got time to joke. What time is it anyway?

It's time for us to continue this interview

Oh...

How does The Time go about generating such a funky sound?

Pardon me. I know you didn't say "funk"

Well?

Let me just say one thing. Funk is dead
Funk is something you can learn in school and ain't nothing funky about being cool, ... Grace

OK, but my name is Bridgette

Oh I'm sorry, ... Grace
It seems your image has a lot to do with your approch to music
Your clothes for example

My clothes, fuck. Hold it
Let me, let let me just say something to all the fellas out there
Take off them blue jeans and them "New Wave" clothes and go get you some "Baggies."
It's about the freedom, right?
In other words, stay at the hotel with the biggest ballroom
Don't get me wrong. Some of my best friends wear blue jeans
I'm just not ever seen them in it
What time is it?

Why are you so concerned with the time?

'Cause I got somewhere to go

Where's that?

To the park, Joanie
I told you my name is Bridgette

Sorry, Love

I don't think I like you at all
Is there anything else you would like to say before we close this interview?

Yes!!!!
What's your phone number?

Uuh! - 7..., 7..., 7..., 9..., 3..., 1..., 1
