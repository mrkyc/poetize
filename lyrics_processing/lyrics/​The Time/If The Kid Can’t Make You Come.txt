You like my crib, baby?
Well, come a little closer, don't be shy

Darling, I want you so bad
I can almost taste the smell of your skin
And honey, I'd be so sad if you didn't break down and let me in
You better let me in, baby
Don't you know

If the Kid can't make you come
(Nobody) Nobody can
If the Kid can't make you come
No (Nobody) Nobody can
If the Kid can't make you come
No (Nobody) Nobody can
If the Kid can't make you come
No (Nobody) No, nobody can

Am I gettin' through, baby?
Ooh ooh ooh, yeah
Sweetheart, I can be gentle as a lamb
If that's what gets you off
I wanna get you off, baby
And lover, straddle my brass
And we'll dance in the land of the hard and soft
I don't care, baby
Whatever gets you off?

To the flag...of the United States...of America...
And to the republic for which it stands...
Oh Lord
