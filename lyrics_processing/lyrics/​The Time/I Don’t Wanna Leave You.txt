People say you run around, I don't even care
I could never hold you down, I don't even dare
I just wanna play your game, no matter what the rules
I've met an awful lot of dames, but none quite as bad as you

Let me try to love you, I know I could
One night to hold you, just ain't no good

I don't wanna leave you, I don't wanna go
Can't you see I need you? Girl, I need you so

I will be your doctor, baby, I'll make you feel alright, alright
I've got something to keep you warm, on a cold and lonely night
Now turn out the light
I will never tie you down, 'cause I know you wanna be free, so free
Say you'll let me come around, say you wanna be with me
Oh, baby, please

Let me try to love you, I know I could
One night to hold you just ain't no good

All I wanna do, is make sweet love to you
Now you wanna leave me. What am I supposed to do?
Can't you see I need you? Girl, I need you so
Can't you hang past to? That was twelve o'clock at night
Why you wanna leave so soon? Girl, you know it ain't right, ah, hey
I don't wanna leave you, I don't wanna go
(I don't wanna leave you, I don't wanna go)
Can't you see I need you? Girl, I need you so
Why you wanna leave me, leave me tonight?
Think about it, baby, you know it just ain't right
