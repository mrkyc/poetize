Fellas? Yeah! Hit Me!
Are we ready? I do believe we are ready!
What time is it? (Yount!)
It's killing time, Morris!
I know that's right, because I am the latest fashion
(Go, Morris, go, Morris, go, Morris, go, Morris, go, Morris, go, Morris, go, Morris
Young, go, Morris, go, Morris, go, Morris, go, Morris, go, Morris, go, Morris
Go, Morris, go, Morris)

I know I said I loved you
I know I said I needed you
I know I said that I'd be here always
But what I didn't tell you is that

This year, the latest fashion is to lie in the heat of passion

Fellas? (Yeah) hit me, but don't you lag
Tell me what dance to do...it starts with an M ... (Murph Drag)
I am not through yet...band!
Whaa...hallelujah...whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa

Everybody want to tell me how to play the game
When I run it better than a madame runs dames
Trying to beat me like playing pool with a rope
My funk will leave you dead 'cause it's good and plenty dope
All in all I'm still the king and all y'all the court
If you're pregnant by a fool, then you better get abortions, yes!
It's jacked 'cause I'm back, and I'm harder than a heart attack
And I'm the cure for any disease 'cause ain't nobody funky like me!
(Go, Morris, go, Morris, go, Morris)
Don't be a fool
(Go Morris, go, Morris, go, Morris)

This year, the latest fashion is to lie in the heat of passion
The latest fashion
