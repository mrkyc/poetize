Every time we're out on a date

Eighteen jumbo shrimp, damn

(Chocolate) What you waitin' for?
(Chocolate) Oh Lord, give me some of that
(Chocolate) Just can't wait no more

Every time I bring you home
You say you got a headache, you wanna be alone
I ain't tryin' to brag babe, but if I ever get you in the bed
I'll work that body so hard
You'll wish all you had was an achin' head
