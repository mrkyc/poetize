It's been real
Thanks for hookin' me up
I thank you for the thrills
Tell me
How do you feel
From that look on your face
I know you like my skilz
CHORUS:
But playtime is over
And this evening we shoring
Must come to on end
Playtime is over
And I just hope you understand
You gotsta go home to yo man
Wasn't I clear
'Cause it's time for you to go
And you're still laying here
You better woke up
Now, you ain't sleeping here
The next time I catch you
I'm surely gone let you
Hook me up again
But you gotta go, baby
You might also likeCHORUS
I ain't trying to be rude, baby
But it's late in the afternoon
Girl, you gotta go home
Alarm ringing half past three
Sho don't want yo man coming after me
Girl, you understand
You gotta go home to yo man
(Meet me tomorrow at noon)
Damn, can you believe this?

We got a thing goin' on
Hit me on the pager tomorrow, baby
And I just hope you understand
Right now it's lime to go
You gotta go home
Don't let the sun catch you creeping
When you should be sleeping with your man
You gotta go home
Girl, I'd like to keep you comin'
But I know you should be goin'
Go on, girl
CHORUS
We gonna have to cool this thing for a minute
Seem like every spare minute I get
It's tapping at my door
Showing up with a fur coat with nothing but draws on up under it
What am I supposed to do, say no?
And here you come with this stuff again
Because all I can think about is
I been makin' love to somebody's ol' lady
And it's got to stop
Damn, baby, not the red shit
You know likes the red
All right, baby, one last time, and this is it, you understand me?
You gotsta ... you gotsta go home ... all right?
