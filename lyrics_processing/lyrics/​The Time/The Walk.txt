Attention, everybody
I'm gonna show you a brand new dance
It's called "The walk, the walk"
Just let your body talk 'til you're deep in a trance
You don't need no partner, you can walk all alone
Whenever you feel the groove
Just let your body move, walkin' to a beat of your own

Everybody walk your body
Everybody walk, yoo-hoo-hoo
Everybody walk your body
Everybody walk

Attention everybody
I said it ain't hard to do
Just walk, walk, let your body talk, walkin' so cool
(Walkin' so cool)
Attention everybody
I said I just shined my shoes, yes I did
So you can let your body talk, just watch where you walk
Or your life you're gonna lose
In other words, I'll walk you 'til you're dead
You might also like
Everybody walk your body
Hey, everybody walk, yoo-hoo-hoo
Everybody walk your body
Oh, everybody walk

The days of dancing in one place are gone
And honey, you know you can't dance with them tight jeans on
If you try to cop a dip, you'd trip, slip, and fall
Walking's for the cool, baby, put on a camisole, hey

Everybody walk your body (Everybody walk your body)
Everybody walk, yoo-hoo-hoo
Everybody walk your body (Everybody walk your body)
Everybody walk, oh

Who? Me? I wear baggies, zip, snap, and drop
Easy access, baby
Yes, before you get a chance to holler "Stop!"
Besides, Rollo likes his freedom
Ain't nothin' like a fresh pair of baggies
Now I know that's right
Everybody walk your body (Everybody walk your body)
Everybody walk, yoo-hoo-hoo
Everybody walk your body
Everybody walk, oh

I'm going home. I can't dance like that
Well baby, that's because you got those jeans on too tight
Now let's just take 'em off
What do you mean "Let's just take 'em off?"
Come on, take 'em off. I got something for you to wear. Here, put this on
Huh, you always keep lingerie in your glove department?
None of my women wear gloves. Now put this on
But...
But my ass - hey, a play on words
But all the girls will stare at me
All the girls in this neighborhood already wear camisoles
I know, but...
But, but... that's because it's cool. Now let's get them jeans off
Okay, but I'm warning you
Warning me about what?
Mmm, this zipper's tight. Here, why don't you lay down?

Stop tryin' to tell me things and pull
But...
Come on, pull
I'm warning you

Damn baby, how'd you get all that in them jeans?
