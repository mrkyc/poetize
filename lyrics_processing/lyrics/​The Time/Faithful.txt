But just the some we're more than friends
So girl, don't get all caught up
In your feelings 'cause I can't pretend
All I want is just one night
But I don't want no strings attached
Too many girls, too little time
'Cause faithful ain't the some for me
Ain't tryin' to make a fool of you, that's not polite
Just want your love experience far just one night
So when you see me with somebody else don't get uptight
'Cause faithful ain't the some for me
All the pretty girls sayin'
(Woo hoo ooh ooh woo hoo)
All the sexy girls sayin'
(Woo hoo ooh ooh woo hoo)
That's what I like
Y'all listen to me
I wrestle with temptation 'most every night
Mysterious and beautiful, yeah, that's my type
So irresistible I can't control my appetite
'Cause faithful ain't the some for me
You might also likeCHORUS
It's like I turn 'em on
And I can't turn them off
It's like the way they jockin' me should be against the low
I got a little breezy
Girl makin' me freaky
Come on
Hop on in, away we go
We gone be faithful
Aw, girl
You so damn fine
You got me turnin' in my player's cord for just one night
Y'all be call in' me a dog
Please believe it ain't my fault
Pardon me when I get caught
I wanna be faithful
Lawd knows I try
And I go through it each and every night
But what in the world is a man supposed to do
When all the finest women come up to you, jocking you
All in your ear, sayin'
(Woo hoo ooh ooh woo hoo)
That's what I like
(Woo hoo ooh ooh)
All the sexy girls saying
(Woo hoo ooh ooh woo hoo)
They lovin' me tonight
(Woo hoo ooh ooh)
Yo, y'all listen to me
I wrestle with temptation 'most every night
Mysterious and beautiful, yeah, that's my type
So irresistible I can't control my appetite
'Cause faithful ain't the some for me
CHORUS
But it's all right
'Cause up in here tonight
We got some of the finest women you ever wanna see
All up in your ear, saying
(Woo hoo ooh ooh woo hoo)
That's right, you know what I like
(Woo hoo ooh ooh)
All the sexy girls saying
(Woo hoo ooh ooh woo hoo)
Y'all know what I like
(Woo hoo ooh ooh)
No, faithful ain't the some for me
