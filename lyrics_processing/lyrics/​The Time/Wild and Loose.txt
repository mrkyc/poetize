What time is it?

Hangin' by the backstage door, decked out like a queen
Your body's sayin' 21, but your face says 17
My intuition tells me that you're waitin' for the band
Before you get your hopes up, one thing understand

Wild and loose, that's how it's got to be
'Cause that's the only kind of dame that appeals to me
Wild and loose, the only life I know
Just havin' one big party from show to show

Talkin' trash to Jimmy Jam, "Tell us where the party's at"
We don't care who you came with, we'll take care of that
Just meet us at the motel, room 602
Tell your mama you won't be home 'cause we got plans for you

Wild and loose, that's how it's got to be
'Cause that's the only kind of dame that appeals to me
Wild and loose, the only life I know
Just havin' one big party from show to show

Where did you get the nerve to wear that miniskirt so high?
Don't worry, baby, I can keep a secret for as long as snow is white
Hey Jesse? "Yeah?"
Come here, man, guess what I did last night

Wild and loose, that's how it's got to be
'Cause that's the only kind of dame that appeals to me
Wild and loose, the only life I know
Just havin' one big party from show to show

Baby, you ain't no saint 'cause there ain't no in-between
Either you come or you can't, now get loose, let me hear you scream
Baby, you ain't no saint 'cause there ain't no in-between
Either you come or you can't, now get loose, let me hear you scream

Ah pardon me, say it one more time

Kim, wasn't the concert great?
(Minneapolis is mine)
Oh yeah, it sure was
(She was right in the front row)
(I know, man, she was sittin' there)
Did you see Jesse up there? Wasn't he fine?
(She was lookin' at me so nasty, you know what I'm sayin'?)
Oh yeah
(But the groove was so strong)
Morris looked so good
(I know what I'm gonna be doin' in the back of the bus to night!)
Yeah, but I think Jesse is cuter
Oh yeah!
(Am I right?)
I wonder what they are doin' after the concert
(Ah, I got it to night Jimmy)
Oh yeah, I got a strange feelin' they're nasty
(You had it last night?)
Yeah, I bet I'll remember this concert for the rest of my life
(The lady called me up last night)
(She said "Morris, you can be so cute, pretty, fine, handsome, whatever")
So will I
Did you see Jesse's eyes, aren't they pretty?
(What can I say? You know)
(Yeah, I know what you sayin' man)
Oh, they're so pretty
No one at school will ever believe I talked to Morris on the phone last night
(Hey look, are they sorry, that group that played before us?)
(Oh, I believe you)
(Jimmy Jam, you know we're good)
Hi's voice was so soft, he sounded so sweet
(You know when we stepped in that club)
Oh yeah, he's so cool
.(We saw Monte sittin' back there with his little girlfriends)
Yeah, but now I want to meet 'em in person
(I said "What is it like bein' cool?")
(Some people have it too cool)
(Oh, beat it jerk)
Alright, look
God, get away, eh yuck
(Man, look at these two chicks over man, look at this, look at this)
(Man, they look, they look wild and loose)
Kim, you ain't gonna believe it, the guys from The Time are right behind you
(Man, the girls are lookin' right)
(Go on, won't y'all try and rap at'em and see what time ...)
Are you serious?
(.... They should take them jeans off, that's what I like)
No, I'm not ... look, I ... I mean yes I am! Over there!
( I mean, you know, you know I got somethin' for 'em to put on)
Oh my God!
Can you believe it? Look
(You saw what I was with the other night?)
Should I look?
Should I go over and see if he remembers me?
Oh yeah
(It's kinda right, do whatever you want)
But what should I say?
Say somethin'
(I got the back of the bus tonight, that's all I got to say)
Hi ... Hi Morris
(Hmph! I know man. Hmm, excuse me. Hello, do I know you?)
Yeah, you talked to me on the phone last night
(Is that right? Well, you sure don't look like you sound)
Well excuse me!
(It's OK, baby, I got things to do I'll talk to you later)
Jerk! That was the worst concert I've ever been to
