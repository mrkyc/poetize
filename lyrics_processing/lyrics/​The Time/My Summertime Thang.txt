Mmm
Ooh, ah
Ooh, ah

My summertime thang
Make me feel alright
I feel good every night, yeah
Treat me like a lover would
And it feel so good, ooh
My summertime thang (Summertime)
Dancin' on the floor
Don't stop, let's do some more
We could have a total ball
And I'm happy once and for all
My summertime thang

Ooh, ah, ho
I think about you when I'm sleeping
I think about you when I'm at the mall
I think about the summer I first met you
Most of all, I think about the time you met me

My summertime thang (Never lets me down)
Never lets met down
Keeps working all year 'round
This thang is my one desire
It takes me higher
I say, it takes me higher, higher, higher

(Oh) Summertime
(Oh)
Oh, oh, summertime
Said make me feel, make me feel, make me feel alright

Yo, what's up M.D.?
Meet me at the mall, there's a cutie workin' there you will not believe
Ten minutes?
Nah, two
Alright, cool
Cool?
Alright, cool, I'll meet you there
Cool

My summertime thang
Make me feel alright (Alright, alright)
Uh, I feel good every night
Higher, higher, higher
Jimmy Jam? No Jimmy Jam, I...
Nah, no, that... nah, I need some fire
I got burned, got to cook with gas
(What about Teflon, man? What do ya... what do ya feel about that?)
No, it's got to be cast iron skillet (Cast?)
To be cast iron skillet (Cast iron?)
(Too many cooks in the kitchen)
(What?)
(That don't know how to cook it right)
Hold it. We already did that, we already did that. Wait a minute now
(Naw, I like that)
Naw man, we already did that, baby
(Naw)
(Find Jerome a girl or somethin', man. Get him outta here)
