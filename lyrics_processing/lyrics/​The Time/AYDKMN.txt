But girl, you just a little too cold
Hangin' with the good girls
But that ain't how you usually roll
That's why you lose me
Anytime you start to talk about love
Already know the truth
But I ain't tryin' to get you busted
You make an average picture
Look like a beautiful thang
I ain't trying to break your frame
But if a man's fallin' for your game
Baby, I'm-a let him like what he likes
CHORUS:
Baby, we groovy
Why you acting all persnickety
Walk right by me, don't even speak
Aw, you don't know me now
Let me jog your memory
You the same chick met me in the VIP
Had you in my room laying up next to me
Aw, you don't know me now
What you got to lose
Did you really think I'd put you on blast
You might also likeGirl, I refuse to shore the information I hove
So put your best foot forward before you flip
Trick him while he's thinkin' 'bout love
He see your potential
But he don't really know who you are
You make an average picture
Look like a beautiful thang
So ain't no need in actin' strange wit me
If a man's fallin' for your game
Baby, I'm-a let him like what he likes
CHORUS
Beautiful thang
Actin' strange wit me
He's fallin' for your game
Baby, I'm-a let him like what he likes
Look at you
Oh, you a ninja tonight
You stealth
You think I don't see ya
Go on, work your magic, baby
Do what you do
You forget
I know the game, I invented it
Work it, baby
It's Morris
You know what I like
You remember how you hollered my name
Go on, do your thing, walk on by me, girl
It's Morris, just walk by me
Aw, you don't know me now
