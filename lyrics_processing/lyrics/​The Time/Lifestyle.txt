Live at the city's best address
Look like I stepped straight out of a magazine
High fashion at its best
I'm on the Fortune Top 500
Playing the game, girl, with success
So much money, had to get my own armored car
And it's got my name on it
I've got everything that a man could want
But I m lonely I must confess
I went out lookin' for a little bit of company
That's when I saw this dime storin' at me
She saw herself in my hall of fame
Thinkin' her life would never be the some
Private jets and trips to Vegas
She fell in love with my lifestyle
Lifestyle
Lifestyle
She was feelin' me
But she fell in love with my lifestyle
Lifestyle
Lifestyle
And she wants it
Jumped in my ride, 'bout to take her home
She looked a mess so I called Jerome
(Yes, Morris?)
Would you get this girl a new dress
(Fa sho)
I don't wanna see nothing but sexiness
(Got it)
Ain't no preparing for what she's 'bout to see
When she stepped up in the crib with me she said, Daddy
(Ooh, you only got the best)
And in the foyer she started to undress
And she did everything that a man could want
And I liked it, I must confess
So when I'm looking for a little bit of company
I might call you, baby
(Would you, please)
She saw herself in my hall of fame
Thinkin' her life would never be the some
Takin' lavish trips all around the world
While doin' me, ha ha

She was feelin' me
But she fell in love with my lifestyle

Lifestyle
And she wanted it
We just met yesterday
And today you're sayin' you're in love
Is it me, the money, or the sex
That you think you're catchin' feelings for
All that you dream and more
That's what you come here for
To live the lifestyle of the rich and famous
Girl, if you're after it
You better pray for the lifestyle
And may the gods be with you
'Cause you ain't gettin' mine
Oh, she was feelin' me
'Cause she love my Bentley drop-top coupe
And she loved the way my stairway swooped at the crib
She loved the waterfall in the backyard
She want the shopping spree with my credit cord
Black, that is
She fell in love with my lifestyle
All the material things a man could ever hove
I could give her
Baby, you diggin' for my gold
And she wants it
