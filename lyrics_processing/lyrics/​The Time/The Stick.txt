My stick, I just love my stick
Mmm, my stick, I just love my stick

Girl, your ride is bad, but you can't compare
To my baby black Cadillac, oh so rare
Take a vacation, I don't care
'Cause I can get some stimulation anywhere

You just come too quick, I'd rather work my stick
Get a little satisfaction, work the stick in my ride
You just come too quick, I'd rather work my stick
Get a little satisfaction, work the stick in my ride
Get a little satisfaction, work the stick in my ride
Girl, you come too quick, much, much too quick
Girl, you come too quick, I'll just work the stick

Offer me your body, I have to pass
'Cause every time we make love, you run out of gas
Girl, my car's so bad, it runs on H2O
Now you can't compete, it's got the cruise control

You just come too quick, I'd rather work my stick
Get a little satisfaction, work the stick in my ride
You just come too quick, I'd rather work my stick
Get a little satisfaction, work the stick in my ride
Get a little satisfaction, work the stick in my ride
Girl, you come too quick, much, much too quick
Girl, you come too quick, I'll just work the stick

I've been drivin', baby, since the age of thirteen
I'm the baddest driver you've ever seen
You know I like it fast and I like it slow
Sometimes I let the top down when I wanna let go

You just come too quick, I'd rather work my stick
You just come too quick, I'd rather work my stick
You just come too quick, I'd rather work my stick
Get a little satisfaction, work the stick in my ride
Get a little satisfaction, work the stick in my ride
Get a little satisfaction, work the stick in my ride
Get a little satisfaction, work the stick in my ride

What time is it?
I said, what time is it?
You just come too quick, I'd rather work my stick
Somebody bring me a mirror so I can uh ... What song we on?
You just come too quick, I'd rather work my stick
Get a little satisfaction, work the stick in my ride
Get a little satisfaction, work the stick in my ride
Get a little satisfaction, work the stick in my ride
Get a little satisfaction, work the stick in my ride
Get a little satisfaction, work the stick in my ride
Get a little satisfaction, work the stick in my ride
Get a little satisfaction, work the stick in my ride
Get a little satisfaction, work the stick in my ride
Get a little satisfaction, work the stick in my ride
What time is it?
I'm just alright, oh no
I don't need you, baby, I'll just work the stick in my ride
I don't need your action, baby
Get a little satisfaction, work the stick in my ride
Get a little satisfaction, work the stick in my ride
Get a little satisfaction, work the stick in my ride
Get a little satisfaction, work the stick in my ride
Get a little satisfaction, work the stick in my ride
Get a little satisfaction, work the stick in my ride
Get a little satisfaction, work the stick in my ride
Get a little satisfaction, work the stick in my ride
You just come too quick, I'd rather work my stick
You just come too quick, I'd rather work my stick
You just come too quick, I'd rather work my stick

It's about time to go
I said, I don't need you, girl
Somebody bring me a mirror
So I can look at my stick
Hey
Alright
You wanna see it?
Should I take it out?
Take it out, man
