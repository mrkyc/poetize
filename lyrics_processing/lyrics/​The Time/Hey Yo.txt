You gonna find it up in here
'Cause we 'bout to get it crackin' like the
4th of July
Fireworks in full effect
Droppin' a beat that's so infectious
And baby, once you catch it
Oh, no, you can't keep still
And once you get into the flow
Hot and ready to roll
The sexy part is gonna kick in
I'm doin' my thang
Making you sweat
I ain't gonna stop until yo body gets wet
I got skilz, they say I'm the best
If you wanna piece of me
I'm-a let you work it out
CHORUS:
Hey yo
Let's rock the house tonight
Won't be no stoppin', baby
Once we get it poppin'
Hey yo
Let's rock it out tonight
Rockin' and rollin' to the wee hours of the mornin'
Hey yo
Let's rock the house tonight
Life's so much better when you live it on the edge
Hey yo
Let's rock it out tonight
Hey, let me rock you, rock you, rock you
You might also likeReady to get it up
Get it on
Feed the fire
With goose juice in a dranky drank
After last call baby
Meet me at the pimp palace
If you want to you can bring a friend
Doin' sex to your body and love to your mind
'Cause I ain't into giving cheap thrills
Kinda romantic
Yet MO orgasmic
Yeah, that kinda sexiness still exist
I'm doin my thing
Making you sweat
I ain't gonna stop until yo body gets wet
I got skilz, they say I'm the best
If you wanna piece of me
I'm-a let you work it out
CHORUS
Acting like you wanna be a jockey tonight
Don't need no whip when you're riding on a stallion baby
You're hot, but it's cool
'Cause that's just how I like it
Vibe so exotic
Overwhelmingly erotic
The Time is doing you
If you want more MO
Say you want MO
