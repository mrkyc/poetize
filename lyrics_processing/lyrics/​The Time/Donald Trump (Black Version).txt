Honey baby
You truly know it (You truly know it)
You look good
Tryin' your best to show it
If I were you, I would
True love and affection
These are nice (so nice)
But when a money man walks in the room, girl
You look more than twice
You look once
You look twice
Can I rap to you sugar tonight?

Donald Trump: black version
Maybe that's what you need
A man that fulfills your every wish
Your every dream
Donald Trump: black version
Come on, take a chance
A 1990's love affair
The real romance

You are the finest (You are the finest)
I have seen (I have seen)
And your disposition's so kind, you're never mean
Girl, you're to good to be true
But last night when you were asleep
You slipped big time, I heard you
You said your favorite color was green
So guess what?

Donald Trump: black version
Maybe that's what you need
A man that fulfills your every wish
Your every dream
Donald Trump: black version
Come on take a chance
A 1990's love affair
The real romance

Now look here, baby
I ain't tryin' to be 90 proof
But a super strong woman
She needs a super strong dude
Sweet words of love are helpful
But what goes a lot farther than that?
A hundred dollar dinner at Adriano's?
A brand new coat or a brand new hat?
Yes, I can do this

Donald Trump: black version
Maybe that's what you need (Oh, come on to the man)
A man that fulfills your every wish
Your every dream
Donald Trump: black version
Come on take a chance
A 1990's love affair
The real romance

(Diamonds and pearls) I wanna buy you things
(Maybe that's what you need)
'Cause I want all the other girls to bug
(A man that fulfills your every wish) My name is Morris, baby
(Your every dream) And I dig you
And when I dig somebody
(Donald Trump: black version) They stay dug
(Come on take a chance) They stay dug, baby
(A 1990's love affair)
(The real romance)
I..., I..., I..., I got what you need baby
Come on, baby
