"But the gist of things to come
Showed me nothing could be done"



"But that would just compound the hurt
That comes with such moments"
Well, I was drivin' up the highway
Thinkin' about, I don't know what in particular
What riot I would find when I got to Berkeley, I suppose?
When I noticed these strange vibration
Or was I fallin' in love?
Woo! Well
I don't have a radio in my car
So the noises I was hearin'
Frightened me enough that I began to wonder about the wisdom
Of wanderin' along the road at eighty-five
Mmm-my!
Now, I should explain that I often drive alone
But this time I was givin' my friend and his wife a ride
Or was she fallin' in love?
Now my friend don't drive
And he's not used to the strange vibrations in my '60 Dodge
But then if I had more, uh, money I'd probably be worried about why the plane was wigglin'

No matter what your experience or precaution
But I just had a tune-up
Well, anyway, you can't "dodge" the one with your number on it, so to speak
Ooh-ooh-hoo, my motor
Why do I always seem to vibrate with my friend's old lady?
(Or was she falling in love?)
It probably has to do with the fact I don't have one myself
And I don't want to mess with anyone else's
So, whereas, I'd come on to somebody desirable
I'm attracted to a chick who feels that I won't bite
Which is why, when the car ground to a halt near Kingsburg
It was Fred who said that I needed a new transmission
I mean, after all, without a transmission, you can't go
I mean, you need an engine, but that's what you get on
And getting it on requires the transmission
Which Fred felt under some tension to provide
Although the one that he had was not negotiable
Uh, necessarily
