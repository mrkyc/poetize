I'm hearing the light from the window
I'm seeing the sound of the sea
My feet have come loose from their moorings
I'm feeling quite wonderfully free

And I think I will travel to Rio
Using the music for flight
There's nothing I know of in Rio
But it's something to do with the night
It's only a whimsical notion
To fly down to Rio tonight
And I probably won't fly down to Rio
But then again, I just might

There's wings to the thought behind fancy
There's wings to the thought behind play
And dancing to rhythms of laughter
Makes laughter the rhythm of rain

And I think I will travel to Rio
Using the music for flight
There's nothing I know of in Rio
But it's something to do with the night
It's only a whimsical notion
To fly down to Rio tonight
And I probably won't fly down to Rio
But then again, I just might

"This is the first call for Flight 77 to Rio de Janeiro, now boarding at Gate 17. This is the first call."

I feel such a sense of well-being
The problems have come to be solved
And what I thought was proper for battle
I see now is proper for love

And I think I will travel to Rio
Using the music for flight
There's nothing I know of in Rio
But it's something to do with the night
It's only a whimsical notion
To fly down to Rio tonight
And I probably won't fly down to Rio
But then again, I just might

I think I will travel to Rio
Using the music for flight
There's nothing I know of in Rio
But it's something to do with the night
It's only a whimsical notion
To fly down to Rio tonight
I probably won't fly down to Rio
But then again, I just might
"Reno? Why Reno?"
