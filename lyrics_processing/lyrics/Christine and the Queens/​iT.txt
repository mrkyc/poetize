With iT
I become the death Dickinson feared
With iT
I'm a red admiral on this ship
And I raise
With infinite forms of coronation
I rule
Over my all my dead impersonations
'Cause I've got it
I'm a man now
I've got it
I'm a man now
And I won't let you steal it, I bought it for myself
I'm a man now (She lies, she lies)

I hate
The production work pulling my hair
Because
Their teeth should ravage a golden beard
I've lost
Some eyeless friends whose blood runs cold
When you people
In silence pretense tends to be old
See Christine and the Queens LiveGet tickets as low as $381You might also like
'Cause I won
I'm a man now
'Cause I've got it
I am a man now
And I won't let you steal it, I bought it for myself
I'm a man now (She lies, she lies)
Oh lord!

She wants to be a man, a man
But she lies
She wants to be born again, again
But she'll lose
She draws her own crotch by herself
But she'll lose
Because it's a fake
It's a fake, it's a fake, it's a fake

No! I've got it
I'm a man now
Yes, I've got it
I am a man now
And there's nothing you can do to make me change my mind
I'm a man now (She lies, she lies)
Oh lord!
She's a man now
She's a man now
And there's nothing we can do to make her change her mind
She's a man now
She's a man now
She's a man now
And there's nothing we can do to make her change her mind
She's a man now
She's a man now
She's a man now
And there's nothing we can do to make her change her mind
