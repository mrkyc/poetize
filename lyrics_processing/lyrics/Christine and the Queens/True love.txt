Do you know how it feels to be inside it
But never talk about it?
Do you know how it feels?
Do you know how it feels?
I'm talking to you
I'm always talking to you
So you know how it feels

So I can't believe you saw me crying
When I cry, baby, I cry for you (Yeah)
No, I can't believe you saw me dancing
When I dance, baby, I dance for you (Yeah)

Do you know how to love?
I'll show you, oh, I'll show you
So we know how to love (Oh)
'Cause I need you to love me
I need you to love me

I can't believe you saw me crying
'Cause when I cry, baby, I cry for you (Yeah)
No, I can't believe you saw me dancing
When I dance, baby, I dance for you (Yeah)

Angel of light, take me higher
Make me forget my mother
With your dark brown eyes staring at me
With your dark eyes staring at me
Angel of light, take me higher
Make me forget my mother
With your dark brown eyes staring at me
With your dark eyes staring at me

They're making the blame, it still feels the same (Right)
I'm doing the most, hundred of those years crying
You said you wanted us soft besides you
Any word on me, any one pass through me
It's so emotional
(I think about it all the time)
They're begging on me
I pass on their lives
I wait on the floor
Nothing making sense
I'm one on their knees
They begging me please (Let me tell you something)
Holy seconds to most
Trying to sit in your league
On a ride
Angel of light, take me higher
Make me forget my mother
With your dark brown eyes staring at me
With your dark eyes staring at me
Angel of light, take me higher
Make me forget my mother
With your dark brown eyes staring at me
With your dark eyes staring at me
Angel of light, take me higher
Make me forget my mother
With your dark brown eyes staring at me
