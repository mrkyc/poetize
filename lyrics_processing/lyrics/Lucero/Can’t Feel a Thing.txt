A bastard from the start, but a charming one at that
Bad reputation, but I really ain't that bad
It's alright, I can't feel a thing
A beauty from the city, dolled up in a dress of gold
I like them high heels, but she won't wear them no more
It's alright, I can't feel a thing
She's nothing short of perfect as she's falling to the ground
Nothing short of Armageddon's gonna slow her down
Nothing short of dying's gonna bring me any peace
But I ain't really worried, cause I can't feel a thing

Got so much to tell her, but the words seem to get lost
The bottle's empty and I can't complete the call
It's alright, I can't feel a thing
She ain't on the phone, and she ain't on her way
And all the messages keep going up in flames
It's alright, I can't feel a thing
It's nothing short of Vegas and a bar that's never closed
Nothing short of lying down and waking up alone
And nothing short of dying's gonna bring me any peace
Well, I ain't really worried cause I can't feel a thing
You might also like
It's alright
Well, it's alright
A little less pain, every time I fall
It's alright
It's alright
Until you get so tired, you can't feel nothing at all
Nothing at all

She asked me if I loved her, and I showed her the tattoo
Wasn't no answer, but for then it had to do
It's alright, I can't feel a thing
I listened to a band in a bar outside downtown
There ain't enough girls wearing high heels in this crowd
It's alright, I can't feel a thing
She's nothing short of perfect as she's falling to the ground
Nothing short of Armageddon's gonna slow her down
Nothing short of dying's gonna bring me any peace
Ah hell, but I ain't really worried, cause I can't feel a thing
Can't feel anything
Oh I can't feel anything
