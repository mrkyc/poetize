Hey darlin', do you gamble?
Cause I'm running the inside track
And I'm taking all that I can
And I'm never looking back
Now, I believe you should run with me for a while

Now, I believe you should run with me
Until this Texas sun falls into the sea
If I shed this skin of iron and this breath of kerosene
Darling, would you take a chance on me?

There's no map shows where I'm going
And I can't say just where I've been
But with you, girl, by my side, Lord
There ain't no game that I can't win
Now, I believe you should run with me for a while

And, I believe that you should run with me
Until this Texas sun falls into the sea
If I shed this skin of iron and this breath of kerosene
Darling, would you take a chance on me?
You might also like
And I know you don't know what odds I've got
But intuition sure counts for a lot
Now, you looked me square in the eyes more than once tonight
I figured you and me, we'll make it just fine
We'll make it just fine

Hey darling, do you gamble?
I'll be your gambling man
Now we'll take all that we can
And we'll never look back again
Now I believe you should run with me
Hell, now, I believe that you should run with me for a while

And now, I believe that you should run with me
Until this Texas sun falls into the sea
If I shed this skin of iron and this breath of kerosene
Oh, darling, would you take a chance on me?
Hell, now,  I believe that you should run with me
Until this Texas sun falls into the sea
If I shed this skin of iron and this breath of kerosene
Darling, would you take a chance on me?
