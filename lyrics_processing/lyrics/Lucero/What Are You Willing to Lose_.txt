So what if all my heroes are the losing kind?
Oh, we ended up with nothing, but we put up a fight
And most of it was choices we never asked to choose
The rest of it was luck and now we're out of that too

What are you willing to lose?
What are you willing to lose?

I spent every dollar just to try and earn a dime
I'd try to make you hate me just to try to make you mine
Now it doesn't really matter if I'm telling you the truth
What you see is all that's left, the rest is up to you now

What are you willing to lose?
Oh, what are you willing to lose?

Now it's so, so far gone
In these losing fights, I'm just the losing kind
Can't say if it's right or wrong
Well so we keep on
No one else to blame, going down in flames
Saw it coming all along

So what if all my heroes are the losing kind
Not a chance in hell but still they lay it on the line
Would you give it all away for what you want to do
Would you keep on going if you couldn't make it through, now

What are you willing to lose?
Oh, what are you willing to lose?

Well it's so, so far gone
In these losing fights, just the losing kind
Can't say if it's right or wrong
Well so we keep on
No one else to blame, going down in flames
Saw it coming all along

Don't be so shy girl, I've seen your tendencies before
Woke up next morning with them scattered on my floor
Well come on little darling, can't you cut us all some slack?
Cause the winners, they all took off babe and they're never coming back
Never never coming back

Well it's so far gone
In these losing fights, just the losing kind
Can't say it's right or wrong
Well so we keep on
No one else to blame, going down in flames
Saw it coming all along
Well it's so, so far gone
Well it's so, so far gone
Well so we keep on
No one else to blame, going down in flames
Saw it coming all along
Saw it coming all along
