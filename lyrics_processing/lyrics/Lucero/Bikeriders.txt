Kathy met a girlfriend at a place around Grant
Swore if she got out alive she'd, not go back again
Fellas didn't know her and they scared her half to death
Hand prints on her jeans, she would have just got up and left
That's when she saw Benny standing, over by the bar
Sat back down and waited 'til he came over to talk
Later on that night, as she was walking out the door
Benny started up his bike and the boys came out for more

They picked her up and put her on the back of Benny's bike
Now Kathy's been with Benny Bauer ever since that night
She's tried to leave him many times, can't quite get away
Seen more jails and courts and laywers than she'd like to say
That Benny's always been a fighter, that'll never change
Kathy takes him home and heals him up, it's all the same
He made it from the club room all the way out to the street
They beat him with the barstools but he made it on his feet

Kathy's running to her boy, picks him up and takes him home
And Benny's crying "Kathy please, I'm sorry don't you know?"
I'm sorry don't you know, I'm sorry don't you know?

At a bar they call Stop Light the fellas drink their beer
Women with their hair done up, they make it very clear
Which one of the fellas all is theirs and can't be touched
They're tellin' me that motorcycle riders just give up
They're talkin' to the pretty ladies, everyone they can
I never seen the trouble caused all by just one dance
If Benny don't get himself shot tonight, I wish he did
When he gets home

Now Kathy's dating Benny and he keeps her by his side
Kathy's still the cutest girl these boys will ever find
Riders line up BSA's out on the scrambler's tracks
Levi's, jeans, and a leather jacket numbers on their backs
Benny's bike is too big to race up 250 class
They make him start way up the hill, up by the railroad tracks
Tomorrow, they'll all ride across the Illinois state line
Motorcycle Blessing at the St Christopher Shrine

Kathy's walking out the door, leaving Benny all alone
And Benny's crying "Kathy please, baby don't you go"
Baby don't you go, baby don't you go
Kathy mean it this time
Just leave in the middle of the night
His wallet's on your table, boots on your floor
The car is parked right outside your back door
So leave him asleep in your bed and
