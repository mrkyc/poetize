Surrounded by villains and the years are catching up
She's a dark eyed beauty and a dangerous fiend
She says dance me outside knocks the boys off their feet
Aw Juniper, which way you gonna run now?
You stay on the run long enough and you're done, oh it's clear
Juniper come here
Now there ain't no need being lonesome
Ain't no need running round
No there ain't no need for the boys down the street
Honey I'm all yours right now
I said Juniper come here
Well she walks like a panther but she's falling apart
She's gone half crazy with a stitched up heart
And she drinks like a sailor at the bottom of the sea
But she sings like a siren in the belly of the beast
Aw Juniper, girl I'm back in town
I been away for a year and a day, oh my dear
Juniper come here
Now there ain't no need being lonesome
Ain't no need running round
No there ain't no need for the boys down the street
Honey I'm all yours right now
I said Juniper come here
I woke up last week down in Dallas
Had an Indian maiden tattooed on my chest
Now I ain't saying she looks just like you
But when I sobered up and I saw her face I headed west
Back to you girl, hell, I always loved you best
Aw Juniper, which way you gonna run now?
You been on the run long enough aw girl, I'm in love
Juniper you're the one
Now there ain't no need being lonesome
Ain't no need running round
No there ain't no need for the boys down the street
Honey I'm all yours right now
Now there ain't no need being lonesome
Ain't no need running round
No there ain't no need for the boys down the street
Honey I'm all yours right now
Honey I'm all yours right now
