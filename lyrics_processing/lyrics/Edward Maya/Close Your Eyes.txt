Take my hand
For so long I'm sitting here all alone
Come with me
Set me free
You can see my love was here all along
Close your eyes
Take my hand
For so long I'm sitting here all alone
Come with me
Set me free
You can see my love was here all along
When I see you
I want you right now
Close to mine heart
I want to hurt you
Baby you are all, all my life
Right now
When I feel you
You take me somewhere faraway
Baby, when I touch you
I'm burning so hot
I can lose you tonight
