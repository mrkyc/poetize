Now, I'm craving your body, is this real
Temperature's rising, I don't want to feel
I'm in the wrong place to be real
And I'm longing to love you just for a night
Kissing and hugging and holding you tight
Please let me love you
With all my might

Reasons, the reasons that we're here
The reasons that we fear
Our feelings won't disappear, oh
And after the love game has been played
All our illusions were just a parade
And all our reasons start to fade

(La, la, la-la, la) La
(La, la-la, la)
(La, la-la, la)
(La, la-la, la)
(La, la-la, la) La
(La, la-la, la)
(La, la-la, la, ah, ah-ah, ah, oh)

(After all our reasons why) All our reasons why
(All our reasons were a lie) All our reasons were a lie
(After all our reasons)
Love was left aside (Ahh)

I'm longing to love you for one night
Please let me love you with all of my might, baby
Ooh, baby


Yeah, reasons, the reasons that we're here
The reasons that we fear
Our feelings won't disappear (Disappear)
They won't disappear
And after the love games have been played
All our illusions were just a parade
And all the reasons start to fade

And, in the morning when I rise
No longer feeling hypnotized
Find our reasons, our reasons, our reasons
Had no pride
(After all our reasons why) All our reasons why
(All our reasons were a lie) All our reasons were a lie
(After all our reasons) Ohh, ohh-ohh
Love was left aside (Ahh)
Hey, hey-hey-hey-yeah, yeah

Oh, where, yeah, ooh, baby
I can't find the reasons
That my love won't disappear
Can't find the reasons
Why I love you
Baby, my dear
Can't find the reasons
Wanna love you all night
Can't find the reasons
Gotta squeeze ya, real tight
Can't find the reasons
Baby, yeah
For my tears
Can't find the reasons
Why I love ya
