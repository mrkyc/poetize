I went back to my hometown of Jackson, Mississippi
The only problem is:
I've never been there in my life!
I was dressed up like Moses; I had a sheet on me
I had a dirty ol' cleanin' mop fer a beard
And, in my hand...
In my hand was a cane
And, I hope nothin' ever happens to me...
Nothin' oughta happen to me...
Nothin' better happen to me...
In my life...
...Like that...
...Again...
OH, NO!... NOT AGAIN!
I'm goin' back to Jackson with a stick in my hand...
I spoke with Jesus last night
He come down out the sky; He was a Flamin' Man
He gived me a fright!
He said:
"Hop a freight for Mississippi. Forget about Ol' Cincinnati."
My mortal soul was in jeopardy; I had to obey
I knew Baby Jesus was the only way
Back to Jackson with a stick in my hand!
You might also likeI donned a linen sheet; I had a dusty old mop
That I put on my face
He handed me a cane and some orders from the top
It was to be a test case
It was after dark when I hopped off that train
I walked to the Jackson Rattler football game
The Booster Club stared at my beard when I walked through that gate:
"I'm a buddy of the Saviour's, and I get a cut rate!"
I walked on the field; I stopped the Marching Band
When I climbed up that scoreboard, I had a stick in my hand!
"GET THEE BEHIND ME ...!"
I looked down...The goal posts became big, wigglin' snakes!
All those Rattler fans had the shakes!
The crowd cut and ran when they saw some fa-a-ang
I was cryin' mercy, but, still them serpents sprang
THEY BIT THE BOOSTERS!
I'm back in Cincinnati with some cuffs on my hands; I lead a cushioned life
When, in my padded cell appears a Flamin' Man; He said that I had done right
He lays me down, fully rest-assured of my glorious fate:
Cuttin' fool with St. Peter at the Pearly Gate!
