Yeah, I know, every single road in this whole town
Know a little something that's going down
Whatchu say I pick you up, right now?
And girl, go ahead and reach back
Into that iced up, twelve pack
Doesn't really matter which one you grab, no it don't

Baby, its all good, good, good, good
Dance in the dust, kick it up, climb up on that hood, in the woods
Full moon, no moon, long as in with you
Your plan, my plan, girl come on
Either way, its a summer sky watching us fall
Baby, its all good, good, good, good
Yeah, its all good

Out there, we're so scared
Don't you love how this feels?
Its laying back on my windshield
We don't have to stay all night, but maybe we will

Its all good, good, good, good
Dance in the dust, kick it up, climb up on that hood, in the woods
Full moon, no moon, long as in with you
Your plan, my plan, girl come on
Either way, its a summer sky watching us fall
Baby its all good
Its all good
You might also like
Find a song on a slow jam sing along
Wanna rock to it all night long
We can play it over, and over again
And if we don't stop when it ends, Its all good
Yeah, it is

Baby, its all good, good, good, good
Dance in the dust, kick it up, climb up on that hood, in the woods
Full moon, no moon, long as in with you
Your plan, my plan, girl come on
Either way, its a summer sky watching us fall
Baby, its all good, good, good, good
Yeah, baby its all good, good good
Your plan, my plan, girl come on
Either way, its a summer sky watching us fall
Baby, its all good
