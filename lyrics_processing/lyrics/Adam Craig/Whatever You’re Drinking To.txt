Come on

Mighta had a good day
Mighta had a bad week
Mighta just got paid
Or maybe you're somewhere in between
Might be down on your luck
Might be up on cloud nine
Might be all out of love
Or you're looking for some tonight

Here's to the ones who came here to cut loose
That need a little something they can raise a cup to
Here's to the ones that want to spend some money
On 12-ounce ice-cold American honey
Here's to the ones getting over goodbye
One, two, three, four shots at a time
Hold 'em up high if you're gonna give it hell tonight
Yeah, here's to you
And whatever you're drinking to
Yeah, whatever you're drinking to

To a pretty good buzz
To a damn good song
Yeah, to a might've just met her
But it keeps getting better
As the night goes on
