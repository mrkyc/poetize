You grew up in a town
Where the clock in the town square
Gets it right twice a day
Rode a Bluebird to Friday night
Games where them Friday lights
Shined on the team that took State
Took a Skoal can from your old man
Packed it with your right hand
And faded a ring in your jeans
Put a fishing hook in your ball cap
Turned around then talked trash
About a place you swore that you'd leave

If you're lucky you mixed your Dr. Dre
With some Tim McGraw in a Chevrolet
Handed down from your daddy to your brother to you
You ran red lights, stayed away from the blue
If you're lucky you got hammered in a buddy's barn
Then hillbilly slipped with a girl on your arm
That you swore you would marry but you didn't
Naw, it wasn't all pretty but you lived it
If you're lucky

You mowed yards, you washed cars
So come time in late March
You'd be on the beach for spring break
You threw one hell of a party
Took shots, yelled, "Go Army"
For your buddy 'fore he shipped away
You got less regrets and never-dids
More I-was-theres than should've beens
You might also like
Yeah, if you're lucky you mixed your Dr. Dre
With some Tim McGraw in a Chevrolet
Handed down from your daddy to your brother to you
You ran red lights, stayed away from the blue
If you're lucky, you got hammered in a buddy's barn
Got a half-true story, a full-blown scar
And now remember back when it started with it
Naw, it wasn't all pretty but you lived it
If you're lucky
If you're lucky

Yeah, if you're lucky you mixed your Dr. Dre
With some Tim McGraw in a Chevrolet
Handed down from your daddy to your brother to you
You ran red lights, stayed away from the blue
If you're lucky you heard Psalm 23
Your mama fried chicken, and your roots run deep
You watched the sunset fade with a pretty girl
Took a long slow sip to a hell of a world
If you're lucky
