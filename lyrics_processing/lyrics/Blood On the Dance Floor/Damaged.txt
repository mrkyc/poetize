I feel the knife
Is cutting slow
I wish I could say
My intentions weren't deadly
I feel like
I am letting go
I wish I had said
How easy it is to fall for me
I feel like you
Deserve to know
I wish I didn't have to drag
You down with me
That I'll get you high
And leave you low
But I have no shame
In pleading guilty

I damage like a savage
Ruin beauty as I ravage
Throw you out
Like you're garbage
I create my own carnage
My walls won't cave in
I won't play pretend
I'm afraid to let you in
Start over
Just to fuck up again
You might also like
I fucked up again
I opened a wound
Tore the sutures out of me
And only thought of you
I fucked us again
I killed our love true
Tore our world apart
And only hurt you

My head is filled
With disease
I told you, you were warned
From the fucking start
My heart is black
And empty
I told you when our love died
It's my fault
My body is cold
And bleeding
And now there's nothing I can do
To fix what I've done
Without you here
With me
I got what I want, I'm leaving now
My battle's won
I damage like a savage
Ruin beauty as I ravage
Throw you out
Like you're garbage
I create my own carnage
My walls won't cave in
I won't play pretend
I'm afraid to let you in
Start over
Just to fuck up again

I fucked up again
I opened a wound
Tore the sutures out of me
And only thought of you
I fucked us again
I killed our love true
Tore our world apart
And only hurt you

Damaged from no recovery
My pain burned into your memory
I'm drowning in a sea of misery
Will anyone
Come and save me?
I feel the knife
Is cutting slow
I feel like
I am letting go
I feel like you
Deserve to know
That I'll get you high
And I'll leave you low
I feel the knife
Is cutting slow
I feel like
I am letting go
I feel like you
Deserve to know
That I'll get you high
