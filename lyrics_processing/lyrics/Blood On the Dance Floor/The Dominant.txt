The helplessness of the pain
The pleasure of my dominance
The raw core of myself
The only one that can reach that revered place
In the most sacred way
I belong to you and you belong to me
Kiss my neck, bite me
Pull my hair, trace my spine
Hold me down, use your tongue
Make me moan, don't stop
Kiss my neck, bite me
Pull my hair, trace my spine
Hold me down, use your tongue
Make me moan, don't stop
(It feels good) It feels good
(Hey, it feels good) It feels good
(You know it feels good) It feels good
(Oh, it feels good) It feels good
(When I'm inside you)
It's not enough to conquer
One must know how to seduce
On the screen to fetishize
I'll be your escape from daily life
Role play all your fetishes
Your deepest darkest fantasies
Straight out of the movies
In between mirrors just like a dream
