Sideshow Bob: A dish best served cold
Homer: Is it ice cream?
Sideshow Bob: No, revenge!
Take your pants off!
Well, we just wanna see you naked

Blah, blah, blah
With all your bullshit
XXX
Crossing out the hit list
Hunter Moore on speed dial
You'll be famous for a while
BAMF Mode has been activated
Why did our love grow complicated?
Cheated on me and broke my heart
Gonna show the world your private parts
A bright idea popped in my head
Figured out a way to get even instead
Found a website called I-A-U
And guess what honey? I'm gonna post your nudes
Revenge is best served cold and sweet
So face the music and accept defeat
Payback when I click submit
Game over on all these tricks

Is anyone up?
Is anyone down?
To get revenge
On this fuckin' town
Is anyone up?
Is anyone down?
We'll upload your shit
And we'll take you down
You always said
You would die to be famous
But you never thought it would be
Because of your anus
You fucked up
When you fucked around
Now another E slut
Making mom and dad proud

Paging Dr. Faggot
Photoshopping my revenge
God knows where that ass has been
Every guy who's texted you
Had a little piece or two
That shit's no longer my concern
Mess with me and feel the burn
N B to the HNC
Write it on your ass and send it to me
Straight to the gutter from where you came
That sloppy slut pussy
Got you fame
Call it that but you got it all wrong
Your face is famous for sucking my dong
See you crying
What's the problem?
Post your nudes
Girl I straight robbed them
Your Facebook
Screencap
Reaction pic
Fap, fap, fap!

Diamond plated princess
With a mouth full of cum
Wrapped head in lace
And head full of dumb
This is the start, not a war
Bitch I already won!
Hey motherfucker
Tell me who's laughing now
All these bitch boy motherfuckin'
Faggots with their asses out
Don't try to justify
This isn't revenge
This is what you had coming
To you in the end

And I will strike down upon thee
With great vengeance and furious anger
Those who would attempt
To poison and destroy my brothers
