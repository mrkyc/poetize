I got money and hoes
In different area codes
I walk down the block
They want my cock
I'm flashing my bling
There sucking my ding
Asphxiation prescription perfection
So I walk up to the bar
Looking like a star
When diamonds and ice
Look o so nice
Hi I'm danger!
Hi I'm gangster!
Hi I'm mighter than
Any Power Ranger!

Don't even dare
You can't fucking compare
You best prepare
I'm about to declair
My money affair
Will be your worst nightmare
Your rap is whack
So lay off the crack
Just follow me
And be obscene
Leave parents feeling
Disgustin
So honey! Get some money!
Fuck me like a Playboy Bunny

Make love not war
More Stellar than Star Wars
I'm so epic
My collection is eclitic
If the price is right
You'll be mine tonight
I'm from the streets bitch
And I'm hood rich
My grill is so ill
It'll make your titties spill
Yea I Kill Bill
So lay off my thrill
