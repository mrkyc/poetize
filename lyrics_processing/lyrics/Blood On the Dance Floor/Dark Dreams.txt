Have you ever dreamed that you were
Naked in front of a crowd
And you felt exposed
Or you had a dream that you were
Going down a hill and you were pumping the brake
And you couldn't stop and you were out of control
Or another dream is that you are being chased
By a malevolent pursuer
And they're chasing you along the mountain top
And you can't get away
What do these dreams mean
Are they meant to torment you
Or are they meant to help you
My view is that these dreams
Are meant to help you
In terms of dealing with the terror in yourself's
So you can become clear
It's one thing to say I had a nightmare
And I was upset by it and thank god it was only a dream
It's another thing
To say okay I had this nightmare
And I've been chased by a dark man
In a dark mask
To be able to turn around and say who is this man
To look back in your life and say who is this man
Is it my father, is it my uncle, is it a teacher, who is this
So that you can stop running from them
That's the purpose of dreams
In order to use them as intuitive prompts
So that you're not running away from yourself all the time
And living a life that's driven by fear

All of these dark dreams
Gotta mean something

All alone late at night
When the nightmares come alive
I start to lose all control
Tearing at the sheets to save my soul
I'm falling down to the ground
Don't understand what is around
I'm losing my fucking mind
Insecurities are eating me alive

Dark dreams, all night
Dancing, moonlight
Beauty, star bright
Save me tonight
Wake up
Wake me up
Wake up
Wake me up

All of these dark dreams
Gotta mean something
All of these dark dreams
Gotta mean something
All alone I dream again
Can't escape the monsters in my head
They are always right behind me
Chasing me down a dead end street
Let's sail away far away
To the sky, stars and beyond
Now I lay me down to sleep
To the sun and infinity

All of these dark dreams
They keep haunting me
I don't know what to do
Facing impending doom
Wake up
Wake me up
Wake up
Wake me up

All of these dark dreams
Gotta mean something
All of these dark dreams
Gotta mean something
All of these dark dreams
Gotta mean something
(I don't really know
Maybe it's nothing)
All these dark dreams
Gotta mean something
(I don't really know
Maybe it's nothing)
I've got these dark dreams
They keep haunting me
I don't know what to do
Facing impending doom
Wake up
Wake me up
Wake up
Wake me up

Sail away yes far away
To the sun yes here we come
Now I lay me down to sleep
