Fasten your seat belts
It's gonna be a bumpy ride
What? What? What? What?
Throw it up, throw it up
Just don't give a fuck
What? What? What? What?
Throw it up, throw it up
Just don't give a fuck

Cut to the chase, come get a taste
I'll tell a bitch straight to the face
Hey, Lil' Kim, get on my nuts
This flow that I spill will make you blush
Up and down and up, up, up, suck me til I b-b-bust
Triple "X" like Ven Dee, rocking in my Fendi
Money, bitches, sex and fame
I'll teach you how to run this game
Katy Perry's on my pole
That bitch gets hot, then she gets cold
Can't catch me, I'm at the top
Smoke 'em dead, I'm cream of the crop
Party on dudes, girls sending nudes
I just sucked your girlfriend's boobs
You might also like
Jet black diamond hair
People stare, I don't care
Want a taste? Sure I'll share
Gotta be big, I'll take you there
Glammed up, fabulous
Looking hot, dangerous
So vicious, delicious
I got you fucking like it's fitness

What? What? What? What?
Throw it up, throw it up
Just don't give a fuck
What? What? What? What?
Throw it up, throw it up
Just don't give a fuck

You must be out your mind
Slap it up and give me high five
I'm getting rich, I'm getting fit
You can suck my lollipop stick
I'll throw a dildo in your grave
Party up to start a rave
Grab your drinks and score your drugs
Pimp your momma at the club
You know you want my taste
Stand up, congratulate
It's not about the money
It's all about our fans
You made us who we are
Our love goes epic far
Jet black diamond hair
People stare, I don't care
Want a taste? Sure I'll share
Gotta be big, I'll take you there
Glammed up, fabulous
Looking hot, dangerous
So vicious, delicious
I got you fucking like it's fitness

What? What? What? What?
Throw it up, throw it up
Just don't give a fuck
What? What? What? What?
Throw it up, throw it up
Just don't give a fuck
What? What? What? What?
Throw it up, throw it up
Just don't give a fuck
What? What? What? What?
Throw it up, throw it up
Just don't give a fuck

The freaks, the faggots
The geeks, the savages
The rogues, the rebels
The dissident devils
The artists, the martyrs
And all the fire starters
Break free from this hell
Stand up and rebel
Be proud of being different
Speak loud and admit it
Look hot and dangerous
Be strong or you'll get dissed
Don't ever forget
Haters
Make us
Famous
What? What? What? What?
Throw it up, throw it up
Just don't give a fuck
What? What? What? What?
Throw it up, throw it up
Just don't give a fuck
What? What? What? What?
Throw it up, throw it up
Just don't give a fuck
What? What? What? What?
Throw it up, throw it up
