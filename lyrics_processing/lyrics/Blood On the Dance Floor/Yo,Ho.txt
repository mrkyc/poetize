A pirate walks into the bar
The bartender asks
"What's with the steering wheel in your pants?"
The pirate says
"Arr! It's driving me nuts"

Now I've been riding across the seven seas
Looking for a girl from another fantasy
I keep a big ship, they call me Captain King
I got the eye patch, tri hat, rollin' like a pirate
Shiver my timbers, fuck you till you're limber
Freaky deaky, till you get leaky
Like Run DMC, it's tricky
So animated, might as well call me Mickey
Pedal to the medal, red eyes like a devil
Raise the white flag, can't reach my level
Like arr, arr!
Flow sick like sars!
XXX till I hit your mark
Ahoy! Ahoy! I put that happy to the joy
Fuck with me and I'll play you like a GameBoy
Ninja, skin ya, throw you in a blender
Chop, chop, chop, I'm a motherfucking pirate!

Battleship, you just got sunk (Oh!)
Boy, you think you can handle this?
Is your port hole big enough for my ship?
It's not the motion of the ocean and size of the thing
Cause we ain't getting nowhere with these fuckin' water wings
I used to be ballin', now I'm just straight dunkin'
Gold stars for my rhymes, I got all the boys suckin'
Jealous bitches start hatin', cause it's not them we fuckin'

Now and then we had a hope that if we lived and were good
God would permit us to be pirates

Yo, ho, ho, it's a pirate's life for me
Yo, ho, ho, it's a pirate's life for me
Fire!
