You are my everything
You taught me how to sing
You took a chance on me
Opened my heart to see
You had the golden key
That simply sets me free
You are my only hope
The one I need the most
You are my light and dark
The ever-shining spark
You are my other half
You always make me laugh
You are my dearest friend
Forever 'til the end
We're simply meant to be
For it is plain to see
(Falling, falling, falling, falling, falling, falling)

So in love with you
(In the lovestruck)
And all the things you do
(It's a lovestruck)
I know you'll get me through
(In the lovestruck)
I was livin' in hell
Until you casted your spell
So in love with you
(In the lovestruck)
And all the things you do
(It's a lovestruck)
I know you'll get me through
(In the lovestruck, oh la-la-la, la-la, la-la-la lovestruck)
You might also like
I can't see myself like you
Now that I've had a taste
Every time I close my eyes
I feel your lips
I see your face
I'm taking back every hateful thing I've ever said about love
I've realized I need it and baby, you're the one
I only smile when I'm with you
I spend all day missing you
I'm lovestruck, in your head
Every thought, every breath
You've turned this boy into a man
I promise to love you like no one can
Here we are, hand in hand
My dream came true, now I'm your man
(Falling, falling, falling, falling, falling, falling)

So in love with you
(In the lovestruck)
And all the things you do
(It's a lovestruck)
I know you'll get me through
(In the lovestruck)
I was livin' in hell
Until you casted your spell
So in love with you
(In the lovestruck)
And all the things you do
(It's a lovestruck)
I know you'll get me through
(In the lovestruck, oh la-la-la, la-la, la-la-la lovestruck)
I want to scream into this world
That you are my one and only girl
I was a fool and jaded too
Before I fell in love with you
So in love with you
So in love with
I'm fallin'
I'm fallin'
Im fallin' in love
(Lovestruck)

So in love with you
(In the lovestruck)
And all the things you do
(It's a lovestruck)
I know you'll get me through
(In the lovestruck)
I was livin' in hell
Until you casted your spell
So in love with you
(In the lovestruck)
And all the things you do
(It's a lovestruck)
I know you'll get me through
(In the lovestruck, oh la-la-la, la-la, la-la-la lovestruck)
Cupid got me when I let down my guard
Who knew it was so great?
Who knew I'd fall this hard?
We can run away and never look back
Forget our battered past
