Uh uh uh uh uh
Uh uh uh

I've got this gun, to your head
I've got blood, on these hands
I'll be your eternal never-ending
I'll be the end of your beginning
I'm the battle to your every war
I'm the first rip, for everything torn
I've got no room in this heart
Gonna tear you apart

Death to your heart!
And I'll rip it apart
You've come undone
You're the weakest one
Death to your heart!
And I'll rip it apart (Rip it apart!)
You've come undone
You're the weakest one (The weakest one!)

Infected with deception
Destruction is my obsession
I'll feed off your sweet suffering
Your confession is my sweet crime
You've filled me up with your lies
Thought I knew you deep inside
So when I take this razor to your neck
I'll cut out all your fucking regrets!
I've got no room in this heart
Gonna tear you apart
You might also like
Death to your heart!
And I'll rip it apart
You've come undone
You're the weakest one
Death to your heart!
And I'll rip it apart (Rip it apart!)
You've come undone
You're the weakest one (The weakest one!)

I'm tearing apart what is left
Your blood I wanna taste
Here I am, in the flesh
Look your killer in the face
Hahaha, hehehe
What a pretty little sight
Now you're gone, it's too late
We will never be the same...
(Uh uh uh uh uh
Uh uh uh uh uh
Uh uh uh uh uh
Uh uh uh uh uh)
Death
To your little
Precious heart
This is the scene where you depart
No one will hear your final words
I'm a life-taker
I'm a heartbreaker...
Death to your heart!
And I'll rip it apart
You've come undone
You're the weakest one
Death to your heart!
And I'll rip it apart (Rip it apart!)
You've come undone
You're the weakest one (The weakest one!)
