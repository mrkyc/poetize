I've got a trick
It's not outlandish
Get on your knees
My dick will vanish
They rate me, I'm Vanity
For vandalizing your face, eat my candy

I'll push your head further down
My neck might make a snapping sound
Make sure you swallow it all down
Won't choke, won't gag, but I might drown
(We are rated X for explicit sex)

I just wanna see you beg for life
Choke you out, bruise your throat
Fuck you with my knife
At the same time, make you airtight
Lick the blade clean, stab you in the face
Fuck you with my eyes, call it skulling
Rated fucking Jayy for Von damn violence
Sexually explicit motherfuckers, and we won't hide it
I'm not tryin' to please anyone but me
So shut the fuck up, swallow my kids
Or I won't have mercy
You might also like
The sweetest drips from your lips
I'm excited for
For your best

I'll push your head further down
My neck might make a snapping sound
Make sure you swallow it all down
Won't choke, won't gag, but I might drown
Suck my dick and be proud
I'll wear your cum as my crown
Put your ass up and your face down
Don't you wanna fuck me all around

Turn into Darth Vader
Beat your face in with my lightsaber
I got the flavor to savor
My gravy's what you been craving
My dick be waiting
Your girlfriend on my bed (she naked!)
With a dick in her mouth
And my hand going south
Tell her boyfriend: "Call back later, hater!"
So sick, I might, at the end of of the night
Kill you, your kids, and your wife
Mister Anthony, horny?
Is that too soon? Nah, I'll just go
Some say it's too far, and I'm like: "Fuck ya'll!"
FCC can suck my dick for labeling this explicit shit
But I got my hands up wavin', sayin':
"HAH! Come and get me, bitch!"

I'm a sex offender!
Give up and surrender!
Middle fingers to all you pretenders, bitches!

I'll push your head further down
My neck might make a snapping sound
Make sure you swallow it all down
Won't choke, won't gag, but I might drown
Suck my dick and be proud
I'll wear your cum as my crown
Put your ass up and your face down
Don't you wanna fuck me all around
