Keep talkin' shit
I'll give you fat lip
Take a chainsaw
Rip you down raw
Get me pissed
Don't fuck with this!
I love it when I'm dangerous
Coming like a freight train
Painting walls with your brains...
You testify
I'll justify
You testify
I'll justify
So much to take
Before, I start to break
Rattle my cage
Stir up my rage
Try and trip
With a dis
Your ignorance
Is my sweet bliss
Seal it with a lovely kiss
Serve me like a fucking dish!

With our eyes wide open
Our fists closed shut
Push us to our limit
And we will have to fuck you up!
You might also like
So rip it up
Tear it down
Smash it up
Burn it down
We've lost control
Of our souls
Well oh
Oh no
Forget the risk
Take the fall
If that's what you want
It's worth it all
They can push you to the edge
But it's worth it in the end
Numb the pain
Let it go
Brace yourself
Lose control

I'll do what I want
And I mean what I say
You've said your peace
Now stay the fuck away
I love my life the way it is
And now you're gone
It's none of your business
Hate if you will
It's all good
You think you're king
Without shit to prove
You won't corner me
Can't destroy me
Cage me
Contain me
And I'll still break free
Irony and reality
Lets face the facts
I've had enough
Without fighting back
Monopolize your world
To hate the unknown
You can't justify
And I won't conform
You think you have it all
But not my soul
I'm taking a stand
Lose control
Minds blank with emotions
A social disease
Your hate produced
A whole other breed
With our eyes wide open
Our fists closed shut
Push us to our limit
And we will have to fuck you up!

So rip it up
Tear it down
Smash it up
Burn it down
We've lost control
Of our souls
Well oh
Oh no
Forget the risk
Take the fall
If that's what you want
It's worth it all
They can push you to the edge
But it's worth it in the end
Numb the pain
Let it go
Brace yourself
Lose control
Burn it down
Burn it down
Burn it down
Burn it down!

There's a trigger that goes off
A feeling that just snaps
When you're pushed to a corner
And you gotta fight back!
Find your inner fucking strength
Motivated by their hate!
Pull it out
When in doubt
And just not give a fuck!
'Till you break them and they fall
See their pity as you crawl!
'Cause you're tired and you're weak
From those nights of restless sleep!
When you feel like giving up!
When you feel like throwing up!
When you've had it up to here!
When you wanna disappear!
What?!

Keep talkin' shit
I'll give you fat lip
Take a chainsaw
Rip you down raw
Take a chainsaw
Rip you down raw
Take a chain saw
And rip you down raw!

So rip it up
Tear it down
Smash it up
Burn it down
We've lost control
Of our souls
Well oh
Oh no
Forget the risk
Take the fall
If that's what you want
It's worth it all
They can push you to the edge
But it's worth it in the end
Numb the pain
Let it go
Brace yourself
Lose control

Don't hold back
Let it go
Rise against
Lose control
Numb the pain
Let it flow
Brace yourself
