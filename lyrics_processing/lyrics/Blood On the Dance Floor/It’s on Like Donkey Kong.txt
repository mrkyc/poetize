Go, go ape shit, go ape shit
Go, go ape shit, go ape shit
Go, go ape shit, go ape shit
Well, I'm about to let it go down

Hopped up like Dennis Hopper on speed
I'mma smoke your ass like
Cheech and Chong smokes weed
My cum's so chunky
It's like an Oreo McFlurry
I'm gonna fuck your face
Til your eyes get blurry
Fuck the poker, I'll be poking you right up
Now you're choking
Bitches love my cock
Like Slash loves rock
I'm your fuck, get up on your bare back
When they find you
They're gonna find you on the ceiling
Bashed up, gashed up, you ain't got no feeling
Stick 'em in a wheelchair
I'm your favorite nightmare
I'm gonna die hard like Bruce fucking Willis
I am not sick
I'm just simply the illest of all

It's on like Donkey Kong
O-o-on like Donkey Kong
It's on like Donkey Kong
O-o-on like Donkey Kong
Bitch, I don't know
If you can handle this shlong
Go, go long
I'm hung like King Kong

Chopping through the butcher shop
Racking the meat
You'll climax so high the altitude'll
Make your ears bleed
Getting fucked from behind
His head on the pelvis
I'm down for deep anal, bitch
I'm not about the cervix, oh!
Blonde Barbie Ken
Fuck that Hollister shit
I'm more queer than Clay Aiken
With Aberzombie and bitch
And when you come back yelping (what)
For a second helping
You'll be screaming "Jayy Von!"
While I'm motherfucking felching
Neck, back, sack
Then onto the scrotum
Got more fucking crack
Than the hoods in Harlem
Spray me, don't date me;
Use your mouth, not your hand
I'd swallow your cum like vodka
If my name was Lindsay Lohan (Haha)
There's a way, there's a train, ride it on me
I'll be your railroad baby
Just give me your seat
This fagot just fucked your girl
She got rid of her pussy
Sewed her snatch, got a dick
Just so she could fuck me
It's on like Donkey Kong
O-o-on like Donkey Kong
It's on like Donkey Kong
O-o-on like Donkey Kong
Bitch, I don't know
If you can handle this shlong
Go, go long
I'm hung like King Kong

I'm slamming bitches
Like Kong slams a barrel
Fuck more wenches
Like I'm Captain Jack Sparrow
Cock so good I had
To put it in a song
It's wrong, wrong, wrong
Like Gaga's got a ding dong

Slammin' them like barrels
Go, go ape shit, go ape shit
Go, go ape shit, go ape shit
Go ape shit
It's on like Donkey Kong
O-o-on like Donkey Kong
It's on like Donkey Kong
O-o-on like Donkey Kong
Bitch, I don't know
If you can handle this shlong
Go, go long
I'm hung like King Kong

I'm slamming bitches
Like Kong slams a barrel
Fuck more wenches
Like I'm Captain Jack Sparrow
Cock so good I had
To put it in a song
It's wrong, wrong, wrong
