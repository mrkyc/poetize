Now I've got you where I want
Lots of love
I will haunt
Now I've got you where I want

Baby burn, burn, burn
With my sexual desire
Turning up the heat
'Til' we fucking in the fire
Ripe like an apple
If my body is the temple
I'll seduce you with my chapel
Make it violent like a battle
Oh my fuck
Dripping with my sin
Take a bite snow white
And let the sorcery begin

I'm a trail blazer!
I'm a hell raiser! (Hey!)
I'm a freak of nature
Maleficent behavior
It is just the apple
It is just for you
You might also like
I'll wrap myself around you
Constricting as I sink deep into you
Take a bite of my apple
Let me poison you
Which one of these sins
Do you choose?
You were after me
Like a moth to the flame
When you should have never ever
Loved a snake

I'm the poison apple!
Your final death row! (Hey!)
Sucking out your canal!
The light becomes a rebel!
Your violent dreams
Will come true

If you want it
Come and get
This is the moment
Of your life
And you hate it
You try to fight it
But you're giving in tonight
If you want it
Come and get
This is the moment
Of your life
And you hate it
You try to fight it
But you're giving in tonight
Now I've got you where I want
Lots of love
I will haunt
Now I've got you where I want
I'm a trail blazer!
I'm a hell raiser! (Hey!)
I'm a freak of nature
Maleficent behavior
It is just the apple
It is just for you

I'm the poison apple!
Your final death row! (Hey!)
Sucking out your canal!
The light becomes a rebel!
Your violent dreams
Will come true
