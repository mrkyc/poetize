P. L. U. R
Peace, love, unity, respect
These are all the things that I will never forget

No hate, just party and play
Let the lights hypnotize my brain
Just dance like it's my last chance to be alive
Tonight's the night

I don't have to fight for my right
'Cause everybody knows I live for the rave
But I do need a longer string for my kite
'Cause everybody knows I'm high all day
I'm high on life 'cause this is what I breath
Party, party, party, everyday, all week
P.L.U.R's what I stand for out on the floor
No one can judge me

Don't judge me, just love me
I'm not a criminal, I'm innocent
So come and set me free
I choose ecstasy and musics my religion
Magic is my kingdom and the dancefloor is my heaven
I get P.L.U.R (Woo-hoo!)
I get P.L.U.R (Woo-hoo!)
I get P.L.U.R
You might also like
Start to lose all control
Of my mind, body and soul
Feel the vibe like it's my last chance to be alive
Tonight's the night

I don't have to fight for my right
'Cause everybody knows I live for the rave
But I do need a longer string for my kite
'Cause everybody knows I'm high all day
I'm high on life 'cause this is what I breath
Party, party, party, everyday, all week
P.L.U.R's what I stand for out on the floor
No one can judge me

Don't judge me, just love me
I'm not a criminal, I'm innocent
So come and set me free
I choose ecstasy and musics my religion
Magic is my kingdom and the dancefloor is my heaven
I get P.L.U.R (Woo-hoo!)
I get P.L.U.R (Woo-hoo!)
I get P.L.U.R
(Peace, love, unity, respect
These are all the things that I will never forget)
I get P.L.U.R
Music my drug
There's love in the club

I don't have to fight for my right
'Cause everybody knows I live for the rave
But I do need a longer string for my kite
'Cause everybody knows I'm high all day
I'm high on life 'cause this is what I breath
Party, party, party, everyday, all week
P.L.U.R's what I stand for out on the floor
No one can judge me

Don't judge me, just love me
I'm not a criminal, I'm innocent
So come and set me free
I choose ecstasy and musics my religion
Magic is my kingdom and the dancefloor is my heaven
I get P.L.U.R (Woo-hoo!)
I get P.L.U.R (Woo-hoo!)
