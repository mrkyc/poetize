I feel like you see right through me
And never ever really knew me
Don't wanna be around
When you start to fall
I've got to follow all of my dreams
Got to figure out what this life means
Don't wanna to be around
When you fall

They say that life's an open book
Turn the page and take another look

You can't judge me
By my cover
It's not what you see
But what you discover
Can't push me down
It'll come around
Everything that you put me through
I-I-I-I-I
Don't want to be like you

I may be different but I'm beautiful
Every diamond's individual
Everyone
Shines in their own way
Kaleidoscopes have many different colors
I'll never be just like all the others
Gotta open your mind
I'll prove you wrong
You might also like
They say that life's an open book
Turn the page and take another look

You can't judge me
By my cover
It's not what you see
But what you discover
Can't push me down
It'll come around
Everything that you put me through
I-I-I-I-I
Don't want to be like you

They say the grass is greener
On the other side
But from where I'm standing
It looks just fine
I'll always be an outcast
I'll never get in line
You keep on living your life
And I'll live mine
(You can't judge me
By my cover)
You can't judge me
By my cover
It's not what you see
But what you discover
Can't push me down
It'll come around
Everything that you put me through
I-I-I-I-I
Don't want to be like you
You can't judge me
By my cover
It's not what you see
But what you discover (don't want to be like you)
Can't push me down
It'll come around
Everything that you put me through
I-I-I-I-I
Don't want to be like you
Don't want to be like you
