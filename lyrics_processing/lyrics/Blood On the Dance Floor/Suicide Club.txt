Welcome to Suicide Club
One, two, one two, three, four

Love is a drug
In the suicide club
Rough and it's tough
But I never get enough
Well dyin' is the latest fashion
Well dyin' is the main attraction
As I grow stronger
My voice gets louder
As your shit gets weaker
As I stomp you with my sneakers
I'm already dead inside
Let my words eat you alive!

On and on
And on and on
We can't go on
We can't go on like this
On and on
And on and on
We can't go on
We can't go on like this
On and on
And on and on
We can't go on
We can't go on like this
On and on
And on and on
We can't go on
We can't go on like this
You might also like
Tease as you breathe
Get you down on your knees
Reverse this curse
You naughty nurse
WTF it spells your death
K thanks bye
I hope you die!
As we grow stronger
Our voices get louder
As there shit gets weaker
We will stomp them with our sneakers
We're already dead inside
Let our words eat you alive!

On and on
And on and on
We can't go on
We can't go on like this
On and on
And on and on
We can't go on
We can't go on like this
On and on
And on and on
We can't go on
We can't go on like this
On and on
And on and on
We can't go on
We can't go on like this
Harder! Harder! Harder!
On my bed
Harder! Harder! Harder!
I can't forget
Harder! Harder! Harder!
On my bed
Harder! Harder! Harder!
Just drop dead!

On and on
And on and on
We can't go on
We can't go on like this
On and on
And on and on
We can't go on
We can't go on like this (Just drop dead!)
On and on
And on and on
We can't go on
We can't go on like this (Just drop dead!)
On and on
And on and on
We can't go on
