Stop, drop, mosh and roll
Everybody lose control
Shake it up, up and down
We're gonna burn up this town
We're at the party at the disco
And this is how the beat goes
Beating hotter than an inferno

My fashion is fresh to death
I'll hit you harder than meth
I'll leave you gasping for breath
You know I'm rocking the best
My fashion is fresh to death
I'll hit you harder than meth
I'll leave you gasping for breath
You know I'm rocking the best

I can't get, get, get, get enough
I can't get, get, get, get enough
The fame! The game! It's all the same!
I can't, I won't, let go! Oh no!

"I just heart your couture
It's so hot for sure
It leaves me begging for more
So get me down on the floor!"
Oh girl your talk is so hot
Let me show you what I got
So just sit back and relax
I'll get you down on the spot
You might also like
My fashion is fresh to death
I'll hit you harder than meth
I'll leave you gasping for breath
You know I'm rocking the best
My fashion is fresh to death
I'll hit you harder than meth
I'll leave you gasping for breath
You know I'm rocking the best

I can't get, get, get, get enough
I can't get, get, get, get enough
The fame! The game! It's all the same!
I can't, I won't, let go! Oh no!
