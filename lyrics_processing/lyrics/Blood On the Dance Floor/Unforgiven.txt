You've got your secrets locked inside
You've got them hidden so well
I'm gonna break down all your walls
And find out what you won't tell
I know you think you coined the slogan
Of the massive disguise
Let's go right through into the bullshit
I see all of your lies

I draw my guard
You played your cards
You dug a hole in my skin
You cut me deep
Then watched me bleed
While you claim you're innocent
Facing your lies, your filthy lies
The truth is here
On your face
So keep in mind
That I'm not blind
My memories can't be erased!

Took your love
And wasted all of it
On someone
Who could care
Less for you
I kept my word
Everything I said
Came
Directly from my heart, it's true
Don't think I won't forget
The things you've done
Don't think you won't regret
Forbidden fun
I've drawn my love with you
In the sand
Right now you are the one
Who's unforgiven
Unforgiven!
Unforgiven!
You might also like
You walked me to
The gates of heaven
Now I'm burning in hell
Took something pure and true
And turned it into something to sell
How can you live with yourself
Each time you think about what you've done?
This is about the game you played
Not the game that you won

You think you're slick
But here's the trick
I'll always know more
Than you know
You've choose your fate
Whose masquerade
Is done when you walk
Out the door
Don't justify
Your bullshit lies
It's so obvious that you're fake
Who's fooling who?
I know the truth
This drama is more
Than I can take
Took your love
And wasted all of it
On someone
Who could care
Less for you
I kept my word
Everything I said
Came
Directly from my heart, it's true
Don't think I won't forget
The things you've done
Don't think you won't regret
Forbidden fun
I've drawn my love with you
In the sand
Right now you are the one
Who's unforgiven

You had your fun
With all that was forbidden
You are the one
Who is unforgiven
Go!
Took your love
And wasted all of it
On someone
Who could care
Less for you
I kept my word
Everything I said
Came
Directly from my heart, it's true
Let go
Just let go
You'll be fine
On your own
Let go
Just let go
You'll be fine
On your own
Unforgiven!
