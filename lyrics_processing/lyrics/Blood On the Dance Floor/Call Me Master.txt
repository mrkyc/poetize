Tonight
Our bodies getting intertwined
It's fucking filthy feeding
Off the blood inside
Dried out veins
And no more pain
Let me know the place
And I'll take you away
Tonight
We're not gonna hold back
Make way for the freaks
Giving everybody heart attacks
What you need
Is just a little discipline
And I got a heavy dose
Of the right medicine

I'm dominant
By definition
I'm turned on by
Your submission
The dark side is how
We've been living
Let me show you
What you've been missing
You might also like
You, you, you are
You are my slave (You are my slave)
My little fucking disaster (Disaster)
I, I, I am
I am your god (I am your god)
Call me
Call me
Call me your master

Tonight
We're a living dead
Lure you to my bed
The happy ending is
Your flesh
Under my nails
No more fears
And no more tears
You are
My murder doll
And this is love at first bite
Bind you in a rope tight
What you need
Is just a little discipline
I got a heavy dose
Of the right medicine
The dark side is how
We've been livin'
Let me show you what
You've been missin'

You, you, you are
You are my slave (You are my slave)
My little fucking disaster (Disaster)
I, I, I am
I am your god (I am your god)
Call me
Call me
Call me your master

Dominant by definition
So turned on by your submission
Master of this fucking game
I'll make you wanna scream my name
Take it off girl
Strip it with no shame
I'm a thirsty animal
That cannot be tamed
Latex, chains and whips
Make me hard and excite me
Come on, throw your hands up
And pretend you wanna fight me
