I see those hips rollin'
Like the rims on a Bugatti
Sweat dripping from her lips
To her tits onto her body
And I heard she has a man
She still wants to get naughty
She told me I was her type
And I told that bitch to call me
I don't want to hit and quit it
But I'd like if you spit and sit it
Maybe lean back
Watch you rock that ass
Maybe let a real man hit it
Watch her ride that pole
With no plans of helping to stop it
I see the look in her eyes
I can see that she wants it

X times 3
We're getting undressed
Bodies against me
And it's getting wet
X times 3
Just move with me
I don't want your love
Just your body
Can you feel it
On the edge of your seat
Can you feel it
Just lose yourself to the beat
You might also like
I wanna see your hands
I wanna see you dance
Put your hands on me
Come dance with me
Now drop that ass
And drop that beat
Now what I gotta do
To get you home with me
I don't care, boy or girl
Just want you in my mouth please sir
Hello Mr. Right now
I'm holdin' it down like
If dancing is the movement
Then I am the creator
I shake my ass
I bring it back
I don't fuck with the haters
And if you leave me satisfied
I'll add you to the list
If you talk shit
I'll make your lips
Deep throat my fist

Can you feel it
On the edge of your seat
Can you feel it
Just lose yourself to the beat
Can you feel it
On the edge of your seat
Can you feel it
X times 3
We're getting undressed
Bodies against me
And it's getting wet
X times 3
Just move with me
I don't want your love
Just your body
Can you feel it
On the edge of your seat
Can you feel it
Just lose yourself to the beat

Do you wanna play with me
I will show you ecstasy
Do you wanna play with me
I will be your
Anybody

X times 3
We're getting undressed
Bodies against me
And it's getting wet
X times 3
Just move with me
I don't want your love
Just your body
Can you feel it
On the edge of your seat
Can you feel it
Just lose yourself to the beat
Can you feel it
On the edge of your seat
Can you feel it
Just lose yourself to the beat
Ain't no bang like our bass
Cause you know we're gonna rock
Ain't no hype like our party
Cause our party never stops
Ain't no bang like our bass
Cause you know we're gonna rock
Ain't no hype like our party
