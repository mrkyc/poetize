Ladies and gentlemen
Whores and sluts...
Step right up
Behind this curtain
Is where all your fantasies come to life
This is a place where you can escape
Welcome to
CandyLand!

Let me show you my game
I put those shoes to shame
These rhymes that I write
Make you wanna fuck all night
When we take off our clothes
She sucks me 'til it snows!
I'll fuck her face so hard
She is my wild card... (Haha, sweet!)
My sticky lollipop
Inside your sweet gumdrop!
I'm 'bout to explode!
It feels too good to stop!
Just taste my tootsie roll
You melt my icicle..
I gotta get my fix
Please, lick my pixie stick!

Welcome to Candyland!
I'll split your ass in two
So take me by my hand
Lick it up
Slide it down
And satisfy my sweet tooth!
Welcome to Candyland!
You'll wanna fuck me twice
I'll be your gingerbread man..
1st time naughty
2nd time nice!

Candyland
Candyland

Just close your eyes and dream
A fantasy so obscene...
I'll take you by the hand
This is my Candyland
You are my sweet playground
Swallow my love
'Til you drown...
I'll be your back door man
Welcome to my Candyland!
Welcome to Candyland!
I'll split your ass in two
So take me by my hand
Lick it up
Slide it down
And satisfy my sweet tooth!
Welcome to Candyland!
You'll wanna fuck me twice
I'll be your gingerbread man..
1st time naughty
2nd time nice!

You want my cock
But it's mine
So take a number
And get in line
Whipped cream
And astroglide;
Take off my wrapper
And slip and slide...
Sticky like a lollie
Blow me 'til I pop...
You can sample all my flavors at my
Candyshop
Cumshots
And gumdrops
Double fists and blow pops
Trick or treat
Squeeze my meat
Give me something sweet to eat!
Slip n' slide
On my face
You got that flavor
I want a taste!
Lick it red hot
Like a candy cane
You'd think I was a zombie
By the way I gave you brain...
