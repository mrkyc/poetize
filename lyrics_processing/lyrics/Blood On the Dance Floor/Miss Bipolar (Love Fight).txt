It's a love
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

You're a bitch, you're a bitch
I'm sick of your shit
You're a dick, you're a dick
Think your words are so slick
We can't get get it right
Always gotta be a fight
Your heart is my pinata
So sayonara

I just wanna go out tonight
I'm too tired to put up a fight
I just wanna go out tonight
I'm too tired to put up a fight
The best part of fighting
Is the make up sex

You might also like
You left my heart
Broken and sore
You say you love me (I love you)
Then you shove me to the floor
You'll be drowning in your make up
Contemplating our break up (What?)
Drama is your middle name
You're certifiably insane (Huh?)

I just wanna go out tonight
I'm too tired to put up a fight
I just wanna go out tonight
I'm too tired to put up a fight
The best part of fighting
Is the make up sex
