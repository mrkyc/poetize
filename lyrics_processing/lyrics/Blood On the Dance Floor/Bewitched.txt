You're attractive, you little witch, you're beautiful (Beautiful)
Your wickedness', little witch, it broke my heart (I broke your heart)
Enchanting words, you little witch, you cast a spell (I cast my spell)
Mass destroyer, little witch, my beautiful apocalypse

You've got me bewitched 'cause I'm under your spell
Woah-oh-oh
You must be a witch 'cause I am living in hell
Woah-oh-oh
Now is the time, now is the hour
I am the magic, I am the power, oh
All I need is one star in the sky
Wish for you every night

I tricked you to fall in love, little boy
I played with you 'til I was done like a toy (Like a toy)
Your heart in love as I destroy the end of you (The end of me)
So easily fooled, little boy to think it's true (I'm in love with you)

You've got me bewitched 'cause I'm under your spell
Woah-oh-oh
You must be a witch 'cause I am living in hell
Woah-oh-oh
Now is the time, now is the hour
I am the magic, I am the power, oh
All I need is one star in the sky
Wish for you every night
You might also like
Now is the time, now is the hour
To take back my heart, to take back my power
This is the moment to break your spell
I see right through you, now burn in hell
Now is the time, now is the hour
To take back my heart, to take back my power
This is the moment to break your spell
I see right through you, now burn in hell
Now is the time, now is the hour
To take back my heart, to take back my power
This is the moment to break your spell
I see right through you... (Burn in hell, witch)

You've got me bewitched 'cause I'm under your spell
Woah-oh-oh
You must be a witch 'cause I am living in hell
Woah-oh-oh
Now is the time, now is the hour
I am the magic, I am the power, oh
All I need is one star in the sky
