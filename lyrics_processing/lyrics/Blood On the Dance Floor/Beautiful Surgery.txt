Hollywood
Is a place where they'll pay $1000
For a kiss
And 50 cents
For your soul

Take a knife, cut a slice
Of my beautiful plastic life
Take my shoes, see my view
I'm imperfect just like you
Cover up all my flaws
Work to fix all of my withdrawals
This is fame, this is pain
A life of luxury being fame
Break the mold, sell my soul
Plastic model to be whole
Pay the price, living vise
Be Hollywood and roll the dice
I can be your enemy, my armor is my vanity
Cut me up, stitch me up
Make me perfect in front of myself

Keep talking all your shit
Beautiful surgery erases all of it
You can't cut me down
I rip myself into pieces that make me sell
All these rumors and all this shit
I've paid a pretty price to erase all of it
You can't stop me now
I'll save myself from your self-inflicted hell
You might also like
The battle's in the mirror
Is only the beginning
The battle within myself
Seems never-ending
Slap me on the face
Tell me that I fake the truth
Cause plastic always breaks...
There's nothing ideal
About being real
There's so many flaws
To cover and conceal
Connect the dots, live my dreams
And move the hearts threw the seams
Don't hate me for being pretty
Hate yourself cause you're not me

Keep talking all your shit
Beautiful surgery erases all of it
You can't cut me down
I rip myself into pieces that make me sell
All these rumors and all this shit
I've paid a pretty price to erase all of it
You can't stop me now
I'll save myself from your self-inflicted hell
Break it down
Break it down
Break it down
10, 9, 8, 7, 6
5, 4, 3, 2, 1

1, 2
Paparazzi making a flash
Don't wanna bitch just kiss my ass
I'm better than you
I fucked your mom
I'll take your grandmother to the fucking prom
My face is like music
My hair is like porn
Put 'em together it's like a perfect storm
I'll chew you up, I'll spit you out
Show you what this game's about
The sex and the glitter
The punk and the glam
Fuck you bitch, it's who I am
Surgery's not a fashion crime
Get your ass in the back of the line
With blacked-out eyes and hair extensions
All tattooed with lip injections
Razor-sharp, cutting edge
But I'd rather cut your face instead
Keep talking all your shit
Beautiful surgery erases all of it
You can't cut me down
I rip myself into pieces that make me sell
All these rumors and all this shit
I've paid a pretty price to erase all of it
You can't stop me now
I'll save myself from your self-inflicted hell

Keep talking all your shit
Beautiful surgery erases all of it
You can't cut me down
I rip myself into pieces that make me sell
All these rumors and all this shit
I've paid a pretty price to erase all of it
You can't stop me now
