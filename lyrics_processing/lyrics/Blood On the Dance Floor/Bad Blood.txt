You just talk your shit!
You just talk your shit!
You just talk your shit!
Now you sit back
And hate on me
You talk your shit
Yeah, you talk your shit
Yeah, you talk your shit
When you turned
Your back on me

Fuck you!
For everything you put me through
Fuck you!
For leaving me when I was there for you
Fuck you!
You destroyed something that was pure
Fuck you!
You took away my only fucking cure

You were my friend
And now you're my enemy
You were my blood
But now you're just a tragedy
Backstabber
But you won't get the best of me
Your web of lies
Will eventually be your
You might also like
Demise!
Demise!
Demise!
Only in a matter of time
Demise!
Demise!
Demise!
Your web of lies will be

Your demise
I'm all out of fucks
Could really care less
And so I need you
Like a fucking
Hole in the head
I'm out of fucks
No given damn
I only got one finger
For you
On this hand
Hate me!
Because I always demand the truth
Hate me!
Because I gave well deserved abuse
Hate me!
For exposing who you really are
Hate me!
For tearing us a-fucking-part!
You were my friend
And now you're my enemy
You were my blood
But now you're just a tragedy
Backstabber
But you won't get the best of me
Your web of lies
Will eventually be your

Demise!
Demise!
Demise!
Only in a matter of time
Demise!
Demise!
Demise!
Your web of lies will be
Your demise

How dare you call yourself a fan
Claim to be
S.G.T.C
But you were faking it
You were never it
Like a deception
You went wrong
A hating bitch in disguise
Fuck you motherfucker
I hope you fucking die
Eat shit
Or the pain that you brought upon me
Eat shit
For trying to fuck up my memory
Eat shit
For not being who you said you would be
Eat shit
For being the bitch of the century

You were my friend!
Now my enemy!
You were my blood!
Now a tragedy!
You were my life
Blinded by jealousy
You were my love
