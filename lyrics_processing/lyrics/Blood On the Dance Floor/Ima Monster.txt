Ten, nine, eight, seven, six
Five, four, three, two, one
Let's go!
Oh no!

Can't stop the tickles
They call me Dr. Giggles
It's o-o-o-off the chizzle
Fo' shizzle dizzle
I'm bangin' with the b-o-t-o-dizzle
With wiffles
'Cause I dribble like I'm rubbing on nipples
Gotta get out the pickle
Make it rain with the ripples
Let my, candy rum trickle
Get you buzzed with double triples
Getting head, in rentals
Avoiding the parentals
This is ghetto, plain and simple
With the down beat tempo
Oh, no!
They be hatin' us
'Cause we're glamorous
They be hatin' us
'Cause I'm fabulous
Can't stop me once I've started
Baby, got me retarded
Don't phunk-phunk-phunk-phunnnk
With my heart
Let's go!

Go 'head girl, shake that butt
Make me freakin' bust a nut!
Crank that music, bust it up
Let's get wasted, super uh!
Guess what, honey. I'm a freak
I'm a freak inside the sheets
Rough, tough, naughty nurse
Rip it up, now make it hurt
Don't stop, get it, get it!
Last for hours, not for minutes
Open wide for my surprise
Scratch and blow for your grand prize
Smear it on your plastic face
Leave you with a sweeter taste
Super soaker on your chest
Let it drip down on your breasts
Let's go!
