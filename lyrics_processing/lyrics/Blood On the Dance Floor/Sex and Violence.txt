You're so submissive
I'll get you in position
I'm on a mission
Hot sex in the kitchen
Now that's just bitchin'
I know cute lookin'
Start your invasion
Ultra sex sensation
Deep throat me girl
And rule my world
Be my scene queen
And live the American Dream
There's Blood On The Dance Floor
It's 1984
We're rocking kangaroos
And sippin' on Mountain Dew

It's just the way we fuck
It's the way we cut
Sex and violence!
Ultraviolet
Doctor, doctor
Be my lover
Take this knife
And end my life
It's the way we fuck
It's the way we cut
Sex and violence!
Ultraviolet
Oh doctor, doctor
Be my lover
Take this knife
And end my life
You might also like
Fuck me, rape me
Take me, blow me
Fuck me, rape me
Take me, blow me
Fuck me, rape me
Take me, blow me
Fuck me, rape me
Take me, blow me

So fuck the pain away
Make it all okay
This life is plastic
I hide in sunglasses
I'll wear my mac
And give you my heart attack
I'll slice you, I'll dice you
Serve you up in drive through
You fucking carbon copy
Your style is so sloppy
So take it with ease
You'll never be me
My style is wild
Forever and ever
I'll leave you secered
Beggin' fot my pleasure
It's just the way we fuck
It's the way we cut
Sex and violence!
Ultraviolet
Doctor, doctor
Be my lover
Take this knife
And end my life
It's the way we fuck
It's the way we cut
Sex and violence!
Ultraviolet
Oh doctor, doctor

And end my life
It's just the way we fuck
It's the way we cut
Sex and violence!
