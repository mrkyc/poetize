Love it's like magic
Locked in mystery
You always being witch
You're a Halloween treat
I can never get enough
Your love is like a drug
Baby, you're my haunted house
My heart will stay forever now
Never ghost you, bitch, I mean without you (Boobies!)
L-O-V-E Y-O-U
Forever and ever, is what you mean to me
You're the key to my heart cause your love it set me free

Cause you do something that I just can't explain
Love it's like magic when it hits, to feel no pain

Love melts her heart like the middle of summer
The crawl was change from
She's sweet like popsicles
Love melts her heart like the middle of summer
The crawl was change from
She's sweets, she's sweet like popsicles

Her pussy taste like Skittles
The way my tongue jiggles
Hotter than hell, I sizzle

But honeys call me Triple
I'm gonna raise hell, you can hear the bacon sizzle

Triple little popsicle
Way she 'round my dick, yo, I swear it was a bicycle
She got the flame and the silver
Sweet and then I'm like shiver

Cause you do something that I just can't explain
Love it's like magic when it hits to feel numb pain

Love melts her heart like the middle of summer
