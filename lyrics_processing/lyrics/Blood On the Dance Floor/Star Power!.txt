Bunker Bustin' mega ultra super
Ahh ahhh!
Holy crap, ahh!
Oh my god!
Oh my god!
Oh my god!
K.O!

One-up, power up
Already leveled up
Options set to difficult
Love a challenge, typical
Raging through my enemies
Kicking ass so happily
Supernova, bend you over
To the lava, game over
I'm saying "YAY!"
When I'm knocking you right off the stage
Bitches hate but I don't play
Smash a Goomba anyday!
I'm on a mission
Trying to save the princess!
Dashing, smashing
Knock you outta commission!
I'm a killer like a Manson
You're blowin like you're Hanson
Your powers are weak
When you go against me
You better recognize
Leave you paralyzed!
Body in the woods
Leave you here to die
You will never find
Another one of our kind!
Like a machine;
Ultimate in design!
Super power, monster
Flowers to the sky!
Beyond!
Uh!
Course clear
Winning cheer!

Game over grandma!

Sorry, I ain't got time to play
I don't got the time to waste
I get the gold at every race
I live my life in the passing lane
Can you please hold
While I write my next album?
All my tracks are on the charts
Pull them up and let you count them
The number to my score
Keep on flowing like a fountain
I'm gonna kill you bitch
Like my name is Ed Gein!
And my health bar
Never leaves green
I'll burn through
Your lives like dry weed
I'm pretty fucking bright
Kinda how my chronic be!
I'm on the winning team
You can try but you'll never beat!
One on one
You'll all leave the screen
I'm going on
A killing spree!
At the top
We will be
Just Jayy Von
