Smelling blood, chopping hoes
I'm gonna bring it lock and load
Hello there, I'm Doctor Evil
Got more tricks than Evil Knievel
Shark attack, guess who's back?
It's Vanity, now lick my sack
Not afraid, not to change
I keep it real so rock the stage
I should come with a warning label
Piss me off, I become unstable
Steel cage, undertaker
Throw you down through 50 tables
Bang, bang, shot you down
Go Uma Thurma, up in this bitch
Revenge is best served cold
Taking it back, we'll be your wish
D-G-A-F
Learn to cause a fight bitch
Nam, bam, fam, damn
Knock you down 'till you can't stand
Damn, right I'm killing it
Damn, right you're feeling it
I'll split this floor, I'll let you know
That hater's motivate me
I admittedly
Will annihilate their idiocy
We shot ahead to see
I'm your momma's new facial cream
Na-Na-Na-Na, Bat-Man
I ain't afraid of you, man
My warning's are not a test
Eat bitches like you for breakfast
You might also like
Fuck the rest
We the best
Fuck the rest
For the win, I'm killing it
Ain't nobody stopping me
Fuck the rest
We the best
Fuck the rest
Undefeated, world's top
Ain't nobody stopping us

We're trying to be okay with what you didn't create
Don't copy my face and make stupid mistakes
Your only mark is gonna be on the side walk
Your body on the block outlined in white chalk
You better learn to crawl before you can walk
I'm coming at you fast, I'm just having a mock
See how far you get around the cell block
You think you're hardcore, It's just drawn on by the rock
Bloody nose, busted lips
Broken ribs, broken hips
Full sleeves and no tits
Bruised eyes and loose clits
Fuck the number, can't stand
Two dicks and one fist
Stuffed into the roof
Guess who? It's Jayy, bitch
Fuck the rest
We the best
Fuck the rest
For the win, I'm killing it
Ain't nobody stopping me
Fuck the rest
We the best
Fuck the rest
S-G-T-C
'Til the very death of me

Stick it to you with the middle finger
Beat your ass on Jerry Springer
What the fuck do you know about this?
What the fuck, can't handle my dick
I cut my self and bleed to death
Got your girlfriend on my dick and neck
Yes, yes on the bed
Real deal, hold and slam
Fuck you till you cannot feel
This is how we keep it real
I'm gonna Kanye, Taylor Swift your ass,
Smoke you like you're a bag of grass
I'm gonna p-p-poke your face
Leave you with my sweet little taste
I had to do the
Gaga-rama rama, Oh Oh lala
Fuck the rest
We the best
Fuck the rest
For the win, I'm killing it
Ain't nobody stopping me
Fuck the rest
We the best
Fuck the rest
S-G-T-C
'Til the very death of me
