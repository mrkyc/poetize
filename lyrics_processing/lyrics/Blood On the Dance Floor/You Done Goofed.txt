With everything
Going on in this world...
All the people with
Hate in their hearts
And minds..
And still the focal point
Is the lies about me
You've been blessed
By fucking with someone
Who doesn't give a fuck what you say..
But here's my message
Hear me out
I'm only saying this once...

I don't give a shit
About your insecurities
Your attempt to get my attention
Doesn't bother me
But you crossed that line
Dragged my name through the dirt
Believe me, girl
Gonna feel all my hurt!
I work hard
For the things
That are in my hands
Our fans are what I live for
It's my promised land...
You seem to think
That the scene you've made
Will somehow
Some way
'Cause me so much pain...
I don't think you understand
All your lies, shenanigans
Won't make me give a damn
It's all just a fucking scam
So I'll keep on livin'
And keep on givin'
We got one life to live
I won't be stopped
With your fibbing!
You might also like
Everything you said
It was a lie...
We watched as the world
Watched you cry...
Everything you did
Was for the fame...
What you have now
Is a world of pain...

Hate, rage, lies
I'm done with it
I've let you fill my head with this shit
All because I'm living my dreams
And never was taught to quit
I always swung back
I never took the first hit
All these accusations
And no truth to admit
I've changed how people think
I'm not the only misfit
Posting, blogging, hating
With no reason to submit
Regardless of what you've read
I've got no crime to commit!
Your fiction trash talking
It's done
Out of hate
I'm about to murder it all
I'm about to eradicate
Look at me
I'm beautiful
Not a suspect of rape!
Don't you know
I'm fucking boss?
Read the fucking nameplate!
You're just a pawn of stupidity
You're a living mistake
I'm the king of the chessboard
So motherfucker
Checkmate!
I am writing this for
Anyone who can relate
Who's ever been hurt
By the things that people say
I stand strong
I don't let anything get in my way
I'm not going anywhere
Maybe you'll see that one day
If I don't have anything
And I'm left with nothing
At least I still have my faith
That's all I need
To embrace...
Everything you said
It was a lie...
We watched as the world
Watched you cry...
Everything you did
Was for the fame...
What you have now
Is a world of pain...

I won't be your prey
Your wooden puppet on a string
You think you're clever
Bold-faced
Lies control
Everything...
You can call me fake
Call me sick
Call me a Nazi
I'll blow down your little house
And cripple your posse!
Your victim
I am not
I am a tiger
Don't mess with me
I got the love of my fans
And my family...
They're the reason I am
They always cover my back...
They'll annihilate your ass
When I'm under attack!
This darkness I feel
Won't turn into suicide
All your hate will push me
Right over to the golden side
And I'd love to think
That when you talk to your shrink
He points out you're the reason
That your life stinks
And if you're the cause for
All this motherfucking bullshit!
Regret meeting me
As your last dying wish...
My name and reputation
Won't be the target of a slut!
I'll be on top of the world
And you'll be cutting yourself fucked!

Everything you said
It was a lie...
We watched as the world
Watched you cry...
Everything you did
Was for the fame...
What you have now
Is a world of shame...

When you're standing in the rain
And it's getting dark...
It seems
Like the world is trying to bring you down...
Remember...
One love
One heart
