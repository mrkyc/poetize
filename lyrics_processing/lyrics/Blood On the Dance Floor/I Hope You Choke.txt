Blood should be my 'pologies
Smeared across your silver screen
Pain, bet your so obscene
Bleeding heartsy sympathy
But I can never breathe
The only thing I see's
A heart on empty
And it screams so deadly
Gaspin' for salvation
Cutting and frustration
Sex and complication
My minds on medication
What started of so magically
Love ends so tragically
Now wasted; ever shattered
Like nothing ever mattered

I hope you choke
I hope you know
The pain inside just multiplies
I lost my grip
I'm about to slit
Love is cruel, remember this
Protect yourself from the fighting fists
Covered wrists
So deep it fits
Its killing me, its tearing me
I can't forget, I can't regret
You might also like
This world is just so fucked up
My life is just so messed up!
Nothing makes sense in a world that is so dead
The bleeding in my heart are
From these stitches that are falling apart
You make me sick from this shit
How could you ever do this?
I gave you my heart
And you just ripped it apart
I tasted your blood
And you just wasted my love
You threw it away
It was so fragile and fray
Silver and gray
Like judgment day

I hope you choke
I hope you know
The pain inside just multiplies
I lost my grip
I'm about to slit
Love is cruel, remember this
Protect yourself from the fighting fists
Covered wrists
So deep it fits
Its killing me, its tearing me
I can't forget, I can't regret
This world is just so fucked up
My life is just so messed up
I hope you choke
I hope you know
The pain inside just multiplies
It's killing me
It's tearing me
I can't forget
I can't regret
I hope you choke
I hope you know
The pain inside just multiplies
It's killing me
It's tearing me
I can't forget
I can't regret
I hope you choke
I hope you know
The pain inside just multiplies
It's killing me
It's tearing me
I can't forget
I can't regret
I hope you choke
I hope you know
The pain inside just multiplies
It's killing me
It's tearing me
I can't forget
I can't regret
I hope you choke
I hope you choke
I hope you choke
I hope
