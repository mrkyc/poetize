Portrait of a family force-fed through tunnel straws
Singing cannibal hymns of the bourgeoisie
There's a narc on every corner, knock-knock-knock on every door
With a homemade remedy to loosen every tongue

How many bites do you think it takes to get to the cyanide tooth?
Brace yourself, my darling
Brace yourself, my love

Smuggled in their faith like an orbit in decay
Drools the cloying adulation of piss ants
One shot for every snitch leads the needle to the stitch
It's a homemade remedy to loosen every tongue

How many bites do you think it takes to get to the cyanide tooth?
Brace yourself, my darling
Brace yourself, my love
How many crimes will the owners fake to save pathological truths?
Brace yourself, my darling
Brace yourself, my love

That's the way the guillotine claps
She's the one who's governed by contagions

Life! Is not the answer
Cry! Will you assimilate love in the time of gilded crumbs?
Crawl! Until you weep with blood
Life! Is not the answer
Canaries in the coal mine dropping like flies

How many bites do you think it takes to get to the cyanide tooth?
Brace yourself, my darling
Brace your pole-axed love

That's the way the guillotine claps
She's the one who's governed by contagions
That's the way the guillotine claps
She's the one who's governed by contagions

Too many bodies shriveled up in their tributes
Too many bodies flayed with a grin
Brace yourself, my darling
Brace yourself for a flood
He's the man behind the dresser giving Zodiac advice
He says there will come a day to delete everything
Brace yourself, my darling
Brace yourself for a flood
There's a woman eating her newborn under a tractor's frame
She says, "Barren are the fields from the Nephilim rain"
Brace yourself, my darling
Brace yourself for a flood

That's the way the guillotine claps
He's the one who's governed by contagions
That's the way the guillotine claps
He's the one who's governed by contagions

Governed by contagions
