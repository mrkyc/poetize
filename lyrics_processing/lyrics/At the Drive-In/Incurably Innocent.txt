Pray that your family never forgets
The arousal from a corpse that fuels your taste
Blonde to the shoulders, blind to the pill
He found solace in the act of infection

A blank tape that couldn't remember
But you can never erase the hurt
Out in the dial toned distance someone heard

He keeps a-hiding your photograph
Of the moment that you needed to emasculate his
Photograph but you locked up in the trance of a memory
Photograph of the moment that you needed to emasculate his
Photograph but you locked up in the trance of a memory
Marching to the coffins on Franklin Avenue

Preyed on the anguish, you better run
Always dragging a finger across his throat
Man is the fixer to sage the ghosts
And the faith that awarded his every move

A blank tape that couldn't remember
But you can never erase the hurt
Out in the dial-tone distance someone heard
You might also like
He keeps a-hiding your photograph
Of the moment that you needed to emasculate his
Photograph, but you locked up in the trance of a memory
Photograph, of the moment that you needed to emasculate his
Photograph, but you locked up in the trance of a memory
Marching to the coffins on Franklin Avenue

Just float the needles when the rum fits a tremor at hand
And he can't seem to find his direction home
Just float the needles when the rum fits a tremor at hand
And he can't seem to find his direction home
In a closet she hid in eternity sleep
With the fear of God at the end of his whip

He keeps a-hiding your photograph
Of the moment that you needed to emasculate his
Photograph, but you locked up in the trance of a memory
Photograph, of the moment that you needed to emasculate his
Photograph, but you locked up in the trance of a memory
