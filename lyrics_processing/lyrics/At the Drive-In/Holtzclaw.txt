I got your city by the shortest crosshairs
I'll never take no, no for an answer, it's a bottomless cyst
And all you eagles dressed in parallax drag
You'll find between my teeth a dagger and a penalty
My teeth a dagger and a penalty of crows for blood
Nothing's going to stop us from twisting that cross in your heart

Church ain't over 'til they put the snakes back in the bag
Church ain't over 'til they put the snakes back in the bag
Church ain't over, over
'Til they put the snakes back, put the snakes back, back in the bag

I can't miss fast enough, fast enough to win
I'll never take no, no for an answer, it's a bottomless cyst
Comply through compression, I want to know your every move
We'll never take no, no for an answer
No, no forget it, it's Chinatown
Nothing's gonna stop us from twisting that cross in your heart

Church ain't over 'til they put the snakes back in the bag
Church ain't over 'til they put the snakes back in the bag
Church ain't over, over
'Til they put the snakes back, put the snakes back, back in the bag
You might also like
Haystack of needles trying to compromise
Turn the little splinters into black passports
The future is heathen and we want you to know your hope
Is a worthless currency
Throw them overboard, float the armory
Mitigate your faith with decadence
Merit to the torment you don't want to believe in hope
The worthless currency
All your symptoms, all your thoughts I will control
Nothing's going to stop us, nothing's going to stop us now
All your symptoms, all your thoughts I will control
Nothing's going to stop us, nothing's going to stop us now
Are you an asset or are you a problem?

Church ain't over 'til they put the snakes back in the bag
Church ain't over 'til they put the snakes back in the bag
Church ain't over, over
'Til they put the snakes back in the bag
Church ain't over, over
