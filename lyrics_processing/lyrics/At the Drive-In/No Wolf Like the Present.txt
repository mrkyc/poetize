In a safe house he baits, can you blame the conniving
Bludgeoned by the prowler cars
He's been running since the day that they tagged his skin
A walking cipher kicking calendars

He hears the sirens
He hears his song play everyday, yeah

From Potemkin mills, where the winds erase
They use our past to evict us
In a land that stole, a kestrel from the knave
Smothered inmates full at capacity

He hears the sirens
He hears his song play everyday
It's open season check the body cam

There's no wolf like the present
They own your history and scrap it for parts
There's no wolf like the present
Of insignificance
There's no wolf like the present
They own your history and scrap it for parts
There's no wolf like the present
Of insignificance

Tantivy run

He's been on the lam so long he knows the rules of the hunt
Carving X's into bullets for luck
While the veneer of civilization grinds
Light bulbs into his food supply

He hears the sirens
He hears his song play everyday
It's open season check the body cams

There's no wolf like the present
They own your history and scrap it for parts
There's no wolf like the present
Of insignificance
There's no wolf like the present
They own your history and scrap it for parts
There's no wolf like the present
Of insignificance

Tantivy run
Tantivy run
There's no wolf like the present
They own your history and scrap it for parts
There's no wolf like the present
Of insignificance
There's no wolf like the present
They own your history and scrap it for parts
There's no wolf like the present
Of insignificance

There's no wolf like the present
There's no wolf like the start
There's no wolf like the present
Of insignificance
