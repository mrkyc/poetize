They're spraying our block with chemtrail praise
And all the crisis actors want to man the hotlines
Talk you off the ledge, hermetically seal it
In accordance to the rules of harmony

One shot delivers us from what the heart don't want
But the heart is broken
One shot delivers us from what the heart don't want
But the heart is broken
One shot hits in the gut, she's a pendulum swinging for f-f-fences
She's just a lantern jaw plagiarizing ground assault

TV's gonna comm lag, jettison the populace
Disassociation in the belly of the beast
Break the fourth wall, break the fourth wall come on
Lobotomize the question of my infinitude
An ensemble of dissent, she's just tampering with alarms
But she's tampering with blatto
Finely tune their gestures, tampering with false alarms
Swinging for electric fences, electric fences
Come on and get me out

One shot delivers us from what the heart don't want
But the heart is broken
One shot delivers us from what the heart don't want
But the heart is broken
One shot hits in the gut, she's a pendulum swinging for f-f-fences
She's just a lantern jaw plagiarizing ground assault

The hand of God keeps me from watching
Feel it raining down and down
Triangulated at the crossing
I never knew what knocked me out
Facsimile shadows my last breath
Feel it raining it down and down
The hail of doubt will always stop you
On the night that they bowed out
One shot in the chamber
One shot in the chamber
The hand of God keeps us from watching
The hand that's always raining down and down and down

One shot delivers us from what the heart don't want
But the heart is broken
One shot delivers us from what the heart don't want
But the heart is broken
One shot hits in the gut, she's a pendulum swinging for f-f-fences
