It only happens here in London
It only happens in London
Where the freaks come alive
We are wreckless and wild
We're the kings of the night
It only happens here in London

They say London Bridge is falling
I say the UK ballin
The Arabs pulling them whips out
They love to go all in
Abramovich bought Chelsea
Russia put them chips up
The Pound is still the best currency
If you really trying to live it up
I just touch down in Heathrow
In that G6 fuck that G4
Ain't worry about no jet lag
I came to party with my people

It only happens here in London
It only happens in London
Where the freaks come alive
We are wreckless and wild
We're the kings of the night
It only happens here in London
We keep the fire burning red hot
And we never stop
Give it all you got
In this city we go until we drop
It only happens here in London
You might also like
That London Eye keeps spinning
Watching all the beautiful women
Them imports from Milan
European models still winning
At tea time I pop champagne
Wiling out like Soho
You can find me in the Hyde Park
One of those places I call home
I just shut down Harrods
Harry Winston for them carats
Shout out to my killers in Brixton
And to my niggas in Paris
Tonight is all we got
So let's take the fast lane
If we live let's see tomorrow
We can do it again
There's no place in the world
That I'd rather be than here with you

It only happens here in London
It only happens in London
Where the freaks come alive
We are wreckless and wild
We're the kings of the night
It only happens here in London
It only happens in London
Where the freaks come alive
We are wreckless and wild
We're the kings of the night
It only happens here in London
We keep the fire burning red hot
And we never stop
Give it all you got
In this city we go until we drop
