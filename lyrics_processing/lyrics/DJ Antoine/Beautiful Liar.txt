I might not be
Your Mr. Right, but girl hold on
There's a lot to learn from
Do you want the beautiful liar
The ugly truth let me know
Do you want the beautiful liar
The ugly truth let me know
Let me know
Let me know
Do you want the beautiful liar
The ugly truth let me know
Do you want the beautiful liar
The ugly truth let me know
Let me know
Go ahead and love me blind
Baby don't worry 'bout them at all
Everything will be alright
Cause none of your friends ever been in love
I would rather close my eyes
Than to see you do me wrong
I've lived a beautiful life
Knowin' that I always have you at home
Truth hurts and I don't like pain
I don't wanna see you cry
I just wanna see you smile, oh
Just do what works and I won't complain
You can live a fairy tale life
Baby, make up your mind
Let me know
Do you want the beautiful liar
The ugly truth let me know
Do you want the beautiful liar
The ugly truth let me know
I know you've heard a thousand times
That I wouldn't do it anymore
But at least I tried
And it won't hurt you if you don't know
If you forgive me I won't forget
I promise I won't do it again
Baby we shouldn't have to end
She was just a friend
Truth hurts and I don't like pain
I don't wanna see you cry
I just wanna see you smile
Yeah
Just do what works and I won't complain
You can live a fairy tale life
Baby, make up your mind
Do you want the beautiful liar
The ugly truth let me know
Do you want the beautiful liar
The ugly truth let me know
