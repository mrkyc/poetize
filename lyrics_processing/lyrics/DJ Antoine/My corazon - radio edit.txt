My heart beats like a drum
And you're my only desire
And the best is yet to come
And we will dance like there is no tomorrow
'Til the ocean is kissing the sun
And it's OK cause we got time to borrow
Yeah we've only just begun, oh oh
All I need is my baby
And I'll be alright
The love of my life
My corazon
You're forever my lady
You shine so bright
You light up my life
My corazon
My corazon
My corazon
The flames keep burning higher
Into the endless sky
And every time that I'm by ya
I see the heaven in your eyes, yeah!

It's just you and I
Livin' life before it flashes by
And we flying high
Tryin' to touch the sky
But tonight girl we gone
You just gotta call me up on my phone
And I'll be there in a minute
When you feelin' alone
You ain't gotta do that on your own, so
When you confrontin' your fears
I'll be there wiping your tears
If anybody talking about us
Get the guts to tell 'em shut up
Cause all I need is trust
And I will never be lost in lust
You gotta keep your faith
Cause I'm your soul mate
It will always be me and you
Cause you know that I'm stuck to you like glue
All I need is my baby
And I'll be alright
The love of my life
My corazon
You're forever my lady
You shine so bright
You light up my life
You're my corazon
