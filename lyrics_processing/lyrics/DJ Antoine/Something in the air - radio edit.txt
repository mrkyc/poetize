That makes me feel so high
There's something in the air, tonight
Oh I, I can't fight this feeling any more
There's something in the air, tonight
Air tonight
Bang, bang, give it a try
Spread your wings, let go and fly
Elevate your soul to the sound
Cause tonight it's going down
Can you feel the party heating up
I can feel the drums getting beatin' up
Can you see the dancefloor's on fire
Let Tome take you higher
She likes me, I like her
There's magic in the air
She told me to come closer
That we'd make the perfect pair
There's something in the air, tonight
That makes me feel so high
There's something in the air, tonight
Oh I, I can't fight this feeling any more
There's something in the air, tonight
Can't fight it any more
There's something in the air, tonight
Air tonight
Yeah, yeah, that's what it is
There's something in the air
It's contagious
The air is so thick
Jump like a pogo stick
It's a special affair
That's why I am up in this b*tch
Tic-toc we take it around the clock
Hate a player baby we won't stop
Keep it moving now we gon' do it now
We in a movie now we gon' get down
Drop down low, I'm feelin' high
Let's set this party off tonight
You know that we gon' live our life
There something going on tonight
There's something in the air, tonight
That makes me feel so high
There's something in the air, tonight
Oh I, I can't fight this feeling any more
There's something in the air tonight
Can't fight it any more
There's something in the air tonight
Air tonight
Something's in the air, tonight
There's something in the air, tonight
That makes me feel so high
There's something in the air, tonight
Oh I, I can't fight this feeling any more
There's something in the air tonight
Can't fight it any more
There's something in the air tonight
Oh oh oh oh
There's something in the air tonight
