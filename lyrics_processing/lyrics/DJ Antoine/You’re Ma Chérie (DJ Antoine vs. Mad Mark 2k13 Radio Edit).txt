I used to hang around withem boys
That took over towns and made the block blow up
Now I hang around withem boys
Who take over companies and make the stock blow up, huh
Haters, many
Women, plenty
But the world, that's ma cherie

We are gonna dance into the sea (DJ Antoine)
All I want is you you're ma cherie (Mr. Worldwide)
Never seen a girl that so Jolie (Live from Tokyo)
All I want is you, you're ma cherie
Ma cherie, oh-oh-oh-oh (Wooh)


First dealing drugs was the plan (Plan)
Now I'm a marquee brand
Doing business with marquee brands (Brands)
No more Section 8
Now it's private yachts, beaches, sands (Sands)
World tours with press and prestigious fans (Fans)
Just to meet and greet me, damn
Long way from the Miami I was raised in (Yah)
Long way from that foster home
Long way from that Georgia basement (Yah)
Long way from all the schools that I was placed in, huh
As long as you work hard and believe
That everything happens for a reason (Reason)
That's why the world is my cherie, believe it (Wooh)
