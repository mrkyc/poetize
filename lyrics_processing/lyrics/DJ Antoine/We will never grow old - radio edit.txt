Every single kiss felt like burning flames
Our love was wild like a hurricane
We used to run away and be gone for days
Hiding from the world in our secret place
We made a promise we would never change
That we would never grow old
We are the light, we are made of stars
We are the love in our beating hears
And we'll never, ever
We will never, ever
No we will never grow old
We are divine, we are beautiful
We are the life indestructible
We will never, ever
We will never, ever
We will never grow old
Remember swimming naked in the lake
Too much was not enough, took what we could take
We watched the world sleep as we stayed awake
We said we gonna run 'til the end of time
And we would write our names on the skyline
We never fade, we will always shine
And we will never grow old

We are the light, we are made of stars
We are the love in our beating hears
And we'll never, ever
We will never, ever
No we will never grow old
We are divine, we are beautiful
We are the life indestructible
We will never, ever
We will never, ever
We will never grow old
Oh oh oh oh...
We will never, ever
We will never, ever
We will never grow old
Remember when we danced in the summer rain
Our love forever wild like a hurricane
We made a promise, we would never change
Never change, never change
We would never grow old
We are the light, we are made of stars
We are the love in our beating hears
And we'll never, ever
We will never, ever
No we will never grow old
We are divine, we are beautiful
We are the life indestructible
We will never, ever
We will never, ever
No we will never grow old
Oh oh oh oh...
We will never, ever
