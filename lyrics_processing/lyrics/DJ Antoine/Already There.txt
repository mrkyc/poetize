Let's just put it in the past, make new memories
I've been reborn and I want to be back in your life
Cause with you gone it's like I've been stabbed with a knife
And I'll catch you when you fall
Back in love with me again
Even if I have to crawl
I'll get back on my feet again
Faster than the speed of light
It's like as if I'm floating through the air
You don't need to wait any longer
Cause I'm already there
You gave me wings so that I could fly
And your love has made my heart aware
And I can feel it getting stronger
'Cause I'm already there!
You've taken off all my armor, now my heart's exposed
You've got the key to unlock your love and let it go
I've got a one way ticket, there won't be no turning round
And I can't wait to get my two feet on the ground
And I'll catch you when you fall
Back in love with me again
Even if I have to crawl
I'll get back on my feet again
Faster than the speed of light
It's like as if I'm floating through the air
You don't need to wait any longer
'Cause I'm already there!
You gave me wings so that I could fly
And your love has made my heart aware
And I can feel it getting stronger
'Cause I'm already there!
You might also likeI'm already, already already there
I'm already, already already there
I'm already, already already there
I'm already, al- I'm already there
I'm already, already already there
I'm already, already already there
I'm already, already already there
I'm already there
Faster than the speed of light
It's like as if I'm floating through the air
You don't need to wait any longer
'Cause I'm already there!
You gave me wings so that I could fly
And your love has made my heart aware
And I can feel it getting stronger
'Cause I'm already there!
Faster than the speed of light
It's like as if I'm floating through the air
You don't need to wait any longer
'Cause I'm already there!
You gave me wings so that I could fly
And your love has made my heart aware
And I can feel it getting stronger
