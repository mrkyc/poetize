La vie en rose
La vie, la vie en rose
Your life is what you make it
So go ahead and take it
La vie en rose
La vie, la vie en rose
When better than tonight to celebrate
Woah-oh

When your eyes only see dark skies
When the storm cloud's overhead
The pain inside can make you feel like
The whole world is colorless

Woah-oh, but then rays of sunlight
Start to fill your heart again
And you begin to believe in life
Now all that you're seeing is

La vie en rose
La vie, la vie en rose
Your life is what you make it
So go ahead and take it
La vie en rose
La vie, la vie en rose
When better than tonight to celebrate
Woah-oh
You might also like
I throw away a million days
Just for one more time to baile with you
Feel the rhythm, set your body free
And put it upon me
I like the way you move because
Life is like an ocean
With emotion
You just gotta step out the shade
And let the light show you the way

Hold on tight, life is a wild ride
Full of ups and downs and bends
And it goes by in the blink of an eye
So let's all laugh, love and live
(Bailar!)

Woah-oh, and then rays of sunlight
Start to fill your heart again (again)
And you begin to believe in life
Now all that you're seeing is

La vie en rose
La vie, la vie en rose (hey! hey! hey! hey!)
Your life is what you make it
So go ahead and take it (oh)
La vie en rose (oh-oh-oh)
La vie, la vie en rose (la vie en rose)
When better than tonight to celebrate
(You've got to celebrate)
La vie en rose
La vie, la vie en rose
Your life is what you make it (hey! hey! hey! hey!)
So go ahead and take it
La vie en rose (la vie, la vie)
La vie, la vie en rose
When better than tonight to celebrate
Woah-oh
