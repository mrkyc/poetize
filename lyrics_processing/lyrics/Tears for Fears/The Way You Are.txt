Going far, getting nowhere
Going far the way you are
Going far, getting nowhere
Going far the way you are
Going far, getting nowhere
To tomorrow, to tomorrow
The way you are
To tomorrow, climb the ladder
Going far, getting nowhere
To tomorrow, to tomorrow
The way you are
To tomorrow, climb the ladder

These fingers aren't my fingers
These hands are not my hands
No one sees and no one cares
What gets broken
Not for rhyme and not for reason
What gets broken
What gets broken

Going far, getting nowhere
Going far the way you are
Going far, getting nowhere
Going far the way you are
Going far, getting nowhere
To tomorrow, to tomorrow
The way you are
To tomorrow, climb the ladder
Going far, getting nowhere
To tomorrow, to tomorrow
The way you are
To tomorrow, climb the ladder
You might also like
And the rhythm of machinery
Slows to a heartbeat
Echoing ghost tunes made by those who
Whistle while they work
Out of time and out of season
What gets broken

Going far, getting nowhere
Going far the way you are
Going far, getting nowhere
Going far the way you are
Going far, getting nowhere
To tomorrow, to tomorrow
The way you are
To tomorrow, climb the ladder
Going far, getting nowhere
To tomorrow, to tomorrow
The way you are
To tomorrow, climb the ladder

The way you are
Climb the ladder
The way you, way you are
Climb the ladder, climb the ladder

Going far, getting nowhere
Going far the way you are
Going far, getting nowhere
Going far the way you are
Going far, getting nowhere
To tomorrow, to tomorrow
The way you are
To tomorrow, climb the ladder
Going far, getting nowhere
To tomorrow, to tomorrow
The way you are
To tomorrow, climb the ladder

The way you are
Climb the ladder
The way you are
Climb the ladder
The way you are
Climb the ladder
The way you, way you are
