One, two, three, four!

Heard every word that was said that night
When the light of the world put the world to right
Well here's to the boys back in 628
Where an ear to the wall was a twist of fate
I will shine a blinding light
Through those hearts as black as night
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But at least the seeds of love will be sown

Now once in awhile when I feel no shame
I get down on my knees and I pray for rain
And though the breeze blows gently while I state my case
There'll be certain men waiting just to scratch my face
Hand on my heart I will make a stand
For the life and the times of the mirrorman

In my head there is a mirror
When I've been bad, I've been wrong
Food for the saints that are quick to judge me
Hope for a bad man, this is the bad man's song
You might also like
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

Guilt in the frame of the looking-glass
Puts a shine on the mind where reflections pass
Where the jigsaw pieces of a broken man
Try and fit themselves together again
Lies in disguise in the name of trust
Put your head in the sand it will turn to dust
What's your problem? What's your curse?
Won't it make the matter worse?

In my head there is a mirror
When I've been bad, I've been wrong
Food for the saints that are quick to judge me
Hope for a bad man, this is the bad man's song

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Woah
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Uh-huh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Woohoo
Ooh, ooh, ooh
And they say "Faith can move mountains
Fire can cleanse your soul"
Faith can move mountains
But mind over matter won't you stop all your chatter, no
Faith can move mountains
Faith can move mountains
But mind over matter won't you stop all your chatter, no


I heard every word that was said that night
When the light of the world put the world to right
When I hear soft whispers at the break of day
...
Sweet talking boys who can do no wrong
When the stories are tall as the day is long
With such a thin line drawn between friend and foe
Lord help me now and bless my soul

Look at yourself, see how you lie
Your hands start shaking and you don't know why
Look at yourself, see how you lie
Your hands start shaking, they start shaking
Look at yourself, see how you lie
Your hands start shaking and you don't know, don't know, don't know why
Look at yourself, see how you lie
Shake, shake, shake, you don't know why
Don't know why, no you don't know why
Well there's food for the saints that are quick to judge me
Hope for a bad man...

In my head, there is a mirror
When I've been bad, I've been wrong
I have been really, really, really wrong
Food for the saints that are quick to judge me
Food for the saints that are quick to judge me
Hope for a bad man, this here is the bad man's Song

In my head, there is a mirror
There is a mirror
When I've been bad, I've been wrong
And I've been bad, I have been really, really, really wrong
Food for the saints that are quick to judge me
Food for the saints that are so quick to judge me
Hope for a bad man
