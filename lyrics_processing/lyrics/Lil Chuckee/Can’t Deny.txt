Murder, I seen that
Niggas killin' that 8, I mean that
I coulda sold coke, but I spit dope shit
So just instead, they fein that
Fuck a pipe, need a mic for the feedback
I wasn't sure when a brotha said he'd be back
I couldn't trust that
Cause in the streets you ain't got a gang rep flag
I'm puttin' mines on this cockback
No cable, DVD, we watched Star Trek
We  from New Orleans, 
I wasn't different from the many
It was spittin' that kept me from starvin'
The hottest shit up in the market, tell 'em I ain't lost it
I remember I had throwaways and I tossed it
I was on the grind, I ain't hear what they talkin'
It's all fun and games 'til somebody hit a coffin
They pissed off, yeah they pissed off
But watch them niggas fade just soon as I blast off
They ain't sayin' shit when they took the mask off
Coulda been on this flight if you didn't  off
But now we goin' in, we zonin'
We on it and they see us
Upon us, you phony
One day, mothafucka you gon' need us
One day, mothafucka you gon' need us
Now you hit that line, tryna get you a feature
Charge that boy, charge that boy
I had to get it how I live, I don't know them people
Every night, take a kneel, thank the Lord
I take a walk in my shoes, nigga you'd take 'em off
Damn right, I done seen it all
Woadie I'm a hoodlum and a fuckin' superstar
You might also like
Talkin' 'bout he can't deny this here, boy
I done been paid my dues, you heard me?
Nigga they hated on me
It's all good, fuck 'em, let's get it!

No you can't deny this here, no you can't deny this game
I'ma keep gunnin' 'til I get rich, clock is tickin', that son of a bitch
I see niggas all in my rear, I see niggas tryna get trill
Well you can tell 'em I'm 'bout to switch gears
Tell them shit's about to get real

Let's get it back here again, back here again
And they lookin' like "Damn you came back from the pit"
Hell nah, I've been grindin' hard, you been snoozin' hard
Slob on your chin
Ain't 'bout the money, I can't comprehend
I don't know you, look we ain't kin
I'ma show you, can't be played with
Everybody here 100, gotta face it
Oh Lord, oh why would I stop?
I done witnessed Nicki pop
Drizzy shot, Spitta rock
That just told me get up on my shit and bring my fuckin' block
All I want, hundred Ms, buy my shit in parkin' lots
Oh man, is that too much?
They feel they can steal from us
I see 'em, they on my line
But just tell 'em I ain't pickin' up
Hike 2,1,3, run it through the hole
I see they're hatin', yeah they hatin', plottin' on the low
Mad cause I'm blowin' cash, no calico
LG to , what I bang, all I know
This shit is overdue
All that blackballin', tellin' niggas don't fuck with Chuck, that ain't gon' work. The streets rockin' with me, I don't need nobody else. This overdue!
