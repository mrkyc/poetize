I done been to Hell and back, I'm here now
Testin' through the , lookin' for a frown
This damage that I'm doin', I know it's gon' cost me
I know it's gon' cost me, but fuck it

Cause I know I ain't takin' no more
Losses, losses, losses, losses
Losses, losses, losses, I ain't takin' no more
Losses, losses, losses, losses
Losses, losses, losses, takin' no more losses
I will jack you if I really have to
When you're on your ass, when they laugh at you
I got shit to do and I gotta make a move
Losses, losses, losses, losses

If it ain't one thing, it's another problem I'm facin'
I'm just lookin' for a way, mind steady racin'
Put my mark in the game, the book can never erase it
They don't wanna see you shine, you just gotta face it

But I can't, they don't understand who I am
They would never, they would never understand the pain
But fuck 'em daddy, you gotta show 'em
They waitin' on your downfall, now you gotta keep goin'
Long as you keep it G, smokin' on the Gs
Say mothafuckas sleep, oh they gonna see
You bust your mothafuckin' ass to not succeed
Long as you stay true to the Lord, stay on your knees
And when them tears on your shirt, there's somebody doin' worse
Feet up in the dirt, I know it feel like a curse
But you gotta make it work, give a fuck what the cost is

I can't take no more Ls, so I'm ridin' with the heater
Lookin' every other way, cause them demons will creep up
And they're ringin' up my phone, yeah you know that's when they need you
And this the other way around, dawg you can't even reach them
When they know that you're feedin' 'em
I've been stressin', I've been stressin'
I ain't even been sleepin'
I've been stressin', ain't even been sleepin'
Say it's all for a reason, tell me why it always happens to us
I fall down, get back up, I know it's life, but I mean, fuck it
They done killed my lil' cousin
They say Chuck don't know how to act now
If you got the call that I got
Auntie dyin' up in the background
And I know retaliation ain't gon' solve it
But fuck, load up the...
