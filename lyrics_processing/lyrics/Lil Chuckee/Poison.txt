It's driving me out of my mind
Thats why its hard for me to find
Can't get it outta my head
This kiss, I love her. That girl is

Ah. you know you bad
That's the fucked up thing about it
If any other guy would had that there
He wouldn't know what to do without it
I mean damn gina
The boy can't stop thinking bout you
Got me growing grey hair
In this white chair
Need you right here
Shit you got that fucking ring don't you
Back with a new one
And she remind me of you
But i only get a round
Cause when a nigga pound
I be thinking of you
Remember that good times
Well i remember your head
Plus i be seen reminiscing with your bitches
On the side of the bed
Fuck that. miss me with the feeling shit
Buy and get some shit
I throw stacks with two willing chicks
Probably bigger tits
Probably fuck with her just for the day
I mean heaven sakes
Got me with all these girls in my bed
And i just do it to get you outta my head, for real
You might also like 

Whoa. Don't do it
Bet that ass probably got you thinking different
She gon' have your ass hidden in a ditch with stitches
All there with 38 inches of Brazilian
Really? Over hair dog like I don't  even care dog
I'm just tryna get some dough I'm in the chair dog
Used to get a nigga boss I'm a heir dog
That's all
Why niggas don't listen
Niggas don't listen
Now she got you here sitting
Tryna calculate up your visions
Cause, are you really Caesar
Had to learn that with Melissa
Damn they made it nice where you was
But I had to get back on my mission
Now, like i'm supposed to, like i'm supposed to
Why oh why bitch, I'ma show you, I'mma show you
You know that i'm a dog
That poonany old school
When your bitches all bad
That's the shit you go through for real
 

Never trust a big ass and a smile
In the words of BBD
They'll take everything!
Turn Up. Party Girls
All my girls are party girls
You might have to leave your nigga
Come up in this party world
