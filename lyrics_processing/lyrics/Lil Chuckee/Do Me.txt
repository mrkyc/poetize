I think I been gone too long
But tell 'em I've been grindin'
Putting work on the phone
And I think it was written
You can stop it if you tried, he was sleep and he lied
I was busy thanking Lord for the things that he provide

I've been putting work in and I was tryna celebrate
I'll been doing big shit, I make sure them haters never hate
You can't stop what God got for me
There's too many people up in here that love me
Put your hands up (up), up (up), up (up)
Love me
Put your hands up (up), up (up)
There's too many people up in here that love me

Now put 'em up in the sky, this what we need to survive
Cause all that nonsense they promotin', killin' my vibe
If I shoot it, miss it, damn, I tried
What I supposed to do, sit around like you can't decide?
They label me as a menace
Taking lives out predictions
It's a hunger game out here, this the world that we live in
They want me to repent and be satisfied with the pennies
Until  I cause collision, I land on top if this ended
I stay ridin', I lay low
Don't lose track of the payroll
See my haters in public, look in their face like oh hey ho
Fans tell me keep going, we don't care if they say no
We behind you nigga
Just keep grindin' nigga
Just stay humble and one hunnid and you gon' get richer
You supposed to blow
You know God gon' walk with ya'
And I know sometimes it rain but we gon' shine in this weather
And we ain't living in the moment, this our time forever

I see the hate from a distance
Tell 'em I'm far from finished
It's too much love in here for your team to be mad cause we winning
From living next to the trap house to H.O.B. with a  house
I remember once they hate, they love to see that you snap out
Time to turn up, light one
Celebrate tonight
Cause, I ain't supposed to be in this building
Let alone I earn one
I'm just busy thanking Lord for the things he did for me
Sittin' here waitin', I'm just patient for this  he sent for me
Like, like, no really
He the reason where I'm at where I'm at
He still, still gon' ride for me,  flats
These rappers thinkin' they God soon as they get their cheque
What the hell wrong with 'em, I can't do no song with 'em
I'm comin' how you comin'; with a force
Walkin' in , I don't really need a torch
Going a hunnid' miles, hunnid' miles, full course
Get to the finish line, we could ball, full court
You know it
