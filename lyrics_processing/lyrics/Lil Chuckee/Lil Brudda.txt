Back in the slums, packin' alarm
Laid on a ton, can't no nigga play me
I don't give  a fuck what they told y'all
I've been on the grind, whole time, ain't nobody made me
Don't tell me  what they say, why you let 'em talk about me?
Pussy niggas run their mouth like a water fountain
They can keep hatin', yeah they can keep doubtin'
But I'ma shit on 'em every time I'm around 'em

Yeah I'll be right back, I'm on a mission, lil brudda
You quick to pull that TEC, but you gotta listen, lil brudda
My eyes never closed, some like to play undercover
You wanna be a soldier? Send that flag to his mother
They all plottin' on me, I see 'em all in a huddle
Migo got that pack, all in that tunnel, he smuggled
They wanna blackball me, they say I cause too much trouble
Oh yeah? They say I

They tried to hold me back, I had to put up a battle
Young nigga switch it up, they tried to copy my shadow
I'm still the same, nigga, I never change oh no never
Look if you need them thangs, we got some shit we can mail you
I'm tryna put you on, I'm tryna teach you some shit
But you ain't ever listenin', see you a stupid lil bitch
I had to switch it up, I copped that Benz with the kit
Young nigga hit a lick, and I ain't been the same since
I show you how to get this money without usin' a cutter
I've been trappin' overnight, on the road, workin' double

The world gon' hit him up, know it ain't nothin' but somethin'
He gon' go if I say go, don't care 'bout the repercussions
He tried a 9 to 5, but that there wasn't budgin'
Layin' the society, lil woadie out here thuggin'
He want dollar, he want dollar, he do whatever for it
Hate to say it but if his cousin play with it, he gon' pay for it
He just tryna feed his kid, get a lil' ice on his arm
Just wanna shine on them hoes, and show off his lil' charm
Can you blame him? No dawg you can't
Diamonds and whippin', it's all niggas think
Life before you pull it, just think twice
Somethin' to change, it ain't right
He done went brainless, he done went aimless
Tried to change his life
Throw him some stacks, he still bangin'
