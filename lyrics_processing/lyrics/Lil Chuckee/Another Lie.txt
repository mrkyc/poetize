Voice going crazy on this hook like a whirl wind
But then you tell another lie and another lie
Another lie, la la la la

You play with my heart, you think it's exercise
I wanted to still get dome with my younger guys
I knew you needed a nigga home so I sacrificed
You didn't appreciate it, you thought I was supposed to do it anyway
But anyway, I got chicks to do anything
Anything, then talk about a wedding ring
All this yapping 'bout but it ain't seen
Coulda had that big ass in that red Beam
Throwing off what you heard and what you ain't seen
You missed your blessing, you can hurt from that
Give her ass two weeks, she gonna be calling back
