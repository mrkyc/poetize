Your shadow walks faster than you
You don't really know what to do
Do you think that you're not alone?
You really think that you are immune to it
It's going to get that the best of you
It's going to lift you up and let you down
Mmm-mmm-mmm

It will defeat you then teach you to get back up
After it takes away all that you learned to love

Your reflection is a blur
Out of focus but in confusion
The frames are suddenly burnt
And in the end of a roll of illusion
Is a ghost waiting its turn
Now I can see right through
It's a warning that nobody heard

It will teach you to love what you're afraid of
After it takes away all that you learned to love
You might also like
But you don't always have to hold your head
Higher than your heart

You better hope you're not alone
You better hope you're not alone
You better hope you're not alone
You better hope you're not alone
You better hope you're not alone
You better hope you're not alone
You better hope you're not alone
You better be hoping you're not so
Hope you're not alone

Your, your echo comes back out of tune
Now you can quite get used to it
Reverb is just a room
The problem is that there's no truth to it
It's fading way too soon
The shadow is on the move
And maybe you should be moving too

Before it takes away all that you learned to love
It will defeat you then teach you to get back up
'Cause you don't always have to hold your head
Higher than your heart

You better hope you're not alone
You better hope you're not alone
You better hope you're not alone
You better be hoping you're not alone
You better hope you're not alone
You better hope you're not alone
You better hope you're not alone
You better hope you're not so

Hope you're not alone
Better ho-oh-oh-oh-ope
Hope, better hope you're not alone
