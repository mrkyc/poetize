There's traffic in the sky
And it doesn't seem to be getting much better
There's kids playing games on the pavement
Drawin' waves on the pavement, mm-mm
Shadows of the planes on the pavement, mm-mm

It's enough to make me cry
But that don't seem like it would make it feel better
Maybe it's a dream and if I scream it will burst at the seams
Whole place would fall into pieces
And then they'd say

Well how could we have known?
I'll tell them it's not so hard to tell, nah, nah, nah
If you keep addin' stones
Soon the water will be lost in the well, mm

And puzzle pieces in the ground
No one ever seems to be diggin'
Instead they're lookin' up towards the heavens
With their eyes on the heavens, mm-mm
The shadows on the way to the heavens, mm-mm
You might also like
It's enough to make me cry
But that don't seem like it would make it feel better
The answers could be found, we could learn from diggin' down
But no one ever seems to be diggin'
Instead they'll say

Well how could we have known?
I'll tell them it's not so hard to tell, nah, nah, nah
If you keep addin' stones
Soon the water will be lost in the well, mm

And words of wisdom all around
But no one ever seems to listen
They're talkin' 'bout their plans on the paper
Buildin' up from the pavement, mm-mm
The shadows from the scrapers on the pavement, mm-mm

It's enough to make me sigh
But that don't seem like it would make it feel better
The words are all around but the words are only sounds
And no one ever seems to listen
Instead they'll say
Well how could we have known?
I'll tell them it's really not so hard to tell, nah, nah, nah
If you keep addin' stones
