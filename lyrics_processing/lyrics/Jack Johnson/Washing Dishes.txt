In the morning when the world came awake
Before you knew me I knew your name
It was painted across the day as it breaks
An impression in your window frame

When you saw me out your window, singing from the garden
Only the beginning, I'm only getting started
I don't mind the digging, baby, I'll work harder
I've been washing dishes, singing from the bottom

But one day I'll be running this place
And one day I could take you away
But I want you to wonder what's my name
'Cause I need you to want me the same

'Cause when you saw me washing dishes, singing from the bottom
Only the beginning, I'm only getting started
I don't mind the digging, baby, I'll work harder
I've been in the ashes, singing from the garden

Where everything reaches for the sun
Still unsure of what we'll become
But I need you to reach out to me
See in me more than I could see 'cause I'm afraid that
You might also like
One day is only two words we say
I don't want to let them get in the way
Of all the plans that we should be making right now
Right now
Who took the time and where did they take it?
I want to take it back, I don't want to let them break it
All these plans that we should be making right now
Right now

You see, now, one day I'll be running this place
And one day I could take you away
But I want you to wonder what's my name
'Cause I need you to want me the same

When you saw me out your window, singing from the garden
Only the beginning, I'm only getting started
I don't mind the digging, baby, I'll work harder
I've been washing dishes, singing from the bottom

But one day is only two words we say
I don't want to let them get in the way
All these plans that we should be making right now
Right now
Who took the time and where did they take it?
I want to take it back, I don't want to let them break it
