Sweepin' the floors, open up the doors, yeah
Turn on the lights, gettin' ready for tonight
Nobody's romancin' 'cause it's too early for dancin'
But here comes the music

Bright lights flashin' to cover up your lack of
So many people, so many problems, so many reasons
To buy another round, drink it down
Just another night on the town
With the big man, money man, better than the other man
He got the plan with the million dollar give a damn
When nobody understands, he'll become a smaller man
The bright lights keep flashin', women keep on dancin'

With the clowns, yeah, yeah, yeah
They pick me up when I'm down, yeah, yeah
The rodeo clowns, yeah, yeah, yeah
Pick me up when I'm down

The disco ball spinnin', all the music and the women and
The shots of tequila, man they'll say that they need ya
What they really need, is just a little room to breath
Teeny boppin' disco queen, she barely understands
Her dreams of belly button rings and other kinds of things
Symbolic of change but the thing that is strange
Is that the changes occurred, and now she's just a part of the herd
You might also like
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Man I thought that you heard, yeah, yeah
The changes occurred, yeah, yeah, yeah
Just a part of the herd

Lights out, shut down, late night, wet ground
You walk by look at him but he can't look at you, yeah
You might feel pity but he only feels the ground
You understand moods, but he only knows let down
By the corner there's another one
Reachin' out a hand, comin' from a broken man, well
You try to live but he's done tryin'
Not dead but definitely dyin'

With the rest of the clowns, yeah, yeah
Mm, mm, mm, mmm, mm, mmm, mm
With the rest of the clowns

Sweepin' the floors, open up the doors, yeah
Turn on the lights, gettin' ready for tonight
Nobody's romancin' 'cause it's too early for dancin'
