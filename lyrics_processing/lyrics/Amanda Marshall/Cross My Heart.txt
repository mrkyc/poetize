That's what the note said
5th grade
He's in her row two seats behind
Ten years old, the torture never ends
One day at recess she pulls him aside
She's taking his hand, She looks in his eyes
She's steppin' in close, So no one can hear
Then she whispers in his ear
She says
Tell me all your secrets
And I won't tell anybody
Pinky swear that I'm the one you love
When the world is dark
And you could swear you have no body
Look to the sky, it's written in the stars
Cross my heart
Time flies to graduation
They leave the party
Take a drive
She keeps asking where they're going
He laughs and looks away, it's a surprise
Out on the playground, right where they stood
Down on one knee he asks if she would
He gives her the ring, She starts to cry
It's the first night of the rest of their lives
You might also likeTell me all your secrets
And I won't tell anybody
Pinky swear that I'm the one you love
When the world is dark
And you could swear you have no body
Look to the sky, it's written in the stars
Cross my heart
Young love gets old
Real fast, In a small town
When you think your life is passing you by
It kills him to let her go
But she wants to fly
So he gives her the wings
And tells her goodbye
Baby Goodbye
The train enters the station
Track 11 on the Philadelphia line
He was early now he's waiting
And the people rush the doors
Some are laughing
Some are crying
Up on the platform
He scans the crowd
He doesn't see her
He looks all around
But damned disappointment hangs like a shroud
Suddenly a voice rings out
Says
Tell me all your secrets
And I won't tell anybody
Pinky swear that I'm the one you love
When the world gets dark
And you think you have no body
Look to the sky, it's written in the stars
Cross my heart
Tell me all your secrets
And I won't tell anybody
Pinky swear that I'm the one you love
When the world is dark
And you could swear you have no body
Look to the sky, it's written in the stars
