Every junkie knows the fix won't last
Strung out but the keeps on coppin'
Every politician with a shady past
Hopes a love child don't come knockin'
Every alcoholic swears "This drink's the last"
Every broker was a genius til the market crashed
Every gambler on a streak knows that he can't win
But he keeps on betting til the sky caves in
We can't breathe under water
And we don't know how to swim
But we keep on rocking the boat
Until we fall in
La la la la la la
Every stand-up comic has a serious night
Every streetwalker's somebody's daughter
Every soldier in the war's got God on his side
And that's why we can't stop the slaughter
Every magazine cover has been retouched
Every generation swears "It won't happen to us"
But it can & it will & we do & it does
You wanna know why? It's because
You might also likeWe can't breathe under water
And we don't know how to swim
But we keep on rocking the boat
Until we fall in
Until we fall in
Yeah yeah
We should quit while we're ahead, instead
We wait to get knocked around
Cause you never need the lifeboat
Til the ship is going down
Well, look around
Every now and then life calls your bluff
You gotta walk the talk you're talking
Everybody wishes they could just shut up
But we just keep going on and on and on and on and on...
We can't breathe under water
And we don't know how to swim
But we're crossing all our fingers, stripping down and diving in
We can't breathe under water
And we don't know how to swim
But we keep on rocking the boat
Until we fall in
Until we fall in
La la la la la la, la la la la yeah
Careful what you're wishing for, you just might get it
Live today 'cause if you don't you might live to regret it
