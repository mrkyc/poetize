You see my long blonde hair and the particular way
That my lips are shaped
That my body takes, When you talk to me
What do you know when you know me?
Don't file me under catagories, Your deceived
You don't know me
I'm not only a surface, a country
What you don't know about me is
CHORUS
I'm a double agent on my momma's side
The shit I hear you say just blows my mind
Every time, recognize
Though who I am to you is not a lie
I don't have to volunteer and say
That I was born a particular way
I got not uniform, I'm camouflaged in any light
Obviously you can't tell
I'm a double agent on my momma's side
What do you hear when you hear me?
I hear you crank up Jay-Z ,it's your favorite jam
And you talk with your hands like an MC
Betcha never get stopped by the police
You never ask me about me (no,no,no)
About how I feel when you call all your white friends
"Homeboy","nigga" and "homie"
Oh please
It hurts me
And you don't see
What you don't know about me is
(I told you everybody's got a story.)

I am invisible (I am)
Am I responsible? (I am)
I'm in between it all
Who is the enemy?
I am part of no plan
My honesty is contraband
My blood is thicker than any man's
What do you like when you like me?
I am ingredients far beyond flour and molecules
Calluses, family jewels
I'm no fool
We went to the same school
Some of your best friends are just like me
But when they're not around, you make jokes and conspire
The fire gets higher and I feel the heat
Rising underneath
Who is more deceived?
What you don't know about me is
