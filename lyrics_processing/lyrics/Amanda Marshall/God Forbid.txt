Look at who He's giving it to, He must not care about it at all
Must like to see it abused, thrown around, wasted
On things that we don't use
That's the only excuse
We got mansions no one lives in
Folks buy yachts and they can't swim
God don't care about money, if He did
God forbid
It's got to be (it's got to be) that God hates the water
Look at who He's giving it to, He must not care about it all
Do you think He's confused why we're working, filling the oceans full of crude to poison the food?
Tells His friends that we're crazy
Cuz we won't leave well enough alone
Fish can't find another home
Devil or the deep blue sea, your choice kid
God forbid
Spend what we don't have on things that we don't need
Impressing all the people we don't like
Busy trying to fill these cracks with nicotine and Botox
Building walls, making laws that tell us who to blame
(The more we change, the more we stay the same)
The fire rages on, we're choking on the smoke
Of this eternal flame
Burning it down while we make it rain
You might also likeStrung out on the politics of broken things that we can't fix
One for the money, two for the show, too much ain't enough, gimme some more (Diamonds, Botox, cigarettes, liposuction, cybersex, diamonds, Botox, cigarettes, woohoo)
Diamonds, Botox, cigarettes, liposuction, cybersex, bank bailouts and Third World debt
Gimme cheap gas and a private jet
Fancy cars, exotic pets
God must dig that stuff, I guess And if God is one of us
Man, that would explain so much (Diamonds, Botox, cigarettes, liposuction, cybersex, diamonds, Botox, cigarettes, woohoo)
(Diamonds, Botox, cigarettes, cheap gas and a private jet)
Sing hallelujah
