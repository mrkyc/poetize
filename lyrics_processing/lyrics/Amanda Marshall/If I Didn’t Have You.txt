'Til I was thinking of you
I don't remember a thing before
I opened my eyes and you came into view
I don't know what I was doing
When there was nothing to do
Must've been waiting for someone, baby
Now I can see, I was waiting for you
I'd give up my sight just to see you
I'd beg, I would borrow and steal
I'd cut off my hands just to touch you
And tear out my heart so you'd know how I feel
There's nowhere that I wouldn't follow
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
'Cause I wouldn't want to be me
If I didn't have you
Driving myself to distraction
Until you got in my way
I was just whistling Dixie 'til you
Struck up the band and they started to play
I don't know how I was living
Until you came in my life
I always knew there was something wrong
Then you came along, baby, you made it right
You might also likeI'd give up my sight just to see you
I'd beg, I would borrow and steal
I'd cut off my hands just to touch you
And tear out my heart so you'd know how I feel
There's nowhere that I wouldn't follow
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
'Cause I wouldn't want to be me
If I didn't have you
I was alone in the silence
'Til I was hearing your voice
I couldn't see my way clear until
You parted the clouds and you gave me a choice
I couldn't pick up the pieces
'Til I was falling apart
I didn't know I was bleeding
'Til your love fixed this hole, baby, here in my heart
I'd give up my sight just to see you
I'd beg, I would borrow and steal
I'd cut off my hands just to touch you
And tear out my heart so you'd know how I feel
There's nowhere that I wouldn't follow
There's no place that I'd rather be
This life without you would be hollow
This love is a gift, and you gave it to me
All that I am, you have made me
And baby, I know that it's true
I'd give it all up in a heartbeat
Just to spend every moment with you
There's no place that I wouldn't follow
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
'Cause I wouldn't want to be me
