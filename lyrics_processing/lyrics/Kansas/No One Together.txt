Have many left behind us
Who can count the good men gone away
The fruits of all our labours
Have left us as we started
We've come too far to end it in a day
It seems that everything we do is wrong
A one-way trip to nowhere all along
Just look around and tell me what you see
Another stupid page of history
No one together
No one is touching ground
Look at each other
Chaos is all around
Same situation
Nothing is really new
No one together
No one is me and you
Lo! the horn of plenty
Is bursting at the seams
The harvest of the world will be our prize
We claim to know the secrets
The answers have been found
But how can one fool make another wise
There's nothing better than it used to be
To live and die is still a mystery
We take away and we give nothing back
We just consume it all and still we lack

No one is touching ground
Look at each other
Chaos is all around
Same situation
Nothing is really new
No one together
No one is me and you
Each day passes by us
So quickly now
You can feel it drawing much closer now
The signs are in the faces
Of the people in the streets
The signs are in the sounds I hear
Their voices filled with pain and fear
You can feel it drawing near you now
The multitudes are searching
And wondering in vain
For what they seek cannot be found in men
The truth that lies before us now is plain for all to see
To grow without is not to grow within
For in the promise is a victory
To see the way that everything should be
To feel the joy that we were meant to know
We should've realized so long ago
We're all together
Harmony will abound
Look at each other
All that was lost is found
New situation
If our directions to
We're all together
