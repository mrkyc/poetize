Red rain is coming down
Red rain
Red rain is pouring down
Pouring down all over me

I am standing up at the water's edge
In my dream
I cannot make a single sound
As you scream
It can't be that cold
The ground is still warm to touch
Hey, we touch
This place is so quiet, sensing that storm

Red rain is coming down
Red rain
Red rain is pouring down
Pouring down all over me

Well I've seen them buried
In a sheltered place in this town
They tell you that this rain
Can sting and look down
There is no blood around
See no sign of pain
Hey, no pain
Seeing no red at all, see no rain
You might also like
Red rain is coming down
Red rain
Red rain is pouring down
Pouring down all over me

(Red Rain)
Ohh, ohh
Putting the pressure on much harder now
To return again and again
(Red rain) Just let the red rain splash you
Let the rain fall on your skin
(Red rain) I come to you, defenses down (Oh)
With the trust of a child

Oh, red rain coming down
Red rain
Red rain is pouring down
Pouring down all over me

And I can't watch anymore
No more denial
It's so hard to lay down
In all of this
Red rain coming down
Red rain is pouring down
Red rain is coming down all over me
I see it
Red rain coming down
Red rain is pouring down
Red rain is coming down all over me
I'm bathing in
Red rain coming down
Red rain is coming down
Red rain is coming down all over me
I'm begging you
Red rain coming down
Red rain coming down
Red rain coming down
Red rain coming down
Over me in the red, red sea
Over me, over me
