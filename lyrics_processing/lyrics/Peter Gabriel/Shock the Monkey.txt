Cover me when I run
Cover me through the fire
Something knocked me out the trees
Now I'm on my knees
Cover me, darling, please, hey, hey, hey

Monkey, monkey, monkey
Don't you know you're gonna
Shock the monkey? Hey, hey

Fox the fox, rat on the rat
You can ape the ape, I know about that
There is one thing you must be sure of
I can't take anymore
Darling, don't you monkey with the monkey
Hey, hey, hey

Monkey, monkey, monkey
Don't you know you're gonna
Shock the monkey? Hey, hey
Shock the monkey, hey, hey, hey, yeah

Cover me when I sleep
Cover me when I breathe
You throw your pearls before the swine
Make the monkey blind
Cover me, darling, please, hey, hey, hey

Monkey, monkey, monkey
Don't you know you're gonna
Shock the monkey? Hey, hey
Shock the monkey, hey, hey, hey, yeah

(A monkey, ah) Ground beneath me shake
(Monkey) And the news is breaking

Watch the monkey get hurt, monkey
