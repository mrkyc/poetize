Caught the chaos
In the market square
I don't know what, I don't know why
But something's wrong down there
Their bodies twisting and turning
In a thousand ways
The eyes all rolling round and round
Into a distant gaze

Ah, look at that crowd
Some are jumping up in the air
Say, "We're drowning in a torrent of blood!"
Others going down on their knees
Seen a saviour come out of the mud

Oh, Mother
It's eating out my soul
Destroying law and order
I'm going to lose control
What can I do to stop this plague
Spread by sight alone
Just a glimpse and then a quiver
Then they shiver to the bone
You might also like
Ah, look at them go
Bunderschaft, you are going daft?
Better seal off the castle grounds
"This is Moribund, the Burgermeister
I'm gonna keep this monster down
Somebody sent the subversive element
Going to chase it out of town"

No-one will tell what all this is about
But I will find out
I will find out
I will find out

This thing's outrageous
I tell you, on the level
It's really so contagious
Must be the work of the devil
You better go now, pick up the pipers
And tell them to play
Seems the music keeps them quiet
There is no other way

Ah, close the doors
"We've tried potions and waxen dolls
But none of us could find any cures,"
Mother, please, is it just a disease
That has them breaking all my laws?
Check if you can disconnect the effect
And I'll go after the cause
No-one will tell what all this is about
But I will find out
I will find out
I will find out

Mother, you know your son
When I say I will, I will
They'll be sorry
