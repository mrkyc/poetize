Did you think that your feet had been bound
By what gravity brings to the ground?
Did you feel you were tricked by the future you picked?
Well, come on down
All those rules don't apply
When you're high in the sky
So, come on down
Come on down

We're coming down to the ground
There's no better place to go
We've got snow upon the mountains
We've got rivers down below
We're coming down to the ground
We hear the birds sing in the trees
And the land will be looked after
We send the seeds out in the breeze

Did you think you'd escaped from routine
By changing the script and the scene?
Despite all you made of it, you're always afraid
Of the change
You've got a lot on your chest
Well, you can come as my guest
So, come on down
Come on down

We're coming down to the ground
There's no better place to go
We've got snow upon the mountains
We've got rivers down below
We're coming down to the ground
We hear the birds sing in the trees
And the land will be looked after
We send the seeds out in the breeze

Like the fish in the ocean (A-whoa-a-he)
We felt at home in the sea (A-whoa-a-he)
We learned to live off the good land (A-whoa-a-he)
Learned to climb up a tree (A-whoa-a-he)
Then we got up on two legs (A-whoa-a-he)
But we wanted to fly (A-whoa-a-he)
Oh, when we messed up our homeland (A-whoa-a-he)
We set sail for the sky

We're coming down to the ground
There's no better place to go
We've got snow upon the mountains
We've got rivers down below
We're coming down to the ground
We hear the birds sing in the trees
And the land will be looked after
We send the seeds out in the breeze
We're coming down (Down)
Coming down to Earth (Down)
Like babies at birth (Down)
Coming down to Earth (Down to Earth)
We're gonna find new priorities (Down)
These are extraordinary qualities (Down)
(Down)
(Down to Earth)
