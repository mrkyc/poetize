Oohh, ooohhhh

When you kiss me
Are you breathless
When you touch me
Do you fall apart
Do you shiver when you dream, when you dream
Is there a pounding in your heart
When I talk, do you hear
When I cry, do you care
When I wake up in the morning
Do you want me there?

I want you to know me
I want you to hold me
To know who I am
What I want
When I feel
You're the only one that's real
I want you to know me
I want you to hold me
'Cause when we kiss
When we touch
All I know
You're the only one that's real
You might also like
When you call me
Are you smiling, yeah
When you leave me
Does it make you sad
Is there an emptiness you feel, that you feel
When we're together are you glad
And by silence, you told me
If I'm crazy, console me
'Cause in each other's arms is where I wanna stay

I want you to know me
I want you to hold me
To know who I am
What I want
When I feel
You're the only one that's real
I want you to know me
I want you to hold me
'Cause when we kiss
When we touch
All I know
You're the only one that's real
You're the only one that's real
Only one
I want you to know me
I want you to hold me
To know who I am
What I want
When I feel
You're the only one that's real
I want you to know me
I want you to hold me
'Cause when we kiss
When we touch
All I know
You're the only one that's real
I want you to know me
I want you to hold me
To know who I am
