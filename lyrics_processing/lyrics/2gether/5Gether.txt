Number 2-G-E-T-H-E-R
To the CD you play in you car
Drive to, cry to, blow that star
Tiger Woods, we 10 strokes under par
So tell me how far you could get
At the superstar sideshow that ain't it
Don't throw no fit
Just ride on the energy
It's 2gether from now until infinity

We are 5 (we are 5)
2gether (2gether)
We do our thang, baby

See all the girls with their hands in the air
You can tell by the screams this ain't Lilith Fair
We in a world now 2G's dragon lair
And we'll take off our shirts if ya double dog dare
Splitting my pants as I sit in the chair
Revenge of the nerds
Funny Hollywood square!
Tripping, skipping, to my loo hoo
Choo choo's coming through
Fast on the train track

Rubba dub dub
Sweet love in the tub
We're here to hug
Kiss and give you back rubs
Had to scratch our way up from down in the mud
We weren't discovered in no Mickey Mouse club
Playing our dub
Looking for a deal
We're too for real with 5 on the bill
5 on the court, championship
Just can't eat one of these potato chips
Yeah yeah yeah, it's just the flavor hits
As it bumps your hips
Through the eye of an eagle
We need no playa hating people
Sequel, equal to none
2gether, Masterpiece, job's done

"If there's gonna be 5 of us why not call us 5gether?"

And 1 times 5 is 2 and 5 times the noise coming back at you
