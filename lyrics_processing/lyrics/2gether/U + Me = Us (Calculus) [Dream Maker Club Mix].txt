They all come here lookin for their dream boys. Heh
Who makes those dreams?
Me
That's what I do. That's my job
A dream maker
Boy bands. Boy bands, boy bands
There are 5 basic types in any successful boyband
You got your rebel, your bad boy, one
You got your shy, bashful type, two
You got your little guy, your dewey-eyed youngster, three
Four, your reassuring, older brother type
And the heartthrob, your teen idol
He's the guy who keeps it all together, y'know
He's the guy who's eyes are lookin at you from the poster saying, "Hold me. Take care of me."
And that boy cannot have a tattoo!
You + me = us
You + me = us
I know my calculus
It says you plus me = us
Said I know my calculus
It says you plus me = us

Jerry: Two words, Carson. Bob Buss
Mickey: Yeah, man, the great Bob Buss, yo
Well I've never been good at history
And I don't give a crap about Robert E. Lee
When it comes to cosines
I know a thing or two
And I kicked ass on the test about me and you
Chorus
I know my calculus
It says you + me = us
Said I know my calculus
It says you + me = us
What the world needs now is boybands
Buss: Perfect! No problem. I've got a boyband!
Boy bands
Buss: What I need now is my troublemaker
I know where the bad boys hang out
Girl, algebra or trigonometry could never equal up
To what you do to me
So let's intergrate
Don't differentiate
If you were in my class
There ain't no way I could pass
I hate English, gym, and not to mention
I can't even afford to pay my attention
No philosophy could ever come between us
But we'll always have our Calculus
Repeat Chorus 2x
You + me = us
You + me = us
It's not about braces really
Or money or fame. Or girls. Heh
You + me = us
It's about respect
And integrity
Girl, no subject comes close to you
2gether sing it
I know my calculu-uhuhuhuhuhs
Chorus
Jerry: I'm Jerry O'Keefe!
I'm gonna be a star
Director: and again I'm gonna be a star. Arms wide! I'm gonna make it!
I'm gonna be a star!!!
