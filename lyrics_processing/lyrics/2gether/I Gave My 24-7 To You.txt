You said jump
I asked how high
You made the rules
That we love by
And now I find
I've made a Frankenstein
I spoiled you rotten
Night and day
I always let you
Get your way
I did the crime, (Oh I did the crime)
Now I'm doing time, I'm doing

Baby
For showing you I care
I'm tearing out my hair
Baby
You never do your share
You know it isn't fair

I gave my 24/7 to you
Doing everything you wanted to, what you wanna do girl
I got you sushi and your yogurt too
You bought a ringer just to pull me through
Cause you know that it's true
I gave my 24/7 to you...
You might also like
Every time that we're alone
You sit there talking on the phone
It never end, (never ends)
Now I hate your friends, ooohh
Anytime I tell you no, (tell you no)
You're quick to tell me where to go
I'd leave it all (I'd leave it all)
If I had your balls (gimme those, baby)
Ohh yea...

Baby, I let you wear the pants
You wore out the romance
Baby, you never miss a chance
To tell me I can't dance

I gave my 24/7 to you
Doing everything you wanted to
I bought you Prada and Old Navy too
You never wear 'em
Now I'm feeling blue
Cause you know that it's true
I gave my 24/7 to you
Baby it's true, baby it's true
There will never ever, never ever
Ever never
Be another one like you
Ooohh

I gave my 24/7 to you
Doing everything you wanted to
I bought you Britney and Limp Bizkit too
You sold them back
All the money that I blew
Girl you know that it's true
I gave my 24/7 to you
