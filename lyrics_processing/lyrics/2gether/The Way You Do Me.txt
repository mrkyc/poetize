Girl the way you do me
Hey, oh
Girl the way you do me

Girl my head's on fire
Since our very first kiss
Dreamed of us together
Never dreamed this
Took me up to your room
To show me who you are
My cup is running over
Or maybe it's your bra

Girl, the way you do me
Makes me say wassup
When you're finished
I'm on the floor
Feeling down, feeling up
Girl the way you do me
Driving me insane
I never felt like this way before

I tell ya how I'm feeling
There's no way to begin
Like winning half a million
And make you sayPhilbin
Girl I know you're moody
You blow hot, blow cold, cold
That's the way I like it
You're what I want to hold
You might also like
Girl, the way you do me
Makes me say wassup
When you're finished
I'm on the floor
Feeling down, feeling up
Girl the way you do me
Driving me insane
I never felt like this way before
Girl, the way you do me
Makes me say wassup
When you're finished
I'm on the floor
Feeling down feeling up
Girl the way you do me
Driving me insane
I never felt like this way before

Our Paris Blues & Gap you
Can't wait to unwrap you
You know I am feeling you
Are you feeling me
If you didn't phone me
You see my sky turning black
I wish my mom would loan me
A couple of Prozac
But I won't let it get to me
I know you just forgot
'Cause girl you're always with me
Even when you're not
Girl, the way you do me
Makes me say wassup
When you're finished
I'm on the floor
Feeling down, feeling up
Girl the way you do me
Driving me insane
I never felt like this way before
Girl, the way you do me
Makes me say wassup
When you're finished
I'm on the floor
Feeling down feeling up
Girl the way you do me
Driving me insane
I never felt like this way before

Girl the way you do me
