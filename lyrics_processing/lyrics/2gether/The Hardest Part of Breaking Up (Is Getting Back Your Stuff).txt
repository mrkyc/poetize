It's been so long since I've seen your face
So long since I've been to first base
(Strike 3, you're out)
I really miss the feel of your kiss
But can I have back my things before
I get really pissed
You had my heart, my soul, my attention
But you walked out my life with my CD collection

(We're breaking up!)
Breaking up is hard enough (oh oh oh oh)
Say you had nothing but I called your bluff
You got my sweaters, my hat...
I can't find my cat! (meow)
The hardest part of breaking up
Is getting back your stuff

So tell me girl, do I have to say please
Or do I have to involve the police
(We have you surrounded)
There was a time when I'd trust you alone
I'd call you up girl, but you took my phone
You borrow stuff every time I turn my back
(Hey, that's mine!)
I can't believe I went out with a KLEPTOMANIAC

(We're breaking up!)
Breaking up is hard enough (oh oh oh oh)
Say you had nothing but I called your bluff
You got my sweaters, my hat...
I can't find my cat! (meow)
The hardest part of breaking up
Is getting back your stuff
Man you ever break up with a girl
And she keeps your stuff?
Man, what's up with that?
I dunno man, something wrong!
Ya know what I'm say?
Something wrong with dat...

Yea, uh, Mickey Parke up in this mug
Here we go one, two
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
U plus ME, it doesn't equal us
You took my car now I gotta take the bus
I thought I had a girl that I could trust
I guess I never knew my calculus!
