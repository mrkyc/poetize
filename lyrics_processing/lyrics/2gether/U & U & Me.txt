Let's get to know each other better
In a special way
I think about you baby
Each night and day
But you're always hanging around
With the girl next door
You do each other's makeup
And so much more

Friday's slumber party
When your parents are gone
I think about you girls
How we can get it on

U & U & me
Together we make three
In perfect harmony
Just U & U & me
U & U & me
Together we make three
A perfect fantasy
Just U & U & me

When I think about your girls
It makes me feel so fine
But when I call you on the phone
I need the party line

Playing spin the bottle
Kisses sweet as wine
I must've won the lotto
To get U & U & I
Jackpot

U & U & me
Together we make three
In perfect harmony
Just U & U & me
U & U & me
Together we make three
A perfect fantasy
Just U & U & me
U & U & me
Together we make three
In perfect harmony
Just U & U & me
U & U & me
Together we make three
A perfect fantasy
Just U & U & me
Listen girl...
When you kiss me
On the mouth
And down my neck
All at the same time
And you both whisper different things
Into different ears
I can't try to pretend
Girlfriends
U & U & me
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Together we make three, whoa
U & U & me
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Together we make three, whoa

U & U & me
Together we make 3
In perfect harmony
Just U & U & me
U & U & me
Together we make 3
A perfect fantasy
Just U & U & me
U & U & me
Together we make three
In perfect harmony
Just U & U & me
U & U & me
Together we make three
A perfect fantasy
Just U & U & me

U & U & me
Together we make three, whoa
U & U & me, yeah
Together we make three
