We're alone in your room
Playing Hexen and Doom
And now you're telling me goodbye
So you want us apart
That puts a knife in my heart
And a tear welling up in my eye
But let me remind you
How much you have been blind to
You've totally changed me
Mixed me up, rearranged me
My hair how you like
Quit hanging with Mike
And now you repay me
By trying to slay me

I want you to know that you hit me too low
And that I can barely breathe
If I told you that I'm bleeding inside
Would you simply let me get off my knees
(Let me get off my knees
That really hurts!)

Right where it counts
That's where you hit me
Right where it counts
I'm on my knees
Right where it counts
Stop kicking me please
Right where it counts
You might also like
I used to play football
I once was a goofball
But you didn't like that
No you didn't like that
The guys call me whipped
My popularity slipped
Because you just wanted a doormat
We shut out our friends
And I'd do it again
If you and I could get back, back on the highway
I thought we'd share our lives
Me husband, you wife
Now I am confused
And battered and I'm bruised

Why are you so mean
Now you've ruptured my spleen
Numbed my lowest extremities
If we were alone
And your parents weren't home
I'd yell a hundred obscenities

Right where it counts
That's where you hit me
Right where it counts
I'm on my knees
Right where it counts
Stop kicking me please
Right where it counts
Right where it counts
That's where you hit me
Right where it counts
I'm on my knees
Right where it counts
Stop kicking me please
Right where it counts
Uh, come on come on
To the bridge

It's hard for me to love you
When this is what you do
But baby I can love you
Right through the pain
Is this the way you show me
How much you love me
Or is there really something you're trying to say

Right where it counts
That's where you hit me
Right where it counts
I'm on my knees
Right where it counts
Stop kicking me please
Right where it counts
Right where it counts
That's where you hit me
Right where it counts
I'm on my knees
Right where it counts
Stop kicking me please
Right where it counts
Right where it counts
Right where it counts
Right where it counts
Right where it counts
(My voice is high, high, high, high)
Right where it counts
Right where it counts
Right where it counts
Right where it counts
Right where it counts
Right where it counts
Right where it counts
