Sometimes we must live through the darkness
In order to see through the light
We must visualize
(Chorus)
Close your eyes, visualize
The most beautiful girl that could be
Just one sight, mesmerize
It's like gazing right in a sea
Floating down the street
She stands out like a candlelight
When I look in her eyes
I'm not having sight
Couldn't change this feeling
So I walk towards her
With a vision in my mind
With a hand on my face
And a smile on hers
I softly say good night
(Chorus)
Close your eyes, visualize
The most beautiful girl that could be
Just one sight, mesmerize
It's like gazing right in to the sea
You might also likeNever dreamt of one who possessed
This gift of gold, gift of gold
She sees beyond through the darkest paths
She knows my soul
Will she be my girl
If she loves this world
Will I ever know
When the time is right
She will be my light
She is my angel
(Chorus)
Close your eyes, visualize
The most beautiful girl that could be
Just one sight, mesmerize
It's like gazing right in to the sea
With a touch of the sand
From a far away land
Gazing at perfection in the palm of my hand
A touch from her face
That far away place
There's no one above her
Her spirit and grace
(Chorus)
Close your eyes, visualize
The most beautiful girl that could be
Just one sight, mesmerize
It's like gazing right in to the sea
Yeah I'm walking
In the misty air
In my mind my baby is there
Having you in my life
Is my only care
Sooner so that we can dream
(Chorus)
Close your eyes, visualize
The most beautiful girl that could be
Just one sight, mesmerize
