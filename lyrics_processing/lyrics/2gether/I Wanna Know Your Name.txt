C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
I wanna know your name

I never knew that love could put a spell on me
Then you walked into the room
What to do
Should I let my package show
Or should I try and play it cool

I've been foolin'
I've been playin'
For so long my heart's been waitin'
To finally love someone like you
Now my heart's anticipatin'
All the love we could be makin'
I gotta get this message through

I wanna know your name
I wanna know everything about you
Driving me insane
I wanna know your name
How can I let you know
I wanna get right next to you
Checkin' the way you flow
I wanna know your name

Are you real or just a dream
You know I'm down
Anything you want to do
So won't you come and go with me

I can't take it
Please don't fake it
Here's my heart, now don't you break it
'cause you know i'm all about you
I am itchin'
Can't deny it
There's no cream out there can fight it
What can I say, what can I do

I wanna know your name
I wanna know everything about you
Driving me insane
I wanna know your name
How can I let you know
I wanna get right next to you
Checkin' the way you flow

I'd really like to please you
You got it

It's time that you believe it

You lookin' so fine tonight, baby
I just wanna drive you around in my viper
Yeah
We gonna speed through town, the top down
Your legs straddling the seat
Oh man
What's your name, what's your name, what's your name
I wanna know your name
What's your name, what's your name
What's your name, what's your name
