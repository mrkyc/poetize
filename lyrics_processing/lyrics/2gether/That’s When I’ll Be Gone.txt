Girl, I think you really know me
But you're afraid to trust me
Stop doubting my intentions
Why, why don't you believe me
There must be something
That you don't wanna mention

I said I'd shout it from the mountain tops
My never-ending love, that's what you've got

When the sun don't shine
And the moon don't glow
When the rain don't fall
And the wind don't blow
When the earth won't spin
And it's standing still
That's when I'll be gone

I ain't goin' nowhere
Not if you won't be there
I ain't goin' nowhere
Without you
You might also like
You
You're my inspiration
The only motivation
I have ever needed
Dreams
You know I got one baby
You and me forever
Let me just repeat it
(Hey hey hey)

I told you you could always count on me
What can I do to put your mind at ease?

When the sun don't shine
And the moon don't glow
When the rain don't fall
And the wind don't blow
When the earth won't spin
And it's standing still
That's when I'll be gone
When the rivers dry
And the oceans part
When there's not one beat
In a single heart
That's when I will stop (stop)
Stop lovin' you
That's when I'll be gone
I ain't goin' nowhere
Not if you won't be there
I ain't goin' nowhere
Without you

When the stars disappear
That's when I won't be near
I knew the day I saw ya
I'd always be there for ya
Make no mistake, baby, love is here

When the sun don't shine
And the moon don't glow
When the rain don't fall
And the wind don't blow
That's when I will stop (stop)
Stop loving you
That's when I'll be gone

I ain't goin' nowhere
Not if you won't be there
I ain't goin' nowhere
Without you
When the rivers dry
And the oceans part
When there's not one beat
In a single heart
That's when I will stop (stop)
Stop lovin' you
