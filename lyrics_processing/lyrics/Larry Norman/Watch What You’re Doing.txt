She thought it was a duck
She put it on the table
With its legs sticking up
Papa broke his glasses
When he fell down drunk
Tried to drown the kitty cat
Turned out to be a skunk
You gotta watch what you're doing
Didn't you know
You gotta watch what you're doing
Didn't you know
Little Joe Billy
Went fishing for trout
Played hooky from school
'til the cops found out
Didn't have a father
Was an only child
And his momma never beat him
So he grew up wild
You gotta watch what you're doing
Yeah
You might also likeI knew a girl
Sweet as could be
But she fell for men
Like a chain sawed tree
She listened to their lies
Was fooled by their charms
Now she's sitting
With a baby in her arms
You gotta watch what you're doing
Didn't you know
You gotta watch what you're doing
You oughta know that
You gotta watch out
Watch out
Well everything's fine
Till things get bad
Then you sit around thinking
Of the good times you had
But it ain't no good
To lead a life of sin
If you don't shape up
You know you'll never get in
You better watch what you're doing
Don't you know
You oughta know where you're going
Do you know
Some folks smile
They seem alright
Then you later find out
They were like demons in the night
Try to love everybody
But don't be blind
Cause some kind of people
Try to mess up your mind
You gotta watch who you know
Some people say that
God is dead
That He doesn't exist
Except inside your head
I wonder how many
Gonna be surprised
When they look straight up
And see Him coming through the skies
You gotta watch what you're doing
Cause He does, yeah
You know He watches what you're doing
Yes He does
And He knows where you're going
Yeah yeah yow
C'mon pilgrim
You know He loves you
He loves you more
Than He loves this cloven earth
Don't make your life bad
And start acting like and idiot
You better watch out
There's someone after you
It's the Devil
And he wants to lock you up in his zoo
He's got a nice little cage
Picked out just for you
I bet it fits real nice too
You gotta watch out
Watch what you're doing
Watch where you're going
Watch who you marry
Love who you bury
I was walking down the road
Just walking down the road
And I bumped into You
I had a dream which was a
Nightmare. it was the last
Time I saw fehrion. I was walking
Backwards, picking up the pieces
And looking for the footprints
Of the doctor. the butterfly had
Flown and a little wooden man said
"we sleep till He arrives." but
They mad him go back five steps
Which placed him right here and
Also in the kitchen hanging on
To a dead phone and looking
At the chicken
Two times seven
The clock struck eleven
And them seven days at the
Edge of space
And I told them, I've got to
Get back to earth
I feel like dying
Phase two is ensuing
Be careful what you sign
