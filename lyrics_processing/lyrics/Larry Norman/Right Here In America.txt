In China they're killed when they're found
And in Cuba the Christians live up in the hills
Because it's not safe in the towns
And to think it might happen right here in America
I know you think it's not true
But it's happening to Christians right here in America
Wait 'til it happens to you
The Christians in Berkeley are passing out Bibles
And food to the hungry
They're hoping to help out the people this way
But there are threats of the lives
Of their leaders and wives
They're not welcome to stay
And to think it might happen right here in America
Maybe you think it's not true
If you it's not happening to Christians right here in America
Wait 'til it happens to you
There's an underground church and it's following Jesus
And hoping to meet people's needs
But we don't have the time to build nice little churches
Besides we don't need to -
We're holding our church in the streets
You might also likeAnd we are passing out leaflets and underground pamphlets
From Buffalo to Monterey
And we're talkin' 'bout Jesus and all of a sudden
We're arrested and taken away
So I ask you, America, where do you stand?
Your people are starving, they're beaten and they're raped
And they're dying in jail cells, so what are your plans?
I'm not talking to congress or you politicians
Or Panthers or Muslims or Nixon or Birch
I'm addressing this song to the church
'Cause I've been in your churches and sat in your pews
And heard sermons on just how much money you'll need for the year
And I've heard you make reference to Mexicans, Chinamen
Niggers and Jews
And I gather you wish we would all disappear
And you call yourselves Christians, when really you're not
You're living your life as you please
If you're really a Christina, then put down yourself
And follow wherever God leads
I'm not talkin' religion, I'm talkin' 'bout Jesus
Put all your plans on the shelf
Let's stop marching for peace, and start marching for Jesus
And peace will take care of itself
Well, I pray that we Christians will get off our sofas
And stand up for what we believe
The time is too short, and Christ is returning
We'd better get ready to leave
We who are Christians should turn on the light
So the truth will shine bright as the day
Jesus will come like a thief in the night
And he'll steal all who love him away
There are Christians in Russia, they meet underground
In China they're killed when they're found
And in Cuba the Christians live up in the hills
Because it's not safe in the towns
And to think it might happen right here in America
I see you shaking your heads and I hear you saying
It just can't be true
But it's happened to me right here in America
