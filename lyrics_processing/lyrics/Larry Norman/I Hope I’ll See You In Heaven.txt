And the lessons that you're learning don't seem to take you far
And you just can't keep from stumbling
Though you try so hard to stand
And the truth can be so humbling
When it's just beyond your hand
As though youth were my invention
As though love lay undefined
To stay free was my intention
To stay young and unconfined
So I held my pride above you
Oh yes, what a fool was I
Holding back those words I love you
And letting out those words good bye
I was wrong to let you go
I was a child and I did not know about the love
That we both could have given
And now you've gone
So far away
I hope I'll see you again someday
But if I don't, I hope I'll see you in heaven
You might also likeI was foolish in my younger days
To think they'd never end
Life confused me with its changing ways and I could not comprehend
All the meaning in those moments
Now lost like footprints in the sand
And I'm standing here remembering but it's so hard to understand
And I was wrong to let you go
I was a child how could I know
That we both should have given
And now you've gone, so far away
I hope I'll see you again someday
But if I don't, I hope I'll see you in heaven
I've been sitting in this garden
In the middle of my days
And my memories fade and harden as the years they slip away
I've been looking in the mirror
At the age around my eyes
Time is such an earnest labourer, precision is his neighbour
Lay my body in the ground but let my spirit touch the sky
And I was wrong to let you go
I was a child I just didn't know about the love
That we both could have, should have given
And now you've gone, so far away
I hope I'll see you again someday
