In a little wooden shack
I was born about eighteen years ago
On the wrong side of the tracks
And i never knew my father
And i never had a home
Well i don't know where i came from
And i don't know where i'm goin'
I was born to be unlucky
From my shoulders to my shoes
And i guess i'm stuck with my unlucky blues
When i was just a young boy
I was raised on beans and trout
And on my seventh birthday
Well my momma, she threw me out
They say i'm good for nothin'
No one treats me kind
I don't care cause pretty soon
I'm gonna leave this world behind
I was born to be unlucky
From my shoulders to my shoes
And i guess i'm stuck with my unlucky blues
You might also likeI jumped into the river
To try to put myself away
A man jumped in and saved me
Spoiled a perfect day
He dragged me to the river's edge
He said he knew i had a need
Then he pulled out a soggy Bible
And that man began to read
Well he told me things i did not know
I'm glad i did not die
'cause he told me God's my father
And my real home is in the sky
And i said
Harmonica and lead guitar speak
He said i done a very foolish thing
To try to drown myself and die
And i told him i was glad
He happened to be passing by
He said God would forgive me
So i repented of my sin
Then he said i must be baptized
And he threw me in again
Awww i was born to be unlucky
From my shoulders to my shoes
I thought i must be stuck with these unlucky blues
Oh yeh
Lead guitar break
My life has changed in many ways
I'm such a different man
Well i know now who my father is
And i know just where i stand
With one foot up in Heaven
And one foot on the ground
I travel through this world of ours
I try to spread God's word around
I was born to be unlucky (i know'd it)
From my shoulders to my shoes
But i came unstuck from my unlucky blues
Yea
Ow and maybe you can too...alright
