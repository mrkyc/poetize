Please help me find my hat
It's time that i was leaving
Got no time for looking back
I'm going away yeah
Feeling fine
When its time to go
You gotta leave the past behind
When i look outside my window
It's as dark as it can be
But I know the Son is coming
To wake the world from sleep
I'm going away going away
Feeling fine and when you follow where He leads
You've got to leave the past behind

People wishing for good news

There is one thing you must do
