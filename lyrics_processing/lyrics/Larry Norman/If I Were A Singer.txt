And my pen would point out all the things you're made of
And the only thing that I could sing would be love
If I were a planet or better yet a star
I would try to show the Universe who you are
I would take my place among some constellation
I'd be visible from every observation
I'd be a sign among the heavens to each nation
And overwhelm the wise men with the wonder of creation
These are troubled days, I want to live my life in a special way
These are troubled days
I want to live my life for you and point the way
If I were the blue sky, all my winds would blow for you
I would storm upon the night to show your power
I would rage upon the earth with heavy showers
Hurricane upon all men to make them cower
Make them watch me 'til that unexpected hour
When you come again from heaven's loft tower
These are troubled days
I want to live my life in a special way
These are troubled days
I want to live my life for you and point the way
You might also likeIf I were a singer, I'd sing my song for you
And my pen would point out all the things you're made of
And the only thing that I could sing would be love
I would sing 'til the faithless ones received it
Until the children of your wayward church believed it
I would sing it to the governments and leaders
And to the writers who have misled all the readers
I would sing it though they jailed me and they killed me
Let them empty me of life, for you have filled me
These are troubled days, I want to live my life in a special way
These are troubled days
