You know it came as some surprise, it wasn't in the
Plan
She never told me nothing was wrong, she didn't give me
A clue
But one morning there was a knock on the door
And I found out we were through
I saw my future fading and with the papers in my hand
I found myself transported into this desert land
My feet are burning, the hour is getting late
My journey is much too long and time will not wait
So Heavenly Father, thou who all doth see
You let the rain fall down on the good and the bad
So let the rain fall down on me
As through this life you ramble and through this world
You roam
You might live in a lot of places and never find your
Home
As down the road you wander and through the open fields
You cross
You must never stop believing for all is not lost
And don't worry 'bout the unfaithful lover and false
Friend
For the love that you have given is what matters in the
End
So Heavenly Father, thou who all doth see
You let the rain fall down on the good and the bad
So let the rain fall down on me
Life is complicated, very hard to live
I try to turn my cheek to everything my enemies give
I've got a lot of compassion for the sinners and the
Slaves
I've got a message for those not in their graves
He will cover you with water and baptize your pain
If you let his power wash you clean and soothe your
Fevered brain
So Heavenly Father, help me thine to be
You let the rain fall down on the quick and the dead
So let the rain fall down on me
I didn't know you were my father
I thought you were the hanging judge
And when I came into your courtroom
I thought you'd hold a grudge
I thought I was a lowly servant
I didn't know I was your son
And I didn't know you had forgiveness
For anything I might have done
This world is crumbling, your kingdom is at hand
Give me the strength to live and help me to stand
There's gonna be a collision, the world is going fast
A mortgaged future meets a bankrupt past
A change is coming and people slumber in their bed
Storm clouds are bringing rain and the moon is turning
Red
Heavenly Father, thou who all doth see
You let the rain fall down on the quick and the dead
So let the rain fall down on me
Let this good life be the life we lead
Let our faith grow like a mustard seed
Let his love be all the love we need
