If I die, better live again
Read it black 4-5, that's him again
4+5 that's 9, that's born, that's G-O-D
But he raps that's him again
Why do I need to explain to you lames
I don't play by your rules, I invented my game
And my brain is a pool, I reflected the pain
Call me Michael 'cause I resurrected the fame
And I did it by being the realest
My claim to the crown doesn't need your acceptance
You need to respect it, and here come the weapons
So here come the weapons, here come the waaah!
Until you have they all think
Is he a buddhist, a gangsta, a king
Is he DC, is he New York, Miami or is there a place that he even can't claim
Is he a hustler, a pimp or a god
Is he a teacher, a scholar, a fraud
Maybe I'm king of all kings and by doing my thing
I'm telling you reach for the stars
Look
All white-Lamborghini
Black Sinatra-Those cameras see me
This is Supreme Mathematics
It says a whole lot if you can understand it
'Cause

When I die-Imma live again
All black 4-5 that's him again
B-O-R-N-I-N-F-I-N-I-T-E
Imma live again

Black Robin Hood from the rich, I don't rob from the rich
I just mod like this shit is my job
While I give to the poor, like the ship to the shore
If you knew how it felt, you would give it up more
Industry people disgust me, they say say that they love
They say that they want me, but if there's no budget
They say that they can't touch me-why?
Roll a nice homie and touch the sky
Fuck the pride
Dipping and stealing, I split it back open, I really don't give a fuck
This is what happens to bitches and bastards
Who wanna be bosses, but not even captains
The fact of the matter I'm battling actors
Who can't even stand in my shadow
My path is the vision of Gandhi 
Ran with the llamas and swam with piranhas
Studied the bible , fuck who I saw watching my sins
I just bolt from the sky to ignite you
What do I have to prove
Never considered my path would lose
I am the son, i am the storm
They called me infinite when I was born
This is La Cosa Nostra, our thing
I don't need a court to tell me I'm king
