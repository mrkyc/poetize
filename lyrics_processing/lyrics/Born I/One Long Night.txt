The Tide is rolling in, do I sink or swim?
The choices seem few and time is on the move
The waves come crashing in
Take a deep breath, hold it in
All my tears of yesterday are washed away
Tomorrow is rushing my way
Tomorrow is rushing my way

These hardships come all at once
But I gotta stay strong
It's coming down to the wire
I know I'll make it through
Alright, alright
I know I'll make it through this night

I know I'll make it through this night
I know I'll make it through this night

I've been sitting for a long time thinking
The eyes on the blade in my wrist not blinking
Somewhere in my heart I know that this will be a long fight
Looking at the clock, I know that this would be a long night
Only time will tell if I'ma make it to the other side
I don't want to live but I don't want to see my mother cry
Trapped inside the darkness, hope I can find the love inside
Enough for me to come out of this sad cocoon, a butterfly
I wonder why all that I feel is the negative, positive thoughts can I let it live
Maybe I'm one of those special kids, no, I don't need no more sedatives
What would it do to my mama?, if she found me dead in my room on the carpet
All of these voices, I'm trying to stop it, all of these choices I'm trying to solve it
Yeah, The night is dark and full of terrors
If life is just a joke then I'm the comedy of errors
Maybe I can turn my pain to wisdom, live a long life
But first I have to see if I can make it through this long night

These hardships come all at once
But I gotta stay strong
It's coming down to the wire
I know I'll make it through
Alright, alright
