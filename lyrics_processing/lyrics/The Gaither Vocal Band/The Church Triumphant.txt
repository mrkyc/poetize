Let the Church be the Church
Let the people rejoice
For we've settled the question
We've made our choice
Let the anthems ring out, songs of victory swell
For the church triumphant, is alive and well

You know, this ship's been through battles before
The storms and the tempests and all the rocks on the shore
Though the hull may be battered
Inside it's safe and dry
It's gonna carry its cargo to the port in the sky

God has always had a people. Many a foolish conqueror has made the mistake of thinking that because he had forced the church of Jesus Christ out of site, he had stilled its voice and snuffed out its life, but God has always had a people. The powerful current of a rushing river is not diminished because it's forced to flow underground. Now the purest water is the stream that burst crystal clear into the sunlight after it has forced its way through solid rock. There have been  who like Simon The Magician sought to barter on the open market that power which cannot be bought or sold, but God has always had a people. Men who could not be bought and women who were beyond purchase. God has always had a people. There have been times of affluence and prosperity when the church's message has been nearly deluded into oblivion by those who sought to make it socially attractive, neatly organized, financially profitable, but God has always had a people. Yes it's been gold platted, draped in purple and encrusted with jewels. It has been misrepresented, ridiculed, lauded and scorned but God has always had a people. And these followers of Jesus Christ have been, according to the whim of the times, elevated sacred leaders and modern heretics. Yet through it all, their march is on that powerful army of the meek. God's chosen people who cannot be bought, blabbered, murdered or stilled. On through the ages they march, the church! God's church triumphant!
