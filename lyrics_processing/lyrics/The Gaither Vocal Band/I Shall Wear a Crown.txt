When the Lord shall call your soul away
If you labor, strivin' for the right
You shall wear a robe and crown. (2x)
I shall wear a crown (2x)
When the trumpet sounds (2x)
I'm gonna wear a crown
I shall wear a crown

Soon as my feet strike Zion
Lay down my heavy burden
Gonna put on my robe in glory
Shout and tell Him my story
Soon as I can see Jesus
Tell Him all about my trouble
Put on my robe in glory
Shout and tell Him my story
Soon as my feet strike Zion
Lay down my heavy burden
Put on my robe in glory
Shout and tell Him my story
Soon as I can see Jesus
Tell Him all about my trouble
Put on my robe in glory
Shout, shout, tell Him my story
I shall wear a robe and crown
