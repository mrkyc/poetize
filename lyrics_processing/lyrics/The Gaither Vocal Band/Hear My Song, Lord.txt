Hear my song Lord, You fill me with music
Hear my words Lord, You fill me with praise
Take this moment, I just can't waste it
This one is Yours Lord, I give You this day

When am hungry, You feed me living bread
When I am thirsty, Water of life
I wil not fear, You are always with me
Every need I have, You satisfy

Hear my song Lord, You fill me with music
Hear my words Lord, You fill me with praise
Take this moment (Oh-oh), I just can't waste it (I just can't waste it)
This one is Yours Lord (I give You), I give You this day

Hear Your children, Oh Lord we are lifting our praise to You
Let singing like incense now, rise to Your throne
Come dwell in the place hollowed out, for Your Spirit
Come make of our praises, Your temple, Your home (Hear my song Lord)

Hear my song Lord, You fill me with music
(Hear Your children, Oh Lord we are lifting our praise to You)
Hear my words Lord, You fill me with praise
(Let singing like incense now, rise to Your throne)
Let it rise, let it rise
Take this moment, I just can't waste it
(Come dwell in the place hollowed out, for Your Spirit)
This one is Yours Lord, I give You this day
(Come make of our praises, Your temple, Your home)
Ooh
Hear my song Lord (Hear my song), You fill me with music (You fill me with music)
(Hear Your children, Oh Lord we are lifting our praise to You)
Hear my words Lord, You fill me with praise
(Let singing like incense now, rise to Your throne)
Take this moment, I just can't waste it
(Come dwell in the place hollowed out, for Your Spirit)
This one is Yours Lord, I give You this day
