Alright, 1, 2; 1, 2, 3
Late last night I was watchin' the tube
When I saw the most incredible thing
They built a new mechanical man
Looked just like a human being
I started to become terrified
Good God it was makin' me sick
And then I began to realize
It was no one but Tricky Dick
Yes, it was Tricky Dicky from Yorba Linda
Hip hip hip hurrah
Tricky Dicky from Yorba Linda
Hip hip hip hurrah
He walks and he talks, he smiles, he frowns
He does what a human can
It was Tricky Dicky from Yorba Linda
The genuine plastic man
There is no can't in American
Or so we once could say
But now our boys won't fight no more
To bring us victory
Where are the mountain majesties
Above the fruited plains ?
Who will come to lead us
In our hour of pain ?
Why it's Tricky Dicky from Yorba Linda
Hip hip hip hurrah
It's Tricky Dicky from Yorba Linda
Hip hip hip hurrah
He walks and he talks, he smiles, he frowns
He does what a human can
He's Tricky Dicky from Yorba Linda
The genuine plastic man, hey!
Oh my God, it's terrible
Here in the U.S.A
The water's polluted, the economy's crashing
And can someone save the day ?
The war keeps going on and on
And the kids won't respect the cops
It's even said that God is dead
When will it ever stop ?
Hey, it's Tricky Dicky from Yorba Linda
Hip hip hip hurrah
Tricky Dicky from Yorba Linda
Hip hip hip hurrah
He walks, he talks, he smiles, he frowns
He does what a human can
He's Tricky Dicky from Yorba Linda
The genuine plastic man
And across the garbaged highways
From the oil-drenched plains
Now we'll see a victory
America shall rise again
Past the word that the buffalo heard
To the home of the free and the brave
He's Tricky Dicky from Yorba Linda
Hip hip hip hurrah
Well, it's Tricky Dicky from Yorba Linda
Hip hip hip hurrah
Tricky Dicky from Yorba Linda
Hip hip hip hurrah
He walks, he talks, he smiles, he frowns
He does what a human can
He's Tricky Dicky from Yorba Linda
The genuine plastic man, oh yeah
He's the genuine plastic man, oh yeah
