Oh this is, this is just a try out. It's not ...
'Fixin'-To-Die-Rag', 'Fixin'-To-Die-Rag', Take 1
One, two, three, four
Well, come on all of you, big strong men
Uncle Sam needs your help again
Yeah, he's got himself in a terrible jam
Way down yonder in Vietnam
So put down your books and pick up a gun
Gonna have a whole lotta fun
And it's one, two, three
What are we fighting for ?
Don't ask me, I don't give a damn
Next stop is Vietnam;
And it's five, six, seven
Open up the pearly gates
Well there ain't no time to wonder why
Whoopee! we're all gonna die
Yeah, come on Wall Street, don't be slow
Why man, this is war au-go-go
There's plenty good money to be made
By supplying the Army with the tools of its trade
Just hope and pray that if they drop the bomb
They drop it on the Viet Cong
And it's one, two, three
What are we fighting for ?
Don't ask me, I don't give a damn
Next stop is Vietnam
And it's five, six, seven
Open up the pearly gates
Well there ain't no time to wonder why
Whoopee! we're all gonna die
Well, come on generals, let's move fast;
Your big chance has come at last
Now you can go out and get those reds
'Cause the only good commie is the one that's dead
And you know that peace can only be won
When we've blown 'em all to kingdom come
And it's one, two, three
What are we fighting for ?
Don't ask me, I don't give a damn
Next stop is Vietnam;
And it's five, six, seven
Open up the pearly gates
Well there ain't no time to wonder why
Whoopee! we're all gonna die
Come on mothers throughout the land
Pack your boys off to Vietnam
Come on fathers, and don't hesitate
To send your sons off before it's too late
You can be the first ones in your block
To have your boy come home in a box
And it's one, two, three
What are we fighting for ?
Don't ask me, I don't give a damn
Next stop is Vietnam
And it's five, six, seven
Open up the pearly gates
Well there ain't no time to wonder why
