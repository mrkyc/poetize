Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Picked up a hitchhiker the other day
He said he wasn't going far
He looked so strange I couldn't help myself
I asked, "Please, tell me who you are."
He smiled politely and lit a cigarette
The smoke seemed to cast a spell
What happened next I don't understand
Yet it was so strange I can hardly tell
He said, hold on it's coming Hold on it's coming
He said, hold on it's very near Hold on it's near
He said, hold on it's coming Hold on it's coming
He said, hold on it's almost here.Hold on it's almost here
My mind seemed to spin and my hands began to tremble
I began talking in tongues
I looked over and his eyes seemed to glow
It was like looking at the sun
I told him everything in just a few moments
As if we had stopped time
I felt the great light just as if I were floating
It was truly blowing my mind
He said, hold on it's coming Hold on it's coming
He said, hold on it's very near It's very near
He said, hold on it's coming Oh, hold on it's coming
He said, hold on it's almost here.Hold on it's almost here
And then I was suddenly a child again
Holding my father's hand
And I watched it from the beginning
As I grew from child to man
My friends all came and gathered round me once more
We undid what was done
And when it was over I was driving down the road
I looked around and he was gone
He said, hold on it's coming Hold on it's coming
He said, hold on it's very near Hold on it's almost here
He said, hold on it's coming Hold on it's coming
He said, hold on it's almost here.Hold on it's very near
He said, hold on it's coming Yeah, it's coming
He said, hold on it's very near Hold on it's very near
He said, hold on it's coming Hold on it's coming
