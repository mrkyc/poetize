I got out of school and I was feeling kinda down
I thought I'd join the Army just to take a look around
I went on down to the recruiter man
And that's when all my troubles began
Well, I've been up, down and around
This country more than a couple of times
But I never knew until I got into the Army
That thinking for yourself was a crime
Get over here, stand over there
Let's see your identification
Shut your mouth, son, get back in line
We're sending you to South East Asia
Well, they gave me some shoes that hurt my feet
They gave me some food not fit to eat
They told me that I wasn't fighting alone
They sent me to Saigon and they stayed home
Well, I've been up, down and around
This country more than a couple of times
But I never knew until I got into the Army
That thinking for yourself was a crime
Get over here, stand over there
Let's see your identification
Shut your mouth, son, get back in line
We're sending you to South East Asia
All right
One, two, three, four
We don't want your fuckin' war
A, B, C, D
Get someone else, hey don't get me
Left, right, left, right
You know the whole damn thing puts me uptight
I done my duty and I fought my fight
And I thought I knew I was doing right
But that's all over, I'm free at last
An' if they want any more, they can kiss my ass
'Cause I've been up and down and around
This country more than a couple of times
But I never knew until I got into the Army
That thinking for yourself was a crime
Get over here, stand over there
Let's see your identification
Shut your mouth, son, get back in line
