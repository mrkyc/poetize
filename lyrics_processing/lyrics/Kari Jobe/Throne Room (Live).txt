You rendered heaven
The veil was torn in two
It gave us Your Spirit
Now we are close, closer than we think
Creation is groaning
Longing for the unseen
Here in this moment
Eternity's close, closer than we think

What are they singing?
What is it like?
You are surrounded with thunder and light
Everything in us
The longing, the ache
To join with the heavens
The anthem of praise

Holy
Holy
Holy
Holy

The train of His robe
Filling the temple
The elders and angels
All bowing down, casting their crowns
The Lamb who was slain
You are the risen King
Jesus, our Savior
Alpha Omega, end to beginning
You might also like
Lion of Judah, the One on the throne
The only One worthy to open the scrolls
You split the heavens and come for Your Bride
Fulfill all Your promise, with fire in Your eye

Holy

Holy
Holy

Ooh
Ooh

Blessing and honor, and glory and power
Belong to You alone
Blessing and honor, and glory and power
Belong to You, belong to You
Blessing and honor, and glory and power
Belong to You alone
Blessing and honor, and glory and power
Belong to You, belong to You
Blessing and honor, and glory and power
Belong to You alone
Blessing and honor, and glory and power
Belong to You, belong to You
Blessing and honor, and glory and power
Belong to You alone
Blessing and honor, and glory and power
Belong to You, belong to You

What are they singing?
What is it like?
You are surrounded with thunder and light
Everything in us
The longing, the ache
To join with the heavens
The anthem of praise
What are they singing?
What is it like?
You are surrounded with thunder and light
Everything in us
The longing, the ache
To join with the heavens
The anthem of praise
