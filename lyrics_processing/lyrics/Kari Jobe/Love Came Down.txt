If my heart is overwhelmed
And I cannot hear Your voice
I hold on to what is true
Though I cannot see

If the storms of life they come
And the road ahead gets steep
I will lift these hands in faith
I will believe

I remind myself
Of all that You've done
And the life I have
Because of Your son

Love came down and rescued me
Love came down and set me free
I am Yours, I am forever Yours
Mountains high or valley low
I sing out and remind my soul
I am Yours, I am forever Yours
When my heart is filled with hope
Every promise comes my way
When I feel Your hands of grace
Rest upon me

Staying desperate for You, God
Staying humble at Your feet
I will lift these hands in praise
I will believe

I remind myself
Of all that You've done
And the life I have
Because of Your son

Love came down and rescued me
Love came down and set me free
I am Yours, I am forever Yours
Mountains high or valley low
I sing out and remind my soul
I am Yours, I am forever Yours
I am Yours, I am Yours
All my days, Jesus, I am Yours
I am Yours, I am Yours
All my days, Jesus, I am Yours

Love came down and rescued me
Love came down and set me free
I am Yours, I am forever Yours
Mountains high or valley low
I sing out and remind my soul
I am Yours, I am forever Yours
Love came down and rescued me
Love came down and set me free
I am Yours, I am forever Yours
Mountains high or valley low
I sing out and remind my soul
I am Yours, I am forever Yours

Yeah, I am yours,
I am yours, I am yours
