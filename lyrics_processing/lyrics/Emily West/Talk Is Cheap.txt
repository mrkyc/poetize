You were everything except mine
And I had to have you
And I'll never really get why
I can't afford to
Hold you in my arms so tight
Didn't know the price was so high
Guess I never really wanted to abide

Cause I know you cost too much
And you never spend enough on me
I love you is all I want
I'm learning that talk is cheap
Put your money where your mouth is baby
Cause nothing is ever as it seems
Forgive and take, it drives me crazy
I'm learning that talk is cheap

My heart's been telling little white lies
To my head, to my head
Erasing all the little goodbyes
That you said, that you said
Now I'm one of those wasting girls
Cashing out of your wasting world
And all the love I gave to you
It's all gone, it's all gone
You might also like
Cause I know you cost too much
And you never spend enough on me
I love you is all I want
I'm learning that talk is cheap
Put your money where your mouth is baby
Cause nothing is ever as it seems
Forgive and take, it drives me crazy
I'm learning that talk is cheap

Talk is cheap
Talk is cheap
Talk is cheap
Talk is cheap
I love you is all I want
I'm learning that talk is cheap

Put your money where your mouth is baby
Cause nothing is ever as it seems
Forgive and take, it drives me crazy
I'm learning that talk is cheap
Cause I know you cost too much
And you never spend enough on me
I love you is all I want
I'm learning that talk is cheap
Put your money where your mouth is baby
Cause nothing is ever as it seems
Forgive and take, it drives me crazy
