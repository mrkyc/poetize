So this is love
So this is pain
I'm too tired to be brave
As hard as you fall
That's how you break
Over and over and over until it's too late
The battle was over, the blood never dried
The gate was left open, and so were my eyes

Bitter
Yeah that's me these days
I bit and I kick and I hiss and I scratch like a lion in a cage
Bitter
And the feeling's so strange
I like him I love him I hate him for making the mess that he made
I'm giving up what I used to love can't I can't stand the taste

Heart full of rain
But I'm still on fire
I'm so sick of desire
The more that I try
The less I forget
The shape of his body asleep in my bed
You might also likeThe bells they were rung out, I said my goodbyes
And now I'm just run down, I won't cry cause I'm

Bitter
Yeah that's me these days
I bit and I kick and I hiss and I scratch like a lion in a cage
Bitter
And the feeling's so strange
I like him I love him I hate him for making the mess that he made
I'm giving up what I used to love can't I can't stand the taste

Where do we go
Nobody knows, got nothing to show for wasting my time
No wonder I'm
Bitter
Yeah that's me these days
I bit and I kick and I hiss and I scratch like a lion in a cage
Bitter
And the feeling's so strange
I like him I love him I hate him for making the mess that he made

Bitter
Yeah that's me these days
I bit and I kick and I hiss and I scratch like a lion in a cage
Bitter
And the feeling's so strange
I like him I love him I hate him for making the mess that he made
