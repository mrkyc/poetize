I thought the lack of oxygen meant love was here to stay
Now those butterflies just make my tummy ache
And that flutter in my chest ain't nothin but heartache
That sinkin bubble is full of hot air and trouble
And I dont need that kind of happy
The kind that takes you up and brings you down
And I dont need that kind of sunshine
The kind that alway shows up with a cloud
I dont need love that leaves you cryin, like I did before
Im so happy I dont need that kind of happy anymore
There was a time when love swept me off my feet
I never thought Id have to come to grips with gravity
Now fallin in love is still the sweet crazy thing to do
But when I take that leap again Ill have a pair of shoes
You can't call it fallin when youre on your knees crawlin
And I dont need that kind of happy
The kind that takes you up and brings you down
And I dont need that kind of sunshine
The kind that alway shows up with a cloud
I dont need love that leaves you cryin, like I did before
Im so happy I dont need that kind of happy anymore
You might also likeJust when I thought love might be
Nothin more than a, a bright sunny light
Oh, baby, with every kiss you remind me
Whoooo, I dont need that kind of happy
The kind that takes you up and brings you down
Whoo, hoooo, I dont need that kind of sunshine
The kind that alway, always shows up with a cloud
I dont need love that leaves you cryin, like I did before
Im so happy I dont need that kind of happy
Im so happy I dont need that kind of happy
