The whole world is falling apart
Feels like The Wizard of Oz
So I hide away
With the one thing I love
To sing for the trees
And the birds, and the bees
And the light that shines inside of me
I count my change in this jar
Sleep in my broken down car
Question reality
Can't help but dream
Of Carnegie Hall, the Chancellors Ball
And the day they open their arms to me

But I don't sing my songs
In hundred story buildings
For dying men in businesses
With vacant black hole hearts
Signing the next star
Cause I won't go on stage
Lit up on amphetamines
Singing ripped off melodies
While I fall apart
I'm a one woman show
And I wasn't made for the radio
You might also like
If I take my clothes off to dance
Will you pay attention to me
If I'm mediocre
And way out of tune
Will I shine like a star, or a tramp in a bar
Like a freak show played out masterpiece

But I don't sing my songs
In hundred story buildings
For dying men in businesses
With vacant black hole hearts
Signing the next star
And I won't go on stage
Lit up on amphetamines
Singing ripped off melodies
While I fall apart
I'm a one woman show
And I wasn't made for the radio

In a world of connection
We're so damn disconnected
We're so far apart
Oh I miss enjoying
Bernstein and Stevie
And all those works of art
But I don't sing my songs
In hundred story buildings
For dying men in businesses
With vacant black hole hearts
Selling the next star
Cause I won't go on stage
Lit up on amphetamines
Singing ripped off melodies
While I fall apart
I'm a one woman show
