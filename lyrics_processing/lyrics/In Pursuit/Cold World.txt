Such a cold, cold world
But it's warm inside your love
When I'm closer to the heart
There's a man on the corner
He just sits in a daze
Waiting and waiting
He don't care anymore
I've been thinking of reasons
Could it all be that bad?
Over and over
I'm remembering you
Baby, it's a cold, cold world
Such a cold, cold world
But it's warm inside your love
When I'm closer to the heart
When I'm out in the traffic
And I'm moving too slow
Longer and longer
I'm remembering you
Something I can't live without
Something I can't live without
Something I can't live without
Something I can't live without
Something I can't live without
Something I can't live without
Something I can't live without
Something I can't live without
