Coming in close I heard a voice
From somewhere far away in the distance
Somebody out there shelter me
No one really knows just what it says
But we all know it's gotta mean somethin'
Somebody out there shelter me
Are you with me 'til the mornin' comes?
Are you with me 'til the mornin' comes?
Standin' in your shadow
Are you with me?
Standin' in your shadow
Are you with me?
You know you've gotta break down the walls
To get in the room that holds all the answers
Somebody out there shelter me
You never tried to realize that there was
Somethin' out there and you might have been missing it
Somebody out there shelter me
Are you with me 'til the new day comes?
Are you with me 'til the new day comes?
