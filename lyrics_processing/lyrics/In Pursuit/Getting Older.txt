Another word that you say
'Cause when you told you're leavin'
You take my world away
Morning's on its way
And the night can turn to day
But when you say you're leavin'
You're throwin' it all away
Moments passin' by
And we're getting older
(Hey, we're gettin' a little older)
(Hey, we're gettin' a little older)
So much older
(Hey, we're gettin' a little older)
(Hey, we're gettin' a little older)
We're getting older
(Hey, we're gettin' a little older)
(Hey, we're gettin' a little older)
So much older
(Hey, we're gettin' a little older)
(Hey, we're gettin' a little older)
I just wanna know
If what you say is true
'Cause I can't live without you
Not another single day
You might also likeAnd as the time goes by
Time to laugh and cry
I'll still think about you
And I will be around
Moments passin' by
We're getting older
(Hey, we're gettin' a little older)
(Hey, we're gettin' a little older)
So much older
(Hey, we're gettin' a little older)
(Hey, we're gettin' a little older)
We're getting older
(Hey, we're gettin' a little older)
(Hey, we're gettin' a little older)
So much older
(Hey, we're gettin' a little older)
(Hey, we're gettin' a little older)
Time, take my wounds away
Make me stronger every day
Make me stronger all the way
We're getting older
(Hey, we're gettin' a little older)
(Hey, we're gettin' a little older)
So much older
(Hey, we're gettin' a little older)
(Hey, we're gettin' a little older)
We're getting older
(Hey, we're gettin' a little older)
(Hey, we're gettin' a little older)
So much older
(Hey, we're gettin' a little older)
(Hey, we're gettin' a little older)
Getting older
(Hey, we're gettin' a little older)
(Hey, we're gettin' a little older)
So much older
(Hey, we're gettin' a little older)
(Hey, we're gettin' a little older)
We're getting older
(Hey, we're gettin' a little older)
(Hey, we're gettin' a little older)
So much older
(Hey, we're gettin' a little older)
