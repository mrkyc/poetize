You make me feel good
You make me feel good
What everybody tells me
I'm gonna ruin the day
But I'm just too hung on you baby
To stay away
Maybe I'm in love and that shouldn't be
Maybe I don't know what's good for me
But when you raise your eyes and look that look
I wanna rip out all the pages in my love book
All I wanna do is be with you
You make me feel good
All I wanna see is you with me
You make me feel good
Well I can hear a whisper
When we go by
What's a nice girl sweet girl like her
Doing with that guy
Hey, hey
Let them talk all day if they want to
That's not gonna change what I feel for you
Cause when you pull me close and kiss that kiss
I feel like I've been hit by a ton of brick
