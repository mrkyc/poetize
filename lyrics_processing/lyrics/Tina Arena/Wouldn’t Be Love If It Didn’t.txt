I see it in your eyes
You've been hurt about a thousand times
And I know it 'cause I felt it too
It goes over in your mind
But those damn worries are a waste of time
And I know it 'cause I worry too

I don't have all of the answers yet
Why don't you hold my hand
We can jump off the edge

We may fall, we may fly
It may burn you and I
We might crash into the ground
Or we might walk among the clouds
Take our chances, take our time
We may stumble, we may climb
I could say you won't get hurt
But who am I kidding?
It wouldn't be love if it didn't

Can't cover up your scars
But I'll do everything to fix your heart
So don't fight it, what's left to lose
You might also like
I don't have all of the answers yet
While don't you hold my hand
We can jump off the edge

We may fall, we may fly
It may burn you and I
We might crash into the ground
Or we might walk among the clouds
Take our chances, take our time
We may stumble, we may climb
I could say you won't get hurt
But who am I kidding?
It wouldn't be love if it didn't

It wouldn't be love if it didn't
It wouldn't be love if it didn't
It wouldn't be love if it didn't

We may fall, we may fly
It may burn you and I
We might crash into the ground
Or we might walk among the clouds
Take our chances, take our time
We may stumble, we may climb
I could say you won't get hurt
But who am I kidding?
It wouldn't be love if it didn't
We may fall, we may fly
It may burn you and I
We might crash into the ground
Or we might walk among the clouds
Take our chances, take our time
We may stumble, we may climb
I could say you won't get hurt
But who am I kidding?
