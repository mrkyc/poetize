Falling in love with you is coming home
You're always there although I'm mostly gone
You took my hand and then you let me leave
You said
"Go light up the room" and so that what's I did
"Light up the room" and so that what's I did
Every time I call you lost and down
It's in your voice I find hallowed ground
You say you love me like the wall surrounds
It makes me light up the room like I've just been found
Light up the room like I've just been found

You set fire to my life
Oh oh oh oh oh
And the feeling remains forever young
Oh oh oh oh oh
Whether you feel the same
When I'm older, I'm living the moment
If everything was gone tomorrow
You set fire to my life
You set fire to my life now

I want to tell you but it's not enough
You gave me freedom for the two of us
It's so easy to let go these days
A love like this I know we're here to stay
I wouldn't have it any other way
You might also like
You set fire to my life
Oh oh oh oh oh
And the feeling remains forever young
Oh oh oh oh oh
Whether you feel the same
When I'm older, I'm living the moment
If everything was gone tomorrow
You set fire to my life
You set fire to my life now

Let the rain fall down
Down, down, down
Let the fire burn all around you and me

You set fire to my life
Oh oh oh oh oh
And the feeling remains forever young
Oh oh oh oh oh
Whether you feel the same
When I'm older, I'm living the moment
If everything was gone tomorrow
You set fire to my life
You set fire to my life now
Every time I called you lost and down
