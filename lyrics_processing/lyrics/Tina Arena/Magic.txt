Is there something on your skin
Or something in my tree
That's getting me so high
Is this something in your stare
Or something in the air
That's making this so right

You stay with me
Don't let it slip
Away from me

'Cause when the sun goes down
And the stars come out
We can raise our glass
'Cause we made it
And when there's you and I
If we hold on tight
We can play this out like a classic
So please don't kill the magic
No, please don't kill the magic
'Cause all we have is magic

Like heaven on your lips
Your smoke that I breathe in
It's taken me over
Like whisky and water
Like mother and daughter
We couldn't be closer
You might also like
Stay with me
Don't let it slip
Away from me

'Cause when the sun goes down
And the stars come out
We can raise our glass
'Cause we made it
And when there's you and I
If we hold on tight
We can play this out like a classic
So please don't kill the magic
Yeah
No, please don't kill the magic
Yeah
Please don't kill the magic
The magic
The magic
No, please don't kill the magic

'Cause when the sun goes down
And the stars come out
We can raise our glass
'Cause we made it
And when there's you and I
If we hold on tight
We can play this out like a classic
So please don't kill the magic
Please don't kill the magic
Eh
'Cause all we have is magic
And magic, and magic
Please don't kill the magic
No, please don't kill the magic
Please don't kill the magic
Eh
'Cause all we have is magic
And magic, and magic
Please don't kill the magic
'Cause when the sun goes down
And the stars come out
We can raise our glass
'Cause we made it
And when it's you and I
If we hold on tight
We can play this out like a classic
Please don't kill the magic
