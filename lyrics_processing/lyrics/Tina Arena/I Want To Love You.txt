You see the same sun in the sky
We see the same stars every night
I wanna be there in the dark when your world falls apart
I wanna break through every wall
Just to show you I am yours
And take a chance on you again
You are my everything

For you, I dream of who I could be
I'd write a thousand symphonies
I'd lose it all to get you back
You are everything

I wanna love you but my head says no
I wanna kiss you but I don't come close
I wanna tell you that I love you so
I'm doing it all for your love
But I know that it's never enough
Oh no it's never enough, never enough

Living in between the lights
Missing you before we say goodbye
It's you I love the most
But are we chasing ghosts
When I go to sleep at night, I wanna feel you by my side
For you, I'd bleed, I'd die to see you and I open my eyes
You might also like
For you, I dream of who I could be
I'd write a thousand symphonies
I'd lose it all to get you back
You are everything

I wanna love you but my head says no
I wanna kiss you but I don't come close
I wanna tell you that I love you so
I'm doing it all for your love
But I know that it's never enough
Oh no it's never enough, never enough

How long must I wait
How long must I wait for you, I wait for you
How long must I wait
How long must I wait for you, I wait for you

I wanna love you but my head says no
I wanna kiss you but I don't come close
I wanna tell you that I love you so
I'm doing it all for your love
But I know that it's never enough
