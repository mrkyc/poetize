And he's leaving now
In the pouring rain
A broken hearted child is watching him
Through the window pane
These are the images that
Frighten me away
Another grown up game
That I could not play
Thought only pain could come from loving you
But that was yesterday
I wanna live with you
Every single day and night
I think of you
I wanna live with you
Just say the word and I'll do
What you want me to
Now it's the summer of the burning sand
Why do I feel so cold
Every time a woman
Leaves a man
It makes me feel so old
I tried so hard to fight the
Longing in the night
All most convinced myself that
I would be alright
But in the end the wall came tumbling down
In need you in my life
My life
You might also likeI wanna live with you
Every single day and night
I think of you
I wanna live with you
Just say the word and I'll do
What you want me to ooh
If love means anything
Then you'll know this is all I can do
Cast my fate to the wind
To live with you
I wanna live with you
I tried so hard to fight the
Longing in the night
All most convinced myself that
I would be alright
But in the end the walls came tumbling down
I need you in my life
My life
I wanna live with you
Every single day and night I think of you
I wanna live with you
Just say the word and I'll do
What you want me to
I wanna live with you baby
Day and night I think of you
I wanna live with you
Say the world and I'll do what you want me to
Ooh I wanna live with you baby
