I'd like to can all my troubles in fruit jars on a cedar shelf
Pack up the car and my guitar and promise I will laugh at myself

I'm gonna slow this whole thing down
On this not so merry go round

'Cause I need a river in a real bad way
Out of sight and out of town I go
Take to the giver this heavy heart of clay
And I'll swing on the vine
Letting go I know I'll find
That I am falling into grace
I need a river, I need a river in a real bad way

Baby you can come too if you promise to be lighter than air
No tangles or distractions except the wild flowers in my hair
You can come up close to me
'Cause you know I know what you need yeah

You need a river in a real bad way
Out of sight and out of town you go
Take to the giver your heavy heart of clay
And you'll swing on the vine
Letting go I know you'll find
That you are falling into grace
You need a river, you need a river in a real bad way

Oh I love, I love this place

I need a river, yeah I need a river in a real bad way
