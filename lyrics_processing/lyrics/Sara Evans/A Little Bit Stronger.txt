Woke up late today and I
Still feel the sting of the pain, but I
Brush my teeth anyway
I got dressed through the mess and put a smile on my face
I got a little bit stronger

Ridin' in the car to work and I'm
Tryin' to ignore the hurt, so I
Turned on the radio
Stupid song made me think of you
I listened to it for a minute
But then I changed it
I'm gettin' a little bit stronger
Just a little bit stronger

And I'm done hopin'
That we could work it out
I'm done with how it feels, spinnin' my wheels
Lettin' you drag my heart around, and oh
And I'm done thinkin'
That you could ever change
I know my heart will never be the same
But I'm tellin' myself I'll be okay
Even on my weakest days
I get a little bit stronger

It doesn't happen overnight, but you
Turn around and a month's gone by and you
Realize you haven't cried
I'm not givin' you an hour or a second or another minute longer
I'm busy gettin' stronger

And I'm done hopin'
That we could work it out
I'm done with how it feels, spinnin' my wheels
Lettin' you drag my heart around, and oh
And I'm done thinkin'
That you could ever change
I know my heart will never be the same
But I'm tellin' myself I'll be okay
Even on my weakest days
I get a little bit stronger
I get a little bit stronger

Gettin' along without you, baby
I'm better off without you, baby
How does it feel without me, baby?
I'm gettin' stronger without you, baby
And I'm done hopin'
We could work it out
I'm done with how it feels spinnin' my wheels
And lettin' you drag my heart around, and oh
And I'm done thinkin'
That you could ever change
I know my heart will never be the same
But I'm tellin' myself I'll be okay
Even on my weakest days
I get a little bit stronger
I get a little bit stronger

I'm just a little bit stronger
(Hey, yeah) A little bit
(Hey, yeah) A little bit
A little bit stronger
(Hey, yeah)
(Hey, yeah) I'm gettin' a little bit stronger
