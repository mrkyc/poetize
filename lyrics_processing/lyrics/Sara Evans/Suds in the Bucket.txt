She was in the backyard
Say it was a little past nine
When her prince pulled up
A white pick-up truck
Her folks shoulda seen it coming
It was only just a matter of time
Plenty old enough, and you can't stop love
She stuck a note on the screen door
"Sorry, but I got to go"
And that was all she wrote
Her mama's heart was broke
And that was all she wrote
Or so the story goes

Now her daddy's in the kitchen
Starin' out the window
Scratchin' and a-rackin' his brains
How could eighteen years just up and walk away?
Our little pony-tailed girl, grown up to be a woman
Now she's gone in the blink of an eye
She left the suds in the bucket
And the clothes hangin' out on the line

Now, don't you wonder
What the preacher's gonna preach about Sunday mornin'?
Nothing quite like this
Has happened here before
Well, he must have been a looker
A smooth talkin' son of a gun
For such a grounded girl
To just up and run
'Course you can't fence time
And you can't stop love

Now all the biddies in the beauty shop
Gossip goin' non-stop
Sippin' on pink lemonade
How could eighteen years just up and walk away?
Our little pony-tailed girl, grown up to be a woman
Now she's gone in the blink of an eye
She left the suds in the bucket
And the clothes hangin' out on the line
Yee-hoo!


She's got her pretty little bare feet
Hangin' out the window
And they're heading up to Vegas tonight

How could eighteen years just up and walk away?
Our little pony-tailed girl, grown up to be a woman
Now she's gone in the blink of an eye
She left the suds in the bucket
And the clothes hangin' out on the line
She left the suds in the bucket
And the clothes hangin' out on the line
She was in the backyard
Say it was a little past nine
When her prince pulled up
A white pickup truck
Plenty old enough
And you can't stop love
No, you can't fence time
