Ooh yeah

I love the way you wear those worn-out blue jeans
Walkin' all around in the big sunshine
Baby, let me believe that you're perfect
At least for a little while

And you don't have to tell me what you're thinkin'
You can keep all that to yourself
Baby, we got such a good thing going
Don't show me that you're someone else

'Cause I'm actin' as if
This blue sky's never gonna rain down on me
I'm tellin' myself
This true love's never gonna leave me lonely
Unless there's something I've missed
I'm acting' as if
(As if, as if, as if)
(As if, as if, as if)

We don't have to have that conversation
Baby, don't you think it's going fine?
We don't need to send out invitations
To tell the world that you're mine

This blue sky's never gonna rain down on me
I'm tellin' myself
This true love's never gonna leave me lonely
Unless there's something I've missed
I'm acting as if

As if your sweet kiss is never gonna fade away
And the way you look at me will never change
'Cause I love the way you wear those worn-out blue jeans
Walkin' all around in the big sunshine

'Cause I'm actin' as if
This blue sky's never gonna rain down on me
And I'm telling myself
This true love's never gonna leave me lonely
