I don't want you to come 'round here no more
I beg you for mercy
You don't know how strong my weakness is
Or how much it hurts me
Cause when you say it's over with her
I want to believe it's true
So I let you in, knowing tomorrow
I'm gonna wake up missing you
Wake up missing you

When the one you love's in love with someone else
Don't you know it's torture? I mean it's a living hell
No matter how I try to convince myself
This time I won't lose control
One look in your blue eyes and suddenly
My heart can't tell you no

I don't want you to call me up no more
Saying you need me
You're crazy if you think just half your love
Could ever please me
Still I want to hold you, touch you
When you look at me that way
There's only one solution I know
You got to stay away from me
Stay away from me!
