She wore a dress with cherries on it
Going somewhere where she'd be wanted
In a town this small all they do is talk
No wedding ring, chipped fingernail polish
She always wished that she could go to college
But some dreams fade
They just slip away
She started to show a few months ago
And she had to go
That's how she wound up

On the backseat of a Greyhound bus
Head hung down with the windows up
Staring at the rest of her life
She never thought this would be the place
Where she would find her saving grace
But she fell in love
She fell in love
On the backseat of a Greyhound bus

The moon was full
The stars were smiling
God has a funny sense of timing
The baby came on the interstate

She finally found what she had been missing
She cried and laughed while the red lights flashed
Sweet baby girl
She looked into the face of a new
The face of a brand new world

On the backseat of a Greyhound bus
Heart so full that it could bust
Staring at the rest of her life
She never thought this would be the place
Where she would find her saving grace
But she fell in love
She fell in love
On the backseat of a Greyhound bus
Sweet baby girl
She found a brand new world
On the backseat of a Greyhound bus
Heart so full that it could bust
Staring at the rest of her life
She never thought this would be the place
Where she would find her saving grace
But she fell in love
She fell in love
On the backseat of a Greyhound bus
She wore a dress with cherries on it
