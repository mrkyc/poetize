Normally I don't cross the line like this
I hope I'm not coming off self-righteous
You only met me tonight
Feel free to stop me anytime
But if it was me, I'd put your heart on a mantle
Protect you from what you're not strong enough to handle
I'd never leave till the tears are dry
I'm there for you tonight and every other night 'cause

Baby, I know that love's just a pattern of ups and downs
You need someone who wants to keep you safe and sound
Someone who won't get tired through the rain and fire
Baby, I know that I won't ever give the runaround
I'll be the one that's always gonna stand around
Promise I won't get tired through the rain and fire

Normally I wouldn't carry on with you
But she's nowhere to be found in the picture
I see the sad in your eyes
Feel free to stop me anytime
But if it was me, I'd hold your heart in a glass case
Instead, she got you feeling like you're in last place
Let me stay till the tears are dry
I'm here for you tonight and every other night

It's amazing how I can look in your eyes
And tell that you haven't been satisfied for a long time
But she just can't deliver, I can do it better
Let me summarize, it's amazing that we only met tonight
And I don't mean to bother
But you seem like an angel that's longing to be free tonight
I'll be your alibi
