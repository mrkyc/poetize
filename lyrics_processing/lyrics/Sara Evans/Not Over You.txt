Dreams; that's where I have to go
To see your beautiful face anymore
I stare at a picture of you and listen to the radio
Hope; hope there's a conversation
We both admit we had it good
But until then, it's alienation, I know
That much is understood
And I realize

If you ask me how I'm doing
I would say I'm doing just fine
I would lie and say that you're not on my mind
But I go out and I sit down at a table set for two
And finally, I'm forced to face the truth
No matter what I say, I'm not over you

Damn, damn, boy, you do it well
And I thought you were innocent
Took this heart and put it through hell
But still, you're magnificent
I'm, I'm a boomerang, doesn't matter how you throw me
Turn around and I'm back in the game
Even better than the old me
But I'm not (But I'm not) even close (Even close) without you

I would lie and say that you're not on my mind
But I go out and I sit down at a table set for two
And finally, I'm forced to face the truth
No matter what I say I'm not over you

I could get back (Get back) on the right track (On the right track)
But only if you'd be convinced (Only if you'd be convinced)
So until then

If you ask me how I'm doing, I would say I'm doing just fine
I would lie and say that you're not on my mind ('Cause you're not on my mind)
Oh, if you ask me how I'm doing (You ask me how I'm doing)
I would say I'm doing just fine (I'm doing just fine)
I would lie and say that you're not on my mind (Whoa)
