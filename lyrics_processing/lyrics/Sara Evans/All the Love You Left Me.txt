It's here when I wake up
Every single morning
Follows me downstairs
In the paper on the wall
In the plaster on the ceiling
Every single drop of air that I'm breathing

What am I supposed to do with?
What am I supposed to do?

With all the love you left me
All the love you left me
It can't hold me, it don't kiss me
But in these sheets, it lays down with me
All the love you left me
You left me, left me, left me, left me
You left me, left me, left me, left me

Can't wash it off like makeup
Leave it in the closet
Like a dress out of style
Can't light it up and burn it
Box it up and send it
Like the shirt, you left behind

All the love you left me
Yeah, all the love you left me
It can't hold me, it don't kiss me
But in these sheets, it lays down with me
All the love you left me
Yeah, all the love you left me
All the love you left me

It can't hold me, it don't kiss me
But in these sheets, it lays down with me
I turn the lights on, I turn the lights off
But it don't matter, baby, all that I got is

All the love you left me
Yeah, all the love you left me
It can't hold me, it don't kiss me
But in these sheets, it lays down with me
