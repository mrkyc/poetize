Like I never did ball before
Gonna ball
Like I never did ball before
I may never get a break like this in life no more
I got money in my pocket
I ain't begging for friends
Cadillac Eldorado
And it's gone to my head
Short time to live
Long time to stay dead
I ain't doing no favors
I ain't asking for none
'Cause I got money
I can pay for my fun
That's the way I want it
That's the way it must be done
Gonna ball
Like I never did ball before
Gonna ball
Like I never did ball before
I may never get a break like this in life no more
I said little mama
We're gonna jump and shout
When that Eldorado rolls up
And I come walking out
I wanna stay, pretty baby
You don't know what it's all about
I want no special woman
I want no special friend
I want a good time today, yeah
Tomorrow I may be down again
Don't dial my number
I'll tell you when
