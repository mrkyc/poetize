To ease my mind
I need to find, find
Someone to call mine
Well, my mama said
You can't hurry love
No, you just have to wait
Love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take
Love, love don't come easy
Yet I keep on waiting, anticipating
For that soft voice
To talk to me at night
For those tender arms
Wrapped around me tight
Well, my mama said
You can't hurry love
No, you just have to wait
Love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take
How long can I wait?
How much more can I take
Before loneliness
Will cause my heart, heart to break?
