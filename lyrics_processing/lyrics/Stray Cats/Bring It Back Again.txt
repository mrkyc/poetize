(Bring it back, bring it back, bring it back again)
(Bring it back, bring it back, bring it back again)

I cruise around with the radio on
Make me feel alright, make me feel alright
Wide open highway and the sun going down
Make me feel alright, make me feel alright
I'd grab my guitar and pick out a song
You'd wear that pretty dress, we never could go wrong
We had no money but never seemed to care
Our love took us everywhere

Bring it back again
(Bring it back, bring it back, bring it back again)
Bring it back again
(Bring it back, bring it back, bring it back again)

I cruise around in a ragtop ride
Make me feel alright, make me feel alright
But now I got no one by my side
To make me feel alright, to make me feel alright
Though I'll never share my memories
No one by my side to comfort me
I need your little hand to hold in mine
There to hold me all the time

Is it any wonder
Why I love you so
Oh, you were my first love
Oh, when your arms met mine
You just stole my heart for all time

Bring it back again
(Bring it back, bring it back, bring it back again)
Bring it back again
(Bring it back, bring it back, bring it back again)

I cruise around with the radio on
Make me feel alright, make me feel alright
Wide open highway with the sun going down
Make me feel alright, make me feel alright
Though I know I'm the only one to blame
I've had enough of this sorrow and pain
I know that deep down you still feel the same
Bring me your love back again
Bring it back again
