I mean I never felt worse
Go to see the doctor
Start chatting up the nurse
She said let me check you out
See what temperature you got
Ooh-ooh baby, you're running really hot
You got the cold, cold sweats
The bad, bad chills
You don't need no tea and honey
You don't need no pills
You gotta rock it off brother
Rock it off
Blast through your fever
Forget about your cold
The flu don't stand a chance
When you get up and dance
Rock it off brother
Rock it off
Now it's really gone wrong
And I wound up in a funk
I get tossed out of the house
And told to pack up all my junk
I jump up on the bedstand
And get myself a dose
Of that good old boogie woogie
That's what I'll have the most

Well that nurse she looked so sexy
Her uniform was tight
I asked her to come out
And dance away the night
She said grab your guitar boy
Lay it on the line
Find yourself some rhythm man
You're gonna be just fine
Turn up that guitar
Slap that stand up bass
Be sure to get them speakers
Right up in your face
Rock it off brother
Rock it off
Blast through your fever
Forget about your cold
The flu don't stand a chance
When you get up and dance
Rock it off brother
Rock it off
Rock it off brother
Rock it off
Blast through your fever
Forget about your cold
The flu don't stand a chance
When you get up and dance
