7 seconds ago, smothered echoes of woe
Disguised as a scream and portrayed in my dreams
It had a nigga drippin' sweat, do you know what I mean?
Really have you ever seen such a horrible sight
That it seeps through the seams of your mind every night
Where to god it gets hard just to turn off the light
Not everybody's blessed with the gift of rest
Some have troubles, weighin' heavy like a hole in their chest
Stand like a man, grin and bear it at best
Searchin' for solution, some set upon a quest
Never findin' what they seek and losin' self along the way
Empty souls never sleep, it's a hell a price to pay
You'll be meetin' wreck tomorrow if you sold shit today
7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2

Never thought it'd come to this, ruptured moments of bliss
Always being fucked, never gettin' a kiss
Close your eyes, cross your fingers, hold your breath and make a wish
Predators and prey, they just exist that way
Hopin' Mystery Man will send a blessin' their way
Ascend to the sky in a burst of flames
Serve themselves salvation for material gain
If you can't see or touch it I suggest that you remain
In a state of mind that's eternally inclined
To question what is real and leave the fables behind

I saw a man the other day, he had the Devil in his eyes
Ruled a great land with a system based on lies
Some they knew the plan but none were the wise
No matter how they tried, none could make him break the guise
Most were kept quiet with material wealth
And a well-contrived image of superior self
Some they had faith in the promise of a chance
Every mornin', 9 o'clock, the bell would ring and they would dance
Others beat the game and knew the cards were stacked
Underground, they made the game but always watched their backs
Periphery ones with no money to spend
Found they didn't even count and they were never havin' it
For some reality and what they see is too much
Retreat to any bottle, bag or vial they can clutch
Escapades and phases many mental mind trips
And safety nets for over-privileged brats that slipped
About the ones on the bottom, they could never exist
