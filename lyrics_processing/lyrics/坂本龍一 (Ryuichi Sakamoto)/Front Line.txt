Sometimes I'd really like to fall in love
But I can only give you a part of me
Sometimes I feel like I'm falling apart
Still I know I just can't stop
Sometimes I want to throw it all away
All except this thing that's a part of me
Sometimes I want to break everything in sight
Still I know that it's no use

I want to know, do you all need this music?
I've got to know, do you find it amusing?

Get up every morning in the battery
For coffee and toast with the TV on
When the whole world turns black at night
I see one little window (it's me)
Somebody tell me where I ought to go
Or just why I'm failing to make up my mind
Sometimes I feel that the answer lies
In the songs the kids sing
You might also like
I want to know, do you all need this music?
I've got to know, do you find it amusing?

Gonna be a soldier
Fighting a mind war
It's called music
And I'm a soldier

Sometimes I'd really like to fall in love
But I can only give you a part of me
Sometimes I feel like I'm falling apart
Still I know I just can't stop

Get up every morning in the battery
For coffee and toast with the TV on
Sometimes I feel that the answer lies
In the songs the kids sing

I want to know, do you all need this music?
I've got to know, do you find it amusing?
Gonna be a soldier
Fighting a mind war
It's called music
And I'm a soldier
Gonna be a soldier
Fighting a mind war
It's called music
And I'm a soldier
Gonna be a soldier
Fighting a mind war
It's called music
And I'm a soldier
Gonna be a soldier
Fighting a mind war
It's called music
And I'm a soldier
Gonna be a soldier
Fighting a mind war
It's called music
And I'm a soldier
Gonna be a soldier
Fighting a mind war
It's called music
And I'm a soldier
Gonna be a soldier
Fighting a mind war
