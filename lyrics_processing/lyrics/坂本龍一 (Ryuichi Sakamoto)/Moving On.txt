I gotta get away from here
There is nothing here for me anymore
Just some memories
I'd forget them if I could

I've got a train to catch and I can't be late
I'm on my way to another state of mine
I'm leaving this one behind

Lots of luck and hope I will need
For my journey
And there is no one can turn me around
I've been here too long
And everything's gone wrong
I never change the view from my window
I see the same old road, the same old souls
Together going nowhere
But that won't be me, I've got plans you see
Places to go, spaces to grow
Got a hand full of dreams and a heart full of hope
With a head full of screams, it gets hard to cope
So I'm leaving it all behind
Saving the life that's mine
You might also like
I've got a train to catch and I can't be late
I'm on my way to another state of mine
I'm leaving this one behind

Packed my bags, said my goodbye
Momma don't be too sad
It's something that I've do
It's no reflection on you
I am older now
Got to make my own way
I don't know how
But i know that I can't stay
Goodbye, don't wanna see you cry
I'll call you when I get there
Wherever there is
I think I have everything I need
Some tapes, my Walkman, a book to read
My old photographs, my locket, a blank book so that I can keep track, and some day I'll consider coming back

I've got a train to catch and I can't be late
I'm on my way to another state of mine
I'm leaving this one behind
It's so far from home
I hope that I can make it alone
It's all looking the same
New rules but a similar game

Listen mamma everything's all right
But lately it seems I can't sleep at night
Oh no, I'm not sleeping at all
I guess I miss the security
Your kiss and how you used to sing to me so sweet
Give everybody my love
I've decided to tough it out
Giving up, I'll never go that route
Not me, I have faith in my dreams
But it gets hard
No one to catch my fall
I miss you a lot
But I made some new friends
I'm sleeping better
Did you get my letter?
Tell everyone I said, "hey"
And when I get some money
I'll come see you, okay?
I've got a train to catch and I can't be late
