Said so long to the mistakes and questions and start over again
Look in his eyes; you'll find your own reflection, a face of hardship and pain
Your money saved and spent, your loves and losses, they're not worth it again
I feel like as people we're afraid to wonder, afraid of our heaven and our hell
My mother raised me with strength and measure; my father raised me too late
Let your beat go on forever, they say we're made to live as one
Let this need to fear each other not be passed on to my son
Let your beat go on forever, let your fears down rivers run
Let the silence be the music, when their words are said and done
Now fate lands you out in the open, a slave to the man inside your head
Your second chances, they're buried deep in rock canyons
As you lie here in bed
I feel like as people we're afraid to question, afraid of uncertainty and death
Pulling half my weight along, I'm begging for attention
It's hard to find a place to fit in
Let your beat go on forever, they say we're made to live as one
Let this need to fear each other not be passed on to my son
Let your beat go on forever, let your fears down rivers run
Let the silence be the music, when their words are said and done
You might also likeIt's times like in our search for peace
That it's fear we're most afraid of
But the blood we bleed and the air we need
Are hardly cold or used up
Let your beat go on forever, they say we're made to live as one
Let this need to fear each other not be passed on to my son
Let your beat go on forever, let your fears down rivers run
