And short is the lifetime that I've lived, knowing
Messing up and starting over again
Maybe all the breaks
And the young mistakes
Were supposed to carry me here
This time I gotta get it right
Gotta get it right now
Gotta get it right this time
Lord knows I've let myself down
Too many times, many times, yeah
This time I gotta get it right
Gotta get it right now
Gotta get it right this time
My life is passing me by
Gotta take a deep breath
And get it right
Looking for answers what have I missed, someone
I want to be so much better than this in the long run
Stepping forward and falling backwards again
When I get the breaks
Will the young mistakes
Be the ones to carry me on

I know I'll get there
Things will get better
Better with every day
And what lies behind me
Will not define me
I tell myself nothing
Can stop me now, stop me
This time I gotta get it right
Gotta get it right now
