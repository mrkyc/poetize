Especially you, you're the jewel in my crown and I don't wanna mess this up
Am I a good enough lover, good enough friend good enough at giving you what you need
Will someone else come along with a much better song and a smile that you wanna trust
You say, "Whatever"
You say, "Who cares?"
You say, "Baby there's no, there there"
You say, "I can"
You say, "I'm gonna, I can do anything I wanna"
Nothin' but love, even when you can't see it
Nothin' but love, even when you can't see it
Nothin' but love, even when you can't see it
She says "Look at me, just look at me"
Nothin' but love, even when you can't see it
Nothin' but love, even when you can't see it
Nothin' but love, even when you can't see it
She says "Look at me, just look at me"
My life was a stop light, didn't know it turned green, you still didn't honk at me
You waved and I waved and we went on our way, and I knew you were just my type
And now we're under the gun in another recession, are we gonna be alright?
You say, "We can"
You say, "We're gonna, we can do anything we wanna"

She says "Look at me, just look at me"
Nothing but love, even when you can't see it
Nothing but love, even when you can't see it
Nothing but love, even when you can't see it
She says "Look at me, just look at me"
