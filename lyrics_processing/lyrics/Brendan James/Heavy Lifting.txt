I sing for everything to go back where it started
Oh Oh Ohhhhhhhh
Life is love and both have got you blinded
There's no rest for the few who want it all
And I know you've got it in you
The fire burning inside
Fate, she's really testing you this time
I sing for you, your broken hearted
I sing for everything to go back where it started
You've lost the way, you started drifting
You look ahead and all you see is heavy lifting
I sing for you I sing for you I sing for you I sing for you
One tree falls for the times you never get back
Two suns rise for the days that lie ahead
And you'll never be alone here
There's always somebody else
And they know how it feels to cry for help
I sing for you, your broken hearted
I sing for everything to go back where it started
You've lost the way, you started drifting
You look ahead and all you see is heavy lifting
I sing for you I sing for you I sing for you I sing for you
Oh oh ohhhh
Sing it like you mean it, sing it like you mean it
Oh Oh Ohhhhhhh
Oh sing it like you mean it, sing it like you mean it

Saying everyone's the same as everybody else
Scream, what you gonna do and how you gonna fix this
Time to get over yourself
I sing for you, your broken hearted
I sing for everything to go back where it started
You've lost the way, you started drifting
You look ahead and all you see is heavy lifting
I sing for you
You've lost the way, you started drifting
You look ahead and all you see is heavy lifting
I sing for you I sing for you I sing for you I sing for you
