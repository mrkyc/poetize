Life is not free
He said call me weak
But for once I'm proud of me
What you proud of, who you stand for
Not the Lord above
Dirty living got you giving never enough
My sister named Maria
She caught a bright, early sun
With sin, and with love
Like a tattoo on her arm
She couldn't find no separation
Between loving life and love
Dirty living got her giving never enough
Blame it on the doctor
He never healed your pleas
Blame it on your mother
She never saw your needs
Looking up to heaven, I tell you
Sinner, you've got to believe
Live like a fool
You'll get what's coming to you
Like an angel, came his mother
She said one more second chance
She pleaded with Jesus said
Make my boy a man
Though he loved her, he abused her
Stole her wallet, jewels and used her
Dirty living got him digging for a resolution
You might also likeShe walked with less pride
Than one tiger, no stripes
She cried like a baby
On the first of newborn nights
She never let nobody tell a girl
More loving brings more pain
Dirty living got her breaking
Hearts and souls the same
Blame it on the doctor
He never healed your pleas, yeah
Blame it on your mother
She never saw your needs
Looking up to heaven, I tell you
Sinner, you've got to believe
Ya live like a fool
You'll get what's coming to you
In in the back streets of their broken town
On a corner with no name
These two, unworthy, two unfaithful wanderers
Meet face to face
They fall in love, they run away
They find they're both one in the same
But it backfires, with their lying and
Unwillingness to change
Blame it on the doctor
He never healed your pleas, yeah
Blame it on your mother
She never saw your needs
You looking up to heaven, I tell you
Sinner, you've got to believe
Live like a fool
