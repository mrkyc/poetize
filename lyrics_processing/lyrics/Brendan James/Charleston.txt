I go for a walk along east bay
It's so beautiful today
Happiness hanging in the air
And it's only real when shared
Remember the night at the gallery
The back of the roon and she smiled at me
I knew right away I could never be lonely
How could I be lonely
I always wanna feel like I do in Charleston
I tell you thats the way that life should be
I always wanna love like I love in Charleston
Oh how I love you Charleston
Your secret's safe with me
Na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na
Counting the cobblestones and bricks
That the fathers built the city with
I might be a Yankee born and raised
But it's here I wanna spend my days
A sandwich a pose and a bunch of friends
The fourth of July, out on Sullivan
I gotta get back to a place so real, it's so real
I always wanna feel like I do in Charleston
I tell you thats the way that life should be
I always wanna love like I love in Charleston
Oh how I love you Charleston
Your secret's safe with me
Na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na

Everyone knows that things must change
We know what we were and we know what we can be
Change is slow, this I know
I always wanna feel like I do in Charleston
I tell you thats the way that life should be
I always wanna love like I love in Charleston
Oh how I love you Charleston
Your secret's safe with me
Na na na na na na na na
Your secrets safe with me
Na na na na na na na na
