And you were drawn to me
And we lived that moment so honestly
But directions change
And the glory fades
And we find ourselves going separate ways
I wish you well
On your way, on your way
I wish you well
On your way, on your way
There's a humble thing
There's a truth that rings
There's a wisdom people beside you bring
Because you did me kind
And you eased my mind
And you found in me what I'd never find
I wish you well
On your way, on your way
I wish you well
On your way, on your way
I wish you well
On your way, on your way
I wish you well
On your way, on your way
I wish you well
You might also likeNow the photographs
And the dreams we had
And the times we laughed while the hours passed
Well they're in my blood
They're what I'm made of
They're a part of me that I'll always love
I wish you well
On your way, on your way
I wish you well
On your way, on your way
I wish you well
On your way, on your way
I wish you well
On your way, on your way
I wish you well
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
When the cold wind blows
When your highs turn low
When you're drowning in your sorrow
I will lift you up
I will send you love
I will never let the time we had be lost on us
I wish you well
I wish you well
I wish you well
I wish you well
On your way, on your way
I wish you well
On your way, on your way
I wish you well
Leave our troubles behind us
I wish you well
Let our tears wash away
I wish you well
Leave our troubles behind us
I wish you well
Let our tears wash away
I wish you well
Leave our troubles behind us
Let our tears wash away
