I want to open my mind
I want to pledge my allegiance to all I can find
I want a car that will crash through the barriers
To a road no one knows
I want to feel less control, more abandon
I want to land far from home
The revolution of the earth around the sun
Is the perfect lesson of how it should be
So if I cannot learn
To journey and return
To never rest till I've seen all I can see...
I want to learn a completely new language
One I don't understand
I want to help someone lost, someone helpless
With the strength of my hand
I want to come to the base of a statue built
Before they counted the years
And there I'll fall with my face in my hands and cry
And feel their hope in my tears
The revolution of the earth around the sun
Is the perfect lesson of how it should be
So if I cannot learn
To journey and return
To never rest till I've seen all I can see...
You might also likeTrain rides and pastures colliding...
Colors and customs i've never seen...
I know I, yes I know I
I know I will stumble
But time is precious, my friend
Those who journey can easily understand
The more they see the more they'll learn
The more that they will be
So this I swear to you, and this I swear to me
I'll never rest till I've seen all I can see
No, I'll never rest till I've seen all i can see
I want to know where the strength of a person lies
In their past or their future
Is it in the way that they hurt or they love themselves
Or is it all an illusion?
I want to crawl from this skin that i'm painted in...
Body, please let it give
I want to find the creator of all good things
