If violence is wrong in America, violence is wrong abroad
If it's wrong to be violent defending Black women and Black children and Black babies and Black men, then it's wrong for America to draft us, and make us violent abroad in defense of her

Tons o' guns, everybody's gettin' strapped
Tons o' guns, gotta watch the way you act
Tons o' guns, real easy to get
Tons o' guns, bringing nothing but death

Tons o' guns are in the streets nowadays
It's big money and you know crime pays
Check your nearest overpopulated ghetto
They greet you with a pistol, not trying to say hello
Mad kids packed 'cause the neighborhood's like that
Want some shit that's fat, catch a victim, do a stick
Kids pulling triggers, niggas killing niggas
Five-o, they sit and wait and tally death-toll figures
It's crazy, there ain't no time to really chill
Jealous motherfuckers always wanna act ill
.22s, .25s, .44s, .45s
MAC-11s, AKs taking mad lives
What the fuck you gonna do in a situation?
It's like you need to have steel just to feel relaxation
Tons o' guns

The thing they know best is where the gun is kept
The thing they know best is where the gun is kept
The thing they know best is where the gun is kept
But the thing they know best is where the gun is kept

Tons o' guns, you got, we got, they got
The state of affairs, yo, it's like mad chaos
I know a kid who just passed the other day
They shot him sixteen times, so there he lay
You can pray for this shit to, like, cease
But until then, a nigga's gonna pack a piece
And yo, the devil's got assassination squads
Wanna kill niggas 'cause they're scared of God
They got camps where they train, they learn to take aim
At a nigga like a piece of game
And I'm not seein' that, them days are gone
'Cause now we got chromes to put them where they belong
See me a rude boy from and inna Brooklyn
Fuck the bullshit, pain, and suffering
I'm comin' off with a foolproof plan
As if each and every lyric was worth a hundred grand
I stand in the face of hatred
Lettin' off mad shots, making devils run naked
Tons o' guns
But the thing they know best is where the gun is kept
But the thing they know best is where the gun is kept

Tons o' guns, everybody's gettin' strapped
Tons o' guns, gotta watch the way you act
Tons o' guns, real easy to get
Tons o' guns, bringing nothing but death

Tons o' guns, but I don't glorify
'Cause more guns will come and much more will die
Why? Yo, I don't know, black
Some motherfuckers just be living like that
They like to feel the chrome in their hands
The shit makes 'em feel like little big man
Twelve years old, catching wreck
'Cause there ain't no supervision puttin' kids in check
People get wounded, others, they perish
And what about the mother and the child she cherish?
The city's wild, up steps the wild child
Tension, anger, living in danger
What the fuck you gonna do in a situation?
It's like you need to have steel just to feel relaxation
Tons o' guns
Tons o' guns
Tons o' guns
Tons o' guns
Tons o' guns
