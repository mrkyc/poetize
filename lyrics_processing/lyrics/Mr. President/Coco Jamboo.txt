Put me up, put me down
Put my feet back on the ground
Put me up, take my heart
And make me happy
Put me up, put me down
Put my feet back on the ground
Put me up, feel my heart
And make me happy

Here we go, gettin' smooth to the groove
Watchin' lovely ladies, as I smooth as I move
'Cause that's what they say, but I can't prove
So turn it up again and watch me move to the groove
As we get close, you whisper coco
I hold you in my arms and you say, "Jamboo"
Scream and shout, turn and say, "Colombo"
Now I gotta go, so coco

Put me up, put me down
Put my feet back on the ground
Put me up, take my heart
And make me happy
Put me up, put me down
Put my feet back on the ground
Put me up, feel my heart
And make me happy

That's the way I treat dem girls, kinda smooth, see
'Cause there's one man and yo, well that's me, see
So let me show you 'round while you sip your tee gee
But no coco loco, boom, while I take a pee leak
When I hold my baby, she says I do it nicer
I like my chicken with rice and lemonade and
That's what you get, when she shouts out Jamboo
Now I gotta go, yo coco
