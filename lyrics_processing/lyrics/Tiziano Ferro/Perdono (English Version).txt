Look at the joy I'm feeling with my heartbeat
I'm trying to find a way to tell you that I'm crazy
If you don't understand what you mean to me I know I hurt you so
But honey I'm here to let you know
I love you so to let you know
That I don't want live every single day here alone
I wanna see you dancing, smiling next to me

I told you I was right, but I was wrong
And now I dedicate to you my song
Cause if I live without you I'm not strong
I'm your hitting sun and you're my moon
Select me shine just that you know
Believe it's you who I adore
Although your conditradictions and defects
I still want your sweet caresses

Here it's cold like at christmas time
Here it's darker without your smile
All my deeper dreams here are dying
Mars and venus - here- I'm just crying
Take my glow and give me your moonlight
What can I do? - I don't know
Please come back I swear that it will last
We'll be dancing flying space
