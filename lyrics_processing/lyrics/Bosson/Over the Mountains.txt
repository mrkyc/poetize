Oh...oh
Oooh...oh
Oooh...
Anywhere in the world I'll go for you

I've made up my mind I've packed my bags
I'm not returning home, until someone will give me reason to
I lock the door and take a breath
I'm ready to let go, I know you're somewhere out there too
There's only one thing for me to do and I go

Over the mountains and over the sea
To find a heart that belongs to me
Anywhere in the world I go
Anywhere till I find you
I run through the valleys
I run through the fields
I'd do anything I am hard to please
And anywhere in the world I go
Anywhere till I find you

I fly like the wind, I don't know where my heart will lead the way
I need someone to love and hold on to
But the road is long I've had my doubts
But nothing lets me down, cause I know you're somewhere out there too
Waiting for me to get to you, and I go
You might also like
Over the mountains and over the sea
To find a heart that belongs to me
Anywhere in the world I go
Anywhere till I find you
I run through the valleys
I run through the fields
I'd do anything I am hard to please
And anywhere in the world I go
Anywhere till I find you

It doesn't matter what
The time will tell
Cause love will make it worth it
For you, for you and me
It doesn't matter what the others say
Cause I will keep on searching
And I go and I go and I go...

Over the mountains and over the sea
To find a heart that belongs to me
Anywhere in the world I go
Anywhere till I find you
I run through the valleys
I run through the fields
I'd do anything I am hard to please
And anywhere in the world I go
Anywhere till I find you
Over the mountains and over the sea
To find a heart that belongs to me
Anywhere in the world I go
Anywhere till I find you
I run through the valleys
I run through the fields
I'd do anything I am hard to please
And anywhere in the world I go
