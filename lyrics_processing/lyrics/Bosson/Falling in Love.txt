I do not know what it is
But I think I'm falling in love
I don't know what it is, and I sure don't know how
But you filled my heart with butterflies
I'm falling in love

The doctor says there ain't no cure this time
That everything's alright and I am fine
But my friends  don't  the  agree
They say I'm not the one I used to be
And it makes me wonder
Why I'm smiling all the time
The only thing I have inside my mind is a picture of you
And it's there no matter what I do
No matter what

I don't know what it is but I think I'm falling in love
I don't know what it is but when I close my eyes
You are the one I'm dreaming of
I don't know what it's but I'm floating in the sky
I don't know what it is and I sure don't know how
But you filled my heart with butterflies I'm falling in love...
You might also like
Seems like all my problems went away
They start to make them all stop everyday
So I spend them with you
Though it makes me feel the way you do
And it makes me wonder about the pain I get inside
Every time that you're not by my side
You have opened a door
I have never felt this way before and I want more

I don't know what it is but I think I'm falling in love
I don't know what it is but when I close my eyes
You are the one I'm dreaming of
I don't know what it's but I'm floating in the sky
I don't know what it is and I sure don't know how
But you filled my heart with butterflies

When we are walking I get to hold you're hand
And that's making me proud
I'm screaming aloud that I'm I am a happy man
And when we're looking upon the clear blue sky
You give me a kiss, I wonder who is this lucky guy

I don't know what it is but I think I'm falling in love
Oooh ooohhhh
(you're the one I'm dreaming of)
I don't know what it is but when I close my eyes
You are the one I'm dreaming of
I don't know what it's but I'm floating in the sky
I don't know what it is and I sure don't know how
