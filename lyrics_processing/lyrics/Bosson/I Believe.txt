I believe in love
I believe in love

You say of love
There's no such thing
You've only known
The pain it brings
You question why
I give your heart
You stay alone
You stay apart

I've seen (I've seen), I know (I know)
I trust (I trust), I feel (I feel)
Love is (Love is) alive and for real

And I believe (I believe in love)
I believe in love (I believe two hearts)
I believe two hearts
Can learn to beat as one
And I believe (I believe that time)
I believe that time (Tie your soul to mine)
Can tie your soul to mine
I see the doubt there in your eyes
But I believe (in love)
You might also like
I know you're scared
I understand
Please take my word
And take my hand
If there's no faith
Inside of you
I can believe
Enough for two

I've seen (I've seen), I know (I know)
I trust (I trust), I feel (I feel)
Love is (Love is) alive and for real

And I believe (I believe in love)
I believe in love (I believe two hearts)
I believe two hearts
Can learn to beat as one
And I believe (I believe that time)
I believe that time (Tie your soul to mine)
Can tie your soul to mine
I see the doubt there in your eyes
Baby I believe
I believe in love (Hey oh)
I believe two hearts (Hey oh)
Can learn to beat as one (Beat as one)
And I believe
I believe that time (Oh oh)
Tie your soul to mine (Oh oh)
I see the doubt there in your eyes
And I believe
I believe, I believe in love
Two hearts can beat as one
I believe, I believe that time (I believe in love)
Can tie your soul to mine (Baby I believe)
I believe, I believe in love (Oh oh)
Two hearts can beat as one
I believe, I believe that time (I believe in love)
Can tie your soul to mine

Baby I believe
I believe that time (Oh oh)
Tie your soul to mine (Oh oh)
I see the doubt there in your eyes
But I believe (I believe in love)
I believe in love (I believe two hearts)
I believe two hearts
Can learn to beat as one
And I believe (I believe that time)
I believe that time (Tie your soul to mine)
Can tie your soul to mine
I see the doubt there in your eyes
