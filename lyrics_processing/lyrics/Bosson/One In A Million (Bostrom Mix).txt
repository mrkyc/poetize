Now, you're one in a million, ohh
Sometimes love can hit you everyday
Sometimes you can fall for everyone you see
But only one can really make me stay
A sign from the sky said to me
You're one in a million, you're once in a lifetime
You made me discover one of the stars above us
You're one in a million, you're once in a lifetime
You made me discover one of the stars above us
I've been looking for that special one
And I've been searching for someone to give my love
When I thought that all the hope was gone
A smile there you were and I was gone
I always will remember how I felt that day
A feelin' indescribable to me
I always knew there was an answer for my prayer
And you, you're the one, the one for me
You're one in a million, you're once in a lifetime
You made me discover one of the stars above us
You're one in a million, you're once in a lifetime
You made me discover one of the stars above us

In the beginning I was cool
And everything was possible
They tried to catch me
But it was impossible
No one could hurt me it was my game
Until I met you baby and you were the same
And when you didn't want me I wanted you
Because the funny thing about it is I liked the show
I like it when it's difficult
I like it when it's hard
Then you know it's worth it
That you found your heart
You're one in a million, you're once in a lifetime
