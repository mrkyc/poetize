Gonna tell the world that i've fallen for you

I've got a secret, I can't hold it back anymore
I've got to share it with everyone I know
It's a lifetime waiting for someone like you
I'm falling, a feeling too good to be true, so true

I write you a song on the radio
I want them to know that I'll die for you

This is the right time
Oh oh this is the moment
I'm gonna tell
The world that I've fallen for you
This is the right time
Oh oh this is the moment
I'm gonna tell
The world that I've fallen for you

I never thought that, there was a space inside me
But you found it, a place where you wanted to be
I'm happy, you gave me time to see
I'm falling, for the first time I feel that I'm free

I write you a song on the radio
I want them to know that I'll die for you

This is the right time
Oh oh this is the moment
I'm gonna tell
The world that I've fallen for you
This is the right time
Oh oh this is the moment
I'm gonna tell
The world that I've fallen for you

I'll write you a poem in the magazine
I'll buy some time in the 7 o'clock news
I run through the city naked shout and scream
HEEYOO HEYOOOOOO
I'll drop some flyers from an aeroplane
I'm making a movie where I'm singing in the rain
I send out the message to the outer space
Calling earth, ground control, do you read me?
I read you, over
We've got a small problem up here
We found a guy who says he's got a message for the world
I think he's really fallen in love...over and out
This is the right time
Oh oh this is the moment
I'm gonna tell
The world that I've fallen for you
This is the right time
Oh oh this is the moment
I'm gonna tell
The world that I've fallen for you

OHOOO HEEYOOOOO
OHOOO can't hold it back no more
OHOOO HEEYOOOOO
OHOOO gonna tell the world

This is the right time
Oh oh this is the moment
I'm gonna tell
The world that I've fallen for you
This is the right time
Oh oh this is the moment
I'm gonna tell
