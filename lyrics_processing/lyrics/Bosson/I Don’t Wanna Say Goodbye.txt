I don't wanna say goodbye
Ooh-ooh
I don't wanna be alone, ooh-oh-oh

I give you one more chance to say
How much you want me back
Oh, I'll give you one more chance to say
That this time it will last until
That death will do us part
So we can find peace in our hearts
I give you one more chance to say you're sorry
And that you love me, 'cause

I don't wanna be alone
I don't wanna be apart again
I don't wanna say goodbye
Don't wanna say goodbye
I don't want a broken heart
I don't wanna be hurt again
I don't wanna say goodbye, again
Oh-oh (I don't wanna say goodbye)

I give you one more chance to prove that you're the one for me, oh
I give you one more chance but this time you will have to
Work hard for a man with dignity
You'll have to earn my trust you see
I give you one more chance to say you're sorry
And that you love me

All the pain you caused
When you cheated on me

So swear to god
And promise me
That it will never ever
Never ever happen again
'Cause I still love you
