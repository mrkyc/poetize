I don't trust you, that's what I like about you
I can't reach you, that's why I wanna have you

It's been so easy, easy come and easy go
Going in the fast lane, love is for free and so are you
I took some wrong turnes, and now I get what I deserve
You're the one I deserve you're the one cause....

I don't trust you, that's what I like about you
I can't reach you, that's why I wanna have you
Wanna get to know you
I wanna figure you out
Because you're different
We're gonna be one tonight

You met the right man, cause we are just the same
And I will show you, cause I invented this game
I'm comin' at ya, cause you have made up my mind
This is it! We are...

Baby we are One of a Kind
O-o-ooh, baby we are one of a kind
O-o-o-oh, we're one of a kind
O-o-o-ohh, baby we're One of a Kind

I don't trust you, that's what I like about you
I can't reach you, that's why I wanna have you
Wanna get to know you
I wanna figure you out
Because you're different, we're gonna be one tonight

You met the right man, cause we are just the same
And I will show you, cause I invented this game
