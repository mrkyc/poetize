You're one in a million, ooh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
You're one in a million, ooh

Sometimes love can hit you every day
Sometimes,you can fall for everyone you see
But only one can really make me stay
A sign from the sky, said to me

You're one in a million, you're once in a lifetime
You made me discover one of the stars above us
You're one in a million, you're once in a lifetime
You made me discover one of the stars above us

I've been looking for that special one
And I've been searching for someone to give my love
And when I thought that all the hope was gone
A smile, there you were, and I was gone (I was gone)
I always will remember how I felt that day
A feeling indescribable to me, yeah
I always knew there was an answer for my prayer
And you, you're the one, the one for me (Yeah)

In the beginning, I was cool and everything was possible
(They tried to catch me, but it was impossible)
Nobody could hurt me, it was my game
Until I met you, baby, and you were the same
And when you (Didn't want me, I wanted you)
Because the funny thing about it is I like the show
(I like it when it's difficult, I like it when it's hard)
Then you know it's worth it, that you've found your heart (Found your heart)
