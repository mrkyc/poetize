You find a reason to keep me balanced
You find an excuse to make me accept
I know what you are thinking now
That you don't know just I now feel
It's dark outside, the wind is chill
Don't tell me that time is fooling us
Reality of life is sometimes lost
Don't tell me this is just a one night stand
That I am falling in your trap
I'm tired, I am hurt

And do you love me or not
I do not know what to say to you
Do you love me or not
So stop this game and just tell me if you do
Do you love me or not
Do not know what I should do
Do you love me or not
If I wake up now I will be sad no more

Don't tell me that time is fooling us
Reality of life is sometimes lost
Don't tell me this is just a one night stand
That I am falling in your trap
I'm tired, I am hurt
You might also like
And do you love me or not
I do not know what to say to you
Do you love me or not
So stop this game and just tell me if you do
Do you love me or not
Do not know what I should do
Do you love me or not
If I wake up now I will be sad no more

I would rather carry all the blame
I don't want to see you sad in tears
I would rather forget all the pain
To see your innocent face once again

And do you love me or not
I do not know what to say to you
Do you love me or not
So stop this game and just tell me if you do
Do you love me or not
Do not know what I should do
Do you love me or not
If I wake up now I will be sad no more
And do you love me or not
I do not know what to say to you
Do you love me or not
So stop this game and just tell me if you do
Do you love me or not
Do not know what I should do
Do you love me or not
If I wake up now I will be sad no more

Do you love me or not
Love me or not
