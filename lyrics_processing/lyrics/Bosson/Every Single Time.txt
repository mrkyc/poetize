'Cause every single
Time I close my eyes...
And every single
Day when sun will rise...

It's not easy for me
To fall in love and love again
It's not easy for me
To unbreak my heart
And forget the pain

It's not easy for me
Trying to pretend
That i'm just a friend
It's not easy for me...

'Cause every single time
I close my eyes I dream of you
And every single day
When sun will rise I'm thinking about you
'Cause every single time
I close my eyes I dream(I dream) of you (of you)
And every single day
When sun will rise I'm thinking about you

It's not easy for me
To let her love and to love again
It's not easy for me
'Cause I realize this is our due end

It's not easy for me
Trying to pretend
That i'm just a friend
It's not easy for me...

'Cause every single time
I close my eyes I dream of you
And every single day
When sun will rise I'm thinking about you
'Cause every single time

'Cause every single time
I close my eyes I dream of you
And every single day
When sun will rise I'm thinking about you

And every single time
I pass you by I smile I do
But every single smile
Is just a lie my heart still cries for you
