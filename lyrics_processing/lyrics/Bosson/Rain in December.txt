There are things that I regret
There are things I can't forget
There are things that believe
Through the hints that I receive
I'm not giving up not yet....
So many things I wanna say
But words are getting in my way
So many things I wanna do
I can make it up to you
I believe we'll find a way

Cause
Sometimes it rains in December
(we all know that)
Sometimes the snow falls in June
(Don't you know that)
Although it hurts to remember
Our fall in September
I know that I'll never surrender....

Can I get it through to you
In spite the stupid things I do
I never meant to say those words
Wanna see you though it hurts
Wish that we could talk it through
I try to call you on the phone
Just to see if you're at home
I try to find the words to say
How I miss you everyday
Baby please pick up the phone....
