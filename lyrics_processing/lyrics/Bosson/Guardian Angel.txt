I'll be watching over you
I'll be watching over you

In the night
When you're sleeping
I'm wiping your tears
So secretly

'Cause your life were the one dont look back you were strong
And soon you'll be fine without me
And one day you will rise as the light through the sky
Embrace with your arms around me

I'll be watching over you
You know that I'll be your guardian angel
And I'll be looking out for you
You know that I'll be your guardian angel
And I'll be watching out for you
I'll be watching over you
You know that I'll be your guardian angel
And I'll be looking out for you
You know that I'll be your guardian angel
(Your guardian angel)
You might also like
In your eyes
I sense your fears
When I'm by your side
I'm always near

'Cause your life were the one dont look back you were strong
And soon you'll be fine without me
And one day you will rise as the light through the sky
Embrace with your arms around me

I'll be watchin' over you
You know that I'll be your guardian angel
And I'll be looking out for you
You know that I'll be your guardian angel
And I'll be watching out for you

I'll be watching over you
You know that I'll be your guardian angel
And I'll be looking out for you
You know that I'll be your guardian angel
(Your guardian angel)
I'll be watching over you
You know that I'll be your guardian angel
And I'll be looking out for you
You know that I'll be your guardian angel
And I'll be watching out for you
I'll be watching over you
You know that I'll be your guardian angel
And I'll be looking out for you
You know that I'll be your guardian angel
(Your guardian angel)
