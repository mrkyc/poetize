Undressing me with your eyes
I'd be a rich one and then I could prove all my senses were real all along
You wanted me too
Though now you laugh and call me a fool
I know you wanted me too
Before she got to you
If I could remember all the things you
Used to say when we were left alone
I'd have a book of sonnets so inspired
All the muses would cringe at your denial
At how you wanted me too
Though now you laugh and call me a fool
I know you wanted me too
Before she got to you
Before she got to you
I would say that we were something special to behold
But now it's over, all over
Before she came barging through
We were prime to make the kind of love
As scarce as four leaf clover
Now, I'm a bit confused
Cos what I felt I thought was true...
Did she barge in and steal your heart away?
Or did you know from the first day
I was just someone to play?
If so, damn that's cold

I would say that we were something special to behold
But now it's over, all over
Before she came barging through
We were prime to make the kind of love
As scarce as four leaf clover
If I could understand what you have found in her
More than you could have had with me
I'd finally understand a mind
As twisted as yours must be for you to go
Just when you wanted me too
Though now you laugh and call me a fool
I know you wanted me too
What kind of spell has she put on you?
I know you wanted me too
