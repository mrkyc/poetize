And say you love me how I am
You love the way I fit some ideal
Not the real woman you've yet to understand
See, love ain't all heaven, and I am no angel
But I do the best I can
You always wanted something more from my body
And said you needed something more from my loving
But all you got was me and that's all that I can be
I'm sorry if it let you down
Now it's no nice excuse but all the magic was used
Up on trying to uphold
Some kind of tame, flattering persona
That soon enough was getting real old
It takes more than pressure to change rock to diamond
Now all you have is sand
Slipping through your fingers
You always wanted something more from my body
And said you needed something more from my loving
But all you got was me and that's all that I can be
I'm sorry if it let you down
But I'm not gonna sit around
And waste my precious divine energy
Trying to explain and being ashamed
Of things you think are wrong with me
I'm not gonna sit around
And waste my precious divine energy
Trying to explain and being ashamed
Of what you think is wrong with me

Like I was different than what I am offering you now
Let you down, you say I let you down
And drug your heart around
Did you forget about
All of the love and the acceptance that you promised me too?
You always wanted something more from my body
And said you needed something more from my loving
But all you got was me and that's all that I can be
I'm sorry if it let you down
You always wanted something more from my body
And said you needed something more from my loving
But all you got was me and that's all that I can be
I'm sorry if it let you down
But I'm not gonna sit around
And waste my precious divine energy
Trying to explain and being ashamed
Of what you think is wrong with me
I'm not gonna sit around
And waste my precious divine energy
Trying to explain and being ashamed
Of what you think is wrong with me
