Look what you've done to me
(Look what you've done to me, done to me)
Make me behave like I wouldn't ever (ever)
I know you're the one for me
(I know you're the one for me, one for me)
Your essence is the ink in the word forever (ever)

Oh, your significance, every cloud knows
Ask the flowers, ask the snow
It is even deeper than the ocean can go
Can you image

I'm crystal clear (like the water, water, water)
I'm crystal clear (like the water, water, water)
Live on you alone for years
And no, that isn't fasting, no, no
(like the water, water, water)

Look what you've done to me
(Look what you've done to me, done to me)
Make me behave like I wouldn't ever (ever)
I know you're the one for me
(I know you're the one for me, one for me)
Your essence is the ink in the word forever (ever)

Oh, how could I forget to mention
You're the only melody that gets my attention
I already believe, don't need no convincing
Excuse me, and I'm not asking

I'm crystal clear (like the water, water, water)
I'm crystal clear (like the water, water, water)
Live alone on your love for years
And no, that isn't fasting, no, no
(like the water, water, water)

Your rainbow (the water, the water, the water)
(Water, water)
Is all of me (the water, the water, the water)
(Water, water)
From every moment's pixelation (the water, the water, the water)
(Water, water) To Orion's constellation
(The water, water) Beyond what we can see
(Water)

I'm crystal clear (like the water, water, water)
I'm crystal clear (like the water, water, water)
Live alone on your love for years
And no, that isn't fasting, no, no
(like the water, water, water)
Yeah
Bum-ba-ba-bah, ba-dah
