There were flashing lights when we met
Not the typical place you would be
In a flash of time, my mind was set
I knew you were the girl there for me

And though you just wanted to leave (Ooh)
Imagine how great it could be (Ho)
The F-U-T-U-R-E (Spells the future, girl)
Sit down hold your horses don't leave (Where you going, girl?)

Come and sit with me, don't be so quick to leave (Please)
I really like you girl (Girl, girl)
Let's trade thoughts and words, explore the universe (Verse)
But just don't leave me girl (Girl, girl)
I really like you girl (Girl), girl (Girl)
From the moment (The moment), that we met (We met)
I really like you girl (Girl), oh girl (Girl)
And I know, (I know) this is it (This is it)

Against the wall is where you lean
The most beautiful girl that I've seen
Out of this world, my God you bling
I'm surprised that you are a human being
You might also like
And though you just wanted to leave (Ooh)
Imagine how great it could be (Ho)
The F-U-T-U-R-E (Spells the future, girl)
Sit down hold your horses don't leave (Where you going, girl?)

Come and sit with me, don't be so quick to leave (Please)
I really like you girl (Girl, girl)
Let's trade thoughts and words, explore the universe (Verse)
But just don't leave me girl (Girl, girl)
I really like you girl (Girl), girl (Girl)
From the moment (The moment), that we met (We met)
I really like you girl (Girl), oh girl (Girl)
And I know, (I know) this is it (This is it)


Come and sit with me, don't be so quick to leave (Please)

And I know, (I know) this is it (This is it)
Yo, I think I got the one now (Uh-huh)
Never me, man, never me, never in a million years (Uh-huh)
But I do, haha
