My love, ooh
My love

A winner never quits
And a quitter never wins
I thought about what I wanted
And you were on my list
Remember where I was?
In the desert with no love
No cactuses, just dust
And you swept me from above (oh)
My love

So I just wanna say
Thank you for this day
'Cause it is so good

Good morning
You got me feelin' brand new (Brand new)
You got me feelin' brand new (Brand new)
Like the tag's still on me
Like the tag's still on me
Jumpin' 'round in your bag (yeah)
Jumpin' 'round in your bag
So good morning, ooh girl
You are the feeling I'm jammin' to (Brand new)
You are the feeling I'm jammin' to (Brand new)
Like the tag's still on me
Like the tag's still on me, oh
You might also like
My love, ooh
My love

Life to me is easy
People make it complicated
When love is the tool
No reason we can't make it
Come on, let's go, be brave
Feel somethin' that they'll praise
Once we know that we're made
Then give it all the way (oh)

My love

So I just wanna say
Thank you for this day
'Cause it is so good

Good morning
You got me feelin' brand new (Brand new)
You got me feelin' brand new (Brand new)
Like the tag's still on me
Like the tag's still on me
Jumpin' 'round in your bag (yeah)
Jumpin' 'round in your bag
So good morning, ooh girl
You are the feeling I'm jammin' to (Brand new)
You are the feeling I'm jammin' to (Brand new)
Like the tag's still on me
Like the tag's still on me, oh (Listen)
All my life, when I describe
What I want, I've been misunderstood (yeah, yeah)
The more I try at bein' satisfied
And didn't think that I could
But then you came along (you came along)
And you made me strong (you made me strong)
Like God said you would, would
(God said you would, you would)
So I just wanna say (I wanna say)
Thank you for this day
(Thank you for this day, it's so good)
'Cause it is so good
Girl

Good morning
You got me feelin' brand new (Brand new)
You got me feelin' brand new (Brand new)
Like the tag's still on me
Like the tag's still on me
Jumpin' 'round in your bag (yeah)
Jumpin' 'round in your bag
So good morning, ooh girl
You are the feeling I'm jammin' to (Brand new)
You are the feeling I'm jammin' to (Brand new)
Like the tag's still on me
