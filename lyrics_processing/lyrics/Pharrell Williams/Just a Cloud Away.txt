This rainy day is temporary
The contrast is why we got 'em
'Cause sun shining through is just a cloud
Away, way, way, way, way, way
Way, way, way (Hey, baby), way, way, way, way

So what? You've blown a fuse (You've blown a fuse)
Well, that happens to us all (That happens to us all)
Well, I come with great news (I come with great news)
The day could change (Change), change (Change)
Change (Change), change (Change)

We've all, of course, been there before
Been there cryin', fightin' the dark
Let good energy be, you're strong
Blow it away, way, way, way

This rainy day is temporary
The contrast is why we got 'em
The sun shining through is just a cloud
Away, way, way, way, way, way
Way, way, way (Hey, baby), way, way, way, way
You might also like
Well, today the rock star (Today the rock star)
Feels like singin' the blues (Feels like singin' the blues)
Don't abandon that song (Don't abandon that song)
'Cause the tune could change (Change), change (Change)
Change (Change), change (Change)

We've all, of course, been there before
Been there cryin', fightin' the dark
Gravity doesn't mean the Earth's your ball and chain (Chain)
Chain (Chain), chain (Chain), chain (Chain)

This rainy day is temporary
The contrast is why we got 'em
'Cause sun shining through is just a cloud
Away, way, way, way, way, way
Way, way, way, way, way, way, way

Everything is cyclical
What goes around does come back around, baby
Everything boomerangs
What goes up must come down
Love is warm when it's cold
Humility will keep your feet on the ground
So do your thing through the rain
If you understand, won't you sing with me now?
This rainy day (Oh) is temporary
The contrast is why we got 'em
The sun shining through is just a cloud
Away, way, way, way, way, way
Way, way, way, way, way, way, way
This rainy day is temporary
The contrast is why we got 'em
The sun shining through is just a cloud
Away, way, way, way, way, way
