Our Father, which art in heaven
I'm so grateful
For all the beautiful things
That You are allowing me to see
The birds, the bees
The ability to do what I do
The opportunities
I know You love me, man
And I think it's time
And my duty to tell the world (Jesus is my daddy, I'm tellin' you, oh)

Angels 'round me, won't let me fall
You watch for who I'm friends with
I got tattoos, you forgive me
You know I'm so sensitive
You know I'm chased by women
You know my mind is driven
To you, my heart is given

You're the greatest
You're the greatest (Wow)
You're the greatest (Jesus is my daddy, I'm telling you)
You're the greatest, don't let me fall
You might also like
They don't understand what you do for me (Do for me)
And judging by my actions
They don't know I believe (I believe)
Not talking 'bout what I wear
Where I drive and where I sleep
I mean the ability to hear, feel and see

You're the greatest
You're the greatest (Wow)
You're the greatest (Jesus is my daddy, I'm telling you)
You're the greatest, don't let me fall

Thank you for my brothers
Thank you for my daddy (Daddy)
Thank you for my mother
So happy that she had me
For that, I was shooting love
And hearts that's filled with hatred
Thank you for my power
It won't intoxicate me

You're the greatest
You're the greatest (Wow)
You're the greatest (Jesus is my daddy, I'm telling you)
You're the greatest, don't let me fall
I'm tryna teach the kids
There's more than meets the eye
And if they keep you first
Then apply it'll make you fly
I'm not saying that I'm the fruit
That femmish minded need
But when I listen to you
I know I could really see

You're the greatest
You're the greatest (Wow)
You're the greatest (Jesus is my daddy, I'm telling you)
