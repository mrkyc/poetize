Gush, gush, gush
Tell me
Gush
Make the pussy just gush
Make the pussy just gush
Make the pussy  just gush
Make it, make it, just gush
Make it, just gush
I make the pussy  just gush
I make it, just gush

I'm imagining things
Do you wanna try?
Take off your halo and wings
Girl, I can make her fly

I don't know what's come over me
My momma didn't raise me that way
You lit a fire from inside of me
That'd light your seat ablaze, girl
Light that ass on fire

I could be the guy to treat you
To a nice movie, feed you
But I don't wanna mislead you
Tonight, I think I wanna be dirty, girl
Do you wanna get dirty, girl? Come on
Light that ass on fire
Do you wanna get dirty, girl? Let's go

Girl, the world's watchin'
From sunset to moonrise
They're tryna catch a glimpse (Intimacy)
Of you and I

I don't know what's come over me
My momma didn't raise me that way
You lit a fire from inside of me
That'd light your seat ablaze, girl
I'll light that ass on fire

I could be the guy to treat you
To a nice movie, feed you
But I don't wanna mislead you
Tonight, I think I wanna be dirty, girl
Do you wanna get dirty, girl? Come on
Light that ass on fire
Do you wanna get dirty, girl? Let's go


I don't know what's come over me
My momma didn't raise me that way
You lit a fire from inside of me
That'd light your seat ablaze, girl
That would leave those panties in flame, girl
I'll light that ass on fire
I could be the guy to treat you
To a nice movie, feed you
But I don't wanna mislead you
Tonight, I think I wanna be dirty, girl
Do you wanna get dirty, girl? Come on
Light that ass on fire
Do you wanna get dirty, girl? Let's go
Do you wanna get dirty, girl? Come on
Light that ass on fire
