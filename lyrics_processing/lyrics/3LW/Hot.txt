I've been moving slow for what seems so long
Now, I'm here and I know what I want is
You and me and nights of crazy lovely fantasies
Minds connected some time ago now
In the moment right up before I
Anxious, waiting, thinking how each touch is gonna be

I can't wait, make your move
Boy, I'm hot here
I can't wait, I imagine you over me
Can you put out this fire inside of me
Cause I'm breaking down
I'm too hot on fire

Crazy 'bout what I get into
Crazy 'bout rockin' it too, so
But with no regrets I'll let you have a part of me
Patience has walked out the door
You and I (Let's get it on)
No more waitin', concentrate on what we came here for

I can't wait, make your move (Uh-huh)
Boy, I'm hot here (I'm hot here)
I can't wait, I imagine you over me (Imagine you over me)
Can you put out this fire inside of me (Oh-oh, oh)
Cause I'm breaking down
I'm too hot on fire (On fire)
You might also like(Quick, get, get down)

Don't really want to say
I'm breaking down
But I can't take the heat (I can't)
It's all around me (No, no)
Curiosity's (Oh) Got me thinking (Oh)
So, don't you hold out, boy (Oh)
I need you baby (Oh)

I can't wait, make your move
Boy, I'm hot here (It's serious)
I can't wait, I imagine (I can't wait, I imagine) You over me (I'm curious)
Can you put out this fire (You over me) inside of me (Inside of me, baby)
Cause I'm breaking down
I'm too hot on fire (On fire)
I can't wait, make your move
Boy, I'm hot here (It's serious)
I can't wait, I imagine you over me (I'm curious)
Can you put out this fire inside of me (Inside of me)
Cause I'm breaking down
I'm too hot (On fire)
Breakin' down
Breakin' down, hot
Breakin' down
I'm too hot on fire
