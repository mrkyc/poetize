Oh, yeah
Ooh, yeah
Hmm-mmm
Mmm

Everything always happens to me
Stuck here in this traffic jam
Accident on the side of the road
Is making me late again
No spaces in the parking lot
Had to leave it in the safety red zone
Couldn't have been more than a minute or two
Came back and the car was towed

Everytime I go crazy
When I felt little things gettin' me mad
I didn't stop or look around and realize
My life ain't so bad

Had no new shoes and complained
Till I met a man with no feet
Thought I had nobody to make my house a home
Till I saw a family livin' on the street
I was shattered when you broke my heart
But at least I gotta heart to beat
Now, I finally realize
It's not all about me

Got a call about an old girlfriend
Who kissed her kids and waved goodbye
She had a real bad habit of taking a sip
Before she put the car in drive
And now, she's gone and wound up DOA
Nothing left to say, but why (Why, baby, why)
I had no idea it was her wreck I was
Impatiently trying to get by

Now, every time I go crazy, Go crazy
When I feel the little things getting me mad
I stop and look around and realize
My life ain't so bad, oh

Had no new shoes and complained (No)
Till I met a man with no feet (With no feet)
Thought I had nobody to make my house a home (My house a home)
Till I saw a family livin' on the street (Livin' on the street, I was shattered)
I was shattered when you broke my heart (My heart)
But at least I gotta heart to beat (Oh no, no)
Now, I finally realize (It's not)
It's not all about me
The world won't stop revolving if I'm having a real bad day
Sick of feeling sorry that you rained in my parade
Cause no matter how hard it gets, someones got it worse
I can't forget I'm only one of five billion other stories living on this earth, oh

Had no new shoes and complained
Till I met a man with no feet (No feet)
Thought I had nobody to make my house a home
Till I saw a family livin' on the street (Till I saw a family livin' on the street)
I was shattered when you broke my heart (I was shattered)
But at least I gotta heart to beat (Still breathing and I'm grateful)
Now, I finally realize (It's not)
It's not all about me (No, no, no, no, had no new shoes)
Had no new shoes and complained (Oh no, no)
Till I met a man with no feet (How could I complain)
Thought I had nobody to make my house a home
Till I saw a family livin' on the street (I saw a family livin' on the street)
I was shattered when you broke my heart (I was shattered, oh)
But at least I gotta heart to beat (And I'm grateful)
Now, I finally realize (It's not all about me)
