(Pick up the phone to call, but then hang up)
Cause I knew one-night would turn into heartbreak
Cause you never act right
(You thought that I would just be around)

Dammit, man
Funny me running into you tonight
Me standing here looking dynamite
You standin' there like you wanna bite
I know you wanna bite that's why you're drinkin', man
Take it to the dancefloor, hurt your back
Now, you're thinkin' 'bout all the love we had
And you wanna take me by the hand, but I got a man
