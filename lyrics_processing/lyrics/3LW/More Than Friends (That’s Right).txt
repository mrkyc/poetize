That's right
That's right

Sometimes, I wish we were more
Than just friends, I know
That I'm dreaming
Cause you're crazy about her
Sometimes, I wish all the time
That you spend with her
Was with me instead
I wish we could be more than friends

It's time to let you know
Just how I feel
About that day (That's right)
You drive me crazy (That's right)
If she ever lets you go
Then you know the deal
Boy, you will be mine
Till the end of time

(It's the same dream)
Over and over
I can see us walking
And holding hands
(You and me)
Closer and closer
If everything was different
You'd be my man, oh
You might also like
Sometimes, I wish we were more
Than just friends, I know (Yes, I know)
That I'm dreaming
Cause you're crazy about her (Cause you're crazy about her)
Sometimes, I wish all the time (Sometimes, I)
That you spend with her
Was with me instead (Was with me instead)
I wish we could be more than friends (Could be more than friends)

Waking up into the morning
Each day I think of you
And how I wish I were that special girl
In her place (That's right)
Every time you see me with
A smile on my face
I just can't help, but wish
For the day, hey

(It's the same dream)
Over and over
I can see us walking
And holding hands
(You and me)
Oh, closer and closer
If everything was different
You'd be my man, yeah, yeah
Sometimes, I wish we were more
Than just friends, I know (Yes, I'm dreaming)
That I'm dreaming
Cause you're crazy about her (Cause you're crazy about her)
Sometimes, I wish all the time (Sometimes, I)
That you spend with her
Was with me instead (Were with me instead)
I wish we could be more than friends (Could be more than friends)

More than friends (More than friends)
More than friends (More than friends)
More than friends
That's right
That's right

Sometimes I wish we were more (Sometimes, I)
Than just friends, I know
That I'm dreaming (That I'm dreaming)
Cause you're crazy about her (Crazy about her)
Sometimes, I wish all the time
That you spend with her
Was with me instead (Was with me instead)

Cause you're crazy about her (Cause you're crazy)
Sometimes, I wish all the time (Sometimes I)
That you spend with her
Was with me instead
