All the girls get iced up, let's bang the clubs
I got big wheels twenty-three, drop-top Bentley, it's on
Because the night is young I wanna shake my thang
Head to the bar toast to good life, it ain't no thang, oh (Toast to the good life)

I can't get enough, feel you're the one
I'm burning up inside
I feel the heat keep thuggin' me
Tonight is right

Twist our bodies ecstasy
Hot girl is what I be
Toast to the good life
(Bling, bling all night)
Twist our bodies ecstasy
Hot girl is what I be
Toast to the good life
(Bling, bling all night)

Cuties push up slow motion, I feel free
I got my eyes on the one fitted hat with the baggy jeans
It feels so good, DJ, just let the record play
My mind is three-sixty, let's dance the night away, woah-oh

I can't get enough, feel you're the one
I'm burning up inside (Inside)
I feel the heat keep thuggin' me
Tonight is right (Tonight's the night)

Twist our bodies ecstasy
Hot girl is what I be (Hot girl is what I be)
Toast to the good life
(Bling, bling all night) (All night)
Twist our bodies ecstasy
Hot girl is what I be
Toast to the good life (Toast to the good life)
