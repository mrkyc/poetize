Mmm-mm-mm-mm
Mm-mm-mmm (Oh)

I was just about to walk away
When I felt your gravity pullin' me closer
There was no breakin' free
It had a hold on me, so what was I supposed to do
When it's gettin' so hot
Was it you or the lemon drop, mmm
Like a shot straight to my head
Think I better catch my breath (Ha-ha)

I can't let you get away
So, I'll just make a move
Step to you and then say
(Oh)

Whatcha doin' after this, got me thinkin' 'bout
Doin' them thangs I ain't never did
And I might wanna roll with you, but before we hit the lot
Tell me what you wanna do
You might also like
Thinkin' you know the deal
So, baby, come and grab the wheel, whatcha gon' say now (Hmmm')
Tell me are you down tonight
Cause I'm in for the long ride cause you're a hot boy (You're a hot boy)
And even if the clock strikes one, two (Two)
Ain't no way we gon' move cause
I came to get my party on
Wasn't lookin', but I think that you're the one

I can't let you get away (Can't let you get away)
So I'll just make a move (So, I'll just make a move)
Step to you and then say (Step to you and just say)

Whatcha doin' after this, got me thinkin' 'bout
Doin' them thangs I ain't never did (I ain't never did)
And I might wanna roll with you, but before we hit the lot
Tell me what you wanna do (Tell me what you wanna do)
Whatcha doin' after this, got me thinkin' 'bout (Yeah)
Doin' them thangs I ain't never did (I ain't never did)
And I might wanna roll with you, but before we hit the lot
Tell me what you wanna do (Say I don't care, where we go)

Say I don't care, where we go
As long as I got you around (Even in a crowd)
Even in a crowd, we're all alone
(Cause all I'm thinkin' about is you, woah-oh)
Whatcha doin' after this, got me thinkin' 'bout
Doin' them thangs I ain't never did (I ain't never did)
