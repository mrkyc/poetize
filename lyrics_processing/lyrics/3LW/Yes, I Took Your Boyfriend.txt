Yo, Adrienne
Huh (Oh)
I cannot believe you took Derrick from Nikki
Why'd you do it (Oh)
Girl, she was playin' him
And you know that a good guy is so hard to find (Oh, yeah)
Dang, what you gonna say to her at school tomorrow

What you fail to understand when you gotta man you gotta bend
All of those extra activities or he's gonna run to a girl like me
Cause I'm a fly girl with the time to be his shoulder when he cries
Ridin' shotgun and even drive his brand new Benz, it's too late to cry

I'll save his heart, I'll be his superwoman (Oh yeah)
Or you can just call me the cleanup woman
Tighten up your grip or he'll get taken from ya
When I take your place, don't say I didn't warn ya

Yes, I took your boyfriend (That's right)
Cause it seems you didn't want him (Seems you didn't want him)
Had that cutie wide open (That's right)
So, I had to jump right on it (Had to jump right on it)
Yes, I took your boyfriend (Boyfriend)
Cause it seems you didn't want him (Seems you didn't want him)
Had that cutie wide open (That's right)
So, I had to jump right on it (On it)

Now, you wanna run up all in my face calling me this and that, don't player hate
Need to be checking all your thoughts, checkin' heads got you caught up in a whirl
While you were caught up, I caught him, it's not his fault, don't be mad at him
Take your loss, go swallow your pride, he's waiting for me in his new ride

I'll save his heart, I'll be his superwoman
Or you can just call me the cleanup woman (Yeah)
Tighten up your grip or he'll get taken from ya (Tighten up your grip)
