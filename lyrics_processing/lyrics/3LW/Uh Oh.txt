Oh

I met him last night, me and my man just had a fight
Went to a party and guys on my right
That's when I saw this man in my light (Uh oh, uh oh)
Body like ooh, he looked in my eyes said whatchu wan' do
Pulled me in close, put his lips on mine
That's when my man came in from behind
You know what it's like

Uh oh, my man just seen me with another thug yo
I think I'm in a little bit of trouble
He caught me red-handed and I don't know
What I'm gonna do, I got caught up
In the moment and I never thought of
What would happen if he ever saw us
But he did and I, and I don't know what to do (Uh oh, uh oh)

Stormed out upset, it wasn't my fault but I look suspect
Cause dude was all on me like that
My man never should've saw me like that
So I told boy I'll be right back, I'm lookin' for my man
But just like that, he was gone and he never came back
There ain't nothin' I can say that (Make him wanna stay)

Oh, it's just a sign, get straight back for all the shit I did for you way back
Breakin' my stacks in half, we would smoke stacks and laugh
Now, you behind my back with another cat you at
How you gon' pull me like that
I wouldn't have been steady if I knew that you was hoeing around
And all this time, I thought my boo was really holdin' it down
It's over with now, I ain't even knowing you now
Ask your new friend why your man ignoring you now, ayo
