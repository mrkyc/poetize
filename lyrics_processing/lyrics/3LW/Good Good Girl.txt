Woah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh, mmm, yeah
(Woah, woah, woah, woah)
Oh, yeah

Should I give you some
That is the question
And will it change the way
You look at me
I have been so afraid
While you've been so patient
My mother would have a fit
If she could see

You made a good, good girl (Good, good girl)
Do a bad, bad thing (Bad, bad thing)
Although my mind is strong (Ooh)
My body isn't listening (Listening)
See, I know right from wrong (Woah, woah, woah, woah)
But my heart won't speak (Won't say nothing)
So, should I stay a good, good girl (Yeah)
Or do a bad, bad thing (Bad, bad thing)
You might also like
I'm burning incense and candles
I planned it all perfectly
Now, do you think you can handle
A massage from me, yeah
Yes, I know it's unexpected
When love takes control, you feel naked
But I'm not afraid no more
I just want you to walk through that door

And make a good, good girl (Good, good thing)
Do a bad, bad thing (Bad, bad thing)
Although my mind is strong (Ooh)
My body isn't listening (Listening)
See, I know right from wrong (Woah, woah, woah, woah)
But my heart won't speak (Won't say nothing)
So, should I stay a good, good girl (Yeah)
Or do a bad, bad thing (Bad, bad thing)

Kissing you, feeling you (That's not so bad)
Touching you, holding you (That's not so bad)
Wanting you like I do (That's not so bad)
I've almost decided, I've tried hard to fight it
I, I just might, I just might
Give it to you, baby (You-oh-oh-oh)
Although my mind is strong (Oh)
My body isn't listening (Listening)
See, I know right from wrong (See, I've been thinkin' about it)
But my heart won't speak (And you almost broke me down)
So, should I stay a good, good girl (So, should I, should I)
