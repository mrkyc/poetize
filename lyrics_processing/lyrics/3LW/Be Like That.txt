Be like that (Why can't we)
(You and me, we just)
Be like that (More than friends)
(More than we've ever been)
Be like that (Stop)
Ooh

Been feelin' this feelin' since we've been dealin'
I won't lie
Caught up and good as it should as blessed
All of my pride
Keep up bumpin' heads and the moment be there
I won't blush
Can't keep this secret much longer
When it's you that I want

(Can't keep my eyes off ya)
(Can't keep my mind off ya)
I can't keep this love
All to myself
(Can this be right)
(Can it be all night)
Tell me what you wanna do
Cause I'm tryna deal with you
You might also like
Be like that (Why can't we)

Be like that (Stop the shyness)
(The frontin', it's all about lovin' you)
Be like that, why can't we (Mmm)
You and me, be like that

You act like you don't know
What's going on
To thinkin' of a girl could be it
Cause that's where you're wrong
It's me, it's me
Oh, it's always been me
I've been feelin' you from the dark
I just want us to be more

(Can't keep my eyes off ya)
(Can't keep my mind off ya)
I can't keep this love
All to myself
(Can this be right)
(Can it be all night)
Tell me what you wanna do
Cause I'm tryna get with you
Be like that (Why can't we)

Maybe I'm wrong
For comin' on so strong
But the love we had as friends
Has really grown
Everything I could want you
Bring to my life
Happiness, peacefulness
Joyfulness (Yeah, yeah)
