There's some things on my mind I don't know that I should be thinking
Am I wasting my time thinking 'bout you and I these feelings
Cause I see you and me, holding hands, doing things, going further
But they say we're too young and those things will come
I'm just curious

When can I touch you, when can I kiss you
I'm curious
Nothin' more than a thought comin' straight from the heart
I'm just feelin' us
Thinkin' 'bout you and me, thinkin' 'bout how it feels
I'm curious
I just wanna know what true love is though
I'm just feelin' us

On the phone in my bed, on my back staring at the ceiling
When I'm talkin' to you, what I feel, is it true
I'm wonderin'
Whether day or late at night, what I feel deep inside it keeps burnin'
Does my man understand everything that I am
I'm just curious, I'm just curious

When can I touch you, when can I kiss you
I'm curious (I wanna know)
Nothin' more than a thought comin' straight from the heart
I'm just feelin' us (Thinkin' 'bout you and me)
Thinkin' 'bout you and me, thinkin' 'bout how it feels
I'm curious
I just wanna know what true love is though
I'm just feelin' us (I'm just feelin' us)

If I could have things my way we'd go past time
Maybe we'd do the things I'm thinking in my mind
And all the things I want to know, I'd know
The places we'd explore, I'd go
But now, I see us both together
Learning more about each other's lives

When can I touch you, when can I kiss you
I'm curious
Nothin' more than a thought comin' straight from the heart
I'm just feelin' us (I'm just curious, I'm just curious)
Thinkin' 'bout you and me, thinkin' 'bout how it feels
I'm curious (I'm feelin' this lately)
I just wanna know what true love is though
I'm just feelin' us (You're always on my mind)
When can I touch you, when can I kiss you
I'm curious (I wanna know, I gotta know if it's love)
Nothin' more than a thought comin' straight from the heart
I'm just feelin' us (I'm feelin' us, I'm feelin' us, baby)
Thinkin' 'bout you and me, thinkin' 'bout how it feels (How it feels)
I'm curious (If I'm kissing and hugging and holding you tight)
I just wanna know what true love is though (Hey-ey-ey)
I'm just feelin' us (Feelin' us, feelin' us, feelin' us)
You know, boy
We both know that we have a thing for each other
And it's natural for us to both wonder what it would be like
But the time is not right
And I hope you're satisfied
Because I'm satisfied just being curious
(I can't get you off my mind)

When can I touch you, when can I kiss you
I'm curious (I wanna know 'bout it, no)
Nothin' more than a thought comin' straight from the heart
I'm just feelin' us (Straight from the heart, babe, uh-oh-woah)
Thinkin' 'bout you and me, thinkin' 'bout how it feels (I'm thinkin' 'bout how it feels)
I'm curious
I just wanna know what true love is though (But, boy, I gotta take my time)
I'm just feelin' us (True love is though, yeah, yeah)
When can I touch you, when can I kiss you
I'm curious
Nothin' more than a thought comin' straight from the heart
I'm just feelin' us
Thinkin' 'bout you and me, thinkin' 'bout how it feels
I'm curious
I just wanna know what true love is though
