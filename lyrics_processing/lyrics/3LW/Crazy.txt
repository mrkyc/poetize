I don't apologize
That I have compromised
Myself and another guy
It's you that I'm talkin' 'bout
I been with him for years
But baby you, I
I must be
Crazy

I want you for my own
You been with her so long
She ain't never done you wrong
And she's so nice to me
We should have never touched
Cause now we're in love
We must be
Crazy

You got a girl, I got a man
But I can't lie (I can't lie)
I wanna leave him when I look
Into your eyes (Your eyes)
You never thought that holdin' me
Would change your life (Your life)
I guess that just this once two wrongs
Can make a right (Two wrongs make a right)
You might also like
Its something that I can't help
My heart wants someone else
There's nothing that I can do
Never thought it would be you
You say you're not afraid
I'll do the same to you
You must be
Crazy

It's too late to turn back now
I'm afraid we don't know how
Baby, keep your faith in me
I'll never let you down
It's funny how we both know
There's no one else
For us, it's
Crazy

You got a girl, I got a man
But I can't lie (You got a girl, oh)
I wanna leave him when I look
Into your eyes
You never thought that holdin' me
Would change your life (Your life)
I guess that just this once two wrongs
Can make a right (Crazy)
You got a girl, I got a man
But I can't lie (I can't lie)
I wanna leave him when I look
Into your eyes (Your eyes)
You never thought that holdin' me
Would change your life (Your life)
I guess that just this once two wrongs
Can make a right (It's crazy)

I've been dreamin' (Baby, I been dreamin')
Baby, you and I (You and I)
Just leavin' (Mmm)
All of this behind
Hit the bank and get our dough (Get our dough)
Pack our bags, baby, let's go (Let's go)
I just wanna be your girl (Ooh)
You and I against the world (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I've been dreamin' (Baby, I been dreamin')
Baby, you and I
Just leavin' (Just leavin', leavin', leavin')
All of this behind (Behind)
Hit the bank and get our dough
Pack our bags, baby, let's go (Baby, let's go)
I just wanna be your girl
