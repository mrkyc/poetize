Once upon a time not long ago
I was all about this guy and my mind was blown like
(Whoop) But he love them hoes
And you know how the story goes so

I'm on my B.I.Z
All by myself, got nobody
(Whoop) Well, except for just a friend
But he's not what I need
See he could do me in the mornin', but he couldn't make my day
And after that, he's boring me in every single way
(Whoops) He had kids all across the land
I just don't understand (Take it from me)

Out tonight and it's uh, uh, on

And if it's understood just say

Push up if you wanna, fa sho, if you gotta lotta
(Whoop) But don't get too hot, I gotta
Do my own damn thang (Just say)
(Ayo) Ladi, dadi, we up in the party
Push up if you wanna, fa sho, if you gotta lotta
(Whoop) I don't got nobody, I'll be
Doin' my own thang

And, all in all, I hope you're in good health
I just came to vibe and enjoy myself and

Whatever is your thang (It's whatever)

When you came with his game (That's cool with me)
Said he's doing thangs (That's cool with me)
(Whoop) (Hold up) I see his chain and his jewelry
See he's ain't fooling me, next, please
Now, may I kick it over to the VIP room
Where they're poppin' bottles like
(Whoop) And the party's still goin'
And the haze got thick cause the smoke was blowin' from
Thugs doing shotguns (Passing the dutch)
One was steady coughing (He took too much)
Then cops came (The stuff got flushed)
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

(Ayo) Ladi, dadi, we up in the party
Push up if you wanna, fa sho, if you gotta lotta
(Whoop) But don't get too hot, I gotta
Do my own damn thang (Just say)

Push up if you wanna, fa sho, if you gotta lotta
(Whoop) I don't got nobody, I'll be
Doin' my own thang

Push up if you wanna, fa sho, if you gotta lotta (Uh-huh)
(Whoop) I don't got nobody, I'll be
Doin' my own thang (Doin' my own thang)
Ladi dadi, we up in the party
Push up if you got it, but don't if you're not about it

Doin' my own thang
