The way you hold this thing will throw it back
It's cool if I just keep it real if you heard (What girls really talk about)
In other words (If you knew that we think about)
The way you walk
The attitude you be catchin' when I piss you off
The little things you don't know you do that turns me on and it gets me off
There's a lot to what I say while I put you up on game, yeah

Things you never hear a girl say
Things that really drive us crazy
What it's like to be a lady (What it's like to be a lady)
The things you need to know to be in love with a girl
Things you never hear a girl say (The things you never hear)
Things that really drive us crazy
What it's like to be a lady (There's some things you need)
There's some things you need to know if you wanna be apart of our world

See, usually
We don't listen to our body, it confuses things
But occasionally I'll let it get the best of me than the rest of me
And my girls know that's not how it's supposed to be
(When you think about loving) Then it seems like things just change
It's a chance that just won't take, so they turn and walk away
(When you think about loving) Saying us girls are just the same
But we do it anyway, let me put you up on game, boy

(You make me wait for you, but this may take a while)
Well, you might understand women better if you could just see through our eyes
(Women, they speak their hearts, when men, they speak their minds)
We're so emotional, we don't know why we say what we're sayin' half the time
(We're not as hard as we think, but you know we gotta try)
To tell the truth, it's confusing, juggling you and still dealin' with my life
(All independent women need you to understand them)
Cause it's a man's world, but I think every man should know, woah
