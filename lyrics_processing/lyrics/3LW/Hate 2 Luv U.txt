Uh oh
(3LDub, baby)
Got another one
(Nine Lives)
Presidential Campaign
Drink, fall, ya heard

It was the wrong day, the wrong month, the wrong year
I wasn't ready for all the pain and all the tears
Baby, you crushed me, now, I have to deal worst the worst fears
You had to go and take it there

Now, I'm all alone
Knew I should have took my ass home
The times when you was putting it on me
You was putting it on me

I just hate you for it
Hate you for making me fall in love
And there's nothing I can do about it
So blue about it, don't wanna be in love
I just hate you for it
Hate you for making me fall in love
And there's nothing I can do about it
So blue about, don't wanna be in love
You might also like
Thought I could change you and turn you into a good man
Thought my love was bomb and things were goin' as I planned
But what a fool I was, you was still hittin' your ex-girlfriend
I had to be out, you understand

Now, I'm all alone
Knew I should have took my ass home
The times when you was putting it on me
You was putting it on me

I just hate you for it
Hate you for making me fall in love
And there's nothing I can do about it
So blue about it, don't wanna be in love
I just hate you for it
Hate you for making me fall in love
And there's nothing I can do about it
So blue about, don't wanna be in love

(Wish that) Wish that things were different, babe
(Wish that things were different, yeah) That you would love me
The way that I love you, boy (The way that I love you)
Can't believe you hurt me, babe (Can't believe)
And do me this way
I hate to love you
Can't let go
Now, I'm all alone
Knew I should have took my ass home
The times when you was putting it on me
You was putting it on me

I just hate you for it
Hate you for making me fall in love
And there's nothing I can do about it
So blue about it, don't wanna be in love
I just hate you for it
Hate you for making me fall in love
And there's nothing I can do about it
So blue about, don't wanna be in love

I just hate for you it
Fall in love
Do about it
Blue about it, don't wanna be in love
I just hate you for it
Hate you for making me fall in love
And there's nothing I can do about it
