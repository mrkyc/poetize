Funny how love feels
Funny how love can be
Funny how love
Feels, feels

I didn't know till today
I could get hurt so easily
But now I realize (Each time that you say goodbye)
That I almost cried
Why must you go, why can't you stay
I wish you could be here every day
Holdin' me close to you (We both know it don't feel right)
To say goodbye, oh

(Ain't it funny how love can bring you down)
Cause you know something's wrong, yeah
(Then you turn around, suddenly, you found)
That your love keeps you strong, so you can hold on

Funny how love can be
So wrong, so wrong sometimes (So wrong)
Funny how love can be
Can be so right

I didn't think about it much
I didn't know the meaning of
Giving my heart away (We're hoping someday you'd say)
You feel the same, oh
And now I know that love is true
And I don't wanna be here without you
Whether you are near or far (Close my eyes, there you are)
Right here in my heart

(It's kinda funny how now when I get down)
Feel like you can't go on
(Then you turn around, suddenly, you found)
That your love keeps you strong, so you can go on

Funny how love can be
So wrong, so wrong sometimes (So wrong sometimes)
Funny how love can be (Funny)
Can be so right (It can be so right)
Funny how love can be (Funny)
So wrong, so wrong sometimes (So wrong, so wrong sometimes)
Funny how love can be
Can be so right (Can be so right)
It's hard to understand (Understand)
Love sometimes
It can hurt you and sometimes it
It can feel so right

Funny how love can be (Can be)
So wrong, so wrong sometimes (So wrong sometimes)
Funny how love can be so right (Can be)
Can be so right (It can be so right)
Funny how love can be
So wrong, so wrong sometimes (So wrong sometimes)
Funny how love can be
Can be so right (Can be so right)

Funny how love feels (Oh, funny)
Funny how love can be (Love can be)
Funny how love (Feels)

Funny how love feels (Funny, funny, funny, funny)
Funny how love can be (How love makes you crazy, honey)
Funny how love (Funny, funny, funny, funny)
Feels, feels (How love makes you feel crazy things)
Funny how love feels (Oh)
Funny how love can be (Sometimes it makes you feel good)
Funny how love (At times you're up and then you're down)
