Uh-huh
Uh-huh
Uh-huh
Uh-huh

Lookin' familiar, I don't know
Have I seen you somewhere before
Kill the small talk, let's hit the floor
(Are you ready)
To do something you ain't done before
I'll work it till you can't take no more
I think I'm the girl you came here for
(If you can get me)

I like it
What you doin'
How you movin'
So, keep it coming, boy, put it on me

I think I wanna leave with you (Uh-huh)
Do you wanna leave with me (Uh-huh)
Tell me what you wanna do, boy
(Ah-ah-ah)
I think I wanna leave with you (Uh-huh)
Do you wanna leave with me (Uh-huh)
Tell me what you wanna do, boy
(If you can get me, ah-ah-ah)
You might also like
Lookin' at me like you want more
So, after the party, let's explore
We can turn off the lights and lock the door
(When we're ready)
But we ain't leaving here till round four
We freaking each other till we sore
Think I'm the girl you came here for
(If you can get me)

I like it
What you doin'
How you movin'
So keep it coming, boy, put it on me

I think I wanna leave with you (Uh-huh)
Do you wanna leave with me (Uh-huh)
Tell me what you wanna do, boy

Ayo holla, you say you wanna leave with me
C'mon, folla cause I'm about to grab da keys
But don't botha if you small and you don't know how
I roll wit big dogs, got 'em barkin' loud now
Used to be nice, but I'ma keep it foul now
Flossin' this ice and boys goin' down now
Gotcha on your knees like girl come back
Gotcha on my skees cause a girl can mack
Gotcha for all my ladies from the front to the back
From N.Y. to L.A., we don't know how to act
And then back to DC where they say my name louder
I know you hate them boys, that just show they askin' how to
See more of us and be more wit us
And a couple other topics that we won't discuss
If ya leave with me it'll make ya girl hate me though
Just like the so-so cats on the radio, you know

I think I wanna leave with you (Uh-huh)
Do you wanna leave with me (Uh-huh)
Tell me what you wanna do, boy
(Ah-ah-ah)
