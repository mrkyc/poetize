Hold up, guess who rolled up
Big S with the D rolls up
Girls jockin' so the G's lookup
Know what, Santa ain't playin' that stuff
See, Santa steady ridin' on them scrubs for Christmas
Sleigh steady flyin' on the dubs and switches
He's vicious, gear on point and iced out
When Santa hit the floor, you know it's lights out
From the West to the East, up North and down South and
Ghetto Santa Claus is 'bout it
3LDub, throw yo' hands up for me
You know wassup, get your dance on homie cause

We 'bout to get this shit started
We're giving you just what you wanted
From yo' block to my block, we gonna keep it hot
It's Christmas in the hood
Ghetto Christmas, lights flickin'
Police ain't even 'round trippin'
From yo' block to my block, we gonna keep it hot
It's Christmas in the hood

It's goin' down for sure
Ghetto Santa Claus is at the door
I'ma get mine, you get yours
Christmas in the ghetto, yo
You might also like
Yo, today I gotta fat knot in my stash box
And from this block to that block, they be like that's hot
Santa hit the jackpot, seen him in the ragtop
Flossin', tossin' toys at us have not
3LDub and we tell it best
Yo, from Dirty Jerz to LES, you'd never guess
Who was seen on the dance floor all in the mix
Santa Claus for the cause with a thousand chicks
I'm like, Nick, tell me what you gots for me
We in the hood where it's good like it oughts to be
Havin' the time of my life, yo, it gots to be
Back home with my peeps, that's the spot for me, cause, uh

We 'bout to get this shit started
We're giving you just what you wanted
From yo' block to my block, we gonna keep it hot
It's Christmas in the hood
Ghetto Christmas, lights flickin'
Police ain't even 'round trippin'
From yo' block to my block, we gonna keep it hot
It's Christmas in the hood

Celebratin' on the West to East coasted, I stay posted
This is for my people on the block with toasted
My down-home hotties hold it down, you know this
The goody-goodies got no time to notice
How we get down from my town to your town
LA to the Bricks, VA and back down
We clownin' while we downin' egg nog by the case
5-0 ain't trippin' today 'bout your case
Ain't nobody stressin', turkey and dressin'
At the table with the fam', thankin' God for the blessing
It's all good from the grimy to the meadow
It ain't nothing like Christmas in the ghetto, holla back
We 'bout to get this shit started
We're giving you just what you wanted
From yo' block to my block, we gonna keep it hot
It's Christmas in the hood
Ghetto Christmas, lights flickin'
Police ain't even 'round trippin'
From yo' block to my block, we gonna keep it hot
It's Christmas in the hood
We 'bout to get this shit started
We're giving you just what you wanted
From yo' block to my block, we gonna keep it hot
It's Christmas in the hood
Ghetto Christmas, lights flickin'
Police ain't even 'round trippin'
From yo' block to my block, we gonna keep it hot
