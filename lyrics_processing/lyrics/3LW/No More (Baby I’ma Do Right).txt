I'm getting a little tired of your broken promises, promises
Looking at your pager, seeing different numbers and numbers
Call you on your cell, you hangin' with the fellas, the fellas
Hangin' with my girls, you always getting jealous 'n' jealous
I was with you when you didn't have no dollars, no dollars
Hangin' at the crib, chillin' wit yo momma, yo momma
Never fronted you, never brought the drama, the drama
Now, you flipped the script, playa, please

(No, I'm not the one)
Say it again, say it again, oh
(No, I'm not the one)
You do or you don't

You do or you don't, don't
You will or you won't, won't
No more
No more, baby, I'ma do right
You can or you can't, can't
Be a man, be a man, man
No more
No more, baby, I'ma do right
You might also like
You treat me like a lady when you open doors and doors
But then you wanna front when you wit your boys, your boys
How you gonna play me when I bought yo clothes, yo clothes
The ones that you be wearin' when you wit your dogs, your dogs
You know you never thought that I would have the nerve, the nerve
To think about it more since you at the curb, the curb
Blowin' up my pager, say you want a chance, a chance
Listen when I say, playa, please

You do or you don't, don't
You will or you won't, won't
No more
No more, baby, I'ma do right
You can or you can't, can't
Be a man, be a man, man
No more
No more, baby, I'ma do right

Do right, no, I'm not the one
Baby, I'ma do right
Do right, no, I'm not the one
Baby, I'ma do right
Do right, no, I'm not the one
Baby, I'ma do right
Do right, no, I'm not the one
Baby, I'ma do right
I just wanna know
What happened to our love
We used to be best friends
Where did it go wrong
When ya gonna see
How good it is with me
I'm tired and I'm through with all your
Listen, baby (Yo, yo, yo)

Hey yo, you promised me Kate Spade
But that was last year, boy, in the eighth grade
And you ain't Biggie, baby boy, so no it ain't one more chance
When yo friends around, you don't wanna hold my hand
And now you see a girl stylin' and wildin' inside the mix
Hoppin' out the whips, the whips, the five and six
Yes, fly chrome, so pardon my tone
Here go a quarter, go call Tyrone (You do or you don't)

You do or you don't, don't
You will or you won't, won't (No more, no more)
No more (No more, no more)
No more, baby, I'ma do right (Baby, I'ma do right, do right)
You can or you can't, can't
Be a man, be a man, man (Baby, be a man, yeah)
No more (Baby, be a man, yeah)
No more, baby, I'ma do right
Do right, no, I'm not the one (Sing it again, sing it again, girls)
Baby, I'ma do right
Do right, no, I'm not the one (I'm tired of hearin')
Baby, I'ma do right (Baby, I'ma do right, do right)
Do right, no, I'm not the one (Never again, never again, no, no)
Baby, I'ma do right
Do right, no, I'm not the one (I'm not the one, babe)
Baby, I'ma do right
No, I'm not the one
(Say it again, s-say it, say it again)
No, I'm not the one
(Say it again, s-say it, say it again)
No, I'm not the one
(I can do bad all by myself)
No, I'm not the one
(I'm not the one, the one)

You do or you don't, don't
You will or you won't, won't
No more (Yeah, yeah)
No more, baby, I'ma do right (No more)
You can or you can't, can't (You can't)
Be a man, be a man, man (Be a man, be a man)
No more (No more)
No more, baby, I'ma do right (Baby, I'ma do right)

Do right, no, I'm not the one
Baby, I'ma do right

Baby, I'ma do right
