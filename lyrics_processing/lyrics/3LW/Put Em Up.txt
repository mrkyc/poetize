I saw this guy, six foot three
Talking on his celly, lookin' at me
I liked his vibe, them bedroom eyes
(Oh yeah, mmm)
Across the room, the way he moved
Lookin' all hot in them Timberland boots
I liked the things, the things he do
(Oh yeah, mmm)

And now it's time for dancing, tonight if you wanna take a
Chance and my single ladies need some
Attention, I wanna see the fellas
Make a move, throw it up, give it up, don't stop

(Put 'em up) If you got money in the bank
And your own credit cards and a drop to see them
(Let me see you put 'em up) If you got a clip on your cash
When you go to the club and you get in for free then
(Now, all my fellas put 'em up, put 'em up for me) If you makin' money with class
And you win a booklet and you know how to treat 'em
(Let me see you put 'em up) Then maybe we can go away
Ride in my Escalade until that Saturday

And I really like the way you function
(Oh-woah, oh-woah)

It's time to party up
Everybody hear me
You got that good stuff
Then let's just get it crunk
Till you can get enough, get enough

East coast rockin' it, west coast stay rockin', rockin'
3LDub shakin' it, all my thugs watchin', watchin'
Cause it's cause I'm missin' ya
Put your damn hands up like I'm friskin' ya
Compliments to the chef cause ya lookin' scrumptious
Do you want it, bump it, wiggle in the middle, who 'da thunk it
I hear a girl can mack the planet and it
Naughty by double eye, 3LDub, damn it
What I see, I need, I like
Icons for life, how y'all feelin' a'ight
Put ya hands on her hip, you betta punch it right
That means if you ain't feel it, you ain't touch it right
It's the game and the fame that makes the ladies want it
I can pull up in a Hoopty with a donut on it
I'm too street, you too sweet to fight
It's never too many to meet tonight
I stay thuggin', keep the ladies lovin' it
A party ain't a party if you ain't 3LDubbin' it
