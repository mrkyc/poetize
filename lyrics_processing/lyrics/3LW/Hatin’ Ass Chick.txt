Why you standin' with your hands in your pocket
Plug it in the wall and burn up the socket
Bend your knees just in case you set to drop it
Solid as a rock like the way I pop it (Yeow)
Oops, the beat made me it
Shake it off and let me get back to it
It's a party, baby, don't be scared to lose it
Later on, we can make our own music

Girls moving like they really 'bout to give it up (Uh-uh)
Boys acting like they 'bout to put their money up (Uh-uh)
Bartender, lose the shot and fill it up (Uh-uh)
Keep your lighters in the air, we're 'bout to blow it up (Yeow)

Like a thief in the night, I'm a hitman
Keepin' niggas on their toes like quicksand
Lil' mama, go and put it on credit
Money in my pocket, I can always get it
Loosen up your strap, bra too tight
I'll take your man by the end of the night
You're doing things that you know that I like
If you good, boy, I can miss my flight

Throw them chips you stacking
Real talk, we keeps it cracking
