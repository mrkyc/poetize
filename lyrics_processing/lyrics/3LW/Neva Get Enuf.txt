3L and Wayne, what up

Listen, I'm way better than that chump, yeah
Sorry cause I let her get her stuff
Cause she shiftin' with a brother
Who could never get enough of her
I'd go tough for her, could never do enough for her
Mad love for her, mad thoughts of her
Days and days again
And I'm like Rocky, where's my Adrienne
Now, holler back, Kiely
Sweethearts, bounce if you feel me
Little women love little me
Never get enough

Why
Every time I meet a guy
Who wants to try
To get my mathematics
I deny
He wants to take me home
He's out of his mind (Get your mind right)
Will I ever meet someone for me
