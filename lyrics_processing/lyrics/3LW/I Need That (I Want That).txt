A Girl Can Mack

Yo, if you don't like expensive things, then you can bounce
If you don't wanna get it together, you could be out
Cause I'm all about gettin' them things from the truck
To the house to the gear and them rings, no doubt
Could've done it, but ain't no hoe for you now
Try to tell you, but all you do is sit around
Takes more than hope and a dream, I got a mean team
Puttin' in work to get the cream, what

Money and hot ride (I need that)
The platinum and shine (I need that)
The house and the gear (I need that)
I'm sayin', baby (I want that)

Life can turn you in
So many different directions
But I got a mind to win
Yeah (Can't remember why I got with you)
I want everything
But I need to stay realistic
I'm gonna live this dream
Woah, yeah (From here on out, that's what I'm about)

Boy, I feel for you
You think you have it real easy
You don't even have a clue
Yeah, yeah (Can't remember why I got with you)
I'm gonna do my thang
Sorry if you feel rejected
You need to do the same
(From here on out, that's what I'm about)

I need these things
You can't supply me (You can't supply me)
It's too easy
For you to stop tryin' (For you to stop tryin')
Get on your feet (Get off your feet, yeah)
Do it for yourself (Let's do it)
I can't stick around (Lil' Kim, Queen Bee)
Wishing and feeling (3LW, Jackpot)
Goodness gracious the papers
Where the cash at, where the stash at
Nigga pass that, up the bonds and stocks
And the canary yellow D flawless rocks
Introducing the Lil' Kim Chopard watch
I'm on fire 'bout to turn it up a notch
Keep ya yacht, I want ships inside my estate
With Full Force written on the license plate
Heliports and helicopters with gold propellers
Tryna have more cheese than mozzarella
I need stables, there's only one way to live (What's that)
Horseback ridin' in the back of the crib
Two Indian braids like the Navajo
Yippie yi yay, yippie yi yo
Make this money, take this money
Ain't no way you gon' take this from me (Can't nobody take this)

Money and hot ride (I need that)
The platinum and shine (I need that)
The house and the gear (I need that) (The house and the gears)
I'm sayin', baby (I want that) (Woah, blue rings)

Then you can't have me, baby
Don't depend on me, baby
Finally do ya own thing, baby
