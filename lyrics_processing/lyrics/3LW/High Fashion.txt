You've got to be yourself

High fashion, living in the fast lane
Everybody wanna do the same
But you've got to be yourself
You've got to be yourself
Time is passing, do your own thing
No matter what nobody else say
Cause you've got to be yourself
You've got to be yourself

Little Miss Superstar
Riding around in a hot wheels car
Got the system crunk and the Gucci in the truck
But you besta frown cause the money ain't enough
Got a man that doesn't come home
But it doesn't look good if he leaves her alone
So, she keeps on playing the game
She's going insane living up to them expectations

Time is passing, do your own thing
