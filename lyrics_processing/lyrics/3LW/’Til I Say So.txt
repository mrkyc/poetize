Kiely says stop
Turi says go (Oh)
Adrienne says stop
Co-Stars, you ready to play

I can tell that you're feelin' me and from the corner of my eye
I see you checkin' me (Checkin' me, checkin' me)
But, boy, you better take it slow cause you can't pass go
Till I say so
I can tell that you're feelin' me and from the corner of my eye
I see you checkin' me
But, boy, you better take it slow cause you can't pass go
Till I say so

When you made your move, I knew it was on
Tried to turn me out with ya looks and charm
Guess you thought that you had this one won
You guessed it wrong cause the game just begun

Do I look like I was born yesterday (Yesterday)
You better find another girl to play (Oh no)
I must admit ya game was kinda slick
This time you met ya match, I'm up on it

I can tell that you're feelin' me and from the corner of my eye
I see you checkin' me (Checkin' me)
But, boy, you better take it slow cause you can't pass go (Oh)

Wanna take some time and feel things out
Stakes are high and I got some doubts
Pressure's on, things are touch and go
Should I raise ya boy or should I lay low
