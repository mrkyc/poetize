Not this time
Not this time
Not this time
Not this time
Not this time
Not this time
Not this time

You told me that my love was
All good for you
But when I'm not around
There's always someone new
With all my trust
And every little kiss
I can't believe you played
Me out like this

All my friends told me
I was not your only
Guess my heart was
Wrong again
You might also like
How could I be with
Someone like you
After all of the things that you
Put me through
How could you lie
Looking straight in my eyes
Sorry, baby
Not this time

Not this time
Not this time
Not this time
Not this time

The other night when I was
Out with my friends
And we were chillin' at the club
When you walked in
Said you were staying home
Here you coming not alone
Tell me what the
Is going on
Baby, what goes around
Always comes back around
She'll be the one to
Bring you down

How could I be with
Someone like you (Someone like you)
After all of the things that you
Put me through (Put me through)
How could you lie
Looking straight in my eyes (Straight in my eyes)
Sorry, baby
Not this time

Here I am
All alone
Wondering where it
All went wrong
Guess my love
Was not enough
For you
To stay
Can't believe you did me wrong
I should've known, so now I'm gone
All the things I did for you
All the thing you put me through
Tellin' me you wanna stay with me
While all along you was playin' me
But all the games are gonna stop this time
It worked before, but not this time

With all my trust
And every little kiss
I can't believe you played
Me out

How could I be with
Someone like you (Someone like you)
After all of the things that you
Put me through (Put me through)
How could you lie
Looking straight in my eyes (How could you lie)
Sorry, baby
Not this time (Not this time)
How could I be with
Someone like you
After all of the things that you
Put me through (Yeah, they told me)
How could you lie
Looking straight in my eyes (Straight in my eyes)
Sorry, baby (Yeah, yeah)
Not this time (This time)
How could I be with
Someone like you
After all of the things that you
Put me through (Put me through)
How could you lie
Looking straight in my eyes (Straight in my eye)
Sorry, baby
