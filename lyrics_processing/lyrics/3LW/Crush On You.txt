Boy, I got a crush on you
My dad would kill me if he only knew (Ooh)
Naughty things going through my mind (Ooh-ooh)
When I think of you
Boy, I'm diggin' you (Yeah)
My dad would kill me if he only knew (Yeah, yeah)
Baby girl's been puttin' it down (Ooh-ooh)
When he ain't around

I'll bend some of the rules
When it comes to you
You make me wanna do
(All the things that he said not to)
I call you on the creep
Late at night when my pop's asleep
Gotta keep it on the low
Can't let my daddy know

Baby girl's been puttin' it down
When he ain't around

Is this some crazy dream
Can't stop the way I feel
When I'm alone with you
The pressure is for real
I'm feelin' all these ways
I never felt before
Come here and close the door
A kiss is what I've been waiting for

Kiely is the one getting the busiest
Far from the silliest, tell me are you feelin' this
Not just for little kids, Little Women be
Strong enough, we rock long enough
For real, for the ones that been waitin' to drop
They say, yo shorty rock she be makin' it hot
You know AG she know, Turi she know
Little Women 2000, you know how we go

I'll take my chances, boy (I'll take my chances)
When it comes to you (Boy, with you)
Just name the time and place
Do what I gotta do
My heart is saying yes (My heart is saying yes)
My mind is saying no (To you)
I'll risk it all for you
Daddy don't have to know
