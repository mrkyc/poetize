(G-G-G-G-G-Unit)
Everything 'bout you so gangsta
Oh, you just so gangsta
Ooh, so gangsta
What up, gangsta

My baby
You know I'm lovin' your style and your gangsta touch
Plus, I like the fact that you're kind of rough
I need a thug in my life that will ride, ride, ride
And ride again
Can't complain about the way you lovin' me
And you know I ain't trippin' off your gangsta ways
So, can I be your ride or die for life

I love the way you pull up on them dubs, you know
Everything 'bout you so gangsta
Your white tee throwback with the matching hat
Oh, you just so gangsta
Every good girl wants a thug in her life
Who can put it down so gangsta
From your head down to your Air Force 1's (From your head to your toes)
Boy, you know you just so gangsta

My baby
You know them other papi's ain't got nothin' on you
Can't nobody give me thug lovin' like you
Like in the middle of the night what my body's calling for
Someone to hold me tight
Yeah, I know you're bad, but you treat me good
Yeah, I know you tryna get us out the hood
Gangsta yet a gentleman and I'm so open for ya

I love the way you pull up on them dubs, you know
Everything 'bout you so gangsta (Oh, you know you're so gangsta)
Your white tee throwback with the matching hat (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Oh, you just so gangsta (No-woah, so gangsta)
Every good girl wants a thug in her life
Who can put it down so gangsta (So gangsta)
From your head down to your Air Force 1's
Boy, you know you just so gangsta (Boy, you know you just so gangsta)

This is for my niggas on the block twist and treatin' cigars
For the niggas on lock doin' life behind bars
I don't say only God can judge me cause I see things clear
Crook these crackers'll give my black ass a hundred years
I'm like Paulie in Goodfellas, you can call me the don
Like Malcolm by any means with my gun in my palm
Slim switch sides on me, let niggas ride on me
Would you be down to ride
Ain't nothin' pretty 'bout you cause you's the thug
Type two, wife-beater with a bottle of bud
With ya drop-top, six-four rollin' on dubs
Be bangin' in the trunk when I'm out in the club
Ain't got no rigs to chain cause ya keeps it hood
And all my friends just jealous cause you treat me good
When you're rollin' down the block, everybody holla back
What up gangsta

I love the way you pull up on them dubs, you know
Everything 'bout you so gangsta (Baby, you're likely)
Your white tee throwback with the matching hat
Oh, you just so gangsta (Oh, you just so, so)
Every good girl wants a thug in her life (Gangsta)
Who can put it down so gangsta (Who can put it down)
From your head down to your Air Force 1's
Boy, you know you just so gangsta (Oh)

Hey (Oh)
You know you so gangsta
Yeah, yeah
Aw, so ganstga
You know, you know
Aw, baby
