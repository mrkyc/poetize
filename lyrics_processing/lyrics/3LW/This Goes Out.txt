Mmm
Oh, yeah
Oh, oh
Oh, mmm, yeah

My mom and dem don't like ya, my friends all think you triflin'
But I don't feel quite like them, in fact, I'm out to spite them
The love we share is special, it's on a whole 'nother level
He's firm with me, he's gentle, he's intimate yet mental

(But he's quick to flip) He don't understand
(Street but sweet) My kinda man
(Goes to church) Might be a thug
(He breaks me off) Show a lot of love
(Disrespect) He's off the heezy
(You don't want that) Please, believe me
And that's the only way he knows how to
Show me how much he cares

This goes out to my bandana rockin' out on the blockers
Chasin' that dough, bad baby daddies, first of the month
Child support, all non-votin', Newport smokin'
I still got love for y'all
And this goes out to my third strike parolin', dry Philly rollers
Sittin' on dubs, crystal poppin', loud talkin', frontin'
Drunk in the club, live with you mamma, always in drama
I still got love for y'all
You might also like
Somebody's always hatin', they're always sittin' around waitin'
Till you make a new mistake and get sent back upstate and
And they can just say that I told ya, should've listened when I showed ya
So, why cry on their shoulder, they'll be so glad it's over

(But he's quick to flip) He don't understand
(Street but sweet) He's my kinda man
(Goes to church) Might be a thug
(He breaks me off) Show a lot of love
(Disrespect) He's off the heezy
(You don't want that) You gotta believe me
And that's the only way he knows how to
Show me how much he cares

This goes out to my bandana rockin' out on the blockers (This goes out)
Chasin' that dough, bad baby daddies, first of the month (Chasin' that dough)
Child support, all non-votin', Newport smokin' (Child support)
I still got love for y'all (I still got love, love, love, love, yeah)
And this goes out to my third strike parolin', dry Philly rollers (Dry Philly rollers)
Sittin' on dubs, crystal poppin', loud talkin', frontin' (Sittin' on dubs)
Drunk in the club, live with you mamma, always in drama (Drunk in the club, yeah)
I still got love for y'all (I still got love for you, you)
(La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la)
(La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la) You keep chasin' that dough, yeah
(La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la) Child support

(La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la) And this goes out to my third strike parolin', dry Philly rollers
(La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la) Sittin' on dubs
