Oh
Oh
Yeah

It's been almost a year since we first met
And that's the day that I'll never forget
Got me all caught up in your web
But I knew what was coming next
Cause you're the type of guy girls like to sweat
Just so they can see how far they'll get
Maybe take a ride up in your 6
No, ever in that picture could I fit, woah

Ghetto love and heartbreak (Heartbreak)
Is always a mistake (A mistake)
Trust your heart to someone (Your heart, oh-woah)
When you think you're in love cause you think you're in love
They gon' do their own thing (Their own thing)
Ghetto thugs, they don't change (They don't change)
So. don't give your heart away (Give your heart away)
Cause you think you're in love when you think you're in love

As the days went on I knew
That you were more than sexy, more than cute
Had a little look inside your eyes
That no girl could ever say no to
Much personality
A living game for every girl you see
Know just what to say and how to please
But there's no room there for me (Oh)
You might also like
Ghetto love and heartbreak (Woah, no)
Is always a mistake (Mistake)
Trust your heart to someone (Heart to someone else)
When you think you're in love cause you think you're in love
They gon' do their own thing (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Ghetto thugs, they don't change (Never change)
So, don't give your heart away
Cause you think you're in love when you think you're in love

I tried so hard
To believe you only
Wanted me, but that was just
My fantasy
And you let me down
Playing around like you were
Feelin' me, but you were busy
Doing your thing, thing

Ghetto love and heartbreak (Oh woah)
Is always a mistake (Always a mistake)
Trust your heart to someone
When you think you're in love cause you think you're in love (So in love)
They gon' do their own thing (Love)
Ghetto thugs, they don't change (Do their own thing)
So, don't give your heart away (Give your heart away, no, no, no)
Cause you think you're in love when you think you're in love

Trust your heart to someone (Yeah, yeah)
When you think you're in love cause you think you're in love (When you think you're in love)
They gon' do their own thing (Oh, oh)
Ghetto thugs, they don't change (Ghetto thugs)
So, don't give your heart away (No, no, no, no, no, no)
Cause you think you're in love when you think you're in love

Think you're in love
Then tell me now
What's really up
Oh, oh
If you think I'm the one
I need to know
Don't let me down
Oh, oh
