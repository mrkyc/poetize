Boy, you know

But keep it up, keep it up what you doin' to me

I see him almost every day
I wonder if he has a girl, but it really don't matter to me
Cause I've been waitin' all this time
Waitin' for the day when I can finally make him mine
He's mine, he's mine
All mine, so fine in due time
I'll be rollin' with him, ridin' shotgun
Listening to him tell me, baby, you're the one, yeah

Tell me is you feelin' me, I like what you do
Hope you can feel me like I feel you
Boy, you know you really got me goin' crazy
Forget about them other girls, come and get wit me
Tell me is you feelin' me, I like what you do (Are you feelin' me)
Hope you can feel me like I feel you (I like what you do)
Boy, you know you really got me goin' crazy (Yeah, yeah)
Forget about them other girls, come and get wit me
