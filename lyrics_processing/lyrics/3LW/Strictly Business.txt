See, I've been dealing the two for about six months
And I knew he had a girl, but
We got to touchin', one thing to the next
Had this boy feelin' 'bout to make his girl his ex
He called me up late night, love trippin'
Told him never leave the one you love for the one your hittin'
That's a no-no and I can't let you back in my bed
If you all twisted in the head and shit

(Oh no, no, no, no, no, no)
No, the youngest they're fire, but you're doin' too much for me
(Oh no, no, no, no, no, no)
Don't get it twisted, it's strictly business

Don't get caught up, don't get it twisted
Baby, I ain't yours
You're catching feelings, thought I'd let you know
Right from the door
I ain't the one for all that kissin'
Huggin', holdin' hands
It's strictly business, go to work
This chick don't need a man

Now, let me tell you about this dude that I met once
He was the cocky type to play the girls and had 'em all sprung
But I was dumb, tried to take me for a fool
(Wait till I flip the script on you)
So, I let him get a taste of my grown in sexy
Now, he be tryin' to call and text me
But I ain't (Feelin' it) and its (Killin' him)
Cause I know he be sittin' at home rememberin'
What happened in the back of the rental
Whenever, since then, he been messed up in the mental
But he will never get another chance at this though
Don't get it twisted, its strictly business

Don't get caught up, don't get it twisted
Baby, I ain't yours
You're catching feelings, thought I'd let you know
Right from the door
I ain't the one for all that kissin'
Huggin', holdin' hands
It's strictly business, go to work
This chick don't need a man
Don't get caught up, don't get it twisted
Baby, I ain't yours
You're catching feelings, thought I'd let you know
Right from the door
I ain't the one for all that kissin'
Huggin', holdin' hands
It's strictly business, go to work
This chick don't need a man
So, I guess you didn't understand from the start
That I'm the type of kind of chick that don't give a what
Got you wondering why
I don't give a damn
Gotta let you know
Strictly business, man

Don't get caught up, don't get it twisted
Baby, I ain't yours
You're catching feelings, thought I'd let you know
Right from the door
I ain't the one for all that kissin'
Huggin', holdin' hands
It's strictly business, go to work
This chick don't need a man
Don't get caught up, don't get it twisted
Baby, I ain't yours
You're catching feelings, thought I'd let you know
Right from the door
I ain't the one for all that kissin'
Huggin', holdin' hands
It's strictly business, go to work
