Ooh
Ooh, yeah (Check it out)
Listen

Now, that I think about it, yeah, it's time
See, I've been wondering if you and I
Would finally address what we're feeling
Inside (Side)
I've been fighting it off (I've been fighting)
But every time that I'm around you
I think I'm falling in love, even though
I know I'm not allowed to, baby

I can't help myself, you don't have to tell me
That you're in love with me
Baby, I just want to know if we
Could ever be (Could ever be), ever be more than
Friends

See, every time I hold you, I don't wanna let it go
Don't know no one else to hold you like I do, no
Baby, there no doubt about it, I'ma lose my mind if you don't wait inside me
Cause I'm really curious to experience something inner with me
You don't know how I
Wanna be with you ever since I
Lay eyes on you (Lay eyes on you), I'm crazy for you (I'm crazy for you)
More you got to know, know-oh-oh-oh-ooh
You might also like
I can't help myself, you don't have to tell me (Tell me)
That you're in love with me (You're in love with me)
Baby, I just want to know if we (I just got to know)
Could ever be (Ever be), ever be more than
Friends

You gotta realize (Why) I feel this way inside (I've)
Never had a friend (That) I needed in my life (Oh)
So, now I'm telling you (Oh), so you will know the truth
I got lost in your eyes (Eyes), the first time I saw you (Oh)
No matter what you say (Oh), no matter what you do
I'm gonna be right here, wanting to be with you (Oh)
You know I'm dying
If I can't have you by my side, oh

I can't help myself, you don't have to tell me (Can't help myself, tell me)
That you're in love with me (Tell me you're in love with me)
Baby, I just want to know if we (I just wanna know)
Could ever be (Ever be), ever be more than
Friends (I just wanna know, oh)
Friends (Sing it one more time, oh)
Friends (Can we be more than friends)
