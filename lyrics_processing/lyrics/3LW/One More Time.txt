Lullabies, butterflies
Sad goodbyes make me cry, oh my
They all remind me of you, yeah
In the trees, autumn leaves
Birdies tweet when they look at me
They sing a song about you, yeah

Even the clouds can see it's over
And they can feel my hurt inside
And when the sun comes out tomorrow
Will I feel alright

Come back to me
Dry my tears for me
Won't you hold me
One more time (One more time)
Take my only
Be my only
Come back for me
One more time

One more time (One more time)
One more time, oh (One more time)
One more time (One more time, yeah, yeah)
One more time

Teddy bears, rocking chairs
It's not fair (If one of us not there)
To share these treasures with me, yeah
My reflections shows that I'm alone
On my own waiting by the phone
But I know you won't call for me, yeah

Even the clouds can see it's over
And they can feel my hurt inside
But when the sun comes out tomorrow
Will I feel alright

Come back to me
Dry my tears for me (For me)
Won't you hold me
One more time (One more time)
Take my only (Only)
Be my only (Be my only)
Come back for me
One more time (One more time)

One more time (One more time)
One more time, oh (One more time)
One more time (One more time, yeah, yeah)
One more time
Even the clouds can see it's over
And they can feel my hurt inside
But when the sun comes out tomorrow
Will I feel alright

Come back to me
Dry my tears for me
Won't you hold me (Hold me)
One more time (One more time)
Take my only (Take my only)
Be my only (Be my only)
Come back for me (For me)
One more time (One more time)
Come back to me
Dry my tears for me
Won't you hold me (Won't you hold me)
One more time (One more time)
Take my only (Take my only)
Be my only (Be my only)
Come back for me (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
One more time

One more time (One more time, one more time)
One more time, oh (One more time)

One more time (Yeah, baby)
One more time, time, time
Time, oh, yeah
One more time, yeah, yeah (One more time)
