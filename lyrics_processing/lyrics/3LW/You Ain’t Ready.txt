DJ, play it back, take it from the top

I know this guy, let's call him Ben from the block
He talked shit and swear that he could make it hop
He looked good, but that don't mean that he can rock
Take that sweet stuff, need a man to make it pop

Put on me longtime, say you never stop
School me up and catch me like a freakin' shortstop
Pat me down, search me, boy, like you was a cop
DJ, play it back, take it from the top

I know this guy, remember Ben from the block
Got up with him, but he couldn't make it pop
Looked real good, but couldn't do it non-stop
I told Ben take yo ass down the block

Five minutes, ten minutes, fifteen, twenty
Ya say ya gon' put it down, say ya got plenty
Well, give it to me, give it to me, give it to me Benny
And if you can't, call someone else to get wit me

I need a boy that can rock my body steady
You ain't ready, you ain't ready
I need a boy that can rock my body steady
You ain't ready, you ain't ready
I need a boy that can rock my body steady

So, I called Ben and I'ma give him one more shot
To get me sprung and try to put it on lock
Now, do your best, but you gotta get it right
And if you don't, boy, you can't spend the night

Five minutes, ten minutes, fifteen, twenty
Ya say ya gon' put it down, say ya got plenty
Well, give it to me, give it to me, give it to me Benny
And if you can't, call someone else to get wit me

You ain't ready, you ain't ready
I need a boy that can rock my body steady
You ain't ready, you ain't ready
