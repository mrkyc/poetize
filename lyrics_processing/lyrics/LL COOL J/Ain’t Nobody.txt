Oh my God, you know

I'm the best when it comes to makin' love all night
Throw your butterscotch body beneath the red light
Blaze it up girl, I'ma lace it real tight
Go deep 'til the full moon turn to sunlight
'Til the darkness is gone love remains strong
Like the bond between mother and child, you're so warm to the touch
Passionate interludes is such
When you're gone, your body's what I yearn to clutch (Yearn to clutch)
Just imagine ecstasy floatin' in a cloud (Uh)
Animal attraction burnin' through the crowd (Yeah)
Heaven on Earth, paradise for a price
It's cool though, I'll pay it for the rest of my life, you know why

Ain't nobody does me better
Makes me happy, makes me feel this way
Ain't nobody does me better
(You can take it girl, stop runnin', uh)
(You can take it girl, stop runnin', uh)
(You can take it girl, stop runnin', uh)
You might also like
I'm explorin' your body and your erogenous zones
Like a black tiger caged up, 'til you come home
Lovely, you make a man swoon like a boy
The love is so soft, it gets hard to enjoy
Cause the mind flies, and sometimes the sex lies
Smooth little girls fall in love with rough guys
But you can chop a big heart down to pint size
I guess that's what it sounds like when the dove cries
Uh, the whole world is trapped up in a maze
But you save this real good lovin' for rainy days (Uh)
The lord works in mysterious ways
He must have put you on this Earth for all men to praise

Ain't nobody (Nobody) does me better (Makes me feel)
Makes me happy, makes me feel this way (Say what, say what)
Ain't nobody does me better
(You can take it girl, stop runnin', uh) (Say what)
(You can take it girl, stop runnin', uh) (Say what)
(You can take it girl, stop runnin', uh) (Say what)
(You can take it girl, stop runnin', uh) (Say what)

As I travel through your body our souls become one
Indivisible, uh, it's getting critical son
I'm on the run from love, it chased me out the bag
Get the point boo, you hit it right on the head (Uh)
It's an endless adventure, two bodies collide
King fulfilling dreams with a queen by his side
Forever (Forever), infinite time we intertwine
Destiny, we fall in love by design
What's yours is mine (Uh) and what's mine is yours (Yeah)
The road less travelled is ours to explore
I adore you, heavenly angel shine light
Hold my hand, I'll be your guide through the night (Oh, oh, oh)
Ain't nobody does me better (Ain't nobody)
Makes me happy, makes me feel this way (Come on, come on)
Ain't nobody does me better (Come on, come on)
(You can take it, girl, stop runnin', uh) (Say what?)
(You can take it, girl, stop runnin', uh) (Say what?)
(You can take it, girl, stop runnin', uh) (Say what?)
(You can take it, girl, stop runnin', uh) (Say what?)
(You can take it, girl, stop runnin', uh) (Say what?)

(You can take it, girl, stop runnin', uh) (Say what?)
(You can take it, girl, stop runnin', uh) (Say what?)

Come on now, a man chooses a woman
A woman chooses a man, ha-ha-ha
Give you half for a second
Then I'll give you the full plunge, uh
What you want? What you want? What you want?
Ice out infiltrates the scenery (Ooh), nahmean?
It's bananas, ain't it? Ha-ha-ha

Ain't nobody does me better
Makes me happy, makes me feel this way
Ain't nobody does me better
(You can take it girl, stop runnin', uh)
(You can take it girl, stop runnin', uh)
