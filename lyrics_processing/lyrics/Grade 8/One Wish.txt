Hold me close, tell me lies
This isn't home and this isn't right
Not gonna stand here and wait for something I can't...
Please, please just set me free
I feel the heat so why am I cold
Just can't seem to let you go
Cause' you still want a piece and I need it all
Lights were on when there was no one home
When you'd invite me in and then you'd shut the door
Before I clutched my palm I could feel you stare
Nothing between us but family
So please listen close, my story goes on
Friends are leaving as we're growing old
Count miles back and I'm out the door
So I'd better tell myself I'm never coming home
Everybody says "play by the rules"
Shut your mouth and just play it cool
Go on and pay your dues, forget that!
That's what came before
Stop! Stop! Wait! Wait!
I think we have contact, one second I can't wait
And give me just one chance, chance! Chance! Chance!
I think we have contact, one second I can't wait
And give me just one...
Stop! Stop! Wait! Wait!
I think we have contact, one second I can't wait
And give me just one chance, chance! Chance! Chance!
I think we have contact...

Hold me close, tell me lies
This isn't home and this isn't right
Not gonna stand here and wait for something I can't...
Breath, breath and feel diseased
Well you all can see its not time to leave
How's it feel to be complete?
Don't stop me now cause' I can almost reach
Pull myself out of another hole
Take it to them but don't talk to me
Cause' you can't relate
No need to rush, I'm already late
And in this case my world is erased out and pulled my face down
Straight from the grave and I see tonight
Straight from out my lies, roll your eyes
Cool me down, I need to find
Take my hand in spite of me
Cause' I'm on my knees and I'm begging please
Need a taste of what I crave
What I crave is fate!
Stop! Stop! Wait! Wait!
I think we have contact, one second I can't wait
