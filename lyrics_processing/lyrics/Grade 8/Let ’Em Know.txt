I don't wanna hear this
Look alive when I feel this
Feels like 10 degrees and I won't stop freezing
No keys, no clothes, no hands, no finger prints
No more self-conscience
Smashed right in the glass
And so while we left you were seeing stars
Now I can't just wait here, I'll catch you later
I feel us bleeding, I'll stain the stage red
I'm like the devil I'll show you it all in the end
When your time here is spent
Hocus pocus pince and locus crowd screaming to be set free
Just to let you know
We've frozen our bones
We're here to let you know
Just to show how we roll
We hear to let you know
Just to show how we roll
We hear to let you know
Drop, drop, everybody drop!
We're ripping holes in your living room floors
Grade 8 is just too hot to hold
Now you all can't compete with it
Cause' I'm the one that your dreams have to sleep with
Please nobody see it, cause' we're sick of all the lawyers and executives
Don't know why my life is the way it is
Speaking these subliminal messages
And then I'll make you all crazy kid
Or unless I already did
When all I really want to do is live
Everybody mosh! Everybody shocked!
That we've now dropped flat on our face
Ever had a taste of something great?
Like a drug pumped straight through your veins
I see it and I grab it, I wanna breake a habit
I put it in my pocket, I got it
Crowd screaming to be set free!
Just to let you know
We've frozen our bones
We're here to let you know
Just to show how we roll
We hear to let you know
Just to show how we roll
We hear to let you know
Drop, drop, everybody drop!
We're kicking holes in your living room floors
Everybody knows...
Grade 8 is just too hot to hold
