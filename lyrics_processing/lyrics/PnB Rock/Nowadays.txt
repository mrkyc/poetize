Used to sleep in the crib, no heat on
Put some crates under the bed, just to sleep on
Put some syrup on my bread, just to eat on
Nowadays, look at niggas, we on
Yeah

Yeah I had to boss my life up
Get my change up, had to get my ice up
Get my bands up, had to get my mans up
For the block, yeah I do it for my fam, yeah

Here's a little story bout a nigga named PnB
Know a couple pussy niggas thinking 'bout deleting me
I don't give a fuck though, 'cause I keep that thing with me
When them niggas run into me, keep that same energy
Came from a broken home, momma, she was never home
All our fathers dead and gone, yeah they left us all alone
Momma had to sell crack, 'member niggas took her pack
Robbed her for a fuckin' sack, now we gotta start from scratch
In and out of shelters, felt like God failed us
All these fuckin' family members, ain't nobody help us
It don't even matter though, we gon' be rich one day
'Til then I'm on the block, trappin' up a one-way
Niggas talking crazy they don't want no fuckin' gun play
I'll pull up on that nigga block, on a Sunday
Church day, I'll turn that shit into a hearse day
Every time you see me, I be riding with my 30
Every time you see me, I be slidin' with my 30
Give a opp a 42, feel like James Worthy
Leave a nigga brains on the side, where the curb be
Leave a nigga name on his shirt like a jersey
Opp shit, yeah we pop shit, like a perky
Opp's talking all that hot shit but still ain't hurt me
Niggas disrespect my brother name we gon' murk 'em
Slide through they block, we gon' do them niggas dirty (Yeah)
