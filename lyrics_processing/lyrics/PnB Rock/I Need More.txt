Hitmaka

He can fuck you good, but I can fuck you better
Girl, you can't flex, you know your ex ain't on my level

Pockets swole (But I need more, I need more)
Wrist on froze (But I need more, but I need more)
Copped the Rolls (But I need more, I need more)
Yeah (But I need more)

Who would have ever thought I would be here
Singin', rappin' and makin' these millions?
When I was just posted up, all on the block
I was trappin' right in front of the buildings
Mama said, "Boy, you keep stressing me out
Too caught up in these streets, they gon' kill you"
Then she put me right out in the streets
Where she said I would die, now I ain't got no feelings
Drop the top, now I ain't got no ceilings
I got my Glock when I walk in the building
Got a bad bitch and she how I'm comin'
She know I'm a hunnid, she know I'm the realest
I get the check, she help me count it up
All of these hunnids, yeah we add it up
We be just poppin' them tags, yeah
I don't give a fuck 'bout your past, yeah
You was fuckin' all them lames
Fuckin' all those lames, way before you met me
But you know they ain't better than me
They ain't fucking that check up like me
Don't get that pussy wetter than me
And them niggas ain't flexing like me
I'm the one that invest in your goals
Keep it real, girl, you already know
