I don't really care about this
You talk too much about me
You make things up about me
Never would've came up without me
Your people need love, yeah

I don't really care about this
And I don't ever waste a minute
You talk too much about me
You make things up about me

Why you wanna make things up?
Why you wanna waste my time?
Girl, we used to be in love now
Now I don't really care about you no more
We used to be perfect, now it ain't workin'
All my niggas swervin'
Drop top coupes, girl, you used to be my boo
Now you tellin' lies on me
Shawty, this sad but true
Yeah, yeah, drop top coupes
Girl, you used to ride with me
Girl, you used to slide with me
Now you tellin' lies on me

Never would've came up me
Your people need love

You talk too much about me
Say I don't show you love, you doubt me
I'ma roll one up, get cloudy
When my pockets wasn't up, you wasn't 'round me
Why you wanna roll one up?
Why you keep callin' my line?
Girl, you used too keep it G but
I don't need to smoke one with you
Drop top coupe, girl, you used to be my boo
Now you see my brand new thing
Wishin' you was in her shoes

I don't really care about this
And I don't ever waste a minute
You talk too much about me
