You keep on asking me questions
About who I'm texting, and about who I'm sexing
I can't take it no, no
You keep interrupting my flexin'
Who you think you checking?
Girl you could go get the steppin'
'Cause I can't take it no, no (No, no)

Why you always asking all these questions
I ain't about to be over here stressin'
Thinking about what I'm finna say now
This is starting to be everyday now
Girl you got me and you know it so just don't trip
And don't be texting, asking questions about no hoe shit
'Cause when you ask, that's when it all falls down
If it's meant to be, time will tell
And we was doing good if you asked me
Till you start asking about Tiffany and Ashley
Said you seen my car when we drove right passed you
You said I ain't getting nothing pass you

You keep on asking me questions
About who I'm texting and about who I'm sexing
I can't take it no no
You keep interrupting my flexin'
Who you think you checking?
Girl you could go get the steppin'
'Cause I can't take it no, no
