Could never accept reality in which I was presented
Livin this crazy life for real could make a girl demented
Been on my hands and knees prayin to God for things to change
But every single day it seems like things'll stay the same
But change is for the worse, at times I feel my life's a curse
But who's to blame? ((( me infortations suffocate )))
Multiple bodies felt like rape
Watchin' your whole life fade away
Playin' this world like it's a game
When I'm with you I feel no pain
Now tell me do you feel the same?

Can I hold you down?
How'd it all so grounds?
There's not much I would do to keep you by my side it's true
My love for you is all that could keep me strong
But I'll hold that from you until you tell me what we have is true

Sometimes when I think of all the things I've been through
I wanna take myself out but then I think of you
If there's one thing in this world that I'd rather do than to live and die
Yo, it's just to be with you
And even though I show you love your still a lonely thug
And even when we share are dreams still it ain't enough
Is it me? do I not reach your thoughts?
Or when you get around the fellas do you even talk about me?
Because you know that all I do is think of you
Or do I love you? ain't no way cuz you can't even see me through
Because I live for you, cry for you, lie for you, kill for you and on the real I'll die for you
Every night before I lay I pray that you get home safe
And I can't think straight if I don't know you're okay
I wanna love you, wanna hold you, wanna kiss you, wanna touch you
Can't you see you are my issues?

You are the chase. My better dream, cause I can see much bigger things with you
Imagine me and you

Imagine me and you against the world
Ain't no one who will go all night this boy and girl
Together we ain't trustin none it ain't no fun
But that's life we livin'
