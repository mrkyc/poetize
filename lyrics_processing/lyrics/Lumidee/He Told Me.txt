When I met you at first
I was frontin'
Time passed
Damn, I'm in somethin'
We got caught up and I fell real hard
To tell you the truth
I ain't never go this far
Now we chilling and we laughing and we?
We playing house in the crib
Who'd imagine?
A lot of people wanna see us apart
And at the time
I ain't never take the shit to heart
'Cause we was too tough
They ain't buggin' us
They could throw it your way
You ain't fuckin' up
But as the years go on
You do this shit to make me question
Are we still that strong?

Well, he told me
He's never ever gonna leave me lonely
And I just can't figure out why
No, I just can't figure out why
You might also like
Now a days I'm always flipping' bout nothing
It's my fault
It's looking like something
Your new habits
Turning off your phone
And your bullshit story is
When you come back home
Is it all in my mind?
Am I dumb?
Love is blind
'Cause I keep dealing with the same shit all the time
As soon as you get caught in the mix
It ain't you it's your man
And you ain't doing shit
It's just the little things you do
That make it seem to me like you ain't true
But I'm tired of stressing you
And if it ain't true
I just want the best from you

Do what you want, my love
If I'm what you want, my love
Then baby
Be true cause I'm through to you
And we'll make it through
So just play your part for me
Just play your part
So just play your part
Play your part
So just play your part for me


It takes two to make it me and you
