Lumidee and Mr. Lover again
No girls no, ana hol ya tyt
Straight till tha morning light
Sweetness to your delight
The only man to do ya right
Yano im here to make ya night
Take things to higher height
No need to stress, baby, look, blow out the candlelight
Me yano I love the chase, rude boy upon ya case
Up an leave tha mami with tha body and tha pretty face
The Lumidee and Mr. Lover again
The Lumidee and Mr. Lover again

Sittin' in the park watching winter turn to spring
(Well, everything feel so nice, gurl, me wa ya2no yano ya spice up my life)
Walking in the park watching lovers do their thing
(I feel the same way, hot like a yoyo runnin' down from ya face)

This time I feel like makin' love with you
This time I feel like makin' dreams come true

When ya talk to me speaking in your sexy tone
(Jus tha tone of mi voice, why ya bin so difficult, am the only choice)
When ya holdin' me, I don't want ya to let go
(Yano ya feel mi heart rate, poundin'n'poundin straight up an agot the shakes)

So here wi go pretty, baby, gimme ya love, love, love
All night 'till tha mornin, sweet love, love, love
When ya catch me in tha tub a rub, dub, dub
Inseparable, addictive like a drug, drug, drug
Ya want me life ina giv ya n mi heart and mi soul
Love till eternally, mi ultimate goal
Cha, forever ina ma life to have 'n' to hold
No together, you n me can make some late night stroll

This time I feel like makin' love with you
