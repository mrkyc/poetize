Listen baby I've been around
I know that you like how I wear my crown
And I know that I'm something that is so profound
So far what I'm hearing look I like the sound
Everybodys talkin about it
We could be talkin why would you doubt it
Your plams are sweaty and your heart sounds poundin'
This is what you're feeling tell me about it

She's like the wind
Through my tree
(Vaby yea baby yea)
She rides the night
Next to me
Like you won't believe (no)
She leads me through moonlight
Only to burn me with the sun
Damn it I believe she knows
She's taken' my heart
She doesn't know what she's done
Baby please

I feel her breath on my face (baby I can feel)
Her body close to me (her body close to me)
Can't look in her eyes (can't look in your eyes)
She's outta my league (she's outta my league oh)
Just a fool to believe
She's got everything I need
She's like the wind
You might also like
If you can't conceive it muffin
Cause you just let it be its nothing
Look we just hangin around
Sneakin' a look
When I can just put you down

Girl I look in the mirror (what you see what you see)
And all I see (tell me what u see girl, tell you I can feel this baby)
Is a young old man with only a dream (Ohh oh oh)
Am I just fooling myself (yea)
Thinkin she'll stop the pain (yes she will yes she will)
Living without her
I'd go insane
Damn it I believe she knows

I feel her breath on my face (baby I can feel)
Her body close to me (her body close to me)
Can't look in her eyes (can't look in your eyes)
She's outta my league (she's outta my league oh)
Just a fool to believe
She's got everything I need
She's like the wind
Look I'm right here
Come on toughin' up
Boo get it together and just try you luck
Ever since I heard you got this little crush I
Pass you way and it's giving me a rush
So I peeped your style
Yes I'm impressed
Always with the best
Put them other dudes to rest
So you ain't got to stress cause I got what you need
I could ease your pain and fulfill all your dreams
Just a fool to believe
She got anything I need (take that)

I feel her breath on my face (baby I can feel)
Her body close to me (her body close to me)
Can't look in her eyes (can't look in your eyes)
She's outta my league (she's outta my league oh)
Just a fool to believe
She's got everything I need
She's like the wind

If you can't conceive it muffin
Cause you just let it be its nothing
Look we just hangin around
Sneakin' a look
When I can just put you down
