I can see right through you
You're a playa like the rest of them
Had big had little had rim on the low too
Only difference is i really think that you're cute
The way you carry yourself, so full of confidence
Got your little swagger that's just short of arrogance
1 night, 2 chains, fresh fit and new boots
(Chorus)
I wish that i could be your girl (be your girl)
She must be a lucky girl (lucky girl)
Cute boy do do you have a girl let me know (cute boy)
I wish that i could be your girl (be your girl)
She must be a lucky girl (lucky girl)
Cute boy do do you have a girl let me know (cute boy)
(Verse 2)
I'm waitin on you
Hopin' that you make a move
If you feelin' me because i'm really into you
I'm tripping cause i don't really stress any dudes like that
When i look in your eyes i can see your disguise
In the back of your mind, you're thinkin' of being mine
She don't hold you down the way i can
That's a fact
You might also like(Chorus)
I wish that i could be your girl (be your girl)
She must be a lucky girl (lucky girl)
Cute boy do do you have a girl let me know (cute boy)
I wish that i could be your girl (be your girl)
She must be a lucky girl (lucky girl)
Cute boy do do you have a girl let me know (cute boy)
(Bridge)
Cute boy
I think you're really cute boy
Cute boy.. i gotta have you
(Rap)
I see you comin' through boy
Lookin' like a rude boy
Just the way i like it and that's the truth boy
So i chill for a minute
Sat back and observe
What kind of chicks you checkin'
Right before i step in
Do you like the thick ones or slim ones with curves
I peeped your whole style you don't watch them birds
So you gon feel the girl that's no question
If you know that i'm the one then there's no second guessin'
(Chorus)
I wish that i could be your girl (be your girl)
She must be a lucky girl (lucky girl)
Cute boy do do you have a girl let me know (cute boy)
I wish that i could be your girl (be your girl)
She must be a lucky girl (lucky girl)
