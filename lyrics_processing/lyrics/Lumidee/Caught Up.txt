I'm up in the spot and I'm feeling the heat
Boppin my head real smooth to the beat
Go to the bar get me a drink
I ready see something but I'm moving discreet
So I'm checking homie and I'm watchin his move
Just like the way he do that thing that he do
Actin like he ain't got nothing to lose
I'm feelin your vibe got nothing to prove
You dont even see no one
They got all eyes on you
They are star's and your the sun
You light off all the room
Na ,na, na, na, na, na, na, na
You got me caught up in your game
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
It ain't the shine's that made me say
Na ,na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Boy you dont know what you do
Na ,na ,na, na, na, na, na, na
You got me trippin over you
Now It's coming towards the end of the night
And I ain't really have nothing else in my sight
So I think I'm about to go blow my cool
Stop playin game's and just approach you
I'm here with my girl's ,but they out in a minute
It's just me and you all up in my vision's
I sent a little kite ,like is it ahight
If we got to know each other the rest of the night
You might also likeWe dont even see no one
They got all eye's on you
They are star's but your the sun
You light up all the room
Na ,na, na, na, na, na, na, na
You got me caught up in your game
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
It ain't the shine's that made me say
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Boy you dont know what you do
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
You got me trippin over you
If you going to roll with me
Take it slow let's see
What can make up
Cause night before we wake up
I got no where to be just focus on this thing
Where they can take us right before we lay up
You dont even see no one
They got all eye's on you
They are star's but your the sun
You light up all the room
Na ,na, na, na, na, na, na, na
You got me caught up in your game
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
It ain't the shine's that made me say
Na ,na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Boy you dont know what you do
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
