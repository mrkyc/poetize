Wish I had spoke a lil more to you
But I was just passin' thru (now i regret it daily)
Thinkin back when I was just a girl
The blocks n me was my whole world
And then I slowly see faces change
People they bounce away
Others cannot lose their life
Damn it ain't the same
I come back around away
What more can I say
Damn I miss Lil J, Damn I miss Lil J

I've been there, you've been there
Can't explain the feelin (feelin, feelin)
I've been there, you've been there
Can't explain the feelin (feelin, feelin)

Thinkin back when I was just a girl
My pops n me was my whole world (n how i love him crazy)
Caught up in the era of them days
But still my love would never change
He was just down the street from me
But worlds away
N I never understand the poison in your face
Even though you ain't raise us
Your last years they saved us
You will always be my king and it's because you are ?
You might also like
I've been there, you've been there
Can't explain the feelin (feelin, feelin)
I've been there, you've been there
Can't explain the feelin (feelin, feelin)

Damn Dee, I swear I wish you was here
Tougher than love or, nah you never had no fear
I ain't no how much you meant, until ya was gone
Wish that you could hear my songs n
Just sing along hopin you was watchin the kids
N seein they've grown
So many things to say that I with could pick up a phone
Ya got caught up with that monster
Damn though me too
Some times I think what the boys could be
If they had you
But the family's so strong
N we always pull through
We got some angels on our side
And I know that that's the truth

I've been there, you've been there
Can't explain the feelin (feelin, feelin)
I've been there, you've been there
