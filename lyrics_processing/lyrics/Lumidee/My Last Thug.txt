Ay, yo
I'm there for you
Care for you
But never fail you
And when shit get rough
I'm there to bail you
Inhale
Exhale
Release some pressure
Expectations so high
That it's hard to measure
Soft as feathers
At the same
Tough as leather
And if you ask me
No one pulls it off better
Listen, I ain't a sucker for love
Sometimes a sucker for thugs
I find it appealing
They make living rough
If they weak
They fold
There's no need for those
There's way too many killers in the streets, you know
I need one real life
To keep up my vibe
You might also likeCause it's kinda hard to tame a dame
If you can't ride
Want you by my side
Now I made you a need
Got so attached that night
That I can't even sleep
Can't get mad at you
I'll have to practice, boo
Even find it so hard to catch an attitude
Ask it
I'm saying it ain't cool, ya see
But for now
That's just how i choose to be

I don't really wanna tell you lies
But it's hard for me to say that I'm crying
At night
Done held my pillow tight
And I pray to the Lord if he make this right
I swear if you let me have him
This'll be my last one
I swear if you let me have him
This'll be my last thug
I swear if you let me have him
This'll be my last one
I swear if you let me have him
This'll be my last thug
Every type of man
Gets stuck in situations
Now that I'm left here alone
I'm waiting
I'm patient to see
What will make of his pleads
Don't make this another game
I played 'em
Was cheap
I understand
When it comes to the streets
Not too often I speak
So if I do
Listen to me
Never steer you wrong
Plenty visions
I see
Won't hate on ya hustle
I ain't new to a struggle
You came to me puzzled
And I put you together
Wanna stay with you
If it get worse or better
When we first met
You said if I had to choose
Would it be boots and jeans?
Or slacks and shoes?
All my life
I stuck to only things I knew
And I have no regrets
Cause it led me to you
So I roll with you
And no one else knows
Ain't worried 'bout how good your cash flow
I got you
You got me
Real like that
Let's keep this right


If I told you once
Then I told you twice
Can't be the wife of a man
Who can't roll the dice
You gots to take a chance
Cause you live one life
If it's wrong
It's wrong
If it's right
It's right
Ain't never been the type to live off dreams
I stick around through happy days
And fucked up scenes
Don't wanna put you through pressure
So I ask little questions
Stay
Playing it cool
Just to keep your attention
This feeling is new to me
And truthfully
At times I could say things to confuse
You see
Don't know how to act
So on some things I slack
Want to give you my all
But then I push it all back
Sometimes I'm not sure
About the feelings you have
Maybe it goes both ways
Cause who don't got a past
I guess I'm kinda scared
I've never fallen so fast
But if you say you love me
Then I'mma hold you to that
