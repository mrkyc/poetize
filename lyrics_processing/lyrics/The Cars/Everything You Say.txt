Twirling wildly in the light
But I know honey
It won't take long
It feels like
It's one on one on one
There must have been a dream in you
A stick and fall and follow through
But I know honey
It won't take long
It feels like
It's much too strong too strong
But then you tell me that you can't go on
And you think you're losing sight
Don't you worry
You can't go wrong inside
Everything you say
Oh, leaves me full of shine
Everything you say
Well, crosses up my mind
Everything you say
You might also likeWell, you could twist a little while
Lie there falling for a smile
Well, I know honey
You won't give in
It feels like
When you begin you're in
But then you tell me that you can't resist
When something happens that you like
You want to know
That you've been kissed goodnight
Everything you say (everything you say)
Just leaves me full of shine (ooh-ooh-ooh)
Everything you say (everything you say)
Well, crosses up my mind (ooh-ooh-ooh)
Everything you say
When you know it's not for real
But I know honey
For one long time
It feels like
You're endlessly entwined
But when I know it's what you did
You can't be in a broken binge
Well, take my heart, it's only tin
Well, you got me going
Everything you say (everything you say)
Well, leaves me full of shine (ooh-ooh-ooh)
Everything you say (everything you say)
Just crosses up my mind (ooh-ooh-ooh)
Everything you say (everything you say)
And everything you do (ooh-ooh-ooh)
Everything you say (everything you say)
Makes me want to be with you, yeah (ooh-ooh-ooh)
And that's everything you say
Everything you say
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Everything you say (everything you say)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Everything you say (everything you say)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
