And my old man's got eyes of blue and green
But you took me dancing when our lovers weren't around
You called it losing time in the in-between
It could be all the booze we drank in Austin
Or could be we're just scared of growing old
Could be this ain't no way of living
But there ain't nothing like that rock 'n roll

And when that light shines on you
You know it soothes my soul
Finding time to lose with you
Is water in the dust bowl
I got arms to hold me every night
But I'm still sleeping with a ghost
And your kisses are so sweet and slow
It feels alright, as long as they don't know
We rolled out of a hotel room in Georgia
Just in tie to say a quick goodbye
But you don't even look over your shoulder
You're thinking how you'll look your baby in the eye

And when that light shines on you
You know it soothes my soul
Finding time to lose with you
Is water in the dust bowl
I got arms to hold me every night
But I'm still sleeping with a ghost
And your kisses are so sweet and slow
It feels alright, as long as nobody knows
You might also likeSweet like sugarcane
Slow like a midnight train
You like to call me every now and then
And I just can't wait to lose some time again

Cause when that light shines on you, babe
You know it soothes my soul
And finding time to lose with you
Is water in the dust bowl
I got arms to hold me every night
But I'm still sleeping with a ghost
And your kisses are so sweet and slow
It feels alright, as long as nobody knows
