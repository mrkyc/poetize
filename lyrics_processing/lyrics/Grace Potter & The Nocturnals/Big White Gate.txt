My body's aching from laying in this bed
I went singing in the rain and the cold got to my head
I don't know who's paying, I just know what the doctor said
84 years of a sinning life and in the morning, I'll be dead
I had three daughters, a new man for every one
The only man that I ever loved left me with my only son
I was a no-good mother, I was a no-good wife
There's only one thing that I did right in this godforsaken life

So Saint Peter, won't you open up the big white gate?
Cause I heard about forgiveness and I hope it ain't too late
I ain't no holy roller, but you go tell your king
That all the folks up in Heaven might like to hear me sing

I sang to my children before they strayed so far
I sang for my lovers, or a nickel in a tip jar
I never knew Jesus, I never read the good book
But on my day of dying, I'm giving life a second look

So, Saint Peter, won't you open up the big white gate?
'Cause I heard about forgiveness and I hope it ain't too late
I ain't no holy roller, but you go tell your king
That all the folks up in Heaven might like to hear me sing
You might also like
It's coming on time now, and my body's getting cold
I got no will, I got no prayer, my story's all been told
I'm ready for the land of fire, but I'd love to see the land of gold
So nurse, bring me my guitar; one more song before I go

So, Saint Peter, won't you open up the big white gate?
Cause I heard about forgiveness and I hopin' that it ain't too late
I ain't no holy roller, but you go tell your king
That all the folks up in Heaven might like to hear me sing
