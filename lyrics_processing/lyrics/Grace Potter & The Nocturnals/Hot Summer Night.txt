Uh, uh
Oh

The mercury's risin'
And there ain't no disguisin' what you do
Do, do, do to me
Uh
It won't stop rainin'
And there ain't no explainin' why I feel
Feel, feel a warm summer breeze
Oh, babe, you make me feel like

It's a hot summer night
Even though it's the middle of the winter and it's really bad weather
It's a hot summer night
When I'm next to you, baby, oh

The weather is frightful
But if you stay for the night, it'll be like a long
Long, long day at the beach
Uh
Don't let it go to waste
'Cause, baby, just a taste would be sweeter
Sweeter, sweeter than a Georgia peach, oh
Babe, you make me feel like
You might also like
It's a hot summer night
Even though it's the middle of the winter and it's really bad weather
It's a hot summer night
When I'm next to you, baby
Oh, it's a hot summer night
Even though it's the middle of the winter and it's really bad weather
It's a hot summer night
When I'm next to you, baby, yeah

I took my temperature and told my brain to rearrange
'Cause the thermometer was sayin' something very strange
Outside my window, it was lookin' like a winterland
But here inside, we were lovin' in the sand

On a hot summer night
Even though it's the middle of the winter and it's really bad weather
It's a hot summer night
When I'm next to you, baby, baby
It's a hot summer night
Even though it's the middle of the winter and it's really bad weather
It's a hot summer night
When I'm next to you
It's a hot summer night, hot summer night
Baby, it's a hot summer night, hot summer night
A hot summer night, it's a hot summer night
Hot summer night, hot summer night

Oh, it's a hot summer night
Even though it's the middle of the winter and it's really bad weather
It's a hot summer night
When I'm next to you, when I'm next to you

Oh, it's a hot summer (It's a hot summer night)
Hot summer (Even though it's the middle of the winter)
Hot summer night (And it's really bad weather)
Yeah
It's a hot summer (It's a hotter summer night)
Hot summer (When I'm next to you)
Hot summer night
Baby, baby
It's a hot (Hot summer night)
