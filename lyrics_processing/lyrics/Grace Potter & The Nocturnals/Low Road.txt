A-ooh, a-ooh
A-ooh, a-ooh

I lost everything, I fell out of a daydream
At the door of a long-lost friend
And I cried aloud without an inch of pride
I knew that I had reached the end
An old and lonely man saw me sitting on the curb
He reached out and he took my hand
He said, "I know your song and I know your name
And there was a time that I felt the same"

But it's a low, low road you gotta roll down
Before you find your way, my friend
And it's a high, high hill you've gotta climb up
Before you get to the top again

A-ooh, a-ooh
A-ooh, a-ooh

I held on so dearly
To the wrong things in my life
But now I see so clearly
I was walking into my own knife
You got to get up off that street, stop looking at your feet
And take a hold of something real
And this old man took my hand
He looked at me and said, "Little girl, I understand"
You might also like
That it's a low, low road you gotta roll down
Before you find your way, my friend
And it's a high, high hill you've gotta climb up
Before you get to the top again

And there was a time that I thought that I knew it all
And there was a place that I thought I could call my own
But it all came crashin' down and I looked around
And I knew that things would never be the same

Low, low road you gotta roll down
Before you find your way, my friend
And it's a high, high hill you've gotta climb up
Before you get to the top again
Oh, it's a low, low road you gotta roll down
Before you find your way, my friend
And it's a high, high hill you've gotta climb up
Before you get to the top again

A-ooh, a-ooh
A-ooh, a-ooh
'Cause it's a low, low road you gotta roll down
