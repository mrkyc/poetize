Policy woman got a hold on my baby
Since she come around, he ain't been the same
Ooh, she look at him with her dark brown eyes
She tell him things that would make a grown man cry

Policy woman took the love from my lover
He's been in a haze since the day that he saw her
Ooh, she shook her hips and her long black hair
Now all my baby does is stare at the gypsy woman, uh, uh

Oh, you like the way she makes you feel
She got you spinnin' on her medicine wheel
She's crossin' me with magnetic sand
She hypnotize with her mojo hand

She got the medicine that everybody wants
She got the medicine that everybody wants
She got the medicine that everybody wants
She got the medicine that everybody wants, yeah

Policy woman came a-rolling into town
She got all the gentlemen to follow her down
Ooh, she found the diamonds hidden in the drain

Deep in the night when no one's around
I got a plan to take that woman down, oh

She got the medicine that everybody wants

She got the medicine that everybody wants

Her fast-luck oil and her magic stones
