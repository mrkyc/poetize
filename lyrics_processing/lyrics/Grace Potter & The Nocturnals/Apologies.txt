Yesterday, he said my eyes
Were fading fast away
I said, "Well, what do you expect?
You asked me not to stay
And if it'd all been for the best
I wouldn't feel this way"
He said
Oh, he said

He said it's crazy
How love stays with me, yeah
You know and it hurts me
'Cause I don't wanna fight this war
And it's amazing
To see me reading through this scene
Of love and fear
And apologies
Apologies

My love is like a blanket
That gets a little bit too warm sometimes
I wanna wrap somebody in it
Who can hold me in his arms
'Cause when it got a little too hot in there
He was always stepping out for air
And he froze
Oh, he froze
You might also like
But he says it's crazy
How love stays with me, yeah
You know and it hurts me
'Cause I don't wanna fight this war
And it's amazing
To see me reading through this scene
Of love and fear
And apologies
Apologies

Yesterday, he looked at me
With a tear in his eye and said
"I'll always tell you you're my friend
I hope I don't have to lie
'Cause it's clear you love another man"
And I said, "You're damn right"
And he said
Oh, he said

He said it's crazy
How love stays with me, yeah
You know and it hurts me
'Cause I don't wanna fight this war
And it's amazing
To see me reading through this scene
Of love and fear
And apologies
He says it's crazy
How love stays with me, yeah
You know and it hurts me
That I didn't figure it out before
And now it's too late for a soliloquy
Way too late for dignity
It's time
For apologies
Apologies
Apologies
