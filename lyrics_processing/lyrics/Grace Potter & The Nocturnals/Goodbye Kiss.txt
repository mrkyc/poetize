I lost a piece of my mind
And you can see it on my face
And my heart is burning this time
But there ain't no fire escape

Oh, that little part of me
That used to be so strong
Is stumbling over
Now that I know you're moving on and

You were never gonna wait for me
Babe, I really hate to say it
But I'm gonna say it anyway
You, you know you're not the only one
Who'd rather just cut and run
And shut the blind on yesterday
So let's just call this what it is
And give me one more goodbye kiss

I thought that you were the only one
Who could keep my feet on the ground
I came home to an empty room
And a note that you're leaving town
You might also like
Oh, that little part of me
That's gone for good
That was the only thing
Making me do the things I should and

You were never gonna wait for me
Babe, I really hate to say it
But I'm gonna say it anyway
You, you know you're not the only one
Who'd rather just cut and run
And shut the blind on yesterday
So let's just call this what it is
And give me one more goodbye kiss

Oh, you really, really made it hard on me
Oh, you really, really let me make believe
Oh, you really, really were a mystery
But now I've solved it and I'm sad to say I see that

You were never gonna wait for me
Oh, babe, I really hate to say it
But I'm gonna say it anyway
You, you know you're not the only one
Who'd rather just cut and run
And shut the blind on yesterday
So let's just call this what it is
And give me one more goodbye kiss
Oh
