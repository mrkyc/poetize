Let me be your first time, let me be your last
Celebrate your highs that lift you when you crash
The only name you breathe
Let me be, let me be
Let me be your slow song, let me be your fast
The thought rolling off your tongue, your pocket full of cash
The dream when you sleep
Let me be, let me be

Woah, the night you won't forget
Woah, the words you don't regret
Your one and only
Let me be, let me be
Woah, your Make a Wish that comes true
Woah, the one you always run to
Your one and only
Let me be, let me be

Let me be the secret you spill in the dark
That puts you back together when you fall apart
The heart on your sleeve
Let me be, let me be
Your balance when you walk along the edge
The out from under when you're in over your head
The reason you believe
Let me be, let me be
You might also like
Woah, the night you won't forget
Woah, the words you don't regret
Your one and only
Let me be, let me be
Woah, your Make a Wish that comes true
Woah, the one you always run to
Your one and only
Let me be, let me be

I gave you bats, not butterflies
I know you suffer through the lies
You're still the only one for me
But let me be, let me be

Let me be your first time, let me be your last
Celebrate your highs that lift you when you crash
The reasons you believe...

Woah, the night you won't forget
Woah, the words you don't regret
Your one and only
Let me be, let me be
Woah, your Make a Wish that comes true
Woah, the one you always run to
Your one and only
Let me be, let me be
Woah, the night you won't forget
Woah, the words you don't regret
Your one and only
Let me be, let me be
