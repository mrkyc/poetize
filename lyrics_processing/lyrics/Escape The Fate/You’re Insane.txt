I'll take you back to the beginning
I was awoken to screams
The day that I realized there was a devil in me
Who gives a fuck
If I'm a sinner conceived
By the flames you know immaculate conception is me

But we started broken hearted
Falling apart at the seams
Don't blame me for your problems
You should fix yourself before you're gonna fix me

Stand back as your world decays
I can't explain why you're falling apart
You need to find someone else to blame
For the hurt and the pain
I'm not the reason that you're insane

Feels like I'm living in a madhouse
The smoke and mirrors deceive
The devil in me shivers every time that you breathe
Breathe down my neck
Go take your pills and get out
I don't understand what the fuck you're screaming about
You might also like
We're falling downward spiral
Please just let me be released
Don't blame me for your problems
You should save yourself before you're gonna save me

Stand back as your world decays
I can't explain why you're falling apart
You need to find someone else to blame
For the hurt and the pain
I'm not the reason that you're insane
Yeah, I know we've seen some better days
Now that explains why we're falling apart
You need to find someone else to blame
For the hurt and the pain
I'm not the reason that you're insane

Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
I'm not the reason that you're insane

Stand back as your world decays
I can't explain why you're falling apart
You need to find someone else to blame
For the hurt and the pain
I'm not the reason that you're insane
Yeah, I know we've seen some better days
Now that explains why we're falling apart
You need to find someone else to blame
For the hurt and the pain
I'm not the reason that you're insane
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
