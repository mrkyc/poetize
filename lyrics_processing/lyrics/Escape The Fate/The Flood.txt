Oh, come on!

I can't believe
The drama that I'm in
The flood is getting closer
I don't think they know that I know how to swim
You're feeling numb, from all that has become
It leaves your gums, slips down your tongue
And travels fast down towards your lungs
All because I (leaving you behind)

I feel the pressure
It's coming down on me
It's turning me black and blue!
Oh whoa
You left me on the side of the road
(side of the road)
And now I've got no place to go
You brought the flood!
Wow

I can't believe
The troubles that you've caused
The pain is getting stronger
Like an open wound without the gauze
It's on my brain, driving me insane
It's on my mind all of the time and if it left I would be fine
All because I (leaving you behind)
You might also like
I feel the pressure
It's coming down on me
It's turning me black and blue!
Oh whoa
You left me on the side of the road
(side of the road)
And now I've got no place to go
You brought the flood!

Leave it behind!
I take it back (take it back!)
Leave it be!
I take it back (take it back!)
Leave it be!
Leave it be!
Leave it behind!

I feel the pressure
It's coming down on me
It's turning me black and blue!
Oh whoa
You left me on the side of the road
(side of the road)
And now I've got no place to go
You brought the flood!
I feel the pressure
It's coming down on me
It's turning me black and blue!
Oh whoa
You left me on the side of the road
(side of the road)
And now I've got no place to go
You brought the flood!

I take it back (take it back!)
Leave it be!
I take it back (take it back!)
Leave it be!
Leave it be!
