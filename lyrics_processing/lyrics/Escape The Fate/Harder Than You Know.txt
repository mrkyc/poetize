You said this could only get better
There's no rush cause we have each other
You said this would last forever
But now I doubt if I was your only lover

Are we just lost in time?
I wonder if your love's the same
Cause I'm not over you

Baby, don't talk to me
I'm trying to let go
Not loving you is harder than you know
Cause girl you're driving me so crazy

How can I miss you if you never would stay?
If you need time I guess I'll go away (I'll go away)
Inside me now there's only heartache and pain
So where's the fire, you've begun the rain

Are we just lost in time?
I wonder if your love's the same
Cause I'm not over you

Baby, don't talk to me
I'm trying to let go
Not loving you is harder than you know
Cause girl you're driving me so crazy

And if you don't want me then
I guess I'll have to go (I guess I'll have to go)
Not loving you is harder than you know
(Yeah)

So I'll make the call
And I'll leave today
I'm gonna miss you cause I love you baby
Yeah, I'll make the call
I'm leaving today
And leaving always drives me crazy

Leaving always drives me crazy
Baby, don't talk to me
I'm trying to let go
Not loving you is harder than you know
(Yeah)
Baby, don't talk to me
I'm trying to let go
Not loving you is harder than you know
Cause girl you're driving me so crazy

And if you don't want me then
I guess I'll have to go (I guess I'll have to go)
Not loving you is harder than you know
Girl you're driving me so crazy

Baby, don't talk to me
I'm trying to let go
Not loving you is harder than you know
