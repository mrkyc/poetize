He had a plan to kill you all along
The evidence was hidden in this song
I was a ghost, I was there at the scene
As the embers rise, my hands smelled like gasoline

So, the head lights murdered my thoughts
I curse this taste that's on my tongue. This taste will last until I rip it out
No, I won't need these gloves
Her bones are withered away, but her ghost will remain

You're the only one that wore your seatbelt, we're the only ones that cried
Catastrophic accident. You're the only one that died

So, keep my casket closed
Your heart beats under the floor
It haunts me in my dreams
And nothing's as it seems

Hallelujah, whoa

So, just believe in me. I'll never let you down
This was a curse I can say as you lie in your grave
You might also like
You're the only one that wore your seatbelt, we're the only ones that cried
Catastrophic accident. You're the only one that died

So, keep my casket closed
Your heart beats under the floor
It haunts me in my dreams
And nothing's as it seems

But her ghost will remain as you lie in your grave
But her ghost will remain as you lie in your grave

All the choices you've made and the paths that I take
You're the only one that died. The evidence was hidden in this song
All the choices you've made and the paths that I take
We're the only ones that cried. Irrelevant, I knew it all along
All the choices you've made and the paths that I take
It was never enough, it was never enough it was never enough, now was it?

So, keep my casket closed
Your heart beats under the floor
It haunts me in my dreams
But nothing's as it seems, whoa
So keep my casket closed
Your heart beats under the floor
It haunts me in my dreams
But nothing's as it seems, whoa
So keep my casket closed
Your heart beats under the floor
It haunts me in my dreams
