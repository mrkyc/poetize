All of their bodies around me
I hear their voices inside
The battle's over
This war has been won
Visions haunt me in my dreams
Visions of what I've done
So much bloodshed
Now am I worthy to come home?

My God forgive me
For all of the bodies
I've taken in battle
Oh God don't forsake me

I will stand right by your side
I have made it through the fight
Now I'm coming home
Now I'm coming home
I will stand right by your side
I have made it through the fight
Now I'm coming home
Now I'm coming home
You might also like
I've been knee-deep in water
It's time to be set free
So devastated
The damage has been done
So violated. Like I've been
Raped and left for dead
I'm lying naked
I'm lying naked on the floor

My God forgive me
For all of the bodies
I've taken in battle
All's fair in love and war

I will stand right by your side
I have made it through the fight
Now I'm coming home
Now I'm coming home
I will stand right by your side
I have made it through the fight
Now I'm coming home
Now I'm coming home
I will stand right by your side
I have made it through the fight
Now I'm coming home
Now I'm coming home
Yeah, I'm coming home
Yeah! I'm coming home
This is the last time I
Raise a fist to fight
Reach out your hands to me
And let's just disappear
This is the last time I
Raise a fist to fight
Reach out your hands to me
Let's just disappear
I will stand right by your side
I have made it through the fight
Now I'm coming home
I'm coming...

I will stand right by your side
I have made it through the fight
Now I'm coming home
Now I'm coming home
I will stand right by your side
I have made it through the fight
Now I'm coming home
Now I'm coming home
Yeah, I'm coming home (ooh)
Yeah, Yeah, I'm coming home (ooh)
I'm coming home (ooh)
This is the last time I
Raise a fist to fight
Reach out your hands to me
Let's just disappear (ooh)
