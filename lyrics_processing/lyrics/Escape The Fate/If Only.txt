There's so many things we left undone, so much we didn't do
Still got that shirt you let me borrow that I never returned to you
So many things I should've done, but I always got off track
Here's the money that I owe you, that you never asked for back
'Cause you never asked for anything, not anything at all
Except once in a while you'd ask if I could give you a call
How I wish that I had listened then, how I wish I gave a damn
How I wish that I could call you now just to tell you how I am

If only I had found the time
If only I had even tried
If only I had done enough
Having to let you go wouldn't have to hurt so much

Since the day you left us things just haven't been the same
My family hasn't spoken since the day you went away
If only you could see us now I know you'd be ashamed
Can you send me a sign from heaven and help us change our ways?

If only I had found the time
If only I had even tried
If only I had done enough
Having to let you go wouldn't have to hurt so much
You might also like
I can hear your voice in everything, in every single song
And it's tough holding my head up high, still knowing that you're gone
These times are so confusing, but I know that in the end
We will spread our wings and fly away the day we meet again
Don't leave, I need you now

If only I had found the time
If only I had even tried
If only I had done enough
Having to let you go wouldn't have to hurt so much
I need you now
If only I had found the time
If only I had even tried
If only I had done enough
