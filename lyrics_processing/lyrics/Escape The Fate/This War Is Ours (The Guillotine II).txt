We have to find a better way
Out of this tragedy
As the battle rages on
Blood stains the ground we're on
My ears hear only screams
Brave soldiers are dying
One Spartan stands alone and shouts
This war is ours
This war is ours!

Yes, I will see you
Through the smoke and flames
On the frontlines of war
We have to find a better way
And I will stand my ground until the end
'Til we conquer them all
We have to find a better way

Through the fire and the flames
A sea of dead drives men insane
We are defiant to the call
This is as far as it will go
The battle ends on top of here
This is where we conquer fear
On blackout armed with our swords
This war is ours
Yeah
This war is ours!

Yes, I will see you
Through the smoke and flames
On the frontlines of war
We have to find a better way
And I will stand my ground until the end
'Til we conquer them all
We have to find a better way
'Til we conquer them all

Yes, I will lead you
Through the smoke and flames
On the frontlines of war
And I will stand my ground until the end
'Til we conquer them all

We will conquer them all
We will conquer them all
We will conquer them all

This war is ours!
Yeah!
This war is ours!
Yes, I will see you
Through the smoke and flames
On the frontlines of war
And I will stand my ground until the end
'Til we conquer them all (Go)

So I will fight my battle 'til I fall
And I conquer them all
'Til we conquer them all
(War! War! War!)
(War! War! War!)
(War!)

Go, yeah
This is war
War! War! War!
War! War! War!
War!
