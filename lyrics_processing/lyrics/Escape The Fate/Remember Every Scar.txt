Oh-uh-oh-uh-ho-oh
Oh-uh-oh-uh-ho-oh

Clickin' her heels
Says there's no place like hell
When you wake up
And you find yourself drinking from the bottom shelf

Life can turn you upside down
Chew you up and spit you out
Tear you up it never ends
It goes on and on and on and on and
(On and on and on and on)

Hold on to that heartbreak
Hold on to that hell you have to pay
Sometimes it's the only thing that gets you by
(The only thing that gets you by)
Hold on to that heartbreak
Hold on to that hell you have to pay
All the tragedies make you who you are
Remember every scar
You might also like
Here you are again
Feeling like hell
When you wake up on the bathroom floor
And you've got no story to tell

Life can turn you upside down
Chew you up and spit you out
Tear you up it never ends
It goes on and on and on and on and
(On and on and on and on)

Hold on to that heartbreak
Hold on to that hell you have to pay
Sometimes it's the only thing that gets you by
(The only thing that gets you by)
Hold on to that heartbreak
Hold on to that hell you have to pay
All the tragedies make you who you are
Remember every scar
Woah woah oh oh oh
Remember every scar
Woah woah oh oh oh
Push through
Despite all you've been through
You will carry on
We will carry on
(We will carry on)
Push through
Despite all you've been through
You will carry on
We will carry on
(We will carry on)

Hold on to that heartbreak
Hold on to that hell you have to pay
Sometimes it's the only thing that gets you by
(The only thing that gets you by)
Hold on to that heartbreak
Hold on to that hell you have to pay
Sometimes it's the only thing that gets you by
(The only thing that gets you by)
Hold on to that heartbreak
Hold on to that hell you have to pay
All the tragedies make you who you are
Remember every scar
Woah woah oh oh oh
Remember every scar
Woah woah oh oh oh
