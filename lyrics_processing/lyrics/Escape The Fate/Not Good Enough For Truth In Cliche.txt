Hurtful words from my enemies of the last five years
What's it like to die alone?
And how does it feel when tears freeze when you cry?
The blood in your veins is twenty below

Sitting in this room playing Russian roulette
Finger on the trigger to my dear Juliet
Out from the window, see her backdrop silhouette
This blood on my hands is something I cannot forget
Sitting in this room playing Russian roulette
Finger on the trigger to my dear Juliet
Out from the window, see her backdrop silhouette
This blood on my hands is something I cannot forget
Something I cannot forget

So for now, take this down a notch
Crash my car through your window
Make sure you're still alive
Just in time to kill you

Sitting in this room playing Russian roulette
Finger on the trigger to my dear Juliet
Out from the window, see her backdrop silhouette
This blood on my hands is something I cannot forget
Sitting in this room playing Russian roulette
Finger on the trigger to my dear Juliet
Out from the window, see her backdrop silhouette
This blood on my hands is something I cannot forget
Something I cannot forget

Crash my car through your window (window)
