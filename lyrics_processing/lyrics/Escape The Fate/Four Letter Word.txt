Love is a four letter word

Don't say it's over
Push me away then you pull me closer
Maybe we're just addicted to the pain 'cause
We've been here before
So why do we keep coming back for more?
Just tell me

Why you do the things you do?
Why you've gotta be so complicated?
Look at what you put me through
Maybe your heart was built for breaking
I need to walk away
It's more than I can take
The way you say it just makes me hurt
Love is a four letter word
Love is a four letter word

I was just fine
Before you robbed my heart like a gold mine
I know I need to find another way 'cause
We've been here before
I know I can't do this anymore
Just tell me

The way that you love me feels like hate
So I must be crazy if I stay

Why you do the things you do?
Why you've gotta be so complicated?
Look at what you put me through
Just tell me...
