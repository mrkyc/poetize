(Tables turning!)

Can I let my smile disarm you
Can I sing my words into your skin
I wanna watch so don't resist
How are you speaking cause you're so dishonest
You should be bleeding, there's a world around us
I must insist that I can't play this game
(So just hate me)

Hate me cause I live this way
Hate me for the things I say
Inside my rage is burning
I see the tables turning
Hate me cause I live this way
Hate me for the things I say
Inside my rage is burning
I see the tables turning

Do you see my conscience missing
When you hold the candle to my face
Your dirty hands, you can not fake
You say you know me, do you even know you
All of your comfort leaves you battered and bruised
I'll be the one, be the one to blame
(So just hate me)

Hate me cause I live this way
