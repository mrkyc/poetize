Don't let yourself go too far down the rabbit hole
You've been sinking like a stone, trying to find your way home
But the path is washed away
Don't beat yourself up, you're your own worst enemy
You've been counting all the days you've been in pain
And I know you're not okay

Walk on till you see the light of day
Walk on till the darkness goes away
Everybody feels alone sometimes
Walk on when you're going through hell, keep going
Walk on till your broken heart's unbroken
Everybody feels alone sometimes
Walk on, walk on
Keep going, keep going
Walk on, keep going, keep going
Everybody feels alone sometimes
Walk on, walk on

Cities and stages, these lines mean everything
I pour myself on every page, a glimpse into my pain
So disconnected from the world, from everything
I tell myself I'm not insane, I know I'm not okay
You might also like
Walk on till you see the light of day
Walk on till the darkness goes away
Everybody feels alone sometimes
Walk on when you're going through hell, keep going
Walk on till your broken heart's unbroken
Everybody feels alone sometimes
Walk on

I'm not giving up, I'm not afraid
Not giving up, won't turn away
Every step that I take brings me closer to the edge
I'm not giving up, I'm not afraid
Not giving up, won't turn away
Every step that I take brings me closer to the edge

Walk on till you see the light of day
Walk on till the darkness goes away
Everybody feels alone sometimes
Walk on when you're going through hell, keep going
Walk on till your broken heart's unbroken
Everybody feels alone sometimes
Walk on, walk on
Keep going, keep going
Walk on, keep going, keep going
Everybody feels alone sometimes
