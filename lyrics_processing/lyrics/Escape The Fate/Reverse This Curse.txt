A withered past and a blurry future
My hearts on an auction, it goes out to the highest bid
I live too fast, and I know I will lose her
But there is an option: to die is to live in her head

So I'll hang on, never let go
I dug this pain into my chest. It's dead

One last chance to reverse this curse
You stole my heart but I had it first
And now I see you've got something to prove
And nothing to lose, so let me tell you the truth

A deadly wish but it should've come sooner
A corpse in a funeral that I would never attend
There is a light on in the back of this house
But you're not around, to die is to live in her head

So I'll hang on, never let go
I dug this pain into my chest. It's dead
You might also like
One last chance to reverse this curse
You stole my heart but I had it first
And now I see you've got something to prove
And nothing to lose so let me tell you the truth

So, this goes
Out to the ones that fall in love
And to the girl
That filled my dark

Last night, I had the weirdest dream
That you and I drove up the darkest street
(Always felt it, never had it. Always felt it, never had it)
Passing through these city lights
(Always felt it, never had it. Always felt it, never had it)
Closure for the kids that died

One last chance to reverse this curse
You stole my heart but I had it first
And now I see you've got something to prove
And nothing to lose so let me tell you the truth
One last chance to reverse this curse
You stole my heart but I had it first
And now I see you've got something to prove
And nothing to lose so let me tell you the truth
So, this goes
Out to the ones that fall in love
And to the girl
