I refuse to give you more attention
I've already learned my lesson, you take everything
You abuse whatever that you're given
Know I have to keep my distance and stay far away

You keep bringing your shit to me
Handing me all your insanity
Why would I help you with anything?
The begging isn't working, baby

It's really not my problem
If you got issues, you can solve 'em
It's really not my problem
Won't let you drag me back to the bottom with you
It's really not my problem, problem
It's really not my problem, problem

I'm not here to tell you how to fix things
I'm not interested in saving the day, not again
Save your tears
I won't let it affect me
Negativity is deadly, I can't take the chance
You might also like
You keep bringing your shit to me
Handing me all your insanity
Why would I help you with anything?
The begging isn't working, baby

It's really not my problem
If you got issues, you can solve 'em
It's really not my problem
Won't let you drag me back to the bottom with you
It's really not my problem, problem

Gave you an inch, you took a mile
The more you bitch, the less I smile
Gave you an inch, you took a mile
The more you bitch, the less I smile
Gave you an inch, you took a mile
The more you bitch, the less I smile
Gave you an inch, you took a mile
The more you bitch, the less I smile

Don't come calling me the next time you need help
Think it's time you learn to take care of yourself
I don't know what makes you think I'll take your pain
It's not up to me to wash it all away
It's really not my problem
If you got issues, you can solve 'em
It's really not my problem
Won't let you drag me back to the bottom with you
It's really not my problem, problem

Don't call me the next time you need help
Think it's time you learn to take care of yourself
I don't know what makes you think I'll take your pain
