In the corners of your mind
And traces of discouragement
And peace you can not find
Reflections of the old past
They seem to face you every day
There's one thing I know for sure
That Jesus is the way

Jesus is the answer for the world today
Above Him there's no other, Jesus is the way
Jesus is the answer for the world today
Above Him there's no other, Jesus is the way
