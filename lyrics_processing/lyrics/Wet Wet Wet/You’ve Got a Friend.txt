And you know wherever I am
And I'll come running, oh yes I will
When you're down and troubled
And you need a helping hand
And nothing, nothing is going right, yeah
Just close your eyes and think of me
And soon I will be there
To brighten up and even your darkest night
You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running, oh yes I will, to see you again, yeah, oh Lord
Winter, spring, summer or fall
And all you gotta do is call
And I'll be there, oh Lord, oh Lord
Yeah
Listen, If the sky above you
Should turn dark and full of clouds
And that old north wind should begin to blow, no oh who
Listen you've gotta keep you head together
And baby call my name out loud
Because soon I will be knocking upon your door
You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running, oh yes I will, to see you again, oh Lord
Winter, spring, summer or fall
And all you gotta do is call
And I'll be there, oh Lord
Now ain't it good to know that you've got a friend
Cos people can be so cold
And they'll hurt you, and desert you
Well they'll take your soul if you let them
But no don't you let them
You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
And I'll come running to see you again, yeah, oh Lord
Winter, spring, summer or fall
And all you gotta do is call
And I'll be there, oh Lord
Yes I will be there, oh Lord
Yes I will be there, oh Lord
Cos You've got a friend
Cos You've got a friend
Cos You've got a friend
