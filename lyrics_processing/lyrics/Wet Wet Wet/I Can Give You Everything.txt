I said hurry won't you hurry
Hurry won't you hurry
Light my eyes with your smile
Cross my palm with your thought
For the hand that meets the eye
Brings you closer to my mind
'Cos in one crowded hour
You plan to make all the moments (plan to make the moments)
All the moments
All the moments
Last a lifetime
I can give you everything, that I want
Oh I can give you everything, that I want
Yes I can, yes I can, yes I wanna
I'm gonna give my love for you
All alone the heat of the night
Say come on let's be strong
Kindle my soul
For you are my p-p-pride and joy
For it is precious
For it is precious
Sing rejoice, sing rejoice
For it brings us good tidings
