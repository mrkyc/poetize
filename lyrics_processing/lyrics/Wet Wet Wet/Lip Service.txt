Ain't got enough, so I go out and get some more
It got so bad it nearly left me lying on the floor
I start to thinking that it's wearing on my soul
But I got to get it fitting tonight

You know
Raindrops keep fallin' on my window pane
They make my company
Now, I can hear them knocking on my door
Now, should I let them in?

When I look at the faces, baby
You see how the other half dies, huh!
And when I look at the faces, baby
I've got to - got to - got to
Let them come on in

Your lip service getting right out of order
Better keep looking or she'll blow my cover
She'll get caught by big sister midnight
I will only tell you stories
You will only tell me - lies

I get the picture cause you never got it sold
I get it, hand it back, it turns into a tray of gold
I'm just a victim of the promises you told
And I count the cost of living tonight

You've got ta...
Bottle the past and number the label
Got ta..
Drink to the future, feeling ready and able
Get a grip with a new fixation
And take them all and let them all in

When I look at their faces, baby
You see how the other half dies
And when I look at their faces, baby
I got to - got to - got to
Let them come on in

Your lip service getting right out of order
Better keep looking or she'll blow my cover
She'll get caught by big sister midnight
I will only tell you stories
You will only tell me - lies


Should I let them all
Let them all come i-in
Should I let them all come in?
Heh-hey
Should I let them all
Let them all come i-in
Should I let them all come in?
(Should I let them all come in?)
Your lip service getting right out of order
Better keep looking or she'll blow my cover
She'll get caught by big sister midnight
I will only tell you stories
You will only tell me - lies
Your lip service getting right out of order
Better keep looking or she'll blow my cover
She'll get caught by big sister midnight
I will only tell you stories
