And you, you were my last
And I was coming on strong, coming on strong
Coming on strong
I can feel love, I can feel love, I can feel love
Coming through your heart
What can you do with those attitude blues?
They'll make you feel alright
Yeah, they'll make you feel alright, yeah
You, you, you were my first love
You, you, were my last
And was I coming on strong, coming on strong
Coming on strong
I can feel love, I can feel love, I can feel love
Through your heart
What can you do with those attitude blues?
They'll make you feel alright
'Cos they'll make you, they'll break you
They'll put you back together
Again and again and again and again
I don't believe, I don't believe, that the price isn't high enough
I don't believe, I don't believe
