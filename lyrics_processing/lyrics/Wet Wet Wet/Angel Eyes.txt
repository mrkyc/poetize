Sick of leaving in the morning
With the night you gave away
So now I'm gonna take that all that I can get
With those angel eyes
You make saints do sins all the time
Say I'm gonna stay, home and away, well well
When I said I'd catch you when you're falling
I'd have my heart open wide
And you who's not naive I thought
Say I thought I'd mend my heart
People say I'm so automatic
People say I'm not so systematic
When I'm down I'm in manual, lord
And time on time again I walk on by
With the look of love
And with those angel eyes, woh woh
You set me on fire baby
And with those angel eyes, woh woh
C'mon now baby
The saddest thing I've ever seen on my tv screen
Was a dying man who died for his dream
Toughest thing I've ever heard
Was that new-born scream in this naked world
