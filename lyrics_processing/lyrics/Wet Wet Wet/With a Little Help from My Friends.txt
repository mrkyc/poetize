How does it feel by the end of the day
Are you sad because you're on your own

Could it be anybody? I need somebody to love (to love to love)
Would you believe in it's love at first sight
Yes I'm certain that it happens all the time
What do you see when you turn out the lights
I can't tell you but I know that it's mine
