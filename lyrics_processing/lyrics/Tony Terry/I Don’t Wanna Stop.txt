Had me trippin like some ecstacy
But how was I to know
I would lose control
Of my money, my mind, and my soul
My addictive personality really gets the best of me
When it comes to loving you
Any fool can see what you do to me
And I. . 
I don't wanna stop loving you baby
I don't think I'll ever stop fiening for you
I know I gotta stop cuz you're no good for me
But I don't wanna stop loving you baby
Well I know that you know you are wrong for me
So I have it and I gots to have it so very badly
But I know I got to find a way to shake you
It's gonna be hard to do, I gotta make it through, I gotta get over you
I don't wanna stop loving you baby
I don't think I'll ever stop fiening for you
I know I gotta stop cuz you're no good for me lady
But I don't wanna stop loving you baby
I know you love me in your own special way
But what can I say baby?
Cuz I lost myself in you
And I can't go on this way
I gotta find a way to get away from you
You might also likeI don't wanna stop loving you baby
I don't think I'll ever stop fiening for you
I know I gotta stop cuz you're no good for me
But I don't wanna stop loving you baby
