It?s been a long day
I?m gonna take it kind of easy and relax awhile
I wanna hear some mellow music nice and slow
You fill me up with love, you make me overflow
When I was down you would always lift me up
Thank God that you were there
I know that miracles and dreams come true
My every wish came true when I found you and your
Everlasting love
(Everlasting)
(The kind that won?t ever die, no, no, no, no, no, never)
Everlasting love
(Never, everlasting love)
Love
(Yeah hey, hey)
Temporary love don?t mean a thing, no, no
(?Cause if it?s temporary)
It can?t be real, no
(And all the things you?ve done for me)
Will never fade away
They last forever
You bring me joy
(You bring me joy)
