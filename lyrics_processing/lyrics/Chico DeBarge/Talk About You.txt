That's okay, that's okay
It's when they stop talkin' about you
Is when you worry, is when you worry
Envy is the number one cause
To make your friends talk behind closed door
You'll never know makes what them do, makes what them do
You're more important to them, than they are to you
So remember
As long as people talk about you
That's okay, that's okay
It's when they stop talkin' about you
Is when you worry, is when you worry
Listen up, yeah
See all of the rumors and lies that they spread
They'll only say something good about me when I am dead
There never were right and wrongs they done to you
And nobody knows when you loose
You should let them go
They mean you no good, as you know
The heart full of hate and they never will change
Till their dying day, they're always gonna be the same way
So let them walk on, talk on
