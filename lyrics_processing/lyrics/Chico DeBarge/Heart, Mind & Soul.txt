Oh, I couldn't need you more and more each day
I've learned I need to just let you lead the way
I'm into you with all my faith
That's why I'm giving you

My heart, my mind, my soul
Oh, Lord
My heart, my mind, my soul
Oh, Lord

You gave it all up for love
When everybody else was holding back

But most of all, you gave me joy
Even when I stood on shakey ground
Fulfilling every need
You never let me down
No greater love
Have I found
I trust you from the bottom of
You might also like
My heart, my mind, my soul
Oh, oh, Lord
My heart, my mind, my soul (ooh)
Oh, Lord

Oh, I was lost and lonely
As I struggled through darkness
Searchin' for the light
You loved me
Like your one and only
Oh, lover... oh, love
I'm giving it to you

Even though my friends turned their back on me
You were there
And you took me in your arms
And you showed me that you care
You gave me hope for tomorrow
You took away all of my sorrow
And I love you from the bottom of

My heart, my mind, my soul (yeah-heah)
My heart, my mind, my soul (yeah-heah-heah)
Oh, Lord (oh, Lord)
How can I show you how I feel?
Oooh, hooo

I want to be your servant
Give you all my love
Show me what to do everyday
I live my life before you
Show me how to live
Show me how to love
Teach me how to deal with all of

My heart, my mind, my soul (mm)
Oh, lord
My heart, my mind, my soul
Ohhh, lover, lover, lover
I'm talking love

I'm a different man (yeah, baby)
And I know I can
I'm a changed man
Make you happy, baby, baby
You mean the world to me (oh, yeah)
Ohh
Take the blood off my hand
Baby, baby, baby, purify
Oh, love (I'm a changed man)
Baby, baby
Take the blood off my hand
Take the stress off my mind
No more crying
Sleepless, lonely nights alone
No more pain
Cause I'm coming home
I will take you through tomorrow

100% man, baby
Lover, lover
Love, love, lover
I'm a changed man
Don't worry 'bout what other people say
Take the blood off my hand
Let 'em talk on
