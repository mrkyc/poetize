Baby, baby
Baby, baby, let's take our time
'Cause if we gonna do it, might as well do it right
Lock the doors, turn off the phone
Shut the windows 'cause, girl, it's on
All alone but just me and you
Four walls and a empty room
Squeeze you tight and hold you close
Kiss you where you know you need it most
I'm a really give you what you want
We can do whatever turns you on
I'm a make your fantasies
Become reality for sure
I'm a really give you what you want
Show you how I flip it back to front
Tell me what you need from me
And I will guarantee for sure
All we need is a place and time
Set the pace and free our minds
Let it go and let's explore
Every single thing that you wish for
You might also likeI only need a chance to make you feel
The closeness that we share is very real
I'm a layback, let you choose
'Cause what I'm giving you is just for you
I'm a really give you what you want
We can do whatever turns you on
I'm a make your fantasies
Become reality for sure
I'm a really give you what you want
Show you how I flip it back to front
Tell me what you need from me
And I will guarantee for sure
You feel my way, the seasons change
The fire and the flames
And my chance will come, you feel my rush
Of love, so come with me, yeah
I guess, I'm meant to prove
So let me do my thing
I will take my time, baby, for sure
Cut to the chase, hit you up with the place
What you down with the blaze?
Go to extremes, let it all be free
Where you at, baby?
Travel miles, drive you out of town
So can't be found
Take things down, baby, if you allow
Gonna get it, get it, get it, get it
Cut to the chase, hit you up with the place
What you down with the blaze?
Go to extremes, let it all be free
Where you at, baby?
Travel miles, drive out of town
So can't be found
Take things down, baby, if you allow
Gonna get it, get it, get it, get it
I'm a really give you what you want
We can do whatever turns you on
I'm a make your fantasies
Become reality for sure
I'm a really give you what you want
Show you how I flip it back to front
Tell me what you need from me
And I will guarantee for sure
I'm a really give you what you want
We can do whatever turns you on
I'm a make your fantasies
Become reality for sure
I'm a really give you what you want
Show you how I flip it back to front
Tell me what you need from me
And I will guarantee for sure
For sure, baby, baby
Gonna get it, get it, get it
Get it, get it, babe
