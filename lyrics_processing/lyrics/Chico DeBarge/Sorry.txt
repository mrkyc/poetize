I never met her yeah
Woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah
Ah, yes, ah
I know what you're going through
I never meant to hurt you, I'm sorry, so sorry
I know what you're going through
I never meant to hurt you, I'm sorry, so sorry
Our reality should have been you and I
I don't know why I was blind to have another on the side
Every move that she make I called out your name
Knowin' the truth number one in my life, I know
I know what you're going through
I never meant to hurt you, I'm sorry, so sorry
I know what you're going through
I never meant to hurt you, I'm sorry, so sorry
Now I know there are times when a man must cry
To get down low, feelings locked inside
And baby come back home, 'cause I don't wanna be alone
It hurts me to want you so bad and I know

I never meant to hurt you, I'm sorry, so sorry
I know what you're going through
I never meant to hurt you, I'm sorry, so sorry
Yes I've been around the world and I, I, I
Can't seem to find the kind of love that I can call all mine
We have to turn it up
Reverse and make the changes of our sex 
Bye-de-bye-bye, so as I creep all night and daylight
Tony Box and The Woff know how many ways
It's time to get large
I give 'em up to Chigo De Barge
I know what you're going through
I never meant to hurt you, I'm sorry, so sorry
