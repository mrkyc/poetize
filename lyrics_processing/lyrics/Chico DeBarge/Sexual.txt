Do it, do it

Do it, do it (doh, doh)
Let's ride
Let's ride
One time

I don't mean to make you sound cheap
By asking you to be my freak
But I wanna see what you start, babe
Up and down with mine, babe
Here's my beeper number
Give me a call
Tell your man that you're gone to the mall
So we can be alone
And he don't have to know
I keep his coffee warm

We can get sexual (get sexual)
No one has to know (aaah)
But you and me (and me, oh, oh, ohhh)
He won't know, she won't know about us

Just give me a call (get sexual)
And it will be on (alright)
On the down low, baby

I can't believe you're serious
Cause what if somebody sees us
And goes back and tells somebody else
That I've been diggin' you out?
You know I really wanna do you, girl
I wanna play on top of your world
So, if we do this, baby
We gotta drive our way outta town
So we can't be found

We can get sexual (we can get sexual)
Noone has to know (oh, oh, ohhh)

He won't know
She won't know
About us
We can get sexual (we can get sexual)

On the down low, baby (on the down low)

Everything he won't do
I'mma do it twice
Kiss you on your lips, girl
The ones between your thighs
I'mma get you hot when I go low
Just let me get it, ahh
Just let me get it, get it
We can do a lot
In a little bit of time
More than just a something
We're doin' on the side
We can both know that it's too strong (strong, yeah)
We can get sexual
Oh, baby, love
And me
Oh, oh, oh, ohhh, oh
