Ooh, ooh, baby, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Listen, baby

Have to write you this letter
To get something off my chest
Never had the chance to tell you
How I really felt
When you up and disappeared
Out of the blue
You just left
Guess you lied when you said
"The only thing that could separate us was death"
Cause you spread your wings
Like a bird in the sky
Kept pushing on
Never slowing down or looking behind
I had to find
That you moved on
Through the grapevine
Cause you never say goodbye (ye-ye-ye)
You might also like
First, you told Tanika
Tanika told Rashonda
And Joy
Then Joy told Vanessa
Vanessa told LaTina
That you were gone
You were gone
Everybody knew that you moved on
Without me
Without me
Everybody knew that you moved on
But me

So much time has then since passed us by
Since I last held you
In these arms and called you mine, baby
I still remember
After the movies, we rode through the park, babe
And we'd be sexin'
Late in the booth after dark (ah)
We'd take a shower
Gently bathing one another (lover)
Exploring each other's bodies
Like the first time
Sided lovers
And, oh, how it felt (uhn)
When we engaged in the act
Do I ever cross your mind like that?
Oh, oh, ohhh, baby

First you told Tanika
Tanika told Rashonda
And Joy
Then Joy told Vanessa
Vanessa told LaTina
That you were gone
You were gone
Everybody knew that you moved on
Without me
Without me
Everybody knew that you moved on
But me
First you told Tanika
Tanika told Rashonda
And Joy
Then Joy told Vanessa
Vanessa told LaTina
That you were gone
You were gone
Everybody knew that you moved on
Without me
Without me
Everybody knew that you moved on

Uh, eh
Oh, uh
Oh, uh
Oh, uh
Oh, uh
Oh, uh
Oh, uh
Oh
Baby, baby, babe
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Baby
Ah, ah
Oh, babe
Alright
Oh
Oh
Ohh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ohhh, babe

First you told Tanika
Tanika told Rashonda
And Joy
Then Joy told Vanessa
Vanessa told LaTina
That you were gone
You were gone
Everybody knew that you moved on
Without me
Without me
Everybody knew that you moved on

You left me standing alone in the cold
I'm a man
And a man ain't supposed to cry
About losing a woman
