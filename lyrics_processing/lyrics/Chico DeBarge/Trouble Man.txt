Oh-ooh, I come up hard, baby
I had to fight
Took care of my business, yeah
With all my might
I came up hard, babe, I had to win
Start all over and win again

I know some places and I've seen some faces
I've got good connections, you'll dig my directions
What people say, that's okay
'Cause they don't bother me

I'm a trouble man, babe
And that's okay
Trouble man, babe
Don't get in my way
Trouble man, baby
I'm still cool
Trouble man, baby
Makin' all my rules

I came up hard, baby, but now I'm cool
I didn't make it, sugar, playin' by the rules
I come up hard, baby, but now I'm fine
I'm checkin' trouble, sugar, movin' down the line
