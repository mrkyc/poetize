But you're in good hands, baby, check it, baby
Just for the taste of it, I'd give my whole life, shortie
Just for the smell of it, I smelled it, it was right, baby
Just for the touch of it, I'd make you my wife, shortie
Just for the love of it, I'd love it all night
'Cause baby, you're a virgin
Sweeter than candy from the candy store
And I don't want you hurtin'
'Cause you ain't never been with a man before
Oh, got my eyes on you and you will see why soon
I'm 'bout to make my move, so what you gonna do
And baby when we're done, you gonna be my boo
Before the night is through, I'll get your number too
Just for the taste of it, I'd give my whole life, shortie
Just for the smell of it, I smelled it, it was right, baby
Just for the touch of it, I'd make you my wife, shortie
Just for the love of it, I'd love it all night
Baby, you're so delicate like threads in a garment
More intricate than a rose in a garden
You're too young to be alone, baby
Too fine to be fine, shortie, but you're mine, shortie
You might also likeAnd if your friends don't like me
Well, then they don't gotta like me, yeah
And if your father really hates me
Wait till you're carrying my baby
Just for the taste of it, I'd give my whole life, shortie
Just for the smell of it, I smelled it, it was right, baby
Just for the touch of it, I'd make you my wife, shortie
Just for the love of it, I'd do it all night
Before the night is done, I'm givin' you a son
Our bodies will be one as passion wildly run
My tongue between your lips, can you get with this?
We cuddle when I kiss and you will be my miss
Word is bond
Word is bond baby
Put me on, put me on, babe
Put me on, oh babe
Just for the taste of it, I'd give my whole life, shortie
Just for the smell of it, I smelled it, you was right, baby
Just for the touch of it, I'd make you my wife, shortie, my wife
Just for the love of it, I'd love it all night
Now turn on, baby, put me on, babe
Word is bond
Turn on, baby, turn on, baby
You're the Miss for me, shortie
You're just my type and lovin', baby
Just how you like, baby
Everything and every dream, baby, baby, ohh, baby, oh, baby
A whole life, baby
Just for the smell of it, I smelled it, you was right, baby
Just for the touch of it, I'd make you my wife, baby
