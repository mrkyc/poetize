Cruel
How could you be so cruel, cruel, cruel, cruel?
You know I wouldn't do it to you, uh
You treat me like a fool, fool, fool, oh

Gave the world, but you passed it by
I was in love, I would jump in
You didn't have to say how high, baby

See, it's iggin' me, baby (It's iggin' me, baby)
I know you got a man
Someone to kiss your lips, someone to hold your hand
And I don't understand, uh
It's iggin' me, baby (It's iggin' me, baby)
That you could be so cruel (Cruel, cruel)
I thought that it was cool (Thought that it was cool)
Actin' like a fool (Actin' like a fool)

Blind
How could you be so blind, blind, blind?
You treat me so unkind, kind
You gonna reap what you're sowin'
Way that this is flowin'
I gave you the best things in life
In return, you just told me lies, uh
I told you the secrets of love, now I find myself asking why

Baby, baby
Does he make you scream in the night, babe?
In the day, babe?
