"Ok... uh... we are back again, and
Of course, you are listening to WBAI in New York, and this program is labrish
My name is 'Apre de Soulassion' and we are speaking with... Baba
Or maybe Ras Baba, uh-"

"Can I give a message?
Hello?"

"Go ahead, man."

"Yeah, I'd just like to say- uh
Let's have some music now, huh?"

"Ok. Ok. Thank you."
("Hah, you're right!")

Now lightning strikes in old New York
It may be dark but I wanna talk
It might rain, it might snow
There's too many things that I got to know
If this is spring then it's time to sing
Never mind the little birdie's wing
Look out, look out, old New York
New York's comin' and New York talks
You might also like
Hey! (Strike!) Not once!
(Strike!) But twice!

Get out your money peel a slab
Roll some notes and hail a cab
Drive-in church, drive-in bank
Drive down Tenth in a tank!
Take in the sights, feel the breeze
See New York's one and only tree
It can be found in Garbage Park
But don't inspect it after dark, no

(Strike!) New York! (Lightning!)
Not once but twice!
Accidental hike in the transit strike
Roller skate or ride a bike
Three to a car, Brooklyn Bridge
You won't get far with your privilege!
Graffiti Jack sprays in black
An Englishman, can he read it back?
Deli Joe, he ought to know
He runs the gang on Pastrami Row!
Strike! (Lightning!) Strike!

Because glass to glass, street to street
Buildings touch St. Peter's feet
From car to bar, from Prez to Shah
Everything is in the jar
The four winds blow 'cause the four winds know
Takes a special hustle to make a roll
Honey girl on her feet
I wish everything to make her sweet

Ow!
(Strike!) Strikes! (Ow!) Yes!
Lightning strikes, not once but twice!
But twice!
You all!
Serious!
You all!
From Harlem, strike once!
Lightning strikes!

Harlem slum to penthouse block
On every door I already knocked
There wasn't anybody that I didn't leave alone
Somebody lyin' under every stone
Everything that a man could need
Is in a bag down by my knee
That looks good, an' this ain't got seeds
Cheaper than booze down in the Bowery!
Go, lightning strikes! (Strike!)
Old New York, Everything's light!
What? Ow! Gotcha there!
Lightning strikes!

Hey, oh such a night!
I'll see you all when the lightning strikes
A Polaroid, caught in the act
You're married too, and that's a fact
But I won't peek, and I won't squeak
Down by the trucks on Christopher Street
It's Cuban Day, oy vey!
Chinese New Year let's call it a day!

Look out, lightning strikes!
Ey!
Tootsie!
Strikes, lightning!
Yeah!
Hey, Chi-man!

That melody is Puerto Rican
"Hey Chi-man" is what he's speaking
An' there's the road down into London Town
Where many cars get a-broken down
It's the Westway from Ladbroke Grove
Runs down to Old Hounslow
Look out, because you know 
Just thought I'd mention the new extension
That runs down the 59th Street intersection
Did you hear the news y'all?
London Town on the Broadway!
