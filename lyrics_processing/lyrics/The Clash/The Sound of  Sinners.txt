Wash away sin city
They say it was written
In the page of the Lord
But I was looking
For that great jazz note
Destroyed
The walls of Jericho
The winds of fear
Whip away the sickness
The message on the tablets
Was Valium
The planets form
That golden cross, Lord
I'll see You on
The holy crossroads
After all this time (Judgement day)
To believe in Jesus (Judgement day)
After all these drugs (Judgement day)
I thought I was him (Judgement day)
After all of my lying
And crying
And my suffering
I ain't good enough
I ain't clean enough
To be him (On judgement day)
No, no
