So many thoughts runnin' through my mind
My kids look hungry
I don't know if I'll make it time

When we're living in a world like this (When you're living)
When we're living in a world like this (In a world like this)
When we're living in a world like this (When you're living)
When we're living in a world like this (In a world like this)

Oaktown and your town are one and the same
The sight different but it's still the same pain
You hurt and I hurt, where can I find work?
Keepin' a brother down and his face in the dirty
My mind is tired and my kids are sick
I gottta make a move and I better do it quick
Thinking about the store, I might hit it tonight
And I pray to God that I don't take lives
No, I don't want to hurt anyone
But I'm loving my daughter and I love my son
The pain is deep and when they sleep
I cry because I know they need me
And I just might die
If I could, I'd switch today
Save my kids and take me away
I should have done better with my life
Not only do I suffer but my kids pay the price

I sweat and I hustle day after day
And Sunday in church, you know I kneel and pray
Lord, please forgive me for my sins but I'm trapped deep
It's the world I live in, I'm caught all up in it
An eye for an eye is what I heard
And in the neighborhood tonight
Somebody else is getting served (I got to serve them)
I know it's wrong and I know what's right though
But since I was eleven, I've been caught in the cycle (straight up hustler)
I borrowed from Peter to go pay Paul
To go see Larry about a hustle at the mall (it's a rock thang)
This ain't me but what can I do?
I've got my pride, don't want the government food (I don't want that)
Stamp or cheese or whatever they freeze
I gotta make it out, you know I've got to leave (I gotta go)
When will it stop? How does it end?
I don't really know but it's the world I live in (as the world turns)

When we're living in a world like this (When you're living)
When we're living in a world like this (In a world like this)
When we're living in a world like this (When you're living)
