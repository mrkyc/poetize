Just when I thought that I hit another soft slump
Up jumps the skippety with the pumps and a bump
All stiggity stiggity curves, getting on my good nerves
Looking like ice cream, ready to be served
Stretch, bend it, can I get in it
If you wanna kick it with a G, baby, splendid!
'Cause I come equipped, read my lips
Baby, you can slippity slip out your clothes and take a trip!

Pumps and a bump, now many say "a big rump"
But if you're hip, you know that it's a full trunk
It's making the brothers go crazy in the '93
Shaped like an hourglass; fine as wine, G
So when I see I gotta step (It's a pride thing)
Never been a coward ('Cause it's a eastside thing)
Just step right up to the girl with the big fat
Hell of a rump, yo, the pumps and a bump, uh!

All that we want
For the rest of our life
Is a girl thick and tight (Ladies!)
All that we want
Is man who is right
Who can hit it all night!
We gotta bump the pumps!

I don't like 'em figgity fat! (No!), I like 'em stiggity stacked (Yeah!)
You wiggity wiggity wack if you ain't got biggity back (Awwww!)
Now when you see the rump shakin' on the dance floor
You following with your eyes and get hypnotized
But a brother like me will dance with her, took 'em, charmin' and chillin'
I squeeze the Charmin and she won't find it alarmin'
I put my fingerprints all over that rump
I'm guilty as hell but I love the pumps and the bump! (Ow!)
