Oh, don't you know
Do you know about my city, the city of Oak
Oh, don't you know
Now lets take a little trip down memory lane, when brothers played nothing but, the dope game
East 14th and 73rd
That's where the slangers hung tough sellin' bird
And if you go to Sabreny Park don't get caught slippin' Cause they poppin' a caps in little marks after dark
And right across the way is a hood called Brookfield
And all over the bay they all know about the 69 ville
Ridin' down MacArthur don't get caught trick
Or you'll be sittin' on bricks My town is not big but you better believe that if you slip
You're bound to get jumped and smoked in a place called Oakland
Do you know about my city, the city of Oak
Oh, don't you know
Do you know about my city, the city of Oak
Oh, don't you know
The high street is the place where this brother spit it to me
On how to be a mac G, and not a wanna-be
It wasn't about the bodies ya stacked up
But the money ya racked up
And when it came to standin' on yo ground you never backed up
Another day, another episode when fools got bold
Another stompin' another story to be told to the young butts
The future hood who's coming up show them the ropes
These days they paid stompin' fools who runnin' up
Keepin' in mind whenever they go out to grind
Keep an eye on (Public Enemy NO.1) one time
Cause they'll be makin' you get yo bail on Instead of gettin' ya mail on so skip the cash flow
We gotta' dash so We can stay to profit another day
And ask the Lord to bless the homies
Who here and those who passed away
Cause there's really no win in this game
A hype beginning then 9 times out of 10 a sad ending
I lift my head to the sky
For all the homies who died
They'd rather be in their grave instead of poor or tired
So beware cause they really don't care
They'll kill you for breathing the wrong air
Take it from me cause I'm from there
Although I dance, make ends, parties
I like to start Look beyond that you'll find and Oakland fool to the heart
Who's tryin' to warn these wanna-be's no to clown
I'm an O.G. fool the 0 stands for Oaktown
