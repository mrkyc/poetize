One mo' time, hey, I gotta get mine, get mine
One mo' time, hey, I gotta get mine, get mine
One mo' time, hey, I gotta get mine, get mine
I'm goin for mine, one mo' time
I'm gettin my goals accomplished
While the others sit back and whine
And none of y'all can fade me so don't even try
Cause i'm the best at what I do and Ima tell you why
You see I'm too legit too ever quit
I started gaining momentum when they put me in the mix
You'll feel my power, the stage I'll burn it up
So put on the Hammer, people did pump it up
To the other rappers who tried to diss this is on yo face
I'll turn this mutha out leave you lookin disgraced
But you can't touch, and now you regret
That you called yourself a threat when you're something wet
Some brothers hang on, you sing the the same song
While people rollin' on, your crew is gone
You know I got it started with a kickin' gold rhyme
Suckas better pray cause it's Hammer time
One mo' time
You might also likeOne mo' time, hey, I gotta get mine, get mine

Check a baby peepin over there in the middle
Fellows give me ten minutes and i'll bet you I'll be in em
Cause growing on High Street taught me how to get em
And so my game is so tight i'm known to hit em and quit em
See I step to her, she's mine in a matter of minutes
It ain't how long you talk but what you put in
Spittin this game so cold and you tellin' me
That i'm not able to pick up this freak, well you fail to see
The heartbreaker's what they call me
And every year I'm at the player's ball, g
Whenever I'm in action you can prepare to see a show
And when it comes to breakin' em off
You know I'm letting the women know
That I'm the man in command, so i'm putting them in their place and if she's looking for handouts then get outta the Hammer's face
I'm not the type to wine and dine
But I'm a freak to blow your mind
So I guess i'm goin for mine
One mo' time
One mo' time, hey, I gotta get mine, get mine
One mo' time, hey, I gotta get mine, get mine
One mo' time, hey, I gotta get mine, get mine
One mo' time, hey, I gotta get mine, get mine
Hold now, Take me to the Bay
I'm gaining momentum from London to the Bay
And everywhere I went I made the people say heyyy
I'm making em' all amazed with every phase
Rap fools I'm gonna serve em
But this time the Hammer gotta hurt em
State to state, afterparty casinos
Running in Trinidad, lounging in Reno
I got it started in Bangkok and rocked Barbados
And watched Holyfield knock em out in Vegas
City after city I left the people in shock
You better believe, I left the whole place rock
And I love the way that the money just rolls out
Fifteen hundred cities every one of them sold out
Private jets, good times and bad times
Suckas be tryin' to diss so i'm coming with mad rhymes
All of these things often come to mind, but guess what y'all
Here comes the payback tour
I'm doin' it one mo' time
One mo' time, hey, I gotta get mine, get mine
One mo' time, hey, I gotta get mine, get mine
One mo' time, hey, I gotta get mine, get mine
One mo' time, hey, I gotta get mine, get mine

Yeah
You know I been checking out the rap scene while I was chilling
And I watched a whole lot of wannabe villains
Try to come up, and you know what?
The people need the real thing one more time
Yeah
So I got my new posse together
I went and got the Whole 9
The Hines Brothers, G-Bomb, Deuce Deuce, DRS
P.O.P., Ben Ross
You understand what I'm saying?
I got the new posse together
So we can give the people what they want
And do it for em, one mo' time
Hey, yeah, you know what I'm saying
One mo' time, hey, I gotta get mine, get mine
One mo' time, hey, I gotta get mine, get mine
One mo' time, hey, I gotta get mine, get mine
