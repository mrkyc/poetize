Operator : You have a VAC prepaid call from
"Bynoe" an inmate at Hudson a New York State Correctional Facility, if you wish to accept and pay for this call dial 3 now
Time and time again, destined to win
Suite up niggas

Ugh, fosho
Go in your pockets lint is all you dig out
Just as much as you put in is what you get out
I made it from the pen's to the penthouse
I'm just saying you must live under a rock


I'm back like I never left it
Flexing on these niggas bet they gone respect it (Me)
From the pen to the penthouse
What you put in life is what you get out (hello)
Then been the hell and back sleepless nights up in that trap
You know the gang riot we back (what up)
At the top it's just us niggas circle full of G's no fuck niggas
New bitches but my money old
Product of the hood that's why my heart is cold
Back against the wall you wasn't there for me
The devil want my soul say a prayer for me
I ain't got none left all my friends dead
Until my number called I'm a think bread
Riot gang till the sun burn
You only get one shot this your last turn
You might also like
Go in your pockets lint is all you dig out
Just as much as you put in is what you get out
I made it from them pen's to the penthouse
I'm just saying they must live under a rock
They must live under a rock (x3)
I'm just saying
They must live under a rock

They know me crossed the board you ain't gotta ask
Rather see me doing music then a gun and mask
The stick hold a hundred shots
Won't stop at one square I need a hundred blocks
Champagne dreams, vodka nightmares
Seen a lot of niggas go but I'm still here
Love is blind, hate got 20/20
Rather the respect you can keep the money
Get with it or get rolled on
Ice box where my heart was, man I'm so gone
Can't trust nobody keep your guards up
I just want you niggas to Squad Up!

Go in your pockets lint is all you dig out
Just as much as you put in is what you get out
I made it from them pen's to the penthouse
I'm just saying they must live under a rock
They must live under a rock (x3)
I'm just saying
They must live under a rock
