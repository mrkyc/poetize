On a run just to feed our sons and daughtaz
The rich get rich the po' get slaughta'd
Nobody cares it's the new world orda
It ain't fair look at all the return soldiaz
They all fucked up in the head when they soba
Rabblin to self thinkin the war is ova
Lets take it back to pulp fiction so you can
Paint a betta pikcha of this conversation
It all started back in 89
Chris Blackwell said come to my Island and sign
Headed to New York for tha progress
We said that the nigga that discovered Bob Marley
You know no woman no cry
But we was out there thinkin everythang gon be all right
I'm tired but I'm not tired of livin
Just tired of the bullshit this industry was givin
I'm not the first to complain
I'm just the first to say fuck yall in every which way
I love the music guess the music didn't love me
Oscilatin champs we been bangin since the 80's
If I should die tell the judge just to blame me
I stay a rida ain't nobody gonna save me
Starz peneltonz and bandanaz
Represent the gang bangaz cuss words and bad mannaz
I'm smashin 110 on the speed scanna
Fuck the fedz ATF and the chicken hammaz
