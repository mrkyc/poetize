In a Drop  64'
Lookin for them fools
Said I was no more
Daddy bout to Tweak
They told me sup OG
Tell them fools put em in a bucket
So were laughing all the way
So let me glide let me flow If I die just let me roll
Let me glide let me flow if I die just let me roll
Let me glide let me flow if I die just let me roll
Same bat channel Same bat run
Put  on the set let the lyrical rise
Got the heat on my side when its time to blow
They said I was no more so I could G some more
Is my 9 playing tricks on me or was ya takin' a ride straight out the shop let the Chevy start pimpin
To the west motha fucka with some gangsta funk
Lil somethin' for the club got somthin' from the trunk
BOOM BOOM is the 8
BOOM BOOM is the 0
BOOM BOOM is the 8
Let the one force one whoop
I drop that cavie overseas and I'm bullet proof so just
You might also like(Let me glide let me flow)
You gets clowned form the sound of the monster O
Murder one murder one let the brother come in
Check a fool to the grill of his chinny chin chin
And a weight kick drum with a bottle of rum
Watch em all come
To the base of the gun
Other side be creepin
Some rooftop with the gangsta lean runnin through yo city with the hood on my mind
Duck down fucker bow
Release the nine so just
Let me glide let me flow if I die just let me roll
Let me glide let me flow if I die just let me roll
Let me glide let me flow if I die just let me roll
Same bat channel same bat run 
Got the grave digga lookin where I buried my nine
Its the facts of the matter they don't know my name
R-I-Double-D-L-E-R little somethin for the club got somethin for the car 
BOOM BOOM is the 8
BOOM BOOM is the 0
BOOM BOOM is the 8
Let the one force whoop
I drop that cavie overseas and im bullet proof
And if it don't make dollas it don't make sense
Got fools in my back tryna climb my fence
Poppin that lip talkin' shit get flipped when they leave the west watch your back you might slip
Second stop sign be aware of the dip
It Just enough time to unload the clip so just
Let me glide let me flow if I die just let me roll
Let me glide let me flow if I die just let me roll
Let me glide let me flow if I die just let me roll
Let me glide let me flow if I die just let me roll
Hit and run we gotta gun on me
I got my murder one dome let me lay my poem
Grandma-ma here but I'm still not gone
To the otha side (whaa?) to the otha side (whaa?)
Bailin' in the cut with the gangsta strut
Fools wanna trip we can trip with the clique
Fools wanna ride we can ride the set trip
Click clique clack more shit in the back
Watch yo back is the name of the track
West to the east to the north to the south
When I hit ya up let me hear ya shout it out
Where y'all form (otha side)
Where y'all from (otha side)
Where ya say ya from (otha side)
Where yall form (otha side) so just
Let me glide let me flow if I die just let me roll
1995 murder one
Now my face feelin numb
I see my finger pullin on my gun
Fool what set you from (let me glide let me flow)
Another boulevard knight cruzes slow through our street
So I turns off my headlights and it was straight dark (If I die just let me roll)
All they saw comin from the tip of the AK (let me glide let me flow)
Flames spittin out sparks from the Chevrolet rollin slow (if I die just let me roll)
With the bullet holes on my passenger door
So let me glide let me flow if I die let the brother know
