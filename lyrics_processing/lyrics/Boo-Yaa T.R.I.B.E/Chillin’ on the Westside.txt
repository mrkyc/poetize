And the street light played our spotlight
And the hood was our stage and we do shit like this
Chillin' on the Westside (on the Westside, on the Westside)
Chillin' on the Westside (on the Westsiie, on the Westside)
It's a Westside stunt, I'm 'bouts to put some stump jump
So my creases on my pants sit straight when I roam on
To that other side to get my groove with
This tape that we had made for the home set
Gotta lot of love for my brothers all around me
Gotta lot of love for the hood it's like my family
And if it ain't Millers then it's on with E&J
And if you like it (sweet) it's on with Alize
And let me bust my tape, let it play until it pop
And just because we chillin', the killings don't stop
I'm lookin' at these freaks lookin' at me lookin' fly
And if they keep lookin' they get took and get in mine
Now we all, (together) who this right here?
(Together with yo' girl) And if you don't know, now you know
Cause I'm just
CHORUS:
Chillin' on the Westside (on the Westside, on the Westside)
Chillin' on the Westside (on the Westsiie, on the Westside)
(We count them years of love, c'mon) 5-10-15-20-25-30 years of love
(Chillin' with the homies on the Westside) Westside

Trippin' with yo' girl, said you make her cry, but I just say
(Step right up, hurry, hurry) And into my ride from the other side
(Crystal blue persuasion) As I persuade you to chills in the Westside
(Crystal blue persuasion) I'll let her know like the Sideshow check it in
(See the G, pullin' up in a hard top '63) Looks so bad (It look so bad, so bad, so bad)
I'm lookin' over my shoulder, I bee the OG crush he makin' a right from the corner
And he's bustin' out a cap made from Philly
Rollin' down the hood, bumpin' R. Kelly
(I don't bee nothing wrong) Ain't nothin' wrong y'all (chillin' on the Westside)
(I don't bee nothing wrong) Ain't nothin' wrong y'all (chillin' on the Westside)
Cause I'm just
