It was a cold night
All the homies was kickin it in the g-rides
K.O.D. would load in the M-1
O.M.B. had the bass turned up loud
E.K.A. had the Uzi
Roscoe was holdin the A.K
The phone rang
It was the Godfather
Givin us another issue
We got strapped, packed into the ride and ready to roll
(Roll) (roll) (roll)
And there they all go
I said ", go up to that third block and flip a u-turn
Lyric clips ready? (ready) (ready)"

Hit the gas, put on a ski mask, right when we pass...
(So what you think, Ridd?) smoke that ass
This ain't a game, straight up reality
Made by the streets, done by insanity
Drive-by, yes, it's the season
When the Ganxta kills for no reason
When an MC is slippin on the front porch
Stick em like a pitch fork, this is not New York
This is a concept comin from L.A
The West Coast comin with the war braids
So you know we're ready, Roscoe, is the hit squad ready?
Yes, they're ready
It's a clip to an Uzi that I insert
And at the show I unload at the concert
Yes, you just got tagged
Rolled to the bodybag is like rollin up a zig-zag
I can go on and on, tellin you war stories
About gangstas dyin for a territory
We claim the stage like the boulevard
It's only for those who are hard
Hardcore, we give you more
Cause the bass is bumpin from the third floor
So you look up and all you see is the T.R.I.B.E
You have a teardrop tacked to your eye
25 to life, so you better get with it
You ask who did it, the Ganxta Ridd did it
You might also like
Once upon a drive-by it was me and the Ganxta Ridd
MC's try to sweat the dawg, this is what he did
Time is tickin, the world's gone bad
You ain't with it, you better step back
Feel the wrath of the Ganxta Ridd
Damn, that's a hard-ass lyric!
Time is tickin, the world's gone bad
You ain't with it, you better step back
Feel the wrath of the Ganxta Ridd

That's how it is in the streets of L.A
People gettin killed today
You smile now and later you die
By a drive-by, you only have time to see the bullets fly
On the news it was televised
An Astrovan on Daytons strolled by
You think I lie? O.M.B. supplies the R.I.-
P. to the busters in front of me
Sweat that ass every time he sees me
Cause I hold the mic and stomp
Cuttin your head on a tree stump, watch the crowd I pump
When it's quiet on the set E.K.A. gets upset
Fuck that shit, Ganxta Ridd's up next
And this is a death threat
Time after time you forget
That this is a drive-by hit
Fuck a Dayton-stealer
Don-L the K.O.D. is the walk-by ladykiller
Then I turn to the R...
Rock, Roscoe, Rob and Rook
And the Ridd, yeah, he's the microphone crook
O is the left hook
Like when Brooklyn comes to L.A., you get took
So analyze the outlook
The old days a drive-by was heavy
Cause it was done by Machinegun Kelly
The new days this game is to live or die
In L.A. once upon a drive-by
Once upon a drive-by it was me and the Ganxta Ridd
MC's try to sweat the dawg, this is what he did
Time is tickin, the world's gone bad
You ain't with it, you better step back
Feel the wrath of the Ganxta Ridd
Damn, that's a hard-ass lyric!
Time is tickin, the world's gone bad
You ain't with it, you better step back
Feel the wrath of the Ganxta Ridd


It can't be stopped, and it's comin like a blindside
Once upon a drive-by came from the westside
Yes, all you can do is wet your lips
Hopin you don't get hit by the next lyric clip
I turn down the bass so I can feel ya
Ganxta Ridd is the microphone killer
You just got smoked cause the gangsta in me is loc'ed
Stop jackin for spokes
Or else you get picked on O. Mobsta Bass bomb
Another gangsta from the funk farm
This one is created
By the R, muthafucka, who stated
That this jam is rated R
That was the last seminar
We witness a murder on the boulevard
Yes, we just been spotted, spotted on the radar
Soldiers sent from the ?????
Cause we're comin in too hard
