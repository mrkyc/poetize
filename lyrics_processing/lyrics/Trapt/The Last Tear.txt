No one to catch your insecurities
You cling to the sadness in your dreams
Being happy is something you don't need
You know how to play that game
Even though you're the only one who plays
So attached to the feelings that you fake
Your weakness is your only strength
You're so emotional
Yet I don't think you feel anything
So conversational
Every time you start to scream
Dark circles run around your eye
Your drama turns inside
You always swear this is the last tear
You'll ever cry
You traded honesty for lies
You faked it all your life
You always swear this is the last tear
You'll ever cry
Are you bored with the life you chose
You pushed them all away
You know you never allowed yourself to grow
Are you angry at me now that you are exposed?
