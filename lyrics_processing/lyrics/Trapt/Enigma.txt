Do we know how to get the message across
We turn the lights off to find our way out
No time to get through to grasp what was lost
Don't turn the lights off and leave me in the dark

Hey I'm pleading, my soul is bleeding
I don't wanna be left alone, not when I'm right next to you
What are you thinking? It's so misleading
Is it not for me to know?
I think its just hard for you to show

We never spoke in the words that we want
We turn the lights off to find our way out
We never chosen to keep what we've got
Don't turn the lights off and leave me in the dark

Hey I'm pleading, my soul is bleeding
I don't wanna be left alone, not when I'm right next to you
What are you thinking? It's so misleading
Is it not for me to know?
I think its just hard for you to show

Hard for you to show
It's so hard for you to show
Why is it hard for you to show?
Hard for you to show

I thought it would be nice to lie down and close my eyes
It never occurred to me that I am already asleep
Don't be the one to, don't be the one to let it show
Don't be the one to, don't be the one to be alone
Don't be the one to, don't be the one to let it show
Don't be the one to be alone, tonight

Hey I'm pleading, my soul is bleeding
I don't wanna be left alone, not when I'm right next to you
What are you thinking? It's so misleading
I don't wanna be left alone
I don't wanna be left alone
I don't wanna be left alone
No, I don't wanna be left alone
I don't wanna be left alone
