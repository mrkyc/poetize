I keep swinging with those moods
I keep crawling back to you
I know now that love is blind
Because you put that veil over my eyes
I'm addicted to your touch
You tear me down to build me up
I'm a sucker for this game
But it's all I want to play

A little piece of heaven raising hell
Sex is just a weapon that you use to possess
Keep me all to yourself

The more I feel the pleasure
The more I feel the pain
I'm in a love hate relationship too deep to escape
Everyday is a gamble
That's the risk that I take
In a love hate relationship and you are to blame

I keep taking this abuse
Oh am I being used
Thought you were the perfect drug
Well this time I think I took too much
You taste so bitter sweet
You mean so much to me
Be careful with a heart you take
Because it's a heart that you can break

A little piece of heaven raising hell
Sex is just a weapon that you use to possess
Keep me all to yourself

The more I feel the pleasure
The more I feel the pain
I'm in a love hate relationship too deep to escape
Everyday is a gamble
That's the risk that I take
In a love hate relationship and you are to blame

We pull it together
And tear it apart
We walk a thin line
It's just who we are

A little piece of heaven raising hell
Sex is just a weapon that I have to accept
You got me all to yourself

The more I feel the pleasure
The more I feel the pain
I'm in a love hate relationship too deep to escape
Everyday is a gamble
That's the risk that I take
In a love hate relationship and you are to blame
And the higher you take me
The farther I fall
In a love hate relationship and you I have lost
I have to forgive you
For all of your flaws
