Ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah

I don't know anything at all
And I'm somebody else
It could take years to find you
It could take years to find myself
And I don't need to hear your answer
I just need you to see
That I think it's time to break down
These walls that we throw up

Am I still breathing
Have I lost that feeling
Am I made of glass 'cause
You see right through me
I don't know who I am
And you're the only one who sees that
I can't ask these questions
That cannot be answered today

Ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah

And even if everything goes wrong
And we start to fall apart
I will understand where you are
I will understand this by myself
And I don't need to hear your answer
I just need you to feel
Like there are no boundaries at all

Am I still breathing
Have I lost that feeling
Am I made of glass 'cause
You see right through me
I don't know who I am
And you're the only one who sees that
I can't ask these questions
That cannot be answered today

I don't mind today
Whoa, today
I don't matter today, oh

And how far have we come
Too far to throw away the past
Will you be there waiting for me?
If I have to ask what we are
If I ask today it just won't last
So I'll be here waiting for you
Will we ever feel this good again? (Not today)
Will we ever feel this real again, again? (Not today)
Will you ever be mine again? (Not today)
Will we ever feel this real again?
Not today, today
I don't mind today
Whoa, today
