I was sick of restrictions, sick of the boundaries
About to close the door
Such a lack of conviction, no real connection
What should I settle for?
But you caught my attention, you built on the tension
And you left me wanting more
Now I don't know what to do with myself, do with myself
I don't want nobody else

I let you in, I let you in and you infected me
Can't get enough of you
Can't get enough of you
I breathed you in, I breathed you in and now I'm in too deep
Don't think I'm pulling through
Don't think I'm pulling through
Can't get enough of you (Can't get enough of you)

You're so contagious
Running through my veins
You're so contagious
Hanging onto every word
You're so contagious
And I can't get away
You're so contagious
And now I know for sure
There is no cure

I saw your intentions, I gave you permission
Go ahead and start the war
I was out of addictions by my own admission
Oh, I've been keeping score
But you made an exception, you taught me a lesson
Who cares where I've been before?
You would never leave me all by myself, all by myself
You don't want nobody else

I let you in, I let you in and you infected me
Can't get enough of you
Can't get enough of you
I breathed you in, I breathed you in and now I'm in too deep
Don't think I'm pulling through
Don't think I'm pulling through
Can't get enough of you (Can't get enough of you)

You're so contagious
Running through my veins
You're so contagious
Hanging onto every word
You're so contagious
And I can't get away
You're so contagious
And now I know for sure
There is no cure
(And I am burning in your fire)
There is no cure
(And I have only one desire)
There is no cure
Now I don't know what to do with myself, do with myself (I cannot deny her)
There is no cure
Now I don't know what to do with myself, do with myself
I don't want nobody else

I let you in, I let you in and you infected me
Can't get enough of you
Can't get enough of you
I breathed you in, I breathed you in and now I'm in too deep
Don't think I'm pulling through
Don't think I'm pulling through
Can't get enough of you (Can't get enough of you)
Can't get enough of you

You're so contagious
Running through my veins
You're so contagious
Hanging onto every word
You're so contagious
And I can't get away
You're so contagious
And now I know for sure
There is no cure
You keep running
You keep running
You keep running through my veins (You're so contagious)
You keep running
You keep running
You keep running through my veins (There is no cure)
You keep running
You keep running
You keep running through my veins (You're so contagious)
You keep running
You keep running
