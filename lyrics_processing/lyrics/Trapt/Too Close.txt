How long you been planning this
Is it something that I missed?
I would've thought that I was breaking through to you
Did you run out of room?
You said that you would take the risk
And now you can't handle it
You took what you can get and now you're through, I can tell
By the look on your face
That it's time for you
To make an escape
It's my mistake
It's my mistake, I never listen when you say
Don't never get too close, too close, too close to me
You want to get too close, too close, too close to me
Don't never get too close, too close, too close to me, I had to find out
Find out for myself
I always knew
I'd be the one to take the hit
But I guess I just can't resist
All the mysteries surrounding you, I'm so confused
There are just too many twists
I'll never get away from it
I should've known you were too good to be true, I can tell
By the look on your face
That it's time for you
To make an escape
It's my mistake
It's my mistake, I never listen when you say

Don't never get too close, too close, too close to me
You want to get too close, too close, too close to me
Don't never get too close, too close, too close to me, I had to find out
Find out for myself 
Why do you keep me at a distance?
Why are you always so resistant?
Don't want to wander any longer
Wondering when you'd say
Don't never get too close, too close, too close to me
You want to get too close, too close, too close to me
Don't never get too close, too close, too close to me, I had to find out
