I can't run, too dangerous to open the door
I can't hide, there's nowhere to go anymore
I've got nothing to hold on to
I can't break through, living in the eye of the storm
Living in the eye of the storm

I'm watching all of these dark clouds
I'm watching blue skies turn to gray
And the lightning has struck ground
And a million eyes start to rain
I'm watching everything go down
I'm watching everything wash away
The lonely streets don't talk now
Nobody hears what they got to say

I know I got to be strong
But it's hard to hold on and on and on and on and on

I can't run, too dangerous to open the door
I can't hide, there's nowhere to go anymore
I've got nothing to hold on to
I can't break through, living in the eye of the storm
So numb, surrounded by a violent force
Inside, fighting through a deepening war
I need something to hold on to
To get me through, living in the eye of the storm

I'm watching open hearts breaking
I'm watching lovers turn to enemies
All our memories fading
We forget the ones we really need
I'm watching evil men break dreams
I'm watching good intentions turn to greed
Never satisfied taking
All the power just couldn't feed

I know I got to be strong
But it's hard to hold on and on and on and on and on

I can't run, too dangerous to open the door
I can't hide, there's nowhere to go anymore
I've got nothing to hold on to
I can't break through, living in the eye of the storm
So numb, surrounded by a violent force
Inside, fighting through a deepening war
I need something to hold on to
To get me through, living in the eye of the storm
Living in the eye of the storm

Did you get everything you wanted?
Did you get everything you wanted?
Did you get everything you wanted?
Did you get everything?
I can't run, too dangerous to open the door
I can't hide, there's nowhere to go anymore
I've got nothing to hold on to
I can't break through, living in the eye of the storm
So numb, surrounded by a violent force
Inside, fighting through a deepening war
I need something to hold on to
To get me through, living in the eye of the storm
