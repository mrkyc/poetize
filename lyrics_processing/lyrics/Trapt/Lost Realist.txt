A doubtful voice divides my faith
My independence only hesitates
An unsure choice I can't embrace
You're gonna have to carve me
Carve me from stone
Right to the bone or
I'll end up alone
Playing the role
Of someone in control
Why do I rush to slow down
Why do I rush to slow down everything
Why do I rush to slow down
Why do I rush to slow down everything
Will the dice ever roll
When will I ever know
Will the plot ever twist
Or will I still resist
I've been playing the part of a lost realist
My independence is turning the page
Tomorrow comes we start to fade
My independence only complicates
It's not enough to meet half way
