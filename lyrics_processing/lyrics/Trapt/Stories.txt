I found a line and then it grew
I found myself still thinking of you
I felt so empty and now I'm fine
But still it's burning, when will you be mine?

Too much of the same stories in our lives
I think it's time for change, don't you?
Too much of the same stories in our lives
I think it's time for us to walk away from here

Stories in our lives, we keep them all inside
Stories in our lives, we keep them all inside

Look at me, still in your mind
Our memories, so intertwined
Well, you broke through, you found your way
And so did I, no need to stay
In the same old picture, tried and true
We've been through that, let's look for something new

Too much of the same stories in our lives
I think it's time for change, don't you?
Too much of the same stories in our lives
I think it's time for us to walk away from here

Do you remember lying on the beach so late at night?
Do you remember running through the sprinklers that night?
Do you remember all the songs that I have wrote for you?
All the songs that I have wrote for you, for you
I remember the way you made me feel when I was with you
I remember the smile that always brought me back to you
That look in your eyes
I never thought that this could be untrue
That look in your eyes
I never thought that this could be untrue
