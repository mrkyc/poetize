I saw you in the garden
I wanted you so much
I really thought that you were different, oh I
Couldn't get enough
I tried to save you from yourself
I felt every high and low
But the lows have drowned the highs away
Now there's no where else to go

Black rose your thorns are cutting into me
For the last time
Black rose I watched your petals wilt away
I couldn't bring you back to life

You were always where the sun could never go
I never wanted you to have to be alone
But I couldn't find a way to help you grow
Black rose

You never tell me how you feel
And your moods they always change
I really tried to make it real, but you
Never had the faith
I tried to give you something good
To take the pain away
I tried to make you understand
You don't have to be this way

Black rose your thorns are cutting into me
For the last time
Black rose I watched your petals wilt away
I couldn't bring you back to life

You were always where the sun could never go
I never wanted you to have to be alone
But I couldn't find a way to help you grow
Black rose

I'm not the one who hurt you (I couldn't save you)
So why are you so scared? (you are, who you are)
All that you've been put through (I couldn't break through)
Couldn't be repaired (we're too far apart)
I'm not the one who hurt you (I couldn't save you)
I'm the only one who cares (you are, who you are)
You'll need someone to turn to (I couldn't save you)
And I will not be there

Every time I held you
I knew that it would hurt
Only through the pain
I could find a way to learn
Black rose your thorns are cutting into me
For the last time
Black rose I watched your petals wilt away
Saw them wilt away
Couldn't bring you back to life


You were always where the sun could never go
