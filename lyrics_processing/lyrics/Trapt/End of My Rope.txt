Seems like I barely get by
The days are getting shorter, and shorter, and shorter
I just can't find enough time
It's all around me
Fear of failing
It's all around me
And I keep looking down at where
I know I could be
I don't want to hit the bottom
I'm at the end of my rope, my rope
Hanging from the last little bit of hope
Feeling like I'm bout to lose control
Maybe I should just let go
I'm at the end of my rope, my rope
Clinging to the only thing I know
As long as there's something left to hold
I won't let go
I can still remember, remember, remember
It was so easy to fly
I thought I'd live forever, forever, forever
Now I gotta fight to survive
It's all around me
Life's changing
It's all around me
But I just can't let it fall
Too far out of reach
I don't want to hit the bottom

Hanging from the last little bit of hope
Feeling like I'm bout to lose control
Maybe I should just let go
I'm at the end of my rope, my rope
Clinging to the only thing I know
As long as there's something left to hold
I won't let go
There's still some hope
At the end of my rope
At the end of my rope
Everyone of us has got a story to tell
Some are still lost, some have found themselves
Some are in denial with no soul to sell
And I am still here at the wishing well
I'll keep trying
I'll keep fighting
I'm at the end of my rope, my rope
Hanging from the last little bit of hope
Feeling like I'm bout to lose control
Maybe I should just let go
I'm at the end of my rope, my rope
Clinging to the only thing I know
As long as there's something left to hold
I won't let go
I won't let go (I'm at the end of my rope, my rope)
I won't let go (I'm at the end of my rope, my rope)
There's still some hope (I'm at the end of my rope, my rope)
At the end of my rope
