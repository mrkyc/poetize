You never listen to me
You cannot look me in the eyes
And I have struggled to see
Why it's so easy to push me aside?
I no longer believe
That you were ever at my side
How could you know what I need
When I am the last thing on your mind?

Too out of touch, out of touch to touch you
Too out of touch, out of touch to touch you
Too out of touch, out of touch to touch you
Too out of touch, out of touch to touch you

So disconnected
Going through the motions again
So disconnected
Everything goes over your head
So disconnected
You got me hanging by a thread
So disconnected
When will this cycle end?

You don't really know me
I don't think you've ever even tried
We're on the same routine
And still you never have the time
Who do you want me to be?
Do you want me in your life?
I feel so incomplete
You left me too far behind

Too out of touch, out of touch to touch you
Too out of touch, out of touch to touch you
Too out of touch, out of touch to touch you
Too out of touch, out of touch to touch you

So disconnected
Going through the motions again
So disconnected
Everything goes over your head
So disconnected
You got me hanging by a thread
So disconnected
When will this cycle end?
It's too hard to just move on
It's easier said than done
It's too hard to just move on
It's easier said than done
It's too hard to just move on
It's easier said than done

Too out of touch, out of touch to touch you
Too out of touch, out of touch to touch you
Too out of touch, out of touch to touch you
Too out of touch, out of touch to touch you

So disconnected
Going through the motions again
So disconnected
Everything goes over your head
So disconnected
You got me hanging by a thread
So disconnected
When will this cycle end?

So disconnected
Going through the motions again
So disconnected
When will this cycle end?
