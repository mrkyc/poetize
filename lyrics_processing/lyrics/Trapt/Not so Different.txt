We're not so different

There's a panic in the air
Leads you down a dark corner
Round a black color, beware
Why do you stare?
You've got a bad feeling
Heavy heart beating, so scared
What's really going on?
Behind the scenes, through the back streets
Down the alleyways that nobody sees

Through the heart of what divides
Whenever I look into your eyes
We don't need the space between
We're close enough to see
We're not so different now
We're not so different

We are almost there
And this is the beginning
As long as you're willing to dare
We've been everywhere
Looking for some meaning, looking for a reason to care
What's really going on?
Behind the scenes, through the back streets
Down the alleyways that nobody sees

Yeah, yeah, yawp (3x)
You can't sum me up
Look me up and down (Yeah, yeah, yawp)
Before I show you what I'm all about
Yeah, yeah, yawp (3x)
