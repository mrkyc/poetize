You don't ever ask me why
You don't read the signs
You give me way too many reasons
For me to wanna get high
Standing tall between my four walls
And I'm about to fall
So look into my eyes and I
Say it all

I am lost
I am lost, so crucify me on your cross
What's the cost
What's the cost
To erase what I've been taught

Get off my back
Don't attack
So what if I fell off the tracks
Your master plan
Don't understand
I'd rather live in my own wasteland
I'm already gone, I'm already gone
My own wasteland
I don't belong, I don't belong
My own wasteland

Scream at me until I shut down
Don't hear a sound
Can only take so many cheap shots
Down on the ground
I gotta go my own way this time
Leave you behind
Said it all but not enough for your
Simple mind

I am lost
I am lost, so crucify me on your cross
What's the cost
What's the cost
To erase what I've been taught

Get off my back
Don't attack
So what if I fell off the tracks
Your master plan
Don't understand
I'd rather live in my own wasteland
I'm already gone, I'm already gone
My own wasteland
I don't belong, I don't belong
My own wasteland
You tell me what you want from me
To never ask me what I need
Just let me go, just set me free
And turn these nightmares into dreams

I am lost
I am lost, so crucify me on your cross
What's the cost
What's the cost
To erase what I've been taught

Get off my back
And don't attack
So what if I fell off the tracks
Your master plan
Don't understand
I'd rather live in my own wasteland
And I won't waste another day
It doesn't matter what we say (my own wasteland)
Your memories age and with new age
I'd rather die in my own wasteland
I'm already gone, I'm already gone
My own wasteland
I don't belong, I don't belong
My own wasteland
I'm already gone, I'm already gone
My own wasteland
I don't belong, I don't belong
