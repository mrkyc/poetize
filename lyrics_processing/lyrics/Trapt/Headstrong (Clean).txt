Circling your
Circling your head
Contemplating everything you ever said
Now I see the truth, I got a doubt
A different motive in your eyes and now I'm out
See you later
I see your fantasy
You wanna make it a reality paved in gold
See inside, inside of our heads, yeah, well now that's over
I see your motives inside
Decisions to hide
Back off I'll take you on
Headstrong to take on anyone
I know that you are wrong
Headstrong, we're headstrong
Back off I'll take you on
Headstrong to take on anyone
I know that you are wrong
And this is not where you belong
I can't give everything away
I won't give everything away
