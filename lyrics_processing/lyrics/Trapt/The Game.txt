How have you been? Nice to see you again
How quickly these conversations
Seem to end
You meet a friend every now and then
How quickly these relations turn
Into trends

Put all your walls up
And open your windows
And close all your doors
You catch yourself standing
In front of the mirror
And now you need more

So what do you wish for
To catch you as you're falling?
So easy to ignore, but
Now you hear it calling again
I wouldn't wanna be you
(This lonely game that you play)
Between your walls you confuse
(Every heart that you break)
So afraid that you'll lose
(Always a void to replace)
I wouldn't wanna play you

You try and pretend, the truth is hard to bend
How easy these translations
Can be read
What if you were led to play a different game instead
How hard these frustrations are
They are to mend

Put all your walls up

So what do you wish for
To catch you as you're falling?

I wouldn't wanna be you

Does it matter to you?
Does it matter to you?
Does it matter to you?
Does it matter to you?
