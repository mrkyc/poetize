Close my eyes, let the whole thing pass me by
There is no time to waste asking why
I'll run away with you by my side
I'll run away with you by my side
(close my eyes, let the whole thing pass me by)
I need to let go, let go, let go, let go of this pride
(asking why)

I think about your face, and how I fall into your eyes
The outline that I trace, around the one that I call mine
A time that called for space, unclear where you drew the line
I don't need to solve this case, and I don't need to look behind

Close my eyes, let the whole thing pass me by
There is no time to waste asking why (asking why)
I'll run away with you by my side (by my side)
I'll run away with you by my side (I'll run away with you)
(close my eyes, let the whole thing pass me by)
I need to let go, let go, let go, let go of this pride
(asking why)

Do I expect to change the past I hold inside
With all the words I say repeating over in my mind
Some things you can't erase, no matter how hard you try
An exit to escape is all there is left to find

Close my eyes, let the whole thing pass me by
There is no time to waste asking why (asking why)
I'll run away with you by my side (by my side)
I'll run away with you by my side (I'll run away with you)
(close my eyes, let the whole thing pass me by)
I need to let go, let go, let go, let go of this pride
Until this echo, echo, echo, echo in my mind
Until this echo, echo, echo, echo can subside

So I
Close my eyes, let the whole thing pass me by
There is no time to waste asking why
I'll run away with you by my side
I'll run away with you by my side (I'll run away with you)
(close my eyes, let the whole thing pass me by)
I need to let go, let go, let go, let go of this pride
Until this echo, echo, echo, echo in my mind
