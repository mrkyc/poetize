Don't think we ever really got it right (Got it right)
Both you and I have always kept it bottled up inside
Can you show me what it feels like (Feels like)
To give yourself away?

(Why can't I hold on?)
There's no one around who picks me up when I'm down like you do
(Why can't I hold on?)
And when you can't hear a sound will the silence melt you too?

Who's going home with you tonight?
Was it real or am I part of your collection?
Have you crossed the line?
Who's going home with you tonight?
Oh, I feel that you're an open invitation
Is this how we say goodbye?

Keeping secrets somewhere down below (Down below)
I wish you had the heart to tell me that you sold your soul
So many things you couldn't let me know (Let me know)
You had to run away

Who's going home with you tonight? (Goodbye)
Who's going home with you tonight?
Can you tell me what is wrong and what is right?
Who's going home with you tonight?

Why can't I hold on to you?
Why can't I hold on to you?
Why can't I hold on to you?
It's getting harder to sit here alone
And I've been waiting, I've been waiting and you still ain't home
I have never ever felt so low
I've been thinking, I've been thinking, oh, where did you go?
Who's going home with you tonight?
Was it real or am I part of your collection?
Have you crossed the line?
Who's going home with you tonight?
Oh, I feel that you're an open invitation
Is this how we say goodbye?
