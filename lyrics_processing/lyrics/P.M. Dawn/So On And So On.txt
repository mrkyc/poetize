Hey you...
I remember you, I think I'm well acquainted with your kind
You like to make things turn around to so calm, or no calm...
No place inside my space so
I have a newborn diamond mind
I think I'm on to other worlds that I've drawn or you've drawn...
Why are you so complicating, I'm not on to you...
I know whatever severs my heart, I'll find that the blade belongs to you, or even you
If I find my resolutions, where else do I go...
(Oh) I'd like to see these answers, babe
I bet they go so on for so long
(Chorus)
So on and so on and so on and so on...
So on and so on and so on and so on...
So on and so on and so on and so on...
So on and so on and so on and so on...
I can see what bewilders me more...
Than the presence of a weak divine...
I'm contemplating my synopsis of you
I'm so on or so wrong...
Illustrate Prince Be well
He's some surrealistic mistletoe
But now Nocturnal interludes go
So on for so long...
Why are you so complicating
I'm not on to you...
("Everybody loves the sunshine!")
Well, I've heard that before, but does it apply to me or even you
If I find my resolutions where else do I go...
I guess I'll follow the shooting stars 'cause they go so on for so long...
You might also like(Chorus)
I bet you had trouble finding you
So whatever stimulates your mind
I can sing those thoughts you're thinking
Cuz my songs are your songs
(So what about Prince Be?)... well
(I think he is great)
But everything's being held together in my palms... your palms
Why are you so complicating?..
I'm not on to you...
Oh.. whatever you are in my eyes
I know it's so surprising to me... or even you
If I find my resolutions where else do I go...
