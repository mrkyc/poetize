Legs of a God, head of a man
Eyes on the camera, shaking everyone's hands
Vultures circle and smack their lips
The sky goes black as the lightening rips
The stars are new moon without pity
As waves of blood roll over the city
It's not a rehearsal or special effects
It's the end of a story, it's what happens next

If I say it's coming any second
If I say, and I say in the blink of an eye
And I say if I beg and I whimper
And I say it's okay if you never say goodbye

Son of a child, song of a beast
As it slouches and slithers, it's waiting for the feast
I dreamt a dream, but what can it mean?
Angels in love devoured the queen
All the people danced tore at their clothes
The sky was a fire and the oceans froze
It wasn't a fable, it wasn't a hoax
The seventeen devils speaking of jokes
You might also like
If I say it's coming any second
If I say, and I say in the blink of an eye
And I say if I beg and I whimper
And I say it's okay if you never say goodbye

I saw a chapel lain of God
The light was so blue and the air was so cold
Sounds of home on a microphone
As the last kept rhythm of chicken bone
People wept and swallowed their jewels
Enter like soldiers, departing as fools
It isn't incentive, it's not a reward
It's a black parachute with a noose for a cord

If I say it's coming any second
If I say, and I say in the blink of an eye
And I say if I beg and I whimper
And I say it's okay if you never say goodbye

And I say it's okay if you never say goodbye
And I say it's okay if you never say goodbye
And I say it's okay if you never say goodbye
And I say it's okay if you never say goodbye
