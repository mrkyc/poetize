Almost admittedly I do this unto you
As Columbus would sail across the end of the world
Almost admittedly I wish I were with you
And Columbus would sail across the ends of the world
Me, I just couldn't find my way home
And she'd say to me, baby
"I hate you so much, why can't you go away, baby?
I wish you were here."
I get to curse the world with your good advise
I shoulda stayed a victim and let it surround you babe
I never concentrated and that's all right
See, it's the interruptions that always define you babe
And I say
If Lovin' you is pleasing you
Nothing really matters
(Nothing really matters when you don't)
If lovin' you is pleasing you
Nothing really matters
(Nothing really matters when you don't)
You might also likeCommon law connects me to vice
I shoulda been a witness just to terrify you babe
I can't be myself and still be liked
But, I can have devotion and crucify you babe
So I say
If Lovin' you is pleasing you
Nothing really matters
(Nothing really matters when you don't)
If lovin' you is pleasing you
Nothing really matters
(Nothing really matters when you don't)
And she'd say to me, baby
"I hate you so much, why can't you go away, baby?
I wish you were here."
I don't have the patience to be understanding
I become engaged when she reminds me
She can never please me even when she pleases me
Can I really love her?
If she reminds me...of her
She reminds me...of her
She reminds me...of her
When she's condescending
With her double standards
In her apathy I think she...?
And she'd say to me, baby
"I hate you so much, why can't you go away, baby?
I wish you never were"
And she say, she say to me baby
"I hate you so much, you're nothing to me
Nothing to me baby. I wish you never were"
You never were, you never were
You never were, baby
You never were, I wish you never were
You never were, you never were
