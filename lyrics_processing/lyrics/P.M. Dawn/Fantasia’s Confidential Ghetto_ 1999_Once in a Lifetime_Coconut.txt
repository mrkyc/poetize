I was dreaming when I wrote this, forgive me if it goes astray
When I woke up this morning could've sworn it was Judgement Day
The sky was all purple, there were people running everywhere
Trying to run from my destruction, even though I didn't even care

They say 2000, zero-zero, party's over, whoops out of time
So tonight, I'm gonna party like it's 1999
They say 2000, zero-zero, party's over, whoops out of time
So tonight, I'm gonna cry like it's 1999

Once in a Lifetime

Time isn't holding us, time isn't after us
Time isn't holding us, time isn't after us
Letting the days go by, letting the days go by
Letting the days go by, letting the days go by

You may find yourself living in a shack and shack
You may find yourself in another part of the world
You may find yourself behind the wheel of a large automobile
You may find yourself with a beautiful house, with a beautiful wife
You may ask yourself, how did I get here
You might also like
Letting the days go by, let the water hold me down
Letting the days go by, water flowing under ground
Into the pool again, after the money's gone
Once in a lifetime, water flowing under ground

You may ask your self where is this house
You may ask yourself where does this highway go
You may ask yourself am I right or wrong
You may ask yourself "my god, what have I done? "

Letting the days go by, let the water hold me down
Letting the days go by, water flowing under ground
Into the pool again, after the money's gone
Once in a lifetime, water flowing under ground

Same as it ever was, same as it ever was
Coconut
Someone had a coconut and bought it for a dime
Someone had another one and paid it for a lime
We put the lime in the coconut and drank them both up
We put the lime in the coconut and drank them both up
We put the lime in the coconut and drank them both up
We put the lime in the coconut and prayed to God it would wake him up
And said, Doctor, ain't there nothin' I can take
I say, doctor, to relieve this bellyache?
I say, doctor, ain't there nothin' I can take
I say, doctor, to relieve this bellyache?

I say, doctor, to relieve this bellyache?
I say, doctor, ain't there nothin' I can take
I say, doctor, to relieve this bellyache?
You put the lime in the coconut, you drink 'em both together
Put the lime in the coconut, then you feel better
Put the lime in the coconut, drink 'em both up
Put the lime in the coconut, and call me in the morning
Doo-doo-doo, doo-ooh-ooh, doo-ooh-ooh
Doo-doo-doo, doo-ooh-ooh, doo-ooh-ooh
Doo-doo-doo, doo-ooh-ooh, doo-ooh-ooh
