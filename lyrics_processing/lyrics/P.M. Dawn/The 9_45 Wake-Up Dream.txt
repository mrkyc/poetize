I possess the image at about 10:15
Reality paints the picture at about 5:25
And I'm like, "How much sugar do you take in your dreams?"
So I practice complicity around 9:45
Yeah, that's right (9:45)
Yeah, that's right (9:45)
Unending, life
Are you in my mind?
Are all my dreams mine?
Wake me up at 9:45 (oh, life)
Do you believe in time?
Do you love your life?
Wake me up at 9:45
Destiny writes direction at about 9:45
I receive the visions at about 10:18
Reality drives perception 'till about 5 after 5
And I'm like, "Angels always saturate your schemes"
So I practice complicity around 9:45
So I dream (9:45)
Yes, I dream (9:45)
So infinite, life
Are you in my mind?
Are all my dreams mine?
Wake me up at 9:45 (oh, life)
Do you believe in time?
Do you love your life?
Wake me up at 9:45
You might also likeHere's your chance to be unstable
Here's your chance to be unsatisfied
Here's your chance to dream just like me
Realizing we've been fantasized
No need to Christianize me
No need to antagonize my life
No need to actualize me
('Cause you've just been bitten)
Destiny sings redemption at about 9:45
I can hear the symphony around 10:19
Reality stops the music at around 5:59
And I'm like, "You can't change the volume in my dreams"
So I practice complicity around 9:45
Existing (9:45)
Infinite (9:45)
Limitless, life
Are you in my mind?
Are all my dreams mine?
Wake me up at 9:45
Do you believe in time?
Do you love your life?
Wake me up at 9:45 (9:45)
Are you in my mind?
Are all my dreams mine?
Wake me up at 9:45 (9:45)
Do you believe in time?
Do you love your life?
