Mr. Wonderful you, you're thinking 'bout life
You're thinkin' 'bout love, you're thinkin' 'bout the ways to break it down
You got eighteen myths and five different ways into the mind
But you're lookin for the verbs and nouns
Po' you, wat'cha wanna do, switch rooms?
And walk around space with your black and blue balloons
No, from what I hear, you used to dance in the face of fear
But now you're runnin from the monkey on the moon
It's 12 o'clock, what makes a difference in the tides
Exploding paths to dismay, and if so
I'll never catch you with a runaround Sue
Playin peek-a-boo with ribbon in your fro, hell no
If I was to lie, if I was to cheat
Would you see me with a flower in my hand
Then beyond infinite affections
Sit these excuses for all the lies, understand
Beyond infinite affections
Beyond infinite affections
Yo, go beyond infinite affections
Beyond infinite affections
You might also likeImmaculate pains that cultivated in the South
The thought alone to slip a mickey to the mouse
Makes you wonder what kinda force is that
My religion screams, "Punk what you lookin' at"
I thought the voices could have sounded kinda odd
So, I quest the me that said I wasn't into God
I was yellin' screamin' where is the demon?
But that's the kinda vibe that sort of blends in the fog
I dig the norm, skip around metaphors
But I was too through, not to open other doors
I was six plus two, eight plus five
Now it's intense I could experience the vibe
Whatever it takes to fix the tweaks in the speech
If ever I could stop believin' Mr. Man
Then beyond infinite affections
Sit these excuses for all these lies, understand
Beyond infinite affections
Beyond infinite affections
Yo, go beyond infinite affections
Beyond infinite affections, yeah
Do you love me, no
Could you love me? No
Would you try to love me? No
Then I don't think you understand
Break a one break a two, tell me what to do
The room's full, check your psyche or get another spoonful
Caress the silk lines until it turns pink
Another link that wants to push you to the brink
If only distance likes to leave you in the clouds
And fear was merely created by man
Then beyond infinite affections there exists nothing
And nothing understands, God damn it
Beyond infinite affections
Beyond infinite affections
Beyond infinite affections
Beyond infinite affections
