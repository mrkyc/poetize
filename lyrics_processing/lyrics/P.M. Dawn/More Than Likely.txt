What's the use in trying
If all my senses say no place exists for you?
What's the use in holding out my arms?
I couldn't find reasons if I tried to
What's the use in floating
If all it does is tell you someone's under you
What's the use in being if I learn to be
Neglectful to all the things
That mean the most to most of you
But I can hear me say

More than likely I'm the one you're living for
If I find out I am, then I'll finally understand
When I say
More than likely I'm the one you're living for
More than likely (Living for)
More than likely (Living for)

What's the use in praying
For all the things that mean so much to none of you?
What's the use in pouring out my heart
Into situations I could cry through?
You might also likeOh, what's the use in closing
All the doors that let the loving into you?
What's the use of loving If I learn
Not to feel anything at all, even if it means the most to you
But I can hear me say

More than likely I'm the one you're living for
If I find out I am, then I'll finally understand
When I say
More than likely I'm the one you're living for
More than likely (Living for)
More than likely (Living for)

Even if you find
That I'm transcending most of my mind
Through the often closing doors
Of what's to come, and what's in store, oh yeah
Even if because
You find I'm spending most of my love
To the often closed minds that must require
What you're living for
What you're living for
What you're living for
What's the use in clinging (let go)
To all the hopes that leave you somewhere
Next to lies
What's the use in buying all my time
To try and figure out the frame that likes to
Communicate through signs
But I can hear me say

More than likely I'm the one you're living for
If I find out I am, then I'll finally understand
When I say
More than likely I'm the one you're living for
More than likely (Living for)
