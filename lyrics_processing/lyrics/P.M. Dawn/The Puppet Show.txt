And sometimes, sometimes I can't go
Baby plays at the puppet show
And sometimes, sometimes I can't go
I know I can disappear like Shakespeare's Romeo
I know that good things always treat me bad
But don't you think it's strange that I don't know?
(Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes)
Don't you think it's strange that I don't know?
(Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes)
Don't you think it's strange that I don't know?
Baby works at the puppet show
And sometimes, sometimes I don't go
Baby hurts at the puppet show
And sometimes, sometimes I won't go
If I can't make it disappear then I will have to go
I wonder if happiness will meet me there
But classify me strange 'cause I can't go
(Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes)
Classify me strange 'cause I can't go
(Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes)
Classify me strange 'cause I can't go
Baby awakes at the puppet show
And sometimes, sometimes there's no show
Baby freaks from the puppet show
And sometimes, sometimes there's no show
I know that I love you but I'm bleeding all
I know You do a great job of wanting me
But don't you think it's strange, I told you so
(Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes)
Don't you think it's strange, I told you so
(Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes)
Don't you think it's strange, I told you so
Baby works at the puppet show
And sometimes, sometimes I can't go
Baby plays at the puppet show
And sometimes, sometimes I can't go
Baby works at the puppet show
And sometimes, sometimes I can't go
Baby hurts at the puppet show
And I'm just trying to understand you
I'm just trying to understand you
I'm just trying to understand you
I'm just trying to understand you
I'm just trying to understand you
I'm just trying to understand you
I'm just trying to understand you
I'm just trying to understand you
I'm just trying to understand you
