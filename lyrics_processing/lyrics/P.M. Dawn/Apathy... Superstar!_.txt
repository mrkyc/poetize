I guess I'm not so into you...
It's unfortunate I'm not used to any other space
Lately... I've been trying to erase me...
See I'm not into hating me
I've already been driving me crazy, but I can concentrate
Reach me, 'cause I got you babe completely...
Am I unsure? Absolutely
You contaminate me so well I believe you now
Truly I care about you so deeply...
God I wish I believed me...
I wonder you so much
I've been touched
I think everything's okay... I mean if everything's alright...
Almost everyone I know believes in God and Love...
So if everything's okay... I mean if everything's alright...
Well then Sympathy you should be the superstar that you are
Just say so... Give the word and I'm Vertigo...
The existential Romeo
My emotions teach me well with... a God complex
Teach me... this anger tries to impeach me
And considerate idiosyncrasies damaged me so well
That I can't tell
'Cause I think everything's okay... I mean if everything's alright...
Almost everyone I know believes in God and Love...
So if everything's okay... I mean if everything's alright...
Well then Sympathy you should be the superstar that you are
Dr. Strangelove you should be Dr. Estrangedlove...
Everything that ever was
You're so lucky you get to be you and you're all the time
I do everything with you despite you
See I don't dance but I try to
Apathy knows you well 'cause you're a superstar
And everything's okay... I mean everything's alright...
Almost everyone I know believes in God and Love...
So if everything's okay... I mean everything's alright...
Well then Sympathy you should be the superstar that you are
You might also like(repeat chorus)
Oh Sympathy, you should be the star that you are
Oh Sympathy, you should be the star that you are
Sympathy, you should be the star that you are
