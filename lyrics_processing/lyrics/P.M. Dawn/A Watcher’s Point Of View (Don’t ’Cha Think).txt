He who thinks, thinks for himself
And one on a trip makes a hit for the mind
A true composer's Hell between ears
Or P.M. Dawn makes cause for rewind
Mega Million drops along upon a thought
A comatose nap might snatch ya' sanity
I'm so great, I amaze myself
It explains just how vain is vanity
The longest journey is based on a trip
But also starts with a single step
Because Pleasant Valley Sunday is a grain of salt
But Now or Never's a bit hard to accept, don't 'cha think?

Problems of the world, numbers, girls, and things of that nature are bound to break my heart
They all show different sides of me when they all wrapped up inside of me
I feel certain awe for those who fall to find out they're in rain with shadow from the stars
The dawn still scrapes up all the clues (Even from a watcher's point of view)

Yo, the world doesn't pay for what a person knows
And rarely wants to pay for what a person does
But those who care show a puzzle and stare
Singin', "What it is is what it was'
'Cause he who learns the rules of wisdom
Without transforming it to daily life
Has a bad condition of contradiction
A rap like that can slap back afterlife
All this twists and spins in a whirlwind
A spot to max at to where it remains
On the opposite lane of a fortress bridge
Or the thought that lives on a positive plane, don't 'cha think?

Reality and death, they accompany life
Eternity and judgement accompany death
The simplest thing to remember, really
But the clogged the fog the mind's forget
Saved in the mystery of all mankind lies
Certain arrogance to the unexplained
Pure imagination is based on fact
Shun the confusion it's made to contains
For the true definition of the phrase is a dream
A dream that encloses a question mark
The end of an era in the halls of a mind
That should've been watched and clocked from the start, don't 'cha think?

Maybe they just wanna twist my finger
Maybe they just wanna break my arm
Maybe they just wanna try and stop me
Maybe they just wanna do me harm
Maybe they don't want my mouth to speak this
Maybe they just want a quiet moan
But the minute I step to the rhythm of the left
That's the minute that they don't wanna leave me alone, don't 'cha think?
