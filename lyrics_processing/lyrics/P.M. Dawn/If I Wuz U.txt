If I was you, if I was you, if I was you
If I was you, if I was you, if I was you
If I was you, if I was you, if I was you
If I was you, if I was you, if I was you

So surreal, so surreal
So surreal that it can't be real
I'm just so afraid of banana peels
A wandering eye does not have sex appeal
I'm 99 and a half light years away
And they expect me to be okay
They see me in some other light
But who told them that I wasn't alright?
Get with it, said the Prince to the Be
Don't you realize that they can't see
That's cool, I'm in a tranquil state
But I can't see why they don't calculate
Prince, how come your eyes look blue?
If only ya had my eyes to look through
Mellowin' out is what ya need to do
Huh, only if I was you
You might also like
If I was you, if I was you, if I was you
If I was you, if I was you, if I was you
If I was you, if I was you, if I was you
If I was you, if I was you, if I was you

I guess I'm supposed to go crazy, is that what it is?
Tryin' to pass this quiz
Mirror, mirror, what'cha got for me?
Since I'm you and you're just so me
I know they've lost themselves instead
I know that destiny's face is red
I can see my rainbow's real sweet
But for that quick quiz I gotta crib sheet
So what's the matter, you? Why do ya look sad?
Man, this world doesn't look so bad
What's the deal with the heel of a shoe?
Why's an ankle such a red kangaroo?
It all depends on the way I think
A watcher's point of view, don't 'cha think
There'd be a time where I wouldn't have a clue
But only if I was you

If I was you, if I was you, if I was you
If I was you, if I was you, if I was you
If I was you, if I was you, if I was you
If I was you, if I was you, if I was you
Poor, poor aristocrat
Shaken down by a pussycat
Thought he was a strong believer in the now
He thought he was up so he got shook down
Deja vu, even I myself
That's why educated guesses I think might help
But a flat-out reading, I don't see how
And things we gotta deal with right now
Like the fact that my complexion may offend you
Environment's protection may contend you
And millions in a quest for synthetic dreams
It's not extreme, I'm pulling at the seams
I don't wait so it don't bother me
But please forgive me if I act 
Save debate for another part of me
But only if I was you

If I was you, if I was you, if I was you
If I was you, if I was you, if I was you
If I was you, if I was you, if I was you
If I was you, if I was you, if I was you

If I was you, I think I'd find my way to the stars
If I was you, I think I'd let me out of my jar
If I was you, I don't think that I could ever be real
If I was you, I think  the way that I feel
If I was you
If I was you, if I was you, if I was you
If I was you, if I was you, if I was you
If I was you, if I was you, if I was you
If I was you, if I was you, if I was you
If I was you, if I was you, if I was you
If I was you, if I was you, if I was you
If I was you, if I was you, if I was you
