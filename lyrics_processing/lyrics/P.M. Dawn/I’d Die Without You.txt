Is it my turn, to wish you were lying here?
I tend to dream you when I'm not sleeping
Is it my turn to fictionalize my world?
Or even imagine your emotions, tell myself anything, yeah
Is it my turn, to hold you by your hands?
Tell you I love you and you not hear me
Is it my turn to totally understand?
To watch you walk out of my life and not do a damn thing

If I have to give away the feeling that I feel, yeah
If I have to sacrifice oh, whatever babe, whatever baby
If I have to take apart all that I am
Is there anything that I would not do

'Cause inside I'd die without you
Yeah baby, 'cause I'd die without you
'Cause inside I'd die without you

Oh, I apologize for all the things I've done
But now, I'm underwater and I'm drowning
Is it my turn to be the one to cry?
Isn't it amazing how some things just completely turn around?

Yeah, take every little piece of my soul
Yeah, take every little bit of piece of my mind
'Cause if you're gone, inside, I'd die without you

If I have to give away the feeling that I feel, yeah
If I have to sacrifice oh, whatever babe, whatever baby
If I have to take apart all that I am
Is there anything that I would not do

'Cause inside I'd die without you
'Cause inside I'd die without you
'Cause inside I'd die without you
Die without you, yeah
'Cause inside I'd die without you
Die without you, I'd die without you
'Cause inside I'd die without you
Die without you
'Cause inside I'd die without you
Die without you, yeah baby
'Cause inside I'd die without you
Die without you
