The most that you want is that your brain cells flex
A quick trip starts with the questions and ode
And why is everybody in a riff raff mode
It builds and it builds to the point of combustion
My finger's in the hole to prevent an eruption
But it melts and the heartfelt deal is dealt
I'd kill myself, if I thought that it would help
But it wouldn't, well, I'd come back of course
You look at me now like I'm a fool with a cross
Jesus, help me, I'm obsessed with peace
So open all the eyes so the rest of them see
That peace of the mind has an intricate session
So never should you ever relax on the question
Of whether or not you're gonna crush that trait
I do it to defy the fate and recreate another scene
Never cross the lines but somewhere in between
A wind from the wing of the right trapeze
As to activate the trip before you count to 18 or 19
Or shake your tambourine
Peace, what I wouldn't do for you
But it's deja vu without an ounce of virtue
A man to man or three hate hexagram, damn
For the love of peace
You might also likeEmotions like to play me like a pawn
But Prince Be deciphers the P.M. Dawn
But what do you get when the candlestick's lit
And reveals all the code in the deep dark crypt
The true blue colors of a quiet storm
Utopians sigh while the rest perform
They say, "Mi casa, su casa"
But don't come around me unless ya have ta
Now everybody wants to play the violin
They ask me where does my pride begin
They want a guide, a soul brother number one
A quest has begun that you can't outrun
But whose fault is that, that you swung that rope
The purple one makes a point, and I quote
Sometimes it snows in April
