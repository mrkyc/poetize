I'll be waiting for you
Even if it takes you all of your life (You all your life)
I'll be waiting for you
'Til you know within yourself that you are so divine

Baby, baby
I know what you want from you
Can you see me? I'm divinity
And I can mean so much to you
You're like the moon, you're like the stars, you're like the sun
It'll take more than just a lifetime
To understand where we are
So patience is nothing
'Cause I'll do anything for you

I'll be waiting for you (You, baby)
Even if it takes you all of your life (All your life)
I'll be waiting for you (waiting for you)
'Til you know within yourself that you are so divine (Oh)

Baby, oh tell me
Why must there be pain with you?
Your precious emotions
When will they be free from you?
You're like the moon, you're like the stars, you're like the sun
And everything else I need that confuses me so much
So baby, don't hate me
'Cause I've seen better things in you
You might also like
I'll be waiting for you (Oh, I'll be waiting for you, baby)
Even if it takes you all of your life (All, all your life)
I'll be waiting for you (Waiting for you)
'Til you know within yourself that you are so divine
'vine

Oh, see you're like the moon, you're like the stars, you're like the sun
And I can bet that you matter but I'm having too much fun
So maybe, baby, love will save me
And I can keep your hate from you

I'll be waiting for you (Oh, I'll be waiting for you, baby)
Even if it takes you all of your life (All, all your life)
I'll be waiting for you (I'll be waiting for you)
'Til you know within yourself that you are so divine
I'll be waiting for you (Oh, baby, oh)
Even if it takes you all of your life (All your life, life)
I'll be waiting for you (All your life, oh)
'Til you know within yourself that you are so divine (So divine, baby)
I'll be waiting for you (So divine, baby, so divine)
Even if it takes you all of your life (All, all your life)
I'll be waiting for you (I'll be, I'll be)
