That's why sometimes I still speak talk that slang
I still crank that pa?yne im zoning thinking that im in the everglades mang
Creep up on to the shack real slow
And you might understand where this gunna go
And when I give it to you my mic gonna blow
Welcome to the world of the hip hop show
I'm laid back on the place just chillin'
And when I get excited when it's something that I'm feelin'
And when it comes to money I be sayin "kill billin"
Got my pen and paper let my thoughts start spillin'
They say they all stand soul to the hip hop break
Different styles, versatile, so we gave it a twist
And it can easily be classified a new hit
And we still got living legends so we got that hip
They say hip-hop changed
But you know we still talk that language
Just another twist in the shit that we bring
And hip-hop saved my life So I framed it
They say hip-hop changed
But you know we still talk that language
Just another twist in the shit that we bring
And hip-hop saved my life So I framed it
And what's going down when you hear that de?ep sound
Please be n call when you come through my town
Cause stakes is around and we all want that crown
? and Rappers got them shootin' shit down
All think we G, but what could it be
The media, the radio, maybe tv
Or could it be that we was raised in the hood
And still got that swagger always and for good
SO, I looked up in the sky and heard a million records
Crying out for the prize, the day gunna come
And we all gonna rise
Got a pension for this shit so everyday we try
But I think I try hard enough started rockin' out clubs
Banging hard in another?
Showin love to the homies and the brothers
Hip-hop-anatic, real talk undacover
They say hip-hop changed
But you know we still talk that language
Just another twist in the shit that we bring
And hip-hop saved my life So I framed it
They say hip-hop changed
But you know we still talk that language
Just another twist in the shit that we bring
And hip-hop saved my life So I framed it
In the streets still hang
That's why sometimes I still speak talk that slang
I still crank that pa?yne I'm zoning thinking that I'm in the everglades mang
Creep up on to the shack real slow
And you might understand where this gunna go
And when I give it to you my mic gonna blow
Welcome to the world of the hip hop show
Still got living legends so we got that hip (x8)
So, So, everyday day-day-day-day
Every day-y-y-y-y we try
Hip-hop changed
Hip-hop changed
