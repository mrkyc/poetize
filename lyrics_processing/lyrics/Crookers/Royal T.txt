I can let you have, I can let you have
I can let you have, I can let you have your way
I can let you have, I can let you have
I can let you have, I can let you have your way
Let you have your way
I can let you have, I can let you have
I can let you have, I can let you have your way
Let you have your way
I can let you have, I can let you have, I can, I can, I can

I can let you have your say
I can hear a warning, if you can avoid it
I don't need to care too much
Any way you play with it
You can get away with it
I don't wanna cry no more
What I gotta take it for?
And if the truth were told
I would put it all on hold
Just for another hour in bed with you
So I'm gonna need to steal your flow
Baby I can't let you go
Anytime you say so
Baby I can let you know

Oh, I don't wanna hear the alarm
You don't have to use your charm
You don't have to break my arm
Sleeping dogs'll always lie
I decide when I decide
I am in the mood right now
Baby, baby
I don't wanna hear the alarm
You don't have to use your charm
You don't have to break my arm
Sleeping dogs'll always lie
I decide when I decide
I am in the mood right now
Baby come here
I don't wanna hear the alarm
You don't have to use your charm
You don't have to break my arm
Sleeping dogs'll always lie
I decide when I decide
I am in the mood right now
Baby can we do it right now
Save me from the truth, oh, how
I don't wanna hear the alarm
I don't have to feel your charm, charm, charm, charm
You don't have to break my arm
I don't have to feel your charm, charm, charm, charm
I don't wanna hear the alarm
I don't have to feel your charm, charm, charm, charm
You don't have to break my arm
I don't have to feel your charm, charm, charm, charm
I don't wanna hear the alarm

This bird in the hen
Is time without plans
No chiming of bells
No stopping a wreck
No sense of a threat
No sound of alarm
I don't have to feel your charm, charm, charm, charm
You don't have to break my arm

No I don't wanna count the cause
I don't wanna love too much
Couldn't give it all away
And I pray for another way
Oh, I cannot describe it
I don't wanna try it
Because we left it undecided
Opinions divided
Oh, now I gotta live in a head, like an unmade bed
When you're forced to give me hope
And I can't cope
Maybe I can steady your flow
Tell me what you know
How to make a true love grow
How to make a true love grow
How to make a true love grow

I don't wanna hear the alarm
You don't have to use your charm
You don't have to break my arm
Sleeping dogs'll always lie
I decide when I decide
I am in the mood right now
Baby, baby
I don't wanna hear the alarm
You don't have to use your charm
You don't have to break my arm
Sleeping dogs'll always lie
I decide when I decide
I am in the mood right now
Baby, baby
I don't wanna hear the alarm
You don't have to use your charm
Sleeping dogs'll always lie
I decide when I decide
I am in the mood right now
Baby can we
I don't wanna hear the alarm
You don't have to use your charm
You don't have to break my arm
Sleeping dogs'll always lie
I decide when I decide
I am in the mood right now
Baby can we do it right now
Save me from the truth or how
I don't wanna hear the alarm

I don't have to feel your charm, charm, charm, charm
You don't have to break my arm
I don't have to feel your charm, charm, charm, charm
