To be in love with a reflection?
You wanna win, just like them
Don't confess, you're more or less like them
So sorry, I'm so sorry
I didn't mean it
I'm disappearing and I'm so so sorry
I ask myself
Why would I answer?
You're the chosen one
Why would I answer?
You've already won
Why would I answer?
You're the poisoned one
Why would I answer?
That's what you want
Calling me out with a sick little pout
Poor baby, I doubt that's what it's really about
Living it up isn't making the cut
You're not making the cut being something you're not
Go live it up, go be in love
Be so in love with your reflection
You wanna win, just like them
Don't confess that you're just like them
You might also likeSo sorry, I'm so so sorry
You paint your flag black
You're disappearing and I'm so so sorry
But you're not yourself
Why would I answer?
You're the chosen one
Why would I answer?
You've already won
Why would I answer?
You're the poisoned one
Why would I answer?
That's what you want
Why would I answer?
That's what you want
What would I ask you
If you didn't mind?
Why would I ask you
To decide, decide, decide
Decide, decide, my side?
Decide your side and my side
Decide
Decide
Your side, your side and my side
Inside, inside our insides
Your side, your side and my side
Our side, our side, our side
I'm not sorry, your side of the story
You didn't mean it
You're disappearing and I'm not that sorry
That you hate yourself
Why would I answer?
You're the chosen one
Why would I answer?
You've already won
Why would I answer?
You're the poisoned one
Why would I answer?
That's what you want
Why would I answer?
Why would I answer?
