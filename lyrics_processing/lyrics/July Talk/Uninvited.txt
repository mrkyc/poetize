We came here uninvited
Our blood gets so excited
I can't feel my body anymore
I can't tell where your voice is coming from
Heard about it your mother's know the place
Felt the beat better lighting up your voice
She wants me, but she's married
Looks good let's not get carried away

So they left us to the night again
I'm gonna make it mine

I just wanted you I needed you to know
I just wanted you I needed you to know
And we know they'll say I told you so
We do this all the time
I just wanted you I needed you to know
I just wanted you I needed you to know

You're okay to travel through the crowd
I'm alright, but these lights are way too loud
Nothing wakes me up like you do
Nothing wears me out like you do
You might also likeNew air is entering our lungs
And we're speaking with brand new tongues
No one gets it quite like you do
No regrets lets see this night through

When I lose you in the crowd tonight
Know I'm gonna be fine

I just wanted you I needed you to know
I just wanted you I needed you to know
So if you see something that you like
Tell me what you find
I just wanted you I needed you to know
I just wanted you I needed you to know
Just wait
Just wait
Just wait
Just wait
Just wait
Thanks for calling I made it under time (Just wait)
Thanks for holding I made it up your line (Just wait)
No one wakes me up like you do (Just wait)
Nothing wears me out like you do (Just wait)
And I'll find you in the crowd tonight
Just like every time
I just wanted you I needed you to know
I just wanted you I needed you to know
All the come down kings will fall apart
Fall together fine
I just wanted you I needed you to know
I just wanted you I needed you to know
You're all I need you can come and go
