Aiyo, I stand outside the gates of Buckingham Palace sellin' reefer
Puffin' the chalice with the Beefeaters
Gettin' so high that whenever I drop shit
It'll land on the window of your airplane cockpit
Canibus with the hot shit, crazy hot clique
Niggas is bloody idiots thinkin' they can stop this
I'll increase my strength to a superhuman extent
Nigga, your rhyme ain't worth six pence
And if you can hear, smell, see, touch and taste
Then you don't need six senses to feel me punch you in the face
From Brixton to Clapham Common
My lyrics invade Europe like Joseph Stalin and murder niggas for rhymin'
Spittin' fire with gasoline for saliva
Drunk as Lady Diana's driver with reporters behind her
Alcohol in the hands of a minor
I got you panickin' like bombs with 30 second timers
Clear the building, evacuate women and children
Fuck what you feelin', nigga, I came here to kill 'em
Straight shittin' from New York to Great Britain
And when we do shows, we make the Queen pay admission
What?!

When I say, "Can-I," you say, "Bus"
Can-I (Bus!), Can-I, (Bus!)
Yo, when I say, "Can-I," you say, "Bus"
Can-I (Bus!), Can-I, (Bus!)
Yo, yo, yo

Prepare for the worst, this next verse is the Face of Death
Me without lyrics is like a porn flick without sex
Illmatic, my lyrical skills are Jurassic
With more flavor than Skittles when I'm digitally mastered
I go off like a cannon and blow up the planet
With No Fear like them clothes white boys be wearin'
I'm tougher than denim, lethal like venomous snake bites
The marijuana makes my eyes bright red like brake lights
There ain't a party I couldn't rock, believe that
There ain't a microphone brave enough to give me feedback
I'm strong, my word is Bond like James
Niggas be tryna test but they weak like seven days
MCs run away when I kick it
They act so chicken they should come with a large drink and a biscuit
My style's radioactive, massive, atomic
I plan to push the Earth in front of Halley's Comet
Breakin' the facts of life down like Tootie
I'm raw like sushi, with more Vocab than three fuckin' Fugees
So recognize or be hospitalized
'Cause lyrically on a scale of 1 to 10, I'm 25

When I say, "Can-I," you say, "Bus"
Can-I (Bus!), Can-I, (Bus!)
Yo, when I say, "Can-I," you say, "Bus"
Can-I (Bus!), Can-I, (Bus!)
Yo! Yo! A little bit of weed and some Hennessy
Got me ready to set it with kinetic energy
See, I need much more energy than my enemies
If I wanna make more Bills than Bellamy
So I could be on MTV
With women constantly tellin' me I resemble Billy Dee
I make fly rhymes to get my name on the scene
Then when I'm on the scene, I do shows to get the green
Then I take the green, buy a automobile machine
For that thing on page 43 in Jet Magazine
Canibus is the ultimate executioner's dream
Swingin' the guillotine
'Cause whenever the head is severed from the human body with a sharp enough weapon
The brain remains conscious for ten seconds
Long enough for me to give you one last message
And when you get to Hell you can tell Lucifer I said it
Don't ever get it confused
Fuckin' with Canibus the human Rubik's Cube like you got somethin' to prove
Yo, whoever grabs the mic after me get booed
Get everythin' in the club thrown at you and your crew
From Moet bottles to bar stools, fruits and foods
You got a album out? You get hit with your CD, too
Runnin' outside cryin', lyin', denyin'
That you ain't The Gay Rapper, but you got fucked by him
What's the difference? Y'all niggas still ain't in lyrical fitness
Too busy mixin' your bidness with your bitches
While I be in the lab composin' forbidden scriptures
So wicked I got Satan ejaculatin' on his fingers
Like Dirk Diggler in the middle of Boogie Nights
Sniffin' white, livin' the hype, he ruined his life
But I'm an MC of a different type, yeah, that's right!
Make sure your shit is tight or I'ma snatch your mic, nigga
When I say, "Can-I," you say, "Bus"
Can-I (Bus!), Can-I, (Bus!)
Yo, when I say, "Can-I," you say, "Bus"
