A thousand times I've failed
Still Your Mercy remains
Should I stumble again
Still I'm caught in Your Grace
Everlasting
Your Light will shine when all else fades
Never ending
Your Glory goes beyond all fame

Your Will above all else
My purpose remains
The art of losing myself
In bringing You praise
Everlasting
Your Light will shine when all else fades
Never ending
Your Glory goes beyond all fame, yeah

In my heart, in my soul
Well, I give You control
Consume me from the inside out, Lord
Let justice and praise
Become my embrace
To love You from the inside out
You might also like
Your Will above all else
My purpose remains
The art of losing myself
In bringing You praise
Everlasting
Your Light will shine when all else fades
Never ending
Your Glory goes beyond all fame, yeah

In my heart, in my soul
Well, I give You control
Consume me from the inside out, Lord
Let justice and praise
Become my embrace
To love You from the inside out

Everlasting
Your Light will shine when all else fades
Never ending
Your Glory goes beyond all fame
And the cry of my heart is to bring You praise
From the inside out
Lord, my soul cries out, oh

In my heart, in my soul
Well, I give You control
Consume me from the inside out, Lord
Let justice and praise
Become my embrace
To love You from the inside out

Everlasting
Your Light will shine when all else fades
Never ending
Your Glory goes beyond all fame
And the cry of my heart is to bring You praise
From the inside out
Lord, my soul cries out
Everlasting
Your Light will shine when all else fades
Never ending
Your Glory goes beyond all fame
And the cry of my heart is to bring You praise
From the inside out
Lord, my soul cries out
From the inside out
