My heart a storm
Clouds raging deep within
The Prince of Peace
Came bursting through the wind
The violent sky held its breath
And in Your light I found rest

Tearing through the night
Riding on the storm
Staring down the fight
My eyes found Yours
Shining like the sun
Striding through my fear
The Prince of Peace met me there
You heard my prayer

Hope like the sun
Light piercing through the dark
The Prince of Peace
Came and broke into my heart
The violent cross
The empty grave
And in Your light I found grace
You might also like
Tearing through the night
Riding on the storm
Staring down the fight
My eyes found Yours
Shining like the sun
Striding through my fear
The Prince of Peace met me there
You're always there
You heard my prayer

Your love surrounds me
When my thoughts wage war
When night screams terror
There Your voice will roar
Come death or shadow
God I know Your light will meet me there
When fear comes knocking
There You'll be my guard
When day breeds trouble
There You'll hold my heart
Come storm or battle
God I know
Your peace will meet me there
Again and again
Oh be still my heart
And know
That You are God
Oh fear no evil
For I know You are here

And my soul will know
Your love surrounds me
When my thoughts wage war
When night screams terror
There Your voice will roar
Come death or shadow
God I know Your light will meet me there
And my soul will know
When fear comes knocking
There You'll be my guard
When day breeds trouble
There You'll hold my heart
Come storm or battle
God I know
Your peace will meet me there

Oh, be still my heart
And my soul will ever know
That You are God
