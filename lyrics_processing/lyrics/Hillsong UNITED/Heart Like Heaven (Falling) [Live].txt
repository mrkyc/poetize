Holy
No measure knows Your worth
Face down
Where mercy finds me first

If You sought perfection
I'd die trying to reach it
But this broken heart is all You want

Singing holy
Heart like heaven
Singing holy
God Almighty
Own this heart broke sound
Singing holy is Your Name

Jesus
How perfect is Your name
Savior
What song is worth this grace

And I'll throw my weakness
Into Your greatness
If this broken heart is all You want
You might also like
Singing holy
Heart like heaven
Singing holy
God Almighty
Own this heart broke sound
Singing holy is Your Name
Singing holy
Heart like heaven
Singing holy
God Almighty
Own this heart broke sound
Singing holy is Your Name

Own the sound forever
Heart and heaven together
Singing holy is Your Name
And if it lifts You higher
Burn in me Your desire
A passion worthy of Your Name
Own the sound forever
Heart and heaven together
Singing holy is Your Name
And if it lifts You higher
Burn in me Your desire
A passion worthy of Your Name
For You are worthy
Jesus Saviour
You are worthy
King forever
Hear my soul cry out
Singing holy is Your Name

Singing holy
Heart like heaven
Singing holy
God Almighty
Own this heart broke sound
Singing holy is Your Name
Singing holy is Your Name

I'm falling
Falling to my knees
At Your feet I surrender
I'm falling
Falling to my knees
At Your feet I surrender
I'm falling
Falling to my knees
At Your feet I surrender
I'm falling
Falling to my knees
At Your feet I surrender
I'm falling
Falling to my knees
At Your feet I surrender
I'm falling
Falling to my knees
At Your feet I surrender
I'm falling
Falling to my knees
At Your feet I surrender
I'm falling
