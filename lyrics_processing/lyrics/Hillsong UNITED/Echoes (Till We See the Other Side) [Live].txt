So we will sing
We will dance
Till the earth echoes the heavens
Sing His praise
Till we see the other side

'Cause we belong to the light
When the night is at its darkest
Just hold on for the dawn will soon arrive

Can you feel the winds are changing
There's a new day on the rise
And the atmosphere is breaking
As the new world comes to life
So we will sing
We will dance
Till the earth echoes the heavens
Sing His praise
Till we see the other side

Can you feel the winds are changing
There's a new day on the rise
And the atmosphere is breaking
As the new world comes to life

As the graveyards spring to life
