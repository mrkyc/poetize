I went into town to see you yesterday
But you were not home
So I talked to some old friends for a while
Before I wandered off alone

It's so hard for me now
But I'll make it somehow
Though I know I'll never be the same
Won't you ever change your ways
It's so hard to make love pay
When you're on the losing end
And I feel that way again

Well, I miss you more than ever
Since you've gone, I can hardly maintain
Things are different round here every night
My tears fall down like rain

It's so hard for me now
But I'll make it somehow
Though I know I'll never be the same
Won't you ever change your ways
It's so hard to make love pay
When you're on the losing end
And I feel that way again
Alright Wilson, pick it!

When you're on the losing end
