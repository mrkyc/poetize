Round and round and round we spin
To weave a wall to hem us in
It won't be long, it won't be long
How slow and slow and slow it goes
To mend the tear that always shows
It won't be long, it won't be long

It's hard enough losing the paper illusion
You've hidden inside
Without the confusion of finding you're using
The crutch of the lie
To shelter your pride when you cry

Round and round and round we spin
To weave a wall to hem us in
It won't be long, it won't be long
How slow and slow and slow it goes
To mend the tear that always shows
It won't be long, it won't be long

Now you're movin' too slow and wherever you go
There's another beside
It's so hard to say no to yourself and it shows
That you're losing inside
When you step on your pride and you cry
You might also like
Round and round and round we spin
To weave a wall to hem us in
It won't be long, it won't be long
How slow and slow and slow it goes
To mend the tear that always shows
It won't be long, it won't be long

How the hours will bend through the time that you spend
Till you turn to your eyes
And you see your best friend looking over the end
And you turn to see why
And he looks in your eyes and he cries

Round and round and round we spin
To weave a wall to hem us in
It won't be long, it won't be long
How slow and slow and slow it goes
To mend the tear that always shows
