I'm afraid that I'm gonna hurt you, Mary
Drag you down into the mud
In my head, they're taking bets on the day when you say you've had enough
And my problem isn't all my baggage
But how I let it get to me
Having trouble tryin' to accept the fact that someone could love me

Listen, I just need some time
(You see the truth is heavy)
I don't ever get this far
By now I'm always gone
Listen, I just need some time
(You see the truth is heavy)
I don't ever get this far
I'm trying to hold on

You said darling, there's no need to worry
I'm not going anywhere
You can come to me with any problem
There ain't nothing you can't share
But then I think of all your other options
All those happy memories
You could have with someone who ain't fighting with himself regularly
You might also like
Listen, I just need some time
(You see the truth is heavy)
I don't ever get this far
By now I'm always gone
Listen, I just need some time
(You see the truth is heavy)
I don't ever get this far
I'm trying to hold on

I keep on looking at the door
Just wait it out a little more
I keep on lookin' at the door
Just wait it out a little more
I keep on looking at the door
Just wait it out a little more
I keep on looking at the door

Listen, I just need some time
(You see the truth is heavy)
I don't ever get this far
By now I'm always gone
Listen, I just need some time
(You see the truth is heavy)
I don't ever get this far
By now I'm always gone
Listen, I just need some time
(You see the truth is heavy)
I don't ever get this far
