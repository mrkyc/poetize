There's not too much to say
What can move a heart
When love goes on its way?
I know you, I know what I want to
It took a while to show it
There's no lie, no need to compromise
When the truth arrives you'll know it
We're very good friends today
With all of the heartache in the past
Now I can trust you all the way
Cause I know you for who you are
When all of the judgments fall away
There's only the love that we began with
We're very good friends today
I let it go, you let it go, we left it all behind us
I can be a good friend to you
I let it go, you let it go, we left it all behind us
People change with time
In ways no one can say
Love can change a life
Make sense of all the pain
You might also likeA very bad storm today
And only the thunder in the skies
Could lead to a rainbow come what may
Cause I've been through the tears and pain
When all of the anger falls away
There's only the love that we began with
We're very good friends today
I let it go, you let it go, we left it all behind us
I can be a good friend to you
I let it go, you let it go, we left it all behind us
We're very good friends today
I let it go, you let it go, we left it all behind us
I can be a good friend to you (so long)
I let it go, you let it go, we left it all behind us
(good-bye) (good-bye)
So long, so long
Good-bye, good-bye
So long, so long
Good-bye, good-bye
So long, so long
Good-bye, good-bye
So long, so long
