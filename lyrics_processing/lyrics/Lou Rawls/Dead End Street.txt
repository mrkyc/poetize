I was born in a city that they call the Windy City
And they called it the Windy City because of the Hawk
The Hawk, the almighty Hawk, Mr. Wind
Takes care of plenty business around wintertime
The place that I lived in
Was on a street that, uh, happened to be one of the dead end streets
Where there was nothing to block the wind, the elements
Nothing to buffer them for me to keep them from knockin' my pad down, you know
I mean, really sockin' it to me
When the boiler would bust and the heat was gone
I had to get fully dressed before I could go to bed
Of course, I couldn't put on my goulashes 'cause they had buckles on them
And my folks didn't play that
They said "Don't you tear up my bed clothes with some goulashes on"
But I was fortunate
Soon as I was big enough to get a job and save enough money
To get a ticket to catch anything I'll split
I said one day I'm gon' return
And I'm gon' straighten it all out
And I'm 'bout ready to go back now
So I thought I'd tell you about it

They say this is a big rich town
But I live in the poorest part
I know I'm on a dead end street
In a city without a heart
I learned to fight before I was six
The only way I could get along
But when you're raised on a dead end street
You've gotta be tough and strong
Now all the guys I know are getting in trouble
That's how it's always been
When the odds are all against you
How can you win, yeah, yeah, yeah
A-Lordy now, yeah
You might also like
I'm gonna push my way out of here
Even though I can't say when
But I'm gonna get off of this dead end street
And I ain't never gonna come back again
Never
No, no, no
Gon' get outta here
I'm gonna push my way out of here
Even though I can't say when
But I'm gonna to get off of this dead end street
And I ain't gonna never come back again
No, no, no
I ain't gon' come back to this city street no more

No, 'cause I'm gon' get me a job
I'm gonna save my dough
Get away from here
I ain't gon' come back no more
I'm tired of a dead end street
I wanna get out in the world and learn something
I'm tired of breaking my back
I wanna start using my mind
