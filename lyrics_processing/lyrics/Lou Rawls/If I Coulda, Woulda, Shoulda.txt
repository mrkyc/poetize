I coulda been
A little more understanding
And I'd still be loving you right now
I should have been smarter
I could have used my head
And we'd still be together somehow

If I coulda, woulda, shoulda, that's what folks always say
If I coulda, woulda, shoulda, and it's always too late
I'm saying it now
I'm saying it now

If I woulda stopped it
Before it all got started out
I wouldn't be so sad and lonely without you
I wish there was a way, to turn back the hands of time
I'd do it different, if I had it to do all over again

If I coulda, woulda, shoulda, that's what folks always say
If I coulda, woulda, shoulda, but it's always too late
I'm saying it now (Saying it now)
Saying it now (I'm saying it now)

You know, I'm gonna probably count all my mistakes
I'll never do the same thing same way all over again

'Cause I coulda been
A little more understanding
And I'd still be loving you right now
You know, huh, I could have been smarter
I could have used my head
And we'd still be together somehow

I said if I coulda, woulda, shoulda, that's what folks always say
If I coulda, woulda, shoulda, but it's always too late
I'm saying it now (Saying it now)
Saying it now (I'm saying it now)
Well, if I coulda, woulda, shoulda, ha
If I coulda, woulda, shoulda

How many times have you said that to yourself, or have you heard someone else say it? "You know, if I'da just had, or if I woulda had the chance, you know, I woulda done a lot better than I did, man." Or, you know, like they have big sales, you say, "Boy, if I'da just, if I woulda just went down there to that sale while they was havin' it on I coulda got me some real dynamite bargains, man. I shoulda went down there, you know." We always say that. We always a day late and a dollar short
We always sayin' if I coulda, woulda, shoulda
If I coulda, woulda, shoulda
You know there comes a time in everybody's life when they make that statement
"If I would have just" or "I could have just" or the bottom line is "I should have just." And you always wind up on the outside lookin' in
Talking 'bout, if I coulda woulda shoulda
If I coulda, woulda, shoulda
If I coulda (Woulda, shoulda) I woulda
And I shoulda (If I coulda, woulda, shoulda)
If I coulda, woulda, shoulda
(If I coulda, woulda, shoulda)
If I coulda woulda shoulda
