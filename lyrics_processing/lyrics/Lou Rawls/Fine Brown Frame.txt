Yo, blood, check it out
Boy, is she hittin' on all nine now?
Why don't you vacate gate while I check it out
It is too hip for me, you dig?
Hey, mama

You've got a fine brown frame
And I wonder what could be your name
You look good to me, 'cause all I can see
Is your fine brown frame
Tell me, how long have you been around?
Baby, when did you hit this big town?
I wanna scream 'cause I've never seen
Such a fine brown frame

Now, all that I have is a broken down chair
But I would gladly make you queen on my throne
Don't be a square, why don't you come over here?
'Cause together we could really get it on

Now you've got a fine brown frame
Oh, baby, won't you tell me your name?
You are solid with me 'cause all I can see
Is your fine brown frame
You might also like
You've got a fine brown frame
And I wonder what could be your name
You look good to me, 'cause all I can see
Is your fine brown frame
Tell me, how long have you been around?
Baby, when did you hit this big town?
Now I wanna scream, ow, 'cause I've never seen
Such a fine brown frame

Now, all that I have is a broken down chair
But I would gladly make you king on my throne
Don't be a square, why don't you come over here
Together we could really get it on and on and on

And you've got a fine brown frame
And I wonder, won't you tell me your name?
You're solid with me 'cause all I can see
Is that fine brown frame

Now listen Dinah, Dolly, Madonna, and Mable
They are all fine as mink and sable (Yeah?)
You may not be classed with the elite, baby (I tried)
And you may not be hip to that jive like they talk in the street
Woman, oh, oh, baby, yo
You look like Venus done up in bronze
And I know I'm a clown whenever you're around
Because I'm crazy about (I'm crazy about)
Mad about (I'm mad about)
I'm nuts about (Nuts about)
What? About your fine brown frame
Yeah
