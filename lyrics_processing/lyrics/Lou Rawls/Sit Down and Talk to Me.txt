You sure have changed
I don't know you anymore
You've changed your style
You hardly ever smile
Tell me, is it something that I've done?
Well, you sure have changed
I feel uncomfortable around you
Has time taken toll on this love of ours?
Don't you love me anymore?

Could it be you found another?
Am I losing you for good?
All these questions are going, going through my head
There's nothing wrong with people changing
But please be fair and let me know
'Cause these are the worst days of my life
And I wanna know, I wanna know, I wanna know, I wanna know

'Cause you sure have changed
We're not like we were before
All you've got to do is come on over
Sit down and talk to me
You might also like
Maybe I'll be able to see
Maybe I'll be able to understand
If you sit down and talk to me
(Sit down and talk, talk to me, talk to me, talk to me)
I won't know if you don't say nothing, woman
All you've got to do is sit down
Sit down and talk to me
(Sit down and talk, talk to me, talk to me, talk to me)
I know we can work out our problems if you will just sit down
Why don't you sit down and talk to me
(Sit down and talk, talk to me, talk to me, talk to me)
They say that love is better the second time around
Why don't you sit down, why don't you sit down and talk to me
(Sit down and talk, talk to me, talk to me, talk to me)
I know we can work out our problems, darling, if you will just sit down
Just sit down and talk to me
(Sit down and talk, talk to me, talk to me, talk to me)
I've got a lot of things I wanna clear up with you, darling
Why don't you sit down and talk to me
(Sit down and talk, talk to me, talk to me, talk to me)
I know we can work out our problems every day
If we would just sit down and talk about it, talk to me
(Sit down and talk, talk to me, talk to me, talk to me)
I know I can relieve your problems, darling
I know I can make things better if you would just talk to me
Gonna work out fine, darling
I'm begging you to come on, darling, sit down and talk to me
I know we can work it out between us, darling
All we got to do is sit down and talk about it, talk to me
I can't make it without you, darling
I need you by my side, sit down and talk to me
(Sit down and talk, talk to me, talk to me, talk to me)
Why don't you come on over, darling
Let's sit down and talk about it, baby
Sit down and talk to me
(Sit down and talk, talk to me, talk to me, talk to me)
Well, well, well, well, sit down and talk to me
(Sit down and talk, talk to me, talk to me, talk to me)
