Thank you very much. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. We'd like to welcome you this evening, so glad you came by. We sincerely hope you'll enjoy this that we have all for your listening pleasure. We're gonna attempt to appease your musical appetites by offering you song and music designed to suit your musical tastes. And put a little soul in your bowl. Offering you old and new songs. Some that you might be familiar with, perhaps some that you're not familiar with; however, these that we offer, we hope they will meet your musical approval. This next song is a song that brought about my first Grammy Award nomination in the year 1967. Some of you might remember this one, it was pretty good. Went something like this, it said, huh

For every little kiss, there's a little teardrop
For every single thrill, there is another heartache
And the road is rough
The going gets tough

But love is a hurtin' thing
Love is a hurtin' thing now

When you're in my arms, I'm a king on a throne
When we're apart, I walk the streets alone
One day, happiness
And the next day, loneliness

For love, it is a hurtin' thing
Love is a hurtin' thing now

When love brings so much joy, why must it bring such pain?
I guess it's a mystery that nobody can explain, yeah
Oh yeah
Alright, oh, oh
Ooh baby
My, my, my, my sweet baby
You might also like
I said now maybe I'm a fool if I keep on loving you
But there may come the time you'll break my heart in two
But I want you so
I want you, though I know

That love, it  is a hurtin' thing
Love, it is a hurtin' thing

Love, love is a hurtin' thing, yeah
It can hurt you to your heart
Sometimes it'll break your heart in two
Love is a hurtin' thing
Love can really hurt you sometimes, yes, it can
Yeah
Ha ha ha, thank you so much
