You know, baby
I realize that we've had a lot of misunderstandings
And some harsh words between us
'Cause I couldn't quite get it together
But I'll tell you somethin'
I've decided I'ma go on and straighten up and fly right
You know, take care of business like I'm supposed to?
Tell you what's happenin', darlin'
This is what it's all about
'Cause I know if I take care of you, you gon' take care of me
And that's what I'm talkin' 'bout

Tell you that from now on
Things are gonna be different, baby
Oh, from now on
You are gonna see a change in me

'Cause you've been lovin' me, lovin' me so good
It makes me want to walk a straight line
Say "I love you" sometime
Nowhere will I find someone who does what you do
Since you touched the right spot
Hey, you got me burnin' hot
I got to give you all I've got
All I've got, baby
You might also like
From now on
Things are gonna be different, baby
Oh, from now on
You are gonna see a change in me

Because you've been lovin' me, lovin' me so good
I don't have to run around
A-when I want to get down
Your love ain't hard to find
'Cause you're next to me, baby
Workin' hard every day
Bringin' home all of my pay
Just to hear you say
That you love me, baby

From now on
Things are gonna be different, baby
Oh, from now on
You gonna see a change in me

'Cause you've been lovin' me, lovin' me so good, well
Hey, since you touched the right spot
Oh, you got me burnin' hot
I got to give you all I've got
All I've got, baby

When the times get hard, I think about and go on my way
