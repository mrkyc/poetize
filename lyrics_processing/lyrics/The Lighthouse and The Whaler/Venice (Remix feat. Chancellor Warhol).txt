In your eyes
I have seen
All the feeling and the rain
And death is cold, death is sure
Why don't we all fall in love?
Oh, whoa oh oh
Why don't we fall in love?
Oh, whoa oh oh
Why don't we fall in love
Fall in love
Why don't we, fall in love?
Why don't we?
In your eyes
I have seen
All the feeling and the rain
And death is cold, death is sure
Why don't we all fall in love?
Oh, whoa oh oh
Why don't fall in love?
Oh, who oh oh
Why don't we fall in love?
Fall in love
Why don't we, fall in love?

I think I've seen you in a coma with my eyes closed
I mean a dream, you the ish as far as I know
You a castle in the sky as far as highs go
I keep a S on my cake far as fly go
Girl I know you tired of the ones that betrayed you
Never end the story, still looking for a trade you
Oh, that shit hot I'll trade you
Forget the movies and the black 
Want to fall in love, if we walk its better
I can take you to the beach where the talk is better
Spark together, try to break your heart is never
Said you never met a man that can talk, just clever
But I don't even leave my room in the night time
And I've been talking to this moon for a lifetime
Silly me, I'm the king of soliloquies
And what's a throne without a queen, girl you feelin' me

In your eyes
I have seen
All the feeling and the rain
And death is cold, death is sure
Why don't we all fall in love?
Why don't we fall in love?
Oh, oh, whoa oh oh
Fall in love
Why don't we, fall in love?
Why don't we, fall in love?
Why don't we, fall in love?
