Like a character in a book
I think this is what it's like to be free
I was so helpless
To say what I really meant
I know she can make it out of this one alright
You were so careless
The way you know how to be
I know that we can make it out of this one alright
Is it so lonely?
To be the one with some sense
I hope that you look back on me the same
Oh, you're so, chromatic
The way you are unpredictable
I feel that we've grown static
Lets make the hold, I'm ready to go
Oh, you are so tragic
The way it was so predictable
A miracle in color
We come alive and now I'm ready to go
I was set sailing
Like a character in a book
I think this is what it's like to be free
Let's make our way from place to place
This is what we want in our bones
Never looking back, just growing old
This is our time
Oh, you're so, chromatic
The way you are unpredictable
I feel that we've grown static
Lets make the hold, I'm ready to go
Oh, you are so tragic
The way it was so predictable
A miracle in color
We come alive and now I'm ready to go
Is this the way you want to go?
Back around the way we used to know
Not conforming to the things we hope
Is this what I want to let you know?
Is this the way you want to go?
Back around the way we used to know
Not conforming to the things we hope
Is this what i want to let you know?
Oh, you're so, chromatic
The way you are unpredictable
I feel that we've grown static
Lets make the hold, I'm ready to go
Oh, you are so tragic
The way it was so predictable
A miracle in color
