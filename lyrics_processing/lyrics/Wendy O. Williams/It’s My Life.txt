I got a reputation
People know who I am
Rules are made to be broken
Can't kill what you don't understand
I see you're running scared
I never knew you cared
Go hide your head in the sand
Been to hell and back
I survived and that's a fact

It's my life (It's my life)
And I do what I wanna, do what I wanna, do what I like
It's my life (It's my life)
And I do what I wanna, do what I wanna do

My New Year's resolution
Is always the same
Gonna do what I like, gonna do what I want
And the hell the thing, yeah
I don't need nobody
Won't play that game
You might also likeShouting from the roof
And face up to the truth

It's my life (It's my life)
And I do what I wanna, do what I wanna, do what I like
It's my life (It's my life)
And I do what I wanna, do what I wanna, do what I like
It's my life (It's my life)
And I do what I wanna, do what I wanna, do what I like
It's my life (It's my life)
And I do what I wanna, do what I wanna do
Ooh yeah

Don't need an invitation
Don't play hard to get
So I think they claim I can't be tamed
You know it doesn't matter
I swear when I want, I wear what I like, yeah

(It's my life)
(And I do what I wanna, do what I wanna, do what I like)
It's my life (It's my life) Fuck yeah
(And I do what I wanna, do what I wanna, do what I like)
(It's my life)
(And I do what I wanna, do what I wanna, do what I like)
(It's my life)
(And I do what I wanna, do what I wanna, do what I like)
(It's my life)
(And I do what I wanna, do what I wanna, do what I like)
(It's my life)
