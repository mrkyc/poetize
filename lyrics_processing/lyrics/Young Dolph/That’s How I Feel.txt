(Listen to this track, bitch)
It's Dolph
It's Gucci
It's Dolph
Yeah (Go)

One big house and it's full of bad bitches
I'm just sayin', can a young nigga live? (Let a nigga live)
Two million worth of cars parked in the front yard
But want another Rolls-Royce, that's how I feel (Ayy, ayy)
For a hundred shots, I heard you paid a hundred stacks (What?)
Hope you got your receipt, go and get your hundred back (Hah)
For that new coupe, I paid four hundred flat (Skrrt)
Smash your baby mama, woah, then I sent her back, hey
Sittin' in the truck (Yeah), smokin' on a blunt (Yeah)
Then I realized I think I hear somebody shootin' (Ayy, what's that?)
You think I'm goin' out like Pac and Biggie, you must be stupid (It's Dolph)
Them millions keep callin' my phone and I'm headed straight to it (Brrt, hello?)

Shippin' money by the mail, I just came back with the bales
Now I'm dancin' in the trap, that's how I feel (Woo)
I'm in a coupe cost half a mil', I just redid my Chevelle
Got two Maybachs in both ears, that's how I feel (Bling, burr)
I got two bitches at the 'tel, hope that they don't kiss and tell
I'm way too much for just one bitch, that's how I feel (Woo)
You know that salt can kill a snail, but can't do nothin' to a player (No)
I'm way too trill, I'm hard to kill, that's how I feel (Huh)

Ballin', Gucci twin K's, I just made the front page
Please stay out my lane, man, 'cause I got road rage (Skrrt)
Fresh up out the cage, I'm the jack of all trades
And you suckers can't kill me, I'ma die of old age (Well, damn)
Put your hands on Gucci, then I'm jumpin' off stage
Chopper'll turn a nigga dreads to a hightop fade
Call me Droptop Wop, I'm in a hard top Wraith
'Bout to roll the window down and start throwin' out grenades
Nigga, this is how you feel when you walk up out the jail
And walk up in that bank and tell 'em give you twenty mil' (Yeah)
And this is how she feel when you do her hair and nails
And dick so good, she can't keep it to herself (It's Gucci)

Shippin' money by the mail, I just came back with the bales
