Lately I been feeling like spazzin' out
Memphis niggas known for crashin' out
I heard you going broke, so you assed out, haha, ayy
Tryna keep up with the kid, you gon' be assed out (Yeah)
Yeah, tell me how the fuck you think I got here (Ayy, tell me that)
This rap game ain't shit to me but some cartwheels (This shit sweet)
Ninety percent of these niggas not real (Damn)
Started rapping, found out these rappers' jewelry not real (Damn)

Damn, swear that shit hurt my heart, dawg
Huh, fuck it though

Never had a deal but got more guap than all of y'all (It's Dolph)
Lost a half of mil', that's why I started rapping, dawg (It's Dolph)
Tall skinny nigga, I should've been playing ball (Brrr)
But I had niggas spending a hundred grand every time they called
(Hello?)
It ain't shit to pick up a pistol and go rob a nigga (That's easy)
I let my nuts hang, went out of town and went mobbin', nigga (Mobbin')
Think 'bout my childhood, all I remember is starving, nigga (Gone)
Old niggas in the hood was hating, but I ain't buy them niggas (Fuck 'em)
Made a pledge with my niggas, we brothers forever (Yeah)
Don't give a fuck, you right or wrong, we thuggin' forever (Yeah)
Shit was treacherous in my hood, nigga (Every man for theyself)
Richest nigga in my hood, nigga, huh, yeah, yeah
(Do what I wanna), before this rap shit (Yeah, yeah)
None of that cap shit (Yeah, yeah)
Just might be the realest nigga on the map, bitch (Yeah, yeah)
Had your sister holding pounds, on some trap shit (Ayy, hold that)
'Bout to go pick up some gualla, I'll be back, bitch (It's Dolph)
Flew two thousand miles away by my damn self (It's Dolph)
Niggas talk too much so I don't need no damn help (Fuck 'em)
Dolph ran up them millis, you feel like he owe you, don't you? (Yep)
But tell the truth, you would cross him out for some paper, won't you? (Yep)
Why I show you so much love? You ain't never did shit for me (Hold up)
I take that back, besides run your mouth like a bitch to me (Damn)
I ain't got no rap friends 'cause all they bitches feeling me (Damn)
They know deep down inside I'm what they nigga wanna be (Damn)
Ain't nothing but one of me (Damn)
He really from the streets (Damn)
He really swung them P's (Damn)
He really bought that double-R truck, it's not a lease (Damn)
Mama called me crying, said she proud of me (I love you)
Remember a couple of my own niggas doubted me (Fuck you)
Found my first plug, was like I hit the lottery (Thank you, God)
When I get shot, was the first time I ain't have my Glock with me
