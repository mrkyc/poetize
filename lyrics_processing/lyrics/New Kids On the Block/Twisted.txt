You wanna feel
I'll let you feel
Come over here
Can't help what love
Could do to you

You know that cuts, scars, bruises hurt
So what
You like it, you like all the
Screws, tattoos, cool
That I can do
You're tellin'
You're tellin' me you're

A little bit (Little bit)
Twisted (Oh)
Can't feel your heart
You want me to twist it (For ya)
A little bit (Little bit)
Twisted (Tell me where it hurts)
Where does it hurt?
Tell me where to kiss it (Kiss it)
Kiss it (Kiss it)
Kiss it (Kiss it)
Where does it hurt?
Tell me where to kiss it
