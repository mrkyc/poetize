Hey, hey
Oh-oh, oh

Tonight
Replay it in your mind
Like it was yesterday
We had that secret place
Where we would hide
And count the stars in the sky
And the promises we made were for life

And I know the years go by
But it's nothing we can't rewind

Bring back the time
The heart, it never changes
And inside we're still the same kids
We were back in '89
So bring back the time
You know we still got the magic
There's nothing that can take away this
Feeling that we have tonight

We came in the door
We said it before
Back in the days we was young, we had a ball
Bikinis; small
Heels tall
Hangin' all day at the beach and the mall
Like Rick, we rolled

Plus a pinch of Salt-N-Pepa seasoning
Here we go
Deja vu
Tell you what we gon' do
We gon' bring it back with you, for real

And I know the years go by
But it's nothing we can't rewind

Bring back the time
The heart, it never changes
And inside we're still the same kids
We were back in '89
So bring back the time
You know we still got the magic
There's nothing that can take away this
Feeling that we have tonight
