I confess, I never loved nobody
Like I love you, like I love you
If you should ever take your love away from me, baby
What would I do? What would I do?

'Cause my heart only beats for you, baby

And the drummer goes to the beat of my heart
And the drummer goes to the beat of my heart
And the drummer goes to the beat of my heart
And the drummer goes to the beat of my heart
Can you hear my heart beating for ya?
Can you hear my heart beating for ya?
Can you hear my heart beating for ya?
Can you hear it, baby?

I confess that I'm not always perfect
But I'm perfect for you, perfect for you
Even though we fight and cry, girl, you know it's not worth it
I still love you, still love you, yeah

'Cause my heart only beats for you, baby (only, and the drummer goes)
