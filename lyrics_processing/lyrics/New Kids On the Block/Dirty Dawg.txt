Come on
Oh-woah, oh, oh, oh yeah
Ooh-ooh, oh-oh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh

You should have treated me right
But you left me lonely and cold at night
Since you won't, someone will
Treat me better and be for real

If you didn't want it, you shoulda let me know
But since you didn't want it
Then girl, you got to go
You left me sad and lonely
And ran away from home
So since I'm not your only
Then go and fetch your bone 'cause you's a

I gave you all that I can
'Till I caught you swingin' with another man
But this time, you strayed too far
Now you come beggin' like the dog you are

If you didn't want it, you shoulda let me know
But since you didn't want it
Then girl, you got to go
Don't think that you can play me
And jerk me all around
You used to be my baby
Now your ass is in the pound

(Dawg) you're so damn dirty
Yo, why you wanna act like a tramp?
A wet food stamp?
I think it's time for me to break camp
Had a crush on my man the first time we met
Now what you see is what you get
Lost more than a mil' on a gambling bet
So here's the Chuck Wagon for the dog in you
Here's the Ken-L Ration and the Alpo too

Now you know I didn't want her
She tried to back me on a corner
I told her blow the horn like little Jack Horner
Forever forbidden, the fast girls in life
The fast cars, they call 'em kittens
Now they've been known to amaze
But they can't pull one over me, I got game for days
Save the sap rap for the handicapped
Been around the block and I don't fall for the trimmed trap
