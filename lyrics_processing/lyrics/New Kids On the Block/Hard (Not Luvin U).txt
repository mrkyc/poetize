I been playing cool with you too long
And that's not me
Tryna front like you don't turn me on
Is that what you believe?

Oh baby, I apologize but I won't be satisfied
'Til you're begging me for more and more
Your body's like a paradise and I'm tryna take a flight
You're a masterpiece, I'm just tryna let you know

Baby, you're more than a problem
Gimme one taste so I can make it stop
If you really don't want me to want ya
I don't know what I'm supposed to do
It's so hard not loving you

Watching every motion, I can't speak
You got me weak
Tryna be polite but underneath
I'm feeling like a freak, freak

Oh baby, I apologize but I won't be satisfied
'Til you're begging me for more and more
Your body's like a paradise and I'm tryna take a flight
You're a masterpiece, I'm just tryna let you know

If you really don't want me to want ya
I don't know what I'm supposed to do
It's so hard not loving you
That's what she said
That's what he said too

'Cause you know I want to more than anything (you know I want to)
How can I have you? (I got to have you)
Heaven is waiting, they won't let me in (I'll take you to Heaven)
Until I finally have you

Baby, you're more than a problem
Gimme one taste so I can make it stop
If you really don't want me to want ya
I don't know what I'm supposed to do
It's so hard, it's so hard, not loving you
Oh, woah, it's so hard, not loving you
It's so hard, not loving you
I don't know what I'm supposed to do
