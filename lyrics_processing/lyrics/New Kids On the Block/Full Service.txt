Come on

I see you pulling on up in your car and there's something on your mind
Like you've been driving around the whole night, now you're pulling up next to mine
I'll lift the hood and look up under, from the front and to the bumper
Roll the window up and lock the door 'cause I'm gonna bring rain and thunder

I'll fill you up, up (If you wanna get some)
I'll pump you up, up ('Cause I got the premium)
I'll fill you up, up, pump you up, up
'Til the tip-top, drip drop, don't stop, don't stop

You ain't gotta do it yourself, baby
I'ma give you that full service, you'll see
You ain't gotta, gotta be nervous, nervous
I'ma give you, give you full service, service
You ain't even gotta get out your seat
I'ma give you that full service, you'll see
You ain't gotta, gotta be nervous, nervous
I'ma give you, give you full service, service

Like you've been hanging around the whole night, just sittin' there sippin' on your wine

I'll wipe it up if your drink splashes
Send the check my way tonight, you don't pay 'cause I wanna protect your assets

I'll fill you up, up (If you wanna get some)
