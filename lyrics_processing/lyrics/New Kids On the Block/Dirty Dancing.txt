Wasn't in the mood for dancin', forget about romancin'
'Cause I already got a lady
Wasn't tryin' to be flirty, wasn't feelin' dirty
'Til this shorty started grindin' on me
With her itty-bitty waist and her pretty pretty face
And the leanest, meanest, baddest, baddest body
Didn't have no time to waste, she was lookin' for a taste
Yeah, and she was wantin' me to party

Ooh, it's so crazy, she's like Baby, I'm like Swayze
I said, ooh, and I'm burnin' up
So, let's turn it up, I said turn it up now

She's dirty dirty dancing, dirty dancing on me
She's dirty dirty dancing, dirty dancing on me
She's dirty dirty dancing, dirty dancing, dirty dancing on me
She's dirty dirty dancing, dirty dancing on me

Now, I ain't lookin' for no drama
I don't want karma 'cause my baby sittin' in bed at home
She know that I be lyin' and see that I be tryin'
To be tryin' to get this shorty with me all alone
With her pretty lips and her big 'ol hips
It's gettin' hotter when she touches me with her fingertips
And her sexy eyes & those big 'ol thighs
It's gettin' hotter like The Block up in the summertime

And she's been blowin' me up on my phone
