Still sounds good to me
Like we were 17
So play that song for me, come on Eileen
Still sounds good to me
Ha

1989, a number, what a summer
Sound of a brother from another mother
Music hits your heart 'cause you new to that soul
Why am I surprised you've my number? Lost together
And all summer long 'til forever
Music hits you hardand you couldn't let go, oh no
And you said

Oh oh oh
I wanna hear it, I wanna feel it
Oh oh oh
Still sounds good to me

Still sounds good to me
Like we were 17
So play that song for me, come on Eileen
Still sounds good to me

1989, a number, what a summer
Told you there would never be another
Knew it in your heart, knew it in your soul
I look in your eyes and remember us together
Told you I'd be here forever
Music hits you hard and you couldn't let go, oh
And you said

Oh oh oh
I wanna hear it, I wanna feel it
Oh oh oh
Still sounds good to me

Still sounds good to me
Like we were 17
So play that song for me, you know the one I mean
Still sounds good to me

Goin' back like Jones beach in '89
To the summer, summer, summer
To the careless whispers in the purple rain
To makin' modern love in a Jefferson airplane
To the greatest of all time
To the Magic and Bird era
It's like we pressed rewind
To hangin' tougher than leather
We fried it up like lin 'cause the heat it on
We got wider like jean 'til the PM on
Stayed on point like fight, like the facts of life
You know the reasons, Maurice White
Princess, we miss you, may the force be with you
Life left to change is Bowie
Rearrange us, Joey
Jordan, Danny and John
Sing the hook, I'm gone
Got a date, can't be late
I can't wait
Still sounds good to me
Like we were 17
So play that song for me, come on Eileen
