Do you believe in second chances?
So I will be foolish if I did
Believe it I did!
So you got the nerves to come and ask me
After all that's been done you're gone and you're stop
Dry off those tears, get out of my face
Leave out the puzzles, I know you're faking
But it's too late
Cause, oh, oh, oh!
Guess that when we leaving all be back in a form, baby!

Because I'm one foot out of the door
Two strikes and I'm gone
Let's hope it I'm done!
You got me one foot out the door
Can't take it no more
One foot out the door!
I'm standing right foot next to your door, baby, oh yeah!
Cannot be scribing of my love!
I won't be stupid anymore!
You've been treating me good understand, get it right
Cause I'm one foot out the door!

You thought you had me, really sleeping
I was naive I think you were cheating
When you get surprised how will annoy ya
The look in your eyes, it reveals your disguise
Would you be surprised how well I know you
Look at who's walking out of your face!
Was nice to know ya
Quit the talking, get out of my way
Cause oh, oh, oh, oh
Lies and deceiving
Here's your keys, cause I'm off baby!

You never felt I'm gonna turn your back, turn inside
And you see... breathing, I wanna go!
Move your hands, let me go!
