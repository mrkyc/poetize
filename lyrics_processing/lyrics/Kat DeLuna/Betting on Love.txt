We should keep it simple, just a little fling
But you make me giggle and that's usually when it all goes down
See I'm in the middle of a million things
I just need a little time for me, time to breathe

Cause I've been waiting and contemplating, should I go all in?
I only needed one good reason
I was single, ready to move in,  what the hell happened?
You came around, you came around

I'm betting on love, put it all on you
I gamble all I have to take
I'm hoping my love for once goes too
I'm bet, I can make
I'm betting on love, put it all on you
I'm giving you all of me
I'm taking a chance, I can't afford no lose
I choose to believe

So, it's on the table, this is how I feel
I'm really unable, so you can decide if we seal the deal
And not too aggressive, it's against all odds
Just give me the messages, if I'm out of mind or out of time

Cause I've been waiting and contemplating, should I go all in?
I only needed one good reason
I was single, ready to move in,  what the hell happened?
You came around, you came around

I'm betting on love, put it all on you
I gamble all I have to take
I'm hoping my love for once goes too
I'm bet, I can make
I'm betting on love, put it all on you
I'm giving you all of me
I'm taking a chance, I can't afford no lose
I choose to believe

You got me giggling and tingling up all night
It's crazy knowing you can read my mind
So are you thinking maybe we can really do this right?
Will you hold me down for life?

I'm betting on love, put it all on you
I gamble all I have to take
I'm hoping my love for once goes too
I'm bet, I can make
I'm betting on love, put it all on you
I'm giving you all of me
I'm taking a chance, I can't afford no lose
I choose to believe
I'm betting on love, put it all on you
I gamble all I have to take
I'm hoping my love for once goes too
I'm bet, I can make
I'm betting on love, put it all on you
I'm giving you all of me
I'm taking a chance, I can't afford no lose
