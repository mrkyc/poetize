I'm the textbook definition of a rebel
I see the crumble in left, and I've gotta go right
I'm always in some trouble
To me, life ain't fun unless you're in a good fight

So the more you're good to me
The more I try to get you to leave

All my life, I've made excuses
Pushing you away
Saying that you're not for me
All my life, I ran from you, babe
I tried everything
In the end, it was you
In the end, in the end, it was you

All I wanna do is have a good time
Let the beat go through me and just take me away
You've been trying to get with me for a while
And I've been telling you to save that for another day

So the more you're good to me
The more I try to get you to leave
You might also like
All my life, I've made excuses
Pushing you away
Saying that you're not for me
All my life, I ran from you, babe
I tried everything
In the end, it was you
In the end, in the end, it was you

No, no, no, I never would've thought
You'd be the one that I'd be with in the end
Lately, I never would've dreamed
That you and me would be together in the end
No, no, no, I never would've thought
You'd be the one that I'd be with in the end
Lately, I never would've dreamed
That you and me would be together in the end

All my life, I've made excuses
Pushing you away
Saying that you're not for me
All my life, I ran from you, babe
I tried everything
In the end, it was you
In the end, in the end, it was you
All my life, I've made excuses
Pushing you away
Saying that you're not for me
All my life, I ran from you, babe
I tried everything
In the end, it was you
