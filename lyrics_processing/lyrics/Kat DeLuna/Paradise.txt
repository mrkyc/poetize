Baby, if you take my hand
I promise we can get away
Forget about all your plans
We can live forever in one day, day, day, day
I relive this moment forever if it's with you, you, you, you
You're stranded in my heart, I'm here to rescue you

Baby we can get away
Stranded in my heart, I'm here to rescue you
Live forever and one day
So we can escape to paradise just me and you
In my heart we can stay
You're the only thing I need in this world to survive
'Til the sun fades away
Baby I see paradise when I look into your eyes
I'm a victim to your love
I surrender to this feeling
I got that to your heart
I will not fight this feeling
Cause every single night and day
My heart takes me away
With you to paradise
Where dreams come true
You might also like
Please don't wake me up
Cause I'm dreaming of you
And every time that I wake up
I close my eyes to picture you
We're so alone, so alone, so alone
I waited for the moment to be lost in your arms
You're the man to my heart
You know just where to start to find my love
Cause the feeling of the moment
It's making it magical, oh
And the thought of us together feels so incredible
I cannot and will not find the feelings here for you
I don't mind getting lost in paradise with you

Baby we can get away
Stranded in my heart, I'm here to rescue you
Live forever and one day
So we can escape to paradise just me and you
In my heart we can stay
You're the only thing I need in this world to survive
'Til the sun fades away
Baby I see paradise when I look into your eyes
I'm a victim to your love
I surrender to this feeling
I got that to your heart
I will not fight this feeling
Cause every single night and day
My heart takes me away
With you to paradise
