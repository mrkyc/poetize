It's summertime
Ladies lookin' hot (RedOne)
Shakin' up what they've got (GMB)
Elephant Man and Kat, c'mon!
(Kat)

Senses tellin' me you're lookin'
I can feel it on my skin (Woo)
Boy, I wonder what would happen if I trip and let you in
Don't be shook by my aggression, I just might be the one
Let's skip this conversation
Just whine your body up (Up)

Ha, ha, ha, don't wanna wait no more
Ha, ha, ha, you got what I'm searching for
I'm feeling your vibing, I'm riding high, it's exotic
And I want you
I want you here
Pull me closer and closer and hold me tight to your body
I wanna feel you
I wanna feel you near (Woo)

Whine up (Oh), whine up (Oh), whine up, oye!
Whine up (Oh), whine up (Oh), whine up, oye!
Whine up (Oh), whine up (Oh), whine up, oye!
Whine up (Oh), whine up (Oh), whine up, oye!

A ese nene lo tengo trikia'o
Cuando lo bailo, lo bailo de la'o (Oye)
Y lo empujo, lo tengo tumba'o
Con mis caderas lo tengo amansa'o, wind

Get me hot (Hot)
Winding up your body, you don't have to stop
My temperature is rising, want you more than before
It's an animal attraction, whine your body up (Up)

Ha, ha, ha, it's the magic on the floor
Ha, ha, ha, I don't wanna wait no more
'Cause I'm feeling your vibing, I'm riding high it's exotic
And I want you (And I want you too)
