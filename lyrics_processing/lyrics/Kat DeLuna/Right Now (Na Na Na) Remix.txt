Kat DeLuna and Akon!
Uh
Yeah
Na na, na na

Sleepless night
Boy, all that I could think about was us
And the way that only you know how to touch me
I try to move on (Move on)
But I know I'm just fooling myself
Don't wanna be kissed, touched, loved
Or give my heart to someone else

I wanna make up, na, na, na, na
But before we make up, na, na, na, na
Promise me you'll never do it again
Tell me that we'll make it through to the end
I wanna make up, na-na-na, na, na
But before we make up, na-na-na, na, na
Promise me you'll never do it again
Tell me that we'll make it through to the end

Girl, I know (Know)
Mistakes were made between us two
And we showed (Showed)
Our ass that night, even said some things weren't true (Mmh)
Watched you go (Go) (Watch me go)
And haven't seen my girl since then
Why can't it be the way it was?
'Cause you were my homie, lover and friend
You might also like
I wanna make up, na, na, na, na
But before we make up, na, na, na, na
Promise me you'll never do it again
Tell me that we'll make it through to the end
I wanna make up, na-na-na, na, na
But before we make up, na-na-na, na, na
Promise me you'll never do it again
Tell me that we'll make it through to the end (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

Don't lie (Don't lie)
Promise every day you're gonna try (You're gonna try)
To make me feel like everything's alright (Make me feel alright)
Like I'm the apple of your eye (Of your eye)

I wanna make up, na, na, na, na
But before we make up, na, na, na, na
Promise me you'll never do it again (Oh)
Tell me that we'll make it through to the end
I wanna make up, na-na-na, na, na (I wanna make up, na, na, na, na)
But before we make up, na-na-na, na, na (Ooh, no)
Promise me you'll never do it again
Tell me that we'll make it through to the end
I wish I could fly with you (Oh)
I wish I could lie with you (Lie with you)
I just wanna die with you (Die with you, no)
Get out my grind with you (Ooh, oh)
Ooh, yeah
Kat DeLuna, Akon
Ooh, yeah
