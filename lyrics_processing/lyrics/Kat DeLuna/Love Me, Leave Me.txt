The very first day of my life
Was the day that you let me go
It was a blessing in disguise
Now I see that I'm beautiful
'Cause all we ever did was fight
We were so dysfunctional
Now I've forgotten all the times
And all the days I was lovin' you

Just like a ghost from my past
(You come back to haunt me now)
Saying that you want me back
(But that's impossible, so...)

If you love me, leave me
'Cause I've already closed that door
Don't want to be
In the pain I felt before
If I only could be myself
Without your approval anymore
If you love me, leave me
If you love me, leave me alone
You might also like
Now there used to be a time
I would've taken you back again
But now I got you out my mind
And I'm totally independent
So you can save your little lies
'Cause I know what's happenin'
You're missin' me, but say goodbye now
To all the days I was lovin' you

Just like a ghost from my past
(You come back to haunt me now)
Saying that you want me back
(But that's impossible, so...)

If you love me, leave me
'Cause I've already closed that door
Don't want to be
In the pain I felt before
If I only could be myself
Without your approval anymore
If you love me, leave me
If you love me, leave me alone
If you really wanna help, then you should go
'Cause I promised myself I'd make it alone
At the back of the shelf
'Cause there, I put what we had
I'm never going back now!

If you love me, leave me
'Cause I've already closed that door
Don't want to be
In the pain I felt before
If I only could be myself
Without your approval anymore
If you love me, leave me
If you love me, leave me alone
Love me, leave me
'Cause I've already closed that door
Don't want to be
In the pain I felt before
If I only could be myself
Without your approval anymore
If you love me, leave me
