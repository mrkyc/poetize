When I close my eyes
I feel my heart's always calling for you
Dreams are filled with love
And I feel my heart's always calling for you

Sunny days are not what they used to be
Every minute you're not around
Every memory's filled with thoughts of you and I
On evenings I'm dreaming that you never left my side

So come on over, I want you all alone
I'm gonna prove to you how much I really do miss you
And there's nothing you can say that's gon' push me away
Cause baby, I feel

When I close my eyes
I feel my heart's always calling for you
Dreams are filled with love
And I feel my heart's always calling for you

In my eyes, a vision of you arise
And it brings me down to my knees
I can't express the feelings, too hard to hide
I'm picturing us all alone and in privacy
You might also like
So come on over, I want you all alone
I'm gonna prove to you how much I really do miss you
And there's nothing you can say that's gon' push me away
Cause baby, I feel

When I close my eyes
I feel my heart's always calling for you
Dreams are filled with love
And I feel my heart's always calling for you

Only you satisfy my desire
Only you lights the spark to my fire
Only you brings a smile to my face
On sunny days and rainy days, all the same
And I could fly away anywhere in this world
But it's you I want to fly away with
Come away with me cause you're all I need
You make me believe cause I will when

When I close my eyes
I feel my heart's always calling for you
Dreams are filled with love
And I feel my heart's always calling for you
When I close my eyes
I feel my heart's always calling for you
Dreams are filled with love
