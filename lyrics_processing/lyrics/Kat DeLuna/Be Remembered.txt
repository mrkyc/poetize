Ay
Oh, oh, ooh
Be remembered
Be remembered
Be remembered

Gotta show the world what you got
Pick a place, go 'head, pick a spot
Waiting for your time to shine
(Make it happen now)
It's a long way yet to the top
Never see the time if you stop
Close your eyes, and roll the dice
(For the finer things in life)

Don't you wait until it's too late
Don't wanna face that heartbreak
No, no one should have to feel that pain
If you're really looking for a new day
Feel the rhythm of your body
Let the music play-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay

Act like you want it
Live for the moment
Don't miss your chance to
Be yourself and be remembered
Enjoy the music
Get up and do it
Tonight's the night to
Be yourself and be remembered
You might also like
Be remembered
Be remembered
Be remembered

See the stars are all in a line
In your favor, I can see the light
See the fire in your eye
(Don't you blink, it just might die)
Motivate yourself, come with it
Be yourself and live for the minute
Hope you find a paradise
(It's your destiny tonight)

Don't you wait until it's too late
Don't wanna face that heartbreak
No, no one should have to feel that pain
If you're really looking for a new day
Feel the rhythm of your body
Let the music play-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay

Act like you want it
Live for the moment
Don't miss your chance to
Be yourself and be remembered
Enjoy the music
Get up and do it
Tonight's the night to
Be yourself and be remembered
This is your time, my time
Right to the end, we gonna shine
Gonna bless us for all time
And you're gonna shine yourself forever
It's just good to know
That we are movin' on
There's the stress and struggle
But we are standin' strong
Stand up and be remembered
Get up and be remembered

Act like you want it
Live for the moment
Don't miss your chance to
Be yourself and be remembered
Enjoy the music
Get up and do it
Tonight's the night to
Be yourself and be remembered
Act like you want it
Live for the moment
Don't miss your chance to
Be yourself and be remembered
Enjoy the music
Get up and do it
Tonight's the night to
Be yourself and be remembered
Be remembered
Be remembered
Be remembered
Be yourself and be remembered
Be remembered
Be remembered
