I'm feeling like I got the world in the palm of my hands
It's like I'm with you and nobody else is here, yeah
Me and you, when here together, a perfect effect
Just come a little closer, co-o-o-ome, yeah, yeah

Hold on to me and feel the music
Free yourself tonight

Oh, just do what you want, what you want
Like nobody's watching
Do what you want, what you want
Keep your body rockin'
What, what, what, give it up
Like nobody's watching you
Oh, no-oh, the rhythm's calling you
Lose control, the rhythm's calling you

I can't seem to get this curiosity out my head
'Cause when I'm next to you, you make me wanna take you there
Whatever you need, you can find in me, you can feel it, boy touch me there
Chemistry is flowing, keep it goin', don't sto-o-op it there
You might also like
Hold on to me and feel the music
Free yourself tonight

Oh, just do what you want, what you want
Like nobody's watching
Do what you want, what you want
Keep your body rockin'
What, what, what, give it up
Like nobody's watching you
Oh, no-oh, the rhythm's calling you
Lose control, the rhythm's calling you

Calling you, calling you, calling you
(Eh, eh, eh, eh-eh) The rhythm's calling you
(Eh, eh, eh, eh-eh) The rhythm's calling you
(Eh, eh, eh, eh-eh) The rhythm's calling you
(Eh, eh, eh, eh-eh)

Oh, just do what you want, what you want
Like nobody's watching
Do what you want, what you want
Keep your body rockin'
What, what, what, give it up
Like nobody's watching you
Oh, no-oh, the rhythm's calling you
Lose control
Oh, just do what you want, what you want
Like nobody's watching
Do what you want, what you want
Keep your body rockin'
What, what, what, give it up
Like nobody's watching you
Oh, no-oh, the rhythm's calling you
Lose control, the rhythm's calling you

Oh, just do what you want, what you want
Like nobody's watching
Do what you want, what you want
Keep your body rockin'
What, what, what, give it up
Like nobody's watching you
Oh, no-oh, the rhythm's calling you
