Oh

If you wanna love me, you gotta do it right
'Cause every Queen need a King who wants her body, all day, all night

We could do it in the shower
We could do it on the floor
You could get it every hour
Boy, there's so much more

Bum bum, from where this came from
If you love this bum bum (Yeah, yeah)
It's the only one you want
What a bum bum
How could I replace that bum bum?
I just wanna see you shake that bum bum
Give it to me, I'ma take that bum bum
What a bum bum

Shawty came in and she caught me red handed staring at her butt
So I say "What's up?"
If I get it, I ain't losing it
'Cause I know what to do with it
Make you say oh-oh
This is the love you've been waiting for
We've come too far so when I get close
Ain't nobody touching your body but me

Give it to me, I'ma take that bum bum
What a bum bum

I know you love it when I shake it, shake
You know I love it when you shake it for me
Go hard but don't break it, break
Don't worry, I ain't taking no breaks
Baby, let me see it shake
Let me see it shake
Let, let me see it shake
