You can talk all you want, but my skin is really thick
I'm the leader of the crowd and my game is really slick
I'm unstoppable, unstoppable, unstoppable, unstoppable
You can talk all you want, but my skin is really thick
I'm the leader of the crowd and my game is really slick
I'm unstoppable, unstoppable, unstoppable, unstoppable
Save your pity for tomorrow when I smash it like a ball
In the club, on the news, I'll be rockin' like a rockstar
I'm unstoppable, unstoppable, unstoppable, unstoppable

Weezy F, baby
Hello girl, I got a black president and a yellow girl
And my red shoes, man, my swags so sick, I need med school
I never make a bad move, but I can make her bed move
And like my attitude, ain't nobody else on my magnitude
Yeah, ain't nothing stopping me
I feel like ain't nothing out for me
Huh, what you talking about Kat?
I ran in a bank and I walked out fat
Yeah, and I walk it like I talk it, but I run this shit
Yeah, run it like a faucet
I'm on the A list 'cause I'm boss, Young Money

You can talk all you want, but my skin is really thick
I'm the leader of the crowd and my game is really slick
I'm unstoppable, unstoppable, unstoppable, unstoppable
Save your pity for tomorrow when I smash it like a ball
In the club, on the news, I'll be rockin' like a rockstar
I'm unstoppable, unstoppable, unstoppable, unstoppable

Now shake your body like you got the jungle fever
Rushing through your veins
We gettin' crazy and the club is banging through your brain
When I say jump, you jump, jump is knockin', knockin'
I wanna see you jump like this beat is rockin'
Love bite on my bracelet kinda fancy, but it's hot
You wanna come along and see then holler at me
Maybe I lost it, maybe not 'cause I got game
Like a burning flame, yeah, that's me, ah-ah

You can talk all you want, but my skin is really thick
I'm the leader of the crowd and my game is really slick
I'm unstoppable, unstoppable, unstoppable, unstoppable
Save your pity for tomorrow when I smash it like a ball
In the club, on the news, I'll be rockin' like a rockstar
I'm unstoppable, unstoppable, unstoppable, unstoppable

Fa-fa-fa-fa, follow the leader
Fa-fa-fa-fa, follow the leader
