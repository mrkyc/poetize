Don't know how we got this far
So attached now, and this gets me
Like a thief, you stole my heart
And I've fallen in love so unfairly

Boy, I hate that my world revolves around you
And I hate my heart, 'cause it hurts without you

Why? Why am I so lost in you?
And I don't even know me anymore
Why? I don't know why, I'm so confused
'Cause I'm hating that I love you this much, boy

Confused
I'm confused
I'm confused

You gave me goosebumps every time
My heart skips a beat when you touch me
I'm so mesmerized
Who told you you could be mine?
I'm mad at you for this nice surprise

Why? Why am I so lost in you?
And I don't even know me anymore
Why? I don't know why, I'm so confused
'Cause I'm hating that I love you this much, boy

You see I love you, then I hate you
And I hate to 'cause I love you
And I need you, then I don't need you
I don't know just what to do
I think I hate you, yes, I hate you
Wait, I love you, I love you
I'm really so confused
I love you, yes, I do

Why? Why am I so lost in you?
And I don't even know me anymore
Why? I don't know why, I'm so confused
