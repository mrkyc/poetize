Time to wake up the world
RedOne!
It's party o'clock!
Hello world, hello world (Kat DeLuna, one more time!)
Wake up, wake up, it's party o'clock (Ah, get it!)

Da-da-da-da, di-da, di-da-di-da, di-da-di-da (Ha!)
Oh-oh-oh-oh

I don't even check the time
I just look up to the sky
When the sun goes up
Then the party's goin' down
Ain't nobody goin' home
'Bout to take off on the floor
We gon' lose it to the music
'Till they kick us out the door

Then we party in Miami, party in Ibiza
Party in New York, all the way to Africa
Love in the Caribbean, on my way to Vegas
Here we go, Saint-Tropez and Tokyo

Then we be right back to the heat
