I wanna see you dance like no one's there
You're all alone and you don't care cause
This is your night
Let 'em all stare
You're so amazing, ma-mazing, mazing

Baby tonight, turn the music loud
Cause we'll be dancing, dancing, dancing
Set this floor on fire, throw your hand's higher
Everyone's dancing, dancing, dancing
Baby tonight, turn the music loud
Cause we'll be dancing, dancing, dancing
Set this floor on fire, throw your hand's higher
Everyone's dancing, dancing, dancing
We'll be dancing tonight

Oooh I like the sound
I like how the music turns me out
Heart beating to the sound of the base drum
Feet tapping to the snare on occasion
Hold me now baby
Tell me we're all done with waiting
Don't care about conversation
Let me see your hands up
Feel your heartbeat racing
You might also like
Baby tonight, turn the music loud
Cause we'll be dancing, dancing, dancing
Set this floor on fire, throw your hand's higher
Everyone's dancing, dancing, dancing
We'll be dancing tonight

Music's in my system
I'm feeling good and baby I've got a mission
I'm tryin' to turn the club out
Make the party mode on
Find a little cutie, cu-cutie w-when the club's out

Baby tonight, turn the music loud
Cause we'll be dancing, dancing, dancing
Set this floor on fire, throw your hand's higher
Everyone's dancing, dancing, dancing
We'll be dancing tonight

Fo Onassis, yeah!
She my new addiction
Woman in my dream
So I call'er inception
Her moves...perfection!
Did in wi-fi I can make a connection
The way she's working on the dance floor got me losing control
As a dream we go dance tonight
We dance with the stars from night to night
How shiny the moon, hands hit the clouds
Blue Label in the system
Got me dipsy now
I'm half alcoholical
When waist down
We are rocking this party til they kick me out
She's got me going on night
Champagne on the flash lights
We laughing, romance, good times cause...
Baby tonight, turn the music loud
Cause we'll be dancing, dancing, dancing
Set this floor on fire, throw your hand's higher
Everyone's dancing, dancing, dancing
Baby tonight, turn the music loud
Cause we'll be dancing, dancing, dancing
Set this floor on fire, throw your hand's higher
Everyone's dancing, dancing, dancing
