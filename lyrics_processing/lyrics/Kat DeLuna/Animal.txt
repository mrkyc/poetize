Kat! Tribal!

I'm a warrior princess out of control
Eyes of an eagle, fly overhead, I see you comin'
Like a lioness, ride out to hunt for my prize
It's my ego that won't let me bow down

Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, life is like a jungle
Are you brave enough to walk in it?
Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, go around in circles
'Til you build your prowl

Are you wild and dirty like an animal?
Can you growl and scream like an animal?
Baby, go, go, go like an animal
Tear it up, make a mess like an animal

Animal, animal, animal, animal
Deep inside you, is there an animal?
Let it out, animal, be a beast of power
You might also like
Let me outta my cage, can't you see I'm untamed?
I'm like a wildcat, I smell your fear, I see you runnin'
Taste the heaviest poison, one kiss from my lips
I'm pretty evil, savage beauty inside

Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, life is like a jungle
Are you brave enough to walk in it?
Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, go around in circles
'Til you build your prowl

Are you wild and dirty like an animal?
Can you growl and scream like an animal?
Baby, go, go, go like an animal
Tear it up, make a mess like an animal

Animal, animal, animal, animal
Deep inside you, is there an animal?
Let it out, animal, be a beast of power

Aye, aye, ayo (Aye, aye, ayo)
Aye, aye, ayo (Aye, aye, ayo)
Aye, aye, ayo (Aye, aye, ayo)
Aye, aye, ayo (Aye, aye, ayo)
Hey!
Are you wild and dirty like an animal?
Can you growl and scream like an animal?
Baby, go, go, go like an animal
Tear it up, make a mess like an animal
Are you wild and dirty like an animal?
Can you growl and scream like an animal?
Baby, go, go, go like an animal
Tear it up, make a mess like an animal
