Verse 1
The sun's gone down
But no need to whisper
He's too many thousand miles away to hear us
In this old town, we got a couple hours
The moon rides right where I want her
She's got enough of his light to find
That she's such a sight
You're beautiful day and night
I wanna give you everything
Chorus
Oh my god
It's as good as it seems
All these dancing nights
With you on my feet
And this feels just right
Holding you close 'cause
I like you
And if the song's too slow
Take two steps at a time to make up
For the heartbeat left behind
'Cause what's in my mind and all that I know is
I like you
Yeah, I do

You look so good without even tryin
Hair up, no makeup and your eyes are like diamonds
In the moonlit sky
You're something to memorize
And out of all the nights this one might be my favorite
Until tomorrow's sun turns to slumber
And our song kicks in
And my new favorite night begins
I'm gonna give you everything
Chorus
Oh my god
It's as good as it seems
All these dancing nights
With you on my feet
And this feels just right
Holding you close 'cause
I like you
And if the song's too slow
Take two steps at a time to make up
For the heartbeat left behind
'Cause what's in my mind and all that I know is
I like you

Chorus
Oh my god
It's as good as it seems
All these dancing nights
With you on my feet
And this feels just right
Holding you close 'cause
I like you
I like you, I really really
And if the song's too slow
Take two steps at a time to make up
For the heartbeat left behind
