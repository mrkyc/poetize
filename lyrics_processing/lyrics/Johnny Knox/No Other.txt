I never saw it coming
The way your eyes we're shining in the sun
Or by candlelight that one night in that restaurant
I don't wanna blink
So I don't miss a thing you say or do
Or do
I don't need another reason to call you mine

Darling, there's nothing stopping me calling
You my girl, nothing keeping
Me from you and you from me
We can keep being kids on the playground
We're twenty-somethings in the schoolyard
Bells are ringing closer to my heart
I got no worries, no cares to be hurried
'Cause there is no other

No other one for me
No other one for me
No other one

It caught me by surprise, yeah
To see you seven days a week and still want more
Babe, you're a treat and time spent with you
Is food for my soul, I got nothing to lose
Only a world to gain with you
With you
I don't need a bunch of reasons to call you mine
You might also like
Darling, there's nothing stopping me calling
You my girl, nothing keeping
Me from you and you from me
We can keep being kids on the playground
We're twenty-somethings in the schoolyard
Bells are ringing closer to my heart
I got no worries, no cares to be hurried
'Cause there is no other

No other one for me
No other one for me
No other one

Here we go now
So will you be mine
All the time?
When you need a hand to hold I'll give you mine
When we're side by side
This feeling is just right

Darling, there's nothing stopping me calling
You my girl, nothing keeping
Me from you and you from me
We can keep being kids on the playground
We're twenty-somethings in the schoolyard
Bells are ringing closer to my heart
I got no worries, no cares to be hurried
'Cause there is no
No other one for me (No, no)
No other one for me (No, no)
I got no worries, no cares to be hurried
