I've been in so many places, much have I seen
All over the mountains, over the seas
I travelled to the islands of Greece
There you hear the music down the bay
Where they all sing along on the words of a song
Melodies of love in every way
Music is making my day
Oh, me, oh, my, my heart goes ding, dong, dingering
Athens by night, your lights are glimmering
Oh, me, oh, my, your long, long story
Never, will ever end
Oh, me, oh, my (Oh me), my heart (Oh, my) goes ding, dong, dingering
Athens by night, your lights are glimmering
Oh, me (Oh, me), oh, my (Oh, my), your long long story
Never will ever end
From California, down to Japan
All kind of faces, all kind of men
But when I'm from home, I tell you my dear
Islands of Greece, I wished you were
There you hear the music down the bay
Where they all sing along on the words of a song
Melodies of love in every way
Music is making my day
