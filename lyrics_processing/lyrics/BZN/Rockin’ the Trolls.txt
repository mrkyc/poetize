He'd like to tell you stories in a most peculiar way
With lowered voice and rolling eyes, the smell of booze and beer
'Beware my kids' he said, 'because the trolls will soon be here'
'With crystal balls and magic bells, they're rulers of the night
So draw your swords and raise it high, 'cause now the time is right'
And then he'd say: 'Think of me nice' and to me surprise
The Scottish sailor, he moved into the night
And while we all were waiting, cheeria cheera
The sailor was taken, 'till the day was breaking
He's rockin' the trolls tonight
And while we all were waiting, cheeria cheera
The sailor was taken, 'till the day was breaking
He's rockin' the trolls tonight
'They seemed to come from everywhere, in search of everyone
You're going to be the prisoner and you're not the only one'
'I've seen it with my very eyes', the sailor said before
'Maybe a hundred thousand trolls or maybe even more'
With crystal balls and magic bells, they're rulers of the night
So draw your swords and raise it high, 'cause now the time is right
And then he'd say: 'Think of me nice' and to me surprise
The Scottish sailor, he moved into the night
