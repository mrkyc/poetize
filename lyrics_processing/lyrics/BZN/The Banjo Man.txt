A star, a hero from Ohio to Japan
I dreamed of golden rooms, champagne and caviar
My own Rolls Royce, oh, it's wonderful being a star
But now I tramp the roads throughout the land
A needly hobo with a banjo in my hand
In honky-tonks and bars I play this melody
Oh, it's so easy, so come on, sing this after me
Wee, oh, wee, oh, when (Wee, oh, wee, oh, when), my name is Dan
I'm the banjo man
I'm the banjo man
Playing when I can
Deedeedeedee, dum (Deedeedeedee, dum), you hear the drum
Of the banjo man
Oh, the banjo man is back in town again
Yeah!
I need to play my banjo to survive
To earn a living every day, to stay alive
In honky-tonks and bars I play this melody
Oh, it's so easy, so come on, sing this after me
