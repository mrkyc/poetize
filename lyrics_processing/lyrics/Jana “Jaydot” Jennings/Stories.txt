You got me telling stories, you got me writing songs
You got me telling sorries, you got me righting wrongs
You got me telling stories, you got me writing songs
Finding my self in places, places where I don't belong

You got me a lot of shit but, most of all you got me fucked up
Tired of seeing all these things, think its time I chucked the deuce up
Braids in my hair I'm Medusa, look into my eyes and I'll ruin you
You ain't got the views like that, you ain't got the visionary, psychic things
I've done some crazy shit I know, I've seen a lot of things
I might have left your ass back home but that don't mean I don't miss that shit
I like the way you walk around, I like the way you think
I love it when you call me out whenever I start my shit
I know we don't see eye-to-eye, that's cause you see right through me
I should've let you walk on by, you had the drop on me
You said your money or your life, told you I had nothing
You might've thought you found a wife
I ain't trying to get no rings

You got me telling stories, you got me writing songs
You got me telling sorries, you got me righting wrongs
You got me telling stories, you got me writing songs
Finding my self in places

Lord knows I walked a lot of miles, I tasted all them tears
So in the dark i drew some lines, I saw my worst-est fears
Too hard to fall in love again, too soft to treat you wrong
I told you not to come my way, hate how you're so head strong

You got me telling stories, you got me writing songs
You got me telling sorries, you got me righting wrongs
You got me telling stories, you got me writing songs
Finding my self in places

When the light goes out, whatchya gonna do when the lights go out?
When it's just you and me, whatchya gonna do when it's just us babe?
When the lights go out, whatchya gonna do when the lights go out?
When it's just you and me, sitting face-to-face are you gonna fucking speak?

You got me telling stories, you got me writing songs
You got me telling sorries, you got me righting wrongs
You got me telling stories, you got me writing songs
Finding my self in places, places where I don't belong

Places places, people find your places people yeah
Find your faces, find your faces, put on your faces yeah
Places, places people, you got me writing songs
Writing songs
I know I've done some shit to you, I like to hear your scream
