Throw your hands up, Are you ready?
{Chorus}
Throw your hands up and make some noise
Everybody get live and jump for joy
When I say reach, you touch the sky
From the front to the back, from side to side
Are you ready to get that feeling?
Do you know when the time has come?
There's a second of realizing
That we're doing it all as one
Everybody come on and get up
All together we move in time
This is how you know where you're at
See you doing it with Jump5
Can you hear it getting louder?
The sound of noise inreasing
A little piece of heaven now
This is the sound, gonna raise the ceiling
Can you hear it getting louder?
The sound of noise increasing
A little piece of heaven now
This is the sound!

Throw your hands up and make some noise
Everybody get live and jump for joy
When I say reach you touch the sky
From the front to the back, from side to side
{Chorus}
Throw your hands up and make some noise
Everybody get live and jump for joy
When I say reach you touch the sky
From the front to the back, from side to side
Do you wanna be with me dancing?
Are you gonna be by my side?
Never stop, we'll keep on moving
Are you ready to take this ride?
Doesn't matter where you come from
Doesn't matter what place you're in
Yeah, its the time to get on
Hear the rhythm and you begin
{Chorus X4}
Throw your hands up and make some noise
Everybody get live and jump for joy
When I say reach you touch the sky
From the front to the back, from side to side
Get on up, put your hands in the air
Jump5 is getting down so you better beware
Gotta do it like this, see you do it like that
Do it side to side from the front to the back
See you kick it... See you ride the groove
Do it any way you want, but I gotta see you move
If you got it going on then you're never giving up
If you wanna get down then throw your hands up!
Can you hea it getting louder?
The sound of noise increasing
A little piece of heaven now
This is the sound gonna raise the ceiling
{Chorus X4}
Throw your hands up and make some noise
Everybody get live and jump for joy
When I say reach you touch the sky
