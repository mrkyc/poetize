Sometimes I feel like I am so insecure
If I could learn a thing or two from you
Then popular opinion I could ignore
You are enough for me, I don't need anything but you. Ya
You are enough for me, and I don't need anything
CHOURUS
Cuz' you have given me more than I could ask for
More than I could ever imagine
And you keep givin' me love
You keep on liftin' me up
It doesn't get any better
Why do I do the things I do?
Lord, everyday is showing me something new
I need to slow down, need to learn from you
Cuz' you're the only one I should listen to
You are enough for me, I don't need anything but you. Ya
You are enough for me, and I don't need anything
CHOURUS
Cuz' you have given me more than I could ask for
More than I could ever imagine
And you keep givin' me love
You keep on liftin' me up
It doesn't get any better
You might also likeLord you show me how
To do it right, that comes around
Even when I'm down
I can count on you to help me stand my ground
Cuz' you have given me more than I could ask for
More than I could ever imagine
And you keep givin' me love
You keep on liftin' me up
It doesn't get any better
CHOURUS
Cuz' you have given me more than I could ask for
More than I could ever imagine
And you keep givin' me love

You keep givin' me love
You keep liftin' me up
