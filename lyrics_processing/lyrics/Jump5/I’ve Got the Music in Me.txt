No foolish dreams to make me cry
I'm never frightened or worried
I know I'll always get by
I heat up, I cool down
When something gets in my way I go round it
Won't let life get me down
Gonna take it the way that I found it
I've got the music in me, I've got the music in me, I've got the music in me
I've got the music in me, I've got the music in me, I've got the music in me
Some say that life is a circle
But that ain't the way that I found it
Gonna move in a straight line
Keeping my feet firmly on the ground
I heat up, I cool down
I've got words in my head so I'll say them
Won't let life get me down
Catch a hold of my blues and just play them
I've got the music in me, I've got the music in me, I've got the music in me
I've got the music in me, I've got the music in me, I've got the music in me

Gonna tell you I'm in the neighbourhood
Gonna fly like a bird on the wing
Hold onto your hat honey - sing, sing, sing, sing
I heat up, I cool down
I've got words in my head so I'll say them
Won't let life get me down
Catch a hold of my blues and you know I'll play them
I've got the music in me, I've got the music in me, I've got the music in me
I've got the music in me, I've got the music in me, I've got the music in me
I got music, I got music, I've got the music in me
I've got the music in me, I've got the music in me
