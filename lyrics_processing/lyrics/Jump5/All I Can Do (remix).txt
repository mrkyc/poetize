And I don't have to pretend
All my friends think I'm crazy
But I don't want this to end
When I have the chance I want to say to you
I can never take back what I put you through
I'll never do it again
We're like oil and water; still we somehow mix
And what used to be broken is somehow fixed
It's hard to explain
I know some people say that opposites attract
If that's the truth then we
We will be together forever
It's like i got nothing to do but think about you
I've got all the time in the world
If you look in my heart, you'll know from the start
That it's all I can do not to think about you
I gave you good reason, to walk out the door
Let me tell you I've learned a thing or two
And I'm so amazed at the things you do
Now don't let me go, oh no

If that's the truth then we, we're meant to be together forever
It's like I got nothing to do but think about you
I've got all the time in the world
If you look in my heart, you'll know from the start
That it's all I can do, not to think about you
I know some people say that opposites attract
If that's the truth then we, we belong together forever
It's like I got nothing to do but think about you
I've got all the time in the world
If you look in my heart, you'll know from the start
That it's all i can do not to think about you
Nothing to do but think about you
I've got all the time in the world
If you look in my heart, you'll know from the start
