Ring ting tingling too
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you
Outside the snow is falling
And friends are calling "Yoo hoo"
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you
Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap
Let's go, let's look at the show
We're riding in a wonderland of snow
Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap
It's grand, just holding your hand
We're gliding along with a song of a wintry fairy land
Our cheeks are nice and rosy
And comfy cozy are we
We're snuggled up together
Like two birds of a feather would be
Let's take that road before us and sing a chorus or two
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you
It's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you

At the home of Farmer Gray
It'll be the perfect ending of a perfect day
We'll be singing the songs
We love to sing without a single stop
At the fireplace while we watch the chestnuts pop
Pop! Pop! Pop!
There's a happy feeling
Nothing in the world can buy
When they pass around the chocolate and the pumpkin pie
It'll nearly be like a picture print
By Currier and Ives
These wonderful things are the things
We remember all through our lives
Just hear those sleigh bells jingling
Ring ting tingling too
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you
Outside the snow is falling
And friends are calling "Yoo hoo"
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you
Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap
