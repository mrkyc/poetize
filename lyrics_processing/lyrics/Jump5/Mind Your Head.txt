You wanna be in the headline
Your name in black and white
You wanna go for the big time
Can't shake the feeling
You wanna walk in the limelight
And take the road by storm
You wanna reach for the highlight
And be the new thing
(Pre-chorus 1:)
I told you from the start
There's nothing wrong with what you said
But deep inside my heart
I wanna tell you
(Chorus:)
Mind your head
Get out of bed
Don't realize your own demise
You gotta redefine your state of mind
So take as read
The word has said you gotta mind you head
(Verse 2:)
You wanna be with the best of and Hollywood in name
Somebody nobody heard of
Who made the big time
You wanna see what ya can do
When running side by side
You wanna know will ya get through
And make the headline

But if you want to learn
Then everything will be alright
