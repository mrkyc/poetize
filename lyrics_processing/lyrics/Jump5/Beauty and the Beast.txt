La da da da da...
(Beauty and the Beast)

Tale as old as time
True as it can be
Barely even friends
Than somebody bends
Unexpectedly

Just a little change hu, hu-oh
Small, to say the least
Both a little scared
Neither one prepared
Beauty and the Beast

Ever just the same
In your eyes I am beautiful
Ever a surprise
A love like this is a miracle
Ever as before
Ever just as sure
As the sun will rise
You might also like
Tale as old as time
Tune as old as song
Bittersweet and strange
Finding you can change
Learning you were wrong

Certain as the sun hu, hu-oh
Rising in the east
Tale as old as time
Song as old as rhyme
Beauty and the Beast

Ever just the same
Ever just the same
Ever a surprise
Ever a surprise
Ever as before
Ever just as sure
Ever just as sure
As the sun will rise
As the sun will rise
Ever just the same
In your eyes I am beautiful
Ever a surprise
A love like this is a miracle
Ever as before
Ever just as sure
Ever just as sure
As the sun will rise
Certain as the sun certain as the sun
Rising in the east
Tale as old as time
Song as old as rhyme
Beauty and the Beast Beauty and the Beast
Tale as old as time
Song as old as rhyme
Beauty and the Beast  Beauty and the Beast
Tale as old as time
Song as old as rhyme
Beauty and the Beast

Ever just the same
Ever a surprise
Ever as before
The sun will rise
Tale as old as time
Ever just the same
Ever a surprise
Ever as before
Beauty and the Beast
The sun will rise
Tale as old as time
Ever just the same
Ever a surprise
Ever as before
The sun will rise
Beauty and the Beast
