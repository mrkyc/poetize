Hang the lights and deck the halls with holly
Gather 'round, it's a celebration
Bring everyone that you know
Sleigh bells ring just around the corner
"Fa lala la" crossing every border
Snow is falling but the fire's burning
Just is time for the holiday
We're gonna rock this Christmas all night long (oooohh...)
(Merry Christmas...) We're gonna rock until the season's gone
(Merry Christmas...) Start the party, crank the music
(And a happy new year...) Come on, everybody, all we're gonna do is (ooh)
Rock this Christmas all night long (oooohh...)
(Merry Christmas...) We're gonna rock until the season's gone
(Merry Christmas...) Start the party, crank the music
(And a happy new year...) Come on, everybody, all we're gonna do is rock (oh, yeah)
Pucker up, we're standin' under the mistletoe
It's my party and I say we rock 'n roll
Grab somebody and get on the dance floor
To celebrate the holiday
So get up, cheer up, I wanna see you shakin'
Catch that Christmas feelin', let's go crazy, baby
I know you want, you wanna have fun
So rock around the clock all night
