I step 
There was only few that knew where to find me
Look into your soul, deep into your mind and shit
He must be out there and getting a grip
Tryna get it on cause I'm broke
The only thing I knew was to slang a little coke
Back to the hood where I am from
I'm so damn  niggas is looking at me dumb
'Cause they can tell I ain't been in society
Is 10 long years enough for an OG? Stuck in that small as cell
Where the cannabis passing with no ma'fucking bill, and that's real


Its been 6 months and I'm still on the outs
I heard that all the ballers done moved down south
They say that's where the money at
And tell a player like myself may not get to have my scratch
First we smoking on the bus, the 
Houston, Texas at the spot it's going down
I got to have my , I turn't a hundred dollars to a 
I knew how to bounce, I had to pack this weight back, when
When I used to sell keys before they gave me 10
And know my scratch is off the hook
I knew I had it in me and it's all that took

My whole  is under surveillance
But now they're following me 'cause I'm that nigga who made it
Organized it, put it together and shit
Made it happen, distribute it through my click
Now my whole operation is shut down
I'm on the hush, on the tuck not making a sound
They tryna take me off the streets
They tryna say I'm a threat to society
But you'll never get  nigga to snitch about my click
It ain't nothing 'bout silent ish
What they ain't knowing is I got my scratch
So fuck the government and it ain't no more sound
So don't even trip off me 'cause I slide out the game, still true to the streets
Uh, that's right, true to the ma'fucking streets
