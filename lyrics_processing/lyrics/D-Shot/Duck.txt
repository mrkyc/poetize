Look what they done, look what they done
Out and in, in and out
Somebody say
In and out, out and in
In and out
Somebody say, from the beginning to the end

Somebody tell me where my weeples at
Somebody tell me where my dudes at
Why you muthafuckas beef when muthafuckas most needy?
Tanked out, gettin' tweeded
While I'm strapless, loose as a goose, poor excuse
Ridiculous and drunk off that alcohol, squabbin'
Back up against the wall, mobbin'
Bobbin' and weavin', still breathin'
They keep comin', a hundred
This way, I'm outnumbered

I gets busy, put 'em on 'em
Gets loose in the wind, and don't know 'em
'Cause when I show 'em what I got and what I do
They be lurkin', tryna stick to a nigga like glue
But, fuck you
I'm a playa like Filthy, tryna strive
Back seat, Special Brew St. Ides
So when I ride, I'm bulletproof with the strap
But I'd rather get fucked up, keyed, and tached
You might also like
Bust, Bust, Bust, they don't want none of us
In and out, out and in, muthafuckas betta
Duck, Duck, Duck, niggas don't give a fuck
In and out, out and in

They couldn't deal with the fame
'Specially when I transferred game
Enhancing my skills by usin' my brain
I took it to the next
All of a sudden comes big respect
The life I'm livin' ain't cool for a playa, playa
'Cause everything a nigga do is straight major
You think them niggas lovin' you for bein' a mack?
You think them niggas lovin' you and got yo back?
The only nigga got yo back is number one
That's why a nigga like myself carry gun

You know what, it's a drought, pimp
You think we're finished?
Nah, nah, pimp, nigga we got chemists
Cooks, chefs, kilograms
Chops, techs, pots and pans
I don't smoke brown weed, I smoke county greens
Big pimpin', loadin' up magazines
And ride down on a perpetrator
Hit ya now and get ya later


I got a call from the lawyer, he was tellin' me, Loc
B, you betta watch who you call yo folks
It seems to me, shit ain't too tight
I got the paperwork, black on white
Your homeboy sung like Lou Rawls
Told everything he knew, he had loose jaws
And with the new laws, you'll come up short
So he bet' not make it to the court

Uhh ya-yank him out the game mayne, out the game mayne
Yank him out the game mayne, out the game mayne
It gets mannisher and mannisher
Mo' keys than a janitor
Nigga's disrespected, time to put down a thirty second check
And I take it that he don't reckon, but I got the biggest weapon
Them zips, them zones, them faulty cloned phones
Them million dollar spots, hundred dollar knocks
Stay away from wishy-washy ass niggas
Always lookin for a c-uh-come up ass niggas
I had a son at the age of like seventeen
Got sent to jail at the age of like eighteen
Sittin' in that cell, thinkin' about the things that I did
Sittin' in that cell, made a playa shed some tears
I'm havin' thoughts, suicidal intentions done came
But now, them thoughts almost drove a playa insane
Until my momma told me this
Son, you gon' get out one day, so don't trip
Just keep yo mind on The Man up above
You do yo part, and he gon' show you some love
He gon' show you some love, one more time
