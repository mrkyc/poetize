You take Grandpa's empty shell of an '82 land yacht
Throw on some re-caps and change out the points and plugs
You bungee down coolers and rig up a little bit of Bluetooth
Then you roll out the indoor-outdoor AstroTurf rug and load 'er on up

And away we go
In the Winnebago
Just hammerin' down and cruisin' around
Anywhere the wind blows
When we wanna spend the night
Baby, string up the party lights
Break out the beers and the foldin' chairs
And let the good times roll
In my W-I-double N-E-bago
Anywhere you wanna go, just say so
It's a slow-lane interstate stage coach
W-I-double N-E-bago

Now we could anchor down in the infield of Talladega
Watch them boys go 'round and 'round and 'round and 'round
Or we could follow that smell and get a little Bonnaroo crazy
Or we could hook up the summer home hook-ups
On the lake outside of town

And away we go
In the Winnebago
Just hammerin' down and cruisin' around
Anywhere the wind blows
When we wanna spend the night
Baby, string up the party lights
Break out the beers and the foldin' chairs
And let the good times roll
In my W-I-double N-E-bago
Anywhere you wanna go, just say so
It's a slow-lane interstate stage coach
W-I-double N-E-bago

Yeah, step out, grab a seat, baby, you can watch me
Grill it up, flip it up, workin' that hibachi
We'll get some stickers from wherever we go
And, baby, you can stick 'em on my Winnebago

And away we go
In the Winnebago
Just hammerin' down and cruisin' around
Anywhere the wind blows
When we wanna spend the night
Baby, string up the party lights
Break out the beers and the foldin' chairs
And let the good times roll
In my W-I-double N-E-bago
Anywhere you wanna go, just say so
It's a slow-lane interstate stage coach
