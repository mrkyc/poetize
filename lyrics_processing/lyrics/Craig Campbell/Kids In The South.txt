Yeah we rode them fixer uppers
We learned the taste of Red Man early on
We learned to shoot on .22's
Put bullet holes in Mountain Dews
Knew ever word to every Skynyrd song
Our daddy's were our heroes
They made us work for free though
That summer son was hell hot beating down

We were kids in the south
Yeah that was us what we knew what we love
Jack it up get it stuck
That's whats up in a next to no where town
Riddin' round chasin' girls in the only world
We knew anything about
We were kids in the south
Yeah we were
We had letters on our jackets
Yeah that stadium we packed it
On Friday night wasn't no place else to be
Win or lose hell either way
We party straight through Saturday
And on Sunday morning try not to fall asleep
Sippin' on that sweet tea Braves on the T.V
Half us on the floor half on the couch

We were kids in the south
Yeah that was us what we knew what we love
Jack it up get it stuck
That's whats up in a next to no where town
Riddin' round chasin' girls in the only world
We knew anything about
We were kids in the south

Some went to find what they was lookin' for
Some hung around some went to war
Don't really matter where we are right now
We were kids in the south
Shit

We were kids in the south
Yeah that was us what we knew what we love
Jack it up get it stuck
That's whats up in a next to no where town
Riddin' round chasin' girls in the only world
We knew anything about
We were kids in the south
Yeah that was up what we knew what we love
Jack it up get it stuck
We were kids in the south
Yeah that was up what we knew what we love
Washed in the mud washed in the blood
We were kids in the south
Oh we were kids in the south
