I see you

Girl I ain't never had anybody talk me into leaving
When I'm hanging at my spot and all my boys are drinking
Shooting some pool shooting some shots
Playing it cool on that old juke box
Ain't nobody ain't gonna tame this wild side

But I'd like to see you try tonight
You're my kind of country fine
And I just might change my mind
The way you keep crossing lines
With all them moves
I'm seeing double thinking twice
And I'd like to see you try

Rolling me out on the dance floor
Talkin' me into walkin' out of that back door
End of the song takin' you home gettin' it on
Yup

I'd like to see you try to tell my buddies where we're goin'
Say we'll put it to the floor and drive it like we stole it
Steal a little kiss off of my lips no girl don't quit
You might also like
I'd like to see you try tonight
You're my kind of country fine
And I just might change my mind
The way you keep crossing lines
With all them moves
I'm seeing double thinking twice
And I'd like to see you try

Rolling me out on the dance floor
Talkin' me into walkin' out of that back door
End of the song takin' you home gettin' it on

Yeah I'd like to see you try tonight
Hell I've done made up my mind
But you ain't gotta stop trying
Who am I kiddin' you know I'm going home with you baby

But I'd like to see you try tonight
You're my kind of country fine
And I just might change my mind
The way you keep crossing lines
With all them moves
I'm seeing double thinking twice
And I'd like to see you try
You're my kind of country fine
And I just might change my mind
The way you keep crossing lines
With all them moves
I'm seeing double thinking twice
And I'd like to see you try
Rolling me out on the dance floor
Talkin' me into walkin' out of that back door
