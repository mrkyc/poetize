You never mind the every night two AM phone call
Drivin' by hopin' I'd catch you in the front yard
Said goodbye but I'm actin' like I still got something to lose
It's just me missing you
Now and then when I see your friends pretend I'm doing alright
Like I don't stare a hole in the ceiling all night
Prayin' like somebody might have a miracle I could use
It's just me missing you

I know I told you I could take it or leave it
When it came to forever baby
What was I thinkin' I'm a fool
When the truth is it's just me missing you

I didn't mean to make a scene
Or make you mad damn near everyday
Nobody told me there was vodka in the lemonade
Or you were gonna be there
'cause baby this is on me
It's just me missing you
You gotta let me make it up to you apologize
While I'm at it let me tell you what's been on my mind
I know it's a little late I've made a big mistake
I've made a big mistake

Ohhh I know I told you I could take it or leave it
When it came to forever baby
What was I thinkin' I'm a fool
When the truth is it's just me missing you

I take it back I didn't mean it that way
I thought I knew what I wanted
'Til I woke up and you're gone
And I'm a fool 'cause the truth is
It's just me missing you
Missing you

I know I told you I could take it or leave it
When it came to forever baby
What was I thinkin' I'm a fool
'Cause the truth is it's just me missing you

I take it back I didn't mean it that way
I thought I knew what I wanted
'Til I woke up and you're gone
And I'm a fool 'cause the truth is
It's just me missing you
Missing you
This is me missing you
Missing you
This is me missing you
Missing you
This is me missing you
