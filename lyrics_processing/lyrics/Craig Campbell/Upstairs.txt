You traced your lips in ruby red
That little perfume on your neck
Slipped on that black dress
You know I can't resist
Low cut high heals
All I know is the way I feel
And you can blame yourself for this

I was gonna take you out
I was gonna take you down town
I was gonna spend all night doing it right
But look at what you done now
I was gonna take my time
I was gonna buy the wine
And let you off the ground
Oh now I don't wanna take you anywhere
I don't wanna take you anywhere
I don't wanna take you anywhere
But upstairs

Now don't look at me like it ain't fair
You're the one who went and let down your hair
Girl I'm going crazy and all that's on my mind
Is your smile your kiss we're in a moment I don't wanna miss
So let's stay in tonight
You might also like
I was gonna take you out
I was gonna take you down town
I was gonna spend all night doing it right
But look at what you done now
I was gonna take my time
I was gonna buy the wine
And let you off the ground
Oh now I don't wanna take you anywhere
I don't wanna take you anywhere
I don't wanna take you anywhere
But upstairs

Yeah I was gonna take you out
I was gonna take you down town
I was gonna spend all night doing it right
But look at what you done now
I was gonna take my time
I was gonna buy the wine
And let you off the ground
Oh now I don't wanna take you anywhere
I don't wanna take you anywhere
I don't wanna take you anywhere
But upstairs
I don't wanna take you anywhere
I don't wanna take you anywhere
I don't wanna take you anywhere
