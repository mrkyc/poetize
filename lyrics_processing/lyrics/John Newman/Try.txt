Working so hard, I was so alone
So much on my cards, so much goin' on
And lately, I've found I'm heading astray
And none of your feelings came in to play

I'll make you stronger (Stronger), stronger (Stronger)
'Cause now I can see those fakes that use me
I'll make you stronger (Stronger), stronger (Stronger)
'Cause I know it's you savin' me

I will try, try, try not to bring it all home
I will fight, fight, fight for what we had before
You don't even want this, you don't even need this
You don't have to cover up your tears at all
I will try, try, try not to bring it all home
Try, na-na-na, oh-oh

Ten days apart when three seems insane
You can't hear my voice, you still hear my name
A call from afar, a message to send
I pray you don't leave me, nothing's changed
You might also like
I'll make you stronger (Stronger), stronger (Stronger)
'Cause now I can see those fakes that use me
I'll make you stronger (Stronger), stronger (Stronger)
'Cause I know it's you savin' me

I will try, try, try not to bring it all home
I will fight, fight, fight for what we had before
You don't even want this, you don't even need this
You don't have to cover up your tears at all
I will try, try, try not to bring it all home
No, no, no, no

Oh, I'm so sorry, darling
I've been breaking this home for far too long
So I, I

I will try (Try-try, try-try)
I will fight (Fight-fight, fight-fight)
You don't even want this, you don't even need this
You don't have to cover up your tears at all
I will try, try, try not to bring it all home
