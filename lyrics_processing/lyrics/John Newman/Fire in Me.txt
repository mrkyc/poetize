I'm never gonna let it go
I'm never gonna let it go

I'm starting with my intuition
I'm starting with my strengths
I'm getting back my old ambitions
Returning once again
My knuckles are so red and raw (wouh)
From breaking through these walls
Sick of all the others talk (wouh)
And the laughter of my fall

I was a spark in the night, but you drown me out
So, I'll take the walls, I'm inside, and I'll burn them down

Cause I still got a fire in me
I never wanna let it go
I never wanna let it go
I-I-I-I I still got a fire in me
I never wanna let it go
I never wanna let it go
I-I-I-I I still got a fire in me
I never wanna let it go
I never wanna let it go
I-I-I-I I still got a fire in me
I never wanna let it go
I never wanna let it go
I-I-I-I I still got a fire in me
You might also like
I've dealt with all my evils (wouh)
And I'm dealing with them twice
There will never be a sequel
And the curtain will never rise
Although my body has been aching
I head on to the rocks, oh no
I've never left the beacon
And I won't be letting go

'Cause still got a fire in me
I never wanna let it go
I never wanna let it go
I-I-I-I I still got a fire in me
I never wanna let it go
I never wanna let it go
I-I-I-I I still got a fire in me
I never wanna let it go
I never wanna let it go
I-I-I-I I still got a fire in me
I never wanna let it go
I never wanna let it go
I-I-I-I I still got a fire in me

I was a spark in the night, but you drown me out
So, I'll take the walls, I'm inside, and I'll burn them down
I was a spark in the night, but you drown me out
So, I'll take the walls, I'm inside, and I'll burn them down
'Cause still got a fire in me
I never wanna let it go
I never wanna let it go
I-I-I-I I still got a fire in me
I never wanna let it go
I never wanna let it go

I never wanna let it go
I never wanna let it go
