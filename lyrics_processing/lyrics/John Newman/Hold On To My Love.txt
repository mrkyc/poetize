Tryna tell you what it feels like
Spendin' time without you
Never felt so empty inside at night
So sad, but it's true

Tell me it's alright
Tell me it's all good
Hold on to my love
Hold on to my love
Tell me it's alright
Tell me it's all good
Hold on to my love
Hold on to my love

Hold on to my love (Hold on to my, hold on to my)
Hold on to my love (Hold on to my, hold on to my)
Hold on to my love (Hold on to my, hold on to my)
Hold on to my love (Hold on to my)
Hold on to my love

Hold on to my love
(Hold on to my, hold on to my)
Hold on to my love (Hold on to my)
Hold on to my love (Hold on to my)
(Hold on to my)
Hold on to my love
You might also like
Should've told you in the first place
Should've shown how much I care
Tryna find a way to end this heartache
Only you can take me there

Tell me it's alright
Tell me it's all good
Hold on to my love
Hold on to my love

Hold on to my love (Hold on to my, hold on to my)
Hold on to my love (Hold on to my, hold on to my)
Hold on to my love (Hold on to my, hold on to my)
Hold on to my love (Hold on to my)
Hold on to my love

Hold on to my love
(Hold on to my, hold on to my)
Hold on to my love (Hold on to my)
Hold on to my love (Hold on to my)
(Hold on to my)
Hold on to my love
(Hold on to my, hold on to my)
(Hold on to my, hold on to my)
Hold on to my love
