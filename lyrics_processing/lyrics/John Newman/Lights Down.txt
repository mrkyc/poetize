Oh baby
Is it right, is it right, is it all good?
So you see lately
Given up, given up, given up on love
And you, you...
You can try and change my ways
But I'm so scared baby
In the morning I will run again

I can feel it with the lights down baby
With the lights down baby, no, no
I can feel it with the lights down baby
With the lights down baby, no, no
No, no
I can feel it with the lights down baby
With the lights down baby, no, no
I can feel it with the lights down baby
With the lights down baby, no, no
Oh yeah!
I can feel it with the lights down baby
With the lights down baby, no, no

I can't keep playing
The games I'm playing every night
Guess I'm just hiding
The broken man I am inside
But you, you...
You could help me change my ways
But I'm so scared baby
In the morning I will run again
You might also like
I can feel it with the lights down baby
With the lights down baby, no, no
I can feel it with the lights down baby
With the lights down baby, no, no
Oh yeah!
I can feel it with the lights down baby
With the lights down baby, no, no

Letting out, letting out the pain that we hide within
(No, we ain't doing nothing wrong)
Letting out, letting out the pain that we hide within
(C'mon C'mon)

I can feel it with the lights down baby, with the lights down baby, no, no
I can feel it with the lights down baby, with the lights down baby, no, no
I can feel it with the lights down baby, with the lights down baby, no, no
