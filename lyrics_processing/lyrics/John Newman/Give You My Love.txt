I keep, I keep
Calling and calling
Then regret it in the morning
I see, I see
The pressure gets boring
But my worries keep on haunting

I've changed, changed
I won't put my trust in you to stay, stay
Just keep on feeling me the truth

Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
I wanna give you my love
I wanna give you my heart
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
I wanna give you my love
I wanna give you my heart
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
I wanna give you my love
I wanna give you my heart
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
I wanna give you my love
I wanna give you my heart

Baby... lately
I'm trying, I'm trying
To put my past behind me
You'll see, you'll see
I'm vulnerable and still weak
I feel it when we can't speak

I've changed, changed
I won't put my trust in you to stay, stay
I love this sick I work for you

Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
I wanna give you my love
I wanna give you my heart
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
I wanna give you my love
I wanna give you my heart
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
I wanna give you my love
I wanna give you my heart
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
I wanna give you my love
I wanna give you my heart
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
I wanna give you my love
I wanna give you my heart
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
I wanna give you my love
I wanna give you my heart
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
I wanna give you my love
I wanna give you my heart
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
I wanna give you my love
