Know I've done wrong
I left your heart torn
Is that what devils do?
Took you so low
Where only fools go
I shook the angel in you

Now I'm rising from the ground
Rising up to you
Filled with all the strength I found
There's nothing I can't do
(I need to know now, know now
Can you love me again?)
I need to know now, know now
Can you love me again?

I need to know now, know now
Can you love me again?
I need to know now, know now
Can you love me again?
I need to know now, know now
Can you love me again?
I need to know now, know now
Can you love me again?
You might also like
It's unforgivable
I stole and burnt your soul
Is that what demons do?
They rule the worst of me
Destroy everything
They bring down angels like you

Now I'm rising from the ground
Rising up to you
Filled with all the strength I found
There's nothing I can't do

I need to know now, know now
Can you love me again?
I need to know now, know now
Can you love me again?
I need to know now, know now
Can you love me again?
I need to know now, know now
Can you love me again?

I told you once, I can't do this again
Do this again, oh lord
I told you once, I can't do this again
Do this again, oh no
I need to know now, know now
Can you love me again?

I need to know now, know now
Can you love me again?
I need to know now, know now
Can you love me again?
I need to know now, know now
(Can you love me again?)
I need to know now, know now
Can you love me again?

Can you love me again?
Can you love me again?
Can you love me again?
