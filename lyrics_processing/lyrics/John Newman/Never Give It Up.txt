I wanna love you, but it just don't feel right
I really need it, but I can't stay the night
Cause you, oh, you never give it up
You, oh, you never give it up, aah

You say you'd wait for me, wait for me
Wait 'til I got home
Sit me on the sofa put the television on
Then show me what, show me what
Show me what you need
But the lover in your paper feels a different man to me

I don't feel that, babe
I don't feel that, babe
I don't feel that, babe

I wanna love you, but it just don't feel right
I really need it, but I can't stay the night
Cause you, oh, you never give it up
You, oh, you never give it up (oh because)
I wanna love you, but it just don't feel right
I really need it, but I can't stay the night
Cause you, oh, you never give it up (oh because)
You, oh, you never give it up, aah
You might also like
You keep on calling me, calling me
Calling me for hope
To be honest, every time you call, I'm busy, I can't talk
You're saying it, saying it
Saying it, alright
If I could pick up you finally give it up tonight

I don't feel that, babe
I don't feel that, babe
I don't feel that, babe

I wanna love you, but it just don't feel right
I really need it, but I can't stay the night
Cause you, oh, you never give it up
You, oh, you never give it up (oh because)
I wanna love you, but it just don't feel right
I really need it, but I can't stay the night
Cause you, oh, you never give it up (oh because)
You, oh, you never give it up, aah
I wanna love you, but it just don't feel right
(It just don't feel right)
I really need it, but I can't stay the night
(Can't stay the night)
Cause you, oh, you never give it up
You, oh, you never give it up (oh because)
I wanna love you, but it just don't feel right
(It just don't feel right)
I really need it, but I can't stay the night
Cause you, oh, you never give it up
(Never give it up)
