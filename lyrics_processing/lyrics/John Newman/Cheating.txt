One, two, three, four

I saw you Sunday, Monday (Ah)
Hanging with your man again
You came back on a Tuesday (Ah)
With that cold-heart look of shame

Oh, I could love you better
Better than you once knew
And if you're cheating, cheat on, yeah
'Cause cheating's just a thing you do
It's just a thing you do

I saw you Friday, Sunday (Ah)
Tearing up another heart
You came home a-crying (Ah)
Why'd you take it all so hard?

You know I'd love you better
Better than you once knew
And if you're cheating, cheat on, yeah
But I would never cheat on you
Yeah, I could love you better
Better than you once knew
And if you're cheating, cheat on, yeah
'Cause cheating's just a thing you do
It's just a thing you do, yeah

Oh, oh, oh, I've been told you, baby
Girl, you done some things so bad to me
And I know

You are the one that's creeping
You are the one that's cheating
But if your heart is beating
Bring it on, bring it to me
You are the one that's creeping
You are the one that's cheating
But if your heart is beating
Bring it on, bring it to me
You are the one that's creeping
You are the one that's cheating
But if your heart is beating
Bring it on, bring it to me (Oh)
You are the one that's creeping
You are the one that's cheating
But if your heart is beating
Bring it on, bring it to me

I could love you better
Better than you once knew
And if you're cheating, cheat on, yeah
But I would never cheat on you, no
Yeah, I could love you better
Better than you once knew
And if you're cheating, cheat on, yeah
'Cause cheating's just a thing you do, no, no, no, no
Oh, uh
