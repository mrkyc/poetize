If love is blind I will see you
If love is lost I will hunt
I'm crawling back, I'm crawling back, oh baby
I'm crawling back, I'm crawling back for more

If love is cold I will warm you
If love is dark I will bring light
I'm crawling back, I'm crawling back, oh baby
I'm crawling back, I'm crawling back for more

Cause I, I, I get a little lost from my home
And I, I, I, I'm still here, in our home

If I really need you
Would you walk back through the door?
Should I keep looking
I keep searching through the past, the past
All or not-no-no
Need you
Would you walk back through the door?
Should I keep looking
I keep searching through the past, the past, ooh
It's so lonely...
You might also like
When you're (?) I need
Everytime I message you delete it
I'm crawling back, I'm crawling back, oh baby
I keep crawling back, I'm crawling back for more

Cause I, I, I get a little lost from our home
And I, I, I, I'm still here in our home

If I really need you
Would you walk back through the door?
Should I keep looking
I keep searching through the past, the past
All or not-no-no
Need you
Would you walk back through the door?
Should I keep looking
I keep searching through the past, the past, ooh
It's so lonely...

Scream it out on the driver,baby
Screaming outside our door
I need your love like before (I need your love like before)
Save me from this loneliness
And pick me off the floor
I need your love like before
If I really need you
Would you walk back through the door?
Ooh, if I really need you
Would you walk back through the door?
Should I keep looking
I keep searching through the past, the past
Not-no-no-no-no
Need you
Would you walk back through the door?
Should I keep looking
I keep searching through the past, the past, ooh

When love is blind I would see you
When love is lost I would hunt
I'm crawling back, I'm crawling back, oh baby
