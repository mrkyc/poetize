It's hard for me to
Find enough strength to
Feed the fires
That fuel my ego
And consequently all my pride
Has all but died
Which leaves me
Down on my knees
Back to the place I
Should have started from
Been beat up
Been broken down
Nowhere but up
When you're face down
On the ground
I'm in last place
If I place at all
But there's hope for this underdog!
That's the way, uh-huh, we like it!
That's the way, uh-huh, we like it!
You can call me the underdog
I'm in this race to win a prize
The odds against me
The world has plans for my demise
What they don't see is
That a winner is not judged
By his small size
But by the
Substitute he picks to
Run the race
And mine's already won
You might also likeBeen beat up
Been broken down
Nowhere but up
When you're face down
On the ground
I'm in last place
If I place at all
But there's hope for this underdog!
That's the way, uh-huh, we like it!
That's the way, uh-huh, we like it!
That's the way, uh-huh, we like it!
That's the way, uh-huh, we like it!
Spoken:
Underdog, I wince every time I say the word
Especially in connection with Jesus
Yet, as I read the birth stories about Jesus
(I've got freedom, I've got freedom)
I cannot help but conclude that although the world may be tilted towards the rich and the powerful
God, hallelujah, in the prophecy
Is still the Lord behind us all
That's the way, uh-huh, we like it!
That's the way, uh-huh, we like it!
That's the way, uh-huh, we like it!
That's the way, uh-huh, we like it!
That's the way, uh-huh, we like it!
That's the way
That's the way
Uh-huh, we like it!
That's the way, uh-huh, we like it!
