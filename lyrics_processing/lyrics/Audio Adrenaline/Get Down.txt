Yeah, get down
Yeah, get down
Yeah, get down
Yeah, get down
Yeah, get down
Yeah

Lavishly, our lives are wasted
Humbleness is left untasted
You can't live your life to please yourself, yeah
That's a tip from my mistakes
Exactly what it doesn't take
To win you've got to come in last place, yeah

To live your life, you've got to lose it
And all the losers get a crown

I get down, He lifts me up
I get down, He lifts me up
I get down, He lifts me up
I get down
You might also like
All I need's another day
Where I can't seem to get away
From the many things that drag me down, yeah
I'm sure you've had a day like me
Where nothin' seems to set you free
From burdens you can't carry all alone

In your weakness, He is stronger
In your darkness, He shines through
When you're cryin', He's your comfort
When you're all alone, He's carrying you

I get down, He lifts me up
I get down, He lifts me up
I get down, He lifts me up
I get down
I get down, He lifts me up (La-la-la-la)
I get down, He lifts me up (La-la)
I get down, He lifts me up
Every time I'm down, the Lord lifts me up (Yeah)

This valley is so deep
I can barely see the sun (Come on, y'all)
I cry out for mercy, Lord
And You lift me up again
I get down, and He lifts me up
I get down, He lifts me up
I get down, He lifts me up
I get down
I get down, He lifts me up (La-la-la-la)
I get down, He lifts me up (La-la)
I get down, He lifts me up (La-la-la-la)
I get down, yeah

Down
I get down
I get down
I get down
I get down, He lifts me up
I get down, He lifts me up
I get down, He lifts me up
I get down

I get down, He lifts me up (La-la-la-la)
I get down, He lifts me up (La-la)
I get down, He lifts me up (La-la-la-la)
I get down
I get down, He lifts me up (La-la-la-la)
I get down, He lifts me up (La-la)
I get down, He lifts me up (La-la-la-la)
Every time I'm down the Lord lifts me up, yeah
