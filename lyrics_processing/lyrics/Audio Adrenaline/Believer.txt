I want to live this life
Unsafe, unsure, but not afraid
What I want is to give all I got somehow
Giving up letting go of control right now

'Cause I'm already out here
Blind but I can see
I see the way You're moving
God how I believe that

I can push back the mountains
Can stand on the waves
I can see through the darkness
I'll hold up the flame
Take me to the ocean
I want to go deeper
But I'm not afraid, no
I'm a believer

And so I lose this life
To find my way and come alive
They can try to deny what's inside of me
But there is more, can't ignore all the things unseen
You might also like
'Cause I'm already out here
Blind but I can see
I see the way You're moving
God how I believe that

I can push back the mountains
(I can push back, I can push back the mountains)
Can stand on the waves
I can see through the darkness
I'll hold up the flame
Take me to the ocean
(To the ocean, to the ocean)
I want to go deeper
But I'm not afraid, no
I'm a believer

Oh, I believe
I can walk on water with You, Lord

When I walk through the valley of the shadows
When I'm trapped in the middle of the battle
I will trust in You
'Cause trouble comes, but You never let it take me
I hold fast 'cause I know that You will save me
I will trust in You, I will trust in You
Oh, here I stand all alone
Waiting on You, Lord
I'm waiting on You

I can push back the mountains
(I can push back, I can push back the mountains)
Can stand on the waves
I can see through the darkness
I'll hold up the flame
Take me to the ocean
(To the ocean, to the ocean)
I want to go deeper
But I'm not afraid, no
No, I'm a believer

Walking through this (Oh)
, I (No, I'm a believer)
Reach through the darkness (Yeah)
To search for your light (Yes, I'm a believer)
In this moment of (Oh)
Total surrender (Oh, I will never leave)
You piece me together (Oh)
