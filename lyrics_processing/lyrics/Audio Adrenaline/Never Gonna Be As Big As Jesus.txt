Get my teeth capped, I know I could
Be a big star on the silver screen
Just like James Dean I could be a star
I could climb a corporate ladder
Buy, sell, and liquidate
Maybe be just like the Beatles
Melodic rocking heavyweights
I could learn to sing and dance
If I only had a chance
I could be a big rock star
I could do anything
I wanted to, yeah
I wanted to
I could be anything
But one thing's true
Never gonna be as big as Jesus
Never gonna hold the world in my hands
Never gonna be as big as Jesus
Never gonna build the promise land
But that, that's all right, O.K. with me
I could build a tower to heaven
Get on top and touch the sky
I could write a million songs
All designed to glorify
I could be about as good
Good as any human could
But that won't get me by
