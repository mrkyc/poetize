Yeah, yeah
Woo!

I don't know where you lay your head
Or where you call your home
I don't know where you eat your meals
Or where you talk on the phone
I don't know if you got a cook
A butler or a maid
I don't know if you got a yard
With a hammock in the shade

I don't know if you got some shelter
Say, a place to hide
I don't know if you live with friends
In whom you can confide
I don't know if you got a family
Say, a mom or dad
I don't know if you feel love at all
But I bet you wish you had

Come and go with me
To my Father's house
Come and go with me
To my Father's house
