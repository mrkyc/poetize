Why try and keep you a secret
Why be blinded by the night
There are seven billion people but it's a lonely world
Why wouldn't I let you see the light

Why would I hide you in the shadows
When this flame is dying for a hill
Say what they want about the straight and narrow
But it's the bends and curves that kill

'Cause it only takes a spark to set the heart on fire
I climb the mountain and I'll hold the light until
We are a city on a hill, city on a hill
We'll walk together and we won't let go until
We are a city on a hill, city on a hill

Oh-oh oh, oh-oh oh
Oh-oh oh, oh-oh oh-oh
Oh-oh oh, oh-oh oh
Oh-oh oh, oh-oh oh-oh

Why am I so scared of conversations
Am I so sure I'll turn you off?
Maybe if you knew the whole story, you'd understand it all
'Cause truth has a way of breaking through
You might also like
'Cause it only takes a spark to set the heart on fire
I climb the mountain and I'll hold the light until
We are a city on a hill, city on a hill
We'll walk together and we won't let go until
We are a city on a hill, city on a hill

Oh-oh oh, oh-oh oh
Oh-oh oh, oh-oh oh-oh
Oh-oh oh, oh-oh oh
Oh-oh oh, oh-oh oh-oh

I climb the mountain and I'll hold the light until
We are a city on a hill, city on a hill
We'll walk together and we won't let go until
We are a city on a hill, city on a hill
I climb the mountain and I'll hold the light until
We are a city on a hill, city on a hill
We'll walk together and we won't let go until
We are a city on a hill, city on a hill

Oh-oh oh, oh-oh oh
Oh-oh oh, oh-oh oh-oh
Oh-oh oh, oh-oh oh
Oh-oh oh, oh-oh oh-oh
'Cause truth has a way of breaking through
And truth has a way of breaking through
