So what?
Mohammed thought he had a plan
I guess not
A Hindhu god is an old cow
You can be a god if ya knew how
My God died on the cross!
My God died on the cross!
My God died on the cross!
But he lives!
My God is the only God
He's the only God that lives
He loves, He cares, He makes, He shares
An eternal life He gives
He took the pains that shook the chains
That rattled all of hell
Now you may think I'm crazy
But, only time will tell
Yo
Buddha was a fat man
So what?

A Hindu god is an old cow
You can be a god if ya knew how
You might also likeMy God died on the cross!
My God died on the cross!
My God died on the cross!
But, He lives!
There's a man over there
Standing on the street
He says, "I'm a god."
But, I think, he's a freak
Many different men are just what they claim
A moonie a mormon a man from Mars
A little off track but they have nice cars
Buddha was a fat man
So what?
Mohammed thought he had a plan
I guess not
A Hindu god is an old cow
You can be a god if ya knew
My God died on the cross!

CHOIR:
My precious Jesus died upon the cross
My precious Jesus died to save the lost
But He live yes He lives my Jesus Lives
He walks He talks He loves He rocks
My Jesus lives
TALKING:
This is Reverend Booty
I want to talk to you this morning
About Jesus
That's right, Jesus
Can you say, Jesus?
Hallelujah, sistah!
Yesterday, a man comes up to me
He said, "Reverend Booty, I believe in a big fat cow."
I said, "My God died on the cross not at McDonalds."
Hallelujah, say, Jesus, Jesus lives, Jesus lives
Buddha was a fat man
So what?
Mohammed thought he had a plan
I guess not
A Hindu god is an old cow
You can be a god if ya knew how
My God died on the cross!

But, He lives!
There's one important thing
That you should know
Jesus Christ paid the price
We all think it's nice
Spread His arms and died for me
But we're not doing what we can
We need to go to our work and our school
Tell all the people that
Hey, God Rules!
Buddha was a fat man
So what?
Mohammed thought he had a plan
I guess not
A Hindu god is an old cow
You can be a god if ya knew how
My God died on the cross!
My God died on the cross!
My God died on the cross!
My God died on the cross!
My God died on the cross!
My God died on the cross!
My God died on the cross!
My God died on the cross!
