Cleaned up this timber an plowed this ground
Raised those cattle in the sun and snow
Damned that river and dug that coal
It's a debt we owe to the hands of a workin' man
Now my ganddad had 'em and my daddy does too
Back home there ain't much else to do
You put food on th stable and you fill up the tank
Pay what you owe to the boys at the bank
Live another day thanks to the hands of a workin' man
Workin' hard from the sun up to the sun down
They can build it tall, they can tear it on down
They got the know-how if you've got the money
Hit you hard as a hammer if you pick a fight
But they'd rather hold a pretty girl tight tonight
They're the rough and dirty, strong and sturdy
Hands of a workin' man
Now the hands of a workin' man look kind of funny
Stickin' outta white shirt sleeves on Sunday
They're more at home holdin' a rod and a reel
Nine pound hammer or a steering wheel
There's leather and steel in the hands of a Workin' man
Workin' hard from the sun up to the sun down
They can build it tall, they can tear it on down
They got the know-how if you've got the money
Hit you hard as a hammer if you pick a fight
But they'd rather hold a pretty girl tight tonight
They're the rough and dirty, strong and sturdy
Hands of a workin' man
Rough and hard, scuffed and scarred
From the front lines to the old freight yards
We have what we have
'Cause they are the way they are
Workin' hard from the sun up to the sun down
They can build it tall, they can tear it on down
They got the know-how if you've got the money
Hit you hard as a hammer if you pick a fight
But they'd rather hold a pretty girl tight tonight
They're the rough and dirty, strong and sturdy
