Was it really seven years ago?
Probably my favorite memory of you
Is kissin' at the bus stop in the snow
But the roses that we planted in our front yard
Are bloomin' now in someone else's vase
Thought I could stick around, but it's just too hard
I need to find a different dream to chase
So with the Kansas City sunrise in my rearview
I'm headed west on 35 to Wichita
After wantin' so long to be near you
Freedom feels a little like free fall
But I've done all my cryin'
Now I'm out here flyin' down the road
With my hand out in the wind
And the Kansas City sunrise
Inspirin' me to start over again
Well it hit me hard wakin' up without you
This mornin' in the dark before the dawn
I lay there for a long time thinkin' 'bout you
Couldn't seem to move, much less move on
But then the light came stealin'
Through the window with the feelin'
That the city had swept its stages clean
And if this old town can do it
I knew I should get to it
So I'm startin' out a brand new scene

With my hand out in the wind
And the Kansas City sunrise
Inspirin' me to start over again
With the Kansas City sunrise in my rearview
I'm headed west on 35 to Wichita
The fact that I'm still breathin' makes it clear you Weren't the reason I live after all
But I've done all my cryin'
Now I'm out here flyin' down the road
With my hand out in the wind
And the Kansas City sunrise
Inspirin' me to start over again
Yeah I'm startin' my new life by the light
