A high roller in a hurry I reckon
Drivin' like that, he's gonna end up upside down
I shake my head as he flies by my Chevy
Hasn't he ever heard about slow and steady
I'll still be runnin' strong when his luck runs out
I'm a slow roller, steady at the wheel
Not a smoke blower, honey I keep it real
I'm a tested and true blue type you can trust
Not a need it now, burn it out man in a rush
I'm a long kisser, 'cause life is too short
And a coffee sipper with a wrap around porch
Whatever comes my way, honey, I take it in stride
Thank God I've got a girl who likes takin' a ride with her
Slow roller
She likes an old slow country song playin'
Fingers intertwined and her body swayin' with mine
When it feels that good, why wouldn't you take your time?
Baby I'm a slow roller, steady at the wheel
Not a smoke blower, honey I keep it real
I'm a tested and true blue type you can trust
Not a need it now, burn it out man in a rush
I'm a long kisser, 'cause life is too short
And a coffee sipper with a wrap around porch
Whatever comes my way, honey, I take it in stride
Thank God I've got a girl who likes takin' a ride with her
Slow roller

Not a show boater who might blow the whole deal
I'm a tested and true blue type you can trust
Not a need it now, burn it out man in a rush
I'm a long kisser, 'cause life is too short
And a coffee sipper with a wrap around porch
Whatever comes my way, honey, I take it in stride
Thank God I've got a girl who likes
Takin' this ride with her Slow Roller
