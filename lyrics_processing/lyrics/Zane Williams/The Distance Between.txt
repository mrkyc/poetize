About the kind of man that one day I'd grow up to be
I wanted to change the world, I wanted to love someone
I found out both of those things are easier said than done
Ain't it funny how the time goes by?
Ain't it funny how you never win a game you never try?
And even when you try, there ain't no easy way
To rise above the past that led you where you are today
I've got a head full of dreams, that I don't want to forget
I'm always on my way, but I'm never quite there yet
I'm tired of seeing the distance between the man in my mirror
And the man I want to be
I guess I always have known wrong from right
I see them both as clear as day when I turn out the light
So why are they so far away in the morning when I rise
To live out another wasted day and another compromise
I've got a head full of dreams, that I don't want to forget
I'm always on my way, but I'm never quite there yet
I'm tired of seeing the distance between the man in my mirror
And the man I want to be
Why is it so hard to do the thing I know is right?
Why does every day bring one more demon that I have to fight?
You might also likeIt'd sure be nice to finally make a change
I guess only time will tell if I've got what it takes
Yeah, but even if I don't, I'll try it anyway
It's not like I had anything else to do today
I've got a head full of dreams, that I don't want to forget
I know I need to, I just haven't done it yet
And I'm crossing the distance that
Lies in between the man in my mirror
