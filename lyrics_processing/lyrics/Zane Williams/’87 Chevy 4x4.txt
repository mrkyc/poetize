With a sign sayin' $3500 OBO
I had just enough saved up from the summer
After I talked him down a coupla hundred
I remember it well I was ridin' high
When I drove you to the lake that starry night
Took a little detour through an open field
Our first taste of how freedom feels in an
87 Chevy four by four
Singin' oooh baby they don't make 'em like that anymore
Goin' where we'd never been before in an
87 Chevy four by four
Life is a play and that truck was our stage
We were fallin in love, we were coming of age
Sneakin' off after the football games
Tearin' up the back roads every time it rained
Do you remember that night we got stuck
And you lost a high heel down in the mud
How about that little canyon down in Big Bend
Watchin' the sun sinkin' below the rim in that
87 Chevy four by four
Singin' oooh baby they don't make 'em like that anymore
Goin' where we'd never been before in an
87 Chevy four by four

Everything changes in the blink of an eye
10 years now it's been sittin' out back
Under an old tarp by the firewood stack
A little TLC will get 'er runnin' again
We're comin' up on a long weekend, Baby
Whadya say you and me
Find a way to break free again in an
87 Chevy four by four
Singin' oooh baby they don't make 'em like this anymore
Goin' where we've never been before in an
87 Chevy four by four
87 Chevy four by four
Singin' oooh baby they don't make 'em like this anymore
Let's go where we've never been before in an
87 Chevy four by four
