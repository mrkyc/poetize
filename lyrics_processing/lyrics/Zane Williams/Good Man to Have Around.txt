He drives an old Ford Bronco with a toolbox in the back
When it comes to fixin' engines well I guess he's got the knack
Good with his hands and he don't mind gettin' dirty
If a lady gets stranded he can get there in a hurry

If it's broken he's got the tools
If it's smokin' he keeps his cool
All the ladies call him when they're breakin' down
They say ooh that's a good man to have around

Well if it's flat he can jack it
If it's cracked he can patch it
If it's runnin' kinda rough and kickin' up a racket
He can lube it up, tune it up, get her runnin' good
'Til she purrs like a kitten when he's underneath the hood

If it's broken he's got the tools
If it's smokin' he keeps his cool
All the ladies call him when they're breakin' down
They say ooh that's a good man to have around
(Good man, he's a good man)

Well if it's gettin' overheated and the temp is in the red
He's got just what she's needin' right back there in his bed
If she can't get it started and she's hittin' rock bottom
He'll slide up underneath until solves that problem

If it's broken he's got the tools
If it's smokin' he keeps his cool
All the ladies call him when they're breakin' down
They say ooh that's a good man to have around
(He's a good man, he's a good man)
(He's a good man, he's a good man)
(He's a good man, a good man to have around)

Well if it's stripped he can drill it
If it's empty he can fill it
If it's under ten minutes ma'am he won't even bill it
Front end, rear end, body work too
There ain't a whole lot that handy man can't do

If it's broken he's got the tools
If it's smokin' he keeps his cool
All the ladies call him when they're breakin' down
They say ooh that's a good man to have around
(Good, good, good, good man, yes he is)
