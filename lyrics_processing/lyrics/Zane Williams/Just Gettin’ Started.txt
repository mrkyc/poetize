Never leave you broken-hearted
Gonna love you Baby like a lady ought to be
Give me every little piece of your broken heart
Every little bruise and battle scar
I'm gonna make 'em all a memory
This ain't a first time love
Ain't a one-time buzz
I'm strong enough to take you all the way
Baby put your hand in mine
We'll stand the test of time
Build a better life day by day by day
And you know what the best part is
I'm just gettin' started
I'm gonna spin you, win you, kiss you, hug you, Place no other miss above you
I'm gonna you up right
When we're snuggled up tight
You'll never have to worry 'bout where I am
Never have to wonder where I stand
I'll be standin' right by your side
This ain't a first-time love
Ain't a one-time buzz
I'm strong enough to take you all the way
Baby put your hand in mine
We'll stand the test of time
Build a better life day by day by day
And you know what the best part is
I'm just gettin' started
