Good to know ya. Glad you came
Where you from now? Is that right?
What brings you all the way to Texas tonight?
Well, yeah you heard right
We got a scene that's rock n roll mixed with western swing
You wanna hear it? Alright
I gotta say you're in the right place tonight
'Cause what we got here's a honky tonk situation
Cold beer and a hot band playin'
Don't worry, I'll get you through
Just do exactly what I tell you to do
It's two steps left, and one step to the right
Once you get it down, you can do it all night
And take a pretty girl out on the floor
Then you'll know what God made these old honky tonks for
I'd buy a Lonestar or maybe a Shiner
And tip your waitress, that's a friendly reminder
Keep your beer close so it don't end up
Being some good ole boy's spit cup
Now we're awful proud of our Texas daughters
They can dance to George Strait or Randy Rogers
Fire up the tunes and here they come
Come on ladies, won't you show us how it's done

Perfume and a little perspiration
Don't worry, I'll get you through
Just do exactly what I tell you to do
It's two steps left, and one step to the right
Once you get it down, you can do it all night
And take a pretty girl out on the floor
Then you'll know what God made these old honky tonks for
Well loosen up now and just have a good time
Texas ain't just a state, it's a state of mind
One of these girls just might take you home
If you get that far, man, you're on your own
'Til the next time
You get yourself in a honky tonk situation
Hormones mixed with intoxication
Don't worry I'll get you through
Just do exactly what I tell you to do
It's two steps left, and one step to the right
Once you get it down, you can do it all night
And take a pretty girl out on the floor
