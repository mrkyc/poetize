Finally got over that song of ours
Stopped chasin' little red sports cars
To check the license plates
And back wood drivin' by your place
Back makin' the rounds at our old haunts
Honky Tonks, restaurants
And seein' some of our old friends
It feels good to dance again
And I can finally smell your perfume
And not look around the room for you
And I can walk right by your picture in a frame
And not feel a thing, but when I hear your name

I feel rain falling right out of the blue sky
And it's the fifth of May and I'm right there staring in your eyes
And nothing's change and we're still the same
And I get lost in the innocence of a first kiss
And I'm hanging onto every word running off of your lips
And that's all it takes and I'm in that place
Every time I hear your name

Got someone special in my life
Everyone thinks she'd make a great wife
Dad says he thinks she's the one
Reminds him of Mom when she was young
But it's way too soon to be talking 'bout rings
Don't wanna rush into anything
She's getting over someone too
Dinda like me and you
And she talks about him every once in a while
And I just nod my head an' smile
'Cause I know exactly what she's goin' through
Yeah, I've been there too
And when the conversation turns to you
You might also like
I get caught in a "you were the only one for me"
Kinda thought, and your face is all that I see
I know I can't go back when I still go back
And there we are, a point down by the riverside
And I'm in your arms about to make love for the first time
And that's all it takes, and I'm in that place
Every time I hear your name

So I'm thinkin' 'bout the words I left unsaid
(Every time I hear your name)
Stop tryin' to change the things I can't change
(Every time I hear your name)
In my heart, I know you're gone, but in my head

I feel rain falling right out of the blue sky
And it's the fifth of May and I'm right there staring in your eyes
That's all it takes and I'm in that place
And there we are, a point down by the riverside
And I'm in your arms about to make love for the first time
And I can't explain, but I'm in that place
Every time I hear your name

Every time I hear your name
(Every time I hear your name)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
(Every time I hear your name)
