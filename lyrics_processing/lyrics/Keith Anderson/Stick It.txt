An' her number in Maybelline black eye liner
Written on a napkin in my back pocket
She found it right there right before she washed it
Well, I started back-steppin', stumblin', stutterin'
Tellin' her where I'd been an' how she was just a friend
She said: "You know I know that ain't the truth
"But if that's the story you're stickin' to."
Well, you can stick it where the sun don't shine
Gonna take her advice an' hitch me a ride
We'll drive back to that waterin' hole
Where the cold beer flows an' the Cuervo's gold...
Suck a little salt 'n lime, (Suck a little salt 'n lime.)
Under that neon light
Gonna take my sorry behind
An stick it where the sun don't shine
Have me a good time
Got a call from Woodrow
"Hey, bro, you're wardrobe's throwed all over the lawn."
"There's a lot of black smoke comin' from your bass boat
"An' your ol' lady's cussin' an' a-carryin' on."
So I told Woodrow: "Put her on the cell 'phone."
He said: "I can't bro, she's got me in a choke hold
"Doin' that tie, bro, I think she broke my elbow."
"Hello? Woodrow? Hello?
"Oh, is that you, baby? Do what?"

Gonna take her advice an' stay all night

An stick it where the sun don't shine

Hey, bartender, want you to pour me another one
An' make it real strong
(She said: "Stick it where the sun don't shine.")
(I'm gonna take her advice an' stay all night.)
I bet ol' Woodrow should be here any minute now
He's gonna need one too
(Sit back down at this waterin' hole,)
(Where the cold beer flows an' the Cuervo's gold...)
Ah hell, just bring me the whole bottle
Looks like I'm gonna be here a while
(She said: "Stick it where the sun don't shine.")
(I'm gonna take her advice an' stay all night.)
There's Woodrow now
Oh, damn man, that looks bad
(Sit back down at this waterin' hole,)
(Where the cold beer flows an' the Cuervo's gold...)
Whoo! Your elbow supposed to bend that way?
(She said: "Stick it where the sun don't shine.")
(I'm gonna take her advice an' stay all night.)
Hey brother, did you get all my clothes?
I might need a place to stay to stay for a while
(Sit back down at this waterin' hole,)
(Where the cold beer flows an' the Cuervo's gold...)
She's damn tough, ain't she?
Stick it where the sun don't shine
