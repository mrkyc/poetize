Livin' in cars 'n parkin' lots
A good hot meal an' a place to sleep
Are things you miss when you're chasin' dreams
Playin' bars for tips in a jar
Middle of nowhere County Fairs
Talent shows, rodeos... any old stage with a microphone
For a chance to sing, I'd do anything
An' it feels like I've lost everything
I just gotta believe it's down that road somewhere
'Cause I'll know when I get there, yeah
Callin' cards in old payphones
Momma cries: "When you comin' home
"Do you need any money? Are you sure?
"Are you eatin' well? Are you goin' to Church?"
"GAC, CMT...
"We still ain't seen you on TV
"We keep turnin' on that radio
"Still wantin' to hear them songs you wrote
"Dad wants to know all the stars you met
"Do you ever see Dolly? Are you famous yet?"
I just say: "Momma, keep me in your prayers...
"And I'll know when I get there."
I don't know if it's worth it
And I don't know if I'm good enough
All I know is I'm givin' it all I've got
And I'll know when I get there

Are things you miss when you're chasin' dreams
It's hard to tell just where you're at
When you're lookin' for somethin' that ain't on a map
I just gotta believe it's down that road somewhere
