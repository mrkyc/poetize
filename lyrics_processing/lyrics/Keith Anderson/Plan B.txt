An' I heard that the wedding was nice
Well, it happened kinda sudden
Hey, but true love doesn't have to think about them kinda things twice
Now you got your man an' right on your hand is that 2.2 Marquis
Now for me, it looks like Plan B
Well, I won't say the news didn't shock me
That it didn't kinda take me by surprise
'Cause you'd headed out west to find yourself
An' you found yourself some guy
Now you'd always said that we'd be wed by the time you were twenty-three
Now for me, it looks like Plan B
Well, I gotta be strong, I gotta be tough
Gotta believe that I'm man enough
To chalk it all up to "it never was meant to be"
Yeah, it's gonna be hard but I've gotta begin
To dust off my dreams an' dream 'em again
'Cause I've gotta crazy to think you still love me...
(Ahhh.)
So that means just me and old Plan B
Well, at first I thought: "Hell, it doesn't matter
"I'd give it a year at best."
But then somebody told me you were startin' to show
An' they had to let out your weddin' dress
Hell, man I can hear that door slam from LA all the way to Big D
Leavin' me with ol' Plan B, yeah

Gotta believe that I'm man enough
To chalk it all up to "it never was meant to be"
Yeah, it's gonna be hard but I've gotta begin
To dust off my dreams an' dream 'em again
'Cause I gotta crazy to think you still love me...
(Ahhh.)
So that means just me and old Plan B
Yeah, that means it's just me an' ol' Plan B
Plan B
Oh, Goodbye
