Been waitin' at these crossroads
Forever and a day
On a guy to buy my soul
I spend all night and day
How much harder can I play?
You know I gave my life to rock n' roll
Here we go

Mama begged me please
Yes, she got down on her knees
Said "you'll burn in that Mississippi sun"
But I'm the only one that's standing here
So mama don't you have no fear
I'm either last or I've already won
Here I go

Take me down
Take me down
Take me down
Won't you take me down

Standing at the crossroads
A dried up pen in hand
The conversation went like this
"Tell me your desire why you pulled me from the fire and we'll seal the deal with a kiss"
Said "I wanna raise the dead
Find a note that I can shred
On my walls I scrawl my gods
Don't care what happens when I die
As long as I'm alive
All I wanna do is rock, rock, rock"

Oh, sign with the devil, sign with the devil, sign with the devil Oh!
Sign with the devil, sign with the devil, sign with the devil
Oh!
Sign with the devil, sign with the devil, sign with the devil
Oh!
Sign with the devil, sign with the devil, sign with the devil
Oh!

Take me down
Take me down
Take me down
Won't you take me down

Take me down
(Sign with the devil, sign with the devil, sign with the devil)
Take me down
(Sign with the devil, sign with the devil, sign with the devil, oh)
Won't you take me down
(Sign with the devil, sign with the devil, sign with the devil)
