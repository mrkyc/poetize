Every day I wake up
Every day I wake up alone
Every day I wake up
Every day I wake up alone

Let me open up the discussion with I'm not impressed with any motherfucking word I say
See I lied that I cried when he came inside and now I'm burning a highway to Hades
Shut the fuck up when I'm trying to think
I got to keep my concentration, give me one more drink
And then I'll try to remember all the advice that my good book told me
And all the lost souls say...

Every day I wake up
Every day I wake up alone
Kill me, just kill me, or get me out of the sun
Every day I wake up
Every day I wake up alone
Kill me, just kill me, someone get me out of the sun

Drugs, bars, backseats of cars, blowing boys, what a boring life I've led so far
Just a prime thirteen when I rode his machine
Tried to keep my body dirty and my eyes closed and clean
So with a wink and a smile and a vial of meth
I took his hand and we walked through the shadow of death
And then I try to remember all the advice that my teacher told me
And all the lost souls say...

Every day I wake up
Every day I wake up alone
Kill me, just kill me, or get me out of the sun
Every day I wake up
Every day I wake up alone
Kill me, just kill me, and get me out of the sun
Someone get me out of the sun
Someone get me out of the sun

Deep, deeper, deeper inside
Pull the wool nice and tight so that it covers your eyes
Can't find a God, a love, a Jesus, a father
I don't even care that much so why do I even bother?
So let me just end how I was gonna begin
Don't waste your time waiting cause I'm going back in
Now if I could just remember all the advice that my mother told me
And all the - and all the lost souls say...

Every day I wake up
Every day I wake up alone
Kill me, just kill me, or get me out of the sun
Every day I wake up
Every day I wake up alone
Kill me, just kill me, just get me out of the sun
Kill me, just kill me, someone get me out of the sun
