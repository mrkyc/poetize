Hey there, Father, I don't wanna bother you
But I've got a sin to confess
I'm just sixteen if you know what I mean
Do you mind if I take off my dress?
Don't know where to start, let me get to the good parts
Might wanna cross up your legs
I've got envy, I've got greed, anything that you need
And I'm not above having to beg

There was this boy who tore my heart in two
I had to lay him eight feet underground

All I need is someone to save me
'Cause I am goin' down
And what I need is someone to save me
'Cause I am goin' down, all the way down

Well, hey there, Father, there is just one other thing
I have a simple request
I hear you know God, could you give him a nod in my direction?
I would be in your debt
Perhaps there is something that we could work out
I noticed your breathing is starting to change
We could go in the back behind all these stacks of bibles
And get out of this cage
You might also like
There was this boy who tore my heart in two
I had to lay him eight feet underground

All I need is someone to save me
'Cause I am goin' down
And what I need is someone to save me
'Cause I am goin' down, all the way down

I didn't wanna do it, Father
But I caught him with another woman in the bed I made him
So I put him in a grave
And now there's no one left around to get me off
When I want, it's a drag (What a drag)
The next day on the television
They identified him by the circumcision that I made
And now I'm on the run, but wait
Why did I have to go and kill him when he was the best I'd ever had?

All I need is someone to save me
'Cause I am goin' down
And what I need is somethin' to save me
'Cause I am goin' down, all the way down
I'm goin' down
