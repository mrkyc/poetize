One, two
One, two, three

Well, here comes trouble
Screaming at midnight
Yeah, a lone wolf rider
Raised up on hell
I treat a man with a devil's hand
Ain't got no use for rules
He just takes me down

I'll take your last daughter
Throw you out the door
I'll kick you in the teeth, girl
And she'll come back for more

Hell-bent, no Mr. Clean
You got a good girl mean, oh

He's rotten to the core
When he arrives, you're gonna feel it
Rotten to the core
Lie after lie, you'll hear it
He'll take you to the limit, push you off the top
You'll never get enough of what that boy has got for her
Oh, it just takes me down
You might also like
Howling at a fast turn
Yeah, he'll run you over
He's a lawman's rival
Who's gonna steal your daughter

You can't hide from the devil inside
He never rides for free, oh

He's rotten to the core
When he arrives, you're gonna feel it
Rotten to the core
Lie after lie, you'll hear it
He'll take you to the limit, push you off the top
You'll never get enough of what that boy has got for her
Oh, it just takes me down

Ha-ha, here I come, just a-creepin' around
Picking up the dirt and tearing it down
My greasy hands are never satisfied
The bat overhead, she'll have 'em all tied

Rotten to the core
When he arrives, you're gonna feel it
Rotten to the core
Lie after lie, you'll hear it
Rotten to the core
You might die, but don't fear it
He'll take you to the limit, push you off the top
You'll never get enough of what that boy has got, yeah
He's rotten to the core
He's rotten to the core
