It creeps all over you
Like a dull ache
Think of all the things
Your hands could make
It pulls you to the ground
Like soaking wet clothes
The change in your face
When anger shows

In that moment, you realise that
Something you thought would
Always be there will die
Like everything else

These thoughts I must not think of
Dreams I can't make sense of
I need you to tell me it's okay
These thoughts I must not think of
Dreams I can't make sense of
I need you to tell me it's okay

You are a sleeping lion in your bed
I will not wake you
You're the moment love has passed
We all must learn to hate you
You're a memory from before
Please don't let me forget you
You're the wolves at my door
