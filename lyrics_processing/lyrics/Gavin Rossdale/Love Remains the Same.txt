A thousand times I've seen you standing
Gravity like a lunar landing
Make me want to run 'til I find you
I shut the world away from here
Drift to you, you're all I hear
Everything we know fades to black

Half the time the world is ending
Truth is I am done pretending

I never thought that I had any more to give
Pushing me so far
Here I am without you
Drink to all that we have lost
Mistakes we have made
Everything will change
But love remains the same

Find the place where we escape
Take you with me for the space
The city buzz, it sounds just like a fridge
I walk the streets through seven bars
I had to find just where you are
The faces seem to blur, they're all the same
You might also like
Half the time the world is ending
Truth is I am done pretending

I never thought that I had any more to give
Pushing me so far
Here I am without you
Drink to all that we have lost
Mistakes we have made
Everything will change
But love remains the same

So much more to say
So much to be done
Don't you trick me out
We shall overcome
So all have stayed in place
We should've had the sun
Could've been inside
'Stead, we're over here

Half the time the world is ending
Truth is I am done pretending
Too much time, too long defending
You and I have done pretending
I never thought that I had any more to give
Pushing me so far
Here I am without you
Drink to all that we have lost
Mistakes we have made
Everything will change
Everything will change

I, oh, I, I wish this could last forever
I, oh, I, as if we could last forever
Love remains the same
