Too much is not enough
Nobody said this stuff
Makes any sense
We're hooked again
The point of no return
See how the buildings burn
Light up the night
Such a pretty sight
Adrenaline keeps me in the game
Adrenaline, you don't even feel the pain
Wilder than your wildest dreams
When you're going to extremes
It takes adrenaline
You don't feel the pain
Sail through an empty night
It's only you and I
Who understand
There is no plan
Get closer to the thrill
Only time can kill
It's in your eyes
They're so alive

Adrenaline, you don't even feel the pain
Wilder than your wildest dreams
When you're going to extremes
It takes adrenaline
Run through the speed of sound
Everything slows you down
And all color that surrounds you
Are bleeding to the walls
All the things you really need
Just wait to find the speed
Then you will achieve
Escape velocity
Too much is not enough
Nobody gave it up
I'm not the kind
To lay down and die
Adrenaline keeps me in the game
Adrenaline, you don't even feel the pain
Wilder than your wildest dreams
When you're going to extremes
It takes adrenaline
Adrenaline, screaming out your name
Adrenaline, you don't even feel the pain
Wilder than your wildest dreams
When you're going to extremes
It takes adrenaline (adrenaline)

I'm going to extremes
There's nothing in between
You don't even feel the pain
