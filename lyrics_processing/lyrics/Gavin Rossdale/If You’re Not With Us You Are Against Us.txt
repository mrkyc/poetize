I love you now but I've loved you not
I am the runaway that turned to dust
I just hope to find a way to keep it together
Shocks me how we beat the weather
Too much time done on fighting
Ocean, fields of dying
There's no need to be afraid
Remedy is on its way
Into the night we go again, yeah
Brain freeze if you are against us
Brain freeze if you think you can take us
Brain freeze if you think you can beat us
If you're not with us you are against us
We have human rights and too many wrongs
It's so damn hard since you been gone
There be those that give and those that take
What I have for you please don't break
I need you now more than before
As I look around I see strangers more
There's no need to be afraid
Serotonin is on its way
Into the night we go again, yeah
You might also likeBrain freeze if you are against us
Brain freeze if you think you can take us
Brain freeze if you think you can beat us
If you're not with us you are against us
Brain freeze if you are against us
Brain freeze if you think you can take us
Brain freeze if you think you can beat us
If you're not with us you are against us
So we roll into tomorrow
And dumb regrets still make you hollow
Colors in the mirror
Every day, yeah, is getting clearer, oh!
If you're not with us, if you're not with us
Not with us you are against us
If you're not with us you are against us
Brain freeze if you are against us
Brain freeze if you think you can take us
Brain freeze if you think you can beat us
If you're not with us then you are against us
Brain freeze if you are against us
Brain freeze if you think you can take us
Brain freeze if you think you can beat us
If you're not with us then you are against us
If you're not with us then you are against us
Brain freeze, brain freeze
