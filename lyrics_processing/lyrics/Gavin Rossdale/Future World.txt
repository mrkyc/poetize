You don't care just how you rip me up?
Oh, tear drop you know you make me so sad
This heartbeat could be my last
Jesus wants to save me
But the devil just makes me do it again
It's a future world, the questions and answers
Some things can't be explained, got to take your chances
It's a future world of fire line cables
A gift to you while I am able
There is a girl who says she loves me
But I got worry on both my arms
I got this razor but it just cuts me up
I want to look better but I feel worse
I jump in the ocean but my head comes up
Just as a wave breaks
It's a future world, the questions and answers
Some things can't be explained, you got to take your chances
It's a future world of hard wire cables
I run to you, I run for ages
You might also likeYou will never get it, die for you
I know there's pain in everything we do
Hamburgers so that we stay alive
Happy meals means something died, woah
It's a future world, questions and answers
Some things can't be explained
It's a future world of fire line cables
I give to you while I am able
It's a future world, questions and answers
Some things can't be explained, you got to take your chances
It's a future world of hard wire cables
I run to you, I run for ages
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
I got to get myself back
I got to get myself, woah
It's a future world
It's a future world
It's a future world
That I give to you while I am able
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
And I got to get myself back
And I got to get myself, woah
