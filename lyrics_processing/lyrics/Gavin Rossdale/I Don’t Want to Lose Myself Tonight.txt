I left town
17 reasons
Did it all
Speeding
She likes fast cars
I like her fast smile
Streets are pretty
When they're all wide
Don't cross the road
Without thinking
Cause traffic can be vicious
And it rains
It's a wonder it ever stops
If there's a black sheep
Maybe i've seen it
I tried but failed to see
The writing on the ceiling
There's too much fighting
It does the world in
But you got to fight long before you give in
You might also likeI don't want to lose myself tonight
I don't want to be reminded
(keep your head up)
She gives me everything and more
(keep your head up)
She's my silver lining
Got a heart broke
Just like you
She's done it all
In her electric groves
Another package
From the FedEx man
Don't ring a bell
I'm in slumber land
If there's a black sheep
Maybe i've seen it
I tried but failed to see
The writing on the ceiling
There's too much fighting
It does the world in
But you got to fight long before you give in
I don't want to lose myself tonight
I don't want to be reminded
