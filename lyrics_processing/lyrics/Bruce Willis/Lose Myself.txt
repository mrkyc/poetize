Thanks for the light
How long are you in town for?
Just for the night?
Do you need a place to stay?
Have you heard these lines before?
Then you probably understand
What it is I'm lookin' for
I wanna lose myself in love tonight
Till I can't walk straight, till I'm really high
It's written on your face, you need it too
I wanna lose myself in love with you
All right chill, chill, you don't have to answer me
But let me ask you, "What's got you on the run?"
It's like your mind's on somethin' else
Or some place, or someone
I can sense just what you're feelin', baby
'Cause I feel it in myself
You wanna go so far, so far gone
That you feel like someone else
I wanna lose myself in love tonight
Till I can't walk straight, till I'm really high
It's written on your face, you need it too
I wanna lose myself in love with you
You might also likeI wanna lose myself in love tonight
Till I can't walk straight, till I'm really high
It's written on your face, you need it too
I wanna lose myself in love with you
I made some bad mistakes
Things I really regret
And there's only one thing
Gonna help me forget
I wanna lose myself in love tonight
Till I can't walk straight, till I'm really high
It's written on your face, you need it too
I wanna lose myself in love with you
I wanna lose myself in love tonight
Till I can't walk straight, till I'm really high
It's written on your face, you need it too
I wanna lose myself in love with you
I wanna lose myself in love tonight
Till I can't walk straight, till I'm really high
It's written on your face, you need it too
