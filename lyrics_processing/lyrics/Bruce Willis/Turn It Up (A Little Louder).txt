Done work, Hot night
Last thing that I needed was a fight
Summertime, I feel loose
I crack another bottle of cactus juice
The boys are comin' over
And it is lookin' like they're ready to jam
I'm hopin' we don't have no trouble with my neighbor Sam
Turn it up a little louder
Crank the speakers
Grab a beer
Turn it up a little louder
We ain't got nothin' to fear
Turn it up a little louder, yeah
Until the cops get here
Midnight, Oh no!
The chickens just arrived
We got a show
No phone, No food
We're tearin' down the ceilin' for kindlin' wood
The duke is in the kitchen
Talkin' 'bout a chick that he boned
Young William's in the back room
He wonderin' why he's all alone
You might also likeTurn it up a little louder
Put the speakers by the door
Turn it up a little louder
Get some wimmens on the floor
Turn it up a little louder, yeah
That's what you're neighbors are for
You said you don't like my style
They way I'm living is way too wild
It's only a party you're welcome to come
What's the use of living if you can't have fun
Jumpin' up and down on the TV at five AM
The neighbors keep a knockin'
The volume's tunned up way past ten
Big Johnny by the pool, sippin' on a hurricane
Carmine's in the backroom
He foolin' with the Cuban again
Turn it up a little louder
Put the speakers by the door
Turn it up a little louder
Get some wimmens on the floor
Turn it up a little louder, yeah
That's what you're neighbors are for
Turn it up a little louder
Crank the speaker
Grab a beer
Turn it up a little louder
We ain't got nothin' to fear
Turn it up a little louder, yeah
