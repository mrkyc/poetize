See, I don't know why I liked you so much
I gave you all, of my trust
I told you, I loved you, now that's all down the drain
Ya put me through pain, I want to let you know how I feel

Fuck all those kisses, they didn't mean jack
Fuck you, you hoe, I don't want you back
Fuck what I said it don't mean shit now
