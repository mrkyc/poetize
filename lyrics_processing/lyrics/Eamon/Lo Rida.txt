Yeah, its like 2-30 in the mornin
Just left the club, about to go to the after-hour
After-hour spot, ya gotta dig that
Over there, over there
Ya know how we do it
Get my lo rida, hit some switches
Yeah, yeah
Any highway from here to you
Ya know what i mean?
We gonna ride
Eamon, lets ride, eamon, yeah
Ya know what i'm sayin?
Lets ride, lo rida, come on!
(eamon)
Feelin high, gotta ride it
I take routes to ease my life
And there's no doubt i test my life
Still i , i step back, step back
And let the feelin take control
May be hard, may be soft
And what ya had might be lost
But i gotta, gotta
Not care what i'm goin through
You might also like(chorus)
The lovin and the huggin
The way i just can't stop buggin
The feedin and the schemin
The way i get when i'm weaken
(chorus 2)
Lo rida, can't get higha
All i gotta do now is calm that fire
Love makin, shit that i'm takin
All i gotta do now is calm that fire
Love makin, shit that i'm takin
Can't get enough of it
Yo its been sent to find my cost
And, you might think it's my loss
But i'm rollin, rollin to the illest place i know
Eyes are wide, insides hot
And nasty thoughts just won't stop
And i'm lovin, lovin everything that ya do to me
(chorus)
The lovin and the huggin
The way i just can't stop buggin
The feedin and the schemin
The way i get when i'm weaken
(chorus 2)
Lo rida, can't get higha
All i gotta do now is calm that fire
Love makin, shit that i'm takin
All i gotta do now is calm that fire
Love makin, shit that i'm takin
Can't get enough of it
(nore)
Ya see i never had a chick like this
We'd argue, she'd break out
Come back like this
She said she never had a pimp like this
And never seen a camouflage make like this
Suckin that lo rida
We on that cali slide
I'm the insider, we buffin
Takin the valley ride
I'm a provider and stay high up from tiger shots
We played wrestles before, nelsons and body shots
Oh, excited like we're, until we're "gatti bots"
Look at her booty, man, got me on body watch
She got a leather trench on now, with nothin under it
Just like when she on top and i'm under it
So i run with it, gotta have fun a bit
Ain't nothin like a hoeside, lo ride
New kicks, new whip
"sit safe" 0-5 nice eyes, thick thighs
Boy, she make my skin rise!
(chorus 2 x2)
Lo rida, can't get higha
All i gotta do now is calm that fire
Love makin, shit that i'm takin
All i gotta do now is calm that fire
Love makin, shit that i'm takin
Can't get enough of it
Lo rida, can't get higha
All i gotta do now is calm that fire
Love makin, shit that i'm takin
All i gotta do now is calm that fire
Love makin, shit that i'm takin
