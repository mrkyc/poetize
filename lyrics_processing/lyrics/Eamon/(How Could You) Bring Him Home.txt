I even flew home a day too soon, all because I couldn't wait to kiss you
Oh, how she will be loved
Was the one thing stuck in my mind
And how tonight would be, remembered for the rest of your life

I never thought that I'd do something like that
When I saw you two it hit me lika a heartattack
Oh no, how could you let somebody in through our door
How could you bring him home
I never thought I'd lose my temnper like that
Now it's a fucked up situation, he ain't coming back
Oh no, how could you please another man on our floor
How could you bring him home
I know you know I've passed on every girl because I thought I really loved you
And you know that I never put anyone or anything above you, because I loved you
And it was that love
That made me lose my head and now it's too late
One day too soon, you'll regret it for the rest of your days

I never thought that I'd do something like that
When I saw you two it hit me lika a heartattack
Oh no, how could you let somebody in through our door
How could you bring him home
You might also likeI never thought I'd lose my temper like that

Yeah yeah yeah
Oho oho ohooo

Please God forgive
Me for what I did
This day will stay for as long as I live
But if you walked in
And seen what I seen
I know any man would have done just the same 
Because I..

I never thought that I'd do something like that
When I saw you two it hit me lika a heartattack
Oh no, how could you let somebody in through our door
