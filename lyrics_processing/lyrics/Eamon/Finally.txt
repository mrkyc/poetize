Hop out of bed and i grab a bite
Rake up a fatty and roll it tight
Thinking what im gonna do tonight
New that she was feelin me
And i was feeling her like ecstasy
Next thing you know she was next to me
By the mornin time shes sexin me
Finally i can say
Everything today has gone my way
No problems, no hassels
Ive been smokin
Finally i can say
Everything today has gone my way
No problems, no hassels
Ive been fuckin
Check the mail box and i got my check
Sit back, relax as i sip my
Think about all the shit i can get
So i spend and spend
Till i think im set
Hit the club
And im feelin nice
Let me get the bottles in the ice
When i come through
You know Stanton's tight
Everyone i brought
Gets laid tonight
