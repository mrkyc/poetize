Monday, I been on that bum tip
Nothing left to live, nothing left to give
Tuesday, yet another blues day
Another bounced check deeper into debt
Wednesday, need about a million
Desperate thinking, robbing men, women and children
Thursday, try to make the most of it
24 hours to live and then it's over with

I see ya five foot something, cuter than a button, maybe you could pull me through
Girl I've been struggling, but Friday's coming
Tryna spend my last day with you

Before I die
Show me some love
Before I die (die! die!)
Show me some love

8 am, roll up outta bed
I ain't sleep at all, voices in my head
12 noon, get everybody covered
Call my sister, brother, father, mother tell her that I love her
8 pm, gotta fill my belly
Ain't been feeling food lately, peanut butter jelly
Midnight, get the gun in the city
'Cause I ain't going lone, these bloodsuckers coming with me

Broadway & 145th street, met my man P
Blessed me with a piece
Head Downtown, they trendy club imposters
Tight pants, name brands, eventually I'll spot'em
I ain't slept in weeks but everybody eatin'
Everybody slick 'till they feel slugs creep in
The Holy Ghost shoutin', got ya man doubtin'
Guts thrown up 'cause your man ain't about it
Check into the Golden Rail Motel
Saw the Gideon's & learned the devil ain't a fairy tale

I see ya five foot something, cuter than a button, maybe you could pull me through
Girl I've been struggling, but Friday's coming
Tryna spend my last day with you
Before I die
Show me some love
Before I die (die! die!)
Show me some love

When I die, just know I died with nothing left to give
