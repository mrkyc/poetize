Whoa, whoa, hey
Whoa, whoa, hey
(Ooh)
And, hey
Here I am at work and I
Gotta do my business so
Gotta take a ride
On the elevator to the seventh floor
There's this girl in the studio across from me
('Cross from me)
She's so fly and always a sight to see
('Ways a sight to see)
I'm so nervous, she's walkin' right behind me
And if she's comin' in here, I'ma lose it, more likely
I just take my time holdin' that door
So I can get to know her some more
So which floor you wanna go to?
Girl, I'll ride with you
Wanna go up, wanna go down
Whatever you wanna do
You might also likeCan't help but think about her
Makin' love to her
When I hear the music
(Hey, hey)
So which floor you wanna go to?
Shit, I'll ride with you
Wanna go up, wanna go down
Whatever you want to
Can't help but think about her
Things I'd do to her
When I hear the music
In the elevator
Conversation starts movin'
She says that
I'm new in town
Don't know my way around
So I told her, you come with me
I'ma show you some things
You never seen
In the city that never sleeps
While she's talkin'
I'm thinkin' in my head
When you get off of work
You comin' home with me instead
And I can keep it raw
I can take it slow
Gettin' what I want
Can't let this one go
So which floor you wanna go to?
Girl, I'll ride with you
Wanna go up, wanna go down
Whatever you wanna do
(Whoa, whoa)
Can't help but think about her
Makin' love to her
(Makin')
When I hear the music
(Hey, hey)
So which floor you wanna go to?
Shit, I'll ride with you
Wanna go up, wanna go down
Whatever you want to
Can't help but think about her
Things I'd do to her
(Whoa, whoa, whoa)
When I hear the music
In the elevator
What I'm feelin' is you're thinkin'
What I'm thinkin' you are hinting
Movin' closer, you could blow
(Blow my)
My mind, I'll take your body over
Don't get off when it stops
(Uh)
(So we could just ride)
(Yeah)
All the way to the top
(Hopin' we think alike)
Broke the ice 'cause she can get it
(She can get it)
Got me open, so I said
(And so I said)
Which floor you wanna go to?
Girl, I'll ride with you
(Ride with you)
Wanna go up, wanna go down
Whatever you wanna do
Can't help but think about her
Makin' love to her
(Makin')
When I hear the music
(Hey, hey)
So which floor you wanna go to?
Shit, I'll ride with you
(Ride)
Wanna go up, wanna go down
Whatever you want to
(You want to do)
Can't help but think about her
Things I'd do to her
(Oh, yes)
When I hear the music
In the elevator
In the elevator
(Ride with you)
(You wanna do)
In that elevator
When I'm in the elevator
Whoa, whoa, hey
(Ride with you)
Whoa, whoa, hey
(You want to)
Whoa, whoa, hey
(Ooh)
