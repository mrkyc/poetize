I may not be your man, baby
But you know I'm driving you crazy
That's why you'll fuck with me
For the rest of your life
I know you're lovin' the sex
Swallow it up, it's better than X
That's why you stuck with me
For the rest of your life

In your room, cryin' over bullshit
'Cause you know, only I could hit it
The way you like it, girl; it's been awhile
But you really can't tell, 'cause when we fuck
You know it's hot as hell
Don't be mad, be glad
That you got me, girl

You can't stand me
And you don't love me
But why do you keep
Calling me, girl?
You say 'cause you're bored
I am not so sure
My lips are shut
As long as yours stay open
You might also like
I may not be your man, baby
But you know I'm driving you crazy
That's why you'll fuck with me
For the rest of your life
I know you're lovin' the sex
Swallow it up, it's better than X
That's why you stuck with me
For the rest of your life

Rumors spread, that I don't act right
But I'm good when it's late at night
Pop that shit, I'm laughin'
It was love, now it's just make love
How I love, that I'm not enough
Do your thing, it's okay
'Cause you know I am

You can't stand me
And you don't love me
But why do you keep
Calling me, girl?
You say 'cause you're bored
I am not so sure
My lips are shut
As long as yours stay open
I may not be your man, baby
But you know I'm driving you crazy
That's why you'll fuck with me
For the rest of your life
I know you're lovin' the sex
Swallow it up, it's better than X
That's why you stuck with me
For the rest of your life

You don't love me
You don't trust me
Don't wanna be with me
You just wanna fuck with me
I don't love you
I don't like you
Don't wanna be with you
I just wanna fuck with you

I may not be your man, baby
But you know I'm driving you crazy
That's why you'll fuck with me
For the rest of your life
I know you're lovin' the sex
Swallow it up, it's better than X
That's why you stuck with me
