Its kinda of amazing but its true
Now that I'm needing
Someone so special
Here comes you
So how am i crazy?
They say that im dreaming over you
Someone so special
How could you say this?
Oh so cruel
So when you saying that you need love
I look at you and kinda smile
Its very hard just to convince you baby
So maybe this wil take awhile
Cause all that I wish for
Is just to be with you baby
With a little of a squeezin'
And a holdin' you close
Girl its driving me crazy
All over love (all over love)
All over love (all over love)
All over love (all over love)
All over love (all over love)

Lets make a relationship at last
Getting to know you
With nothing to owe you
So I ask
Lets keep this real simple
We know the material things won't last
Show me you love me
If anything's different then I'll pass
So when you say that you need love
I look at you and kinda smile
Its very hard just to convince you baby
So maybe this will take awhile
Cause all that I wish for
Is just to be with you baby
With a little of a squeezin'
And a holdin' you close
Girl its driving me crazy
All over love (all over love)
All over love (all over love)
All over love (all over love)
All over love (all over love)
Cause all that I wish for
Is just to be with you baby
With a little of a squeezin'
And a holdin' you close
Girl its driving me crazy
