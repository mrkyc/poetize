You don't know o
If your ass is fat
I can't help the way that I react
And that's that
If your ass is fat
Baby, there ain't
No need for you lookin' back
I'm staring that
If your ass is fat
I can't help the way that I react
Catch a heart attack
If your ass is fat
That's what I'm lookin' for
I'm standing here, lookin' out the window
Blowin' smoke, what did I see
I saw a fat ass
Walking up the block
Staring back at me, going crazy
So I hit the streets
Like a pimp bo tryna get that meat
You might also likeI don't give a fuck
I'll bring the heat, 'cause I don't
Want any and there's or buts
Just in your butt
If your ass is fat
I can't help the way that I react
And that's that
If your ass is fat
Baby, there ain't
No need for you lookin' back
I'm staring that
If your ass is fat
I can't help the way that I react
Catch a heart attack
If your ass is fat
That's what I'm lookin' for
Girl, you beter get that
Bubble bouncin', come on
Get that money when I yell sound off
Everybody up in the spot go
When I got a pen in your mouth
Treat these bitches like gators
'Cause I'm wearin' 'em out
Comin', comin' over your ass
To bust a load in your mouth
I got you chokin' while I'm tokin
And I'm smokin' an ounce
Go party with some poopy bitches
Bottys lookin' bottylicious
What up with your chunk
And your chunkin' lookin'truely vicious
You don't know what I'm thinkin'
You don't know what you're drinkin'
Life is fast, forget the past
'Cause I won't loose that fat fabulous piece of ass
You don't know what I'm thinkin
You don't know what you're drinkin'
Life is fast, forget the past
'Cause I won't loose that fat fabulous piece of ass
If your ass is fat
I can't help the way that I react
And that's that
If your ass is fat
Baby, there ain't
No need for you lookin' back
I'm staring that
If your ass is fat
I can't help the way that I react
Catch a heart attack
If your ass is fat
That's what I'm lookin' for
I need a dick to minikin', no for blackanors
Booty good cham for you to tag on
So mind me being a dominoe
When it comes to ass
The kids a basket case
A walkin' and talkin'
Sexual harrasment case
I'm gettin' more raz than toilet paper
In the ladies room
Research shows
I'm the reason the lastest baby boom
Maybe you should call me
The dad beat daddio
All I do is smoke weed
Get head and beat fatties
If your ass is fat
I can't help the way that I react
And that's that
If your ass is fat
Baby, there ain't
No need for you lookin' back
I'm staring that
If your ass is fat
I can't help the way that I react
Catch a heart attack
If your ass is fat
