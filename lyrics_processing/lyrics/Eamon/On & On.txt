On and on and on, On and on and on
Everytime I finish
I could see it in your eyes
I know I put in work
And there is no surprise
I got just what you're lookin' for
Yo I freak it like you like it
Then you want some more
Let's explore the bedroom floor
Over and over and over
(On and on and on, On and on and on)
On and on and on
(On and on and on, On and on and on
Over and over and over
(On and on and on, On and on and on)
On and on and on
(On and on and on, On and on and on)
Anytime you need me girl
You know I'm by your side
And I know that you know
That I can make it right
I feel just how you feel tonight
Let me do what I can do
To make the feelin' right
Hit the lights and let me ride
