Girl, I thank you for this wonderful night
Wishing I could see you one more time
But I don't think you will let me
So I thank you
If you wanna still fool around
You could come to the next town
But until then I gotta go
So I thank you
I love them ho's, love them ho's, love them ho's
I love them ho's, love them ho's, love them ho's
I love them ho's, love them ho's, love them ho's
I love them ho's
Looking sad, even though we just met
No need to get upset
But I got a show, gotta go, so I thank you
And if you wanna still get sexed down
You could catch the next Greyhound
But until then I gotta go, so I thank you
I love them ho's, love them ho's, love them ho's
I love them ho's, love them ho's, love them ho's
I love them ho's, love them ho's, love them ho's
I love them, I can't see anyone but you
You might also likeOoh damn, you know that I love them ho's

Ooh damn, you know that I love them ho's
I love them ho's
