You go, go tell your friends (your friends)
Tell them, get off my dick
They keep, tellin you shit
Go tell i said suck my dick
You could tell me this and that
I'll tell you plenty facts
Your friends are herbs, don't know what they saying
Friends front in front of me
Fucking wanna-be's, in your ear but they don't know eamon
Claiming that they seeing me, up in the industry
Acting fool, thinking that i'm playing
Your foolish for believing them
Girl if i'm your man, it's me or them
Thats what i'm saying
(chorus)
You go, go tell your friends (your friends)
Tell them, get off my dick
They keep, tellin' you shit
Go tell i said suck my dick
Bring on over all your friends
I'll put it to an end
In my face all the stories changing
I'll blow up all their spots
But i'd rather not
I'll let you see that they just hating
If i want, I got'em locked begging for my cock
Dead it now, watch how they'll be chasing
This is how i make it stop
I make it really hot
Forgot your friends, when we started mating

Tell them, get off my dick
They keep, tellin' you shit
Go tell i said suck my dick
(rap)
Everytime you say somethin
Bout what your girlfriends said
It makes me wanna punch you in your head
But instead, i say the same thing again
Don't listen to your friends
A yo they must be on my dick or somethin
They always talking alot of smack
But ain't saying nothing
They steady fronting everytime that i confront them
Common they just a bunch of hoe's
Swinging on the poles
Buying coke, then they sniffin it up in they nose
I guess you must be stupid
If you listening to them, it's a sin i suppose
Here's your last chance to make this choice
Then my mind is chose
It's me or the hoe's, case closed
You go, go tell your friends (your friends)
Tell them, get off my dick
They keep, tellin' you shit
