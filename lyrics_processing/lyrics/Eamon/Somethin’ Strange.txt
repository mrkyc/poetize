Ahhh yeahhh

I'm seeing something I ain't seen before, yeah
(Somethin', somethin' strange, somethin' strange, yeah)
Could it be your actin like a whore, yeah
(Somethin', somethin' strange, somethin' strange, yeah)

When I meet you everything seemed right
But the truth is you fucked on the first night
It sank in slow, now I know you're a ho
Yo I should've listened when my friends told me so
I thought this would last
But I realize that your just a piece of ass
I know your game, chicks are all the same
Your looking kinda funny and your actin kinda - strange

I'm seeing something I ain't seen before, yeah
(Somethin', somethin' strange, somethin' strange, yeah)
Could it be your actin like a whore, yeah
(Somethin', somethin' strange, somethin' strange, yeah)

I caught you in the club last week
You looked like a freak in the VIP
Sittin on laps, and suckin on necks
Actin like a slut cuz you tripin on X
I Fliped, I was gonna hurt her
Then my boy said CHILL over murder
I was feelin nice till my boy told me
He just saw da bitch bounce wit Milk Dee

Who me? MC am I
E, I didn't know that's your hoe, that's why
I, took her to the bathroom
I had her face in the bowl with a tight grip hold
Losing control when I hit it
I didn't have a clue, if I knew, she was you, I wouldn't have did it
That's my word
True clue, so fuck what you heard
It ain't no beef when it comes to a bird
Word

I'm seeing something I ain't seen before, yeah
(Somethin', somethin' strange, somethin' strange, yeah)
Could it be your actin like a whore, yeah
