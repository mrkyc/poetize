I wouldn't ask you to take care of me
Oh, and I wouldn't ask you to take care of me
I wouldn't ask you to take care of me
Oh, and I wouldn't ask you to take care of me
(I think I'm losing you)

Switchblade 'round my neck, don't get close to me
Ask about your life, still in the nosebleeds
Laying in your bed, call that intimacy
Wish I could get past the security
Wonder why I wake up living in a made-up
Dream of you and I, together there
Baby, wake the fuck up, time for you to grow up
Don't you know that life is rarely ever fair?

I wouldn't ask you to take care of me
Oh, and I wouldn't ask you to take care of me
I wouldn't ask you to take care of me
Oh, and I wouldn't ask you to take care of me

Tell you how I feel, I keep it real clean
Lock hanging 'round my neck, you don't get a key
Come a little closer, I'll show you what I mean
Oh, boy, you know it's all for me
Ice-cold, baby, I'm ice-cold
You're the only one who can make me fold
Ice-cold, baby, I'm ice-cold
You're the only one who can make me fold
You might also like
I wouldn't ask you to take care of me
Oh, I wouldn't ask you to take care of me
I wouldn't ask you to take care of me
Oh, I wouldn't ask you to take care of me
I wouldn't ask you to take care of me
Oh, I wouldn't ask you to take care of me
I wouldn't ask you to take care of me
Oh, I wouldn't ask you to take care of me

(Think I could be all you dreamed)
(Penthouse apartments, bars, limousines)
(Think I could make you believe)
(Be your Tinker Bell bitch, you can make me your queen)

I wouldn't ask you, baby
(Don't want to overstep my boundaries)
(But I want to get to know you, plant the seed)
I wouldn't ask you, baby
(Think I could be all you dreamed)
(Penthouse apartments, bars, limousines)
To be the one I love
To be the one I love, I love
We could be
We could be so strong (Ask you)
We'll be alright, we'll be alright
We could be so strong (Ask you)
We'll be alright, we'll be alright
We could be so strong (Ask you)
We'll be alright, we'll be alright

Caught me by surprise
Everything I need in my life
I wanna call you mine
I wanna be intertwined

We could be so strong (Ask you)
We'll be alright, we'll be alright
We could be so strong (Ask you)
We'll be alright, we'll be alright
We could be so strong (Ask you)
We'll be alright, we'll be alright

Feels like I've known you for so long
Without you, I don't feel strong
Feels like I've known you for so long
Without you, I don't feel so strong, yeah
So strong
