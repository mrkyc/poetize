Here comes the night
Once again
I'll be feeling lonely
Oh, if only things could work out like you plan
Where can love be
Tell me why it's so hard to find somebody
Who will stand by me
And take the time to understand
And show me love again

I want the real thing
Or nothing at all
I need someone that I can be sure will
Catch me if I should fall
Someone who'll be there when I call
Then I'll know that it's the real thing
I want the real thing
To warm me each night
Someone to love me over and over
Making the future bright
Somebody who will make it all right
Just give me the real thing

Where is the moon
Won't it smile
I'm just one more dreamer
Let your beams come down and fill my empty room
Here comes the night
But if there's still a chance that love can find me
I'll be here
Crossing my fingers
You might also like
I want the real thing
Or nothing at all
I need someone that I can be sure will
Catch me if I should fall
Someone who'll be there when I call
Then I'll know that it's the real thing
I want the real thing
To warm me each night
Someone to love me over and over
Making the future bright
Somebody who will make it all right

I wanna know for sure
That I can feel secure
Knowing I've found an everlasting love
Once I get that under control
Then I won't let go


I want the real thing
Or nothing at all
I need someone that I can be sure will
Catch me if I should fall
Someone who'll be there when I call
Then I'll know that it's the real thing
I want the real thing
To warm me each night
Someone to love me over and over
Making the future bright
Somebody who will make it all right
