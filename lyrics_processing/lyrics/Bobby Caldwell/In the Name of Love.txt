How many times do we have to jump back in the fire
To discover what I know is true?
That I only want to be with you
And how many times do we have to break down to go higher?
Maybe lovers have to fuss and fight
And the things they do can be so trite

Round and round we go, kind of like a hurricane
Stormy winds may blow, we can take the weather
Everybody knows, Rhett and Scarlett did the same
We've gotta remember, it's all in the name of love
Facing odds that pull us apart
Sometimes we end up breaking each other's hearts
We've gotta be strong
We said from the start
We're doing it all in the name of love

How many times have we managed to hurt one another
Saying things we never meant to say
Getting hung up in the games we play
Are we ever gonna find our way?

Round and round we go, kind of like a hurricane
Stormy winds may blow, we can take the weather
Everybody knows, Rhett and Scarlett did the same
We've got to remember, it's all in the name of love
Facing odds that pull us apart
Sometimes we end up breaking each other's hearts
We've gotta be strong
We said from the start
We're doing it all in the name of love
