I once had a love that I don't talk about
Baby she cheated on me
And broke my heart (Yes she did)
And that's why I've resisted your kiss for so long
But you're wearing me down and I can't go on
Each time you touch me
The feeling's too strong

Can't hold back any more
Never felt this before
I've been captured so let love begin
I'll give all that I can
Put my heart in your hands
I am your prisoner, baby you win
And just maybe this time I'll get it right
You just untie my hands, I won't put up a fight
I surrender completely to you
Girl I give in

I trusted someone I don't want to think about
And I swore I'd never give my love again
Now I'm losing the grip that I had on my heart
And forgetting the memories that tore me apart
Help me remember
Just where to start
You might also like
Can't hold back any more
Never felt this before
I've been captured so let love begin
I'll give all that I can
Put my heart in your hands
I am your prisoner, baby you win
And just maybe this time I'll get it right
You just untie my hands, I won't put up a fight
I surrender completely to you
Girl I give in

I give in to love
I'm gonna try
All that I need are the wings to fly
Take my heart
Show me the light
I don't wanna spend another lonely night
Girl I give in

Can't hold back any more
Never felt this before
I've been captured so let love begin
I'll give all that I can
Put my heart in your hands
I am your prisoner, baby you win
And just maybe this time I'll get it right
You just untie my hands, I won't put up a fight
I surrender completely to you
Girl I give in
I give in, baby
Ooh, I give in to love, to your kiss
I won't hold back any more
Can't hold back any more
Never thought I could be the kinda man
To open up his heart
To say I give in
And as I stand before you girl
I know I found someone
