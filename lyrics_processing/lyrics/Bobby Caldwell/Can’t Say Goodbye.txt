Ever since the day we met
I knew that I would not regret
I could never leave you for another
But you treat me like a fool
I can't keep on being cool
Now I need some time just to recover
With a ticket to a distant place
I could leave you far behind
Your love has put me into outer space
I'm about to lose my mind
There are things about you
I will never understand
And although our love
Is not exactly what I planned
Ooh, it was meant to be
Darling can't you see

You and I just can't say goodbye
Till the day I die
I will love you
You and I just can't say goodbye
Till the day I die
I will love you
You might also like
Maybe it would be worthwhile
If I could make you change your style
But honey you would never have that notion
You would have to rearrange
The things that you would never change
Tell me why you play with my emotions
If you see confusion on my face
Well, it's just my state of mind

Ooh, ooh

You and I just can't say goodbye
Till the day I die
I will love you
You and I just can't say goodbye
Till the day I die
I will love you
Oh, no
You and I just can't say goodbye
Till the day I lie
I will love you (Oh, baby)
You and I just can't say goodbye
Till the day I die
I will love you
You and I just can't say goodbye
Till the day I die
I will love you
Your love has put me into outer space
I'm about to lose my mind
You and I just can't say goodbye
Till the day I die
I will love you
You and I just can't say goodbye
