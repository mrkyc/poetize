I wish I had a little more time
I wish I had a little more space
I wish the truth was something you could pull me through
Something I could face
I wish I was a little more torn
I wish I had a little more faith
I wish that I could hide behind your pretty lies
You're so hard to blame

This love's gonna kill me, I know
If I have it or I don't

Don't wanna be breathless, intoxicated
Craving the thought of you
Don't wanna be losing my mind
Don't wanna be strung out and end up jaded
All because I fell for you, I wish I could
Make up my mind
Baby I don't wanna be paralysed
Baby I don't wanna be paralysed

I wish I had a little more light
Just a little more left to give
I wish that when I'm following, I'd pull you through
You'd follow me with
I wish I knew right from wrong
That you'd open up and let me in
I wish that I could hide behind your pretty lies
There's no way to win
You might also like
This love's gonna kill me, I know
If I have it or I don't

Don't wanna be breathless, intoxicated
Craving the thought of you
Don't wanna be losing my mind
Don't wanna be strung out and end up jaded
All because I fell for you, I wish I could
Make up my mind
Baby I don't wanna be paralysed
Baby I don't wanna be paralysed

I wish I had a little more time
I wish I had a little more space
I wish the truth was something you could pull me through

Don't wanna be breathless, intoxicated
Craving the thought of you
Don't wanna be losing my mind
Don't wanna be strung out and end up jaded
All because I fell for you
I wish I could make up my mind
Baby I don't wanna be paralysed
Baby I don't wanna be paralysed
