Hey
I guess I wanted you to believe
That nothing really mattered to me
I told myself that if you were gone
I'd just carry on
But trying to move on only hurts
It's one step forward two in reverse
But since the moment I let you leave

All I see is you
When I wake up
You, when I talk
You, when I lie down
You, when I walk
You, when I'm sleeping
You, when I try to breathe
(You just keep on haunting me)

I'll get over the way that you got over me
I know that I'll make it there eventually
Get my heart to erase somehow
And stop wondering, "Where are you now?"
If I gave it all to someone else instead
Would you pack your bags and get out of my head?
Someday I won't even look around
I'll stop wondering, "Where are you now?"

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh

I never wear my heart on my sleeve
I was always my enemy
Since the moment I let you leave

All I see is you
When I wake up
You, when I talk
You, when I lie down
You, when I walk
You, when I'm sleeping
You, when I try to breathe
(You just keep on haunting me)
I'll get over the way that you got over me
I know that I'll make it there eventually
Get my heart to erase somehow
And stop wondering, "Where are you now?"

Would you pack your bags and get out of my head?
Someday I won't even look around
I'll stop wondering, "Where are you now?"

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh (where are you now?)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh
