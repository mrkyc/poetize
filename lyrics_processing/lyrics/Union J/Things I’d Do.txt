The way your body move
From across the room
Can't keep my eyes off you
If only you knew
The thing's I would do

Turn my temperature up
I'm tempted to touch
Can't get enough of you
Girl it's time to confess
Thoughts in my head
I need to undress the truth

The things I'd do to you
(Things I, things I)
The Things I'd do to you
(Things I, things I)
The things I'd do to you
(Things I, things I)
If only you knew
The thing's I would do

Ain't nobody made me feel this way
I'll do what it takes just call my name
The things I'd do to you
(Things I, things I)
The Things I'd do to you
(Things I, things I)
The thing's I'd do
You might also like
They say talk is cheap
Let me show you what I mean
Underneath these sheets
If only you knew
The thing's we could do

Turn my temperature up
I'm tempted to touch
Can't get enough of you
Girl it's time to confess
Thoughts in my head
I need to undress the truth

The things I'd do to you
(Things I, things I)
The Things I'd do to you
(Things I, things I)
The things I'd do to you
(Things I, things I)
If only you knew
The thing's I would do

Ain't nobody made me feel this way
I'll do what it takes just call my name
The things I'd do to you
(Things I, things I)
The Things I'd do to you
(Things I, things I)
The thing's I'd do
Biting your lip, just a lil bit
Tasting your skin, Imagine it babe
Taking a risk, riding me this way
You ain't had it my way!

The things I'd do to you
(Things I, things I)
The Things I'd do to you
(Things I, things I)
The things I'd do to you
(Things I, things I)
If only you knew
The thing's I would do

Ain't nobody made me feel this way
I'll do what it takes just call my name
The things I'd do to you
(Things I, things I)
The Things I'd do to you
(Things I, things I)
