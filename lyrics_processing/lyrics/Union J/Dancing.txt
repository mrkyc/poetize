I feel like dancing
Tonight
I feel like dancing the night away
The dance floor has us here
From now until the end
Two-stepping all the way
I feel like dancing
Tonight
I feel like dancing the night away
The dance floor has us here
From now until the end
Two-stepping all the way

Baby, I'ma call a cab in a minute
Fly around the world in a minute
I wanna take you on a ride in a minute
Take you on a drive for a minute
Spend a little time for a minute
Drink a lot of wine for a minute
I wanna take you on a ride for a minute
I'ma call a cab in a minute
I feel like dancing
You might also like
Feeling like the one
I just wanna two step, baby, come
Livin' at the beach, life sipping on the rum
I know you wanna dance but it's not enough, yeah
Body in a seizure, your hips tryna leave ya
You make a man fall in love, I need ya
I'm just tryna score some points for a keeper
I ain't tryna get a dance then leave ya
Uh, ya, you know I like that
The way you bring it forward and bring it right back
Yeah, I got your back like a write back
'Cause you enjoy your life, you know I like that
And I need everybody up one time
One time, no stand still, stiff up, stiff up
My ladies, I just wanna see you whine
My mandem just lift up, lift up

I feel like dancing
Tonight
I feel like dancing the night away
The dance floor has us here
From now until the end
Two-stepping all the way
I feel like dancing
Tonight
I feel like dancing the night away
The dance floor has us here
From now until the end
Two-stepping all the way

Baby, I'ma call a cab in a minute
Fly around the world in a minute
I wanna take you on a ride in a minute
Take you on a drive for a minute
Spend a little time for a minute
Drink a lot of wine for a minute
Wanna take you on a ride in a minute
I'ma call a cab in a minute
I feel like dancing

Girl, your body move livo
You got me thinking am I living in my high hopes?
Damn, this is my real life though
Treading thin like I'm walking on a tight rope
And this is hella my season
Might book a flight for no reason
Might let you know when I'm leaving
Or I might let you go within reason
Get down, get low now
We came out to have a show now
Bring it together, you're not alone now
Queen of the dance, you got your throne now
Man, I need everyone up one time
No standstill, stiff up, stiff up
My ladies, I just wanna see you whine
