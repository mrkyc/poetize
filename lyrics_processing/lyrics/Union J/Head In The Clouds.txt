Magazines and TV screens are telling the world is going, going down
How could days are few and far between
And I don't really like the way it sounds
I think my generation is growing up complaining
I need to shake them
Honestly, I need to dumb it down
I think my brain is burning out

Whoa-oh, call me your fool
'Cause sometimes I just don't care
I don't right now

We all gotta do it, do it
'Cause life can be a b- then we die, we die
There's so much sh- to worry 'bout
And that's the reason why

It's why I spend all my days with my head up in the clouds
All my days with my head up in the clouds
All my days with my head up in the clouds
Like wow, wow
You might also like
Well, call me crazy, call me lazy
Maybe you can even call me ignorant
Here's a tissue for your issue
I don't care if it's on CNN
I've got a lot to deal with
I'd rather just be chillin'
It's how I'm feeling
Maybe I can worry about it all tomorrow
I just want today

Whoa-oh, call me your fool
'Cause sometimes I just don't care
I don't right now

We all gotta do it, do it
'Cause life can be a b- then we die, we die
There's so much sh- to worry 'bout
And that's the reason why

It's why I spend all my days with my head up in the clouds
All my days with my head up in the clouds
All my days with my head up in the clouds
Like wow, wow
Whoa-oh, call me your fool
'Cause sometimes I just don't care
I don't

We all gotta do it, do it
'Cause life can be a b- then we die, we die
There's so much shit to worry 'bout
And that's the reason why
We all gotta do it, do it
'Cause life can be a b- then we die, we die
There's so much shit to worry 'bout
And that's the reason why

It's why I spend all my days with my head up in the clouds
All my days with my head up in the clouds
All my days with my head up in the clouds
Like wow, wow
It's why I spend all my days with my head up in the clouds
All my days with my head up in the clouds
All my days with my head up in the clouds
