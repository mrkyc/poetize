Oh, sweet lungs, don't fail me now
Your burning has turned into fear
It drills me in my every step, I'm moving quick
But you're always on my heels

Just one more breath, I beg you please
Just one more step, my knees are weak
My heart is sturdy, but it needs you to survive
My heart is sturdy, but it needs you

Breathe, don't you want to breathe?
I know that you are strong enough to handle what I need
My capillaries scream, there's nothing left to feed on
My body needs a reason to cross the line
Will you carry me there one more time?

Steady lungs, don't fail me know
I feel you bursting, but you won't let me die
Fill me up with every step, I'm feeling sick
But I'm leaving it behind

Just one more breath, I beg you please
Just one more step, you are not weak
My legs are sturdy, but they need you to survive
My heart is sturdy, but I need you

I can feel them on my teeth, upon my lips and in my chest

I feel the tension in my lungs, and every move is filled by my resolve to
