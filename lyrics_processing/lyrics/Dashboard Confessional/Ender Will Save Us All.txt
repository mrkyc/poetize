It's just like you to contest
Wear it like a label on your breast
Don't you see what this takes of me?
A certain callousness complies with your charm
And in your pride a hopeful look draped in despise

I want to give you whatever you need
What is it you need? Is it what I need?
I want to give you whatever you need
What is it you need? Is it within me?

It's hard to explain how I am getting by on so little from you
It's hard to believe that I would let myself get so wrapped into you
There's got to be something that would be worthwhile for me to give to you
We need a connection but you seem to push me far away from you
From you, from you

Harder I push, the farther I fall
Well, you don't mind me being headstrong
But you don't want to sing along
Maybe it's trite but I can't always, always, always be wrong
