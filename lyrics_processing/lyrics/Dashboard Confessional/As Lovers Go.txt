You're wasting your time if you're fishing around here."
And I said, "You must be mistaken
I'm not foolin', this feelin' is real."
She said, "You've gotta be crazy!
What do you take me for? Some kind of easy mark?"
"You've got wits, you've got looks, you've got passion
But I swear that you've got me all wrong, all wrong, all wrong
That you've got me..."
I'll be true, I'll be useful, I'll be cavalier, I'll be yours my dear
And I'll belong to you if just let me through
This is easy as lovers go
So don't complicate it by hesitating
And this is wonderful as loving goes
This is tailor-made, what's the sense in waiting?
And I said, "I've got to be honest, I've been waiting for you all my life."
For so long I thought I was asylum bound
But just seeing you makes me think twice
And being with you here makes me sane
I fear I'll go crazy if you leave my side
"You've got wits, you've got looks, you've got passion
But are you brave enough to leave with me tonight, tonight, tonight?
You've got me..."
