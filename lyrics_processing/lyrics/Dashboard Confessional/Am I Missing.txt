Sharp disaster in a fresh new coma
Was it worth it when it was over?
Provin' yourself right, you make the biggest noise
Well, I'd lock my hands behind my head
I'd cover my heart and hit the deck
I'd brace myself for the impact if I were you

(It's a long way) Is there anything
(For an answer) Worth looking for
(Is there any news?) Worth loving for
(Is there any word?) Worth lying for?
(Is there trauma) Is there anything
(Or a struggle?) Worth waiting for
(Am I missing) Worth living for
(Or was the body found?) Worth dying for?
