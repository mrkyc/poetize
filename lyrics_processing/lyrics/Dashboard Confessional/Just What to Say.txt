I went through this door
For no other reason than it wasn't open
And sometimes I'm foolish
Enough to believe encouraging things
But most times I'm cautiously less optimistic
A face in the crowd
I wish to be found
I worry so often for those who escape
I wonder out loud
I sleep at odd hours
And I write 'cause I never know just what to say

My friends all believe me
When I say I'm busy with pretty big things
I cancel most plans
I hurt someone's feelings
I feel like I'm starting
And just when I'm starting, I'm starting to stray

And everyday, I take a white page
And try very hard to know just what to say
Just what to say, just what to say
I try very hard to know just what to say
Just what to say, just what to say

I've planted some clues
That I hope you find easily
Things that I find hard to speak clear and true
I think there's a part of you
Hoping I'm hoping you feel like I do
And maybe you're listening
Somewhere you like to be
Where you let everything heavy just go
Oh, I'd like to be there
How I'd like to stay
How I'd like to listen
How I'd like to think I'd know just what to say

Just what to say, just what to say
I try very hard to know just what to say
Just what to say, just what to say

Somebody, somebody blocked the door
I know it was me for sure
But somebody knows where I'm hidden away
I try very hard to know just what to say
Just what to say, just what to say
I try very hard to know just what to say
Just what to say, just what to say
I try very hard to know just what to say
