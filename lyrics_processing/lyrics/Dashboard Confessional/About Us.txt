You waited to make the call
Longer than most would
Longer than most
Just to be safe
Few words to say it all
Fewer than most would
Fewer than most
There's nothing to save
So I thought about staying home
I thought about laying low
But there's no use hiding away

Now I wanna hold you a little bit tighter
Burn like a lighter
Light a fire up about us
I'm always gonna be about us
Chasing you like nothing else matters
Only getting faster
And I'm never giving up on us
I'm always gonna be about us

I think of the mess we made
As I walked to the corner
I walked to the corner of 7th and Main
The scene of a serenade
I try to find order
And try to find order in all of this change
And I think about who we are
I think of how very far
I'll go when there's so much to save

Now I wanna hold you a little bit tighter
Burn like a lighter
Light a fire up about us
I'm always gonna be about us
Chasing you like nothing else matters
Only getting faster
And I'm never giving up on us
I'm always gonna be about us
About us
About us
I'd be lost without you here with me
Don't make it harder than it has to be
Find me a war; I'll fight it if that's what you need
So darling don't hide from me

Now I wanna hold you a little bit tighter
Burn like a lighter
Light a fire up about us
I'm always gonna be about us
Chasing you like nothing else matters
Only getting faster
And I'm never giving up on us
I'm always gonna be about us
About us
I'm always gonna be about us
About us
I'm always gonna be about us
About us
