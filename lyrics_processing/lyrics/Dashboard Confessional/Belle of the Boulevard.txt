The sound of an old guitar
Is saving you from sinking
It's a long way down, it's a long way
Back like you never broke, you tell a dirty joke
He touches your leg and thinks he's getting close
For now you let him
Just this once, just for now, and just like that it's over
Don't turn away, dry your eyes, dry your eyes
Don't be afraid, but keep it all inside, all inside
When you fall apart, dry your eyes, dry your eyes
Life is always hard for the Belle of the Boulevard
In all your silver rings, in all your silken things
That song you softly sing
Is keeping you from breaking
It's a long way down, it's a long way
Back here you never lost, you shake the shivers off
You take a drink to get your courage up
Can you believe it?
Just this once, just for now, and just like that it's over
Don't turn away, dry your eyes, dry your eyes
Don't be afraid, oh keep it all inside, all inside
When you fall apart, dry your eyes, dry your eyes
Life is always hard for the Belle of the Boulevard

Please hold on, it's all right

Down in a local bar out on the boulevard
The sound of an old guitar
Is saving you
Don't turn away, dry your eyes, dry your eyes
Don't be afraid, but keep it all inside, all inside
When you fall apart, dry your eyes, dry your eyes
Life is always hard, let me dry your eyes, dry your eyes
Don't turn turn away
Time to dry your eyes, dry your eyes
Don't be afraid, or keep it all inside, all inside
When you fall apart, gonna dry your eyes, dry your eyes
