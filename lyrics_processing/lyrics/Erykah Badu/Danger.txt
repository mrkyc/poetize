Me and this baby gon' be up all night long
Walkin this wood floor 'til my man gets home
I'm at the front door, I'm listening by the phone
But I'm gon' be here with my makeup on
It's been a long time since my man been gone
But when he get here you know I won't be gone
Because I love him, love him strong (N'Dambi)
Me and this baby gon' be up all night long

Because they got the block on lock
The trunk stay locked
Glock on cock
The block stay hot
Block on lock
The trunk stay locked
Glock on cock
The block stay hot

What she say?
I said
Block on lock
The trunk stay locked
Glock on cock
The block stay hot
You might also like
Got a box of money that I keep under my bed
But we don't spend it though, might need it for more Yeyo
We need this money just in case we need to make a run
Gotta keep the clip in mama's gun
Or run...
(What?)
We like to keep the car runnin'
We try to keep the car runnin'
We like to keep the bitch hummin'
Runnin' runnin' (run)
We try to keep the car runnin'
We like to keep the bitch hummin'
In case the sweeper boyz comin'
Runnin', run, y'all

The block on lock
The trunk stay locked
Glock on cock
The block stay hot
Block on lock
The trunk stay locked
Glock on cock

Well there ain't no mistaken
That the money you're makin
Leaves you nervous and shakin
Cause at night you're awake and
Thinkin bout lives that you've taken
All the love you've forsaken
In yo zone
Niggas gon' get they fuckin head blown
DANGER
You're in DANGER
No hard feelings right or wrong
Weak or strong, I don't make the laws
In yo zone niggas gon' get they fuckin
Head blown

Because they got the block on lock
The trunk stay locked
Glock on cock
The block stay hot
Block on lock
The trunk stay locked
Glock on cock
The block stay hot
Might have to flush the Yayo
(I understand the game sometimes)
Might have to flush the Yeyo
Might have to flush the Yeyo
Yeyo, Yeyo
Might have to flush the Yeyo
(I understand the game sometimes)
Might have to flush the Yeyo
Might have to flush the Yeyo
Yeyo, Yeyo
