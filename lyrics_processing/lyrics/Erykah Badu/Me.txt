Everything around you see
The Ankhs, the wraps, the plus degrees
And yes, even the mysteries
It's all me
Sometimes it's hard to move you see
When you're growing publicly
But if I have to choose between
I choose me

Had 2 babies, different dudes
And for them both my love was true
This is my last interview
Hey that's me, ooh
This year, I turned 36
Damn, it seem it came so quick
My ass and legs have gotten thick, yeah
It's all me
I used to pray to God above
But now I'm filled with so much love
That even if the world can't see
It's still me
Will I escape this vanity?
Or will I keep on smoking trees?
But I'll just let it go and
Be, be, be me
You might also like
I'll leave it alone, babe
Well, well, well
I'll, I'll leave it alone, babe
Just be me
I'll leave it alone, babe
Well, well, well
I'll, I'll leave it alone, babe
Just be me

Sometimes I don't know what to say
So many leaders to obey
But I was born on savior's day, yeah
So I choose me
And in this world of greed and hate
They may try to erase my face
But millions spring up in my place
Oh, oh-oh, oh, believe me
As sure as all and all is one
We all shall grow before it's done
So I salute you Farrakhan, yes
'Cause you are me
Before I end this crazy dream
Before I take one for the team
"Your ass, the match, the gasoline," yeah
That's Kolleen, that's Kolleen
Kolleen Gibson Wright was a girl from South Dallas, Texas
Married William, gave birth to Erykah
Then Koryan under Erykah, and then she finally delivered Eevin Wright
Coolest friends called her twiggy
'Cause she looked like a model with those eyes
She was witty and beautiful, people drawn to her smile
Lovely, long, and fresh
I could not think of another soul that I'd rather be like or admire
Kolleen is tighter, smarter, quicker than the average bear
Even though, even though, it was hard
