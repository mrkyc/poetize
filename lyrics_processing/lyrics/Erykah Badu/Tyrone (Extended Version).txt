Alright then

I'm gettin tired of your shit
You don't never buy me nothin
And every time you come around
You got to bring Jim, John, Paul and Tyrone
Now why can't we be by ourselves sometimes
See I've been having this on my mind for a long time
I just want it to be you and me like it used to be, baby
But you don't know how to act, so matter fact

I think you better call Tyrone (call him)
And tell him come on, help you get your shit
(Come on, come on, come on)
You need to call Tyrone (call him)
And tell him I said come on

Now every time I ask you for a little cash
You say no but turn right around and ask me for some ass
Oh well hold up listen partna I ain't no cheap thrill
'Cause Miss Badu's always comin' for real, you know the deal nigga
You might also likeEverytime we go somewhere
I gotta reach down in my purse
To pay your way and your homeboys way
And sometimes your cousin's way
When we all went out to eat
You made me ride in the backseat
And that ain't right child
I said that ain't right child no

So I think you better call Tyrone (call him)
And tell him come on, help you get your shit
(Come on, come on, come on)
You need to call Tyrone (call him)
But you can't use my phone

Oh take my pills pay my bills
I'm here to let you know (Call him) that what I feel is real
Day to day life with you is no thrill (Come on, come on, come on)
It's getting late no time to wait
Get go on so I can meditate (Call him)
Om, Om, haha
Light my cone sing my song
I don't give a damn (Call him) if I'm right or wrong
Toodle loo toodle loo  (Come on, come on, come on)
Dadiada da da da
Doo do day or night wrong or right
Tell your boys to find another place to watch the fight (Call him)
Don't make me go get big Mike
Oh so tell your boys at the liquor store
That you gonna need a place to go (Call him)
I don't care butchu gots to leave
You can tell 'em you broke up with me
(Come on, come on, come on)
I wanted you to massage my toes
But you'd rather play dominoes (Call him)
So baby get up off your knees and hands
And go and tell it to the preacher man ha

But first I think ya need to call Tyrone (call him)
And tell him come on help you get your shit
You need to call Tyrone (call him)
Hold on
