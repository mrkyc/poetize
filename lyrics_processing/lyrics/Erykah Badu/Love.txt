Our emotions have a vibratory frequency to them
There are only two emotions that humankind experience: fear and love
While other emotions branch either directly or indirectly from these two emotions
Fear has a long and slow frequency vibration to it
While love has a very rapid and high frequency
Tone rises again as it becomes a whirling noise while flying by
