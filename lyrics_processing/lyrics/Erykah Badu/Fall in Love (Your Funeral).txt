You better go back the way you came
Wrong way uh, if you stay
Prepare to have yo' shit rearranged
The way uh, I say

Huh, you gon' see, it's gon' be
Some, slow sangin and flower bringing
If my burglar alarm starts

See you don't wanna fall in love with me
See you don't wanna fall in love with me
See you don't wanna fall in love with me
See you don't wanna fall in love with me
See you don't wanna fall in love with me

But you'll do, uh 'til he come
Hey, see we gon' take this shit from the top
You gotta, change jobs, and change gods
