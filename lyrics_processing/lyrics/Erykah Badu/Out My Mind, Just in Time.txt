I'm a recovering undercover over-lover
Recovering from a love I can't get over
Recovering undercover over-lover
And now my common law lover thinks he wants another
And I lie for you, I cry for you
And pop for you, and break for you
And hate for you, and I'll hate you too
If you want me to
I pray for you
Crochet for you
Make it from scratch for you
Leave off the latch for you
Go to the store for you, do it some more for you
Do what you want me to, guess I'm a fool for you
I'm a recovering undercover over-lover
Recovering from a love I can't get over
Recovering undercover over-lover
And now my common law lover thinks he wants another
And I lie for you, and cry for you
Pop for you, break for you
And hate for you, and I'll hate you too
If you want me to
I gotta do, my love for you
Chop & Screw for you, paint it red for you
It's true, it's true, poor Badu
Thought I was through with you
Guess I'm a fool for you

Easily...said than done...

Bitter tree...fruit so raw...
Winter cold...let me THAW

It's time for me to make some steps
Easy to blame somebody else
Hey, but not this time, but not this time
But not this time, but not this - no

20 feet up out of ashes I can rise
Just like birds and children, I can fly
And I'll take... my... phoenix flight
And you can't take... mine...
But you can try
Oh, no, not this time, but not this time
But not this time, but not this - no
But not this time, but not this time

But not this, tiiiiiime
But not this time, but not this - no
But not this time, but not this time
But not this time, but not this - hey
On and on I seem to go
Round and round, I seem to go
Always had the antidote
Looking for the holy ghost
Found it in the missing note
Sinking in a holey boat
Round and round, I seem to go
Round...and round... and round
Oooh-ooh, I-iiiiiiiiiiiii
Oooh-ooh, I-iiiiiiiiiiiii
Oooh-ooh, I-iiiiiiiiiiiii
Yeah, guess it's time to grab my coat
Evolution's time to grow
Ego tryin to block to do'
Might not have nowhere to go
Now I got a leading role
