Hey
Hey
Ohh, ohh, ohhh
Fell in love

So, presently I'm standing
Here right now, you're so demanding
Tell me what you want from me
Concluding, concentrating on my music, lover, and my babies
Make me wanna ask a lady for a ticket outta town

So can I get a window seat?
Don't want nobody next to me
I just want a ticket outta town
A look around and a safe touch down
Can I get a window seat? (Oh, oh)
Don't want nobody next to me
I just want a chance to fly
A chance to cry, and a long bye-bye
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

But I, I need you to want me
I need you to miss me
I, I need yo' attention, yes
I need you next to me
Oh I, I need someone to clap for me (Mm-hmm)
I need your direction
You might also like
Somebody say come back
Come back, baby, come back
(I want you to need me)
Come back, come back, baby, come back (Baby)
Come back, come back, baby, come back (Want you to need me)
Come back, come back, baby, come back (Need me, ah)

So, out my mind I'm tusslin'
Back and forth 'tween here and hustlin'
I don't wanna time travel no mo'
I wanna be here, my thinkin'
Say, on this porch I'm rockin'
Back and forth like Lightnin' Hopkins
So if anybody speak to Scotty
Tell him, "Beam me up!"

So can I get a window seat? (Hey)
Don't want nobody next to me
I just want a ticket outta town
A look around and a safe touch down
Can I get a window seat? (Oh, oh)
Don't want nobody next to me (Hey)
I just want a chance to fly
A chance to cry, and a long bye-bye
Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh
But I, I need you to miss me
I need somebody, come get me, ooh
I need your attention, yes
And I need your energy and I do
Oh, oh, I, I need someone to clap for me (Uh)
And I need your direction

Somebody say come back (Hey)
Come back, baby, come back
(I want you to need me)
Come back, come back, baby, come back
Come back, come back, baby, come back (Come look for me, say)
Come back, come back, baby, come back (Hey, hey)

So can I get a window seat?
Don't want nobody next to me
I just want a ticket outta town
A look around and a safe touch down
Oh, oh
I just want a chance to fly
A chance to cry, and a long bye-bye
