Lately you make me really wonder
If you really wanna
Know I'm kinda fast but spend the night

Uh, uh, you really wanna

Could I call you?
I can be the one you give your all to
Know I hate the fall, so when fall's through, baby, fall through
You're different, fuck what they all do
Tryna get to know you
On a level you ain't been introduced to
I Ain't tryna hurt or confuse you
Maybe amuse you, damn
Baby, we could do the usual
I think I can use you
I think I could put you in a place and never lose you
We the freaks nigga, we could try to voodoo
You been trying to solve the puzzle, you ain't even got a clue to
I hate the things that you do
You hate the fact that I moved
I'm somewhere with someone new
We talked about a lot but you ain't listen
Man, I'm at the living room of Erykah Badu house
Sipping on some tea, man Zach is the Witness
This is how it goes when you gifted
This is how it goes when you get it
Man, I got some goals for these bitches
Yeah, I keep it in the bun
But it's just that this is Texas, where the grills looking vicious
And I know I'm kind of fast but maybe spend the night
If you with it, what's up?

Telephone
It's Ol' Dirty
He wants to give you directions home
Said it won't be too long
Transition time to go away
Time to go away
Slow fade
