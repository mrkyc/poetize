Gave me the life that I came to live

Do I really
Want my baby?

I know you got to get yo' hustle on
So I pray
I understand the game, sometimes
And I love you strong, mm, but

What you gonna do when they come for you?
Work ain't honest but it pays the bills (Yes, it does)
What we gonna do when they come for you?
God, I can't stand life without you

Now, me and baby got this situation
See, brother got this complex occupation
And it ain't that he don't have education
'Cause I was right there at his graduation
Now, I ain't sayin' that this life don't work
But, it's me and baby that he hurts
Beause I tell him right, he thinks I'm wrong
But I love him strong
He gave me the life that I came to live
Gave me the song that I came to give
Pressure on me, but the seed has grown
I can't make it on my own
Summer came around and the flowers bloomed
He became the sun, I became the moon
Precious gifts that we both receive
Or could this be make-believe?
