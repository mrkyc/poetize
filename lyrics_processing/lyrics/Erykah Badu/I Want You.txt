Love is on the way
All I got to say
Is it won't let go
You can pray 'til early May
Fast for thirty days
Still, it won't let go

Got a good book and got all in it
Tried a little yoga for a minute
But it won't let go
Ohhhh woah...
Tried to turn the sauna up to hotter
Drunk a whole jar of holy water
But it won't let go
Ohhhh woah...
