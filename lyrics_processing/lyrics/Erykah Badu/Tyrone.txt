Now, keep in mind that I'm an artist
And I'm sensitive about my shit
(Audience cheering)
But y'all been nice about it
Alright
Sisters, how y'all feel? (Girls cheering)
Brothers, y'all alright? (Guys cheering)
Let's see how y'all groove to this
Alright

I'm gettin' tired of your shit
You don't never buy me nothin'
See, everytime you come around
You got to bring Jim, James, Paul, and Tyrone
See, why can't we be by ourselves, sometimes
See, I've been having this on my mind
For a long time
I just want it to be
You and me
Like it used to be, baby
But ya don't know how to act
So matter of fact

I think ya better call Tyrone
(Call him)
And tell him, "Come on, help you get your shit"
(Come on, come on, come on)
You need to call Tyrone
(Call im)
And tell him I said "Come on"

Now, everytime I ask you for a little cash
You say no and turn right around, and ask me for some ass
Oh, well, hold up
Listen, partner
I ain't no cheap thrill
'Cause Miss Badu is always comin' for real
And you know the deal, nigga
Everytime we go somewhere
I gotta reach down in my purse
To pay your way and your homeboys' way
And sometimes your cousin's way
They don't never have to pay
Don't have no cars
Hang around in bars
Try to hang around with stars
Like Badu
I'm gon' tell you the truth
Showing groove
Or get the boot

I think ya better... (Call Tyrone)
Heh-heh-heh, call him!
And tell him, "Come on"
Help you get your shit
(Come on, come on, come on)
You need to call Tyrone
(Call him)
Hold on...
But ya can't use my phone
