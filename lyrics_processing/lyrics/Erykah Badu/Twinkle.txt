Ayy, yo
What the fuck are you doin'?
Ayy, we gotta get out, come here
Where they hit me at?
They didn't hit you
What is this?
They fucking hit me
They hit me in my face
What?
Is there still someone up there?

They don't know their language
They don't know they're God
They take what they're given
Even when it feels odd
They say their grandfathers and grandmothers work hard for nothing
And we still in this ghetto
So they end up in prisons
They end up in blood

They keep us uneducated
Sick and depressed
(They end up in blood)
Doctor I'm addicted now
I'm under arrest
(They end up in blood)
We making mo' money than a motherfucker
(They end up in blood)
With no choices there's no hope for us
(They end up in blood)

Descendants of warlocks
Witches with ill glitches
Children of the matrix be hitting them car switches
Seen some virgin virgos hanging out with venus bitches
