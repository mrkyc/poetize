(On the road again, okay
Yeah, right
Light and breezy
And don't let it go down, whatever
One, two, one, two, three, four)

I'm so tired of cryin'
I'm out on the road again
I'm on the road again
You know, I'm so tired of cryin'
I'm out on the road again
I'm on the road again
I ain't got no woman, darlin'
Don't you know ain't got no friend

My dear mother left me
When I was quite young
When I was quite young
You know, my dear mother left me
When I was quite young
When I was quite young
She said "Lord, have mercy
On her wicked son"

Take a hint from me, mama
Please don't you cry no more
Don't you cry no more
Take a hint from me, mama
Please don't you cry no more
Don't you cry no more
Don't you know, pretty darlin'
Soon one mornin' down the road I'm goin'

I asked the conductor
"Please, let a poor boy ride
Let the poor boy ride"
Lord, I asked the conductor
"Please, let the poor boy ride
Let a poor boy ride"
He said "I'm so sad to say
But the train ain't none of mine"

(Take it, Henry)

(Yes)
(Alright)
(Oh, yes)
The first time I travelled
Out in the rain and snow
In the rain and snow
Lord, the first time I travelled
Out in the rain and snow
In the rain and snow
You know, I done lost my faro
I didn't know which way to go

Lord, I done start walkin'
Down that long old lonesome road
All by myself
Don't you know, I done start walkin'
Down that long old lonesome road
All by myself
Lord, I couldn't have my darlin'
I don't want nobody else
