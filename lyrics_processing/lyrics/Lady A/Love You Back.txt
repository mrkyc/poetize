I'm in love with the thought of you when you were twenty-two
My pair of boots and your Converse shoes kicked off by the front door
Sippin' cheap tequila on the front porch
I'm in love with the history of you and me, how it used to be
The king and queen of this small town, young and wild
Somethin' from the '90s on the dashboard dial

But, oh, a memory ain't enough
'Cause I can look, but I can't touch

A memory can't get you outside of your mama's house
Midnight rain on a Chevy hood
A memory can't hold you in a Sarasota sunrise
Even though you wish it would
All it's gonna do is make you lose sleep at night
Wake up and leave you in the past
You can love a memory, but a memory
Can't love you back

Just when I think I found someone new, it comes out the blue
It kills my vice and it kills the mood
Those two years, they're long gone
And I should be movin' on
You might also like
But, oh, a memory'll make it hard
It's time to realize you don't deserve my heart
Heart, oh

A memory can't get you outside of your mama's house
Midnight rain on a Chevy hood
A memory can't hold you in a Sarasota sunrise
Even though you wish it would
All it's gonna do is make you lose sleep at night
Wake up and leave you in the past
You can love a memory, but a memory
Can't love you back (Woah)

Oh, no (Oh)

A memory can't tell you how you'll make her feel
In the moonlight glow of a shotgun seat
A memory can't pick out a diamond ring
And say "I do" under an old oak tree

All it's gonna do is make you lose sleep at night
Wake up and leave you in the past
You can love a memory, but a memory
Can't love you back (Woah)
Can't love you back (Oh)
You can love a memory, but a memory
