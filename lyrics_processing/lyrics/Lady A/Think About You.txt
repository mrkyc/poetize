It was mid July, summer rain
We drove past the Texaco
With an empty tank and no loose change
You swore we'd make it home
It's a little fuzzy 'cause
I was caught up in your eyes
Your touch
The rush
When you showed up late on New Year's Eve
And you tried to hold my hand
You told me that you'd met someone
And I said, "I understand"
It's hard not to fall apart
With a midnight broken heart
So I cried
But that was the last time

'Cause I don't think about you and me
What we used to be
Every memory anymore
Forgot about what we went through
'Cause I'm bulletproof
Oh, I bet you think I do
No, I don't think about you, you, you
You might also like
The place where I first saw your face
And you bought me a drink
And when we talked 'til 2AM
About every single dream
Well, now it's just a bar
In a beat up parking lot
I see
Yeah, that's all it is to me

'Cause I don't think about you and me
What we used to be
Every memory anymore
Forgot about what we went through
'Cause I'm bulletproof
Oh, I bet you think I do
No, I don't think about you, you, you
No, I don't think about you

Well, maybe only when I'm lonely or when I'm drinking
But when I see you I'm always gonna play it cool
'Cause I don't think about you and me
What we used to be
Every memory anymore
'Cause I don't think about you and me
What we used to be
Every memory anymore
Forgot about what we went through
My heart is bulletproof
Oh, I bet you think I do
No, I don't think about you, you, you
No, I don't think about you, you, you (Well, maybe only when I'm lonely or when I'm drinking, but when I see you, I'm always gonna play it cool)
