This city never looked so
This city never looked so good
This city never looked so
This city never looked so good

White noise ringing on the boulevard
Same cover band in the same old bar
Ohh, singin' ohh
Midnight smoke floatin' in the air
A million faces everywhere
Ohh, singin' ohh
But tonight (Tonight)
It feels like just you and me
'Cause all I see, are

Street lights on fire
Couldn't get much higher
This city never looked so good the way it's lookin' so good on you
Your hands in my jacket
Caught up in this magic
This city never looked so good the way it's lookin' so good on you
Yeah
You might also like
Counting cards, baby, one, two, three
I don't care if we get no sleep
Ohh, singin' ohh
Pull me close, put your lips on mine
Baby, I don't even recognize
This town, spinnin' around
Everything's upside down

Street lights on fire
Couldn't get much higher
This city never looked so good the way it's lookin' so good on you
Your hands in my jacket
Caught up in this magic
This city never looked so good the way it's lookin' so good on you
Yeah

Tonight (Tonight)
Feels like, just you and me
'Cause all I see, are

Street lights on fire
Couldn't get much higher
This city never looked so good the way it's lookin' so good on you
Yeah
Street lights on fire
Couldn't get much higher
This city never looked so good the way it's lookin' so good on you
Your hands in my jacket
Caught up in this magic
This city never looked so good the way it's lookin' so good on you
Yeah
This city never looked so
This city never looked so good
This city never looked so
This city never looked so good
This city never looked so
This city never looked so good
So good
This city never looked so good
This city never looked so
