Well, this heart of mine has been hardened like a stone
It might take some time to get back what is gone
But I'm moving on and you don't haunt my dreams
Like you did before, oh, when I would curse your name, hey

Well, I heard the news that you were back in town
Just passing through to claim your lost and found
But I'm over you and there ain't nothing there
That you could say or do to take what you did back

Well, you got nerve to waltz right in
And think what's mine is yours again

'Cause I've been doing fine without you
Forgetting all the love we once knew
And, girl, I ain't the one who slammed that door
But now you say you've changed your thinking
But I ain't got a heart for breaking
So go and pick your bags up off my floor
Oh, 'cause love don't live here anymore

Oh, no
You might also like
Well, baby, you can try to tell me how it is
And try to justify everything you did
But, honey, I'm no fool
Oh, and I've been down this road
Too many times with you
I think it's best you go

Well, I got one thing left to say
Is you can lay in the bed you've made

'Cause I've been doing fine without you
Forgetting all the love we once knew
And, girl, I ain't the one who slammed that door
Oh, should've known
Now you say you've changed your thinking
But I ain't got a heart for breaking
So go and pick your bags up off my floor
Oh, 'cause love don't live here anymore

Oh, no
That love don't live here anymore
Oh, no, no
Sugar, no, no
You don't live here anymore
Love don't live here anymore
Since you walked out of my door
Love don't live here
Love don't live here, girl
