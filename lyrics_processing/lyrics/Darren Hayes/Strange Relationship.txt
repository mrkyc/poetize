Do you love me?
Or am I just another trip?
In this strange relationship
You push and pull me again
'Till I'm about to lose my mind
Is this just a waste of time?

Keep acting like you own me
I keep running watch me walkin' out that door
I hear you behind me

Gimme that strange relationship
Never felt pleasure and pain like this
Something so right but it feels so terribly wrong
I keep holding on
Gimme that strange relationship
One of us gotta let go of this
I keep pushing and you keep holding on
I'm already gone

Do you love me? yeah....
We break up and back together
And I swear to myself never
But oh how you do me yeah....
You strip me of my honor
And I don't ever think I'm gonna
You might also like
Break free of these mind games
All I'm tryin' to do is modify my plan
Cause I can't contain you....

Gimme that strange relationship
Never felt pleasure and pain like this
Something so right but it feels so terribly wrong
I keep holding on
Gimme that strange relationship
One of us gotta let go of this
I keep pushing and you keep holding on
I'm already gone

You keep acting like you own me
Like you control me
You said you never really wanted me back
Well maybe that's a fact
May I suggest a brand new plan of attack
And in defense of that
You're hard to crack
You're way off track
I want you back
I want you gone
Maybe I'm sick of holding on
Do you love me? yeah
Or am I just another trip in this strange relationship?

Gimme that strange relationship
Never felt pleasure and pain like this
Something so right but it feels so terribly wrong
I keep holding on
Gimme that strange relationship
One of us gotta let go of this
I keep pushing and you keep holding on
