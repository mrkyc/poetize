Give me a reason
Why I'm feeling so blue
Every time I close my eyes
All I see is you
Give me a reason
Why I can't feel my heart
Everytime you leave my side
I just fall apart
And when you're fast asleep
I wonder where you go
Can you tell me I wanna know

Because I miss you
And this is all I wanna say
I guess I miss you beautiful
These three words have said it all
You know I miss you
I think about you when you're gone
I guess I miss you
Nothing's wrong
I don't mean to carry on

But give me a reason
Why I can't concentrate
The world is turning upside down
Spinning round and round
Now give me a reason
Why I now understand the beauty and simplicity in everything surrounding me
You got a way of spreading magic everywhere
Anywhere I go I know you're always there
It sounds ridiculous but when you leave a room
There's a part of me that just wants to follow you too
You might also like
Because I miss you
And this is all I wanna say
I guess I miss you beautiful
These three words have said it all
You know I miss you
I think about you when you're gone
I guess I miss you
Nothing's wrong
I don't mean to carry on

It's such a hard life and most of the time
I'm just surviving
That's why I want you to know
In a world where sincerity has lost its meaning
You fill my world with so much hope

And I miss you
This is all I wanna say
I guess I miss you beautiful
These three words have said it all
You know I miss you
I think about you when you're gone
I guess I miss you
Nothing's wrong
I don't mean to carry on
You know I miss you
And this is all I wanna say
I guess I miss you beautiful
These three words have said it all
You know I miss you
This is all I wanna do

I know it doesn't sound too cool
But Maybe I'm in love with you
You know I miss you
This is all I wanna say
I guess I miss you
Nothing's wrong
I don't mean to carry on
I just miss you

Yeah, it's true I miss you baby
And when you're walking out the door
I know I miss you
You make me wanna ask for more
