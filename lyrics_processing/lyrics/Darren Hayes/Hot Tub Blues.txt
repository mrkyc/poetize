I need me a drink but it's a thirty-minute drive into town
Got good neighbours, playing that song
I'm doing the housework; I'm cleaning up but nothing on
It's hotter than hell in a nuclear sky
I need me a drink but I don't need a DUI
The back of my throat is like an ice tray
I need me some liquor, some vodka and Ocean Spray
It's hotter than hell, a nuclear sky
I need me a drink but I don't need a DUI
I got hot tub blues
I got red hot shoes
I got need for some fun
Beer and guns
I got hot tub blues
I got red hot shoes
I got need for some fun
Beer and guns
Jump in my truck, head for Wal-mart
To get me a gun, something to eat with jalapenos on
I got me a job but I don't like the work
I can't get laid, but some fooling around couldn't really hurt
You might also likePalm Springs or maybe Wigwam
I sit in a hot tub, and get me some happy on
Stopped by a cop and asked for ID
He said "Stick to the limit." I said "Bitch, I can't hardly read"
I got hot tub blues
I got red hot shoes
I got need for some fun
I got beer and guns
I got hot tub blues
I got red hot shoes
I got need for some fun
I got beer and guns
(She's got hot tub blues
Red hot shoes
Need for some fun
Beer and guns
She's got hot tub blues
Red hot shoes
Need for some fun
Beer and guns)
Ma'am, I'm gonna need to see some ID. Ma'am, I'm gonna need you to step out of the vehicle. Ma'am, I need you to put the bottle down. Ma'am? Ma'am? Ma'am, I'm gonna need to -
Hotter than hell in a nuclear sky
I need me a drink but I don't need a DUI
It's hotter than hell in a nuclear sky
I need me a drink but I don't need a DUI
I got hot tub blues
I got red hot shoes
I got need for some fun
Beer and guns
I got hot tub blues
I got red hot shoes
I got need for some fun
I got beer and guns
(She's got hot tub blues
Red hot shoes
Need for some fun
Beer and guns
She's got hot tub blues
Red hot shoes
Need for some fun
