I've been broken, shut down and useless
Feet above me hands in the air
You got me falling over and over
You got me twisted tied up and tangled
I do it all for you
You know I've been a fool for you
Thought I tripped on a shoelace
I look down and it's only you
Now i'm standing at a terminal waiting to connect to another plane
If I told you I just cancelled my flight to America
Would you call me insane?
Everything i am has been neatly contained
Into the contents of a Samsonite bag
Me a laptop two suitcases and I'm coming to see you
Whether you like it or not
Whether you like it or not
I've been put down
Picked up and put off
I've been held up
Pushed and shoved around
You got me falling
Over and over
I've been drifting this side and upside down
I do it all for you
You know I'd be a fool for you
I keep thinking I lost something
I look down and it's only you
You might also likeAnd now I'm standing at a terminal waiting to connect to another plane
And if I told you I just cancelled my flight to America
Would you call me insane?
Everything i am has been neatly contained into the
Contents of a Samsonite bag
Me a laptop two suitcases and I'm coming to see you
Whether you like it or not
How many forms can indecision take?
When does the warning light appear before a man breaks?
Mine is a restless heart don't try to fix it
You know sometimes, sometimes I want it to ache
Everything I am has been neatly contained into the
Contents of a Samsonite bag
Me a laptop two suitcases and I'm coming to see you
And now I'm standing at a terminal waiting to connect to another plane
And if I told you I just cancelled my flight to america
Would you call me insane
Everything I am has been neatly contained into the
Contents of a Samsonite bag
Me a laptop two suitcases and I'm coming to see you
Whether you like it or not
I'm coming to see you whether you're ready or not
I'm coming to feel you babe whether you like it or not
Get ready cause I'm coming to see you whether you like it or not
Coming to see you whether you like it or not
Whether you like it or not
I know I know I know I know you're gone
I can see you babe
It's too late baby
I know I know I know you're gone
It's too late babe
Ooh I know you're gone
I know I know I know I know you're gone
It's too late baby
I know I know I know you're gone
It's too late babe
