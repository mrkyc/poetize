I've cracked
My temper's spat
Hot coal, fire and acid jack
I've been used I feel abused
Something you've done has lit my fuse
And I take my theories back
Maybe Karma ain't all that
Coz you do whatever you please
Everybody else is left to bleed

You're a heart attack
Your heart is black
It's whack
Your mind is jacked
How did anybody ever get like that?
You're a heart attack
You stabbed me in the back
If you pull your punches jack
I'm taking everything back
You hit me harder than a heart attack

We used to stick together
You and me stay that way forever
But now to my surprise
You've become what we despised
What's that they're telling me?
Sleeping with the enemy!
Going down on dirty sheets
Didn't nobody tell you how to be discreet?
You might also like
You're a heart attack
And your heart is black
It's whack
You're mind is stacked
Tell me how did anybody ever get like that?
You're a heart attack
You stabbed me in the back
If you pull your punches jack
I'm taking everything back
You hit me harder than a heart attack

You're dancing while I'm dying
Laughing while I'm crying
Denying the mess you made
Your true colors are clashing
This airplane is crashing
It's smashing
Were you even there?
Coz I don't think you care
About anyone but yourself now

Go run but you can't hide
Actions they can't be denied
Once thing keeps buggin' me
Tell me how you sleep at night
I need to set things right
Shake things up
Modify
Change plans and break the rules
Play the game like you do fool
You're a heart attack
And your heart is black
It's whack
You're mind is stacked
Tell me how did anybody ever get like that?
You're a heart attack
You stabbed me in the back
If you pull your punches jack
I'm taking everything back
