For making me feel worthwhile
Sweeter than the honey of your lips
And kindness in your smile
Hand in hand we float across the room
Explosions deep inside
Cheek to cheek, there's clouds under my feet
There's only you and I
Please tell me what you like
Does that feel nice
Give me a sign
If you love it I can do it again
We've got the rest of the night
To get it right
Please tell me what you like
If that feels nice give me a sign
If you love it I can do it again
We've got the rest of our lives
To get it right
Lookin' back on lonely nights
Searching for love again
I never knew my journey began
And ended with you my friend
Softer than your butterfly kisses
And stronger than my desire
I wanna thank you my friend
For making me feel alive

We've got the rest of our lives
To get it right
I'll never mess it up again
Won't let it slip like grains of sand
Through careless fingertips because
I'm a man who understands
Though burned by the fire
I can learn to feel the light again
And listen I can hear your demands
I know I can do it give me one more chance
Baby here I am
