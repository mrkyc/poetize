That as every second passes, there is a moment gone
In 23 hours the Sun is gonna set forever
Would you huge a little tighter, would you let go first?
Would you focus on love and then forget the hurt?
Living the moment I wish your life away
How will you spend your last night on earth?
Will you kiss your enemies, say sorry first?
Will you take enough time to say your last goodbyes?
All the little battles that you never won
All the music in the opera that you never sang
Emotions that were silenced all these years
You can't smell the roses when you're gone
You can't smell the roses
No it's not a rehearsal
You only get one life so make it right
You can't smell the roses when you're gone
So live every moment
Like it's the last night on Earth
Cuz this is the last night on Earth
What if I told you that I have regrets
I would trade in all my happiness for one last kiss
For a minute or two lying by your side...
What if I chose over nobody more
If I uttered all my promises with empty talk
If I knew back then the things that I know now...
I would tell you that I love you, that we all get low
There are peaks and there valleys you've got to know
A second chance it rarely comes around...

You can't smell the roses
No it's not a rehearsal
You only get one life so make it right
You can't smell the roses when you're gone
So live every moment
Like it's the last night on Earth
If I could have my time again
I would make sure you knew just how I felt
Somewhere I wait for much too long
And the season changes without me...
You can't smell the roses when you're gone
You can't smell the roses
No it's not a rehearsal
You only get one life so make it right
You can't smell the roses when you're gone
So live every moment
Like it's the last night on Earth
Cause it's the last night on Earth
