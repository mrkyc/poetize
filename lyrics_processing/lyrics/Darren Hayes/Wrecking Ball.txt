Take me down where the city never sleeps
Where the heart is in the people
And the people call the big shots
I'll go 'round 'cause my love is pretty tall
I will tease them from their houses
I will find them on the floor
O, whoa, like a demolition crew
Oh whoa, I will find a way to you
Oh whoa, oh, oh, oh, whoa, oh, whoa, oh, oh
I'll go 'round like a wrecking ball
Just say that you love me, say that you love me
I'll go 'round, I'll break down the walls
'Til you say that you love me, say that you love me
Just like a wrecking ball
Call me up to the highest point of view
Where the sun is always shining
And the love is such a long shot
I swoop down with my fingers in your heart
I will whisper you a melody that's been there from the start
Oh whoa, all the fortresses you build
Oh whoa, gotta see them tumbling
Oh whoa, oh, oh, oh, whoa, oh, whoa, oh, oh

Just say that you love me, say that you love me
I'll go 'round, I'll break down the walls
'Til you say that you love me, say that you love me
Just like a wrecking ball
There'd be nobody else that identifies in me
But your rejection is a turn-on
So segregated, so plain to see
I've been a fighter since the day I was born
I may not get what I want
But I might get what I need
Oh, oh, oh, whoa, oh, whoa, oh, oh
I'll go 'round like a wrecking ball
Just say that you love me, say that you love me
I'll go 'round, I'll break down the walls
Until the dirty streets feel the carnage of my love
'Round like a wrecking ball
Just say that you love me, say that you love me
(Just like a wrecking ball)
I'll go 'round, I'll break down the walls
'Til you say that you love me, say that you love me
(Just like a wrecking ball)
I'll go 'round like a wrecking ball
Just say that you love me, say that you love me
(Just like a wrecking ball)
I'll go 'round, I'll break down the walls
'Til you say that you love me, say that you love me
(Just like a wrecking ball)
Oh, oh, oh, whoa, oh, whoa, oh, oh
