I put Eurythmics on
Poppin' and lockin' in the USA
Day-Glo sweater tied around my neck
Studded denim big hair acid wash
Rubik's cube my boom box
You know it's alright
I promise you tonight
All you gotta do is
Choose life
Got a little crush
Ooh I just can't get enough of that stuff
It's such a rush oh whoah whoah whoah whoah (1980 me)
Got a little crush
Ooh I just can't get enough of that stuff
It's such a rush oh whoah whoah whoah (1980 me)
Frosted lipstick parachute pants
Doc Martins dead can dance
Culture Club The Go Go's
Pretty In Pink PacMan Asteroids
Miami Vice too early for Vanilla Ice
Crimpin' the poodle
Perm and blond highlights
You might also likeYou know it's alright
I promise you tonight
All you gotta say is
Have a nice day
Got a little crush
Ooh I just can't get enough of that stuff
It's such a rush oh whoah whoah whoah whoah (1980 me)
Got a little crush
Ooh I just can't get enough of that stuff
It's such a rush oh whoah whoah whoah whoah (1980 me)
Dance baby
You know you're gonna have such a good time
Welcome to 1980 me
Dance baby
You know it's gonna be alright
Welcome to 1980 me
I wish that I could be eleven again
That ET was my friend
You know that life was so simple then
Times have changed
Never be the same
The memory remains
And the melody inside my heart
You know it's alright
No matter how it goes
All you gotta do is just say no
Got a little crush
Ooh I just can't get enough of that stuff
It's such a rush oh whoah whoah whoah whoah (1980 me)
Got a little crush
Ooh I just can't get enough of that stuff
It's such a rush oh whoah whoah whoah whoah (1980 me)
Dance baby
You know you're gonna have such a good time
Welcome to 1980 me
Dance baby
You know it's gonna be alright
