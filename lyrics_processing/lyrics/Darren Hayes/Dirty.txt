You're lookin' like first class
Acting like a cheap date
Honey drippin' smile
So stylin' bet you know what you do
Don't you baby
Eyes that penetrate
Heat that denigrates lust communicates
I can hardly wait to get to you
And show you baby

If you want to I can be dirty too
I can spin you around pick you up and go
Down
If you want to
I can be just like you
And do the dirty things you do

Walk into a room imperceptible boom tight shot close zoom
When you move it's
Assumed you feel it too
Don't you baby
Tickin' like a fuse there's an itch i
Gotta scratch ten minutes in a room get this monkey off my back
Any dark space would do to show you baby
You might also like
If you want to I can be dirty too
I can spin you around pick you up and go
Down
If you want to I can be just like you
And do the dirty things you do

Why don't you tell me your sign
I hear we're two of a kind
Scorpio I been told
You're my most compatible ride
Let me tell you again
You make me wanna pop!
Jack into the movie inside my brain
I never wanna stop
Can you do that again
You make me wanna bam!
Shut the blinds baby
Let the door slam
Intergalactic super bombastic
Go from the top baby
Don't ever stop 'till i tell you to

If you want to I can be dirty too
I can spin you around pick you up even go
Down
If you want to I can be just like you and be dirty too
Scorpio I been told you're my most compatible ride
Fade to black commercial break
This is where the censor kicks in
I think you better close your eyes
Block your ears
