I got something I wanna tell you
If you're there pick up
It's no big deal I'm just so lonely
You see I had a dream last night my entire life washed up
There was a terrible flood, the Ventura Freeway was covered in my stuff
Hey Matt
The water carried all my secrets
Sifting through the muck I saw my dirty little grievances
And the memories I killed
All the shameful feelings spilled
Lay bare on the asphalt
Broken parts I thought I'd drowned real good
One time as a way to survive I decided to be king
But the crown dug into my skin and that gold turned out to be tin
Poison seeping into my brain until the only thing to remain
Is the last bit of innocence
I hope I can save it
I hope I can save it
One time as a way to survive I decided to be king
But the crown dug into my skin and that gold turned out to be tin
Hey Matt
You know the monsters in the ocean?
It turns out they're real
Guess they were underneath the surface
Tailing me like a shark getting dizzy and drunk on my blood
And all this time they were deep beneath the wave that used to carry me on high

I'm stranded on a traffic island
Six car pile up and flashing lights so many sirens
I don't recognize my skin or the bones that creak within
I am tired all the time
A sexless, frail, scared and weak little man
One time as a way to survive I decided to be king
But the crown dug into my skin and that gold turned out to be tin
Poison seeping into my brain until the only thing to remain
Is the last bit of innocence
I hope I can save it
I hope I can save it
One time as a way to survive I decided to be king
But the crown dug into my skin and that gold turned out to be tin
Hey Matt
I'm somewhere on the 101 South
I guess I broke down
There's bits of plastic and glass all around
And it cuts into my feet
And this mud is sickeningly sweet
But what the flood dredged up doesn't seem so bad under tungsten lights
Hey Matt
I think I'm gonna cut my losses
Cause when I look at this stuff there's nothing left I wanna process
There's some hurt and revenge I could take
And my Daddy issues still ache
But they're just so heavy I think I'll leave them here for someone else to claim
To claim
To claim
One time as a way to survive I decided to be king
But the crown dug into my skin and that gold turned out to be tin
Poison seeping into my brain until the only thing to remain
Is the last bit of innocence
I hope I can save it
I hope I can save it
One time as a way to survive I decided to be king
But the crown dug into my skin and that gold turned out to be tin
Hey Matthew
I think I should tell you
I spend my life hiding behind a tree complaining
Nobody wants to play with me
A selfish kind of irony
I'm so fucking lonely
But I won't let you in
If you're out there rescue me
If you're out there come and see me
It's not how it's meant to be
If you're out there come and rescue me
It's the ending of all of me
If you're out there come and rescue me
If you're out there come and see me
