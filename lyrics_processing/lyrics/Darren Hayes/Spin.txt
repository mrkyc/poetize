Politically correct isn't that a joke?
We censor music then give children guns
On CNN Still fightin' to death over Jerusalem
Four letter disease still makes us run
Can't comprehend that you can die from Love
Can I start things over
And change your mind
Can I sing a melody
Press rewind
Can I move your feet
Make your heart skip a beat
Can a simple tune flow through you?
When the music feels like this
When you lose control you gotta go with it
Ten feet high
Flyin' above the sky
Your problems don't exist
When music feels like this
No money left in Africa
Starvin' to death in Bosnia
We close our eyes and hide a nation cries
And in the West
TV Possessed and weight obsessed
The media dissects, infects
We think real life is reality TV

And Press rewind
When the DJ spins
Will it change your mind?
Can I move your feet
Make your heart skip a beat
Can a piece of me
Flow through you?
When the music feels like this
When you lose control you gotta go with it
Ten feet high
Flying above the sky
Your problems don't exist
When music feels like this
When the Music feels like this
DJ take control
And Grab a hold of me
Spin that wheel
Tell me how to feel
I like the shape I'm in
When music feels like this
Bringin' the beat back
Stompin' the floor
Dancin' like a booty never bounced before
Poppin' to the back beat
Up on the one
Smack Jack Freakin' now you're overcome
When the music feels like this
When you lose control you gotta go with it
Ten feet high
Flying above the sky
Your problems don't exist
When music feels like this
When the Music feels like this
DJ take control
And Grab a hold of me Spin that wheel
Tell me how to feel
I like the shape I'm in
When music feels like this
Let the music in Let the
DJ spin Let the music in
Coz the music should feel like this
