For I don't need them anymore
Go switch off the stars and paint the sky black
Love isn't ever coming back
There's no use in imagining a world without you
Your love was like a drug I was addicted to
Cause there's nobody else who can hurt like you hurt me
I don't want to be lonely
And there's no other way, there's no joy, there's no meaning
Just this hollowed out feeling
Now all the love's gone and nothing grows here
And I just feel wrong, so black out the sun
And all that we shared will slowly disappear
There's a hole where my soul used to grow
So just black out the sun
No, stop all the rain and poison the ground
Love doesn't want to hang around
Go, turn all the fruits into bitter wine
It was only sweet when you were mine
There is an emptiness inside of me
Since you've been gone
All the world has lost it's meaning
All my color's run
You might also likeCause there's nobody else who can hurt like you hurt me
I don't want to be lonely
And there's no other way, there's no joy, there's no meaning
Just this hollowed out feeling
Now all the love's gone and nothing grows here
And I just feel wrong, so black out the sun
And all that we shared will slowly disappear
There's a hole where my soul used to grow
So just black out the sun, sun, oh, whoa
Now nothing compares, how could it even dare
Cause now that love's gone, I want to black out the sun
Cause there's nobody else who could hurt like you hurt me
I don't want to be lonely
And there is no other way, there's no joy, there's no meaning
Just this hollowed out feeling
Now all the love's gone and nothing grows here
And I just feel wrong, so black out the sun
And all that we shared will slowly disappear
There's a hole where my soul used to grow
