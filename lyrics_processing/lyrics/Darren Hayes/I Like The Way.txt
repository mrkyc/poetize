Looking for love in physical beauty
Desire is the drug of the bourgeoisie
And now I try to intellectualize
Like a glimmer of good in a bad man's eyes
I am consumed by the flesh haunting me
I know temptation taunts the empty
So pour yourself over me
Until there's nothing left to see
Because I like the way you move in the dark
I like the tension, the tension and the spark
The decadence of giving in to desire
Creates such entropy within
Looking for love in the spiritual faces
Blind to the art of fabrication
I'm like a baby sucking mamma's milk
Wanna drink my fill and then some
Leave me alone
I always thought I was better than this
But temptation tempts the temptee
Pour yourself over me
Until there's nothing left to see
Because I like the way you move in the dark
And I like the tension, the tension and the spark
You might also likeBecause I like the way you move in the dark
You know I like the tension, the tension and, the tension the spark
This physicality
Shifting me chemically
Such power over me
It's just desire
I know it's trickery
I know it's just skin deep
I know I should resist
I'm just too tired
Too tired
There's just one thing missing
One thing missing here is love
I like the way you move in the dark
I like the tension, the tension and the spark
(so pour yourself over me)
You know I like the way you move in the dark
(so pour yourself over me)
You know I like the tension, the tension and, the tension the spark
So pour yourself over me (yeah, yeah, yeah)
(there's just one thing missing, one thing missing)
Until there's nothing left to see (yeah, yeah, yeah)
So pour yourself over me
(there's just one thing missing, one thing missing)
So pour yourself over me
(I like the tension, the tension and the spark)
