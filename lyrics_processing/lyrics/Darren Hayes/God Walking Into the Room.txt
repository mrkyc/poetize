Cut in two like Earth and the sky
I say a prayer in the distance
That my faith in love will survive
My friends tell me
I should look around
For somebody new
But they don't know you
They don't understand the gravity
I've fallen into
Cause I still feel you
Cause you bring me love
You lift me up
And every time we kiss is like
God walking into the room
Forgive me, love
Can't give you up
Every time we kiss is like
God walking into the room
Can I make a confession?
I'm lighting candles for you and I
I pray for a love resurrection
And all the things we lost in the fire
You might also likeOh, my friends tell me
I should look around
For somebody new
But they don't know you
They don't look into your eyes
Or tremble like I do
Every time I see you
Cause you bring me love
You lift me up
Every time we kiss is like
God walking into the room
Forgive me, love
Can't give you up
Hand upon the Bible
Your love is survival, I tell you
I've never felt this before
My soul never falls to the floor
You look right to me
Like God walking into the room
Like it's meant to be
You and I, we were splintered
Cut in two like earth and the sea
I say a prayer that in the distance
My faith in love will bring you back to me
You bring me love
You lift me up
And every time we kiss is like
God walking into the room
Forgive me, love
Can't you give up
My hand's upon the Bible
Your love is survival, I tell you
I've never felt this before
My soul never falls to the floor
You look right to me
Like God walking into the room
