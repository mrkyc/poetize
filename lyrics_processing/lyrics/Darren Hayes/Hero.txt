Outside, confidence is king
I am all that you're projecting
Inside, feel the rising tide
And the revolutions deafening

I was trying to hide
My opposing side
Trying to reconcile
My Jekyll and Hyde

Ladies and gentlemen, listen up please
I don't wanna be your hero
No, I am not open
Parts of me are broken
Do yourself a favor, save yourself
Don't pick me, find someone else
Why'd you want to bother?
Find yourself another

Sometimes you put all of your desires
In an object of affection
But in time, because you idolize
There is only disappointment
You might also like
I was flying so high
In your perfect sky
But I needed to fall
Cannot have it all

Ladies and gentlemen, listen up please
I don't wanna be your hero
No, I am not open
Parts of me are broken
Do yourself a favor, save yourself
Don't pick me, find someone else
Why'd you want to bother?
Find yourself another
Ladies and gentlemen, (Listen) listen up please
I don't wanna be your hero (Don't wanna be your hero)
No, I am not open (Oh, no)
Parts of me are broken
Do yourself a favor, (Save yourself) save yourself
Don't pick me, find someone else (Someone else)
Why'd you want to bother?
Find yourself another

Don't need to compromise
I don't need to occupy that floor
There's a danger in boxing in my sin
And all that I am...
It's too much pressure
I'll only let you down again
No, I am not open
Parts of me are broken
It's too much pressure
I'll only let you down again
Why'd you want to bother?
Find yourself another

It's too much pressure
Ladies and gentlemen, listen up please (Listen please)
I'll only let you down again
I don't wanna be your hero (Oh, no)
No, I am not open
Parts of me are broken
It's too much pressure (Oh)
Ladies and gentlemen, listen up please (Oh, no)
I'll only let you down again (Down again)
I don't wanna be your hero
Why'd you wanna bother?
Find yourself another
Ooh It's too much pressure
Ladies and gentlemen, listen up please (Listen please)
I'll only let you down again
I don't wanna be your hero
No, I am not open
Parts of me are broken
Ooh It's too much pressure
Ladies and gentlemen, listen up please
I'll only let you down again
I don't wanna be your hero
Why'd you wanna bother?
Find yourself another
Ooh It's too much pressure
Ladies and gentlemen, listen up please (Listen please)
I'll only let you down again
