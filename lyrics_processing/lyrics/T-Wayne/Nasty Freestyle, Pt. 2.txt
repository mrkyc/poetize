First, let me hop out the- fuck that, this the Bentley
Got a multicolored semi
Made a milli', came from pennies
Peter Parker, I got Benjis
Put a bad bitch in some Fenti
If it's smoke, we gon' bring it to his house like I'm a chimney
This was meant to be, this was meant for me
She got good brain mentally
I gave her all my Fetty, she got WAP like she was meant to sing
Fresh bald head, choppas spray shit like I'm Mr. Clean
Not a scientist, but me and your bitch got chemistry

Got twin glockies, I just called it Even Stevens
Put the heater to his shirt, I call it dry cleanin'
Keep the burner on me, jewelry coated in anemic
Shorty wanna give me butt and head, but I just called it Beavis
She wanna show me the cleavage
Diamonds be dancin' like Breezy
I got her wetted in Fiji
They got me feelin' like Yeezy
Yeah, I'm a Christian, but I pull up in the demon
I don't think they ever seen it
Hop out the Porsche, cash
Pussy good, I bought her more ass
Deliver the beef to your crib, I call it Doordash
Got a .10 with me every time that I pop out
Ain't with the maid service, but we pull the mops out
Used to be the Porsche, now the Bentley what I hop out
He ain't get the picture with my shooter, now he cropped out
She throwin' that ass
I should've been on the track the way that I'm doing the dash
I might pull up in the Tesla
But I'm still blowin' on gas
Might take her out if she bad
If she got groceries, then I'm gon' come with a bag
Mama come in through the back
