Didn't wanna make you run around
Cause it seems I tripped up once again
Lying on the ground again
Staring up into a cloud of questions why
Blurry visions of tired eyes
Got a lot of things that I need to say
Got a lot of things that I need to
Find a way to rest my head
Just trying to clear my eyes
Why'd I let you walk away?
Why'd I let you walk away?
Cause I'm thinking it's you
I've been thinking bout you everyday
Now I see you walking around my way
So, easing into your embrace
It's like you never went away
Glow, like you can't escape the rays
You're brave enough to save the day
Love, hoping we can make it stay
Coming to you for your embrace
Why did you leave so soon?
Didn't wanna make you run around
Cause it seems i tripped up once again
Now I'm lying down again
Staring up into a cloud of questions why
Blurry visions of tight eyes
Gotta love things that I need to see
Gotta love the things that I need to
Find a way to rest my head
Just trying to rest my eyes
Why'd I let you walk away
Why'd let you walk away
Cause I'm digging soon
I've been thinking bout you everyday
See you walking 'round my way
So easy into your embrace
It's like it never went away
I can't escape away
Feeling left to save the day
Love hoping we can make it stay
Coming through to your embrace
I've been thinking bout you everyday
I see you I can run my away
So easy into your embrace
It's like you never went away
I can't escape away
Feeling left to save the day
Love hoping it can make its way
Coming through to your embrace
I've been thinking bout you everyday
I see you walking 'round my way
So easy into your embrace
It's like you never went away
I can't escape away
Feeling left to save the day
Love hoping we can make is stay
