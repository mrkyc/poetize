Then I'm gonna make you run around
Cause it seems i tripped up once again
Stand up and get caught questions right
A lot of visions of tight eyes
Got a lot of things that I need to say
Got a lot of things that I need to find a way to rest my head
Just I need to close my eyes
Why don't you walk away
Why don't you walk away
Cause I'm thinking it's you
I've been thinking 'bout you everyday
See you... ing on my way
So easy get to your embrace
It's like you never went away, oh
Like a mistake you made
I'm feeling I could save the day
Warming in your embrace
Follow through the hollow race
Didn't wanna make you run around
Cause it seems that you died once again
Not lying down again
Stair open
Blurry visions of tight eyes
Gotta love things that I need to see
Gotta love the things that I need too
Flying to rest my head
Just trying to cut my eyes
Gotta let you walk away
Better let you walk away
Cause I'm thinking it's you
I've been thinking bout you everyday
I see you I can run my away
So easing into your embrace
It's like you never went away
I can't escape away
Feeling left to save the day
Love hoping it can make its way
I've been falling for you babe
You might also likeI've been thinking bout you everyday

So easing into your embrace
It's like you never went away
I can't escape away
Feeling left to save the day
Love hoping it can make its way
I've been falling for you babe
I've been thinking bout you everyday
I see you I can run my away
So easing into your embrace
It's like you never went away
I can't escape away
Feeling left to save the day
Love hoping it can make its way
