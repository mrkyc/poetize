Could breathe and leave a trail of galaxies
And dream of me?
What kind of love
Is writing my story till the end
With mercy's pen?
Only you
What kind of king
Would choose to wear a crown
That bleeds and scars
To win my heart
What kind of love
Tells me I'm the reason He can't stay
Inside the grave
You, is it You?
Standing here before my eyes
Every part of my heart cries
I am his because he is
Emmanuel, the promised king
The baby who made angels sing
Son of man who walked with us
Healing, breathing in our dust
The author of all history
The answer to all mysteries
The lamb of God who rolled away
The stone in front of every grave

Look what mercy's overcome
Death has lost and love has won
Alive, alive
Hallelujah, risen Lord
The only One I fall before
I am his because he is
Alive
Who could speak
And send the demons back from where they came
With just one name?
What other heart
Would let itself to be broken every time
Until he healed mine?
You, only you
Could turn my darkness into dawn
Running right into your arms
I am His because He is
Emmanuel, the promised king
The baby who made angels sing
Son of man who walked with us
Healing, breathing in our dust
