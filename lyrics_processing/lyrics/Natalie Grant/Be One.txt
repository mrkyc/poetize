We don't feel ready, we don't feel steady, wuestion what we really have to give
Stay where it's safer, claim faith, but waiver, is this how we really meant to live?
We pray, but never move
We say, but never do

It's time to get our hands dirty, oh, oh, oh, oh
Be love, there's a whole lot of hurting, oh, oh, oh, oh
Calling all hearts, calling all hands
Calling all feet to take a stand
Why sit around and wait for a miracle to come
When we can be one?
When we can be one
When we can be one

A little somethin'
Might feel like nothin'
But in His hands, it's all we'll ever need
To speak life to the broken
Watch the blind eyes open
It's who He's calling you and me to be

It's time to get our hands dirty, oh, oh, oh, oh
Be love, there's a whole lot of hurting, oh, oh, oh, oh
Calling all hearts, calling all hands
Calling all feet to take a stand
Why sit around and wait for a miracle to come
When we can be one?
When we can be one
You might also like
We can be the change, be the hope
We can be the arms that don't let go
We can be a light in the dark
We are, we are where it starts

It's time, oh, oh, oh oh
Be love, there's a whole lot of hurting, oh, oh, oh, oh
Calling all hearts, calling all hands
Calling all feet to take a stand
Why sit around and wait for a miracle to come
When we can be one?
When we can be one
When we can be one

We can be the change, be the hope, yeah
We can be the arms that don't let go
