Your love is devoted
Like a ring of solid gold
Like a vow that is tested
Like a covenant of old
Your love is enduring
Through the winter rain
And beyond the horizon
With mercy for today

Faithful You have been
And faithful You will be
You pledge Yourself to me
And it's why I sing

Your praise will
Ever be on my lips
Ever be on my lips
Your praise will
Ever be on my lips
Ever be on my lips
Your praise will
Ever be on my lips
Ever be on my lips
Your praise will
Ever be on my lips
Ever be on my lips
You might also like
You Father the orphan
And Your kindness makes us whole
And You shoulder our weakness
Your strength becomes our own
Now You're making me like You
Clothing me in white
Bringing beauty from ashes
For You will have Your Bride

Free of all her guilt
And rid of all her shame
And known by her true name
And it's why I sing

Your praise will
Ever be on my lips
Ever be on my lips
Your praise will
Ever be on my lips
Ever be on my lips
Your praise will
Ever be on my lips
Ever be on my lips
Your praise will
Ever be on my lips
Ever be on my lips!

Worthy are You Lord
