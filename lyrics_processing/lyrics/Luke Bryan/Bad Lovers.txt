Sun coming up through the blinds on your pretty face
I'm just laying in these tangled sheets, watching you walk away
We been deep in love, all messed up, and everything in between
From fly to fall, we tried it all
Girl, we been a lot of things

But baby, we ain't never been
Baby, we ain't never been bad lovers
Love, we can laugh it off
We both know we're better off, under covers
Yeah, we might not string all the good times together
But one thing's certain, not one time never, no
Baby, we ain't never been
Baby, we ain't never been bad lovers
Not one time, baby

Weather man calling for rain on Saturday
Girl, what you got goin' on, your place or my place?
When its tapping on the roof, ain't nothing like you
Doing what you do to me
When the lightning hits, I'll be kissing on your lips
Girl, the rest is history
