You're not looking for anything more than a
Good time and an open door
A good band and a dance floor
Then she walks in
You got a pickup line to throw, but
She walks up and says "hello"
Before you can even let it go
She's got you reeled in

You can't escape it if you wanted to
You don't know what you got yourself into

You're blindfolded yo
Walking south down the whiskey tracks
She's rolling north like a neon train
Bolt of lightning in the night
Speed of light, you won't realize
You've been struck 'til you see the flame
Her smile'll slice you to the heart
There you are in the back of a bar
Bleeding, but you feel no pain
She won't cut you like a knife, like a knife
That little look in her eyes'll
Cut you like a razor blade
You wait

You ain't used to playing by these rules
So you sit there and try to play it cool
Do your best not to play the fool
But it's too late now
You wanna see how far she'll let you go
She'll let you think you're in control

You're blindfolded
Walking south down the whiskey tracks
She's rolling north like a neon train
Bolt of lightning in the night
Speed of light, you won't realize
You been struck 'til you see the flame
Her smile'll slice you to the heart
There you are in the back of a bar
Bleeding, but you feel no pain
She won't cut you like a knife, like a knife
That little look in her eyes'll
Cut you like a razor blade

You can't escape it if you wanted to
You don't know what you got yourself into
You're blindfolded
Walking south down the whiskey tracks
She's rolling north like a neon train
Bolt of lightning in the night
Speed of light, you won't realize
You been struck 'til you see the flame
Her smile'll slice you to the heart
There you are in the back of a bar
Bleeding, but you feel no pain
She won't cut you like a knife, like a knife
That little look in her eyes'll
Cut you like a razor blade
She won't cut you like a knife, like a knife
That little look in her eyes'll
Cut you like a razor blade
Cut you like a razor blade
