Ain't no doors and no windows
Just a roll bar and a radio
If it rains you're gonna get wet
But that old 302 ain't let me down yet

It's a cutout picture of the 70's
When everything felt so free

It's yellow and a little bit of rust
Looking good for 42 years young
Ten sets of tires, a hundred bonfires
And it can still light up a backroad
It was built for a day like this
A clear blue sky and a white sand kiss
It's three on the tree and geared down for going slow
My ol' Bronco

I flipped it over up on Arnold Hill
Turned it back over and fixed the grill
You know where I been by that old oil spot
Most times it's in the beach bar parking lot
See Luke Bryan LiveGet tickets as low as $14You might also like
No it ain't hard to pick me out
Cause it's the only one in this town

It's yellow and a little bit of rust
Looking good for 42 years young
Ten sets of tires, a hundred bonfires
And it can still light up a backroad
It was built for a day like this
A clear blue sky and a white sand kiss
It's three on the tree and geared down for going slow
No, I ain't gonna ever let her go
My ol' Bronco

Yeah it's yellow and a little bit of rust
Looking good for 42 years young
Ten sets of tires, a hundred bonfires
And it can still light up a backroad
It was built for a day like this
A clear blue sky and a white sand kiss
It's three on the tree and geared down for going slow
No I ain't gonna ever let her go
My ol' Bronco
