Running kind of late, got her makeup half on
Touch it up good enough
Oh, whatever
All her girlfriends waiting outside on her
They've been blowing up her phone
Girl come on, get yourself together
Got her hands up, she's so ready with her driver on the way
Skips the damn line, she ain't even gotta pay

She starts feeling the buzz about shot one
Hips starts swaying when the DJ drops one
She's in against the law, call the cops one
She might be a mess but she's a hot one
With her little jeans and white tee
She might rev up an old boy's heart or even stop one
Putting on a show tonight, letting go tonight
She might be a mess, but she's a hot one

She's dancing like every guy in here ain't watching her
Do her thang, make it rain
God to mighty
She's breaking necks, got them spilling beer
Putting that bartender through a year or two of Junior college
She's about to get them Dolce Vita's on the bar
It's all but all over the minute she starts

Feeling the buzz about shot one
Hips starts swaying when the DJ drops one
She's in against the law, call the cops one
She might be a mess but she's a hot one
With her little jeans and white tee
She might rev up an old boy's heart or even stop one
Putting on a show tonight, letting go tonight
She might be a mess, but she's a hot one

Like the summer heat where she comes from
She's burning me down
Just look at her now
Just look at her now
(She's so hot)
(She's so hot)
(She's so hot)

She starts feeling the buzz about shot one
Hips starts swaying when the DJ drops one
She's in against the law, call the cops one
Yeah, she might be a mess but she's a hot one
With her little jeans and white tee
She might rev up an old boy's heart or even stop one
Putting on a show tonight, letting go tonight
