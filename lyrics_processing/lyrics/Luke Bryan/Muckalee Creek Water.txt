It flows underneath the 32 bridge
And cuts through the heart of South Georgia
Big copperheads and mean wild pigs
And gators in the weeds waiting for ya
I leave my phone in the truck
I leave my truck at the road
My four-wheeler gets me where I wanna go
I leave the world behind
I pull my hat down low
Get back to my roots, by a full moon glow

I got an old Jon boat that I stowed down there
On them hot summer nights when I get a-wild hare
I got a moonshine stash in a cypress stump
And a catfish line going - bump bump
An old tractor tire where I sit by the fire
And drink to a sweet swamp song
So if you're looking for me, don't even bother
When I dip my feet in that Muckalee Creek water

Daddy brought me down here when I was a kid
Taught me how to bait a craw fish basket
From the time I was old enough to walk
He had me running down squirrels and rabbits
I feel right at home in this neck of the woods
If this was all I had, I'd be living good
So let the stock market do what it's gonna do
Let the dollar go down and gas over the roof

And drink to a sweet swamp song
So if you're looking for me, don't even bother
When I dip my feet in that Muckalee Creek water

I'm free, and I'm me
Being everything that I wanna be
Nobody jacking with me
No sign of the city lights
Hell with the city lights!

I got a moonshine stash in a cypress stump
And a catfish line going - bump bump bump
An old tractor tire where I sit by the fire
And drink to a sweet swamp song
So if you're looking for me, don't even holler
When I get down deep in that Muckalee Creek water
