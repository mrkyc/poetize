Woah, woah-whoa
Mm-mm

If I could make a livin' from walkin' in the woods
You can bet I'd be sittin' pretty good
High on a hill lookin' at a field downwind
If I could make a nickel off a turning 'em bass
Never worry about the price of gas
I'd be wheelin' and dealin' and sittin' there reeling 'em in

Huntin', fishin' and lovin' every day
That's the prayer that a country boy prays
Thank God He made me this way
Huntin', and fishin' and lovin' every day
Early in the morning, late in the evening
I'm gettin' red dirt rich and Flint River paid
Huntin', fishin' and lovin' every day

I'd get a little Farm Pond bus
Sound of gravel when I'm backin' up
Pullin' the string on a nine point nine two stroke, mercury
I love it when my baby wants to roll with me
Throws her boots on, climbs in a tree
Tuckin' her hair in my hat and she's ready to go

And we get to huntin', fishin', lovin' every day
That's the prayer that a country boy prays
Thank God He made me this way
Huntin', and fishin' and lovin' every day
Early in the morning, late in the evening
I'm getting red dirt rich, and Flint River pay
Huntin' and fishin' and lovin' every day, yeah
Woo

So while y'all are up there
Breathin' in that old dirty air
I'll be down here, knee deep, in the Muckalee (Ha)
Huntin' and fishin', lovin' every day
I wanna see them tall pines sway
Y'all close them eyes
Lets go there in our mind

Huntin' and fishin' and lovin' every day
That's the prayer this country boy prays
Thank God He made me this way
Huntin' and fishin' and lovin' every day
Black coffee in the morning, dark whiskey in the evening
I get red dirt rich and Flint River pay
Huntin' and fishin' and lovin' every day (Woo)
Come on
Won't you come along with me
Won't you come along with me
I know you wanna see
