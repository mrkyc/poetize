We were small-town meant to be
My momma loved her, her daddy loved me
We burned up the road between her house and mine
We kissed in her driveway
And by the time I hit the highway
She called to tell me goodnight one more time

And she'd say, "Love you, miss you, mean it
Boy, I'll see you when I'm dreamin'
I can't wait to feel you hold me again
Till then I'll be countin' down the minutes
I'll be climbin' up these walls
Your kiss, I want it, need it
Love you, miss you, mean it, baby"

When graduation came
UGA was callin' her name
We thought two hundred miles wasn't nothin' we couldn't get through
But after that first fall
The time got longer between the calls
And I couldn't help but wonder what happened to

My little love you, miss you, mean it
Girl, I'll see you when I'm dreamin'
I can't wait to feel you hold me again
Till then I'll be countin' down the minutes
I'll be climbin' up these walls
Your kiss, I want it, need it
Love you, miss you, mean it, baby, yeah
(Woo, uh)

Years went by
Pages got turned
But I never did forget about her
Late one night out of the blue
My phone lit up and my heart did too

She said, "I don't know about you
But I love you, miss you, meant it
I still see you when I'm dreamin'
I just wanna feel you hold me again
And I've been countin' down the minutes
I keep climbin' up these walls
Your kiss, I want it, need it
Love you, miss you, mean it, baby"

(Love you, miss you, mean it)
Love you, miss you, mean it, baby
(Love you, miss you, mean it)
