It's just a regular Saturday night in the summer
Same guys and girls and the same stars way up in the sky
It's like the music stopped playing when I saw your body
Did you come here with someone or come here to party tonight?

My little light out of nowhere girl
Where you been all my life?
Where you been trying to hide?
It's like you come
Come from another world
Fell right out of the sky
And landed right here tonight
Do you wanna dance with me?
Any way you gotta be
Do you wanna go somewhere my little out of nowhere girl
My out of nowhere girl

Girl are you lost? Are you just here in town for the weekend
All of my life I've been here, never seen you before
If you need someone to show you around, girl I got you
I gotta know you and hold you
I don't wanna leave here alone anymore

When you walked in this place, you turned it up
Right when I saw you
Baby I saw you

My little light out of nowhere girl
Where you been all my life?
