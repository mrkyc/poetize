Hungover in a hotel room
Cell phone's dead
You're stretched out next to me
Lost somewhere in a dark whiskey dream
Hungover in a hotel room
Call the concierge
Two bloody mary's and some cigarettes
So you can wake up to breakfast in bed
Hear your voice in my head

Hey, when you gonna come pick me up?
You always say we're gonna burn it down
If you want it baby, call me back
Call me back, maybe we can hang out

Then it was room 704, hang a sign on the door
Gucci falling on the floor with the lights down low
Dancing in the dark, body killing me
Throwing off sparks
Lay it back baby, anything goes
Spent the whole night last night all messed up, making love
Girl, I swear I've never felt this good
Waking up hungover in a hotel room

Slide the curtains back
Light up the morning on the balcony
Look at you stirring in the shadows and sheets
Last night on repeat

Hey, when you gonna come pick me up?
You always say we're gonna burn it down
If you want it baby, call me back
Call me back, maybe we can hang out

Then it was room 704, hang a sign on the door
Gucci falling on the floor with the lights down low
Dancing in the dark, body killing me
Throwing off sparks
Lay it back baby, anything goes
Spent the whole night last night all messed up, making love
Girl, I swear I've never felt this good
Waking up hungover in a hotel room

There's that smile driving me wild
Call the front desk, late check out request
You know, better yet, book it for another night
Room 704, hang a sign on the door
Gucci falling on the floor with the lights down low
Dancing in the dark, body killing me
Throwing off sparks
Lay it back baby, anything goes
Spent the whole night last night all messed up, making love
Girl, I swear I've never felt this good
Waking up hungover in a hotel room

Oh, hungover in a hotel room
Yeah, yeah
