First time I tied a plastic worm and felt him on the other end
It was get the net, get him in the boat
Yeah buddy, I was hooked on it
First time I heard Chattahoochee on the speakers of my radio
I was topping off the tank on my old two-tone
I was hooked on it
Ha-ha!

Hooked on the feeling of a summer in the south
Hooked on the dust flying up from a plow
Hooked on them blue eyes, hair falling down
Hooked on her then, still hooked on her now
So many things where I grew up
Once you get a little, you can't get enough
This small town life runs through my blood
And I'm hooked on it

The first time I got that Gulf Coast white sugar sand on my feet
Saw the sunshine dancing on that clear blue water
I was hooked on it
First time I pulled me a long neck bottle from the bottom of a bucket of ice
As soon as that cold beer hit my lips, I was hooked on it

Hooked on the feeling of a summer in the south
Hooked on the dust flying up from a plow
Hooked on them blue eyes, hair falling down
Hooked on her then, still hooked on her now
So many things where I grew up
Once you get a little, you can't get enough
This small town life runs through my blood
And I'm hooked on it

Like a Friday payday honky tonk buzz
I gotta have a little more of it just because
I keep coming back to the good stuff, 'cause I'm hooked on it

Hooked on the feeling of a summer in the south
Hooked on the dust flying up from a plow
Hooked on them blue eyes, hair falling down
Hooked on her then, still hooked on her now
So many things where I grew up
Once you get a little, you can't get enough
This small town life's all in my blood
And I'm hooked on it
Yeah, I'm hooked on it
