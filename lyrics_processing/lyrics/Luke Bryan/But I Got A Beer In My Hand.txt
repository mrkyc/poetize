Yeah
Yeah

That old familiar, meant to kill you, middle finger, rearview mirror
Supposed to make a country boy sad
I should be in my recliner, whiskey typin' up one-liners
Cryin', trying to get you back
Yeah, I know how that country song goes
I'm supposed to be heartbroke

But I got a beer in my hand, and I got it raised up high
I ain't got a give in my damn right, I can do this all night
Country done came to town, this town don't stand a chance
I'll holler at the ladies, dancin' like crazy, new Luccheses, fresh up out the deer stand
Feelin' this high, wasn't part of my plan
Wasn't even gonna try
But I got a beer in my hand

The bands playin' David Lee Murphy, party crowd, it's party thirty
Lawdy mercy, I'm feelin' good
And I'm bettin' you're bettin', that I'm a wreck and you reckon
I'll call you up any second and I would

But I got a beer in my hand, and I got it raised up high
I ain't got a give in my damn right, I can do this all night
Country done came to town, this town don't stand a chance
I'll holler at the ladies, dancin' like crazy, new Luccheses, fresh up out the deer stand
Feelin' this high wasn't part of my plan
Wasn't even gonna try
But I got a beer in my hand

I meant to miss you
Oops, my bad
I meant to be blue

But I got a beer in my hand, and I got it raised up high
I ain't got a give in my damn right, I'm gon' do this all night
Country done came to town, this town don't stand a chance
I'll holler at the ladies dancin' like crazy, new Luccheses, fresh up out the deer stand
Feelin' this high wasn't part of my plan
Wasn't even gonna try
But I got a beer in my hand
