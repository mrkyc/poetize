You know the one where you call
But you act like you never called me
When you see me at a bar and you act like you never saw me
When you're dancin' with him, and you're lookin' at me
Or I'm holdin' her, and I'm hopin' you see
Or the one where you don't kiss me
Then you tell me that you miss me

All of these games, we play
I can't even keep 'em all straight
Do we mean what we say?
We got lines crossed all over the place, yeah
I can't tell if I'm winnin' or losin'
Somebody tell me, what are we doin'?
Nobody ever comes out on top
Tell me, are we ever gonna stop?
Playin' these games

The one where you act all surprised
Like you didn't know I'd be at the party
The way you make sure it gets back to me
That you got with somebody
The way you wake up, say it was just a mistake
But you always leave something over at my place
So I gotta bring it back
Now baby why you gotta be like that

This break-up, make-up, hot and cold thing got me dizzy
