You're not far from what
You wanted to become when you were young
Those years have gone by
But were never lost
It's too late
We don't know why some dreams fall through
Today
These are the scars that remind you

When all you see on your broken back
Is the perfect life that you never had
It's a better ground
When we fall apart
We'll come back again
As a work of art

So lay your head to rest
Don't worry if things never come around
Cause they have somehow
In everything you are
It's too late
When we've already been torn in two
Today
These are the scars that remind you
You might also like
When all you see on your broken back
Is the perfect life that you never had
It's a better ground
When we fall apart
We'll come back again
As a work of art

If you've ever missed your attempts to fly
Remember this, well, at least you tried
Oh, oh
You only did what you could
Oh, oh, oh
Maybe this is not your fault
When you have been scarred and have lost it all
Oh, oh
It's what is left is your heart

I think you should know
You're a work of art
I think you should know
You're a work of art
When the tide rolled in
You did not lose your heart
I think you should know
You're a work of art
When all you see on your broken back
Is the perfect life that you never had
It's a better ground
When we fall apart
We'll come back again
As a work of art

I think you should know
You're a work of art
I think you should know
You're a work of art
When the tide rolled in
You did not lose your heart
I think you should know
You're a work of art

When the tide rolled in
You never lost your heart
I think you should know
