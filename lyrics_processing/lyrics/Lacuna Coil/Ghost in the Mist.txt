Will not get out of my face
Locked here I cannot escape
It's my life

(What the hell is going on?)
(The difference is that I can't change it)
Every day seems like it was the day before
And I can't take it
I just want to erase the things I hate
And all the faces I see

Right, right in my face
Again and again
All I got for this is nothing but hate
Right in my face
Feeding my rage
All I got for this, nothing but hate

I'm a ghost in the mist (it's my life...)
My life slips away...
I wander unseen (compromise...)
I don't make any sound
I'm lost in the mist (going blind...)
No one showed me the way
Locked in by my fears (paralysed...)
With my knees on the ground...

Every day feels like it's so predictable
And I can't change it
I just want to break these habits
Take control of this confusion

Right, right in my face
Again and again
All I got for this is nothing but hate
Right in my face
Feeding my rage
All I got for this, nothing but hate

I'm a ghost in the mist (it's my life...)
My life slips away...
I wander unseen (compromise...)
I don't make any sound
I'm lost in the mist (going blind...)
No one showed me the way
Locked in by my fears (paralysed...)
With my knees on the ground...
I'm a ghost in the mist
My life slips away
Will not get out of my face
Locked here I cannot escape
Can't get you out of my face
What can I do now
Locked here I cannot escape
What have you done now
Will not forgive you

I'm a ghost in the mist (it's my life...)
My life slips away...
I wander unseen (compromise...)
I don't make any sound (compromise)
I'm lost in the mist (going blind...)
No one showed me the way
Locked in by my fears (paralysed...)
With my knees on the ground...
I'm a ghost in the mist (it's my life)
My life slips away...
(Can't get it out of my...)

So what have you done now
Locked here I cannot escape
What have you done now
Will not forgive what you say
What have you done now
Locked here I cannot escape
What have you done now
