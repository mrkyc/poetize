Now sunk in the horizon
We'll watch the hours go by
Fall and then arise again
I hear the darkness breathe
Sunk in the horizon
We'll watch the hours go by
Fall and then arise again
I hear the darkness breathe
Sunk into the horizon
Fall...
Down...

Let those tears come down
Let them fade away
Let them burn across your face
As you keep smiling inside
You cannot be afraid of your destiny
All the walls you've built around
Without me right by your side

One two three
The count of your lies
I can see right through your eyes
Read my lips
I cannot fix
All the broken things inside my mind
One two three
Breaking free
Turn another page and run away
Sick sick sick
No more tricks
Think about the mess you left behind

Sunk in the horizon
We'll watch the hours go by
Fall, and then arise again
I hear the darkness breathe

As the sun comes down
Over your regrets
It takes time to heal the pain
But from the scars we will learn
We've been tryin' so hard
But it was too late
Now you shut the door behind
I won't be right by your side

One two three
The count of your lies
I can see right through your eyes
Read my lips
I cannot fix
All the broken things inside my mind
One two three
Breaking free
Turn another page and run away
Sick sick sick
No more tricks
Think about the mess you left behind
Ah... ah-ah...
Ah-ah ah... ah...
Ah... ah-ah ah-ah ah-ah, ah...
Oh-oh oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh...
Ah-ah ah-ah... ah... ah...
Sunk...
