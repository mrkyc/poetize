We had a hell of a ride
But you thought we were riding to heaven
Well, I motherfucking lied
So crank that funky shit to eleven

"Hey Man!"
"Sup, Bro!"
"You hear about Bo, dude?"
"Yo, the kid sucks, man!"
"Yeah, he sucks man
Kid's trying to rap. He was in theater in high school and now he's trying to-"
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, yo is that him?
"Huh, what?"
"Yo, is that him?"
"Holy shi..."
"Oh fuck, this motherfucker scares me, I can't do this shit"
"Shut up."
"I can't fucking do this shit."
"Dude, just shut up!"

Photosynthetical, I want 'em botanical
And I'm kind of theoretical (What?)
Quantum mechanical (What?)
Alphabetical, a word puritanical
Not a hypothetical, I rule tyrannical
Tyrannical-saurus Rex
Fuck the system, solar plexus
A solo star Texas, yeah
Too smart to be sexist, hey
Slow it down, the shit's too quick
Fuck it, stick with it, the kid is too sick to quit
Haters, suck my dick
Handle the candle, lick the wick
No, stop, you're better than that
C'mon, "mail" definition, there's a letter in that
Spell "male" then repeat the second letter in that
AA, if you got a girl, don't let her in that
I said I got a green light, Jay Gatsby
You know leaking's just for maxi
So leak my tracks, they're tax-free
And that's the way to be if you ask me
Take this music, choose it, use it, fuse it
Abuse it, lose it
If some of you like it, sweet
But if it's just me, then B, let's ride the beat
Fuck it, get a bucket, my stomach is gonna upchuck
Texas Ranger, no Walker, get up, Chuck
Pixar's dicks are slick 'cause they fucked up
What a fucked up stuck-up suck-up
You might also like
Say this shit is crap, scoff
Write me off 'cause I'm a white kid tryin' to rap
Because I'm willing to quit, just kiddin'
The kid will keep killin' this shit, oh

We've had a hell of a ride
But you thought we were riding to heaven
Well, I motherfucking lied
So crank that funky shit to eleven
We've had a hell of a ride
But you thought we were riding to heaven, heaven

Lyrical acrobat, listen
Empirical mathematician
The miracle aftermath, is it part
Due to the fact that rap's elastic addict acts dismissive?
Too smart to be dismissed, hey
Miss Heart meet Mr. Fist
Kids can't cut it, so they try a wrist, shit
You got nothin' on me, I'm a nihilist
Come on, Bo, flow
Blow like the wind go
Flow like the wind blow
Blowin' out the window
Amnesty, amnesia, I remember a window in Indonesia
Pleased to meet ya
I don't believe in Jesus
Jesus, please don't sneeze your Cheez-Its
Please it's just what I believe, it's not
Jesus, it's Cheez-Its, right?
Not like the Jeremiah Wright guy
Rhyme too tight, and it's makin' ya fight
My skin Lite Brite like at night what you write by
Lord of the Rings, but I'm the Tolkien white guy
Too dense, gotta rewind it
Hate my brain, but too sane to mind it
The meaning's there, but as a rule of thumb
Just hum if you're too dumb to find it
Hmm!
