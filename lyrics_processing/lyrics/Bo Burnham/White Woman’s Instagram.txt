Her favorite photo of her mom
The caption says:
"I can't believe it
It's been a decade since you've been gone
Mama, I miss you
I miss sitting with you in the front yard
Still figuring out how to keep living without you

Your little girl didn't do too bad
Mama, I love you, give a hug and kiss to Dad"
