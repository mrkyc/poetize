Fuck the rules, fuck the game
Fuck you tools, fuck, you're lame!
If givin' a fuck means suckin' up
Then fuck it, fuck the fame!
A bit unstable: fuck you, brain
A bit like Abel: fuck you, Cain
Dumb little fuck
If I'm fuckin' somethin' up, then fuck my name!
Fuck the politicians
Fuck missionary missions
Fuck beauty competitions
Fuck bigoted traditions
I fuckin' hate that shit, I do
And if you don't, fuck it, fuck you, too
Couldn't give a fuck who I'm talking to
Fuckin who? Fuck you, dude!
Fuck how I'm regarded
Or if I get bombarded
By sick creationists who are borderline retarded
Yeah, fuck me for my hard words
Fuck another R word
Fuck me for my hard work
That got me into Harvard
Man, fuck it, fuck my past
Fuck the times, fuck it fast!
If you think I'm fucking with you
Then you're fuckin' with your fuckin' last!
God bless you, common cold
Fuck the pope, fuckin' old
If he loved the poor, then he would've sold
His mansion made of solid gold, so fuck him!
Yeah fuck it, fuck him!
I said it: fuck it, fuck him!
Gotta save those deacons, preachers
All them geezers, fuck it, fuckin'
Fuck the fashion scene
It is so fucking obscene! It
Will take a poor fat teen chick
And make her turn bulimic!
Fuck the shit that I came for
And fuck the shit that I paid for
And the rappers that made a name for
Calling for a race war
Now go out and pimp their rides
Buy, accessorize
And turn ten thousand bright eyes
To the companies run by the white guys?!
You suck! You fuckin' suck!
You suck so much, you suck, but
If I sucked as much as you
I'd motherfucking shut it up!
You suck!
You fucking suck it
So fucking shut it!
Drop the beat
Then pick it up like Mr. Bucket!

You've got sticks and stones to turn to
But I've got words to hurt you
So save your bullets, 'cause
You're fucked! (Totally fucked!)

And do whatever, say whatever, 'cause whatever, you're fucked!
