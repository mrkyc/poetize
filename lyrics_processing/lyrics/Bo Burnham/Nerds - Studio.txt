I'm a faggot, I'm a retard
I got a girl's bag and a V-card
I got three friends and a whack-ass ride
You can judge by the cover 'cause it's shitty on the inside
No girls wanna fuck me, trust me
I don't give a fuck, don't adjust me
Just, please, shut your face hole for just one second
"Fuck you, faggot. You're so fucking dumb!"
Dumb? I'm the dumb one?
Calm down, Bo, just count to ten, um
One, two, three, whore - I mean four, shit
Three, four five, bitch - I mean six, shit
I quit, I got no patience
You won, I face it
Your life peaks at graduation
Well, congratu-fucking-lations

NERDS
The faggots, the spastic fat chicks
Who sit in the back with no one to do their lab with
The NERDS
Kid with acne and tons of Proactiv
Packed inside his backpack
I got your back, kid
You might also like
And do you know why, kid, I can rap so mean?
'Cause I was reading while you were fucking the Prom Queen
Huddled up reading, no lacrosse team
"Huddle up, huddle up!"
What? You lost me
Sorry, bro, did I interrupt the circle of jerks all circle-jerking?
I need saving? No, fuck no!
Quoth the Raven? No, fuck Poe!
Ah, shit I'm bitchin', listen
It's they don't know what they're missing
For instance, I like poetry, I like instruments
Maybe we have similar interests
But it's no fall-balls, no balls fall
Just sit and scrawl on the stall walls
At 3 P.M. I pause
That shit sounds like applause

Kid with acne and tons of Proactiv
Packed inside his backpack
I, I got your back (back, back, back)
She stood in line and got cut
Tried out, got cut
Loved art, but the budget got cut
Then she got numb and she only felt when she knelt and cut
NERDS
NERDS, NERDS
NERDS

Packed inside his backpack
I got your back, kid

I know it's bad, kid
