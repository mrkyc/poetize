I went through a pretty rough breakup recently. It was a long time coming, we had a lot of conversations about it, she and I. But recently, we've had the conversation. It wasn't recent, but I can remember it like it was yesterday. She came out of the shower, hair wet, everything was wet. If you haven't seen a shower: It's a thing with water, and it covers you, and she had just been in that. She came right out of it and she looked me in the eyes and she said:

It's over
We shouldn't fight to stay together just to fight again
It's over
We're unhappy
We need to take a break from us to make us right again
And even though it's not gonna go any further
I swear I don't regret a second of it
And when the dust has settled
I hope we can still be friends

And then I said
EAT A DICK!
EAT A DICK!
EAT A FUCKING DICK, BITCH!
PUT ON YOUR DICK EATING GLOVES
GET READY TO GOBBLE A DICK UP!
IF YOU DON'T LIKE THIS DICK SITCH
EAT A  DICK, BITCH!

(Starting to think I made the right decision here)
Look, you're angry
I can see that
But you don't need to make this harder than it has to be
I try to speak to you
But you won't listen-
You might also like
EAT A DICK!

Hold on, please just let me-

EAT A DICK!

Oh my God
Honestly, are you fucking five?
I try to talk this out, and you refuse to even listen to me
I'm saying how I'm feeling
And you're saying "eat a dick"
Does that seem like a mature response to you?

NO!
BUT SEE I THINK THE ISSUE IS
I'VE GOT MY FATHERS TEMPER
AND I'M EMOTIONALLY INARTICULATE!
SO RATHER THAN BEING HONEST AND VULNERABLE
I'VE BEEN A QUICK SWITCH
BECAUSE I'M HURTING INSIDE
AND I'M TRYING TO HIDE IT, SO
EAT A DICK, BITCH!
I thought we had a future together, you fucking whore
I didn't think you'd cry for me
I didn't think you cared
I thought you were lashing out in anger
Now I see you're scared
I'm scared, too
Maybe we can work this out
And not break up

Really?

NO, LICK MY CLIT!
LICK MY MOTHERFUCKING CLIT!
YOU THINK THREE LOUSY TEARS
OFFSETS THREE YEARS OF SHIT
I DESERVE BETTER THAN YOU
GET ME WETTER, THEN SCREW
SORRY, YOU'RE NOT WHAT I NEED, HUN
LICK THIS CLIT AND LEAVE, SON

Hey, if you guys are having a good time, make some silence!
