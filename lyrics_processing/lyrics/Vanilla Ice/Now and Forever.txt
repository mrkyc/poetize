Now and forever (I gotta have it)
Now and forever (I gotta have it)
Now and forever (I gotta have it)
Now and forever (I gotta have it)

I need a woman that's sexy, straight up and erotic
I gotta have her, yes, a beautiful sex goddess
The kind of girl who rocks my world
Doin' those crazy things, with whipped cream and ice cream
And everything from grapes to honey
And if you ask me, I want her for 9 1/2 week's money
Straight stranded on a beach, G
While she climbs up and down this tall coconut tree
And doin' wild things with her tongue and lips
And her thighs, includin' them hips
She comes equipped to lead the I-C-E stuck
The kind of woman who can make my volcano erupt

Now and forever (I gotta have it)
Now and forever (I gotta have it)
Now and forever (I gotta have it)
Now and forever (I gotta have it)

I need a woman that drives me crazy when I look at her
And make the Iceman melt when I look at her
Yeah, she's the one to make Vanilla's blood boil
Open up that hood and let me check that oil
I got the right dipstick for the job, honey
Watch me swing, while you're dancin' in your G-string
And let me pull up to your bumper
And if your battery is dead, I'll pull my cable out and jump you
Pump you with the juice to keep the engine runnin'
Oh yes, you've got the body work to keep the Iceman comin'
Again and again in any type of weather, baby
I need you now - Now and Forever

Now and forever (I gotta have it)
Now and forever (I gotta have it)
Now and forever (I gotta have it)
Now and forever (I gotta have it)

I'm the type of man that likes to get it off
I'll pour some champagne all over your body, and then I'll lick it off
Uh, and I have to tell you somethin'
I want to kiss your neck and take my tongue around your belly button
I need a woman, not a hooker
To take rides on my love boat, yes, my 53-footer
So let's sink in my hot tub or jacuzzi
And do those crazy wild things that amuse me
Oh yes baby, I'll be your sex slave
And with my headgear on, I wanna go and explore your cave
See, you can make the Ice cream
Come here, girl, and take a lick of this ice cream
Now and forever (I gotta have it)
Now and forever (I gotta have it)
Now and forever (I gotta have it)
