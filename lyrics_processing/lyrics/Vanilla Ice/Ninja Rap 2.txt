Now I think you're ready for this
What? What? What? What? What? What? What?
What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What?

Go ninja, go ninja go, what what?!
Go ninja, go ninja go, what what?!
Go ninja, go ninja go, what what?!
Go ninja, go ninja go, what what?!
Ninja ninja, what what? Ninja ninja, what what?

What is the ninja ninja rap, baby you don't know
Remix it old school, yeah, but you don't know
People call me V-I, but you don't know
Still lettin' it flow, baby you don't know (What? What? What? What? What? What? What?)
When I'm in the club, people show me some love
I've got the mic on tight, like OJ wears his gloves
People come around, VIPs and the Clowns
Juggalo love, we sellin' every place out
When we rage at the Gathering with ICP
Sayin' "Fuck the world!", let's all live free, yeah
I'm on a mission, I remain in the game
See, I do it for my rhymes, you can fuck the fame!
'Cause I cater to my crew, ones that pull me through
The blacks, Puerto Ricans, and the white people too
All the haters, I kick you, hmm, like Bruce Lee
Got my foot up that ass so far you can't see
Come on and join, pants sag to my loins
It's the Ninja Rap baby, hmm, now what you know about that?

Go ninja, go ninja go, what what?!
Go ninja, go ninja go, what what?!
Go ninja, go ninja go, what what?!
Go ninja, go ninja go, what what?!
Ninja ninja, what what? Ninja ninja, what what?

Well, it's time to shine, the Ninja Rap rewind
One at a time, droppin' the dime when I rhyme
Unstoppable, always keep goin' for mine
I jump them hurdles like Carl Lewis, givin' sight to the blind
You can see, I always fight back adversity
I'll never be what MTV wanted me to be
Now I'm free, free from disease of the industry
You can never understand what it's like to be outcasted
Now I live in an underground blasted
Darkside soldier hatin' people who were plastic
Like Bill Clinton, you never inhaled
Messin' around with Monica and polished up his bell

Go ninja, go ninja go, what what?!
Go ninja, go ninja go, what what?!
Go ninja, go ninja go, what what?!
Go ninja, go ninja go, what what?!
Ninja ninja, what what? Ninja ninja, what what?
Go ninja, go ninja go, what what?!
Go ninja, go ninja go, what what?!
Go ninja, go ninja go, what what?!
Go ninja, go ninja go, what what?!
Ninja ninja, what what? Ninja ninja, what what?
Go ninja, go ninja go
Go ninja, go ninja go
Go ninja, go ninja go
Go ninja, go ninja go
Go ninja, go ninja go
Go ninja, go ninja go
Go ninja, go ninja go
Go ninja, go ninja go

Go ninja, go ninja go, what what?!
Go ninja, go ninja go, what what?!
Go ninja, go ninja go, what what?!
Go ninja, go ninja go, what what?!
Ninja ninja, what what? Ninja ninja, what what?
