Here it is, a dope hit
Iceman's comin' with the dope shit
'Cause a few suckers need their throats slit
Jealous 'cause I went multi-platinum
Now I'm gonna blast them in the head 'til they're dead with my magnum
Lyrics might be simplistic
But I'm no simp on the strip, 'cause I know how to pimp it
Now I got grip and suckers keep sinkin' in my quicksand
Vanilla Ice, vocal hitman
Got the number 3 in my crosses, sittin' on the rooftops
, And the fools drop
Pop-pop Goes the Weasel was a big fa-flop-flop
The brothers didn't like your record 'cause it wasn't hip-hop-hop
But this ain't a diss, 'cause you sold gold
Still, I made a killin' 'cause it ain't even a tenth of eleven-million
Givin' my rhyme spice and my DJ's on the slice
And Vanilla ice is back on the map, with the wrath of the...

I'm the Ice, The Iceman, but I'm no superhero
So baby, just cut that, Zero
I'm gettin' tired of those punks gettin' jealous
Tryin' to say that I might be another Elvis
Forget that 'cause I'm Vanilla, the funky rhyme killer
The dope song dealer, ready to peel a cap of a wack MC
There's no wack in me, 'cause big dollars is what I'm stackin', G
So give a boost to the volume
I got the funky-funky sounds to make the cars boom
So get back, give me room, as I consume the others
The Iceman is bringin' doom to the suckers
Yes, for the lovers of hip-hop
And for my foes, they get popped
You shouldn't step to the man, when I'm swingin' like Tyson (Yo!)
Punk, this is the wrath of the Iceman
Ice, ice, man
The wrath of the Iceman
Ice, ice, man
The wrath of the Iceman
Ice, ice, man (Yeah)
The wrath of the Iceman
Ice, ice, man (Yeah)
The wrath of the Iceman

Now I'm on everybody's hitlist, so trip this
So they're gonna get dissed, now they're on my hitlist
It's like that 'cause I'm the mizzak, I carry my strizap
To bust a kizzap, don't try to jizzack me
'Cause my life is like hectic, when I made a record
Now I'm gettin' hounded every second
See, I'm like the one they love to hate
So I made this album much harder to set the stupid critics straight
And I'm still droppin' bombs
You know the rap world's a battlefield in Vietnam
And I'm creepin' like a sniper
Takin' out the suckers with an album that is funkier and hyper
The type of street stuff I like listenin' to
Funky bass and breaks to make your speakers shake
Earthquake breaks the Richter scale
Check out the aftermath, yo, this the wrath of the...
Ice, ice, man
The wrath of the Iceman
Ice, ice, man
The wrath of the Iceman
Ice, ice, man (Yeah)
The wrath of the Iceman
Ice, ice, man (Yeah)
