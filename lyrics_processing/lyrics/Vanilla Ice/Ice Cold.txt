Uh!
With your bad self-
Uh!
With your bad self-
Uh!
With your bad self-
Uh!
With bad-bad self-
Uh!

All right, stop, spread yourself around
Get loose, girl, let's break it down
Get down, straight to the floor
Get excited and beg for more
As I go on, flow on with a smile
Pay attention to my style
Dirty but hot, you know what I mean?
Get loose, girl, like a sex fiend
Let's do it, 'cause you know what I want
Me and you baby go one on one
Get freaky and I do the same
Get hot and erotic like a sex machine

Ice, coolin', yo, colder than ever
I like it
Ice, coolin', yo, colder than ever
I like it
You might also like
Ice cold, cooler than ever
Never say never 'cause I'm so damn clever
Lickin' your lips, I'm ridin' your hips
V.I.P. Posse and we're pimps
Be on the lookout in your vicinity
I'm robbin' virgins of their virginity
Like Robin Hood gave to the poor
I rock cost and now she wants more
She calls everyday, it's gettin' kinda silly
But she rides my saddle like Bronco Billy
In a rodeo, somewhere out west
She screams out "Vanilla ice, you're the best!"
Echoin' out, can you hear?
She screams out everywhere
I'm just a pimp and you know
Snatchin' women, so, yo!
You can beg, plead, tell me you love me
But there's no way I'll put a girl above me
Unless it's sex and you wanna ride
Jump on my saddle, baby, and get live

Ice, coolin', yo, colder than ever
I like it
Ice, coolin', yo, colder than ever
I like it
Move your body all around
This is the dope jam, so get down
Now that you like what I'm sayin' admit it
This is the jam and Vanilla just did it
I made you work until your butt got sore
In other words, I'm about to get raw
On stage, it's a V.I.P
Doin' dances from A to Z
Pumpin' it, pushin' it, stick it hard
I freaked your girl in the back of your car
I wore a jimmy that I slapped on
Popped a rubber duckie, so I bought me a Trojan
Get ready, hyped into the groove
As I practice to make your body move
You're fienin' for a meanin', oh yes, I'm comin'
Vanilla Ice is here, so you suckers start runnin'
This is the jam I know you're gonna like
D-Shay; he cuts like a knife
He won't smirk and he won't smile
D-Shay, get funky for a while

Yo, it's time for me to pump-
Pump up the volume
Ice, coolin', yo, colder than ever
I like it
Ice-Ice, coolin', yo, colder than ever
I like it
Ice, coolin', yo, colder than ever
Ice, coolin', yo, colder than ever
