Oh my gosh, oh my gosh!
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh!
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh!
Just shut up and listen and learn, my son...
Hey yo, check it! I think it's time to wreck it
So here I go again with the stuff, so let's test it
Cool like the ice on Vanilla, here's the flavor
Freezin' up the mic to hit you with so you can savor
No slippin' nor stonin', gettin straight to the point
Hit the mad izm and light another joint
The easy-like style is what I kick when I'm kickin'
No trippin', I'm spliffin', so get a good whiffin'
And get with the style that I'm using, no guessin'
So here's a quick lesson: I got my Smith & Wesson
Listen up close and there'll be no confusion
Now you're addicted to mentally abusin'
Word to the mother, I'm here to tear it up
And if ya can't get with it, I don't give a...
So run and tell your crew and tell 'em Ice is near
This here is for the people!
The Ice is rated lethal!

Oh my gosh, oh my gosh!
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh!
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh!
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh!
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh!
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh!

Here I come with the nine in my hand
It's time to wreck shop, now tell me who's the man?
Just like Ali, I'm the thriller in Manila
Tearin' stuff up like my man, Godzilla
Makin' the suckers drop when you're steppin' into my zone
Comin' straight up like my man Al Capone
You try to cross me up, I'll jump you like you was a checker
And like Jerry Rice, I'm into breakin' all records
Rollin' with my crew, firin' up a blunt
My hands on the pump, bustin' you on beachfront
In case you forgot, I'm here to remind you, I'm...
Chiller, chiller than the ice on Vanilla
Word, word to the herb as you heard
I'm hittin' 3 pointers just like Larry Bird
You can't touch this, welcome to the hitlist
Try to play me out, you catch a big fist quick
Pop in your eye, don't try to ask me why
'Cause it's like that, fool, you're hangin' with the Ice 'cause it's cool
And like I said this here's for the people!
The Ice is rated lethal!

Oh my gosh, oh my gosh!
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh!
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh!
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh!
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh!
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh!
It goes a 1 to the 2 to the 3 to the 4
The Ice be the leader, so open up the door
Check it out, 'cause what I'm all about is gettin' mad paid
'Cause the green is real sticky
My stuff is kinda tricky, so listen up close
And when you ask the ladies, they love the Ice the most
So open up your ear and look inside of here
And keep yourself in line, yo, and please don't steer
'Cause cool is how I'm coolin' and there just isn't nothin' to it
Don't ask me no questions, 'cause you already knew it
Now get with the program and listen to the style
And lend me an ear so I can get buck wild
Your girly can't resist it, so chill while I kick it
And burn a hootie mac, so go ahead and twist it
My record's on the table, I'm droppin' it on the needle
This here is for the people!
The Ice is rated lethal!

Oh my gosh, oh my gosh!
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh!
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh!
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh!
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh!
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh!
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh!
