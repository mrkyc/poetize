Yes... again!
Hot sex
Yeah, uh...

Hot sex for your pleasure, set it off
Liquid treasures floatin' in the loft
I'm in the mood, I'm in the mood to lick you
And let my tongue explore all up in you (Yeah)
Around your belly button, all around your neck (Uh)
Down to your legs baby, what's next? (What's next?)
I'm comin' in on deck, check your reflex (Reflex)
Me and you baby, doin' the sex
All night, make it so hot, so nice, I like
Just the way you make me feel alright tonight
Time for the candle wax and Ice
On the fly carpet ride of life

It's magic!
On the dreamscape, love bliss orgasmic!
Ecstasy, you don't wanna miss, gotta have it!
Animal sex with a twist; like a rabbit!
Hot sex every chance we get, what?

Uh... (Hot sex)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh...

Hot sex all the time, you can find
Hot sex on my mind, in my rhyme
Wet dreams escape from reality
Aphrodisiac keeps on calling me
Testosterone, I can't hold back
Hard to the bone when I'm under attack, uh
Like a butterfly silk skin, I drive it in
On a quest for the pearl, give ya back bends
Like a shockwave movin' through your spine
Orgasmic surges leave you blind
On and on, shakin' like a shockwave
Blastin' volcanic lava in my face
It's magic!
On the dreamscape, love bliss orgasmic!
Ecstasy, you don't wanna miss, gotta have it!
Animal sex with a twist; like a rabbit!
Hot sex every chance we get, what?

Hot sex all night, all night
Hot sex all night, all night
Hot sex all night, all night
All night, all night, alright
Hot sex all night, all night
Hot sex all night, all night
Hot sex all night, all night
All night, all night, alright

Hold your head back, baby close your eyes
Get ready for a trip that leaves you hypnotized
With champagne, crank the hot tub
Strip your clothes, hot oil rub
Burn the incense underneath the sky
Sex escapade, my mind's on high
And with my bag of nuts and sack full of tricks
Down for whatever all up in the mix, uh!
And with my hands on your backside let it slide
Break through, straight to the other side
And then we ride like Bronco Billy
Saddle up baby, it's time to get silly
It's magic!
On the dreamscape, love bliss orgasmic!
Ecstasy, you don't wanna miss, gotta have it!
Animal sex with a twist; like a rabbit!
Hot sex every chance we get, what?

Hot sex all night, all night
Hot sex all night, all night
Hot sex all night, all night
All night, all night, alright
Hot sex all night, all night
Hot sex all night, all night
Hot sex all night, all night
