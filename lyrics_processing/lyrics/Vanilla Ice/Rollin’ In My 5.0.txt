Turn up the volume, crank up the bass (Do, do-do)
Aww yeah, Vanilla Ice is in the place
I'm here to tell ya a little story 'bout my 5.0 (Do, do-do)
Just a-lettin' ya know, I'm in total control
Oh, yes, many people know that I got good taste (Do, do-do)
And if the cops try to chase in a high speed race
I just laugh, right in their face and say "Yo"  (Do, do-do)
Don't even waste your time, see (Do, do-do)
'Cause I can red-line and leave you far behind
Because I'm out gettin' mine
And I'm sweatin' like steam and you can feel the flow (Do, do-do)
When I'm Rollin' in my 5.0

Tick-tock, do-do-do-do-do
Rollin' in my 5.0 (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Tick-tock, do-do-do-do-do
Rollin' in my 5.0 (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Tick-tock, do-do-do-do-do
Rollin' in my 5.0 (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Awh yeah, here we go
You might also like
It's not a Benz or a Jag, if a 5-0 with a rag (Do, do-do)
And I don't wanna brag, but I could never be stag
When I'm cruisin', to A-1-A (Do, do-do)
Zero to 60, 4 seconds don't play
It's not a joke, and you can see the smoke (Do, do-do)
I'm burnin' rubba
You heard me clear I didn't stutta
The V-I-P Posse, with my homeboy Staff (Do, do-do)
And you can giggle and chuckle, but I'll have the last
Laugh and take my money all the way to the bank (Do, do-do)
And the ones that buy my records are the ones I should thank
Because I'm sweatin' like steam and you can feel the flow
When I'm rollin, in my 5.0

Tick-tock, do-do-do-do-do
Rollin' in my 5.0 (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Tick-tock, do-do-do-do-do
Rollin' in my 5.0 (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Tick-tock, do-do-do-do-do
Rollin' in my 5.0 (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Tick-tock, do-do-do-do-do

Time keeps on slippin'
Time, time, time...
V-to the-A-N-I-double L-A, I-C-E (Vanilla Ice!)
Got it goin' on
V-to the-A-N-I-double L-A, I-C-E (Vanilla Ice!)
Got it goin' on
V-to the-A-N-I-double L-A, I-C-E (Vanilla Ice!)
Got it goin' on
V-to the-A-N-I-double L-A, I-C-E (Vanilla Ice!)
Got it goin' on

I view a fly cutie and I wanna converse
I shift to first, and then back to reverse
'Cause there's crazy fly ronis at NNB
They wanna flee with the I-C-E
I don't drive 55 when I'm in my ride, I just glide
My head leaned to the side
I cruise the A-1-A with a plan in mind
The V-I-P Posse not far behind
The honeys top and jump for my thousand watts
It fills the back seat as my system rocks
'Cause I'm sweatin like steam and you can feel the flow
When I'm rollin, in my 5.0

Tick-tock, do-do-do-do-do
Rollin' in my 5.0 (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Tick-tock, do-do-do-do-do
Rollin' in my 5.0 (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Tick-tock, do-do-do-do-do
Rollin' in my 5.0 (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
