Guess who's back?
Don't be scared

O.K.S., Original Killa Shit
That'll leave your wig split with your wrists slit
O.K.S., niggas with the biscuits
Mobbin' through your district splifted on some sick shit

Raisin up from my tomb
Time warp on a dime up off the Shrooms
Zoom in let me take your mind on a journey
See what I see; vision of bodies burning
Like turning a pistol and point' it to your dome
Cock it back squeeze the trigger, blaow! And it's on
Brains gone, thrown out the back of your cranium
Drippin' on your shorts, left your ass a corpse on your Ma's front porch
About to the torch down the house
Caught your mama and her spouse fuckin' on the couch
Like south, 'bout to make moves off your fam bam
Madman, lyrically from rap to Seran, next plan
Let me expand on my artwork
Genius in my reality, pure insanity
Can it be the angel dust that turns your brains to dust?
Bust lyrics, strangle us, no one is insane as us

Takin' puffs on the smoke, I call the antichrist
Got me seein' red and purple lights (Whoa!)
Mixed with black dots, peep the backdrop of the crime scene
Niggas seein' 19", I'm seein' widescreen
So much red Visine can't get it out
From the rage of the slugs as the iron spit it out
It is I, psycho palmin' the Desert Eagle
Creepin' through your blocks in the Crip-colored Regal
Pure evil, bumpin' Brother Lynch Season of the Sick
How you gonna reason with the psycho? I'm the desolate
Watch the devil spit, call the exorcist
Satanic messages, got me wearin' niggases for necklaces
Yes it is the messenger of death, watch your step, I'm quite wicked
Make a motherfucker leak his life liquid
So why risk it, it's a suicide when it comes to you and I
Do or fly, nigga, you will die!
