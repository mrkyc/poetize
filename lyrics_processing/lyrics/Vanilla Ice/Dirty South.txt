And meanwhile on the South Side...
South Side of town, town, town, town

Here come the South shit, dirty South shit (What)
Here come the South shit, dirty South shit (What)
Here come the South shit, dirty South shit (Uh)
Here come the South shit, dirty, dirty fly shit

This is for them rednecks and brothers with gold teeth
And them South boys on the streets with much heat
Put it up now for that dirty South
Southern fried now all, up in your mouth
It's that hip hop shit with the Southern twist
In your pick-'em-up truck, you be bumpin' this
With that piece and chain and the diamond ring
And them out-of-town broads, they be lovin' the slang
713, I-45 big crawler
And the 214 big town B-Baller

Here come the South shit, dirty South shit (What)
Here come the South shit, dirty South shit (What)
Here come the South shit, dirty South shit (Uh)
Here come the South shit, dirty, dirty fly shit (Yeah, yeah, uh)

I got the South Shit bumpin' in my G-ride
Eyes closed, puffin' green when I drive by
Here is something you can't understand
How I can burn Kill a Man
Step up if you wanna get some of this here
I got the blunt, got a cooler full of cold beer
Roll the Escalade down to the river
Pull the fishin' poles out, sippin' on sizzurp
Just bullshittin', highsidin' eyes on tight
Get it crunk, get it crunk, we gon' ball tonight
Now what you got for me, is it Henessy?
Or maybe ecstasy, fill my fantasies?
I can't believe I got your mind wide open
Trippin' on the South shit, now what is you smokin'?

Here come the South shit, dirty South shit (What)
Here come the South shit, dirty South shit (What)
Here come the South shit, dirty South shit (Uh)
Here come the South shit, dirty, dirty fly shit

Puff puff give, I got that dirty, dirty fly shit
When I wake up in the morning, yo I got to get my fix quick
Rollin' through the hood, gotta get my buzz on
Hittin' them switches on that 20-inch chrome
Through the Southside where they got them fat sacks
Where they at, where they at, got my seat laid back
I'm a South Side rider, burn E-Z widers
Shakin' off them haters, 'cause them fools can't try us
You ballers and hustlers smokin' Southside Skunk
Pushin' them blades when you ride through the swamp
If you're feelin' this with me, let me see you put 'em up
We never get enough of that South Side, what?
Here come the South shit, dirty South shit (What)
Here come the South shit, dirty South shit (What)
Here come the South shit, dirty South shit (Uh)
Here come the South shit, dirty, dirty fly shit

Dirty South shit will have your ass hella dazed
Everybody in this bitch bout gettin' paid
Riding on Dubs, swervin' in the Escalade
And these Southside niggas, I don't think you could fade
Who wanna be the next punk ridin' in the trunk
Ridin' with my nigga Ice, blowin' on the Skunk
It's hard to hold this, 'cause we hot like fire
Boy, I thought you knew, it's Southside 'til I expire
Comin' with hollow tips up in the clip will make you flip
It's Southside when I ride, Southside when I dip (What?)

Here come the South shit, dirty South shit (What)
Here come the South shit, dirty South shit (What)
Here come the South shit, dirty South shit (Uh)
Here come the South shit, dirty, dirty fly shit
