Alright stop, collaborate and listen
Ice is back with my brand new invention
Something grabs a hold of me tightly
Flow like a harpoon daily and nightly
Will it ever stop? Yo, I don't know
Turn off the lights, huh, and I'll glow
To the extreme I rock a mic like a vandal
Light up a stage and wax a chump like a candle
Dance! Rush the speaker that booms
I'm killin' your brain like a poisonous mushroom
Deadly when I play a dope melody
Anything less than the best is a felony
Love it or leave it, you better gain way
You better hit bullseye, the kid don't play
If there was a problem, yo, I'll solve it
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it

Now that the party is jumping
With the bass kicked in and the Vegas are pumpin'
Quick to the point, to the point no faking
I'm cooking MCs like a pound of bacon
Burning 'em if you're not quick and nimble
I go crazy when I hear a cymbal
And a hi-hat with a souped-up tempo
I'm on a roll, it's time to go solo
Rollin' in my 5.0
With my ragtop down so my hair can blow
The girlies on standby waving just to say "Hi"
Did you stop? No, I just drove by
Kept on pursuing to the next stop
I bust a left and I'm heading to the next stop
That block was dead, yo
So, I continued to A1A...
Girls were hot, wearing less than bikinis
Rockman lovers, driving Lamborghinis
Jealous, 'cause I'm out getting mine
Shay with a gauge and Vanilla with a nine
Ready for the chumps on the wall
The chumps are acting ill because they full of eight ball
Gunshots ranged out like a bell
I grabbed my nine, all I heard were shells
Fallin' on the concrete real fast
Jumped in my car, slammed on the gas
Bumper to bumper, the avenue's packed
I'm tryin' to get away before the jackers jack
Police on the scene, you know what I mean?
They passed me up, confronted all the dope fiends
If there was a problem, yo, I'll solve it
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it

Take heed, 'cause I'm a lyrical poet
Miami's on the scene, just in case you didn't know it
My town that created all the bass sound
Enough to shake and kick holes in the ground
My style's like a chemical spill
These are rhymes that you can vision and feel
Conducted and formed, this is a hell of a concept
We make it hype and you want to step with this
Shay plays on the fade
Slice like a ninja, cut like a razor blade
So fast, other DJs say, "Damn"
Rhyme was a drug, I'd sell it by the gram
Keep my composure when it's time to get loose
Magnetized by the mic when I kick my juice
If there was a problem, yo, I'll solve it
Check out the hook while the DJ revolves it

Rollin'...
I bust a left and I'm heading to the next stop
Rollin'...
Police on the scene, you know what I mean?
They passed me up, confronted all the dope fiends
Rollin'...
Rollin'...
