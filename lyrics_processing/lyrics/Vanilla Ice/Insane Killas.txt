Violent J, Shaggy, Insane Clown Posse, baby what?
From New York to L.A
From Chile to Greece
From Uganda to your momma
We gives absolutely no fucks, motherfucks!
Natural born serial slaughterers
Mass motherfuckin' murderin' murderers
Bitch, count to ten and meet your maker!

I'm scary like Michael Jackson up close (Ow!)
I like diggin' up dead bodies, look at me! I'm gross! (What?)
My name's Violent J, but you can call me syphilis (Ahhh)
Gonorrhea or the clap 'cause I infected this rap (Ahhh)
You wanna know if I could ever kill somebody?
Well that's like askin' Charlie Manson if he's ever been to jail
I kill family, friends, myself, what?!
Yeah, I'd kill myself if I could only survive
I tried to kill Rob Van Winkle, in fact that's how we met (Ah!)
I went up to kill him and he was thinkin' the same shit (Uh-oh)
I pulled out a chainsaw, he pulled out an axe
I was like "Come on! Wait, is that a Stanley? Where'd you get that?"
It's natural to kill and to murder, you gotta have it in you
It's like a dick all up in you, although I wouldn't know
Look at us natural killers! (Yeah)
The world's most player-hated rapper and the most hated group
Together like whoop!

This ain't no Blair Witch, beware bitch!
I'll pick your motherfuckin' brain with an icepick
Remember me? The V I-C-E
Well, here's my trilogy, I'm outta captivity
The Rap Cujo, you know my flow is ferocious
The last survivor with a mouth full of cockroaches
I bring this hocus pocus, you're flyin' away
Like the last days of the motherfuckin' Locust
I'm the redneck in the moshpit, 2 axes come in handy
To answer Violent J, you're damn right it's a Stanley
In the shadows of the dark with Darkman like spawn
In your dash, blazin' it up with explosive bombs
I spit homicides like major cities at 11PM
Assembling bodies in the dungeon like the line at GM
Ice mixed with blood is the killer's milkshake
Blended with the clowns from the underground it's a lyrical deathquake
Mass murderer, natural born killer

Icky icky ya-ya, icky icky ya-ya
Mass murderer, natural born killer

Disrespect me, I'll run in your house like puffin' Steve Stout
Break both your arms, gun in your mouth
Knock your teeth out with the nose of the fifth
Bullets bust through the back of your head ya die stiff
Fuckin' with the clan, watch what you say
We kill niggas like the KKK
Shoot you with an SK or a AK
Bitch, you gon' die either way
I'm a monster, thoroughbred, gun-holding weed head
Cross me, bet tomorrow you'll be dead
Catch you at a show, while you're chilling with your ho
And crack your skull with a bottle of Mo
I'm a Sing Sing killer, gun room captain
Brooklyn home of the original gun clapping
Gats get brung, niggas get done
Sons lose fathers and mothers lose sons
I'm a killer
Mass murderer, natural born killer
I'm not fuckin' around
Icky icky ya-ya, icky icky ya-ya
Mass murderer, natural born killer
I'm not fuckin around
Icky icky ya-ya, icky icky ya-ya

To die is a fate that must come to us all...
But how horrible to be buried alive
From the darkness they shovel, eyes glazed with death, hands clawing for blood...

Mass murderer, natural born killer
I'm not fuckin' around
Icky icky ya-ya, icky icky ya-ya
Mass murderer, natural born killer
I'm not fuckin around
Icky icky ya-ya, icky icky ya-ya
Mass murderer, natural born killer
I'm not fuckin around
Icky icky ya-ya, icky icky ya-ya
