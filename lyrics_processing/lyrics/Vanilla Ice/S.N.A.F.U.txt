Now the industry has got me thinking twice
Thinking with the treble mix, gotta shake em like dice
Let the whole world know I can't go for that, yo
My girl know that I got dough to stack
In every cul-de-sac from the streets to the clubs
I'm making hits and everybody's showing love
Fact is I'm back and I've got it like Shaq, son
Won't stop 'til I'm back at multi platinum
So I start with some action, I'm the main attraction
Here to lock down the west crackin
Stackin' big chips, Holmes, got the shots on all 'em flip phones
Hauling in lots of residuals, what you got?
Individuals, speakin' shady, thinkin' of way that they could take me
Too sick for that, yo, can't choose me
Bring it to you live for the year 2G

Situation normal all fucked up
Situation normal all fucked up
Situation normal all fucked up
Situation normal all fucked up
Thought I was a puppet you tried to play me
Yeah - and I'm going crazy
Thought I was a puppet you tried to play me
No - you never ever made me
Thought I was a puppet you tried to play me
Yeah - and I'm going crazy
Thought I was a puppet you tried to play me
No - I'm all fucked up

Yo, ice it's Jim Splice me in - no, stop
Begin, pause, cause I gotta call the next of kin
Tell em where you been, tell em that you're ok
DOA, here say, no way, Jose
Dead yes, dead all, not dead and gone
Like a multi-leader, a little bit withdrawn
Time and go like a vicious cycle
Then wham, make 'em think that you are coming out like George Michael
On par to make people to turn in no sooner
Hook, line, and sinker; like Charlie the Tuna
Drop the hero, get with the zero
I'll try to keep it clean like Mr. Belvedere though
Fuck me, fuck you, fuck the single
Don't want to take it in the can, you're not Pringles
But once you pop you can't stop
So don't interrupt - situation normal all fucked up


Round and round we go
Where we stop, no one will know
Round and round we go
