*beatboxing*

Here it is, a dope hit
Iceman comin' with a dope hit
Cause a few suckers need their throats slit
Jealous cause I went multi-platinum
Now I'm gonna blast 'em in the head
Till they're dead with my magnum
Lyrics might be simplistic, but I'm no simp
On the strip, cause I know how to pimp it
Now I got grip and suckers keep sinking in my quicksand
Vanilla ice, vocal hitman
Got the number 3 in my crosses, sittin' on the rooftop
*mimicking gun sounds* And you fools drop
 was a big fl-fl-flop flop
Brothers didn't like your record 'cause it wasn't hip hop hop
But this ain't a diss, cause you sold gold
Still, I made a killin' and it ain't even a 10 - 11 million
Given my rhyme spice, my DJ's on the slice
Vanilla ice is back on the map, with the wrath of the Ice King
No one will stop me
No one will stop me
No one will stop me
No one will stop me
No one will stop me
No one will stop me

Why do god shun
Why does my man try to run my actions
Why is that I disperse
Why does God shun
Why does my man try to run my actions
Oh, my living condition
Why they disperse all on my living condition, why
It's my living condition
Why they disperse all on my living condition, yeah!

Etch on a sketch on a rhyme like an architect
Now watch your back son, cause you might lose your neck
Pound-for-pound, I rock the ground I stand on
I rock records, every record at random
Flyin' heads, as the heads get fold
Thoughts and speakers get ripped and torn
To my tomb
I'm wicked as a witch on a broom stick
I smash bricks with one lick


Speak out tough 
 he never did
Hot post color, word to the mother
Me and Ross, and we in this motherfucker
 like a bullet from me gun
 gotta run
No one will stop me
No one will stop me
No one will stop me

You don't get a second chance
Causing tremors, I break the richer scales in half
Call the cops, the paramedics, the man's down
You wanna rock my bell, so I broke them down
My tongue snapped and cracked like a bull whip
And you ain't nothing but my ticky-ticky target
And as I walk through the valley of sin
