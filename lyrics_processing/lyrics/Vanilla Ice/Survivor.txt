I'm a survivor
I'm a survivor
I'm a survivor
I'm a survivor (I'm a survivor, yeah)
I'm a survivor

Yeah
Well, it's not about the industry
And it's not about the things I've been through like Nas or Jay-Z
See, I've seen a lot of things on the road to destruction
Addicted to this rap game, standin' up and bustin'
This ain't a comeback (No), this ain't a second comin' (Uh-uh)
We took a real loss when Dimebag stopped strummin'
America's in trouble, the music is dying
They said some things about me, now the rap game is lying

I'm a survivor (I've been around the block)
I'm a survivor (I'm coming out of the box)
I'm a survivor (And yet you know I won't stop)
I'm a survivor (I got this game on lock)
I'm a survivor (What you got, what you got?)
I'm a survivor (What you got, what you got?)
I'm a survivor
You don't want it, you don't want it!
You don't want it, you don't want it!
I'm a survivor
You don't want it, you don't want it!
You don't want it!

From sold out stages, to seconds from my life
To rollin' with Madonna, to wreckin' on my bike
There's some things I regret, and some I don't
Some things I take back, and some I won't
I went from style of the 90s to Dickies and Shell Toes
No matter what I'm wearing, I'm still in the hell hole
Escaped suicide from that gun on my dresser
I look into my daughter's eyes, that relieves the pressure

I'm a survivor
You don't want it, you don't want it!
You don't want it, you don't want it!
I'm a survivor
You don't want it, you don't want it!
You don't want it!

First they love you, then they hate you
Then sign you, then they rape you
Treat you like a sport, pump fake you then they shake you
And I don't want your pity 'cause I'm far from the norm
I can take what you give, I've done made through the storm
I want the whole world to know me straight through my songs
Baby when I die, let the songs live on
'Cause I'm survivin', and now you know I won't stop
I'm survivin', I'm coming out of the box!

You don't want it, you don't want it!
You don't want it, you don't want it!
I'm a survivor
You don't want it, you don't want it!
