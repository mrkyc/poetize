Hip Hop Rules, and if you didn't know
Hip Hop Rules, I kick the Ill Flow
Hip Hop Rules, I'm breakin all the news
Hip Hop Rules, from old to the new school

Big black skinny nigga, 6'4" with the .44
I got the slow flow, it sell like cold dough
In the Benzo smokin on Coco
My blood niggas say I'm true Vatos loco
For real had a Land Cruiser before my deal
Then I copped a 400 Lex and I'm set
Moving through the projects like Tyrannosaurus Rex
Shootin' Tex at sets, make a hoe clits wet
Now I cash big checks, tryin' to own assets
Built like the Aztecs, why you niggas ass bet (Remember!)

Ice Ice Baby
Drove you crazy, then I was big as Jay-Z
I got paid and I got swayze
Eatin' shrimp with my feet up made me lazy
I bought about 10 cars, about 5 cribs
Out in the woods nobody knows where I live
Got a beautiful wife and two kids
But I'm married to hip-hop and that's how it is, 'cause

It's been a long time since you seen me
On the TV, V-ICE is here for sheezy
Takin what's mine 'cause it's my time
To hit ya'll with a new style of rhyme, yeah
This is hip-rock, it can't be stopped
Bomb tha System, straight to the top
Millions of dollars, I been spendin' 'em
I love rap, I paved the way for Eminem
Needless to say, I rap back today
Ya'll forgot about me like ya'll forgot about Dre
But I'm still here, with no fear
I say what I want and make sure it's clear

Yo!
I play ball, break jaws, break all types of laws
Militant, 'cause haters wanna kill me with a cause
Feel me, I been nice since the P was free
Back when KRS was runnin' shit with BDP
I spit rap knowledgy, wack rappers follow me
Let me take you to my Shaolin temple where scholars be
Studying astronomy and the world's prophecy
Giving sight to the blind, enabling them to see
It's me; G-O-D, equal 4 plus 3
Copped a 6 with the V for the year 2G
Stay blowin' on tree, how many guns? 23
But it only take one to make you history
My clan hold me, nobody control me
So fuck a P.O. and being parolee
I write solely, light Ray Roley
Not the Bible, but I leave a church of niggas holy because...

I've got dawgs up North, I've got dawgs down South
I've got dawgs that'll smack blood out of your mouth
Then lick they hand, it's the Darkman
Brother number 12 from the Wu-Tang Clan
You heard me on GZA, you heard me on Deck
That was me with ODB that bust a Tech
La and Vanilla want money like Roc-A-Fella
If not, I'll have to pop a fella

I'm the Illest Caucasian, rhymes blazin'
I went 17 platinum, amazin'!
Now just listen to the sound I kick
Chillin' with my man La, watchin' gangsta flicks
Don't ask why I cheer for the bad guy
Maybe it's the Hydro, I'm so high
Or maybe it's the ecstasy gettin' the best of me
The industry (what) keeps on testin' me
But I won't fold, I'm just too bold
One thing about Ice: I stay cold!
