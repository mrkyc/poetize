Bring the goods, bring the goods!
Right, right!

Now here's a Zig Zag story while I'm writing this song
Sit back, relax, I'm igniting this bong
Picture this sandy beaches, dimes wearin' thongs
Serving mixed drinks to me all night long
With me feet back, puffin on my weed sack
Shit you can't believe that people ask me where you buy your trees at
Got the Bombay Ganje lime green
Sticky icky Ganja got me needing Visine
Like a magic carpet ride, come fly with me
And this is for my homies that get high with me
Just crack the Philly open cause we keep on smoking
Dimes rubbin' on lotion, feet soaking in the ocean
On a tropical Island staying sunny
We outta Phillies, take these skins, somebody roll a Mummy
Now people say money makes the world go round
So come escape with me and let's puff on a  pound

So high fly through the sky
And ride my life high
Fly through the sky
And ride my life high
Legalize it!

No ma-, no ma-, no ma-, no ma-, no-matter what you say
Feeling so alright, so Ire today
Fire de go blaze
Living condition, me smokin' it every day!
Fire de go blaze
No responsibility man, no responsible
Me I go rolling a fat blunt, smoking the fat blunt
This is my goal, take it easy Rastaman
I will now go blaze
From Kingston, Jamaica, Bombay to India
Smoking in the air
What a da da da day
Some of them are smoking weed to take away frustration
I and I do it for me aggravation
Dreadlock to Babylon are selling everyday
Come me, say, bringing it back on the boat back to the USA
With the ganja me floating, me floating away
Why not come and puff with me and then we go fly away

So high fly through the sky
And ride my life high
Fly through the sky
And ride my life high
Well it's the lime green sticky-icky bomb Holmes
Got the fat sacks, puffier than Sean Combs
It's the Iceman back, blowin' dookie out the nostrils
In the studio, creating shit that's colossal
Apostle of the green bud, see me bleamed up
In my 430 Lex off in Texas, teamed up
With the Darkman and I'm blazing
Some headbanging shit, yo, the Ice'll come equipped to spit
With the best 'cause I'm all about mine
I got dimes of smoke that'll make you float on cloud nine
Then I shine, just like a beacon in the night
Pass me the Thai, I get high on the mic
For real, a zig zag story for my peeps
Bangin' in the Jeeps while you slang it in the streets
Well it's Napalm, I'm way gone, and now it's time to bounce
It's the weed song, come with me and smoke an ounce

So high fly through the sky
And ride my life high
Fly through the sky
And ride my life high
Fly through the sky
And ride my life high
Fly through the sky
