It's the day that jumps right out at ya, ten three one the calendar
In Texas are Hellraisers born like the Chainsaw Massacre
Hills Have Eyes and Texas kids, stories about what next he did
Doctor slapped him on his ass, his head spun round like Exorcist
Bad enough for quarantine, mess with him you gonna scream
He said he had a Shining, he saw Red Rum and ever green
Omen since he was a teen, Freddy Krueger on the scene
Slicin' up MC's, spittin' out the regal guillotine
Some call him Psycho, the Norman Bates of Hip Hop
The ladies call him Alfred 'cause they all over his Hitchcock
The haters are like oshi--, they follow him with damns
They speak but then he shut'em up like Silence Of the Lambs
This ain't the Blair Witch Project, it's live and in the flesh
A V.I.C.E. flow a.k.a Faces Of Death
You might also like
With my mask I trick and treat
Spooks and freaks all over your street
It's a night to make you scream
Don't be scared it's Halloween

My flow is so psychotic, it's killin' when I'm on the scene
Just came here to party, I was born on Halloween
I do the unexpected, Michael Myers in your area
Plug up a mic and wreck it, to some ain't nothin' scarier
Causing much hysteria among other MC's
The swagger steady testin' em and I'm causin' them to freeze
Cuttin' 'em like Jason I stay on the attack
Like Ozzy did when he bit that head off of a bat
They start to see illusions, buckle under stress
Scream from confusion, hearts beatin' in their chest
They say V.Ice is killin' us, the cops make no arrest
They say nobody is feelin' us, V.Ice's got em possessed
His music is so dangerous, his flow is homicidal
He might be an American no artificial idol
He kills 'em in the club, you know it's murder for survival
Yet the people give him love like a Halloween revival

With my mask I trick and treat
Spooks and freaks all over your street
Born on Halloween, born on Halloween
Born on Halloween, born on Halloween
Born on Halloween, born on Halloween
Born on Halloween, born on Halloween

Haha! Please allow me to introduce
The Duke of the Wicked
The one and only Violent J!

I was born disfigured, disgruntled and discombobulated
In the back of a brothel, just before it got raided
I didn't open up my eyes until the eve of Halloween
Some tough they've never seen mad, I howled and screamed
I bit somebody's finger off, they threw me in a dumpster
Underneath the colored packs of trash, a little monster
Raised in the alleys, eating possums and rats
Yet every Halloween I seen I could completely relax
I can walk the streets freely, wielding a machete
Leave a body on the lawn, cut open bleedin' out spaghetti
Nobody know about me and that I lurk up in the gutters
It's wicked, everyday for me, it's a costume for these others
We don't want your nutty butters and suckers
V. Ice and Violent J born on Halloween, they can't touch us
With my mask I trick and treat
Spooks and freaks all over your street
It's a night to make you scream
Don't be scared it's Halloween
