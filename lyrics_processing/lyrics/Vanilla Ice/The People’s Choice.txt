Yup, yup
Drop it
Oh yeah, I'm gonna drop some funky lyrics
And here goes a little bit something like this
Hit it

It's not what you say, It's how you say it
Give me a microphone, on stage, I'll display it
Playing me right and you'll get played out
Like polka dots and people will shout
Dirty words cause you're a nerd
I'm first, you're third
It's absurd to think that you heard
Better rhymes than these
I'm bringing sucker mc's, down to their knees
Tease your thoughts like a feather to a toe
Although the beat seems slow
My groove will still flow
My rhymes are soulful art
That makes your heart dance
Melodic tones move your mind to a quick trance
Every time I rhyme I find the audience is
Mine, caught by every line
Sparkle like a gem with my golden voice
"Why do they love you, man?"
I'm the people's choice
You might also like
Thank you for lettin' me be myself
I wanna thank you, uh
Just thank you, baby
I wanna thank you for lettin' me be myself
I wanna thank you, uh
Just thank you, baby
Let's swing it

Step aside or you'll get stepped on
'Cause I'm steppin' real hard an' my rhymes are real strong
Just like Atilla, MC killa
A crowd thriller, no one's chiller
Than the man with the mic in his hand
I'm a trip, all the girls on my tip
Fellas are jealous so I put in the clip
Of my 9-millimeter Glock at my hip
Fifteen shells all over the place
They would chase (Ah) if it wouldn't disgrace
The date that they came with
Then that would be a diss
Tsk, tsk, they don't know what they missed
A chance to dance with the man with
The golden voice
"Why do they love you, man?"
I'm the people's choice
Thank you for lettin' me be myself
I wanna thank you, uh
Just thank you, baby
I wanna thank you for lettin' me be myself
I wanna thank you, uh
Just thank you, baby
Let's swing it


Ouh
Hit it
Sucker MC's, I scare 'em
Girlies, I gotta love 'em
Rhymes comin' out of my ears
The competition in tears
Slick dance moves by the dozen
Battles, please step up 'cause I love 'em
Settin' up suckers like pins on a bowling ball
And you all gonna fall
You won't hit, It's a bottomless pit
Of rhymes comin' straight from the mind
Of a genius and I can't be modest
When I make a threat, you bet I keep it
Like a promise so
Shake like a leaf when you see me comin'
Frankly, you're better off runnin' fast
And don't look back, wack
Go take a nap, get off that crack, Jack
Crowds move by the sound of my golden voice
"Why do they love you, man?"
I'm the people's choice
Thank you for lettin' me be myself
I wanna thank you, uh
Just thank you, baby
I wanna thank you for lettin' me be myself
I wanna thank you, uh
Just thank you, baby
