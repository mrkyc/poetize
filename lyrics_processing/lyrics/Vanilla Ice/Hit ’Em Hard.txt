Here comes the lyrical breakdown
Move out the way punk, and take a seat clown
It's the Iceman slicin', dicin', hittin' like Tyson
So, listen to the rhythm I givin' 'em
My lyrics got the impact of a Mac truck when I'm sendin' 'em
Yo, my funky rhymes flow, kickin it like Cyco
And I'm exploding like nitro-glis
Comin' like a hurricane bliss
Straight sackin' the track like a quarterback
My man Zero is back with a killer slice
I'm blowin' up the mic, you're damn right, Vanilla Ice!
With twice the punch
I put a crunch on Marky, take the funky out of his bunch
I hit the home run, you got to third base
I'm in first place, take a seat, clown, for the beatdown!

Hit 'em hard, Ice! Hit 'em hard, Ice!
Hit 'em hard, Ice! Hit 'em hard!
Hit 'em hard, Ice! Hit 'em hard, Ice!
Hit 'em hard, Ice! Hit 'em hard!
Hit 'em hard, Ice! Hit 'em hard, Ice!
Hit 'em hard, Ice! Hit 'em hard!

Uh! Tonight's the night of the big fight
With the mic in my hand, I got the grip tight
Ready to swing it like a Louisville slugger
Right at the head of a sucker
Crack, home run
How did it feel to have the mic hit your dome, son? (Raahh!)
I tried to make your head ring like a church bell
I put it on you hard, I'll make you hurt well
'Cause you fell into my booby traps
No more good vibrations, I'm tired of your booty raps
So I eat you like Scooby Snacks
Or maybe roll you like a zig zag and smoke you like a hootie mac
You did what I did, so you're gonna lose kid
Cause to me you're still a new kid on the block
Get off my jock
Get off my diznok before you get dropped for the beatdown!

Hit 'em hard, Ice! Hit 'em hard, Ice!
Hit 'em hard, Ice! Hit 'em hard!
Hit 'em hard, Ice! Hit 'em hard, Ice!
Hit 'em hard, Ice! Hit 'em hard!
Hit 'em hard, Ice! Hit 'em hard, Ice!
Hit 'em hard, Ice! Hit 'em hard!
Yeah!
This is the last verse, should I say the last round?
And its time I knock out another class clown
Sit down and take notes
As Vanilla kicks ballistics with dope lyrics
Oh what a pity, though
Cause you had to spend three million dollars on your video
It was a good video and I can admit that
All that money's wasted cause your song's wack!
I'll make stuff to make the people gather
And let 'em see us in a pit, I wanna slam dance with ya, Hammer
Now can I kick it, of course I can, yo!
You will get burned out, then turned out
I'm gonna keep comin' strong, song after song
You thought I'd fade, well you dead wrong
I'm the imperial threat for this sound, fools!
Ha ha, here comes the lyrical beatdown!

Hit 'em hard, Ice! Hit 'em hard, Ice!
Hit 'em hard, Ice! Hit 'em hard!
Hit 'em hard, Ice! Hit 'em hard, Ice!
Hit 'em hard, Ice! Hit 'em hard!
Hit 'em hard, Ice! Hit 'em hard, Ice!
