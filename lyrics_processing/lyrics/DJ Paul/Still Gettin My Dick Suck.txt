Big Feel, what's going on, baby?
What's going on, DJ, baby?
Man, nothing much, you holdin' down that Ville, right?
Man, all day 
Look, for sure I knew I had to tell you somethin', man
There's a dick suckin' dog I gotta hook you up with when you come back down to this, M, you know what I'm sayin'?
Man, spit that shit to me
Man, look, the best dick sucker I done had on this side of the motherfuckin' Tenn, man, but I got you though, you heard me?
Oh, spit it to me
I beat the pussy like it stole something
Never let her hold something
Put this dick off in her mouth claimin' that she owe something
Off the waam, I told you, ho bitch, you ain't nothin' but shit to me
A good dick suck to me
A fuck to me
But now you history
You get my dick harder than most
And I have been from coast to coast
I love the way you massage my balls
And stick my dick clean down your throat
She lived to take it up the ass
Sometimes even comes off it
And when I'm about to nut
She takes it out swallows never spits
She rubs her on clit while you hit
Rubs her on titts
A bisexual on top of that couldn't beat it with a stick
The type of girl you prayed for
The type of girl some pay for
But I done uped out the pocket
The knockin she's a groupie ho
And that's what I'm loving (lovin)
That's what I'm liking (liking)
A fan of DJ Paul is with some fucking and some diking
And I'll never diss you on a song
That there girl you can trust
But if you bullshit me ho
I'm make your ass famous
See DJ Paul LiveGet tickets as low as $27You might also like
Still getting my dick, still getting my dick
Still getting my still getting my dick sucked
From the ho that love to fuck
Good
The chewin that you be doing I can't deny
You's a pro on the dick did I say good I mean you fire
Loves to fuck in the car
Cheap motelers
It's whatever
She ain't got no preference
But I could showll be a reference
Never danced in the clubs
She claim she too shy
But that's a lie
If I ever heard a fucking lie
That bitch ain't Cleo but she got some real good conversation
That's how she hold it down cause conversation rule the nation
Come meet you anywhere
Plane, trains, or automobiles
She from out of town but I damn near think I met her on Beale
She be in all the spots
Love to hang in ATL
She got a Rolex watch
But that junt is fake as hell
Her nigga in the feds scared mayne he think shes missing
But she ain't missing
She just been hanging with some pimping
She got a blow habit
That's what I'm really loving
She come on herself and her pussy be bout hot as an oven
Still getting my dick, still getting my dick
Still getting my still getting my dick sucked
