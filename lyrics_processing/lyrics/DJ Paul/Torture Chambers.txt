The Triple 6 Mafia "Live by that Rep"
Reppin' that Memphis Tn nigga, yep
First 48, nigga we don't play
Come to my city best watch where you step
G's on the right, Lords on the left
Fuck with our town, we team up til the death
Where my crips? Where my bloods?
They takin' niggas out without even takin' a breath
Pussy niggas - we gunnin' on 'em
Runnin' up, put that llama on 'em
Empty the K, watch them lay it down
Send they down to hell, it ain't even dawned on 'em
They never even seen us comin'
Put them 100 rounds drummin' (?) some dummies
They can't even start runnin'
Left 'em in they mammas yard, now she cryin' and hummin'
This way is just the way it is
... I'ma (?) off in the club not for everyone
I just tell 'em once, never tell 'em twice
Think we playin', I be takin' they life
From on my knees, pray to Koop and Lord
Lord oh Lord and the killa of killas
Yo living room my torture chamber
Lay 'em down and cover their head with them pillows

I talk to myself 'cause there is no one to talk to
I am the cruel damn fool that will shoot you
I think of murder, murder on me mind-ah
Murder on the menu, murder all the time-ah
Murder with the .45, murder with the nine-ah
Murder, a murder is my favorite crime-ah
Blood on me street and blood on me hands-ah
Blood on me shirt and blood on me pants-ah
Niggas they die, many die, die, die niggas
I pull the trig-, pull the trig-, pull the trigger
Let's dig a grave, dig a grave, the gravediggers
Six, to the six, to the six Mafia Niggas
Come walk with me, journey to the edge of hell-ah
Firearms, fire storms, bring your umbrella
Indo's creating illusions of grandeur
The unknown, amazed
Damn I think I'm Crazed
