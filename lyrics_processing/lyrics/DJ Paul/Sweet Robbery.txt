It's on tonight!

But now my niggas talking about robbing, well
Jump into the Chevy, hit the dashboard, get the mask

Chillin' on a porch, firin' a torch to the light green
Weed then proceed to my mission as I plot a scheme
Meanwhile the sun set, trees blowing spookiness
Twist the doorknob to my crib, inside was the mask and Tech
Creepin' through the dark of my job takin' yams
Expose ya on yo whealthiness, heavy lemons I'm shuttin' 'em down
Enterin' the green Chevy, poppin' openin' the dash
Fast reaching for the mask *uh* damn pop a blast
First I scoop Koopsta too, find out details on this lame
(Shieet there them niggas over at the corner mane)
Keys for the sellin' is what he got for me to come over and stang
Hidin' on a side on a tree, even though them bitches sleep
I continuously creep and sneak to the window, take a peep
Knowin' I'm nervous plus I'm anxious, I just kicked a back door in
Bitches hit the floor and find the dope so I can get in the wind
Bullets will scatter if I don't get mine all the time, so nigga don't make me turn mean
Pick up the baby that's smelling like shit, throw his lil ass in the washing machine BITCH

But now my niggas talking about robbing
Jump into the Chevy, hit the dashboard, get the mask

I hear commands in my head from my master (Killa Man!)
Forcin' me to rush tha bullets in the back of da
Little bitty baby (Prove to me you're crazy!)
So I shot from my Glock, bloody spots don't faze me
So slick, 666 shit got me dreaming
I've seen some fire, I'm thinkin' "hell I hear lil kids screaming"
One angel popped up and said "You know you're wrong"
But one demon came along and said "Shoot that tone!"
But yo the devil got the advantage cause I'm full of da weed
He said stang on them bitches like a bumblebee
I shot holes in the cars then everybody grabbed they ears
But yo I rather like keep it quiet so I slapped on the silencer
The nigga with the dope fell dead on his feet
Beggin' me not to kill nobody else, then he brought in the dope, like I thought: two or three keys
Murder, help me come clean, the angel was warnin' me
The devil controlled me to a sweet robbery
