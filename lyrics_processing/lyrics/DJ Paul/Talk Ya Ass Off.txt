Talkin' ya ass off? nigga, let's see what you can do
When I got my glizzock pressed up at your nappy ass head
Don't say it wasn't you, fool
Shootin' on yo sissy bitch ass, it's easy, no need to get emotional
'Cause first of all everything is business, ain't shit personal
A hundred times I caught your ass slippin'
All high off the drugs I could've start trippin' and rippin' your head off
With the tech 9, but you don't hear it
Trying to test my pimpin' I'll run up on you
Cockin' it, you will feel it poking up your nose, boogers on my barrel
Pull the trigger back and watch your head just scatter
Go to the funeral, 'cause some shit like that it's straight to me
Ridin' in the land with yo folks 'til you tried to play me
Bitch, I don't fuck around, I'll put your ass underground
You know you good as gone when you hear the (gunshots) sound
You run your mouth, but eventually you'll have to pay the cost
For talkin' your funky ass off, busta'!

Now niggas always talking that fuckin' shit
Sayin' what they do but never doin' it
Talkin' ya ass off? I'm blowin' yo ass off, there's nothin' to it
I got a tech that'll take yo' ass out
And if you don't believe me just try me
I bet your sissy ass get ran up by the Triple 6 Mafia
Got you fools, petty fools complain, oh, come the Scarecrow
With the shit, all of us packin' the thangs
And my niggas down, my niggas down to clown
Oh you? Oh you too? You don't have a fucking clue, fool
You just talk a lot of shit, but shit don't impress me
You better bring it on if you willin' to try and even test me
A vest see can never even save you when I start to bust
Automatic rounds coming at you from every end, watch your head bust!
