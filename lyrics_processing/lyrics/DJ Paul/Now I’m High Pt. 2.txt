Ho, why these bitches quick to jump
To get they mothafuckin' head bump?
I popped my trunk and then I blast them tr'izz'icks with my pump
Here because of the shit that a nigga had committin'
When I hit 'em from the night before
'Cause then I sworn I had to take them busta to the morgue
So sweat this low, I have to go out like Charles Manson
The Koopsta committin' evil sins with the mind of Satan
A mothafuckin' hard lead, nervous in the head
And yeah, it's gonna be another nigga dead
Twistin' on my dreads while I'm loadin' up my milli' rounds
So we can gonna spray and buck these busta bitches down
Oh, 'cause I'm really, really tired of hearin' babbage shit
So let me get them tricks and label this the crucifix
The Koopsta's from the Ville where the Devil shit for real
My type of killa leave you burnin' in the cornfield
Because yo' god got you niggas thinkin' you damn hard
I break ya apart and have a ritual in the fuckin' park

Bitches bodies chopped in bits and guts and shit off in my trunk
