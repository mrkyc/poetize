Ballin' through my hood, ain't you clean fool
Show love finna get stuck up
Tell that bitch ain't my thing, sweet black sugar fuckin' stang
Laid back, Glock tight, full of that Tanqueray
When I scope I hope a nigga drop off that cheese
I don't wanna hurt nobody unless I gotta click for them keys, mane let's stick up these
H-izz-oe in the h-izz-oe sp-izz-ot, G-I-M-I Sum, Lil Buck
Pistol grip, pistol whip, don't you trip without yo clip my nig
If you ain't kinfolk, Deuce double one is what me do
Biddy bop me Glock pop on yo chest
Unless you brought yo bulletproof
I'm jealous, fellas roll too clean
I gotta get mine so I wanna take yours
Smack me with somethin', not locked, fuck bitches, gonna kick it on in
Don't you shout, don't you make no noise
I'm down to die for mine all the time
Lay yo bitch ass down clown, seventeen rounds
I can shoot at yo face, I won't miss, turn on this
Infrared got you scared, Pappa Paul pluggin' heads
Jack be nimble, get jacked so quick
Jack with a Jason mask on that bitch
Terrifyin' these niggas soul, 666 we like that shit

I'm chiefin', I'm smokin' (?) keep me high
Indo go up in my mind, cappin' these bitches (?)
(?) from the South
Gimme da fuckin' cheese trick before I commence to pull my yawk
Bullet to ya scapula, bitch don't gimme no hesitation
Cuz a nigga like 411, I'm quick to click with aggravation
Determination in my blood, wait for a bitch or nigga to splurge
I'm creepin' (?) I'm robbin' you niggas (?)
When I strap my .45 Glock I'm constantly creepin' that's no surprise
Nigga this ain't no bad dream, open yo mothafuckin' eyes
Finga on da trigga, thinkin' crazy when I'm anxiously
(?) in the progress of a robbery
No need for the 411 to ask for ya mothafuckin' stash spot
Prepared to cap yo ass in da head and run off with yo fuckin' rocks
(?) scene
Another pimp from the South, 411, I'm comin' clean
