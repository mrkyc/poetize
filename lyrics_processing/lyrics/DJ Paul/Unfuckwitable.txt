We "Unfuckwitable" man
That mean no person, nothing, no shit can fuck your mood up right about now
Fuck these suckers, they can't touch me
I'm killin' these bitches

Fuck that busta, fuck that busta
Kill that sucker, kill that sucker
Fuck that busta, fuck that busta
Kill that sucker, kill that sucker

I'm Unfuckwitable
Haters wanna make me mad but they can't
Brand new whip, candy rims full of paint
Still ballin' like before, what ya think?
Puttin' millions in this bank
I'm Unfuckwitable

See I am that nigga and I been that nigga, nah
It ain't shit new 'bout nothin' that I do now
Got a few crews, I had a few 
Click, click - it's a motherfuckin' Ruger Nine
You know I keep that Ruger Nine, bitch holla I call in Nine Nine
My bullets will make 'em go bye, bye
That must mean they bullets don't fly by 
Don't start my nigga, get some  my nigga
Get pulled out yo motherfuckin' car my nigga
Get laid on yo own front yard and robbed in front of yo broad, on God, my nigga
I'm still that dude, still break da law - I don't play by rules
All these millions didn't make me they just laced me with some extra juice
I can't be faded, I'm too turned out to even play around
They loved me when I was down, now they hate 'cause I'm stackin' 
I'm the King with a crown, I'ma be that now and even when I'm underground
 my nigga be found right on Beale Street  gold and a crown, hoe!
