Man
Shit fucked up out here, bruh
Soon as a nigga try to clean up, they tryna put a nigga back on the concrete
They lay a nigga off
Already out on bail
Owe 20K on my bond
Child support gone to my DL's
Shit fucked up, man
Shit ain't adding up, bruh
Nigga ain't got no other choice, man
Nigga ain't got no motherfucking choice

I was down on my luck, I was fucked up
I just needed something just to make it through the day
Nobody gave me nothing, nobody gave a fuck
So I had to get that Glock and do that shit the easy way
I was down on my luck, I was fucked up
I just needed something just to make it through the day
Nobody gave me nothing, nobody gave a fuck
So I had to get that Glock and do that shit the easy way

I come from a city where niggas don't play about that pay
He ain't happy that nigga ain't eating, best be staying up out they way
But I was turned into a good guy, I turned the other cheek
I put my family first, ain't wishin' to be in a hearse
"I'm out these streets!" - at least that's what I thought
Until I went to work, they told me I was layed off
Just got a crib for my children, how I'm gon' pay it off?
Finally got this job anyway, cause my past is bad
Now they 'bout to turn me back into a fuckin' badass
Back to poppin that shit (you can tell), lay 'em down, put 'em in the trunk
Send a plot to they niggas "Mississippi River" drop 'em, watch 'em, sunk
Fire up the blunt, laugh it off, we're cracking them bottles, blastin all
Looking in the bank account money still growing, no matter the cost, I'm breakin' da law
But I ain't tryna get back into all of that
Already got all of my guys in retirement
But they tryna turn me back into that old Paul
Still got all my hitters on speed dial - it's a roll call!

I guess you could say I was strivin' for something like that would never 
I would throw myself in front of that bus, a truck, a moving train
But if you ain't never had to come up with a real way without a way to get a couple dollars legally
Then we just ain't the same, and what I say don't pertain financially
Now back in the day when I was a teenager, life was a little more simple but not by much
Same place that I lay down my head, I fight my trust
And on that ouija board you see the devil come and talk to me
Maybe that's why now these talks of robbery don't bother me
Stick a store, liquor store
Cock it back, hit the floor
Gimme that bag, need that bag
Not to buy my bitch Couture
Yours is mine, all of it
Nothing less, something more
Mask on, broad day, welcome to my mental war
Stick, stick, move quick
One dip, move bitch
Old school, sit and crank
Next store, hit the bank
No plans, fuck a plan
Paper flying out the vent
Blood dripping, tie 'em up, look momma no hands
I was down on my luck, I was fucked up
I just needed something just to make it through the day
Nobody gave me nothing, nobody gave a fuck
So I had to get that Glock and do that shit the easy way

Now I'm pretty honest but this is the ugly truth
I feel like I'm under voodoo
We are not getting any younger and I have no fountain of youth (youth)
I don't need wisdom dude, I need to pull a caper like a wisdom tooth
Rob you in front of yo children, then stop for a second and tell them to stay in school, M
Nigga don't slip fore you get tore up by pistol grip
First we send that lil hoe in his crib to scope how he live
Then kick the front door to the floor bitch don't move just show me your grip
Niggas hit the floor for keys, bitches get up on your knees
Don't be a one-eight-seven in this two-eleven, just gimme the g's
Money funny like Hughley, tip on the belt like gratuity
Where yo community, huh?
It just like it's 2 of me, body double like a movie scene, but we ain't fakin' this
What was this? Robbery shit, I be touring
Bitch I'm a general, I feel like Shaq with insurance
F-Funky Hill, y'all with the union
Gimme my ransom bitch I ain't down with 
Whatever, wherever, whenever, whoever
I put that mask on like I'm Hannibal Lecter
Niggas gon' drop it off when they under pressure
Cause these niggas know I don't play like Alexa
Masked men ran in as we move the dead men
They say give it up or you're a bunch of dead men
We get the loot, stash the money in the trash bag
