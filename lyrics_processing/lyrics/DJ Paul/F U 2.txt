You sayin' fuck me? I say fuck you too
You sayin' fuck me? I say fuck you too
You wanna hate me? Huh, I can hate too
You wanna hate me? Huh, homie, I can hate too
You sayin' fuck me? I say fuck you too

You wanna hate me? Huh, I can hate too
You wanna hate me? Huh, homie, I can hate too

I'm 'bout to go ham on a bitch nigga
 everybody slam here bitch nigga
And put your ho in a choke hold
Same time I got my dick down her throat hole
I'm a motherfucking mad man
Just downed about thirty fuckin' beer cans
Smoked a blunt and hit whole line of coke
Popped a pill, now I'm 'bout to whoop a ho
I was hopin' that nobody fuck with me tonight
I'm on so many drugs, it won't even be a fair fight
I'm a monster, puff so many trees
Now this liquor that's kickin' into me
, nigga
'Cause I'm the master of evil
Pull a stunt crazy as Evel Knievel
And there won't be a fucking sequel
'Cause I'ma kill you in front of all of these people

They say fuck me, no, I wouldn't say that
I'm in a homicidal rage, and this ain't a play gat
I'll headbutt your nose 'til it flows, crack crack splat
And my barrel to your belly goes pat pat pat
You can call me a flake, it's no mistake
I put my hands around your neck, and just shake shake shake
Because I hate you, decapitate you
The hottest pits of Hell's hole is where I take you
Psychopathic, DJ Paul and the wicked clown
We dug a hole for your body, and we kicks it down
I'm like Frankenstein, it's gankin' time
I need your heart, pull your ribs apart, and thanks, it's mine

I got twenty-two   nigga what's up
, keeping it country, keepin' it , and keepin' it 
 blowing that smoke
When I talk about style, bitch what style, you were lookin' the same since 
I evolve, I provoke, married to music, I elope

Bounce bounce bounce, got that shit that'll make 
Thirty-six inches on my  all this traffic
Move to the right, like a twister never know which house I'll be trashing
Could it be yours, maybe it's his,  it is
All of this hate that I consume, from the world, from the feds
From the streets, from the woods, from the backroads to any hoods
I'm a revolutionary, a chariot carryin' the goods
 check your bitch, you don't really want it with the clique
I show up like Freddy Krueger, hold your hand, slit your wrist
With that , the heart of a lion
The soul of a leader, I refuse, I'm defiant
So tell me what you think, I tell you what I know
With S-O-U-T-H-E-R-N-B-O-Y-S at my shows, motherfucker

You sayin' fuck me? I say fuck you too
You sayin' fuck me? I say fuck you too
You wanna hate me? Huh, I can hate too
You wanna hate me? Huh, homie, I can hate too
You sayin' fuck me? I say fuck you too
You sayin' fuck me? I say fuck you too
You wanna hate me? Huh, I can hate too
