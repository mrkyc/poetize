DJ Paul KOM, I'm lookin' for backends
Just left the bank and I literally gotta go back in
I'm in that Bentley, bitch, or that Rolls, so you know they hate to see me back in
Yo bitch was cool and her head a fool, cool on her face so I hit from the back end
I got a MAC-10, I'm never lackin' and these little niggas are not in my bracket
I need bands over pussy, send a bag over to me
Birds in the box, box full of birds, bitch, like I'm Sandra Bullock
I was makin' them M's in the M when niggas was sayin' I couldn't
I used to have to go bust down a pound, now I'm bustin' down some jewelry

Packs in, in a pot like Jambalaya, a batch
