I shall not fear no man but God
Though I walk through the valley of death
I shed so many tears
If I should die before I wake
Please God walk with me
Grab a nigga and take me to Heaven

Back in elementary, I thrived on misery
Left me alone, I grew up amongst a dyin' breed
Inside my mind couldn't find a place to rest
Until I got that Thug Life tatted on my chest, tell me, can you feel me?
I'm not livin' in the past, you wanna last?
Be the first to blast, remember Kato
No longer with us, he's deceased
Call on the sirens, seen him murdered in the streets, now he rest in peace
Is there a heaven for a G? Remember me
So many homies in the cemetery, shed so many tears
Chorus: 2Pac, 2Pac & Shock G
Ahh, I suffered through the years
And shed so many tears
Lord, I lost so many peers
And shed so many tears
You might also like
Now that I'm strugglin' in this business, by any means
Label me greedy gettin' green, but seldom seen
And fuck the world 'cause I'm cursed
I'm havin' visions of leavin' here in a hearse, God, can you feel me?
Take me away from all the pressure and all the pain
Show me some happiness again, I'm goin' blind
I spend my time in this cell, ain't livin' well
I know my destiny is Hell, where did I fail?
My life is in denial and when I die
Baptized in eternal fire, I'll shed so many tears
Refrain: 2Pac, 2Pac & Shock G
Lord, I suffered through the years and shed so many tears
Lord, I lost so many peers and shed so many tears

Now I'm lost and I'm weary, so many tears
I'm suicidal, so don't stand near me
My every move is a calculated step
To bring me closer to embrace an early death, now there's nothin' left
There was no mercy on the streets, I couldn't rest
I'm barely standin', about to go to pieces, screamin' peace
And though my soul was deleted, I couldn't see it
I had my mind full of demons tryin' to break free
They planted seeds and they hatched, sparkin' the flame
Inside my brain like a match, such a dirty game
No memories, just a misery
Paintin' a picture of my enemies killin' me in my sleep
Will I survive 'til the morning to see the Sun?
Please Lord, forgive me for my sins, 'cause here I come
Refrain: 2Pac, 2Pac & Shock G
Lord! (God!) I suffered through the years and shed so many tears
God, I lost so many peers

Lord knows I, tried, been a witness to homicide
Seen drive-by's takin' lives, little kids die
Wonder why as I walk by
Broken-hearted as I glance at the chalk line, gettin' high
This ain't the life for me, I wanna change
But ain't no future bright for me, I'm stuck in the game
I'm trapped inside a maze
See this Tanqueray influenced me to gettin' crazy, disillusioned lately
I've been really wantin' babies
So I could see a part of me that wasn't always shady, don't trust my lady
'Cause she's a product of this poison
I'm hearin' noises, think she's fuckin' all my boys, can't take no more
I'm fallin' to the floor
Beggin' for the Lord to let me in to Heaven's door, shed so many tears (God please help me)
Refrain: 2Pac, Shock G, 2Pac & Shock G
Lord, I lost so many years (I suffered through the years) and shed so many tears
I lost so many peers and shed so many tears
Lord, I suffered through the years and shed so many tears
