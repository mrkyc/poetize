Never!
You ain't never had a friend like me!
Believe that!
'Cause you ain't never had a friend like me!

See, at night I watch the sky, I take another breath
I smoke my Newport to the butt like it's the last motherfucker left
Just me and you evading enemies
Let you get my last shot of Hennessy, ain't never had a friend like me
Remember memories so vividly
Was once a little dust kicker now becomes a G
Who can I call when they all fail
Collect calls to my dogs from the county jail, sending me mail
Heard the block's in the same shape
Ain't nothing changed, niggas slanging at the same place
The same faces suppose to always hate our foes
This lifestyle lives forever, watch the game unfold
Shedding crocodile tears, just got life plus
And you wonder if these white judges like us
Just stay strong, we'll appeal, nigga, you'll be free
Down with ya to the very end 'cause you ain't never had a friend like me
You might also like
I'm down for you so ride with me
My enemies your enemies
'Cause you ain't ever had a friend like me
Nobody knows where we'll be
My enemies your enemies
'Cause you ain't never had a friend like me
I'm down for you so ride with me
My enemies your enemies
'Cause you ain't ever had a friend like me
Nobody knows where we'll be
My enemies your enemies
'Cause you ain't never had a friend like me

How can I be blamed? Forgive me, Lord, I'm insane
In search of fame, won't hurt to change
Following the foot steps of past dealers
Equipped with Ski masks, no witnesses, we blast squealers
And now they feel us in this act of war, more casualties, no survivors
Any man that defy us, quickly dies 'cause we riders
In my quest for chips
We wear vests, equipped with automatic fire we reply when my enemies trip
Me and you against the nation, whispering while we conversatin'
'Cause niggas died over information
How much more can we take, expect us all to wait
The world ain't ready for us yet so let's make Clinton pay
They never wanted us to make it
Everything that we possess, we had to fight and take it
I think the President is smokin' weed, bumpin' this beat
Makin' a livin' out of my misery 'til he got a friend like me
I'm down for you so ride with me
My enemies your enemies
'Cause you ain't ever had a friend like me
Nobody knows where we'll be
My enemies your enemies
'Cause you ain't never had a friend like me
I'm down for you so ride with me
My enemies your enemies
'Cause you ain't ever had a friend like me
Nobody knows where we'll be
My enemies your enemies
'Cause you ain't never had a friend like me

Promise to visit, I know it's rough in your cell
Receiving mail to the county jail, this is hell
When I was younger I could picture livin'
In luxury
So how the fuck did I end up in prison
Fuckin' snitches, they got me crossed by my own side
I found him by his self, no drama, he alone die
Nobody cry, should have never testified
You got my nigga 25, so now I sacrifice your life
Help to separate me and my dog
Broken ties, why the fuck should I let you live when I'm dead inside?
Rapid fire my delivery
I'm bustin' at they whole crew nigga, remember me
Hit up my Outlawz set then throw my pistol in the ocean
Ditch my ski mask and get to straight coastin'
It's visitin' day at San Quentin, always there to see your closest roaddog
'Cause you ain't ever had a friend like me
I'm down for you so ride with me
My enemies your enemies
'Cause you ain't ever had a friend like me
Nobody knows where we'll be
My enemies your enemies
'Cause you ain't never had a friend like me
I'm down for you so ride with me
