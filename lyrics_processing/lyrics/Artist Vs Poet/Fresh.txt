Lying eyes and flashing lights
I think I've been here before
And you caught me by surprise
I said I'm taking you home

Yeah you
Girl I'm impressed, I wanna bet
That it's true
That I'm the best, you never had

Have you ever been around another man like me?
Gets down like me, sounds like me
Have you ever met a motherfucker fresh like me?
Got you on your knees, with your ripped jeans
You
Are you ready for it?
Are you ready for it?
You

Take a shot, lemon drop
Then we rock all night
You might also like
Now you got your hands on me
I didn't tell you to stop
Somewhere they shouldn't be
I didn't tell you to stop

Yeah you
Girl I'm impressed, I wanna bet
That it's true
That I'm the best, you never had

Have you ever been around another man like me?
Gets down like me, sounds like me?
Have you ever met a motherfucker fresh like me?
Got you on your knees, with your ripped jeans
You
Are you ready for it?
Are you ready for it?
You

Take a shot, lemon drop
Then we rock all night
Then we rock all night
Then we rock all night
Then we rock all night
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Have you ever been around another man like me?
Gets down like me, sounds like me?
Have you ever met a motherfucker fresh like me?
Got you on your knees, with your ripped jeans
You
Are you ready for it?
Are you ready for it?
