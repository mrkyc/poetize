For the designated driver
'Cause it's me and whoever
And you know we won't remember
Sorry for what I'm 'bout to do
Turning 21 is a bitch to go through
Before we take a drink, let's toast
To the 'never have I ever's'
'Cause tonight is the night
That we'll talk about forever
So take my keys and hide my cell phone
If I turn into trouble, at least I warned you
Let's recap and get caught up
No one said enough's enough
I let go the better part of me
I guess I had a damn rough night
I'm still piecing it together
There's a girl in my bed
And I haven't even met her
I had a damn rough night
And I can't even remember
Threw my clothes in the fire
And I turned into a streaker

Turning 21 is a bitch to go through
All these crazy things we do
Turning 21 is a bitch to go through
I heard I was a big chaotic
Mess at the occasion
Was a total disaster and
Now I'm fading faster
I'll keep the score never realized
So I pass the time until I feel alive
And I am not like this all the time
Let's recap and get caught up
No one said enough's enough
I let go the better part of me
I guess I had a damn rough night
I'm still piecing it together
There's a girl in my bed
And I haven't even met her
I had a damn rough night
And I can't even remember
Threw my clothes in the fire
And I turned into a streaker
Sorry for what I'm 'bout to do
Turning 21 is a bitch to go through
All these crazy things we do
Turning 21 is a bitch to go through
And if I had the chance
You know I'd do it all again
And if I had the chance
You know I'd do it all again
Looks like I had a damn rough night
I'm still piecing it together
There's a girl in my bed
And I haven't even met her
They say I had a damn rough night
And I can't even remember
Threw my clothes in the fire
And I turned into a streaker
Sorry for what I'm 'bout to do
Turning 21 is a bitch to go through
All these crazy things we do
Turning 21 is a bitch to go through
Sorry for what I'm 'bout to do
Turning 21 is a bitch to go through
All these crazy things we do
Turning 21 is a bitch to go through
