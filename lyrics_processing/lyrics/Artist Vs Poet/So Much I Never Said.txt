Whoa, oh, ohh, whoa, oh, ohh
You pack me up and send me off
I thought you might be angry
The world was dark and it was cold
No, I don't know this city
Not giving up, impatiently
I determine the two, wait, it might be three
Won't you come back just for my sake?
'Cause what we had can't be replaced
Everyone has somewhere to go
How am I gonna make my way back home?
It's bad enough
Stranded in a different time zone
What happened to us?
'Round and 'round, it never ends
And you don't come back
There's so much
So much I never said
Whoa, oh, ohh, whoa, oh, ohh
Whoa, oh, ohh, whoa, oh, ohh
You might also likeI thought I heard them say your name
On the overhead loudspeaker
The time has passed, that was yesterday
This place is overwhelming
It's sinking in gradually
That you're not coming back for me
All these high hopes weigh heavily
Feels like an eternity
No one else was left alone
How am I gonna make my way back home?
It's bad enough
Stranded in a different time zone
What happened to us?
'Round and 'round, it never ends
And you don't come back
There's so much
So much I never said
Whoa, oh, ohh, whoa, oh, ohh
Whoa, oh, ohh, whoa, oh, ohh
I feel so lost
Is it terminal?
How am I gonna make my way back home?
It's bad enough
Stranded in a different time zone
What happened to us?
'Round and 'round, it never ends
And you don't come back
There's so much
So much I never said
How am I gonna make my way back home?
It's bad enough
Stranded in a different time zone
What happened to us?
'Round and 'round, it never ends
And you don't come back
There's so much
So much I never said
Whoa, oh, ohh, whoa, oh, ohh
