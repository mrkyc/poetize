So good at this wrong that it feels right
And I saw this coming with the time
But nobody knows, nobody knows
And we tell ourselves, just to tell ourselves
Not to tell ourselves that we're both in hell
Caught up in the darkness, new light
We look so good from the outside
So damn good from the outside
If all we do is think and miscommunicate
Well girl there ain't no use in breaking up
And if you feel me when I say it then I'll just see you later
Cause there ain't no use in waiting up
Waiting up
Waiting on me, girl
Waiting on me, girl
Ohh
I just can't stand to see you happy
More than I love to see you sad
I used to say you were there for me
Now I wish that you would run from me
Then maybe I wouldn't feel so bad
And we tell ourselves, uh just to tell ourselves
Not to tell ourselves that this little old game we play
We play so we don't give ourselves away
Cause we look so good from the outside
So damn good from the outside
If all we do is think and misscomunicate
Well girl there ain't no use in breaking up
And if you feel me when I say it then I'll just see you later
Cause there ain't no use in waiting up
Waiting up
Waiting on me
Waiting on me, girl
Waiting on me, girl
Oh yeah
Miscommunicate
Oh yeah
Miscommunicate
If all we do is think and misscomunicate
Well girl there ain't no use in breaking up
And if you feel me when I say it then I'll just see you later
Cause there ain't no use in waiting up
Waiting up
Waiting on me
Waiting on me, girl
Waiting on me, girl
