To this boy 'cause you got him head over heels
I swear I never turn my phone off and just watch the clock hoping I might hear from you
'Cause hey girl I think it's time you know the truth
I'm crazy 'bout you, I'm crazy 'bout you
And there's no reply when I try to ask what you're doing
I'm thinking it's time to hit up all your friends
But you're a disappearing act, you're a ghost like Casper but not so friendly
I'm thinking girl when's all this gonna end?
And it's all that I can do
Not to fall for the way you move
You just go and I will keep on running, running, running
And it's all that I can do
Not to fall for those baby blues
You just go and I will keep on running, running
I'm crazy 'bout you
And hey girl you got the cutest face when you're lyin'
To this boy 'cause he falls for it every time
I kinda like the dirty way that you play this game 'cause at least you're playing
I'm thinking girl, you're my favourite waste of time
And it's all that I can do
Not to fall for the way you move
You just go and I will keep on running, running, running
And it's all that I can do
Not to fall for those baby blues
You just go and I will keep on running, running
I never know what to do
When you're around you can see it too
So it's time you tell me the truth 'cause
I want you, all of you
I never know what to do
When you're around you can see it too
So it's time you tell me the truth 'cause
I want you, all of you
Hey girl, I think you know just what you're doin'
To this boy 'cause you got him head over heels
And it's all that I can do
Not to fall for the way you move
You just go and I will keep on running, running, running
And it's all that I can do
Not to fall for those baby blues
You just go and I will keep on running, running
I never know what to do
When you're around you can see it too
So it's time you tell me the truth 'cause
I want you, all of you
I never know what to do
When you're around you can see it too
So it's time you tell me the truth 'cause
