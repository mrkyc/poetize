There's just no fire left in you
There's just no time for pushing through
And I'm thinking if you only knew
The pain you put me through
You'd back out, back out again

Back out, back out again
Back out, back out again
Back out, back out again

And I wish that I could fake it every single day
But I'm left with the scars from the parts that I can't repair
And I was sure you'd take it all away
But that's just a dream that I had, now I gotta let you go
'Cause you're making me crazy
And I'm serious, baby

And I took the time to look away
And I took the time to turn the page
And I'm sick of working every day
To give you everything
'Cause you'll only back out, back out again
You might also like
Back out, back out again
Back out, back out again
Back out, back out again

And I wish that I could fake it every single day
But I'm left with the scars from the parts that I can't repair
And I was sure you'd take it all away
But that's just a dream that I had, now I gotta let you go
'Cause you're making me crazy
And I'm serious, baby

And you know
Oh, I gotta let you go
You know, you know, you know
Oh, I gotta let you go
You know

I wish that I could fake it every single day
But I'm left with the scars from the parts that I can't repair
And I was sure you'd take it all away
But that's just a dream that I had, now I gotta let you go
Oh, you know
You know, you know, you know
You know, you know, know
I know, yeah
I know
