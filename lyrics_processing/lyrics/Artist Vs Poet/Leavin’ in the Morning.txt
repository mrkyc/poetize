Waking up in your bed, saying sorry in advance
'Cause I'll be right back here again
And come tomorrow morning
You know it's just a full warning
That I'll be right back here again
And again, and again
And again, and again

And can you forgive me?

For dressing you up, dressing you down
Fucking you up, bringing you down
And I won't feel guilty at all when I'm done
Dressing you down and fucking you up
'Cause I'm leavin' in the morning
'Cause I'm leavin' in the morning
No

Oh
So here we are again
Are we lovers, are we friends?
I just take what I can get
And again, and again
I'll just pretend
'Cause we both know how it ends
And I don't know why you're fallin' apart
All I did was break your heart
You might also like
And now I'm dressin' you up, dressin' you down
Fucking you up, bringing you down
And I won't feel guilty at all when I'm done
Dressin' you down and fuckin' you up
'Cause I'm leavin' in the morning
'Cause I'm leavin' in the morning
No
'Cause I'm leavin' in the morning
No

Oh, we've always been a label, baby
All since I don't know when
You should've known better than this, baby
'Cause you know I'm a rambling man
Oh, we've always been a label, baby
All since I don't know when
You should've known better than this, baby
'Cause you know I'm a rambling man

Tell me, can you forgive me?
Can you forgive me?

For dressin' you up, dressin' you down
Fuckin' you up, bringin' you down
And I won't feel guilty at all, 'cause I'm done
Dressin' you down and fuckin' you up
And I won't feel, I won't feel, I won't feel, I won't feel
Anything at all, 'cause I'm fuckin' you up
And I'm leavin' in the morning
'Cause I'm leavin' in the morning
