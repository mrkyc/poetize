Ba, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da
Ba, da, da, da, da, da
Ba, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da
What's it gonna take to wake me up
From this black hole I've been living in?
I see my body shake, it's tensing up
My vitals won't be givin' in
Wake me up
(Ooh, woo, ooh) I've found what I've been missin' lately
(Ooh, woo, ooh) It's the reason why my heart's been racing
It took a car crash to turn it around
I've figured it out- that I don't have it down
(Ooh, woo, ooh) I gotta get my feet back on the ground
Ba, da, da, da, da, da
Ba, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da
This isn't at all what I expected-
To be stranded, drifting all alone
How can I stay cool, calm, and collected
When my world's been turned and overthrown?
You might also likeAll I can remember was the brake lights flashing
The sound of the crash, and gasping for air
It begs the question:
Is this the end?
My last impression:
The end of the world
Wake me up
(Ooh, woo, ooh) I've found what I've been missin' lately
(Ooh, woo, ooh) It's the reason why my heart's been racing
It took a car crash to turn it around
I've figured it out- that I don't have it down
(Ooh, woo, ooh) I gotta get my feet back on the ground
The lights and sounds
They are getting closer now
As they surround
I realize I will make it out
And as they pull me from the wreckage
The stretcher's coming, it's just what I need
Wake me up
And it's obvious...
(Ooh, woo, ooh) I've found what I've been missin' lately
(Ooh, woo, ooh) It's the reason why my heart's been racing
It took a car crash to turn it around
I've figured it out- that I don't have it down
(It took a car crash to turn it around.)
(Ooh, woo, ooh) I've found what I've been missin' lately
(Ooh, woo, ohh) It's the reason why my heart's been racing
It took a car crash to turn it around
I've figured it out- that I don't have it down
(It took a car crash to turn it around.)
(Ooh, woo, ohh) I finally get my feet back on the ground
Ba, da, da, da, da, da
