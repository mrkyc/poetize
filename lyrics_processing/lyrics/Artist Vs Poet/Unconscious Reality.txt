Don't know how long it's been since my eyes were shut
And they're burning and twisting and turning
The lonely nights, a tired morning
I'm isolated, awake at 5 a.m
I'm motivated and pluggin' the clock again
I lose track of when this day ends
And the next one begins
(So eventually)
I'll take another pill to fall asleep
And slip into unconscious reality
I slowly fade away and begin this dream
Where the pieces fit so easily
I walk around like an outcast to all the lights
And the sounds, losing grip of everything
I gaze away and dream more in the day
(Losing time, losing sleep, I can't escape)
I'll make it somehow
I'm not sure just how that may be
I'll fake it till I find a cure
I'll just assume for now I'll have to

And slip into unconscious reality
I slowly fade away and begin this dream
Where the pieces fit so easily
I'm never really awake
But I'm not asleep, no, I'm not asleep
I try to fade away and begin this dream
Where the pieces fit so easily
And don't wait and please wake me up
('Cause I'm not here to answer)
And don't wait, please wake me up
(Can't you hear my pleading?)
I'll make it somehow, I'm not sure
I'll just assume for now I'll have to
Take another pill to fall asleep
And slip into unconscious reality
I slowly fade away and begin this dream
Where the pieces fit so easily
I'm never really awake
But I'm not asleep, no, I'm not asleep
I try to fade away and begin this dream
Where the pieces fit so easily
I'm never really awake
But I'm not asleep, no, I'm not asleep
I try to fade away and begin this dream
Where the pieces fit so easily
Woah, oh, ohh, woah, oh, ohh
