I still haven't recovered yet
But you can bet I won't forget
This is what I get
What I get when I hang around
Making love on a jetplane
Throwing money 'cause we're getting paid
Doing fine and we can't complain
This is what I get
What I get when I hang around
A shit date on the promenade
Kicked out on the boulevard
We're fucked up from all of the bars
That's what I get
What I get when I hang around you
That's what I get
What I get when I hang around you
That's what I get
What I get when I hang around you
That's what I get
What I get when I hang around you
That's what I get
What I get when I hang around
You and I taking long drives
And making out by the riverside
You're hitting on all the other guys
This is what I get
What I get when I hang around
Promising we were meant to be
You and I for eternity
Look at that you're leaving me
That's what I get
What I get when I hang around
A shit date on the promenade
Kicked out on the boulevard
We're fucked up from all of the bars
That's what I get
What I get when I hang around you
That's what I get
What I get when I hang around you
This is what I get
What I get when I hang around you
That's what I get
What I get when I hang around you
That's what I get
What I get when I hang around
Can't you see what you're doing to me girl
You know I'll always hang around
You know I can't walk away
I just can't get out
Can't you see what you're doing to me girl
You know I'll always hang around
Hang around
Hang around
Hang around
Can't you see what you're doing to me girl
You know I'll always hang around
You know I can't walk away
I just can't get out
Can't you see what you're doing to me girl
You know I'll always hang around
Hang around
Hang around
