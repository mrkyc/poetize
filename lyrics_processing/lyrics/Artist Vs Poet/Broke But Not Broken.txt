Like a mirror I stare into
Distorting my own views of how I see myself
So untraceable
To everybody else
Shattered pieces fell as I tell myself
That everything is alright
As I stand here left with nothing
I'm broke but I'm not broken
Like the mirror that's my review
Distorting my own views of how I see myself
It's not erasable
I'm miserable as hell
As the pages turn, I begin to learn
That I have every reason
To rescind myself
I'm broke but I'm not broken
Don't take this away 'cause I need it
And I can't let go of this feeling
And these walls, they fall in my tunnel
Slipping further, I can't fight it
You might also likeI sit outside of my front porch
And look at photographs from when
Things seemed simpler but I pushed away
So this is where I am
At a different place where I lost track
And everything's not alright
Still standing, left with nothing
I'm broke but I'm not broken
Don't take this away 'cause I need it
And I can't let go of this feeling
And these walls, they fall in my tunnel
Slipping further, I can't fight it
I'm holding on to what I know
Don't wanna change
I may be wrong
But after every word that's spoken
I'm broke but I'm not broken
Like a mirror I stare into
Distorting my own views of how I see myself
So untraceable
To everybody else
Shattered pieces fell as I tell myself
That everything is alright
As I stand here left with nothing
I'm broke but I'm not broken
Don't take this away 'cause I need it
And I can't let go of this feeling
And these walls, they fall in my tunnel
Slipping further, I can't fight it
Don't take this away 'cause I need it
And I can't let go of this feeling
And these walls, they fall in my tunnel
Slipping further, I can't fight it
I'm holding on to what I know
Don't wanna change
I may be wrong
But after every word that's spoken
I'm not broken, I'm not broken, I'm not broken
But after every word that's spoken
