This loneliness is wearing me down
I swear I had it all figured out
When she's kissing me I'm missing your mouth
Reminiscing on the love I had found
Cause she's got your eyes but they don't quite shine
Like the way yours always do
You've been trapped inside of this one track mind
Cause I lost it all in you
And when you finally rest your head tonight
Are you wishing I'm right by your side?

If I could break away
Could you say all the things you want to say?
Oh darling, could you wait for me?
Cause maybe you're the thing I need
And if I can follow through
You'll find me standing right in front of you
So tell me, could you wait for me?
Cause maybe you're that thing I need to save me

This loneliness will tear me apart
I'm wishing myself back to the start
Cause when I'm holding I feel your heart
And I hope it beats til it leads me back to where you are (yeah)
Cause he's just not you and he's just not me
Like two strangers in the dark
We've been trapped inside of a storyline
Where the pages lost their spark
You might also like
If I could break away
Could you say all the things you want to say?
Oh darling, could you wait for me?
Cause maybe you're that thing I need
And if I can follow through
You'll find me standing right in front of you
So tell me, could you wait for me?
Cause maybe you're that thing I need to save me

When you finally rest your head tonight
Are you wishing I'm right by your side?
Oh...

If I could break away
Could you say all the things you want to say?
Oh darling, could you wait for me?
Cause maybe you're that thing I need
And if I can follow through
You'll find me standing right in front of you
So tell me, could you wait for me?
