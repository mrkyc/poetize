You know I said it, I meant it
But you don't seem to notice at all
And I tried to prevent it
How can I stop what I can't control?
And we've been here before
And I feel that you can't take much more

And I try to put myself in your shoes
But I know that it won't be any use
When I say things'll only get better
Does it mean anything at all?
Yeah, oh

Wish I could take you away
From everything and erase the pain
You bit off more than you could chew
Didn't work out how you wanted it to
And I know it wasn't your fault
Just the hand that you were dealt with
'Cause your luck is turning to Hell
And it's made you into a skeptic
You still leave me breathless
You say I'll never get it
You might also like
And I try to put myself in your shoes
But I know that it won't be any use
When I say things'll only get better
Does it mean anything at all?

Your world is crumbling, but you tell me to smile
Your world is crumbling, but you tell me to smile
Your world is crumbling, but you tell me to smile
Your world is crumbling, but you tell me to smile
It doesn't make any sense at all
It's not fair and it feels so wrong

And I try to put myself in your shoes
But I know that it won't be any use
When I say things'll only get better
Does it mean anything at all? Yeah
And I try to put myself in your shoes
But I know that it won't be any use
When I say things'll only get better
Does it mean anything at all? Yeah
And I try to put myself in your shoes
But I know that it won't be any use
When I say things'll only get better
Does it mean anything at all?
