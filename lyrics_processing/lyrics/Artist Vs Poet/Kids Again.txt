I know a girl
Who likes to drink her coffee black
'Cause sugar knows she don't got time for that
Leaves her desires at the welcome mat
When she walks in

And I know a boy
Who likes to keep his burner on
He's always running with no one to keep warm
It's like he's flirting with the smoke alarm
His fire's fading

But still we laugh, we cry
We fall, we get high
Just like we were kids, just like we were kids
And when I'm feeling small you get me through it all
Just like we were kids, just like we were kids again

I know a girl
Who's never tried to settle down
She wears her loneliness just like a crown
But when she smiles all the kings will bow down, down, down
You might also like
And I know a boy
Who's broken every vow he's made
Who's spoken every cowards phrase
But he can listen like a rainy day
And drown it out

But still we laugh, we cry
We fall, we get high
Just like we were kids, just like we were kids
And when I'm feeling small you get me through it all
Just like we were kids, just like we were kids again
Just like we were kids, just like we were kids again

Just like we were kids
Just like we were kids
Just like we were kids again

And still we laugh, we cry
We fall, we get high
Just like we were kids, Just like we were kids
And when I'm feeling small you get me through it all
Just like we were kids, Just like we were kids
But still we laugh, we cry
We fall, we get high
Just like we were kids, just like we were kids
And when I'm feeling small you get me through it all
Just like we were kids, just like we were kids again
Just like we were kids, just like we were kids again
Just like we were kids, just like we were kids
Just like we were kids again
Just like we were kids, just like we were kids again
Just like we were kids, just like we were kids
