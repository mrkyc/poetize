The world is gonna end
Hey girl, can you save me?
Have you seen the news on the internet lately?
The whole world's gone crazy
And it's finally gonna burn us all down
I've been having revelations
Tune in to the New World station
And I think Mother Nature's lost her patience
And she's finally gonna run us all out
And when it goes down
I just wanna be standing somewhere close to you
Yeah
You and me, we're singing
Oooh Yeah (Oooh Yeah)
If the world is gonna end
Trust me, girl you know we
Sit on the front porch and swing all day
Watch the world as it melts away
Oooh Yeah
As long as I'm close to you
And I know it ain't pleasant
But I'm probably not getting into heaven
Girl, if you're next to me that's a blessing
'Cause I know we're gonna party in hell
So for now watch the light show
And wonder how much time we got left in this cycle
Life's a vicious cycle
Shit is psycho
