You got ninety-nine problems, I got eighty proof
Mixed in seven different drinks to forget about you
And that's what I'm gonna do
It only took six months and five whole weeks
I swear to god forty ounces never felt so free
So free of your memory

'Cause it's three strikes, you're out
In this two-player game
And girl, I think we're one in the same

If you could just drop your problems
At the bottom of this bottle
I would drink you all the time
I know it's hard to swallow
But it feels alright, yeah
But you'd rather be a bitch to me
So you keep your problems
I'll keep the whiskey

I've got a big hunch that you don't give a shit
And I've been kicking myself for not realizing it
But all that's over now
'Cause I got my good friends Jack and Jim
And they don't got a single problem with the way that I am
And they're dying to hear me out
You might also like
'Cause it's three strikes, you're out
In this two-player game
And girl, you know I've won either way

If you could just drop your problems
At the bottom of this bottle
I would drink you all the time
I know it's hard to swallow
But it feels alright, yeah
But you'd rather be a bitch to me
So you keep your problems
I'll keep the whiskey

You keep your problems
I'll keep the whiskey
You keep your problems
I'll keep the whiskey

If you could just drop your problems
At the bottom of this bottle
I would drink you all the time
I know it's hard to swallow
But it feels alright, yeah
Drop your problems
At the bottom of the bottle
I would drink you all the time
I know it's hard to swallow
But it feels alright, yeah
But you'd rather be a bitch to me
But you'd rather be a bitch to me
So you keep your problems
I'll keep the whiskey

So you keep your problems
