Just trying to make things right
My heart is heavy and my head is tired
So tired of being alone
So I sat and watched you go
You know you're making my heart go cold
A feeling I wished I had never known
But now I know
I never meant to hurt us
No, I was trying to make it right
Give me one more shot
I swear that I love you
'Cause you're all I'm not
And if you stay
I'll be there for you
When you're heart's feeling heavy
I'll be there for you
Forgive me if you're ready or not
Ready or not
I spent way too long last night
Trying to make things right
My heart is heavy but my head is tired
And I'm so tired of being alone
So I sat and watched you go
And now my heart's so cold
And it's a feeling I wished I had never known
You know I never meant to hurt us
No no, I tried to make it right
Give me one more shot
I swear that I love you
'Cause you're all I'm not
And if you stay
I'll be there for you
When you're heart's feeling heavy
I'll be there for you
Forgive me if you're ready or not
Ready or not
Oh you love, you love, you love, you love me baby
Oh you love, you love, you love, you love me baby, baby
And I will never leave your side
Even if it doesn't rhyme
I'll write you a song to make you feel beautiful
Oh and I will always be the one after all is said and done
I'll fix you when you come undone
Give me one more shot
I swear that I love you
'Cause you're all I'm not
And if you stay
I'll be there for you
When you're heart's feeling heavy
I'll be there for you
Forgive me, forgive me
I'll be there for you
When you're heart's feeling heavy
I'll be there for you
Forgive me if you're ready
