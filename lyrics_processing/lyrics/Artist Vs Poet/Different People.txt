My belief is in pieces
My sheets have grown cold
And I wish you could feel this
But you'll never know
'Cause you're perfectly perfect
And you're never alone
And you'll be blind 'til you find what I found
In you and me
'Cause we're two different people
I'm from Texas, you're from California
And I should've warned ya
And we aren't the same at all
You're strong, I like to fall for you
'Cause we are two different people

But I'll learn from my mistakes

And now I know what I've been waiting for
And now I know what I've been waiting for
And now I know what I've been waiting for
It's for another love that's nothing like yours
'Cause we're two different people (Ah)

I wrote a letter on Monday
To get some things off my chest
And it's full of these bitter words
Laying here on my desk
And it's haunting my bedroom
But I won't send it yet
'Cause I'm afraid that you'll find what I've found
In you and me
'Cause we're two different people
You're a Libra, I'm a Gemini
I'm honest, you like to lie
And we aren't the same, you see
I could tell you weren't in love with me
'Cause you and me are two different people

And I'll learn from my mistakes

And now I know what I've been waiting for
And now I know what I've been waiting for
And now I know what I've been waiting for
It's for another love that's nothing like yours
'Cause we're two different people
Yeah, oh
And I've gotta let you go, yeah
Oh, and I've gotta let you go
'Cause you're making me crazy
And I'm serious, baby, eh
I've gotta let you go
And I've gotta let you go, yeah

My belief is in pieces
And my sheets have grown cold
And you're the furthest from anything
That I'll ever call home

And now I know what I've been waiting for
And now I know what I've been waiting for
And now I know what I've been waiting for
It's for another love that's nothing like yours
