Given everything in the world
But a heartbreak
And she would throw a drink in my face
If she knew what I was tryin' to say
Here comes heartbreak
And you hate my favorite records and that's okay
Because I never really liked your friends, anyway
So throw a fit when I'm out too late
Cause there's a million little things
That I've been dying to say
But I can sum it up now
And then I'll get the hell out
It ain't breakin' news
Let's face the truth
That I was made for me
And you were made for you
You were a ten before I figured you out
The only reason I was stickin' around
But you're crazy
A girl you know you can't win em' all
If you could then God help us all
'Cause you're crazy, Oh, so crazy
You might also likeAnd you hate my favorite records and that's okay
Because I never really liked your friends, anyway
So throw a fit when I'm out too late
Cause there's a million little things
That I've been dying to say
But I can sum it up now
And then I'll get the hell out
It ain't breakin' news
Let's face the truth
That I was made for me
And you were made for you
And when you finally calm down
Maybe I'll see you around
And we can fake a few hellos to prove
That I was made for me
And you were made for you
But I can sum it up now
And then I'll get the hell out
It ain't breakin' news
Let's face the truth
That I was made for me
And you were made for you
And when you finally calm down
Maybe I'll see you around
And we can fake a few hellos to prove
That I was made for me
