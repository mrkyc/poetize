Hey there, baby, how you doin'? Where you been?
It's been so long since I have seen your silly grin
As you beamed from the sight of me, but then again
Those days are long and gone
I can still remember them like yesterday
It's hard to say how everything turned out this way
So many words, so many fingers point the blame
That led us down our separate roads

And after all the songs have had their sing
Did you know that you were playing just a game
With my heart? And now I can't feel anything
Worthy of the love we shared

Those days are good and gone, but I cannot forget
The simple softness of your touch, and then your kiss
We laughed aloud to every ex that we missed
As we floored it past the mountains and never looked back
Time had passed and you grew weary, I grew sick
From pains I'd felt when I begged you not to call it quits
My peace was small, and you stood firmly over it
So proud of what you've done
You might also like
And after all the songs have had their sing
Did you know that you were playing just a game
With my heart? And now I can't feel anything
Worthy of the love we shared

Ooh-oh
Is that what you call a getaway?
Tell me what you got away with
'Cause I've seen more spine in jellyfish
I've seen more guts in eleven-year-old kids
Have another drink and drive yourself home
I hope there's ice on all the roads
So you can think of me when you forget your seatbelt
And again when your head goes through the windshield
Bitch

And after all the songs have had their sing
Did you know that you were playing just a game
With my heart? And now I can't feel anything
Worthy of the love we shared
The love we shared

Never thought goodbye would come so very quick
But your wish is my command, command my wish
Should you ever change your mind, just please remember this
