She's an uptown drama queen
Always up on the latest talk
Whether it involves her or not, and
She's a train wreck, movie scene
In a box office flop
She never knows when to stop

And when you bat those eyes
To cover up your lies
I've been trying and trying to forget it all
Like a song I can't get out of my head
So you can just

Stay the hell away
Oh, 'cause you know I'm onto you
Stay the hell away
Oh, you know you gotta
You know you really gotta
Keep, keep your secrets
Keep, keep your secrets from me now
Keep your secrets
Keep, keep your secrets from me now
Keep your secrets
Keep, keep your secrets from me now
Keep your secrets
Keep, keep your secrets from
You might also like
And I know you, girl
Better than the back of my hand
And I swear I'm done covering your tracks
Don't want you coming back
Don't want you coming back

And when you bat those eyes
To cover up your lies
I've been trying and trying to forget it all
Like a song I can't get out of my head
So you can just

Stay the hell away
Oh, 'cause you know I'm onto you
Stay the hell away
Oh, you know you gotta
You know you really gotta
Keep, keep your secrets
Keep, keep your secrets from me now
Keep your secrets
Keep, keep your secrets from me now
Keep your secrets
Keep, keep your secrets from me now
Keep your secrets
Keep, keep your secrets from
Stay away, stay away
Stay away, stay away
Stay away, stay away
Stay the hell away
Stay the hell away
Oh, 'cause you know I'm onto you

Stay the hell away
Oh, you know you gotta
You know you really gotta
Keep, keep your secrets
Keep, keep your secrets from me now
Keep your secrets
Keep, keep your secrets from me now
Keep your secrets
Keep, keep your secrets from me now
Keep your secrets
Keep, keep your secrets from
