As for you, my my galvanized friend
You want a heart
You don't know how lucky you are not to have one
Hearts will never be practical until they can be made unbreakable

The rain was pouring down
I just embarrassed you
Told you I'd take care of you
Too much to drink
Your turned your attention
To someone I didn't know
And you thought I could take the blow
I can barely think

And I
Will find you in another life
One where we are never gonna fight
And I
Will find you in another life
Forget tears of sadness
I could save us from the madness

You woke up
You threw up
Oh, it never happened again
I spoke up
We grew up
Oh, we never have to still pretend
You might also like
(Unbreakable)
In and off
And we slept alone
A small space to be so cold
Rain dripping on both our souls
You turned your back on me baby
You swear you did it out of love
You swear you did it out of love

And through the fighting
With strain and bruises and tears we made it
This far with scars as big as our hearts
And now my heart can't take it
I swear I did it out of love
I swear I did it out of love

And I
Will find you in another life
One where we are never gonna fight
And I
Will find you in another life
Forget tears of sadness
I could save us from the madness
You woke up
You threw up
Oh, it never happened again
I spoke up
We grew up
Oh, we never have to still pretend

(You woke up)
(You threw up)
(Oh, it never happened again)
(I spoke up,)
(We grew up)
