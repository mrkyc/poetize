And it's a sign
The way your eyes reflect in mine
You know it gets me every time, can't you see?
We'll be just fine, you and me, if you just stay
And I'm blown away
By the way the hair moves past your face
As we keep shifting from the foot to the head
Shake the frame of this bed where we lay

And the only thing I want right now is for you to

Stay, stay, stay, stay with me now
Stay, stay, stay, stay with me
And you're my Cinderella
You know I can't forget ya
If you stay, stay, stay, stay with me now

We catch our breath
As we start to wonder what comes next
And I feel a rising in my chest when I see that smile
'Cause I know now, at least for a while
You're gonna stay, stay, stay
And here comes the sun
Shining through the blanket walls as we touch
Oh, you're all talk, and you've been teasing me enough
But that's alright, I'll call your bluff, you're gonna stay
You might also like
And the only thing I want right now is for you to

Stay, stay, stay, stay with me now
Stay, stay, stay, stay with me
And you're my Cinderella
You know I can't forget ya
If you stay, stay, stay, stay with me now

And I don't wanna leave this bed all day
And I'ma do all I can to make you stay
And I don't wanna leave this bed all day
This bed all day, this bed all day
And I don't wanna leave this bed all day
And I'ma do all I can to make you stay
And I don't wanna leave this bed all day
This bed all day, this bed all day

So why don't you just
Stay, stay, stay, stay with me now
Stay, stay, stay, stay with me
And you're my Cinderella
You know I can't forget ya
If you stay, stay, stay, stay with me now
Stay, stay, stay, stay with me now
Stay, stay, stay, stay with me
And you're my Cinderella
You know I can't forget ya
If you stay, stay, stay, stay with me now
So why don't you just
Stay, stay, stay, stay with me now
Stay, stay, stay, stay with me
And you're my Cinderella
You know I can't forget ya
