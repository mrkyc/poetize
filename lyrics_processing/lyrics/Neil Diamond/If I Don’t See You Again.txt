It was a hell of a ride
Don't need to say let's be friends
Don't need to promise you'll write
We rode that train through the night
And never cared where it went
If I don't see you again
If I don't see you again
We ran a whole other race
Two strangers meet on the road
And find a time and a place
We never once had to lie
We've passed the age of conscent
If I don't see you again
I know it's crazy out there
My head is sleeping around
I went out looking for love
And never liked what I found
Don't pay to make it alone
God knows it's lonely out there
I made it once on my own
And hardly anyone cared
If I don't see you again
You might also likeWho you gonna run to baby
Who you gonna hide behind when the nights
It's suddenly cold
Who's gonna hold you
Who's gonna love you
Who will you go to
Who you gonna call if it ain't me
When you're feeling lost
And there is nobody out there
Looking for you
What will you do
Where will you go
If I don't see you again
If I don't see you again
You made it happen somehow
I think I gave up on life
But I feel better right now
Something you see turn around
Don't need to know what you meant
If I don't see you again
And at the end of the day
I hated sleeping alone
There's nothing worse when you're lost
And you don't wanna go home
It's gonna work out some way
I just don't wanna be found
I'm waiting here round the bay
And I'll be hanging around
If I don't see you again
Who am I kidding
I'm going nowhere
I can't even get through
An hour without you
Should be ashamed
Just wanna hear you
Calling my name
Two of those missed conventions
These men must have somehow missed something more
Cause we're here alone
I know we're together
To fall apart
I know how to get back home
Each time we say that
Cause you're frustrated too long
You've been too lonely to know
To find that something is wrong
The time if perfect to go
Before the curtain descents
Right now when both of us know
That everything has got to end
If I don't see you again
What's it gonna come to baby
Who you gonna hide behind when the nights
Get filled up with dirt
Looking to run
You're running away
And when you came on to save me
Doesn't look like the future is clear
I need you to hear me
Praying to
But nobody hears me
I had a plan to the moon
Each time you're saying good bye
Cause if I stayed for too long
You get too lonely to work
To find that something was wrong
The time is perfect to go
Before the curtain descents
Right now when both of us know
Everything has got to end
If I don't see you again
If I don't see you again
Somehow we both made it through
I would have gave up on life
Before I gave up on you
You went and turned me around
Could be with something you said
I couldn't make out the sound
I didn't care what it meant
If I don't see you again
If I don't see you again
