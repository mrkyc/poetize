Yeah
Yeah, yeah
Sing
Sing
Sing
Sing
They try to tell me that I'm destined to lose
Dream on, you're better off just
Hitting the snooze boy
I'm up and at 'em
While you're taking the cruise
Blood, sweat and tears
Call it paying my dues
I'm one step ahead although
You're hardly a competitor
King of the hilltops, fight like a Federer
Me nerver quit for nothing and no reason
Think I'm a stop, yeh right, keep dreaming
Holly holy dream
Who I am, I am, what I believe in
Ain't no struggle can keep me from succeeding
Holly holy
Who I am, I am, what I believe in
Sing a song, sing it out, sing it strong
You might also likeNever forfeit a fold till I'm awarded the gold
And my gold is to achieve
Howerver rugged the road
I suppose you wanna know
How I muscled the load?
And exploded out the gat
Like I'm breaking a mould
My other only grows beneath the bright light
So you better be prepared
Hands up, round one, fight
And she comes
And, and I run just like the wind will
Holly holy
Listen
Since the Lord gave me wings
To soar above the traffic
The sound of victory helps
Lead me through the .... static
I miss the struggle
Had to hustle just to have it
I'm battle ready as I benefit my tactic
These shoes hurt to walk in
Failure ain't an option
Gots to keep it moving
Although my dogs is barking, yeah
Find me at the finish line
And it won't be long
And when I win it all
You can caught me sing my theme song
Sing, sing a song of songs
Sing it out, sing it strong
Call the sun in the dead of the night
And the sin gonna rise in the sky
Touch a man who can't walk upright
And that lame man, he gonna fly, gonna fly
Holly holy dream
Who I am, I am, what I believe in
Sing a song, sing it out, sing it strong, go
Dream a holy dream
Who I am, I am, what I believe in
Ain't no struggle
Can keep me from succeeding
Holly holy song
Who I am, I am, what I believe in
Sing a song, sing it out, sing it strong, go
Holly holy dream
Who I am, I am, what I believe in
Ain't no struggle
