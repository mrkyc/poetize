You holdin' that cash, you get robbed
Or get somebody dropped at your squad
Nothin' but shooters and stars in this squad

But we ain't trippin', we lettin' off shots
And they know

Got a hundred up in that TEC, so fuck nigga don't get wet
I say it's just us, it's just that, and bitch, I'ma roll for my set
So fuck nigga duck, or get wet or have Boss Top at your neck

Lots of bankrolls and hoes, I be bangin' bad hoes with my bros
We be some stars, that bitch know

We got hundreds in them TECs, make it rain, niggas don't get wet
