Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
Bang, bang, bang
Doh, doh doh doh
Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt
DP on the beat
Hundred for the ones and two hundred for my

I paid hundred for the ones
And two hundred for my gun
Paid a hundred for the drum
Just to go up in my gun
Paid fifty for some bullets
That's a box of bullets
Shoot 'em at your stomach
And shoot at your medulla
With my ruger
Smoking Tooka
In my bimmer
I'm a fooler
Pull up on ya
Pull up to ya
Switch cars
Then I fool ya
You might also like
Pull up in that 'Rari, hallelujah
Then I hop up in my Bimmer just to fool ya
Fool your bitch, I pull up in that fucking Hummer
Hummer H2, bitch, no, this ain't no scooter
It go faster than a Harley
Someone please pass me the damn Marley, ayy
Even though I don't smoke with nobody
I don't need no bodyguard I got my body
Got my nina
Got my Tommy (Got my Tommy)
Shoot this shit right up at your tummy (At your tummy, bang-bang)
Now you're looking like a zombie
Trying to get help but you couldn't find it (Buh-buh)
My Bimmer colored suu-whoop ravioli (Suu-whoop)
'Member when I used to eat ravioli (Woo, woo, bitch)
Now I can buy Kay Kay a little pony (Kay Kay, Kay)
Anything she want, you know I'm on it
That money, I be on it (Phew)
I ain't got no business sittin' on it (Hell nah)
I just got some business with gettin' money
You ain't talking money, that shit funny

I paid hundred for the ones
And two hundred for my gun
Paid a hundred for the drum
Just to go up in my gun
Paid fifty for some bullets
That's a box of bullets
Shoot 'em at your stomach
And shoot at your medulla
With my ruger
Smoking Tooka
In my bimmer
I'm a fooler
Pull up on ya
Pull up to ya
Switch cars
Then I fool ya
Somewhere coolin' in my mansion
Holding your bitch for ransom
How much you got to get her back, fam?
She ain't worth shit so I hope you got about 10
Boy, I heard your belt Versace
I got fifty times Versace in my pocket
Money be my logic
