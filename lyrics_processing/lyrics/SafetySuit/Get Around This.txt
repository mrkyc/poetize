You and I, we had it all
I wonder why, I let it fall
I don't know why I make this hard for you
And if I go, and get it back
Apologize for all I lack
Would you be there to take this heart?
Would you do anything at all?

Take me back to yesterday
I swear it on your life
I'll stay on the short side
I'll stay on the short side
Take me back to yesterday
If you can forgive me
I will, stay by you only
But if you can forget
We can get around this
Get around this, get around this, get around
We can get around this, get around this mess

Now you can go, you can leave
I wouldn't blame you for a thing
I acted like I never should
But I will stay, and I will bleed
Stand in the rain; I'm begging please
Cause I'll be here for you
Yeah, I'll be here for you
You might also like
Take me back to yesterday
I swear it on your life
I'll stay on the short side
I'll stay on the short side
Take me back to yesterday
If you can forgive me
I will, stay by you only
But if you can forget
We can get around this
Get around this, get around this, get around
We can get around this, get around this mess

So hold on, baby don't you leave me
Please just hold on to me

Take me back to yesterday
I swear it on your life
I'll stay on the short side
I'll stay on the short side
Take me back to yesterday
If you can forgive me
I will, stay by you only
But if you can forget
We can get around this
Get around this, get around this, get around
We can get around this, get around this mess
We can get around this
Get around this, get around this, get around
