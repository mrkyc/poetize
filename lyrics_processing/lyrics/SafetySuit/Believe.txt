If you don't believe in what you got
It's like you can't see that you're enough
Your dad hit you too many times
Now all you see are all the lies
You gotta believe in what you got
You gotta believe in what you got

If you gotta cry then let it out
If you gotta scream, let me hear you shout
Cause you gotta life you're letting go
So you got a past, but I don't know
You gotta believe in what you got
You gotta believe in what you got

Cause I need you
To stay here with me
To stay here with me
I don't want you to leave
Cause I need you
To stay here with me
To stay here with me
I don't want you to leave
You might also like
Now if you believe in what you got
Then maybe you'll see and maybe not
But don't be afraid and don't let go
Cause I'm gonna take this
And I'm gonna break this
And I'm gonna let you know because

I need you
To stay here with me
To stay here with me
I don't want you to leave
Cause I need you
To stay here with me
To stay here with me
I don't want you to leave

Cause I don't want to go away from you
As long as it may take, I'll find my way through
As long as it may take, I'll find my way to you
And you'll see you'll be fine

Cause I need you
To stay here with me
Cause I need you
I don't want you to leave
And I need you
To stay here with me
Cause I need you
I don't want you to leave
Even when you can't find a light there
Even when you just cry in your bed
Hold on, you're almost there
Hold on, you're almost there
Even when you get lost and you're scared
When you wanna give up, I don't care
Hold on, you're almost there
