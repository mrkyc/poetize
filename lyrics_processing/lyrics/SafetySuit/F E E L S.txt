"Why you want to be with me?" You said
"Why would you put up with all my crazy?
Say yes when I'm saying maybe?"
"It's got to be a crime," that's what you said
I'm gonna get myself arrested
For stealing your heart

That's when I said
"Well, you don't know how easy it is
To be in love, to be in love with you-ou-ou."

Cause you're the only one I've ever loved who feels about me the way I feel about you
The way I feel about you
And for all the laws that come with love
I'll break 'em all for you
Will you break 'em all for me?
I will break 'em all for you
You got me in my feels
Got me in my feels

"Where you want to go with me?" You said
We can go out and get some breakfast
I can tell you're feeling restless
But I don't have to ever leave this bed
I can stay in this room for hours
And talk to you till we pass out again
You might also like
You don't know how easy it is
To be in love, to be in love with you-ou-ou

You're the only one I've ever loved who feels about me the way I feel about you
The way I feel about you
And for all the laws that come with love
I'll break 'em all for you
Will you break them all for me?
I will break them all for you
You got me in my feels
Got me in my feels

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Cause you're the only one I've ever loved who feels about me the way I feel about you
The way I feel about you
And for all the laws that come with love
I'll break 'em all for you
Will you break them all for me?
I will break them all for you
You got me in my feels
Got me in my feels
