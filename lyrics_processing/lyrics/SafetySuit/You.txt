I feel like I lost my way
Feel like I'm standing here on my last leg
Like I'm losing you, you're losing your faith in me, yeah
And I just can't get out of my way
My mind's a prison that I can't escape
But you're the answer and you are the key, yeah

So now I'm sitting here waiting on my brain
To match what my heart's saying
You, you
Making my way down fourth street
Hope to God that we meet
You, you
Now I tried to find my way around it
But I feel so good about it
I feel so good about it
So now I'm sitting here waiting on my brain
To match what my heart's saying
You, you

I want this so badly I just need to, need to, need to, clear my head
Cause I'm feeling this and I'm feeling us and I'm feeling you
And I hope you trust but it all
It all comes down to it
I'm a little bit scared, I'm a little bit rusty
I'm a little bit hurt, I'm a little bit dusty

But I feel so good about it
I feel so good about it
So now I'm sitting here waiting on my brain
To match what my heart's saying
You, you

When I was young, when I was young
When I was young I hoped that I'd find what love was
When I was young, when I was young
When I was young I hoped that I'd find what love was
When I was young, when I was young
When I was young I hoped that I'd find what-
