I used to think I deserved everything in this world there could be
Then I met you and you brought me down it was like a disease
I loved you so much that I couldn't see what you were doing to me
And now im left alone with you
I should've known better 'cause

One time should've been enough for me, fine
I guess I couldn't see through your lies
You're making me believe but then you go and do it again
This time I don't wanna hear the one lie
And I don't really care that you're fine
You're making me believe but then you go and do it again

I never asked for much from you
I didn't need your stories
'Cause when you'd hold me like you do
I would forget you're lonely
And I don't need to know your thoughts
Don't need to know your questions too
'Cause when you hold me like you do, oh
I should've known better

'Cause one time should've been enough for me
Fine, I guess I couldn't see through your lies
You're making me believe but then you go and do it again
This time I don't wanna hear the one lie
And I don't really care that you're fine
You're making me believe but then you go and do it again
You might also like
Don't wanna come and ask for you
To come and love me like you should
You should've seen this coming for a long time, for a long time
Don't wanna come and ask for you
To come and love me like you should
You should've seen this coming for a long time, for a long time
I should've known better 'cause

One time should've been enought for me, fine
I guess I couldn't see through your lies
You're making me believe but then you go and do it again
This time I don't wanna hear the one lie
And I don't really care that you're fine
You should've known better than this
