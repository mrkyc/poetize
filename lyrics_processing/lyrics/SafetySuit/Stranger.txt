This song goes out to all the girls
Who had a boy who never let 'em in their world
You tried hard to make what your friendship was romance but still he
Never saw you as the one to hold his hand
He always chose the one you wish he wouldn't have
And now you're there cleaning up the mess she left, hopelessly thinkin'

If I say it like I wanted, would you ever believe me?
Say it like I wanted, would you ever just need me?
Say that I'm the only one and I'll never leave you but
I can't be the only one that you want to sing about
Would you say it?
Would you say it?
Tell me, would you say it?
Would you say it?
Tell me, would you?

This is a song about a love
I can't help to think what you're thinking of
I hope that you aren't thinking of us, like something you could never love
The last day, the last way you looked at me
The last word, the last thought you ever speak
I hope that you don't ever leave me, hopelessly thinkin'
You might also like
If I say it like I wanted, would you ever believe me?
Say it like I wanted, would you ever just need me?
Say that I'm the only one and I'll never leave you but
I can't be the only one that you want to sing about
Would you say it?
Would you say it?
Tell me, would you say it?
Would you say it?
I can't be the only one that you want to sing about

Oh woah oh
Oh woah oh
I can't be the only one that you are thinking of

Say it like I wanted, would you ever believe me?
Say it like I wanted, would you ever just need me?
Say that I'm the only one and I'll never leave you but
I can't be the only one that you want to sing about

Say it like I wanted, would you ever believe me?
Say it like I wanted, would you ever just need me?
Say that I'm the only one and I'll never leave you but
I can't be the only one that you want to sing about
Would you say it?
Would you say it?
Tell me, would you say it?
Would you say it?
Tell me, would you?
This is a song about a love
Can't help to think what you're thinkin' of
I hope that you don't ever leave
