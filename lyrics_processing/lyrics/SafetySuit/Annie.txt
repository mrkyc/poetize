There was a girl named Annie, she had a very pretty face
And not the way you would think so
Let me see if I can try to explain it
She had a smile that could light up the room and if she moved it'd be moving in you
But she wasn't like a magazine, she was just plain Jane
And her name was Annie

She never looked in the mirror, she never liked what she would see
And even if I tried to tell her, she never listened to a word I'd say
She always wanted what she never had, but never had what she needed so badly
Someone telling her she was fine and that's not right and it's why I'm saying

Annie, don't be shy here
Annie, don't just lie there
Looks don't make the world go round
But it comes around
Annie, don't be shy here
Annie, please don't cry here
I always have to stop myself
Cause you're beautiful

I didn't know if I could tell her
I didn't know if I could make her see
She didn't need to find her beauty
She didn't need to find a way to show me
They took her moments of feeling alive and made them moments of dying inside
She needed someone to scream her name, to take her pain and it's why I'm screaming
You might also like
Annie, don't be shy here
Annie, don't just lie there
Looks don't make the world go round
But it comes around
Annie, don't be shy here
Annie, please don't cry here
I always have to stop myself
Cause you're beautiful

And Annie, you are the one sight my eyes never tire of
It's like I cannot get enough of you
Annie, you are the one song left in my symphony
Like you were made for me

Annie, don't be shy here
Annie, don't just lie there
Looks don't make the world go round
But it comes around
Annie, don't be shy here
Annie, please don't cry here
I always have to stop myself
Cause you're beautiful
Annie, don't be shy here
Annie, don't just lie there
Looks don't make the world go round
But it comes around
Annie, don't be shy here
Annie, please don't cry here
I always have to stop myself
Have to stop myself
Have to stop myself

Cause you're beautiful
Cause you're beautiful
Cause you're beautiful
