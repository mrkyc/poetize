I don't know what happened
I guess you finally got me
Now you're off to somewhere
I don't know, kn-know, kn-know, know, kn-know
And I don't wanna make up
Cause I've already seen the light
Everybody fakes it
And everybody hurts sometimes

You go a long way getting your way
Sometimes
And everything is screaming

It's time we let go, let go, let go
I think it's time we let go, let go, let go
I'm gonna say no, say no, say no
I think it's time we let go, let go, let go
Let go, let go, let go
I think it's time we let go, let go, let go
Say no, say no, say no
I think it's time we let go, let go, let go

Now every time it happens
You make it for a day and...
Then you get to thinking
Oh no, n-no, no, no, n-no, n-no
But I don't wanna hear it
And I don't want a second call
Every lie is making me feel like...
You might also like
It's time to let go, let go, let go
I think it's time we let go, let go, let go
I'm gonna say no, say no, say no
I think it's time we let go, let go, let go
Let go, let go, let go
I think it's time we let go, let go, let go
I'm gonna say no, say no, say no
I think it's time we let go, let go, let go

You're always telling me to hold on
You're always telling me to hold on, hold on
I think it's time we let go, let go, let go
I think it's time we let go, let go

Let go, let go, let go
I think it's time we let go, let go, let go
I'm gonna say no, say no, say no
I think it's time we let go, let go, let go

I don't know what happened
