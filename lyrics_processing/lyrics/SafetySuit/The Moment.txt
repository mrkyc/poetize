From when I wake in the morning till I go and I fall asleep each night
I fight to hold onto a love that is inside
Because my past is like a nightmare that I never can escape
And I can't wait till I wake up so I can fall back asleep

And I don't understand what happened between you and me, but
You will probably end up with someone half as good as me, so
I don't care if you want to look in my eyes and say hello
You were blind to me, now I'm blind to you, no

So now I wait for a moment when I know that there is no one left to see
All the hurt that's inside me and the reason that I need
I need to let go of the things I see that have always let me fall
And I cannot find my way home, no, because I'm already home

And I don't understand what happened between you and me, but
You will probably end up with someone half as good as me, so
I don't care if you want to look in my eyes and say hello
You were blind to me, now I'm blind to you, no

Blind to me
Blind to you

And I don't know what you need
But I know you're listening now
And I don't care what you think
Because you didn't think to care about me
And I don't know what you need
But I know you're listening now
And I don't care what you think
Because you didn't think to care about me

And I don't understand what happened between you and me, but
You will probably end up with someone you know that is half as good, so
I don't care if you want to look in my eyes and say hello
You were blind to me, now I'm blind to you, no
You were blind to me
