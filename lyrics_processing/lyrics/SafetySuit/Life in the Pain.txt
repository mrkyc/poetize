Now you don't have a purpose
You don't let anybody in
You don't understand why she don't love you
But you don't understand yourself
Now you're out there with no target
So your friends become your aim
But there is no one left around you
So there is no one left to blame

And what you don't know, it won't hurt you
And what you don't know will save you from some pain
But if I could choose I'd let it hurt you
'Cause there's something bout life in the pain

Yeah there's something inside you starting
Like there's a fight coming your way
But there'll be no fists you'll be throwing
Just some words you got to say
And you'll scream for our repentance
Or you'll hide behind what's fake
But there ain't nothing to forgiveness
And you give as freely as you take
You might also like
And what you don't know, it won't hurt you
And what you don't know will save you from some pain
But if I could choose I'd let it hurt you
'Cause there's something 'bout life in the pain

And I don't need to know your stories
Don't need to understand your pain
'Cause I've been here since the beginning
And I'll be here the rest of the way
And I'll be here the rest of the way
Now you've tried your hand at running
But don't you try your hand at fate
'Cause there's a moment to be taken
But it's right before you break

And what you don't know, it won't hurt you
And what you don't know will save you from some pain
But if I could choose I'd let it hurt you
'Cause there's something about life in the pain
'Cause there's something about life in the pain
