Whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh
I wanna be with you
Whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh
I wanna be with you

It's all my fault today
I'm sorry for the way I was to you
It's all so wrong you see
And I'm sorry for the words I say to you

But if you ask me, I will go
Anything for you
But if you ask me, I will go
Cause baby I need you

Whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh
I wanna be with you
Whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh
I wanna see what you see
See what you see in me

Am I on my own today?
All alone with nothing left to say
Can it all go back the way it used to be when you were here with me?

Anything for you
But if you ask me, I will go

Whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh
I wanna be with you
Whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh
I wanna see what you see
See what you see in me
Whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh
I want you to notice me
Cause I'm already lonely
And I don't know what to do

You say, I can't be honest with you
You say, I can't be honest, well what now

Whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh
I wanna be with you
Whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh
I wanna see what you see
Wanna see what you see in me
Whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh
I want you to notice me
Cause I'm already lonely
And I don't know what to do
I don't know what to do baby
I don't know what to do
I don't know what to do baby
