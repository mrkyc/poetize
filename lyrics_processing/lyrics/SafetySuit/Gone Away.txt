I think about life, and oh how it changes so fast
And oh how it's so hard to last here waiting for something to give
I think about time, a luxury so hard to find
And I just can't figure out why I wasted it all here without you

But I'll be fine, oh don't you worry
Cause I'll be fine, see I'm in a hurry to be

Gone away awhile
Tell me all the things that I
I'll be missing here in this old life, man cause I just don't know

I think about you, and all of the times that we shared
And oh what a wonderful pair we made it so far, here we go again
I think about love, and oh what a beautiful song
And oh how it needs to be sung here, sing it so loud all the world can hear

I think I'll be gone away awhile
Tell me all the things that I
I'll be missing here in this old life, man cause I just don't know
I think I'll be gone away awhile
Tell me all the things that I
I'll be missing here in this old life, man cause I just don't know, know, know
I just don't know
I just don't know

But I'll be fine, oh don't you worry
Cause I'll be fine, see I'm in no hurry
No I'll be fine, oh don't you worry
Cause I'll be fine, see I'm in a hurry to be

Gone away awhile
Tell me all the things that I
I'll be missing here in this old life, man cause I just don't know, know
I think I'll be gone away awhile
Tell me all the things that I
I'll be missing here in this old life, man cause I just don't know, know
I just don't know

Gone away awhile
Tell me all the things that I
