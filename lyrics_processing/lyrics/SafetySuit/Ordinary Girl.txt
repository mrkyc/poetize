Is love something to believe in?
Or just something that we read and believe when we're younger?
Feels like we're playing a fool's game

I think I'm going the other way
Spend my days with friends and nights alone it's all I need
Cause love's an illusion
I've made my resolution
But now there's confusion, cause I

Cause then I see you there
You're like an ordinary girl
With something I can't explain, with something I can't explain
I cannot break my stare
You're like a necessary drug
And I'm feeling you in my veins, I'm feeling you in my veins

Can love happen in a moment?
And be everything you wanted?
Can it feel real?
This can't really be us meeting for the first time
You might also like
I think something is happening
Losing feeling in my hands, I'm numb and can barely speak
Cause love's an illusion
I've made my resolution
But now there's confusion, cause I

Cause then I see you there
You're like an ordinary girl
With something I can't explain, with something I can't explain
I cannot break my stare
You're like a necessary drug
And I'm feeling you in my veins, I'm feeling you in my veins

Over and over, love let me down
Over and over
Baby give me one more try and just for a minute
One more day, help me stay in it like
Over and over, love let me down
Over and over, baby give me
One more try and just for a minute
One more day, help me stay in it like

But then I see you there
You're like an ordinary girl
With something I can't explain, with something I can't explain
I cannot break my stare
You're like a necessary drug
So I think I'm gonna meet you right now
Cause then I see you there
You're like an ordinary girl
With something I can't explain, with something I can't explain
I cannot break my stare
You're like a necessary drug
And I'm feeling you in my veins, I'm feeling you in my veins

Over and over, love let me down
Over and over
Baby give me one more try and just for a minute
One more day, help me stay in it like
Over and over, love let me down
Over and over, baby give me
One more try and just for a minute
