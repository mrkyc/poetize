Walking out the door this morning wondering what it is that's going on with you, on with you
Thinking of a way to say I'm sorry for something that I'm not sure I'd do, sure I'd do

So come on baby let me in and show me what this really is cause

Something must have made you say that
What did I do to make you say that to me?
Something must have made you so mad
What can I do to make you say, "come back to me"?

Hoping for a moment that I turn around and you'll be coming after me, after me
Cause all that I can say is that it's obvious, it's obvious you're all I see, all I see

So come on baby let me in and show me what this really is about
Cause I can't read you
Come on baby let me in and show me what this really is cause

Something must have made you say that
What did I do to make you say that to me?
Something must have made you so mad
What can I do to make you say, "come back to me"?
Come back to me

And I'll be here in the morning if you say "stay", if you say "stay" to me, oh
And I'll be here in the morning if you say "stay", if you say "stay" to me, oh oh
And I'll be here in the morning if you say "stay", if you say "stay" to me, oh

Something must have made you say that
What did I do to make you say that to me?
Something must have made you so mad
What can I do to make you say, "come back to me"?
Something must have made you say that
What did I do to make you say that to me?
Something must have made you so mad
