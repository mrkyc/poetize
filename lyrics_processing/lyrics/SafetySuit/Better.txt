I can't believe it's been 10 years since you took my name
It's been 15 since I saw your face
And every day since seems just like a dream
See I'm still feeling you like I did when we're 17
Some people grow up and grow apart
But you and me grew up and you kept my heart
So I'm gonna love you
Till it all goes dark
Until it all goes dark
Until it all goes...

Now time don't stop for no one
But for you it seems to slow down
I don't know how you do it like you do, yeah

I'm getting slow in my old age
And I'm starting to forget things
But baby girl you keep getting better
And now I'm thinking how we started
How you were everything I ever wanted
But baby girl you keep getting better

It's in the way you look
It's in the way you move
It's in the way your laugh can light up any room
It's that my heart don't beat until you're next to me
And you know I can't sleep until I feel you breathing
You might also like
And now the years don't lie
Even though we try to
But then the mirror comes and makes us tell the truth
If this is aging, you're amazing
Baby tell me what's your secret, I can keep it

I'm getting slow in my old age
And I'm starting to forget things
But baby girl you keep getting better
And now I'm thinking how we started
How you were everything I ever wanted
But baby girl you keep getting better

(I can't figure it out, don't wanna)
(I can't figure it out, don't wanna)
(I can't figure it out, don't wanna)
(I can't figure it out, don't wanna)
(I can't figure it out, don't wanna)

Now time don't stop for no one
But for you it seems to slow down
I don't know how you do it like you do, yeah
Time don't stop for no one
But for you it seems to slow down
So let me share what's left of it with you, yeah
I'm getting slow in my old age
And I'm starting to forget things
But baby girl you keep getting better
And now I'm thinking how we started
How you were everything I ever wanted
But baby girl you keep getting better

(I can't figure it out, don't wanna)
(I can't believe it's been 10 years since you took my name)
(I can't figure it out, don't wanna)
(It's been 15 since I saw your face)
(And every day since seems just like a dream)
(I can't figure it out, don't wanna)
(See I'm still feeling you like I did when we're 17)
(I can't figure it out, don't wanna)
(Some people grow up and grow apart)
(I can't figure it out, don't wanna)
(But you and me grew up)
(I can't figure it out, don't wanna)
(And you kept my heart)
(So I'm gonna love you)
(I can't figure it out, don't wanna)
(Till it all goes dark)
(Till it all goes dark)
(I can't figure it out, don't wanna)
(I can't figure it out, don't wanna)
