Hold on
What's the rush, what's the rush?
We're not done, are we?
'Cause I don't need to change this
Atmosphere we've made of
You can stay one more hour
Can you stay one more hour?

You know I'm gonna find a way
To let you have your way with me
You know I'm gonna find the time
To catch your hand and make you stay

Hold on, I will be here
When it's all done, you know
'Cause what's the point in chasing
If I can't enjoy your face and
We can't be wrong tonight?
Can we be wrong tonight?

You know I'm gonna find a way
To let you have your way with me
You know I'm gonna find the time
To catch your hand and make you stay
I don't care what clothes you wear
It's time to love and I don't care
You know I'm gonna find a way
To let you have your way with me
You might also like
And if I was running
You'd be the one who I would be running to
And if I was crying
You would be lining the cloud that would pull me through
And if I was scared
Then I would be glad to tell you and walk away
But I am not lying
I am just trying to find my way in to you

You know I'm gonna find a way
To let you have your way with me
You know I'm gonna find the time
To catch your hand and make you stay
I don't care what clothes you wear
It's time to love and I don't care
You know I'm gonna find a way
To let you have your way with me

You know I'm gonna find a way
To let you have your way with me
You know I'm gonna find the time
To catch your hand and make you stay
I don't care what clothes you wear
It's time to love and I don't care
You know I'm gonna find a way
To let you have your way with me
And if I was running
And if I was crying
And if I was scared
You know I'm gonna find a way
