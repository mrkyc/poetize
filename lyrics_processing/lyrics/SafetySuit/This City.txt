This, th-this city
This, th-this city
This, th-this city
This, this this th-this city

I'm rolling out of my bed
Call up a couple of friends
Don't got a lot of coin in our pockets but we got enough love to be fed
And maybe one of the kings
Maybe someone between
But most days we just living like a ghost somebody that nobody can see

But tonight, this city is ours
This, th-this city is ours
We're not famous, we're not stars
This, th-this city is ours
Tonight we're gonna get in my car and that's just the start
We're not famous, we're not stars
But this city, city is ours
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

So now we take to the streets
We're gonna see who we meet
I can feel it in the air there's somebody to be
And that somebody is me
And maybe we should all go out and kiss a stranger
Flirt with some danger
Maybe we should break some rules of good behavior
Save that for later

But tonight, this city is ours
This, th-this city is ours
We're not famous, we're not stars
This, th-this city is ours
Tonight we're gonna get in my car and that's just the start
We're not famous, we're not stars
But this city, city is ours
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

We can go where we want to
Nobody gonna tell us no
We can go where we want to
Nobody, no-no-no-nobody-body
We can go where we want to
Nobody gonna tell us no
We can go where we want to
Nobody, no-no-no-nobody-body
Tonight, this city is ours
This, this city is ours
We're not famous, we're not stars

But tonight we're gonna get in my car and that's just the start

But this city, city is ours
