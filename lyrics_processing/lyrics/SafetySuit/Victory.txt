We said it, we said it, we said it, we said it
We said it, we said it, we said it, we said it

Don't look now
We made it
And I don't know how
But I don't really want to
They tried to drag us down
We made it
Anyway, somehow

They never thought that we would make it this far
They never thought we would be more than our scars

That's why this victory is so sweet
They never thought that we would make it this far
They never thought we would be more than our scars
That's why this victory is so sweet

Don't look down
We made it
And any higher now, we will be sitting in the hall of fame
So go and thank the crowd: they did it
This is our final bow, oh-woo
You might also like
They never thought that we would make it this far
They never thought we would be more than our scars

That's why this victory is so sweet
They never thought that we would make it this far
They never thought we would be more than our scars
That's why this victory is so sweet

We said it, we said it, we said it, we said it
We said it, we said it, we said it, we said it

We said it, we said it, we said it, we said it
We said it, we said it, we said it, we said it
We said it, we said it, we said it, we said it
We said it, we said it
We said we'll take on the world
We'll make 'em believe, and then we'll leave and be on our way
We said we'll take on the world
We'll make 'em believe, and then we'll leave and be on our way
We will be on our way

They never thought that we would make it this far
They never thought we would be more than our scars
That's why this victory is so sweet
They never thought that we would make it this far
They never thought we would be more than our scars
That's why this victory is so sweet

Victory is sweet
We said it, we said it, we said it, we said it
We said it, we said it, we said it, we said it
