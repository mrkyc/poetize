I sat by the phone today
Waiting for you to call so I could pick it up and say hello to you
And you would say hello to me
(Just like my dreams)
Is there a reason why you're gone? I didn't mean to be so wrong
I tried so hard to be the best that I could be, but still it seems I always end up alone

Is there something inside me that I don't see?
Is there something wrong here with the way I love?

Down, you can't hold me down
Cause when no one is around I won't be standing here
Just waiting for you to come back home again
Down, you can't hold me down
Because I finally understand that what you did is not so bad
In fact, it's better for me

Did I not give you enough room?
Was I overtaking you?
And did my love for you just blind me from what I was doing wrong?
I never meant you harm
Or was I not good enough for you?
Is that the reason why we're through?
Was I not half the man you thought that I would be but now you see?
Is that why you leave me?
Is that why you leave me?

Down, you can't hold me down
Cause when no one is around I won't be standing here
Just waiting for you to come back home again
Down, you can't hold me down
Because I finally understand that what you did is not so bad
In fact, it's better for me

And Lord knows I try to bring back my dreams
Cause I held onto yours for so long that I couldn't hold my own

Down, you can't hold me down
Cause when no one is around I won't be standing here
Just waiting for you to come back home again
Down, you can't hold me down
Because I finally understand that what you did is not so bad
In fact, it's better for me

Down
Down
You can't hold me down again
You can't hold me down
Down
