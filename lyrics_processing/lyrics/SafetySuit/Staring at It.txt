Tonight I am fighting for love again
My heart in your hand is my heart on the floor
And I know that you think that we can still be just friends
But if I can be honest, for a moment
I know that we're breaking
But if you can just take it

We're so, so close
We're staring at it
We're staring at it
We're staring at it
Please don't go
We'll get it back
Just let it pass
We can make it happen
I don't know where you're at, but when you see an exit
You'll be headed at it
I won't go
I'm staring at it
I'm staring at the only love I know

Search for a war and you won't find peace
But I think that you think that they're one in the same
Love can't be open if past cannot be erased
So if I can't be honest, for a moment
I know that we're breaking
But if you can just take it
You might also like
We're so, so close
We're staring at it
We're staring at it
We're staring at it
Please don't go
We'll get it back
Just let it pass
We can make it happen
I don't know where you're at, but when you see an exit
You'll be headed at it
I won't go
I'm staring at it
I'm staring at the only love I know

I can't believe this
Oh no, you're actually leavin
I think that somewhere I'm bleeding
It's so close, so close, we are

We are
Please don't go
We'll get it back
Just let it pass
We can make it happen
I don't know where you're at, but when you see an exit
You'll be headed at it
I won't go
I'm staring at it
I'm staring at the only love
We're so, so close
We're staring at it
We're staring at it
We're staring at it
Please don't go
We'll get it back
Just let it pass
We can make it happen
I don't know where you're at, but when you see an exit
You'll be headed at it
I won't go
I'm staring at it
I'm staring at the only love I know

The only love I know
The only love I know
Yeah
Yeah
I'm staring at it
I'm staring at
