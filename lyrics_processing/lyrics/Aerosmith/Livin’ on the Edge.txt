There's something wrong with the world today
I don't know what it is
Something's wrong with our eyes
We're seeing things in a different way
And God knows it ain't His
It sure ain't no surprise, yeah

We're livin' on the edge
Livin' on the edge
Livin' on the edge
Livin' on the edge

There's something wrong with the world today
The light bulb's getting dim
There's meltdown in the sky (ahh)
If you can judge a wise man
By the color of his skin
Then mister, you're a better man than I

We're livin' on the edge
(You can't help yourself from falling) (Everybody, everybody)
Livin' on the edge
(You can't help yourself at all) (Everybody, everybody)
Livin' on the edge
(You can't stop yourself from falling) (Everybody, everybody)
Livin' on the edge
(Everybody, everybody)
