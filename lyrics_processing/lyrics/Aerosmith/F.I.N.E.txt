Hot wax drippin', honey, what do you say?
I got a brand new record that I've got to play
She says, "Not now, boy", but I did anyway
'Cause I'm ready, so ready
Lip-smackin', paddy-wackin', walkin' the street
I got a ragtop Chevy, now I'm back on my feet
I get an EMHO woody when I sit in the seat
'Cause I'm ready, so ready, yeah

I got a girlfriend with the hoochy-coochy eyes
'Cause in the pink she look so fine
She's got the Cracker Jack, now all I want's the prize, honey
Heh-heh-heh!
I know these hookers down on 42nd street
But, uh, ill-gotten booty's not my style
I'll take a rain check 'til I get back on my feet, honey
Heh-heh, yeah!

'Cause I'm alright
Your daddy says I'm alright
Mmm, your momma says, alright
And my old lady says I'm alright
See Aerosmith LiveGet tickets as low as $31You might also like
Whipcrackin' floozy, way out of control
She's got a new kind of jelly in her jelly roll
I got the right key, baby, but the wrong keyhole
And I'm ready, so ready
I'm a red, hot pistol and I'm ready to fight
I'm a .38 special on a Saturday night
I'm gonna kiss your boo-boo, honey, make it alright
'Cause I'm ready, so ready, whoo!

I got a cruiser with a bimbo on the dash
It kinda keeps my ass in line
One little french kiss, honey, that's my kinda trash
Yeah!
My brand new baby's lookin' F-I-N-E, fine
The sun is shinin' every day
Ain't got no rubbers, now it's rainin' all the time, honey
Ooh!

'Cause it's alright
My little sister says I'm alright
Ooh, my brother thinks I'm alright
And my old lady knows I'm alright
I feel like I'm hung up on the line
I'd die for you, but we were partners in the crime
Everything about you is so F-I-N-E, fine
Let's put our clothes back on
And, by the way, girl, what's your name again? Uh-huh!
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
Ow! G-G-G-G-G-Gow!

'Cause it's alright
Ooh, your daddy says I'm alright
And Tipper thinks I'm alright
And Joe Perry says I'm alright

Pitched my tent in the pouring rain
I got a back seat lover that's callin' my name
She's gonna blow my cover, she's hot as a flame
But I'm ready, so ready, ow!
I shove my tongue right between your cheeks
I haven't made love now for twenty-five weeks
I hear that you're so tight, your lovin' squeaks
And I'm ready, so ready
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh, hoo-hoo!
(If I could, I surely would)
