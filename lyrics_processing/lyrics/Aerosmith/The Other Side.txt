Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm
Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm-mm-mm (Yeah!)

Lovin' you has go to be (Take me to the other side)
Like the devil and the deep blue sea (Take me to the other side)
Forget about your foolish pride (Take me to the other side)
Oh, take me to the other side (Take me to the other side)

My mama told me there'd be days like this
And, man, she wasn't foolin'
'Cause I just can't believe the way you kiss
Uh, uh-huh
You opened up your mouth with baited breath
You said you'd never leave me
You love me, you hate me, I tried to take the loss
You're crying me a river, but I got to get across

Lovin' you has go to be (Take me to the other side)
Like the devil and the deep blue sea (Take me to the other side)
Forget about your foolish pride (Take me to the other side)
Oh, honey, take me to the other side (Take me to the other side)

I'm looking for another kind of love
Oh, Lordy, how I need it
The kind that likes to leap without a shove
Oh, honey, best believe it
To save a lot of time and foolish pride
I'll say what's on my mind, girl
You love me, you hate me, you cut me down to size
You blinded me with love and, yeah, it opened up my eyes

Lovin' you has go to be (Take me to the other side)
Like the devil and the deep blue sea (Take me to the other side)
My conscience got to be my guide (Take me to the other side)
Oh, honey, take me, take, take, take, take, take, yeah! (Take me to the other side)

Now, I ain't one for saying long goodbyes
I hope all is forgiven
You love me, you hate me, I used to be your lover
You know you had it coming, girl, so take me to the other
