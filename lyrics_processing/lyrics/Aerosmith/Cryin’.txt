There was a time
When I was so broken-hearted
Luck wasn't much of a friend of mine
The tables have turned, yeah
'Cause me and them ways have parted
That kind of love was the killin' kind

So listen
All I want is someone I can't resist
I know all I need to know by the way that I got kissed

I was cryin' when I met you
Now I'm tryin' to forget you
Love is sweet misery
I was cryin' just to get you
Now I'm dyin' 'cause I let you
Do what you do down on me, yeah!

Now there's not even breathing room
Between pleasure and pain
Yeah, you cry when we're making love
Must be one and the same

Yeah, I got to tell you one thing
That's been on my mind, girl, I gotta say
We're partners in crime
You got that certain somethin'
What you give to me takes my breath away

Now the word out on the street
Is the devil's in your kiss
If our love goes up in flames
It's a fire I can't resist

I was cryin' when I met you
Now I'm tryin' to forget you
Your love is sweet misery
I was cryin' just to get you
Now I'm dyin' 'cause I let you
Do what you do to me, yeah!


'Cause what you got inside
Ain't where your love should stay
Yeah, our love, sweet love, ain't love
'Til you give your heart away
I was cryin' when I met you
Now I'm tryin' to forget you
Your love is sweet misery
I was cryin' just to get you
Now I'm dyin' to let you
Do what you do, what you do down to
No, no, baby, baby, baby


I was cryin' when I met you
Now I'm tryin' to forget you
Your love is sweet misery
I was cryin' when I met you
Now I'm dyin' 'cause I let you
Do what you do down to
(Down to, baby, down to, down to)

I was cryin' when I met you
Now I'm dyin' to forget you
Your love is sweet misery
I was cryin' when I met you
