I've seen faces I may never see again
I've been places I never could have dreamt
I've touched hands with those who've touched me
Seen the marks, the skeleton keys
I found peace in a foreign atonement
I lost myself in a tides of a moment
But nothing compares

Don't want to be here
Don't want to be here without you
I need to know you
I need to know you believe in me

What's it worth if what it's worth alone?
(Somebody tell me now)
And what's the point if all the points lead home?
(Somebody show me how)
I've loved where I've been
Yes I love where I've been
But my heart's where I'm going

Don't want to be here
Don't want to be here without you
(I don't want to go it alone)
(I don't want to go it alone)
I need to know you
I need to know you believe in me
(I don't want to go it alone)
(I don't want to go it alone)

I lost myself in a tides of a moment
But my heart's where I'm going

Don't want to be here
Don't want to be here without you
(I don't want to go it alone)
(I don't want to go it alone)
I need to know you
I need to know you believe in me
(I don't want to go it alone)
(I don't want to go it alone)

'Cause I don't want to go alone
I don't want to do this all on my own
(I don't want to go alone)
(I don't want to go alone)
We can ride into the sun
Together we can take it, we're right with you inside
(I don't want to go alone)
