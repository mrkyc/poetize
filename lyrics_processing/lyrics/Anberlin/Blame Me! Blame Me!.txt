And we could ride all night
To the pace of the blinking lights
Wishing traffic was faster
(Traffic was faster)
Keeping safe distance
But courting disaster
We could dance all night
To the sounds of a starting fight
Hoping change would come round
(Change would come round)
Amazing division, how sweet the sound

Blame me! Blame me! Blame me!
For mistakes you've made but you can't own
Hate me! Hate me! Hate me!
For every honest word that you've postponed
Leave me out of this
Life's a sinking ship
So blame me! Blame me! Blame me!
For mistakes you've made but you can't own

And we could stare all day
At problems that won't go away
Silence is pounding
(Silence is pounding)
You're wearing me down
These corners there rounding
We could scream all night
With no resolve still left in sight
Stop saying you're sorry
(Saying you're sorry)
All of these words feel so very empty

Blame me! Blame me! Blame me!
For mistakes you've made but you can't own
Hate me! Hate me! Hate me!
For every honest word that you've postponed
Leave me out of this
Life's a sinking ship
So blame me! Blame me! Blame me!
For mistakes you've made but you can't own

Torturing ourselves
Must be into the abuse
If you're the rope that ties us together
Then please make me a noose
Ask me to leave
Then beg me just to stay
Used to run to my arms but now I pull them away
Come and go as you please
I'm like a part time lover with well worn knees
Well, come on

Blame me! Blame me! Blame me!
For mistakes you've made but you can't own
Hate me! Hate me! Hate me!
For every honest word that you've postponed
Leave me out of this
Life's a sinking ship
So blame me! Blame me! Blame me!
