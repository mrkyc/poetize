Do you memorize theatrical lines
That seem to lead them in?
Play the role with a good-girl heart
Hide the tangled webs within
Who was it that led you on
And makes you want to hurt me so?
Who do you want to forget?
Who forgot you long ago?

Do you still feel him
Calling in the air tonight?
Do you still feel it?
Seems like you've done this before

You make breaking hearts look so easy
Seems like you've done this before
You've got breaking hearts all but down
Have you done this, you've done this before
You make stealing hearts look so easy
Where is the girl I adore?
You've got breaking up all but down
And I can't love a thief anymore

Do you collect the souls you've lost
In the top of your dresser drawer?
Count the number of tears displaced
On lonely bedroom floors?
A machine where your heart once was
Slowly takes the place of you
Only hold the memories now
Of a love I thought I knew

Do you still feel him
Calling in the air tonight?
Do you still feel it?
Seems like you've done this before

You make breaking hearts look so easy
Seems like you've done this before
You've got breaking hearts all but down
Have you done this, you've done this before
You make stealing hearts look so easy
Where is the girl I adore?
You've got breaking up all but down
And I can't love a thief anymore
You make breaking hearts look so easy
You've got breaking hearts all but down
You make breaking hearts look so easy
Seems like you've done this before
You've got breaking hearts all but down
Have you done this, you've done this before
The best you could hope to be
Is now just a bittersweet memory
