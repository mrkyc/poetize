Dear little girl, so much hurt
For such a young age
Trapped inside a pretty little lie
Your body's betrayed

Don't fix your eyes on a fix you'll rely on
Fixed her eyes on a fix she relies upon
Stand unafraid
All the good souls, stand unafraid

When the light starts to burn, and the pain returns
I just wish that I could heal the hurt you feel tonight
There's life in your veins
These needles are chains to hold you down
How can you expect to win this war?
You're too afraid to fight
Are you too afraid to fight?

Dear little one, that was so much pain
Time you can't replace
Trapped inside, too afraid to cry, and now
Hands and bruises cover face

When the light starts to burn, and the pain returns
I just wish that I could heal the hurt you feel tonight
There's life in your veins
These needles are chains to hold you down
How can you expect to win this war
If you're too afraid to fight?

Stand unafraid
All the good souls (All the good souls)
Stand unafraid
All of the good souls
Stand unafraid

I just wish that I could heal the hurt you feel tonight

These needles are chains to hold you down
How can you expect to win this war
