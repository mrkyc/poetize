I found myself lookin' into the mirror
Knew I wasn't who I wanted to be
I was living life the way that I wanted
But my eyes reminded me I'm not free

Believed a lie so everything that I know
Says I gotta go, tired of going solo
But I'm never gonna go there again

This is what it is, this is who I am
This is where I finally take my stand
I didn't wanna fall, but I don't have to crawl
I met the one with two scarred hands
Givin' Him the best of everything that's left of
The life inside this man
I've been born again

I see you're walkin' like you're living in fear
Havin' trouble even looking at me
Wishin' they would give you more than words
Sick of people tellin' how it should be (How it should be)

We are the ones they call by name
I'm never gonna look back
Let go, let go, the guilt, the shame
Said, I'm never gonna look back
This is who I am

This is what it is, this is who I am
This is where I finally take my stand
I didn't wanna fall, but I don't have to crawl

(Never gonna look back)
I've been born again
