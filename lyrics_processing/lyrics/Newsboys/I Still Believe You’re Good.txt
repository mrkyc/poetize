It's easy to say You're good
When I know that things are good
And right now, I know I should
But I'm fighting for my life
My heart's in a desperate place
I feel like a castaway
I'm drifting between the waves

But You've always turned my broken into whole
Turned my hopeless into hope
God, no matter where I go, You lead

Even in the valley, I still believe
You're good, You're good
Even when I can't see, I still believe
You're good, You're so good
You keep every promise, every word is true
There's beauty from the ashes in everything You do
Even in the valley, I still believe
You're good

I'm finding a peace that's real
No matter the way I feel
One way or another, You heal (Dat-dat da-dat da-da)
