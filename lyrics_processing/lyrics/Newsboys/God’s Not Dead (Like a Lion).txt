Let love explode and bring the dead to life
A love so bold to see a revolution somehow

Let love explode and bring the dead to life
A love so bold to bring a revolution somehow

Now I'm lost in Your freedom
And this world I'll overcome

My God's not dead, He's surely alive
He's livin' on the inside, roarin' like a lion
God's not dead, He's surely alive
He's livin' on the inside, roarin' like a lion

He's roarin', He's roarin'
He's roarin' like a lion
