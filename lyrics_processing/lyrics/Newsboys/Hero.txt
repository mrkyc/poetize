I... I want to follow like a shadow
I don't need no one to see me
I just want to chase you down
I... I want to travel like an echo
I don't need no one to hear me
I just to make you loud

I'm about one name, one life, one story
I'm alive to bring You glory
You took my pain
And You paid the debt I owed
I'm gonna lay me down to lift You up
You're the only King in the kingdom come
If I live, if I die, my life will show
You're my hero, hero (Oh...)
You're my hero, hero (Oh...)

Light shattering the darkness
Taking up a cross, You reached beyond my brokenness
Love overturning all the heartache
Taking on a grave and leaving death powerless, powerless

I'm about one name, one life, one story
I'm alive to bring You glory
You took my pain
And You paid the debt I owed
I'm gonna lay me down to lift You up
You're the only King in the kingdom come
If I live, if I die, my life will show
You're my hero, hero (Oh...)
You're my hero, hero (Oh...)

You took the nails (I'm forgiven)
Cleared my name (Every sin is)
Washed away (It is finished)
You're the reason I'm free

I'm about one name, one life, one story
I'm alive to bring You glory
You took my pain
And You paid the debt I owed
I'm gonna lay me down to lift You up
You're the only King in the kingdom come
If I live, if I die, my life will show
You're my hero, hero (Oh...)
Jesus, Jesus
You're my hero, hero (Oh...)
Jesus, Jesus

You are who You say You are
The evidence is in my heart
You are who You say You are
