Empty hearts are fillin' up
Wicked ways are comin' undone
Every eye is lookin' out for You
City lights are burnin' out
Freedom's song is ringin' loud
Dead men wakin' up to the sound of You

And all our hearts can sing
All our hearts can sing

Is, "Make a way for
Make a way for
Make a way for the King
The King is comin'
Make a way for
Make a way for
Make a way for the King
The King is comin'"

Split the sky with Your glory
Bring to life an awakening
Burn away everything that's not for You
Hear our voices cryin' out
We won't stop 'til the heavens come down
We won't stop 'til every knee bows to You

And all our hearts will sing
