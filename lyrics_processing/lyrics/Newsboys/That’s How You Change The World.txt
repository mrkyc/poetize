That's how you change the world
That's how you change the world

All my life I had big dreams to do
Big things and make a change
And all the while, I just passed by
The simple needs right here next to me

'Cause there's a breaking heart that's fallin' apart
And tear-filled eyes lookin' back at me
God, won't you help me to see

It's the prayer in an empty room
Little things we do when nobody's around
A hand reaching out to a heart in doubt
It's the smallest spark that can light the dark
That's how you change the world
(Change the world)
That's how you change the world
(Change the world)

A million little drops of rain
Can be enough to cause a tidal wave
A flood of Your love
That no one can contain

'Cause there's an empty soul that wants to be known
Around me now that I can lead to You
Revealing love that won't refuse

It's the prayer in an empty room
Little things we do when nobody's around
A hand reaching out to a heart in doubt
It's the smallest spark that can light the dark
That's how you change the world
(Change the world)
That's how you change the world
(Change the world)

It's the kind words
A simple smile
More than showin' up
Goin' the extra mile
It's givin' everything
When you've got nothin' left
Sharin' a little hope
With a single breath
That's how you change the world
That's how you change the world
It's the prayer in an empty room
A hand reaching out to a heart in doubt

It's the prayer in an empty room
Little things we do when nobody's around
A hand reaching out to a heart in doubt
It's the smallest spark that can light the dark
That's how you change the world
(Change the world)
That's how you change the world
(Change the world)

That's how you change the world
