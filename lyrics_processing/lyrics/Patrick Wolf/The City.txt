Won't let the city destroy our love
Won't let the city destroy our love
You know I
I hate to see you cry
But when you open up to me
I take you in my arms
Wish you the top, top, top, top of the morning
No, I
Don't care about cash nor careers
Your losses or your arrears
I take you in my arms
Wish you the top, top, top, top of the morning
I
Won't let the city destroy our love
Won't let the city destroy my love
Won't let no mistake take the roof from off our heads
No I
Won't let this city destroy us
Won't let the city destroy our love
(sax solo)
You might also like(come on)
Talk to me
Let me shed some light on your dark
Help you see
How darling you've left your mark
On my life
And the beautiful all around
When I see you, top, top, top, top of the morning
I was lost
Until that night we kissed
Give it up
A life, oh darling, not this
You want more
Than the hell this city lets you down
When I see you, top, top, top, top of the morning
I
Won't let the city destroy our love
Won't let the city destroy my love
Won't let no mistake take the roof from off our heads
No I
Won't let this city destroy us
Won't let the city destroy our love
Won't let the city destroy our love
Won't let the city destroy my love
Won't let no mistake take the roof from off our heads
No I
Won't let this city destroy us
Won't let the city destroy our love
(won't let the city, won't, won't let this city)
(sax solo)
No, no, no, no
Not about the debts you made
The car we never had
The house we never owned
Darling don't look so sad
It's about that day we kissed
Up by Niagara Falls
It's about the keys, the keys, the keys to my heart you hold
(Top, top, top, top of the morning to you)
Won't let the city destroy our love
Won't let the city destroy my love
Won't let no mistake take the roof from off our heads
No I
Won't let this city destroy us
Won't let the city destroy our love
Won't let the city destroy our love
Won't let the city destroy my love
Won't let no mistake take the roof from off our heads
No I
Won't let this city destroy us
Won't let the city destroy our love
(won't let the city, won't, won't let the city)
Won't let no mistake take the roof from off our heads
No I
Won't let this city destroy us
