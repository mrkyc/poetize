God damn
Damaris

Black rain
Floods the downs
Ferrets burrow
Moles make mounds
'Round your bones
Deep underground
But nobody knows
Nobody knows
How I wait for you
Summer, spring
Autumn, winter
Here perishing

Gypsy, stray
Bleak orphan
No one could say
The land you came from
But deep in my arms
You belonged
Nobody knows
Nobody knows
How I wait for you
Summer, spring
Autumn, winter
Here perishing
You might also like
My god damn Damaris
Killed with last kiss
God damn, Damaris
I loved you
God damn, Damaris
Killed with last kiss
God damn, Damaris
I loved you
I loved you
You, you, you

God damn these tears
And this religion
Thought I was more
Than just my father's son
Who says in limbo
Be where you've gone
But nobody knows
Nobody knows
So, here I wait for you
Summer, spring
Autumn, winter
Here perishing
(Wait for me)
My god damn Damaris
Killed with last kiss
God damn, Damaris
I loved you
God damn, Damaris
Killed with last kiss
God damn, Damaris
I loved you
I loved you
You, you, you
I loved you
You, you, you

And now I kiss
I kiss the earth
Oh, rise up
Rise up
Rise up, now
From the earth
And I smash my fist
Into the earth
Oh, rise up
Rise up
Rise up, now
From the earth
Rise up! Rise up! Rise up! Rise up!
Rise up! Rise up! Rise up! Rise up!
Rise up! Rise up! Rise up! Rise up!
Rise up! Rise up! Rise up! Rise up!
Rise up! Rise up! Rise up! Rise up!
(Oh)
Rise up! Rise up! Rise up! Rise up!
(Damaris)
Rise up! Rise up! Rise up! Rise up!
Rise up! Rise up! Rise up! Rise up!
(Oh, oh, Damaris)
Black rain
Floods the downs
The black rain
Black rain
Black rain
Floods the downs
The black rain
