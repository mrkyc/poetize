Poor little turtle dove
Sitting up in pine
Mourning for your own true love
Why not me for mine?
Why not, why not me for mine?
I've got hogs in the pen
And corn to feed them up
All I want is someone who will
Feed them when I'm dead and gone
Feed them when I'm dead and gone
'Cause I know I'm not gonna marry in the fall
And I'm not gonna marry in the spring
I will never marry, marry at all
No one will wear my silver ring
Wear my silver ring
Though, if I'm not gonna marry in the fall
And I'm not gonna marry in the spring
I will never marry, marry at all
No one will wear my silver ring
Wear my silver ring

Sitting up in pine
Mourning for your own true love
Why not me for mine?
Why not me for mine?
So, I went up to this mountain
To give my horn a blow
All the boys in the valley said
"Yonder comes my beau
Oh, yonder comes my beau"
But I know I'm not gonna marry in the fall
And I'm not gonna marry in the spring
I will never marry, marry at all
No one will wear my silver ring
And if I'm not gonna marry in the fall
And I'm not gonna marry in the spring
I will never marry, marry at all
No one will wear my silver ring
(Wear my silver ring, no one)
Poor little turtle dove
Sitting up in pine
Mourning for your own true love
Why not me for mine?
All I want is someone who will
Feed them when I'm gone
When I'm dead and gone, now
I will never marry, marry at all
No one will wear my silver ring
Feed them when I'm dead
Feed them when I'm dead
Feed them when I'm dead and gone
I will never marry, marry at all
