I said ain't no more upcoming shit I had to jump in line
Niggas could've been held me up they did otherwise
Don't know what its like where I'm from let me summarize
Niggas got shot bitches got fucked it was summertime
St. Luke's shit
Ain't no Ruth Chris it's Crown Fried
Up ten but I still press a nigga like I'm down nine
Everybody round me gotta work can't no clowns ride
When you out here tryna come up ain't no down time
Ima young king girl address me as such
Call me ya highness or ya majesty and sexy as fuck
She said you gotta lil change now you changing up
I said nah girl I was the same and had nearly as much

I'm tryna make it out the hood nigga who can't prevail?
I do features for the low I got food stamps for sale
And my girl won't leave me alone bout these "Loubs" and Chanel
And every time I drop its the new jam for real
If you my dawg then you part of the fam you understand
Don't hit my phone if you ain't call me back then you understand
Fuck talking lets do it like man you understand
I hit it once and I can do it again you understand

Seen my homegirl from college we don't speak like we used to
She was like 4'11 that was my little boo boo
You can hit it doggy style look like a pit on a poodle
We'd fuck fall asleep wake up eat ramen noodles
All of my niggas is cuckoo I mean they all gotta screw loose
And they all draw weapons I mean they all like to doodle
Couple rappers hating on me but all of em doo doo
And I'm the realest nigga ever nigga I'm Shaka Zulu
Goddamn babygirl I ain't talked to you in so long
Almost ain't recognize ya ass with ya clothes on
She said now you Hollywood you don't answer no phones
She said now you big time I said get ya roll on
That's one thing about me you know I hold shit down
Seeing me fucked up's like seeing a goldfish drown
Get ya crew wet up get ya ho dicked down
Bitches throw pussy at me like I know Chris Brown
Stop telling bitches that you know me please
Stop telling niggas that we homies please
Cause I was in the hooptie by my lonely please
If you ain't cool with 40 you don't know me

I'm tryna make it out the hood nigga who can't prevail?
I do features for the low I got food stamps for sale
And my girl won't leave me alone bout these "Loubs" and Chanel
And every time I drop a song it's the new jam for real
If you my dawg then you part of the fam you understand
Don't hit my phone if you ain't call me back then you understand
Fuck talking lets do it like man you understand
I hit it once and I can do it again you understand

I'm the hot boy the hot boy on fire
I done turned nothing into something like McGyver
A lot of niggas tried us and felt like dyers
The party's gonna be poppin if papa's on the flyer
Shorty with the bubble getting me in trouble
She walked up to me said papa boy I love you
She said are you single? I said nah bitch I'm double
She said you a clown I said I just like to juggle
I'm just tryna rap now I ain't tryna sell
I keep it a buck like a hundred dollar bill
I was drinking Hennesey now I'm drunk behind the wheel
Will a nigga ever change? I guess only time will tell

I'm tryna make it out the hood nigga who can't prevail?
I do features for the low I got food stamps for sale
And my girl won't leave me alone bout these "Loubs" and Chanel
Every time I drop a song its the new jam for real
If you my dawg then you part of the fam you understand
Don't hit my phone if you ain't call me back then you understand
Fuck talking let's do it like man you understand
