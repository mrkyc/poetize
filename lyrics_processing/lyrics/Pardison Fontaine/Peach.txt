Wheezy outta here
Yeah, yeah, fuck it up, yeah, look, uh
Said he's got the watch, flood it up
Cuban link, bust it up (Ayy)
You don't know how to fuck it up (Ayy, ayy)
Look (Ayy, ayy)

Everything that a nigga got, got it out the dirt (I did)
Like a rose in the concrete, I blossomed out the curb (Ayy)
Remember girls used to curve me, man, them bitches had some nerve
Ain't no nigga out here fucking with me, far as I'm concerned

You got a peach (Peach), ass (Ass), shit be looking right
You get to dancing in the mirror, you want some shit that get you hype
Gave a couple niggas chances, they ain't never get it right
Told your girl to leave them lames alone, so take your own advice
You got a peach (Peach), ass (Ass), shit be looking right
Girl, you bad and you working so you every nigga's type
Girl, you lit in real life, you don't need a lot of likes
And I know if looks'd kill, you doing 25 to life, ayy

Shake that ass, ooh, watch yourself, ayy
Shake that ass, ooh, watch yourself
Break them handcuffs, forget your man, move somethin'
If he ask you what you doin', say, "Ooh, nothin'"
You might also like
I said all you know is bustin', all you know is thuggin'
All you know is hustle, you been working more than clubbin'
Moving underground, young Harriet Tubman
All you make is money, you let bitches make assumptions
Now your girl is feeling hype because she know that this your song
My dawg said you ain't no freak, you about to prove him wrong
Got an ass like a horse, Old MacDonald had a farm
And I know I drive you crazy but I never steer you wrong

You got a peach (Peach), ass (Ass), shit be looking right

Let that ass hang out, bitch
All up out the window, screaming, "Ow," bitch
Sneak dissing so I turned into an owl, bitch
Screaming, "Who? Who finna do what to who?" Not you (Bitch)
In the Bentley truck, I need room (Yup)
My perfume is Chanel, you assume my next move (Hah)
You was off, no, not close
I could buy me a Ghost (Skrrt)
I just might do the most
Came from nothing so I post (Period)

Ayy, ayy, ayy (Ayy)
