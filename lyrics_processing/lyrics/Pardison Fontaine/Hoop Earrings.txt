All my bitches got hella ass and barely any stomach
Hoop earrings and cornrows, they tell me that they love me

Ayy, all my bitches got hella ass and barely any stomach
Hoop earrings and cornrows, they tell me that they love me
All bullets hit the back of everyone that fronted
Hundreds, fifties, twenties, just tell me how you want it
All my bitches got hella ass and barely any stomach
Hoop earrings and cornrows, they tell me that they love me
All bullets hit the back of everyone that fronted
I got hundreds, fifties, twenties, just tell me how you want it, ayy

My bitch is bad (My bitch is bad)
She from the streets (She from the streets)
She roll her eyes (Ayy, ayy)
She suck her teeth (Yeah)
She know the guys
She throw the signs (Woo)
Said fuck them niggas, ayy
She know the vibe (Ayy, ayy)
Fuck her 'til I fall asleep (Woo), ninety-three up in my Jeep (Ayy)
Strip club like once a week (Ayy), eat the pussy, rub her feet (Ayy)
I'm a savage dog, a beast, two phones and still hard to reach
She don't care what niggas say 'cause pussy calls and talk is cheap (Ayy)
My biggest fan and my worst critic, only like the song if she can twerk with it (Ayy)
Treat my bitches just like my business, I don't want no other niggas in it
Uncle Luke in the bank, nigga, don't stop, just get it, get it
She made me nut in like six seconds, said, "Chill, baby, it's been a minute" (Woo)

If you a CNA or a lash tech
Hit you doggystyle, lick your back sweat
Do your thing

Hairstylist or aesthetician
Social worker, who else I'm missin'?
If your head good, if your cookin' bustin'
Don't compete with no other woman

Don't you get no breast reduction
Baby, do your thing
