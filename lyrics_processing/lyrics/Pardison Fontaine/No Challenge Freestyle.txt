Fuck the rookies, I'm coming for the motherfucking vets
Real nigga, I'm the only motherfucker left
Like Russell Westbrook, I'm coming up they motherfucking chest, look
I'm twice as talented and three times as motivated, so sayin' that I'm underrated is an understatement
I'm coming for niggas right , ain't nothing sacred
'Cause I'm coming from a town where no-one fucking made it
Kicking down doors, two guns drew
You chill with bitch ass niggas, then you one too
I kick that shit, nigga this the new kung fu
Balmain G's, keep turning my shoe tongue blue
Young, rugged and thuggin', hate to switch the subject
Yet to met a cop that I fuck with
Look, if you like it, I love it, talk shit and got substance
I'm bustin' if I even see a condom in my luggage
God, I got some intuitions that I try to hide, and I got some deep thought that I keep locked inside
I know a lot of niggas older, but they not as wise
No man alive has witnessed the struggles I survived
"Oh, now you think you popping' 'cause you pop quoted?"
Nah nigga, I think I got it 'cause I'm locked and loaded
And shit, y'all could be right where I'm at too, but y'all was chasing the bitches and wasn't quite as focused
Aww shit, some niggas I never heard of, a long list of niggas I gotta murder
Whole bunch of: "What's that?" and "Who's he?"s
Thought they been stopped lettin' high schoolers in the league
If I'm tryna fuck it I clack who's in the lead
Scream: "Fuck you!", and then smack who disagrees
It's violence where I'm at, it's AK's and sirens where I'm at
Pray I don't get clipped for driving while I'm black
'Cause we gon' spit it like (ah), kick it like (ah)
Bitches get to grinning every time I ride (by)
The boys spazzin', more bars with more passion
Bitches say I look like a walking orgasm
Bad bitches on me, don't even call half 'em
Ball shirts is cool, I couldn't afford fashion
Whole lotta niggas had it easy, but I earned mine
This shit sound like  for the first time
This that wake up in the morning, go to work grind
Now my money long like "Free dinners at the church" line
So Lord help me with these demons I've been fighting with
Know we only call on Christ, when the price is it
Yeah I'm backside, but I'm still siding with righteousness
Devil want my soul, but I keep up in the price of it
God, nigga spittin' like a young Earl Simmons
He might share a chromosomes with a Nasir Jones
He Busta Rhymes wild with it, little bit of Jay-Z, label pass on me must be crazy, look
Either way you slice it my nigga, I'm nice , but get looked over like dark-skinned girls in high school
They always love all these wack-ass rappers with wild views
Like bad bitches love ugly niggas with nice jewels, but me I'm good looking, gifted and I'm talented
Said I couldn't make it from here, that's the analysis
I became a stereotype and then I challenged it
Worked my fingers down to the bone, peep the calluses, look
I ain't blaming where I'm from for where I'm at
My nigga, I'm sayin' it plays a part though
Carmelo would've been had a ring too, if he had went to Detroit instead of Darko
Rap where I'm at 'cause my heart cold, every night I dream of robbin' a Wells Fargo
Replug my vehicle, couldn't pay the car note
Now I drive a hooptie, with pussy like El Gallardo
I get women moist, my voice got that bravado
But get me burger-eating bitch and not a model
Still playing 2K, go half on the bottle
I'm busting niggas ass, gamertag, I can add you tomorrow
15 piece wing ding, spicy 'em all
St. Luke's I'm your prodigal child
I been talking to B.I.G like, son, you gotta be proud, ain't been a nigga like me in a while
You might also like
Section 8 nigga, sex symbol that is, you know what I'm sayin'
St. Luke's saved me, St. Luke's Babe Ruth nigga
I make nothin' but hits nigga, this for the crib nigga
Fontaine, nigga
That link in my bio, hotter than Cinco de Mayo nigga
Fuck you talkin' 'bout? Whatchu say?
Hey, ay, whatchu say?
