(Please have mercy on me)
I said I'm bout to kill these niggas hey we throw something on
Let God strike me dead if I say something wrong

I wonder if niggas still love me if I ain't blow
When I had my first show y'all ain't show
And don't hit me with that party bruh, I ain't know
You saw the fly you liked the picture nigga, I ain't slow
But I ain't tripping it's all good baby baby
And now the young boy got the charts going crazy
Rap with that black boy in that black Mercedes
Tell my chances slim but I could sign with Shady
Niggas hating
I kept it up cause I knew it wouldn't be long
Blackin' on every beat, spazzin' on every song
Hearing weak shit on the radio like how is he on
But even Kobe had to take a seat behind Eddie Jones
Now my niggas mighty rich, bitches is mighy thick
My liquor is mighty strong, you put that you mighty kong
I'm coming for the crown
I'm overthrowing the throne
It's Fontaine, my name etched into the stone nigga

(Please have mercy on me)
I see you niggas throwing rocks
Y'all ain't low
My city still be in the dark nigga if I ain't glow
(Please have mercy on me)
I'm about to kill these bitches ey we throw something on
And let God strike me down if I say something wrong
(Please have mercy on me)

Now it's Pardi Pardi when we gon' kick it
Sliding in my dms I ain't even got they digits
Cause they seeing sunshine but I heard it all before
The downfall of a god is too often a broad
I used to break em off but look I matured
I don't even answer the phone unless the number is stored
I feel sorry for you niggas
I know boys will be boys
She got you working for the pussy
And her ass is unemployed
Less you party with Rozay
Get your bricks from Jose
About to go to the leagues teams calling you everyday
How do these hoes get past
With they gold digging ass
If life was a show she did the whole frigging cast
So I do em how I do em
I just go hit and smash
They said what was shawty's name
I don't know, didn't ask
If God give me a child I'mma need a son
Cause if I do get a daughter I'm gon need a gun \
Lord
(Please have mercy on me)
If it's a girl I'mma love her
Let your will be done
Just keep my baby off the poll
And shows on VH1, Lord
(Please have mercy on me)
I'm about to kill it  just throw something on
And let the Lord strike me down if I say something wrong
(Please have mercy on me)

Look, now Lord forgive me
For acting so reckless
A nigga took your image
And threw it on a necklace
Just some other foolishness these hoes could be impressed with
I know I'm living fab, but hope my heart is in the question
Look, I tried to figure it out
Thought taking a different route
But first they gotta listen for your opinion to count
And they show up at the club
They giving a nigga bread
I know I drive a Benz
But my account is in the red
And if it wasn't for that Crown Fried
Or  on South Side
Lord sometimes a nigga wouldn't eat
And man that's on God
I mean, that's word to me
I'm trying to honor you
But trying to keep it G
And it's way easier to sin
But it hurts my heart
Tried to cutback on the cursing
But it hurts my art
You said you'd never give a soldier a mission he couldn't handle
Well good lord you must think a nigga Rambo
(Please have mercy on me)
This little light of mine here it ain't nothing but a candle
Use it to light the torch but niggas don't understand though
(Please have mercy on me)
Look, and I told you I'mma kill it
And I ask God to strike me dead if I say something wrong
And I said the same thing in the beginning
Look, check me out, still living nigga

Please have mercy on me
