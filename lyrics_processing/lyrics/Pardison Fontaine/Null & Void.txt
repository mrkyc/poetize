Uh
First floor
Yeah, yeah
Uh
Null and void
All a bunch of-  First niggas talking lately
Look, yeah
All that talking null and void
Got a hole bunch of nothing, look (None, look)
Aaargh (Aaargh)
First floor

Look, I said these niggas rappin'
They ain't fucking with the boy, what
If you ain't making money, sorry null and void
All that talking that you're doing, uh, all a bunch of noise
If you ain't making money nigga, it's null and void (Null and)
Null and void
Why it's null and void?
Judged a man from the boys from the price of their toys
Lately my pocket looking like they on 'roids
And the lady at the bank told me I'm catching up to Floyd
Oh shit, who that is?
Tell that bad bitch to strip for me
I was up in Sue's last night, throwing red money
Tell them niggas plotting', took your Bentley thing they get from me
I'm in here with wild cats, Arizona, Kentucky
Outside of the hood, my name ain't known
But I ain't tripping of that, because it won't take long
My dawg called the old man, he in a land of his own
And my brother 40 walking 'round looking like he just came home
I said now everywhere you go you see my niggas, like a class pic
These niggas ain't who they claim to be, that's a catfish
My girl said she gon' leave me, I keep fucking with these ratchets
The Rari go "Skrrrt", let me see the police catch this
And yeah, I got some money
But you ain't finna get it
Girl, fucking with me you can't get nothing, but pregnant
And now I don't like these rappers, man they trash anyway
You ain't gotta give me my credit, I'll take cash any day
Put some blast anyway, my niggas blast any day
Put some hole up in yo shit, let it breathe, ventilate
My nigga, that's where I'm from
That's how my niggas get down
That's how your bitches go missing
That's how your niggas get found
What
You might also like
All that talking, null and void
Hole bunch of none, look
First floor
Look, I said these niggas rappin'
They ain't fucking with the boy, what
If you ain't making money, sorry null and void
All that talking that you're doing, uh, all a bunch of noise
If you ain't making money nigga, it's null and void

Now what a wonderful feeling
This is real as it gets
Said my bitch is a dime, and my brothers a nig
I've been ballin' all year not a scuff on my kicks
I caught the bitch that was fronting, another one of the list
Anybody that's hating, they get laid of stiff
My niggas shoot from anywhere, like they J.R. Smith
Your girl told me you was here
She told me come to the crib
These hoes foul, real foul, on some playoff shit
And we're having it again, players losing their cool and their poise  here, over what seems to be normal NBA fouls
Aw hell, young legendary, any means necessary
Anybody better than me, already dead and buried
Might not be the case, but I'm close and that's very scary
Plus I'm working harder than Barack Obama's secretary
Hood superstar, I don't know what I'ma do next
Real nigga, I got all my hoes in a group text
After I beat the beat up, pussy you next
I'm thinking four hoes, put them bitches in a suplex
I'm sippin' my Henney, I'm living my life
Two things that any girl could use is some dick and advice
I hope Father forgive me, I ain't livin' it right
I was a guard when I was hooping, but I'm a center tonight
And nigga I ain't never coming, bitch I've arrived
I'm young, I'm black and I'm gifted, surprise
I came into this rap shit ready to kill something
You looking at a young nigga without a chill-button
