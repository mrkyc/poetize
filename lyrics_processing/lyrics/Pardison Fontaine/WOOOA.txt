Hook - Pardison Fontaine
Couple racks I got some change on me
Woooa
Walk like I got the thing on me
Woooa
{?} trippin' and we bang homie
Woooa
I never switch I got the same homies
Woooa
Ain't a bad bitch if she fire
Aim the chrome quick and it fire
She'll buss it open, he'll buss it open
If you heard something different you a liar

Verse 1 - Pardison Fontaine
You might also likeI'm in the club but I just left recording (recording)
Nike Tech sweatsuit and some Jordans (woo)
Bouncers and the DJs always make me feel important (eh)
Promoters in the dances always make me feel important
They wasn't sure about a n*gga but they know it now
Everything I touch a hit, boy I'm the golden child
When we did need help they gave us the run around
Tell them n*ggas take another lap, we don't want it now
Had the city on {?} n*ggas thought it was a fluke
Now we still running round like Bobby Brown and Uncle Luke
All my n*ggas play ball, all them n*ggas wanna shoot
They catch bodies and party man, that's all they wanna do
They call me Cognac party, the hunnid rack shawty
If {?} we was Dom Perignaughty
They saying all my verses are {?} and Glock 40s
I'm the same to St Lukes what John is to Marcy n*gga

Verse 2 - Pardison Fontaine
When I was chasing checks you was chasing bitches (you was)
When I was making plans you was making wishes
Now you can fuck with me and get paid
Or you can fuck with me and get paid a visit
It be like that, I'm a G like that
I don't never let no n*gga talk to me like that
If a sex tape leak of me and my bitch
Your girl gone ask you why you don't fuck me like that
Pumping up my air mattress and pumpin out classics
Damn, they ain't see all my potential and my passion
They ain't recognise the golden ticket when they had it
They always talkin' shit but then they switch when I ask 'em
But fuck them n*ggas, fuck them n*ggas, Imma kill em all then
Keep on getting bitches like R Kelly with the bald head
Me and money go together collard greens and corn bread
You ain't step a hater then get money off the wrong leg
Biiiiaaaatch

Verse 3 - Pardison Fontaine
You know me n*gga, Imma call a spade a spade
I could never cuff a woman that was in the trade
I ain't judgin', I ain't judgin shawty, I'm just sayin'
You too experienced for me but baby do your thang
When the team need a hit, I'm the one that they depend on
Do my dance on em like I'm Cam in the N zone
Your baby mama crazy, let me touch it while the kids home
I do my dance on 'em like Odell in the N zone
When a n*gga come for me then he getting left stranded
Laying on the head, I could whip it left handed
N*ggas talkin' down but I'm the one that's left standing
Y'all supposed to be {?} for a Grammy
Damn, dope got all the plugs for the drugs
Damn, I go to {?} for the love
Damn, this is what it is to what it was
Damn, this is how you drop and get a buzz n*gga
