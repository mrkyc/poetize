Why you always wanna argue, and complain?
Say you don't but then you start to, it's a damn shame
Why you never could just chill?
You like you argue keep it real
Them other niggas must've scared you, it's a damn shame
That make you hard to talk to, call me on my name
Why you never could just chill?
You like you argue keep it real

I know sometimes you
Say I'm out my mind, argue all the time, I don't even wanna start
Say you on my side, how you on my side always picking me apart, if it's real
Girl you don't care 'bout how I feel (Ouoooh)
Say you hate being chose then indict me
Keep masking the truth, have me sheisty
Unfair, unkind, gotta be better this time
But can we be greater than we are?
But can we be greater than we are, right now?
Peepin' some problem we can solve right now
We'll never be younger than we are right now
Can you calm down?
I just wanna pull up and love you right now
Baby let your guard down and put your arms around me
You be acting  but girl you still my 
You might also like
Why you always wanna argue, and complain?
Say you don't but then you start to, it's a damn shame
Why you never could just chill?
You like you argue keep it real

Three dots for two minutes
All I get is just one word: "I guess"
Then you start blocking numbers, upset
Girl I thought we was better than that, oh

But can we be greater than we are
But can we be greater than we are, right now
If it's a problem we can solve right now
We'll never be younger than we are right now
If it's a problem we can solve right now
Don't gotta argue, don't gotta complain
