Huh?

Hoop or he rap, only love a nigga if he hoop or he rap, what?
Nigga hoop or he rap, only love a nigga if he hoop or he rap
Man can't forget about the D-boys
On the corner that's moving them packs
Poppin' bottles every weekend in the club my nigga
Young boy shining like he hoop or he rap, what?
Hoop or he rap, only love a nigga if he hoop or he rap (What you say?)
How true is that? They only love a nigga if he hoop or he rap
See the Lamborghini in the projects
Everybody wanna know, whose shit is that?
Ain't no doctors or lawyers 'round here

Look, black nigga got a white Benz, uh
Black nigga got some white friends, uh
Black nigga got a black girl, what?
Why she had to be lightskinned, uh
I hit the clubs, this shit is sirens
Money, money, money, money, money, bitches wildin'
Money will turn the pussy to a hydrant
Money make wifey be cool with your side bitch
Say the bank love me when I'm making deposits
They love the whip, just hate the nigga hoppin' out it
Don't go on TV talking black shit
But you a hero if you coming out the closet
Only way a nigga make the news
He either got arrested or the sports page
You see a young nigga in a suit
Can't be an interview, he got a court date
Pull me over in my shit, they wanna see how I get it
It's either stolen or it's rented
I'm like aight, that's why I'm out here acting ign'ant
I'm a motherfuckin' menace
I don't even tint it, I leave the windows clear my nigga
I let the pigs see the pigment
They like I don't give a damn if it's yours motherfucker
Still a nigga nigga nigga, don't you forget it, ahh
I was always talking like this, I was always feeling myself, nigga
It always been all about the first, it was always fuck everybody else, nigga

I remember when I used to hit the club
Youngin didn't throw not a dollar (No)
Back then if a nigga had a drink
It was just a cup and not a bottle (Say word)
But come in that bitch with me now
Niggas might think I hit the lotto
'Cause I pour champagne, champagne everywhere nigga
The whole club need goggles, dollars
Falling out the pockets of my cargos
Throw it all like I ain't worried 'bout tomorrow
Let it all fall on a chick I don't know
Still ain't paid Sallie Mae the money that I borrowed, now
I see a lot of niggas with they hands out
I guess they won't take the grown man route
I guess now a nigga in demand
Everybody saying I'm the man now
Taking shots at me, I think they need better aim
He don't follow back, girl he not the same
It's funny how it's always the ones you don't know
First ones out here screaming that you changed
Can't mind they own business, got they mind on me
Phone calling my place, tryna rely on me
You either rap, sell crack, or play ball
If you from my hood you done tried all three
Everybody coming 'round for the popping of the bottles
Throwing dollars on these bitches and they boat when it clap
When I was making Ramen noodles in the microwave
With the tap water bro, where the fuck was they at? Ah
It's true, it's a fact
Man this new shit is wack
They don't want you in a foreign unless you doing somethin' foreign
Then they all on your dick like your pubes and your sack
