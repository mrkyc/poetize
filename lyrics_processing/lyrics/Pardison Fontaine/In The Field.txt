Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah
I said, now I was in the club, boppers show me love, yeah
Fuck this sweet shit

Look, say where you at? I'm in the field right now
I had to bust a dougie, shit was gettin' real right now
If you broke (Broke), I know how you feel right now
I got a baby on the way, I got bills right now
"Where you goin'? (Where you goin'?)" For the kill right now
I'm in the store lookin' for some shit to steal right now
They think I won't (They think I won't) but I will right now
Face down, ass up, you know the drill right now

I said the cops still wildin', my stock still risin'
These niggas still frontin' and these bitches still lyin'
They know that I'm the one, I'm a mothafuckin' problem
And the only thing I'm scared of's a mothafuckin' siren
Look, summer days was the worst days
We was drinkin' tap water, we was thirsty
A nigga lookin' for a come up in the worst way
Hungry on Friday and don't get paid 'til Thursday (What you say?)
They gon' tell you how it is
They say that touchin' bricks is better than touchin' ribs
And now I make it rain in the club, got the hoes gettin' loose
It used to rain in my crib, I had holes in the roof

I said now I feel, like Deion on draft night
I feel, like I was rich in my past life
Last night, I fucked with three or four bitches
And now I feel the same way I felt last night
I was in the club, I was sippin' bub'
Sittin' back, lookin' where we at and where we was
Nigga, pick a side, you with them or you with us?
Is it real? Is it fake? Nigga, you could be the judge
Look I came from nothin', and I remind myself a lot
Real nigga, I remind myself of Pac
Where I'm from, you either shoot or get shot
Where I'm from, you do the gettin' or get got
