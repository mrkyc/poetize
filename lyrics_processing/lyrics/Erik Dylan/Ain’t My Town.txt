Where I come from just because you hang out on the square don't mean you are one
If you can't afford a shiny four wheel drive truck with tractor tires you can still be someone
Out in Hollywood they think they got us understood good and figured out
And I ain't puttin' no one down, but that ain't my town

We like chasin' girls in cut off jeans, but that don't mean that's all we think about son
And folks 'round here we like cold beer, but that don't mean our world revolves around one
On the radio it's alway Friday night dirt roads, gettin' drunk and loud
Makes me wanna turn it down, 'cause that ain't my town

That ain't my town, that ain't my life, 'cause God I'm a man with one stoplight
It's got heart and it's got soul a whole lot deeper than the shallow
So don't go paintin' pictures of what you don't know about
Puttin' words in my mouth, 'cause that ain't my town

It's a feelin' that you can't explain, put in a frame or a box or on TV
'Cause the beauty of this place, it's savin' grace is what you get, it's what you can't see
You can't put your finger on what makes it home, makes you wanna settle down
But I'll be damned, yeah I'll be damned

If that ain't my town, that ain't my life, 'cause God I'm a man with one stoplight
It's got heart and it's got soul a whole lot deeper than the shallow
So don't go paintin' pictures of what you don't know about
Puttin' words in my mouth, 'cause that ain't my town

That ain't my town, that ain't my life, 'cause God I'm a man with one stoplight
It's got heart and it's got soul a whole lot deeper than the shallow
So don't go paintin' pictures of what you don't know about
