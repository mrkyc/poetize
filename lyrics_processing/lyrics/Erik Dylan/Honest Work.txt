She didn't come for no vacation
She's lookin' for an occupation
Some honest work, what could it hurt?
She made her way through the muddy water
Like the man that brought her taught her
It didn't hurt, it all seemed to work

Wipe the mud off your cold wet feet
Get on that bus and go to sleep
They won't bother you, what can they do?
The river smelled like milk and honey
Pretty soon she'll be makin' money
To send back home, 'cause she's all alone

Marlena, Marlena
Girl we love ya we just won't save ya

She dreams of home and all her family
She knew her leavin' didn't make 'em happy
But she had to go, she's all on her own
She cleans your house and she tends your children
And helps you with the life you're livin'
At half the price, well ain't that nice?
You might also like
She wipes the mud off her cold wet feet
Gets on that bus and falls asleep
She won't bother you, what can she do?
Her tears smell like milk and honey
Now she's savin' up her money
To go back home, 'cause she's all alone

Marlena, Marlena
Girl we love ya we just won't save ya

And if you think she don't belong here
Take a long look in your mirror
We're both the same, that girl's got a name
Tell me where your grandpa come from
Chances are he was lookin' for some
Honest work, what did it hurt?

He wiped the mud off his cold wet feet
Gets on the  train and he fell asleep
They didn't bother him, oh no they just let him in
The harbor smelled like milk and honey
Pretty soon he was makin' money
To build a home, and he was not alone
Marlena, Marlena

She didn't come for no vacation
