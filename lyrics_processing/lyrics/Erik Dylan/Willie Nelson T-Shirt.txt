Girl, we were just about as good as it gets
I was thinkin' 'bout buyin' a ring with a rock
Slip it on your fingertip
The one, I really thought you were the one
Yeah, you had me thinkin' 'bout a white dress
Picket fence, everything under the sun
True love

But what you done to me, what you done to me
Baby, no, you can't take back, it don't work like that
You used to be my honey, but you ain't nobody no more
So just give me my 1985 Willie Nelson T-shirt back
And I promise you that
I won't run around town tellin' everyone
You're a white lie, alibi, Scarlett Letter
You oughta be ashamed, girl, you shoulda known better
I know you can't help it, so I'll cut you some slack
If you give my Willie Nelson T-shirt back, yeah

Cry, yeah, you can cry all you want
But it ain't gonna do you no good
'Cause this ship just sailed, what's done is done
Yeah, you say there's a whole lot of fish in the sea
And one of them's lookin' at me with a grin
Think it's time to start fishin' again
She's a ten
You might also like
What you done to me, what you done to me
Baby, no, you can't take back, it don't work like that
You used to be my honey, but you ain't nobody no more
So just give me my 1985 Willie Nelson T-shirt back
And I promise you that
I won't run around town tellin' everyone
You're a white lie, alibi, Scarlett Letter
You oughta be ashamed, girl, you shoulda known better
I know you can't help it, so I'll cut you some slack
If you give my Willie Nelson T-shirt back

All I want is my Willie Nelson T-shirt
All I want, just give me that T-shirt back
I want my T-shirt back
I want my T-shirt back

What you done to me, what you done to me
Baby, no, you can't take back, it don't work like that
You used to be my honey, but you ain't nobody no more
That's for sure
So just give me my 1985 Willie Nelson T-shirt back
And I promise you that
I won't run around town tellin' everyone you're a whore
