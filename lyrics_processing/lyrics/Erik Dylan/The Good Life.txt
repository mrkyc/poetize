I go to work, 6AM, like every day since I've been outta high school I was so cool, never went to college but I ain't no damn fool
Played football, all-state, then Mary Ann got a little too late
I bought a ring, pawn shop diamond, Daddy was pissed, her mama was cryin'

Guys like me, run a hundred and fifty percent
Guys like me, would rather wreck it than make a dent
Guys like me, will keep searchin' for that truth
Yeah we sip a little 90 proof, like we got nothin' left to lose
But we do, and that's how you get by when the good life's killin' you

I'm a Tee-ball coach and I'm a good dad, couple bad dreams from Iraq
I clock in, I clock out, and I try to make a livin' in a three year drought
I go to church in a new used Ford, bow my head and thank the Lord
For three day jeans and lowball cards, 'cause life ain't livin' if it ain't hard

Guys like me, run a hundred and fifty percent
Guys like me, would rather wreck it than make a dent
Guys like me, will keep searchin' for that truth
Yeah we sip a little 90 proof, like we got nothin' left to lose
But we do, and that's how you get by when the good life's killin' you

Killin' you, fillin' you with bad news
But you do what you gotta do
Like your daddy did
And his dad for his kid

Guys like me, yeah you know we're gonna make the rent
Guys like me, we're gonna break before we bend

Guys like me, run a hundred and fifty percent
Guys like me, would rather wreck it than make a dent
Guys like me, will keep searchin' for that truth
Yeah we sip a little 90 proof, like we got nothin' left to lose
