I'm alright
And I got a good feeling
I've been fine
Yeah I got me some healing

You lit me up like fire, fire
And now I'm burning babe
Fire, fire, come on watch it blaze

I got power, tall as a tower
Monster, Momma moves
I'm on one
I got diamonds, sound of the sirens
Sixteen story views
I'm on one
I got visions, way up I'm living
Good, great, better, best
I'm on one
I got venom, know how to end 'em
S up on my chest

I'm alright
And I got a good feeling
I've been fine
Yeah I got me some healing

I'm the one, yeah I feel amazing
Make it look easy, baby
It ain't about money, but I get a mili I'm just like Lil Weezy baby
Who is she? Came to fuck up the foolery
Don't you think I'm a tease, maybe
I took a break to be breezy patient
I'm coming back to appease these patients
I'm a bitch, I'm a big dog, I rose through the devil and they nicknamed me Kristoff
They hit me with a left hook
My technique is my checkbook
Give it to 'em I don't need to relax

I'm alright
And I got a good feeling
I've been fine
Yeah I got me some healing

You lit me up like fire, fire
And now I'm burning babe
Fire, fire, come on watch it blaze

I got power, tall as a tower
Monster, Momma moves
I'm on one
I got diamonds, sound of the sirens
