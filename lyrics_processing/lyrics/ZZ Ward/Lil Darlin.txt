Oh please, please, please
Quit dragging my heart through them coals
Oh please, please, please
Stop trying to fix it 'cause baby it's broke
When it's late at night and you call me
'Cause I got another man fixing my blues
You should never, never worry about nothing baby
'Cause I never love someone new the way I loved you

And every word I say to you feels like I'm shouting out a bunch of whispers
And every word you say to me is like a bee sting leaving blisters
There ain't no honey left in this hive
There ain't no sugar nowhere in sight
I hate to love you
I love to hate you
I just can't shake you

Oh please, please, please
Quit dragging my heart through them coals
Oh please, please, please
Stop trying to fix it 'cause baby it's broke
When it's late at night and you call me
'Cause I got another man fixing my blues
You should never, never worry about nothing baby
'Cause I never love someone new the way I loved you

You're the static, just enough dramatic, shock you, drive me crazy, ain't no man
Could take your place you know it baby but I just can't stand you so it's got to end
There ain't no honey left in this hive
There ain't no sugar nowhere in sight
I hate to love you
I love to hate you
I just can't shake you

Baby when you want me, when you crave me, when you need it
If you ain't got the time to save me when I'm falling then just beat it
'Cause boy I can't be your medicine, your Ritalin, when you're fiending
If you won't be my knight in shining when I'm crying, when I'm screaming

Oh please, please, please
Quit dragging my heart through them coals
Oh please, please, please
Stop trying to fix it 'cause baby it's broke
When it's late at night and you call me
'Cause I got another man fixing my blues
You should never, never worry about nothing baby
