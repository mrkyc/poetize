I don't wanna let you in
'Cause I don't wanna let this thing in
Dirty karma never wins
But here are, back at it again

When the lights out, when we're all alone
Won't you take me down with your touch of gold?

Dreamin' while I'm wide awake
Don't know how much I can take
But I need it, can't leave it
'Cause you make me breathe in the deep
Whoa-ooh, the deep
Whoa-ooh, the deep
Whoa-ooh, the deep end

Every night I, I give you up
Every time, I swear it's too much
But I ain't tryna say it's done
'Cause gettin' some is better than none

Help me, I'm drowning
I can't stop, I'm going under
Come be the air my lungs

Oh, the deep

I walk in this bitch
Smoking, exhausting this bitch
Don't compare me, I'm different
I'm finna take off in this bitch
I'ma pull up in this bitch, man
I'm saucin', I'm drippin'
I'm prob'ly gon' buy me a whip
I'ma get lost in that bitch
Time gon' be missing
They all like, "What happened to him?"
All like, "What happened, Young Purple?
Young nigga, you different
You already changed"
Already want me the same
I skirt and skirt through the lanes
I know the pain, I know the pressure
But pressure make diamonds
And I'm out here shinin'
May not know the difference
I know the difference, man
I know the difference
What's real and what isn't
Always 100, forever official

Taking me under, you're taking me under
These covers I'm covered in
I can't recover

Dreamin' while I'm wide awake
Don't know how much I can take
But I need it, can't leave it
'Cause you make me breathe in the deep
Whoa-ooh, the deep
