Trying to be your hero, trying to save the day
But my soul is empty like a hollow grave
Trying to be your angel when you need to fly
But my wings are broken, can't touch the sky

Hold on, please don't leave me deep in my darkest hour
I know that you need me, so I'll try to find the power
Hold onto my cold fists, that I'll pull through for you
The lives that we end up with ain't always what we choose
Hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on

Trying to be your fire, trying to light the way
'Cause there ain't no sunshine when you fall from grace
If I lift you higher, will you pick me up?
Being down ain't no crime in the name of love

Hold on, please don't leave me deep in my darkest hour
I know that you need me, so I'll try to find the power
Hold onto my cold fists, that I'll pull through for you
The lives that we end up with ain't always what we choose
Hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on
You better hold on, hold on

I, I pulled a lot
Would tell myself without you, I'd be fine
But I'm just dark in here without your light
So, hold on, darling, bring me back to life
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on

Hold on, please don't leave me deep in my darkest hour
I know that you need me, so I'm trying to find the power
Hold onto my cold fists, and I'll pull through for you
The lives that we end up with ain't always what we choose
Hold on, hold on
You better hold on, you better hold on
Hold on, hold on
You better hold on, hold on, hold on
You better hold on, hold on
(Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on)
