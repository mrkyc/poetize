Lonely
Lonely

I gave you every single thing I possibly can
I tried to spell it out, but you just don't understand
The mornings are the hardest 'cause I don't ever sleep
When it's like you're not even here lying next to me

What do I, what do I, what do I do now?
Baby, it's like you've been gone
Without you, without you, without you, darling
I wouldn't feel so alone

Let the rain fall down on me
Oh, Lord, I'm so lonely
Black clouds keep calling
Oh, have mercy on me
Let the rain fall down on me
Oh, Lord, just set me free
I keep chasing this glory
Oh, Lord, I'm so lonely

I chase you like a dream that's always running away
How is it I love something that I fucking hate?
Every time I feel like I'ma figure it out
You play me like a fool and watch me drown in my doubt

Let the rain fall down on me
Oh, Lord, I'm so lonely
Black clouds keep calling
Oh, have mercy on me
Let the rain fall down on me
Oh, Lord, just set me free
I keep chasing this glory
Oh, Lord, I'm so lonely

Oh, I'm so lonely, it's hard to believe
In over my head, I'm down on my knees
Oh, I'm so lonely, and how could this be?
As long as my blood's been, my heart's gonna beat
So hold me, darling, oh, why can't you see?
Without your touch, I might as well up and leave
Hold me, darling, or just let me go
If I'm so lonely, might as well be alone
I'm so lonely
I'm so lonely
I'm so lonely
(Hold me)
Let the rain fall down on me
Oh, Lord, I'm so lonely
Black clouds keep calling
Oh, have mercy on me
Let the rain fall down on me
Oh, Lord, just set me free
I keep chasing this glory
Oh, Lord, I'm so lonely
