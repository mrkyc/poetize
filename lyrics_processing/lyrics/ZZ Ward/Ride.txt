I feel the wind run through my hair
Top down, the sun's gonna lead us there
Ray Bans and this '64's all we need
Don't let your head get in the way
Just let your heart beat wild and free
Open the door, jump in, and turn the key

I live my life out on the edge
Yeah, I don't stop just 'cause it's red
Let's push this thing, see what we get
This black pavement, these yellow lines
Are pulling us into the night
I feel my temperature rise

Ride, ride, ooh
Ride, ride, ooh
Ride, ride, ooh
Ride, ride, yeah we gon' ride

I used to sit inside my room
Dreamin' of things that I could do
Too scared to put my hands up on the wheel, oh
Now I'm with you, and I can't look back
It's such a rush when we're moving fast
I can't deny the way you make me feel, whoa
