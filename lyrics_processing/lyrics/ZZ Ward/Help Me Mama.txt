This is exactly what I, I was afraid of
I get too close to you and find out what you're made of
I would have figured you out sooner or later
It's getting ugly, but it looks good on paper

My daddy raised me
Tried to keep me his sweet baby
But who else can I call
When my whole world is going crazy?

Singing, help me ma-ma-ma-mama
Help me mama
Help me mama
Help me ma-ma-ma-mama
Help me mama
Help me mama
Help me ma-ma-ma-mama
Help me mama
Help me mama
Help me ma-ma-ma-mama
Help me mama
Help me mama

I'm screaming at you, but you meet me with laughter

Just when you get me high
That's when you drive me low
Just when I hold you tight
That's when you let me go
And this house is smoking
Can't breathe, the windows broken
But, baby, if you burn me
Better sleep with one eye open
