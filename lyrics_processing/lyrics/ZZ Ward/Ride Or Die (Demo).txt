Sitting here in this Cadillac with a .9 millimetre gun
Taking puffs off a cigarette
We might fight or we might run
Got my pearls, got my jean shorts on, got my heels up on the dash
Watching close for my baby's signal, pull the break and hit the gas

The sun's getting low
But I've nowhere else to go

I'm your ride or die chick
I'll never ask why
You know that I got you
You know I won't cry
I'm your ride or die chick
Nowhere to hide
Call me your Bonnie, I'll call you my Clyde like
(Woop woop) when we hear the sirens coming boy
(Woop woop) we're never gonna freeze
(Woop woop) when they wonder who is running boy
(Woop woop) that's the sound of the police

When he's broke, I'll eat bread and butter
When he's rich, we'll sip champagne
If he flirts then I'll call his mother
Give him double hell to pay
We cry together, we lie together
Shouldn't be no other way
My bones will be next to your bones until our dying day

(Woop woop) when they wonder who is running boy
(Woop woop) that's the sound of the police

When you fighting, I'm fighting
And when you packing, I'm packing
And when you riding, I'm riding
And when you laughing, I'm laughing
When I'm looking in your eyes, it's like I'm looking at lightning
Since the day that you struck me, it's like my black clouds are whitening
Nobody got me 'til you were standing beside me
I was better off dead 'til you shook up my head
And that's why I'mma ride or die
I'm your ride or die bitch
I'll never ask why
You know that I got you
You know I won't cry
I'm your ride or die bitch
Nowhere to hide
Call me your Bonnie, I'll call you my Clyde like
(Woop woop) when we hear the sirens coming boy
(Woop woop) we're never gonna freeze
(Woop woop) when they wonder who is running boy
