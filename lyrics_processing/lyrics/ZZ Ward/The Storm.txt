There ain't no way that I could change your mind
There ain't no way, I tried a thousand times
Singin', O Lord, won't you save me? O Lord keep me warm
Whoa, Lord, won't you save, O Lord, from the storm?

Cold rain like tears from silver sky
Fall on this broken house of lies
You stand there, screaming in the yard
I never thought it'd be this hard

There ain't no way that I could change your mind
There ain't no way, I tried a thousand times
Singin', O Lord, won't you save me? O Lord, keep me warm
Whoa, Lord, won't you save, O Lord, from the storm?

You walk straight down that gravel road
I cried and begged you not to go
The wind was tearing through the sycamore trees
The clothesline blowing in the breeze

There ain't no way that I could change your mind
There ain't no way, I tried a thousand times
Singin', O Lord, won't you save me? O Lord, keep me warm
Whoa, Lord, won't you save, O Lord, from the storm?

You tore my heart right out my chest
I stood and watched the red sunset
I feel it risin' in my bones
The sirens howl, and I'm alone
Whoa alone, whoa, my baby
Whoa, it's gone, whoa

There ain't no way that I could change your mind
There ain't no way, I tried a thousand times
Singin', O Lord, won't you save me? O Lord, keep me warm
Whoa, Lord, won't you save, O Lord, from the storm?
There ain't no way that I could change your mind
There ain't no way, I tried a thousand times
Singin', O Lord, won't you save me? O Lord, keep me warm
