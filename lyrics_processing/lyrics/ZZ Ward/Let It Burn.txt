When my heart it is broken
And my soul it is weak
You're standin' above me
With your heel at my cheek

And oh, merciful sinners
You kick me when I'm down
I'm tryin' to make you love me
But we're both hell-bound

Please, just let go, 'cause I'm on the edge
The sky, it is turning a crimson red (Ah-woo)
Flick on the lighter, pull it 'til it hurts
You started the fire, baby, I'mma let it burn

Burn, burn, burn, I'mma let it burn (Wooh, yeah)
Burn, burn, burn, I'mma let it burn (Wooh)
Burn, burn, burn, I'mma let it burn (Wooh, yeah)
Burn, burn, burn, I'mma let it burn

From the moment I failed you
You were onto the next
Running fast with the Devil
I was under your hex
