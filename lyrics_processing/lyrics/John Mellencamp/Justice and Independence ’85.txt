Hey!

He was born on the fourth day of July
So his parents called him Independence Day, yeah
He married a girl named Justice
Who gave birth to a son called the Nation
And she walked away
Independence would daydream and he'd pretend
That some day him and Justice and Nation'd be together again
But Justice held up in a shotgun shack
Wouldn't let nobody in
So the Nation cried

Oh, oh
When a Nation cries
His tears fall down like missiles from the skies
Justice look into Independence's eyes
Can you make everything alright?
And can you keep your own Nation warm tonight?

Well, Nation grew up and got himself a big reputation
Couldn't keep the boy at home, no no
He just kept running 'round and around and around and around
Independence and Justice well they felt so ashamed
When the Nation fell down they argued who was to blame
And Nation if you'll just come home we'll have this family again
Oh, Nation don't cry

Can you make everything alright?
Can you keep your Nation warm tonight?
