The simple minded
And the uninformed
Can be easily led astray
And those that cannot connect the dots
Hey, look the other way
People believe what they want to believe
When it makes no sense at all
So be careful of those killing in Jesus's name
He don't believe in killing at all

Walk tall (Keep on walkin', keep on talkin')
Yeah walk on (Keep on walkin', keep on talkin')
Through this world
Walk tall

Somewhere out in the distance
Is the death of you and me
Even though we don't think of it much
It's still out there for us to see
If you treat your life like a bar room fight
You'll die stinking of gin
No drunkards are allowed in heaven
No sinners will get in

Walk tall (Keep on walkin', keep on talkin')
Yeah walk on (Keep on walkin', keep on talkin')
Walk tall (Keep on walkin', keep on talkin')
Through this world
Walk tall

So be careful in what you believe in
There's plenty to get you confused
And in this land called paradise
You must walk in many men's shoes
Bigotry and hatred are enemies to us all
Grace, mercy and forgiveness
Will help a man walk tall

So walk tall (Keep on walkin', keep on walkin')
Yeah, walk on (Keep on walkin', keep on walkin')
Walk tall (Keep on walkin', keep on walkin')
Through this world
Through this world

Yeah, walk tall (Keep on walkin', keep on walkin')
Then walk on (Keep on walkin', keep on walkin')
Walk tall (Keep on walkin', Keep on walkin')
Then walk on (Keep on walkin', keep on walkin')
Through this world, through this world (Keep on walkin', keep on walkin')
Through this world, through this world (Keep on walkin', keep on walkin')
Walk tall (Keep on walkin', keep on walkin')
Walk tall (Keep on walkin', keep on walkin')
Then walk on (Keep on walkin', keep on walkin')
