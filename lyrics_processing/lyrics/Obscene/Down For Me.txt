I wanna know will you be down for me ?
This is something that we just can't fight..
It just feels so right, tonight..
I wanna know will you be down for me ?
This is something that we just can't hide..
Not this time..

Girl I know that we just barely met
But there's something about you I just can't resist
Them pretty lips got me doin' so much crazy shit
And that smile slowly killin' me like cancer sticks
It's like whenever we're together it just feels so right
Chillin' in her room blazin' spliffs all night
We both know this is somethin' that we just can't hide
Cuz we're meant to be together like pedals on a bike (right?)
So go ahead and tell me if you feel the same way
Lay it on the line so we can skip all the lame dates
Stop holdin' back baby honestly I can't wait
Heart beatin' fast like a player on his game day
But I ain't really tryna rush you though
Because I'm holdin' my grip and yet I'm losin' control
You're sending me signals and its confusing my thoughts
Can you answer the riddle? Cuz I just really wanna know
Tell me..

I'm not the type of guy who likes to play games
I can feel the spark between us manifesting into flames
You really drive me crazy, you're driving me insane
You keep me on track as we're switching lanes
You can call me lucid, can I call you dream ?
I could be your king if you would be my queen
To me you're like a drug, for you I'm just a fiend
Infatuated with your presence, your beauty is unseen
Your complexion and affection, it makes my heart scream
Livin' in a dream seems like (seems like) we connect
I'll always be your friend and treat you with respect
I see us going far even though our steps are slow
Walking down this road yet again, but not alone
I look into your eyes and I've already fallen
I hear our hearts beating slowly, slowly they are callin'
My world is at a standstill, for you I keep pausin'
Let me know...
I wanna know will you be down for me ?
This is something that we just can't fight..
It just feels so right, tonight..
I wanna know will you be down for me ?
This is something that we just can't hide..
