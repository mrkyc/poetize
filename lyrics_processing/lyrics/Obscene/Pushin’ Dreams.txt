Pushin' Dreams
When life isn't what it seems
Dreams became reality, it lift me off my feet
Started at the bottom, never accepted defeat
Now we're at the top just living the dream

Look
I came a long ass way to get to where I'm goin'
When life gets bizarre, I just go with the flow
And just show 'em, What it takes to succeed
I've been through a lot of shit but now I'm living the dream
Situations come and go it ain't a problem to me
I'll make the best of it, now rappin' I perfected it
Haters staying tuned all they witness is development
Got a mental plan to bring change like the president
I'm guessing that's what happens when I'm using my intelligence
Made the right moves, called the shots like a veteran
Grown man status kid I've always been the better man
Always kept my cool and thought it out like a master-plan
I'm tryna make it to the top as fast as I can
What started as a dream changed the life that I had
Cause I came from the bottom and made my way up
Steadily pushin' dreams, worked hard and never gave up
It's so bizarre...

When life isn't what it seems
Dreams became reality, it lift me off my feet
Started at the bottom, never accepted defeat
Now we're at the top just living the dream

Must I become a victim? To life and actuality?
Writing tracks everyday hoping to get a salary
At the same time, going to school
Mom has always told me, get an education or become a fool
So I hit the books every night, got a grip of my life yeah
And I also rock the mic, do it pretty nice
Improving everyday
Will I make it to the top? Will I be a heavy name?
Will I live a good life? This feelin' is very strange
Thought it was out of my range
No obstacle's impossible
No illusion correct in my opticals, kept my eyes on the probable
Made impossible so possible
Every time I rock a show (scratch that)
Every time I kick a flow
Everyday I live my life I gain wisdom as I write
I might become a big name
But I'll never sell my soul and I won't give up my brain
I'll make sure to represent this game, Lucid is the name
Hip-Hop Disciple, lyrically loaded using the mic as a rifle
Pushin' Dreams
When life isn't what it seems
Dreams became reality, it lift me off my feet
Started at the bottom, never accepted defeat
