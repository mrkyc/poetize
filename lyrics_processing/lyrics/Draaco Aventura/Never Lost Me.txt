Feel like you had lost me, baby
Drama's been exhausting lately
Feel like you had lost me
No you never lost me
Have you been in love, for life
Have you given your all to
Really love someone
Been reliable as the Sun
Well, I love her like that
Think I've, lost my soul mate
Not sure, she's coming back
But life ain't all bad
Have you been in love, for life
Have you given your all to
Really love someone
Been reliable as the Sun
Well, I love her like that
Think I've, lost my soul mate
Not sure, she's coming back
But life ain't all bad
Hear my soul cry
Make it last this time
We'll fix this tonight
Make it last this time
Hear my soul cry
Make it last time
Give one last try
Make it last this time
