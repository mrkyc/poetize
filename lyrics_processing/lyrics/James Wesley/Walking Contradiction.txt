I just keep it simple, I say it's complicated man
Well you got your opinions and I got my views
But since you asked, let's grab a glass and I'll explain it to you
I go to the church, I go to bars
I read the Word, I read the stars
Dixie waves in my front yard
But the stars and stripes are in my heart
Yeah you might see gray but I'm black and white
Not afraid to love, not afraid to fight
I love my mama, hell raising Christian
A midnight run and a walking contradiction
I like my country mixed with a little rock
I plant my corn in rows, but there's weeds in my crop
My dad retired from GM in the spring of '94
Well I'm loyal to my daddy, but hell I drive a Ford
I go to the church, I go to bars
I read the Word, I read the stars
Dixie waves in my front yard
But the stars and stripes are in my heart
Yeah you might see gray but I'm black and white
Not afraid to love, not afraid to fight
I love my mama, hell raising Christian
A midnight run and a walking contradiction
You might also likeYeah there a lot of folks out there just like me
We are what we are and we are what you see
We go to the church, we go to bars
We read the Word, we read the stars
Dixie waves in our front yards
But the stars and stripes are in our hearts
Yeah you might see gray, but we're black and white
Not afraid to love not afraid to fight
We love our mamas, hell raising Christians
A midnight run and a walking contradiction
Yeah I love my mama, hell raising Christian
