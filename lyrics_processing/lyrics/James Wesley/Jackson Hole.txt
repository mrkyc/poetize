She said "We don't get much show in Tampa Bay"
She said, "I got confused, ended up on the blues
I was hopin' someone like you would come my way
I said, "Let's sit here and enjoy the view
Let you catch your breath for a minute or two"
The air is thin in Jackson Hole
When the sun goes down, it's bitter cold
Unless you can charm somebody into keepin' you warm
Find a hole in the wall with a cover band
Baileys and beer, yeah you laugh and dance
And you sing along to every song
And fall like the snow in Jackson Hole
Spent a couple of nights drownin' in her eyes
Gettin' lost between those tan lines from the coast
All the words we said, all the promises
I was sure she'd never let me go
But your heart can play tricks on your mind
When you're makin' love at the timber line
The air is thin in Jackson Hole
When the sun goes down, it's bitter cold
Unless you can charm somebody into keepin' you warm
Find a hole in the wall with a cover band
Baileys and beer, yeah you laugh and dance
And you sing along to every song
And fall like the snow in Jackson Hole

We kissed goodbye, I said I'll call you first thing in the mornin'
When I woke up on Monday, I dialed the number she gave
That old man answered, said "Son, no one lives here by that name"
The air is thin in Jackson Hole
When the sun goes down, it's bitter cold
Unless you can charm somebody into keepin' you warm
Find a hole in the wall with a cover band
Baileys and beer, yeah you laugh and dance
And you sing along to every song
