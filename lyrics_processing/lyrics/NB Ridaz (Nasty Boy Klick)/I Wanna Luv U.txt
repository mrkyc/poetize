If I tell you that I love you and I put my trust in you
If I say that every minute all I do is think of you
Will you do the same for me, are you really down for me
Let me know just how youre feelin
Would you give it all for me
(Verse 1)
How would you feel if I told you - all I ever do
Is reminisce of the times that I spent with you
Rollin through the park on a Sunday afternoon
Dedicatin slow songs - to say that I love you
Its for my honey wit the pretty brown eyes
Never givin up on me - never tellin lies
Makin promises together we ride
I put this one on everything Im glad shes mine
And I love it when we all alone
Never miss a beat when da slow jams on
Babygirl please understand
I wanna be the only one that ever hold your hand - yea!  And show me
That your down for mine
Keep my reservation till the end a time
Youre like a treasure I was blessed to find -
My Precious One ... and Imma love you for life
You might also like(Chorus)
I wanna love you like you never been loved
I wanna rock you like you never been rocked
But I gotta know the deal, baby tell me how you feel
If I change my world for you, are you feelin me too?
Verse 2
Hey girl Ill never leave you perfect man is what you need
Theres no such so thing so Ill do anything you please you
I know you want me girl and I want you too, feels just like a dream
Just to be here with you
I would drop in a second just to think youd be gone
Living a lonely life I just couldn't go on
We felt lost in love from the first time we met
You were so down for mine you showed me much respect I know its hard to
Love a nasty boy like me
You know you had a choice and
Who you liked was me
Some times I wish this world was just me and you
My love is unconditional best believe its true, Thank the lord
Every day for connecting us two
So tell me baby girl what you wanna do
Im that one second to none show much love to you
They wanna know how Im rollin; Im rollin with you yea!
(Chorus)
(Verse 3)
You know Im feelin you girl, I just can't lie
Things wouldn't be the same without you by my side
I lose my mind every time you come around
And Imma do whatever just to prove that Im down, You broke my game
And set new rules
And all I wanna do is rock with you, come on!
Dont be afraid cause Imma take my time
And before the night is over you gone be just fine
(Chorus)
