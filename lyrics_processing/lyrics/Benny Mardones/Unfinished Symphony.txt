The air smelled oh so sweet
Couldn't help but think about you
Walking down our favorite street
Music from the bars were playing
One of our favorite songs
I could hardly stand it
My love for you is oh so strong
Every night I'm going crazy
Calling out your name
Cause only you can save me
I don't wanna live my life
In the middle of these city lights
Cause everythings reminding me of you
I don't know what to do
From the sound of the falling rain
Coming down on this subway train
I'm holding on to the memory
We're like an unfinished symphony
I knew it from the very first moment
I ever laid eyes on you
You were sent from heaven
You were here to help me get through
I turned around and broke your heart
Words I didn't mean
I can't live without you
Your the reason I believe in dreams
You might also likeEvery night I'm going crazy
Calling out your name
Cause only you
Only you can save me
I don't wanna live my life
In the middle of these city lights
Cause everythings reminding me of you
I don't know what to do no
From the sound of the falling rain
Coming down on this subway train
I'm holding on to the memory
We're like an unfinished symphony
And if I had the chance
To play that song again
I'd do it right
So the music wouldn't end
No no no Baby
I don't wanna live my life
In the middle of these city lights
Cause everythings reminding me of you
I don't know what to do no
From the sound of the falling rain
Coming down on this subway train
I'm holding on to the memory
We're like an unfinished symphony
Baby you and me
