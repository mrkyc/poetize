Here in my heart tonight
With everything I'm worth
I still want you
I know words can never change
The way that you feel about me now
But I just got to say
I still love you
Every night I lie awake
Going back in time
Playing over and over and over again
I must have been out of my mind
Oh baby, love me like you used to do
I'll do anything that you want me to
Believe me, I'll be good to you
There's a hole in my heart only you can fill
One more chance, baby, say you will
Believe me, I'll be good to you
It's a mystery to me
Just who it was that let you go
I can't believe I did it
'Cause I still love you
Oh baby, love me like you used to do
I'll do anything that you want me to
Believe me, I'll be good to you
Oh, remember me, baby, remember my kiss
No one out there is gonna love you like this
Oh, I'll be good to you
I'm going in circles, stuck like a broken record
I'm going 'round and 'round
And playing it over and over and over again
Oh, don't let me down, no
Baby, love me like you used to do
I'll do anything that you want me to
Believe me, I'll be good to you
There's a hole in my heart only you can fill
One more chance, baby, say you will
Believe me, I'll be good to you
Baby, love me like you used to do
I'll do anything that you want me to
Believe me, I'll be good to you
Oh, remember me, baby, remember my kiss
No one out there is gonna love you like this
Oh, I'll be good to you
Baby, love me like you used to do
I'll do anything that you want me to
