Sometimes there are things
You can only tell a stranger
And we all have our demons
That's something I know about
And you remember the first time you saw her
Her hair was more than blond, man, it was white
And you remember the smell of her sweet perfume
And the sounds of the engines
And the tail lights as she pulled out of sight
Oh, you try to hold on
When something is gone away for good
Out in the rain
How can you face the night again?
Her voice is calling to you
Pulling you close to the flame
Never surrender
When you can hold on
Places where no one
Remembers your name
And your living on the edge
Close to the flame

And I mean you're watching the cars pass you by
Just wondering where they're going
Ooh, ooh, yeah, fighting the feeling
And you're living out in the street man
And I mean there's nothing over your head but the sky
And the rain comes down and slaps you up
And slaps you on the face
You try to be strong
When something is gone away for good
Out in the rain
How can you face the night again?
Her voice is calling to you
Pulling you close to the flame
Never surrender when you can hold on
Places where no one
Remembers your name
And your living on the edge
Close to the flame
You can try to change it, if you can explain it
And you try to be strong while you're holding on
And you're looking for lot at the end of the road
Her voice is calling to you
Pulling you close to the flame
Never surrender
When you can hold on
Places where no one
Remembers your name
And your living on the edge
Her voice is calling to you
Pulling you close to the flame
Never surrender
When you can hold on
Places where no one
Remembers your name
And your living on the edge
Close to the flame
And your living on the edge
Close to the flame
And your living on the edge
Her voice is calling to you
Pulling you close, close to the flame
Never surrender
When you can hold on
Her voice is calling to you
Pulling you close, close to the flame
And your on the edge
Close to the flame
Close to the flame
