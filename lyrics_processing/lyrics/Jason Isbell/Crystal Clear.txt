Daylight's comin' in
I guess the blanket's gettin' thin
And every shadow on my skin's a different shade
There's nobody here
I heard 'em call it Crystal Clear
When you get by yourself and you're still wide awake

Stay away from that place
For your own sake

Manny's fast and cheap
His daughter never goes sleep
She lost thirty-seven pounds in ninety days
He don't cook that much
He says he does it for the rush
And as for makin' money, he's got other ways

So stay away from that place
For your own sake

Stay away from that place, it ain't about somebody seein' you
And it really don't matter if he helps you pay the bills
If they take your kids away, you know you don't need 'em
And if you ever get 'em back, you'll prob'ly get 'em both killed

"Summer went too fast,"
I think as I laid off the gas
And I roll onto Manny's street and smell the flames
Big red truck sits still
And all the water looks surreal
And I think Manny had the skill but not the brains

Should've stayed away from that place
Now it's too late

Stay away from that place, it ain't about somebody seein' you
And it ain't about havin' your name on the sheriff's list
Well, I told you one day, you'd burn down the whole damn avenue
I thought your mama raised you better than this

Benny's in the ground
Oh, Manny burned that trailer down
Nobody gave a good goddamn 'bout him or his
Baby's in the dirt
She finally fit into that old skirt
But I guess that don't make much difference after this
She should've stayed away from that place
Oh, I'm glad I did

Stay away from that place, it ain't about somebody seein' you
And it ain't about havin' your name on the sheriff's list
Well, I told you one day, you'd burn down the whole damn avenue
