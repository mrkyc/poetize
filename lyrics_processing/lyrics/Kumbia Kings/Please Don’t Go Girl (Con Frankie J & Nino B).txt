Please, don't go
Please, don't go
Please, don't go
(Please don't go, girl)
Don't go, girl
(You would ruin my whole world)
Oh oh, girl, don't go
(Tell me you'll stay)
Tell me that you'll stay with me
(Never ever go away)
'Cause everything will be alright
Yo, now listen to my story folks 'cuz it's all real
And if you're out there, girl, listen this is how I feel
I never meant to disrespect you in any way
You're mine so neglect what your friends have to say
It's true I spend more time at work than I'm with you
But in this business, this is something that I have to do
Quality of time is a valuable requirement
Reminiscin' on the days that I should've spent
But now, they went, they gone, can't get 'em back
All I'm trying to do is bring my paper stack back
From the beginning, I was winning and it's all good
But now this way, it's not turning out the way they should
Many things got together, I wish I could
Understand where I'm comin' from I wish I would
I think about you all time and every minute
I really can't see my future without you in it
And that's for real, baby
(Please don't go, girl)
Don't go, girl
(You would ruin my whole world)
Oh oh, girl, don't go
(Tell me you'll stay)
Tell me that you'll stay with me
(Never ever go away)
'Cause everything will be alright
I ain't gonna lie, you bring the best out of me
I'd rather chill wit you instead of runnin' the streets wit my peeps
Just the two of us wrapped in the Polo sheets
Livin' out of dreams, ain't that what you wanted from me?
I admit I got a little possessive, situations got aggressive
I tripped off the things you suggested
Pride overpowered my emotions
Most of the time, I was coasting and taking love potion
Now, I'm on the couch huggin' a bottle
And drinking slotion, love washed away into the ocean
Too much commotion not enough devotion
Left my heart roastin', now you braggin' and boastin'?
But that's okay, I'll be fine, forever you'll be mine
I'll love you till the end of time
You want me to beg, ha, I don't think so
All I can say is, girl, don't go
(Please don't go, girl)
Don't go, girl
(You would ruin my whole world)
Oh oh, girl, don't go
(Tell me you'll stay)
Tell me that you'll stay with me
(Never ever go away)
'Cause everything will be alright
See girl, you got me in the sticky tight situation
Don't blame it on me, blame it on my simple temptation
You lead me somehow, someway to my destination
Without you roamin' navigation with no calculation
I know the Louis Vuitton and Gucci don't mean nothing
Appreciate everything you do, I guess that means something
I know a lot of times you get up and just leave
But you do love me that is something that I do believe
I'll give it all up just to get back all your hugs and kisses
'Cause when you with me, you're without all competition
I know from time to time you might see my eye drifting
But you're the one that takes and catches all my attention
I know you see them houchies' numbers all in my phone
You're like my OJ and now my juice is all gone
So give me one more chance to take this last dance, lady
Just thinking 'bout you out my life makes me go crazy
I love you, baby
(Please don't go, girl)
Don't go, girl
(You would ruin my whole world)
Oh oh, girl, don't go
(Tell me you'll stay)
Tell me that you'll stay with me
(Never ever go away)
'Cause everything will be alright
(Please don't go, girl)
Don't go, girl
(You would ruin my whole world)
Oh oh, girl, don't go
(Tell me you'll stay)
