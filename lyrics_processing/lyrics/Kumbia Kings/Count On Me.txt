Ooooooh baby baby baby yea
Listen to what I'ma bout to say
Well it's been about 6 months 2 weeks about 7 days
That you haven't got a call from him or even had him come your way
Tell me what kind of man just gets up and leaves both his wife and kids
That ain't no real man
Let me tell you that's no real man
He's not supposed to run and leave
Just because things weren't right
He made a vow to you
By saying that he's down wit you
So now you come to me cause girl you know he's my best friend
But what am I supposed to do
Nothin' I do is gonna make him change
(Chorus)
You can count on me
(easy as one two three)
You can count on me
(don't worry about a thing)
You can count on me
(you know that I am so so down for you shorty
Yeah listen now)
You might also likeNow it's been about a year and still he hasn't shown his face
He hasn't come around he hasn't even seen his kids
And every day she prays that one day he'll be comin' soon
Cause they keep askin' her 'Momma tell us where did daddy go'
Cause He wasn't supposed to run and leave and be
Just because things weren't right
He made a vow to you
By saying he was down wit you
So now you come to me cause girl you know he is my best friend
But what am I supposed to do
Nothin' I do is gonna make him change
You did everything you could
To try to change his ways
(You did everything you could)
Even tried to make it work
Still he chose to walk away
Baby yea
You can count on me
You can count on me
You can count on me
You know that I'm so so down for you shorty
Yeah listen now
You can count on me
You can count on me
You can count on me
You can count on me
(easy as one two three)
You can count on me
(don't worry about a thing)
You can count on me
(you know that I am so so down for you shorty
