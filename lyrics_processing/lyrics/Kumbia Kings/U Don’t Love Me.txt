Girl,  I can't believe you tried to play me for a fool
I almost didn't see this one coming
You don't love me (You don't love me, you don't love me)

Girl, don't tell me no more lies
Pretending that your satisfied
Baby, I know your love's not true
Quit trying to playing me for a fool
Girl, you know that you are wrong
Your here one minute and the next your gone
I'm not blind, baby, I can see
So why don't you admit you don't love me?

You called me on the phone
Saying you'll be late coming home
You said your boss is making you work late, but I don't believe it
Cause when I called your office
So that I could speak with you
You know what they told me?
They told me that you quit last week

And how can you explain that when we make love
Your calling out somebody else's name
And when we kiss your eyes are open wide
And they can't hide what you feel inside, baby

Girl, you know that you are wrong
Your here one minute and the next your gone
I'm not blind, baby, I can see
So why don't you admit you don't love me?

I saw you on the street
At the place we were supposed to meet
But you were with another man, I couldn't believe it
So I asked your friends "Who the hell was he?" (Who was he?)
You know what they told me?
It was the guy that you met last week

And now I can explain
Why when we make love
Your calling out somebody else's name
And when we kiss
Your eyes are open wide
And they can't hide what you feel inside, baby
Girl, don't tell me no more lies
Pretending that your satisfied
Baby, I know your love's not true
Quit trying to playing me for a fool
Girl, you know that you are wrong
Your here one minute and the next your gone
I'm not blind, baby, I can see
So why don't you admit-

You played with my heart
And try to play me for a fool, yeah
And like the saying goes
"What goes around comes around"
And one day, you'll know how exactly how it feels
How it feels, ooh

Girl, don't tell me no more lies
Pretending that your satisfied (Satisfied)
Baby, I know your love's not true
Quit trying to playing me for a fool
Girl, you know that you are wrong
Your here one minute and the next your gone
I'm not blind, baby, I can see
