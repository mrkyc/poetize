Girl, I can't believe you tried to play me for a fool
I almost didn't see this one coming
You Don't Love Me...
(You Don't Love Me... You Don't Love Me)
CHORUS:
Girl, Don't tell me no more lies
Pretending that your satisfied
Baby, I know your love's not true
Quit tryin' to play me for a fool
Girl, you know that you are wrong
Your here one minute
And the next your gone
I'm not blind... Baby, I can see
So why don't you admit...
You Don't Love Me
VERSE 1:
You call me on the phone
Saying you'll be late coming home
You say your boss is making you work late
But I don't believe that
'cause when I called your office
So that I could speak with you
You know what they told me...
They told me that you quit last week

And how can you explain
That when we make love
(Make Love)
Your calling out somebody else's name
And when we kiss your eyes are open wide
And they can't hide what your feeling inside baby...
CHORUS:
Girl, Don't tell me no more lies
Pretending that your satisfied
Baby, I know your love's not true
Quit tryin' to play me for a fool
Girl, you know that you are wrong
Your here one minute
And the next your gone
I'm not blind... Baby, I can see
So why don't you admit...
You Don't Love Me
VERSE 2:
I saw you on the streets
At the place we were supposed to meet
But you were with another man
I couldn't believe that
So I asked your friends
Who the hell was he
(Who was he)
You know what they told me
It was a guy that you met last week
HOOK:
And now I can't explain
While when we make love
Your calling out somebody else's name
And when we kiss your eyes are open wide
And they can't hide what your feeling inside baby...
CHROUS:

And the next your gone
I'm not blind... Baby, I can see
So why don't you admit...
BRIDGE:
You play with my heart
And tried to play me for a fool... yeahhhh...
TALKING:
And like the saying goes...
What come's around...

And one day, you'll know exactly how it feels
(How it feels... ooohhh)
