Don't Wanna Try (W/ Frankie J)
(Intro)
Don't wanna try, don't wanna try
Don't wanna try no more
Don't wanna try, don't wanna try, don't wanna try no more, don't wanna try
Oh...
(Verse 1)
I can't believe you had the nerve to say the things you said
They were so bad that they ended our relationship
I can't believe it, four years go down the drain
How I wish things would have happen so differently i try to say this many times
But still you could't see
You kept insisting and resisting that you would not fall again
And now you are trying to tell me that you are sorry,and you are trying to come
Back home
And telling me you really need me, crying, begging both knees on the floor but
Baby I....
(Chorus)
Don't wanna try, don't wanna try, don't wanna try no more
You keep insisting when you know our love is out the door
Don't wanna try, don't wanna try cuz all we do is fight
And say things that hurt you bad to where we both begin to cry
Don't wanna try, don't wanna try about you're sad enough
It's been a rough road, baby just let it go
Don't wanna try, don't wanna try, don't wanna try no more
Tell me what's the use of holding on
When all we do is hurt our love

You and I had many conversations on the telephone talks about one day we having
A place of our own. wake up in the morning and have breakfast ready on the
Table. but all of that just seems so far away from me, after we could face
Reality. it all just seems to be too good to be true after all you put me
Through
And now your trying to tell me that you're sorry and you are trying to come
Back home. and telling me you really need me, crying, begging both knees are on
The floor but baby I....
(Chorus)
Don't wanna try, don't wanna try, don't wanny try no more you keeping insisting
When you know our love is out the door
Don't wanna try, don't wanna try cuz all we do is fight and say the things that
Hurt you bad to where we both begin to cry
Don't wanna try, don't wanna about you're sad enough its been
A rough road, baby just let it go
Don't wanna try, Don't wanna try,don't wanna try no more tell me wutz the use
Of holding on when all we do is hurt our love
(Outro)
Don't wanna try, don't wanna try,don't wanna try no more
Don't wanna try, don't wanna try, oh oh
Don't wanna try, don't wanna try, don't wanna try no more
