What your tellin' me right now
After all that we've been through
Tell me, how could this be end?
I just don't understand
I can't believe the words your tellin' me
You say your not in love no more and you have to leave
What did I do to make you feel this way?
Please tell me now what can I do to make you stay?
Chorus:
Oh girl don't abandon me don't you take your love from me
'Cause don't you know that girl without you I'll go crazy
Please girl don't say good-bye, don't make me break down and cry
Oh you are my everything
Verse 1:
Girl if you leave
Then tell me what am I suppose to do?
What am I suppose to do?
Tell me Where do I go from here without the love of you without you in my life?
Without you in my life
What kind of life would that be?
I'm beggin' you to stay so don't you take your love from me
You might also likeI can't go on without you here with me
I really need you
I'm in pain girl. Can't you see how much love I truly have for you?
How could you do this to me tell me what can I do?
Chorus:
Oh girl don't abandon me don't you take your love from me
'Cause don't you know that girl without you I'll go crazy

Suppose to do
Tell me Where do I go from here without the love of you without you in my life?
In my life
What kind of life would that be? I'm beggin' you to stay so don't you take your love from me
Baby look at all the things we have been through
Then look into my eyes girl and see it's you that I'm into
You know that when I met you that I changed my life
So that why I bought you ice then made you wife
Took you on first 'cause flights
Give you kiss to make up the fights
Know that I was alright
Let your love get the best of me
'Cause sleep without you next to me
Give you all my G's and now you want to up and leave
Got me down on bed and knee and I'm beggin' please to hold tight
Instead of wonderin' why they say that I man is supposed to cry
Just rub my eyes and let you know I need you in my life
Just so I can make things right
Did everything you told me to
Can't help her get close to you. So If You Leave what am I suppose to do?
Girl if you leave
Then tell me what am I suppose to do?

Tell me Where do I go from here without the love of you without you in my life?
