Ohh ohh ohh
Ohh, baby baby baby yeah
Listen to what I'm about to say
When it's been 'bout 6 months
2 weeks, 'bout 7 days
That you haven't got a call from him
Or even had him come your way
Tell me what kind of a man just gets up
And leaves both his wife and kids
That ain't no real man
Let me tell you that's no real man
He's not suppose to run
And leave just because things aren't right
He made a vow to you
And saying he was down wit you
So now you come to me, girl
'Cause you know he's my best friend
But what am I suppose to do?
Nothin' I do is gonna make him change
You can count on me
Easy as 1 2 3
You can count on me
Don't worry 'bout a thing
You can count on me
You know that I'm so so down for you shorty, yeah listen now
Now it's been about a year
And still he hasn't shown his face
He hasn't come around
He hasn't even seen his kids
And everyday she prays
That one day he'll be coming soon
'Cause they keep asking her
"Mommy, tell us where did daddy go"
'Cause he wasn't suppose to run
And leave just because things weren't right
He made a vow to you
By saying he was down wit you
So now you've come to me, girl
'Cause you know he's my best friend
But what am I suppose to do?
Nothin' I do is gonna make him change
You did everything you could
To trying to change his ways
(You did everything you could)
You even tried to make it work
Still he choose to walk away, yeah, baby yeah
(Listen now)
You can count on me
You can count on me
You can count on me
You know that I'm so so down for you shorty, yeah listen now
