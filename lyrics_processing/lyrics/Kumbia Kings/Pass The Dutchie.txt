With music vibration
Sounds to really make you rub and scrub
Music happen to be the food of love
I say: Pass the Dutchie upon the leff hand side
Pass the Dutchie upon the left hand side
Pass the Dutchie upon the left hand side
.It a gonna burn
Give me music make me jump and prance
It a go done
Give me the music make me rock in the dance
It was a cool and lovely breezy afternoon
How does it feel when you've got no food?
You could feel it 'cause it was the month of June
So I left my gate and went out for a walk
How does it feel when you've got no food?
How does it feel when you've got no food?
As I pass the dreadlocks' camp I heard them say:
Give me music make me jump and prance
Pass the Dutchie upon the left hand side
It a go done
It a gonna burn
You might also likeSo I stopped to find out what was going on
Give me the music make me rock in the dance
How does it feel when you've got no food?
'cause the spirit of Jah you know he leads you on
There was a ring of dreads and a session was there in swing
How does it feel when you've got no food?
How does it feel when you've got no food?
You could feel the chill as I seen and heard them say:
Pass the Dutchie upon the leff hand side
Pass the Dutchie upon the left hand side
Give me music make me jump and prance
It a go done
It a gonna burn
Give me the music make me rock in the dance
'cos me say listen to the drummer
Me say listen to the drummer
Me say listen to the bass
Give me little music make me wind up me waist
Me say listen to the bass
Give me little music make me wind up me waist
Pass the Dutchie on the left hand side...
