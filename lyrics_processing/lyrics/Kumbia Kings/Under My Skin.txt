Ohhhhhh alright oh baby
From the very first time
I looked into your eyes I couldn't deny
Those hips those thighs
Make me wanna eat you up like my mama's pie
I'd be like 40 days and 40 nights just to make you my queen
You make a fool of a man turn him straight when you hit the scene
Im like a voter girl you got me rock hard
Ide be like a baby boy with a brand new toy tear you hard
You got me slobbering, drewling
Thinking X rated
You always on my mind and oohh I just hate it
You butt nakid with water glistening all over your body
Visoins of us ice crust getting naughty
Heavenly father forgive me for theses type of sins
But this girl that I feel is under my skin
(chorus)
I feel you under my skin
This time I sink you in
I feel you under my skin
Im going crazy for you baby
I feel you under my skin
Dont know when to begin
I feel you under my skin
I want to love to let you in

So fast so quick in a hurry
So sweet like a flurry
Lets come together in one room like a grand jury
Come on, cause I have gotto keep it real
To show you how I feel
My secrets' bout to be revealed
I got to break it down
