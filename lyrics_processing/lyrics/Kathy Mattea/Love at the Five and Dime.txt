Hazel eyes and chestnut hair
She made the Woolworth counter shine
And Eddie was a sweet romancer
And a darn good dancer
When they'd waltz the aisles of the five and dime
Now Eddie played the steel guitar
And his mama cried as he played in the bars
He kept young Rita out late at night
So they married up in Abilene
Lost a child in Tennessee
Oh, and still that love survived
'Cause they'd sing
Dance a little closer to me
Dance a little closer now
Dance a little closer tonight
Dance a little closer to me
'Cause it's closing time
And love's on sale tonight at this five and dime
One of the boys in Eddie's band
Took a shine to Rita's hand
So Eddie ran off with the bass man's wife
Oh, but he was back by June
Singing a different tune
And sporting Miss Rita back by his side
You might also likeAnd he sang
Dance a little closer to me
Dance a little closer now
Dance a little closer tonight
Dance a little closer to me
'Cause it's closing time
And love's on sale tonight at this five and dime
Eddie traveled with the barroom band
Till arthritis took his hands
Now he sells insurance on the side
And Rita's got a house to keep
Dime store novels and a love so sweet
They dance to the radio late at night
And they sing
Dance a little closer to me
Dance a little closer now
Dance a little closer tonight
Dance a little to closer me
'Cause it's closing time
And love's on sale tonight at this five and dime
Dance a little closer to me
Dance a little closer now
Dance a little closer tonight
Dance a little to closer me
'Cause it's closing time
