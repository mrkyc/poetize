Knowin' that I may not ever hold you
Quite the way I told you
But the distance won't silence my devotion
'Cause I believe there is still a way to reach out
In my heart there's no doubt
Love travels the miles upon the wings of angels
Love finds you, I swear its true
I can love you from here - I'll love you from here
So I gaze at the photograph before me
Wonderin' if you still believe I love you
I did what I had to do
Then I look and I swear I saw you smilin'
Well heaven makes these tender hearts the strongest
Mine beats for you as long as
Love travels the miles upon the wings of angels
Love finds you, I swear its true
I can love you from here
On moonbeams, on heartstrings
Love makes its way through anything
Love finds you, I swear it's true
I will always be near, I'll love you from here
You might also likeWell time will never change me
You just gotta believe
Oh and the dream that saves me
Is that you're happy and that you're free
It'll fly through the air with the greatest of ease
As much as you want, now, as much as you need
Across every mountain and all seven seas
Oh the eagles'll carry it on God's gentle breeze
And I'll never give up (Never give up)
I'll never give in (Never give in)
And you'll know that it's me hear the voice singin'

Sing it (Sing it)
Sing it (Sing it)
Sing it
Love travels the miles upon the wings of angels
Love finds you, I swear its true
I can love you from here
On moonbeams, on heartstrings
Love makes its way through anything
Love finds you, I swear it's true
I will always be near, and I'll love you from here
