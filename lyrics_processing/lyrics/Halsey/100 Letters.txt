Well, King Midas put his hands on me again
He said one day I'd realize why I don't have any friends
Why I find myself alone at night unless I'm having sex
But he can make me golden if I just showed some respect

But I don't let him touch me anymore
I said, "I'm not something to butter up and taste when you get bored
'Cause I have spent too many nights on dirty bathroom floors
To find some peace and quiet right behind a wooden door"

He said, "Please don't go away"
He said, "Please don't go away"
I said, "It's too late"
I said, "It's too late"
He said, "Please don't go away"
He said, "Please don't go away"
I said, "It's too late"
I said, "It's too late"

And now I can't stop thinking that I can't stop thinking
That I almost gave you everything
And now the whole thing's finished and I can't stop wishing
That I never gave you anything
You might also like
You wrote a hundred letters just for me
And I find them in my closet in the pockets of my jeans
Now I'm constantly reminded of the time I was nineteen
Every single one's forgotten in a laundromat machine

But I don't let him touch me anymore
I said, "I'm not something to butter up and taste when you get bored
'Cause I have spent too many nights on dirty bathroom floors
To find some peace and quiet right behind a wooden door"

He said, "Please don't go away"
He said, "Please don't go away"
I said, "It's too late"
I said, "It's too late"
He said, "Please don't go away"
He said, "Please don't go away"
I said, "It's too late"
I said, "It's too late"

And now I can't stop thinking that I can't stop thinking
That I almost gave you everything
And now the whole thing's finished and I can't stop wishing
That I never gave you anything
And I can't stop thinking that I can't stop thinking
That I almost gave you everything (I said, "It's too late")
And now the whole thing's finished and I can't stop wishing
That I never gave you anything
He said, "Please don't go away"
He said, "Please don't go away"
I said, "It's too late"
I said, "It's too late"
He said, "Please don't go away"
He said, "Please don't go away"
I said, "It's too late"
