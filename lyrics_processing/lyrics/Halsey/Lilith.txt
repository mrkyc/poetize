Well, I'm perfection when it comes to first impressions
Well, I romanticize and then I get to stressin'
Big brain like I'm teachin' it a lesson
Baby, it's a blessin', yeah
You got me thinkin' that I was too mean
Well, everything that I say, I believe
Tuck a knife with my heart up my sleeve
And change like a season, reason for nothin'
I am disruptive, I've been corrupted
And by now, I don't need a fuckin' introduction
I been gone 'cause I been on this road too long

You know I get too caught up in a moment
I can't call it love if I show it
I just fuck things up if you noticed
Have you noticed? Tell me, have you noticed?
I get too caught up in a moment
I can't fall in love if I show it
I just fuck things up if you noticed
Have you noticed? Tell me, have you noticed?

Now, I'm wonderin' if I ever wanted to hold you
It never mattered if I owned you
'Cause you'd let anybody with a body control you
And you know it too
You got me feelin' like I been too mean
And everything that I say, I believe
Tuck a knife with my heart up my sleeve
And fuck like a demon, do it like nothin'
I am disgustin', I've been corrupted
And by now, I don't need no help to be destructive
I been gone, yeah, I been on this road too long

You know I get too caught up in a moment
I can't call it love if I show it
I just fuck things up if you noticed
Have you noticed? Tell me, have you noticed?
I get too caught up in a moment
I can't fall in love 'cause I'm focused
I just fuck things up if you noticed
Have you noticed? Tell me, have you noticed?

The more that you give away
The more that you have
More that you give away
More that you have
The more that you give away
The more that you have, the more that they take
