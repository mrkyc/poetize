I'm only whatever you make me
And you make me more and more a villain every day
But you don't know, you reap, you sow
Whatever you give to me, from yourself, you take
Well, if you're a hater, then hate the creator
It's in your image I'm made

One eye open and one eye closed
'Cause I'll hang myself if you give me rope
I lost all my faith and lost all hope
That everything means anything at all
One eye broken and one eye bruised
'Cause I gave myself away for you
You liar, you don't love me too
It's easy for you after all

My heart is massive, but it's empty
A permanent part of me, that innocent artery
Is gaspin' for some real attention
Some undivided hypertension
Tell it, "Quiet down, you're bein' loud"
But it beats harder every time you come around
But do you love the sound?
You might also like
I sleep with one eye open and one eye closed
'Cause I'll hang myself if you give me rope
I lost all my faith and lost all hope
That everything means anything at all
One eye broken and one eye bruised
'Cause I gave myself away for you
You liar, you don't love me too
It's easy for you after all

Losing you is easier than
Lying to myself that you love me
Losing you is easier than
Lying to myself that you love me
Losing you is easier than
Lying to myself that you love me
Losing you is easier than
Lying to myself

I sleep with one eye open and one eye closed
'Cause I'll hang myself if you give me rope
I lost all my faith and lost all hope
That everything means anything at all
One eye broken and one eye bruised
'Cause I gave myself away for you
You liar, you don't love me too
It's easy for you after all
