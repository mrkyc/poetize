Blue water, blue eyes color me
If any could come this close I would let them see
Get it out again play 'em one more song
It's all I really wanted who's to say that's wrong

Ain't that what you want them to know?
All they get of you is what they get out of the show
The rest is mine I guess the beauty and the mess
To hide

I pull my self under and down I go again
It's just a little bit hard letting them in
Looking at the world through illusive eyes
I hide in the spotlight, it's a great disguise

Ain't that what you want them to know?
All they all they get of you is what they get out of the show
The rest is mine I guess the beauty and the mess
To hide

Behind the melody the words don't mean a thing
But every tone I play would give whatever I've not said away
Behind the melody the words don't mean a thing
But every tone I play would give whatever I've not said away
Behind the melody the words don't mean a thing
But every tone I play would give whatever I've not said away
