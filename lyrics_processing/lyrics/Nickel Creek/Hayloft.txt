It started with the hayloft a-creakin'
Yeah it just started in the hay-loft
With his long johns on, Pop went a-creeping
Out to the barn, up to the hay
Young lovers and they are not sleeping
Young lovers in the hay-loft
With his gun turned on, Pop went a-creeping
Out to the barn, up to the hay

Yeah it just started in the hay
With his long johns on, Pop went a-creeping
Out to the barn, up to the hay-loft
Young lovers with their legs tied up in knots
Young lovers with their legs tied up in knots
With his long tall gun, Pop went a-creeping
To blow their hayloft bedheads straight off
