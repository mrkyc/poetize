He prayed for the moon to give him light
For he had many a mile to go that night
Before he reached the town-o, town-o, town-o
He had many a mile to go that night before he reached the town-o
He ran till he came to the farmers pen
The ducks and the geese were kept therein
He said: a couple of you are gonna grease my chin
Before I leave this town-o, town-o, town-o
A couple of you are going to grease my chin before I leave this town-o
He grabbed the gray goose by the neck
He threw a duck across his back
And he didn't mind the quack-quack
And the legs all danglin' down-o, down-o, down-o
He didn't mind the quack-quack
And the legs all danglin' down-o
Well the old gray women jumped out of bed
Out of the window she popped her head
Cryin': John, John, the gray goose is gone
The fox is on the town-o, town-o, town-o
John, John the gray goose is gone and the fox is on the town-o
Johnny's in the basement
Mixing up the medicine
I'm on the pavement
Thinking about the government
The man in the trench coat
Badge out, laid off
Says he's got a bad cough
Wants to get it paid off
Look out kid
It's somethin' you did
God knows when
But you're doing it again
You better duck down the alley way
Lookin' for a new friend
A man in the coonskin cap, in the pig pen
Wants eleven dollar bills, you only got ten
Maggie comes fleet foot
Face full of black soot
Talkin' that the heat put
Plants in the bed but
The phone's tapped anyway
Maggie says that many say
They must bust in early May
Orders from the D.A. Look out kid
Don't matter what you did
Walk on your tip toes
Don't tie no bows
Better stay away from those
That carry around a fire hose
Keep a clean nose
Watch the plain clothes
You don't need a weather man
To know which way the wind blows
Oh, get sick, get well
Hang around a ink well
Hang bail, hard to tell
If anything is goin' to sell
Try hard, get barred
Get back, write braille
Get jailed, jump bail
Join the army, if you fail
Look out kid
You're gonna get hit
But losers, cheaters
Six-time users
Hang around the theaters
Girl by the whirlpool
Lookin' for a new fool
Don't follow leaders, watch the parkin' meters
Oh, get born, keep warm
Short pants, romance
Learn to dance, get dressed, get blessed
Try to be a success
Please her, please him, buy gifts
Don't steal, don't lift
Twenty years of schoolin'
And they put you on the day shift
Look out kid
They keep it all hid
Better jump down a manhole
Light yourself a candle
Don't wear sandals
Try to avoid the scandals
Don't want to be a bum
You better chew gum
The pump don't work
'Cause the vandals took the handles

And there were the little ones eight, nine, ten
Sayin' daddy, daddy, better go back again
It must be a mighty fine town-o, town-o, town-o
Daddy, daddy, go back again for it must be a mighty fine town-o
The fox and his wife, without any strife
They cut up the goose with a fork and a knife
And they never had such a supper in their life
And the little ones chewed on the bones-o, bones-o, bones-o
They never had such a supper in their life
