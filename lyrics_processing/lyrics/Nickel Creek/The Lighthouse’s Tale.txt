I am a lighthouse, worn by the weather and the waves
I keep my lamp lit, to warn the sailors on their way
I'll tell a story, paint you a picture from my past
I was so happy, but joy in this life seldom lasts

I had a keeper, he helped me warn the ships at sea
We had grown closer, 'till his joy meant everything to me
And he was to marry, a girl who shone with beauty and light
And they loved each other
And with me watched the sunsets into night

And the waves crashing around me, the sand slips out to the sea
And the winds that blow remind me
Of what has been, and what can never be

She'd had to leave us, my keeper he prayed for a safe return
But when the night came
The weather to a raging storm had turned
He watched her ship fight
But in vain against the wild and terrible wind
In me so helpless, as dashed against the rock she met her end

And the waves crashing around me, the sand slips out to sea
And the winds that blow remind me
Of what has been, and what can never be

Then on the next day, my keeper found her washed up on the shore
He kissed her cold face
That they'd be together soon he swore
I saw him crying, watched as he buried her in the sand
And then he climbed my tower, and off the edge of me he ran

And the waves crash around me, the sand slips out to sea
And the winds that blow remind me
Of what has been, and what can never be

I am a lighthouse, worn by the weather and the waves
