It's been too long, stranger
(It's been too long, stranger)
Guess even hard times fly
(Guess even hard times fly)
And leave us speechless
(Leave us speechless)
In the darkness
Before the dawn

Are you hanging in there?
(How about this weather?)
Are the kids all right?
(Oh remember that one time?)
Before every sentence
(Felt like a sentence)
To life with old friends
Droning on

Where's the get
Where's the get in
Being together?
Did we forget
Did we forget or
(Is this where I oughta be?)
Where's the get
Where's the get in
Being together?
(Time has changed the view)
When we forget
Are we to gather there's
No more to get
In this together?

Time has changed the view

It's been too long, stranger
(It's been too long, stranger)
I guess the well's run dry
(Has the well run dry?)
And we've been missing
(What are we missing?)
Absolutely nothing
(Is there nothing?)
But a memory
(About that memory)
To move beyond
(To build upon?)

Where's the get?
Where's the get in
Being together?
When we forget
Should we remember
(This is where I wanna be)
Where's the get?
Where's the get in
Being together?
(Though time has changed the view)
When we forget
Are we to gather
There's no more to get
In this together
(You came here because of me)
No more to get
Only to give into
Being together
(And I'm me because of you)
When I forget won't you
Help me remember
As we drone on
(As we drone on
Past the break of dawn)
Hit rock bottom
(Of that dry well)
And get to shoveling
(Fellow stranger)
We're our own water
(And we've been too long)
Too long coming
