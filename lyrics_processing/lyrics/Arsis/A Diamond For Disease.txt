Your words were always chosen wisely, disguising all intent
Amidst the poetry, I thought I heard you say
"Let's make a deal, a diamond for disease..."
Then the promise of never was as embracing as the act of strangulation
The idea of forever became the grandest humiliation
I keep remembering your words, spoken in the guise of an oath, the promise of never
Now never is all I ever receive, never, and the knowledge of your disease
Those two words spoken aloud, I do, the promise of never
Yet I still come, like a moth to a flame in assurance of pain
Still you come, a breathing deathwish, with daggers drawn
Always denying the idea that the mystery's resolved
Examined closely, understanding all intent
Amidst our screaming, I know I heard you say
"Let's make a deal, a diamond for disease..."
If that's your idea of forever, I would gladly take strangulation
Your idea of forever is the grandest humiliation
Your matrimony was silenced
All vows forgotten and the burden placed on me to aid you from the marriage bed
That's when the promise of never became as embracing as strangulation
Your idea of forever, the grandest humiliation
Yet I never know how loosely you used the word friend
In time I learned
This I cannot forgive, but only you know the truth
Your secrets, they follow, and shadows always show the path to the fallen
The liars wielding daggers
Take your skin away, wield the liar's dagger
Because along this path are fragile whispers guiding me with guilt
And though they scream the faintest lies
They lead me to the knowledge that your words were chosen wisely
Disguised was all intent
Within the deceit, I know I heard you say...
For now, for forever; from the start, this was the deal
