She wants to grab her telephone, but she knows it ain't right
So if he don't call, she'll survive
So if he don't care, she'll get by
Climb into bed, bury her head, and cry
From the beginning he was all anyone could've been
They were delirious with love, they were certain to win
Now he's breaking plans more and more
And he's leaving notes on her door
Took a trip out of town, couldn't turn this one down
He said I guess I should have told you before
She says she feels like she's addicted to a real bad thing
Always sitting, waiting, wondering if the phone will ring
She knows she bounces like a yo-you when he pulls her string
It hurts to feel like such a fool
She wants to tell him not to call or come around again
He doesn't need her now at all, the way that she needs him
She's on the edge about to fall from leaning out and in
And she don't know which was to move oh no
She wants to be fair
She couldn't say he was ever unkind
But if she could bear to walk away, she thinks he wouldn't mind
Cause he just keeps himself so apart
And there's no one else in her heart
So she's taking a dive from an emotional high and coming down hard
