Fifty bucks ain't gonna cut it hoss
The tip jar didn't even cover the loss
From the gas to the motel much less get us home
My head's still throbbin' like a Waylon song
You fed us Pabst Blue Ribbon and a chili-dog
I guess a man's word ain't worth nothin' back where you're from

'Cause everybody got drunk and everybody got laid
They were singin' all the words to my songs
We played five long sets and everybody there stayed
Fork it over baby we'll be gone
But if you really want to try to jack my cash this way
I'll introduce you to my .38
You better give me my money or there'll be hell to pay

You turned the shop back on and the power blue
I had to duck a Shiner bottle some redneck threw
I sang Free Bird acapella while you tried to get the breaker back on
Some chick was gettin' crazy in the bathroom stall
I had to pee so bad I nearly lost it all
Naw, it ain't my fault you gotta wild ass honky tonk

'Cause everybody got drunk and everybody got stoned
They were yellin' all the words to my songs
They were jerry-riggin' lighters out of telephones
Still up and goin' when the kegs were gone
But if you really wanna try to jack my cash this way
You can tell it to my .38
You better give me my money or there'll be hell to pay
You might also like
Said my ears are still ringin 'cause my mic was hot (uh huh)
Head spinnin' from the Jager shots
And I done told y'all, I ain't goin' back to jail
But these here blisters on my fingers say the show straight rocked
Now they're grippin' on the trigger and the hammer's cocked
If I gotta get buck wild up in here I will

'Cause everybody got drunk and everybody got laid
They were yellin' all the words to my songs
We played five long sets and everybody there stayed
Fork it over baby we'll be gone
But if you really want to try to jack my cash this way
You'll be hearin' from my .38
You better give me my money or there'll be hell to pay
Yeah, you better give me my money or there'll be hell to pay
