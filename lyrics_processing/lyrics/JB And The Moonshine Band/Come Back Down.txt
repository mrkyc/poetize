I can't believe I heard you on my radio
Seem like yesterday, you were just like us
Fourpack deep in that Chevy full of freedom and gasoline
You were wide-eyed buzzed and hellbent to chase a dream
Yeah, always told you that you had it in you
And it broke our hearts whenever you left home
Half the town, they thought that you were crazy
Boy you went ahead and proved them wrong

Just the same old kid from Highway nine
Living too fast and getting too high
Blowing through stop signs
Shooting old drop ties
Chasing that one light breeze
Yeah you're blowing up fast and we all see
Exactly who we knew you'd be
Go fly but when you get too high
And your lost needs a little found

You can come back down off that high horse you rode in on
And listen to the sound of a whip-poor-will on that fence post
You still got the same last name
And boy nothing changed
You might also like
'Cause you're still the same old kid from Highway nine
That's living too fast and getting too high
Blowing through stop signs
Shooting old drop ties
Chasing that one light breeze
Now you're blowing up fast and we all see
Exactly who we knew you'd be
Boy fly but when you get too high
And your lost needs a little found
You can come back down
You can come back down

Boy o fly but if you get too high
And your lost needs a little found

You're still the same old kid from Highway nine
That's living too fast and getting too high
Blowing through stop signs
Shooting old drop ties
Chasing that one light breeze
Yeah you're blowing up fast and we all see
Exactly who we knew you'd be
Boy fly but when you get too high
And your lost needs a little found
You can come back down
You can come back down
Mhh, you can come back down
You can come back down
Baby come back down
You can come back
Yeah you better come back down
(Chasing that one light, chasing that one light)
Why you better come back down
We're gon' be right here
So come on back, come on back
Come on back down
The same old, same old kid from Highway nine
That's living too fast and getting too high
Don't get too high
If your lost needs a little, lost needs a little found
Oh come back down
Come on back, come on back
Come on back down
Oh you better come back down
