Well, it's Friday
The sun is shining
And it's damn near quittin' time
I'm just calling to see
If you're meeting me at your place or mine
We got nothin' to do for miles and miles
Babe, and everywhere in between
I'm gonna pick you up in my pickup truck
And honey, you and me
We're gonna split the scene

I said, hey baby, let's go for a ride
I've waited all week
And I'm ready
To take a trip on the wild side
Hey baby, let's go for a ride
So turn the music up
And let them windows down
Let's get the hell out of this town

This here highway is gettin' wider
Man, it's way too big for me
I'm fixin' to bust a left
Right up ahead
On County Road 243
I'm gonna go as slow
As the green grass grows
So you can take it all in
From the black top
To the red dirt
No it won't stop
'Til this back road ends

To take a trip on the wild side
Hey baby, let's go for a ride
So turn the music up
Let them windows down
Let's get the hell out of this town
Let's get the hell out of this town
Hey baby, let's go for a ride

And I'm ready
To take a trip on the wild side
Hey baby, let's go for a ride

And let them windows down

Hey baby, let's go for a ride

To take a trip on the wild side

Hey baby, let's go for a ride
So turn the music up
And let them windows down
Let's get the hell out of this town
Let's get the hell out of this town
Let's get the hell out of this town
Let's get the hell out of this town
Yeah, let's get the hell out of this town
