All he needs is food and water
A little shelter from the rain
He ain't the type that likes to argue
I never once heard him complain
He never asked me where I've been
She could learn a thing or two from him

I say come, he comes right here
He loves to go fetch my next beer
He rolls over, if I tell him to
There ain't a thing my dog won't do
Yeah, he likes my truck, he don't mind my gut
And he loves to hunt hogs
Why can't she, be more like my dog?

He knows when to keep his mouth shut
And both ears open wide
He don't ever sweat the small stuff
'Cause he's just glad to be alive
You could say he's my best friend
Why can't she be more like him?

I say come, he comes right here
He loves to go fetch my next beer
He rolls over, if I tell him to
There ain't a thing my dog won't do
Yeah, he likes my truck, he don't mind my gut
And he loves to hunt hogs
Why can't she, be more like my dog?
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

We don't no dialog
