I've got a case of Coke and a fifth of Jack
I've got my homies Flo and Dro and my boy GStack
We're 'bout to pour it up 'til we're throwin' up
We got the whole place rockin' like a ghetto trunk
I bend my elbow like a natural
I said if practice makes perfect then I done went pro
I don't mess around, man I go to town
And when I polish off the Jack, I bust the seal on the Crown
'Cause I'm down

Go on and order up a shot or three (Drink up)
Everybody get throwed with me (Get high)
You'll be flyin' in the sky so free
You know your feet won't ever touch the ground, 'cause I'm down
We ain't stoppin' 'til the lights come on (Then what?)
Afterparty's where it's goin' on (So what's up?)
Y'all don't make me do this thing alone
'Cause where I come from we don't mess around, I'm down

Crazy dreams 'cause I'm sippin' lean
I'm having visions like I'm livin' in a movie screen
I'm 'bout to catch a buzz, man I'm sippin' Bud
No, I don't sling dope, but man I will sling mud
So you can climb inside, man if you're down to ride
I got a shotgun and a rifle and a side-by-side
Man I'm a full blood hound, you can ask around
I'm the coolest mother- in this whole damn town
Cause I'm down

Afterparty's where it's goin' on (So what's up?)
Y'all don't make me do this thing alone
'Cause where I come from we don't mess around, I'm down

Down to stay up 'til I see the sun (I'm down)
Gettin' loaded like a Tommy gun (I'm down)
Down to roll one if you want me to (I'm down)
Yeah I'm down to take a hit or two (I'm down)
I'm down to do whatever man (I'm down)
'Bout to take you to the promised land (I'm down)
Yeah I'm down like an aeroplane (I'm down)
Man I'm telling y'all I'm down like rain
I'm down

Go on and order up a shot or three (Drink up)
Everybody get throwed with me (Get high)
You'll be flyin' in the sky so free
You know your feet won't ever touch the ground, 'cause I'm down
We ain't stoppin' 'til the lights come on (Then what?)
