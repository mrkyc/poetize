(Oh oh oh)
You got me wrapped around your finger you don't even know it
(Oh oh oh)
I could tell before you said hello oh
(Oh oh oh)
And now I'm running out of time and you still don't even know me
(Oh oh oh)
But I don't ever want to let you go oh oh
Verse 1:
Falling in love with the way this feels
Pinching myself every time you're near
All that I want is to make this real
But don't wake me up wake me up
Pre-Chorus:
It's like oh oh oh
Oh won't you come a little closer
(Oh oh oh)
And I'll show you what it is to feel
Chorus:
Hands in the air when we run these streets
Loving the way that you're looking at me
It's like oh oh oh oh
Let's never let go
Hands in the air I can make you see
All of the things you and I could be
Like oh oh oh oh
Let's never let this go

I can't deny when you walk in the room
You're turning the heads all eyes on you
I'd do anything to be the one that you choose
Do you feel it too feel it too
Pre-Chorus;
It's like oh oh oh
I think I'll get a little closer
(Oh oh oh)
Come on and just tell me that it's real
Chorus:
Hands in the air when we run these streets
Loving the way that you're looking at me
It's like oh oh oh oh
Let's never let go
Hands in the air I can make you see
All of the things you and I could be
Like oh oh oh oh
Let's never let this go
Bridge:
Now we're so wrapped up in each other
Soaking in the summer
Sunsets and sand between our toes oh
And I know that you and me together could stay like this forever
Because I'll never let you go
Outro:
Hands in the air when we run these streets
Loving the way that you're looking at me
It's like oh oh oh oh
Let's never let this go
Hands in the air I can make you see
All of the things you and I could be
Like oh oh oh oh
