Yeah I know there's a great big world outside this city (city, city, oh)
And a girl like you's gotta have some place to go (oh)
But maybe we could go somewhere
We could hope on a plane to Mexico
Oh baby we could be right there
And kick it first class together
Pre-Chorus:
Imma fake like a rockstar buy you a plane ticket that I know I can't afford
Oh baby we could be right there
Livin' first class forever
Chorus:
Cause we've got 25 minutes till your plane takes off
I'll buy a first class ticket to wherever you want
But by first class I mean coach class
I heard that money can't buy you love
You've got 25 minutes 'til this plane takes off!
Interlude:
(Attention passengers, flight 632 to Dallas will be delayed. We are sorry for the inconvenience.)
Verse 2:
Yeah I know that you think this whole might sound crazy (crazy, crazy, oh)
But a guy like me can't let a girl like you go, oh
So baby let's get out of here
I hear Rome is nice this time of year
Oh baby let's get out of here
(Come on, baby, let's get out of here.)

Cause we've got 25 minutes 'til your plane takes off
I'll buy a first class ticket to wherever you want
Cause we've got 25 minutes 'til your plane takes off
We'll live in luxury in Fiji just to soak in the sun
But by luxury we'll sleep on the beach
Cause I'm a baller on a budget baby
You've got 25 minutes 'til this plane takes off!
Verse 3:
Check, never in my mind did I expect her to turn around and hit me with a "yes"
Then we grabbed our bags and we hopped on that plane
First class livin', we were poppin' champagne
And by champagne, I should explain
It was sparkling cider but you know it looked the same
Now it's you and me sharing love across the globe
Anywhere you want say the word and we'll go
Miami, Tahiti, London, and Paris
French kiss in Italy cause we couldn't care less
Hawaii to Sydney as long as you're with me
We'll be livin' first class forever

Cause we've got 25 minutes 'til your plane takes off
I'll buy a first class ticket to wherever you want
But by first class I mean coach class
I heard that money can't buy you love
You've got 25 minutes 'til this plane takes off!
Cause we've got 25 minutes 'til your plane takes off
I'll buy a first class ticket to wherever you want
Cause we've got 25 minutes till your plane takes off
We'll live in luxury in Figi just to soak in the sun
But by luxury we'll sleep on the beach
Cause I'm a baller on a budget baby
You've got 25 minutes 'til this plane takes off!
