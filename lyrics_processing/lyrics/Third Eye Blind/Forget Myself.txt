Could you believe it? Those sapphire eyes
The brilliant girl with the famous thighs
Then the cameras click then we are stars
Laughing in the back of chauffeured cars
Phone call rings and your voice is desire
Then winter moves into summer fires
I promised you what's ours is ours
Somewhere backstage with Sean and Lars

I go crazy when you walk in the room
I laugh at myself with the girl in bloom
And the taste of sex couldn't be too soon
All afternoon then
LA parties in the phony lands
Phony grabs with the manicured hands
I always thought you were pretty like a whip
Should have watched my step

'Cause I keep on forgetting myself
And I keep on forgetting myself
I keep on forgetting myself
And I keep on forgetting myself
I keep on forgetting myself
And I keep on forgetting myself
Who am I? We both don't know
Time ticks by, where did you go?

You always knew where you were going to
So sweetly you said, please come with you
The biggest fear running through my head
You said you loved me, you know what you said
I was floating, did it go to my head?
We always sleep with the dogs on the bed
LA parties and the vodka fizz
This is not my life or maybe it is

I keep on forgetting myself
And I keep on forgetting myself
I keep on forgetting myself
And I keep on forgetting myself
I keep on forgetting myself
Who am I? We both don't know
Time ticks by, where did you go?

Oh, I made you doubt me
Oh I, you're better off without me

Think I am looking over your shoulder
'Cause there's someone younger and you're feeling older
You're crazy and you never faded
I don't want to be so complicated
See my life come undone
Watch it go and let the damage run
And I'd change the song now if I could
In the slickness of your blood
Yo, yo, this ain't the end, this ain't the end

I keep on forgetting myself
And I keep on forgetting myself
I keep on forgetting myself
And I keep on forgetting myself (Where did you go?)
I keep on forgetting myself
And I keep on forgetting myself

Who's that guy? I don't know, woah woah woah
Where did you go?
Where did you go now?
Where did you go?
Where did you go now?
