People's eyes say I'm no damn good
Shook down and left lonely
Only with the "maybe we could"
I stay inside 'cause I'm misunderstood
I can't get no release
I'm shell-shocked from some heavy blows
A stranger to the people I know
Who used to say, "He never had a down day"
Now I'm holding on to can't-let-go's
And silence brings no peace

Because another life
Went through my window pane
And I don't know why
I've got a will to burn

In attic rooms I just shut my door
For seven weeks or maybe seven more
It's like I face a seven-headed whore
The fight's knocked out of me
There's no measure for grief and I can't find it with the sound
Break down, the great god of the hand-me-down
Holding the past around, wind up at the lost-and-found
The colors all turn to gray (Wait a minute and)
I'm coming back from a down day, colorized
The city plays a double feature today
The life is long and something is wrong
But I want to know what's going on and on

In another life
'Cause it's good again
And it will never die
I've got a will to burn
To see you again
It's like another life
It's like I'll not get better
Will to burn

Time goes by and I realize that I'm all right
You thought nothing would be the same
But life comes 'round again
Quick wits and all curious
All caught up in what you say
And makes me grab the time
Before it slips away
I can't stay and I cannot wait
And I'm grateful to whistle past a graveyard gate
The flicker fade is getting stronger
When the days start getting longer
I got the rhythm down now in the places we warred
The Golden Gate is like my diving board
And life is pointless
But what's so wrong with that?
'Cause there's another life
And it's sweeter pain
And we will never die
We got a will to burn
To see you again
It's like another life
I feel the whole thing happen
The will to burn
To see you again
It's like another life
I got another life
