Here's my dilemma
You're throwing a kink in my telemetry
I'm a fast pass
I'm a grass stain on your ass, and I'm worth it
She just went through a breakup
She's fragile, and injured, and she's mean as fuck
Still moving like a dolphin under me
Sometimes I go so hard that my bones sing
And my bones sing (Yeah!)

And I wanna know
Can you hear this voice inside of me?
And I wanna know
Can you hear this voice inside?
Fogging up the glass
Pull it 'til we're cash
I'll make you think the past was worth it, oh
Did you die alone, die alone, no
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I'm not a prop gun
Shoot off my mouth
Not a mystery
I'm not your hideaway dope
I'm not your whip
I'm a punk rock motherfucker
With some dirty, dirty armor
It starts with you and me now
Your Tropic Scorpio, ignite the way
You got me so spun, I'm vu ja de
Still moving like the dolphin under me
Sometimes I go so hard that my bones sing

In my telemetry, you're the down low
I'm a killer now, killin' your ghost
And you're a moment covered in gold
You're covered in gold

And I wanna know
Can you hear this voice inside of me?
And I wanna know

Fogging up the glass
