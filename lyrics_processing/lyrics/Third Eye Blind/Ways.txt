Well the truth is I'm just glad I'm here
You don't know who that is
But I'm headed for the legends
Trying to to land that trick
Prop up, yeah that's my shit
Talkin' ya' claim that cake
Now let me see you talk shit (So)

You always call me dude
You never call me by my name
A California rude boy
Headed for the legends

It's just a waste
When the days run together, I'll run away
Ooh (It's just a ways)
Maybe you'd be fun to play with
It's just a waste
Where'd you get the suede suit? talk to me
Ooh
Maybe you'd be fun to play with

And this town of rainbows
Sneaking into Outside Lands (Bro)
And I'll stomping through the mud
I'm all options and no plans
Princess in the wedding
Titties and the bellies
What would they want with me?
Since I'm the first motherfucker to the cheese
And I'm so eager to please
