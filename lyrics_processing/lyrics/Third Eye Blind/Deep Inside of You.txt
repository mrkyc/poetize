When we met light was shed
Thoughts free flow, you said you've got something
Deep inside of you
A wind chime voice sound, sway of your hips round rings true
It goes deep inside of you
These secret garden beams, changed my life so it seems
Fall breeze blows outside, I don't break stride
My thoughts are warm
And they go deep inside of you

And I never felt alone
'Til I met you

Friends say I've changed, I don't listen 'cause I live to be
Deep inside of you
Slide of her dress, shouts in darkness, I'm so alive
I'm deep inside of you
You said boy make girl feel good
But still, deep inside, still

I've never felt alone
'Til I met you
I'm all right on my own
And then I met you
And I'd know what to do if I just knew what's coming

I would change myself if I could
I'd walk with my people if I could find them
And I'd say that I'm sorry to you
I'm sorry to you
And I don't want to call you
But then I want to call you 'cause I don't want to crush you
But I feel like crushing you
And it's true I took for granted you were with me
I breathe by your looks and you look right through me
And we were broke and didn't know
And we were broke and didn't know
And we were broke and didn't know

Something's gone, you withdraw and I'm not strong like before I was
Deep inside of you
I can go nowhere
I burn candles and stare at a ghost
Deep inside of you
And some great need in me ... starts to bleed
I've lost myself there's nothing left, it's all gone

Deep inside of you
Deep inside of you
