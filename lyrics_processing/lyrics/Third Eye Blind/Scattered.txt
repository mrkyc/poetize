When the dragonflies float on
And little kids go chasing them
'Til nighttime comes along
And the prophet of a discontent is gone
And the Devil smiles as he pulls the wings off
At the one who wrote and forgot the song
Well, it's not my fault what you did
And it's not my fault we're young and stupid
Still, I'm stuck in this nightmare joke
No company, my strings are broke
So I go out looking for the right one
A nice, fat girl with a tight one

'Cause I, I, I always laugh when I'm hurting

When I was punk, I was way more punk than you
What happened to our little tribe?
On a tombstone, it inscribed
And I, I didn't know my friends would leave me too
And when I sold out, I thought my lies out through and through

'Cause I, I, oh I always laugh when I'm hurting

Is anyone sick of being nervous and annoyed?
Don't play with pens to fill the void
And I'm paranoid
And the legacy we become, though
To the hard rock and see the shotgun
With your burger bleeding on the plate
I'm holding out for a different fate

No one's fooling anyone
Everyone struggles inside
And everyone has lied
Fooling anyone, no one is fooling anyone, yeah
No one is fooling anyone
No one is fooling anyone

Turn the music up louder
Spit out the taste of gun powder, and
We'll have a bonfire
Burn it all down, let's take it higher
Got to find me a woman who makes my soul feel thick
Well, she said, "Love, I won't feel sick"
When you say, "How you doing?"
We'll say, "We are fine," yeah
I'm fine, I am fine
'Cause I, I, I always laugh when I'm hurting
