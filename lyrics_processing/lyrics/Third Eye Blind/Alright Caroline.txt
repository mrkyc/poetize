Tell the truth, woman, just this time
I know you can do it
Your baby's eyes look just like mine
We can both see through it
Tell the truth, woman, just this time
I didn't know how much you
Would take from me

When you teach this little girl to walk
Her laughter will be mine
There's a price to pay
For a safe place to hide
Tell me are you warm inside
Tell the truth, woman, just this time
It seems that things could've been different
But I can't change it

So alright Caroline
I won't take nothing from you
Alright Caroline
I won't even tell the truth
And I'm right

But we could both see through it
Tell the truth, woman, just this time
For both of us
Both of us
Both of us

So alright Caroline
I won't take nothing from you
And alright Caroline
I won't even tell the truth
And I'm right

Time moves faster today
But let's not speak of this
Some things you cannot mend, yeah
And I'm watching her sleep
She's beautiful
And you tell me that I won't be seeing you again
You didn't even ask me
If it was alright
If it was alright
If it was alright
If it was alright
I never claimed to understand you
But I feel you
I feel you
I never claimed to understand you
But I feel you
I feel you
It's gonna take a long time
To grow young again, yeah, I know
