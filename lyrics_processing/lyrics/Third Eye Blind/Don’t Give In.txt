I'm on the side of everyone
Who wants to stay alive, mhmm
Let's go for a ride on my motorbike, I can't hear a thing
I know what you're saying, "Don't give in"
Say it now like a friend: "Don't give in."

And I'll tell you one thing that I'm not
I don't think that I'm right 'cause I didn't get caught
Tell me now where you've been, don't give in
And the thing that's killing me
Is a vision of life how it's supposed to be
Without each other we're nothin', don't give in

'Cause when the sun roof-top
It pulls down
I am right by your side

It doesn't work for you then don't do it
Feel yourself again
It doesn't work for you then don't do it
Don't live your life pretend
Oh, it's nice to meet you, oh

Let's go bare knuckle this season
If you lose your heart, then you'd lose your reason
A swashbuckle wearin' thin, don't give in
What do you want me to do?
Spend my brightness burning for you?
Without each other we're nothin', don't give in

It doesn't work for you then don't do it
Feel yourself again
It doesn't work for you then don't do it
Don't live your life pretend
Oh, it's nice to meet you
Oh, it's nice to meet you, oh

It's nice to meet you
It doesn't work for you then don't do it
Feel yourself again
It doesn't work for you then don't do it
Don't live your life pretend
Oh, it's nice to meet you
Oh, it's nice to meet you
Oh, it's nice to meet you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh
I'm on the side of everyone
Who wants to stay alive
Don't give in
Say it now like a friend
Don't give in
I love you more than anything
Don't give in
Don't give in
