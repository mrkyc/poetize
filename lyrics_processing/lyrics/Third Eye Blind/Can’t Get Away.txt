Ba ba baba, ba ba baba
Ba ba baba, ba ba baba
Ba ba baba, ba ba baba
Ba ba baba, ba ba baba

I miss the sand on the concrete floor
I miss the way it was before
No one even knew me
Your eyes looked right through me
And I'm taking off your clothes
And you bloom like a rose

I can't get away from you
I can't get away from you
Ba ba baba, ba ba baba
Ba ba baba, ba ba baba
Ba ba baba, ba ba baba
Ba ba baba, ba ba baba

And where the ocean meets the land
Is like the sliding of your hand
Prickles up my skin
And I can feel the changing weather
While alone along that coast
Sense memories of your ghost

I can't get away from you
I can't get away from you
Ah ah

Deliver me
(One thing cuts me in)
(One thing trips me up)
Shut me up
(One thing trips me up)
(One thing, won't give it up and)
Deliver me
(One thing close to me and)
(One thing trips me up and)
(One thing reminded me and)
(I go walk alone and)
Deliver me
(One thing, won't be leasing)
Deliver me
(One thing, won't get me peace and)
Deliver me
(One thing, won't let me go and)
(Nowhere, I can't go home and)
Deliver me

Ba ba baba, ba ba baba
Ba ba baba, ba ba baba

Through the airport corridors
In magazines in stores
If I see your face once more
'Cause you know I can't ignore it
I recognize that pose
When you bloomed like a rose

I can't get away from you
I can't get away from you
I can't get away from you
I can't get away from you
I can't get away

The Jeep gets broken on a blown out road
And I'm a tourist with a real light load
And will the government hold another month away?
Messed up places where we always stay (I can't get away from you)
Funny how we always pick these spots
Feeling like a have in the land of have-nots, sleeping on cots
Wishing that I had some tater-tots
And there's postcards written I know I'll never send
The moment is gone and won't come again
I ride with souls who find no peace
Still I look to you to find release
Find release, find release (I can't get away from you)
I watch the travelers return through the panic doors (I can't get away from you)
Walking through the airport corridors (I can't get away from you)
Welcome back now from foreign shores
And I walk alone and the ghost that I carry is yours
Tiger sharks in your eyes are blue
The vision that we had will all returns to you, returns to you, returns to you
