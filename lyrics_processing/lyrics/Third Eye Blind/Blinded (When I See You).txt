Just an old friend coming over
Now to visit you and
That's what I've become
I let myself in
Though I know I'm not supposed to but
I never know when I'm done
And I see you fogging up the mirror
Vapor around your body glistens in the shower
And I want to stay right here
And go down on you for an hour
And stay and let the day just fade away in wild dedication
Take the moment of hope and let it run
And never look back at all the damage we have done now
To each other, to each other, to each other

But when I see you
It's like I'm staring down the sun
And I'm blinded
There's nothing left to do
And still I see you

I never believe that things would happen for a reason and
They never go as planned
I wanted to thank you for a vision that was lost that you returned
But you're past where you understand
Now her appetite is blown
Little else is known
'Cept she's a little angry
Grabs a towel, looks away
The heat fades with the day
And I fall down on what to say
Oh something clean, let me be clever
Hey oh well, whatever
But that's not what I mean
Where we've been has left us burnt still
I won't turn now from a fight
You know I'll never win

So when I see you
You know all the things I've done
But I'm blinded
Like I'm staring down the sun
When I see you
When I see you
When I see you
It's like I'm staring down the sun, yeah

Hey! I'm blinded!
Hey! I'm blinded!
Hey! I'm blinded!

Time it passes and it tells us what we're left with
We become the things we do
Me, I'm a fool spent from defiance, yeah you got me but
I didn't give up on you
Icarus is not a T-shirt or a swan song, no
He is born again and
It's not easy being me
When I can't promise I will mend
Or bend when you believe
That we are fixed now from our birth
And I've just fallen back to Earth
Still you know I'll try again
'Cause I believe that we are lucky
We are golden, we have stolen
Manners in the days when we were one
So when I see you
In spite of all that we've become
I'm still blinded
But I'm still staring down the sun
When I see you
When I see you
When I see you
When I see you

Oh yeah!
I'm still staring down the sun
Oh yeah!
I'm still staring down the sun
Oh yeah!
I'm still staring down the sun
I'm blinded!
When I see you
When I see you
