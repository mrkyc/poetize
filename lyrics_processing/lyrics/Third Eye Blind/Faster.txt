Horny and burned out now
Is how it always ends for me and
Chemicals wear me down
In your summertime bacchanalian
I saw you go faster than the morning comes
She walks away like a lady
It's always the fallen ones
I think are always gonna save me
I saw you go faster

Whoa, I wanna get off one time and not apologize
Woah, you gotta steal the time of a life that's passing by

In bed she flexes her knees
To try and abate the feeling
She mouths the words "Oh please"
To the poster on the ceiling
I saw you go faster right in front of me
She stares at him so madly
She's got the nerve to say
She wants to fuck that boy so badly
I saw you go faster

Whoa, I wanna get off one time and not apologize
Whoa, you gotta steal the time of a life that's passing by
Whoa, I wanna get off one time and look you in the eyes
Whoa, I wanna get off one time, get off one time

I was hoping you would be waiting there for me lately
I was hoping you'd be waiting for me
I was hoping you'd be waiting there for me lately
I was hoping you would be waiting there for me
I was hoping you would be waiting there for me lately
But you're not the kind who would be waiting
Not for anybody
You're not the kind who would be waiting not for anybody
Not even me
Ooh, just one time
Ooh, I could go off right now
Whoa, I wanna get off

Whoa, I wanna get off one time and not apologize
Whoa, You gotta steal the time of a life that's passing by
