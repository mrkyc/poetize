Planning my attack just before you come back around
Maybe I'm wrong, but I don't know how to back down
I never fit in, I don't belong
But you know it doesn't matter when we're feeling strong
'Cause I'm a vampire y'all
And we toast the blood of our enemies
You're still scaring me no, you're scaring me no
And we don't fit in
Don't fit in

Wonder what it's like when you're living with someone like me
I'm a freak and I'm nervous when it's easy
Feral days, and I'm sex crazed
I put it in with my animal ways and
That's the sign I was born to be living in
I ran around and gave the finger to the Ritalin
You can calm me down, I can't say why
You say goodbye, you burn my eyes
You burn my eyes

A thousand Julys
I hope you'll find I'd give you the words, but no words come to mind
But you turn me so cold, so I tell you lies
When you let me in, it's like a thousand Julys

When you left for good, I felt the drop like a boom
Wintertime all alone in your bedroom
I don't blame you, and I know I'm not your friend
How we living? Young American
I guess I've always known
I'd be on my own (I'd be on my own)
And I don't know why, I don't know why (I don't know why)

A thousand Julys, I know you'll find
And I'd say the words, but no words come to mind
But you let me in, and I don't know why
When you cum, it's like a thousand Julys


A thousand Julys
That's what you are
And I'd tell you to come back now, but we've gone to far
And we've burned it out now
I don't even try
But I feel you gone
I've lost a thousand Julys
You save oceans, baby
You save oceans, baby
You save oceans, baby
