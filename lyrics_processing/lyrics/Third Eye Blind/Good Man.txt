If you ever find a way to forgive me
If you ever find a way to put this all to rest
Because I'm hanging on your dress now like a little boy

When all that you wanted, all that you wanted
Was a good man, all right
Right in the middle of another big fight
Boom back, another one tonight
Blood never forgets but who protects
The memories when we bleed each other from the vein?

And if you ever find a way to make this interesting
If I ever find a way to stop disintegrating
Into pieces that I was that you destroy

When all that you wanted, all that you wanted
Was a good man, all right
Right in the middle of another big fight
Go to bed it's getting light out
Why do you, why do you, why do you
Always find me in the places when I'm coming down?

And how do you do it when I'm overwhelmed by a violet sky?
And we fly in a decayed orbit 66,000 miles an hour goes by
When we kissed and only now do I feel your mouth
Like an ache you never knew
And it was right in front of you
Oh how do you do it? Roots in the soil untangled
Releasing in sweet summer oil, still I recoil like mace
In all the little moments I pushed you away that I can't erase
Every moment overflows with power, 66,000 miles an hour

And if you ever find a way to forgive me
If you ever find a way to put this all to rest
Because I am hanging on your dress now like a little boy

When all that you wanted, all that you wanted
Was a good man, all right
And all that you wanted, all that you wanted
Was a good man

Was a good man
Was a good man
Was a good man
Was a good man
Was a good man
