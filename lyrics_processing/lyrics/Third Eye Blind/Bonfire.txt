Whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh

A little early in spring, a bonfire ring, she's shiverin' alone
I bumped into you somehow
And you could wear
My duct-taped vest, it's a party best, it's really all I own
Everything's changing now
And I am high like a star that's flying, Cassiopeia
Everything's changin' now

She said it's alright
She said no don't die alone
There's no goodbyes

Lightning comes and lightning goes
And it's all the same to me, let it in
'Cause I want you so
I can hardly breathe or release
Into one thousand pieces
I have broke into, over you
That shame will soon be gone
But I keep burnin' on and on and on

If nothing else I am myself, it's all I have to give
Everything's changin' now
Or we could live like kings if we take a risk or we could live in doubt
Everything's changin' now, oh now, c'mon, c'mon

Lightning comes and lightning goes
And it's all the same to me, let it in
'Cause I want you so
I can hardly breathe or release
Into one thousand pieces
I have broke into, over you
That shame will soon be gone
And I keep burnin' on and on and on

And this, this is, this is the last time (Whoaaa)
This, this is, this is your goodbye (Whoaaa)
This, this is, this is the last time (Whoaaa)
But this, this is, this is your goodbye
(Whoa-oh-oh-oh)

Well, some girls will break you now just to see you come undone
Everything's changin' now
Maybe you and I are cursed, maybe you and I are one
But that's the universe, around, around, can't change it
Lightning comes and lightning goes
It's all the same to me, and let it in
'Cause I want you so
I can hardly breathe or release
Into one thousand pieces
I have broke into, over you
The flames will soon be gone
But I keep burnin' on and on and on

Did you get what you wanted?
Did you get what you wanted, oh?
