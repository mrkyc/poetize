This dumb jam didn't mean a thing
Ecstasy, rave is king
Fake diamonds shinin' on her finger
And I'm bad for you, for you
You stole my soul, or I gave it to you

(I wish I was a spray can...)
Hey where did everybody go?
Everyone I know has blown the coast and
Shiver in the wind, it shows
All I have are summer clothes and
Oh, it brings me down
When it's winter time in a summer town and
It's winter time in a summer town and

All we are are friends we keep or lose in time
Fade away, the precious ones we keep in mind
I wonder now if I'm the one that you'd leave behind

'Cause after Halloween everything starts fadin'
I'm losing everyone, I go down like the sun
You know what I mean
I'm just someone in a summer town
See Third Eye Blind LiveGet tickets as low as $15You might also like
Standin' by the old beach house
Where we stood outside, sang out loud and
And I will shiver like a ghost
I remember the time that we drew a crowd and

I told you everything I knew in the manic rushing line
I wonder now if I'm the kind that you left behind

'Cause after Halloween everything starts fadin'
I'm losing everyone, I go down like the sun
You know what I mean
My whole life is a summer town

You get into the people you met
And the moment comes that you can't forget and
Some flies in trajectory
Did you give me more than you took from me and
I'm as empty now as a vacant sign, like tonight

After Halloween can we stay together?
Like I'm losin' everyone and I come undone
But nothin' lasts forever, the last summer is done
Can we find another one? Find another one
No, no, no, no, yeah!
Hey where'd everybody go?
Everyone I know has blown the coast and
All we are is holdin' on
But we're lettin' it go, we're lettin' it go, we're lettin' it
All we are are friends we keep
When we lose them all it's bittersweet and
I realize we'll always be in a summer town

I wish I was a spray can
To write my name on the world and
I wish I was a megaphone with my speaker blown
To get myself known in a summer town
I smell sun block on her hot skin
In the bungalow before the day begins
This is some dumb jam, it didn't mean a thing
Ecstasy, rave is king
Fake diamonds shinin' on her finger
I'm bad for you as anyone you ever knew
Still you stole my soul, or I gave it to you
Yeah, you stole my soul, or I gave it to you
Get high and do the five five deal
Rock a fanny pack now from the front
She's generous with the bumps of the fake cocaine
It was funny once then, now it's funny again
And I was never able to reach her
No, no
Next leap of the creature, maybe then, maybe then
Summer dies and then you go away
Wanna be hustler school M.I.A. 
Make a paper plane then you fly away
Make a paper plane then you fly away
Fly away
We can fly away
Once a super secret your stupid fuckin' pocket
Where I left my bungalow keys
How am I always waking up in places like these?
Who's been singin' all my symphonies?
Rap bastards palliate my infamies
You'll be beggin', burnin', please
Back to the champ in the little sun dress
She was reading Nabokov, Miller, and Tess
And undressed so fine just as you are
A stone cold rap superstar
And I was never able to reach her
