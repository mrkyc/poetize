At a night time washstand you were staring me down
You had me so embarrassed
And this restaurant crowd is oh, so loud
Your face had been crying
You were ravaged by jealousy
You said, "look what love has done to me"
We can slip out the back right now if you want to save me

Cause I know, you know, I know, you want me
You start to haunt me I feel that danger
You like holding on to the company of strangers

She said promise not to kill me and maybe I will let you in
Her apartment's cold as a mace can
She said I just want to get it I don't need to understand
I said show me your true face
And she said "I'd rather wear a blindfold"
Truth be told I want a robot
A robot heart is all I want

If you're the one who knows me best
So tell me why
Why do I feel so, so, so, so, so, so depressed
I want to live a life of danger

In your eyes what you see
Is what you want me to be
So that's what I will be
What you want me to be
That's what I will be
What you want me to be

Fuck, Fuck, Fuck-a
Fuck away the emptiness
Until you get caught
In the loving arms of a robot
A robot heart is all you got

But you're the one who knows me best
Tell me why
Why do I feel so, so, so, so, so, second best
I wanna live a life of danger
