I drove the coast just to see you
Why'd you take so long?
And I get that you know that I miss you
And I, I know something's wrong

And I'm caught in these days
At least I hope it's a phase
And I go and I just play along
And the boys that she plays
Those bowlers and the berets
I know something is wrong
I know something is wrong

And then you speak to me
And everything is easy
Like I get what I wanted
Now I'm just haunted by you constantly
And everything is easy
Til she leaves you alone
And then you're soaked to the bone
You'll be sore
Come make it easy some more

Go ahead, take my heart out
Roll it up like a joint
Smoke me out till the feeling gets cashed
When you look in my face
It's like you forget the point

And then you speak to me
And everything is easy
Like I get what I wanted
Now I'm just haunted by you constantly
And everything is easy
Til she leaves you alone
And then you're soaked to the bone
You'll be sore
Come make it easy some more

You're gonna be so
So so so, so so, ooh
You're gonna be so
So so so, so so, oh
La la la la, be so lonely now
Da da da da, be so lonely now
If you wanna see me
You know I'm easily found
Just climb the stairs where we used to live
Wrap your fist 'round my heart
Yeah you know how to pound, pound, pound

Now I'm just haunted by you constantly
And everything gets easy
Till she leaves you alone
And then you're soaked to the bone
You'll be sore
Sore, sore, sore, sore, sore
Come make it easy some more
