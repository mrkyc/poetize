Since a youngin i was bugging
14 when i really started thugging
We was struggling - Granny told me
And my wodie Lil East put me on like it was nothing - Free a real nigga
Hitting licks with my brothers
Niggas swore they'd never switch like the others
Then turned around and did the same thang as every muthafucka in my life
Now it's Trife - Run for cover
I ain't never wanna be a gangsta
Shooting for safety praying God would save my sanity
All that i wanted to be was a rapper
But with success comes vanity
Gotta thank The Lord for the blessings he been sending me
Sickest when i kick it - Hope they never find a remedy
Mind a lethal weapon that's progressing off my memories
And every single session like a lesson to my enemies...

Though shall not fuck with me
Though shall not fuck with me
Though shall not fuck with me - No
Though shall not fuck with me - No No....

Chris crib sleeping on the floor - Nigga starving
Oodles of the noodles or the Chef Boyardee
Working on the flow while these other niggas party
Now watch a nigga land like Marty
Ahead of my time
Take em back to the future
Better with time
Gotta shine - Word to Supa
Nova - Feel like Hova with the gold teeth hustling
And what i tell the police - Nothing
Ain't about the bread - What the fuck is we discussing ?
I ain't never scared 'cuz i know these bitches bluffing
Tryna give me head but i fight temptation
Though it might feel amazing i can not be Ruffin
I'm more focused than i ever been
Tryna take it places i ain't ever been
Real niggas stand tall - They don't ever bend
City cold so I'm sippin on medicine
I got the juice - Think I'm Bishop
I treat my boo like a Swisher
First i undress her
Next ima lick her
I stuff her & hit her until I'm done with her
Overgrinding everyday'll get you paid week to week
Sick of selling Mary J - Millions what i seek to reach
High school - Gucci bag with the O's in it
No books and an extra set of clothes in it
I'm 21 now - A nigga goals different
They better run now - A nigga soul in it
Me & Bugz in the Charger with a rich nigga daughter tryna take it even farther - boy we gone get it...
