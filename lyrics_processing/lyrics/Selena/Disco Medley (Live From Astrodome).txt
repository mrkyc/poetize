How ya doin' Houston, Texas


At first I was afraid, I was petrified
Kept thinkin' I could never live without you by my side
But then I spent so many nights just thinkin' how you did me wrong
And I grew strong and I learned how to get along

And now you're back, from outer space
Don't turn around
'Cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye?
Did you think I'd crumble?
Did you think I'd lay down and die?

Go on now, go, walk out the door
Don't turn around now, 'cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye?
You think I'd crumble, you think I'd lay down and die

Oh no, not I, I will survive
Oh, as long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive
I've got all my life to live, I've got all my love to give
I will survive, I will survive, hey, hey

Talk about it, talk about it
Talk about it, talk about it
Talk about, talk about, talk about movin'
Gotta move on
Gotta move on
Gotta move on

Won't you take me to Funkytown?
Won't you take me to Funkytown?
Won't you take me to Funkytown?
Won't you take me to Funkytown?

Let me hear you Houston, Texas, Mexico!


Last dance
The last chance for love
Yes, it's my last chance
For romance tonight
Woah-oh
I need you by me
Beside me to guide me
To hold me, to scold me
'Cause when I'm bad, I'm so, so bad

So let's dance the last dance
So let's dance the last dance
So let's dance the last dance tonight

Let's dance
A last dance for love, yeah
Yes, it's my last chance
For romance tonight

Woah-oh
I need you by me
Beside me to guide me
To hold me to scold me
'Cause when I'm bad
I'm so so bad
So let's dance the last dance
So let's dance the last dance
So let's dance the last dance tonight

Do the hustle, woo


Someone found the letter you wrote me on the radio
And it said exactly how you felt
It must have fallen out of a hole in your old brown overcoat
It never said your name, but I knew who they meant
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh
I was so surprised and shocked and I wondered too
If by chance you heard it for yourself
I never told a soul just how I've been feeling over you
But they said it really loud, they said it on the air

On the radio, woah-oh-oh-oh
On the radio, woah-oh-oh-oh
On the radio, woah-oh-oh-oh
On the radio, woah-oh-oh
