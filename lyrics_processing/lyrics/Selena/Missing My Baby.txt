You're always on my mind, (Day and night) day and night
When I think of you, boy, everything feels so right
Well, I often think of the happy times we spent together
And I just can't wait to tell you that I love you
Time keeps passing by, (You're not here) you're not here
I feel so all alone when I don't have you near
But I often think of the happy times we spent together
And I just can't wait (Just can't wait) to tell you that I love you

I'm missing my baby, woah (Missing my baby)
I'm missing my baby
I gotta hold you tight and never let you out of my sight
Missing my baby, woah (Missing my baby)
I'm missing my baby
I gotta feel your heart beat next to mine
Gotta feel it

Time keeps passing by, (You're not here) you're not here
I feel so all alone when I don't have you near
But I often think of the happy times we spent together
And I just can't wait (Just can't wait) to tell you that I love you

I'm missing my baby (Missing my baby)
I'm missing my baby
I gotta hold you tight and never let you out of my sight
Missing my baby, woah (Missing my baby)
I'm missing my baby
I gotta feel your heart beat next to mine
You might also like
Sometimes at night when I go to sleep
I hold my pillow tight thinking of you 'til it hurts
But in my mind, I know you're mine
And somewhere you're thinking of me too
Gotta have you, (Have you) gotta hold you (Hold you)
Got to have your lovin' (I gotta have you)
And tell you that I love you and I really miss you

Oh, I'm missing my baby, woah (Missing my baby)
I'm missing my baby
I gotta have you near, right here by my side
I'm missing my baby, woo-hoo (Missing my baby)
I'm missing my baby
I gotta hold you tight and never let you out of my sight
Missing my baby, woah (Missing my baby)
I'm missing my baby
