My captive heart (My captive heart)
My willing soul (My willing soul)
My captive heart (My captive heart)
My willing soul (My willing soul)

I see him walking
I sense the danger
I hear his voice and my heart stops
He wears a face of the night
Ooh, the perfect stranger
And I'm falling, ready or not

I don't think about it
Who knows where the wind blows? (Ooh)
No doubt about it
I'll go where he goes

My captive heart
He holds the key to these emotions
My willing soul
Let me drown in this ocean
And I carry the flame
And I play my part
As long as he's calling, calling
My captive heart
My captive heart (My captive heart)
You might also like
Fire burns
So I've been told
But I like the way it feels
He has a wild passion that drives away the cold
And I know (And I know)
His touch is real

I don't think about it
He leads and I follow, oh
No doubt about it
I'll go where he goes

My captive heart
He holds the key to these emotions
My willing soul
Let me drown in this ocean
And I carry the flame
Like I did from the start
As long as he's calling, calling
My captive heart
Ooh
Ah-oh, yeah
Ah-alright
Don't think about it
Who knows where the wind blows?
Oh, no, no
No doubt about it
I'll go where he goes

My love
He holds the key to these emotions
Let me drown in this ocean
And I play my part
As long as he's calling, calling
My willing soul

My captive heart
He holds the key to these emotions
My willing soul
Let me drown in this ocean
And I carry the flame
And I play my part
As long as he's calling, calling
My captive heart

(My captive heart)
Set me free
He holds the key to these emotions
(My willing soul)
Set me free
Let me drown in this ocean
Let me drown in this ocean
And I play my part
I said let me free, yeah
My captive heart
My captive heart
My willing soul
