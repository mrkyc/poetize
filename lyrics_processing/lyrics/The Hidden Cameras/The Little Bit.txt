A little bit of heaven and a little bit of hell
We could start a family, being what we used to be
A little bit of tenderness a little bit of tough
Am I to blame for the advent of pain, dear?
A little bit of amity a little bit of lust
L'll suck the venom from your skin but you won't let me in
A little bit of spittle and a little bit of blood
The little bit from each we mix it may be taking on
But the little bit that doesn't is the bit I need the most
Why am I the only one to do anything about it?
A little bit of tumbling a little bit of a thud
I'm feeling for a pulse, but the skin has gone all cold
A little bil of tragedy a little bit of trumpet
I ain't a doctor or a medic but l'll make an operatic of it
A little bii of trebling a little bit of trill
You're getting older and l'm getting older yet
Use me, pull me anywhefe you please
It's the flicker of a grin that brings me back to you again
A little bit of levity a little bit of trouble
Lf I look away will it slowly slip into nothing
A little bit of air a little bit of mud
The little bit, you giving it, it may not be enough but
The little bit you holding it, it keeps me hanging on
I fill my belly everyday just to keep my beat going
A little bit of "in" and a little bit of "out"
Lf I ain't the enemy then whq am I anyway
A little bit of heaven and a I'ttle bit of hell
The little bit I have to give, I give it all up
