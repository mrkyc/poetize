The man that I am with my man
His warm coals heat toes
A shower cleans the surface and holes
Water, soap and hands
I sit while he stands
Over me I can hardly see
That he is peeing on my shoulders and knees
A warm, wet, yellow breeze
He towels my head until dry
And leads me to his bed opened wide
For my penis, nose, fingers and feet
Body worn and set for sleep

Taking out my hand
He lifts me up and we both stand
We could be in the army or the Klan
'Cause when we're brothers in blood then we are brothers in band

Solid is the rock of my man
Solid is the rock of my man
Solid is the rock of my man

The man that I am with my man
Tamed but feeling no blame
Taking my red wishes in hand
Until my eyes have closed
The man that I am with my man
Pulled, poked and probed
His tongue licks my armpits and chest
Warm, red, salt and wet
Making a cut with a knife on my hand
Then he uses his tongue, licks, swallows and grins
On my knees I do the same to my man
Blood juices loosen me up, in me I feel man in man
You might also like
Taking out my hand
He lifts me up and pets my head
We could be in the army or the Klan
'Cause when we're brothers in blood then we are brothers in band

Solid is the rock of my man
Solid is the rock of my man
Solid is the rock of my man

The men, they are men with their men
Raised in an army camp
They spit on my tarnished hands
And pull at my underpants
I'll be the man who I am with my man
Dressed in borrowed clothes
He softens my deep blues with his thighs
The fear of ocean underside

Taking out their hands
He lifts me up and we all stand
We could be in the army or the Klan
'Cause when we're brothers in blood then we are brothers in band
Taking out his hand
He lifts me up and we both stand
We could be in the army or the Klan
