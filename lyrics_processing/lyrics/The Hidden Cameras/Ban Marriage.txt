Stayed up too late the night before from fingering foreign dirty holes in the dark
The morning sun blinded my eyes and made my skin look pale and tainted in light
And there were steps to climb as I unloosened my tie
As I began to walk the aisle the congregation looked behind
But I continued past the pews and met my angel in a suit with a smile
As I looked him in the eye, I heard my best friend cry
We aren't fools to fall in love but let coupledom die

The minister was drunk and high from his rewrite of holy verse with more lies
But the organist she played with a tenacity and grace that was fine
The whole room was filled with the thunder and flood
With just one chord, the thrill and clarity of sound
But soon the song went slowly dead and I was forced to take a stand on one side
It was him or my fag hag, oh, well, I guess, she was never that good of a friend
After my fag hag friend had fled the minister looked mighty fed and content
We said his rewritten vows that I could hardly pronounce
But was soon drowned it out by that organ and the shout

It was the orders that I take the wrath upon my own rod
Then I repeated my own vows, they were perverted and they smelled of myself
That there is splendor in the harshness of bum
That consummation makes a grumble and the sound that I have learned called
