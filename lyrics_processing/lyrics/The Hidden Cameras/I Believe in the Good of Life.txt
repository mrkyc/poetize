I believe in the good
I believe in the good
I believe in the good of life
I believe in the good of life as I kneel for a taste of man
I believe in the taste of wine as I do not step on a land mine
I believe in the good of life as I kneel for a taste of man
I believe in the taste of wine as I do not step on a land mine
I'll testify on the world of radio that I dream of the fate of democracy
As I flee on my bike from the crimes we made
And that I did not do those drugs or steal those underpants
I believe in the good of life as I plead for a taste of man
I'm thirsty for a taste of wine as I do not step on a land mine
I'll testify on the world of radio that I dream of the fate of democracy
As I flee on my bike from the crimes we made
And that I did not do those drugs or steal those underpants
I believe in the good of life as I kneel for a taste of man
I believe in the taste of wine as I do not step on a land mine
