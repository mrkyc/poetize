He walks
And talks with me
He knows my every thought
If seeing is believing
I'm sure we'll be conceiving
Our own mirage
With every bit of Eden
Again we will be meeting
We'll be on time
Closed eye 
Expecting a greeting
We'll be denied

We're counting stars like we're all in heaven
But they never even knew our names
Oh we shine like we're all in heaven
But we ain't
We're counting stars like we're all in heaven
But they never even knew our names
Oh we shine like we're all in heaven
But we ain't
You might also like
I know he must be looking
I know he must be watching
My every move
When I think about believing
I think about deceiving
Ever more
If I knew there was a problem
With the pain I would have stopped it
I felt the love
Oh what a pain it must have been
Because I was bleeding
From every pore

We're counting stars like we're all in heaven
But they never even knew our names
Oh we aspire to all go to heaven
When we ain't
Oh we shine like we're all in heaven
But they never even knew our names
Oh we shine like we're all ascending
But we ain't
You play 
And I'll play the drum
And You play Peter 
And I'll play the drum

We're counting stars like we're all in heaven
But they never even had our names
Oh we shine like we're all in heaven
But we ain't
We're counting stars like we're all in heaven
But they never even knew our names
Oh we aspire to all go to heaven
But we ain't
Oh we shine like we're all in heaven
But they never even knew our names
Oh we shine like we're all ascending
But we ain't
