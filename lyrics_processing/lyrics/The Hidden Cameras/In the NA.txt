Hey! Hey! Hey!
In the Na, In the Na
In the Na, In the Na
In the Na, In the Na
In the Na, In the Na
In the Na, In the Na
In the Na, In the Na
In the Na, In the Na
In the Na, In the Na

Lose my stare in the Na
Watch my back in the Na
Hid my past by the Na
Hold me close in the Na
Incomplete in the Na
Diamondless in the Na
Hold my hand in the Na
Watch my back

Would it be the single Na?
Take each Na as my own
Would it be the single thing?
Higher than anyone
I'd be starin' at the ground
With my head in the clouds
Hey!
You might also like
In the Na, In the Na
In the Na, In the Na
In the Na, In the Na
In the Na, In the Na

And in love in the Na
Hold me close in the Na
I take control in the Na
No holdin' back in the Na
Can't record in the Na
Won't be late for the Na
And in the, the Na
Dig my face

Then I wouldn't feel the need to Na
I was higher than used to before
And would it have a single thought
Pretty from livin' in my whole Na
I'd be starin' at the ground
With my head in the clouds
Hey!

State my name to the Na
Won't complain at the Na
Give my name to the Na
Hold me close in the Na
Walk my cane with the Na
Take all the blame for the Na
Marry one day in the Na
Close the gate
Then I wouldn't be the only one
Goin' to the sea of Na
No, I wouldn't have a single thought
Pretty from livin' in my whole Na
I'd be starin' at the ground
With my head in the clouds
