You got your hands up singing and your short skirt swinging
Hell you even better bought a t-shirt
But you'll be churching with your mama come Sunday morning trying to shake off Saturday night
But you're a little straight A and a little cray cray
Girl you sound like you're just my type, that's right
Well I like a little bit of bad girl
And I like a little bit of sweet
And I like a little boom boom in a room
And a little chicken picking on a six string
And I like a little bit of whiskey
And I don't mind a little bit of smoke
A little truck shock squeaking
A little good book preaching
I like a little bit of both
Like a little bit of both
A little bit of both
Girl you keep it so fresh
Girl you keep it so dope
Girl you're like Cinderella in a blender
With a little bit of wicked witch kicking in the mix
You got a Route 44
Raspberry Cherry Coke
But you spike it with a little Seagrams
And them low cut Levi's
Surprise, surprise
There's a little black lace beneath 'em

You got the middle of a backseat
Baby with your nickname on it
Yeah, I like a little bit of bad girl
And I like a little bit of sweet
And I like a little boom boom in a room
And a little chicken picking on a six string
And I like a little bit of whiskey
And I don't mind a little bit of smoke
A little truck shock squeaking
A little good book preaching
I like a little bit of both
