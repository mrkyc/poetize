Yeah cigarettes taste good to me
But the body is a temple I read so I
I ain't messin' with Jesus
I love drivin' fast down a country road
But a voice in my head says take it slow
So I, I ain't messin' with Jesus

I wanna keep him on my good side
Keep him on my bad side a little less of the time
I never plan on being perfect
I'm a back slidin' serpent of a man most of the time
But I walk the line
Until I get to the other side
No I ain't messin' with Jesus

Yeah, I got a dark side and I try to live right
So I stay up late and I pray all night
Cause I, I ain't messin' with Jesus
Yeah I wanna do wrong in the middle of right
I wanna get drunk and have a good fight
But I, I ain't messin' with Jesus, nah

I wanna keep him on my good side
Keep him on my bad side a little less of the time
I never plan on being perfect
I'm a back slidin' serpent of a man most of the time
But I walk the line
Until I get to the other side
No I ain't messin' with Jesus

Hallelujah

I wanna keep him on my good side
Keep him on my bad side a little less of the time
I never plan on being perfect
I'm a back slidin' serpent of a man most of the time
But I walk the line
Until I get to the other side
No I ain't messin' with Jesus
I wanna keep him on my good side
Keep him on my bad side a little less of the time
I never plan on being perfect
I'm a back slidin' serpent of a man most of the time
But I walk the line
Until I get to the other side
