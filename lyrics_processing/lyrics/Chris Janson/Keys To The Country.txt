And I don't know where the velvet rope unhooks for the uptown crowd
Don't know the name of the restaurant where they valet park your ride
But I know where to buy ice-cold beer
Where to tear up a Friday night cause
I got the keys to the country
Sittin' in my F350
I know where to park way out in the dark
Where the stars shine down so pretty
Got the keys to the gate
To the Johnson's lake
A little honey hole to take you honey
I ain't got the keys to the city
But I got the keys to the country
I got the inside track
I can take you back to a fresh cut bottomland field
And there's a little bit of water still standing in the corner
If you feel like spinnin' these wheels
And there's a crack in the roof where the moon shines through
If you wanna hide out in the barn
We can set up shop and let the tailgate drop
Have our own little flatbed bar, baby
I got the keys to the country
Sittin' in my F350
I know where to park way out in the dark
Where the stars shine down so pretty
Got the keys to the gate
To the Johnson's lake
A little honey hole to take you honey
I ain't got the keys to the city
But I got the keys to the country
