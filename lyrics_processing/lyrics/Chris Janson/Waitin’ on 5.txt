Underneath a car, turning on a wrench
Out there on a farm fixing that fence
It's like watching your team
While you sit on the bench
Waitin' on five to start on six
Out in the sun or in the AC
Two hours left when the hand's at three
If you wanting overtime, well sorry I'm sick
Waitin' on five to start on six

Everybody watching that tick tock tick
Slower it goes the closer it gets
We'll be cracking and popping and giving it a twist
Waitin' on five to start on six
Hey, hey, alright
Yeah we're gonna have a little party tonight
Hey, hey, alright
Sipping and kissing somebody tonight

Sunday night comes and I'm getting depressed
Monday morning blues and my head is a mess
Friday rolls around and I'm getting that itch
Waitin' on five to start on six

Slower it goes the closer it gets
We'll be cracking and popping and giving it a twist
Waitin' on five to start on six, hey

I'd rather dig in a cooler, man, than dig in a ditch
I'm sick and damn tired of being somebody's bitch
I been working all day, 'bout time to quit
Waitin' on five to start on six

Everybody watching that tick tock tick
