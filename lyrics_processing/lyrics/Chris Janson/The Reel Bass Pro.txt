The smell of an old two-stroke on a twelve-foot boat
Early mornin' on the river
Frost on a calm-cut field and a white-tail
Runnin' in mid-November
A blaze-orange cap layin' up on my dash
Slow ridin' down an old farm road
Yeah, that's the real truck, duck, buck, and Bass Pro

There's a little slice of heaven
That I shot that eleven-point buck with a double-drop tine
And you oughta see a Whopper Plopper on the top water
Come Saturday at sunrise
Everybody who knows me damn sure knows
I'll be twenty foot high in a tall white oak
That's the real truck, duck, buck, and Bass Pro

There ain't nothin' like the smell of bacon on the griddle
In a duck blind, first of the year
Yeah, it's cut 'em all, high five, green heads hit the water
Then it's time for an ice-cold beer
Thank the good Lord for the great outdoors
And Johnny Morris for the fishin' poles
Yeah, that's the real truck, duck, buck, and Bass Pro

There's a little slice of heaven
That I shot that eleven-point buck with a double-drop tine
And you oughta see a Whopper Plopper on the top water
Come Saturday at sunrise
Everybody who knows me damn sure knows
I'll be twenty foot high in a tall white oak
That's the real truck, duck, buck, and Bass Pro

Drop a line in the water, drop a bullet in the gun
Drop a Mercury on a Tracker if you wanna have fun

'Cause there's a little slice of heaven
That I shot that eleven-point buck with a double-drop tine
And you oughta see a Whopper Plopper on the top water
Come Saturday at sunrise
Everybody who knows me damn sure knows
I'll be twenty foot high in a tall white oak
That's the real truck, duck, buck, and Bass Pro
