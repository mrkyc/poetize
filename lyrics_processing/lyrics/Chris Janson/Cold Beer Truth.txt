The sunset's sweeter in the summer time
Blue jean pockets need an old case knife
A penny's worth more on a railroad track
Girls look better in a Bass Pro cap
All the best songs have a fiddle and steel
You can still count on a handshake deal
It ain't what you say, it's what you do, yeah
That's just the cold beer truth

Love is life, time flies
Bama can't help but Roll damn Tide
Dirt is gold, don't ever sell
NASCAR ain't been the same since we lost Dale
Everything's better down an old dirt road
It ain't a day off without an old Zebco
And a Coleman cooler to reach into
That's just the cold beer truth

When you find somethin' good, boy, you better hang on
Ain't a better buddy than an old bird dog
Money don't last, but the memories do, yeah
That's the cold beer truth

Everything's better down an old dirt road
It ain't a day off without an old Zebco

That's just the cold beer truth

So hang around, have you one or two
Yeah, life looks better after you had a few
And that's the cold beer truth
That's the cold beer truth
Yeah

Love is life, time flies
Bama can't help but Roll damn Tide
Dirt is gold, don't ever sell
NASCAR ain't been the same since we lost Dale

That's just the cold beer truth
