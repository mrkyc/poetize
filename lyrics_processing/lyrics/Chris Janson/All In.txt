I'm a little bit lakeshore, a little bit sand
I'm a little bit fast car, little pick up man
I'm a little bit Georgia, I'm a little Tennessee
But there wasn't no halfway
First time you looked at me, girl

I was all in
Like the stars up in that sky, girl, I was fallin'
From the minute that I saw you, I was callin'
That night and every day since
I was long gone forever
I was never on the fence
Yeah, I was all in

You had on that little green dress
But you dressed it down with boots
Lived in New York, out in L.A
But you never left your roots
You were honeysuckle sweet
And you were wildfire wild
Baby, I could see my future
First time I saw you smile

I was all in
Like the stars up in that sky, girl, I was fallin'
From the minute that I saw you, I was callin'
That night and every day since
I was long gone forever
I was never on the fence
Yeah, I was all in
Naw, it didn't take three weeks 'fore I was fallin'
I was down there one knee and I was callin'
Everybody that we knew
Going on and on about you
Couldn't wait to say "I do"
I was all in
Baby, I was all in

Not one hesitation, no wasting your time
That pounding in my heart left no doubt in my mind

I was all in
Just like them stars, girl, I was fallin'
From the minute that I saw you, I was callin'
That night and every day since
I was long gone forever
I was never on the fence
Yeah, I was all in
Naw, it didn't take three weeks 'fore I was fallin'
I was down there one knee and I was callin'
Everybody that we knew
Going on and on about you
Couldn't wait to say "I do"
I was all in
