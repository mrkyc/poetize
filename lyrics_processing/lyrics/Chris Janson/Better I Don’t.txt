And I said, "It's probably better I don't"
He said, "There's a lotta girls in this here bar that we could chase"
I said, "Trust me"
It's probably better I don't
'Cause I used to be an all nighter
I'm a hell of a back slider
I've been around the block more than a time or two
And I can promise you
I've drank my weight in booze
And I've been known to get on stage in nothing but my boots
So it's better I don't, Cause believe me I will
I get looser than a line on a fishing reel
Dare me don't do, don't think I won't
Take it all off, turn it all on
Get buck wild, hell bent, and stoned It's better I don't
Well I was wearing the cuffs, when the warden said
"Just tell me the truth"
And I said, "Sir, it's probably better I don't"
And I was up on the stand, and the judge said
"Just tell me what happened man"
And I said, "Buddy it's probably better I don't, but since you asked"
I was mindin' my own business at a hundred and five
I was a county road cruisin'
Out running the blue lights
I was on the home stretch
I was roundin' that last curve
Well I ran out of gas and that's when I learn
It's better I don't, cause believe me I will
I get looser than a line on a fishing reel
Dare me don't do, don't think I won't
Take it all off, turn it all on
Get buck wild, hell bent, and stoned
It's better I don't
Now there's things I don't remember
There's things that I do
But I don't know the half of what I got into
And it's better I don't, cause believe me I will
I get looser than a line on your fishing reel
Dare me don't do, don't think I won't take it all off
Turn it all on
Get buck wild, hell bent, and stoned
Drunk dial somebody on the phone
Drink too many beers and drive a Harley home
It's better I don't
Yeah it's better I don't
