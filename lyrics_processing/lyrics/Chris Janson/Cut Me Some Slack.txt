Know exactly what you're doin', don't you?
Treat me like you like me, like you don't like me back
I wish you'd give me the green light, give me just one night
Girl, if you don't like how I roll
You can say, no thanks, don't ever call me
Forget you ever saw me, forget my name
Girl, you might just like some country road moonlight
Dancing in the lights of my headache rack
Think about that, yeah think about that
Is there any chance
You could cut me some slack
I know I got a wild side, wilder than a country mile ride
I got a name around this town
And girl, I don't really blame you for the things you might be thinkin'
They're probably true but that ain't me now
Give me the green light, give me just one night
Girl, if you don't like how I roll
You can say, no thanks, don't ever call me
Forget you ever saw me, forget my name
Girl, you might just like some country road moonlight
Dancing in the lights of my headache rack
Think about that, think about that
Is there any chance
You could cut me some slack

That I never ever felt like this, girl
And that's the truth
Give me the green light, give me just one night
Girl, if you don't like how I roll
You can say, no thanks, don't ever call me
Forget you ever saw me, forget my name
Girl, you might just like some country road moonlight
Dancing in the lights of my headache rack
Think about that, yeah think about that
Is there any chance
That you could cut me some slack
Oh oh oh, yeah
Cut me some slack
