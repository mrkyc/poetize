Honey have you been outside
It's getting down around sixty-five
It's like Georgia knew you loved those California kinda nights
And that spot you like downtown
It's got the band I know you love
And I got your favorite playlist all queued up

So baby count to ten then meet me in the driveway
Slide under my right arm we'll head down that highway
Girl we got forever we don't have to wait on it
Stars are in a line in the sky and it's a perfect night
Girl it's got you name on it
This night has got your name on it

Got a koozie waiting on ya
Six pack of Mic Ultra Light
Got half an empty bench seat just the way you like
I got two hard working hands and I got these miss you lips
They're only made to hold you here for you to kiss

Baby count to ten then meet me in the driveway
Slide under my right arm we'll head down that highway
Girl we got forever we don't have to wait on it
Stars are in a line in the sky and it's a perfect night
Girl it's got you name on it
This night has got your name on it
