So much for picking up when we want to and just going
No more drop of a hat packing a back and getting gone
Ain't had a chance to sleep in since I don't know when
Goodbye to thinking you were the only one in the world worth holding on to
Even if I could I wouldn't change a thing
Cause God I love bein' a Dad

These hand prints and these drawings on the walls in the halls can drive me crazy
Got keep anything that means anything way out of reach
That brand new bike is laying out there in the yard and it's raining
I tell them over and over and over
They don't practice what I preach
I tried to, but I can't stay mad
Oh man I love bein' a Dad

It keeps me young, it takes me back
It makes me cry, it makes me laugh
It's what I do, it's why I breath
My flesh and blood, my legacy
It;s the hardest and most rewarding job I've ever had
Ain't nothing like bein' a Dad

We got these old training wheels we don't know what to do with
Before we know it they'll outgrow those bikes in the yard
And just like that they'll be driving like there's nothing to it
We'll help them pack and wave goodbye as they leave in their new used car
I guess we'll get our old lives back, but I ain't looking forward to that
Man I love bein' a Dad

It keeps me young, it takes me back
It makes me cry, it makes me laugh
It's what I do, it's why I breath
My flesh and blood, my legacy
It's the hardest and most rewarding job I've ever had
Ain't nothing like bein' a Dad
