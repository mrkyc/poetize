Bye, Mom
That's what I said at five years old, the first day of school
Already then, I thought I was way too cool
I thought I had it figured out
And I didn't know a thing
Bye, Mom
Don't worry about me, I'll see you at three at the bus stop
And I know that you'll be right there to pick me up
In the old truck

And oh, that's just the way it is
When you think you're grown, but you're still a kid
And you don't know you're somebody
That somebody loves more than themselves
And there's a beauty in the innocence
Of not knowin' that the time they spent
Is more than one could ask for
And that's a special kind of love
And it's only there for a lifetime, then it's gone
And it's bye, Mom

You can drop me off down the block around the corner square
All my buddies are waitin' for me just over there
I'll see you later on
Bye, Mom
It's a cap and a gown and a brand new town eight hours away
Don't cry, I'll be okay

And oh, that's just the way it is
When you think you're grown, but you're still a kid
And you don't know you're somebody
That somebody loves more than themselves
And there's a beauty in the innocence
Of not knowin' that the time they spent
Is more than one could ask for
And that's a special kind of love
And it's only there for a lifetime, then it's gone
And it's bye, Mom

And by Mom, I sang a million mornings
At the Brine Street Baptist Church
And by Mom, I waited hours and hours 'til she got off of work
And by Mom, I stood and cried and laid a rose onto a grave
And "Bye, Mom" were the last words that I spoke
Before we sang "Amazing Grace"

And oh, that's just the way it is
When you're all grown up, but you're still a kid
And you realize you're somebody
That somebody loves more than themselves
And there's a beauty in the innocence
Of not knowin' that the time they spent
Is more than one could ask for
And that's a special kind of love
And it's only there for a lifetime, then it's gone
Yeah, it's only there for a lifetime, then it's gone
And it's bye, Mom
