Everybody stutters one way or the other

That the stutter and the scat is the same thing, yo

Why should we be pleasing in the politician heathens
Who would try to change the seasons if they could?
The state of the condition insults my intuitions
And it only makes me crazy and a heart like wood
Everybody stutters one way or the other
So check out my message to you
As a matter of fact, I'm letting nothing hold you back
If the Scatman can do it, brother, so can you
I'm the Scatman

I hear y'all ask 'bout the meaning of scat
Well, I'm the professor and all I can tell you is
