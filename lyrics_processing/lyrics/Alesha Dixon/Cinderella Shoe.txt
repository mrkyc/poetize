Hey
Me nummi-num one
Hey, hey, hey

Every little thing you do
Makes me feel a little love for you
And every little thing you say
Makes me say, "Oh, baby, we should float away"
I can never calculate
Everything out on plate
'Cause every little thing you say
Makes me feel like I can't wait

What you gotta do
Find yourself a clue, Cinderella shoe
Do what you gotta do
Then I'll slip into a Cinderella shoe
What you gotta do
Find yourself a clue, Cinderella shoe
Do what you gotta do
Then I'll slip into a Cinderella shoe
You might also like
What would you say? What would you do
If every day I was here all over you?
Would it be nice, boy, if you knew?
What it be like with my eyes all over you?
What would you say if I could prove
That I could light every light inside of you?
What would you say? What would you do?
I wanna do it too

What you gotta do
Find yourself a clue, Cinderella shoe
Do what you gotta do
Then I'll slip into a Cinderella shoe
What you gotta do
Find yourself a clue, Cinderella shoe
Do what you gotta do
Then I'll slip into a Cinderella shoe

Baby, come on over
Why don't you come on over? Know you should
I got a little for you
I got a little taste of what tastes good
Baby, come on over
Why don't you come on over? Know you should
I got a little for you
I got a little taste of what tastes good
What you gotta do
Find yourself a clue, Cinderella shoe
Do what you gotta do
Then I'll slip into a Cinderella shoe
What you gotta do
Find yourself a clue, Cinderella shoe
Do what you gotta do
Then I'll slip into a Cinderella shoe
