Listen, I don't have to say it, just listen
To the words that we just don't say right now
I really wanna love you but I don't know how
Can't you hear how it's playing? Like guitars with broken strings
There's never any harmony, don't cry
We both know the sounds of a long goodbye

The truth is that it never should've gone this far
And it never would've been this hard
I, I don't wanna play this song
But I was never in love

Now it's all out of tune, between me and you
Can't you hear the music?
I'll be leaving soon, cause it's all out of tune
Can't you hear the lyrics, the words and melodies?
They're sharp and cut too deep, the sound is piercing
And the song keeps playing, your heart keeps breaking
And I can't take it, the song's still playing but we're all out of tune

I'll say it cause it's painful to just replay this
I don't wanna break your heart no more
But I can never give you what you're asking for
See, you have never done me wrong
To leave a good man is hard
It's harder if we stay here and we just deny
We can't be together and we both know why
You might also like
The truth is that it never should've gone this far
And it never would've been this hard
I, I don't wanna play this song
But I was never in love

Now it's all out of tune, between me and you
Can't you hear the music?
I'll be leaving soon, cause it's all out of tune
Can't you hear the lyrics, the words and melodies?
They're sharp and cut too deep, the sound is piercing
And the song keeps playing, your heart keeps breaking
And I can't take it, the song's still playing but we're all out of tune

See, I don't really wanna sing this part
All I wanna do is make it stop
But the song plays on, the song plays on and on and on and on...

Now it's all out of tune, between me and you
Can't you hear the music?
I'll be leaving soon, cause it's all out of tune
Can't you hear the lyrics, the words and melodies?
They're sharp and cut too deep, the sound is piercing
And the song keeps playing, your heart keeps breaking
