Every move we make, call it a mistake
Looking at a wall like a prisoner in chains
Tell us that we're wrong, tell us what we want
Throw us in an ocean that I know we don't belong

That's when the passion comes in (comes in for us)
That's when we fight and we win
We are the miracle, lightning bolt, love us so

Just the way we are
Just the way we are
Just the
Just the way we are
Just the way we are
Just the
Just the way we are

Now who we gonna be?
Nobody can tell
But you're tryna' write a script for me
That's made for someone else
Changing up the rules, rules I gotta break
But the diamond that's inside of me
Will always be a fake

That's when the passion comes in (comes in for us)
That's when we fight and we win
We are the miracle, lightning bolt, love us so

Just the way we are
Just the way we are
Just the
Just the way we are
Just the way we are
Just the
Just the way we are

Show them your light
Don't turn them down
It's not their right to come and criticize
Show them your light
It's a miracle
Love us so, just the way we are

Way that we are, way that we am
AD 2015, rapping madam
Back on the scene, scandalous teas
Dripping with style so casually
Bout' to put it on ya, cause I got this unlocked
Jump out your seat like a jack in the box
Hitting it hard, shooting the stars
We gonna get it on
Just the way we are (Never change who we are)
Just the way we are (Stay the same, just the)
Just the way we are (Never change who we are)
Just the way we are (Stay the same, just the)
Just the way we are (Never change who we are)
Just the way we are (Stay the same, just the)
Just the way we are (Never change who we are)
Just the way we are
All I'm asking is you to love that
