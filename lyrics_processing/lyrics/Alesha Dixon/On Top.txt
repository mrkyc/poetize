What you know about The Stereotypes?

Jeans and a t-shirt, that's what you prefer
Heineken kinda guy, the guy, I do my search
But every time I see you, you're sipping Grey Goose
And I see that new Prada shirt, Mister GQ

When you tryna impress, impress me
Ooh, I love it, ooh, I love it, so sexy
All dressed up, now undress me
Oh, I look so good on ya
You thought you was hot before
Lights, camera, press record
Wait 'til we, wait 'til we hit the floor
Ooh, we look so good

I'm your cherry on top, when I met you, you were hot
Now you're such a superstar
Boy, I'm on the A-List, I'll make you famous
I'm your cherry on top, make you wanna tie the knot
You know I can make you rock
Yeah, I got the magic 'cause I'm the baddest

Lemme, lemme get on top (Get on top)
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh

You like your cars loud, you like 'em worn out
You said you'd rather watch the game at your boy's house
But when you come around me, I hop in your Bugatti
End up at the club, on the floor where you found me

When you tryna impress, impress me
Ooh, I love it, ooh, I love it, so sexy
All dressed up, now undress me
Oh, I look so good on ya
You thought you was hot before
Lights, camera, press record
Wait 'til we, wait 'til we hit the floor
Ooh, we look so good

I'm your cherry on top, when I met you, you were hot
Now you're such a superstar
Boy, I'm on the A-List, I'll make you famous
I'm your cherry on top, make you wanna tie the knot
You know I can make you rock
Yeah, I got the magic 'cause I'm the baddest

Lemme, lemme get on top (Get on top)
Lemme, lemme get on top (Get on top)
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh

If you got the cake, I, I, I got the icing
Just hop in the plane, baby, I'll do the flying
Push the throttle up, looky-looky much I scream
Throw me on the top, I'll make your life so exciting
Exciting, exciting, exciting
Exciting, exciting, eh-eh-eh

I'm your cherry on top, when I met you, you were hot
Now you're such a superstar
Boy, I'm on the A-List, I'll make you famous
I'm your cherry on top, make you wanna tie the knot
You know I can make you rock
