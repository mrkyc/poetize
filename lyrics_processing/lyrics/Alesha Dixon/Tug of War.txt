What page you coming from
You want me then you don't
I can't figure it out, why can't I let go
My mind is torn in two, this love is difficult
I wanna leave but I keep running back to you

Don't know if I should stay, walk away or leave to fate
You got me in a daze, I can't debate a crazy place
I wanna run away, fly away, get away
But I still feel you babe, want you babe, need you babe

Every time we split, tell myself that's it
Giving up, I quit and then I love you again
I'm right, you're wrong, boy it's all your fault
Here's your ring, I'm gone, I think I love you again
(Tug of war) Can't make up my mind now
(Tug of war) I'm undecided
(Tug of war) My heart's divided
I think I love you again
(Tug of war) Hello, bye bye
(Tug of war) Still undecided
(Tug of war) This isn't right
Should I stay or should I go?
You might also like
I hate your stupid voice, you don't give me no choice
You're talking at me and over me, all I hear is noise
But when I'm feeling down, you always cheer me up
I'm so confused, a-am I in or out of love

Don't know if I should stay, walk away or leave to fate
You got me in a daze, I can't debate a crazy place
I wanna run away, fly away, get away
But I still feel you babe, want you babe, need you babe

Every time we split, tell myself that's it
Giving up, I quit and then I love you again
I'm right, you're wrong, boy it's all your fault
Here's your ring, I'm gone, I think I love you again
(Tug of war) Can't make up my mind now
(Tug of war) I'm undecided
(Tug of war) My heart's divided
I think I love you again
(Tug of war) Hello, bye bye
(Tug of war) Still undecided
(Tug of war) This isn't right
Should I stay or should I go?
Pulling me away and then you're pulling me close
I give you what you wanted, what you want, want the most
Whatever the weather you thought we would be together
Now my love for you has withered like a month-old rose
Hey, other side of that door
Do we really ever really know for sure
It's really simple and plain to see
You will never find another me

Don't know if I should stay, walk away or leave to fate
You got me in a daze, I can't debate a crazy place
I wanna run away, fly away, get away
But I still feel you babe, want you babe, need you babe

Every time we split, tell myself that's it
Giving up, I quit and then I love you again
I'm right, you're wrong, boy it's all your fault
Here's your ring, I'm gone, I think I love you again
(Tug of war) Can't make up my mind now
(Tug of war) I'm undecided
(Tug of war) My heart's divided
I think I love you again
(Tug of war) Hello, bye bye
(Tug of war) Still undecided
(Tug of war) This isn't right
Should I stay or should I go?
Can't make up my mind now
