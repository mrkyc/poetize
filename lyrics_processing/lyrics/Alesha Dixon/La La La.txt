Ladies and gentlemen, are you ready for this one?
Let's go...

Coming back with a different swag
Flying high with the U.K. flag
I'm in America, brand new tracks
Lady MC with the yardie chat
I'm making delicate diamond hits
Transatlantic rep for the Brits
Can you hear me, 1, 2 check
In a McCartney dress, I rock with the best

I bit the apple of pop, pop music
I've been chained up and incarcerated
Wanna get out, wanna get loud
And if you hear me let me hear you shout

I'm breaking out, come if you dare
Let's paint this town, hands in the air
It's going down, all night, oh yeah, oh yeah
If you're with me let me hear you say
La la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la la
You might also like
I'm hitting new heights bigger and bold
I am an animal that's out of control
It's just how I roll, back to the old Alesha flow
Sit upon de rhythm D.J. spin decks
See the people jump up, see you're impressed
Can you hear me, 1, 2 check
Can you hear me, 1, 2 check

Knocking it down and I'm taking a risk
Pulling it back to the rhythm of this
Back in the club, tearing it up
You wanna see me, yeah you wanna touch

I'm breaking out, come if you dare
Let's paint this town, hands in the air
It's going down, all night, oh yeah, oh yeah
If you're with me let me hear you say
La la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la la
Sing la, sing la, sing la
It's a party, all the girls be dressed in Bvlgari
Looking out like it's a Safari
Ready to pounce, ready to crank this party
Feeling the treble and feeling the rhythm
And feeling the bass for me
I'm on a new tip, fresh like my lipstick
Cherry bomb the crowd goes ballistic
Don't wanna miss this, yeah you wanna kiss this
I'll be priority on everybody's guest list
If you're with me let me hear you say

I'm breaking out, come if you dare
Let's paint this town, hands in the air
It's going down, all night, oh yeah, oh yeah
If you're with me let me hear you say
La la la la la la la la la la la la
