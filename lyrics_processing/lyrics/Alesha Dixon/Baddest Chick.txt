Imma give it to you anyway you want, want, want
Look don't stare, give it to me now, yeah yeah yeah

Spin my body round, like a merry go
Round n round n round, just can't get enough
Get it get it up, turn my body on
You got what I want
Got a problem, you're the antidote
Get it to me now, it's okay
Get it get it up, turn my body on

You're looking at the baddest chick in the building
Don't show love and I don't catch feelings
Shine all day, play all night
I could pimp a guy, that's what I feel like
That's what I feel like, feel like, that's what I feel like, feel like
That's how I feel, feel like, swear I feel
Like the baddest chick in here's right here
