Hey
When I lay it all out on the table, don't know what is stopping me
From feeling like I might be able to enjoy my own company
Sitting up by my window watching the summer rain
The world goes by in a minute, faster than I can keep up with today

Knockdown, everybody in the place sayin' what now
Ya soul's feeling shot down, luck's out
But ya gotta carry on, speed it up now
Woo-woo-woo, whoa
Knockdown, everybody in the place sayin' what now
Ya soul's feeling shot down, luck's out
But ya gotta carry on, speed it up now

Ooh, yeah, I got the feeling that something could happen now
Yeah, I got the feeling that something might happen inside my life now
And have you ever asked why you feel like you've been here before?
'Cause only you have the power to carry on through that door

Knockdown, everybody in the place sayin' what now
Ya soul's feeling shot down, luck's out
But ya gotta carry on, speed it up now
Woo-woo-woo, whoa
Knockdown, everybody in the place sayin' what now
Ya soul's feeling shot down, luck's out
But ya gotta carry on, speed it up now

So when you're up, go get on up, oh
Get on up, don't give it up, no
Whoa, steady up, don't dig it up, oh

So when you're up, go get on up, oh
Get on up, don't give it up, no
Whoa, steady up, don't dig it up, oh

Woo-woo-woo, whoa
Knockdown, everybody in the place sayin' what now
Ya soul's feeling shot down, luck's out
But ya gotta carry on, speed it up now
When I think I got this song, I'll dance out late
And I got my bad-ass on, heels on, sure tempting fate
I think I own it, and you know it, baby
Life goes on, pure fun, it's all a bit o' play
