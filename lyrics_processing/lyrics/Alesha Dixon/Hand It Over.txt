There's a part that doesn't work at all
Ran out of power cos I left it on
But there's a part that still believes in love
But now it's turning cold

Cos I let somebody handle me
And I made it hurt again, yeah
Cos they did it so much damage
Never thought it would run again, no
But I found the pieces, every single one and I put 'em back
Never wanna go through that again

Oh no, say no no
Say never wanna, say no no
Oh if I hand it over to you
Would you help my heart out with a beat or two?
Oh if I hand it over to you
Would you be careful?

When you're close
My heart's away above the ground
But then it falls when you're not around
It beats and it pounds
I can't turn it down and now I'm afraid
You might also like
Cos I let somebody handle me
And I made it hurt again, yeah
Cos they did it so much damage
Never thought it would run again, no
But I found the pieces, every single one and I put 'em back
Never wanna go through that again

Oh no, say no no
Say never wanna, say no no
Oh if I hand it over to you
Would you help my heart out with a beat or two?
Oh if I hand it over to you
Would you be careful?

You got so many things about you
And I don't have the words to say
Cos my heart is doin' the talking
Can you hear it, it's callin' your name

I wanna hand it over, hand it over to you
I wanna hand it over, yeah yeah
Oh if I hand it over to you
Would you help my heart out with a beat or two?
Oh if I hand it over to you
Would you be careful?
Oh if I hand it over to you
Would you help my heart out with a beat or two?
Oh if I hand it over to you
Would you be careful?
Oh if I hand it over to you
Would you help my heart out with a beat or two?
