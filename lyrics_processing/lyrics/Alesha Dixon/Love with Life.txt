Temporarily I get by
Hope beneath the cloud in my mind
Then I pray, I wanna fall from the stars
Be the lord of the dance
And now I'm dreaming of a world that could be
Learn to heaven is a place within me
So I choose to laugh
Even though it gets hard
My heart's in a kingdom, still covered in scars
I'm living for today
I'm happy I can say

That I'm so in love
I'm so in love with life
With an open heart
I'm so in love with life
Don't fight a feeling like this
'Cos if you try to resist
I'll throw a penny in my wishing well
And don't even kiss
Yeah, I'm so in love
So in love with life

Usually the story goes
The more I lose, the more I'm able to grow
I know that every little move that I make
Will be  as if it's a mistake
In the corner of my mind, a past is put aside
I'm feeling good, 'cos I'm loving the sunshine
Living for today
And now I'm happy I can say
You might also like
That I'm so in love
I'm so in love with life
With an open heart
I'm so in love with life
Don't fight a feeling like this
'Cos if you try to resist
I'll throw a penny in my wishing well
And don't even kiss
Yeah, I'm so in love
So in love with life

Say it louder
'Cos I'm sick of all the crowded noise
Only room for a high choice
I make 'em proud of me
Finally I get to really see
What I've been fighting for in
I believe
Shine on me
'Cos finally
That's why I'm so in love

That I'm so in love
I'm so in love with life
With an open heart
I'm so in love with life
Don't fight a feeling like this
'Cos if you try to resist
I'll throw a penny in my wishing well
And don't even kiss
Yeah, I'm so in love
So in love with life
I'm so in love
So in love with life
So in love
