I got a man with two left feet
And when he dances not to the beat
I really think that he should know
That his rhythm's go, go, go
I got a man with two left feet
And when he dances not to the beat
I really think that he should know
That his rhythm's go, go, go

Does he wash up? Never wash up
Does he clean up? No, he never cleans up
Does he brush up? He never brushed up
He does nothing, the boy does nothing
Does he wash up? Never wash up
Does he clean up? No, he never cleans up
Does he brush up? He never brushed up
He does nothing, the boy does nothing

Hey, boy, how you been?
I got a thousand lines, where do I begin?
And I, I been here, been there travelling
I saw you at the corner, my vibe kicked in
And then two-two's, I clocked you
Wearing tight jeans, a real nice suit
You were smiling like you were just seventeen
I asked you for a dance, you said, "Yes, please"
Take a sip of dancing juice, everybody's onto you
To the left then to the right
Everybody hit the rhythm, it's on tonight
I'm gonna feel the beat within my soul
I need a man to take control
Let the melody blow you all away

Work it out now, work it, work it out now
Do the mambo, shake it all around now
Everybody on the floor, let me see you clap your hands
I wanna see you work, I wanna see you move your body and turn
I wanna see you shake your hips and learn
I wanna see you work it, work it, work it out now, hey
I wanna see you work, I wanna see you move your body and turn
I wanna see you shake your hips and learn
I wanna see you work it, work it, work it out now (Oh)

And if the man can't dance, he gets no second chance (Do the mambo, shake it all around now)
And if the man can't dance, he gets no second chance (Do the mambo, shake it all around now)
And if the man can't dance, he gets no second chance (Do the mambo, shake it all around now)
