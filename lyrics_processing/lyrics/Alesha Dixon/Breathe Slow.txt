I'm running out of patience
'Cause I can't believe what the hell I'm hearing (Hearing)
And speaking of hell, it don't compare
To this heat that I am feeling (Feeling)

I love you too much, it shows
All my emotions go outta control
Good for you, bad for me
When I can hardly see, from the tears that flow

Can't forget to breathe slow
Count from one to ten with my eyes closed
'Cause ladies take it in and get composure
Before I lose it, get composure
I'm gonna breathe slow
Count from one to ten with my eyes closed
'Cause ladies take it in and get composure
Ladies never lose composure

Not gonna lie or even try
You got my wheels spinning (Spinning)
And I ain't the one to shoot the gun
'Cause that means you will be winning
You might also like
I love you too much, it shows
All my emotions go outta control
Good for you, bad for me
When I can hardly see, from the tears that flow

Can't forget to breathe slow
Count from one to ten with my eyes closed
'Cause ladies take it in and get composure
Before I lose it, get composure
I'm gonna breathe slow
Count from one to ten with my eyes closed
'Cause ladies take it in and get composure
Ladies never lose composure

Somebody better hold me back
You're lucky I know how to act
So lucky ain't gonna attack
I'm being calm and cool
But believe me you
It's taken everything to just breathe (Breathe, breathe)

Can't forget to breathe slow
Count from one to ten with my eyes closed
'Cause ladies take it in and get composure
Before I lose it, get composure
I'm gonna breathe slow
Count from one to ten with my eyes closed
'Cause ladies take it in and get composure
