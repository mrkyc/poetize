I used to fight hard
Life was like a hustle in a school yard
Doing it for myself is what it taught me
Nothing is impossible
Impossible to breathe is where he left me

Now that I leave it all behind
Baby, can't you see?
I'm in a different state of mind
Felt the beat was changing
When you came into my life
For finally I see the life
From deep inside the underground I rise
Now I

Do it, do it, do it for love
Do it, do it, do it for love
Do it, do it, do it for love
(yeah, yeah, yeah)
Do it, do it, do it for love
Do it, do it, do it for love
Do it, do it, do it for love
(yeah, yeah, yeah)

When you showed up
Power over me to make my heart knock
Giving me a reason that is so real
(so real)
My love for you, unstoppable
Unstoppable this feeling that you gave me

Now that I leave it all behind
Baby, can't you see?
I'm in a different state of mind
Felt the beat was changing
When you came into my life
For finally I see the life
From deep inside the underground I rise
(yeah, yeah, yeah)
Now I

Do it, do it, do it for love
Do it, do it, do it for love
Do it, do it, do it for love
(yeah, yeah, yeah)
Do it, do it, do it for love
Do it, do it, do it for love
Do it, do it, do it for love
(yeah, yeah, yeah)
A lightning bolt that caught my eye
Loose sparks, the flash got me flying high
And we doing it for love
Been doing it to win
And now that we're together
Yeah I do it all for him
We can talk about the money
Talk about the fame
A book of broken promises
I do it all again
For the one who's got me found
I never let you go
Never let you down
 x2
Do it, do it, do it for love
Do it, do it, do it for love
Do it, do it, do it for love
Do it, do it, do it for love
Do it, do it, do it for love
Do it, do it, do it for love
