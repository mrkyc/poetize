If you really wanna know me go download me

I caught you staring, so apparent
That there's something you need
To shock your system, better listen
All that's missing is me
In your rotation, get your mood racing
You better buckle up for safety, oh baby

This ain't no stereotype, best believe the hype
I'ma make the speakers shake the windows
Like an 80s rock video
As I make you cross the line
Ain't no stopping, no one's watching
Ready, set, here we go

I'ma make you go down (Down), make you go down low
Make you go, go download me (Hey)
Make you go down (Down), make you go down low
Make you go, go download me (Download me)

I'ma make you
I'ma make you (Download me)

Now you got it, I'm the hottest
Got just screaming my name
Wanna get me on your desktop
Only one click away
So don't relax so soon, you gotta have this
The moment that I drop it, boy
It's gonna be a classic

Ain't no stereotype, best believe the hype
You can be the DJ, I can be your number one record, babe
You control the fader
Turn me up now, make it loud
You can spin me 'round and 'round, woah

I'ma make you go down (Down), make you go down low
Make you go, go download me (Hey)
Make you go down (Down), make you go down low
Make you go, go download me

I'ma make you go download me (Make you go, make you go)
I'ma make you go download me (Make you go, make you go)
I'ma keep, I'ma keep doing, I'ma keep
I'ma keep doing what I'm doing 'cause I'm doing it well
I'ma keep doing what I'm doing 'cause I'm doing it well

Make you go down, make you go down low
Make you go, go download me (Hey)
Make you go down (Down), make you go down low
Make you go, go download me

Download me, download me
If you really wanna know me
Go download me
Download me, download me
If you really wanna know me
