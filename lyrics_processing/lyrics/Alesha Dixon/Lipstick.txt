I said are you ready? (Uh)
Yeah, hey, come on
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Let's do it (Wow, whoa, yeah)
Are you ready? (Wow, whoa, yeah)
All my ladies (Let's do it)
Come on (Hey)

I know the girls inside, they wanna get on with the ladies
But there are always fellas there to stir and make you crazy
They try to get you flaky
Can't find no buts, no maybes
You think that girl's a traitor
But that man's the instigator

Turning up with your jewellery on
Making moves with your lipstick on
Want some of that cushy stuff?
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh
Let's jump when the music's on
All my girls living up till dawn
Want a little bit? Sing this song
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh
You might also like
Why do you think that every girl out there's your enemy?
You're looking at her with the green eye filled with jealousy
It's not the way it's supposed to be
So c'mon ladies, dance with me
And I'll tell ya no
N-n-n-n-n-no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

Turning up with your jewellery on (Oh, yeah)
Making moves with your lipstick on
Want some of that cushy stuff?
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh
Let's jump when the music's on
All my girls living up till dawn
Want a little bit? Sing this song
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh

Uh, wow!

Feel the rhythm in your body, gotta lose control
All my ladies stick together, we'll get on a roll
Feel it in your soul
If you wanna get on down I think it's time to look around
We're all the same, yeah
Oh, you gotta think about it
You're beating up yourself
Turning up with your jewellery on (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Making moves with your lipstick on
Want some of that cushy stuff?
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh
Let's jump when the music's on
All my girls living up till dawn
Want a little bit? Sing this song
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh

Turning up with your jewellery on
Making moves with your lipstick on
Want some of that cushy stuff?
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh
Let's jump when the music's on
All my girls living up till dawn
Want a little bit? Sing this song
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh

Wow, whoa, yeah
Wow, whoa, yeah
Want some of that cushy stuff?
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh
Wow, whoa, yeah
Wow, whoa, yeah
Want a little bit? Sing this song
Damn it!
