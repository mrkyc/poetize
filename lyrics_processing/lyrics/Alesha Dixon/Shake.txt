Little lady with electric fever
All the guys, they run and hide
They're afraid of this pioneer
But peek a boo, I see you
Don't hold me down, I'm irrepressible
Dangerous ground, stop bossing me around

The only time you can tell me what do is
When we're dancing
The only time you can tell me what do is
When we're dancing

Take this chance right now to be my leader
Lay it on me, wow, make me smile from ear to ear
Shake me up and break me down
I've got my dancing shoes on so make me move
'Til I cry out like a hound

A pretty little bird sitting in her birdcage
Should be up in the air to fly
Now you're here trying to clip these wings
But that won't do, who the hell are you?
I'll say it loud, step back from the scene of the crime
I won't allow, stand behind the yellow line

The only time you can tell me what do is
When we're dancing
The only time you can tell me what do is
When we're dancing

Take this chance right now to be my leader
Lay it on me, wow, make me smile from ear to ear
Shake me up and break me down
I've got my dancing shoes on so make me move
'Til I cry out like a hound

Shake your pepper, shake your tail feather
Shake your money maker, hell even shake your grandma
Let it all hang out and just scream and shout
Like me, like me, like me

Take this chance right now to be my leader
Lay it on me, wow, make me smile from ear to ear
Shake me up and break me down
I've got my dancing shoes on so make me move
