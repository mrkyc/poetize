Yeah, yeah, yeah, hey, hey
I used to be so boring
Staying in bed all morning
No longer I'm the one who's letting me down
Now I'm proud and stepping out of my house
So now I do a little shopping
Buying little dress I'd be wanting
Gonna buy it, gonna wear right now
Whatever makes me happy
Didn't like my photo, I'm loving it now
I'm looking in my mirror, I'm checking me out
Finally ready to get up, I'm taking control, hey
My ladies, let's play
Out all night, yelling, shouting
Wear that smile, I like what I see
Always, always
We're gonna do, do, do it our way
Feel so hot, lipstick's brighter
Who, what, where is rocking with me
Always, always
We're gonna do, do, do it our way

Easy here to be someone than to be me
Now I know what I want out of life
It's bright colors so my body can't hide
And now I wear a little make-up
Taking center stage here, I'm made up
And now I'm doing what I wanted at last
Whatever makes me happy
Didn't like my photo, I'm loving it now
I'm looking in my mirror, I'm checking me out
Finally ready to get up, I'm taking control, hey
My ladies, let's play
Out all night, yelling, shouting
Wear that smile, I like what I see
Always, always
We're gonna do, do, do it our way
Feel so hot, lipstick's brighter
Who, what, where is rocking with me
Always, always
We're gonna do, do, do it our way
Throw out the roof, live for today, life is a game you just gotta play
Always, always, always
Lay your hair down, do it always, life is a game, now you just gotta play
Always, always, always
Out all night, yelling, shouting
Wear that smile, I like what I see
Always, always
We're gonna do, do, do it our way
Feel so hot, lipstick's brighter
Who, what, where is rocking with me
Always, always
We're gonna do, do, do it our way
Out all night, yelling, shouting
Wear that smile, I like what I see
Always, always
We're gonna do, do, do it our way
Feel so hot, lipstick's brighter
Who, what, where is rocking with me
Always, always
