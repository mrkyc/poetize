Skyscrapers don't mean a lot
The way you elevate and turn me up
You push me up to the highest spot
All you got, don't ever stop

Your beat's so strong, it really turns me over
Feel it rushing inside my veins
Those deep foundations you're building under
Putting rocks inside of me

The way you lift me up, I feel so high
The way you love me, I can touch the sky
Put me right on top of the world
Like I'm the tallest girl, tallest girl (Yeah)
Like I'm the tallest girl, tallest girl (Yeah)

You can't fake this chemistry
It's real love with you and me
Going up in a fantasy
Cruising at thirty thousand feet

Your beat's so strong, it really turns me over
Feel it rushing inside my veins (Oh, yeah)
Those deep foundations you're building under
Putting rocks inside of me
You might also like
The way you lift me up, I feel so high
The way you love me, I can touch the sky
Put me right on top of the world
The way you lift me up, I feel so high
The way you love me, I can touch the sky
Put me right on top, standing right on top
Like I'm the tallest girl, tallest girl (Yeah)
Like I'm the tallest girl, tallest girl (Yeah)

Your beat's so strong, it really turns me over
Feel it rushing inside my veins
Those deep foundations you're building under
Make me feel like the tallest girl
Feel like the tallest girl
Tallest girl, tallest girl
Tallest girl, tallest girl

The way you lift me up, I feel so high
The way you love me, I can touch the sky
Put me right on top of the world
The way you lift me up, I feel so high
The way you love me, I can touch the sky
Put me right on top, standing right on top
Like I'm the tallest girl, tallest girl (I'm the tallest, the tallest girl)
