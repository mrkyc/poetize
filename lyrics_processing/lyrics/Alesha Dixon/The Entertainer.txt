Let the lights light up
Let the cold get warm (warm up)
You think you've had it all
But you ain't never had anything before, had anything before
Eye line is like a solider
I'm military every more is solar
Put it on a guarantee
That you ain't never seen nothing like me, seen nothing like me

Make you laugh along, I'll sing your song, we can go go
You wanna piece of the pie, Mr Diamond Eye
What you wanna know
Come in a little bit closer, I'm not a poster through your window
I'm the real thing
Ladies and Gentlemen introducing...

I'm the entertainer (entertainer), entertainer (entertainer)
Each time I begin, I perform till the end
I'm the entertainer (entertainer), entertainer (entertainer)
When I win you round, I'll take my bow
I'm the entertainer (Ha ha ha, ha ha ha)
I'm the entertainer (Ha ha ha, ha ha ha)

Keep the pace, a leap of faith
Take a count to 10, from alpha to omega
Close your eyes don't blink, blink, blink
Baby don't you think think
I'm the Queen of Hearts but only yours
When I take it down and bring you up, ah
Follow me like a puppet on a string
Anything I do you'll be doing it again and again and again

Make you laugh along, I'll sing your song, we can go go
You wanna piece of the pie, Mr Diamond Eye
