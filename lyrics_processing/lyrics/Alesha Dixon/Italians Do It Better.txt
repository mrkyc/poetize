Let's get creative, thinking you could be my Romeo tonight
I bet you wanna taste it, I got what you been looking for
Now come with me, alright, let's get creative
Think of all the nights we'd like to do and say to get syncopated
Body close to body 'til we're harmony
They say

Italians do it better
Italians do it better (they say)
Italians do it better
You prove 'em wrong, you do it better
Because everything I want, I get (ooh yes)
And baby baby, yeah you're next, you be!
Everything I want, I get (ooh yes)
Tell me if you can handle it

Slow down, I think I love this, baby
Throw down, don't keep me waiting
All night, I know you want this, baby
Not playing around, hear what I'm saying
They say...

Italians do it better
Italians do it better (they say)
Italians do it better
You prove 'em wrong, you do it better
Because everything I want, I get (ooh yes)
And baby baby, yeah you're next, you be!
Everything I want, I get (ooh yes)
Tell me if you can handle it

Cos lipstick's all about the kissing
Baby feel this, ain't got time for hugging
Come on, take it, want you more than ever
Make me feel alive, feel the vibe

Italians do it better
Italians do it better (they say)
Italians do it better
You prove 'em wrong, you do it better
Because everything I want, I get (ooh yes)
And baby baby, yeah you're next, you be!
Everything I want, I get (ooh yes)
Tell me if you can handle it

Oh ah, I'm the girl who can't say no
When it's you who says 'let's go'
Keep this smile upon my face
Don't let it go because it feels good
Don't let it go because it feels good

Italians do it better
Italians do it better (they say)
Italians do it better
You prove 'em wrong, you do it better
Because everything I want, I get (ooh yes)
And baby baby, yeah you're next, you be!
Everything I want, I get (ooh yes)
