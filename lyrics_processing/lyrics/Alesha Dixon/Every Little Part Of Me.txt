Can we really do this?
No, no, not, not, not, not me
I never saw me falling hard
Got me like I knew it

Put my hands up, put my, put my hands up
Put my hands up, put my, put my hands up
And now I see

I wanna feel your kiss for real
Wanna feel your kiss for real (Ooh-oh, ooh-oh)
I wanna feel your kiss for real
