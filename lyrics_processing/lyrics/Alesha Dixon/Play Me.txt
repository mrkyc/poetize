Baby baby, oh
Do you want to see me?
Never really want to fight the feeling
And I like the colour of your eyes
Baby baby
Many times the words are spoken
Complicated but I'm broken
No doubt somebody will decide

Play me, and strum me like a guitar
Play me, you make me wanna ooh ah
Play me, oh baby baby, keep me moving on and on and on
Play me, and strum me like a guitar
Play me, you make me wanna ooh ah
Play me, oh baby baby, keep me moving on and on and on

Maybe you don't wanna be here
Cos time after time gets riddled
And I know the price you've paid turn away
Someday, everything you want and desire
To find another way move higher
Cos I know the price you've paid turn away
You might also like
Play me, and strum me like a guitar
Play me, you make me wanna ooh ah
Play me, oh baby baby, keep me moving on and on and on
Play me, and strum me like a guitar
Play me, you make me wanna ooh ah
Play me, oh baby baby, keep me moving on and on and on

Maybe you don't wanna be here
Cos everything we do gets mirrored
And I know the price you've paid turn away
Someday, everything you want and desire
To find another way move higher
Cos I know the price you've paid turn away

Play me, and strum me like a guitar
Play me, you make me wanna ooh ah
Play me, oh baby baby, keep me moving on and on and on
Play me, and strum me like a guitar
Play me, you make me wanna ooh ah
Play me, oh baby baby, keep me moving on and on and on

It's a flashback, baby, woo woo woo
You got me seeing things I never should see before
And now I flash back, I've hit the roof
And now you're loving it and you're wanting it
I'm not losing it over you boy
Flash baby woo woo woo
You got me seeing things I never should see before
And now I flash back, I've hit the roof
And now you're loving it and you're wanting it
I'm not losing it over you boy
Play me, and strum me like a guitar
Play me, you make me wanna ooh ah
Play me, oh baby baby, keep me moving on and on and on
Play me, and strum me like a guitar
Play me, you make me wanna ooh ah
