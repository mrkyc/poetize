Old man Wrigley lived in that white house
Down the street where I grew up
My mama used to send me over with things
We struck a friendship up
I spent a few long summers
Out on his old porch swing

Said he was in the war when in the Navy
Lost his wife, lost his baby
Broke down and asked him one time
"How you keep from goin' crazy?"
He said, "I'll see my wife and son in just a little while"
I asked him what he meant, he looked at me and smiled

Said, "I raise my hands, bow my head
I'm findin' more and more truth
In the words written in red
They tell me that there's more to life
Than just what I can see, I believe"

A few years later I was off at college
Talkin' to mom on the phone one night
Gettin' all caught up on the gossip
The ins and outs of the small town life
She said, "Oh, by the way son
Old man Wrigley has died"

Later on that night
I laid there thinkin' back
Thought about a couple long-lost summers
I didn't know whether to cry or laugh
If there ever was anybody
Deserved a ticket to the other side
It'd be that sweet old man
Who looked me in the eye

Said, "I raise my hands, bow my head
I'm findin' more and more truth
In the words written in red
They tell me that there's more to life
Than just what I can see..."

I can't quote the book
The chapter or the verse
You can't tell me it all ends
In a slow ride in a hearse
You know I'm more and more convinced
The longer that I live
Yeah, this can't be... no, this can't be
No, this can't be, no this can't be
No, this can't be all there is
Lord, I raise my hands, bow my head (Bow my head)
Oh, I'm findin' more and more truth
In the words written in red
They tell me that there's more to life
Than just what I can see, I believe

Oh, I... I believe
I believe
I believe
(I believe)
I believe
(I believe)
I believe, yeah
(I believe)
I believe
