Oh, oh, mmm
Yeah, yeah

Once I thought that love was something that can never work
Never knew that I could feel this much
But this yearning in the deep part of my heart for her
Is more than a reaction to her touch
It's a perfect passion and I can't get enough

The way she looks, the way she laughs
The way she loves with all she has
There ain't nothing 'bout her that don't do something for me
Her kiss, her cry
The way she moves when she walks by
There ain't nothing 'bout her (Nothin' 'bout her)
That don't do something for me
Whoa-oh-oh
Oh, oh

In my life, I've been hammered by some heavy blows
That never knocked me off my feet
All she's gotta do is smile at me and down I go (Down I go)
Baby, it's no mystery why I surrender
Oh, she's got everything

The way she looks, the way she laughs
The way she loves with all she has
There ain't nothing 'bout her that don't do something for me
Her kiss, her cry
The way she moves when she walks by
There ain't nothing 'bout her (Nothin' 'bout her)

I love her attitude, her rose tattoo, her every thought
Her smiling lips, and girl, the list goes on and on and on
On and on

The way she looks, the way she laughs
The way she loves with all she has
There ain't nothing bout her that don't do something for me
Mmm, Her kiss, her cry
The way she moves when she walks by
There's ain't nothing 'bout her (Nothin' 'bout her)
That don't do something for me
The way she looks, the way she laughs
The way she loves with all she has
Oh, her dance, her drive, how she makes me feel alive
There ain't nothing 'bout her that don't do something for me
The way she talks and teases me, but now I think she sees
There's ain't nothing 'bout her (nothin' 'bout her)
That don't do something for me
The way she kiss, way she cry
The way she moves when she walks by
Don't do something for me
No, there ain't nothin' 'bout her
(Her kiss, her drive
She make me feel alive)
