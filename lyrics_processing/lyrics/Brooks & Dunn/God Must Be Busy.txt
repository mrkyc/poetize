That anchorman
Says they're fighting again somewhere in the Middle East
The world prays for peace
There's a single mom
Just got laid off went and lost her job to some foreign hands
In some far away land

Last night in Oklahoma, some twister took thirteen
And they're prayin', they find the missin' three
God must be busy

That highway sign
Went from slow ahead to traffic's dead
Thought it couldn't get worse
Then that Amber alert
They say she's four, Colorado plates, headed out of state in a Chevy van
It's hard to understand

You can see it in the faces, of all those highway strangers
They're prayin' that God keeps girl from danger
God must be busy

And I know in the big picture, I'm just a speck of sand
And God's got better things to do, than to look out for one man
I know He's heard my prayers, 'cause He hears everything
He just ain't answered back, or He'd bring you back to me
God must be busy

That evenin' news
Ain't much changed, pretty much the same since I left home
Yeah, that war's still on
They found that little girl
She was soaking wet, half scared to death on the side of some road
Them prayers work you know

And the blood and the crips are at it, and there's a killer drought down south
And old folks can't afford the drugs, they can't live without
God must be busy

And I know in the big picture, I'm just a speck of sand
And God's got better things to do, than to look out for one man
I know He's heard my prayers, 'cause He hears everything
He just ain't answered back, or He'd bring you back to me
God must be busy

Says the fightin's worse, cities burn in the Middle East
