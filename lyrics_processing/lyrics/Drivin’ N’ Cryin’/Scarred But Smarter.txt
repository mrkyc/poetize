I'm out of hope
Of what should be of thee I spoke
Good times for the undeserved
Bad times for the ones who work
I said poor man, rich man, blind man, dead man
Hoped for more than they had all planned
Just then they suffered a serious blow
As the real world cut the line they hold
I said nobody said it would be fair
They warned you before you went out there
There's always a chance to get restarted
To a new world, new life
Scarred but smarter
Is it right to wish the poor man rich
Is it right to wish the rich man poor
To hope all that's well is fair ends fair
To wish thy neighbor's life to despair
Being so mad that I start crying
No pay off for all my trying
To do it right - to never fail
Wishing for a fairy tale
You might also likeNobody said it would be fair
They warned me before I went out there
There's always a chance to get restarted
To a new world, new life
Scarred but smarter
But when my life it turns all around
Jobs and things to do that I've found
I think how foolish I must have looked
To think I could be down for good
Nobody said it would be fair
But in the end I think it is
Karma, justice - whatever you call it
It's really there - just keep looking for it
Nobody said it would be fair
But in the end I think it is
Karma, justice - whatever you call it
It's really there - just keep looking for it
Nobody said it would be fair
But in the end I think it is
Karma, justice - whatever you call it
It's really there - just keep looking for it
Nobody said it would be fair
They warned me before I went out there
There's always a chance to get restarted
To a new world, new life
