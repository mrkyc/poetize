I grew up just west of the tracks
Holding me to hold me back
Around your door, she's calling out my name
She said, "Son, won't you go outside
I got a man coming over tonight"
The seventh one in seven days

So I go down to the parking lot
Hang around all my friends
Roam the street 'til dawn breaks again
I come in at 5 A.M. and she is waiting for me
She said, "Where have you been?" I said, "I was out"
She said, "You're no good 'cause you're running without love"

'Cause I'm going straight to hell
Just like my mama says
'Cause I'm going straight to hell
'Cause I'm going straight to hell
Just like my mama says
'Cause I'm going straight to hell

The black widow and the ladies' man
Met down at the laundromat
And tried to make me understand
The neighbors were all in a stir
About what they might have heard
And runnin' down they shouted out it seemed
You might also like
Next door, a girl she lives
About the same age as me
And asked me to come upstairs for a see
Just then her mother burst in
Said, "You're the son of that bitch in the wind
Get out of my house and hit the road"
And I kept falling like a Rolling Stones song

'Cause I'm going straight to hell
Just like my mama says
'Cause I'm going straight to hell
'Cause I'm going straight to hell
Just like my mama says
'Cause I'm going straight to hell

The stars came out and warned me so
As I walked on down the road
Fifty bucks and a suitcase steered me clear
She took my hand as we walked into the sun
A new day's promise had begun
We'll make it alone whether you like it or not
I turned around and shouted, "Help me, mother"
'Cause I'm going straight to hell
Just like my mama says
'Cause I'm going straight to hell
'Cause I'm going straight to hell
Just like my mama says
'Cause I'm going straight to hell
'Cause I'm going straight to hell
Just like my mama says
'Cause I'm going straight to hell
