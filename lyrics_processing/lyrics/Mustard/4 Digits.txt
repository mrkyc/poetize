(Mustard on the beat, ho)

When I be in the shower, she know that I leave it alone
So for at least a half an hour, she be tryna break into my phone, oh
I don't know what I did to make her feel insecure
But she gon' have to trust me 'cause I ain't even doing no wrong

She won't ever get them four digits, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ahh
No, she won't ever get them four digits, ah-ah-ahh-ah-ah-ah
She about to lock my phone, tryna unlock my phone
(Unlock my phone)
She about to lock my phone, tryna unlock my phone
She won't ever get them four digits

She so damn nosy, yeah
Don't know why she be listening to her friends
That's probably why she on me, yeah
'Cause they niggas be cheating on them
She just wanna be up in my photos
She just wanna be up in my videos
She just wanna be up in my emails and my DM's
