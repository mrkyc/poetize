This shit breaking a nigga heart (Yeah)
The person they want a nigga to be (Where that shit go?)
This shit breaking my heart (The gang)
This shit you never see (10 Summers, yeah)
Mustard on the beat, ho

Yeah, skinny jeans on me with extendo
Hanging with them young niggas, flocking, pulling kick doors
Yeah, we was hanging at the bando
Fully loaded clip, went and snatched up a Benzo
Flew them Dracos out of LA on a PJ
And we taking off, no delay
No delay, we taking up the murder rate
Everything from chinchos to parquet

Audemar baguette, have it tinted, better reli-lax
Money coming through, blue hundreds on impact
Married to the game, cop new pink stones
No new friends, cop five new phone
Aston money, need to be the right one
Double up my cups, ooh-ooh, pop one
Cop new drops, upper echelon
Hustlers dream to live lavish
In the middle of the night go to Saturn
Two-tone Patek, go spazzing
Ten brand new whips in traffic
No evidence, no lacking
Bentley routine, go re-up
Fully loaded magazine when you see us
It's a full time job tryna stay on point
Glock four-zero, hollow points, yeah

Yeah, skinny jeans on me with extendo
Hanging with them young niggas, flocking, pulling kick doors
Yeah, we was hanging at the bando
Fully loaded clip, went and snatched up a Benzo
Flew them Dracos out of LA on a PJ
And we taking off, no delay
No delay, we taking up the murder rate
Everything from chinchos to parquet

Game chose me, I ain't choose this
Empty out the clip before you lose this
If your city on your back and your shoulder
You gotta rally, you gotta spray like a soldier
Vultures, they come with the territory
V12, your motor is mandatory
Whipping the soda, be cool, do the speed
Make it on Interstate 10 and achieve
This is not regular time, you gon' bleed
Came from the game, ain't no trust, pushing keys
From the cook up to the tour bus
You see how far ambition took us
We bring all the hood niggas with us
They non-believers, we made 'em believe us
From my block to your block, they love homicides
Looking like a foreign dealership outside, yeah
Skinny jeans on me with extendo
Hanging with them young niggas, flocking, pulling kick doors
Yeah, we was hanging at the bando
Fully loaded clip, went and stashed up a benzo
Flew the dracos out at LA on a PJ
And we're taking off, no delay
No delay, we're taking off the murder rate
Everything from chinchos to parquet

Interstate 10
We risked it all to get it in
And we would risk it again
It's breaking my heart, with this currency throwin'
It's breaking my heart
It's tearing me up, what you're doing to me
It's tearing me apart
This greed and this envy, I don't know where to go
