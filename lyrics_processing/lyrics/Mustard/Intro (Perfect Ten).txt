Wait, hol' up, I'm finna turn this bitch up
(Mustard on the beat, ho)

Ridin' through the city where it's litty
Countin' hundreds, countin' fifties, I like bitches with big titties
Ridin', ridin', ridin' through the city where it's litty
Countin' hundreds, countin' fifties, I like bitches with big titties

I'm finna shoot a porn flick, bitch, come get your cameo
She got a baby daddy and a kid, but she ain't tell me though
She runnin' from the D, oh my God, she's a scary ho
I kill pussy, I hope she got insurance for the burial
Wait, hol' up, how you even know me? "Oh, I heard you on the radio"
My pockets on FatBoy, shout out to Lil Terrio
The hardest niggas always singing louder than the stereo
Commit a crime, then starting pointing fingers like, "There he go"
I be fresh to death, fly as hell when I walk through
Why niggas hatin' on me that I ain't never even talked to?
Eeny meeny miny mo, nigga, who are you?
Oh, you still mad from high school 'cause the coach didn't start you
I take my hoes to Toys"R"Us, why? 'Cause they childish
You gon' find a better nigga? Baby, I highly doubt it
Just like an old ass whip, these hoes got high mileage
Stop gossipin', bitch, you still live' in public housing
Boy, bye, she only fuck with niggas with the blue check
I ain't fuckin' with her even though I got the blue check
On Instagram and my bank account, big blue check
I'm a cold nigga, when I come around she need the crewneck
Knock 'em down like dominoes, I'm freaky, yeah, who next?
Even though our convos be dry, I got you wet
I gave her good D, now she braggin' in the groupchat
Now she always poppin' up like a new text
I got a mic, come sing, you can be my Whitney Houston
I don't wanna lie, but just like Nike, I'm tryna do it
Your secrets safe with me 'cause I don't care 'bout who you screwing
The people say I'm famous, really I be really coolin'
I'm a fool, but that jewelry look fake, who you foolin'?
The niggas that be flexin' on the 'Gram be really losin'
Hey, tough guy, don't play with guns if you ain't really shootin'
Stop playin', them niggas in LA be really true
