Mustard on the beat, ho

It's been a long time, a time I shouldn't left you
Without a Mustard beat to step to
Flex to, let loose, finesse to
Nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, bang your set too
It's been a long time, a time I shouldn't left you
Without a Mustard beat to step to
Flex to, let loose, finesse to
Nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, bang your set too

Aw damn, no they didn't
Three Musketeers back together and they winning
And they getting too much money
Them turnt niggas rich then the crew must love me
4Hunnid chain by the tummy
Skinny jeans, thing hang by the tummy
Don't underestimate me buddy
This 4 pound bark I had to tell it hush puppy
You chasing ghosts like Pac-Man
We chasing being rich ass black men
I got dough but I gotta keep this dough coming
I don't rock designer, I design 4Hunnid
I must be an entrepreneur or something
Gotta fuck your bitch, playing, always tryna pursue something
Me and Ty was bool, me and Mustard fell off
But now we picking up where we left off

I was up late night always trying to stare (Ooh yeah)
Always seen the big picture
Always ten toes, stomp down like a real nigga (Ooh yeah)
Had to make my own rules
Had to set examples for my young bools (Young bools)
Sucker nigga do when he can (What he can)
Rich nigga do what he want to (Yeah, yeah)
