Bad little nigga
Space coupe, panoramic glass in the middle
Jewelry box lookin' like a bag full of Skittles
Underdog, but that bag done got bigger
Owner of the house, none of my cars are a rental
Room for her and her friends, I pay for all their incidentals
Hope you comprehend, I do my songs without a pencil
She wanna fuck again, I look for time in my agenda
I stuff cash in my denim
And I'm strapped, I'll hit 'em
I can't be a victim, nah, I can't beat the system
And I always put it on, Gucci on my little ones
Know some niggas did me a wrong, I never forgive 'em
Me and my whole crew enormous, you niggas little
FN and the mini carbons, don't need a hitter
I stay high, I smoke a garden, weed in my liver
