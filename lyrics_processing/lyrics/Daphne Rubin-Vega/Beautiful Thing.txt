Moving sideways like a twisted up vine
I've watched the years change all that is around me
Sun and the wind swept all of it away
But I'm still thankful for each and every day
The rain always seems to come just at the right time
Feed my roots so I can see the sky again
All I need is the earth that I stand on
I try to keep my feet planted that way
I'm just happy to be here another day
It's a beautiful thing
And don't try to change it
It's a beautiful thing
And everything is cool
It's a beautiful thing
I know it sounds old
But if it ain't broke don't mess with a beautiful thing
There's people who'd die for you
And some who just don't care
We're all in the middle with our own cross to bear
I wanna let you know how it is with me
I look you in the eye and hear myself say
I wouldn't wanna be any other way

And don't try to change it
It's a beautiful thing
And everything is cool
It's a beautiful thing
I know it sounds old
But if it ain't broke don't mess with a beautiful thing
Don't mess with me
Don't mess with me
Don't look no better than to mess with a beautiful thing
There's no reason why we can't live in a perfect world
It's a beautiful thing
And don't try to change it
It's a beautiful thing
And everything is cool
It's a beautiful thing
I know it sounds old but
If it ain't broke
Don't try to fix it
It's a beautiful thing
And don't try to change it
It's a beautiful thing
And everything is cool
It's a beautiful thing
I know it sounds old but
If it ain't broke
Don't try to fix it
If it ain't broke
Don't try to fix it
If it ain't broke
