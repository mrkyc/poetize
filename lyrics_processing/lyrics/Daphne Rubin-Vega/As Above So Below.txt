I'm gonna do a dance in the midnight
I don't go with the flow
Take me to that place I know
Underground is my home
Sometimes I live there
It's where I go
Where the skies indigle
There I have my fun
As Above So below
But I don't do business with the sun
I'm gonna do a dance in the midnight
I'm gonna do a dance in the firelight
I'm gonna do a dance with the midnight
I'm gonna do a dance in the firelight
I'm gonna raise up my arms and call to the night
I'm gonna make it a point to make it all right
I'm gonna howl at the moon and worship the sea
I'm gonna give up my soul and let it all be
And when horizon comes light all my work is done
Cause I don't do business with the sun

I'm gonna do a dance with the firelight
I'm gonna do a dance in the midnight
I'm gonna do a dance in the firelight
I'm gonna tear off my body and fly in the air
Cause I don't care
I don't care
I don't care
I don't care
I don't care
I don't care
I don't care
I don't care
I don't care
I don't care
I don't care

I'm gonna do a dance in the midnight

But I don't do business with the sun
I'm gonna do a dance in the midnight
