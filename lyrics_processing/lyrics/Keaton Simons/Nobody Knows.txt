That's my wake-up call
I'm slowly falling back to sleep
Just in time
For a mirror full of dreams
To wash me clean
I reflect upon
This burning secret
That we keep
Once again
We tell our friends
There's nothing going on
Sure, sure, honey
Haven't seen you around
That's right
I've heard you've been
Out of town
With some guy
Who looks
A lot like me
Can't you see that
Nobody knows you
Like I do
We can let them wonder
Everyone thinks
They know the truth
People never understand
Better we lie
And play it cool
So when I see you
It's just
Sure, sure, honey, honey
We both know
That this is just pretend
You might also likeLa la
Wink
That's our signal
I leave by the back door
Know that we're gonna' meet
In an hour
So prepare your alibi
You've got things to do
Stayin' with a friend tonight
As for me
Well I say
You can call me friend
That's alright
Sure, sure, honey
Guess I'll see you around
Meanwhile
You'll be off getting down
With some guy who looks
A lot like me
Can't you see that
I know every inch of you
But I will barely
Speak to you tonight
That's just how it is gotta be
Everybody wants you
But you're coming home with me
Nobody knows you
Like I do
We can let them wonder
Everyone thinks
They know the truth
People never understand
Better we lie
And play it cool
So when I see you
It's just
Sure, sure, honey, honey
Sure, sure
Honey, honey
Nobody knows you
Like I do
We can let them wonder
Everyone thinks
They know the truth
People never understand
Better we lie
And play it cool
So when I see you
It's just
Sure, sure, honey, honey
We both know
