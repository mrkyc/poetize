It's like I'm being torn apart, all this beautiful pain
I know you wanna be with me, but you gotta go to him
Freedom isn't really free, you sink before you learn to swim
And I shudder in my sleep, I can hardly close my eyes
Then I wake up in a dream, free now from a life of compromise
Well you never lost but you never won, cause you never fought and you never
Moved on
You never lost but you never won, cause you never fought and you never
Moved on
Don't be afraid of looking back, no, everybody has a past
Now you got my heart racing in just a few dates and I wanna be patient so
This doesn't fade away
If you're gonna save a life, maybe it should be your own
Cause baby we don't have much time, before we go stumbling home
And I know that we just met, but what I never understood
How can something be that bad, when it feels this good
And I shudder in my sleep, I can hardly close my eyes
Then I wake up in a dream, free now from a life of compromise
Oh you never lost but you never won, cause you never fought and you never
Moved on
You never lost but you never won, cause you never fought and you never
Moved on
Don't be afraid of looking back, no, everybody has a past
Now you got my heart racing in just a few dates and I wanna be patient so
This doesn't fade away

No so this doesn't fade away
Well you never lost but you never won, cause you never fought and you never
Moved on
You never lost but you never won, cause you never fought and you never
Moved on
You never lost but you never won, cause you never fought and you never
Moved on
You never lost but you never won, cause you never fought and you never
Moved on
Don't be afraid of looking back, no, everybody has a past
Now you got my heart racing in just a few dates and I wanna be patient so
This doesn't fade
You got my heart racing in just a few dates, I wanna be patient so this
Doesn't fade away
Why's it gotta be so hard, why's it gotta be this way
