Why's it gotta be so hard
Why's it gotta be this way
It's like I'm being torn apart
By all this beautiful pain
I know you wanna be with me
But you gotta go to him
Freedom isn't really free
If you sink before you learn to swim

And I shudder in my sleep
I can hardly close my eyes
Then I wake up in a dream
Free now from a life of compromise

Well you never lost but you never won
'Cause you never fought and you never moved on
You never lost but you never won
'Cause you never fought and you never moved on
Don't be afraid of looking back
Everybody has a past
Now you got my heart racing in just a few days
And I wanna be patient so this doesn't fade away
You might also like
If you're gonna save a life
Maybe it should be your own
Cause baby we don't have much time
Before we go stumbling home
And I know that we just met
But what I never understood
How can something be that bad
When it feels this good

And I shudder in my sleep
I can hardly close my eyes
Then I wake up in a dream
Free now from a life of compromise

Oh you never lost but you never won
'Cause you never fought and you never moved on
You never lost but you never won
'Cause you never fought and you never moved on
Don't be afraid of looking back, no
Everybody has a past
Now you got my heart racing in just a few days
And I wanna be patient so this doesn't fade away
No, so this doesn't fade away
No, so this doesn't fade away
Well you never lost but you never won
'Cause you never fought and you never moved on
You never lost but you never won
'Cause you never fought and you never moved on
You never lost but you never won
'Cause you never fought and you never moved on
You never lost but you never won
'Cause you never fought and you never moved on
Don't be afraid of looking back, no
Everybody has a past
Don't be afraid of looking back
Everybody has a past
Now you got my heart racing in just a few days
And I wanna be patient so this doesn't fade
You got my heart racing in just a few days
And I wanna be patient so this doesn't fade away
Why's it gotta be so hard
Why's it gotta be this way
It's like I'm being torn apart
