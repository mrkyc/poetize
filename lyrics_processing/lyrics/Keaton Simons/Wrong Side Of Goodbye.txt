At first it felt so strange
But coming clean, I've always the one who takes the blame
But now the table's turned
And I've been forced to learn
It sure is different now that I'm the one who's getting burned
I make a step in your direction
Just to find, you take
One step away
One step away
Get over it
Get on with it
I've always been the one to say
Get over it
Get on with it
One step away
One step away
Get over it
And I can't believe
I'm stuck here on the wrong side
Of goodbye
The wrong side of goodbye
So this is what it's like
I'm turning out the light
I won't lose sleep
No I won't weep
But it would just be nice
If you would call and say what happened, anyway
Well I should know
I've been a player
Guess I just got played
I make a step in your direction
Just to find, you take
One step away
One step away
Get over it
Get on with it
I've always been the one to say
Get over it
Get on with it
One step away
One step away
Get over it
And I can't believe
I'm stuck here on the wrong side of goodbye
The wrong side of goodbye
Thank you for the pain
It doesn't get me down
For once I'm not to blame
I wear it like a crown
Now I know how it feels to fall
And I will think before I turn and take the opposite direction
And I'll hit the breaks
Say, get out of my way
Get out of my way
Get over it
Get on with it
I've always been the one to say
Get over it
Get on with it
One step away
One step away
Get over it
And I can't believe
I'm stuck here on the wrong side of goodbye
The wrong side of goodbye
Get over it
Get on with it
I've always been the one to say
Get over it
Get on with it
One step away
One step away
Get over it
And I can't believe
I'm stuck here on the wrong side of goodbye
