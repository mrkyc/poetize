When I think about life
I feel out of rhythm
You know I feel out of rhythm
Feet step
Nonstop until your last breath
What are we really giving?
What are we really giving?
When we deal with what we have
Then we truly understand
There's no one idea that's right
So you gotta keep learning, observing, teach your mind to fight
Now, baby
CHORUS
You want everything
But you don't give enough away
Love to tell you how I feel
But I haven't got the heart to say
You want everything
But you don't give enough away
Love to tell you how I feel
But I haven't got the heart to say
Sometimes
When I think about love
I feel out of rhythm
You know I feel out of rhythm
Hearts beat
Faint echoes off calm streets
But they fail to deliver
You know they fail to deliver
When we deal with what we have
Then we truly understand
There's no one idea that's right
So you gotta stay determined
Concerned with
The battles you incite
Now, baby
CHORUS
You want everything
But you don't give enough away
Love to tell you how I feel
But I haven't got the heart to say
You want everything
But you don't give enough away
Love to tell you how I feel
But I haven't got the heart to say
Strong reaction
Cut the strings
Why do you want everything?
Scared of being no routine
Why do you want everything?
Tired of playing all the games
Why do you want everything?
Throw your hands up
Try to see
That you can't have everything
You want everything
But you don't give enough away
Love to tell you how I feel
But I haven't got the heart to say
You want everything
But you don't give enough
No you don't give enough
Away
Love to tell you how I feel
