I don't wanna know your name
I don't wanna feel your pain
I don't wanna be a part of
A never ending sore
I don't wanna leave you anymore
I wanna know you
Wanna to live with you
I wanna to grow on you
Wanna grow up with you
I wanna get down with you
Let's fast forward
Forget the introduction
Let's jump in
We can skip the whole production
Don't waste time with remedial seduction
Get in it, get on it
I'm here if you want it
Now
I don't wanna be without
I don't wanna take the blame
I don't wanna be attained
I don't wanna be remembered as the one who never called
I don't wanna be like that at all
I wanna know you
Wanna to live with you
I wanna to grow on you
Wanna grow up with you
I wanna get down with you
Let's fast forward
Forget the introduction
Let's jump in
We can skip the whole production
Don't waste time with remedial seduction
Get in it, get on it
I'm here if you want it
Now
I don't wanna be
Another
To hover over you
I don't wanna be
Just some lover
I can't deny
I don't wanna talk to you
I don't wanna know your name
I don't wanna feel your pain
I don't wanna be a part of a never ending sore
I don't wanna leave you
Let's fast forward
Forget the introduction
Let's jump in
We can skip the whole production
Don't waste time with remedial seduction
Get in it, get on it
I'm here if you want it
Let's fast forward
Forget the introduction
Let's jump in
We can skip the whole production
Don't waste time with remedial seduction
Get in it, get on it
I'm here if you want it
Let's
Get in it, get on it
I'm here if you want it
