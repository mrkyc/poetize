Full of holes
'Cause they remind me of the million miles that I have walked beside you
Good and bad times, we have been through
You know that car you drive keeps breaking down
It never starts
But it reminds me of you and me
In the back-seat, drivin' it home
And now I'm all, alone
What do you do?
What do you do?
When everything is broken
What do you say?
What do you say?
When no words fit the moment
'Cause you're not here and even
If you were
All I could say, is what do I do?
What do I do?
We're broken but I can't throw us away
Lookin' out the window with the scratches on it at the sun
The world looks different when you focus passed your own reflection
The sky is better twisted
Just like you and me
I miss it
You snap it, bend it, burn it
Then you find that you can't fix it
Fall back
On whatever still remains
What do you do?
What do you do?
When everything is broken
What do you say?
What do you say?
When no words fit the moment
'Cause you're not here and even if you were
All I could say, is what do I do?
What do I do?
We're broken but I can't throw us away
Breakin' you in, breakin' your heart
I was takin' it all and I tore you apart
Breakin' me in breakin' my heart
And the damage was done
But I took what you got
We were breakin' it, smashin' it takin' it
Lovin' it, hatin' it
Drivin' it
Home
And now I'm all
Now I'm all, alone
What do you do?
What do you do?
When everything is broken
What do you say?
What do you say?
When no words fit the moment
'Cause you're not here and even if
You were
All I could say, is what do I do?
What do I do?
We're broken but I can't throw us away
What do I do?
What do I do?
