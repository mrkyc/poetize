Like flowers, Make mistakes
Spend your hours livin' it down
Life's a game
A journey for us inside out
No doubt no doubt
But down the road your bound to take a different route
Where it goes nobody really knows
I've found in the end
It always comes back around
Somehow somehow
I don't know why it has to be
So black and white for you and me
When there's a million colors in between
And we could be anything
Truth ain't always what it seems
And right or wrong lacks depth to me
Fear is our only enemy
And we could be anything anything
I can feel the heaviness you keep by your side
When it's real it feels like it has multiplied
It's hard to deal
Without a friendly face in sight
But it's alright it's alright
Because to grow you've got to be alone sometimes
In the cold weathering the storm inside
So you know no matter what it's gonna be fine
Be fine so fine
I don't know why it has to be
So black and white for you and me
When there's a million colors in between
And we could be anything
Truth ain't always what it seems
And right or wrong lacks depth to me
Fear is our only enemy
And we could be anything anything
Well if love is blind how can you read the signs
And I believe in time we will see
We could be anything
If the feelings right
It's not so hard to find
And we can realize
The recipe, we could be anything
If you love someone
You've got to let them go (got to let them go)
Set them free and trust that they will ebb and flow
I don't know why it has to be
So black and white for you and me
When there's a million colors in between
And we could be anything
Truth ain't always what it seems
And right or wrong lacks depth to me
Fear is our only enemy
And we could be anything anything
I don't know why it has to be
So black and white for you and me
When there's a million colors in between
And we could be anything
Truth ain't always what it seems
And right or wrong lacks depth to me
Fear is our only enemy
And we could be anything anything
We could be we could be we could be anything
We could be we could be we could be anything
