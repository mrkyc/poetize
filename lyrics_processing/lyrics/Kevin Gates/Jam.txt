It was cool, and he'd get back on the phone
And say, "Bernadette, I got somethin' I want you to hear"
And what you do players
You get the phone, and you hold it up, to the speakers
And you let Luther do your talkin' for you
And Luther break it down like

Ridin' around in my whip, listenin' to my shit
She wanna hear track six, she told me that's her (Jam)
Baby girl said I got the title, got a nigga feelin' like Michael
Jackson, Jordan, don't matter to me, they both (Jam)
I'm all in her head, she's all in my bed
I'm locked and loaded, ready to go like a gun that don't (Jam)
I'm all in between, that's all that she needs
Her body rockin', nobody stoppin', this song is probably on (Jam)

Listen all you like
Tattoos showin' out the shower in the mirror
Go to clickin' on the lights
And this ain't what you like? (Jam)
I can lay you on your back then I hit you with the pound game
Pin you down so you can't run, in and out game
Hit you from the back, probably get you with the mouth game
Ain't nobody business, this is our thing (Jam)
Spit all in between both cheeks, now I spread 'em
Bet the neighbors know my name way you keep sayin' Kevin
Hands behind, I'ma stand behind you
Pullin' on your hair, lot of ass behind you (Jam)
Got me sayin', "Ooh, keep goin' with your moves"
Cameras by the bed, god damn, this a movie
Stuffin' you with dick while my finger in your booty
Hit you with the Ruger, the bitch don't (Jam)
Bow!

Bad, but I won't push it
Never break fly but she won't quit lookin'
Look at her dress, look at her thighs
No draws underneath with the slits in the side
Squintin' my eyes, locked in with a notion
If she squint back, hmm, bet I'm approachin'
Playin' my song, slow dancin' to "Strokin'"
Track number seven, told me it was her (Jam)
Leave your keys with your friends, oh, you rolled with your friends?
Start the car and I get in, we rollin'
Lit the leaf, hit the green, we smokin'
Slow motion, coupe just floatin'
Kissin' on her finger with my hand on her breast
Tongue doin' circles 'round the ring of her nipple
"Would You Mind" on repeat but she might be trippin'
Really, not really, sayin' it was her (Jam)
Hit her up late night, "Come through"
Hit her up late night, "Come through"
She text back, "OMW"
Text back, "OMW"
I'ma show her what this pipe game do
Show her what this pipe game do
I'ma hit it 'til the sky turn blue
'Til the sky turn blue (Jam)
And I'ma jam on it, jam on it
Jam on it, jam on it
I'ma jam on it, jam on it, jam on it
I'ma jam on it, jam on it, jam on it

And I got her ridin' around in my whip, listenin' to my shit
She wanna hear track six, she told me that's her jam
Baby girl said I got the title, got a nigga feelin' like Michael
(Feelin' so good, feelin' he like would)
Jackson, Jordan, don't matter to me, they both jam
I'm all in her head, she's all in my bed
I'm locked and loaded, ready to go like a gun that don't j-j-jam
I'm all in between, that's all that she needs
