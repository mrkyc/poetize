And here with your ho, could get her to go fetch it (Here boy)
On the scale, but I call it the ruler
And that's what I'm using my method of measure (Streets)
Got it jumping up out of the pot and
My clique-ity clucking surrounding my property (Boom)
I meant to say my clientickity (For real?)
Numbers official retickity
Out the mud, nobody did shit for me
Arrogant often I'm bigity (Shit)
All about money, like what done got into me
Breaking down bricks and we blowing good grigity
Say you ain't feeling me, oughta try killing me
Neighborhood love me, it's hard to get rid of me (Brr)
My baby mothers are sick of me
I put that dick on 'em
Now they ridiculously saying, that when I don't come in I'm with a freak bitch
I've been chasing my paper religiously (Ooh)

Let me get off of my grind then it's silly me
No one'll pity me, coming and getting me out the mud

Trap booming hard and I'm serving out the window
Burglar barred up, with a curtain on the window
Face card worth a lot of bands in the hood
Had to leave the dice game, gotta bond-out  (Turn up)
Sunday coming up, pull the cars out, look
Another 20 grand, told my girl call Nook (What)
Post bail, what the hell got all y'all shook (Hello)
Poo hit the line in the drop
Plug went dry, had to take another route (C'mon)
Pulling up, getting it

Drop no whip, and a nigga gon' vouch (Gon' vouch)
Another 4K just stuffed in the couch
Promise I ain't tryna swag, I just got a lot of that
Anybody try me, I'ma put 'em in a body bag (Zip)

Pounds in the garbage bag
Backed in the bank, y'all leaving after dropping that (Yeah)
Call 'em back, call 'em back
Juug, no falling back (Peep)
