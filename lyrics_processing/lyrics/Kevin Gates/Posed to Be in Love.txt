Ho tell me the other day she sent a nigga to jail
Man, I thought it was legal to beat yo ho, shit it's yo ho, fuck!

Blowing up the phone, don't she see me calling her
I whip up in the driveway, she done packed up all my stuff
And I'm like what the fuck, can't even talk to her
I ain't gon' lie this pussy good, it make me feel like stalkin' her
We supposed to be in love, we posed to be in love
We supposed to be in love, till it ain't no breaking up
And we supposed to be in love, till it ain't no breaking up
Any way that we can talk about it, it ain't no walking out
We posed to be in love, Any way that we can talk about
It ain't no walking out, we posed to be in love
Any way that we can talk about it, ain't no walking out
We posed to be in love

How the fuck is you, why the fuck is you falling all in yo feelings?
No understanding I'm ignorant
You gonna probably say that I'm tripping
Throw the left hand, you duck that one
This right bitch won't miss you
Beat a bitch like Chris Brown, go back to jail, no question
No surrender, no retreat, park the whip, hop out on feet
Me and her brother juuged together
He bet not get in my business
This shit serious, if you with it, shit get injured, did I mention?
How I'm rockin', you gon' pop me or it's back to penitentiary
You might also like
Blowing up the phone, she see me calling her
I whip up in the driveway, she done packed up all my stuff
And I'm like what the fuck, can't even talk to her
I ain't gone lie this pussy good, it make me feel like stalkin' her
We supposed to be in love, we supposed to be in love
We supposed to be in love, till it ain't no breaking up
And we supposed to be in love, till it ain't no breaking up
Any way that we can talk about it, it ain't no walking out
We posed to be in love
Any way that we can talk about it, it ain't no walking out
We posed to be in love
Any way that we can talk about it, it ain't no walking out
We posed to be in love

Hop up out the shower, you got louder, I bow bow you
Ripped the gown you, had around you
Threw you down, and smelled yo flounder
If he jizz that, dick you down, I would've toilet water drowned you
I know my heart is pounding, I don't talk around a lot of niggas I don't know
I don't know, blowing up yo momma like momma
We having problems passin' by yo house like
Come outside before we get violent, lights off, mask on, silent
