Ahhhh
Own up to your bullshit
Yeah it's about that time
Damn don't you look foolish
'Cause you know, I know, you know you lyin'
Yeah right, uh huh, yeah right, mhmm
Yeah right, stop lyin'
Yeah right, uh huh, yeah right, mhmm
Yeah right, stop lyin'

Confrontation is the conversation
Your contact - erased it
Can't take it - no patience
Major mistake is me believing in you when you say shit
I thought you changed well since you can't
I can no longer take it
Go head and face it, plain and basic
Different occasions
Gave you my trust and you apologized and then betrayed it
Shame on me, further repeat, I'm all out of favors
And nothing else can save you...
Guessin' you missing integrity
Still gotta focus on what's in the head of me
Great understanding of me as a whole
Probably one of the reasons you scared of me
Fiction, no telling me, stupid expecting me
Thinking that I'ma believe in what I'm not believing
Excuse me, I'm sorry
I abruptly beg your pardon

Realest ever, relentless ever
Inevitable that I win
Never say never again
Though a facade is the way to pretend
Never be basic again
A stage ain't for the faint hearted
Processed it all, but I ain't bought it
But thank god, I can thank god
Fell in a miserable state
When no one you fuck with will look in your face
Wake up alone when the weather get lonely
And you'll be the only one that you can blame
Shit ain't the same as though when it was plain
Focusin', then it gon' harden the pain
Fuckin' with K, affect when you grindin'
I own the prize, and you're more like a lion
Soar like a eagle, without all the lying, trying
Trying to be something you not
I say I got, you say you got
I say I'm not, you say you tried it
If it happen to me then it happened to you
Or someone you know
Or someone you fuck with
A lot shit to be counterfeit
You no longer someone I fuck with..
Ahhhh

On everything that I love, everything that I love
On everything that I love, man I had enough
On everything that I love, everything that I love
On everything that I love, man I had enough
Ahhhh
Own up to your bullshit
Yeah it's about that time
