Not even thinking about what if you're doing is absurd
I don't mean to be the one to cut in
But you might want to stop and think about what you're doing
Here we go, everybody in the house one time
Everybody get up with their rhyme and the times and the lines
And everybody says it, everybody goes and everybody plays it'
What, and everybody says you're front
And everybody says you go with your flow, and everybody knows
Everybody sings, and everybody brings'
Have fun go ahead, do anything instead
You can do what you want if it looks fun
But God is in control of the route and that is what it's all about
Movin' in a van, so what we are a band, now you gotta get up
Get the lights shining and jumping on your feet
We'll hit you with a beat, let's move for He has given us everything
There isn't a time, a place you can be
Not a place in your face that you cannot see
Back up your face are you talking, yea
I said it's grace, He will be with me every place
And why now, everybody says it, why now
And everybody says you go with your flow and everybody knows
And everybody sings and everybody brings it
You go and everybody says it, you go and everybody throws it
You go and everybody fakes it one time, and everybody shows it
One time and everybody throws it, one time and everybody goes it
One time and everybody blows it
Here we go, come on
Come on man tell me what you were thinking
Doing everything with a selfish reason
I didn't meant to be the one to cut in
But you gotta stop and think about what you're doing
You sang your song way out of tune, so step off now and let it loose
I'm not gonna do it your way! I'm doing it for God, so I'm here today
Everybody goes and everybody knows
Everybody sings and everybody brings
Bring it on, bring it on this time, everybody sets it up with their rhyme
But now, everybody says somehow
And everybody says you go with your flow
