I can't make you, make you give me all of your time
But I just wish it could be like it was yesterday
I think it stinks that these stupid problems got in the way
So let's go back now, to the times that were fun
So sick of the lies that someone else's mind has won
I don't care what they think, I don't care who all cares
I just don't want you to leave
So tell me what you are and
I'll tell you, you're so much more than anything you thought that you could be
And tell me what you are and
I'll tell you, you're so much more than anything you thought that you could be
So get your car I'll meet you sometime tonight
I don't care what we do, we can get in a fight
I'm so tired of living in this small enclosed can
So let me out, we'll have some fun, I'll let you let me make the plans
Why are we waiting on someone else to tell us how it should be
I've already found it and God didn't tell me to waste these dreams
(to waste these dreams)
So tell me what you are and
I'll tell you, you're so much more than anything you thought that you could be
And tell me what you are and
I'll tell you, you're so much more than anything you thought that you could be
You might also likeI see you trying so hard to run the race, to the finish line
But all this stuff keeps getting in the way
So tell me what you are and
I'll tell you, you're so much more than anything you thought that you could be
So tell me what you are and
I'll tell you, you're so much more than anything you thought that you could be
And tell me what you are and
