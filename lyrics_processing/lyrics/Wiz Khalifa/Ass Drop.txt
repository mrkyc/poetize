How the hell you get all that ass in them pants?
How you drinkin' and you ain't got no glass?
And how you came in here and you ain't got no man, what
Damn, to me you look perfect
Bend that ass over; let me see how you work it
Poppin' and shakin', get on your knees hit the dirt
Girl I go so deep in that pussy while he just hitting the surface
What is you sayin'?

Drop it down on it
Made me get a couple bands drop it down on it
Make you get a couple friends drop it down on it
Turn around drop it down, drop it down on it
Do it for a real nigga, do it for a boss
Do somethin' for a boss, do somethin' for a real nigga
Go and do somethin' for a boss
Do somethin' for a boss, do somethin'

You got a ass make a nigga wanna buy a ring
You got a ass make a nigga spend errything
You got a ass make a nigga wanna buy a ring
You got a ass make a nigga spend errything
If you've got an ass like the girls in the videos

Ass so big it could swallow up a stripper pole
I ain't playin', no I ain't playin'
Bust it down on me, I need it, throw it, a boss wanna see it
Just give me a call and I'll beat it
