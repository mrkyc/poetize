Listen to this track, bitch!
I built this family on loyalty
Hm-mm, uh

Count another grip, smoke another zip
Let them young niggas tell it, I be on my shit
Make a 100K, spent it all today
What can I say? My DNA is Givenchy
What my swag is? Retarded, what I'm driving? Ferrari
What I'm rocking? Armani, Gianni, Versace, huh
Fuck around and I'll buy one of you broke niggas
My change, insane, my chain, oh that thing?

It's nothin', it's nothin', it's nothin', it's nothin'
It's nothin', it's nothin', it's nothin', it's nothin'
It's nothin', it's nothin', it's nothin', it's nothin'
It's nothin', it's nothin', it's nothin', it's nothin'
Stackin' cheese 'til my bread right, smokin' weed 'til my head right
Did it all on my own so, I'ma spend all my bread like
It's nothin', it's nothin', it's nothin', it's nothin'
It's nothin', it's nothin', it's nothin', it's nothin' (Oh)
Stackin' cheese 'til my bread right, smokin' trees 'til my head right
Did it all on my own so, I'ma spend all my bread like
It's nothin', it's nothin' (Yeah!) it's nothin', it's nothin' (Uh)
It's nothin', it's nothin', it's nothin' (2 Chainz!) it's nothin'
See Wiz Khalifa LiveGet tickets as low as $72You might also like
My hair longer than your girl, go shawty, it's your world
Sub-zero flow, when I spit, I see snow flurries
Scarface, all out, a-a-all I want in this world
I mean all I want for lunch, is a blunt, and your girl
It ain't nothin' to me but it's somethin' to you
Count money like it's somethin' to do
Summertime, I'm like, "Fuck the roof", winter time, I'm in 'Lo boots
And uh, it's nothin', I like bein' high because it's a better view
And, I told your ho my chain so cold, it's on Theraflu, uh

It's nothin', it's nothin', it's nothin', it's nothin'
It's nothin', it's nothin', it's nothin', it's nothin'
It's nothin', it's nothin', it's nothin', it's nothin'
It's nothin', it's nothin', it's nothin', it's nothin'
Stackin' cheese 'til my bread right, smokin' weed 'til my head right
Did it all on my own so, I'ma spend all my bread like
It's nothin', it's nothin', it's nothin', it's nothin'
It's nothin', it's nothin', it's nothin', it's nothin' (Oh)
Stackin' cheese 'til my bread right, smokin' trees 'til my head right
Did it all on my own so, I'ma spend all my bread like
It's nothin', it's nothin', it's nothin', it's nothin'
It's nothin', it's nothin', it's nothin', it's nothin'

You niggas chasin' money, I'm on top of it
If it ain't money, don't know what the topic is
Don't come out 'til next year, that mean I'm rockin' it
Order thirty-seven bottles, call it poppin' shit
Goddamn, what you on?
A private plane, fuck you on?
Party in south of France when it's cold
Used to rock all that old shit 'til it got old
It's nothin', it's nothin', it's nothin', it's nothin'
It's nothin', it's nothin', it's nothin', it's nothin'
It's nothin', it's nothin', it's nothin', it's nothin'
It's nothin', it's nothin', it's nothin', it's nothin'
Stackin' cheese 'til my bread right, smokin' weed 'til my head right
Did it all on my own so, I'ma spend all my bread like
It's nothin', it's nothin', it's nothin', it's nothin'
It's nothin', it's nothin', it's nothin', it's nothin' (Oh)
Stackin' cheese 'til my bread right, smokin' trees 'til my head right
Did it all on my own so, I'ma spend all my bread like
It's nothin', it's nothin', it's nothin', it's nothin'
