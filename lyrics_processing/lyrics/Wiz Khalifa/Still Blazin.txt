Usually I make a weed song, so here goes a weed song
Usually I make a weed song, so here goes a weed song
Hahaha

Still blazin', still blazin', still blazin'
'Cause Jah, Jah power so amazing
Give I di strength and protection, keep praisin'
Each and every day
Still blazin', still blazin', still blazin'
'Cause Jah, Jah power so amazing
Give I di strength and protection, keep praisin'
Each and every day

Why can't everyone just smoke like me?
Just gimme a quiet place and lemme roll my weed
Where ain't nobody in my business, don't nobody gotta know
Let all your conscious go and blow it by the O
I'm here, but my minds gone
And it's gettin hard to see you, 'cuz my eyes low
Marijuana minutes, nigga time slow
On a kush clock, there's always time to smoke
Say I look high? I say I'm high, bro
Still blazin', no one with me, just facin
I remember days when I could only smoke on occasions
I couldn't wait to go and cop from Ray and them
Rollin blunts of 50, stuck in my Mom's basement
Had dro for sale, but niggas was smokin' haze then
Blew a O a day then, don't know, but somehow I made away
And nigga them bills need pay, but I'm
See Wiz Khalifa LiveGet tickets as low as $72You might also like
Still blazin', still blazin', still blazin'
'Cause Jah, Jah power so amazing
Give I di strength and protection, keep praisin'
Each and every day
Still blazin', still blazin', still blazin'
'Cause Jah, Jah power so amazing
Give I di strength and protection, keep praisin'
Each and every day

Why can't everyone just smoke like me?
Just get up out my face and lemme roll my weed
Where ain't nobody in my business, don't nobody gotta know
Lets all learn how to roll and blow it by the O
I'm here, but my minds gone
400 a zip, nigga, that's what I'm on
And I'm gonna re-up as soon as the fires gone
Smokin OG kush from another time zone
As the smoke begins to pile on
Wettin' rags and puttin' bags over the fire alarm
You niggas styrofoam, lightweights
I'm on my 13th oz, quite baked
You probably go to sleep, ya throat might ache
You off that good weed, you need a nice break
See, I roll jays up all day and you gonna have to put a 8th in
They sayin' it's amazin, how I'm
Still blazin', still blazin', still blazin'
'Cause Jah, Jah power so amazing
Give I di strength and protection, keep praisin'
Each and every day
Still blazin', still blazin', still blazin'
'Cause Jah, Jah power so amazing
Give I di strength and protection, keep praisin'
