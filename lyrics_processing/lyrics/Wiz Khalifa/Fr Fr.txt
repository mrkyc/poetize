Yeah

Nigga for real, for real
My niggas is real, for real
I'm in the field for real
I'm 'bout my check for real
I'm 'bout my respect for real
My diamonds are crystal clear
I'm shining from ear to ear

Roll with the paper, see them lames later
Can't save her, her nigga stepped out, now she sayin' what she really think
Rollin' up pounds of dank
Open accounts, no matter where we at, smoking there and back
Eyes barely open, not never smokin'
Hit it once and she choke
2 K's, that means it's potent
Can't overdose but my strain explosive
Trained to go, my chain, it glow
Everything you see, I paid for
Gang or croak
