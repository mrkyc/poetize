Who's got the heart of a hunter?
Pounding like thunder
Prowling the night
Hot like an Indian summer
Beat of a drummer
Coming alive

If you got game, boy, you can pass go
We can go fast or we can go slow
We can get high or we can get low
But there ain't no rules tonight

If you got young blood, live to party
Red-hot, feeling naughty
Get loose, go grab somebody (woah-oh-oh, oh-woah)
If you got young blood, this is our time
Hands up, touch the skyline
Tonight, yeah, I'ma get mine (woah-oh-oh, oh-woah)

If you got young blood, blood, blood, blood
Young blood, blood, blood
(If you got) young blood, blood, blood, blood
Young blood, blood, blood, blood (woah-oh-oh, oh-woah)

Who's got the eye of the tiger?
If you a fighter
If you got soul
Who wants to walk on the wire?
Dance in the fire
Never get old

If you got game, boy, you can pass go
We can go fast or we can go slow
We can get high or we can get low
Or we can love like fools tonight

If you got young blood, live to party
Red-hot, feeling naughty
Get loose, go grab somebody (woah-oh-oh, oh-woah)
If you got young blood, this is our time
Hands up, touch the skyline
Tonight, yeah, I'ma get mine (woah-oh-oh, oh-woah)

If you got young blood, blood, blood, blood
Young blood, blood, blood
(If you got) young blood, blood, blood, blood
Young blood, blood, blood, blood (woah-oh-oh, oh-woah)
If you got young blood, live to party
Red-hot, feeling naughty
Get loose, go grab somebody
Hands up (woah-oh-oh, oh-woah)
