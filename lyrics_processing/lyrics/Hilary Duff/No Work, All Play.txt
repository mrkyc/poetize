La-la-la-la
La-la-la-la

Some people go through life like it's a breeze
They float their way through days
And never feel the grey
And their tears fall, but they don't sting
Their temporary marks, not always from the heart
They live lightly, breathe so easy
No digging in to what's within

No work, all play
What a mistake
Let the clouds roll in and fill the sky
Get that melancholy feel inside and work on yourself
Don't run from the pain you felt
You don't have to slide
Life's not one big high

La-la-la-la
La-la-la-la
La-la-la-la
You might also like
Sometimes it's hard looking at yourself
You'd rather place the blame than point it your own way
I still do hide from my feelings myself
But I'm trying hard these days not to procrastinate and face my fate
Stay on my case

No work, all play
What a mistake
Let the clouds roll in and fill the sky
Get that melancholy feel inside and work on yourself
Don't run from the pain you felt
You don't have to slide (Slide)
Life's not one big high (High)

No one is perfect
No one's the same
We've all got problems that we haven't faced
The challenges, well, they'll make you strong
Don't put them off for too long

You gotta know yourself to be yourself
You gotta do it all the way
You gotta know yourself to be yourself
It's a struggle everyday
You gotta know yourself to be yourself
You gotta do it all the way
And it's a struggle everyday
No work, all play
What a mistake
Let the clouds roll in and fill the sky
Get that melancholy feel inside and work on yourself
Don't run from the pain you felt
You don't have to slide
Life's not one big high
No work, all play
What a mistake
Let the clouds roll in and fill the sky
Get that melancholy feel inside and work on yourself
Don't run from the pain you felt
You don't have to slide
Life's not one big high

You gotta know yourself to be yourself
You gotta do it all the way
You gotta know yourself to be yourself
It's a struggle everyday
You gotta know yourself to be yourself
You gotta do it all the way
