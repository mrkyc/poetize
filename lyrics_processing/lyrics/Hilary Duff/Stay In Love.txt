We're like broken glass, often by the sea
Holding onto things we don't really need
Our edges used to fit together perfectly
Why does something good always start to bleed?

Hurting, hearts go wild
Bruised up, broken down
Praised you many times, one big lie
Passion, washed away
Fake it, fake today
Please give up and just say goodbye

Stay in love? Give me a reason
Holding on, just for the weekend
Crave the world, we're barely breathing, no oh
Stay in love? Give me a reason
Do you remember when I said I'd die for you?
Every single day, pretend it's true
Do you remember when I said I'd die for you?
Holding on, just for the weekend

All is said and done, all the fights are fought
Trapped each other and waiting to get caught
Two birds sitting in the air is all we got
Baby, I love you, but we need to break up
You might also like
Hurting, hearts go wild
Bruised up, broken down
Praised you many times, one big lie
Passion, washed away
Fake it, fake today
Please give up and just say goodbye

Stay in love? Give me a reason
Holding on, just for the weekend
Crave the world, we're barely breathing, no oh
Stay in love? Give me a reason
Do you remember when I said I'd die for you?
Every single day, pretend it's true
Do you remember when I said I'd die for you?
Holding on, just for the weekend

Thought we'd be different from the rest
I guess just like everybody, everybody else
Thought we'd be different from the rest
I guess just like everybody, everybody else
Like everybody else, no

Stay in love? Give me a reason
Holding on, just for the weekend
Crave the world, we're barely breathing, no oh
Stay in love? Give me a reason
Do you remember when I said I'd die for you?
Every single day, pretend it's true
Do you remember when I said I'd die for you?
Holding on, just for the weekend
Holding on, just for the weekend
