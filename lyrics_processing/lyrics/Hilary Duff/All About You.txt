Hey

You could be my dirty secret (I could be yours)
We could only be a rumor, never be sure (Never be sure)
You could meet me in the backseat (Late night)
A ticket up in first class, mile high (Mile high)

'Cause hey, baby, baby you got me so, so good, yeah
Hey baby, baby, I got it so, so bad

Think you're all about me, but I'm all about you
Turn the lights down, let me show you it's true
Get a little taste of what I'm into
Think you're all about me, but I'm all about you, yeah, you, yeah

I don't want to keep a secret (Let the combo)
This is more than just a little thing, baby, for sure (Baby, for sure)
I can't wait until the next time (We meet)
Gotta kiss you in the daylight out on the beach (Out on the beach)

'Cause hey, baby, baby you got me so, so good, yeah
Hey baby, baby, I got it so, so bad
