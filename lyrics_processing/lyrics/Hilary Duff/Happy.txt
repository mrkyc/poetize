I understand why you're looking for tears in my eyes, eyes
Trust me, they were there, but now the well has run dry, dry
I was in so deep, but couldn't get out
I sat on feelings that I buried deep down
I knew there'd come a day when our paths would cross
And glad it's today, 'cause now I am strong

I'm happy, and I can thank myself
If it were up to you, I'd be in my bed cryin'
But I'm happy, and I know that makes you sad
After all the things you put me through
I'm finally getting over you
I'm happy, I'm happy

There's a reason why we met, and I'm glad that we did
Yeah, I am
But when we broke up, I got back a part of me I, really missed
Not saying that you brought me down all the time
There were moments I lived without light on my side

I'm happy, and I can thank myself
If it were up to you, I'd be in my bed cryin'
But I'm happy, and I know that makes you mad
After all the things you put me through
I'm finally getting over you
You might also like
All the bitterness has passed
And I only wish you someone who can do what I can't

I'm happy, and I can thank myself
If it were up to you, I'd be in my bed cryin'
But I'm happy, and I know that makes you mad
After all the things you put me through
I'm finally getting over you
I'm happy, and I can thank myself
If it were up to you, I'd be in my bed cryin'
But I'm happy, and I know that makes you sad
After all the things you put me through
