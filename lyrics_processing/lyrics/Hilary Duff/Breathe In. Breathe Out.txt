I remember what I wore on our first date
I remember how you felt against my face
I remember all the songs we used to hate (oh, oh-oh, oh)
I remember we were sleepless in New York
I remember how my avenues were yours
I remember when they weren't anymore (oh, oh-oh, oh)

No more rain or shine
Well, I guess this is goodbye, I

I made a top ten list of all the things I missed
Your lying eyes and lips, they didn't make it
And when I'm cold at night, I know that I'll survive
Until I feel alright, I'm gonna fake it

Breathe in, breathe out
Breathe in, breathe out
Breathe in, breathe out
Breathe in, breathe out
Breathe in, breathe out
Breathe in, breathe out

I remember when we had too much to dream
I was hanging on your words like I'm sixteen
I remember being high on your caffeine (oh, oh-oh, oh)
I remember when we fell too deep to feel
I remember when the real became too real
I remember when it hurt too much to heal (oh, oh-oh, oh)

No more rain or shine
Well, I guess this is goodbye, I

I made a top ten list of all the things I missed
Your lying eyes and lips, they didn't make it
And when I'm cold at night, I know that I'll survive
Until I feel alright, I'm gonna fake it

Breathe in, breathe out
Breathe in, breathe out
Breathe in, breathe out
Breathe in, breathe out
Breathe in, breathe out
Breathe in, breathe out
"X" marks the spot where we left our hearts
And "X" marks the spot where we fell apart
And "X" marks the spot where we left our hearts
Na-na, na-na
"X" marks the spot where we left our hearts
And "X" marks the spot where we fell apart
And "X" marks the spot where we left our hearts
Na-na, na-na

I made a top ten list of all the things I missed
Your lying eyes and lips, they didn't make it
And when I'm cold at night, I know that I'll survive
Until I feel alright, I'm gonna fake it

Breathe in, breathe out
Breathe in, breathe out
Breathe in, breathe out
Breathe in, breathe out
Breathe in, breathe out
Breathe in, breathe out

"X" marks the spot where we left our hearts
And "X" marks the spot where we fell apart
And "X" marks the spot where we left our hearts
