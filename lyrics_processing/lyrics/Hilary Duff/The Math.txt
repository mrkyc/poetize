You're always trying to figure out what I am all about
If you don't know what the answer is, then just shut up and kiss
It shouldn't take forever to put it all together

If you can't do the math, then get out of the equation
I am calling you back
This is star 69
Is it a minus or a plus?
Does enough equal enough?
If you can't do the math, then nothing adds up
Tell me why I'm here

Sure, I want someone to understand
But I don't need the stress
I'm not about being analyzed, like it's some kind of test
Don't have to be a genius to figure what's between us

If you can't do the math, then get out of the equation
I am calling you back
This is star 69
Is it a minus or a plus?
Does enough equal enough?
If you can't do the math, then nothing adds up
Tell me why I'm here
You might also like
You can spend your whole life analyzing
Justifying, quantifying, and dividing 'til there's nothing anymore
Why don't you just close your eyes, and kiss my lips, and let it go?
Just let it flow
It's what I'm waiting for
Don't have to be a genius to figure what's between us

If you can't do the math, then get out of the equation
I am calling you back
This is star 69
Is it a minus or a plus?
Does enough equal enough?
If you can't do the math, then nothing adds up
Tell me why I'm here
If you can't do the math, then get out of the equation
I am calling you back
This is star 69
Is it a minus or a plus?
Does enough equal enough?
If you can't do the math, then nothing adds up
