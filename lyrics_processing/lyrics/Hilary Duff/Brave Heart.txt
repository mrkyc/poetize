Each and every day it's the same old game
And I play along
Round and round we go
But we never know when we should get off

And we both tried, but that's just life
And now we're coming to an end
My tears have dried
Made up my mind and I'm ready to begin

Gotta let go even though I'm scared to death
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Out here alone, but I still got one thing left
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
I got a brave heart
I got a brave heart
I got a brave heart

I guess the safer play would've been to stay
And just make it work
But the other side is calling me tonight
Even though it hurts
You might also like
And we both tried, but that's just life
And now we're coming to an end
My tears have dried
Made up my mind and now I'm ready to begin

Gotta let go even though I'm scared to death
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Out here alone, but I still got one thing left
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
I got a brave heart
I got a brave heart
I got a brave heart

I don't know, know where we're going
I can't read, read our fate in the stars
I don't know, know where I'm heading
So just know, know you're still in my heart

I wouldn't change a single page of our history
I'm gonna keep all the letters you wrote to me

Each and every day it's the same old game
And I play along
Round and round we go
But we never know when we should get off
Gotta let go even though I'm scared to death
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Out here alone, but I still got one thing left
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
I got a brave heart
I got a brave heart
I got a brave heart

(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
(I don't know, know where we're going)
I've got a brave heart
(I can't read, read our fate in the stars)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
(I don't know, know where I'm heading)
I've got a brave heart
