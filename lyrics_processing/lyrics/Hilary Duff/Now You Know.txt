In these eyes
More than words more than anything that I've spoken
As the skies turn to gray
My heart's just about to crack open

So the story goes
But there's something you should know
Before I walk away and I blow the ending

I never wanna be without you
Oh no, here I go
Now you know what I feel about you
There's no running
I must have been wrong to doubt you
Oh no, there I go, no control
And I've fallen, so now you know

Feel so light
Craving oxygen
All these truths left me empty
Will you run?
(Will you run?)
Can you handle it?
'Cause I need you to tell me
You might also like
Maybe this is bold
But I'm hoping you'll stay for the happy ending

I never wanna be without you
Oh no, here I go
Now you know what I feel about you
There's no running
I must have been wrong to doubt you
Oh no, there I go, no control
And I've fallen, so now you know

No, I won't look back when I tell you what I think about you
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
No, I won't look back when I tell you what I think about you
(Yeah, yeah)

So the story goes
Yeah, you already know
So don't be a fool and go spoil the ending

Never wanna be without you
Oh no, here I go
Now you know what I feel about you
There's no running
I must have been wrong to doubt you
Oh no, there I go, no control
And I've fallen, so now you know
I never wanna be without you
Oh no, here I go
Now you know what I feel about you
There's no running
I must have been wrong to doubt you
Oh no, there I go, no control
