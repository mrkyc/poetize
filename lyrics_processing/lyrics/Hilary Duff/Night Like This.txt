I've been watching the phases of the moon from my window pane
I've been talking to corners of the room for too long
Too long
Met you when my heart was somewhere else
Outside in the rain
Saw you smiling, the stories you could tell
Have you moved on?
Moved on

It's so hard to get a cab at midnight on Friday
Where you going? Downtown
So am I
Stand right here, where it's dry, and if you said you're going my way
Well, maybe we should share a ride

I could feel my heartbeat electric to my fingertips
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I could feel anticipation through my veins
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I can almost feel the weight of your kiss on my lips
'Cause anything could happen on a night like this
On a night like this
You might also like
Wouldn't mind if we caught every red light
You're someone I can get close to
You're a stranger, but there's something in your eyes
Like you know me
Could I know you?

Well, I never fell in love at midnight on Friday
Standing outside of town, in the rain
Well, this ride is almost over
But if I had it my way, we would just stay up all night

I could feel my heartbeat electric to my fingertips
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I could feel anticipation through my veins
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I can almost feel the weight of your kiss on my lips
'Cause anything could happen on a night like this
On a night like this

Our hands fit just the right way
Our legs tangled up in this small space
The world outside feels far away, as I get to know you
I could feel my heartbeat electric to my fingertips
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I could feel anticipation through my veins
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I can almost feel the weight of your kiss on my lips
'Cause anything could happen on a night like this
On a night like this

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Anything could happen on a night like this
On a night like this
On a night like this
