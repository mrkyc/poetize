How it happens, I don't care
If it's raining, or what I wear
I know today is taking me where I'm meant to be
Doesn't matter where I go
With my board shoes or my rockstar phone
I'm waiting for a friend to call or the rain to fall

Life goes by
Who knows why?

I can't wait for the world to spin
I can't wait to be happening
Oh, what's it gonna take?
I can't wait for my time to come
And I'll be shining like the sun
I can't wait
I can't wait

Bum, bum-bum-bum
Bum-bum-bum
Bum-bum-bum, yeah

Everybody has their day
Where things just seem to go their way
An angel's gonna smile on me
When it's meant to be
'Cause anything is possible
No matter how incredible
You never know who I might meet
On this crowded street

Life goes on
Like a song

I can't wait for the world to spin
I can't wait to be happening
Oh, what's it gonna take?
I can't wait for my time to come
And I'll be shining like the sun
I can't wait

I haven't got forever
And I haven't got all day
Oh, I don't want my world
To stay the same
So where's a magic moment
To carry me away?
Bum, bum-bum-bum
Bum-bum-bum
Bum-bum-bum, yeah

Life goes by

I can't wait for the world to spin
I can't wait to be happening
Oh, what's it gonna take?
I can't wait for my time to come
And I'll be shining like the sun
I can't wait

I can't wait for the world to spin
I can't wait to be happening
Oh, what's it gonna take?
I can't wait for my time to come
And I'll be shining like the sun
I can't wait
