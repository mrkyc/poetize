The battle of France is over
Congratulations
You've joined the ranks of all the rest

Was it her face that invaded your mind?
Her kind isn't that hard to find
She lets you think that you found her first
That's how she works
Her sick and twisted gypsy curse

She can swallow knives
She can swallow lives
Gold and black stare brought the night of your demise

Tried to run away with a gypsy woman
Here today, then gone for good (For good)
Can't get away with a gypsy woman
Thought no one would know your secrets down below
But you can't go, can't go with her
Can't go, can't go with her
Can't go, can't go with her
Can't go
The gypsy woman
You might also like
This is a favorite game to play
She's got you stumbling
Stumble, st-st-stumbling
Talks with a grin 'cause she's got no shame
Enjoyed the fame
Bringing down the family name

She can swallow knives
She can swallow lives
Gold and black stare brought the night of your demise

Tried to run away with a gypsy woman
Here today, then gone for good (For good)
Can't get away with a gypsy woman
Thought no one would know your secrets down below
But you can't go, can't go with her
Can't go, can't go with her
Can't go, can't go with her
Can't go
The gypsy woman

She can rob you blind with just one look from those eyes
Out of all the thieves that trained her
None of them could tame her (Oh)
Tried to run away with a gypsy woman
Here today, then gone for good (For good)
Can't get away with a gypsy woman
Thought no one would know your secrets down below
But you can't go, can't go with her
Can't go, can't go with her
Can't go, can't go with her
Can't go
The gypsy woman
But you can't go, can't go with her
Can't go, can't go with her
Can't go, can't go with her
Can't go
The gypsy woman

Tell me, was it worth it?
Can you say it's worth it?
Tell me, was it worth?
Can you tell me it was worth it?
