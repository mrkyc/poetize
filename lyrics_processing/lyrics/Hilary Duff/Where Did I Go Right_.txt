I'm always too late
I see the train leaving
I'm always laughing when it's not cool to smile
I'm always aiming (I'm always aiming)
But somehow keep missing (But somehow keep missing)
So how did you get here? (So how did you get here?)
Something is wrong

Where did I go right?
How did I get you?
How come all this blue sky
Is around me and you found me?
Where did I go right?
How did I get you?
I don't know how I did
But somehow, now I do

I'm always driving
Forget where I'm going
Should've turned left
But I was singing some song, and I
I am arriving (I am arriving) as everyone's leaving (As everyone's leaving)
But there you are, waiting (And there you are, waiting)
Something is wrong

I don't know how I did
But somehow, now I do

Makes no sense to me
No, it isn't clear
But somehow you're standing here
Something gets to me
It's that nothing is wrong

Where did I go right?
How did I get you?
How come all this blue sky
Is around me and you found me?
Where did I go right?
How did I get you?
I don't know how I did
Where did I go right? (Where did I go right?)

How come all this blue sky
Is around me and you found me?
Where did I go right? (Where did I go right?)
How did I get you? (How did I get you?)
I don't know how I did
But somehow, now I do
Somehow, now I do, yeah, yeah
