Moment of clarity
You're leading me where I'll follow
In all my insanity
You're real, for now
So I keep telling me
You take the weight off my shoulders
You're every missing piece
You're real, for now

I let my walls come down and I
Will let you waste my time
I don't care if it's all a lie

I'm with you for the night
You're taking me, taking me high
You're loving me, loving me right
Think you're one of my kind, you're one of my kind
And so for now
Don't want you, don't want you to stop
I promise, I won't get enough
Think you're one of my kind, you're one of my kind

Oh, woah
Think you're one of my kind
You're one of my, one of my
Oh, woah
Think you're one of my kind
You're one of my, one of my
You might also like
You're standing out from the crowd
Strobe lights on your body
When everyone's fading out
You're real, for now
Won't you just take me down?
For you, I'm the perfect target
I know when the sun comes out
I'm off, but now

I let my walls come down and I
Will let you waste my time
I don't care if it's all a lie

I'm with you for the night
You're taking me, taking me high
You're loving me, loving me right
Think you're one of my kind, you're one of my kind
And so for now
Don't want you, don't want you to stop
I promise, I won't get enough
Think you're one of my kind, you're one of my kind

Oh, woah
Think you're one of my kind
You're one of my, one of my
Oh, woah
Think you're one of my kind
You're one of my, one of my
I'll be going 'til I'm overloading
Even though it's breaking me, breaking me
Tearing me, tearing me up
I'm going (Going) 'til I'm overloading (Loading)
Even though it's breaking me, breaking me, yeah

I'm with you for the night
You're taking me, taking me high
You're loving me, loving me right
Think you're one of my kind, you're one of my kind
You're one of my, one of my

I'm with you for the night
You're taking me, taking me high
You're loving me, loving me right
Think you're one of my kind, you're one of my kind
And so for now (For now)
Don't want you, don't want you to stop (Don't want you to stop)
I promise, I won't get enough (Won't get enough)
Think you're one of my kind, you're one of my kind (One of my kind)

Oh, woah
Think you're one of my kind
You're one of my, one of my
Oh, woah
Think you're one of my kind
You're one of my
So for now
Don't want you, don't want you to stop
I promise I won't get enough
