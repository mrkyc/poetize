Why not? Why not?

You act like you don't know me
When you see me on the street
You're actin' like I turn you off
When I know you think I'm sweet
It don't have to be like that
I guess you're insecure
If you say what's on your mind
I might answer, "Sure"

So I walk a little slower
And I try to catch your eye
Sometimes it's so hard to see
The good things passing by
There may never be a sign
No flashing neon light
Telling you to make your move
Or when the time is right

(So) why not (Why not) take a crazy chance?
Why not (Why not) do a crazy dance?
If you lose the moment, you might lose a lot
So, why not?
Why not?

Why not take a crazy chance?

You always dress in yellow
When you wanna dress in gold
Instead of listening to your heart
You do just what you're told
You keep waiting where you are
For what, you'll never know
Let's just get into your car and go, baby, go

(So) why not (Why not) take a crazy chance?
Why not (Why not) do a crazy dance?
If you lose a moment, you might lose a lot
So, why not?
Why not?

Oh, I could be the one for you
Oh, yeah, maybe yes, maybe no
Oh, it could be the thing to do
What I'm saying is, you gotta let me know
You'll never get to heaven, or even to L.A
If you don't believe there's a way
Why not (Why not) take a star from the sky?
Why not (Why not) spread your wings and fly?
Oh, it might take a little, and it might take a lot
But why not?
Why not?
Ow

(Why not take a crazy chance?)
Why not take a crazy chance?
(Why not do a crazy dance?)
Why not do a crazy dance?
If you lose a moment, you might lose a lot
So, why not?
