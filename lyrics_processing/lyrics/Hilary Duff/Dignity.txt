You got the hottest shoes (You got it)
You got those Jimmy Choo's (You got it)
You never get the blues
It's always all about you (We got it, we got it)

Wake up late, no time to waste
Better check that phone
There's a club to close

Where's your, where's your, where's your dignity?
I think you lost it in the Hollywood hills
Where's your, where's your, where's your dignity?
Can't buy respect, but you can pick up that bill
Pick it up, pick it up
It's all you got, it's all you got
Pick it up, pick it up
'Cause money makes your world go 'round
Money makes your world go 'round

Always with Mr. Right (Right now)
But then you have a fight (And he's out)
Run into your friend's ex
He's happy to be your next (She won't mind, she won't mind)
You might also like
Tomorrow's papers coming out, so kiss him fast
Watch the cameras flash

Where's your, where's your, where's your dignity?
I think you lost it in the Hollywood hills
Where's your, where's your, where's your dignity?
Can't buy respect, but you can pick up that bill
Pick it up, pick it up
It's all you got, it's all you got
Pick it up, pick it up
'Cause money makes your world go 'round
Money makes your world go 'round

You'd show up to the opening of an envelope
Why does everybody care about where you go?
It's not news when you got a new bag
It's not news when somebody slaps you
It's not news when you're looking your best
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, give it a rest

Pick it up, pick it up
It's all you got, it's all you got
Pick it up, pick it up
'Cause money makes your world go 'round
(Where's your, where's your, where's your dignity?)
Money makes your world go 'round
(Where's your, where's your, where's your dignity?)
'Cause money makes your world go 'round
(Where's your, where's your, where's your dignity?)
Money makes your world go 'round
(Where's your, where's your, where's your dignity?)
'Cause money makes your world go 'round
