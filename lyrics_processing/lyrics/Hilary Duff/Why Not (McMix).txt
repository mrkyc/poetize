You think you're going nowhere
When you're walking down the street
Acting like you just don't care
When life can be so sweet
Why you wanna be like that?
'Cause if there's nothing new
You're not fooling no one
You're not even fooling you

So walk a little slower
And open up your eyes
Sometimes it's so hard to see
The good things passing by
There may never be a sign
No flashing neon light
Telling you to make your move
Or when the time is right

(So) why not (why not) take a crazy chance?
Why not (why not) do a crazy dance?
If you lose the moment, you might lose a lot
So, why not?
Why not?

Why not take a crazy chance?
Why not take a crazy chance?

You always dress in yellow when you wanna dress in gold
Instead of listening to your heart, you do just what you're told
You keep waiting where you are
For what, you'll never know
Let's just get into your car and go, baby, go

(So) why not (why not) take a crazy chance?
Why not (why not) do a crazy dance?
If you lose a moment, you might lose a lot
So, why not?
Why not?

Oh, I could be the one for you
Oh, yeah, maybe yes, maybe no
Oh, it could be the thing to do
What I'm saying is, you gotta let me know
You'll never get to heaven, or even to L.A
If you don't believe there's a way
Why not (why not) take a star from the sky?
Why not (why not) spread your wings and fly?
Oh, it might take a little, and it might take a lot
But why not?
Why not?

(Why not take a crazy chance?)
Why not take a crazy chance?
(Why not do a crazy dance?)
Why not do a crazy dance?
If you lose a moment, you might lose a lot
So, why not?
