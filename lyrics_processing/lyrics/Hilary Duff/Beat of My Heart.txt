To the beat of my, to the beat of my
To the beat of my heart

I'm thinking about letting it out
I wanna give in
I wanna go out
Been looking around
I finally found the rhythm of love
The feeling of sound
It's making a change
The feeling is strange
It's coming right back
Right back in my range
Not worried about anything else
I'm waking up

To the beat of my, to the beat of my
To the beat of my heart

The beat of my heart, the beat of my heart
The beat of my heart, it tears us apart
The beat of my heart, the beat of my heart
The beat of my heart, now I'm back to the start
You might also like
To the beat of my, to the beat of my
To the beat of my heart

I'm up from my down
I turn it around
I'm making it back
I'm not gonna drown
I'm taking a stance
I won't miss a chance
I want you to see
I'm not scared to dance
The way that you feel
Could never be real
I want you to know
I finished the deal
So I'm saying to you
I'll always be true to the rhythm inside

To the beat of my, to the beat of my
To the beat of my heart

The beat of my heart, the beat of my heart
The beat of my heart, it tears us apart
The beat of my heart, the beat of my heart
The beat of my heart, now I'm back to the start
To the beat of my, to the beat of my
To the beat of my heart

Away, away, away, away
Away, away, away, away
Away, away, away, away
(To the beat of my, to the beat of my heart)
Away, away, away, away
(To the beat of my, to the beat of my heart)

Beat of my heart
The beat of my heart, the beat of my heart
The beat of my heart, it tears us apart
The beat of my heart, the beat of my heart
The beat of my heart, now I'm back to the start

The beat of my heart, the beat of my heart
The beat of my heart, it tears us apart
The beat of my heart, the beat of my heart
The beat of my heart, now I'm back to the start

To the beat of my, to the beat of my
To the beat of my heart
Away, away, away, away
(To the beat of my, to the beat of my heart)
Away, away, away, away
