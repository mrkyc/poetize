This conversation hasn't happened
But you need to hear me now
Call it a warning sign or a caption
But there's walls that won't back down

Well, I'm wide awake
And I swore I wouldn't dream
When I hear you say that you won't let go of me
I'm slipping under
Soon as I thought never again, oh, no, no, no, no

If I fall, you better catch me
You're turning me into confetti
I can't sleep, my head is heavy
You're turning me into confetti
I'm free-falling through all of the twilight
Every piece of me holds on for dear life
You break out
You side affect me
You're turning me into confetti

You've got a way of hearing maybe
As a chance you can't resist
So you set your sails to my winds waiting
Till the water starts to shake
You might also like
Well, I'm wide awake
And I swore I wouldn't dream
When I hear you say that you won't let go of me
I'm slipping under
Soon as I thought never again, oh, no, no, no, no

If I fall, you better catch me
You're turning me into confetti
I can't sleep, my head is heavy
You're turning me into confetti
I'm free-falling through all of the twilight
Every piece of me holds on for dear life
You break out
You side affect me
You're turning me into confetti

You happened, and I tripped head first
Your heaven is a place on Earth
You happened, and I tripped head first
Your heaven is a place on Earth

If I fall, you better catch me
You're turning me into confetti
I can't sleep, my head is heavy
You're turning me into confetti
I'm free-falling through all of the twilight
Every piece of me holds on for dear life
You break out
You side affect me
You're turning me into confetti
You happened, and I tripped head first
Your heaven is a place on Earth (You're turning me into confetti)
You happened, and I tripped head first
