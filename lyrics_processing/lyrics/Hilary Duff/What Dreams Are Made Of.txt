Hey now, hey now
Hey now, hey now

Have you ever seen such a beautiful night?
I could almost kiss the stars for shining so bright
When I see you smiling I go, "Oh, oh, oh"
I would never want to miss this
'Cause in my heart, I know what this is

Hey now, hey now
This is what dreams are made of
Hey now, hey now
This is what dreams are made of
I've got somewhere I belong
I've got somebody to love
This is what dreams are made of

(Hey now)
This is what dreams are made of

Have you ever wondered what life is about?
You could search the world and never figure it out
You don't have to sail the oceans
No, no, no
Happiness is no mystery
It's here and now
It's you and me, yeah

Open your eyes

Shout to the skies

When I see you smiling I go, "Oh, oh, oh"
Yesterday my life was duller
Now everything's technicolor
