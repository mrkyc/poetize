Here I am again, talking to myself
Sittin' at a red light
Both hands on the wheel
How am I supposed to feel?
So much runnin' through my mind
First you wanna be free
Now you say you need me
Giving mixed signals and signs

It's so hard to let you in
Thinking you might slam the brakes again

Put the pedal down, heading out of town
Gotta make a getaway (Getaway, getaway, getaway)
The traffic in my brain's driving me insane
This is more than I can take
You tell me that you love me first
Then throw your heart into reverse
I gotta get away

I can't keep coming back to you every time you're in the mood
To whisper something sweet in my ear
It's so hard to move on, 'cause every time I think you're gone
You show up in my rear-view mirror
Is this just a detour?
'Cause I gotta be sure
That you really mean what you say
You might also like
It's so hard to let you in
Thinking you might slam the brakes again

Put the pedal down, heading out of town
Gotta make a getaway (Getaway, getaway, getaway)
The traffic in my brain's driving me insane
This is more than I can take
You tell me that you love me first
Then throw your heart into reverse
I gotta get away

To a place where I can be redefined
Where you're out of sight and you're out of mind
But the truth is, I can't even say goodbye

Here I am again, talking to myself
Sittin' at a red light
Both hands on the wheel
How am I supposed to feel?
So much running through my mind

Put the pedal down
Heading out of town
Gotta make a getaway (A getaway)
The traffic in my brain's driving me insane
This is more than I can take (I can take)
You tell me that you love me first
Then throw your heart into reverse
I gotta get away
Getaway, getaway, getaway
Getaway, getaway, getaway
