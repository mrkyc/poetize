One in a, one in a, one in a...
One in a, one in a, one in a...
One in a, one in a, one in a...

You say, "Don't worry about me, babe
Promise this is just a phase.''
So what?
Should I stand around and wait while you're living in a haze?
Nuh-uh
I remember how you were when it was all fresh and new
Now what?
Now when you look at me sometimes
Like you're looking straight through

And I said, "What does it matter
When you don't wanna fight it?"
Looking like lovers, yeah, you know that I mind it
Breathing out nothing
Can you see what you're giving?
But I know, but I know...

I'm one in a million
I'm one in a million
You're going down without me
Wishing that you had someone like me
I'm one in a million

You say, "Don't worry 'bout us babe, I just need a little time"
So what?
I'm supposed to be okay when we're nowhere close to fine?
Nuh-uh
I know you've done nothing wrong, but it only makes it worse
You-ou hurt me more when you don't care
'Bout what you're about to lose

And I said, "What does it matter
When you don't wanna fight it?"
Looking like lovers, yeah, you know that I mind it
Breathing out nothing, can you see what you're giving?
But I know, but I know...

I'm one in a million
I'm one in a million
You're going down without me
Wishing that you had someone like me
I'm one in a million

And I said, "What does it matter
When you don't wanna fight it?"
Looking like lovers, yeah, you know that I mind it
Breathing out nothing, can you see what you're giving?
But I know, but I know...
I'm one in a million
I'm one in a million
You're going down without me
Wishing that you had someone like me
