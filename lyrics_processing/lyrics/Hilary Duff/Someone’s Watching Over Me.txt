Found myself today
Oh, I found myself and ran away
Something pulled me back
The voice of reason I forgot I had

All I know is you're not here to say
What you always used to say
But it's written in the sky tonight

So I won't give up
No, I won't break down
Sooner than it seems, life turns around
And I will be strong, even if it all goes wrong
When I'm standing in the dark, I'll still believe
Someone's watching over me

Seen that ray of light
And it's shining on my destiny
Shining all the time
And I won't be afraid
To follow everywhere it's taking me
You might also like
All I know is yesterday is gone
And right now I belong
To this moment to my dreams

So I won't give up
No, I won't break down
Sooner than it seems, life turns around
And I will be strong, even if it all goes wrong
When I'm standing in the dark, I'll still believe
Someone's watching over me

It doesn't matter what people say
And it doesn't matter how long it takes
Believe in yourself, and you'll fly high
And it only matters how true you are
Be true to yourself and follow your heart

So, I won't give up
No, I won't break down
Sooner than it seems, life turns around
And I will be strong, even if it all goes wrong
When I'm standing in the dark, I'll still believe
That I won't give up
No, I won't break down
Sooner than it seems, life turns around
And I will be strong, even when it all goes wrong
When I'm standing in the dark, I'll still believe
That someone's watching over
Someone's watching over
Someone's watching over me
Hey, yeah, oh, oh
