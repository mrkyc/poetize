Mmm, yeah you burned me again
Well, I don't wanna know where you've been
Mmm, how is your new best friend?
Do you know I will treat you like them?
And I know...

You're under my skin
Running in my bloodstream
These scars are the way that you loved me
I guess that you had to leave a tattoo on my skin
Running in my bloodstream
These scars are the way that you loved me
I guess that you had to leave a tattoo to remind me
A tattoo to remind me
A tattoo to remind me

Apologies for the way I've been
I couldn't wash you off my skin
No I, I couldn't live without you
Mmm, tears and eyes can dry
But I know I'm burning like the wire in light bulbs
It could be in the way you bleed me
And I know
You might also like
You're under my skin
Running in my bloodstream
These scars are the way that you loved me
I guess that you had to leave a tattoo on my skin
Running in my bloodstream
These scars are the way that you loved me
I guess that you had to leave a tattoo to remind me
A tattoo to remind me
A tattoo to remind me

See these scars leaving blood on my little white dress?
Beating heart screaming out now

You're under my skin
Running in my bloodstream
These scars are the way that you loved me
I guess that you had to leave a tattoo on my skin
Running in my bloodstream
These scars are the way that you loved me
I guess that you had to leave a tattoo to remind me
A tattoo to remind me

You're under my skin and running in my bloodstream
These scars are the way you loved me
