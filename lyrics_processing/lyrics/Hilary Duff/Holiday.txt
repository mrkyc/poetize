I remember summers
You and me lasting forever
Holidays coming, we'd never, never ever be apart
I remember spending all of my time, every minute
The two of us, we had our own rhythm
In tune with the beat of my heart

Now in the summer (I miss you)
And in the winter (I miss you)
It don't matter (What I do)
Since you went away, since you went away
Now in the summer (I miss you)
And in the winter (I miss you)
It don't matter what I do
It don't matter what I say
You left it

You took a holiday from us
You took a trip and left your love
If your heart went down forever
Should have told me where it was
Took a holiday from me
I guess you needed to be free
I would've loved you with no measure
Now you got me asking where
(Where did you go?...)
Where, where did you go?
Where did my heart go? You took a holiday
(Where did you go?...)
Where, where did you go?
(Where did you go?...)
And why did you leave?
This ain't no holiday for me
You might also like
Walking, watching you leave
There's no talking
Back on my own; it's so shocking
Guess forever was just a dream (Just a dream)
I think we could've made it
But our history now is fading
My image of the future is changing
And baby, damn, that thing called destiny got the best of me

Now in the summer (I miss you)
And in the winter (I miss you)
It don't matter what I do
It don't matter what I say
You left it

You took a holiday from us
You took a trip and left your love
If your heart went down forever
Should have told me where it was
Took a holiday from me
I guess you needed to be free
I would've loved you with no measure
Now you got me asking where
(Where did you go?...)
Where did you go?
Where did my heart go? You took a holiday
(Where did you go?...)
Where, where did you go?
(Where did you go?...)
And why did you leave?
This ain't no holiday for me
If I could take a step back, make it turn out different
I would hide those bags and I'd tear that ticket
Never thought you and me'd be done in a minute
Now I'm making new plans, and you're just not in 'em
If I could take a step back, make it turn out different
I would hide those bags and I'd tear that ticket
Never thought you and me'd be done in a minute
Now I'm making new plans, and you're just not in them
(Where did you go?)
