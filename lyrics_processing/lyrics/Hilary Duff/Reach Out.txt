Let's go
So bring your passport, girl, I'm trying to show you the world
I know your ex did you bad, but I'm your new perfect man
Dignity where you stand, with just a touch of my hand
I'm trying to show you my plan, you got me, girl, I'm a fan

From the minute that you walked right through the door
Thoughts are racing in my mind, time to explore
I told my friends that I just gotta have him
But don't look now 'cause I see you staring at him
Tunnel vision had him locked on in my sight
On a mission for position by the end of the night
It's like a prey playin' games with the hunter
Nowhere to run, boy, time to surrender

And all I need is to feel you
All I want is to feel you

Reach out and touch me
Before I go insane
Reach out and touch me
Boy, don't you make me wait
I'm a dime and you're so on the money
Reach out and touch me
And all I need is to feel you
Reach out and touch me
You might also like
Like a prayer, your touch can take me there
In my mind, you and me, in a secret affair
Oh, boy, you're killing me and you don't even know it
Try to hold back, but I can't control it
So I'm steppin' to ya, skip the "How you doin'?"
Grab your hand and pull you closer to me, yeah
Out the door we're slippin', then we start to kissing
Boy, you're invited to my fanta-tasy

And all I need is to feel you
All I want is to feel you

Reach out and touch me (Reach out)
Before I go insane (Touch me, baby)
Reach out and touch me
Boy, don't you make me wait
I'm a dime and you're so on the money
Reach out and touch me (Reach out and touch me)
Reach out and touch me (Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)
Before I go insane
Reach out and touch me (Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)
Boy, don't you make me wait
I'm a dime and you're so on the money
Reach out and touch me
And all I need is to feel you
Reach out and touch me
(Yeah, you already know, it's Prophet, baby, let's go)
I'm here to play with fire, your body's my desire
The time to flirt across the room don't expire
'Cause you're a superstar, get in my super car
The paparazzi watching us, that's t-t-t-too bizarre
I know I took you far, but look how good you are
And look how good you look, one touch, I'm supercharged

Baby, can't you see how you're affecting me?
Baby, sensual, physical, fantasy
Maybe fate brought the two of us closer now
Don't you wanna, don't you wanna?
Don't you wanna, don't you wanna?
Reach out and touch me

Reach out and touch me (Reach out)
Before I go insane (Touch me, baby)
Reach out and touch me
Boy, don't you make me wait
I'm a dime and you're so on the money
Reach out and touch me (Reach out and touch me)
Reach out and touch me (Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)
Before I go insane
Reach out and touch me (Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)
Boy, don't you make me wait
I'm a dime and you're so on the money
Reach out and touch me
And all I need is to feel you
Reach out and touch me
(Reach out, reach out, reach out)
(Reach out, reach out)
