"Don't go borrowin' trouble," that's what you used to say
But we don't keep in touch the way we used to nowadays
Your eyes are not as bright as I remember them to be
The light inside's grown dim and that's hard for me to see

The creases on your forehead run like treads on a tire
The white stripe runnin' through your bangs a long twisted spire
You're sweepin' up the floods and you've been vacuumin' the fires
And you lay down every night next to a goddamn liar

You may be here today, but tomorrow, you're a ghost
I guess the most someone can hope for is to find a place to lay
Someone to tell your secrets to when the nights get long and blue
Someone strong enough to lean on when the roses fall away
Strong enough to love you when you're wrong
Someone strong enough to love you when you're
Wrong

When the day is winding down, my heart abandons me for you
You forgot yourself so long ago and I wish I could too
But you live inside a quiet hell no one can pray away
Leavin' would be easy, I understand why you stay

You may be here today, but tomorrow, you're a ghost
I guess the most someone can hope for is to find a place to lay
Someone to tell your secrets to when the nights get long and blue
Someone strong enough to lean on when the roses fall away
Strong enough to love you when you're wrong
Someone strong enough to love you when you're
When you're wrong
Mm

You'd be wrong if you were thinkin' that we all don't fade away
Like dew drops in the dawn, like sun beams through the haze
It's a long way to be sinkin', holdin' tightly to the weights
Of the one who pulls you down while you slowly waste your days

Someone strong enough to love you when you're wrong
Someone strong enough to love you when you're
Wrong
When you're wrong

Ooh-ooh
When you're wrong
