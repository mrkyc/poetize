Ohhhhh ohhhh ohhhh oh-o-oh
Ohhhhh ohhhh ohhhh oh-o-oh

There's a hole in my pocket where my dreams fell through
From a sidewalk in the city to the avenue
There's a leak in my dam 'bout the size of a pin
And I can't quite remember where the water's getting in
But when you're wearing on your sleeve all the things you regret
You can only remember what you want to forget
You feel it tugging at your heart like the stars overhead
Till you rest your bones on the killing bed

Let them roll over me
Let them roll over me
When I doubt you
Let them roll over me
Let them roll over me
When I doubt you

With the weight of the world resting on my back
And the road on which I've travelled is as long as it is cracked
But I keep pressing forward with my feet to the ground
For a heart that is broken makes a beautiful sound
When you're wearing on your sleeve all the things you regret
You can only remember what you want to forget

Let them roll over me
Let them roll over me
When I doubt you
Let them roll over me
Let them roll over me
When I doubt you

Ohhh ohhhh ohhh oh-o-oh
Ohhh ohhhh ohhh oh-o-oh

I walk through my days like a ghost in a dream
But the feel carries on and my past follows me
It's hard moving on from the things you done wrong
When they play in your head like an old-fashioned song
When you're wearing on your sleeve all the things you regret
You can only remember what you want to forget

Lonely miles without you
Lonely miles without you
Let them roll over me
Let them roll over me
When I doubt you
Let them roll over me
Let them roll over me
When I doubt you
Let them roll over me
Let them roll over me
Let them roll over me
Let them roll over me
Let the ground keep my faults
Let the water be my home
Let the dust hold my soul
