They build wooden houses on frozen ponds
In the summertime when the water's gone
Diagonal lines in their rolled-out lawns
And the sage always smells so pretty
But nobody cares where the birds have gone
When the rain comes down on Babylon
The stone mason's phone rings all day long
And you gotta get back to the city

I'll build my house up on this rock, baby
Every day with you
There's nothin' in that town I need
After everything we've been through
Me out in my garden and you out on your walk
Is all the distance this poor girl can take
Without listenin' to you talk
I don't need their money, baby
Just you and me on the rock
You and me on the rock

I built paper planes when I learned to fly
Like a 747 fallin' out of the sky
I folded 'em crooked, now I'm wonderin' why
I could always end up in the water
But nobody's askin' why she lookin' so thin
Why she laughin' too hard or why she drinkin' again
A fallen star, she's a paper plane
She was goin' down when you caught her

I'll build my house up on this rock, baby
Every day with you
There's nothin' in that town I need
After everything we've been through
Me out in my garden and you out on your walk
Is all the distance this poor girl can take
Without listenin' to you talk
I don't need their money, baby
Just you and me on the rock

It's an earthquake, it's a harder wind
It's a record breakin' tide and it is rollin' in
It's a big sea, but it can't touch you and me
It's just a water view
And what a view
I don't need their money, baby
Woo

I'll build my house up on this rock, baby
Every day with you
There's nothin' in that town I need
After everything we've been through
Me out in my garden and you out on your walk
Is all the distance this old girl can take
Without listenin' to you talk
I don't need their money, baby
Just you and me on the rock
I don't need their money, baby (I don't need their money, baby)
Just you and me on the rock (Just you and me on the rock)
