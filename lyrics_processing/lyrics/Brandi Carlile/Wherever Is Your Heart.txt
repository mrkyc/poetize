I think it's time we found a way back home
You lose so many things you love as you grow
I missed the days when I was just a kid
My fear became my shadow, I swear it did

Wherever is your heart I call home
Wherever is your heart I call home
Though your feet may take you far from me, I know
Wherever is your heart I call home

You made me feel like I was always falling
Always falling down without a place to land
Somewhere in the distance, I heard you calling
Oh it hurts so bad to let go of your hand

Wherever is your heart I call home
Wherever is your heart I call home
Though your feet may take you far from me, I know
Wherever is your heart I call home

Even when you're high, you can get low
Even with your friends you love, you're still alone
We always find the darkest place to go
God forgive our minds, we were born to roam

Oh God forgive my mind
Oh God forgive my mind
When I come home
When I come home
Oh God forgive my mind
There's a road that's long and winding
It hollers home
I'm calling home
Oh God forgive my mind
Oh God forgive my mind
When I come home
When I come home
Oh God forgive my mind
Oh God forgive my mind
When I come home
When I come home

Wherever is your heart I call home

Though your feet may take you far from me, I know
Wherever is your heart I call home

Wherever is your heart I call home
Though your feet may take you far from me, I know
