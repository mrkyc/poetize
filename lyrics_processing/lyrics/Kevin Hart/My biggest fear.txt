Rollin' in my drop bumpin' 9 Piece
I just spent a dime on my time piece
Ridin' in my whip with a dime piece

I got racks in my pocket
Racks in my pocket
Racks in my pocket
Yeah, I got racks in my pocket
She got a big'ol ass, big'ol ass
When she hit the stage them other hoes don't get no cash
Now work that pole, work that pole, bitch
Work that, work that pole, bitch
Work that pole, work that pole, bitch
Work that, work that pole, bitch
I got Racks in my pocket
Racks in my pocket
Racks in my pocket
Yeah, I got racks in my pocket

Okay she bust it open for me and said "I'm your biggest fan, Los"
Bitch I got these notes on me, call me Luther Vandross
Feel like I'm on tour the way I travel with these bands, though
So act like this a soccer game and do it with no hands, ho
She stand straight up and make it clap like 'that's right that's right that's right that's right'
She can pop one cheek and bring the other one back like 'left right left right left right left right'
She wind it up real slow, I'm like 'oh mama, oh mama'
Cause she shoot up them polls just like Obama, Obama
You don't know no bitch, that'll work for cash like her
Just to rock a Birkin bag like her
But that bitch can't twerk that ass like her
You don't know no bitch that won't dare trip
She can kill a bum bitch with a hair flip
Yeah, bitch, I said hair flip
She can kill a bum bitch with a hair flip
Her gears sick, pussy tight
She don't really hang with pussy type
Like 'em , not a pussy type
So you know I had to show her what my hood be like
I just took my girl and put her up in something kitted
So if you want this money baby girl just come and get it
See Kevin Hart LiveGet tickets as low as $115You might also like

She say she only like girls, but she let me in
Cause I keep it G that's why they screaming "Gee, let's be friends"
Now I'm laid up in the crib with three lesbians
I got game all day bitch I should work for ESPN
I said "I'mma make it rain bitch", make that pussy go 'pow'
All these stacks I'm throwing up, you gone need a snow plow
In my Kevin Hart voice "It's about to go down"
She pop it like she from the motherfucking motherland
While I pop fucking rubber band off another band
I'm bossin', I'm flossin'
You talkin', I toss it
Throw racks around that bitch feel like she walked in a closet
She wind it up slow I'm like 'oh mama, oh mama'
Cause she shoot up them polls just like Obama, Obama
You don't know no bitch, that can make a nigga drop the change like her
Just to cop the Range like her
But the bitch can't pop the thang like her
You don't know no bitch that won't 
That can kill a bum bitch with a hair flip
Her gears sick, and she don't fear shit
So if you want this money come here, bitch
