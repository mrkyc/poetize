I turned into a monster
It's like I'm laying in bed with a stranger
It's heavy on my conscious
And if we keep on this road then we're in danger

Don't know if I made you this way
Or even if we're both to blame
For putting out all the cards, all the cards on the table
How do you make a good girl go bad
How did it all change so fast?
Feeling like more and more, we can't ignore, the love is fading

Cause I used to know which way to go
I used to know your love would show
What happened to? What happened to?
It never hurt like this before
Don't wanna feel it anymore
What happened to? What happened to?
It's like I don't even know you
It's like I don't even know you
It's like I don't even know

The problem
Tell me who else could know you like I do?
Oooh, I put it on the bible (?)
How do lovers slowly turn to rivals?

Don't know if I made you this way
Or even if we're both to blame
For putting out all the cards, all the cards on the table
How do you make a good girl go bad
How did it all change so fast?
Feeling like more and more, we can't ignore, the love is fading

Cause I used to know which way to go
I used to know your love would show
What happened to? What happened to?
It never hurt like this before
Don't wanna feel it anymore
What happened to? What happened to?
It's like I don't even know you
It's like I don't even know you
It's like I don't even know you
It's like I don't even know you
What happened to, It's like I don't even know you

Girl what's the use? It's like a call that'll never get through
It's taking a toll, now we're losing control

Cause I used to know which way to go
I used to know your love would show
What happened to? What happened to?
It never hurt like this before
Don't wanna feel it anymore
What happened to? What happened to?
It's like I don't even know you
It's like I don't even know you
It's like I don't even know you
It's like I don't even know you
