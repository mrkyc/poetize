On my darkest days
Girl, and I can't seem to find a little peace of mind
Baby, can you scream my name?
Please, girl, can you scream my name, scream my name for me?
Scream my name, scream my name for me?
Can you scream my name? Oh, woah, oh

Lately I just feel like givin' up
Lately everythin' just been too rough
I know you missin' all of my calls
I let you see all of my flaws, oh
I gave you my heart, it's not enough
Waitin' every day until you're done, but you never call
Then you go turn around and swear that you really need my love
So tell me will you be here?

On my darkest days
Girl, and I can't seem to find a little peace of mind
Baby, can you scream my name?
Please, girl, can you scream my name, scream my name for me?
Scream my name, scream my name for me?
Can you scream my name? Oh, woah, oh

Thinkin' you get everythin' you want
This a relationship, a scholarship, a free ride
Say that you do everything you don't
Remember all the late nights when I cried?
And now I'm *67 on your phone
Callin' blocked, I'm all alone
And you know that I can't sleep, baby
Lord knows I've tried
But I hate when you're away from me, baby
Only 'posed to be mine
All mine, on my darkest days

On my darkest days (Oh, yeah)
