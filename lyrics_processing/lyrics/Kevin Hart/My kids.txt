UOENO it
Something about being rich
And UOENO it
Something about having a bad bitch
And UOENO it
Something about having money
UOENO it


Been a real nigga since day one
So fuck that if you hearing different
Y'all can't touch me
So fuck that if you feeling different
Been a weird nigga since day two
Grinding hard since day three
Kid I done paid dues
So it's about time that they paid me
I am gone to the moon
But I can't let these haters phase me
If you tell me that I'm too young
I'mma ball out like I'm KD
You know nothing bout me
All you do is doubt me
Grinding in my sleep
I could really use a mouthpiece
When these lames spit
All I want to do is spit up
Gotta problem
We can work it out like sit ups
Ain't nothing new today
But with these punchlines
I think I'm Ali
That Kid kumbaya
Flowing like a butterfly
Stinging like a bee boy
Here Let me break it down for you
Like a B-boy
Lets just battle because
I swear you'd never beat me
Believe me
I swear it's more easy
Than breathing
I don't believe in rest
Until they crown me as the best
I'm going to keep doing this
Until my heart stops in my chest
I'm a beast you're girls a dog
So that's okay if she's a bitch
Living life like Harry Potter
I can't wait to catch a snitch
In this game we call rap
I see no competition
If you ever find a genie
Bitch you better get to wishin'
First wish for better rhymes
Second wish for better flows
If you don't worry about that grass
You better wish for better hoes
I'm doing fine
Like Rihanna wearing no clothes
Claiming that you better
Watch as your nose grows
Bitch I'm going off
Like a toy with no battery
All you doing is the minimum
Like low salaries
I heard you run shit
You remind me of a snail
Got bars like prisons
You on lock pay up the bail
Spitting lines so hot
Like I'm Satan welcome to Hell
Coming at me crooked
Go ahead and take the L
Working harder than a mexican
Shit I'm on my Hector flow
You couldn't find a carpenter
That ever has a better flow
Or a mailman that's got a better delivery
Because I keep flames
Like the statue of liberty
Call me that kid
Knowing T.A.Z.'s the man
Must be jew
Because you're never going ham
Verse so good God said God damn and
If i pull a molly in her drink I told her in advance
See Kevin Hart LiveGet tickets as low as $115You might also like

I'm working on my next tape
And UOENO it
Half of these rappers be fake
And UOENO it
How much does this take
UOENO it
I'm trying to be great
You probably knew that Hold up (x2)
