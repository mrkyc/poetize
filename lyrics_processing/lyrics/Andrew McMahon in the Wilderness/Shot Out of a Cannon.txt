Even with the lights and the power down
Even when the earth shakes and breaks your crown
Even if the cops run us out of town
I wouldn't care
And when you speak, but you make no sound
Flying like a kite on the battleground
I'll be ready
Hold me steady
When we travel through the air

Shot out of a cannon
I'm defying gravity
And you're the drug that's keeping me from landing, yeah
We could fall or we could fly or we could borrow wings
I'm tired of standing, yeah
Catapult our destiny
Tonight we're leaving for another planet, planet
Shot out of a cannon, cannon
Shot out of a cannon

We could tell the world that we disappeared
We could tell the way I was way up here
We could tell the truth even if no one would ever care
'Cause I am ready
Hold me steady
We can travel through the air
You might also like
Shot out of a cannon
I'm defying gravity
And you're the drug that's keeping me from landing, yeah
We could fall or we could fly or we could borrow wings
I'm tired of standing, yeah
Catapult our destiny
Tonight we're leaving for another planet, planet
Shot out of a cannon, cannon
Shot out of a cannon
Shot out of a cannon

In the dark, in the dark, in the dead of night
You got a heart, got a heart like a neon sign
In the dark, in the dark, when I'm flying blind
You got a heart like a neon sign
It's true

Shot out of a cannon
I'm defying gravity
And you're the drug that's keeping me from landing, yeah
Catapult our destiny
Tonight we're leaving for another planet, planet
Shot out of a cannon, cannon
Shot out of a cannon
Shot out of a
Shot out of a, shot out of a cannon, cannon
