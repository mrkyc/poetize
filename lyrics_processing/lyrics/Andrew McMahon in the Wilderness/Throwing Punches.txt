Navy morning and a yellow moon
I stayed up late just to howl at you
Isn't that what you're supposed to do when you're an animal?
'Cause we've been living in a different life
Keeping quite when it's worth the fight
Let's go ripping through the walls just like a cannon ball

You've got my heart so hit me hard
I've still got your back

Half way to something can feel like nothing at all
Nothing at all
Are you in, are you out? Up, are you down?
Running around, throwing punches, punches
Half way to hold on can feel like ready to fall
Ready to fall
Are you in, are you out? Up, are you down?
Running around, throwing punches, punches

Yellow morning and a navy moon
Slowly turning into afternoon
We could break or we could make through
'Cause we're not animals
And you could see me in a different light
We could lay here while the sun burns bright
Between the walls that we wrecked last night
Just like a cannon ball
You might also like
You've got my heart so hit me hard
I've still got your back

Half way to something can feel like nothing at all
Nothing at all
Are you in, are you out? Up, are you down?
Running around, throwing punches, punches
Half way to hold on can feel like ready to fall
Ready to fall
Are you in, are you out? Up, are you down?
Running around, throwing punches, punches

Take a swing, take a swing, take your best shot
Take a swing, give it everything you got
I've still, still got your back
Come on
Take swing, take a swing, take your best shot
Take swing, give it everything you got
I've still, still got your back
I've still got your back

Half way to something can feel like nothing at all
Nothing at all
Are you in, are you out? Up, are you down?
Running around, throwing punches, punches
Half way to hold on can feel like ready to fall
Ready to fall
Are you in, are you out? Up, are you down?
Running around, throwing punches, punches
Half way to something can feel like nothing at all
Nothing at all
Take swing, take a swing, take your best shot
Take swing, give it everything you got
Half way to hold on can feel like ready to fall
Ready to fall
Are you in, are you out? Up, are you down?
