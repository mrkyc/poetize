Sleep, sleep
Even when I'm walking in my sleep

Ghosts on the corner
I used to think that's all we'd ever be
Come home to California
Hey, wild heart, I'd give up everything
To see the world in blinding color

I keep going back there
To the crowded street where
I could see you walking in my sleep
I'll never stop trying
You're my silver lining
Even when I'm walking in my sleep
In my sleep, sleep
Even when I'm walking in my sleep
In my sleep, sleep
Even when I'm walking in my sleep

This is me in a bedroom
Broken window, sunlight coming through
This is you, shotgun on a highway
When you feel that same sun coming into view
And you see the world in blinding color
You might also like
I keep going back there
To the crowded street where
I could see you walking in my sleep
I'll never stop trying
You're my silver lining
Even when I'm walking in my sleep
In my sleep, sleep
Even when I'm walking in my sleep
In my sleep, sleep
Even when I'm walking in my sleep

Come on, wake me up
Come on, wake me up
Feels like I've been walking, walking in my sleep
Come on, wake me up
Come on, wake me up
Feels like I've been walking, walking in my sleep
Walking in my sleep
Come on, wake me up
Come on, wake me up
Feels like I've been
Feels like I've been walking in my sleep

I keep going back there
To the crowded street where
I could see you walking in my sleep
I'll never stop trying
You're my silver lining
Even when I'm walking in my sleep
In my sleep, sleep
Even when I'm walking in my sleep
In my sleep, sleep
