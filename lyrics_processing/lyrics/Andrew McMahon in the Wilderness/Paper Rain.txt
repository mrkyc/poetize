Pack my suit and pawn the last of our precious metal
And my blue eyes never looked so green
I got a debt to pay and a date with the devil
I got mouths to feed
I gotta get level
Oh Las Vegas
I'm running out of time
And my youth is all but ashes
If I don't make church by 9
I'll be praying on the drive
Past the lake as fake as a showgirl's lashes
That I'm gonna turn our luck around
Gonna take this town
Gonna walk these flooded streets like a king with my umbrella out
Yeah I'm gonna turn our luck around
I'm gonna make you proud
I'm gonna walk these flooded streets like a king with my umbrella out
And paper rain pouring down
Paper rain pouring down
I rented a room at the Desert Queen
I shaved my face and I combed my hair and I checked the weather
And I see clouds where the mountains meet
The valley floor where the neon soars like a hand to heaven
I got work to do
Rollin them sevens

I'm gonna make you proud
I'm gonna walk these flooded streets like a king with my umbrella out
And the paper rain pouring down
Paper rain pouring down
Got a stack on the line and a stack behind
Rollin like a wave on a moonlit night
Money on the four and money on the eight
Paying down the marker 'cause the bank won't wait
