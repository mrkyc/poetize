Don't wait until the morning
Don't wait until the light hits the cracks in the floor
Been living in the flight path
Not perfect but it's all that we can afford
I spent the whole day working
Been trying to pin these dreams to the wings of a check
Don't wait until the morning
So tired but I don't want to go to sleep yet

I've been killing myself to make the dead man's dollar
Been killing myself to make the dead man's dollar
Been killing myself, killing myself
'Cause I want to make a life, make a life for you

I, I want to make a, I, I want to make a, I do
Yeah, I want to make a life, make a life for you
I, I want to make a, I, I want to make a, I do
Yeah, I want to make a life, make a life for you
I want to make a life, but I want to live there too

I know this isn't easy
You got that baby sleeping all by yourself
Feels like I'm always leaving
I swear to God, one day I'll be there to help

'Til then, I've been killing myself to make the dead man's dollar
Been killing myself to make the dead man's dollar
Been killing myself, killing myself
'Cause I want to make a life, make a life for you

I, I want to make a, I, I want to make a, I do
Yeah, I want to make a life, make a life for you
I, I want to make a, I, I want to make a, I do
Yeah, I want to make a life, make a life for you
I want to make a life, but I want to live there too

You and me and the dark make light
Let's work all day and stay up all night
You and me and the dark make light
We can work all day and stay up all night, all night

I, I want to make a, I, I want to make a, I do
Yeah, I want to make a life, make a life for you
I, I want to make a, I, I want to make a, I do
Yeah, I want to make a life, make a life for you
I, I want to make a
You and me and the dark make light
I, I want to make a
Let's work all day and stay up all night

Yeah, I want to make a life, make a life for you
I want to make a life, but I want to live there too
