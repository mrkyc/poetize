We were holed up in the corner of a cowboy bar
When you asked me to dance, I couldn't answer
But I met you on the floor and we left in a fight
In the cab back home, all I could think about was second chances

And we have skirted lines and endings
We have flirted with disaster
You were there in the beginning
I'll be there for what comes after

The stars that fell for you
Left holes in my roof
The stars that fell for you
They fell for you and I'm falling too
They fell for you and I'm falling too
Stars, stars

I was looking for a lighter in a bedside drawer
Found a picture and a pack of matches from another lifetime
Yeah, I'm missing the parade but I'm done with the war
There's a hole in this sweater you told me that you're gonna patch up
You might also like
And we have skirted fires and flood planes
We have flirted with disaster
I was there in the beginning
When you were swinging from the rafters

The stars that fell for you
Left holes in my roof
The stars that fell for you
They fell for you and I'm falling too
They fell for you and I'm falling too
Stars, stars

A world without color is a world without
A world without color is a world without you
A world without color is a world without
A world without color is a world without
A world without color is a world without you

Stars, stars
The stars that fell for you (The stars that fell for you)
Left holes in my roof (Stars, stars)
The stars that fell for you (The stars that fell for you)
They fell for you and I'm falling too (Stars, stars)
They fell for you and I'm falling too (The stars that fell for you)
A world without color is a world without stars, stars
A world without color is a world without
A world without color is a world without you
