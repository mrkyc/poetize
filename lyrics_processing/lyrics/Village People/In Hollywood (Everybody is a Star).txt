Go there and then change your name
You dye your hair out there, it's part of the game
You're gonna be a star, a big star
Tell the bank that you need a loan
Go sell your house and every little thing that you own
You'll make your dream, forget what you've ever known
You're gonna be a star, a big star
Now you're set, so follow the rules
Don't need a house unless it comes with the pool
Buy some new clothes and then you've got to be cool
You're gonna be a star, big star, listen here
Find a beach if you need a tan
You got to act as though you're in great demand
Be first class, don't ever think second hand
You're gonna be a star, a big star

Play a good game, you see you'll never go wrong
You're gonna be a star, a big star
Tell your friends you walked off the stage
Then slip outside and call and have yourself paged
Get on the phone and scream as though in a rage
You're gonna be a star, a big star
