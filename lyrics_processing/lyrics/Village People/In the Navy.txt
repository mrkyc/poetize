Where can you find pleasure, search the world for treasure
Learn science technology?
Where can you begin to make your dreams all come true
On the land, or on the sea?
Where can you learn to fly, play in sports and skin dive
Study oceanography?
Sign up for the big band, or sit in the grandstand
When your team and others meet

In the navy
Yes, you can sail the seven seas
In the navy
Yes, you can put your mind at ease
In the navy
Come on now, people, make a stand
In the navy, in the navy
Can't you see we need a hand?
In the navy
Come on, protect the motherland
In the navy
Come on and join your fellow men
In the navy
Come on people, and make a stand
In the navy (In the navy), in the navy (Oh)
