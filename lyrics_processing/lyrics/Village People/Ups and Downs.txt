I just don't know what to do
You see I'm hung up on pills
I take them for my cheap thrills
I take pills all day and night
To try and make things all right
I take them when I feel down
And wanna fly
I wish I could end this trip
I have begun to like it
But truth is pills are not cool
I'd just be playing the fool
I know that reality
Is far away now from me
I wish I could find my way
Back to the ground
It's not around
It can't be found

I take my ups, ups, ups, and downs
I take my ups, ups, ups, and downs
I wish this madness would end
Where did this pill trip begin?
I take my ups, ups, ups, and downs

I take my ups, ups, ups, and downs
They're either red or they're blue
I take the white and orange too
I take my ups, ups, ups, and downs
I just don't know what to do, oh no
I feel so un-for real, oh yes
I wish that I could end this trip
I just can't take no more
Take no more, no no
No more
I take pills when I wake up
To get me out of my bed
I take pills when I go dance
To concentrate on the steps
I take pills when I go home
To help me fall fast asleep
I take pills when I work out
To reach my peak
Sometimes I feel very strange
Sometimes I forget my name
I can't remember the time
When real thoughts went through my mind
I need to throw all these pills
I have been popping away
I need to throw them away
Right now today
Yes right away

I said that I would quit today
I said that I would throw away
All the pills that I had you see
I want to be free
I wanna be free
I just want to be free
I want to be free yeah
Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes I don't even know my name
Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes I feel oh so strange
I take an up in the morning
I take me a down late at night
I take me a up early in the evening
I take me a down to make me feel all right
So now that you've heard my tale
I hope that you'll wish me well
I hope that you'll understand
I'm doing all that I can
To make this nightmare I've got
You know it takes a strong will
But I can do it real soon
I hope I will
Life has its own ups and downs
They keep my head spinning round
Life has its own ups and downs
When there are no pills around
So tell me why do I need
To keep on taking these pills
They've got me so that I feel
So un-for real
I think I'm ill
I need a pill
