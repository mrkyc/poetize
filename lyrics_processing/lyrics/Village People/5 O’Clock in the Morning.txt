As I wander in the streets alone
It's five o'clock in the morning, the city is awaking
I don't wanna go to sleep alone
And now I feel like such a fool because I've broken all the rules
And I hurt the one who loves me, when I just turned and walked away
There wasn't much that you could say except to say you really loved me
It's five o'clock in the morning, my mind's gettin' weary
As I walk the lonely street again
It's five o'clock in the morning and I feel very sorry
'Cause your love I'll never be again
I guess I'm gonna have to face that I just couldn't run the race
I always thought I was a winner
When your love I'm gonna lose, it makes it easier to choose
Because I'm not a good beginner
Woh baby (baby), I need your love, oh baby (baby), I want your love
Oh baby (baby), bring back your love, oh baby, oh baby, oh
It's five o'clock in the morning, the city is so silent
Can't you hear the lonely beat of my heart
It's five o'clock in the morning, this feeling is so helpless
I can't stop the lonely beat in my heart

Maybe some day you'll forgive me
So until then I'll play the part of a man with a broken heart
And hope someday you will free me
Oh baby (baby), I need your love, oh baby (baby), I want your love
Oh baby (baby), bring back your love, oh baby, oh baby, oh
