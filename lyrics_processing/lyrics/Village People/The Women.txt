Who has been the center, world's greatest attraction
Since the beginning of time? (A woman!)
What can hypnotize the eyes with body motion
Flowing like the ocean's tide? (A woman!)
Woman is so mysterious
You know a woman is so voluptuous
A woman spreads joy with every smile
I say a woman's face makes me scream (Aaah!)
I love the women!
Although they are women
Those who like too many things
Silver slippers, diamond rings
Those who carry themselves just like a queen! (Aaah!)
I love the women!
Let's dance with the women
When you dance you catch our eyes
When you dance you hypnotize
The world!
Who can wrap a man around her little finger
With the taste of her sweet charm? (A woman!)
Who can make a man drop everything he's doing
Stops the world till she's all right? (A woman!)
