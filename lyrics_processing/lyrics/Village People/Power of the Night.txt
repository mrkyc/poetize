Woo ooh Woo ooh
I'm lost in your spell
You know me too well
I'm under your magic
Just one whiff and I fell
You know my every desire
You are the fuel for my fire
You call the tune and I'm dancing
On your invisible wire
In the dark so tender
You forced me to surrender
The power of the night
So strong
The Power of the night
Whoa
You hold me in your prison
Until the sun has risen
The power of the night
So strong
The power of the night
Taking me completely
Taking me down deeply
Taking me to places
I wanna go, I wanna go, I wanna go, I wanna go
By myself I dever
Do these things not ever
Darkness gives me strength
The power of light

By daylight I'm nothing
By night life I cry

I live from midnight till dawn
I come alive in the darkness
I want the night to go on

You forced me to surrender
The Power of the night
