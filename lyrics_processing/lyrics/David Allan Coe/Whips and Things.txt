We're gon' do this song for Useless

Oh
I was into whips and things
She was into pain
And I would beat her black and blue
When she called me names
Chained her to the basement wall
Where she went insane
And I was into whips and things
She was into pain, oh

Finger Fuckin' Sally
Worked at Kelly's bar
She showed me her titties
In Ronnie Murphy's car
She was the first lady
To let me go that far
Finger Fuckin' Sally
Down at Kelly's bar, and

Pussy Eatin' Pamela
Went to Elliot High
Caught her in the bathroom
I thought she would die
Eatin' Susan's pussy
Licked that sucker dry
Pussy Eatin' Pamela
Went to Elliot High, oh
You might also like
Suck 'Em Silly Shirley
Came out after dark
She would give us head jobs
In Centennial Park
All the girls would snub her
Said she was a narc
Suck 'Em Silly Shirley
From Centennial Park, yes

Good old Bloody Mary's
On the rag again
And Pussy Eatin' Pamela's
Got blood on her chin
Suck 'Em Silly Shirley
Got caught after dark
Finger Fuckin' Sally
In Centennial Park, now

Pussy Eatin' Pamela
In the county jail
Suck 'Em Silly Shirley
Left town on a rail
They sent Bloody Mary
To the pen for life
And
Finger Fuckin' Sally
She became my wife, and
I was into whips and things
She was into pain
And I would beat her black and blue
When she called me names
Chained her to the basement wall
Where she went insane
And I was into whips and things
She was into pain, oh

Finger Fuckin' Sally
Worked at Kelly's bar
She showed me her titties
In Ronnie Murphy's car
She was the first lady
To let me go that far
Finger Fuckin' Sally
Down at Kelly's bar, and

Pussy Eatin' Pamela
Went to Elliot High
Caught her in the bathroom
I thought she would die
Eatin' Susan's pussy
Licked that sucker dry
Pussy Eatin' Pamela
Went to Elliot High, oh
Suck 'Em Silly Shirley
Came out after dark
