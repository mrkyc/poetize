You gotta learn to suck it funny
How those dicks taste all like rubber
Covered with goo
Some cums clear and some cums milky
Some cums thick and some cums silky
Don't bit the dick that fucks you honey
And it'll be good to you
Momma be proud of your daughter
Think of all the things you taught her
Not to go into the water till she could swim
How to cook and how to sew
What other things you know
You should have taught her about sex
That it was not a sin
You should have said
Don't bit the dick that fucks you honey
You gotta learn to suck it funny
How those dicks all taste like rubber
Covered with goo
Some cums clear and some cums milky
Some cums thick and some cums silky
Don't bit the dick that fucks you honey
It'll be good to you

If you'da taught her how to fuck one
Maybe she'd a never snuck one when you wasn't home
You could have taught her not to fight it
You could have taught her not to bit it
You could have taight her wrong from right
But you left her on her own
You should have said
Don't bite the dick that fucks you honey
You gotta learn to suck it funny
How those dicks all taste like rubber
Covered with goo
Some cums clear and some cums milky
Some cums thick and some cums silky

Some cums thick and some cums silky
Don't bite the dick that fucks you honey
