Who the Hell is she
Telling all them faggots
That they can't be free
Throw that bitch in prison
Then maybe she'll see
Just how much them goddamned homosexuals mean to me
Because they...
Wash your clothes
Clean your cell
Help you drain your hose
Give you smokes
Laugh at jokes
Sew up all your clothes
Rub your feet
Beat your meat
Heaven only knows
What I'd do without those homosexuals
They all
Read and Write
Fuck all night
Clean your fingernails
Help you dress
Play you chess
Lay you down some rails
Be your wife
Take your life
In a jealous rage
Who says we don't need them homosexuals
You might also likeI tell you
Some are big
Some are small
Some are in-between
Some are yellow belly queers
And some of them are mean
Some are killers
Some are thiefs
Some are singers too
In fact Anita Bryant
Some act just like you
So, fuck Anita Bryant
Who the Hell is she
Telling all them faggots
That they can't be free
Throw that bitch in prison
Then maybe she'll see
Just how much them goddamned homosexuals mean to me
Because they...
Wash your clothes
Clean your cell
Help you drain your hose
Give you smokes
Laugh at jokes
Sew up all your clothes
Rub your feet
Beat your meat
Heaven only knows
What I'd do without those homosexuals
They all

Help you dress
Play you chess
Lay you down some rails
Be your wife
Take your life
In a jealous rage

I tell you
Some are big
Some are small
Some are in-between
Some are yellow belly queers
And some of them are mean
Some are killers
Some are thiefs
Some are singers too
In fact Aneta Briant
