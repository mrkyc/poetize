This song is for all the people that's been reviewing our records in different magazines and things, and mentioning the fact that we sound a lot like Jimmy Buffett, because we live in Key West, and we use Congo drums in our songs. And to all those people, that are under the misconception that Mr. Buffett lives in Key West. We'd like to say there's a lot of things in Key West, as a matter of fact, there's:

There's sailboats and conch shells and palm trees galore
But Jimmy Buffett doesn't live in Key West anymore
Sister spare change has a bumper sticker on the door
Says Jimmy Buffett doesn't live in Key West any more

Hey smugglers need those Buffett songs, snitching on the sly
Bringing heat where it's already to damn hot to die
Son of a son of a son of bitch, what's all that bullshit for
Jimmy Buffett he don't live in Key West anymore

Sailing to the Caribbean Jimmy might well be
Pictures up in Rolling Stone for all the world to see
The rich keep getting richer, the poor they just stay poor
Jimmy Buffett doesn't live in Key West anymore

Now Jimmy's moved to Malibu with all those other stars
He's not down Duval Street hanging out in bars
All them God damned tourist, got to be a bore
Jimmy Buffett doesn't live in Key West anymore
You might also like
So don't tell me I sound like Jimmy Buffett
Just because I got that island beat
Jimmy might have grown up on the ocean
Me, I kinda grown up on the street
Music's just a way of life, me I'm livin' free
So don't lay all that Key West Jimmy Buffett shit on me

Now Divers Do It Deeper must have really made them mad
Some of them reviewers said it really sounded bad
Well they liked Margaritaville, me I liked it too
Someday Jimmy, why don't we just both get drunk and screw
Oh those creepy motherfuckers that think music is a whore
Tell that you just don't live in Key West anymore
