I can't tell if what I'm living is real or a dream
Built up a history of a life filled up of sin
Change up to a life where everything's positive
And now a brighter future is the best motive
Wonder if she miss me the way I do miss her
Without her I'm driving my life with no signal
Run out of breath 'cause she's my actual oxygen
Love hurts
And I don't wanna die

Please girl hold me closer
Tell me that it's not over
Layed my head on your shoulder
I have you as only trust
Can you stay here forever?
Or a little bit longer?
Your heart, I will look after
Gon' you?

Please girl hold me close
Say it's me you're looking for
Be the key of every doors
'Cause I'm kicked out from freedom
And I know it's not your fault
Those questions couldn't be solved
Draw my life got me feel low
Just got blamed for the life that I chose
Please girl hold me close
Say it's me you're looking for
Be the key of every doors
'Cause I'm kicked out from freedom
And I know it's not your fault
Those questions couldn't be solved
Draw my life got me feel low
Just got blamed for the life that I chose
(Blamed for the life that I chose)
You might also like
If I give you attention, will you stay?
And some sexual affection, will you stay?
If I give you my heart Love, will you stay?
I need reassurance so

Please girl hold me closer
Tell me that it's not over
Layed my head on your shoulder
I have you as only trust
Can you stay here forever?
Or a little bit longer?
Your heart, I will look after
Gon' you?

Please girl hold me close
Say it's me you're looking for
Be the key of every doors
'Cause I'm kicked out from freedom
And I know it's not your fault
Those questions couldn't be solved

Please girl hold me close
Say it's me you're looking for
Be the key of every doors
'Cause I'm kicked out from freedom
And I know it's not your fault
Those questions couldn't be solved
Draw my life got me feel low
Just got blamed for the life that I chose
