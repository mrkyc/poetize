Did the drugs make you happy?
And did you find, a way to get all the way out of your mind?

Out of your mind, out of your mind, out of your mind
Out of your mind, out of your mind, out of your mind
(Out of) Out of your mind, out of your mind, out of your mind
Out of your mind, out of your mind, out of your mind

Can I still call you when I can't stop crying?
Will you still call me up, if you think that you're dying?
Was the last time you laughed with me the last we'll ever have?
How can I hate you if you look at me like that?

Like you're out of your mind, out of your mind, out of your mind
Like you're out of your mind, out of your mind, out of your mind
Out of your mind, out of your mind, out of your mind
Out of your mind, out of your mind, out of your mind

You do all the same things over and over again
Are you insane?
How is your brain?
Don't play pretend
Are you really gonna fake it, til' you make it all the way to the end?
And my heart you're gonna take it, you're gonna break it
Don't do this again

Like you're out of your mind, out of your mind, out of your mind
Like you're out of your mind, out of your mind, out of your mind
Out of your mind, out of your mind, out of your mind
You are out of your mind, out of your mind, out of your mind
Out of your mind, out of your mind, out of your mind
You are out of your mind, out of your mind, out of your mind
