I am the type of woman who would love my man unconditionaly

I would love you tell you haft to ron to the other room to sleep and nad because my love is toomuch for you
And when I love you, you better not be taking me for a fool because if you do baby somebody is gonna get hurt up in here
You see there is a thin line inbettween love and hate an you don't wanna know what it's in between those lines

My love is crazy, (aha)
My love is sick, (so true)
When I say I love you baby you better not see other chics
When you tell me you love me and I say I love u, there are rules to abide by
So don't be brinning other women up in my house when I'm at work
Don't be taking showers before you come from work
Tell your chics not to call my phone, text my phone and talk foolishness to me
'cause if they do, I'll get so psyco up in here you won't beleave I'm the same woman you been sleeping with
You might also likeI can get things cranky up in here so bad you will think that I'm a crack head
My love is crazy, (it is)

When I say I love you baby, you better not see other chics
You men, you don't understand us women
You think we just getup and saw AND get crazy all by our selves
But what you don't know is you're the reason why there are so many crazy women in this world
For instans you say you love me and you gonna tell 10 other women you love them
Now baby why I'm saying these things is because I forward all your calls to my phone 'cause I'm crazy
So I know when Tanisha and you went to the same restaurant that you took me and I keep your car that night
You thought it was someone keep your car by mistake, it was me, I went back to bed and I pretend as if I was there
Sleeping I wasn't gone, cause I'm crazy
The other chic that you pic the other day and you asked her for her address, I got her too 'cause as I say I got all your information from your phone that's forward to mine, so when you ready to go see her back you tell me so I could sili slap you and her
My love is crazy
My love is sick
When u tell me you love me, you better not telling other chics
My love is crazy
My love is sick
