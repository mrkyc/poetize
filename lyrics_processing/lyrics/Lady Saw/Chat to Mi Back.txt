All dem cyan do
All dem cyan say
Mi man love me bad and him nah go no where
When dem a watch, and when dem a chat
Mi walk out pon dem and mi shoot out mi back

Chat to me back, chat to me back
Cuz dis a body that a gyal can't knock
Chat to me back, chat to me back

Unless yuh wan fi run out a di place
When yuh see mi man gyal don't violate
