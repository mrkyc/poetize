This is a classic one (wooah, yaaaaa)
The doctor and Lady Saw inna combination
Oh Lady Saw, you raw, you raw, you raw, you raw
Dedicated to mi man
Ayyy! Ayyy!

Mi man, (Cho!)
Nuff gyal a ask me what you dealing (How I'm dealing?)
Me tell dem, a you have the healing ('Cause I'm the doctor)
I can't forget how you make me stretch to the ceiling
Oh Beenie Man it is impossible
I can't stop wuking with you
Mi man can't you feel it too?
You wuk me like a stallion

Lady Saw (Wha'?!)
Don't you worry yourself cause me nah chaw
You know man a bad man, man a outlaw
You are the girl who brought the joy in my world
Oh Saw, this is possible, cho
I woulda wuk you even if you cripple
Coulda blind, you coulda deaf, or coulda handicap too
I love the woman weh inside of you (but true)
You might also like
A true you hot, and mi round, mi mek you select mi sound
Nuff man outta road waan take 'way your crown
Mi love how you ride and move your waist line
Give me the bubble and draw the chalk line

Mi man, (Cho!)
Nuff gyal a ask me what you dealing (How I'm dealing?)
Me tell dem, a you have the healing ('Cause I'm the doctor)
I can't forget how you make me stretch to the ceiling
Oh Beenie Man it is impossible
I can't stop wuking with you
Mi man can't you feel it too?
You make me gallop like a stallion

True I'm the doctor, I'm no actor, inna the business this is the factor
You're little and you're cute
You want a man? Why don't you come yah?
You want a man to wuk you right, someone to love you proper
If a the work to make you splurt, then I will pop off your skirt
Yes, me nah go run leave me shirt

But, Lady Saw (Wha'?!)
Don't you worry yourself cause me nah chaw
Because man a bad man, man a outlaw
And don't you know say bad a nuh ol' squaw
You are the girl who brought the joy in my world
Oh Saw, this is possible
I woulda wuk you even if you cripple
Coulda blind, you coulda deaf, or full handicap too
I love the woman weh inside of you
Beenie Man, with your nine millimeter you will get any gal
Nuff waan fi war, but me know me official
Mi nah watch no face, mi a wife material
The rest of them a just scandal!
When you give me wha' you have, say, me nah blow your job
You a outlaw and me a hot gal
Want it real raw, Beenie Man you nah stall
Give me the loving, make me bawl

So Beenie Man, (Cho!)
Nuff gyal a ask me what you dealing (How I'm dealing?)
Me tell dem, a you have the healing ('Cause I'm the doctor)
I can't forget how you make me stretch to the ceiling
Oh Beenie Man it is impossible
I can't stop wuking with you
Mi man can't you feel it too?
You wuk me like a stallion

You a hear me Saw?
Don't you worry yourself cause me nah chaw
Because man a bad man, man a outlaw
You are the girl who brought the joy in my world
Oh Saw, this is possible, cho
I woulda wuk you even if you cripple
Coulda blind, you coulda deaf, or coulda handicap too
I love the woman weh inside of you (but true)
Lady Saw!
Your knee knock, but you fat, me love the dimple weh you got
All me temperature rise, and inna the bath a where we drop
You a soap up all mi chest and all a rub down all mi back
