Infertility is a word that a lot of people are ashamed to mention
A lot of people are so illiterate when it come to that word
They act as if it's a crime if you can't have a child
But I don't think so, I don't have a child, I may one day
But in the mean time I am going to share all my love
Chorus:
Not having a child don't make me less than a woman
You see I got so much love to give, to so much unwanted kids
You can say all you want about me trying to ruin my reputation
But I have so much love to give to so much unwanted kids
Listen to my song
Verse 1:
I may not know the joy of giving birth
May not experience the pain and all the hurt
But I know how it feels to lose a child
And if pain is pain then I am hurting inside
If infertility makes me less than a girl
What would I say to many women in this world
Would you tell them have faith
Would you tell them be strong
Or would you tell them that they're less than a woman?
Chorus:
Not having a child don't make me less than a woman
You see I got so much love to give, to so much unwanted kids
You can say all you want about me trying to ruin my reputation
But I have so much love to give to so much unwanted kids
Listen to my song

I would give anything to have a child of my own
But in the meantime let me share my happy home
With the less fortunate, take away some of the stress from a child
Who has never known love and happiness
Miscarriages remind me of baby carriages
Broken hearts bring failed marriages
The pain never go away, we try to keep them at bay
Oh I wish if my baby could have stayed
Chorus:
Not having a child don't make me less than a woman
You see I got so much love to give, to so much unwanted kids
You can say all you want about me trying to ruin my reputation
But I have so much love to give to so much unwanted kids
Listen to my song
Verse 3:
Some people have kids and wish them never did
Some kids grew up hating the life weh them live
Some have it easy, some have it hard
Some mothers abandon dem pickney like dawg
But wanti wanti dem can't get it
And getti getti get and run weh lef eeh
Me nuh have none so you know me will take eeh
Me have a lot of love so send me little pickney on
Chorus:
Not having a child don't make me less than a woman
You see I got so much love to give, to so much unwanted kids
You can say all you want about me trying to ruin my reputation
But I have so much love to give to so much unwanted kids
Listen to my song
