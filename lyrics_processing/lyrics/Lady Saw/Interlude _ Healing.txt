Healing
Beenie Man & Lady Saw
This is classic one (ooh, yah)
The doctor and Lady Saw in a combination

Oh Lady Saw yuh raw, yuh raw yuh raw, yuh raw, yuh raw

Mi man (cho) nuff gal a ask me what yuh dealing
Mi tell them a you have the healing
A can't forget how yuh make mi stretch to the ceiling
Oh Beenie Man it is impossible I can't stop wucking with you
Mi man can't you feel it too, yuh wuck me like a stallion

Lady Saw (wah) don't you worry yuh self cause mi nah chaw
Yuh know man a bad man man a outlaw
You are the girl who brought the joy in my world
Oh Saw this is possible, a would a wuck yuh even if yuh cripple

Ah love the woman whey inside a you (but true)

Yuh a soap up all mi chest and all a rub down all mi back
