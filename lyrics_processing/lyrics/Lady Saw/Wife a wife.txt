Mate fi have manners
Dem fi only speak when they're spoken to
Or dem nuh fi chat none at all
And if dem eva call mi name yuh see
Mi say

Wife a wife, mate a mate
Fight a fight, tings will break
Me a one gal, me nuh like trace
Mi name nuh fi deh pon debate
Call mi name inna yuh mout if yuh bright
Can't come nutten bout mi weh mi nuh like
When yuh see me and mi man ride out pon a bike
Try tek me off if yuh nuh love your life
Mek your liquor spill when mi step inna di place
See who draw nil when mi fling an a drape
Mi nah stand still, me a wife, mi nuh mate
An mi nuh pay bills when me go pon date, oh
A gal fi know she ain't nutten but a hush
Man drive and park mi like truck
Nah gih dem nutten caw dem always bruk
And when dem see wife, dem waan fi talk up
But tell a gal when she see mi, she fi cut
Fi har job a fi bend down and duck
No man nuh waan dem, but dem waan play stuck
When wifey come through, all matey shut up
You might also like
Call mi name inna yuh mout if yuh bright
Can't come nutten bout mi weh mi nuh like
When yuh see me and mi man ride pon a bike
Try tek me off if yuh nuh love your life
Mek your liquor spill when mi step inna di place
See who draw nil when mi fling an a drape
Mi nah stand still, me a wife, mi nuh mate
And me nuh pay bills when me go pon date, oh

Wey eye nuh see, heart nuh leap
But di man a fi mi, some gal will get beat
If yuh a creep yuh betta hide and dweet
If yuh nuh waan lose 32 teet
Facebook dat, Twitter dis
If mi ketch yuh inna di act
Mi nah go hitch
My head hot, I'm so sick
So tell a gal mine who she diss

Call mi name inna yuh mout if yuh bright
Can't come nutten bout mi weh mi nuh like
When yuh see me and mi man ride pon a bike
Try tek me off if yuh nuh love your life
Mek your liquor spill when mi step inna di place
See who draw nil when mi fling an a drape
Mi nah stand still, me a wife, mi nuh mate
And me nuh pay bills when me go pon date, oh
You ain't nutten but a one night stand
I see you trying hard to take my man
But you will never ever understand
That you will never never never wear his wedding band
Oh really
A couldn't me you a talk
Really, him tell yuh dogs dem nuh bark
Sincerely, me a him other half
We done tek di vows till death do us part

Call mi name inna yuh mout if yuh bright
Can't come nutten bout mi weh mi nuh like
When yuh see me and mi man ride pon a bike
Try tek me off if yuh nuh love your life
Mek your liquor spill when mi step inna di place
See who draw nil when mi fling an a drape
Mi nah stand still, me a wife, mi nuh mate
