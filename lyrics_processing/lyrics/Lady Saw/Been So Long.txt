(Talking)
I wait up all night, now its morning
U?ve been gone for so long; didn?t even try calling
If u don?t mind tell me where have u been
Is she the reason why I ain?t getting no loving cause...
Chorus
It?s been so long since u touch me
I miss the way ur hands arrest me
I gets no loving from u lately
Ur lies has changed the mood; it aggravates me
Verse 1
Baby tell me now what?s going on
Do I no longer turn u on?
Where is the love baby where it?s gone?
Cause I feel like moving on
Is she beautiful? Treats u wonderful
Is she qualified to keep satisfied?
Tell me when u look in her eyes, do u get hypnotized?
Do u ever fantasize about me laying by ur side? Because?
