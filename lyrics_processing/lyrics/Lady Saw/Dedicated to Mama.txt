Mama I love you even though
You're not care with me
I miss you so much I think of you
Like constantly
God must have the reason why took you from me
Maybe the reason was to set you spirit free
Cause now i know worth it's like raising in family
And being a wife
Struggle in every day
All when kids dying
Try to please everyone
And even givin up a fight
Now I know
How ???? skills
Have six children
Waiting on a meal
Without no doe
Or no job to go
Its hard to face to my row
Im holding in down
Demy cyan push me round
Demy cyan get mi out
Cause you no say mi no clown
Im wear di crown
The tock a town
And even when Im said I wear no frown
You might also like(chorus)
Mama I love you even though
You're not care with me
I miss you so much lady I think of you
Like constantly
God must have the reason why took you from me
Maybe the reason was to set you spirit free
Oh mama anyway you deh memba dis
You memory lives on and you sadly miss
To be with you again girl that is my wish
And even though you gone your number one

(chorus)
Mama I love you even though
You're not care with me

Everyday youre in my thought
Every time I pray you breaks my heart
Cause now i know worth it's like raising in family
And being a wife
Struggle in every day
All when kids dying
Try to please everyone
And even givin up a fight
Now I know

Have six children
Waiting on a meal
Without no doe
Or no job to go
Its hard to face to my row
