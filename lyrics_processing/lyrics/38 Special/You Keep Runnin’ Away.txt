I hear your high-heels clickin' down the boulevard
You got your suitcase in hand, guess you're takin' it hard
You swear you'll never trust another man
Ah, but I know that you will, it's just a question of when

So open up your eyes to the light
You've been far too alone for too many nights, oh

Someday, someway, somewhere, love is gonna find you
Somehow, someone is gonna beg you to stay
But you keep on runnin', you keep runnin'
You keep on runnin' away, ooh

I hear it whispered in the neighborhood
At one time, you were the best, it was just understood
Then someone came and took you for a fool
The word is out on the street that love is looking for you

So open up your eyes to the light
You've been far too alone for too many nights, oh

Someday, someway, somewhere, love is gonna find you
Somehow, somewhere, don't look now, I'm comin' up behind you
But you keep runnin', you keep runnin'
You keep on runnin' away
Yes, you do, baby

So don't be fooled, you got me comin'
I ain't no fool, you keep me runnin'
And I don't know why
No, I don't know why
So open up, don't be afraid, baby
Is there someone standin' in our way
Won't you tell me why
Don't you tell me goodbye, oh

Someday, someway, somewhere, love is gonna find you
Somehow, someone is gonna beg you to stay, baby
Somehow, somewhere, don't look now, I'm comin' up behind you
But you keep runnin', you keep runnin'
You keep on runnin' away
But you keep on runnin', you keep runnin'
You keep on runnin' away
But you keep on runnin', you keep runnin'
You keep on runnin' away
But you keep on runnin', you keep runnin' away
But you keep on runnin', you keep runnin' away
But you keep on runnin', you keep runnin' away
