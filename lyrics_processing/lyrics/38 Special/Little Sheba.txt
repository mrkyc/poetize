I took a business trip
Down to Florida
I got a room at a Holiday Inn
There was an earthquake in California
Must be the reason why this place was shakin'
Down in the barroom it was
Loaded with servicemen
That's loaded servicemen
Elbow to elbow
I said, "Scuze me, blood
Just what is shakin?"
He say, "Girls on the dance floor
Wrestling in jello"
And the joint was jammin'
From the pumpin' by the D. J
They were rappin' and clappin'
When up steps Little Sheba

Little Sheba, she's as tough as you find
She's the local color burnin' like a Florida Pine
They raise the girls on gator down here, doncha know
Little Sheba, she's the favorite one
Everybody's got their money on her 9 to 1
They raise the girls on gator down here, doncha know

Into the ring steps her worthy opponent
A nasty little vixen with a New York vibe
Before Little Sheba could say
"Welcome to Dixie"
She kicked all her buttons
And punched out her headlights
And the crowd was reelin'
They were chomping and chanting
They can't believe what they're seein'
Didn't look good for Little Sheba

Little Sheba, she's as tough as you find
She's the local color burnin' like a Florida pine
They raise the girls on gator down here, doncha know
Little Sheba, she's the favorite one
Everybody's got money on her 9 to 1
They raise the girls on gator down here, doncha know

Now to make a long story
Just a little bit longer
Little Sheba was humbled on that humid night
She returned from emergency
With a fistful of fractures
Our fabled femme fatale
Spoilin' for another fight
Little Sheba, she's as tough as you find
She's the local color burnin' like a Florida Pine
Little Sheba, she's the favorite one
Everybody's got money on her 9 to 1
They raise the girls on
They raise the girls on
They raise the girls on gators down here, doncha know

Little Sheba!
Little Sheba
Little Sheba
Hey, Little Sheba!
Little Sheba
