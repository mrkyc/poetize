Go down to the desk, pay for alcohol
Jump into a car, hope we make the plane in time
Smile for all the ladies as we're passin' through the line
I'll be down in the back, where those engines roar
Gonna make that attack on this town once more
(Well) they say we're runnin' late to make it to the show
But when the lights go down, you can sure bet I'm ready to go
Take 'em out
Kickin' up dust, make 'em jump and shout
Take 'em out, take 'em out
Rock 'n roll's what it's all about
Hit the stage runnin', got our motor's runnin' fast
Crankin' up our guitars, gonna kick some ass
Ain't no use in lyin', that's what we came to do
Give 'em all we got to make our message get through
I'll be down in the back, where those engines roar
Gonna make that attack, gonna start once more
People stand in line, waitin' for the show
But when the lights go down, you can sure bet I'm ready to go
Take 'em out
Kickin' up dust, make 'em jump and shout
Take 'em out, take 'em out
Rock and roll is what it's all about
