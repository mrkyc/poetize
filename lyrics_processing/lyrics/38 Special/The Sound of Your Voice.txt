Knock down the doors and break through the walls
Tear out the phone and run from it all
I'm here to tell you, babe
It's been one of those days

I get a feelin' when I'm feelin' like this
My heart's a target you never miss
You got a way of puttin' everything in it's place

Takin' your time
Take all your precious time
It's all that you say and just how you say it
A serious game you start playin'
You never fail to amaze me

It's your voice I hear drivin' me wild
Whispering in my ear
It's your voice I hear, dangerous child
Sayin' what I wanna hear
If I had my choice, I'd run for cover
But I think I'll be ok
'Cause all I needed to hear
Was the sound of your voice
The sound of your voice

Curl your words up into the air
Run your poetry through my hair
Call me that name you call me when there's no one around

Takin' your time
Take all your precious time
It's all that you say and just how you say it
Serious game you start playin'
You never fail to amaze me

It's your voice I hear drivin' me wild
Whispering in my ear
It's your voice I hear, dangerous child
Sayin' what I wanna hear
If I had my choice, I'd run for cover
But I think I'll be ok
'Cause all I needed to hear
Is the sound of your voice
The sound of your voice

Bye, baby, bye-bye
I can tell you that I
Miss the sound of your voice already
Bye, baby, bye-bye
Doesn't matter where I go
It's your voice I hear
If I had my choice, I'd run for cover
But I think I'll be ok
I can't say I'm going crazy
But you make a pretty good case
You never fail to amaze

It's your voice I hear drivin' me wild
Whispering in my ear
It's your voice I hear, dangerous child
Sayin' what I wanna hear
It's your voice I hear drivin' me wild
Whispering in my ear
It's your voice I hear, dangerous child
Sayin' what I wanna hear
It's your voice
It's your voice
It's your voice
