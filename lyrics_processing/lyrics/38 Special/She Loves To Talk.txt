Grabs a cup o' coffee then she's on that phone..

That woman loves to Talk (... She loves to talk... Talk)
Yeah, she's what I want (she's what I want)
I don't mean to sound complainin'
She's my source of entertainment
That woman loves to talk!
Conversation ain't no trouble... In this family
She keeps me stimulated more than my new tv
(2nd Chorus)
That woman loves to Talk (... She loves to talk... Talk)
Yeah, she's what I want. (she's what I want)
She shoulda been a politician...
Got more wind than an air condition..
That woman Loves to Talk!

Well, I know she might be different, that's what I like
She's something else when we turn down the light
It's hard to resist her, it's hard to explain
I love to hear her voice when she calls my name

That woman loves to Talk! (... She loves to talk... Talk..)
Yeah, she's what I want (she's what I want)
I wouldn't change a thing about her
Wouldn't live this life without her
That woman Loves to Talk!
She could own Southern Bell.. For as much as she talks
She gets her recreation makin' long-distance calls!
(4th Chorus)
That woman Loves to Talk (... She loves to talk... Talk..)
Yeah she's what I want (she's what I want)
I don't mean to sound complainin'
She's my source of entertainment
That woman Loves to Talk!
(2nd Bridge)
Yeah, she talks about this
Sometimes she talks about that
Every operator knows her name and address (... She loves to talk... Talk..)
Can you hold on, please
I'll check the line
I hope you got plenty of quarters and dimes!
(5th Chorus)
That Woman Loves to Talk (... She loves to talk... Talk..)
Yeah, she's what I want (she's what I want)
I wouldn't change a thing about her
Wouldn't live this life without her
That woman Loves to Talk! (... She loves to talk!)
I wouldn't change a thing about her
Wouldn't live this life without her
That woman Loves to Talk! (... She loves to talk!)
I wouldn't change a thing about her
Wouldn't live this life without her
