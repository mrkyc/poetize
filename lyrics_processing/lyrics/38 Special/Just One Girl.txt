Playin loose, playin fast
Out there in every town
But this guy
I'll be satisfied
With that certain kind o' look
In the corner of her eye
I'm findin' my direction and I know what counts
Got my wild side just for one
I'll give her my affection, never let her down
When the right girl comes along
I don't ask much
From this big wide world
Just wanna make a difference
To just one girl
I don't care
How this whole plan works
If I can make a difference in the life
Of Just One Girl
Now the last time
I was losing the race
For the biggest payoff
Lookin' in the wrong place
But this time
Now I know what I feel
Got a handle on it
Now I'm livin' it real
There's been so many others
So many empty nights
That was never me anyway
It was just a lonely boy
Who was lookin for his life
If you're out there
I'm here to say...
