I heard you're askin' how I'm feeling
I guess I'll play it day by day
I'm still around now, my heart is healing
But some things never gonna change

'Cause now I know love ain't easy to find
I let you go, now I'm changing my mind

I know that love, it don't come easy
It took so long, it's been hard to find
So love, you must believe me
Ain't gonna let it slip away
I know I was wrong
I want you back where you belong
Want you back where you belong
Back where you belong

I played around now, I've done some dealin'
I found that love should be with you
And so you're gone now, my head is reelin'
Don't wanna be with someone new

Everything that we've been through
