Didn't wanna be a ghost
But you pushed me over and over
Never thought I'd have a vice
Other than you, over and over

Left you in the sky with the fire below
Thought I had it right, but I'm still

Lost in the light
And I don't know what night it is
You're somewhere else, I'm drinking not to guess
Blurry bodies, but you're on my mind
We let it go now I'm full of rum and regret
I go out just so I can reforget

I go out just so I, can reforget (Reforget)
I go out just so I, can reforget (Reforget)
I go out, go out

I never thought a sunrise
Could burn more than a midnight without you
Already paying for tonight
Head spins like carousel, over and over
You might also like
Left you in the sky with the fire below
Thought I had it right, but I'm still

Lost in the light
And I don't know what night it is
You're somewhere else, I'm drinking not to guess
Blurry bodies, but you're on my mind
We let it go now I'm full of rum and regret
I go out just so I can reforget

I go out just so I, can reforget (Reforget)
I go out just so I, can reforget (Reforget)
I go out just so I, can reforget (Reforget)
I go out just so I, can reforget (Reforget)
I go out, go out

Two more footsteps on the wood floor, but it ain't you
I'm faded so I bring someone home
Over and over, I do this and I'm still

Lost in the light (Woah)
And I don't know what night it is (Yeah)
You're somewhere else, I'm drinking not to guess (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Blurry bodies, but you're on my mind (Yeah, yeah)
We let it go now I'm full of rum and regret
I go out just so I can reforget
I go out just so I, can reforget (Reforget)
I go out just so I, can reforget (Reforget)
I go out just so I, can reforget (Reforget)
I go out just so I, can reforget (Reforget)
