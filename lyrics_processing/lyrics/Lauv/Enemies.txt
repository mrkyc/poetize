I thought we said we're good
Was I misunderstood?
You lookin' at me so cold
After all that we've been through
How could you pretend?
I'm someone that you don't know

I'm so sick of planning all my nights, nights
'round avoiding you, it's gotta end
We don't have to love again or try, try
But can you tell me

Oh, why do we, we have to be
Enemies, enemies?
Forget all the scars, all that they are
Memories, memories
Oh, I know it hurts 'cause I feel it too
But after all, all that we been through, yeah
Oh, why do we, we have to be
Enemies, enemies?

You see me walkin' towards
You're headed for the door
Why is your shoulder so cold?
I know it's hard to speak
With all our history
But that don't mean you should go
You might also like
I'm so sick of planning all my nights, nights
'round avoiding you it's gotta end
We don't have to love again or try, try
But can you tell me

Oh, why do we, we have to be
Enemies, enemies?
Forget all the scars, all that they are
Memories, memories
Oh, I know it hurts 'cause I feel it too
But after all, all that we been through
Oh, why do we, we have to be
Enemies, enemies?

Oh, tell me why did, why did we
Throw away the love we had?
And tell me why do, why do we
Love to make it hurt so bad
Yeah, I know that we can't be friends
But after all the things we been
Oh, why do we, we have to be enemies? Oh

Oh, why do we, we have to be
Enemies, enemies?
Forget all the scars, all that they are
Memories, memories
Oh, I know it hurts 'cause I feel it too
But after all, all that we been through, yeah
Oh, why do we, we have to be
