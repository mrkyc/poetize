It's not me you're really mad at
I see it in your eyes
She's always had you pissed off
And you hold it deep inside
I'm telling you to let go, let go
You told me give you a chance
To feel the way you feel, but so you know
Even if I don't quite understand

Baby, I'll stand
Even if I'm blind, I'll pay no mind
Baby, I'll stand
Even when you drive me half, you drive me half insane
If you promise that and then it's not in vain
If you'll always do the same for me

I won't question, question it
I won't question, question it
I won't question, question it
Hey hey hey, hey hey hey, hey hey

You think I'm oblivious
Maybe that's true
I don't notice, my heart is too focused
On trying to do right by you, by you, by you
I can't control the actions, actions
Of somebody else
Don't give them satisfaction, no
Just leave them on the shelf, oh baby
You might also like
You know I'll stand
Even if I'm blind, I'll pay no mind
Baby, I'll stand
Even when you drive me half, you drive me half insane
If you promise that and then it's not in vain
If you'll always do the same for me

I won't question, question it
I won't question, question it
I won't question, question it
Hey hey hey, hey hey hey, hey hey

Why do LA girls always have this attitude from out of nowhere?
Turning nothing into something, oh girl please don't go there
I even changed my number, I don't know how they're still calling
Just come back to bed, I'll fix all this shit in the morning
It's nothing I can't handle, don't wanna waste these candles
As soon as we get done another one like Khaled's sandals
First thing I'll do is make sure you won't ever second guess it
You know I love you, that ain't a question

I won't question, question it
I won't question, question it
I won't question, question it
Hey hey hey, hey hey hey, hey hey
I'll always
Put it down, down, down for you baby
Put it down, down, down for you baby
Put it down, down, down for you baby
Hey hey hey, hey hey hey, hey hey
Put it down, down, down for you baby
Put it down, down, down, down, down, down
Put it down, down, down for you baby
Put it down, down, down, down, down, down
Put it down, down, down for you baby
Put it down, down, down, down, down, down
