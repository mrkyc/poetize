Ooh

You're like a God, I feel so hot
I got it bad, it's a habit
I'm in withdrawal, I need a hit
My body's cold, gotta have it

Just a dose to remedy the taking away the death of me
I get a buzz to feel alive, I get a rush deep inside
Just a touch is all I need to trigger the sweetest dopamine
You're taking away the death of me
I can hit it, quit it, not addicted, you know it's a lie

You get me high like a painkiller, like a painkiller
You numb the pain, you're blowing my mind
Like a painkiller, you're the painkiller
That gets me, gets me, gets me high

You think I'm cryptic, a touch sadistic
But baby, that's how you made me
You bring the fever, my drug dealer
God, I love how you fix me

You get me high like a painkiller, like a painkiller
You numb the pain, you're blowing my mind

That gets me, gets me, gets me high
Painkiller, painkiller, you're the painkiller
That gets me, gets me, gets me high

You get me high like a painkiller, like a painkiller
You're blowing my mind, like a painkiller, you're the painkiller
Gets me, gets me, gets me high

So blow my mind like a painkiller,  like a painkiller
You're getting me high like a painkiller, you're the painkiller

Painkiller, painkiller, you're the painkiller
That gets me, gets me, gets me high
Painkiller, painkiller, you're the painkiller
