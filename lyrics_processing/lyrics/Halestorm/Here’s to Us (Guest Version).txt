We could just go home right now
Or maybe we could stick around
For just one more drink, oh yeah
Get another bottle out
Let's shoot the shit
Sit back down
For just one more drink, oh yeah

Here's to us
Here's to love
All the times that we fucked up
Here's to you
Fill the glass
'Cause the last few days
Have kicked my ass
So let's give 'em hell
Wish everybody well
Here's to us
Here's to us

We stuck it out this far together
Put our dreams through the shredder
Let's toast 'cause things got better
And everything could change like that
And all these years go by so fast
But nothing lasts forever

That we messed up
Here's to you
Fill the glass
'Cause the last few nights have kicked my ass
If they give you hell
Tell 'em to go fuck themselves
Here's to us

Here's to all that we kissed
And to all that we missed
To the biggest mistakes
That we just wouldn't trade
To us breaking up
Without us breaking down
To whatever's coming our way
