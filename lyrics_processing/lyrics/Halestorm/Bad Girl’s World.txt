They all say I've lost my mind
But I'm just tryin' to find a better way
'Cause somewhere in this sea of fools
The real truth is they're scared
Because you're brave, you'll be ok

If you'll be yourself for no one else
They'll hate you 'cause you're beautiful
So blaze the trail that no one can
'Cause they'll never understand

That we live in a bad girls' world
Bad girls' world, bad girls
And we're running a bad girls' world
Bad girls' world, bad girls

That we live in a bad girls' world
Bad girls' world, bad girls
And we're running a bad girls' world
Bad girls' world, bad girls

All you rebel babies (Bad girls)
And you pretty thing with the dirty mouth, oh
Oh yeah, tell them, tell them, tell them
Times are changing
And we will never back down
This is our house now
