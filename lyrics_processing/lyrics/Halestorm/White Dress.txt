I used to be tryna be perfect in every way
I used to care about what people say
I never questioned beyond picket fences (Beyond picket fences)
I'm not afraid about where I fit into the frame
Satisfied to drive in my own lane
Sick of denying, used to be as dying

I'll never be, I'll never be
All of the things that you need me to be
You'll never see, you'll never see
That version of me

I'm not the girl in the white dress (No)
I'm not your fairytale princess
I'm sorry, mama, that I made you cry
Someday you'll know the reason why
I'm not the girl in the white dress (No)
I'm embracing my darkness
I'm really sorry that I let you down (Let you down)
But I'm still gonna make you proud

Close your eyes
Why don't you try to keep an open mind?
I hope you know how hard I really tried
It might be a hard truth but it's not about you (But it's not about you)
This is mine so don't treat me like I'm a crime
My life, my lesson learned in time
Don't hold it against you, you're allowed to be you
