Skulls, a billion empty skulls
Filling their empty lungs
With the wrong kind of drugs
Baby what have we become?
A billion empty skulls
Dumb and out for blood
Forgot about the love
Just another empty
Skulls

Damn, draw another line
Bring the other side
Make up another lie
If you can't see eye to eye
Feed your empty skull
Leave the tv on
Believe what you want
If you can't see right or wrong

I can't close my eyes
And make it fade
I won't shut my mouth and take it
God, no, I won't be another empty skull
No, I won't give you something beautiful (There it goes)

Damn, crossed another line
Start another fight
Better run and hide
Don't wanna hurt your pride
Eat your chemicals
Keep it nice and dull
There's no need to learn
When you think you know it all

I can't close my mind
And walk away
I won't shut my mouth
And take it
God, no, I won't be another empty skull
