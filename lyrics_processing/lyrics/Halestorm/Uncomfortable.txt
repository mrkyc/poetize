I did it 'cause I wanna
And I did it 'cause I'm gonna
I did it just because I can
I did it 'cause it makes me feel so good
And I did it because fuck "the man"
I did it 'cause I'm crazy
And no one's gonna save me
And I did it just to cut the noise
I did it 'cause I'm drunk
And I did it yeah, so what?
'Cause baby, I'm just one of the boys

I did it all
To break every single preconceived notion
That you have
I did it all to shake every single one of your emotions
And just to make you

Uncomfortable
I love to make you
Uncomfortable

I do it 'cause I love it
And I want some more of it
And I do it 'cause you said I can't
I do it 'cause you fight it
And I know you don't like it when I open up and talk about sex
I do it 'cause you hate me
And I do it for the ladies
And with all of my good time friends
I do it 'cause the whole damn world's gone crazy
And fuck it man, this is the end!

I did it all
To break every single preconceived notion
That you have
I did it all to rape every single one of your emotions
And just to make you

Uncomfortable
I love to make you
Uncomfortable
I love to make you

Well, I don't wanna bring you down
So why you wanna bring me down?
Don't bring me down (no)
Don't bring me down
I did it all to shake every single one of your emotions
And just to make you

Uncomfortable
I love to make you
