Jump into the fire
Dive in headfirst into the flames
We're broken and tired
But giving in is not the way

Here we are, killing ourselves to live
We just need one more hit
And we might just live forever
Oh, here we are
We're going down with this ship
And if this is our last trip
At least we'll go together
We might just live forever

Hang on till the morning
Watch the war light up the sky
Cave without a warning
But we'll be dead before we say "die"

Here we are, killing ourselves to live
We just need one more hit
And we might just live forever
Oh, here we are
We're going down with this ship
And if this is our last trip
At least we'll go together
We might just live forever
