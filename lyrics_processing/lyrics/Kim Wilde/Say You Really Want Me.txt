Why you always got to be so cool?
And why I always got to play your fool?
You don't really know what life's about, oh no
So baby, come and let your feelings out, ooh-woah

(Say you really want me) Don't keep it to yourself
(Say you really need me) Just me and no one else
(Say you really love me) Ooh, let me know it's true
(Say you really want me) The way that I want you tonight

You don't know a thing about romance
Deep inside, you're scared to take a chance (Take a chance)
'Cause love like this can never come again, oh no
So make your move or I'll be in the wind, oh-oh

(Say you really want me) Don't keep it to yourself
(Say you really need me) Just me and no one else
(Say you really love me) Ooh, let me know it's true
(Say you really want me) The way that I want you
You might also like
I need somebody through the thick and the thin
'Cause I know the problems of today
Time is over now for playing those games
Let's take it all the way

(Say you really want me) Don't keep it to yourself
(Say you really need me) Just me and no one else
(Say you really love me) Ooh, let me know it's true
(Say you really want me) The way that I want you

Do ya? Do ya? Do ya, do ya, do ya?
Do ya? Do ya? Do ya, do ya, do ya?
Do ya? Do ya? Do ya, do ya, do ya?
Do ya? Do ya?

The way that I want you, yeah
Do ya? Do ya? Do ya, do ya, do ya? (Say you want me)
Do ya? Do ya? Do ya, do ya, do ya? (Do ya really need me?)
