They're all gonna know me someday
Well you got what you wanted
But look at you now
You lost something good on the way
So where did it go
Tell me where did it go
But you wouldn't know
Snap your fingers and somebody runs
You don't care how they feel
Just as long as they come
Got your head in the stars
Now you've come this far
Just who do you think you are ?
Now everything seems to be going your way
And everyone loves what they see
But you ruin it all with the things that you say
So tell me how does it feel
When you're all alone
How does it feel
You're alone
Nothing is real
Snap your fingers and somebody runs
You don't care how they feel
Just as long as they come
Got your head in the stars
Now you've come this far
Just who do you think you are ?
You believe a ridiculous lie
You can't see you've become
All the things you despise
But I know who you are
And you've gone too far
Just who do you think you are ?

But you don't have to lose yourself
Cos one day you're gonna break
When the face in the mirror
Looking back at you's
A stranger that you can't place
Just who do you think you are ?
Snap your fingers and somebody runs
You don't care how they feel
Just as long as they come
Got your head in the stars
Now you've come this far
Just who do you think you are ?
You believe a ridiculous lie
You can't see you've become
All the things you despise
But I know who you are
And you've gone too far
