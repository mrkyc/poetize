Two of us growing up together
Through a golden age
We never realized it
Our lives you changed
Days of pure inspiration
Will live in our hearts forever
And as the years went by
Dreaming of our destinies
Believing in the power of a melody
In your songs we found magical music
Words and sound
The seasons come and go again
And what was old is new again, yeah
They say you're over, times have changed, the end
But there's no end to this story
Just look at what you've become
And so the story goes on

Pop pop music
Give me pop pop music
Don't stop, give me pop
Give me pop pop music
Give me hip hop, rock
Give me punk, give me funk
Don't stop with the pop pop music
The melody's your legacy I know
You give me something to believe
So give me pop pop music
Give me pop pop music
Don't stop with the pop
Don't stop pop music
You might also like
You hit the hurdles
But you never fail to run
You fire the gun
You overcome, yeah
When you lose your way
You come back twice as strong
Here you go
You're number one
The seasons come and go again (go again)
And what was old is new again (new again)
They say you're over, times have changed, yeah
But there's no end to this story
Just look at what you've become

Pop pop music
Give me pop pop music
Don't stop, give me pop
Give me pop pop music
Give me hip hop, rock
Give me punk, give me funk
Don't stop with the pop pop music
The melody's your legacy I know
You give me something to believe
So give me pop pop music
Give me pop pop music
Don't stop with the pop
Don't stop pop music
Give me hip hop, rock
Give me punk, give me funk
Don't stop with the pop pop pop
