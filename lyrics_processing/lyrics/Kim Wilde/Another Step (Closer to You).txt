Never, ever
Felt this way before
You are the one
That I've been craving for

Another step nearer your heart
Another step closer to knowing you
Another step nearer your heart
I'm on my way

I never thought it could happen
Being close to someone like you
But you know this isn't just a minute affair
If we make time and take a lot of care
'Cause I love everything about it (Everything, yeah)
There's such a good feel about it
And I know where I'm gonna be
If you take a step closer to me (Oh)

Another step nearer your heart
Another step closer to knowing you
Another step nearer your heart
I'm on my way
You might also like
I couldn't even describe it (Ooh-ooh)
Though I tried, I couldn't find the words (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
When you stumble through life
And love is one step away (Yeah, nah)
Carry on or do you stay?
We've got to promise faithfully (Faithfully)
To hang on to each other and never leave
That's the way love's gonna be
If you take a step closer to me, come on now

Another step nearer your heart
Another step closer to knowing you
Another step nearer your heart
I'm on my way

The only way to deal with affairs of the heart
You've got to jump right in, doesn't matter who starts, oh
Take a step nearer (Oh-ho) come over here (Yeah)
Together, we can make it tonight
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Another step, another step
Another step (No, no) another step (No, no, yeah)
Another step nearer your heart (Aye, oh-oh)
Another step closer to knowing you (Just another step)
Another step nearer your heart (Ooh)
I'm on my way (Come on now, come on now)
Another step nearer your heart (Oh)
Another step closer to holding you  (Yeah, yeah)
Another step nearer your heart
I'm on my way (Oh, I'm on my way)
I'm on my way (Girl, we're on our way)
