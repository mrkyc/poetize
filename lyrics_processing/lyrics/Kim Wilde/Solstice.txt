Lighthouse shine for me
I've been drifting so far
Guide me back from the sea
To the place I was before
I've been losing my way
Now I can't see the stars
Anymore
They didn't make it home
Now her hand drops the phone
She stands there paralyzed
"Your washing's on the bed"
The last words that were said
Now she's screaming, she's screaming
She's screaming
Why couldn't you share your pain
I thought you could me everything
Now it's too late, too late
It's too late
Your lives had just begun
Why do they end as one

So now eternal night descends
With tears that never end
And words that make no sense
You might also like
Sing to me, sing me a beautiful song
Sing the words that you never could say
When we were here, together
Sing to me, how did I get it so wrong
Did you try but you just
Couldn't fight against the fear
And now we're out of time
Why did you have to fly
So far away from here, forever?
Forever together

Our last forever changed
On this the longest day
A summer gone too soon
The questions fill my mind
No answer there to find
I'm bleeding, I'm bleeding
I'm bleeding

So now eternal night descends
With tears that never end
And words that make no sense
Sing to me, sing me a beautiful song
Sing the words that you never could say
When we were here, together
Sing to me, how did I get it so wrong
Did you try but you just
Couldn't fight against the fear
And now we're out of time
Why did you have to fly
So far away from here, forever?
Forever together

Forever together now

Sing to me, sing me a beautiful song
The words that you never could say
When you were here
