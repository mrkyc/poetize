I don't want nobody baby
If I can't have you, oh oh oh oh
If I can't have you
I don't want nobody baby
If I can't have you, oh oh oh...
Don't know why
I'm surviving every lonely day
When there's got to be
No chance for me
My life would end
And it doesn't matter how I cry
My tears of love
Are a waste of time
If I turn away
Am I strong enough to see it through?
Go crazy is what I will do
If I can't have you
I don't want nobody baby
If I can't have you, oh oh oh oh
If I can't have you
I don't want nobody baby
If I can't have you, oh oh oh...
You might also likeCan't let go
And it doesn't matter how I try
I gave it all so easily
To you my love
To dreams that never will come true
Am I strong enough to see it through?
Go crazy is what I will do
If I can't have you
I don't want nobody baby
If I can't have you, oh oh oh oh
If I can't have you
I don't want nobody baby
If I can't have you, oh oh oh...
No body body....
If I can't have you
No body body....
