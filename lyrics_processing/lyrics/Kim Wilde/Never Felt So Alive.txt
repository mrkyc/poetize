Do I lose you
Do I really look so strange
A woman alone is a danger
Is a stranger
She is better off in chains
Oh, how can it be you're happier now
Don't you feel half of you has gone
Sorry to say I've never felt so together
I've never felt this strong
I'm on my own again
And it's never felt so good
(I'm on my own)
I don't feel broken hearted
Don't feel that I should
I'm on my own again
Hard to believe but I never felt so alive
Why do you want to control me
Try to own me
Like a pet you'd like to tame
Don't look at me like I'm crazy
That's just lazy
Cause it's you that's got to change
You might also likeOh, how can it be you're happier now
Isn't it lonely on your own
Sorry to say my loneliest days have gone
And I've never felt so at home
I'm on my own again
And it's never felt so good
(I'm on my own)
I don't feel broken hearted
Don't feel that I should
I'm on my own again
Hard to believe but I never felt so alive
I'm on my own again
After all the years inside
(I'm on my own)
I've destroyed all the things that hurt me
Rediscovered my pride
I'm on my own again
Hard to believe but I never felt so alive
Feels so alive
I feel so alive
I'm on my own again
And it's never felt so good
(I'm on my own)
I don't feel broken hearted
Don't feel that I should
I'm on my own again
Hard to believe but I never felt so alive
Feels so alive
(I'm on my own)
I don't feel broken hearted
Don't feel that I should
