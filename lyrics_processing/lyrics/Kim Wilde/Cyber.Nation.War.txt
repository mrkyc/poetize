You hide behind the cyber screen
Feeling so protected 'cause you know you can't be seen
But words can play a dangerous game
It only takes a second but your life won't be the same

So tell me how do you sleep at night?

Anonymous vitriol from a dark place in your soul
Catch you sooner or later, gonna call you a hater
What you have to do that for?
I just can't take any more, of waking up
To another Cyber Nation War
Words from the tap of a finger
But you better remember
Words have the power to kill
Better think twice 'bout the message you send
What you have to do that for?
I just can't take anymore, of waking up
To another Cyber Nation War
(Cyber Nation War)

How do you sleep at night?
Where does your resentment lie?
It's time to face the truth
The one you hate the most is you
How can you be so cold?
I can't believe it's you
So now you've had you fun
The nightmare has just begun
You might also like
Your cowardly malicious lies
'Cause only devastation to everybody's lives
You'd never say it to their face
And never know the consequences till it's all too late

So tell me how do you sleep at night?

Anonymous vitriol from a dark place in your soul
Catch you sooner or later, gonna call you a hater
What you have to do that for?
I just can't take any more, of waking up
To another Cyber Nation War
Words from the tap of a finger
But you better remember
Words have the power to kill
Better think twice 'bout the message you send
What you have to do that for?
I just can't take anymore, of waking up
To another Cyber Nation War
