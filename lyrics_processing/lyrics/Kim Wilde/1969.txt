Oh-oh-oh oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh oh-oh
I'm sitting on the sofa with my eyes wide open watching black and white T.V
It's 1969 and two men are walking on the Sea of Tranquility
Can it be they really got a man to walk on the moon?
Now my Mum and Dad say go to bed little girl, but my heads in a whirl

I know they're watching me
I know they're watching me
I know they're hiding out there somewhere in the galaxy
They're out there in the stars
Maybe they come from Mars?
Here come the Aliens! Here come the Aliens!
They've all been waiting there living for millenniums
Maybe they'll save us from the apocalypse when it comes
A revelation that will really blow our minds!
Here come the Aliens. Here come the Aliens
Here come the Aliens!
Ahh yeah

And now there's no avoiding, our planet we're destroying
A stupid human race
They're gonna all come down, take over the world, throw us out into intergalactic space
It's too late!
So say your last goodbyes as you look to the skies
You know they tried to warn us so many times
Say goodbye to mankind

Ahh yeah

Here come the Aliens! Here come the Aliens!
Here come the Aliens! Here come the Aliens!

Oooh they're coming after me, they're coming after me
I know they're hiding out there, somewhere in the galaxy
They're out there in the stars
Maybe they come from Mars?
Here come the Aliens! Here come the Aliens!
They've all been waiting there living for millenniums
Maybe they'll save us from the apocalypse when it comes
A revelation that will really blow our minds!
Here come the Aliens
