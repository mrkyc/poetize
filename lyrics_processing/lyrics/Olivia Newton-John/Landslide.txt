Cold winds rarely blow
Here at the end of the rainbow
Guess it's hard to believe
I'd be willing to leave
Someone walked up behind me
Seemed to find me
I felt him standing there
I turned around and
Saw the face of an angel
I fell
It wasn't fair
It just wasn't fair

He took my heart
It was a landslide
You know it was a landslide
My head was saying this is the man
My heart agreed
My minor desires turned to major needs
My needs won't be denied
It was a landslide

Somehow I'm thrilled by all he says
High on his campaign of promises
I don't wanna come down
I don't wanna come down
No promise he made me
Could persuade me
Like the loneliness
That comes on when I
Try to go on without him
Doubt him
I confess
I have to confess
You might also like
He took my heart
It was a landslide
You know it was a landslide
My head was saying this is the man
My heart agreed
My minor desires turned to major needs
My needs won't be denied
It was a landslide

(I'm in heaven when he's around)
I'm in heaven
(In heaven when he's around)
Oh, this is heaven
(I'm hoping that he might be)
Hoping he might feel the same
I'm in heaven
Heaven
It isn't hard to see (Hard to see)

He took my heart
It was a landslide
You know it was a landslide
My head was saying this is the man
My heart agreed
My minor desires turned to major needs
My needs won't be denied
It was a landslide
I'm gonna tell everybody I see
He's the only party for me
It really was a
It really was a
You know it was a landslide

It was a landslide
It really was a landslide
My head was saying this is the man
My heart agreed
My minor desires turned to major needs
My needs won't be denied
It was a landslide

Ooh, it was a landslide
He took my heart
It was a landslide
Oh, it was a landslide
He took my heart
It was a landslide
