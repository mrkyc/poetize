Anybody blue?
Anybody needin' someone too?
Anyone feelin' cold?
No one there you can hold?

Don't wait to get old and gray
I'm gonna blow all the clouds away
'Cause there is nothing I would rather do

Forget about the blues tonight, sweet thing
Forget about the rules tonight, sweet thing
I wanna dance with you
Until the sun comes creepin' through
I wanna dance with you
I won't stop pleasin' you
Ah-ah-ah-ah

Honey, for awhile
Give a girl a chance to show some style
If you got no love to spare
Tell me lies, I don't care
You might also like
You better believe that I
I know some moves that we've gotta try
'Cause there is nothing I would rather do

Forget about the blues tonight, sweet thing
Forget about the rules tonight, sweet thing
I wanna dance with you
Until the sun comes creepin' through
I wanna dance with you
I won't stop pleasin' you
Ah-ah-ah-ah

Lover, I wanna let you know
I won't take a backseat
Ain't willin' to let you go
I won't take a backseat

Don't wanna hear what you want
It's gotta be all my way
And I'm makin' sure you stay to see
I'm really a selfish man
I gotta get right to it
And lover, tonight I'm thinkin' of me
Lover, I won't take a backseat tonight, ooh
Lover, gettin' on my two feet tonight, ooh
Got some dancin' to do
Got some dancin' to do
Got some dancin' to do
Got some dancin' to do

Can't let anyone get to you
I won't take a backseat
Let me show you what I can do
I won't take a backseat

It ain't funny to fool with me
I'll be a bad loser
You're gettin' me mad, using me
You tried putting a spell on me
'Cause I had a strange feelin'
You better get down to healin' me

Lover, I won't take a backseat tonight, ooh
Lover, gettin' on my two feet tonight, ooh
Got some dancin' to do
Got some dancin' to do
Got some dancin' to do
Got some dancin' to do
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Forget about the blues tonight, sweet thing (Lover, I won't take a backseat tonight, ooh)
Forget about the rules tonight, sweet thing (Lover, gettin' on my two feet tonight, ooh)
I wanna dance with you (Got some dancin' to do)
Until the sun comes creepin' through (Got some dancin' to do)
I wanna dance with you (Got some dancin' to do)
I won't stop pleasin' you (Got some dancin' to do)
Forget about the blues tonight, sweet thing (Lover, I won't take a backseat tonight, ooh)
Forget about the rules tonight, sweet thing (Lover, gettin' on my two feet tonight, ooh)
I wanna dance with you (Got some dancin' to do)
Until the sun comes creepin' through (Got some dancin' to do)
I wanna dance with you (Got some dancin' to do)
I won't stop pleasin' you (Got some dancin' to do)
