Some of us will die alone
Some of us will never reach the end of the road. It isn't enough
Some of us will never know the meaning of trust
Some of us will feed off all the people who give. It's never enough
Are we a race of animals who beg, steal and chew on the bones that are left from the people who cared?

We'll beg the kids forget your lessons
Raise up your guard, protect your honour
(Vote, fear, lies, feed, pray, debt, fear, pray.)

I'm not a war machine, I'm not a war machine
I'm not a war machine, and now you'll never have to know
I'm not a war machine, I'm not a war machine
And now you'll never know

Some of us will hold beliefs
To live, love and trust all the people we meet
You are the social elite
(You are the social elite!)
Some of us will die alone
Some of us will never know the meaning of love
Well is it enough?

We'll beg the kids forget your lessons
Raise up your guard, protect your honour

I'm not a war machine, I'm not a war machine
I'm not a war machine, and now you'll never have to know
I'm not a war machine, I'm not a war machine
And now you'll never know

I am a war machine, I am a war machine
I am a war machine and now you'll never have to know
I am a war machine, I am a war machine
I'm not a war machine, I'm not a war machine
I'm not a war machine and now you'll never have to know
I'm not a war machine, I'm not a war machine
