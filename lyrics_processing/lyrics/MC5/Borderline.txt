I'm at my borderline
I'm at my border, my borderline
Love you girl, but I just don't know why
I have to trust you so

When I make love to you
When I make love to you
Love is true, but I just don't know why
I have to trust you so

Need you girl, can't say why
Come on over here, love me now
You know, you know, you got to know
You're movin' around, pushin' me past my borderline, yeah, yeah

It's about, it's about time
It's about, it's about time
Love you girl, but I just don't know
I have to trust you so

Need you girl, can't you feel
I just got to know, if it's real
It's big and strong, hard and fine
You're movin' around, pushin' me past my borderline, yeah, yeah
You might also like
Tell me 'bout it
Ooh, ooh, oh

I'm at my borderline
I'm at my borderline
I'm at my borderline, yeah, yeah, ah
Huh, huh, ha
