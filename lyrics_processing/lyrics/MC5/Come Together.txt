I am out, you are in
Let us form a link
And move in rhythms
Slide apart and slide apart
Come together yes
Together in the darkness
Come with me

Let us dance the
The concentration dance
The dance from which all dances come
Yes, together in the darkness
Astounding, oh
Together mama, yes, yes, yes
Together mama, yes, yes, yes, yes

All the guiding rhythms of the
All the nerve that takes a lover
Nipples stiffen, nipples stiffen
Nipples stiffen mama
Let me give tongue to it, yes
Let me give tongue to it, yes
Together in the darkness, come with me
Yes, yes, yes, together mama
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, wow!

Oh God, it's getting closer
Oh, and when it gets closer
Oh God, it's so close now
God it's so close, yes, yes, yes
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes
All right build to a rising
Build to a gathering
Build to a quaking
Build to eruption
Build to a peak and
Fall gasping over
Together yes together in the darkness
Ow! Now, now, now, ow! Yow!

Yes, let's come together
Come together (Thank you, thank you)
Thank you (Thank you)
Come together, thank you
Thank you again (Thank you, thank you again)
Thank you
