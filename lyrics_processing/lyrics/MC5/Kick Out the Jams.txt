Kick out the jams, motherfuckers!
Yeah! I, I, I, I, I'm gonna
I'm gonna kick 'em out, yeah

Well, I feel pretty good, and I guess that I could
Get crazy now, baby
'Cause we all got in tune a-when my dressing room
Got hazy now, baby
I know how you want it, child, hot, quick and tight
The girls can't stand it when you're doin' it right

Let me up on the stand
And let me kick out the jam
Yes, kick out the jams
I want to kick 'em out

Yes, I'm starting to sweat and now my shirt's all wet
What a feeling
In the sound that abounds and resounds and rebounds
Off the ceiling
You gotta have it, baby, you can't do without
When you get that feeling, you gotta sock 'em out
You might also like
Put that mic in my hand
And let me kick out the jam
Yes, kick out the jams
I want to kick 'em out

Ah-ooh
Yeah, ha
Alright, baby
Alright, alright, alright, alright, come on
Alright, alright, alright, yeah
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh

So you got to give it up, you know you can't get enough
Miss McKenzie
'Cause it gets in your brain, it drives you insane
With the frenzy
The wigglin' guitars, girl, the crash of the drums
Makes you wanna keep-a-rockin' 'til morning comes

Let me be who I am
And let me kick out the jam
Yes, kick out the jams
