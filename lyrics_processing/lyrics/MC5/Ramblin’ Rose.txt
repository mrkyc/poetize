Brothers and sisters, I wanna see a sea of hands out there
Let me see a sea of hands
I want everybody to kick up some noise
I wanna hear some revolution out there, brothers
I wanna hear a little revolution
Brothers and sisters, the time has come for each and every one of you to decide
Whether you are gonna be the problem or whether you are gonna be the solution (That's right)
You must choose, brothers, you must choose
It takes five seconds, five seconds of decision
Five seconds to realize your purpose here on the planet (That's right)
It takes five seconds to realize that it's time to move
It's time to get down with it
Brothers, it's time to testify, and I want to know
Are you ready to testify? Are you ready?
I give you a testimonial: the MC5

(Hey) Love is like a ramblin' rose
The more you feed it, the more it grows

Ramblin' rose, ramblin' rose
Come on home (Ah, ah, hey)
