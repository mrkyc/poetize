Woah, Kenny

Play right, play right, god damn it (Oh)
Don't wanna hold up the night, god damn it (Ayy)
Don't wanna control ya right, god damn it
Keeping score tonight (Alright, alright)
Play right, play right, god damn it (Ayy)
Don't wanna hold up the night, god damn it (Ee-ayy)
Don't wanna control ya right, god damn it
Keeping score tonight (Ride, ride, ride, ride with you)

Mm, just wanna ride-ride with you
Shoot and I would die-die with you
Pain you gotta notice (You gotta notice)
War scars and more shit (I got some more)
You got some baggage, emotions (You need to)
Crash and control issues
Lagging and loading
Heart was too open
I put that over peace
You know I'd rather ride-die with you
But would you do it for the guy?
I'm never outta reach
You know I wanna ride-die with you
Or I'd keep that shit alive
Meanwhile, I'm racing daylight-daylight, I'm gone
Goddamn, I hit the freeway, get ghost, I'm lost
I noticed it was unlocked-unlocked, uh-huh
You might also like
They got me at the stove
They got me like, "Don't leave us"

Play right, play right, god damn it (Oh)
Don't wanna hold up the night, god damn it (Ayy)
Don't wanna control ya right, god damn it
Keeping score tonight (Alright, alright)
Play right, play right, god damn it (Ayy)
Don't wanna hold up the night, god damn it (Ee-ayy)
Don't wanna control ya right, god damn it
Keeping score tonight (Ride, ride, ride, ride with you)

And I just decided
You ain't worth my time
Can't get you off of my mind
Can't risk, little did I even know
That you move in silence
Did all your dirty in private
You over your time limit
Baby, you know that to score
You know I be dying to get right-right with you
Baby make it hard to get-get right-right with you
Overtime, can't get right
Did too much out of spite
Did too much, can't get right, get right
Ride or die, I (Ayy) really wanna slide (Ayy)
Feelin' way high on a highway, might
Pull over and try to put some points on the board
Both my hands tied, but I still keep score
Play for the same squad, never leave her
We both put up points, think I need her
Hop out all brown, she a cheetah
That dress make you pop like believer
Play right, play right, goddamn
I be here from daylight to night, I am
Tucked like the moon in the sky just waiting on my ship
Know I'm gon' score, I'm just waiting on my peace, so
Play right, play right you know
I'ma leave my heart out, heart out, on the floor
I try to get you done up-done up, uh-huh

They got me at the store
They got me like, "Don't leave her"

Play right, play right, god damn it (Oh)
Don't wanna hold up the night, god damn it (Ayy)
Don't wanna control ya right, god damn it
Keeping score tonight (Alright, alright)
Play right, play right, god damn it (Ayy)
Don't wanna hold up the night, god damn it (Ee-ayy)
Don't wanna control ya right, god damn it
