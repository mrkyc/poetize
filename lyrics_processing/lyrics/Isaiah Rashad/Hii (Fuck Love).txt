You can have all my shine, I give you my light
Loving this here is wrong but it feel nice
Ice cold in my veins, ice cold in my veins
Ice cold, you feel good, you take away from my pain
Can't remember my name, my address, I'm on a plane
50 thousand altitude's high up, well at least off in my brain
You was there for me on my lows and all of my gains
I give you this ring if I could
But I know dirt won't let me do it
Insecure, I need my noise
Been too good, we share our laughs
Gotta move on, that's in the past
This new feeling, I hope it last
Kinda like forever like Keith Sweat
Gave it to Heaven, I need my pass
Gone spark the flame, give me all that you have
Don't hold back, I can't crash
Tryna hold on, keep falling off
Right back at it, this ain't golf
Can't just swing and get back on
We just somehow lost...

I think I'm lost, why don't you give me my lighter
I think I'm lost, I need that light (drugs - are the answer)
I think I'm lost, why don't you give me my light? (drugs)
I think I'm lost

See I'm addicted to light-skinned women with nice friends
I only want to fuck, ain't trying to be with 'em
I know I couldn't change if I wanted
You staring at a leather asking, "Why it ain't denim?"
And sometime a nigga get fucked up
And sometime these bitches get fucked too
See I was raised round the clan for the misfits
And baby momma screaming out "Fuck you
Fuck you, Zay, you only love yourself
And that bald headed bitch that you been with
You only call when it's at your convenience
You either that or trying in between it"
I laugh at her then I take another sip
I bet I just look like my daddy now
Been up two days on the Addy now
With the guns out screaming "Put the Xanny down"
We all codeining, pro leaning
But I really am tryna get the chemistry right
Cause if I mix this pill when I add this drink
Rashad'll be the nigga that'll kill me tonight
So how we feeling alright, stop killing the lights
Tryna numb this pain I've been living to fight
If we drop a few songs, we'll be living the life
And the drug dealer finna make a killing tonight, so how we feeling alright
I think I'm lost, why don't you give me my lighter
I think I'm lost, I need that light
