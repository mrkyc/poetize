Sometimes I'm overwhelmed with everything I feel
'Cause I know how we break so easily
Sometimes I get so scared it all will fall away
And I need to remember just to breathe

I tried to let go of the things I can't know
It's so vulnerable, every one of us
Maybe the only thing that matters is love
Maybe love is the medicine we need

This is a prayer for the broken
For those who are afraid
This is a cry for this brave world
So beautiful and strange
It's all so temporary, so temporary
But we are not alone
So hold me like you'll never let me go

When I'm here inside the fortress of your arms
You repair all the earthquakes in my heart (Heart)
So hold me steady like the ground beneath my feet
'Cause I know just how fragile we all are
You might also like
I tried to let go like a flower in the snow
We're so vulnerable, everyone of us (Us)
Maybe the only thing eternal is love
And love is the evidence we need

This is a prayer for the broken (The broken)
For those who are afraid (Afraid, yeah)
This is a cry for this brave world
So beautiful and strange
It's all so temporary, so temporary
But we are not alone
So hold me like you'll never let me go (You will never let me go)

Until the tears crash down
Until the storm cries out (Cries out)
Let it out, oh
And all the hurt and pain
Will wash away

This is a prayer for the broken (This is a prayer)
For those who are afraid (Afraid, yeah)
This is a cry for this brave world
So beautiful and strange
It's all so temporary (Oh), so temporary (Oh)
But we are not alone (We're not alone)
