Hello listeners, this is your favorite fox chilling
On the psychological request line. Hello?

Hello, I'm Brandy and I would like to make a request out to Kevin
By Immature, "Is It Love This Time"

Okay, Brandy we'll get that out to Kevin
Immature, "Is It Love This Time"
Yo, kick it

You know what?
You a fine, young sexy lady
And I'm a fine, young fella, too
You know, we can really get close together
But you know, they always say we're too young
And I personally don't believe that
Listen right here

People say I'm not old enough
"You're too young, you cannot fall in love"
You can't understand the way I feel
Oh baby
You might also like
I hope it's yearning for you
I can't get you off my mind, my mind
If it's that love that I feel (love that I feel)
It feels so real (feels so real)
What am I supposed to do?

Tell me, is it love this time?
Tell me, is it love this time?
My favorite little girl, what I need is you
I'd do anything that you want me to
[Verse 2: Batman & Romeo
Listen
My poor heart is doing crazy things
This is due to the joy you bring
Try to understand the way, I feel girl
Little baby, little, little baby

I know, it's silly to you
And I can't get get you off my mind
No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no
And if it's that love that I feel and I know that it is real
What am I, what am I supposed to do?
Tell me, is it love this time?
Tell me, is it love this time?
My favorite little girl, what I need is you
I'd do anything that you want me to

Don't you go nowhere
Don't you ever leave me
Don't you ever leave me, ooh
