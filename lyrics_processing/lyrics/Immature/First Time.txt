See, normally a brother wouldn't talk about his first time
But I'ma just be real with y'all and say what's on my mind
I remember like yesterday, just a little man
I have no clue just quite didn't understand
I looked up to big bro for a little advice
He said, "Young boy, whatever you do, just make sure you strap twice"
I was a little bit nervous about it being my first time
But I said, "What the hell? This girl is too damn fine"

My very first time
In the house on the couch in your parents' bedroom
Remember my very first time
I can't wait 'til the day when I see you again
Remember my very first time
It was just as special (Special to me) to me as it was to (Oh ohh) you, girl
My very first time
I will never forget my first time

See it was Sunday afternoon, moms and pops were gone
We had to be on the low 'cause they were on their way home
We started kissin' then it led straight to the bed
I can't believe this is happenin' is what I'm thinkin' in my head
It lasted like a minute but it seemed like forever
We almost got caught but I'm just too damn clever
Her parents came home from church and I was out of there like a drop of a dime
Man, I will never forget my first time

This goes out to the first
Do you know who you are?
I will see you again (See you again)
And no matter how old we both get, no regrets
I will never forget (My first time)

My very first time
In the house on the couch in your parents' bedroom
Remember my very first time (I know you remember, girl)
I can't wait 'til the day when I see you again
Remember my very first time
It was just as special to me as it was to (Oh ohh) you, girl
My very first time
I will never forget my first time
See some of you might have started early and some of you started late
But I know when I started and I thought it was great
This goes out to all my little brothers in the world
Make sure your first time is with that special girl

Clap your hands if you remember (Clap your hands)
Your first time (First time), your first time (First time)
Clap your hands (Clap your hands with me)
If you remember your first time (Your first time), your first time, baby

My very first time
In the house on the couch in your parents' bedroom
Remember my very first time
I can't wait 'til the day when I see you again
Remember my very first time (My first time)
It was just as special to me as it was to you, girl
My very first time
And I will never forget my first time
My very first time
In the house (House) on the couch (Couch) in your parents' bedroom
Remember my very first time
And I can't wait 'til the day when I see you again
Remember my very first time
It was just as special to me as it was to you, girl
My very first time (My first time)
And I will never forget my first time
And I will never forget
