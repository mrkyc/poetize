This song is dedicated to my mother
Who I really love a lot
And who I lost
This will always be my heart
Forever
I love you

I'm all alone (All alone)
In this whole world
With no one by my side (This whole world)
But you (By my side)
Now you're gone (Now you're gone)
And I'm all alone (I'm all alone)
Alone
In this whole world
With no one by my side
But you
Now you're gone
And I'm all alone

Everyday, I hope and pray
You'll come back in my life
You were my friend, my confidant
I treasure every moment with you
What am I supposed to do
My mother and my friend
Until the end
I never will forget
You might also like
I'm all alone (I'm All alone)
In this whole world (In this world)
With no one by my side
But you
Now you're gone (Now you're gone)
And I'm all alone (I'm all alone)
Alone (I'm all alone)
In this whole world
With no one by my side (With no one, with no one)
On my side
Now you're gone (Now you're gone)
And I'm all alone

The smile you gave
The way we played
You gave me all my strength
When I think about life
I know you'll always lead my path
A part of you is still in me
Which means we're always together
Forever
You'll always be
You'll always be
A part of me
I'm all alone
In this whole world (In this world)
With no one by my side
With no one by my side
Now you're gone
And I'm all alone (I'm all alone)
Alone
In this whole world (In this world)
With no one by my side (With no one by my side but you)
Now you're gone (Now that you're gone I don't know what to do)
And I'm all alone

You gave me your love
I treasured your love
I miss you
I gave you my love (I gave you my love)
Oh, oh, oh
I know that you love me
I know you will protect me
I love you so much
I don't want to be alone

I'm all alone (I'm all alone)
In this whole world
With no one by my side (I miss you mama)
Now you're gone (And I'll hold you by with me)
And I'm all alone
Alone (I'll remember, I'll remember when we used to play)
In this whole world
With no one by my side
Now you're gone (Don't want to think about it)
And I'm all alone (I just give some broken heartache)
Alone
In this whole world (Oh, I don't know what to do, oh, yeah)
With no one by my side
Now you're gone (I miss you)
And I'm all alone (I'm all alone)
Alone
In this whole world (In this world me)
With no one by my side (I know you loved me)
Now you're gone (I know you're watching me)
And I'm all alone
Alone (I just want to tell you one in this)
In this whole world
With no one by my side (That I love you)
But you
Now you're gone
