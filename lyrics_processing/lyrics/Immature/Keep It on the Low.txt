Hey now ladies guess who's back
LDB, Romeo, and Bat
For the 99, it's phat stack
Yo Ra-Ra bout to rip the track
You took my heart and ran with it
Why you so damn scandalous?
I found a chick who could handle this
Bye-bye love cause I'm through with this

Oh my god, what'd I do?
I'm caught up in your bed with you
My best friend's girl, what a shame
Why did you play these silly games?
Try to put the blame on me
I always knew you were a freak
I seen you looking right away
Girl you've got a bomb body

I should've seen it coming when you stepped to me
You're like my sis never thought it would be
But there was something that you did when you looked at me
That made me wanna get a little bit freaky
Then I started thinking about my boy and said
"What would he do if he knew
His homie was creeping with you?"
You might also like
Keep it on the low
We never should've did it
Yo girl, my best friend
He can never know
Get up and get your stuff girl, you must go
Keep it on the low
We never should've did it yo girl, my best friend
He can never know, oh, oh, oh

Oh no can't talk to you
Take it to the source what I can not do
Gotta stop now, cause every night
All of this stuff ain't worth the fight
My homie comes first that's how it goes
Can't keep dealing with you silly hoes
Buying your stuff and playing the role
Baby I don't need you, no, no

I should've seen it coming when you stepped to me
You're like my sis never thought it would be
But there was something that you did when you looked at me
That made me wanna get a little bit freaky
Then I started thinking about my boy and said
"What would he do if he knew
His homie was creeping with you?"
Keep it on the low
We never should've did it
Yo girl, my best friend
He can never know
Get up and get your stuff girl, you must go
Keep it on the low
We never should've did it yo girl, my best friend
He can never know, oh, oh, oh

Isn't that your curiosity
Doesn't mean a thing to me
As I reach for the sky
There's no need for me to lie
Cause my love for him is strong
I must hold on

Immature come on dance with me
Romeo, Batman, LDB
Everybody come on dance with me
Yeah, come on, come on, dance with me
Can't forget Chris b-z
Everybody in the house dance with me
Everybody in the house dance with me
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Keep it on the low
We never should've did it
Yo girl, my best friend
He can never know
Get up and get your stuff girl, you must go
Keep it on the low
We never should've did it yo girl, my best friend
He can never know, oh, oh, oh
