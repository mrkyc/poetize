Yo, y'all like that?
Dang, baby's fine
And I can think of a hundred ways
'Cause we on our worst behavior
You got that right
Whoo! Dang, baby got the works

Baby psychological
Man, let me hmm hmm hmm
I wish it could tell my sign
Yo, Immature, kick it to her
Ooh

I see you there across the room that brings joy into my heart
To say, we're together, yeah
All the ugly little faces around really don't stand a chance
With your lovely ways in the air, they don't compare
I know we fussing tonight
But I'd do anything, to keep you by my side
You mean everything to me, yeah
It's hard to pull you away, but I must tell you right now
About the joy and love you bring, hey yeah

So I could tell you how I feel
Can you meet me outside, can you meet me outside
Meet me outside, ooh, oh oh
Oooh

All the things you do
Strike me as a cute little habit that you really shouldn't lose
'Cause you drive me crazy girl, yeah
Now some things you do
Really rub in the wrong, wrong way, I get excused
But I still love you with all my heart

Can you meet me outside, can you meet me outside
Meet me outside, ooh oh, oh

Can you meet me outside, can you meet me outside
Meet me outside, ooh oh, oh

Let's go talk to her
Hey y'all, let's go wait for her over by the fire escape
She's definitely worth waiting for
I could sing the whole song to her and she better be waiting out there for us
Hey look, she got some homies
One for you, you, and you...
I wanna say (hey, where'd they go?)
Na na na, na-na na-na (oh, man)
Na na na, na-na na-na (they left, man)
Na na na, na-na na-na (let's go)

Na, na, na, na, na (Peace, man)

Can you meet me outside, can you meet me outside
Meet me outside, ooh oh, oh
