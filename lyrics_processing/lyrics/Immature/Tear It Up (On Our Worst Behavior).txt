Yeah, this is Romeo
And Immature's 'bout to drop that new jack funk on you
You livin' large, deuce
This psychological trio
Always on our worst behavior
Yo, what up, Half Pint?
Yo Batman, kick it

People look out, we're coming at you
Immature's gonna turn it out (Turn it out)
Doin' what we won't do
Takin' no shorts, and breakin' all the rules

Don't be frontin' on us
'Cause we ain't having it, we're just having fun
Distrupting all of
'Cause a kid that rocks the cradle
Is a kid that rules the world

Tear it up, you never gon' tear it up (Yeah)
Tear it up, you never gon' tear it up (Come on)
Tear it up, you never gon' tear it up
Tear it up, you never gon' tear it up (Everybody say tear it up)
Tear it up, you never gon' tear it up (Yeah)
Tear it up, you never gon' tear it up (Come on)
Tear it up, you never gon' tear it up
Tear it up, you never gon' tear it up
(Yo, Batman, drop the second verse)

People always peeping our sound
'Cause we're nine years old and wiser than our years
We always do what people don't expect
But after Marq, we don't regret

Don't be frontin' on us
'Cause we ain't having it, we're just having fun
Distrupting all of
'Cause a kid that rocks the cradle
Is a kid that rules the world

Tear it up, you never gon' tear it up (Yeah)
Tear it up, you never gon' tear it up (Yeah)
Tear it up, you never gon' tear it up (Yeah, this is Romeo)
Tear it up, you never gon' tear it up
(And we still rockin' that funky immature stuff)
Tear it up, you never gon' tear it up
(In the house, we got Jermaine from the Kris Kross posse)
Tear it up, you never gon' tear it up
(To show you how deep we rolling)
Tear it up, you never gon' tear it up
Tear it up, you never gon' tear it up
(Jermaine, break them off something)
Rip it up, tear it up, no, it doesn't matter what is
'Cause these kids, a little bad bunch
Here they come like a bomb, hope you lay low
'Cause the tre from L.A. ain't no joke
Marq, the Don, don't forget Jerome
Three bad brothers got it going on, huh
Here's the flavor, nothin' can save you
When they on their worst behavior

(Come on)
Can't nobody, can't nobody play this, Immature
Can't nobody, can't nobody
Can't nobody play this

Tear it up, you never gon' tear it up
Tear it up, you never gon' tear it up
Tear it up, you never gon' tear it up
Tear it up, you never gon' tear it up
Tear it up, you never gon' tear it up
Tear it up, you never gon' tear it up
Tear it up, you never gon' tear it up
Tear it up, you never gon' tear it up
