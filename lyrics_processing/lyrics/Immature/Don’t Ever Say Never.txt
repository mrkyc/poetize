My heart is for you, oh baby
Just don't ever say never
Don't ever say never
Although, it may seem
That you're livin' in a fairy tale
You can't give up on your dreams
I can see
All the things you think you can be
Don't ever say never
Just don't ever say never, da da
You can have it all
But you cannot be denied
Don't ever say never, da da
You can reach the sky
Just don't let it pass you by
Don't ever say never, here's why
You'll never know until you try
Sometimes, you may feel
That your hopes and your dreams
You cannot achieve (Just believe)
Just believe (What you see)
What you see
You can reach me I'll want any one piece
Don't ever say never
Just don't ever say never, da da
You can have it all
But you cannot be denied
Don't ever say never, da da
You can reach the sky
Just don't let it pass you by
Don't ever say never, here's why
You'll never know until you try
Give it all you can, one time, you gotta try
I'm tellin' you now, you won't be denied
I know it may be hard
But you will survive
As long as you stay true
To what you feel inside
Just don't ever say never, da da
You can have it all
But you cannot be denied
Don't ever say never, da da
You can reach the sky
Just don't let it pass you by
Don't ever say never, here's why
You'll never know until you try
Give it all you can, one time, you gotta try
I'm tellin' you now, you won't be denied
I know it may be hard
But you will survive
As long as you stay true
To what you feel inside
Give it all you can, one time, you gotta try
I'm tellin' you now, you won't be denied
I know it may be hard
But you will survive
As long as you stay true
To what you feel inside
Give it all you can, one time, you gotta try
I'm tellin' you now, you won't be denied
I know it may be hard
But you will survive
As long as you stay true
To what you feel inside
Give it all you can, one time, you gotta try
I'm tellin' you now, you won't be denied
I know it may be hard
But you will survive
As long as you stay true
