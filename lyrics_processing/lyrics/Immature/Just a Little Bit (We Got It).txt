Just a little bit of love and I'm ready
So come on, so come on
Just a little bit of love and I'm ready
So come on, so come on

I know that I'm ready to fall in love
And spend a little time with you (with you)
It's alright to let me know (let me know)
What you want to do
Never mind me
Just thinking about the way we could be
Oh yeah (oh yeah)
Your a fly freak, how deep (how deep)
Is your love

Just a little bit of love and I'm ready
So come on, so come on
Just a little bit of love and I'm ready
So come on, so come on

You bring me joy
You put a smile on my face (smile on me face)
Never gonna let you go, no, no
Sing to you, I wanna make you feel good (make you feel good)
Feel me flow (flow)
Without you, I'd rather be alone
Whatever you need (you need)
I'll be there to please
You might also like
Just a little bit of love and I'm ready
So come on, so come on
Just a little bit of love and I'm ready
So come on, so come on

Romeo flow
Honey love, I think about you daily
You know you are my baby, you know you drive me crazy
On my mind, everyday, the things I do for you
Only becuase you're my boo
Oooh yea
Uh yeah-ya
Oooh yea
Immature laid back
Just a little bit of love and I'm ready
Just a little bit of love
So come on
And you know I'm ready, girl
So come on

Just a little bit of love and I'm ready
So come on, so come on
Just a little bit of love and I'm ready
