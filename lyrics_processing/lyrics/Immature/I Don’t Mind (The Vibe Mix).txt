Anything you want, my baby
Don't you know you drive me crazy
So fine, you're so fine
I don't mind
Girl, I'll walk you home from school
Be your undercover fool
So fine, you're so fine
I don't mind

You can have anything
You took my heart and plus a ring
I just wanna see you smile
I think about you all the time
One kiss'll blow my mind
Baby, you're so damn fine

I don't mind
What your friends say about me, girl
I don't mind
You can do anything you wanna do
I don't mind
My girl, my girl
You're so incredible
I don't care, baby
You can do it
You might also like
Anything you want, my baby
Don't you know you drive me crazy
So fine, you're so fine
I don't mind
Girl, I'll walk you home from school
Be your undercover fool
So fine, you're so fine
I don't mind

People wonder why I
Do the things that I
Things that I do for you
They don't know, baby, I
Really like the way
The way that you make me feel, that's why

I don't mind
If you're on the phone at night
I don't mind
Soon I'll be holding you real tight, real tight
I don't mind
My girl, my girl
You're so incredible
I don't care, baby
You can do it
Anything you want, my baby
Don't you know you drive me crazy
So fine, you're so fine
I don't mind
Girl, I'll walk you home from school
Be your undercover fool
So fine, you're so fine
I don't mind

Come on, baby
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Girl, I'll walk you home from school
Be your undercover fool
So fine, you're so fine (so fine)
I don't mind
Anything you want, my baby (I don't mind)
I don't mind
Anything you want, my baby
I don't mind
Anything you want, my baby
