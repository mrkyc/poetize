You know there's something bout a sexy song (that really)
Turns me on (and makes me)
Feel at home (and a)
A melody always sound so sweet (as it)
Slowly calls (your body) next to me (and a)
A beautiful smooth conversation (just to)
Show my love (and it)
Expresses us how
I wonder how everything would be
If you spend the rest (of your)life with me

Beautiful you are
You mean the world to me more than anything
Girl my life depends
On your warm embrace just to feel the taste
Beautiful you are
You mean the world to me more than anything
Girl my life depends
On your warm embrace just to feel the taste

Baby I promise the whole world to you (any)
Thing you want (baby)
I will do and
And just to prove to you that I can be (all your)
Lookin' for (trust and)
Honesty
Its just the simple things that you do (so just)
Hold my hand (let me)
Sing to you babe
A way to say babe that I thank you (for being)
Who you are (brighter)
Then a star
You might also like
Beautiful you are
You mean the world to me more than anything
Girl my life depends
On your warm embrace, is to feel the taste
Beautiful you are
You mean the world to me more than anything
Girl my life depends
On your warm embrace is to feel the taste

Your love
Is the sweetest thing I ever know
Your tim
Brings a warmth to my heart
My heart it all starts with you
It feels like heaven
Cause all that I am
Is all that I give

Beautiful you are
You mean the world to me more than anything
Girl my life depends
On your warm embrace, is to feel the taste
Beautiful you are
You mean the world to me more than anything
Girl my life depends
