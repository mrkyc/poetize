Rome got all the mamis, check it
Spend thirty G's on clothes, not sweatin' it
Yo wait, you see the SL 500
Trip, I gotta answer my flip
Let's see, what my next move will be
I gotta make a grip, for all da honeys
For all da honeys, for all da honeys
Haha, haha

The summer breeze
You're holding my hand

Memories, reminding me of you
And all the things you do
Has got me hooked on lovin' you

My heart belongs to you only
Try to try
In love one one time

Collectin' all the cash in the suitcase, mmm
