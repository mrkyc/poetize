Yeah-yeah, the word is out
Kool Moe Dee's in the house again
And here we go again
And word has it, the brother's esoteric knowledge
Is a little too deep for the fans
So we gon' come, this time, with a simplified rhyme
Check it out

Around and around and around we go
People comin' to the jam to hear me flow
The live lyricist is hearin' this so
I got a funky beat to let you know
Only real brothers wanna hear real rhymes
All the soft suckers want the nickel-and-dime
Candy-coated, sugar-coated bubblegum rap
'Long as it's movin' on a funky track
My vocabulary's over their head
They can't understand a word I said
So I gotta come with the watered-down sound
With mediocre adjectives, verbs and nouns
Party people in the party only wanna dance
It's hard to rock a party when you're lyrically advanced
I toned down the lyrics, suppressed ego
Got a funky rhythm, now watch me go
You might also like
Go with the flow? No-no-no
I am the brother that sets tempo
Intelligent, relevant, eloquent speakin'
You do the dancin', I'll do the freakin'
Some people wanna dance, some people wanna listen
Some people at the party only wanna hear the dissin'
My versatile styles, I'm able to adapt
You know I'm talkin' **** 'cause I'm all'at
I drop science for the brothers on the street
Intellects get it, and others want the beat
The way they feel, I could be erased
All they want is you to pump that bass
Rather than tryin' to change the times
They would rather me change my rhymes
A positive brother? Yeah-yeah, we know
But they would rather just watch me go

I am a brother, young, gifted and black
There's no need for the profane rap
I'm lyrically potent, very well-versed
Some rappers can't rap and try to hide it with a curse
Money in the pocket, gold around the neck
Rings on every finger, boomin' system in effect
Tryin' to imitate, or better, emulate
I can relate, but I'd rather innovate
Like the creator, I love to create
Peace and love, conquerin' hate
I gotta deal with fate
To be known as the great
So all you sissy-soft suckers can wait
Become irate while the ladies gyrate
Infatuate, lust and mate
Mental states, compensate
If I get too deep, then you won't relate
So now I gotta tone down the sound
'Cause I can pick the beat up and turn it around
Turn any jam to a political party
Raise your conscience and rock your body
If you can't relate just clap your hands
Listen to the rhythm and do your dance
And I'll just party with a alter ego
Rock-the-body-body-body-body, here we go
Yeah, so here we go again
On, and on, and on
Kool Moe Dee, 1991
