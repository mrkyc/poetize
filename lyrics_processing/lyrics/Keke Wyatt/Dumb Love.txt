Like a broken record that always skips
But it's still your favorite
It's like that good love we shared
That seems to try and fall apart
We can fuss and fight all day
But at night I gotta feel you naked
I swear I don't understand
Why love has gotta be so damn hard
There ain't no way I will give up

I'm gonna keep giving
Giving my heart
Only to you, babe
Even though, even though we both know

Love don't make no sense
When you're in doubt
Love don't make no sense
We gotta make it better
We fight and we cry, and we cry
Then we try and we try and we try
Just wanna stay together

Dumb love, dumb love, dumb love

Like a broken heart that skips a beat
When you think it's over
I can feel the love running through my veins
Pumping through the pain
When I tell you leave
That don't mean to go
I wanna feel you closer
I know you understand what I'm saying
Why you gotta be a man?

I'm gonna keep giving
Giving my heart
Only to you, babe
Even though, even though we both know

Love don't make no sense
When you're in doubt
Love don't make no sense
We gotta make it better
We fight and we cry, and we cry
Then we try and we try and we try
Just wanna stay together
Dumb love (dumb love)
Dumb love (dumb love)
Dumb love (dumb love)
Dumb love (dumb love)
Dumb love (dumb love)
Dumb love (dumb love)

Love don't make no sense
When you're in doubt
Love don't make no sense
We gotta make it better
We fight and we cry, and we cry
Then we try and we try and we try
Just wanna stay together
Dumb love, dumb love, dumb love
Dumb love (dumb love)
Dumb love (dumb love)
