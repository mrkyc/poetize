No no no no no
I won't do it again
No no no no no
I won't do it again
And watch you try to do it all by yourself
I'm sorry baby but I'm here to help
(and I most admit)
That I'm the one who's being charged
(and I most admit)
That its me that did you wrong
I did you bad but I've learned
I hope you hear my words
I gotta make it right with you
So give me a chance
I'm not the same woman
I learned my lesson
I promise I won't do it again
No no no no
I swear I'll be with love again
I'm start speaking when you come through the door
I ain't gonna be trippin' with that attitude no more
Give me a chance
No no I won't do it again
No no no no no

I had a chance to analyze
And realize my wrongs
Now I got to apologize
Wasn't all that at a lot things
Just simply my fault (ow)
(and so) so now I'm taking all the blame
With out you here in my life
Things just ain't the same
I know I took you for granted
Now I'm alone and I just can't stand it
So give me a chance
I'm not the same woman
I learned my lesson
I promise I won't do it again
No no no no
I swear I'll be with love again
I'ma start speaking when you come through the door
I ain't gonna be trippin' with that attitude no more
Give me a chance

No no no no no no
Ow I want to make it up to you (to you)
And I'm willing to do what it is I gotta do (gotta do)
No more this attitude
