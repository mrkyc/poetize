(Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah) Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah) Yeah
(Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah) Baby

I was a fool for taking it out on you
There's nothing I wouldn't do to make it up to you
One conversation, baby, that's all I ask
We can work this thing out, it really ain't all that bad

See, I was wrong for what I did
All those nasty things I said
I was trying to pay you back for making me so mad
So if my soul my heart I beat
Will you help me on my feet?
And I promise you I'll never fall again

I don't wanna live without you
I don't wanna be without you
(Be without you, baby)
I got nothing to give without you
'Cause I don't wanna breathe without you
I don't wanna love without you
I think I'm giving up without you
(Giving up without you, baby)
I know I can't go another day, without you
You might also like
I stay locked in my room, I don't hang out no more
I keep hoping it's you that's knocking on my door
I'm not sleeping too well I've not had a meal in days
See baby, I need your help, what is it gonna take?

I would give my soul my breath (My breath)
If you just lend me an ear (An ear)
So that I can tell you all the things you need to hear
And I swear to tell the truth 'cause I never lie to you
Let's get back to making love like lovers do, yeah
Yeah yeah

I don't wanna live without you (Without you)
I don't wanna be without you (Without you)
I got nothing to give without you (Give without you)
'Cause I don't wanna breathe without you
I don't wanna cry without you
I think I'm gonna die without you
(I think I'm gonna die)
I know I can't go another day

Loneliness is what I'll forever breathe
Only if you decide to rescue me
Show me the way to get back to your heart
And I'll travel down that road no matter how far
Wherever you are
I don't wanna live without you
I don't wanna be without you
I've got nothing to give without you
'Cause I don't wanna breathe without you
I don't wanna love without you
I think I'm giving up without you
I know I can't go another day
I don't wanna live without you
I don't wanna be without you
I've got nothing to give without you
'Cause I don't wanna breathe without you

I don't wanna live
I don't wanna live
I don't wanna live without you
I don't wanna be without you
I don't wanna live without you
I don't wanna be without you
I've got nothing to give without you
