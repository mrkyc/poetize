Just picture I met you at baggage claim
I can't believe that you're leaving me again
Just when it started to sink in that you're really here with me
Time to go back to long distance, yeah

And the clock doesn't move, waking up doesn't help me much
Why am I so out of touch?
Why can't you stay? Extend your trip just one more day
I know it's messed up for me to say

Hope that a storm keeps you here, let it rain
That for some reason you're late to your gate
Baby, I hope you miss your plane
Pray that there's traffic when you're on your way
Every green light on the street turns to red
Baby, I hope you miss your plane

Your suitcase is packed and all ready to go
I'll use my body like a barricade
Just to keep you from going, we'll start to make love
And give you a good reason to be late
You might also like
And the clock doesn't move, waking up doesn't help me much
Why am I so out of touch?
Why can't you stay? Extend your trip just one more day
I know it's messed up for me to say

Hope that a storm keeps you here, let it rain
That for some reason you're late to your gate
Baby, I hope you miss your plane
Hope that the pilot don't show up today
That for some reason all flights are delayed
Baby, I hope you miss your plane

I would never wish you bad luck, baby
But I hope everything goes wrong today
Road block and car trouble get you back here on the double
Please take the long way
Why can't you manage to be free
So you could be here with me
It's too much for me to see you leave
And at the end of the day I just want you to stay

Hope that the pilot don't show up today
That for some reason all flights are delayed
Baby, I hope you miss your plane
Hope that a storm keeps you here, let it rain
That for some reason you're late to your gate
