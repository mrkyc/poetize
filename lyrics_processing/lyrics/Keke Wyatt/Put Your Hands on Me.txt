(Listen, baby)
(Listen, baby)
You better learn, you better learn
Learn, learn, learn
(Listen, baby)
You better learn, you better learn
Learn, learn, learn
(Listen, baby)

When his ex-girlfriend tried to tell ya
You told her not to mettle in yours
You should've (listen, baby)
And when he tells ya that he lost his temper
Next thing you knew he hit her
You need to (listen, baby)
And you all up in his face with your finger
Small voice tells you danger
You better (listen baby)

Temper flare, you scared
Baby's crying, bills piling everywhere
(Listen, baby)
It's about to get ugly up in there
You better pack your bag
If you ain't tryna be his punching bag
(Listen, baby)
You might also like
When drama starts to hit the fan
Raise your voice but not your hand
And you can say the most hurtful things you can
Oh baby, you can yell, scream, blowing off steam
Don't put your hands on me

You bring me flowers and a diamond necklace
Apology unaccepted
You couldn't (listen, baby)
And I'm tired of giving sad excuses
Explaining bumps and bruises
I never (listen, baby)
Breaking out on you without a warning
First thing tomorrow morning
You should (listen, baby)

Temper flare, don't get scared
Police sirens, dishes flying everywhere
(Listen, baby)
It's about to get ugly in here
The fighting's gotta end
Bet you never put your hands on me again
When drama starts to hit the fan
Raise your voice but not your hand
And you can say the most hurtful things you can
(Most nasty, filthy things that come out your mouth)
Oh baby, you can yell, scream, blowing off steam
Don't put your hands on me

Put your hands on me
When you wanna feel something soft
Put your hands on me
When some loving's about to get jumped off
But don't put your hands on me
When you're pissed off
And your job laid off
You can yell, scream, blowing off steam
Don't put your hands on me
You honor, your honor
Please understand
The victim of an abusive relationship
And I really love that man without a doubt
But before I knew what happened I had blacked out
Got the cops knocking, neighbors watching
Got me looking crazy
Back of a squat car
Ain't that kind of lady
Oh no, not me, no
That is not the way it's suppose to be
When drama starts to hit the fan (Oh no, baby)
Raise your voice but not your hand
And you can say the most hurtful things you can
Oh baby, you can yell, scream, blowing off steam
Don't put your hands on me

Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, no
(Listen, baby)
No no no no no
Oh oh
(Listen, baby)
No no no no
Oh oh
(Listen, baby)
No no no no
(Listen, baby)
