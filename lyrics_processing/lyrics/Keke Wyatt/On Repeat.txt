On, baby, on
On, baby, on
On, baby, on
On, baby, on

I love when you pull up
In your black truck
Baby, I've been wating on you
Pictures ain't enough
Your loving got me stuck
We're ready and I gotta feel you
I want another taste
And then another taste
Soon as we hit the door
Lay me down, babe
I need your loving bad
I'm trying to feel it, baby
It's so bad
I know we're about to kill it, kill it

On, on, on, on
I know you feel it
On, on, on, on
We're gonna kill it
You might also like
Last night is on repeat
And it's playing in my head
Like a broken video
What you do to me
I can still feel our love
Beating through the stereo
Not a minute wasted with you
In my mind 'cause...
Last night is on repeat, repeat
Night is on repeat

So we're gonna leave it on
Baby, baby, on, baby, baby
I can turn it off
Baby, baby, no, baby, baby
I can keep it on
Baby, baby, on, baby, baby
I can turn it off
Baby, baby, off, baby, baby

Remember when we started in the bed
We took it downstairs
And we ain't really care
We could get it anywhere
Ended up on the couter
For about an hour
And hit the shower
Then we start all over again

On, on, on, on
I know you feel it
On, on, on, on
We're gonna kill it

Last night is on repeat
And it's playing in my head
Like a broken video
What you do to me
I can still feel our love
Beating through the stereo
Not a minute wasted with you
In my mind 'cause...
Last night is on repeat, repeat
Night is on repeat

On, baby, on
On, baby, on
On, baby, on
On, baby, on
Last night is on repeat
And it's playing in my head
Like a broken video
What you do to me
I can still feel our love
Beating through the stereo
Not a minute wasted with you
In my mind 'cause...
Last night is on repeat, repeat
Night is on repeat

So we're gonna leave it on
Baby, baby, on, baby, baby
I can turn it off
Baby, baby, no, baby, baby
I can keep it on
Baby, baby, on, baby, baby
I can turn it off
