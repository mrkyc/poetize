Last night when I was all alone
Cleaning my closet out
I found an envelope, a letter that you wrote
Before the chemistry faded out
It stopped me in my tracks, I caught a flashback
Now I'm feeling all nostalgic
With every word I read, the memories skips
Couldn't be no way around it

Now I miss you in my life, oh baby
But it's painful to see you now
But I know some day, some how
That we are gonna reunite, oh baby
Don't ask me when
But I know that I'll see you again
Right now

We'll only hurt each other, baby
So find another lover, baby
But I believe that you and I
We're gonna meet in another lifetime, yeah yeah
Right now you're not the one
But don't let that break you up
'Cause I believe that you and I
We're gonna meet in another lifetime
Hey yeah, hey yeah, hey yeah
We're gonna meet in another lifetime
You might also like
I can't pretend that I don't
Wonder where you sleep at night
I can't stand that deep inside I know
That you'll leave some other love you find
But you deserve true love with someone
Even if the love ain't with me
I need to let you go, release control
Even though I know that'll kill me, oh oh

We'll only hurt each other, baby
So find another lover, baby
But I believe that you and I
We're gonna meet in another lifetime, yeah yeah
Right now you're not the one
But don't let that break you up
'Cause I believe that you and I
We're gonna meet in another lifetime
Hey yeah, hey yeah, hey yeah
We're gonna meet in another lifetime

Now I miss you in my life, oh baby
But it's too painful to see you now
But I know some day, some how
That we are gonna reunite, oh baby
Don't ask me when
But I know that I'll see you again
We'll only hurt each other, baby
So find another lover, baby
But I believe that you and I
We're gonna meet in another lifetime, yeah yeah
Right now you're not the one
But don't let that break you up
(Don't let that break you up)
'Cause I believe that you and I
We're gonna meet in another lifetime
Hey yeah, hey yeah, hey yeah
