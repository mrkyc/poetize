Never give up
Never give up
A strange feeling coming over me and I just can't lie
I can't control myself
Thinking about you babe all day and night and no one else
All the love that you give to me it keeps me high
And I don't wanna come down
Take me higher babe
Cause I'll never give up on this love I found
Never give up on the way you love me
Never give up on the things you've showed me
Never give up on this love I've waited all my life
Never give up on the joy you bring
Never give up baby please pick me
Never give up on this love I've waited all my life
Loving the way that you take your time
When you're touching me
Makes my love come down like the river flows
Constantly
And did you know
If you ever go away what would I do?
So while you're here let me make it clear
I don't ever wanna be without you no

Never give up on the way you love me
Never give up on the things you've showed me
Never give up on this love I've waited all my life
Never give up on the joy you bring
Never give up baby please pick me
Never give up on this love I've waited all my life
As long as the grass grows and water flows
I'll be right here
And when the leaves fall off the trees baby
I'll still be here
You're the only one for me and it's something I realize
Oh yeah
That living life without you
I wouldn't survive
Never give up on the way you love me
Never give up on the things you've showed me

I love the way you love me
I love the way you hold me
