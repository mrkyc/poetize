Going to the salon, I've gotta get my hair done
Pedicure, manicure, everything I need and more
It's going down today, I can't wait to celebrate
Drive to the car wash, after that I'll drop my top
I can't wait, it's going down tonight
Time to play, everything's gonna be alright
Got my girls on the phone, I've been waitin' for so long
It's a party going on tonight
Time for a shopping spree, spending money just for me
I don't need a man's pay, I can make my own way
Credit Card, bank account,  allowed
Thank God, it's Friday, doin' things my own way
I bought pink dress, I got my Fendi shoes
Gotta get my Prada bag, scent from the S-ca jag
Then turn me to Bally's, it get the facts away
Then get on my 2-way, my girls reply and say
I can't wait, it's going down tonight
Time to play, everything's gonna be alright
Got my girls on the phone, I've been waitin' for so long
It's a party going on tonight
I can't wait, it's going down tonight
Time to play, everything's gonna be alright
Got my girls on the phone, I've been waitin' for so long
It's a party going on tonight
Say, it's a party, a party, party, party
Party, party, party, a party, party, party
A party, party, party, a party, party, party
I can't wait, it's going down tonight
Time to play, everything's gonna be alright
Got my girls on the phone, I've been waitin' for so long
It's a party going on tonight
I can't wait, it's going down tonight
Time to play, everything's gonna be alright
Got my girls on the phone, I've been waitin' for so long
It's a party going on tonight
Party, party, party, a party, party, party
A party, party, party, a party, party, party
Party, party, party, a party, party, party
A party, party, party, a party, party, party
Say, it's a party, a party, party, party
Party, party, party, a party, party, party
A party, party, party, a party, party, party
Dance right now, dance right now
