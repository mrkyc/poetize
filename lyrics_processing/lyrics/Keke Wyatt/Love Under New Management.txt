Experience is a good teacher
It takes someone like me to know
All the little games that people tend to play
Some call it love
It never has a chance to grow

You deserve something better I keep telling myself
Just be patient, true love you'll find
I finally found someone who became my friend
And in a matter of time, real love stepped in
The 'Closed' sign on my door, I had to tear it down
A new world of happiness turned me completely around

I'm in love under new management
(I'm in love under new management)
I'm in love under new management
Someone very special came into my life
And no one can take his place
(Take my baby's place)
He filled my empty space

There's nothing like someone
Who can take care of business
You know we treat each other so well
And back together came all the little pieces
It's time to celebrate
You see, I never thought I could
You might also like
The 'Closed' sign outside my door, I had to tear it down
A new world of happiness turned me completely around

I'm in love under new management
(I'm in love under new management)
I'm in love under new management
Someone very special came into my life
Can't take his place (Can't take his place)
He filled my empty space
I'm in love under new management
(Under new, woo hoo)
I'm in love under new management
(In love, in love, in love under new)
I'm in love under new, doo doo doo

Ladies, if you know what I'm talking 'bout
Tell me, can your man put it down?
I feel my man all over my body
My baby makes my body go crazy, ooh
Turned me completely around
I'm in love under new management
I'm in love under new management
(Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)
Someone very special came into my life
(Said I love him, said I need him)
Someone very special came into my life
(Said I love him, and I need him)
Someone very special came into my life
