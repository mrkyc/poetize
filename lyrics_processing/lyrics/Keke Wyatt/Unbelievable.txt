Feels like I make believe it
Sometimes I think I'm dreaming
Then I pinch myself
You're like a unicorn in my backyard just running 'round
Or at the end of a rainbow, pot of gold that I have found
Like talking animals
My jaw just hit the floor
You're unbelievable
You're unbelievable
You're unbelievable
You're unbelievable
Come see what I've found second time around
Love so indescribable I can't talk about
Makes me wanna sing, tears come to my eyes
Can this really be for real? I think love's arrived
And I've never seen before
It's like he's from another world
I was a woman scorned until he came into my world
Little things that I can't see, true love's amazing
You're like a unicorn in my backyard just running 'round
Or at the end of a rainbow, pot of gold that I have found
Like talking animals
My jaw just hit the floor

Good things go around, good things come around
Out there in the universe smiles take over frowns
He's the perfect one, he's the moon and sun
Never thought I'd find him, ain't nobody like him
And I never seen before
It's like he's from another world
I was a woman scorned until he came into my world
Little things that I can't see, true love's amazing

Or at the end of a rainbow, pot of gold that I have found
