The love I see can't be denied
Oh baby, you are so fine
I am glad to know that you are mine, yeah
You make me feel like flower
I need a shower, so baby, rain on me
Every minute, every hour
Never knew that love can make my world so complete
Ever since you came my way
I've never seen a brighter day
When I see your face
All I can see is you
You're like the sun in the middle of day
You light me up, you light me up, babe
Every moment's like summer, you're my everything
You light me up, you light me up, babe
You light me up, you light my, light me up
You light me up, you light my, light me up
Sugar, your lips so sweet
Like morning dew is to the spring, yeah
And baby, what you do to me
You got my skin craving your heat, hey
