I'm sure that you heard the rumors 'bout me
Word on the street is I'm that B
But you didn't care nothin' 'bout that
Said I was the one you had to have
Knowin' that I wasn't into no games
Wasn't tryin' to take nobody's last name
But you changed my mind
Took me off the grind, now I'm yours for life
What if I never met you?
What would it take to get you?
This thing that you do
That can't nobody else do
What if you was still on the block?
Will this love we got make you stop?
I don't wanna ever think about
Can't do without it
Who knew
It would be you changin' my plans
Stealin' my heart?
Who knew
You were the one just like me?
Snatch a sista up and wifed me
You might also likeWho knew that you would be my baby daddy
Spendin' all your hard-earned money on me?
You came out the blue, boy, I'm glad it's you
Tell me, who knew?
Ain't nobody gonna take me
'Cause you're the only one that ever shown me
'Bout what it's like to know real love
What it's like to get that good love
Gettin' turned on and gettin' turned out
Doin' it so good that there's no doubt
There ain't never gonna be a time
When I'm not his and he ain't mine
What if I never met you?
What would it take to get you?
This thing that you do
That can't nobody else do
What if you was still on the block?
Will this love we got make you stop?
I don't wanna ever think about
Can't do without it
Who knew
It would be you changin' my plans
Stealin' my heart?
Who knew
You were the one just like me
Snatch a sista up and wifed me
Who knew that you would be my baby daddy
Spendin' all your hard-earned money on me
You came out the blue, boy, I'm glad it's you
Tell me, who knew?
It could've been you with some other chick
And it could've been me with another man
You could've walked by
And none of this would happen
Now we're shoppin' for baby shoes
Now it's rings, bells and a preacher too
Now we're forever
Tell me, who knew
It would be you changin' my plans
Stealin' my heart?
Who knew
You were the one just like me
Snatch a sista up and wifed me
Who knew that you would be my baby daddy
Spendin' all your hard-earned money on me
You came out the blue, boy, I'm glad it's you
Tell me, who knew?
It would be you changin' my plans
Stealin' my heart
Who knew you were the one just like me
Snatch a sista up and wifed me
Who knew that you would be my baby daddy
Spendin' all your hard-earned money on me
You came out the blue, boy, I'm glad it's you
Tell me, who knew?
It would be you changin' my plans
Stealin' my heart
Who knew
You were the one just like me
Snatch a sista up and wifed me
Who knew that you would be my baby daddy
