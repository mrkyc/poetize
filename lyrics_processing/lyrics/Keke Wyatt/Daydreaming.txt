Ooh, when we touch I get this feelin'
When you not around I feel so different
It's in your, whoa
Feel somewhat exposed, it's so intense (So intense, yeah yeah)
You got me spinning like a record
When you bring your pressure
Such crazy measures
Hard to let it go, so you need to flow
When you take control

I know it ain't right for me to be
Thinkin' 'bout lovin' you
I can't tell my heart how to be
Is it cheating 'cause I'm daydreaming
I'm daydreaming, I can't stop thinkin' 'bout ya
I close my eyes to be around you
Things about you make me want you
When I'm daydreaming

When I look into the mirror
I can't help but to catch a flashback
Body is startin' to flash
My system is on the go
I can't pretend, yeah
You got me open for another round
It's drizzling and it's raining now
I'm so in need and I can't contain
'Cause you're bringing out the best in me
Oh oh oh oh oh

I close my eyes to be around you
Things about you make me want you
When I'm daydreaming

I know that this just ain't right
For me to think about touching you, kissing you
Knowing we can't be
I'm daydreaming, yeah yeah, oh oh oh oh
(I know it ain't right for me)
Oh no no no no no no no no no no
Yeah yeah yeah
(I can't tell my heart how to be)
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah

I know it ain't right for me (Right for me, baby)
To be thinkin' 'bout lovin' you
(Thinkin' 'bout lovin' you, oh oh yeah)
I can't tell my heart how to be
Is it cheating 'cause I'm daydreaming (Daydreaming, baby)
I'm daydreaming, I can't stop thinkin' 'bout ya (Your beautiful face)
I close my eyes to be around you (Around you, my baby)
Things about you make me want you
When I'm daydreaming (Oh oh oh)

To be thinkin' 'bout lovin' you (Your beautiful eyes)
I can't tell my heart how to be
Is it cheating 'cause I'm daydreaming
I'm daydreaming, I can't stop thinkin' 'bout ya
I close my eyes to be around you
Things about you make me want you
