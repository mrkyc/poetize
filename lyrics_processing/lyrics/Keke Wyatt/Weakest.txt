I'm just thinking, babe
Maybe you and I could spend the weekend here
In a bed, 'cause I don't know if I have the strength
To get away from your loving, oh, oh
I'm getting weaker, babe
Every other minute (Uh)
When you all up in it
It don't ever finish
Boy, you know, you're, driving me crazy
Going insane for your loving, oh whoa whoa

Now I'm at my weakest, loving so loud
We're, busting all the speakers all on the ground
And my body's calling for you
But you barely can hear
I can't speak 'cause I'm weak, it's clear, whoa oh

That you'll never ever stop what you be doing
Take it to the floor and we still making love
Right there, right there, you know where you going
Don't know what you're doing to me
And we calling out for more, we crawling on the floor
We crawling out the bed, and bed ain't really had me
We get weaker, weakest I've ever been
But don't worry, I can handle it
You might also like
Ain't no words to say
You take me to a place like I ain't never been
Can we stay 'cause I can't move
You broke my defense
You got me hooked on your loving, oh-oh
(My body's aching, baby)
Fatigue is taking over
You work me like I owe ya
But this ain't no complaint just so you know, yeah
This feeling is crazy
I'm still addicted to your love, baby

Now I'm at my weakest, loving so loud
We're busting all the speakers all on the ground
And my body's calling for you
But you barely can hear
I can't speak 'cause I'm weak, it's clear

That you'll never (Never)
Ever stop what you be doing (Oh)
Take it to the floor
And we still making love
(we still making love)
Right there, right there you know where you going
Don't know what you're doing to me (Yeah)
And we calling out for more
(Crawling on the floor)
We crawling on the floor
We crawling out the bed
And bed ain't really had me
We get weaker, weakest I've ever been
But don't worry, I can handle it
That's why I'll never forget tonight
'Cause I ain't never felt this way in my life
Don't understand how you've taken my energy
(And making love to me, keeping me weak)
What do you expect me to do
You got me falling now

You'll never ever stop what you be doing
Take it to the floor and we still making love
Right there, right there, you know where you going (Oh)
Don't know what you're doing to me (Me)
And we calling out for more (More)
We crawling on the floor (Floor)
We crawling out the bed
And bed ain't really had me
We get weaker, weakest I've ever been (That I've ever been)
But don't worry, I can handle it

Oh oh baby
Oh oh baby
Oh oh baby
That I've ever been
