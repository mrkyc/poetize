Last night I called you on the phone
No one answered
Cause you were not alone (you're never alone)
But when someone else, other than me
Baby tell me why you hurt me so
And Constantly
Chorus:
Push me away, Push me away
I know you don't care anymore
It's hurts inside to know
Push me away, Push me away
I know you don't care anymore
I just can't take the pain
Boy I know your with your other girl (with your other girl)
I should have saw the day
You said she's just a friend (You said she's just your friend)
Don't worry Know (KeKe don't you worry now)
But here I am sitting all alone baby
You should have told me from the start ( You should've told me)
Before I gave my heart
Don't get to serious and fall in love
But now I know what i must do (Know what I must do)
Walk away from you
Inside it hurts so bad
What else can I do?

You just keep pushing me away
Chorus
