When he's all alone with you
Do you kiss him, hold his hand
Who's the woman who's the man
Is it twisted it is sick
Mother nature's little trick
I don't have to feel no shame
In God's image I am made
Your brother doesn't understand
How you could love another man
Your poor father thinks we're cursed
It's the same thing in reverse
It's the same thing in reverse
Nothing better nothing worse
It's the same thing in reverse
It's the same thing it's the same thing
Love is! La de dah
What can you say where do you go
Do you want the world to know
Make a prison of your fear
Be a kamikaze queer
You might also likeBite my lip hold my tongue
Hope I'm not the only one
I don't have to be afraid
In God's image I am made
Your brother doesn't understand
How you could love another man
And your poor father thinks we're cursed
It's the same thing in reverse
It's the same thing in reverse
Nothing better nothing worse
It's the same thing in reverse
It's the same thing it's the same thing
Do I love him, yes I love him
So don't question my affection
This is not some damn affliction
It's just love in contradiction
It's the same thing, it's the same thing
Black boys in cars (it's the same thing)
White boys with poisonous hearts (it's the same thing)
Even on the one eyed guru (it's the same thing)
And why the hell you looking at me (it's the same thing)
I never wanted to be part of the gang (it's the same thing)
I never saw this as part of my plan (it's the same thing)
I walk down the street with pride (it's the same thing)
