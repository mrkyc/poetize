Patience never pays?
It's a man's world we're living in
But that don't mean you have to start giving in
When he says, woman, there's a place for you
That don't mean that's what you have to do
There's a gift somebody gave to you
It's called talking and saying out loud
My mama never knew but I do, I do
My mama never knew
Oh she never knew
But I do, yes I do
Oh my mama she never knew
Yes I do
It was late, late in life
When my mama started to fight
She said man, boy what the hell are you
Gonna break up this room with a word or two
If it seems I ain't good enough for you
Then you know just what you have to do
Pack your bags honey, take your life with you
Go on walk out that door I won't say it no more
You might also likeMy mama never knew but I do, I do
My mama never knew
Oh she never knew
But I do, yes I do
Oh my mama she never knew
She never knew
Yes I do
Tied to the cross
Sometimes I feel like an anchor in your life
I'm just a woman
But more than a woman I have in my life
She said, you bring me down
You turn me around
If there's a justice
I want justice in this life
My mama never knew but I do, I do
My mama never knew but I do
Yes I do
Those early days who said
Patience never pays?
It's a man's world we're living in
But that don't mean you have to start giving in
When he says, woman, there's a place for you
That don't mean that's what you have to do
There's a gift somebody gave to you
It's called talking and saying out loud
My mama never knew but I do, I do
My mama never knew
Oh she never knew
But I do, yes I do
Oh my mama she never knew
Yes I do
Just like a woman
