Spits through her teeth and stares at you
White boy with the living blues
Spreads his hatred on a crowded tube
Some days I feel removed
But all I can do is think of you
I feel like I am being used yeh yeh
Well you bruise me and you batter me
And you make me feel the twist
I try to convince myself
That im strong because of this
My friends say Im beautiful
But it's time to get real
I try to find some hatred
But I can't change the way I feel
And this murder happens all around my heals
But it ain't real you are the deal
And theres poison flowing all around my head
And here I am all alone in bed
OId queen on the ship of fools
You're worried that it might sail for you
White lies from the broken youth
Who hasn't got the nerve to counsell you
Some days I feel amused
But all I can do is think of you
I feel like I've been such a fool yeh yeh
You might also likeWell you bruise me and you batter me
And you make me feel like dirt
And just for one minute
I've forgotten what I'm worth
My friends say you're beautiful
But it's time I got real
Im staring at your picture
But I can't change the way I feel
And this murder happens all around my heals
But it ain't real you are the deal
And this poisons flowing all around my head
And here I am filled with regret
Is it not enough
To just feel the love
And give it
Why can't you give it
Is it not enough
To just feel the love
And live it
Why can't you live it
Why can't you give it
Oh why can't you give it
Why can't you give it
Oh why can't you give it
You are the deal
You are the deal
You are the deal
