Oh yeah baby
1, 2, 3, oh yeah!
Oh, oh yeah
I'm a total experience
This is how I play
I'm not one of those people
With nothing much to say
I'm here to get busy
I'm here to throw down
I'm here to tell you that
The boy is back in town
I want to tell you something that you don't know
Don't know about me
They are much too blind to ever know the truth
Why can't they see
Everybody sing!
I don't care what people say
I don't care what people do
I can do what I want to do
Whether they like it or not
You might also likeI don't care what people say
I don't care what people know

Whether they like it or not
Satisfaction guaranteed
That's the way to go
Ain't no use in telling you
What they don't need to know
Some people are chilling
Some people are fly
That is what I'm telling you
Just don't believe the hype
Oh, I want to tell you something that you don't know
Don't know about me
Oh, they are much too blind to ever know the truth
Why can't they see
I don't care what people say

I can do what I want to do
Whether they like it or not
I don't care what people say
