(I love you
Do you love me?
I love you
Do you love me? )
Take a look at yourself my darling
Don't ya like what you see
Dip your foot in the pool and wonder
Is it colder than me?
Take a look at my arms oh baby
See the wounds of my youth
There were times when I could not take it
Seek the negative truth
I love you
Like the stars love the sky
And they're never lonely
I love you
'cause you're weak, incomplete and
You're never phoney
I love you
Yes I do, yes I do
But you'll never own me
You might also likeI never said I'd be good in bed
Take a look at me golden hooker
Just you swallow your pride
Take a look at me my good looker
There's a devil inside
Never sleep with your windows open
Never tell them you cry
Never tell them that you feel lonely
Coz they'll spit in your eye
I love you
I used to dream of a stream
But I need an ocean
I love you
Falling head over heels
With the slightest notion
I love you
You can stay for a while
But don't pledge devotion
I never said get inside my head
I love you
I love you I hate you
Don't mean to frustrate you
I love you
I love you I hate you
Don't mean to frustrate you
(do you love me? )
See the queen
And his old reminder
That you've never been cool
Turn your back 'cause
The spite will blind you
It's incredibly cruel
Take a look at the fools around you
See the beggar inside
There were times when I got so holy
Now I wish I had lied
I love you
Like the stars love the sky
And they're never lonely
I love you
'cause you're weak, incomplete and
You're never phoney
I love you
Yes I do, yes I do
But you'll never own me
I love you
I love you
I never said I'd be good in bed
I love you
I love you
I never said get inside my head
I love you
I love you
I used to dream of a stream but I need an ocean
