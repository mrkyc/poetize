Oh, honey, I have got to find me a man tonight
Where are you gonna do that?
Here, honey, look around you!
Look at that one
Ooh, girl, what am I gonna do with that?
But he's with somebody else
I know, honey, that's what makes him so delicious!
I came in here tonight
Just like all of you
Looking for some fun
Something nice to do
Yeah, something nice to do
I've got the feeling
You must be screaming
Your love is walking away
I've got this feeling
You must be screaming
But I just wanted to say
Girlfriend
Everybody needs a boyfriend
'Cos when you've got a boyfriend
(Uh-oh!)
You've got something else to do
You might also likeI'm throwing down tonight
Just like all of you
I'm looking for some fun
Nothing less to lose
No, nothing else to lose
Nothing less to lose
I've got the feeling
You must be screaming
Your love is walking away
I've got this feeling
You must be screaming
But I just wanted to say
Girlfriend
Everybody needs a boyfriend
'Cos when you've got a boyfriend
(Uh-oh!)
You've got something else to do
If you want to keep your man
Be a devil if you have to
(Hold on to him, girl!)
There are those that will defeat you
There are others that will leave you dry
(Don't cry!)
Take your love
And wrap it around
The first sucker that you meet!
(Go on, girl!)
What's the matter honey
Did your neck throw up?
I've got the feeling
You must be screaming
Your love is walking away
I've got this feeling
You must be screaming
But I just wanted to say
Girlfriend
Everybody needs a boyfriend
'Cos when you've got a boyfriend
(Uh-oh!)
You've got something else to do
But people don't like that!
Girlfriend
Everybody needs a boyfriend
'Cos when you've got a boyfriend
