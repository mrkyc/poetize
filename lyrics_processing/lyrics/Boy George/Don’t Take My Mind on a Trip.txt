The way you feel about me
I just wanna hold you tight
Real tight close to me
And the things you used to say
And the things you used to do
I let it go, cause
I love you so
And the things never go my way
Why do you always have to play
With my feelings
Cause
Oh yeah it's not the way we planned it
Don't take my mind on a trip
Cause to play me for a fool
You don't love me that ain't cool
No, no
Don't take my mind on a trip
Don't take my love for granted
Cause that's not the way
We planned it
