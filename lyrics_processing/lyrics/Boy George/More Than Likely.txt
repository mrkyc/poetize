What's the use in floating
If all it does is tell you someone's under you
What's the use in being if I learn
To be neglectful towards the things that mean the most to most of you
But I can hear me say
(both) more than likely, I'm the one you're living for
(pm) if I find out I am
Then I'll finally understand when I say
(both) more than likely, I'm the one you're living for

All the doors that let the loving into you
What's the use of loving if I learn
Not to feel anything at all even if it means the most to you

Even if you find
That I'm transcending most of my mind

Through the often closing doors
Of what's to come and what's in store

That must inquire, what you're living for

What's the use in changing... (let go)
To all the hopes that leave you somewhere next to lies

What's the use in buying all my time
To try and figure out the frame that likes to communicate through signs
I can hear me say
More than likely, I'm the one you're living for
If I find out I am
Then I'll finally understand when I say
More than likely, I'm the one you're living for
