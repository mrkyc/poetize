Take a picture of tonight and
Keep it by your heart
Love has left us memories
There's no better way to part
I will find another love
Someone new to drag me down
How you tried to level me
But you never stood your ground
Fortunately I got wise this time
Fortunately I got me on my mind
Oh I just want to be loved
Don't want to fight you baby
But I'm much too proud to say it now
I just want to be loved
Don't want to beg you baby
But I'm much too proud to shout it out
Take a piece of dignity and use it in your life
Even though you hurt me
I still want you to survive
Love was never special
We were never down
You will always have someone
To bring home the crown

Fortunately I got me on my mind
Oh I just want to be loved
Don't want to fight you baby
But I'm much too proud to say it loud
I just want to be loved
Don't want to beg you baby
But I'm much too proud to shout it out
When you love someone
Don't you know, love is blind
When you love someone
It'll be for all time, that's right
Fortunately I got wise this time
Fortunately I got me on my mind
Oh I just want to be loved
Don't want to fight you baby
But I'm much too proud to say it now
I just want to be loved
Don't want to beg you baby
Don't want to fight you baby
But I'm much too proud to shout it out
Just want to be loved
Oh I just want to be loved
Just want to be loved
I need to be loved
Yeah yeah
Just want to be loved
Don't want to fight you baby
Love me, love me, love me, love me yeah
Just want to be loved
