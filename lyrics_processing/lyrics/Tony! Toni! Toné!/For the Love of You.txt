I would stand by you like a tree
And dare anyone to try to move me
Girl, you've got to realize
I live to make you happy and satisfied

I will take you by the hand
And I'll show you our life plan
And I'm sure you will agree
Just how right our love could be
I would love to tell you more
About how much I adore you
I'm sure that you'll agree
That I'll do most anything

For the love of you
(For the love of you, ooh)
I'll do most anything
(I'll do anything for you)
For the love of you
(Whoa, whoa)
I'll do most anything

Sleep on your porch at night
Can't hardly wait for the sun to rise
I would stand by your window
Wishing I was there by your pillow
You might also like
I will take you by the hand
And I'll show you our life plan
And I'm sure you will agree
Just how right our love could be
I would love to tell you more
About how much I adore you
And I'm sure that you'll agree
That I'll do most anything

For the love you
(For the love of you, ooh)
I'll do most anything
(I'll anything for you)
For the love of you
(Whoa-oh, whoa-oh)
I'll do most anything
For the love you
(For the love of you, ooh)
I'll do most anything
(I'll anything for you)
For the love of you
(For the love of you)
I'll do most anything
(I'll do most anything)
I never knew I'd be this deep in your heart
And that's a fact
Relationships like this were meant from the start
Oh, whoa, whoa
I just pray that we last forever and a day
(Forever and a day, hey, hey)
But I know it will
'Cause there's no way I could ever let a love so strong go

For the love of you
(For the love of you, ooh)
I'll do most anything
(I'll do anything for you)
For the love of you
(Whoa, whoa)
I'll do most anything


For the love of you
(For the love of you, ooh)
I'll do most anything
(I'll do anything for you)
For the love of you
(For the love, the love, the love of you)
I'll do most anything
