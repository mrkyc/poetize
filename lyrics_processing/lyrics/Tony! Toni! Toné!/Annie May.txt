One thing about Annie, she always wanted to spend
But she never wore panties
I had to keep the fellas in check
But you had to have money
Now ain't a damn thing funny
I'm talkin' 'bout Annie, Annie, Annie
Big baller on the East Coast, got a wad and a whole lotta cash
High roller on the Westside, got enough for a private bash
For the almighty dollar, Annie May'll make you holler
Well, alright
Hey, hey, Annie May, you know...

Annie May's gotta make up her mind (Tell me now)
Is it a girl or is it a guy? (I don't know)
Let your hair hang down (Annie May)

The girl had a lot of knowledge, and she had big dreams of one day
Graduating from college, stepping off with a Master's degree
But she had to pay bills, y'all, so she had to get pills, y'all
Sweet Annie May, I wanna say, hey
She was daddy's little girl (Annie), would give her anything and he tried
But she had to have her own (Annie May), so she took another job on the slide
Making more than the average (Annie), 'cause she had to live lavish (Annie May)
Sweet Annie May (Annie), hey, wanna say, take it away (Annie May)
