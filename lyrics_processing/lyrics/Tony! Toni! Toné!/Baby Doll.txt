Just like chocolate she's so sweet...

My baby doll
She's the only one that I care for

Just like chocolate she's so sweet
A girl who makes you fantasize
That girl's a beauty queen
She's the drug that keeps me high
The kind of girl that makes you wild
She's well qualified

Good times I shared with her
I try to make it special
(To keep our love alive)
I'm happy I found her
'Cause she's my love
(I wouldn't trade the world for her)

My baby doll (Oh)
She's the only that I care for (She's the one)
My baby doll
She's the only that I care for
You might also like
Just like Wendy's, she's got beef
The kind of girl that makes a smile
And makes the world pause
She has style and lots of class
She's the kind of girl that talks
And leaves you standing there

Good times I shared with her
I try to make it special
(To keep our love alive)
I'm happy I found her
'Cause she's my love
(I wouldn't trade the world for her)

My baby doll (Oh)
She's the only that I care for (She's the one)
My baby doll (I said)
She's the only that I care for

I'm not trying to stake no claim
The fact is that the girl is mine
So keep your hands away
Don't go wasting all your time
To try and find a girl like mine
Will take a lifetime
Good times I shared with her
I try to make it special
(To keep our love alive)
I'm happy I found her
'Cause she's my love
(I wouldn't trade the world for her)
Good times I shared with her
I try to make it special
(To keep our love alive)
I'm happy I found her
'Cause she's my love
(And I wouldn't trade the world for her)


My baby doll

My baby doll (My baby doll)
She's the only that I care for (She's the one)
My baby doll (She's the only one)
She's the only that I (Only one) care for (Care for)
My baby doll
She's the only that I care for (Baby doll)
My baby doll
She's the only that I care for
My baby doll (My Baby Doll)
She is the only that I ever cared for
My baby doll
(My baby doll, she is the only that keeps me together)
