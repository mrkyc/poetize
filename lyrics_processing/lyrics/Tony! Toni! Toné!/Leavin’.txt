If your father says I can't have your hand
And your mother feels that I'm not your man
And your sister says she don't like my style
And your brother feels that you're still a child
Your friends always tell you that I'm a fool
But you and I both know that it's not true
So it's up to you to make up your mind
'Cause I really don't wanna waste my time

Oh, darlin', we're leavin' (Leavin')
I know we've got to get away from here (Leavin' here)
We'll go away and build a mansion (Leavin')
Til no one know what we have for each other (Leavin' here)
Let's pack our bags and let's leave, girl
("Ignorant flip, hey miss, you must jet")
("Ignorant flip, hey miss, you must jet")

I know that you really want to be with me
So don't let them dictate how we'll be
You know how it feels when we are alone
So girly you blow me like a saxophone
Girl, I like all your friends, now, don't get me wrong
So stop, look, and listen before I'm gone
Our love is cock diesel and everyone knows
So let's wave "bye-bye" 'cause we're going on home
You might also like
I know that we're leavin' (Leavin')
But I know we can do much better (Leavin' here)
There's so many things we haven't done (Leavin')
I love the way we are together (Leavin' here)
Ooh ooh ooh, baby, let's go away, let's go away (Leavin')
We'll come back and visit them some other day (Leavin' here)
I love, I love, I love you to death (Leavin')
Ooh baby, baby, baby, baby, please (Leavin' here)
Girl, pack your bags and let's go away

Going bye-bye...going bye-bye...going bye-bye

Girl, I know, I know we gotta leave (Leavin')
Oh, I know we could leave and have so much fun (Leavin' here)
We'll go away and build a mansion (Leavin')
Somewhere so far away no one could find us (Leavin' here)
And if you really wanna leave, say yes
("Ignorant flip, hey miss, you must jet")
Just say yes
("Ignorant flip, hey miss, you must jet")
Going bye-bye

Going bye-bye; we're leaving early in the morning, baby (Leavin')
We're leavin', baby; tell all of your friends (Leavin' here)
Tell 'em we got another place on the other side of town (Leavin')
We're leavin', baby; yes, we're leavin' (Leavin' here)
Tell your little sister, tell your big brother, baby (Leavin')
Tell everybody we're going to another place (Leavin' here)
Tell 'em we're leaving early in the morning (Leavin')
We're leavin', baby, yeah yeah (Leavin' here)
We're going, going, going, going, gone (Leavin')
We're going, baby, yeah yeah yeah (Leavin' here)
Tell your next door neighbor that we're leavin', leavin', leavin' (Leavin')
Leavin', leavin', leavin' (Leavin' here)
Oh, I know I'm so glad about it; I know you're so glad about it (Leavin')
Oh, baby baby (Leavin' here)
We're going, going, going, going, going, going (Leavin')
Going, going, going, going, going, going, going, going
Going, going, going, going (Leavin' here)
