When I met you, I couldn't believe my eyes
Now I'm with you, life is full of surprise
Never thought we would be holdin' hands
Tell me somethin' - was this part of your plan?

I can't believe how good it felt
I tried to keep it to myself
I know I said I wouldn't tell my friends

Had to tell somebody
I couldn't keep it to myself
I had to tell somebody
I couldn't keep it to myself
Had to tell somebody
I couldn't keep it to myself
I had to tell somebody
I couldn't keep it to myself
