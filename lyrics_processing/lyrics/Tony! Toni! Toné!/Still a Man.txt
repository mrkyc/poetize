Now looka here, I'm still standin'
Since the last time that you walked away, honey
See, me and the kids are left here disappointed
We don't have nothin' to do
But wonder where you're headed, baby

Have you ever loved somebody?
Have you ever loved somebody
Who loves you so much it hurts you to hurt them so bad?
Have you ever loved somebody?
Have you ever loved somebody
Who loves you so much it hurts you to hurt them so bad?

No, I don't want to just be complainin'
About what me and you talked about many times before, oh yeah
Now I'm not too bad about it, I'm not even mad about you
But if you want me to come back to you, I will
You know I'm still a man, baby, sugar

Somebody who loves you so much
It hurts you to hurt them so bad?
(See, I'm still a man, sugar)
Have you ever loved somebody
Who loves you so much it hurts you to hurt them so bad?

Tell me, have you ever loved somebody
Somebody who, somebody who stays out all night, never calls home
Leaves you all alone? Oh, still a man

Now I don't wanna be just complainin', no no
You see, I ain't gonna never, never, never, never, never, never
Treat you less than a woman, honey
But if you wanna take a chance on lettin' me leave you behind
You must be crazy if you let me walk out that door
You know I'm still a man, baby
Somebody who loves you so much
It hurts you to hurt them so bad?
