I know you've been lookin' for a real man
For a wild child
I know you've been lookin' for a real man
For a while

Oh, so here I am at your door
I've been here once before
Take my hand, I am your man

The very first day that I met you
I walked right by, all I said
I knew there was something about you
The way you shook my hand, I could be your man

Oh, so here I am at your door
I've been here once before
Take my hand, I am your man

If only I can see what your guy could see
I would have chose you just three months ago
But I guess the good man is tellin' me
That good things come to those who decide to wait
Now I've been watchin' you, and you've been watchin' me, too
And there ain't nothing better when two can see reality
So look in my eyes, lady, bring your lips to mine
And anything your heart needs, I'm sure we can truly find
You might also like
We'll take our time (We'll take our time)
That it is just fine (That is just fine)
I'll wait for you (I'll wait for you)
If you want me to
Take some time to get to know you
Let me show you I am your man
'Cause I know you've been

I know you been lookin' for a real man
For a wild child
(I know, I know, I know you're lookin' for a real man)
I know you've been lookin' for a real man
For a while
(D'Wayne, tell her how the story goes)

Oh, so here I am at your door
I've been here once before
Take my hand, I am your man

Now don't let your head hang down, no no baby
'Cause I am your man, yeah, yeah, your man
I am your man, I am your man, baby
Don't let your head hang down
Down, down, down, down, no
(I'll be around)
'Cause I'm gonna be around, yeah
(Be around) Yes, I am
So lose that frown
(Lose that frown) Lose that frown, yeah yeah
Lose that frown, I am down
Down, down, down, down, down, down
And you know well as I know, I'm your man, girl
Yes, I am, baby, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You want me to (You want me to)
Girl, I can't deny
