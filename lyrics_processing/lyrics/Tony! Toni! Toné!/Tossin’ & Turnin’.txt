Rub against me softly
Baby, come and taste my soul
Show me all the places
You want me to touch and my lips to go
I dig the clothes you have on
But you know that less is more
Come and let it all go
Let's make out on the floor

Tossin' and a-turnin'
Burnin' and a-yearnin' (Girl, we're just)
Tossin' and a-turnin'
Burnin' and a-yearnin'

Incense, wine and candles
Fireplace is in the room
Chances are we'll have some romance tonight, oh
Feel the thunder roaring
Like the winds are blowing
If my heart could only sing, it would sound something like

Sha-dada-da-dadadada (Well)
Sha-dada-da-dada, sha-dada-da-dada, da-da-da-da-da
(Baby, let's just toss and turn)
Sha-dada-da-dadadada (Well)
Sha-dada-da-dada (Woo), sha-dada-da-dada (Hey), da-da-da-da-da
(Hey, tossin' and a-turn, you and I)
You might also like
Tossin' and a-turnin' (Hey baby)
Burnin' and a-yearnin'
(On the floor, in the bedroom, hey, yeah)
Tossin' and a-turnin'
(Woo, 'cause you know what I'm talkin' about now, sugar)
Burnin' and a-yearnin'
(Toss and turn, and it goes a little something like this)

Ooh, ah, ooh, ah, hey
Tossin' and a-turnin'
If love could talk, I think it would sound like this
Ooh, ah, ooh, ah
Tossin' and a-turnin'
Now back me up, girl, let me hear you say, oh
Sha-dada-da-dadadada (Mmm)
Sha-dada-da-dada
(Yeah)
Tossin' and a-turnin'
I ain't askin' for too much, baby
Sha-dada-da-dadadada (But your love, your love)
Sha-dada-da-dada
It tastes so real, so real, baby
(Tossin' and turnin')
Make a blind man see, make a rich man steal
(Rich man, steal, baby)
Sha-dada-da-dadadada
You see, you're my flower, baby
Sha-dada-da-dada
Blowin' 'round
Sha-da-da-da-da-da, dadadada
And I'd like to share this moment with you (Hey hey hey hey baby)
Sha-dada-da-dadadada
Take some time (Sha-dada-da-dada), get my head together
Sha-da-da-da-da-da, dadadada
But it's alright if me and you, come on, hey, toss and turn
Tossin' and a-turnin' (Tossin' and turnin', come on)
Burnin' and a-yearnin' (Ooh, a-burnin' and yearnin')
Tossin' and turnin' (Tossin' and turnin')
Burnin' and yearnin' (Tossin' and a-turn, a-burnin' and yearnin')
Tossin' and a-turnin' (Tossin' and a-turnin')
Burnin' and a-yearnin' (Tossin' and a-turnin', a-burnin' and yearnin')
Tossin' and a-turnin' (Tossin' and a-turnin')
Burnin' and yearnin' (A-burnin' and yearnin')

Tossin' and a-turnin'
