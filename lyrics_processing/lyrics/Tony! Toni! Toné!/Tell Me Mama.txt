Tell me, mama, where did we go wrong?
Tell me, mama, can we work things out again?
Where in the hell did we ever go wrong?
Should have bought you roses each and every day

Should have thought about it first
At times a want a shiny curse
But now I'm feeling so down 'til it hurts
The turn I took what was for the worst
I'm tired of chasin' mini-skirt
I tell myself I can't believe that you left
Tell me, mama

We carved our names in a tree
No one to blame but me
I know I should have been on my J-O-B (Mama)
Don't mean to sound like a wimp
I played the role of a pimp
I don't know what it was that took over me
Tell me, mama

Yeah, I still count the days and the hours that we've been apart
But yet and still, I find it hard to believe that two people that were so close can be oh so far
You see, what we had was genuine
Yeah, it was real, so tell me, mama (Tell me, girl)
Can we restore the relationship we had?
I guess it's true what they say:
You don't miss a good thing until you've lost it
But if I could turn back the hands of time
Losing you would be the furthest thing from my mind
Huh, ball's in your court, baby (Tell me, girl)
Tell me, mama, huh; tell me, mama
