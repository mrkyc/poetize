Tomorrow will come and girl I can't wait
It's our anniversary, anniversary
The first thing I'll do is run straight to you
It's our anniversary, anniversary

It's our anniversary
It's our anniversary (Yeah, yeah), anniversary
It's our anniversary
It's our anniversary (Oh yeah), made for you and me

And I've only made plans to hold your little hand
It's our anniversary, anniversary
The pleasure's all mine 'cause we have seen good times
It's our anniversary, anniversary
Victoria won't be no secret at the end of the day
It's our anniversary, anniversary
A small cup of tea then you can have me
It's our anniversary

All I really want to say, my darling
Today is a special day we call our own
So take me in your arms and hold me
And tell me you love me and I'll be there for you

Today is a special day, not just any day
'Cause you can have everything you want your way
Tell your supervisor you're leaving early today
And I'm willing to pay for the rest of your day

Do you know what today is? (It's our anniversary)
It's our anniversary, anniversary (Ho, oh, oh, oh, oh)

First of all, I'm your soul man
Second of all, I'm your man
You know that I love you
And it makes no sense to me to be without you
Oh, I love you in a special way
Letters could come my way
Waiting for a moment for us to decide to explain it
I'll never leave your side
Oh, it's our anniversary
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, it's our anniversary
Ooh, ooh
Sit back and watch, oh, sit back and relax
Oh, I wanna sit back and watch you, just wanna relax a while

It's our anniversary, anniversary
Do you know what today is?
It's our anniversary, made for you and me
Do you know what today is?
