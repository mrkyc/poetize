It never rains in southern California
I'll see you when I get there

I haven't seen your face in a year
I can't wait 'til I get there
Just to kiss and squeeze and hug
And girl, you know the rest, 'cause they tell me

It never rains in southern California (And they tell me...)
It never rains in southern California

Maybe I'll take a flight out tonight
And you can pick me up about 8
I don't know what airline, girl
But I know it won't be late 'cause they tell me

It never rains in southern California (They tell me...)
It never rains in southern California

Now I can't sleep at night
Without your 8 x 10 by my side
That day will come
For us to be together
I'm not worried 'bout a thing
Not even stormy weather...
Baby, baby, baby...

Now, it may be cold on the East Coast
But on the other side of town, it never rains...

We have so much to talk about
A lot a catching up to do
I'll bring the diamond, girl
Because I'm so into you
'Cause they tell me...

It never rains in southern California (They tell me...)
It never rains in southern California

Now since I'll be here at your place
Let's take a week's trip for two
We don't have to go to far
Just as long as I'm with you
'Cause they tell me...

It never rains in southern California (And they tell me...)
It never rains in southern California
Can we just be alone
Without those other strangers calling your phone
Now I don't want to be that selfish kind of guy
But tonight let me take you on a natural high
Just me and you alone

Now, it may be cold on the East Coast
But on the other side of town, it never rains...
Now, it may be cold on the East Coast
But on the other side of town, it never rains...
I'll see you when I get there

It never rains in southern California
(I wanna be right there with you)
It never rains in southern California
(There's nothing else I'd rather do)
It never rains in southern California
(Baby, baby, baby)
It never rains in southern California
(I'll see you when I get there)

Now, it may be cold on the east Coast
But on the other side of town it never rains...
Now, it may be cold on the East Coast
But on the other side of town, it never rains...
(I just wanna be with you)
It never rains in southern California
(That's what they tell me)
It never rains in southern California
(Girl, I wanna be with you for the rest of my life)
It never rains in southern California
(Oh-oh, yeah)
It never rains in southern California
(Now, I want to...)
It never rains in southern California
(...hug you, squeeze you, I wanna see your pretty little smile)
It never rains in southern California
(Uh-hoo-hoo-woo-woo, woo...)
It never rains in southern California
(Let's go take a walk on the beach)
