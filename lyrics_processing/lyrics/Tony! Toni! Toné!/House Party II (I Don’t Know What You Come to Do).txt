When I feel excited 'bout cookie
I throw my feelings out on a shelf, baby
'Cause I'm sick and tired of treatin' myself like a wet food stamp, baby
So I gather 'round the people, let's have a funky party tonight
And I think I see my baby standing on the right side tonight, yeah

But I've been down all day today
Let's have a house party

Now, I don't know what you come to do

Now the bass is steadily pumpin'
The groove is funkin' hard as hell, baby
And there's got to be a honey in the crowd
Who's gonna treat me well (Still I gotta say)
There's no one like my baby
My baby knows just who she is
(Yeah, she knows, she knows, she knows)
But no matter what the problem
My cookie's gonna fix it, you dig?

See, 'cause I've been down too long today
Let's have a house party
So everybody bring your dancing shoes
Let's have a house party
