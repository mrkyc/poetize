All my love (All my love, yeah)
All my love (Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo, listen up)

Here's a little thing, from me to you
(Something that you can hold onto, tight at night
You know what I'm sayin'?)
When in times of need, you can always count on...
(Hoping that you will always cherish)

Now I know you know what I'm talkin' 'bout
Or should I spell it out, for you now?
(L-O-V-E) is what I'll be giving you
Never have to worry 'bout getting all my love

All my love
There is never too much (All my love, all my life)
All my love
Here's a little something for you...

All the precious times that we share alone, baby
(Like the way we express our feelings when nobody's around)
And I recall a night at the drive-in movie
(You know, we never did get a chance to see it)
You might also like
Do you remember when we had our falling out?
I made a big mistake, mhm
(Now it feels so good) To know that things are working out
When I find the right girl, I'll give her all my love

All my love
There is never too much (All my love, all my life)
All my love
Now baby, here's a little something for you...
All my love
I'm giving you all of my, all of my love (All my love, all my life)
All my love
Yeah baby, here's a little something for you...

Oh, mercy, mercy, mercy me
I swear I'll never look away
So I, so, I sit down and I looked at myself
And what a lucky guy I am
And I wrote this letter:
Dear love, this is something from me to you
With hopes that you will always cherish
So that you will never have to go outside our house
'Cause as sure as the sky the above, I'll be giving to you
And just you...
All my love
Oh, all of my love, baby
All my love, yeah
All my love is waiting for you (Girl)
All my love
Girl, this is something from me to you
Something you can always use
All my love
All my love is for you
All my love
Yeah, my baby, see, here's a little something for you
All my love
Oh, all of my love, baby, baby
All my love
All my lovin' (All my love), you can have it, baby (Ooh-hoo), you know it
All my love
As sure as the skies above, I'll be giving you
(I'll be giving you) Keep, I'll be giving you...
All my love (All my love)
All my love, all my life, baby, yeah
