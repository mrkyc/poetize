I'd like to ask all the men a question
Have you ever fell in love with a woman, that wasn't a woman?
I mean, all the time, you thought she had the things it takes to be a woman
Now you still got to find a real woman

Has there ever been a time
When you felt that you were locked down too soon
And you let someone else control your life without knowing
(Oh yeah)
Then you look deep down within
And wonder why one day you're feeling uptight
Then something hits you in your face
The one girl that you love will never be a one

Don't you fall in love
With a woman unless you're for sure she's a woman
(You better make sure that she's a woman)
Don't you fall in love (Yeah)
With a woman unless you're for sure she's a woman

I know there come a time
When a man needs a shoulder to cry on
And we don't know just what to do
But I guess that's when we start depending on you
See, there's nothing wrong with woman helping man
And men helping a woman
And a man's gotta do what he has to do
But guess what, fellas? You better let God teach a woman

Don't you fall in love (Oh yeah)
With a woman unless you're for sure she's a woman
(You better make sure that she's a woman)
Don't you fall in love (Oh yeah)
With a woman unless you for sure she's a woman
Don't you fall in love (I was a fool to let a pretty face)
With a woman unless you're for sure she's a woman
(Take control of me)
Don't you fall in love
(I knew one day I'd have to face reality)
With a woman unless you're for sure she's a woman (Oh yeah)

You see, love is blind
Sometimes it can get you by the neck and choke ya
Make you commit to a side
But you gotta be strong and one day you say
This is the therapy and sometime
What we do, what we do with the love

Don't you fall in love
With a woman unless you're for sure she's a woman
(You better be sure that she's a woman)
Don't you fall in love
With a woman unless you're for sure she's a woman
(You gotta know that she's a woman)
Don't you fall in love
With a woman unless you're for sure she's a woman
Don't you fall in love
With a woman unless you're for sure she's a woman (Yeah, yeah)
Take...your...time (Take your time)
Make...up...your...mind (Make up your mind)
I think I'm falling, I got to get up, to get up
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I think I'm calling, I think I'm calling
You better let God pick your one

Don't you fall in love
With a woman unless you for sure she's a woman
(You better make sure that she's a woman)
Don't you fall in love (Oh yeah)
With a woman unless you're for sure she's a woman
(You know what?)
Don't you fall in love
(She might have a pretty smile)
With a woman unless you for sure she's a woman
(She might have a pretty face)
Don't you fall in love
(She might drive a fancy car)
With a woman unless you for sure she's a woman
(But that don't mean you'll get that far)
Don't you fall in love
(You better watch out, watch out, boy)
With a woman unless you for sure she's a woman
