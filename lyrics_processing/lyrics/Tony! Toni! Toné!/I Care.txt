Hey, I think it's time for me to meet a new friend
And it's just so strange, I've been seeing you every day now
Well, not actually "seeing" you
But I wish I could be with you
And I know that time waits for no one
And I feel today is a very special day
So today, I think I'll walk over to you and say these words...

Hey baby, what's your name and number?
Do you think that I can come over?
Or maybe we can meet at the corner store?
Any time of the day is alright
I believe in love at first sight
I hope we can become the best of friends

I care
I care for you, girl
I care
And I know that I care
You know I care
I care for you, girl
I care
I care
I care
You know I care
I care
Woo, ooh
You might also like
Let's touch and see if things can work out
'Cause I feel love movin' without a doubt
I can see it in your eyes, you can feel it too
Don't hold back, baby, just let it go
We can take the time and go real slow
Take my hand, that's where our souls will be

I care
I care for you, baby
I care
I know that I care
You know I care
I really care for you
I care
I care
I'll be your friend
I care
And you'll be mine
You know I care
Ooh, you know that I care
I care
I care, I care

Remember that first day
I had so much to say
And then so fast, you went away
But the very next day
You were coming my way
Now here's my chance to tell you how much I know I care
I care
I care for you, girl
I care
And I know that I care
You know I care
So much that I wanna tell you
I care
Woo, that I care
I care
We'll be together
I care
'Til the end of time
You know I care
I wanna take you to paradise
I care
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I care

I care
If I had one wish
You know I care
If I had just one wish
I care
My wish would be something like this:
You would come with me to my summer home
There wouldn't be no sound, no telephone
I care
I'd do anything that you want me to do
I care
And everything will be just for you
I care
I care
You know I care
So much that I want to tell you
I care
Girl, I know that I care
I care
I care for you
I care
And I wanna be right next to you
You know I care
