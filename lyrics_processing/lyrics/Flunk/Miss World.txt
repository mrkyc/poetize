I know it's gonna be for real
This time
I know it's gonna be for real
Full stand still
I miss the chemistry of your kiss
This time
I know it's gonna be for real
Full stand still
This time
I know it's gonna be for real
Full stand still
I miss the chemistry of your kiss
This time
I know it's gonna be for real
Full stand still
Alone
And it's for real
Oh full stand still
Alone
And it's for real
You might also likeI feel so totally happy, and it's all so real
I could surf the earth on a banana peel
I'm so totally into this
The chemistry of your kiss
The way you lose yourself at night
The way you look in the morning light
You're so pretty
Makes me wanna burn this city down
I walk the streets with a frown
The size of a playground merry-go-round
This time (this time)
I know it's gonna be for real
You are Miss World
I miss
The chemistry of your kiss
Full stand still
Alone
And it's for real
Ah full stand still
This time
I know it's gonna be for real
Full stand still
Alone
And it's for real
I feel so totally happy, and it's all so real
I could surf the earth on a banana peel
I'm so totally into this
The chemistry of your kiss
The way you lose yourself at night
The way you look in the morning light
You're so pretty
Makes me wanna burn this city down
I walk the streets with a frown
The size of a playground merry-go-round
This time (this time)
I know it's gonna be for real
You are Miss World
I miss
The chemistry of your kiss
Alone...
The chemistry of your kiss
You are Miss World
I miss
