One, two, three, four
I really feel it

Sometimes I sit alone at nights
In a blind situation
So many things are running through my mind
In a blind situation

Should I, should I, should I, should I
Should I, should I, should I, should I
Should I, should I, should I, should I
Should I, should I, should I, should I

Should I lie?
(Hangin' out with Shea, it's a nice day, you know, baby)
It's a blind situation
Should I lie?
(I'm feelin' that, yo, uh, yo)
It's a blind situation

Sometimes I wonder where my life's at
If it's a song, is this the right track
My sanity feels like a weak boxer
Too weak to fight back
Away from home where I go in my regular zone
Now it's hotels and four girls with cellular phones
The voice in my head is a talker and the fellow just roams
If you call my soul's operator it'll tell you I'm gone
I'm hurtin' y'all, I really feel it
Ayo
You might also like
My world requires a big disguise
It's a blind situation
Leaving you was my sad surprise
It's a sad situation

Should I, should I, should I, should I
Should I, should I, should I, should I
Should I, should I, should I, should I
Should I, should I, should I, should I

Should I lie?
(I'm feelin' that, yo)
It's a blind situation
Should I lie?
(I'm hangin' out with Shea)
It's a blind situation

It used to be about diamonds
Now it's walking on clouds with silver linings
Seeing Jesus on the stone throne shinin'
Or is it that secondhand weed smoke from my friends combining?
It's ill, friends get killed, pain has precise timing
I really feel it
One, two, three, four
Sometimes I sit alone at night
In a blind, it's a blind situation
So many things are running through my mind
It's a blind, it's a blind situation
Should I, should I, should I, should I
Should I, should I, should I, should I
It's a blind situation
Should I, should I, should I, should I
Should I, should I, should I, should I
It's a blind situation
(I really feel it)
Should I, should I, should I, should I
Should I, should I, should I, should I
It's a blind situation
Should I, should I, should I, should I
Should I, should I, should I, should I
Should I?
