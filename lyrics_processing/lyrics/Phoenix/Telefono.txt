Pronto? Si...
Come va a Hollywood?
Oh you're staying a little longer?
Well I thought you'd be done by September...

Non posso vivere
Troppo bisogno di te
Wish you decided to stay
We're too far, we're too far away

Vivere
Guarda, guarda intorno a te
Yeah I'm just calling to say
No, how can I sleep when you're wide awake?
Frutti di mare
Right beside me
Watch the ocean with you
Innamorato
Agitato
Watch her movie debut

I painted the house
I bought sheets that you liked on that trip when we went to Rome
And I got a motorboat for the summer
In case you're done early or if you plan to visit
But wait... D'you plan to visit?

Non posso vivere
Troppo bisogno di te

We're too far, we're too far away

Frutti di mare
Right beside me
Watch the ocean with you
Innamorato
Agitato
Watch her movie debut
I wish you'd call from set
I wish I didn't get upset
Who's that guy you hang out with?
Is he the lead or just an extra?
Instead of calling please ritorna a me
How can I sleep when you're wide awake?

Telefono
Ringing for me
Can I tell you?
I dream in stereo
And in a studio
Far far away
I might lose you
To some executive
Telefono
Ringing for me
Can I tell you?
I dream in stereo
And in a studio
Far far away
I'm here solo
