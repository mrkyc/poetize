A restricted area
Shaped like a Petunia
Thank God you know your ways
It's on your mind
It's on all the time
And I find it hard to explain
What would you trade me for?
While this girl's playing hula hoop
Under the malicious
Winter solstice

Turn the lights on
Find me a narrative
Something positive
This requiem played a few times before
I heard it once
So I'm not sure
On the phone, "I told you"
Why open your eyes to go to bed?
Drive straight to the ocean
And see what we won't find out
Even the righteous beheaded their loved ones

Now it's hard to connect
But the world's unchained
And soon
It'll be public domain
It's too hard to remain
Astute
But I will stay
If you're detained
With you
I'll wash my hands
Until It rains
Through you
You might also like

Keeping the lights on
Obliged to the bygones
Thank God you know your ways
If this time it's true
Why bother reeling you?

All this fine jewelry
Look at this diamond shaped out of glass
I try to make this Ruby shine nice
I'm trying to make a living
Is that something that you don't mind
Fine
Did you ever think it could have been in our lifetime?

So give me a ride home
Find me a narrative
Something positive
This requiem played a few times before
I heard it twice
So I'm not sure
On the phone "I told you"
Why open your eyes to go to bed?
Drive straight to the ocean
Let's see what you won't find out
Cover your eyes for Winter Solstice
Now it's hard to connect
But the world's unchained
And soon
It'll be public domain
It's too hard to remain
Astute
But I will stay
If you're detained
With you
I'll wash my hands
Until it rains
