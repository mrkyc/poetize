I can see her from afar
She just dey shine like a morning light
I can see very clear
She just dey shine in a broad daylight (hey)
And she was walkin'
And I was watchin'
Every step and the move she was makin'
She is adoring
I am admiring
Her hips and her calves

Beauty is a natural thing
Original thing and a mysterious thing hey
Rise up my voice and sing
I thank the Lord for a beauty queen
'Cause your black is beautiful
Beauty from my own

Beauty in disguise

Black is beautiful (hey)
