Lookin' To My Right See Like A Square
I Took A Look Below I Saw A Fat King Kong
I Took A Look Above But I Fell Out As I Belong
Do The Crime And Pay A Fine And Maybe Take A Dive
Started Out On Marijuana Ended Up On Red Wine
Gotta Fuck Her Everyday Just To Feel Alive
Sentimental Innuendo Fallen By The Wayside
The Brain Police Are Watching My Back
My Sanity Is Under Attack
I've Got A Crazy Look In My Eye
Since My Girl Ran Off With A Mexican Guy
Maybe I Should Swallow A Little Pill
Maybe I Should Listen To Dr. Phil
Modern Life Could Certainly Make One ill
Ron
I've Been Sitting Corner Of Hollywood And Vine
Where I Saw Scareface In Seventy-Five
I Saw Chuck Berry At Gone With The Wind
He Had A Little Whitey Snugglin' Up To Him
The Street Was Kind Of Dirty But The Street Had Soul
Saw Bobby Boy Drinking To The Monster Mash Show
I Saw Frank Zappa Eat A Lonely Hot Dog
Heard Wild Thing Played By The Troggs
