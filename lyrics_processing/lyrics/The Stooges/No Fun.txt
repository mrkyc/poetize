No fun, my babe
No fun
No fun, my babe
No fun

No fun to hang around
Feelin' that same old way
No fun to hang around
Freaked out for another day

No fun, my babe
No fun
No fun, my babe
No fun

No fun to be alone
Walking by myself
No fun to be alone
In love with nobody else

Well maybe go out, maybe stay home
Maybe call Mom on the telephone
Well c'mon, well c'mon
Well c'mon, well c'mon
Well c'mon, well c'mon
Well c'mon, well c'mon
