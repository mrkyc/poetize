You say one for the treble, two for the time
One for the treble, two for the time
One, one for the treble, two for the time
Come on y'all, let's rock, rock
One for the treble, two for the time
One for the treble, two for the time
One, one for the treble, two for the time
Come on y'all, let's rock

Right about now, it's time to get busy
One, two, thrizzy - shut the fuck up!
And bring that ballistic riff from the Bizkit
Straight through the speakers with the (Hey, hey)
Check this future shock of rock revolution, punk (Oh my God!)
Here it comes, so shut it up
You keep on talking, we gonna shut yo' ass straight the fuck up!
Call the cops, look up in the stands
Got another riot on our hands
I pull this mic straight out my toolkit
To fix you wannabes that ruined all the music
But never mind, those phonies never get it
The phonies just deny it 'cause rock ain't in the diet
Apocalypse now, who's talkin' shit now?
Gimme the countdown - 3, 2, 1

Now I'm gonna fill up my lungs with some butane
Turn the mic into a flame, damn that shit's hot!
Super heavy, built like a Chevy
And I ain't really mad at the (Hey, hey)
My significant chocolate, three dollar bills from the cockpit (Oh my God!)
Round two, you ready for a break?
You keep on talkin' Imma break you up something like this!
Full throttle, better be prepared
Comin' with the kick and the snare
And I'm downright dirty, ruthless movement
Why'd you have to ruin all the music?!
No stoppin' 'til we're knock, knock, knockin' on Heaven's door
Pedal on the floor
Apocalypse now, who's talkin' shit now?
Gimme the countdown - 3, 2, 1
Here we go again!
Right now, let's go
Me and you, toe to toe
So we can rock, we can roll
Here we go again!

I wanna tell you, tell you to your face right now
Not really sure that, not really sure I know how
Gonna try, gonna try
Give you a piece of my mind
Gonna try, gonna try
And I hope you don't mind

I'm a crack addict
That's right, I'm a crack addict
You heard me, I'm a crack addict
I'm addicted to crackin' skulls when punks start static
It's time to panic!
I'm addicted to crackin' skulls when punks start static!
It's time to panic!
I'm addicted to crackin' skulls when punks start static!
Here we go again!

Fuck your fake ass!
