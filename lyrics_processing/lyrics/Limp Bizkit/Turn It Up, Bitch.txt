Hey, Fred, shut the fuck up (C'mon, Freddie D)

I'ma make an announcement, this cracker ain't slouchin'
Got the flow, keep the big boys bouncin'
Nu metal one hit wonders
The Bizkit back, time to run from the gunner
Banger, another Limp banger
Out the closet, off of the hanger
Y'all better take cover (Yeah)
Here come a UAP, Master Chief says, "Danger"
DJ Lethal (Lethal)
Got the SP-12s hella medieval
Try not to forget (Uh)
I'm still a redneck fucker from the sticks
Light it up like an ambulance
Siren blarin' in my head again
I'm about to go nutso, straight freak show
No room in the bistro

Bigger, better, fake it? Never
Livin' with or without cheddar
Love my early sex, ain't marrying
Bitch, you heard me? You ain't worthy
See Limp Bizkit LiveGet tickets as low as $25You might also like
Everybody needs some hardcore, fucked-up bang-your-head shit
So turn it up, bitch
Everybody needs some hardcore, fucked-up bang-your-head shit
So turn it up, bitch

Full metal jacket causin' me some racket
Talkin' me some shit 'cause I can back it (Yeah)
I ain't into packin', but when I'm stuck in traffic
I feel like blastin' all you fools with this Maverick
Tactic, plastic, fuckin' up the fabric
Better get a grip, hide your stash in the cabinet
Bitch slap, pitch black, smacked with a ball bat
Knocked out is how I'm gonna call that
I can see that the times have changed
But it's still the same game, just a bunch of bullshit
And when you're full of shit, you're always full of shit
Check yourself and realize who you're fuckin' with
The Don Julio fuckin' up the studio
Take your microphone and put your ass on blast
Fuck all the cash, I'll be the first and last
King of nu metal from the trash, hell yeah

Everybody needs some hardcore, fucked-up bang-your-head shit
So turn it up, bitch
Everybody needs some hardcore, fucked-up bang-your-head shit
So turn it up, bitch (Turn it up)
Everybody needs some hardcore, fucked-up bang-your-head shit
So turn it up, bitch (C'mon)
Everybody needs some hardcore, fucked-up bang-your-head shit
So turn it up, bitch
Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo-ah, it's freezing in here
Hahahaha, yeah
