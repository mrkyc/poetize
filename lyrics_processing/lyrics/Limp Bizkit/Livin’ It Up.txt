(Life in the fast lane)
This is dedicated to you Ben Stiller
You are my favorite motherfucker!
I told you, didn't I?

Drama makes the world go around
Does anybody got a problem with that? (Yeah)
My business is my business
Who's guilty? Can I get a witness?
First things first
The Chocolate Starfish is my man Fred Durst
Access Hollywood, license to kill
A redneck fucker from Jacksonville
Bangin' on the dumpster funk
My microphone machete's in the back of my trunk
Rocker's who's steady with the he says, she says
And don't forget about the starfish navigation system
Don't hate me, I'm just an alien
With thirty seven tons of new millenium
Dum-diddie-dum, where's it coming from?
Mrs. Aguilera, come and get some!
Oh no, which way to go to the dance floor?
It's on my stereo, pay me no mind
I seen The Fight Club about twenty eight times
See Limp Bizkit LiveGet tickets as low as $25You might also like
And I'm 'a keep my pants saggin'
Keep a skateboard, a spray can for the taggin'
And I'm 'a keep a lot of girls in my band wagon
'Cause I don't give a fuck, livin' life in the fast lane

(Life in the fast lane)
I'm just a crazy motherfucker livin' it up
Not giving a fuck, livin' life in the fast lane
(Life in the fast lane)
Another crazy motherfucker livin' it up
Not giving a fuck in the fast lane

Take two, hoo-haa!
Now who's the star sucker? I'm the Starfish
You silly motherfucker
Puff puff, give the marijuana cig, oops
I don't even smoke, but I love the way it smells
Here's a toast to the females
Sippin' lung champagne from a seashell
I think I gotta feel and pop his ass like a zit
With the starfish navigation system
I'm no cheap thrills, baby
Fill the briefcase with three dollar bills
I'm just an ordinary run of the mill fella
Spittin' out hella' mic skills
And I'm 'a keep my pants saggin'
Keep a skateboard, a spray can for the taggin'
And I'm 'a keep a lot of girls in my band wagon
'Cause I don't give a fuck, livin' life in the fast lane

(Life in the fast lane)
I'm just a crazy motherfucker livin' it up
Not giving a fuck, livin' life in the fast lane
(Life in the fast lane)
Another crazy motherfucker livin' it up
Not giving a fuck in the fast lane

'Cause it's so easy to tell a lie (Life in the fast lane)
And it's so easy to run and hide (Life in the fast lane)
But it's not easy to be alive (Life in the fast lane)
So don't be wasting none on my time!

This world is like a cage and I don't think it's fair
And I don't even think that anybody cares
It'll leave a hole (What?) down the side of me (What?)
And it'll leave a scar (What?), can anybody see? (What?)
That we gotta get it out (We gotta get it out)
We gotta get it out (We gotta get it out)
We gotta get it out (We gotta get it out)
And I'ma get it out with the motherfuckin'
Microphone plugging in my soul
I'm a renegade riot getting out of control
I'mma keep it alive and continue to be
Flying like an eagle to my destiny
So can you feel me? (Hell yeah!) Can you feel me? (Hell yeah!)
If you feel, motherfucker, then you'll say (Hell yeah!)
Then you'll say (Hell yeah!)
Hell yeah, I'm livin' life in the fast lane!
'Cause it's so easy to tell a lie (Life in the fast lane)
And it's so easy to run and hide (Life in the fast lane)
But it's not easy to be alive (Life in the fast lane)
So don't be wasting none on my time!

(Yeah, bring it on!)
I'm just a crazy motherfucker livin' it up
Not giving a fuck, livin' life in the fast lane
(Life in the fast lane)
Another crazy motherfucker livin' it up
