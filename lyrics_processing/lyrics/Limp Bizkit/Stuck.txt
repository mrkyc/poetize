Psycho female blowin' up the phone line
You need to tighten that screw, it's been loose for a long time
I've been slammed with some bad luck
Soon I'm gonna bring you doom with the buck-buck
And now you duck, duck, goose, I'm letting loose
With the 30-ought freestyle labeled hostile by my profile
Must be all the madness, you and all your tactics
Jonesing for my cash, got to make them pockets super fat
Hey I'm a humble man kicking out my jams like a tramp
I'm gonna stick it like a stamp to this business
What's with all the business?
I get paid to take the microphone and slay the stage
Stay away from all the bros in my band and all the fans
And all my friends when the cash is coming in
Or I'll be slamming them balls to the wall
With the ink on my flesh to the 'yes, yes y'all!'
No 9 to 5, I'll still survive
I keep my engine on that amp like a Chattanooga champ
That's all we need, another bad seed
Planted on this Earth motivated by greed

You wanna play that game, bitch!?
You take a dash for my cash, it's your ass that I'm blasting
Boy, you wanna play that game, bitch!?
You take a dash for my cash, it's your ass that I'm blasting
You're bad luck, you're so... stuck!

Stuck! Deep down in that hole again!
Stuck! Got your brain on my green again!
Stuck! You're so, you're so, you're so
Stuck! You don't even know!

All I wanted was a Pepsi, just one Pepsi
Far from suicidal, still I get them tendencies
Bringing back them memories that I really miss
When I reminisce rocking back in the 80s
Live my attitude to do or die!
Once I was a maggot but now I'm just Super Fly
Bound for the boundaries, no limit G
Fat ass rhythms driven by my destiny
Your style's in my pocket
Proclaimed to regain that essence
Pressin 'cause I'm hostile, labeled by my profile
Indeed I am, I am indeed hostile when it comes to greed

You wanna play that game, bitch!?
You take a dash for my cash, it's that ass that I'm blasting
Boy, you wanna play that game, bitch!?
You take a dash for my cash it's your ass that I'm blasting
You're bad luck, you're so... stuck!
Stuck! Deep down in that hole again!
Stuck! Got your brain on my green again!
Stuck! You're so, you're so, you're so
Stuck! You don't even know!

Aw yeah, ain't nothin' like a greedy bitch
Digging, digging, digging, digging, digging so deep for that green
