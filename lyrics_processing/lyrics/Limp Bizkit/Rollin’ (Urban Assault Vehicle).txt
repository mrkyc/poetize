People in the house, put them hands in the air
'Cause if you don't care, then we don't care! (Yeah)
See, I ain't givin' a fuck, quit pressin' your luck
Untouchable, branded unfuckable
So keep me in this cage until you run that mouth
Then I'mma have the plague and break the fuck out
And then we'll see who's left, after one round with X
And what am I bringin' next? Just know it's Red and Meth

Check my dangerous slang atrocious
When I let these nuts hang, focus, it's Wu-Tang
What the fuck's a Hootie and the Blowfish?
I wave my Black Flag at the roaches
Who approaches, these twin, super-soakers
Who have poisonous darts for culprits
Too late to get your blow gun un-holstered
You're left buttered up and lightly toasted
So what, I drink and smoke too much
So what I cuss too much (Yo), shut the fuck up!
Now when we roll, you motherfuckers tuck in your gold
'Cause for the platinum, I'm jackin' niggas up in limos
It ain't nothin', for bullets to unbutton your clothes
Description, yellow male, tissue up in his nose
You bitches, swing the vine on the baboon nuts
I'm hairy as hell, outta hell and tattooed up
I'm a dog, only fuck in the bathroom, what?
In high school, I dealt only with the classroom sluts

My name is Johnny, Donnie Brasco
Tuck the gat low, cut your cash flow
Yell if you want money (Ahh), funny (Ahh)
A hungry dummy snatch crumbs from me
Docs and Hot Nix, bodies in the mosh pit

And I'm the D.O., you lookin' at the raw invented
On Friday, I spit thirty-five to forty minutes
Smell up the bathroom like Craig pa was in it
Endin' up on your back, Wu swords up in it
Anyone can match me, I crack 'em all to Guinness
Fuck how many thugs players and ballers in it
Brick City, Shaolin, better call us sinners
Boys that'll run up in your wife, maul and spill it
Ahh
C'mon!

Bald head with the boots who shoots to make it spark (What?!)
Now I'm a fair nigga, but ain't nann nigga (Uh!)
Quicker than the hair-trigga, so if you dare nigga (Uh! C'mon!)
It'll be like your man tryin' to hold yo' brain to yo' head
But you'll be shittin' on yourself, 'cause you already dead
And at the funeral you won't need a casket (Uh!)
Leavin' just enough of him to stuff in a basket (Uh! Uh!)
A tisket a tasket, I really need my ass kicked (What?! What?!)
My moms never let me forget, that I'm a bastard (What?!)
I ain't never been shit, and ain't gon' be shit (Uh! Uh!)
That's why I take shit, whenever I see shit (Uh! Uh!)
It's just that D shit, D's short for do what I wanna do (C'mon!)
