Mellow out!
Bitch
Lay low...
Lay!

I thought I knew you, took the time to throw my love into you
Screw you, 'cause now you got me sitting in the sewer
I'm through with all them roller coaster rides
See, I ain't forgot about the knots that you've been tying with my insides
I dropped my pride, without you I was sure to die
I tried with cash and all I could to make it last
Now I accepted that was in the past
I know you love me, love me like a piece of trash

But at first, you were so sweet
Couldn't go without seeing your face for an hour, so sour
It all became a hassle, you were even living in my castle
Just to use me and verbally abuse me
That's not the way I'm running my shop
It took a while to see the light before I stopped
And you got dropped off; it's over, probably I'll be sweating it
But in the long run, you'll be the one regretting it
Maybe you won't, maybe you will
But baby, you're still about as real as a three dollar bill

There's no one to blame but you
And who gets the blame? Me
There's no one to blame but you
And who gets the blame? Me

I sound like a bitch (A little bitch in heat)
With all that anger that I'm feeling, bitch, I think it's heat
Another split tail, just another split tail
Thanks for the lesson, now get your shit and hit the trail
We know I'm coming from the old school, you damn fool
Intensity is something that I'm made of
And certainly I'm not afraid of a little smack in my face
Thanks for that taste

There's no one to blame but you
And who gets the blame? Me
There's no one to blame but you
And who gets the blame? Me

It's all on me!
There's no one to blame!
