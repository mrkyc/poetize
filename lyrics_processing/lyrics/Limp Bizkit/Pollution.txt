Yuck!
Uh, uh, uh, drop that shit
Straight coming at you
Punk

To criticize is critical when digging on my concept
Rhythms keep on building like the smog
Got you running from the law
Maybe it's that low-end smothered with the freestyle
Maybe it's the thought of being on the bottom of the pile
Styles bound to the skylines
Keep 'em on the sidelines choking on my fly rhymes
You need the Heimlich maneuver
This ain't no joke, you're gonna choke
When I'm slinging it to you

When did you decide (When did you decide?)
To be narrow in your mind? (When did you decide?)
When did you decide?

I'll probably never understand
(The pollution)
You preach the noise about the words that you don't wanna hear
(The pollution)
I keep the grip real tight on the mic when I spill
(The pollution)
You preach the noise about the words that you don't wanna hear
(The pollution)
I keep the grip real tight
See Limp Bizkit LiveGet tickets as low as $25You might also like
Breaker, breaker 1-9, spitting out that skill
Suicidal funk let me know you're real
I'm walking on a thin line with the sticky bass line
Now you're stuck with the flow running through your mind
So when you're crossing over, let me know you're real
Put that flex on your neck, now you got the feel
Rumble like the thunder, now you're going under
Makes me wonder what the fuck is even going down
I listen to 'em stereotype, when they complain
I can't refrain from bringing on the pain

When did you decide (When did you decide?)
To be narrow in your mind? (When did you decide?)
When did you decide?

I'll probably never understand
(The pollution)
You preach the noise about the words that you don't wanna hear
(The pollution)
I keep the grip real tight on the mic when I spill
(The pollution)
You preach the noise about the words that you don't wanna hear
(The pollution)
I keep the grip real tight
(That's it, that's it)
Ain't nobody doin' like... you

So when they tell me to turn down that volume
I'm gonna bring that beat back
And when they tell Sam to turn down that bass
I'm gonna bring that beat back
And when they tell me to turn down the vocal
I'm gonna bring that beat back
And when they tell us to shut the fuck up
I'm gonna bring that beat back!
Yeah, gonna bring that beat back!
Whoa, gonna bring that beat back!
Fuck, gonna bring that beat back!
Yo, yo, yo, yo J bring that beat back!

When did you decide (When did you decide?)
To be narrow in your mind? (When did you decide?)
When did you decide?

I'll probably never understand
(The pollution)
You preach the noise about the words that you don't wanna hear
(The pollution)
I keep the grip real tight on the mic when I spill
(The pollution)
You preach the noise about the words that you don't wanna hear
(The pollution)
Gonna bring that beat back!
I'm gonna bring that beat back!
(Bring it, bring it, bring it, bring it!)
I'm gonna bring that beat back
Beat back, bring that, beat back
Beat back, bring that, beat back
Beat back, so shut the fuck
Whoa!
Back! Back! Back! Back! Back! Back! (Fred, shut up, alright?)
Back! Bring that fucking beat back
(This is me telling you to shut up.)
Back (Shut up!)
You sucker (Shut...)
Fucking sucker song (Fred, shut the fuck up!)
