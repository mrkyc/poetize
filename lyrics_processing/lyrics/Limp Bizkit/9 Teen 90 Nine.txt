Bring it on!

Fame - you're claiming is the top of the world
This stage - I'm claiming is the top of the world
And love - I'm feeling when you people connect
And if you're out in the crowd, you're getting more than respect
And if you're wondering, I got plenty of flows
I'm making plenty of friends and many of foes
But as the audience grows, security knows
Stopping me now is kinda serious

No use in dreading what they call Armageddon
I think we made it through the slump
But who really cares where we're heading?
'Cause now you motherfuckers got a reason to jump!

So lets make something out of it, this way we can all relate
Worldwide, we collide, this is how we communicate
So let's make something out of it, whoever thought we would see the day?
I can't believe we did it, so let's drift away

Hate -  a feeling I don't really get
And hate - can get you in some serious shit 
Time - is something that may change me
But I can't change time, so fuck it!
I've been stumbling through these thoughts
And about the fact that I could be delirious
But as the audience grows, security knows
Stopping me now is kinda serious

So lets make something out of it, this way we can all relate
Worldwide, we collide, this is how we communicate
So let's make something out of it, whoever thought we would see the day?
I can't believe we did it, so let's drift away

We see good things change and good things go away
We see good things waste and we taste - the pain
What we need is a place to escape from today
Right!
What we need is a place to escape from today
RIGHT!
Yeah!
