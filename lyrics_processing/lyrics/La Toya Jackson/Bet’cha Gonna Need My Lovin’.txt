(Bet'cha gonna need my kissin')
(Bet'cha gonna need my huggin')
(You'll find out what cha missin')
You say feeling low
Well I see the reason why
You keep sitting in the dark
While lovers pass you by
You have a lot friends
The kind money can buy
But when you're home alone
Do you close the door and cry?
(Inside your soul the hurt is plain to see)
From the door shut in your face
To the lies you'll need
(We'll share a love so true)
Just give me half a chance and you believe
In me#151#
(Bet'cha gonna need my lovin')
I knew it form the start
You need my caring heart
(Bet'cha gonna need my huggin')
Good lovin' hard to fine
My love, it's one of a kind
Stay with me; don't turn your back on love
Give us the chance to find romance you're all I'm thinking of
Don't be afraid to open up your heart
You and me together will never be apart
No#151#
(Inside your soul the hurt is plain to see)
From the door shut in your face
To the lies you'll need

Just give me half a chance and you believe
In me#151#
