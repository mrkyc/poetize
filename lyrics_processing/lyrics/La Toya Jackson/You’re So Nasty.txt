I kinda like the funky clothes you wear
I like your shirts ripped off and half bare
I even like what you do with my photograph
Even though you know I'm standing there
Your body's cut, buffed everywhere
People look and I love it when other women stare
The way you walk, your sex appeal and talk
I got your game, 'cause mine is just the same

I know you're so nasty
Guess what? I am too
I know you're so nasty
I'm ready, how 'bout you?
I know you're so nasty
Guess what? I am too
I know you're so nasty
Let's get it on, so tell me what you wanna do
Come follow me
I'm your destiny

Tell me what you want, whatchu really, really want
Tell your mama what you want
Tell me what you want, whatchu really, really want
Why don't you tell me what you want?
Tell me what you want, whatchu really, really want
Tell your mama what you want
Tell me what you want, whatchu really, really want
Why don't you tell me what you want?

Bet you got an attitude like a billionaire
Know what you want and exactly how to get there
Don't need directions, don't even need a plan
Since I met you, I don't want another man
Other women, they often come and go
I'm doing life, let everybody know
I don't care what I have to do
I can't stand the thought of losing you

I know you're so nasty
Guess what? I am too
I know you're so nasty
Let's get it on, so tell me what you wanna do
Come follow me (Yeah)
I'm your destiny (Uh)

Tell me what you want, whatchu really, really want
Tell your mama what you want
Tell me what you want, whatchu really, really want
Why don't you tell me what you want?
Tell me what you want, whatchu really, really want
Tell your mama what you want
Tell me what you want, whatchu really, really want
Why don't you tell me what you want?

I'm sorry, but we can just start from the top?
