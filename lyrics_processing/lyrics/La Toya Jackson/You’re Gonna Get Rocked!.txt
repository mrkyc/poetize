For those of you who didn't believe
Roll up your sleeves
And if you're hanging
(Cool!)
And if you're not
(Just leave!)
Cause LaToya is throwing down with her new sound
(In full effect)
So gimme some respect
(Or we'll put you in check)
Kick it off, boys
It's time to get correct
(Bet)
Think I better put you in check
You're showin' me much disrespect
(Whoa oh oh oh oh)
You're gonna get rocked
This time you have gone too far
Gonna sock you when you're hot
And leave a scar
(Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh)
You're gonna get rocked
You might also likeYou ask me if I know what to do
Well, homeboy
Who in the hell are you talking to?
(Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh)
You gonna get rocked
I'm gonna hit you in the chest with the best
Feel the drums
Gonna know where I'm coming from
(Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh)
You're gonna get rocked by me
Check the move
Check the time
Go for yours
I'm going for mine
(Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh)
You're gonna get rocked
Throw your hands in the air
Let's break through
Keep moving and grooving
As a rocking rule
I ain't gonna stop 'til I hit the top
Come on, Full Force
Let the beat rock
Slow down to throw down
I just mow down
Whoever stands in my way
That's lowdown
A showdown when you're round
That's how we'll go round
Get your hands out of my face
Or we'll throw down
This is my house
And a party I'm giving
Tell me
(How the hell you living!)
You can't take or shake
The sounds I make
You're gonna get dissed unless you break
You're gonna get rocked
You're gonna get rocked
I like it
I ain't takin no prisoners
I like it
You're gonna get rocked
