Wicked love
Break it in, ah

All my life I've always wanted more
Now that I fell for you I've got what you're lookin' for
So satisfied that I stopped searchin'
Whatever you do to me, baby, it's workin'
Your love is trouble that made my feelings double
I enjoy to flirt with danger, hate to brush with trouble, baby
Because for La Toya, you throw me, I'll destroy ya
Just to keep your love excited I'll always enjoy ya

Such a wicked love
The love you treated, exactly what I needed
Such a wicked love, baby
The love you treated (you're exactly what I needed)
Don't waste my time, no, no, no
Oh, oh, baby

Your reputation got women scared of you
They say that you love 'em and leave 'em but I'm still under you
So don't you cheat on me 'cause if you slip
I won't say a word to you, so don't give me no lip, baby
The way you hold me I feel so lucky
My body tingles, sings jingles every time you touch me
I can't describe it, this love is something
And if I can't have your lovin' I don't want nothin'
You might also like
Such a wicked love
The love you treated, exactly what I needed
Such a wicked love, baby
The love you treated (you're exactly what I needed)
I need a wicked love
Ooh, yes indeed, you're exactly what I need
A wicked love, baby
The love you treated (you're exactly what I needed)

Shh! I think I hear Mr. Bass knockin'
Cool, we're gonna make the rules
This ain't no joke, knock on the door
Go for broke, ooh!
I got a thing for you
Such a wicked lover, I got a thing for you
Such a wicked lover, I got a thing for you
Such a wicked lover, I got a thing for you (yes, I do)
Such a wicked lover, I got a (scratch my back!)
(Wicked love)
I need a wicked kind of lover
(Wicked love)
And that's a fact, he's got to be exact
(Exactly what I needed)
Don't you go nowhere, oh, oh, baby
Such a wicked love, such a wicked love
Such a wicked love, such a wicked love, baby
Such a wicked love, such a wicked love
