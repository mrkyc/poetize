As sweet as apple pie
Get next to me
We'll reach the highest high
Why can't you see it could be ecstasy?
You and I
You and I
You and I
You and I
Turn on the lights
We'll party way down low
No need to fight
We'll make it nice and slow
Don't leave tonight
We're gonna let it go

I'm a woman
You're a man
Stay the night
We can do it
Make it right
