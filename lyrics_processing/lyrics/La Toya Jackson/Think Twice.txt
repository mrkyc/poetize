Better think, think think about it twice-
You better think about it twice
I don't know but before you hit the door
You better think about it twice
Oh yeah
Cause when you go
There's no coming back for more
Cause I not going to be that nice
Oh oh no
(Better, quit your lies)
Saying that I'm the only one
(Spending all your time)
With another have fun
(Told me that you care)
Don't you think it's time show it
Who is she?
(You better think, think, think, think twice)
Better think; think you better think twice-
Before you loose my love
(Better think; think think twice-)
The game you play
You know I can do the same but I'd just rather sacrifice
(Sacrifice for love)
See I'm the one; I'm a one man's woman
Don't need no two timing man-
Oh oh no
(Better quit your lies)
Saying that I'm the only one
(Spending all your time)
With another have fun
(Typical advice)
Now I'm the best you'll ever have
(Just take a look and see)
Ain't none quit as good as me-
(Think; think you better think twice-)
Think about it twice, before you loose my love
(Better, think think) Hey (think about it twice-)
You better think about it twice
(Think; think) Awe#151#babe (you better think twice-)
Before you loose--

Think before you leave boy

What's the matter, what's the matter, what's the matter with you?
What's the matter, what's the matter, what's the matter with you?
What's the matter, what's the matter, what's the matter with you?
