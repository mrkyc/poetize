I will admit that he's quite different
You may say he does crazy things, oh, oh, oh
He works hard for the money that he brings
Bad and Thriller, he's still the man in the mirror
Cause he's good to me and I know
Yes, I know that he loves me so
Cause he is my brother
Whenever he has to he's heavy
Cause he is my brother
(He's my brother)
He gives me emotions in plenty
When I'm alone and I need him
He's with me like lightning
Cause he is my brother
And I love, yes I love
And I love, yes I love him so
He-He-He's not bad!
(He's not bad!)
Out on stage he's electric
When he dances, it's just like magic
And you know when he starts to sing, oh, oh, oh
He is reaching the world with his music
Bad and Thriller, he's still the man in the mirror
Cause he's good to me and I know
Yes, I know that he loves me so
Cause he is my brother
Whenever he has to he's heavy
Cause he is my brother
(He's my brother)
He gives me emotions in plenty
When I'm alone and I need him
He's with me like lightning
Cause he is my brother
And I love, yes I love
And I love, yes I love him so
He's not bad!
(He-He-He's not bad!)
Cause he is my brother
Whenever he has to he's heavy
Cause he is my brother
(He's my brother)
He gives me emotions in plenty
When I'm alone and I need him
He's with me like lightning
Cause he is my brother
And I love, yes I love
And I love, yes I love him so
Cause he is my brother
Whenever he has to he's heavy
Cause he is my brother
(He's my brother)
