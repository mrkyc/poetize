Ooh watch it
Diamonds all on my watches
Ice so cold, they taking my soul
But they think that I'm heartless
Ooh stop it
When the whole gang know I'm popping
We get that top and drop it
Big bands in my pocket
Ooh watch it
Diamonds all on my watches
Ice so cold, they taking my soul
But they think that I'm heartless
Ooh stop it
When the whole gang know I'm popping
We get that top and drop it
Big bands in my pocket

Everybody get lit, I'm in the pit
Throwing this money, I'm running this bitch
I throw a 99 up with this shit
I'm with gang, yeah I'm with the click
Roll up a woodie, I'm smoking the spliff
Making this cash, I'm getting it quick
Zooming off fast and I'm getting rich
I know I'm not going broke again
I'm just a kid with a dream to get out
Once I'm at the top, I'm not going down
Moving in silence, but I be the sound
Fuck what you talking 'bout shutting your mouth
I got the bands on me
They said I wouldn't do this shit
But that shit news to me
Fuck them broke bitches talking shit
They do on me, shit
But I'ma get a bag right now (right now)
Smoke to the face like wow (like wow)
Whole crew smoking on loud (that's gas)
Too many m's in my account (my account)
Lil bitch can't shut me down (me down)
Bitch I run this town (this town)
Lil shit you won't burn that down (bitch)
