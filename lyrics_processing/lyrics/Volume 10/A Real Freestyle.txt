I always wanted to say fuck everybody
Fuck everybody and they mama i say
Here we go again and i do it the right way
All i gotta say is that i don't give a fuck
I don't give a fuck about nothing and nobody
Ah here we go again, uh, lodi dodi
I don't give a fuck about my momma but she love me
Oh my god, what am i saying
Here we go again and i'm not playing or waiting, for a sucka to shoot me
What the fuck is up i don't give a fuck about dying
Here we go again i don't give a fuck about dying
Oh shit, fuck this rap shit, fuck this rap shit, fuck my fucking daddy
Fuck everybody and they mama i say, fuck everybody and they mama i say

Coming from the west with a G on his chest
Smoking that indo, chronic not stress
Why would you ever wanna step to a killa, forever a nigga, growing bigger
God, get on my name, Smooth 7
Perfection as i'm using my tongue as a weapon
Precision, i'm cutting like a knife, slice enough
Take over the mic, let me bust
My cranium, sustains pain
I will drain, stepping to my flame
Burns, you are in, boy yearn
As i now take of concoctions, filaments (?) and elements
Breaking you down and this is how i'm telling shit
Turn your skeleton bones, to bone marrow, you narrow
High like a sparrow
Why would you try to step to a west coast nigga
I'm bigger with the trigger of a Glock
Blasting 16 non stop with 30 round clip in my pocket
Pocket i sag, rag colour doesn't matter your head will splatter
If you try to step to a G, nigga
You might also like
As i decide to smash the window of a benz, it's a motherfucking G ride
Should i get my pimps right to the eastside
Cuz i'm a black man, with a black pride
Trippin off,(?) they mothefucking simps
Trippin all they niggas, yeah they wimps
But they listen to a nigga as i bust
Cuz you know a nigga like the RKA kicks up dust
It's a must that i bust when i flow
People wanna know, yeah my sign's a virgo
Kicking it with the niggas that are real heavyweights
Cuz you know i rock the microphone, rhymes straight
(Damn man who got the motherfucking weed yo, i can go for a blunt)

Well if you're ever looking for blunts, come to see the Ganjah
I'm the man who gotcha
Whatever you want, maybe a dub, maybe a nickel, maybe a dime
Maybe a fucking quarter pound
I got whatever you need when we come in town
Right off the plane, come and get my number man
From somebody who got it at the bus stop
Somebody who know me from Hip-Hop
Somebody who know that nigga Ganjah K got everything
It seems you wasted on a triple beam
And everything is precise, everything is nice
And you don't even have to come and get it twice
Everytime you get it everything is coming right

Do you think they will believe this is a real freestyle? (8x)

Shut the fuck up, i know what i'm doing
I don't give a fuck, yo your whole career is ruined
If you fuck with me
Yo i'm Volume T
I don't give a fuck-a, i don't give a fuck-a (ooie)
Here we go again and what i gotta say
Is uh, This is the USA
This the land of the free and the brave
I'm gonna get motherfucking paid
So, if you wanna step on up, you can step
And if you wanna tire up, you can step
Now if you want teeth, knocked to the floor, then uh, c'mon, c'mon
My name is Volume Ten and i really don't care
Here we go again, The Best MC yeah i'm aware
Oh my god, give it up for my homies, Ganjah K, GanjahK
Oh my lord, i gots to give it up to Fat Jack, cuz them fat tracks ain't wack
I'd like to say what's up, oh what's up, oh what's up, my head is hurting
I'd like to say what's up to my little kid, hey, my little nephew he always run
Oh my god i'd like to say hey to the good life
And i'd like to say hey to uh, my wife
And i'd like to say what's up to...
