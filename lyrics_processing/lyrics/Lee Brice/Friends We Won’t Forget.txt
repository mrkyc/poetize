Well, I remember Friday nights
We were full of bull and natural light
Rock stars under the parking lot lights
Killing time in a little town
Window's tinted up, tailgate's down
Running our mouths, riding up and down
Just looking for a fight
We heard all our stories a thousand times
Somebody go on and tell them again
Ain't nobody going to mind

Here's to the good old boy
The guitars that made the noise
And all the girls that we annoyed
And them ones we kissed goodnight
To the trucks that drove us home
The secrets we never told
And all the talks on old dirt roads
That somehow changed our lives
Here's to the nights we don't remember
And the friends we won't forget

Well, I can still smell the crawfish stand
Diving head first in the morning drink
Standing in the lake watching water skis go by
Got a pretty girl sitting on my shoulders
And another pretty girl trying to push her over
My boys on the bank letting the horse shoes fly
Well, I can still see it now
All of us piling in our trucks and heading back into town

That somehow changed our lives
Here's to the nights we don't remember
And the friends we won't forget

Here's to the last calls when we didn't care
Holding our shots up in the air
A bunch of reckless boys
Man I swear, it's a wonder we survived
And to the trucks that drove us home
The secrets we never told
And all the talks on old dirt roads
That somehow changed our lives
Here's to the nights we don't remember
Yeah, here's to the nights we don't remember
