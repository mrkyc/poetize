In a purple neon glow in some downtown bar
In a whiskey shot or a cigarette smoke ring heart
Even down six feet in a dead tired sleep
I guess I'm destined to toss and turn

I see you even with my eyes closed, blindfolded
In a rain the world ain't seen since Noah
Every breath, every dream
You're here, you're there, you're in-between
Every sidewalk crack, every song I hear
Looking past Jesus on the dash, or in the rear view mirror
Every bit of you is burned like a tattoo on my soul
I see you even with my eyes closed

On a dust-filled lost road in some no-name town
A thousand miles from home, with me holding you now
Call it blessed, call it cursed, it heals and it hurts
I guess I'm destined to toss and turn

I see you even with my eyes closed, blindfolded
And a rain the world ain't seen since Noah
Every breath, every dream
You're here, you're there, you're in-between
Every sidewalk crack, every song I hear
Looking past Jesus on the dash, in the rear view mirror
Every bit of you is burned like a tattoo on my soul
I see you even with my eyes closed
I see you even with my eyes closed

I see you even with my eyes closed, blindfolded

Every breath, every dream
You're here, you're there, you're in-between
