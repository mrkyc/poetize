Yeah, it's like a song playing all night long
Stuck in my head
Things I should've done
Things I could've, should've said
Forgive and forgetting
Life's too short to let hate hang around

Sometimes I wonder, is this the last summer
I go fishing with my daddy
In 20 years from now, if I'm still here
Will my beautiful wife still have me?
These are the voices, won't leave me alone
Questions I can't put down

What keeps you up at night?
What makes your heartbeat wild?
What weighs on your mind, leaves you paralyzed?
What keeps you up at night?
Alright

See I believe in God, with all my heart
Sometimes I doubt and wonder
And I know that'd break my mamma's heart
And that weighs on me like thunder
Are these the best days of my life?
And when tomorrow comes
Will the skies open up, and blow my mind?

What makes your heartbeat wild?
What weighs on your mind, leaves you paralyzed?
What keeps you up at night?

What makes you take a stand?
Want to get up and dance?
What makes you laugh, you cry?
Raise your hands to the sky?
What keeps you up at night?

For all the times I've run, the things I've done
Have I really been forgiven
Do I really know the real meaning
Of this beautiful life I'm living?
Well hell yeah I do, it's my kids
And what they learn from me
Will they take the good, or take the bad?
