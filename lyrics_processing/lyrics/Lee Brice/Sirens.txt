I just remember her tan legs standing on the side of the road
Honda with the hood up covered in smoke
Thumb in the air with somewhere to go in a hurry
She didn't say a thing, she just jumped inside
Stuck a gun to my chest and told me to drive
I was scared but she was beautiful, like a movie
She kept looking back like something was coming
Said we ain't slowing down, ain't stopping for nothing
My truck was shaking, my blood was pumping
But she was laughing
I about hit the brakes when we came around the corner
A mile of blue lights, guns aimed and pointed
Whatever she had is what they wanted
And it's all a little fuzzy after that

All I remember is sirens
Blue lights flashing and driving
Dirt lane passing and flying
Tearing through the red lights
Blowing through the stop signs
All I remember is sirens
Ringing from the gun shots firing
One curve away from dying
Yeah, all I remember is...
Sirens

The man on the radio reported the chase
And all about the beauty
How she cleaned out the bank
She was armed and dangerous
And almost got away but they found her
She was cussing the choppers
They were swirling around
Reloading her revolver every couple-a-rounds
Shot off a couple shots
But they wouldn't back down

All I remember is sirens
Blue lights flashing and driving
Dirt lane passing and flying
Tearing through the red lights
Blowing through the stop signs
All I remember is sirens
Ringing from the gun shots firing
One curve away from dying
Really, all I remember is...
Sirens
Yeahhh sirens

We were all out to road and I knew she could tell
Because she leaned across my lap and buckled my belt
And kissed me on the cheek and said
"Thanks for the help, and hold on boy."
Well she yanked the wheel and I held my breath
We flipped so many times we should have been dead
And that's all I got
And I just woke up here and I said
All I remember is sirens
Blue lights flashing and driving
Dirt lane passing and flying
Tearing through the red lights
Blowing through the stop signs
All I remember is sirens
Blue lights flashing and smiling
One curve away from dying
All I remember is...
Sirens
Sirens...

And her blue eyes flashing
And those long legs standing on the side of the road
Her Honda with the hood up covered in smoke
