I don't smoke 'cause I never get high enough to get over you
(Alright baby, hey)

Mmm, a-have you ever been down, so low you can't see up
Something dragging you around, but you still ain't had enough
Oh, you know it's up there somewhere, but you still can't feel the sun
You're on the edge, a half a step away from coming undone

I don't drink, 'cause I know my mind and every time I do
I just think about what you're doing and who you're doing it to
I don't take no pills to kill the pain 'cause they ain't never told me the truth
I don't smoke 'cause I never get high enough to get over you

(Hey) I was the life of the party, yeah, you could count on me
But this a good time Charlie, ain't half the party I used to

I don't drink, 'cause I know my mind and every time I do
I just think about what you're doing and who you're doing it to
I don't take no pills to kill the pain 'cause they ain't never told me the truth
I don't smoke 'cause I never get high enough to get over you
(Oh no)
