Hey, it's Big D and Bubba, and and we're live on location. We want you to come on out because this is not just a party; it's a parking lot party with Lee Brice!

Johnny's firing up his Coleman grill
We've got 24 tall boys on the chill
Yeah, 14 of 'em's mine
A little Marshall Tucker on the radio
(Can't you see?)
You know we're just catchin' a little groove before the show
Yeah, ain't playing nothing slow

At the parking lot party
Tailgate buzz just sipping' on suds
Ain't never too early
To light one up, fill up your cup
'Cause there ain't no party like the pre-party
And after the party is the after-party
At the parking lot party

Well, the opening band is doin' sound-check
Man, they sound pretty good
Hell, I ain't even bought no tickets yet
Yeah, but that's alright we don't care
'Cause all the pretty girls are sitting' right here
Kicking back in the lawn chairs
See Lee Brice LiveGet tickets as low as $57You might also like
