The whole week on the beach, sunburns
Held aboard up on the floor of a cheap hotel
Give a rebel yell off the balcony (Heh)
Oh, we were proud to be from
The dirty south, y'all keep it down
But we turn it up and they kicked us out
We might have left but we didn't leave no doubt
What we were all about

Everybody knew we brought the party
We were always getting something started
Weren't worried 'bout the consequences
Yeah, we liked to run through the fences
Each town learned to love and hate us
I'm pretty sure they're still talking 'bout us
I can't tell you everything but I'll tell you one
They won't forget about us

All our friends
All the trouble we got in
And we'd all do it all again

Hey, y'all remember that one time it was overtime
Laid the heat on the quarterback
He dropped the ball, we ran it back
Then after that
We hot-wired a team bus, got her fired up
Drove it round bout half the night
Saw the blue lights, they let us go
'Cause we brought the trophy home, yeah

They won't forget about us, no they won't
