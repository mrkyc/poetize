Them Girls (Feat. Lil Kim)
Yeah, it's another Darkchild Production
And my homie Se7en, let's go

I like them girls that's hard to get
I like them girls, shot calling a whip
I like them girls (girls), I like them girls (girls)
I like them girls, that'll love to trip
Trying to spend 24 at Se7en's crib
(Girls, girls, girls, girls)
(Girls I do adore)

Let me holla at ya girl
Every time I turn around
The girls been lookin' at me
I see a couple of em in the crowd
And I can tell that they wanna be
Be the one that'll make me settle down
Take my number out the game
Until I find that, imma fall back
I'll tell you what I'm looking for

Trying make you my accessory (yeah)
All girls are necessary (yeah)
Like Will I'm Legend, feel me
You can Google me, baby
Been around the world, Asia to Philly (oh yeah)
Cross the border they all look good to me
I need a few more, so call the G4
Tell them that we only got room for seven more
You might also like
I like them girls that's hard to get
I like them girls, shot calling the whip
I like them girls (girls), I like them girls (girls)
I like them girls, that'll love to trip
Trying to spend 24 at Se7en's crib
(Girls, girls, girls, girls)
(Girls I do adore)

They call me ice, I love that green
Diamonds, all flavors, like a Diary Queen
Its baller affair, Gabbana girl is there
Looking like Americas Next Top Billionaire
I like the fly boy type
Like spend money all night
First class flight straight to paradise,Oh
Somewhere out in the Caribbeans
Push whips that's European, Tiptronic
Manolo Blahnik Crocodile is what I be in
Party all night, wake up in the PM
In my Murcielago, pretty lil bee
I like those boys naming cars after me or their Yacht in the Bikinis
From bathing in the sea, want to touch my body
Like my name was MC
Wish you had this honey, girl to goddess
Boys competing for me with their Yen may the best male win
I like them girls that's hard to get
I like them girls, shot calling the whip (hey!)
I like them girls (girls), I like them girls (girls)
I like them girls, that'll love to trip
Trying to spend 24 at Se7en's crib
(Girls, girls, girls, girls)
(Girls I do adore)

When you see me in the club (holla at ya boy)
Post it up getting love (holla at ya boy)
It don't matter where you come from babe
Im kinda like MJ
I like them black or white (wh-white)
When you see me on tour (holla at ya boy)
It's a dame not a sport (holla at ya boy)
I ain't ever turn down a fly girl that was tryna get something
I ain't about to pick today to start running

I like them girls that's hard to get (I like them girls)
I like them girls, shot calling the whip (can we ride babe)
I like them girls (girls), I like them girls (girls)
I like them girls, that'll love to trip (can you feel me baby)
Trying to spend 24 at Se7en's crib (yeahhhh)
