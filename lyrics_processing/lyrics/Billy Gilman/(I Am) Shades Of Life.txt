I am young, I am old, I am each age that has been
I am scrawny, I am well fed, I am starving for attention
I am famous, I am cryptic, I am hardly worth the mention
I am short, I am height, I am any frame or stature
I am smart, I am challenged, I am striving for a future
The color of sky is blues and grays
The color of the earth is greens and browns
The color of hope is rainbows and purple
And the color of peace is people together
(Shades of life)
People together
(Shades of life)
I am able, I am weak, I am some strength, I am none
I am being, I am thought, I am all things said and done
I am born, I am died, I am dust of humble roots
I am grace, I am pain, I am labor of willed fruits
I am slave, I am free, I am bonded to my life
I am rich, I am poor, I am wealth amid strive
The color of sky is blues and grays
The color of the earth is greens and browns
The color of hope is rainbows and purple
And the color of peace is people together
(Shades of life)
People together
(Shades of life)
You might also likeI am shallow, I am glory, I am hiding from my shame
I am hero, I am loser, I am yearning for a name
I am empty, I am proud, I am seeking my tomorrow
I am growing, I am fading, I am hope amid the sorrow
I am certain, I am doubtful, I am desperate for solutions
I am leader, I am student, I am fate and evolutions
I am spirit, I am voice, I am memory not recalled
I am chance, I am cause, I am effort blocked and walled
I am him, I am her, I am reason without rhymes
I am past, I am hearing, I am present in all times
I am many, I am no one, I am season by each being
I am me, I am you, I am all souls now decreeing
The color of sky is blues and grays
