Suitcase packed with all his things
Car pulls up, the doorbell rings
He don't wanna go
He thought he'd found his home
But with circumstances he can't change
Waves goodbye as they pull away
From the life he's known
For the last seven months or so

She said we found a man who looks like you
Who cried and said he never knew
About the boy in pictures that we showed him
A rambler in his younger days
He knew he'd made a few mistakes
But he swore he would have been there had he known it
Son, we think we found your dad in Oklahoma

A million thoughts race through his mind
What's his name? What's he like?
And will he be anything like the man in his dreams?
She could see the questions in his eyes
Whispered, don't be scared, my child
I will let you know what we know
You might also like
About the man we found, he looks like you
Who cried and said he never knew
About the boy in pictures that we showed him
A rambler in his younger days
He knew he'd made a few mistakes
But he swore he would have been there had he known it
You always said that this was something that you wanted
Son, it's time to meet your dad in Oklahoma

One last turn, he held his breath
Till they reached the fifth house on the left
And all at once the tears came rolling in
And as they pulled into the drive
A man was waiting there outside
He wiped the worry from his eyes
Smiled and took his hand
And he said

I'm the man who looks like you
Who cried because I never knew
About the boy in pictures that they showed me
A rambler in my younger days
I knew I made a few mistakes
But I swear I would have been there had I known it
Never again will you ever be alone
