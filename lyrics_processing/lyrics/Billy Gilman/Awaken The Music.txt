In the sweet lullaby of my dreams
Who would sing me a song made in heaven
That would awaken the music in me
You gave my life such meaning
Shined light upon my soul
And you were always there to hold
When I come to the end of tomorrows
And I look back on all of my days
I imagine I'm here beside you
And we're talking our usual way
And we will dance
We will sing
Still amazed by everything
And we will dance
And we will sing
We're still amazed by everything
The simple joys that life can bring
The songs you taught me how to sing
And yes we will sing them again
In my heart they'll never end
When I'm lost I pray that I can find you
When the darkness seems to hide the light
When I'm up I know I'm flying with you
All the things I love are all because of you
Because of you
You might also likeYou were always the one with the courage
Taught me all that I needed to know
When I needed a shoulder to cry on
You would reach out a hand I could hold
Your strength and all your kindness
Became a part of me
And I would always try to be
I'll be the me you hoped I'd always be
We will dance
We will sing
Still amazed by everything
And we will dance
And we will sing
We're still amazed by everything
The simple joys that life can bring
The songs you taught me how to sing
And yes we will sing them again
In my heart they'll never end
In your eyes I always see my future
In your smile I see the reason for my ways
In your voice I know the truth has meaning
When you sing to me I hear your heart speak to me
There was always the voice of an angel
In the sweet lullaby of my dreams
Who would sing me a song made in heaven
That would awaken the music in me
(awaken the music, awaken the music)
