You don't, you won't, no way, I say
You didn't, you doesn't, you isn't, you wasn't
You wouldn't, you couldn't you, oughtn't, you shouldn't
Love no body but me
You're mine, not his, you are, you is
I mean it, I seen it, I did it, I done it
I do, you knew, you can't, you shant
Love no body but me
That's all, that's it
I ain't jealous of the fellas that you hang around with
Don't pay, No mind
And I'm telling you one more time
You don't, you won't, no way, I say
You didn't, you doesn't, you isn't, you wasn't
You wouldn't, you couldn't, you oughtn't, you shouldn't
Love no body but me
That's All, That's right
I ain't waiting, ain't faking, no maybes, no mights
My heart, don't lie
And I'm telling you one more time
You might also likeYou don't, you won't, no way, I say

You don't, you won't, no way, I say
You didn't, you doesn't, you isn't, you wasn't

Love no body but me
Love nobody but me
