It was more than I could do to try to get it through
That I needed his affection
He'd just sit around at home with his buddies on the phone
And we never made connections
Now I'm gonna take a break from all this shake-and-bake
Someone else can take it over
There ain't no better time for startin' over
This is a good goodbye
I ain't feelin' guilty 'cause I done the right thing
It's a good goodbye
I got my radio up and I'm startin' to sing
I'm drivin' this car just as fast as I can
Runnin' with the wind startin' all over agin
I ain't thinkin' twice 'bout that no account man
It's a good good good goodbye
Somewhere between the news and Sunday sports reviews
He'll find that I am missin'
And he'll think that I've gone to Marge's hair salon
But this time -- I'm goin' fishin'
And somewhere in the night when I don't turn out the light
He's gonna see the truth
He's gonna know that we are through
