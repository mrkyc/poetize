I called you late last night
Or did the sleep get in your eyes
Did it blind me from your sight
Or was she lying with you
Was it hard for you to speak
And did you tell her, she was sleeping
In the bed you made for me
And did you tell her she was sleeping
In the bed you made for me
Did she like my satin sheets
And did you sing her to sleep
And my pillow that she slept on
Did it bring her sweet dreams
Did you tell her she was sleeping
In the bed you made for me
The pillow that you made for me
It was soft with feather down
And the headboard, it came from an old house
That was about to be torn down
And the songs you always sang to me
Oh--wow to fall asleep
Did they sound the same to her
In the bed you made for me

And my pillow that she slept on
Did it bring her sweet dreams
Did you tell her she was sleeping
In the bed you made for me
Now you can take my old pillow
And throw it out the door
You can buy another bed
You can find another headboard
Cause I ain't gonna lie beneath
Those satin sheets you tore
The bed you made for me
It isn't mine anymore
And did you tell her she was sleeping
In the bed you made for me
Did she like my satin sheets
And did you sing her to sleep
And my pillow that she slept on
Did it bring her sweet dreams
Did you tell her she was sleeping
In the bed you made for me
And did you tell her she was sleepin'
