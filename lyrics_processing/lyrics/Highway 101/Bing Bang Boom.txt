Gather around me and lend an ear
'Cause I got something you ought to hear
I'm telling you that you ought to fear
A certain kind of love

Now it can strike in the day or night
And just as quick as a rattler's bite
You've got a case of love at first sight
And it's what you're dyin' of

It's just bing bang boom, one two three
You're feeling normal as you can be
And then bing bang boom, lickety split
It doesn't come on bit by bit
It gets instantly in full swing
And it's bing bang boom

Now I was footloose and fancy free
I had respect, I had dignity
Then this thing got a hold of me
And it still will not let go
You might also like
I walked in and my heartbeat jumped
My hair stood up and my skin goosebumped
My mind went blank and my IQ slumped
And my judgment hit the road

It was bing bang boom, one two three
I fell the second he looked at me
It was bing bang boom, lickety split
It didn't come on bit by bit
It was instantly in full swing
It was bing bang boom

And now my obligations slide
I do not even care
And I spend all my waking hours
Walking on thin air

So friends you'd best beware

'Cause that's exactly how you'll behave
If you get hit with this tidal wave
And you won't even have time to save
Your sinking sanity
It's just bing bang boom, one two three
You're feeling normal as you can be
And then bing bang boom, lickety split
It doesn't come on bit by bit
It gets instantly in full swing
And it's bing bang boom
Bing bang boom
Bing bang boom
Bing bang boom

It gets instantly in full swing
