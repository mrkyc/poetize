This is Afrika Bambaataa's party
Where all the brothers and sisters will be
Gettin' down to the sound of Rich
He's in the mix
And all the Africans will hear me sayin'
Along wit' the culture I'm displayin'
The beat is raw the rhyme is superb
In Grandpa's party I will be heard
Take off your clothes if you choose to
Dance barefooted like we used to
Like the mother the party is hot
Get deep roots and 'em what ya got
Nobody's watching they doin' their own thing
So get wit' it and let ya body swing
Left to right then swing in the centre
Move ya hips the way that ya meant ta

Pick a day pick a time pick a session
Party now then go home wit' the lesson
I be me you be you an be nice
As Baby Bam said we high on life
Hear the message in the bongos
Let body feel the way the song goes
Adrenaline's poppin' you're sopping with sweat
Your eyeliner's running that you should forget
Take a trip to the back of ya mind
The true party will be easier to find
Take the time to know who you are
Then join the party, right Grandpa

Enter the venue your minds need cleaning
No matter how dope life be seeming
Give up the goddamn screaming
Clean up the clean up the mess
Nature will take care of all the rest
To groove with the party, one condition
Flow along wit' the mission
