Hello and hallelujah for the wheel of fortune
Thank God they got a selection of men they can auction
Be him Black, be him white
Rude, stank, or polite
They got catalogues, you know
Honey dips hold tight
Form a line, form a line behind me
You know what I'm sayin'?
I been waiting since last year child, I'm not playin'
I'ma find myself somebody if it takes all week
Find me a piece of butt and no longer will I seek

To find the perfect brother (Spin the wheel of fortune)
To find the perfect brother (Spin the wheel of fortune)
To find the perfect brother (Spin the wheel of fortune)
To find the perfect brother (Spin the wheel of fortune)

First off I got a drug dealer, a heart stealer
Bucks hangin' out his butt, to him it was no big deal
Bought me this, bought me that
Tried to spread me, forget that
My name is not Country Crock
You big Spock looking muskrat
Having money don't make you God
Find yourself a hole for you to stick your rod
No, no, no, we can't be lovers
No, no, no, we can't be friends
Only one thing left to do
Have to spin again

The second was a bum crumb, nothing having mug
Personality okay, but face looking like a pug
He said, "Come over to my house and watch movies"
I said, "Who me? So that you can do me?"
Not that I would but at least the dealer would have paid
You don't wanna spend no money and you wanna get laid
Back off, here's a dollar and the deal
Treat yourself to White Castle's
For me it's back to the wheel

The third was a white collar working in Manhattan
When he walked, when he talked
When he ate there was a pattern
He tried to change the way I dressed and I talked
Showing me the difference in the different types of forks
I said, "Mr. Connoisseur, you can stuff it"
You gotta love me for me or love nothin'
Take your forks and shove 'em all where the sun don't shine
And I'm back to spin the wheel just one more time
To find the perfect brother (Spin the wheel of fortune)
To find the perfect brother (Spin the wheel of fortune)

The final was a cop from up the block
The type that catches kids from picking next door neighbor's locks
He liked to keep tabs, don't you know he was a psycho?
He also liked to hit, I said, "Well now, it's time that I go"
I said, "Don't touch me, you might lose your nuts
I'll stick 'em in a pickle jar and wouldn't give a butt
Keep your hands to yourself if you know what I'm sayin'
There's a knife in my bag, brother, man, I'm not playin', ya know"

To find the perfect brother (Spin the wheel of fortune)

There you go, there you have it, wheel of fortune didn't work
Instead of meetin' gentlemen I met a bunch of jerks
One with too much money, the other not a cent
One too snobby and the other had no sense
I guess for Monie Love it's right back to the drawing board
How long will it be before I actually score?
I gotta find somebody to unleash all this affection
I know what I'ma do, I think I'll try the Love Connection
To find the perfect brother (Try the Love Connection)
To find the perfect brother (Try the Love Connection)

Huh, huh, huh, huh, two, three
Huh, huh, huh, huh, two, three
Huh, huh, two, three
Huh, huh, two, three (Spin the wheel of fortune)
Huh, huh, two three (Spin the wheel of fortune)
Huh, two, three
Form a line, form a line behind me (Try the Love Connection)
You know what I'm sayin'?
Form a line, form a line behind me (Spin the wheel of fortune)
You know what I'm sayin'?
Form a line, form a line, form a line, form a line (Try the Love Connection)
