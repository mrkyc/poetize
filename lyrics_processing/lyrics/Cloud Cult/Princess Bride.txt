 But first things first, to the death!
 No! To the pain!
 I don't think I'm quite familiar with that phrase
 I'll explain. And I'll use small words so that you'll be sure to understand, you warthog faced buffoon
 That may be the first time in my life a man has dared insult me!
 It won't be the last. To the pain means the first thing you'll lose is your feet below the ankles. Then your hands at the wrist. Next your nose
 And then my tongue I suppose, I killed you too quickly the last time, a mistake I don't mean to duplicate tonight!
 I wasn't finished! The next thing you lose will be your left eye followed by your right
 And then my ears I understand, let's get on with it!
 Wrong! Your ears you keep and I'll tell you why: So that every shriek of every child that's seen your hideousness will be yours to cherish. Every babe that weeps at your approach. Every woman who cries out, "Dear God, what is that thing?" will echo in your perfect ears. That is what to the pain means. It means I leave you in anguish. Wallowing in freakish misery forever
