We are your conscience
We thought we'd tell you
You've been sleepwalking
Through most of your days
Your eyes are open
Your body's moving
Your lips are speaking
But you're far from awake
Where is your passion?
Where is your wonder?
Where is your thankfulness?
You put them all away

Time's come to get up
Before you break down
I know you're on it
Time's come to get up
Before you break down
I know you're on it
Time's come to get up
Before you break down
I know you're on it
Time's come to get up
Before you break down
I know you're on it
Time's come to get up
Before you break down
I know you're on it
Time's come to get up
Before you break down
I know you're on it

Where is your kid side?
Where is your joyfulness?
Where is your empathy?
Fast asleep
Where went your moments?
Where went your presence?
Where went your purpose?
Fast asleep
Where is your kid side?
Where is your joyfulness?
Where is your empathy?
Fast asleep
Where went your moments?
Where went your presence?
Where went your purpose?
Fast asleep
