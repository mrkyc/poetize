What did he say to make you feel so bad?
Well I guarantee that I'd never do nothing like that, no
So what you got planned on Friday night?
Could put your red dress on or stay home and cry
I guarantee I got a quick fix that you might like, that's right
Well you might find love
Or maybe just a good time
But you won't know baby till you get out the house
Get a little drinky drink and turn it up loud
Tequila, a little salt, a little lime
They say you can't a drown a broken heart but guess what
You can damn sure try
Don't you wanna try, babe?
Come on, give it a shot, give it a dance
I ain't asking a lot, just give me a chance
I'm gonna right his wrong right where I stand
I'ma hit you with a kiss, spinning like a hurricane
Tell me baby what do ya say?
Well you might find love
Or maybe just a good time
But you won't know baby till you get out the house
Get a little drinky drink and turn it up loud
Tequila, a little salt, a little lime
They say you can't a drown a broken heart but guess what
You can damn sure try
Don't you wanna try, babe?
Turn the lights down low, boots on the floor
If you want a little more I got money in my pocket
Go on, let yourself go, feel the banjo
Well you might find love
Or maybe just a good time
But you won't know baby till you get out the house
Get a little drinky drink and turn it up loud
Tequila, a little salt, a little lime
They say you can't a drown a broken heart but guess what
You can damn sure try
