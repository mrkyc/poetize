The sky is starlit and the time is right
Still you're telling me you have to go
Before you leave there's
Something you should know
Yeah, something you should know baby
I've seen you smiling in the summer sun
I've seen your long hair flying when you run
I've made my mind up that it's meant to be
Someday baby you'll accomp'ny me
Someday baby you'll accomp'ny me
Where the rivers meet the sound and sea
You're high above me now
You're wild and free
Oh yeah, someday baby you accomp'ny me
Someday baby you'll accomp'ny me
Ooo-ooo
Some people say that love's a losing game
You start with fire but you lose the flame
The ashes smolder but the wants so gone
You end up cold and lonely on your own
I'll take the chances babe, I'll risk it all
To win your love or I'll take the fall
I've made my mind up girl it's meant to be
Someday baby you'll accomp'ny me, yeah

A gypsy wind is blowing warm tonight
The sky is starlit and the time is right
But still you're telling me you have to go
Before you leave there's
Something you should know

Where the rivers meet the sound and sea
I feel it in my soul it's meant to be, oh
