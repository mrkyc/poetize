Well, I guarantee I'd never do nothing like that, no
So, what you got planned on Friday night?
Could put your red dress on or stay home and cry
I guarantee I got a quick fix that you might like, that's right
Well, you might find love
Or maybe just a good time
But you won't know baby 'til you get out the house
Get a little drinky drink and turn it up loud
Tequila, a little salt, a little lime
They say you can't drown a broken heart, but guess what?
(Guess what?)
You can damn sure try
I said, don't you wanna try, babe?
Don't you wanna try?
Come on, give it a shot, give it a dance
I ain't asking a lot, just give me a chance

I'ma hit you with a kiss, spinning like a hurricane
Tell me baby, what do ya say?
Well, you might find love
Or maybe just a good time
But you won't know baby 'til you get out the house
Get a little drinky drink and turn it up loud
Tequila, a little salt, a little lime
They say you can't drown a broken heart, but guess what?
(Guess what?)
You can damn sure try
Don't you wanna try, babe?

Well, you might find love
