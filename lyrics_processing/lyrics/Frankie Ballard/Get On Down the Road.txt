Well I kinda took my uncle's cadillac
My mind was made and my bags were packed
And that gps was set for Tennessee
No books to keep, no business suit, no weeds will grow beneath these boots, won't nobody here be missin me
Well I can't keep hangin round this continental breakfast town, I've done all the damage I can do
So I better get on down the road
As fast as I can go
Gonna let these big wheels roll
And crank up that radio, pull my hat down low, and get on down the road
Yeah there's places that I wanna see and people that I need to meet
And there's parties I should be tendin to
So if I find me a pretty girl who rings my bell and rocks my world I'll say "baby, I'm just passin through"
Well I don't like to see em cry
I don't like to say goodbye, so there ain't much left for me to do
So I better get on down the road
As fast as I can go
Gonna let these big wheels roll
And crank up that radio, pull my hat down low, and get on down the road
Yeah I've always had the gift you see
Of knowin when it's time to leave
So let me leave you with this
