Between a preppy and a hippy
At a third row country concert
You got your hands up singing
And your short skirt swinging
Yeah, you even bought a t-shirt
You be churching with your mama
On Sunday morning
Trying to shake off Saturday night
Well you're a little straight A
And a little cray cray
Girl you sound like
You're just my type, that's right
I like a little bit of bad girl
And I like a little bit of sweet
And I like a little
Boom boom in a room
And a little chicken pecking
On a six string
And I like a little bit of whiskey
And I don't mind a little bit of smoke
A little truck shock squeaking
A little good book preaching
Yeah I like a little bit of both
I like a little bit of both
You might also likeA little bit of both
Girl you keep it so fresh
You keep it so dope
You like Simba, really
In a blender
With the body of a stripper
And a 100 proof kicker
I like a little bit of both
You got a Route 44
Asberry, Cherry Coke
But you spike it
With a little bit of Seagrams
And them low cut Levi's
Surprise, surprise
There's a little black lace
Beneath 'em
You're a naughty little wine
In a hip hop line
You're a William Shakespeare sonnet
Jerry, Jeff, JAY Z
You got the middle of a backseat
Baby with your nickname on it
Yeah, I like a little bit of bad girl
And I like a little bit of sweet
And I like a little
Boom boom in a room
And a little chicken pecking
On a six string
And I like a little bit of whiskey
And I don't mind a little bit of smoke
A little truck shock squeaking
A little good book preaching
I like a little bit of both
I like a little bit of both
A little bit of both
Girl you keep it so fresh
You keep it so dope
You like Simba, really
In a blender
With the body of a stripper
And a 100 proof kicker
Yeah, I like a little bit of bad girl
And I like a little bit of sweet
And I like a little
Boom boom in a room
And a little chicken pecking
On a six string, baby
And I like a little bit of whiskey
And I don't mind a little bit of smoke
A little truck shock squeaking
A little good book preaching
I like a little bit of both
I like a little bit of both
A little bit of both
Girl you keep it so fresh
You keep it so dope
You like Simba, really
In a blender
With the body of a stripper
And a 100 proof kicker
I like a little bit of both
Yeah, I like a little bit of both
