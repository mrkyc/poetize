I'm wondering if you need any help
Holding down a couple of barstools
Yeah, and I, I hope you don't mind if
I, I put another drink there beside
The one that you're
Staring a hole through
Now if you wanna be alone
Well girl, you can just say so
But if you got a pissed off
I'll help you cuss it
Just want some small talk
Girl, let's discuss it
If you're feeling lonely
You're not the only one
Walking that line, girl
If you wanna get lost
Girl, I'm driving
Or just get your buzz on
Baby, I'm buying
If you're just wastin time, girl
If you don't mind, girl
Waste some of mine, girl
You might also likeWell I, can tell by
That smile you smile
That this might take
A little while
To figure out just what
A girl like you
Is doing in a
Place like this
But I'm down with
Whatever it is
But if you got a pissed off
I'll help you cuss it
Just want some small talk
Girl, let's discuss it
If you're feeling lonely
You're not the only one
Walking that line, girl
If you wanna get lost
Girl, I'm driving
Or just get your buzz on
Baby, I'm buying
If you're just wastin time, girl
If you don't mind, girl
Waste some of mine, girl
Yeah, if you got a heartache
Join the club girl
But another Bicardi
Ain't enough girl
Sometimes you gotta take a chance
Just say yes to a dance
But if you got a pissed off
I'll help you cuss it
Just want some small talk
Girl, let's discuss it
If you're feeling lonely
You're not the only one
Walking that line, girl
If you wanna get lost
Girl, I'm driving
Or just want your buzz on
Baby, I'm buying
If you're just wasting time, girl
If you don't mind, girl
Waste some of mine, girl
If you're just wasting time
If you don't mind
Waste some of mine, girl
