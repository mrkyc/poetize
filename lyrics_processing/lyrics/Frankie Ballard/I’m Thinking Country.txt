But it's been a couple weeks since I walked on something but concrete
This big city's getting to me, I'm having hillbilly dreams
I'm hearing Haggard songs, it's been too long
I'm thinking country, I'm talking hammer down
I mean one arm out the window like Smokey and the Bandit
Kind of good times, it's what I got on my mind
Let's go to Luckenbach, it's what I need
I can't help it, I'm just thinking country
Cane pole stuck in the sand
That's the kind of mood that I'm in
I can't focus on anything else but getting us gone
I got this crazy desire to go out and sit by a fire
Maybe light cheap cigars, Willy on guitar
I'm thinking country, I'm talking hammer down
I mean one arm out the window like Smokey and the Bandit
Kind of good times, it's what I got on my mind
Let's go to Luckenbach, it's what I need
I can't help it, I'm just thinking country
Yeah, I'm thinking country
So just go with me baby, come on, help me concentrate
I know we're sitting downtown but I'm in some other
You know, I'm in some other place
You might also likeI'm thinking country, I'm talking hammer down
I mean one arm out the window like Smokey and the Bandit
Kind of good times, it's what I got on my mind
Let's go to Luckenbach, it's what I need
I can't help it, I'm just thinking country
Yes, I'm thinking country
Oh, it's been a long time, been a long time gone
Been a long time since I've been home
Been a long time, been a long time gone
Been a long time since I've been home
Yeah I'm thinking country, I'm thinking country, yeah
Oh, been a long time, been a long time gone
Been a long time since I've been home
Been a long time, been a long time gone
Been a long time since I've been home
Yeah I'm thinking country, I'm thinking country
