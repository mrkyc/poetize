Bart? Bart! Bart!
Bart!
I didn't do it, nobody saw me do it, you can't prove anything

Yo, hey, what's happening, dude?
I'm a guy with a rep for bein' rude
Terrorizin' people wherever I go
It's not intentional, just keepin' the flow
Fixin' test scores to get the best scores
Droppin' banana peels all over the floor
I'm the kid that made delinquency an art
Last name Simpson, first name Bart
I'm here today to introduce the next phase
The next step in the big Bart craze
I got a dance, real easy to do
I learned it with no rhythm and so can you, ooh
So move your body, if you got the notion
Front to back in a rock-like motion
Now that you got it, if you think you can
Do it to the music, that's the Bartman

Everybody, if you can, do the Bartman (Woah)
Shake your body, turn it out if you're bad, man (Check it out, man)
Front to back, to the side, yes, you can-can (Bartman)
Everybody in the house, do the Bartman (Uh-huh)
Everybody, if you can, do the Bartman
Shake your body, turn it out if you're bad, man (Woah, mama)
Front to back, to the side, yes, you can-can
Everybody in the house, do the Bartman

It wasn't long ago, just a couple of weeks
I got in trouble, yeah, pretty deep
Homer was yellin' (Bart!) Mom was, too
Because I put mothballs in the beef stew
Punishment time, in the air lurks gloom
Sittin' by myself, confined to my room
When all else fails, nothin' else left to do
I turn on the music, so I can feel the groove

Move your body, if you got the notion (Woah, I'm feeling the groove now, baby)
Front to back in a rock-like motion (Bring it back, woah)
Move your hips from side to side now (Do the Bartman)
Don't ya slip, let your feet glide now (Woah, Lisa, ha)
If you've got the groove, you gotta use it (Hahaha)
Rock rhythm in time with the music (Hahaha, check it out, man)
You just might start a chain reaction
If you can do the Bart, you're bad like Michael Jackson

Everybody, if you can, do the Bartman (Oh yeah)
Shake your body, turn it out if you're bad, man (Shake your body)
Front to back, to the side, yes, you can-can
Everybody in the house, do the Bartman (Yeah, do the Bartman)

Pick your feet up off the floor, let 'em glide
(Do the Bartman) Do the Bartman
She can do it, he can do it, so can I
(Do the Bartman) Do the Bartman
Now here's a dance beat that you can't deny

Turn it down! Will you stop that infernal racket?
Do the Bartman!
Oh, my ears
Lisa, put that saxophone away!
You can't touch this
I didn't do it, nobody saw me do it, you can't prove anything

Now I'm in the house feelin' good to be home
'Til Lisa starts blowin' that damn saxophone
And if it was mine, you know they'd take it away
But still, I'm feelin' good, so that's okay
I'm up in my room, just a-singin' a song
Listen to the kick drum kickin' along
Yeah, Lisa likes jazz, she's her number one fan
But I know I'm bad, 'cause I do the Bartman
Everybody, if you can, do the Bartman (Hey, everybody)
Shake your body, turn it out if you're bad, man (Need I remind you)
Front to back, to the side, yes, you can-can (Uh, I am the Bartman)
Everybody in the house, do the Bartman (Uh, check it out)

(Do the Bartman) Do the Bartman
Everybody back and forth, from side to side
(Do the Bartman) Do the Bartman
She can do it, he can do it, so can I

Move your body, if you got the notion
Front to back in a rock-like motion (Move it, swing it)
Move your hips from side to side now
Don't ya slip, let your feet glide now
If you've got the groove, you gotta use it
Rock rhythm in time with the music
You just might start a chain reaction
Hahaha, I'm the Bartman
