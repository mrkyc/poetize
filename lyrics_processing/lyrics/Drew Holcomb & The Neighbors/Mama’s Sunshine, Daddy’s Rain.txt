You got your mama's sunshine, you got your daddy's rain
You're like a piece of heaven in a hurricane
And it's bubbling over like a sweet champagne
You got your mama's sunshine, you got your daddy's rain

All day long, right or wrong, you question everything
Why the grass is green, can I stay up late, and why do the bluebirds sing
Sometimes you cry, your big blue eyes, for no discernible reason
Your point of view it comes and goes, like the changing of the seasons

You got your mama's sunshine, you got your daddy's rain
You're like a piece of heaven in a hurricane
And it's bubbling over like a sweet champagne
You got your mama's sunshine, you got your daddy's rain

You act just like your father, yeah, you laugh at your own jokes
You're pleased with your opinions, girl, you want the world to know
We don't need no Mona Lisa, don't need Dali or Chagall
You're like a miniature Picasso with your markers on the wall

You got your mama's sunshine, you got your daddy's rain
You're like a piece of heaven in a hurricane
And it's bubbling over like a sweet champagne
You got your mama's sunshine, you got your daddy's rain
You might also like
The things you say, the worlds you make, your heart I love to see
You've got a leaf on every single branch of our family tree
When you're all grown up, no longer a pup, going out into the great unknown
You'll find that little piece of you that you can call your own

You got your mama's sunshine, you got your daddy's rain
You're like a piece of heaven in a hurricane
And it's bubbling over like a sweet champagne
You got your mama's sunshine, you got your daddy's rain
