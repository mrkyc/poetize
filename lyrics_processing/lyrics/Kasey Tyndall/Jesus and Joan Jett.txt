Leather jacket, leather bible
I graduated an outcast from high school
Sweet as a Sunday and fire on the throttle
I'm just spreading the gospel
I'm a prayer and I'm a sinner
I'll bless your heart or flip you the finger
I'll sip the wine or shoot down the liquor
'Cause I love rock n roll

You can find me on the back pew after the front row
Got a bad reputation but I keep it on the down-low
Got some black in my halo
A little misunderstood 'cause they don't know
Washed in the water and cleansed in the whiskey
Might even like me once you get me
Head bangin', cross hangin' down from my neck
I roll with Jesus and rock with Joan Jett, hey

All my exes, they tried to change me
They couldn't hang so they called me crazy
I ain't your typical sweet southern daisy
Beneath all this wild is a lady
You might also like
You can find me on the back pew after the front row
Got a bad reputation but I keep it on the down-low
Got some black in my halo
A little misunderstood 'cause they don't know
Washed in the water and cleansed in the whiskey
Might even like me once you get me
Head bangin', cross hangin' down from my neck
I roll with Jesus and rock with Joan Jett, hey

Saturday raise up a drink and a hell yeah
Can I get a hell yeah? (Hell yeah)
Sunday raise up my hands and an amen
Yeah, can I get an amen? (Amen)

You can find me on the back pew after the front row
Got a bad reputation but I keep it on the down-low
I got some black in my halo
A little misunderstood 'cause they don't know
Washed in the water and cleansed in the whiskey
Might even like me once you get me
Head bangin', cross hangin' down from my neck
I roll with Jesus and rock with Joan Jett, hey
I roll with Jesus
And rock with Joan Jett
