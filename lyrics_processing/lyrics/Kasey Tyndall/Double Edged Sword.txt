Yeah, your love rides high on a high, high horse
Cuts real deep like a double-edged sword

One more "hang on one more day"
One more promise that you'll break
Yeah, I'm a lone when we're together
So maybe it won't matter whether
I take off or if I stay

All you do is pull me in and drag me down
Open up, then shut me out
I'm all gassed up, pedal down on a dead-end road
I'm damned if I do, damned if I don't
I think you'll change, I know you won't
Holdin' on too tight to the wrong end of a rose
Yeah, your love rides high on a high, high horse
And it cuts real deep like a double-edged sword

I would run, but I can't move
And losing's all that's left to do
The more I try to make it work
The more the leaving's gonna hurt
That's the bitter, cold, hard truth

All you do is pull me in and drag me down
Open up, then shut me out
I'm all gassed up, pedal down on a dead-end road
I'm damned if I do, damned if I don't
I think you'll change, I know you won't
Holdin' on too tight to the wrong end of a rose
Yeah, your love rides high on a high, high horse
And it cuts real deep like a double-edged sword

Oh yeah
I said your love rides high on a high, high horse
And it cuts real deep

All you do is pull me in and drag me down
Open up, then shut me out
I'm all gassed up, pedal down on a dead-end road, yeah
I'm damned if I do, damned if I don't
I think you'll change, I know you won't
Holdin' on too tight to the wrong end of a rose
Yeah, your love rides high on a high, high horse
And it cuts real deep like a double-edged sword
Your love rides high on a high, high horse
