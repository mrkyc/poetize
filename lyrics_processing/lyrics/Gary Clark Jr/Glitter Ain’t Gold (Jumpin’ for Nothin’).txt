They told me that I needed some patience
But don't keep me waiting too long
They told me that I needed salvation
But who are we to lean on?
'Cause something's going on here, something's going wrong
Running out of time here
But I'm still waiting for something
It doesn't matter how high
As long as you're with me when we fall

We're a step away from breaking down
I need something good now

Hey, hey
Don't get me jumpin' for nothin'
(I don't wanna wait)
(I don't wanna wait)
(I don't wanna wait much longer)
Hey, hey
Don't get me jumpin' for nothin'
(I don't wanna wait)
(I don't wanna wait)
(I don't wanna wait much longer)

The light is at the end of the tunnel
Or is it just a runaway train?

So save yourself a whole lot of pain"
