I'm so tired of fighting
I'm so tired of being wrong
I hate to see you crying
I wish that I could right my wrongs

And make it 'bout us again
Me and that girl ain't nothing more than friends
Tonight, I'm gon' make you forget all about her
Tonight, I'm gon' make you forget all about her

That light between us, it keeps me up
I can't stop thinking about it, oh
I tell her nothing's wrong, this can't go on
I'm done with all the sleeping around
I can't wait

I'm so tired of hiding
I know you're tired of sleeping alone
You always think I'm right
I say I'm working hard and never come home

And make it 'bout us again
Me and that girl ain't nothing more than friends
Tonight, I'm gon' make you forget all about her
Tonight, I'm gon' make you forget all about her
