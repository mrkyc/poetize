I can't go on like this
Knowing that I'm just gettin' by

Knowing that I'm just gettin' high

When I wake up around ten in the morning
Feeling crazy, feeling haunted
From the night before 'cause I was up 'til four in the morning plus some
So I take long trip and then I take out my song scripts
When I sit down to write
I always look to God to help me see the light
But I know, that I ain't been livin' right
And I know, that I can't live by the night
But it's so hard for me just to put it down
So hard for me to pass up the crown
When it's been passed down, I'm sitting on the throne
And sometimes I feel in this world I've just been thrown in
Not been showing it, and I don't know when to slow it down

I can't go on like this
Knowing that I'm just gettin' by
Can't go on like this
Knowing that I'm just gettin' high
Can't go on like this
Knowing that I'm just gettin' by
Can't go on like this
Knowing that I'm just gettin' high

Once again, I hit the hot spot with my so-called friends
Then I hit the ATM and then realize I ain't got no ends
And then I call up my kin "Hey, my money's going"
I'm standing at the bar but the drinks quit flowing
Strapped for cash sitting on the block
Drunk as hell tryna 'void the damn cops
And this is how it is sometimes when you fall off track
Like when your record's scratched and you try to run it back
But sometimes the scratch got too deep an impact
It makes it so hard for you not to look back
Regretting things you did in the past
I wake up in the mornin' tell myself it won't last
But I tend to get another glass, then I
Start to act just like an ass, but I
