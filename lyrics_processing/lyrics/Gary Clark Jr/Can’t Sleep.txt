I met this girl at a party cause she said she was down
I really didn't know her but I'd seen her around
The kind of girl that only likes to hang with the guys
Can tell that she is trouble, see it all in her eyes
But I pursued it the best that I can
Had me a couple shots, I'm feeling like a man
How was I supposed to know that I was part of a plan?
But it's too late now

Now you're the reason that I can't sleep at night and I can't go home
I know it ain't right, gotta leave you alone
But I can't, whoa no
But I can't, whoa no
Now you're the reason that I can't sleep at night and I can't go home
I know it ain't right, gotta leave you alone
But I can't, whoa no
But I can't, whoa no

Well, back to the party where it's going down
The smoke is in the air, smell it all around
Some girls are on the floor, looking good getting down
Some hating motherfucker steady staring me down
But I ain't worried about that for the time
My girl's across the way giving me the eye
She's got her back turned to some other guy
But it's too late now

Now you're the reason that I can't sleep at night and I can't go home

Now you're the reason that I can't sleep at night and I can't go home
I know it ain't right, gotta leave you alone
But I can't, whoa no
But I can't, whoa no
I gotta leave you alone, it ain't right
I gotta leave you alone, it ain't right
I gotta leave you alone, it ain't right
I gotta leave you alone, it ain't right
Now you're the reason that I can't sleep at night and I can't go home
