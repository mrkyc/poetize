No fancy car
Ain't got no excuses baby
Hanging at the bar
I don't owe you a thing baby
I don't owe you a thing
I don't owe you a thing baby

Oh we ain't getting married
I ain't buying you no diamond ring
That's alright
Ain't got no credit
No fancy clothes
Ain't got no excuses, baby
But goodness knows
I don't owe you a thing baby
I don't owe you a thing
I don't owe you a thing baby
I don't owe you a thing
Oh we ain't getting married
I ain't buying you no diamond ring
That's alright
