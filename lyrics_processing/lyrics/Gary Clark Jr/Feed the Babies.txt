Well, it's hard out there for a man
Yeah, it's cold out on the streets
But the world is my buffet, child
And I'm just looking to eat
I ain't got no ill intention
I ain't tryin' to compete
But the world is my buffet, child
And I'm just looking to eat
And feed the babies, oh
Gotta feed the babies now, yeah

So come on, brothers and sisters
It's the same path you walk
Come on, mothers and fathers
Teach the babies to talk
Come on, brothers and sisters
It starts with a song
Come on, mothers and fathers
Stand up for your cause
And teach the babies to love
Gotta teach the babies to love
