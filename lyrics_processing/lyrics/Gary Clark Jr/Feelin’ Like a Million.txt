Friday night and I just got paid
I'm out looking for some trouble
I know I'm about to spend it all
You're not looking for a lover

But I got eyes for you, baby, don't see no one else
The way you move, way you move, I can't help myself
Come on over here, put it on me one more time
The way you shake it, baby, shake it makes me feel alright

You got me feeling like a million bucks
Make me wanna fall in love, baby, when you put it on me
You got me feeling like a million bucks
Make me wanna fall in love, baby, when you put it on me
Got me thinking you're the one, you're the one, you're the one, girl
You're the one, you're the one, you're the one, girl
You got me feeling like a million bucks
Make me wanna fall in love, baby, when you put it on me, on me
(Remember that)

Friday night and she just got paid
She done got herself in trouble
And I done went and spent it all
But she already had a lover
