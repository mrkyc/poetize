It makes me cry and I see clouds up above
It ain't no lie, even my best ain't good enough
So let the feeling flow
When you're dressed up very nice
But you know there's trouble in paradise
When you think you got it right
But your G&T came without the ice
When you feel like you're the boss
But the 9 to 5's too obvious
I ain't complaining, just saying
Sometimes it rains in LA
It can't be perfect every day
Cloudy with chances of heartbreak
The skies were bluer yesterday
When you're screaming and you slam the door
And you tell me that you need no more
But I know it'll all be okay
Sometimes it rains in LA
Looks like you'd arrived
And I'm soaked through to my brain
But that's alright
Won't let it drive me insane
Take my advice, coming outside in the pouring rain
And let your feelings go
