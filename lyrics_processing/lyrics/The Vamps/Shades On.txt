I got my shades on, like I'm rocking Barbados all night
To get you out my mind now, baby
Taking my jeans off, but I'm keeping my shades on all night
To keep you out my sight now, baby
Picture perfect beaches and I'm looking like I just got made
Got the sunshine on my face
Starting up a party on the pavement like I just got paid
And it's alright

I got my shades on, like I'm rocking Barbados all night
And everybody thinks I'm high
Taking my jeans off, but I'm keeping my shades on all night
And everybody's blind

'Cause I look so cool like this
And I feel so good like this
Got me feeling brand new like this
You know
'Cause I look so cool like this
And I feel so good like this
Got me feeling brand new like this
You know

Let's talk about that face, she got the big blue eyes and all that bass
Oh father, let me pray
'Cause I won't see another woman like this for a day
Oh boy, look at that ass
Oh boy, look at that ass
Get your eyes up to my face
'Cause I see you right through your shades

I got my shades on, like I'm rocking Barbados all night
And everybody thinks I'm high
Taking my jeans off, but I'm keeping my shades on all night
And everybody's blind

'Cause I look so cool like this
And I feel so good like this
Got me feeling brand new like this
You know
'Cause I look so cool like this
And I feel so good like this
Got me feeling brand new like this
You know

I got my shades
I got my shades all night
I got my shades on, like I'm rocking Barbados all night
And everybody thinks I'm high
Taking my jeans off, but I'm keeping my shades on all night
And everybody's blind

'Cause I look so cool like this

Got me feeling brand new like this
