So many nights, so many days
Through all of the fights, 'cause I never behaved
And I'm putting it right, hope it isn't too late
And I know, you know, I know we can't let it end this way

Though I stopped calling you
And I stopped taking your messages
Never stopped loving you
And the one thing that I regret is
I stopped calling you
And I stopped taking your messages
Never stopped loving you
Girl, you're still running through my head

So hold on, baby
Know you drive me crazy
It's a sad song really
Shit, you made me happy, oh
Ain't always cool
But it's alright
It's not a sad song really
Shit, you made me happy

Missing the nights, we're staying up late
The scratches and bites, you screamin' my name
Is he loving you right, and am I too late?
'Cause I know, you know, I know we can't let it end this way

Though I stopped calling you (stopped calling you)
And I stopped taking your messages
