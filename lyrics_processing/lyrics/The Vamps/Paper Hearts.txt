There's a lot of things that I may not know
But missing you baby is the only thing I know, I know
And who am I to say what the future holds
But missing you baby is the only thing I know, I know

If my heart was paper, I'd fold it
Throw it to the wind and just hope it ends up with you
I'd sign it with love from me to you
I'd try to be cool, but my feelings, they don't allow me to
And all that I ask, is that at least you write me back
I'm waiting
Here's my paper heart, won't you hold it, hold it?

Said you needed space, so I gave you time
A year's gone by and I'm thinking you're still mine, in my mind
And I've written you this letter like a hundred times to start a conversation that we should've had that night
I tried

If my heart was paper, I'd fold it
Throw it to the wind and just hope it ends up with you
I'd sign it with love from me to you
I'd try to be cool, but my feelings, they don't allow me to
And all that I ask, is that at least you write me back
I'm waiting
Here's my paper heart, won't you hold it, hold it?

Hoping one day it will land
And end up with you

I'd sign it with love from me to you
I'd try to be cool, but my feelings, they won't allow me to
And all that I ask, is that at least you write me back
I'm waiting
Here's my paper heart
I just hope it ends up with you
I'd sign it with love from me to you
I'd try to be cool, but my feelings, they don't allow me to
And all that I ask, is that at least you write me back
I'm waiting
Here's my paper heart, won't you hold it, hold it?
Hold it, hold it
