So give me one line
Promise you'll get the best of times
All you gotta do is let go
I'm the captain, let me rock your boat
You can be my sunshine (sunshine)
Let me watch you do the dirty wind (dirty wind)
Come on, baby, let me let go
You wanna watch me watch you get low

And I can make this unforgettable
You will learn it's irresistible
(Oh no, he didn't)
Yes I did
(No, he didn't)
Well, yes I did
And I can make this unregrettable
You won't see it, unpredictable
(Oh no, he didn't)
Yes I did
(No, he didn't)
Yes I did

'Cause love's a game, come on, and let's play
You don't have to remember my name
I wanna see you hate me, then love me, resent me, then touch me
So touche
