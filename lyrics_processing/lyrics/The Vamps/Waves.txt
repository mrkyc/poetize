My hands are shaking
Holding photos taken
And I wanna get you out of my head
I'm bruised and broken
By the words I've spoken
And there's not much of me left

The cold in my bones
I feel it in any weather
Ghosts in my home
They leave 'cause they can find much better
Lo and behold, I'm on my own
With only myself to blame

'Cause I'm a fool
I let you down, I let you down
I made waves, and I'm ashamed
This all for you
I let you down, I messed around
I made waves, my mistakes, yeah

I know I'm not perfect
And I know you're hurting
I'm sorry that I wasn't there
When I call in the morning
Without any warning
I'll say all the things that I should've said

'Cause I'm a fool
I let you down, I let you down
I made waves, and I'm ashamed
This all for you
I let you down, I messed around
I made waves, my mistakes, yeah

So can't we go back, can't we go back
To when nothing really mattered at all?
So can't we go back, can't we go back? Yeah

'Cause I'm a fool
I let you down, I let you down
I made waves, and I'm ashamed
This all for you
I let you down, I messed around
I made waves, my mistakes
I'm a fool
I let you down, I let you down
I made waves, and I'm ashamed
This all for you
I let you down, I messed around
I made waves, my mistakes, yeah
I made waves
All for you
