Does it
Does it
Does it
Does it ever make you think
Every time he texts you
And you feel your heart sink
Maybe you're worth more than that
Baby, I know that's a fact (No?)
I'm sick of standing on the sidelines
Watching some other guy come and waste your time
You should be with someone else
Baby that's where I can help
If I was your man
Trust me, we'd never need company
So come on, take my hand
Move slow, let your body let me know
Something in your mind has changed
And you're wondering 'bout you and me
Why are you, why are you
Wasting your time (Your time)
Why don't you, why don't you
Come waste mine (Mine)
I'll set your darkest nights alight
Brush the hair out of your eyes
So you can see, you can see
Just what it looks like (Looks like)
If I was your man, na na na na na-ah
If I was your man, na na na na na-ah
If I was your man (Man, man, man)

Knowing he takes for granted exactly what he got
I would keep you satisfied
Waking up the neighbours every night (No?)
I wanna be your only one
But until that time comes
I'm just gonna walk you through
All the things I wanna do
If I was your man (If I was your man)
Trust me (trust me) we'd never need company
So come on, take my hand (Come on, take my hand)
Move slow (move slow) let your body let me know

(You should, you should)
If I was your man

I would keep you satisfied
I would always treat you right
If I, if I, if I was your man
I hope you understand
I'm spending everyday just wishing
Something in your mind has changed
And you're wondering 'bout you and me
Why are you, why are you
Wasting your time (Your time)
Why don't you, why don't you
Come waste mine (Mine)
