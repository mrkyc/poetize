I remember, oh so well
A little mom and pops and motel
Sunday mornings they used to sell
Breakfast at half price
On that corner was a church of god
That there was an old car wash
Now they're just empty parking lots
Where you best not go at night

Started twenty years ago
Well, the times got tight
And the wheels turned slow
Started letting all the workers go
Said they couldn't keep the lights on
Things got bad and then got worse
You know it's hard to earn a dollar
When there ain't no work
People got hungry and my people hurt
Back where I call home

And they said you heard about the old hometown?
Have you heard about the old hometown?
Closing the doors and shutting them down
Have you heard about the old hometown?

My family went to work in the field
Made their liquor from a moonshine steel
Ate whatever they could kill
Yeah, somehow they carried on
People like me just moved away
And said I'll make my way back someday
But my folks they all still say
Boy you best stay gone, stay gone

And they said you heard about the old hometown?
Have you heard about the old hometown?
Closing the doors and shutting them down
Have you heard about the old hometown?

Living on faith and love, living on faith and love
Scratching by, no they won't give up
Living on faith and love
Yeah, you wouldn't believe it if you saw it now
And have you heard about the old hometown?

I remember, oh so well
A little mom and pops and motel
Sunday mornings they used to sell
Breakfast at half price
Yeah, you wouldn't believe it if you saw it now
Have you heard about the old hometown?
Have you heard about the old hometown?
