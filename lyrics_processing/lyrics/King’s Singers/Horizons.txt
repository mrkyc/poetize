Sleep for me, my springbok child
When morning comes, I'll go out hunting
For you are hungry and thirsty, thirsty and hungry
Hungry and thirsty, thirsty and hungry
Hungry and thirsty, thirsty and hungry
Hungry and thirsty, thirsty and hungry
Small moon, Hai! Young moon
When the sun rises, you must speak to the Rain
Charm her with herbs and honeycomb
O speak to her, that I may drink, this little thing, that I may drink
That I may drink, that I may drink
She will come across the dark sky
Mighty Raincow, sing your song for me
That I may find you on the far horizon, far horizon
Horizon
Sleep, my springbok baby
Sleep for me, my springbok child
When morning comes we'll go out hunting
For you are hungry and thirsty, thirsty and hungry
Hungry and thirsty, thirsty and hungry
Hungry and thirsty, thirsty and hungry
Hungry and thirsty, thirsty and hungry
O Star, Hai! Hunting Star
When the sun rises you must blind with your light
The Eland's eyes
O blind his eyes, that I may eat, this little thing, that I may eat
That I may eat, that I may eat
You might also likeHe will come across the red sands
Mighty Eland, dance your dance for me
That I may find you on the far horizon, far horizon
Horizon
Sleep, my springbok baby
Sleep for me, my springbok child
When morning comes, they'll come a-hunting
For they are hungry and thirsty, thirsty and hungry
Hungry and thirsty, thirsty and hungry
Hungry
They will come across the waters
Mighty saviours in their sailing ships
And they will show us new and far horizons, far horizons
Horizon
And they came, came across the waters
Gods in galleons, bearing bows of steel
Then they killed us, on the far horizon
