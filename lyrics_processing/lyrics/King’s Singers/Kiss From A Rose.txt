You became the light on the dark side of me
Love remained a drug that's the high and not the pill
But did you know
That when it snows
My eyes become large and
The light that you shine can be seen
Baby, I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the grey
Ooh, the more I get of you
Stranger it feels, yeah
And now that your rose is in bloom
A light hits the gloom on the grey
There is so much a man can tell you
So much he can say
You remain
My power, my pleasure, my pain
To me you're like a growing addiction that I can't
Deny
Won't you tell me is that healthy, baby?
But did you know
