Alt hough with her nature it did not agree

Which made her repent, and so bitterly lament

Oh I wish once a gain for the North Coun try
Chorus:

Oh the oak and the ash and the bonnie ivy tree
Em B7 Em D Em
They flourish at home in my own coun try
O fain would I be in the North Country
Where the lads and lasses are making of hay;
There should I see what is pleasant to me
A mischief light on them entic'd me away!
I like not the court, nor the city resort
Since there is no fancy tor sucn maids as me;
Their pomp and their pride I can never abide
Because with my humor it does not agree
How oft have I been in the Westmoreland green
Where the young men and maidens resort for to play
Where we with delight, from morning till night
Could feast it and frolic on each holiday
You might also likeThe ewes and their lambs, with the kids and their dam:
To see in the country how finely they play;
The bells they do ring, and the birds they do sing
And the fields and the gardens are pleasant and gay
At wakes and at fairs, being freed of all cares
We there with our lovers did use for to dance;
Then hard hap had I, my ill fortune to try
And so up to London, my steps to advance
But still I perceive, I a husband might have
If I to the city my mind could but frame;
But I'll have a lad that is North Country bred
Or else I'll not marry, in the mind that I am
A maiden I am, and a maid I'll remain
Until my own country again do I see
For here in this place I shall ne'er see the face
Of him that's allotted my love for to be
Then farewell my daddy, and farewell my mammy
Until I do see you, I nothing but mourn;
Rememb'ring my brothers, my sisters, and others
