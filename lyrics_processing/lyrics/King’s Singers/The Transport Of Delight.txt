Some say a tram for me)
Or for bonny Annie Laurie
By the lay them down a dee
Such means of locomotion seem rather dull to us
The driver and conductor of a London omnibus
Hold very tight please! Ting-ting!
Hold very tight please! Ting-ting!
When you are lost in London
And you don't know where you are
You'll hear my voice a-calling
"Pass further down the car!"
And very soon you'll find yourself inside the terminus
In a London transport diesel-engined 97-horsepower omnibus
Along the Queen's great Highway I drive my merry load
At 20 miles-per-hour in the middle of the road
We like to drive in convoys - we're most gregarious:
The big six-wheeler scarlet-painted London transport diesel-engined 97-horsepower
Omnibus
Earth has not anything to show more fair
Mind the stairs! Mind the stairs! Mind the stairs!
Earth has not anything to show more fair
Any more fares? Any more fares? Any more fares? Any more fares? Any more fares?

I sticks me flippin' 'and out and jams on all me brakes
Then jackal taxi drivers can only swear and cuss
Behind that monarch of the road

Omnibus
I stops when I'm requested although it spoils the rides
So he can shout "Gert out of it, we're full right up inside!"
Hold very tight, please
We don't ask much for wages, we only want fair shares
So cut down all the stages and stick up all the fares
If tickets cost a pound a piece
Why should you make a fuss?
It's worth it just to ride inside
That 30-foot-long by 10-foot-wide
Inside that monarch of the road
