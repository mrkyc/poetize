Does anyone have the time to bring me down?
And can I sleep all night long
To the drums of the city rain?
Just make it up
'Cause I'm awake all night long
To the drums of the city rain
And brother, if you have the chance to pick me up
And can I sleep on your couch
To the pound of the ache and pain?
Oh, in my head
'Cause I'm awake all night long
To the drums of the city rain
The lights we chase
The nights we steal
The things that we take to make us feel this
(To the drums of the city rain)
I can't go back (Oh, in my head)
I don't think I will
I won't sleep tonight as long as I still ('Cause I'm awake all night long)
Hear the drums of the city rain
You might also like
Does anyone have the guts to shut me up?
'Cause I believe that every night
There's a chance we can walk away
So hold on tight
Because I won't wait too long
In the drums of the beating rain
'Cause the nights don't last
And we leave alone
Will you drive me back?
Can you take me home?
(To the drums of the city rain)

The lights we chase (yeah, yeah, yeah)
The nights we steal
The things that we take (yeah, yeah)
To make us feel this (To the drums of the city rain)
I can't go back (Oh, in my head)
I don't think I will
I won't sleep tonight as long as I still ('Cause I'm awake all night long)
Hear the drums of the city rain

Faces I don't know
I am tired in the glow
Of the freezing club (All night long)
Keep me breathing (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Don't make the lights come back
Can you take me home?
We all need this (All night long)
When we leave alone
Remember when you and I would make things up?
So many nights, just take me down
To the place we can hear them play
I miss that sound
'Cause now we don't sing so loud
To the drums of the city rain

The lights we chase (yeah, yeah, yeah)
The nights we steal
The things that we take (oh, yeah, yeah)
To make us feel this (To the drums of the city rain)
I can't go back (Oh, in my head)
I don't think I will
I won't sleep tonight as long as I still ('Cause I'm awake all night long)
Hear the drums of the city rain
Like strangers laugh
And like subways feel (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Things I'm trying to break (oh, yeah, yeah)
Oh, just wait until this (To the drums of the city rain)
Is all we have (Oh, in my head)
To keep us ill
I won't breathe tonight as long as I still ('Cause I'm awake all night long)
