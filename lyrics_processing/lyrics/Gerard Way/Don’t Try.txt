Now days, they've been better
I sleep even deader
I wake up when everyone's gone
Just give us a touch, and let me down slow
Just let me know
If this is some kind of life
Or something else
Die just a little, we try just a little
Let's meet in the middle and wait
Or maybe you won't
I'm bored when you don't

You're sad and magical
He says you're beautiful
I think you're beautiful too

Get up, get out, be social
We can't pretend, we won't go
Come down, give up, 'cause it's alright, yeah
Your rise in your heart when you're breathing
'Cause you always look mad when you're dreaming
Come down, give up, 'cause it's alright, yeah
You might also like
Now lights hurt a little
This night's been a bit of a stretch
So I think I might go
Just breathe in and blow
It's all who you know
Just hang around, she makes a bigger sound
Some lipstick lines on the wall
Sure, it takes a little mistake
All the capsules you take
When we dream we all shake
I think he's in love
What you're thinking of

It's liveable
Grey hairs are visible
I'm kind of miserable too

Get up, get out, be social
We can't pretend, we won't go
Come down, give up, 'cause it's alright, yeah
Your rise in your heart when you're breathing
'Cause you always look mad when you're dreaming
Come down, give up, 'cause it's alright, yeah

Let's give you everything
Let's find another ride home
Just give me anything
To sleep, or to go
If you're down, let me know
Make it up, as we go down

Get up, get out, be social
We can't pretend, we won't go
Come down, give up, 'cause it's alright, yeah
Your rise in your heart when you're breathing
'Cause you always look mad when you're dreaming
