The answer's always no
To questions of a private nature
The lights are always low
In settings of a conversation
The ankle trips a wire
While phasing into oscillation
We'll take it when we go
And leave behind our reservations
It goes down

It's never the same and the nights always glow
There's nothing to see and nowhere to go
It's easy to say you're happier when you're disturbed
The grey lights in your head
Getting down the germs
I'm lazy and tame and the chimes always blow
A glimmering sound on the breeze when you go
It's never a shame and I've learned to live with the worms
(Underground)
Getting down the germs


She's happy when it grows
To heights above a normal nature
The spirit always shows
A life beyond a resignation
The hammer breaks the toes
A sliver of a conversation
It's just above a hum
We'll talk about it at the station
It goes down
You might also like
It's never the same and the nights always glow
There's nothing to see and nowhere to go
It's easy to say you're happier when you're disturbed
The grey lights in your head
Getting down the germs
I'm lazy and tame and the chimes always blow
A glimmering sound on the breeze when you go
It's never a shame and I've learned to live with the worms
(Underground)
Getting down

Getting down the germs
Getting down the germs
Getting down the germs
Getting down the germs
Getting down the germs
Getting down the germs
Getting down the germs
Getting down, getting down, getting down
Getting down the germs

It's never the same and the nights always glow
There's nothing to see and nowhere to go
It's easy to say you're happier when you're disturbed
The grey lights in your head
Getting down the germs
I'm lazy and tame and the chimes always blow
A glimmering sound on the breeze when you go
It's never a shame cuz they love to watch when you squirm
(All around)
Getting down
