I'm not gonna sleep tonight
Till the morning fills the sky
No one's getting left behind
This is our time
This is our time!

We're gonna live this night, ye-yeah
Living like it's our last night
Cause nobody cares
If there's no tomorrow

I'm not thinking 'bout the future
(the future)
It's somewhere out there
We're all busy being human
(human)
We remember
Hearts' spinning all around on me
(together)
Now they're surrounding me
This is how we get connected
Running out the shadows into light!
