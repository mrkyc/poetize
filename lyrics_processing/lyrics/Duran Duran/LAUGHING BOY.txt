Time ain't gonna wait
For even you, my friend
I can't stay late
I'm looking at the end
Ace high, hypnotised
And sucked into that scene
Taking on a guise, it wasn't really me

Hard years later
And we're still hanging on
For the St. Jackpot score
That's never gonna come

Not running away now
Been running all day
But it's falling apart now
It's been coming all day

Oh, I have been your laughing boy
I took it on the chin
Accepted gracefully
And all the heat that you deploy (Your laughing boy)
The more I take (Your laughing boy)
The more I break

Cooking fires on a beach
Smoke finger in the sky
You know that's where I should be
My baby by my side
Good times from the start
Remember, yeah, but now
The palace gang's back to old
Things, that's my cue
I'm gettin' out in style

For I have been your laughing boy (Your laughing boy)
I took it on the chin (Your laughing boy)
Accepted gracefully
And all the heat that you deploy (Your laughing boy)
The more I take (Your laughing boy)
The more I break

Not running away now
Been running all day
But it's falling apart now
It's been coming all day

Oh, I have been your laughing boy (Your laughing boy)
I took it on the chin (Your laughing boy)
Accepted gracefully
And all the heat that you deploy
Your laughing boy
The more I take (Your laughing boy)
The more I break
For I have been your loving boy (Your laughing boy)
I took it on the chin (Your laughing boy)
Accepted gracefully
And all the heat you can't deploy (Your laughing boy)
The more I take (Your laughing boy)
