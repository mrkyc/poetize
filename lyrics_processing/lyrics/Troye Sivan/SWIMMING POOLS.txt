I've been running, running, run
I've been running, running, run
I've been running, running, run
I've been running, running, run

So tell me how I'm gonna get past this wave to empty swimming pools
'Cause I just wanna be at the start of after loving you
I plant my feet and I clench my teeth
I can't outrun what's coming after me
So tell me, how am I gonna get past this wave to empty swimming pools?

But I see a lighthouse in the distance calling my name
But I can't get there till I go through all of this pain
There's a glimmer of hope like an exhale of smoke in the sky
And sometimes you drain out on the shit that used to feel right
Empty swimming pools

I've been running, running, run
I've been running, running, run
I've been running, running, run
I've been running, running, run

So tell me how I'm gonna get past this wave to empty swimming pools
Tell me how I'm gonna feel less secure when I look at you
So I close my eyes and just visualise
The greener skies on the other side
So tell me, how am I gonna get past this wave to empty swimming pools?

But I see a lighthouse in the distance calling my name
But I can't get there till I go through all of this pain
There's a glimmer of hope like an exhale of smoke in the sky
And sometimes you drain out on the shit that used to feel right
Empty swimming pools
Empty swimming pools
Empty swimming pools
Empty swimming pools
