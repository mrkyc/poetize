God, I wish it was you
Troye, baby
Last night was fucking crazy
No, no, no, anoche, una puta locura
Una puta locura
What the fuck?

Tokyo just hit me like a wave
Where we ended up, I couldn't say
I'm feelin' like my head's just in a distant time and place
I hope that I got you the way that you got me, baby

And I spent so long just waiting for the signs
Thought I'd lost my every feeling on the ride
Then, oh, you showed, and that's just the way love goes
Now the only thing I wanna know

Is what's the time where you are, you are?
What's the night like where you are, you are?
International straight shot to my heart
I'm right on top of this groove (Groove)
But, God, I wish it was you (You)
Is it better where you are, you are?
What's the weather where you are, you are?
International through line to my heart
This beat is makin' me move (Move)
But, God, I wish it was you (You)
God, I wish it was you

What the fuck?

Open invite if you wanna come (If you wanna come)
'Cause I'm everywhere, you'd think I'm on the run
I'm okay with waitin' if when all is said and all is done (Is said and done)
You know that I got you the way that you got me, baby

And I spent so long just waiting for the signs
Thought I'd lost my every feeling on the ride
Then, oh (Then, oh), you showed (You showed), that's just the way love goes
Now the only thing I wanna know

Is what's the time where you are, you are?

Is it better where you are, you are?
What's the weather where you are, you are?
International through line to my heart
This beat is makin' me move (Me move)
But, God, I wish it was you (It was you)

Troye, baby
No, no, no, anoche, una puta locura

Got an international through line to my heart
This beat is makin' me move (Move)
But, God, I wish it was you (You)
