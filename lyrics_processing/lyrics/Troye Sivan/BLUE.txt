Love hits hard, I know
All your lights are red, but I'm green to go
Used to see you high, now you're only low
All your lights are red but I'm green to go

I want you
I'll colour me blue
Anything it takes to make you stay
Only seeing myself
When I'm looking up at you
I want you
I'll colour me blue
Anything it takes to make you stay
Only seeing myself
When I'm looking up at you

I can't say no
Though the lights are on
There's nobody home
Swore I'd never lose control
Then I fell in love with a heart that beats so slow

I want you
I'll colour me blue
Anything it takes to make you stay
Only seeing myself
When I'm looking up at you
I want you
I'll colour me blue
Anything it takes to make you stay
Only seeing myself
When I'm looking up at you

I know you're seeing black and white
So I'll paint you a clear-blue sky
Without you I am colour-blind
It's raining every time I open my eyes

So I'll paint you a clear-blue sky
Without you I am colour-blind
