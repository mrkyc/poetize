(Work it on, work it on)
(Work it on, work it on)
Emotions are trapped inside
Locked in my mind
It makes my soul realize
My feelings are true
Your heart sets a trance within
Now there's no turning back
It hypnotizes, makes me long for you
You can see
No one else knows
The part of me
That can't let go
I'm on, on the edge of time
Lost inside your heart, girl
Nowhere to be found
Now I need to feel your touch
(Work it on)
(Work it on)
(Work it on)

For love like yours
Is hard to find
