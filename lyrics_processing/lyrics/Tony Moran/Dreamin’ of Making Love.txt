When I look in your eyes
You melt me away
From the kiss on your lips
I can live through the day
Without a loss of affection
When I think to myself
All the things we can do
I've been wanting so much
To make love to you
Making the perfect connection
Can I have you right now? Right now?
I've been waitin' all my life for someone special
And I need you right now, right now
So tell me you want me
'Cause I've been hurting to touch you
Yes, I've been dreamin' of making love
(Dreamin' of making love)
Dreamin' of making love
(Dreamin' of making love)
Dreamin' of making love
Keep me inside of you day and night
You might also likeDim all the lights
And let me see you lose control
(Dim)
Hold me close and feel my heartbeat
Touch my soul
(Touch my soul)
And let me give you all the love
That you've been missin'
(Give you all the love)
So listen when I tell you that I love you
And I want you right now, right now
I've been waiting all my life for someone special
And I need you right now, right now
So tell me you want me
