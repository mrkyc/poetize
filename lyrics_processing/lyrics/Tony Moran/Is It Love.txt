Do you think about her endlessly?
I wake up every night
Dreaming she was next to me
Well, I've heard it all before
I know relationships don't last for you
It's true, what's different now?
She's got a way, so tell us how
Well, it's just the way she does her things
It makes me wonder what to do, oh
(Wonder what to do)
Who would've thought a girl
Could tear a nice guy's heart in two? Yeah
Is it love that is taking me higher?
Is it love that is turning my gray skies blue?
Is it love that is your desire (desire)?
Whoa, deep inside I believe it's true
Is it love?
I can understand the way you feel
(The way you feel)
I can't remember when I felt
A love that was so real
Oh, no
She makes your heart pitter-patter
And nothing else matters
I think that you should take it day by day
(Day by day)
I know this could be the one lover for me
I can't believe you'd truly end this way

(Wonder what to do)
Who would've thought a girl
Could tear a nice guy's heart in two? Yeah
Is it love that is taking me higher?
Is it love that is turning my gray skies blue?
Is it love that is your desire?
Look in my eyes and you'll see it's true
Is it love?
Love, is it love, oh, is it love?
(I can't believe that you're in love)
I can't believe that you're in love
Love, oh, is it love?
I can't believe that you're in love
One, two, three, four, five, six, do it
I feel it growin' and growin', it's flowin'
Watch it, I'm glowin', jump in
Higher and higher 
Not gettin' tired, just feel
The bass gettin' louder
The people clappin' with power
Just say...
Hey, well, it's every day I feel this way
I want to be with you, yeah
(Want to be with you)
Who would've thought a girl
Could tear a nice guy's heart in two? Yeah
Is it love that is taking me higher?
Is it love that is turning my gray skies blue?
Do you think it will last forever?
Deep inside I believe
It's all in your mind
You think that I'm crazy
Told a lie and then you played
I don't believe a word you say
What I feel is real, believe in me
I've heard it all a thousand times
The love you feel is in your mind
I've been cryin', not tryin' to lose the love
Or denyin', I know
(I know, I know, I know, I know)
(He's fallin'...)
I'm fallin' in love (in love)
Yo, Angel, why don't you believe me, man?
'Cause over and over
You tell me the same old story
And, Tony, why you always makin' fun of me?
Why not? You're standin' there in front of me
 That's the answer, not the question
You're thinkin' about yourself
And it's time for my suggestion
Love it, hold it, grab it
 rascal, kick the habit
Is it love?
Is it love?
I feel it growin' and growin', it's flowin'
Watch it, I'm glowin', jump in
Higher and higher 
Not gettin' tired, just feel
The bass gettin' louder
The people clappin' with power
Just say, "TKA is in the house!"
Say, "Tony M. is in the house!"
Hey, Tony M., you know you gotta stop
 like that 
Yo, from now on,  clean man
You're a clean man? You're a clean man?
(Jimmy? Hey, Jimmy?)
Who's Jimmy?
