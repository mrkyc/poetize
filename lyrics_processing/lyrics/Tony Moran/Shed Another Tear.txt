(Don't make me shed)
Don't make me shed
(Shed another)
Don't, don't make me shed
(Don't make me shed)
Don't make me shed
(Shed another tear)
In this whole wide world of hate and pain
Where is the light that's shining?
When the skies pour out their cold, cold rain
Where is the silver lining?
Ooh, how much longer (how much longer)
Will it be before I find my dream?
We gotta find our place in the sun
The time has come to spread our wings
Take my hand, let's fly away
Don't make me shed another tear
Don't be sad, we'll find a place
We'll never shed another tear
These hard, cold streets just fade away
Whenever we're together
If we start our journey here today
We'll make it last forever
You might also likeOoh, love is calling (calling)
From a far-off land where we can go
We're gonna find our place in the sun
It's coming up, let's start today
Take my hand, let's fly away
Don't make me shed another tear
Don't be sad, we'll find a place
We'll never shed another tear
(Take my heart)
Take my hand
Don't wanna shed another tear
To the stars, we'll rise above
We'll never shed another tear
(It's not over)
(It's not over)
(It's not over)
Realize your body's movin'
Groovin', so keep on jumpin' up
Fantasize, if it's not thumpin'
Pumpin', move it anyway
Recognize that this is workin'
Keep jerkin', bass is here to stay
Finalize by screamin' while you're steamin'
Now take the drums away
(Don't make me shed)
Take my hand, let's fly away
Don't make me shed another tear
Don't be sad, we'll find a place
We'll never shed another tear
Take my hand
(Take my hand)
Don't make me shed another tear
Take my heart, my heart
(My heart, my heart)
We'll never shed another tear
(I'll take your hand, just be my man)
Don't make me shed another tear
We'll never shed another tear
Don't make me shed another tear
(I won't be sad, I won't be mad)
We'll never shed another tear
Don't make me shed another tear
