Hey mom when are we going?"

Look mama I love you
But you gotta let me live my life
Look mama I love you

Don't wrap me up in cotton wool
You can't treat me like a fool
Anyway if I was, you gotta let me be one
Okay give me your advice
It's not my fault if I can't be wise
Show me a person who hasn't been done

Look mama I love you
But you gotta let me live my life
