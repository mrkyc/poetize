Starring down at the hard cold ground
Through the frozen tears
Background closing in
White light blur and ice
Hit the ground but not running
Within an inch of my life
Will I get through all this pain
I need the sound of hope to believe again
I hear your voice when they all laugh at me
It is my heart you see
And I still will be a hero in your eyes
Above the cutting words, your love can still be heard
And I still will be a hero in your eyes
Who could know the man I turned out to be
Crashing about in our old backyard sorry sight to see
A stubborn kid not talented a fire in his eye
Still you did what all good folks did
Believed that I would fly
Will I get through all this pain
I need the sound of hope to believe again
