I could just sit
I could just sit and wait for all Your goodness
Hope to feel Your presence
And I could just stay
I could just stay right where I am and hope to feel You
Hope to feel something again

And I could hold on
I could hold on to who I am and never let You
Change me from the inside
And I could be safe
I could be safe here in Your arms and never leave home
Never let these walls down

But You have called me higher
You have called me deeper
And I'll go where You will lead me, Lord
You have called me higher
You have called me deeper
And I'll go where You lead me, Lord
Where You lead me
Where You lead me, Lord
You might also like
And I could hold on
I could hold on to who I am and never let You
Change me from the inside
And I could be safe
I could be safe here in Your arms and never leave home
Never let these walls down

But You have called me higher
You have called me deeper
And I'll go where You will lead me, Lord
You have called me higher
You have called me deeper
And I'll go where You lead me, Lord
Where You lead me

And I will be Yours, oh
I will be Yours for all my life (2x)
And I will be Yours, oh
I will be Yours for all my life
So let Your mercy
And I will be Yours, oh
I will be Yours for all my life
So let Your mercy light the path before me
Cause You have called me higher
You have called me deeper
And I'll go where You will lead me, Lord

Where You lead me
