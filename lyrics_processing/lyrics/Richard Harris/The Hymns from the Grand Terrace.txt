He married her
He married her
He put his arms around her
And he carried her
The way I should have
The way I could have
The way I never really would
And he took her, off to Notre Dame
On a train

There was a hill we climbed and verse we rhymed
Went flying across the waving grass like silver bells
Against the curtain that the sky had made
And so we played
It was a sunny day and so we laid
Beneath the rock that shelted us
From passing planes
The earth caught fire when we turned
Nothing burned
There were nights, when the lights would take us
Nowhere, for a little while
Cars would pass, we were out of gas
And didn't care
Though we walked a mile
You might also likeThere was a DJ in LA
Who we used to tune in at night to hear our favorite song
We always heard it at the perfect time
Upon the hill we climbed
And now she's gone and I'm alone
And though they say I should be safe, secure and sane
I remember yesterday
And the games that children played

If I could bind your mind
To mine in time
To keep you, from that world of his
If I could change the strangeness in your kind
Then I'd know where your soul is
And then I'd know
What song I'd have to sing
To touch that chord within you
And I would weave such wondrous songs
When it was done
I'd win you
If I stand with the stars on either hand
And say "girl, this ain't the answer"
If I'd been where you're goin'
But then
I'd never be a dancer
But if I was
I'd know what step to take
And laugh at what had freed me
And smash the great wall down, girl
When it was done
You'd need me
If I could face the fate that waits to cast me into shambles
And sit across the velvet boards from God, then I would gamble
And if I could
I'd know what chance to take
And before the devil sold you
I'd bet my soul against the stars
And when it was done
I'd hold you

If I'd been born
A different kind
With a different heart
And a different mind
I might have stayed
Afraid of what I'd find
I guess your love will keep
If you just knew
How close I came to stayin'
But then again you never
Heard a word that I was sayin'
I just as well
Have spent my time prayin'
My but the valley's deep
My but the mountain's steep
And it's hard to see
When you must weep
Oh I loved you
Oh I loved you
If I'd been born
A different man
I might have tried
To understand
I might have stayed there
Safely, in your hand
Lord, why can't I
