Not feeling, not nothing, good intentions but jealousy takes over
All excuses, abuses, this time I know it's not over
So I take all my pride and I shove it back down inside
This time, harassment's gone too far

Get away from me!
Stay the fuck away from me!
Get away from me!
Stay the fuck away from me!
Get away from me!
Stay the fuck away from me!
Get away from me!
Stay the fuck away from me!

He wanted more
Wanted a silenced whore
You ruined my life
Kill me now and burn my soul

Get away from me!
Stay the fuck away from me!
Get away from me!
Stay the fuck away from me!
Get away from me!
Stay the fuck away from me!
Get away from me!
Stay the fuck away from me!

Tell me gotta do it like this, gotta do it like that, answer me
What about all those times you looked me in the eyes and said you lied?
You know it's over, it's over
What do you see in me? I can't go out at night, answer me
Tell me gotta do it like this, gotta do it like that, answer me
What about all those times you looked me in the eyes and said you lied?
You know it's over, it's over
What do you see in me? I can't go out at night, answer me
Tell me gotta do it like this, gotta do it like that, answer me

You know it's over, it's over
I'm through
