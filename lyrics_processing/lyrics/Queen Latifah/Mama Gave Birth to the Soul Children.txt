Take this mask off
Take it off
Take it off, I'll break your damn neck
Take this mask off
Take it off
Take it off
Okay, okay
Shit
Okay
Angel dust
Possy, Dovey
Yes, mama?
Time to get up
Hello, I'm Queen Latifah, how you doing?
I hope that you're with this, I hope that you're willing
I want to introduce you to a cut called, "Mama Gave Birth to the Soul Children"

Well, here comes the 'Goy (The 'Goy?)
The Tru to the 'Goy
You know the one, the a Dove-like boy
Stepping in a step (Step), keeping with a kept (Kept)
Making an appearance with a knotty-head set
Lunatics you lose 'cause the Plug 2's sayin'
Peace to the negative, nah, you make the weigh-in
Weigh-in (Weigh-in), weigh-in (Weigh-in), way out of order
If you know you're better, you'd better that you caught a
Waving the mighty peace sign higher than a kite
If you're feeling sick, it's alright, it's fever night
Don't go do-si-do and diggin' no potholes
'Cause if you do, we calling March Patrol
It's no different from the verbal last heard
Cayumbo is the ruler that's bond to the word
He's moving more than three feet, rocking with the knee-deep
Dove is going to leave you with a tweet, tweet, tweet

Next on the menu, we continue with the pasta
Dipped in chocolate, served with lots of
Twizzlers and honey, yum, yum, yummy
Lyrics I'm flaunting is good for the tummy
Tiptoeing in, I proceed to the floors
Selling much records like a pimp mover
Excuse me, momsy, Pos wins
Cause I'm the A to the Plug W-O-N
Brother, freak it live for this tribe
Now let's ride down the highway of vibes
Pushing that we start 'cause the soul says please
'Cause backwards, that's rats and we don't eat cheese
Duck sentences need to get my meaning
'Cause preacher is the key to the casual reading
Polaroid flicks are back and you will know
That the soul is moving on up like the Jeffersons show

Go mommy, go mommy, go mommy
Go mommy, go mommy, go mommy
Go mommy, go mommy, go mommy
Go mommy, go mommy, go mommy

I'm back, a Black queen upon the scene
With a knack for funky tracks, know what I mean?
Prince Paul produces this and it's a fly one
It had to be that way, he's one of my sons
It's a family affair and then we're out of here
There's no doubt here 'cause this is our year
So plex to a Queen Latifah/De La Soul sound (Go 'head, mama, get down)
It was inevitable that this joint venture would be incredible
We never put ourselves on any pedestal
But the rhyme is so good, it's practically edible (Say what?)
So check the sounds of Mama Zulu (Mama Zulu) as I relay the story untold
And if you're wondering why I got kids so big, they weren't born from the body, they were born from the soul
Go mommy, go mommy, mommy
Mommy, can you teach us how to rhyme?
Just like the rest of the family, baby
Mommy, mommy, is the tribe really that big?
The tribe is as big as the ocean
Mommy, can we say hi to the family? Mommy, please
Go on, baby
I wanna say hi to my brother Mase
I'd like to say to my Jungle Brothers, Mike G, Afrika, Sammy B
And Q-Tip and Ali-Shaheed Muhammad from Quest, yeah
We have to say hi to our little sister, Monie Love
Yeah, I like that
We'd like to say hi to grandpa
Yeah, grandpa Afrika Bambaataa
And grandma, grandma Omi
And we want to say hi to the Flavor Unit
And the Safari Sisters
Oh, yeah
And we gotta say hi to papa Prop, Red Alert
Oh, hi, Red
We have to say to say hi to our big, big, big, big brother, Prince Paul
Yeah, the gouda man
And mommy, we love you, mommy
