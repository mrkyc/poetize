My mellow Latee was kicking flavors, the R.E. posse said, "Yo, Latifah we can do this"
So I paused and took a thought, then my brilliance, I caught and I agreed 'cause I already knew this
Now you should wanna plex
'Cause I'm in full effects
Queen Latifah is 5-0 on this set
You've been begging and dying
For somebody's rhyming to set you free
For God so loved the world, he gave you me
I'm coolin', teaching those needing schoolin'
And the mic, this mic in my hand, I'm rulin'
So prepare your mind for my lifeline and meet the new queen of royal badness
Latifah has the spirit so head for the water and dive into the wrath of my madness

Queen Latifah getting higher cause them to run away

Some MCs act bold and arrogant, vain and using each other to compete with
These subjects, I pity 'cause their rhymes are not witty like mine, to write a rhyme that's so delicious you can eat it
There are those who like my taste, but don't consider biting
There's penalties for those who don't do right and just be reciting
Everyone else's word that took a lot of thinking
It's not our fault your thoughts are shrinking
Well, mine are growing, yes, you know like all the woman inside of me
Despite what you do or say and even in spite of me
Brothers catch my eye with little hijinks like eye winks, dying to have a lover of my likeness
So release all your shyness, just call me, "Your highness," and dare to feel the wrath of my madness

Word of mouth is always everlasting and everlasting are the words that I bring
The ruler of the ring is Lord Ramsey and music is made by Mark the 45 King
You tremble for my treble, you're begging for the bass
The voice is too vicious, the same as the pace
The crowds, they love me, the brothers give only hugs
Their shrink-to-fit button-flies fit quite snug as a bug
You know why? Because I'm bugging
Off the beats that DJ Mark is loving
So plex off the sounds that I'm pumping, I'm jumping with energy to turn your mind to gladness
Come on, just get into it, don't lie and say you've been through it, feel the wrath of my madness

Cost of living getting higher cause them to run away
Queen Latifah getting higher cause them to run away

The scene is mine 'cause I took it, I took it for the money and I took it for the fun
Don't step up in my face, you don't wanna feel the taste, don't try to play me out 'cause I am not the one
Brothers on my bra strap, sisters clocking my sound
Why? Because they wanna be down
With the Queen L-A-T-I-F-A-H in command
I supply the concept for you to understand
For those who wanna bite, don't make me have to fuss
The only thing you get is the gluteus maximus
Suckers on the tip, you're loving me, you're leaving me, you wish that one day you could have this
Come on, you know the time, just be thankful for the rhyme and get up on the wrath of my madness
