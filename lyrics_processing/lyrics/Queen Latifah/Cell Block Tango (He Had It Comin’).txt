Dana Owens AKA Queen Latifah, yes, I'm here to testify
No, I gotta speak on my behalf
You don't even know what happened
Can I just tell you what happened?

He had it comin' (He had it comin', comin')
He only had himself to blame
If you'd've been there (If you'd've seen it)
I think that you would have done the same

I mean, imagine, why was he hittin' his woman? Why was she takin' that?
Now picture her fightin' back
Think of the ass kickin', think of his ass flippin' down the stairs
And me at the top smilin', he should've stopped wildin' (Uh)
Now could you picture me tryin' to finish him off? (Uh)
See why I pictured me on this side of the law? (Yeah)
High heels leave holes, you'd've thought I was gunnin'
Now the cops comin', I ain't runnin' (He had it comin')
Girl, you should've seen it, should've bobbed and weaved it
'Fore the cops came, got a couple of clean hits
And word to Jesus, couldn't take the abuse
But I couldn't explain that to the state troops
But you know, girl (Hmm, yeah, you go, girl)
Plus I look real cute in orange jumpsuits
This the story I'm tellin' and I ain't changin' nothin'
I just needed you to know, Your Honor

Alright, alright, let's get this over with, take the mugshot
Hurry up and fingerprint, what the blood clot?
Lil' Kim AKA Sofia Luchiani
Keep your jumpsuit, I'm rockin' Armani
Yeah, I bust at him once, but that was just a warnin'
My lawyer'll be here with bail money in the mornin'
I'm not guilty, just tryin' to protect mines
Ain't my fault he ran into my knife twenty times (He had it comin')
Just my luck the bastard ain't die
What you would've did if, every other day, he blacked your eye?
Broke your nose 'til it started bleedin'
Kick you in your ribs, choke you 'til you stop breathin'
**** that, I'm sick of bobbin' and weavin'
Him threatenin' to kill me when I threaten to leave him
I'll do a bid 'cause ain't no way
**** gonna do me like Ike and OJ
He had it comin' (Comin')
He only had himself to blame
If you'd've been there (If you'd've seen it)
I think that you would have done the same
He had it comin' (Comin')
He only had himself to blame

This is for the constantly accused, mentally abused (Uh, yeah)
How many of you been in my shoes before? (Alright, please)
Or have you felt you caught the worse case
Puttin' up with his tired ass in the first place?
Why am I flippin'?
I just bought them condoms, I ain't used not one, but there was two missin' (Two missin'?)
Made a new mission, how to catch a cheater
If he only use Coast, you shouldn't smell Lever (He had it comin')
If you know he don't smoke, you shouldn't smell reefer
If you catch him cheatin', you shouldn't yell either
Run up on him quietly, choke him out silently
It might sound cruel, but you gotta love the irony
So explain that, just came back off a trip
And I come home to this
Please, he ain't follow the guidelines
So forgive me, Your Honor, but he ran into my knife five times
He had it comin' (Comin')
He only had himself to blame
If you'd've been there (If you'd've seen it)
I think that you would have done the same
He had it comin' (Comin')

I think that you would have done the same
