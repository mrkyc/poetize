I even took her home to meet my mother
That's why it breaks my heart to discover
That she ain't a country music lover
"Well I already knew we disagreed on politics and religion
And it didn't really bother me too much when I found out she didn't like to go fishin
The trouble all started with them phonograph records I bought her
Like she thought "Kitty Wells" was a place a cat goes to get water
Oh I really thought that I'd learned to love her
I even took her home to meet my mother
That's why it breaks my heart to discover
That she ain't a country music lover
But friends it didn't take me long to realize that this ol girl was in a fog
Why she even thought that "Ferlin Husky" was some kind of Eskimo dog
She thought "The Texas Troubadour's" were President Johnsons stand
She even thought that "Ernest Tubb" was a sincere place to take a bath
Oh I really thought that I'd learned to love her
I even took her home to meet my mother
That's why it breaks my heart to discover
That she ain't a country music lover
Just to think that she'd been to college and travelled around the world
Then the nerve to ask me if "Bobby Bare" was a striptease girl
But what really got my goat and made me explode
Would you believe that she thought "Jonny Cash" was money you find in a commode
Oh I really thought that I'd learned to love her
I even took her home to meet my mother
That's why it breaks my heart to discover
That she ain't a country music lover
Man talk about being this, squirly ain't the word
Why she even thinks that "Pete Drake" is a duck
"Western Union" is a cowboys underwear
