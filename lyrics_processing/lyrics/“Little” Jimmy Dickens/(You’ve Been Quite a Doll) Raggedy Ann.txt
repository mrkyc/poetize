Yes, quite a doll
But I didn't really know you until I started making these trips up
Here to talk to you
And now I'm beginning to see more and more why my baby loved you so
Much
Why, Raggedy Ann, sometimes I'd almost swear that you're just about
As much alive as I am
When I hug you up close to me, I feel every ounce of the warm glow of
Love that she must've felt
And you know what, Raggedy Ann
I'd give anything I owned in this world
If I knew just half of the memories that have passed through those
Little black button eyes of yours
Hid themselves in their tear stained stuff
Well I bet your just busting out with little old childhood secrets
That could really set a lonely man's heart aglow
Sometimes I still have to laugh the way you had to sample all of her
Food
And see all of her little new dresses
And answer a thousand questions
It's really a small wonder that you're all in one piece
The way she used to drag you around by one leg everywhere she went
But you didn't seem to mind, 'cause you always had that big ole smile
On your face
And You know something, Raggedy Ann
I bet that smile has dryed more tears and cured more little hurts
Then I could ever hope to kiss away
And I'll tell you something else
That big smile has given me strength to face some pretty trying times
Myself
And I want to thank you again, Raggedy Ann
For helping me raise her after her Momma died
Somehow you just stepped right into her Momma shoes
And just that much further into our hearts
And that year of the rains, remember
One night the fever took my baby
You just laid right there beside her
While I did everything I could, right up to the end
And since then its just been me and you, Raggedy Ann
Just me and you
But you know the years haven't seemed to bother you too much
Course, you're a little faded here and there from the wind and rain
But that heartwarming charm and that spark of love seems stronger now
Then it ever did
And look at me, why I barely made it up the hill today
Look Raggedy Ann, I can't even brush the dirt from my knees
So don't look for me tomorrow, I won't make it
I'd like to take you with me, Raggedy Ann
But I know you'll be happier right here
Watching over my baby and keeping her warm
Well, I've got to leave you now, I gotta go
Aand about the only thing that comes to my mind to say to you is God
Bless You
And you sure have been quite a doll, Raggedy Ann
