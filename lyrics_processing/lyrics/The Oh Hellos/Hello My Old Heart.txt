Hello, my old heart
How have you been?
Are you still there inside my chest?
I've been so worried
You've been so still
Barely beating at all

Oh
Don't leave me here alone
Don't tell me that we've grown
For having loved a little while
Oh, whoa-oh
I don't wanna be alone
I wanna find a home
And I wanna share it with you
You might also like
Hello, my old heart
It's been so long
Since I've given you away
And every day
I add another stone
To the walls I built around you
To keep you safe

Oh
Don't leave me here alone
Don't tell me that we've grown
For having loved a little while
Oh, whoa-oh
I don't wanna be alone
I wanna find a home
And I wanna share it with you

Hello, my old heart
How have you been?
How is it being locked away?
Don't you worry
In there, you're safe
And it's true, you'll never beat
But you'll never break

Nothing lasts forever
Some things aren't meant to be
But you'll never find the answers
Until you set your old heart free
Until you set your old heart free
