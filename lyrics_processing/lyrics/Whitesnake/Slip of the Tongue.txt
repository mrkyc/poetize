Sometime after midnight, the heat begins to rise
Girl, you'd shame the devil with the look that's in your eyes
I know what's on your mind, I can't run away
If I don't give you what you want, there's going to be some hell to pay

Creeping up behind me, knocking at my door
I'd never be too blind to see just what you're looking for
You roll me over, make me moan
Ooh, such a velvet touch, you'd melt a heart of stone

Anytime, anyplace
I'm just the fool who puts a smile on your face
A slave to love and keep you young
All it takes is no mistakes, is just a slip of the tongue
Just a slip of the tongue

If I want a little love, I gotta take a lot pain
Make me think a thousand times before I kiss again
I'm waiting on you, every day and every night
If I don't try to satisfy, there's going to be a fist fight

Anytime, anyplace
I'm just the fool who puts a smile on your face
A slave to love and keep you young
All it takes is no mistakes, is just a slip of the tongue
Just a slip of the tongue

The sun is slowly rising and I'm sinking to my knees
I'm dying just to close my eyes, I'm begging, darling, please
I hear you calling and I'm crawling 'cross the floor
I give you everything I got and still you ask for more

Anytime, anyplace
I'm just the fool who puts a smile on your face
A slave to love and keep you young
All it takes is no mistakes, is just a slip of the tongue
A slip of the tongue

Just a slip of the tongue
A slip of the tongue
Just a slip of the tongue
A slip of the tongue
