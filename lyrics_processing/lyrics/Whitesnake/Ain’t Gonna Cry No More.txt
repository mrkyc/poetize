I turn to greet the dawn
Knowing I must face another day
Sleepless night behind me
Just a memory of pain
My heart has always
Been a cross to bear
Lord I know the sun shine
But, I feel the tears of rain
Falling down to wash my sins away
I'll try, hard to remember
So I won't be fooled again
Hey, ain't gonna cry no more today
All around me, shadows fall
Tho' day has just begun
I realise I'm on my own again
Memories of broken dreams
As distant as the sun
Are drifting like an echo
In the wind
Lord, I know the sunshine
But, I feel the tears of rain
Falling down to wash my
Sins away
I'll try, hard to remember
So I won't be fooled
Again
Hey, ain't gonna cry no
More today
Babe, I thought about it
But, it just ain't done
Good
You hold my heart and
Soul within your hand
All the time, you're in my
Mind
I never thought you
Could be so blind
Maybe someday I will
Understand
Lord, I know the sun
Shine
But I feel the tears of rain
Falling down to wash my
Sins away
I'll try hard to remember
So I won't be fooled
Again
Hey, ain't gonna cry no
More today, no more
Hey, mama you drive me
Crazy
Knowing you're my
Hearts desire
Why'd you go and hang
Me up this way
You've given me love
Given me love
Now tell me what you
Were thinking of
Why'd you go and steal
My soul away
Lord I know the
Sunshine
But, I feel the tears of
Rain
Falling down to wash my
Sins away
I'll try hard to remember
So I won't be fooled
Again
Hey, ain't gonna cry no
More today
I ain't gonna cry no
More
(Solo)
Lord I know the
Sunshine
But, I feel the tears of
Rain
Falling down to wash my
Sins away
I'll try hard to remember
So I won't be fooled
Again
Hey, ain't gonna cry no
More today
Ain't gonna cry no
More1
Hey, I ain't gonna cry no
