Now you're gone
I can feel my heart is breakin'
And I can't go on
When I think of the love, you have taken

In the night, I pray for your embrace
Every time I close my eyes
I can't escape your face
You're out of sight, but always on my mind
I never realized my love could be so blind

You're all I want
Can't you feel the love in this heart of mine? (This heart of mine)
You're all I need
So maybe we could turn back the hands of time
Maybe we could give it another try, one more time

But, now you're gone
There's an emptiness closin' around me
And I can't go on
When all I have left is the memory
You might also like
In the night, I call out your name
I wake up in a cold sweat
And I'm all alone again
I need your love, much more than I can say
I realize without you, I can't face another day

You're all I want
Can't you feel the love in this heart of mine? (This heart of mine)
You're all that I need
Since I lost you, girl, I've been losin' my mind (Losin' my mind)
You're all that I want
So maybe we could turn back the hands of time
Maybe we could give it another try, one more time
Baby, just one more time

Now you're gone
I can feel my heart is breakin'
And I can't go on
When all of my love has been taken

You're all I want
Can't you feel the love in this heart of mine? (This heart of mine)
You're all that I need
Since I lost you, girl, I've been losin' my mind (Losin' my mind)
You're all I want
Can't you feel the love in this heart of mine? (This heart of mine)
You're all that I need
Since I lost you, girl, I've been losin' my mind (Losin' my mind)
I've been losin' my mind
(Can't you feel the love in this heart of mine?)
You're all that I want
