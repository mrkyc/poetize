Hey girl, if you want me
Come and get me
Don't hang around
Or we could spend the night sleeping alone
If you could change your style for a while
Look in my direction
Tell me do I look the kind of guy
Who takes advantage of a woman like you
Or is that what you want?

Would I lie to you?
Would I lie to you?
I would do anything that you want me to
But would I lie to you?
Would I lie to you?
Would I lie to you?
Baby, I would do anything that you want me to
But would I lie to, would I lie to, would I lie to you?

Hey girl, if you need
Some love and affection
I'll whisper all the sweet, sweet nothings
I know you little girls like to hear
Now listen
If you would change your mind
We could find a night of satin sheet action
I promise I won't do anything
Baby, unless you wanted me to
And that's a fact
You might also like
Would I lie to you?
Would I lie to you?
I would do anything that you want me to
But would I lie to you?
Baby, baby, would I lie to you?
Would I lie to you?
I would do anything that you want me to
But would I lie to, would I lie to, should I lie to you?
Just to get in your pants

I don't wanna sleep alone tonight
After all you put me through
I've spent the whole night searching
For a woman just like you
Look in my eyes
Hear the words that I say
If my eyes tell you lies
Then, baby, it's just because I want you to stay

Would I lie to you?
Would I lie to you?
I would do anything that you want me to
But would I lie to you?
Would I lie to you?
Would I lie to you?
Baby, I would do anything that you want me to
But would I lie to, would I lie to, would I lie to you?
Baby, baby
Would I lie to you?
Would I lie to you?
Baby, I would do anything that you want me to
But would I lie to you?
Would I lie to you?
Would I lie to you?
Baby, I would do anything that you want me to
But would I lie to, would I lie to, should I lie to you?
Just to get in your pants
