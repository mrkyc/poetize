I believe my love for you is a love that will last forever
And I'm here to testify, I'm a prisoner of your heart
Baby, don't you believe when I tell you I love you that I really mean it
Don't you walk away, don't turn your back on me

I'm guilty of love
It's a crime of passion
Guilty of love
And there's no doubt about it, no doubt about it

Guilty of love, I'm guilty of love
I'm guilty in the first degree
Guilty of love, I'm guilty of love
I'm guilty in the first degree

I can never forget all the times when I took what you gave me for granted
So I stand accused and I plead guilty to the crime
You can lock me away if you want just as long as your arms are around me
And I won't mind if you just throw away the key

I'm guilty of love
It's a crime of passion
Guilty of love
And there's no doubt about it, no doubt about it
You might also like
Guilty of love, I'm guilty of love
I'm guilty in the first degree
Guilty of love, I'm guilty of love
I'm guilty in the first degree

Guilty of love, woo


Guilty of love
It's a crime of passion
Guilty of love
And there's no doubt about it, no doubt about it

Guilty of love, I'm guilty of love
I'm guilty in the first degree
Guilty of love, I'm guilty of love
I'm guilty in the first degree

Guilty of love, I'm guilty of love
I'm guilty in the first degree
Guilty of love, I'm guilty of love
I'm guilty in the first degree
Guilty of love, I'm guilty of love
I'm guilty in the first degree
Guilty of love, I'm guilty of love
I'm guilty in the first degree

Guilty of love, I'm guilty of love
I'm guilty in the first degree
Guilty of love, I'm guilty of love
I'm guilty in the first degree

Guilty of love, I'm guilty of love
I'm guilty in the first degree
Guilty of love, I'm guilty of love
