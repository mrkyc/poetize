I want you, I need your rhyme
But you keep saying, babe, it's gonna take time
I know the heartache I've put you through
Believe me, babe, I'm gonna make it up to you

You are the reason I'm down on my knees
I'm begging you to give me a chance

If only you would give me just a little more time
Give me just a little more time
Give me just a little more time
Give me just a little more time to prove it to you

So many feelings I can't explain
I never thought I'd ever cause you any pain
Now I'm alone here and I can't hide
The sun don't shine for me without you by my side

You are the reason I'm down on my knees
I'm begging you to give me a chance
You might also like
If only you would give me just a little more time
Give me just a little more time
Give me just a little more time
Give me just a little more time to prove it to you

I'm gonna prove it, woah


I want you right by my side
'Cause you're the only one who keeps me satisfied
I need your loving, I need your charms
Can't stand the thought of you in someone else's arms

You are the reason I'm down on my knees
I'm begging you to give me a chance

If only you would give me just a little more time
Give me just a little more time
Give me just a little more time
Give me just a little more time
Give me just a little more time
Baby, give me just a little more time
Give me just a little more time
You've got to give me just a little more time to prove it to you
