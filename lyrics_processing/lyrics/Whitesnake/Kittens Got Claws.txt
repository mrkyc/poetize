Walkin' down the street, you're the center of my universe
You got the world in your pocket, my manhood locked in your purse
You ain't a bad girl, honey, no matter what the neighbors say
It's just that you wear those skin-tight dresses with your G-string tuned to A

Sweet, sweet, child of the street

Heaven-sent, you're an angel dressed in black
Cool, stiletto strut, you're a drop jaw cardiac
You're the genuine feline, prettiest girl I've ever seen
With your thief of hearts smile, you're a certified pleasure machine

Sweet, sweet, child of the street

Dressed to kill in diamonds and fur
Get what you want with your pussycat purr

(But the kittens got claws) She'll tear your heart out
(Kittens got claws) She'll scratch your back
(Kittens got claws) She'll tease and please you
(Kittens got claws) She's a heart attack
You might also like
You treat me good, sometimes you treat me bad
But keep it up, honey, you're the best time I've ever had
No matter what you put me through, I must confess
Ooh, you got more style than a brand new XJS

Sweet, sweet, child of the street

Dressed to kill in diamonds and fur
You get what you want with your pussycat purr

(But the kittens got claws) She'll tear your heart out
(Kittens got claws) She'll scratch your back
(Kittens got claws) She'll tease and please you
(Kittens got claws) She's a heart attack

(Just heat it up, baby)
Heat it up, heat it up

Walkin' down the street, you're the center of my universe
You got the world in your pocket, my manhood locked in your purse
I know you ain't a bad girl, honey, no matter what the neighbors say
It's just that you wear those skin-tight dresses with your G-string tuned to A
Sweet, sweet, child of the street

Dressed to kill in diamonds and fur
You get what you want with your pussycat purr

(But the kittens got claws) She'll tear your heart out
(Kittens got claws) She'll scratch your back
(Kittens got claws) She'll tease and please you
(Kittens got claws) She'll blow your stack

(Kittens got claws) She'll tear your heart out
(Kittens got claws) She'll scratch your back
(Kittens got claws) She'll tease and please you
(Kittens got claws) She's a heart attack
