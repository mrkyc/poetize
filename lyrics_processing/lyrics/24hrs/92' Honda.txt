24hrs
20 a boss
My 92' Honda, my 92' Honda

Used to pick you up, you was arguing with your mama
I don't like you friends cause they always with the drama
Baby I've been focused tryna get to the commas
All these niggas hating but really that's common
Rolling up weed, I used to listen to your problems
And I don't pillow talk but girl you have problems
Me and you probably did Fellini's for lunch
And I ain't have much but you can have what you want
I told that I love you and you played with my heart
I was super young so I really wasn't smart

You remind me of my Honda, my 92' Honda
I was really in love with you, my 92' Honda
You could had the world girl, my 92' Honda
But now I'm driving 'Raris (skrt skrt) and I got a Barbie
You my 92' Honda, my 92' Honda

I've been Saint Laurent shopping
20 got it popping
And we ain't talked in a long time
You gotta wait in a long line
Cause now I got issues
Talking big money problems
I'm barely talking to my mama
I swear that I've been working
But God got a plan for me
You used to be my family
We used to have matching Jordans
I used to tell you I'm recording
You used to say you didn't give a fuck
And now you hit your line back
You might also like
My 92' Honda, my 92' Honda
My 92' Honda, my 92' Honda
I used to be in love with you
I used to be in love with you
But you just played me girl
But you just played me girl
My 92' Honda, my 92' Honda
And now I got a Barbie
20 push a 'Rari
My 92' Honda, my 92' Honda

Oh I did understand you
Me and you weren't ready
We was smoking ganja
Now you my 92' Honda
