Used to pick you up from the Pappadeaux's
We was broke, had obstacles
We did the impossible

That Mitsubishi was the only ride
Promised I was the only guy
Long ride from the north side
Just to get Fellini pies

Peter St. for the weed, Quasi got what I need
Double Cs on me, spent some bands on these
TYO in the backseat, that was right before "Uber"
Me and Fin, we was juugin' weed, ridin' 'round with the shooter

Seems like it was yesterday
You took me to see Kanye
Took you to Miami
Before you knew how to hold your liquor
Call Tune, my fuckin' nigga
TYO, they not fuckin' with you
And she don't want no other niggas
