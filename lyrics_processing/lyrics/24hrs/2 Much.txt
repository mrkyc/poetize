24hrs, oh woah
Apex a boss, Apex a boss

Can't sleep, I've been nervous some hours
The money just takin' a shower
Twenty respectin' now cowards
The backwoods they full of the flower
She ain't got throwed to the money
I just have bought Audemar
Just did a show in Vermont
Twenty not fake, I'm just blunt
Bitch I need ?
Like how she throwin' it back
Twenty just run thru them racks
She don't know how to react
Like it when shawty come find me
I take her out the country
Like it when shawty come find me
I take her out the country

That ain't too much, that ain't too much
That ain't too much, that ain't too much for me
That ain't too much, that ain't too much
That ain't too much, that ain't too much for me
That ain't too much, that ain't too much
That ain't too much, that ain't too much for me
That ain't too much, that ain't too much
That ain't too much, that ain't too much for me

Stripper pole in the hotel room
Your body on me, I'm on you
You treat me right, you can have the whole world
Love makin', make you tap out, girl
Slow grind on me, slow wind on me
Don't move too fast, slow grind on me
Fall in love, let's fall in love, girl
Fall in love, let's fall in love, girl

That ain't too much, that ain't too much
That ain't too much, that ain't too much for me
That ain't too much, that ain't too much
That ain't too much, that ain't too much for me
That ain't too much, that ain't too much
That ain't too much, that ain't too much for me
That ain't too much, that ain't too much
That ain't too much, that ain't too much for me
That ain't too much, that ain't too much
That ain't too much, that ain't too much for me
That ain't too much, that ain't too much
That ain't too much, that ain't too much for me
That ain't too much, that ain't too much
That ain't too much, that ain't too much for me
That ain't too much, that ain't too much
