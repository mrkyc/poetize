I've been dreaming 'bout the strip club
Twenty-four-hour strip club
When the kitchen don't close
And they always got ones

I'ma need the baddest
Like they came right out a magazine
Ooo-ooh
And they gon' go

All the hoes is bad
All the hoes is bad
All the hoes is bad
All the hoes is bad
All the hoes is bad
All the hoes is bad
All the hoes is bad
All the hoes is bad

Welcome to the strip club
Home of the wings and ass
We got a ATM, we got a ATM, we got a ATM
If we ain't got no money
Yeah, you don't get no dances
You ain't got no money
Yeah, you don't get no dances
You ain't got no money
Yeah, you don't get no dances
You ain't got no money
Yeah, you don't get no dances
Strip club party, stretch my shawty
Ooh, she got a round thing, touch your toes for daddy
Super energetic; I can see you athletic
Super freaky for Twenty
You might also like
I'ma need the baddest
Like they came right out a magazine
Ooo-ooh, and they gon' go

All the hoes is bad
All the hoes is bad
All the hoes is bad
All the hoes is bad
All the hoes is bad
All the hoes is bad
All the hoes is bad
All the hoes is bad

Just spent the night in the shade (shade)
That's my favorite place (place)
Flood so many ones (ones)
The bank teller need a break (break, damn)
My backyard got a lake (lake, mm)
My front yard like a dealership (uh-huh)
Real nigga, I'm filthy rich
You can never have too many whips (woo)
Strip club, eat spinach dip
Whisper pimp shit in her ear
Told her, she can come slide down
My pole soon as she finish here
Krispy right 'round the corner
We can make a list if you wanna
You been workin' so hard
Bring me that pussy, you can get a bonus
I pop a pill, I'm at it all night (night)
Higher than a red eye flight (flight)
And I don't take care of no kids
If you got good head, I might (I might)
I might take your whole crew to the mall (mall)
Tell them lil niggas to buy what they want (woo)
And put they lil' bad ass in the bed early
And come in this room, I'ma break that ass off (yeah, ho)
All the hoes is bad
All the hoes is bad
All the hoes is bad
All the hoes is bad
All the hoes is bad
All the hoes is bad
All the hoes is bad
All the hoes is bad
