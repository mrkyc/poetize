It's a damn good thing talk is cheap
'Cause you can't afford the clothes you're wearin'
Daddy money, credit
Cut the card, someone's headed
Gotta flex on 'em
Brandy carry one size
Eatin' complex on 'em

Just another day it goes on, if it rains, if it pours
You still good with me, girl, I suppose
You be drinkin' every day in the dorm with your girls
It ain't good for your grades but you already know

It's a damn good thing talk is cheap
'Cause you clueless and you're mean
Regina Georges, fuck you, walk around like you the shit
Ain't nobody sayin' shit, I'ma keep it all the way lit

And I'm knowin' right now, you don't miss me
If you want, you can spend hella time with me
Just love and just kiss and confide in me
She arch her back and say it's all mine
I eat that pussy like it's dinner time
This that new McQueen, this is not your dream
You should've never been a bitch to me

Just another day it goes on, if it rains, if it pours
