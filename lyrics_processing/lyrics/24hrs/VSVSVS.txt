Nard & B
I love the Private Club
T-T-TrenchWerk

I got all these diamonds on me
VSVSVSVS
Look at all them diamonds on me
VSVSVSVS
Watch these diamonds do the Macarena
This brand new watch I call this shit Katrina
VSVSVSVS

Diamonds on me feel like Johnny Dang
The lean taste like some candy canes
Margiela with the ACNE
Paparazzi wan' tag me
I pop molly and party
I duck out wit my shawty
If I don't call you then call me
That's how it's supposed to be
That my lil' iced out shawty
I buy her that lil' Rollie
I got her the Mercedes
That's how it's supposed to be
We take flights out to Cabo
We buy diamonds on diamonds
We been climbin' and climbin'
This how it's supposed to be
She wan' go to New York
She wan' buy the new Porsche
She said Twenty come and fuck with me

She know designer my thing
Alexander McQueen
She said I sound like The-Dream
That's how it's supposed to be
Girl don't act like a fiend
You right out the magazine
Gucci Gucci your jeans
That's how it's supposed to be
I put ice on her bracelet
You could never replace it
She say she wanna taste it
That's how it's supposed to be
My baby she a diamond
That mean that pussy flawless
She gon' bust it for me
That's how it's supposed to be
She got gold in her mouth
She grew up right in the Valley
She wan' move out of Cali
That's how it's supposed to be
She wan' go to Atlanta
She said them girls got them asses
She wan' learn how to dance
That's how it's supposed to be
I got all these diamonds on me
