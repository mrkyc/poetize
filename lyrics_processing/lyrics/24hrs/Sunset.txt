Shit, heat up this Roscoe's... Starving... Where the gas at? Fire Shit... Phone rings Goddamn... Hello? What's up with you? What you on tonight? Shit... you might as well pull up on me! I ain't doin' shit, I just left the studio with this nigga Ty. Slick fucked up. You should meet me on Sunset
24hrs

Man, I told her meet me at the In-N-Out off of Sunset
Said she really need to smoke, she ain't havin' fun yet
I just moved to the city, I ain't got my gun yet
So you know I gotta watch my back 'cause niggas lurkin'
She a bad girl for certain, behind the curtains
Told my driver do some circles while she serve it
Told my young girl pay attention, she make me nervous
If she play it by the book she can have a purpose

I told her meet me off of Sunset
Before the sun go down
Before the weed get smoked
Before the food get cold
Meet me off of Sunset
Before Guitar Center close
Before my dawg gotta roll
Before the cops start to toll
Meet me off of Sunset
Meet me off of Sunset
Meet me off of Sunset
Meet me off of Sunset

Let her stay the night once, and she don't know how to act
Got the crib in Malibu with the ocean in the back
Playin' Ocean in the back while I'm lotionin' her back
Smokin' OG in the 'Lac, she might have a heart attack
Bet this dick gon' bring her back, watchin' Scarface on the flat
While I'm thumbin' through these racks, she know daddy got her back
She got 34C, I got the 30 on me
Love me, gotta show me, 24, you told me

I told her meet me off of Sunset
Before the sun go down
Before the weed get smoked
Before the food get cold
Meet me off of Sunset
Before Guitar Center close
Before my dawg gotta roll
Before the cops start to toll
Meet me off of Sunset
Meet me off of Sunset
Meet me off of Sunset
