Tony, Apex a boss, Apex a boss

Don't get caught up in the hype and forget
That the real ones that surround you is it
The money make me move, I'm aware
I die tomorrow, tell me, who gonna care?
Nobody, nobody, nobody
But the real ones that surround me
Nobody, nobody, nobody
But the real ones that surround me

Ralph, Lauren, money, pourin'
Studio, high as fuck 'cause Twenty recordin'
Made myself a boss, ask these niggas I'm employin'
Stop with all the questions, that shit get annoyin'
I've been through some shit that I may never talk about
I keep my shooter with me, she know what I'm talkin' 'bout
Don't tell a lot of y'all, figured I'd let you know
Tokyo made some millions, we ain't goin' broke
If we get a second chance, don't mean a damn thing
Saint Laurent, hit the toll with my bad thing
Shawty bad, she should get a hundred magazines
I put my family first, I swear that they mean everything
You might also like
Don't get caught up in the hype and forget
That the real ones that surround you is it
The money make me move, I'm aware
I die tomorrow, tell me, who gonna care?
Nobody, nobody, nobody
But the real ones that surround me
Nobody, nobody, nobody
But the real ones that surround me

Can't be wealthy 'til we makin' money while we sleep
Build a money mountain, man this shit is lookin' steep
They ain't believe in me
And now I'm so out of reach
I ain't know nothin' then, just how to be real
Niggas tried to use me, boy, I know how it feel
Contract fucked up, lawyer got me fucked up
Rolls Royce wanna buck, I ain't give 'em my fuck
Bossed up, got respect, still all 'bout the check
Free my nigga Yri, pray for my nigga Nef
That's a boss and I know that my dawg care for me
These other niggas swear that they didn't wanna share with me

Don't get caught up in the hype and forget
That the real ones that surround you is it
The money make me move, I'm aware
I die tomorrow, tell me, who gonna care?
Nobody, nobody, nobody
But the real ones that surround me
Nobody, nobody, nobody
