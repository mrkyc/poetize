You're in your feelings
He treats you wrong
You're all alone
Pick up the phone(Hello?)

He ain't never like this, I think that he been drinkin'
Lately we been arguing and I been feeling weak and
I be on the Aderall and playing all the weekend
Can I see you this weekend?
Can we try this one more time
Twenty, I was out my mind
Now I want you in my life
Heard that you's a good dude

I'mma show you love everytime
You can always ring my line
No matter what the issue is
You can always ring my line
Never ever too late

Ring, ring, ring, ring
Ring, ring, you ring my line
Ring, ring, ring, ring
Ring, ring, just ring my line
You might also like
He won't treat you like a queen
He won't put you in no bling
He won't let you do your thing
I'll let you do your thing
I bought you that new ring
I took you on the scene, girl
We had no roof all week
We had champagne in the room
We were fucking on the sink
I left all of my chains, I let you ride my mink
That nigga, he a lame
He won't ever let you speak
I wanna hear you talk so I can see how you think
And my phone always on, 'cause money always callin'
If you'd been with me, this would've never been a problem

I'mma show you life everytime
You can always ring my line
No matter what the issue is
You can always ring my line
Never ever too late

Ring, ring, ring, ring
Ring, ring, you ring my line
Ring, ring, ring, ring
Ring, ring, just ring my line
It's never too late
Never too late
It's never too late
Never too late
It's never too late
Never ever too late

Ring, ring, ring, ring
Ring, ring, you ring my line
Ring, ring, ring, ring
