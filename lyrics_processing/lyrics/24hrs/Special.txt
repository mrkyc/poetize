Got me hopin'
You ain't got me hopin'

I've been up to no good
I've been up to no good
I could barely text you
I could barely text you
I don't wanna stress you
I don't wanna stress you
You got somethin' special
You got somethin' special
You got somethin' special
You got somethin' special
Oh you got somethin' special
You got somethin' special

That ass needs a trophy
Love it how you fuck me
Fly you out the city
She wasn't fuckin' with me
Now I feel like Diddy
How I run my city
You got somethin' special
Ride me like a bike
They won't tell you nothin'
Them bitches be frontin'
Actin' like your homies
But they be all on me
Backwood in the Chevy
You ridin' beside me
You got somethin' special
Make me wanna fuck you
She went, bought them Nudies
Stretch marks on her booty
She gon' call me Twenty
She gon' call me Twenty
I know that she want me
I know that she want me
She take off them Vickies
Screamin', "Twenty hit me!"

I could barely text you
I could barely text you
I don't wanna stress you
I don't wanna stress you
You got somethin' special
You got somethin' special
You got somethin' special
You got somethin' special
Oh you got somethin' special
You got somethin' special

First class with the leg room
Condo with the best room
Better not read my message
All this time invested
Girl you know you're perfect
Girl you know I saved you
Tell 'em Twenty raised you
Met you off of Cascade
Had the J all crooked
Asked you for your number
Knew that you was with it
You got somethin' special
You got somethin' special
Oh you got somethin' special, girl
You know that you special
Oh you got somethin' special
Cause you got somethin' special
Oh you got somethin' special
Girl you know that you special
