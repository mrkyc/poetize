Knew me forever, since I was a shorty
She watched me grow up and she wants it
Knew me forever, since I was a shorty
She watched me grow up and she wants it
Knew me forever, since I was a shorty
She watched me grow up and she wants it

Fuck all the time, fuck all the time
Fuck all the time and she want it
Fuck all the time, fuck all the time
Fuck all the time and she want it

You made that trip to Calabasas
20, boy you drive the fastest
You copped your Saint Laurents
Think I'ma smash you from the front
You wanna be a model
I have Oscar take your photo, you gon' look like Wendy
You want me a baby
You gon' have to love me, you gon' have to trust me
For four days, we smoke weed, and go up
For three days, we sip lean and go down
For two days, we fuck crazy
You ride me all night to that Jodeci
You fuck me all night to that PND
And there ain't nothing wrong with you fucking all the time
You might also like
Fuck all the time, fuck all the time
Fuck all the time and she want it
Fuck all the time, fuck all the time
Fuck all the time and she want it

She touch down, I picked up, we smoke out
We do brunch, we count money for lunch
Ay 20, I know I'm aggressive
The way you fuck me is impressive
You show me a whole 'nother side
I call when the ride is outside
You fight with your mom about life shit
We fuck with no rubber, a crisis
You mad and you tripping, you liked it
I'm Batman, you Robin, my sidekick

Fuck all the time, fuck all the time
Fuck all the time and she want it
Fuck all the time, fuck all the time
Fuck all the time and she want it
Fuck all the time, fuck all the time
Fuck all the time and she want it
Fuck all the time, fuck all the time
Fuck all the time and she want it
