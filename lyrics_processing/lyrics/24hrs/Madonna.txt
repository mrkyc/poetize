24hrs
And you know it's Dwn2Earth
Oh, oh, oh

Me and Earth might hit your bitch in that new condo (oh-oh)
I got a plug on the gas in Arizona (ohh)
I got a white bitch I've been runnin' like Madonna (oh-oh)
I'm wearin' runnin' shoes 'cause I've been chasin' commas (ohh)
I spent a hundred and that's just on my lil mama (oh-oh)
I smoke the OG, mix it up with that Osama (ohh)
I'm wearin' runnin' shoes 'cause I've been chasin' commas
I'm wearin' runnin' shoes 'cause I've been chasin' commas

I've been smokin' weed on the daily
I've been makin' money on the daily
For a conversation, they gon' have to pay me
Don't cross the line and lil buddy gon' be gravy
Playin' YG in that '99 Mercedes
My lil  bitch say "20 going brazy"
My lil' chocolate bitch, she taste just like Godiva
She said, "20 this all you, this your vagina"
I told Pro I need some shows right out in China
I told Earth he worth a million when I signed him
I told TYO I need me that new Rollie
And he ain't fucked up 'bout no paper, that's my brodie

Lane switchin', M's twistin'
Benz flippin', ride an old school, candy paint drippin'
We stay eatin', Thanksgiving
No plates missin', I can't pump the breaks, no intermission
Money is the motive, change is the mission
Change on gold, Cartier my vision
Told her pull up to the condo
I might put her on trainin' like Alonzo
You can act like you don't know
You can try to act like you don't know
You know how the game go
And know when you with me know you cannot say my name love

Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah
