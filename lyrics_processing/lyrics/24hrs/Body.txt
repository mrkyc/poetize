24hrs, 24hrs
Move your body for 20
Oh move your body for 20

It should be a crime
The way you move your body, move your body
It should be a crime
The way you move your body, move your body
20, let me dance with you, 20 let me dance with you
20, let me dance with you, 20 let me dance with you

She been drinkin' rum
And I've been drinkin' Henny, baby I got plenty
Baby from the Bronx
She just moved to LA, she workin' on her body
20 havin' fun
20 get it done after 20 meet his son
And shawty from Colombia
I might move to Colombia

It should be a crime
The way you move your body, move your body
It should be a crime
The way you move your body, move your body
20, let me dance with you, 20 let me dance with you
20, let me dance with you, 20 let me dance with you

She was just dancin' in the party
20 pulled, all black Harley
I was smokin' weed like I'm Marley
Said I blow it for him but I call her Harley
20, I'm still in my prime
The way you twerk it baby, you should get a crime
Baby got Corona with the lime
Said "20 can you really be mine?"

It should be a crime
The way you move your body, move your body
It should be a crime
The way you move your body, move your body
20, let me dance with you, 20 let me dance with you
20, let me dance with you, 20 let me dance with you

It should be a crime
The way you move your body, move your body
It should be a crime
The way you move your body, move your body
20, let me dance with you, 20 let me dance with you
