You say you mad at me
I can't stay mad at you
She say she mad at me
She can't stay mad at me
Even when you say it's not the same
I don't wanna play these games

You say you mad at me
I can't stay mad at you
The way you make that face
Make me wanna come back to your place
She say she mad at me
She can't stay mad at me
'Cause even when you do
Somehow I keep linkin' up with you

Heard you wanna call it quits, damn it's your birthday
They saw you in the best when I saw you in the worst way
Pole in the room, I'ma put some money on you
Bally Backwoods, she done turned to a stoner
I didn't think you would change
I let you do your thing
Oh this shit different, it'll never be the same
When you with that nigga you be screamin' my name
Oh Lord, there you go, talkin' that shit again
Break up, made up quick, back on my dick again
I ain't think you would ever change on me
Only thing changed, 10 chains on me
Now you fucked up, now you all on your lonely
You might also like
You say you mad at me

The way you make that face
Make me wanna come back to your place
She say she mad at me
She can't stay mad at me
'Cause even when you do
Somehow I keep linkin' up with you

You know I am the one
Can't replace me with number two
Down to ride like we on the run
Old news, shit's never new
Last night we said we was done
You said it first, now who's the fool? Yeah
Is it me or you? Yeah
She just wanna ride my wave
I just wanna really parlay
One minute yellin' out, "Leave"
Next minute yellin' out, "Stay"
She ain't hit my line in days
Tweetin' 'bout how I changed
Twenty you not the same
You just wanna sleep in the bank"
You say you mad at me
I can't stay mad at you
The way you make that face
Make me wanna come back to your place
She say she mad at me
She can't stay mad at me
'Cause even when you do
Somehow I keep linkin' up with you
You say you mad at me
