I love the Private Club
24hrs and Mustard on the beat, ho

She got body like J. Lo
I got guns just like Halo
Wanna go to Phillipe's
You know Young Twenty ain't cheap
A couple nights at the Drake
I'm smokin' gas with a freak
She said, "You must love all them diamonds
Twenty bands on your teeth"

I put Gucci on her
She put pussy on me
She hope them lies ain't true
She just start fuckin' with me
I put Gucci on her
She put pussy on me
She hope them lies ain't true
She just start fuckin' with me

And if it was, would you turn me down?
And if it was, would you turn me down?
And if it was, would you turn me down?
And if it was, would you turn me down?

I got her a Mercedes
I made her my lil' lady
I made her smoke the gas
I made her clap that ass
I do Dickie's and Raf's
I was bad in my class
I count hunnids in math
I kept the purp in my stash
If it was, would you shut me down?
When we fuck, you want another round
CoCo Chanel, that's your favorite smell
Shoppin' sprees when she not feelin' well, woo!
Popped a Perk and we fuck crazy
J. Lo booty, roll that gas
Lamborghini, drivin' crazy
She said, "Twenty, fuck me fast"
Suck me up, don't suck me lazy
She say, "That shit don't amaze me
'Cause Twenty ate the pussy crazy"

I put Gucci on her
She put pussy on me
She hope them lies ain't true
She just start fuckin' with me

I put Gucci on her
She put pussy on me
When I hit it from the back
She say, "Put it all in me"
Her ex nigga was trash
And she left him for me
And I put her on them meds
I showed her how to scam, yeah
Now she gets high and finessin'
Shawty be runnin' them checks in
Shawty, she sound like my necklace
She look like them VVS'
Me and her out and we flexin'
She ride that dick like a Lexus (skrrt, skrrt)
I eat it up like it's seconds
I swear that pussy a blessin'
And her ass fat like she from Texas (she from Texas)
We be sippin' lean like we from Texas (lean!)
Swear I fall in love every time I see her naked
And she looked me right in my eyes
Asked me why I always lie
I put Gucci on her
She put pussy on me
She hope them lies ain't true
She just start fuckin' with me
I put Gucci on her
She put pussy on me
She hope them lies ain't true
She just start fuckin' with me
