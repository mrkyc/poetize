Everybody knows the war is over
And everybody knows the good guys lost
Everybody knows the fight was fixed
The poor stay poor and the rich get rich
That's how it goes
And everybody knows
Everybody knows that the boat is leaking
Everybody knows the captain lied
Everybody got this broken feeling
That their father or their dog just died
Everybody talkin' to their pockets
Everybody wants a box of chocolates
And a long stem rose
And everybody knows
Everybody knows, everybody knows
That's how it goes, and everybody knows
Everybody knows that you love me baby
Everybody knows that you really do
Everybody knows that you've been faithful
Give or take a night or two
Everbody knows that you've been discret
There were so many people you just had to meet
Without your clothes
And everybody knows
You might also likeEverybody knows that it's now or never
Everybody knows that it's me or you
Everybody knows that you live forever
When you've done a line or two
And everybody knows that the deal is rotten
Old black joe's still pickin' cotton
For your ribbons and bows
And everybody knows
Everybody knows, everybody knows
That's how it goes, and everybody knows
Everybody knows, everybody knows
That's how it goes, and everybody knows
Everbody knows that the plague is comin'
Everybody knows  it's movin' fast
Everybody knows that the naked man and woman
Are just a shining artifact of the past
Everybody knows that the scene is dead
But there's gonna be a meter on your bed
That will disclose
What everybody knows
Everybody knows that you're in trouble
Everybody knows what you've been through
From the bloody cross on top of calvary
To the beach at malibu
And everybody knows it's coming apart
Take one last look at this sacred heart
Before it blows
And everybody knows
Everybody knows, everybody knows
