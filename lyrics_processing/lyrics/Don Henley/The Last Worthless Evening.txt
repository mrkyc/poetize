I know you broke up with him
And your heart's still on the shelf
It's been over two years for me
And I'm still not quite myself
You can't be with someone new
And you can't go back to him
You're beginning to realize
That it's sink or swim

I see you around sometimes
And my heart just melts
You're lookin' like if you had your wish
You'd be somewhere else
And it just breaks my heart
To see you here this way
Someday, I'll get the nerve
To walk up to you and say

This is the last worthless evening
That you'll have to spend
Just gimme a chance
To show you how to love again
This is the last worthless evening
That you'll have to spend
'Cause I'll be there
When your broken heart is on the mend
You might also like
Every night, it's the same old crowd
In smoky rooms
You catch a faint glimpse of love sometimes
But it never blooms
And I've been around this block
A time or two
And I made some big mistakes
But girl, I promise you, I promise you

This is the last worthless evening
That you'll have to spend
Just gimme a chance
To show you how to love again
This is the last worthless evening
That you'll have to spend
'Cause it won't be long
'Til your little heart is on the mend
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

(Time, time, tickin', tickin', tickin' away)
(Time, time, tickin', tickin', tickin')
(Time, time, tickin', tickin', tickin' away)
(Time, time, tickin', tickin', tickin')
People inside their houses
With the shades pulled down
God knows we could use some romance
In this sleepy bedroom town
I know you're still afraid
To rush into anything
But there are just so many summers, babe
And just so many springs

And this is the last worthless evening
That you'll have to spend, baby
Just gimme a chance, gimme a chance
To show you love again
This is the last worthless evening
That you'll have to spend
'Cause it won't be long
'Til your little heart is on the mend
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, yeah

Uh-huh
That you'll have to spend
Just gimme a chance, darlin'
To show you how to love again, again
This is the last worthless evening
That you'll have to spend, yeah
'Cause it won't be long
'Til your broken heart is on the mend
Hey, hey, hey, hey, oh yeah
Uh-huh
