His friends all come to the funeral underdressed
They stuck around for an hour or so and then they left
But I couldn't take it personal, I laughed
I was dwelling on how time just goes so fast

And if I never do it better than the way I did before
I can live with that, it's whatever, I wouldn't trade it for the world

That's just the life I guess, and it's never what you expect
Everything's okay and then we die, but it couldn't be better
That's just the life you get, and nobody gives a shit
Every time it hits me I still cry, but it couldn't be better

In the end and after it all, there was nothing in general
You were my best friend, I was sad 'cause I knew that you didn't know
All the words we didn't say, all the time that slipped away
I wanna live inside those moments every day

And if we never do it better, than the way we did before
I could live with that, it's whatever, I wouldn't trade us for the world

That's just the life I guess, and it's never what you expect
Everything's okay and then we die, but it couldn't be better
That's just the life you get, and nobody gives a shit
Every time it hits me I still cry, but it couldn't be better

Things we didn't say, mistakes that we both made
None of that stays with me to this day
The one thing I remember, last year in December, you said "It's just a dress rehearsal anyway"
I say

If that's just the life we get and nobody gives a shit
Everything's okay and then we die
That's just the life I get, I guess I could live with it
