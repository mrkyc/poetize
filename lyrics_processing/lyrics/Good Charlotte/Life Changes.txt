Let's go now, it's open season

Going through these life changes
Gotta keep my feet moving
I'm looking up at the sky
Gotta keep my eyes open
Gonna keep my mind racing
I keep on trying to fly

We almost died
Learning how to survive the fast life

You know they say that nothing lasts forever
You know they said we'd never stay together
It's a long way down, can't turn back now
Going through these life changes
Going through these life changes
Let's go!

Yeah we always try to stand up to the lies
We said we'll never give up 'til we die
And try to help our friends, we learn to live again
We'll never say it's over 'til the end

You know they say that nothing lasts forever
You know they said we'd never stay together
It's a long way down, can't turn back now
Going through these life changes
Going through these life changes

Don't you know that life changes?
You know that love changes
The pain, it rearranges
Best friends become strangers
Don't you know that life changes?
You know that love changes
The pain, it rearranges
Best friends become strangers
So you get up and shake it off
Smile at everyone you meet
Put your best foot forward, chip on your shoulder
It's like you can't be beat
It's like we can't be beat
Going through these life changes
Going through these life changes

You know they say that nothing lasts forever
You know they said we'd never stay together
It's a long way down, can't turn back now
