When I think about my life, I
Wonder if I will survive to
Live to see 25, or will I just fall?
Like all my friends, they just keep dyin'
People 'round me always cryin'
In this place that I like to call my home

But not everybody knows that
Everybody goes to a better place
And not everybody knows that
Everybody could be living their last days
But the hard times will come
And we'll keep moving on, we're moving on

Keep moving on! Life! Hope! Truth! Trust!
And on and on! Faith! Pride! Love! Lust!
Keep moving on! On without the things we've lost!
And on and on! The things we've gained, we'll take with us!

And all's I've got are these two hands to
Make myself a better man, I
Wonder if I'll ever see the end of this
With all this rain, it just keeps falling
On my head, and now I'm calling
Out to someone else to help me make it through
You might also like
But not everybody knows that
Everybody goes to a better place
And not everybody knows that
Everybody could be living their last days
But the hard times will come
And we'll keep moving on, we're moving on

Keep moving on! Life! Hope! Truth! Trust!
And on and on! Faith! Pride! Love! Lust!
Keep moving on! Pain! Hate! Lies! Guilt!
And on and on! Laugh! Cry! Live! Die!

Keep moving on and on and on and on!
Some friends become enemies
And on and on and on and on!
Some friends become your family
On and on and on and on!
Make the best with what you're given
And on and on and on and on!
This ain't dyin', this is livin'

Said, "We're moving on
And we got nothing to prove
To anyone
'Cause we'll get through"
We're moving on and on and on and on and
On and on and on and on and
On and on and on and on and
On and on and on and on and
Keep moving on! Life! Hope! Truth! Trust!
And on and on! Faith! Pride! Love! Lust!
Keep moving on! Pain! Hate! Lies! Guilt!
And on and on! Laugh! Cry! Live! Die!

Keep moving on and on and on and on!
Some friends become enemies
And on and on and on and on!
Some friends become your family
On and on and on and on!
Make the best with what you're given
And on and on and on and on!
