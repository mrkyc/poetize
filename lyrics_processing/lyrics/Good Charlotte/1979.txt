Life was simple
Roger was working around the clock to make a living
No computers, none of that; he used his two hands
Ignored the cold war, his wife would keep him warm
On the weekends
He'd load the car up with his kids and they'd go fishing
No need to work an extra job, there's no recession
Damn right, he smiled a lot, they'd lay awake at night so in love

It was a good good year
The kids were alright
"Highway to Hell" beat up "Staying Alive"
The Clash was on the radio
And mom and dad were still in love in 1979
It was a good good year

In the morning
Robin always woke up early in the kitchen
She'd make the coffee, pack his lunch and then she'd kiss him
And he would hold her tight, when they were newlyweds
He'd say maybe
And she would laugh, they knew they'd have another baby
She'd slave away all day until dinner was ready
And they would dance so slow to "Just the Way You Are"

It was a good good year
The kids were alright

And mom and dad were still in love in 1979
It was a good good year

All the decades and the years have passed
Not every family is built to last
No time can take away these memories
Remember when you said to me, that we'd be alright

The kids were alright
"Highway to Hell" beat up "Staying Alive"
The Clash was on the radio
And mom and dad were still in love in 1979
It was a good good year

Disco couldn't survive
With the "Dream Police" and "Rock & Roll High"
Blondie put out "Heart of Glass"
And mom and dad bought their first house in 1979
It was a good good year
