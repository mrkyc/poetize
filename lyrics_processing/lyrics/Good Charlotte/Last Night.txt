Let's go

All that I remember is that you had me at hello
I knew right when I met her that I wouldn't take it slow
The more we heard the music, the more we got in synch
The more I kept you laughing, the less I stopped to think
The last thing I remember, you said this place is beat
It must have gotten crazy, 'cause I can't recall a thing

Last night (last night)
Can't remember (remember)
What happened? (What happened?)
Where'd we go?
I woke up (woke up)
This morning. (This morning)
Where's my car? Where's my keys? Where's my clothes?
I feel my head's still spinning
But I'm doing alright (hey)
'Cause I think I just had the best night of my life
Last night (last night)
Can't remember (remember)
What happened? Did it happen? Last night

Everyone's been calling like I've been gone for days
There's a note left on the table and all it says is "Thanks"
It's starting to get dark outside and I'm finally awake
I'm feeling kind of guilty. Is there something I can take?
There's lipstick on my collar. I'm piecing it together
Then I see a picture of me and you

Last night (last night)

And did I get the chance to say that I wanted you to stay?
There's things I can't explain, 'cause my brain don't work that way
Don't call this a one night stand. No, it wasn't planned
Wasn't in my head but I just want to do it again and again and again just like
Last night (last night)
