Does the sun shine on you every day wherever you are? Remember California
The things that we'd say, how special you are
And when you're sad, sad, sad, does anyone listen?
Do you feel like a diamond? I hope you feel like a million

Just forget the ones who let you go
Forget the ones too scared to know you

I'll be waiting here to show you how to come back home
Some things never change like the way I say I love you
And even when you still need time to grow if that's the only way you'll know
That some things never change like the way I say I love you

I hope it's summertime wherever you are, you're under the stars
Don't forget California, she's always there waiting for you
And when it gets bad, bad, bad, when life just gets so heavy
Remember that you're happy, don't forget to take it easy

And forget the ones who let you go
Forget those ones, yeah, they don't know you
You might also like
I'll be waiting here to show you how to come back home
Some things never change like the way I say I love you
And even when you still need time to grow if that's the only way you'll know
That some things never change like the way I say I love you

And I watch you come and go, yeah
These changing tides are all I've ever really known I've told you
And you run through life's unknown
The one thing you can always count on, I will always love you
I'll spend my lifetime trying to show you

I'll be waiting here to show you how to come back home
Some things never change like the way I say I love you
And even when you still need time to grow if that's the only way you'll know
That some things never change like the way I say I love you

Right through these unknown moments
Life's tides come and go
Right through these unknown moments
