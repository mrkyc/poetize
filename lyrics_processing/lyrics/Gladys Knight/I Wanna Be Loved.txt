Whenever I surrender my emotions
I thought that I could tell you how I feel
Whether good or bad, when I'm happy or sad
Why do I have to be the silent one
Whenever there is something on my mind
I thought that we were partners in this game of love
Why can't I laugh or cry and shed my feelings deep inside
I wanna be loved by somebody
Who's strong enough for me
I want to be free with my feelings
That's the way it's supposed to be
I'm willing to share my emotions
And give you what you need
Just don't turn away
If I say that I just want to be me, yeah
Why am I questioning where you are
It's just because I've made a few demands
Remember all the times we cried and I dried your tears
And how I held your hand if you do, please understand
I wanna be loved by somebody
Who's strong enough for me
I want to be free with my feelings
That's the way it's supposed to be

And give you what you need
Just don't turn away
If I say that I just want to be me
I want to cry tears of joy and not of pain
I want to share things that words can not explain
I don't want to go, I just need for you to know
That my love is sweet, but strong, so keep on holding on
'Cause I wanna be loved by somebody
Who's strong enough for me
I want to be free with my feelings
That's the way it's supposed to be
