'Cause your lips say this but your heart does that, oh oh
Well, maybe we're just wasting time, trying to pretend we're doing fine
But it's just a game trying to mend that patch
Something that fell apart sometime ago
Both of us know the truth, yeah, still a part of me can't let go
But I'm tired of been played, so where do we go from here
I expected more from you, baby, then what you could return
You said you're sorry and she's just a friend
But I say you lie so don't try to pretend
But you said we'd work it out but you never even tried
You said she meant nothing to ya
I say you lie, I said, I say you lie
For the things that I've heard, I guess they say we're absurd
Until you showed yourself to be someone else, oh yeah
Don't wanna leave feeling like I do
'Cause I've got things that I must say to you, baby
The trust I had for you before, just left and it ain't coming back no more
By the way that was me driving next to your car
I saw her kissing you and you kissed her right back
And there's much more than friendship when you're kissing like that

But I say you lie so don't try to pretend
But you said we'd work it out but you never even tried
You said she meant nothing to ya
I say you lie, I said, I say you lie
You lied about meeting me every minute of the day
You lied when you were kissing me and more than that I wanna say
You lied to our Heavenly Father, when you made your vows
I'll get over it 'cause I'm through with you, I'm gonna make it somehow
You said you're sorry and she's just a friend
But I say you lie so don't try to pretend
But you said we'd work it out but you never even tried
You said she meant nothing to ya
I say you lie
You said you're sorry and she's just a friend

But you said we'd work it out but you never even tried
You said she meant nothing to ya
I say you lie, I said, I say you lie
You said you're sorry and she's just a friend
But I say you lie so don't try to pretend
But you said we'd work it out but you never even tried
You said she meant nothing to ya
