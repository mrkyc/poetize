Baby, baby, baby, 'bout your plans to make me blue (how)
With some other girl you knew before (ohhhhhh)
Between the two of us girls ya know I love you more
It took me by surprise I must say (ohhhhhh)
When I found out yesterday (ohhhhhh)
Don't ya know that I heard it through the grapevine (Oh, I heard it through the grapevine)
Not much longer would you be mine (Not much longer would you be mine)
Oh, don't ya know that I heard it through the grapevine (Oh, I heard it through the grapevine)
And I'm just about, just about, just about, to lose my mind
Oh yes, I am, Oh yes, I am, Oh yes, I am
Baby won't you listen to me
Boy take a good look at these tears of mine
Baby, baby these tears I can't hold inside
Losin' you would end my life you see (ohhhhhh)
Because you mean that much to me
You could've told me yourself (ohhhhhh)
That you love some body else (ohhhhhh)
Instead I heard it through the grapevine (Oh, I heard it through the grapevine)
Oh-h, not much longer you be mine (Not much longer would you be mine)
Oh, I heard it (heard), yes, I heard it (heard it through the grapevine)
Oh, just about, just about, just about, to lose my mind
Oh yes, I am, Oh yes, I am, Oh yes, I am
