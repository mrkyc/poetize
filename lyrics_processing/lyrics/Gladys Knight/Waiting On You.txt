I'm waiting on you
I finished all my chores
Closed the windows, locked the doors
Trying to settle in for the night
Climbed the stairs and looked around
Slowly turned and came back down
I turned the TV on just for light
Something in my mind
Keeps telling me our love is strong
Give him just a little more time, you'll see
He's coming home
(He's coming home)
So I'm waiting on you
(I'm waiting on you)
To get through doin' what you had to do
So we two can get back to me and you
I'm waiting on you
(I'm waiting on you)
'Cause they have no idea how we got through
But you knew, that's why I'm waiting on you
(Sitting here, waiting on you)
See Gladys Knight LiveGet tickets as low as $83You might also likeI overheard your friends
(Your friends)
Making fun of all the things you did for me
To show how very much you care
I was proud to hear you say
(I love her)
"I love her in a special way
You just don't understand the love we share"
But they kept on talking till you went away
(Talking, talking, talking)
But I know your love will guide you back home someday
(Home someday)
I'm waiting on you
(I'm waiting on you)
To get through doin' what you had to do
(What you had to do)
So we two can get back to me and you
I'm waiting on you
(I'm waiting on you)
'Cause they have no idea what we've been through
But you knew, that's why I'm waiting on you, oh
(Sitting here, waiting on you)
I never got the chance to tell you in advance
About the life that's growing more inside of me
I'm glad you did not know, 'cause it left you free to go
And if you get back
(If you get back)
I know this is where you want to be
(I know this is where)
So I'm waiting on you
(I'm waiting on you)
To get through doin' what you had to do
So we two can get back to me and you
I'm waiting on you
(I'm waiting on you)
'Cause they have no idea what we've been through
But you knew, that's why I'm waiting on you
(I'm waiting on you)
To get through doin' what you had to do
So we two can get back to me and you
I'm waiting on you
(I'm waiting on you)
They have no idea how we got through
But you knew, that's why I'm waiting on you, oh
(Sitting here, waiting on you)
I'm waiting on you
(Waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting)
Patiently waiting on you
(I'm waiting on you)
Oh baby, come home to me, set me free
