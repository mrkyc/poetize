And I've done had some sleepless nights
And when I thought I'd just give up
I could turn to you 'cause you're the greatest love of all
There's no doubt, it feels so good I wanna shout
'Cause I know you'll be right there
I can turn to you 'cause your the greatest love of all
There was a time when everything I did
It never was good enough
And I've seen the moon and stars, maybe once or twice
But I never feel satisfied
So on this journey, I kept on searching
Until I came across a love that was greater than me
It's burning, this feeling so good in me, I can't believe
I made it through the hardest times
(Oh yeah)
And I've done had some sleepless nights
(Had some sleepless nights)
And when I thought I'd just give up
(Just give up, just give up)
I could turn to you 'cause you're the greatest love of all
(Greatest love of all)
