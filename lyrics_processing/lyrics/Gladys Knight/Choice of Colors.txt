A better day is coming
But you wait for me oh yeah, yeah
Alright, alright, alright, then he said
If you had a choice of colors
Which one would you choose my brothers
If there were no day or night
Which would you prefer to be right
How long have you hated your white teacher
Who told you to love your black preacher
Could you respect your brother's woman friend
And share with black folks not of kin
People must prove to the people
A better day is coming for you and for me
And with a little bit more education
With love for our nation will make a better society
Now some of us would rather cuss and make a fuss
Than to bring about a little trust
But we shall overcome our beliefs someday
If you will only listen to what I have to say
How long have you hated your white teacher
Who told you to love your black preacher
Can you respect your brother's woman friend
And share with black folks not of kin
