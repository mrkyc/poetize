(She was always giving us a warning)
Might be snakes there in that grass
(She was looking out')
Grandma's Hands
(I remember them well.)
Grandma's hands
Clapped in church on Sunday morning
Grandma's hands Played the tambourine so well
Grandma's hands Used to issue out a warning
She'd say "Gladys don't you run so fast!
Might fall on a piece of glass!
Might be snakes there in that grass!"
Grandma's hands
Grandma's hands Soothed a local unwed mother
Grandma's hands Used to ache sometimes and swell
Grandma's hands Used to lift her face and tell her
She'd say "Baby, Grandma understands
That you really love that man
Put yourself in Jesus' hands."
Grandma's hands
Couldn't wait till Sunday morning (oh baby don't you run so fast)
Cooking up that fried chicken
Smelling up the whole house

Grandma's hands
Ain't nothing like grandma's hands
Family is a gift of god
With this song I'd like to pay harness
To one of it's members
Over the years her importance has been diminished
Her image tarnished, but to me she'll always be a rare jewel
I've heard her called by many loving nicknames
Nana, Mimi, Mamaw, Big Mama, Poppi
But unlike millions of others, I simply call her Grandma
Ain't nothing like grandma's hands
Let me tell you this
Grandma's hands Used to hand me piece of candy
Grandma's hands Picked me up each time I fell
Grandma's hands Boy, they really came in handy
She'd say "Baby, don't you whip that boy !
What you want to spank him for?
He didn't drop no apple core !"
But I don't have Grandma anymore
If I get to heaven I'll look for'Grandma's Hands
Ain't nothing like grandma's hands
Used to hand me some candy
Grandma's hands Picked me up each time I fell
Grandma's hands Boy, they really came in handy
She'd say "Baby, don't you whip that boy!
What you want to whip him for?
He didn't drop no apple core!"
