Pretty baby, I know you're working hard for me
Darling, don't stay away too long
Pretty baby, save the overtime for me
I walk around, tryin' to find something to do
Baby, until your return
Turn on TV or play some solitaire
It does the job for a while
But nothing takes the place of you
Just ain't no substitute
'Cause you're all that I want in me
Only you can set me free
Darling, don't stay too long
Pretty baby, I know you're working hard for me
Darling, don't stay away too long
Pretty baby, save the overtime for me
My love starts to come down hard on me
And I just can't find no relief, no
Only until I see your face again
I'm gonna be in such misery
Runnin' to the door, peepin' out the window
Hopin' to see only you
Listen for the phone, checkin' out the tick tock
Countin' if it's a certain time
Hear me now, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
Darling, don't stay too long
Pretty baby, I know you're working hard for me
Darling, baby, don't stay away too long
Pretty baby, save the overtime for me, for me
Baby, baby, save the overtime
Save the overtime
I know you have your eight hours to do
But it just don't feel good without ya
Oh, how I'm missing you, oh, feelin' blue
I know it's crazy, but I, I walk around
Tryin' to find something else to do
Pretty baby, until your return
Turnin' on the TV, or play some solitaire
Does the job for a while
Find yourself runnin' to the door
Peepin' out the window, hopin' to see only you
Listen for the phone, checkin' out the clock
Countin' if it's a certain time
Hear me now, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
Darling, don't stay too long
Pretty baby, I know you're working hard for me
Darling, don't stay away too long
Pretty baby, save the overtime for me
Darling, don't stay too long
Pretty baby, I know you're working hard for me
