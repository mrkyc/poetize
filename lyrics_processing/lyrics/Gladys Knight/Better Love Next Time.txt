I wish I could have given you
Everything you need
The power to believe
The stuff that sets you free
I wish I was the answer to
Everything you want
Shelter from the storm
Somewhere to belong
It's not easy to make dream come true I know
So this much I wish for you before you go
Better Luck Next Time Baby
For all eternity
Even if its not with me
I wish you all that love could be
Maybe the next time baby
The sun will wanna shine
Seek and you will find
Better Luck
Next Time
I hope you find someone to give you
What I couldn't give
Though I just can't imagine
What that something is
I hope you wake up every day
With roses at your door
Someone to live for
A heart that knows for sure
But if I can't be the one to hold your hand
No sense stopping you
If there's someone who can

I wanna see you walk away with someone else
Wanna keep you here all to myself
Believe me if I could I would
(Believe me if I could I would)
Gonna take a lot of love to let you go
But anyone who ever loved like this would know
Oh they would know
