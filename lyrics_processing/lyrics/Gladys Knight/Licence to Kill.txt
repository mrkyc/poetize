Hey baby, thought you were the one who tried to run away
Ohh, baby, wasn't I the one who made you want to stay?
Please don't bet that you'll ever escape me
Once I get my sights on you

I got a licence to kill
(To kill)
And you know I'm going straight for your heart
(Got a licence to kill)
Got a licence to kill
(To kill)
Anyone who tries to tear us apart
(Got a licence to kill)
License to kill

Hey baby, think you need a friend to stand here by your side?
Yes you do
(Your side)
Ohh, baby, now you can depend on me to make things right
(Things right)
Please don't bet that you'll ever escape me
Once I get my sights on you
