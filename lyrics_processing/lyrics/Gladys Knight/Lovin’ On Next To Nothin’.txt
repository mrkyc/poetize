You're holdin' back on me
That ain't the way it used to be
You wanted me so much
Now I feel lucky if I get a touch
I don't know what's gotten in to you
But I can't believe all that you're puttin' me through
I'm lovin' on next to nothin'
(Lovin' on next to nothin')
There is no way that I can survive
I'm lovin' on next to nothin'
(Lovin' on next to nothin')
How am I supposed to stay alive?
You're gonna have to give me somethin'
(You're gonna have to give me somethin')
'Cause I can't go on lovin', lovin'
(Lovin', lovin')
Lovin' on next to nothin'
Remember how it was
(How it was)
Our days and nights were filled with love
I'm missin' what we had
(What we had)
You know I wanna get it back so bad
Come closer to me, baby, don't resist
'Cause I can't go on, I can't go on like this

Then I'm gonna have to find somebody else
'Cause I won't be leavin' my heart on the shelf
