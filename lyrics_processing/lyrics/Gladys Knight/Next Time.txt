Everything you need
The power to believe
The stuff that sets you free
I wish I was the answer to everything you want
Shelter from the storm, somewhere to belong
It's not easy to make dream come true I know
So this much I wish for you before you go
Better luck next time, baby
For all eternity even if it's not with me
I wish you all that love could be
Maybe the next time, baby the sun will wanna shine
Seek and you will find, better luck next time
I hope you find someone to give you
What I couldn't give
Though I just can't imagine
What that something is
I hope you wake up every day
With roses at your door
Someone to live for
A heart that knows for sure
But if I can't be the one to hold your hand
No sense stopping you
If there's someone who can

For all eternity
Even if it's not with me
I wish you all that love could be
Better luck next time, baby
The sun is gonna shine
Seek and you will find
Better luck
(Better luck next time)
I wanna see you walk away with someone else
Wanna keep you here all to myself
Believe me if I could I would
(Believe me if I could I would)
Gonna take a lot of love to let you go
But anyone who ever loved like this would know
Oh they would know
(Next time, baby, I hope that's what you get)
I hope that's what you get
(Remember me with no regrets
Live in peace and happiness)
Better luck next time, baby
Somewhere down the line
Seek and you will find
Better luck next time
