When love is a two-way street, you have to give something in this relationship
I'm all out of understanding
It's always something with you and all I got to say is this
Gave you the best, best years of my life
And I gave you a woman who stood by your side
All through your ups and downs, your rights, and all your wrongs
And God knows there were wrongs
I should've been long gone
But when I made you that promise for better or worse
I said I'd stay by your side
I swallowed my pride
And now you're asking me to understand
And I'm telling you I can't
Why should I care about your feelings
When you don't give a damn about mine?
Well, I don't want to know
I couldn't care less about your feelings
Don't you know you should've cared more about mine
And I don't want to know
It really doesn't matter why you're leaving
You should know you're really throwing away your life
And I won't sympathize
You've hurt me for the last time
Got no tears left to cry, baby

And a, a woman who loves you
We're sitting here falling apart
All through your ins and outs, your fears and all your doubts
God knows there's been doubts
But we've given you a home
And now you're throwing it away, baby
All for some girl born yesterday
And what about your children?
There's nothing to explain
But still you're asking us to understand
Well, I'm telling you we can't
Why should we care about your reasons
When you're walking right out of our lives?
And I don't want to know
I couldn't care less about your feelings
Don't you know you should've cared more about mine
And I don't want to know
It really doesn't matter why you're leaving
You should know you're really throwing away your life
And I won't sympathize
You've hurt me for the last time
Got no tears left to cry
Say goodbye to all the love and memories one last time
One good look at all the love that won't be in your life
Say goodbye
I hope that you'll be happy
Don't look back, 'cause it'll be too late
I've gone on with my life
And I don't want to know
I couldn't care less about your feelings
Oh, don't you know you should've cared more about mine
And I don't want to know
It really doesn't matter why you're leaving
You should know you're really throwing away your life
And I won't, I won't, I won't sympathize
You've hurt me for the very last time
I got no tears left to cry
And I don't want to know
I couldn't care less about your feelings
Don't you know you should've cared more about mine
And I don't want to know
It really doesn't matter why you're leaving
You, you should know you're really throwing away your life
And I won't, I won't, I won't sympathize
You've hurt me, hurt me, hurt me the last time
Got no tears left to cry
