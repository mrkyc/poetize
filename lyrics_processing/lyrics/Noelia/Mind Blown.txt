I, I know you love it, you, you say you love it
I, I know you love it, you, you say you love it
I, I know you love it
Tell me, what you want from me?
You say you love it but you don't
You don't know how to maintain
Now give it to me now
Turn it up a little bit
Turn it up a little louder
Make the crowd move a little bit
Till we meet the final hour
Everybody on the dance floor
Go hard till the light's on
Keep it glowing and we got to go
And we are going to like, like, like this
Now get your mind blown, mind blown, mind blown, mind blown
Now, now, now get your mind blown, mind blown
Mind blown, mind blown
Now, now, now get your mind blown, mind blown
Mind blown, mind blown
Now, now, now get your mind blown, mind blown
Mind blown, mind blown
You might also likeI wanna go somewhere
Where the music intoxicates the air
You are feeling high from the bass
Now everybody over up in here, turn it up
Get it rocking in the place
You just turn it up a little bit
Turn it up a little louder
Make the crowd move a little bit
Till we meet the final hour
Everybody on the dance floor
Go hard till the light's on
Keep it glowing and we got to go
And we are going like, like, like this
Now get your mind blown, mind blown, mind blown, mind blown
Now, now, now get your mind blown, mind blown
Mind blown, mind blown
Now, now, now get your mind blown, mind blown
Mind blown, mind blown
Now, now, now get your mind blown, mind blown
Mind blown, mind blown
