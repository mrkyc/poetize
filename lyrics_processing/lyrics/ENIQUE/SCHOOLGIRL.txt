Hey, baby, I'd say a thing or two
About how much I feel okay while I'm consumed by you, you should know
I love your mini-skirt, for me it's like a prison
I'm happy with no reason, When you with me I can't see anything
Except your lovely face
I know your mama says that imma fucking knobhead
Coz I bought a new shoes and I got no money in my pockets
All my friends think I could be arrested
Coz you're little girl that means a world for me already
I shoulda told you
That I might got truly feelings about you, baby

My sad being was kinda warmed
By your photos I hold on my phone
I guess...

It's not a secret that I have never thought
That the girl from the webcam would steal my heart this fast
Would make me cum 6 times a day
I'm about to tell ya, baby, that imma cheesed off, but then I see your face and everything goes back again
Shawty, you tired of me
Clothes, I made myself into it
I hope, you finally see that all
I do is scoffin'at you
You know, I'll stop flautin' unless
I start to see ya naked, baby, and I don't wanna break it
Already amazed me your smile so daisy, could you be my lady I wanna see daily your face by my side
For me it's nothing but the drug and I can't get enough
You know, I can't enough
