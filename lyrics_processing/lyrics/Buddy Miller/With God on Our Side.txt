Oh my name is nothing, my age it means less
The country I come from is called the Midwest
I was taught and brought up there, the laws to abide
And at the land that I live in has God on its side

Oh the history books tell it, they tell it so well
The cavalry charged, and the Indians fell
The cavalry charged, and the Indians died
Oh the country was young and with God on its side

Well, the Spanish-American war it had its days
And the civil war too, it was soon laid away
And the names of the heroes, I was taught to memorize
With guns in their hands, and God on their side

Oh the first World War, boys, it came and it went
The reason for fighting, I never did get
But I learned to accept it, and accept it with pride
'Cause you don't count the dead wars when God's on your side

When the Second World War, came to an end
We forgave the Germans and then we were friends
Though they murdered six million, in the ovens they fried
See, the Germans now too have God on their side
You might also like
I've learned to hate the Russians, all through my whole life
If another war comes, it's them we must fight
To hate them and fear them, to run and to hide
And accept it all bravely, with God on our side

But now we got weapons of chemical dust
If fire them we're forced to, then fire them we must
One push of the button, and a shot the worldwide
No, you never ask questions when God's on your side

In many dark hours, I've been thinkin' 'bout this
That Jesus Christ was betrayed by a kiss
But I can't think for you, oh you'll have to decide
Whether Judas Iscariot had God on his side

So now as I'm leavin', I'm weary as hell
The confusion I'm feelin', no tongue can tell
The words fill my head and they fall to the floor
