Did you think that if you watched me
I'd be just like the rest of them
Did you think that you could mold me scold me
Did you think that you could own me, yeah
Did you think that you could put a saddle on me
Show me ride me cloud me warn me you could control me
Tell me did you think I'd fit you like a bonnet with a little flower on it
Or a tear inside your sonnet
So much unspoken it will never be heard by you
Can you take it back
Can you make it go away
Wish I never knew this
I did everything you said
It all just turned to black
And I can't do this
Did you like the voodoo that I put now on you
When I slither in my closet, sweat vengeance like a faucet
Was I the only monkey junkie flunky who turned out to disappoint you
Honey
Yeah, I am
Did I stop computer porn cause you didn't turn me on
No, I didn't
Did I get tired of your shit and give you my fucking lip?
Yeah, I did

Can you take it back?
Can you make it go away?
Wish I never knew this
I did everything you said
It all just turned to black
And I can't do this
I'll stay on the freeway of the damned souls now
Wish I never knew this
The address that you gave me was too overrated
I can't do this
Tell me tell me did you think you'd catch me
Did you think that if you watched me
I'd be just like the rest of them
Can you take it back?
Can you make it go away?
Wish I never knew this
I did everything you said
It all just turned to black
And I can't do this
I'll stay on the freeway of the damned souls now
Wish I never knew this
The address that you gave me was too overrated
