When winter skies are gray
And I wait for the sun when all are one
I shall not betray
Calling at me, I'm waiting
When all are led astray
Carry on, my sons, forever
Carry on, when I am gone
Carry on for when the day is long
Forever carry on
For as long as we're together then
Forever carry on
Darkness all around us
We don't close our eyes
No-one's gonna ground us
We were born to fly
Coming at us, no stopping
Born to amplify
Carry on, my sons, forever
Carry on, when I am gone
Carry on, when the day is long
Forever carry on
For as long as we're together then
Forever carry on

Fight to stay alive
All the world can't change us
With all their burnt out jive
Come, get us
Now, we're waiting
We won't run and hide
Carry on, my sons, forever
Carry on, when I am gone
Carry on, when the day is long
Forever carry on
For as long as we're together then
Forever carry on
Now, we're all together
Let's sing a fighting song
One hundred thousand riders
We can't all be wrong
Coming at us, no stopping
Always carry on
Carry on, my sons, forever
Carry on, when I am gone
Carry on, when the day is long
Forever carry on
For as long as we're together then
Forever carry on

Carry on, my sons, forever
Carry on, when I am gone
Carry on, when the day is long
Forever carry on
For as long as we're together then
Forever carry on
Carry on, carry on, forever carry on
Carry on, carry on, forever carry on
Carry on, carry on, forever carry on
Carry on, carry on, forever carry on
