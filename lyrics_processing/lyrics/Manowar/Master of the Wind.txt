When all are fast asleep
I live inside a dream
Calling to your spirit
As a sail calls the wind
Hear the Angels sing
Far beyond the sun
Across the western sky
Reach to the blackness
Find a silver line
In a voice I whisper
A candle in the night
Will carry all our dreams
On a single beam of light
Close your eyes, look into the dream
Winds of change will winds of fortune bring
Fly away to a rainbow in the sky
Gold is at the end for each of us to find
There, the road begins where another one will end
Here, the four winds know
Who will break and who will bend
All to be the master of the wind

My life was written on the wind
Clouds above, clouds below
High ascend the dreams within
When the wind fills the sky
The clouds will move aside
And there will be the road
To all our dreams
And for any day that stings
Two better days it brings
Nothing is as bad as it seems
Close your eyes, look into the dream
Winds of change will winds of fortune bring
Fly away to a rainbow in the sky
Gold is at the end for each of us to find
There, the road begins where another one will end
Here, the four winds know
Who will break and who will bend
All to be the master of the wind
Fly away to a rainbow in the sky
Gold is at the end for each of us to find
There, the road begins where another one will end
Here, the four winds know
Who will break and who will bend
All to be the master of the wind
Fly away to a rainbow in the sky
Gold is at the end for each of us to find
There, the road begins where another one will end
Here, the four winds know
Who will break and who will bend
All to be the master of the wind
Fly away to a rainbow in the sky
