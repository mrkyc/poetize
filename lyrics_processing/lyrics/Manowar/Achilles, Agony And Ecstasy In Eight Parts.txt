See my chariot, run to your ships
I'll drive you back to the sea
You came here for gold, the wall will not hold
This day was promised to me
The Gods are my shield, my fate has been sealed
Lightning and javelins fly
Soon many will fall, we are storming the wall
Stones fall like snow from the sky
We will pay with our glory in the fire of battle
Zeus, today is mine
Killing all in my way like sheep and like cattle
Smashing skulls of all who defy
I spare not the hammer, I spare not the sword
This day will ring with my name
None have to chase me, let he who will face me
Kill me or die by the sword

Oh friend of mine, how to say goodbye?
This was your time, but the armor you wore was mine
I will not rest until Hector's blood is spilled
His bones will all be broken, dragged across the field
This, dear friend, is how we'll say goodbye
Until we meet in the sky

Here inside the walls of Troy, the Gods weigh my fate
From this day do I abstain, to a memory of hate
To pay for all the blood that spilled
Many thousands I did kill
No walls can contain the Gods' almighty will
I hear the silent voices, I cannot hide
The Gods leave no choices, so we all must die
Oh Achilles, let thy arrows fly, into the wind
Where eagles cross the sky
Today my mortal blood will mix with sand
It was foretold I will die by thy hand
Into Hades my soul descend

Cowards in the grip of fear, no valor to uphold
Cut into the earth, with honor long been sold
For all shall come to know me
As they fall unto their knees
Zeus the Thunderer, control my destiny
When the cards of life were dealt
My hand a ruthless fate
To avenge and bringeth fury
Hector, feel my hate
A bloodbath I was born to bring, by birth I'm an assassin
To cut the cord of life and death
Ties to earth unfasten
Blood and fire, death and hate
Your body I will desecrate
Dogs and vultures eat your flesh
The Hall of Hades waits
Kill...
Hector's blood lies on the battlefield
His body's mangled wounds
The Gods who once protected him are now his Gods of doom
Like a tower standing tall, steadfast in direction
I fall upon you bringing death, the Gods give no protection
Cowards in the grip of fear, no valor to uphold
Cut into the earth, with honor long been sold
For all shall come to know me
As they fall unto their knees
Zeus the Thunderer, control my destiny
Blood and fire death and hate
Your body I will desecrate
Dogs and vultures eat your flesh
The Hall of Hades waits
Die...

The oath of the Gods, this day was fulfilled
In the heat of the battle, Hector was killed
See him Patroclus, down in the dust
Rejoice in his death my symbol of trust
A dozen highborn youths have been killed
Cutting their throats, their blood was all spilled
Their bodies set at the foot of your fire
With oxen, sheep and two of your hounds
Your funeral pyre high off the ground
Hector's body dragged three times around
I will carry the torch to your funeral pyre
I will ask of the wind to send high your fire
Hector's blood will not be washed from my body
Until your body is burned
A prophecy spoken, a promise fulfilled
