Steel is strongest, so say we all
And if we all were not brothers of metal
Would we fall?
No
They tried to test our spirit
They tasted steel before we were done
Grinding their bones
Into the dust of the past
All blown away like a shot from a gun
We cast our lot together
Four still stand as one
Here we'll remain forever
Till our kingdoms fall
Brothers of metal
We are fighting with power and steel
Fighting for metal, that's all that's real
Brothers of metal will always be there
Standing together with hands in the air
Let us drink to the power, drink to the sound
Thunder and metal are shaking the ground
Drink to your brothers who are never to fall
We are brothers of metal, here in the hall
Our hearts are filled with metal
And masters, we have none
And we will die for metal
Metal heals, my son
