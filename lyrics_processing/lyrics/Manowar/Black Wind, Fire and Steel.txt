Full moon light is calling me, my kingdom lies within
The mystic soul and lion's heart brought by the talisman
The ecstasy of battle takes me where the falcons fly
Immortal youth was granted me, I will never die

Born of black wind, fire and steel
Born of black wind, fire and steel
Born to teach them all to heel
Born of black wind, fire and steel (steel, steel, steel)

Pounded by the hammers of the giants of the world
I can see in darkness, I'm the overlord
Single combat I await, my shadow brings them fear
The spikes upon my chariot will grind them when they're near

Born of black wind, fire and steel
Born of black wind, fire and steel
Born to teach them all to heel
Born of black wind, fire and steel (steel, steel, steel)

I am an outcast on the path of no return
Punisher and swordsman, I was born to burn
Black wind always follows where my black horse rides
Fire's in my soul and steel is on my side
