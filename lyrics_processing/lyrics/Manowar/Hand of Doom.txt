To crush all infidels who stray
Time to know the pain
But no time to run within
And these hands you see before you
Will end the light of day
Your ashes will be cast into the wind
Your blood's upon the soil
Your body fed to wolves
Not one of you will be left alive
Hear the sound pounding
And the army of the night
By the hammer of Thor
You now shall die
Tonight we strike
There is thunder in the sky
Together we'll fight
And some of us will die
We'll always remember
That we made a stand
And many will die by my hand
We are high atop a mountain
With hammers in the wind
Lusting for blood and death again
In a flash of lightning strike
Now, the house of death invites you
Body and soul to come within

You can run but never hide
I will hunt you down and
Tear you limb from limb
Nothing shall remain
Not your memory, your name
It will be as though you never ever lived
Tonight we strike
There is thunder in the sky
Together we'll fight
And some of us will die
We'll always remember
That we made a stand
And many will die by my hand
They will die
High atop the mountain
With hammers in the wind
Lusting for blood and death again
