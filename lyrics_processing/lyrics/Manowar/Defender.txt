When you are old enough to read these words, their meaning will unfold
These words are all that's left and though we've never met, my only son
I hope you know that I would have been there to watch you grow
But my call was heard and I did go
Now, your mission lies ahead of you as it did mine so long ago
To help the helpless ones who all look up to you
And to defend them to the end
Defender
Ride like the wind
Fight proud, my son
You're the defender
God has sent
Ride like the wind
Fight proud, my son
You're the defender
God has sent
Father, father, father
I look up to you and heed thy call
This letter ends my search
I'll live your dreams
Now passed onto me
And I now wait
To shake the hand of fate
Like the dusk awaiting dawn
So wizards, cast your spell
With no heart to do me well
So it is written, it shall be, yeah


Defender
Ride like the wind, ride like the wind
Fight proud, my son, fight proud, my son
You're the defender, you're the defender
God has sent, God has sent
Ride like the wind, ride like the wind
Fight proud, my son, fight proud, my son
You're the defender, you're the defender
God has sent, God has sent
Ride like the wind, ride like the wind
Fight proud, my son, fight proud, my son
You're the defender, you're the defender
God has sent, God has sent
Ride like the wind, ride like the wind
Fight proud, my son, fight proud, my son
You're the defender, you're the defender
God has sent, God has sent
Ride like the wind, ride like the wind
Fight proud, my son, fight proud, my son
You're the defender, you're the defender
God has sent, God has sent
Ride like the wind, ride like the wind
Fight proud, my son, fight proud, my son
You're the defender, you're the defender
