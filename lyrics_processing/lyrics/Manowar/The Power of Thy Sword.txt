Conquest by the rising sun
I'll wait for thy command
With flame and blood at hand
Glory and a broken sword
I'm the master of the world
I have no fear of man or beast
Born inside the soul of the world
Riding hard breaking bone
With steel and stone
Eternal might, I was born to wield
Let us drink to the battles
We've lived and we've fought
Celebrate the pain and havoc
We have wrought
Great heroes charge into the fight
From the north to the south
In the black of night
The clash of honour calls
To stand when others fall
Gods of war, feel
The power of my sword

Great heroes charge into the fight
From the north to the south
In the black of night
Fierce is my blade, fierce is my hate
Born to die in battle
I laugh at my fate
Now pay in blood
When your blood has been spilled
You're never forgiven
Death is fulfilled
The clash of honour calls
To stand when others fall
Gods of war, feel
The power of my sword
The clash of honour calls
The clash of honour calls
I will stand when others fall
I will stand when others fall
Open magic doors
Open magic doors
They will know the power of my sword
There is blood on my hands
There is blood in my eyes
With blood in my voice
I scream as you die
Thirsting of vengeance
And mounds of the slain
Shaking the forest onto the plain
Fierce is my blade, fierce is my hate
Born to die in battle
I laugh at my fate
Now pay in blood
When your blood has been spilled
You're never forgiven
Death is fulfilled
