Through this black night I pounder
The edge of our mighty swords did clash
Fallen by our axes, helmets smashed
Glory and fame, blood is our name
Souls full of thunder, hearts of steel
Killers of men, of warriors' friend
Sworn to avenge our fallen brothers
To the end
One day too, I may fall
I will enter Odin's hall
I will die, sword in hand
My name and my deeds
Will scorch the land
Glory and fame, blood is our name
Souls full of thunder, hearts of steel
Killers of men, of warriors' friend
Sworn to avenge our fallen brothers
Sons of the Gods
Today, we shall die
Open Valhalla's door
Let the battle begin
With swords in the wind
Hail Gods of war

Onward into the heart of the battle fought the sons of Odin
Outnumbered many times, still they fought on
Blood poured forth from their wounds deep into the earth
Vultures waited for the broken shells that once were bodies
But Odin alone would choose the day they would enter Valhalla
And in their hour of need
He sent forth onto them the berserker rage
Now Gods of men, they rose up from the ground
Screaming like wild animals, such is the gift of absolute power
No blade or weapon could harm them
They killed men and horses alike
And all who stood before them died that day
