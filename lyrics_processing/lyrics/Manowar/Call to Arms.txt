They will run for their lives
To the end, they will pay for their lies
So long did we wait
Now we are home
Here once again
There's a battle to fight
Gather together
For the sound and the might
So long did we wait
Now we are home
Now we will fight for the kingdom
Fighting with steel
Kill all of them, their blood is our seal
Fight till the last of the enemy is dead
Ride through their blood
That we gladly have shed
I now issue the call
Are you ready to fight?
Yeah
Fight altogether as one for the right
To be free once again
Tonight we will win

To fight and to die
Defenders of steel, now we are home
