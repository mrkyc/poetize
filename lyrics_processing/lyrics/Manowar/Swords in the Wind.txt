Odin, hear my call
One day I'll sit beside your throne
In Valhalla's great hall
Like so many before me
I'll die with honour and pride
The right of the warrior
Forever to fight by your side
Send a sign, raise the sail
Wave a last goodbye
Destiny is calling
Immortality, be mine
Call the witch to cast the ruins
Weave a magic spell
We who die in battle are born
Not for Heaven, not for Hell
We are sons of Odin
The fire we burn inside
Is the legacy of warrior kings
Who reign above in the sky
I will lead the charge
My sword into the wind
Sons of Odin fight to die and live again
Viking ships cross the sea
In cold wind and rain
Sail into the black of night
Magic stars are guiding light

Upon my weapons will never dry
Many I'll send to the ground
Laughing as they die
We are sons of Odin
The fire we burn inside
Is the legacy of warrior kings
Who reign above in the sky
I will lead the charge
My sword into the wind
Sons of Odin fight to die and live again
Viking ships cross the sea
In cold wind and rain
Sail into the black of night
Magic stars are guiding light
Place my body on a ship
And burn it in the sea
Let my spirit rise
Valkyries carry me
Take me to Valhalla
Where my brothers wait for me
Fires burn into the sky
My spirit will never die
I will lead the charge
My sword into the wind
Sons of Odin fight to die and live again
Viking ships cross the sea
In cold wind and rain
Sail into the black of night
Magic stars are guiding light
I will lead the charge
My sword into the wind
Sons of Odin fight to die and live again
Viking ships cross the sea
In cold wind and rain
Sail into the black of night
