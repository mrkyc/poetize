And darkness, all across the earth
Then came the wind and a hole in the sky
Thunder and lightning came crashing down
Hit the earth and split the ground
Fire burnt high in the sky
From down below, fire melted the stone
The ground shook and started to pound
The Gods made heavy metal
And they saw that it was good
They said to play it louder than Hell
We promised that we would
When losers say it's over with
You know that it's a lie
The Gods made heavy metal
And it's never gonna die
We are the true believers
It's our turn to show the world
In the fire of heavy metal we were burnt
It's more than our religion
It's the only way to live
But the enemies of metal, we can't forgive
