Here our soldiers stand
From all around the world
Waiting in a line
To hear the battle cry
All are gathered here
Victory is near
The sound will fill the hall
Bringing power to us all

We alone are fighting
For metal that is true
We own the right, to live the fight
We're here for all of you
Now swear the blood upon your steel
Will never dry
Stand and fight together
Beneath the metal sky

Brothers everywhere
Raise your hands into the air
We're warriors, warriors of the world
Like thunder from the sky
Sworn to fight and die
We're warriors, warriors of the world

Many stand against us
But they will never win
We said we would return
And here we are again
To bring them all destruction
Suffering, and pain
We are the hammer of the Gods
We are thunder, wind, and rain

There they wait in fear
With swords in feeble hands
With dreams to be a king
First, one should be a man
I call about and charge them all
With a life that is a lie
And in their final hour
They shall confess before they die

Brothers everywhere
Raise your hands into the air
We're warriors, warriors of the world
Like thunder from the sky
Sworn to fight and die
We're warriors, warriors of the world
If I should fall in battle
My brothers who fight by my side
Gather my horse and weapons
Tell my family how I died
Until then I will be strong
I will fight for all that is real
All who stand in my way will die by steel

Brothers everywhere
Raise your hands into the air
We're warriors, warriors of the world
Brothers everywhere
Raise your hands into the air
We're warriors, warriors of the world
Like thunder from the sky
Sworn to fight and die
We're warriors, warriors of the world
Brothers everywhere
Raise your hands into the air
We're warriors, warriors of the world

Raise your hands into the air
We're warriors, warriors of the world

Sworn to fight and die

Raise your hands into the air
We're warriors, warriors of the world
Brothers everywhere
