It's heard across the sea
You'll only hear it
If you listen with your hearts
And one day hope to be free
To hear the sound of freedom
Many gave their lives
They fought for you and me
Those memories will
Always live inside us
And now, it's our time to be free
Where the eagles fly
I will soon be there
If you want to
Come along with me, my friend
Say the words and you'll be free
From the mountains to the sea
We'll fight for freedom again
So ring out loud for all the world to hear
From the sea to shining sea
Let freedom ring and every man be king
To live as one through the year
