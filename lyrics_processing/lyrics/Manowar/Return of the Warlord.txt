When all is said and done
We're back together on the road
It's time to fly
No more time to wait
You know it feels so great
Wearing leather on a horse of steel
I ride
I ain't waiting to get old
I'm running hot, I'm never cold
Kiss my ass if you don't like me
I don't care
I got my wheels, I got my friends
We're on the road again
We're all crazy
Gonna ride until we die
Time to burn
You losers better learn
No-one controls our goddamn lives
We'll do just what we feel
Riding horses made of steel
We're here to burn up the night
Losers try to put us down
It's just another day
I got no money or big house
Just got life
I don't like to save, it's more fun to spend
If you like metal, you're my friend
And that bike out in the yard
Well, that's my wife

My family never will
Had to punch my teacher out
Now he's chilled
I might stay in school or die in prison
Either way, it's my decision
One more beer and heavy metal
And I'm just fine
Time to burn
You losers better learn
No-one controls our goddamn lives
We'll do just what we feel
Riding horses made of steel
We're here to burn up the night
We are the undefeated
We're not living in the past
We're here tonight to kick some goddamn ass
Feel the power of the wheel
Let's drink to riding steel
Living hard and riding fast
Time to burn
You losers better learn
No-one controls our goddamn lives
We'll do just what we feel
Riding horses made of steel
We're here to burn up the night
Time to burn
You losers better learn
No-one controls our goddamn lives
We'll do just what we feel
Riding horses made of steel
We're here to burn up the night
Time to burn
You losers better learn
No-one controls our goddamn lives
We'll do just what we feel
Riding horses made of steel
We're here to burn up the night
Time to burn
You losers better learn
No-one controls our goddamn lives
We'll do just what we feel
Riding horses made of steel
