Till I got, got a lot more to give
I thank the Lord for letting me stay around a little longer
Lord knows I love the life I live
This old road's been so good to me
I've been given much more than I ever dreamed
I won't ever stop playing these blues
That's what I think He put me here to do
I thank the Lord for letting me stay around a little longer
Feel like I've got a lot more to give
I thank the Lord for letting me stay around a little longer
Lord knows I love the life I live
So many good friends I've lost along the way
I know I'll meet 'em again on some uncloudy day
Until then there's more songs to be sung
We've come a long way but we're a long way from being done
I thank the Lord
I thank the Lord for letting me stay around a little longer
But I feel like I got a lot more to give
I thank the Lord for letting me stay around a little longer
Lord knows I love the life I live
Thank You, Lord, I love the life I live
