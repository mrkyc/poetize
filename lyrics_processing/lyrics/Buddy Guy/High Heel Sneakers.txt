Put on your red dress baby, honey we're goin' out tonight
Want you to wear your boxin' gloves in case some fool might want to fight
Put on your high heel sneakers, throw that wig hat on your head
Put on your high heel sneakers, throw that wig hat on your head
Honey I know you're gonna get real high, honey I know you're gonna knock 'em dead
Want you to talk to me baby, Mama and hold me tight
Keep on holdin me baby, until you hold me just right
Put on your high-red dress mama, wear your wig-hat on your head
I want you to hold your head kinda high because I know your gonna knock em dead
Put on your white boots baby, pull em up on your legs so high
Put on your white boots baby, pull em up on your legs so high
I want you to look real good, you better even hide your thigh
Lord I want you to call my name this morning, call it sort of sweet and low
And make me think little darling, Lord I'm on the third floor!
Put on your high heel sneakers, wear that wig hat on your head
I want you to raise your dress real high because I know your gonna knock em dead
Raise your window woman, raise it soft and slow
See your man down there could be
You may don't know, anh-uh
Girl I ain't going out that do'
Oh, I see your man downstairs--
Look like your man, how do I know?
Could be yo' man, how do I know?
