They all know my name
I can't get a woman
So I sit beside the stage
I think Heather really likes me
As she wiggles in my face
Takes my forty dollars
Turns and walks away
Ain't love strange
They honeymooned a week or two
Until the thrill was gone
Now down the street those newlyweds
Been fighting all night long
Through a hail of flying dishes
The police finally came
They hauled 'em off in separate cars
With cuff and ankle chains
Ain't love strange
Ain't love stra-a-a-a-a-a-ange
Ain't love strange
Ain't love stra-a-a-a-a-a-ange
Ain't love strange
Two gay nympho Quakers
On the Jerry Springer show
Came strutting out in lingerie
To let their family know
Their daddy lost his temper
When they walked out on the stage
Their mama said, "I love my sons
No matter how they've changed"
Ain't love strange
Ten roosters in the barnyard
And just one little hen
They jockey for position
By c***-a-doodle-in'
They flap their wings
And strut around
Sometimes they fight all day
Those fresh eggs ain't the only thing
That's needing to get laid
Ain't love strange
Ain't love stra-a-a-a-a-a-ange
Ain't love strange
Ain't love stra-a-a-a-a-a-ange
Ain't love strange
Now God and mama
Will love you unconditionally
Your woman will love you
If you're faithful
Your dog will love you
If you throw him a bone
The devil will love you
If you sin
Your children will love you
If you buy them some candy
And I will love you
If you put on that
Blue and white polka-dot miniskirt
With black stiletto heels
And just let me sit back
And watch you do an interpretive dance
To this little groove I got going, one, two
Ain't love strange
Ain't love stra-a-a-a-a-a-ange
Ain't love strange
Ain't love stra-a-a-a-a-a-ange
Ain't love strange
I can't figure it
Ain't love stra-a-a-a-a-a-ange
Ain't love strange
