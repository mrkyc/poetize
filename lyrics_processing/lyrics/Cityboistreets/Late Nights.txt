All along it was set up who would have thought it was it was this chick that I just met up. but I played my role they didn't know I had the nine when they turned I had to let it go   next thing they heard was a shot but I pulled off of the block with my hands upon my Glock they tried to chase me down the block did I banged a left real quick and made it straight right to the block in my mind I was thinking bout my lady and how i have to be there for my baby after there was no follow so I dip with no sorrow then i made it to my shorty with problems  only
