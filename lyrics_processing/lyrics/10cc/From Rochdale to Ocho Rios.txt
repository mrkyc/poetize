From Dorking it's back to Rochdale
From Rochdale to Ocho Rios

You spend half your life in transit
But that's just the way God plans it
Pack a shirt and some fresh pajamas
That's all you need

Tried to get a flight out to San Juan
But Air Jamaica don't fly on Sunday
Gotta get a flight out to San Juan
Because I wanna see the Mama and the Papa

When I look into your blue eyes
I bend the truth but I never tell you lies
I need my lover, I need your care
Understanding's not enough to make it fair

Asleep in a stream of sunlight
Awake in a dream at midnight
I'm rushing to wait for jumbo
Oh where am I now

But Air Jamaica don't fly on Sunday
Gotta get a flight out to San Juan
Because I wanna see the Mama and the Papa

A dressing room so far from home
A corridor with a broken telephone
I wanna call but I got to go
The curtain's up and it's time to do the show
Show time!

I just got in to the city
Yeah, it's so insane
Bu-but the man in a suitcase
Is on the road again

Tried to get a flight out to San Juan
But Air Jamaica don't fly on Sunday
Gotta get a flight out to San Juan
Because I wanna see the Mama and the Papa
Asleep in a stream of sunlight
Awake in a dream at midnight
I'm rushing to wait for jumbo
Oh where am I now

You spend half your life in transit
But that's just the way God plans it
Pack a shirt and some fresh pajamas
That's all you need
Everybody sing!
