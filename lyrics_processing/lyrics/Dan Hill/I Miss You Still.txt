The world seemed oh so young and we were so self assured
No one ever could come between us
Remember stepping out
Behind the high school, cutting class
Making love beneath the stars
You were my Venus
Where does all the time go?
Look at us now
Caught up in our different worlds
Though we gone our separate ways I found
I miss you still
It's the middle of the night and I'm calling you
Cause I can't hold back what I feel inside
I miss you still
Your a piece of my heart that I can't let go
Though it tears me apart, you should know
That I miss you still
You remember when
You said I'd always be your man
How you reached out for my hand
Your fingers trembled
How your daddy hated me
How it drove him to distraction
That was part of the attraction
Way back when girl
Where do the years go
It seems like yesterday
Well God this world seems different now
Maybe some things, some things never change
You might also likeI miss you still
It's the middle of the night and I'm calling you
Cause I can't hold back what I feel inside
I miss you still
Cause your a piece of my heart that I can't let go
Though it tears me apart, you should know
That I miss you still
Maybe I'm a sentimental fool who's lost control
I just close my eyes and memories of you cut into my soul
I miss you still
It's the middle of the night and I'm calling you
Cause I can't hold back what I feel inside
I miss you still
Your a piece of my heart that I can't let go
Though it tears me apart, you should know
That I miss you still
After all these years
Of singing through these tears
That memories could kill
You know I miss you
