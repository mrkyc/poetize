Do you believe in the power from above? I feel it between you and me
And I don't have to look in your eyes to know
There's something going on here that's out of our control
This is happening too fast for us to fight
There's a healing power (healing power) deep in all of us
In the darkest hour (darkest hour) we can still rise up (still rise up)
There's a new horizon shining between you and me
When you slip your hand in mine, I feel the rub of the healing power of love
(healing power)
And we got nothing but love to pull us through
Love and compassion (ooh, love and compassion)
But in this desperation world nothing else will do
Oh, we can make it happen (only we can make it happen)
And you don't have to say a word, I understand (I am yours only)
When you lay down, your love lasts forever (waiting forever)
You will always be my woman, and I will be your man
There's a healing power (healing power) deep in all of us
In the darkest hour (darkest hour) we can still rise up (still rise up)
There's a new horizon shining between you and me
When you slip your hand in mine, I feel the rush of the healing power of love
Deep in the night, when we're so alone, I swear I feel the power that's
Greater than our own
And how a love unfolds as we tumble through the darkness to the great unknown
