She said, "All I want is someone
Who can take me as I am
Someone strong enough to be gentle
Someone warm enough to be a friend"

Her dress was black as the night was hot
Her eyes so green they could kill you
And the hotel room felt old
And frighteningly familiar

She asked him for a cigarette
He asked her for her name
She said, "Call me anything you want
Makes no difference anyway"

Her anger flared like lighting fire
Her brown skin young but aging fast
And the old man clung to her distance
Tried to drink from an empty glass

Tell me does anyone break through to you
"Seldom but I never tell them if they do"
Outside a siren screamed and she began to shake
She sat frozen in the night like there was no escape
There was no escape
You might also like
She turned off the lights and somewhere
In the darkness flashed a gun
She said, "You know what I'm after
I don't wanna hurt no one"

As money fell to the hardened floor
The old man cursed his silence
And the moon shot down so softly
In mock defiance

He stared out the windows
While she fumbled for the door
Then the old man put his clothes back on
Though he didn't know what for

Her dress was black as the night was hot
Her eyes so green they could kill you
And the hotel room grew cold
And suddenly unfamiliar

Tell me does anyone break through to you
"Seldom but I never tell them if they do"
Outside a siren screamed just a bit too late
The old man sat frozen in the night like there was no escape
There was no escape
Tell me does anyone break through to you
"Seldom but I never tell them if they do"
Outside a siren screamed just a bit too late
The old man sat frozen in the night like there was no escape
