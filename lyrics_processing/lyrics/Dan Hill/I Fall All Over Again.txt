Can't believe we met like this
Is it just coincidence?
I had a feeling I'd be seeing you again
You're every bit as beautiful
As the last time we met
When you told me you were leaving
And going back to him

How I wish that I could tell you
It's all in the past
But I was never good at lying
And baby since you ask

I don't wanna hear that song again
From the night we first met
I don't wanna hear you whispering
Things I'd rather forget
I don't wanna look into your eyes
'Cause you know what happens next
We'll be making love and then
I fall all over again

I can't begin to tell you
Just how sorry I am
That the man you built your dreams around
Just broke your heart again
I think I know the feeling
'Cause I once loved you so much
That I swore I'd rather die than live
A day without your touch
You might also like
If I held you in my arms, you know
I'd never let you go
But this ain't the time or place
To get emotional

I don't wanna hear that song again
From the night we first met
I don't wanna hear you whispering
Things I'd rather forget
I don't wanna look into your eyes
'Cause you know what happens next
We'll be making love and then
I fall all over again

How you cried when you kissed me
Then you walked out that door, ohhh
You were always such a mystery
I still dream we're making love
Then I stop myself because

I don't wanna hear that song again
From the night we first met
I don't wanna hear you whispering
Things I'd rather forget
I don't wanna look into your eyes
'Cause you know what happens next
We'll be making love and then
I fall all over again
