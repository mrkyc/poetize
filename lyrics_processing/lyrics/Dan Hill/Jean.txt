When I first came to Vancouver with drea-eams twisting in fear-ear
And oh Jea-ea-ean, friends are like rare stones
Increasing in their value when realized they can't be owned
And I'd write songs only when the pain became too obvious inside
When the screaming in my sou-ou-oul left me no-o place to hi-ide
And woh-oh Jea-ea-ean, love is li-ike a prayer
So afraid of your own questions as you stand unanswered there-ere-ere
Still you wa-alk the other way rather than risk rejection
Watch the wind blow all hope away as you crawl into yourself for protection
Still I try to make you see there's so much more I've gotta be
Oh don't turn away, don't lose to the cold, don't leave me here-ere to die-ie alo-one
A little of your love couldn't hur-urt me none
Let it shine on through like rays from the su-un
And a little of my love couldn't hurt you none
Let it run beside you, let it flow inside you, let it purify-y-y-y-y-y
You-ou break down and I stumble for the right words of consolation
The circle of love spins rou-ound and round searchin' for new destinations
Woh-oh Jea-ea-ean, life is li-ike the sea-ea
Trapped within it's shoreli-ines we're still strugglin' to break free-ee-ee
Still we wa-alk the other way rather than risk rejection
Watch the wind blow all hope away as we crawl into ouselves for protection
Still I try to make you see, I love you so it frightens me
Woh, don't turn away, don't lose to the cold, nobody wa-ants to die-ie alo-one

Let it shine on through like rays from the su-un
And a little of my love couldn't hur-urt you no-one
Let it run beside you, let it flow inside you
