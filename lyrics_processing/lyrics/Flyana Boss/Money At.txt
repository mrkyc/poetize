Big cheddar, where my motherfuckin' money at?
Fuck a suit, sippin' Goose in a Pontiac
From the floor to the roof, better run it back

Make a bitch arch back like nemesis
Let it slide, I would never, sis
Tryna make lemonade, where my lemons is

Big like a beluga ever since I blew up, bazooka
Big bag, all my bitches been bad
Wishin' that you Sinbad, I'ma hit a lick like a rich snack
