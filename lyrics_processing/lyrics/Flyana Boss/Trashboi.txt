I met him in the summer, so charmin', so sweet
We went out to dinner, dessert was on me
Fallin' so deeply, was too blind to see
All these other bitches was thinkin' the same thing
Oh shit, guess I made my own bed
It was red flag after red flag after red flag after red
Damn, he was perfect, thought it would be worth it
Turns out he needed a clown for his circus

He talk about kids, but cannot commit
He say he my man, but textin' my friend
If I could go back, I would block his ass
Finally, I'm seeing

That boy is trash, yeah
He don't even text me back, no
And he be making me mad, yeah
Wish I ain't give him a chance, ooh, trash
Trash, yeah
He don't even text me back, no
And he be making me mad, yeah
Wish I ain't give him a chance, ooh, trash
You might also like
I been too dick-motized to realize
That I was the prize the whole fuckin' time
Excuses I made for this trifling-ass nigga
Now he put the blame on me, uh, go figure
But don't pity me, put the pity on him
To lose a queen, checkmate, that's the end
Send him back to the streets, take him out to the curb
You get what you accept, girl, not what you deserve

He stay talkin' shit, he don't pay no rent
He seems to forget that I am that bitch
If I could go back, I would block his ass
Finally, I'm seeing

That boy is trash, yeah
He don't even text me back, no
And he be making me mad, yeah
Wish I ain't give him a chance, ooh, trash
Trash, yeah
He don't even text me back, no
And he be making me mad, yeah
