I'ma ride it with no hands, call it magic (Woo)
Braids to my booty, make me feel like I'm the man
Can you believe I feel that way? Well, I can
I been gone so long, I been taking months off
I been lighting incense, good energy on my wish list
Initiated like shark bait, cleaning out my fish tank
Booty poppin' like Charmin, jump on your couch like I'm Rick James (Bitch)

Yeah, I'm sippin' (Yeah, I'm sippin')
On kombucha (On kombucha)

Hold on to my self-control
Unbothered as I am
If you the right one, I could give a damn
I want a dude that can do both
I need a thug (Yuh, yuh) and a monk (Yuh)
That Tupac and nirvana, I can train your monkey mind
All we have is now, so let's not waste our time
I ain't got time for the hate, I don't want the suffering
So if I didn't send for you, don't you ever come for me
