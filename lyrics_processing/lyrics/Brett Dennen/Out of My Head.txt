Get outta my head, get into my heart
Get outta my head, outta my head, outta my now
Get outta my head, get into my heart
Without you I do believe I'm homeless and without
And without you, it's true. I'm out of focus
Got go now, I know now if I can can't live with you I will
Without me you'll be stuck in a pattern and without me, you'll see
It doesn't matter who you're made at
I've had that happen and I won't have that happen anymore
Why don't it go boom boom boom
Give me love, give me love, give me love now
Boom boom boom
Any you get it back and you get it back
Get outta my head, outta my head, outta my head, head now
Get outta my head, outta my head, outta my no, get into my heart
Get outta my head, outta my head, outta my head, head now
Get outta of my head, outta my head, outta my no, get into my heart
Get into my heart
Thought I'd changed inside
So I went up into the mountains and climbed
I got away from all the static and the sadness
I won't be caught up in that anymore
You might also likeWhy don't it go, boom boom boom
Give me love, give me love, give me love now
Boom boom boom
And you get it back, and you get it
Boom boom boom
Give me love, give me love, give me love now
Boom boom boom
And you get it back, and you get it
Get outta my head, outta my head, outta my head now
Get outta my head, get into my heart
Get outta my head, outta my head, outta my now
Get outta my head, get into my heart
Outta my head, outta my head
Out of my head, no
Get outta my head, outta my head, outta my head, head
Get outta of my head, no
Get outta my head, no
Get outta my head, outta my head, outta my head now
Get outta my head, get into my heart
Get outta my head, outta my head, outta my now
