And the stars named you moon child
Then you come you rise into my sky
You stepped in front of my sun and it makes the whole world dark
And you light up the night
Just like the moon
Just like the moon you light up the night
And sometimes
Sometimes I only get a sliver of ya
But I'm hoping
I'm hoping for a full moon tonight
Laid back and I'm restless in the daytime
And I'm chased by these shadows
Oh thay're haunting me
Then you come with nighttimes' wooly blanket
And you wrap me like a child
Who's been in the rain too long
And you light up the night
Just like the moon just like the moon
You light up the night
And sometimes
Sometimes I only get a sliver of ya
But I'm hoping
I'm hoping for a full moon tonight
You might also likeOh I've chased the moon
You know I've tried
And each time I tried
Each time I failed
And each time I get so down on myself
And I can't stand this pace of a snail
While the rest of the world...
You know I, I know I
Know I know that I can
Probably never be the same
Cause you light up the night
Just like the moon
Just like the moon you light up the night
And sometimes
Sometimes I only get a sliver of ya
But I'm hoping
I'm hoping for a full moon tonight
And in the night
I can feel you love light shinning bright
Falling down on me like autumn leaves
And in the night
I can see you shinning bright
Tell me how am I supposed to fall asleep
And in the night
I can see your love light shinning bright
Falling down on me like autumn leaves
And in the night
I can see you shinning bright
