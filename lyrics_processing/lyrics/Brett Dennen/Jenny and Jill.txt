Jenny and Jill were sweethearts in the heartland
Pure and plain like the voice of Judy Garland
Took a year of selling bicycles to buy tickets for the festival
That Jenny gave Jill before she moved away

And there's a whole lot of people out there who never give loving
Jenny and Jill were lucky in love and best friends
They talk about things they do and the songs they wanna slow dance to
As they drove on through the amber waves of grain

And Jenny said: "I don't ever want to forget
"How lucky I feel
"To be in the same place:
"You and I"

For everything you do there is a first time
And you never forget the first time, the first time
Don't forget to be here before you move on
'Cause you never forget the first time, the first time

They camped out in a field of fellow pilgrims
In a tent city of mother nature's children
There were hippy kids and brobots, sorority girls on their shoulders
There'd be other bands and shows, but never this one
You might also like
And Jenny said: "I don't ever want to forget
"How lucky I feel
"To be in the same place:
"You and I"

For everything you do there is a first time
And you never forget the first time, the first time
Don't forget to be here before you move on
'Cause you never forget the first time, the first time
The very first time!


And Jenny says: "I don't ever want to forget
"How lucky I'm feeling
"To be in the same place:
"You and I
"This is our time, this is our life"

For everything you do there is a first time
And you never forget the first time, the first time
Don't forget to be here before you move on
'Cause you never forget the first time, the first time
