Whenever you feel unhappy
All you have to do is call me
I can make you laugh
Sydney
I know that you were wrongly accused
I hope you don't lose your sense of humor
Allegations made in the school yard
Soccer moms gossip in the dog park
Their bark is worse than their bite
They're only a couple of crazy cougars
They're bored and spreading their desperate rumors
You know that I was never that cool
But I won't be taken for a fool
If they wanna talk trash
They can talk, talk, talk
But they better come correct
And if you ever need me, call me
I'll come running straight to you
Straight from the airport
I'll come running
Cut through the customs line
I'll come running
Bust down the courthouse doors
I'll come running
Sydney, I will testify
I'll come running
Sydney, I will testify to ya
You might also likeWe were in the basement
Just giving our blood on stage
And pretending that we were famous
While you were getting framed
I went back to my room in Surrey Hills
Yes I did
I didn't know you were in trouble until you came in
Just as skinny as a twig in my kitchen
And told me I was looking at a dead man
I said, "Sydney, you're wrong."
There's a lot of good people living in LA
Yes there are
And we won't let nobody take you away
No we won't
You know I was never that cool
But I won't be taken for a fool
If the wanna talk trash they can talk, talk, talk
But they better come correct
And if you ever need me you just call me
I'll come running to you
Straight from the airport
I'll come running
Cut through the customs line
I'll come running
Bust down the courthouse doors
I'll come running
Sydney I will testify
I'll come running
Sydney I will testify
