When I get a little hazy
Hazy with the people I love
When the gargoyles chase me
Chase me to the people I love
When my heart is hungry
Hungry for the people I love
When I'm talkin' funny
Talkin' to the people I love

If it makes you feel good
You can stay for a while
If it makes you feel good
You can change your style
If it makes you feel good
You can shape the breeze
Add the balls to freeze

When I'm out here traveling
I travel with the people I love
Anything worth having
I have it with the people I love
If my stars are shining
Shine 'em on the people I love
If my nights are crying
I'm crying for the people I love
You might also like
If it makes you feel good
Ride around in the wind
If it makes you feel good
Listen to your tires spin
If it makes you feel good
Spending all your cash
Try to make it last

Whenever I'm dead and dreamin'
Dreamin' of the people I love
If I lost a meaning
I look to the people I love
When the cold world shakes me
Lean on the people I love
Oh Ma-ma, Ma-ma take me
Take me to the people I love

Love to the people I love
The people I love, the people I love

If it makes you feel good
Throw your phone away
If it makes you feel good
Do nothin' all day
If it makes you feel good
Feeling the richest bliss
In a tome like this
When I get a little hazy
I'm hazy with the people I love
And the gargoyles chase me
Chase me to the people I love
When my heart is hungry
Hungry for the people I love
If I'm talkin' funny
Talkin' to the people I love

Love to the people I love
The people I love, the people I love
Love to the people I love
