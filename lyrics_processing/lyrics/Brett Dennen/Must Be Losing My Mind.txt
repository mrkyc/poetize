With the scavengers on 4th Avenue
Feeling old, boredom of the second hand stores
Hoping maybe I could find something new
Now, now, now, now, now
Here it comes
Here it comes again
Behind the theater, in the alley by the dumpsters
Far away from the glow of the marquee
There alone in the darkness, below the Hotel Congress
I was ? for a second but I then I fell asleep
Now here it comes
Here it comes again, ah
Yeah, here comes that feeling, yeah
I must be losing my mind
(I'm losing, I'm losing my mind)
I must be losing my mind
Oh, my God, there's ghosts in my hotel room
Why do they bother me here?
Oh, my heart, hey, where is my lover?
She, she built a way to the southern hemisphere
You might also likeI hear them laughing at me, the nuns are laughing at me
The homes are laughing at me too
They think I'm lying in there, they think I'm foolish but that
But that don't make me a fool, no, no, no, no, no, no
I must be losing my mind
(I'm losing, I'm losing my mind)
I must be losing my mind
(I'm losing, I'm losing, I'm losing my mind)
But it sure feels fine, you know it sure feels fine
Who am I talking to and what am I saying
Why doubt these words I don't believe?
There's no one stopping you so why are you staying?
Are you as crazy as me?
Huh, I'm in these shadows dying, lying in this street
Nobody's set their soul, anything at all
Nobody notices, no one goes in there
And it scares me, don't know where, nowhere at all
I must be losing my mind
(I'm losing, I'm losing my mind)
I must be losing my mind
(I'm losing, I'm losing, I'm losing my mind)
Yeah, you know but it sure feels fine
You know it sure feels right
Yeah, it does, yes, it does
Ah, here it comes again
Uh, yeah, it's coming on strong again
You know, I'm dancing with my thoughts again
Yeah, my words they don't make any sense and no, no, no
And no, no, no, no, here it comes again, yeah
Ah, these feelings I don't understand
Ah, I'm dancing with my thoughts again
My, my words they don't make any sense
No, no, no, no
