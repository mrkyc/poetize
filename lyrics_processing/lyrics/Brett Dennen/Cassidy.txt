Cassidy, is reggae music playing on the beach
Blue moon tonight, and there isn't a cloud in the sky
Grab your Swiss Army Knife and the blanket and meet me outside
Yeah, come on
Cassidy, the things I lean on are slippery
But I know I love you
And you make it so hard to leave
But I'll keep loving you 'til I'm only a memory

We spend our whole lives movin' on
Reachin' out for lovin' arms
The night is young come out with me

Cassidy, with the ocean in your hair
Come out with me, Cassidy!
I'll be tangled up tonight but tomorrow
I'll be up in the air

Come on, county line
Crazy weed down from Caroline
All the smoke hung in the air while the sun was setting
You said it looked just like an oil spill in heaven
Don't say fare thee well
You got that anxious feeling I can tell
You're getting antsy let's go up to Neptune's Net and have a drink
And plan a trip somewhere to a beach in a magazine
Spend my whole life movin' on
Reachin' out for lovin' arms
The night is young come out with me

Cassidy, with the ocean in your hair
Come out with me, Cassidy!
I'll be tangled up tonight but tomorrow
I'll be up in the air

Cassidy, I love the feeling of sand on my feet
With salt on my skin,
You say you'd never wear clothes again if you didn't have to
You know I can't really be that free but I sure would like to
Show me, show me, show me love
No one else can make me open up
The way you do
I was livin' in my own little prison
I used to decorate the walls that kept me in

We spend our whole lives movin' on
Reachin' out for lovin' arms
The night is young, come out with me
Cassidy, with the ocean in your hair
Come out with me, Cassidy!
With the ocean in your hair come out with me
Cassidy, the ocean all in your hair
Come out with me, Cassidy!
I'll be tangled up tonight but tomorrow
