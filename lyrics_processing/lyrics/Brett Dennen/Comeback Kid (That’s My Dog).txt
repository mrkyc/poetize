Here we go, oh, yeah

Well, maybe it's the common curse
Maybe things get bad before they get worse
I don't wanna become someone
Who can't live up to what I already done
Don't keep it just to figure it out
When it rains and pours and then it runs out
I was crying on the bathroom floor
And just when I thought I could take no more, well

Here comes the comeback
The kid is back, he's back on track
And there goes my hero
He's an underdog, he's coming out on top and
Come on, come on back, that's my dog

It was a park through the trailer park
She went whistling through the graveyard
She came to raise the dead
And I was a stain on her unmade bed
I found a lover and then I lost myself
And now I'm nowhere, she's somewhere else
And the boys with the brown skinny legs
They go on and on she sees, but I say
You might also like
Hey, here comes a comeback
The kid is back, he's back on track and
There goes my hero, he's a underdog
That's coming out on top and
Everybody loves a comeback
So come on back now, comeback, comeback
Everybody loves the underdog
Singing, that's my dog, that's my dog

Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na
That's my dog
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na
That's my dog
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na
That's my dog
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na
Hey

I've never been laid so low
Never been laid so low, low, low, low
Why was I the last to know?
Why was I the last to know?
Yes, I was
I've never been laid so low
Never been laid so low, low, low, low
Don't let me be the last to know
Don't let me be the last to know
Here comes a comeback
The kid is back, he's back on track and
Everybody loves a comeback
So come on back now, comeback, comeback
Everybody loves the underdog
Singing, that's my dog, that's my dog

Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na
That's my dog
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na
That's my dog
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na
That's my dog
Na-na-na-na, that's my dog
That's my, that's my dog

Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na
That's my dog
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na
That's my dog, come on, comeback, comeback, that's my dog
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na
That's my dog
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na
