Gently strung out on caffeine
Did I fall in love or was I just delirious?
I was dumb, found you
My dirty mind was wanderin'
I was wishin' that I could be kissin' your skin
And now you're in my head
You're always in my head
And now you're in my head
And I can't stop thinkin' about you
All day long, it's all I do
From the moment that I wake up
No, I can't stop thinkin' about you
And it makes me sad
Because I know that you don't want me
And all these thoughts in my head
They tease me and they taunt me, oh, yeah
All the broken hearts in London town
Strewn about the tube in the underground
All the voices burning in my brain
And making me insane

And I, I can't stop thinkin' about you
All day long, it's all I do
From the moment that I wake up
You know I can't stop thinkin' about you
And it makes me sad
Because I know that you don't want me
All these thoughts up in my head
They tease me and they taunt me, taunt me, alright, yeah
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
I can't stop thinkin' about you
All day long, it's all I do
From the moment that I wake up
You know I can't stop thinkin' about you
I can't stop thinkin' about you
All day long, it's all I do
From the moment, from the moment that I wake up
I can't stop thinkin' about you
I said I can't, I can't stop thinkin'
No, I can't, I can't stop thinking about you
No, no, no, I can't stop
I can't stop thinking about you, about you, baby
From the moment, from the moment that I wake up
