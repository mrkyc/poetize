All these niggas got they hands out
But I don't owe you boys a damn thing
Shawty know I got them bands now
But I won't give that hoe a damn thing
I like mix match and designer
But today I'm polo everything
Niggas say what they gonn do to me
But I ain't worried bout a damn thang

My nigga Radio home now
So we bout to do this damn thing
Pop a flat and grab a couple guns
Gets some dope and pop some champagne
All my niggas off alot of drugs
The block fiesta we don't need a plug
Take her back to the condo
If you ain't fuckin why you came for
Hoe you must not know my name hoe
Im KTG look at my chain hoe
My nigga Haitian off the zan lean
And he just popped him like 2 more beans
Shoutout Trone Trone he a murder scene
Like fuck new niggas I got my own team
Don't need no help I do my own thing
So I don't owe you boys a damn thing

Thinkin bout life and I'm thinkin bout money
Thinkin bout haters they treatin me funny
These bitches don't love me they on me cause money
These niggas don't know they callin me homie
They callin me bro but I know that they phony
Sneak dissin me make them fools catch a body
I'm well connected like I'm luminati
Waxing your hoe like I'm Mr. Miyagi
She fuck me and suck me and doin it sloppy
I'm smokin that broccoli and rollin off flats
Fuckin them hoes and runnin through checks
You beatin her down you read my text
These niggas be hatin they know I got next
I'm up in them bands they know I got bred
Stackin them stacks I'm doin my thing
I ball like I'm Mike I own my team
So just fall back before the .45 hit all that
Sneak dissin fuck around get you on the ground
M.I.C so K-Town KTG that's what I rep
Lil Chris crazy throwin up my set
Like my belly, my pockets fat
Real facts I'm with that
Rib count got no feel
Ridin round with a hundred years
2013 this our year, this our year
And I worried about a damn thing
And I owe you boys a damn thang
