Ever since I lost my niggas seem like I lost my mind
If you ain't talkin bout no money homeboy don't waste my time
My young boys tote that 9 homeboy don't cross the line
Doing all these goddamn drugs seem like I lost my mind
(3x) I done lost my mind
(3x) I done lost my mind
My young boys tote that 9 homeboy don't cross the line
(3x) I done lost my mind

Smoking on a lime with a dime why your baby mama smackin my line?
Shawty said Lil Chris eat me ho you out your mind
Suck a dick and die to them hating niggas who don't wanna see me shine
Put the chrome to a dome get him gone put a bullet up in his mind
Bitches wanna fuck cause they heard I sign
She gone let me fuck she won't get a dime
Fuck a thot all I see is dollar signs
Leave a opp stingin call him number 9
Wet him up Lake Michigan
Flats got me rollin Michelin
I'm grindin I'm a grimey nigga fuckin all my baby mama's friends
Off a lot of drugs I done lost time
Sneak dissin what you out your mind?
Lil nigga bout 5 feet but the nine make me bout 6'9"

I lose my mind for the big faces
If it ain't my money no conversation
Drug cases on gun cases we beat it like masturbation
Money talk like Chris Tucker point her out I bet Chris fucked her
Said told her beat it ho keep the rubbers don't come back the kid ain't mine
Smokin dope it feel like I'm flyin off the shits it feel like I'm dyin
She give me brain no Einstein haters wrinkle so I keep the Iron
No love no passion kill a nigga with no reaction
Mikey Dollaz he keep the Glock he the king of pop like Micheal Jackson
Beat the dope like egg batter fat nigga but my pockets fatter
Shotgun longer than a ladder I'll bust it at ya like a bad bladder
You foul niggas get free throws I'm the man no tito
Feed me beats I eat those RIP J-beat bro
