I will keep myself warm with the thought of you
I will bate myself daily with our could-have-beens
But I won't hold my breath, 'cause I don't know when I will see you again
You made me a bracelet from the pieces of your mound
And you sent it to me, postman lost it, but somebody found it on the street
They found it on the street and they brought it back to me
They brought it back to me, so I wore it on my ankle
Instead of on my wrist, so I wouldn't be reminded of
The time that we kissed or the next time that I'll see you
When I wanna do the same and if I can't have arms around me
I know what game I'll play
I will wrap myself in your silky words
I will keep myself warm with the thought of you
I will bate myself daily with our could-have-beens
But I won't hold my breath, 'cause I don't know when I will see you again
You wrote me a song, using nighttime calls from whales
And I will never hear it unless soon I grow a tail
But still I like the thought of whales calling out my name
From the darkness of the ocean, an orchestra will play
Everybody knows they want a soundtrack to their life
Well if mine is underwater, will I always walk in silence?
And f that's the case will you be there, in silence by my side?
If the answers yes, I'm ready. If it's no, I know this time that
You might also likeI will wrap myself in your silky words
I will keep myself warm with the thought of you
I will bate myself daily with our could-have-beens
But I won't hold my breath, 'cause I don't know when I will see you again
Oooh oh oooh
Oooh oh oooh
Oooh oh oooh
Oooh oh oooh
Oooh oh oooh
Oooh oh oooh
Oooh oh oooh
I will wrap myself in your silky words
I will keep myself warm with the thought of you
I will bate myself daily with our could-have-beens
But I won't hold my breath, 'cause I don't know when I will see you again
I will wrap myself in your silky words
I will keep myself warm with the thought of you
I will bate myself daily with our could-have-beens
