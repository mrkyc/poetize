I've been thinking 'bout my darkest days
Remember all the times we had away
I'm so scarred, you can see it in my face, oh-oh
Oh, I don't know why I'm holdin' on, holdin' on
Oh, I don't know why I'm holdin' on, holdin' on
Oh I, need you in my darkest times
Oh-woah, oh, I, know I won't let time go by

Sometimes we  walk through the rain, ah (Rain)
Can't feel no pain, ah (Pain)
Took a couple years of my life, to run a check, ah
What did you face, ah? Demons in my way, ah
Did it but I had to fight with no favor
When I was sixteen that's when I buss down straight VVs
Now this shit so crazy, I say, "Look, ma', we on TV"
Let me tell you what it is, I just hope you niggas feel me (Yeah)
And let me know if it's a problem 'cause we late-night creepin'
Nothin' you could tell us
Grew up in the struggle, that's what turned us in to some fellas (Hey)
And we shoot it all off
Get you an umbrella, someone is smokin' that air, dawg
Need a Sunday hella
Fly like propeller
Lambo doors turn into butterfly (Hey)
Too much money on me, I throw it in the sky
But I can't fuck with too many niggas 'cause they switchin' sides
So many of my niggas dyin', it left me terrified

Remember all the times we had away
I'm so scarred, you can see it in my face, oh-oh
Oh, I don't know why I'm holdin' on, holdin' on
Oh, I don't know why I'm holdin' on, holdin' on
Oh I, need you in my darkest times
Oh-woah, oh, I, know I won't let time go by

I can't love you if you go away (I can't love you if you go)
You know what I'm goin' through, I know you wanna stay (I know)
Nigga tryna duck the past like a runaway
Faithful but I finger fuck the cash, every other day
I know bitches loyal to the bag (What?)
I know you'll be down, if I get down to my last (What?)
Real street nigga, got a lick for all of that (Got a lick for all of that)
Havin' M's, don't know what it took for all of that (What it took for all of that)
Thug love, I can write a book on all of that, girl (I swear)
Still a street nigga, got the hood on my back, girl (Hood on my back)
I don't like change, I be good where I'm at, girl (I be good where I'm at)
Tap into my heart, knew I could when I rap, girl
Jump into the car, with some stars, see the stars (Stars)
Look into the future, ain't no good lookin' back
Backwoods in the 'Raq
Chillin' with a real nigga, know you could get a Tesla
Day ones, Draco, wood on my lap, yeah
I've been thinking 'bout my darkest days
Remember all the times we had away
I'm so scarred, you can see it in my face, oh-oh
Oh, I don't know why I'm holdin' on, holdin' on
Oh, I don't know why I'm holdin' on, holdin' on
Oh I, need you in my darkest times
