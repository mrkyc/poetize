Steady are you ready?

Back 2 life, back 2 reality
Back 2 life, back 2 reality

Goin' through a dark place dark time, and I couldn't even see the light
Had my back up against the wall, I was feeling like do or die
But what don't kill me make me stronger, I know it's gonna be alright
So we celebrating here tonight, yeah, we celebrating life tonight

The time is now, gotta make it count
So before we die, let's go all out

We gotta live up, up, up, up, up
Champagne in my cup, cup, cup, cup, cup
DJ turn it up, up, up, up, up
Bring me back 2 life, back 2 life
Yea, we gotta live it up, up, up, up, up
You know we don't give a what what what what what
So til my time's up, up, up, up, up
Bring me back to life, back to life
Back to life

All the tears and all of the prayers, every single one of y'all showed me
So the love I'm givin' back to y'all is bigger than the whole country
From England to Japan to Jamaica to right down the M-I-A
We don't stop, we go hard, let's get it in, call it young and free


Okay, them suckas tried to bury me, Jesus had to carry me
Middle finger to the reaper, nigga ain't no scarin' me
Apparently, you dont understand who I am
It's trouble man hundred grand in my pan
Whippin' dropheads, hardtops, fit to sell Maybachs
Maseratis, Ferrari's those money I dont play by
Presidents stop me, imagine if I stay down
Still shining on to make them haters pull they shades out
When tragedy strikes, I struck back
Looking for me to roll over and die, who does that?
Left a nigga for dead, came back to life
I guess this is me ballin' in the afterlife
Let's hit it
