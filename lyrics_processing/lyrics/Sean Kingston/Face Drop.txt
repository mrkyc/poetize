Kingston, hey, face drop, oh
Kingston, I see your face drop, drop, drop

You touch my heart, disappear
I never knew how much it hurt here
(Made me feel like ooh oooh ooh)
My girl, girl, girl, girl, girl
First came trust, then came love
But this was none of the above, I'm aware
(Made me feel like ooh oooh ooh)
My girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, hey

Weren't you the one who said
That I'd be lost without you?
(No, no, no, no)
You had your fun, couldn't write
This one without you, baby
(No, no, no)

And now I see your face drop
I told you not to leave me alone
And now that I got my own
I see your face drop
I told you not to count me out, hey
Cause you always try to fill me with doubt
Sayin' that I look better if I was thinner
Don't you know you shoulda love me for my inner
When I left you, yo, I came out a winner
Oh, oh, oh, oh
