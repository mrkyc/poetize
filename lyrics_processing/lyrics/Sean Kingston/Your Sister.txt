Hey Yo J.R
I meet A lot of Beautiful girls in my life man
But this situation is kinda wierd
I like her sister

I was just walking out school
I saw this girl gettin off the train
We exchanged numbas and went on a couple dates
At first everything was cool
Until I meet her sista laren
Got introduced to each other and then everything changed

I wanted a piece of that forbidden fruit
But my homies said to stay away
But im 17 what you expect me to do
I guess we'll charge it as a part of the game

If I'm wrong oh I dont want to be right
I kissed your sister last night
It ain't my fault
I guess your sister's my type

Now I'm on the telephone talking
With laren but her sisters on the other line
But I can't help myself 'cuz Lorraine too fine
And I know this may be wrong but it feels so right
Her sister is nice but Lorraine is more like sugar and spice

I wanted a piece of that forbidden fruit
But my homies said to stay away
But im 17 what you expect me to do

Sorry that it had to go like this way
But you know your sisters got what I need
Cuz I got to be with Lorraine
And I'm over you
Sorry that it had to go like this way
But you know your sisters got what I need
Cuz I got to be with Lorraine
And I'm over you (Over you)
