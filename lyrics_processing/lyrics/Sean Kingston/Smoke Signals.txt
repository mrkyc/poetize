When the sun goes down we get up on the floor
When we light it up all you see is the smoke
Got smoke signals in the sky when we burn the club up
Got smoke signals in the sky when we burn the club up
This is going down tonight, make a move and choose somebody
I got the perfect view right now
Them girls be lookin my way
Yea we live a sexy life
Not a bottle will go to waste
When we set the place on fire
It's clear, the lights go red

Shawty you better hold on tight when the bass is into your chest
It goes off like dynamite and when I you blow off that dress
When we party we go hard iladi dadi
You see more explosions than Motley Crue show
 
When the sun goes down we get up on the floor
When we light it up all you see is the smoke
Got smoke signals in the sky when we burn the club up
Got smoke signals in the sky when we burn the club up

Dirty winding everywhere, pretty girls be surfing that crowd
We can dance the night away, we can drink until we lose count
Far many shots we had and not much as let the drink down

Shawty you better hold on tight when the bass is into your chest
It goes off like dynamite and when I you blow off that dress
When we party we go hard iladi dadi
You see more explosions than Motley Crue show
 
When the sun goes down we get up on the floor
When we light it up all you see is the smoke
Got smoke signals in the sky when we burn the club up

Smoke signals in the sky when we burn the club up
Smoke signals in the sky when we burn the club up
 
When the sun goes down we get up on the floor
When we light it up all you see is the smoke
Got smoke signals in the sky when we burn the club up
