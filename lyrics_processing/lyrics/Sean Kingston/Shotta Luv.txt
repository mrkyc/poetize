You don't know the one called Sean Kingston?
I forgot him
2 Chainz (Yeah)
Come on, let's go

You remind me of my coupe, I wanna ride
Something like my gun, I wanna pump it baby
You can be anywhere in the world, but you're here with me

Tonight I'm givin' that shotta love, love
Tonight I'm givin' that shotta love, love
Tonight I'm givin' that shotta love, love

The roughest, toughest, put it in her cervix
All my cars got curtains, tell them niggas it's curtains
Ovay, bubble bath with that Rose, I'm a shotta
Put her in the Audi from a Honda, now she want the anaconda
Sex game crazy, we got that chemistry, let's make babies
And this my testimonial, I wanna be alone with you
You are so phenomenal, I wish I had a clone of you
Pictures all in my phone of you, let me park in your garage
When I crank that thing up, you got my back like a massage
And like a Dodge I charge ya, my bills are larger
Her ass is too, salute

Condom on that dresser, time just arrived for you to come alive

It's you, baby, you, baby
