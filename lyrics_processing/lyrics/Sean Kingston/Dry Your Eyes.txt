Mommy just dry your eyes, mommy don't you cry
I know we've been through hard times and the struggles
And I just wanna tell you I love you

Only fifteen put under pressure
First-month twenty-seventh day
They took away my mother
I was left to be raised by my brother
Tought to be a hustla
Mommy gone gotta stick together
Stay strong through the stormy weather
Became a top seller, look how we stackin' this chedder
When you jump Mommy life would be better
Just like Rihanna, you can stand under my umbrella

You know how to make me better
Even when we lose our chedder
Even through the stormy weather
You hold me down

Mommy just dry your eyes, mommy don't you cry
I know we've been through hard times and the struggles
And I just wanna tell you I love you
Mommy just dry your eyes, mommy don't you cry
I know we've been through hard times and the struggles
And I just wanna tell you I love you

Seventeen got a little money
Feelin kinda blue
Cause it's lookin' you doin' 10 to 20
Ridin bein' broke ain't funny
It's all bein' hungry
But ima keep hustlin' for my mommy
Until I get rich like Puffy
Never had a blamby
You said I can be all I can be
Some day Ima buy you Miami
So when I win my Grammy
You commin' cause I do this for my family

You know how to make me better
Even when we lose our chedder
Even through the stormy weather
You hold me down

Mommy just dry your eyes, mommy don't you cry
I know we've been through hard times and the struggles
And I just wanna tell you I love you
Mommy just dry your eyes, mommy don't you cry
I know we've been through hard times and the struggles
And I just wanna tell you I love you
Seventeen now my Mommys gone
Can't wait till she come back home
Missin her face like dust till dawn, while she went away
Never think it be this long
I feel like cryin' while I'm writin' this song
Can't wait till that day come on
When she leave the place

Hey, what's up mom, how you doin'?
It's been about two years since I saw your face
I miss you like crazy
Know the money orders the pre-paid costs
Bein' on my own
No Knee Kurt Canino
But I love you though
This for you

You know how to make me better
Even when we lose our chedder
Even through the stormy weather
You hold me down

Mommy just dry your eyes, mommy don't you cry
I know we've been through hard times and the struggles
And I just wanna tell you I love you
Mommy just dry your eyes, mommy don't you cry
I know we've been through hard times and the struggles
