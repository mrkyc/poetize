This is your boy Sean Kingston, you already know
Wat a gwaan
The way that you move make me fall in love
Oh I, oh I, oh I
Your sexy brown eyes, I can't get enough
Ooh girl, you got me thinking 'bout the island breeze
Them palm trees and kissin' underneath the moon
Oh baby girl, you need some water
Your body's gettin' hotter, the sweat drippin' off of you
Now break it down slow
Where I'm from girl that's how we do
So give me some more
You got the whole club watching you, you got me sayin'
You drop, drop, drop it like an island, girl
You pop, pop, pop it like an island, girl
You got, got, got it like them island, girls
I don't know where you're from
But you're dancin' to the drums
Like a island queen
You're dancin' like a island queen
Oh, you're such a pretty, pretty, little thing
Tonight you're my island queen, oh I
