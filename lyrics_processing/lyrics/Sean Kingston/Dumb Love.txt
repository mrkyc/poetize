Girl, you make me dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb
Dumb-be-do-be-dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb
Our love is so dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb
Dumb-be-do-be-dumb, wh-wh-wh-why?

You tell me that you need me, but then you wanna leave me
And never make your way to the door
I tell you that you're too much, and that I'll miss you too much
Don't even know what we're fightin' for
You keep my car, girl, and then you go get it fixed
I talk to all them other chicks just to make you jealous
How can we make it right, when we both put up a fit?
You make me so mad, it's kind of hard to forgive

But when I look into your pretty eyes
My heart just drops

Girl, you make me dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb
Dumb-be-do-be-dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb
Our love is so dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb
Dumb-be-do-be-dumb, wh-wh-wh-why?

You always talkin' reckless, sendin' a text message
Tellin' me to pack and get gone
And then I get a call in minutes, you soundin' so innocent
Sayin' that you can't sleep alone
I'll go find every receipt to show how you spend my dough
You wanna go inside my room and burn up all of our clothes
How can we make it right, when we both put up a fit?
You make me so mad, it's kind of hard to forgive

But when I look into your pretty eyes
My heart just drops

Girl, you make me dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb
Dumb-be-do-be-dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb
Our love is so dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb
Dumb-be-do-be-dumb, wh-wh-wh-why?

Callin' it quits just ain't what we were built for
I'd rather love you than to hate you, girl
I, I want you to know, oh-oh-oh
You're my (Ayy), you're my (Ayy)
You're my shorty
Say you're my (Ayy), you're my (Ayy)
You're my shorty (Yeah)
Girl, you make me dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb
Dumb-be-do-be-dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb
Our love is so dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb
Dumb-be-do-be-dumb, wh-wh-wh-why?
Girl, you make me dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb (You're my shorty)
Dumb-be-do-be-dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb (You're my shorty)
Our love is so dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb (Say you're my shorty)
