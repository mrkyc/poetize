Why you wanna leave me, why you wanna go
It took so long to get here, why you wanna go
Why you wanna leave me, why you wanna go
It took so long for you to get close to me
Now you wanna go run away girl, away from me
I know it's got to be hard, cause I'm so busy
Not to mention many lonely nights, just missing me
Cause there's nothing better than you by my side
Cause ain't nothing better than you by my side
Cause ain't nothing better than you by my side
Cause ain't nothing better than you by my side
It took so long to get here, why you wanna go (tell me girl)
Why you wanna leave me, why you wanna go
It took so long to get here, why you wanna go (tell me girl)
Why you wanna leave me, why you wanna go
It took some time for you to earn around your trust
I ain't going nowhere anytime soon you can put that on us
Gucci, Louie, Rodeo, we gon' live it up
Now you want to say goodbye girl, and go mess it all up
Cause there ain't nothing better than you by my side
Cause ain't nothing better than you by my side
Cause ain't nothing better than you by my side
Cause ain't nothing better than you by my side
