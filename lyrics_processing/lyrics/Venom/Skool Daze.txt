Remember me I was your teacher's pet at school
You taught me everything and how we broke the rules
Well now I'm back to show you everything I've learned
You play with fire you know you're getting burned
Get 'em down teacher teacher get 'em down whoa come on
Get 'em down oh teacher teacher get 'em down oh oh
She got a fire raging in between her thighs
I got the hose to put it out try this for size
Well teacher swallowed every inch of throbbing love
Guess this is what they mean by fits like a glove
Get 'em down teacher teacher get 'em down whoa come on
Get 'em down wow teacher teacher get 'em down oh
School days teacher taught me everything school days one and one is two
School days when I heard the school bell ring school days there's nothing she won't do
She sees how hard it gets when she lifts up her dress
She licks her lips and says now put it to the test
She goes down faster than a sinking ship at sea
I don't need rescued 'coz she's going down on me
Going down whoa teacher teacher's going down whoa
Whoa going down whoa teacher teacher's going down whoa whoa
School days teacher taught me everything school days one and one is two
School days when I heard the school bell ring school days there's nothing she won't do
She's got me poisoned teacher's begging me for more
Up goes the skirt again it's harder than before
Wrap those legs around me teacher what else can I do I got this feeling aah
School days teacher taught me everything school days one and one is two
School days when I heard that school bell ring school days there's nothing she won't do
