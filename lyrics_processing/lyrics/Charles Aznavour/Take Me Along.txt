Is all that I own
I see boats coming in with the fruits
Of places unknown
I watch as they come from the world in the sun
And I see in my mind
That there is farewell to this cold golden hell
They can leave far behind
Let me go where they go
Let me fly the winds that they fly
For to stay in this place
Will destroy a man's certain life
Take me along, a long way from here
Take me along to a far away shore
When you're poor it's easy to bare
With sunshine and soft summer air
At the end of the day
In a bar, with sailors I stand
And I talk about girls, about love
A glass in my hand
Then in my dreams, I can travel at seas
On a float, southern-bound
There I can hold all the magic in gold
Of the love I have found
You might also likeWhen the bars on the quayside are closed
Alone I remain
I continue to dream
And each night the dream is the same
Take me along, a long way from here
Take me along to a far away shore
When you're poor it's easy to bare
With sunshine and soft summer air
Very soon I will take
Any troubled chance that I can
Though I dream like a child
For my dreams I'll work like a man
I'll work and reprieve for my to ticket-to-ride
Where the sun shines for me
Surviving any storms, and be wild to be warm
That's the way I must be
I'll be leaving behind no regrets
And hold my past
And I'll go to the sea
As I'll sail to freedom at last
Take me along, a long way from here
Take me along to a far away shore
When you're poor it's easy to bare
With sunshine and soft summer air
Take me along, a long way from here
Take me along to a far away shore
When you are poor it's easy to bare
