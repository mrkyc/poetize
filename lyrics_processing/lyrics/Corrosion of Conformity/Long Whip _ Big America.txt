Some D.C. suit trying to break away
Said he lost another million
Just another old man trying to
Pass the buck with a dirty hand
Good thing he knows his bible
Stick his ass in hell
Ever better in this tiny cell
Make him understand the meaning
Of these words they try to preach
Just to keep them out of the nations reach
I guess it's all for the better
Take it all away
Take me
Won't you take me far away
Hey, hey-hey what's that game you play
Will it make me richer?
Cause I do not have a dime and I hate to waste your time
Maybe I'm wrong but I think this whip is too long
Whip is too long

Laying in a ditch with a loaded gun
So I gave my heart away
But I got it back today
In a velvet box stamped USA
Now all the neighbors call me hero, hero
I was going to lose my mind so
I buckled down and did some crime
But it wasn't what they taught me
Hit the road in high pursuit now
I'm on the run just like a suit
Didn't know it was this easy
Take it all away
Take me
Won't you take me far away
Hey, hey-hey what's that game you play
Will it make me a poor man?
Cause I got an extra dime but I lose it every time
Maybe I'm wrong but I think this whip is too long

Hey, hey-hey, what's that game you play?

No more, no more
See I can't seem to find the time
To crawl across the line
But I can't stay here
No more, no more
See I can't seem to find the time
To crawl across the line
But I can't stay here till I die
