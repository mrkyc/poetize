Where a fallen man is bitter sweet
And with his soul he deficates
Into this world he filled with hate
All your lies have turned to logic
And you got nothing in your pocket
Who? You!
The truth is hard to find
When you got survival on your mind
If you promise to tattle I'll bring your son
Back home from battle
And keep you floatin on your feet
So you feel alive but your really asleep
Who? You!
You observed it from the start
Now you're a million miles apart
As we bleed another nation
So you can watch you favorite station
Now you eyes pop out your sockets
Dirty hands and empty pockets
Who? You!
Homemade deception now a source of pride
You can take all you want old lady
Cause god knows I've tried
Truth be known it was never shown
Run like hell it comes as no surprise
One day you will see what it feels like
To be free
Remember me when you're safe at home
I'm already gone!
Yes sir!
The man said we're gonna do it alone
We're gonna give it to him til they bleed
Gonna laid it on 'em til they're gone
Then give them everything they need!
Truth be shown future stays unknown
Give 'em hell every single time
One day you will see when you're six feet down
Like me... remember me when you're safe at home, yes sir...
I'm already gone!
"attentiion"
"fire when ready "
"kill that son of a bitch"
"get up"
Get on get on get on get up!
Get on get on get on get up!
Get on get on get on get up!
Get on get on get on get up!
Get on gonna lock and load
Gonna give it to 'em when the're hazy
Get on lay your mothers down
Gonna give it to em til the're crazy
Truth be shown
The future stays unknown
Give 'em hell every single time
One day you will see
When you're six feet down like me
Remember me when you're safe home
Cause I'm already gone
