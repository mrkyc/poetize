I see the world through bloodshot eyes
Streets filled with blood from distant lies
The dogs of war never compromise
There ain't no time for rearranging

"Help me Jesus, help me clean my wounds"
He said he cannot heal that kind
Bleeding soul becomes a bitter mind
He said it happens every time

(Knock it down) And that's how the story goes
(Knock it down) In the land of a thousand no's
(Knock it down)
I'm all over you, in time my mind is changing
Oh, knock it down

Black on black gives me a heart attack
And the silence makes it deadly
Some choose to kill with simple will
I've seen them fall, fast and steady

"Help me Jesus, help me clean my wounds"
He said he cannot heal that kind
Bleeding soul becomes a bitter mind
He said it happens every time

(Knock it down) And that's how the story goes
(Knock it down) In the land of a thousand no's
(Knock it down)
I'm all over you, in time my mind is changing


Twist of fate won't give me a break
And myself, I'm slow and tired
I've got to rise with these bloodshot eyes
But I keep falling when I'm higher

"Help me Jesus, help me clean my wounds"
He said he cannot heal that kind
Bleeding soul becomes a bitter mind
He said it happens every time

(Knock it down) And that's how the story goes
(Knock it down) In the land of a thousand no's
(Knock it down)
We are bleeding sins and our sins are always fading
Oh, fading
Oh, fading
Oh, fading
Oh, knock it down, knock it down
Oh, knock it down, knock it down
Oh, knock it down, knock it down
