Sing out loud and keep away the cold
When you're blind and you can't see
Realize it's them, not me
I might be hard to find, you know it happens everytime
When I'm tired I crawl, I can't stand to see you fall
And the years they don't treat you like they used to
When you're wide and I'm awake
I got time enough for days
Take a-want you want
It just might set you free, not me ...
Oh no way, I've been up for a thousand days
But you can cut me down when I'm old and gray
And if you catch me on the move, you can come along
Or you can disapprove
I might be hard to find, you know it happens every time
When I'm tired, I crawl, I can't stand to see you fall
And the years they don't treat you like they used to
When you're wide and I'm awake
I got time enough for days
Take a-want you want
It just might set you free and not me...

When I'm tired I crawl like the savior in us all
But I don't mind it's somethin' that I'm used to
And when it's time to go, I just thought I'd let you know
Farewell this time, you're always on my mind
When I'm tired I crawl, it's a shame to see you fall
And the years they don't treat you like they used to
But when you're wide and I'm awake
Baby, I got enough damn time for a million days
Take a-want you want
It just might set you free....
When you're up you roam, it's a shame to see you go
And the years they don't treat you like they used to
Just as every light you see might be the one that sets you free
