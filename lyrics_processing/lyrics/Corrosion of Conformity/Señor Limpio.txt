Said the man with a dirty hand who claimed that he was king
Choking angels from inside, trying to make them sing
'Cause you're short of breath and close to death from sleeping on the wing
Dirty king, dirty king, now you're strapped in for the ride
It's so hard to be a fighter when your hands are always tied
Mr. Innocent Blood, says he kills but just for love
Too bad the good ones always have to take the blame
Hey, sharp tongue liar, make your pay in a bed of fire
Too bad your dreams are always made of losing games
Dirty king, dirty king, now you're strapped in for the ride
It's so hard to be a fighter when your hands are always tied
But I want to, I want to
I want to but my hands are always tied up, yes indeed
But I want to, I want to
I want to but my hands are always tied up, dirty king
But I wish I had myself a dime
For every time I cursed your goddamn name
Mr. Clean, yeah
Sweatin' on the line, doin' 40, wasting time
Ain't it funny how that money rots your brain?
Put your soul on trial 'cause you lost it all to a tiny vial
Look in the mirror when you tell me who's insane, ooh
