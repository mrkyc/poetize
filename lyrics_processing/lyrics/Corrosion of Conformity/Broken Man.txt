Dealing with two, nothing's new but they look at you with broken backs and bleeding minds
Well I don't know even though they tell me so
You'll be the one who walks the line
Standing tall, they're so fragile
But they always find you when you hide
Cause you're a broken man, in a broken land
Cause you're a broken man, in a broken land
And don't they wish they were blessed like you
The struggle inside your mind is a waste of time - your purest thoughts evaporate
Dark clouds reveal how you feel in your idle time - your own tail becomes the bait
You don't know even though your blood flows
Destroy yourself, you're the one you hate
Standing tall, they're so fragile
But they always get you when you're late
Cause you're a broken man, in a broken land
Cause you're a broken man, in a broken land
And don't they wish they were blessed like you
Standing tall they look so small with the world upon their shoulders
But a broken man on broken land looks far beyond his brothers
Break for the sun you're the one, you're the chosen one, your time is up your time is due
Cracked like a whip from the hand of a broken man to find out that he's just like you
But you've seen it all, in your mind you've seen it all, you've built it up and they made it fall
Because you're killing yourself and you're so fragile
But they cannot crush you if you don't crawl
