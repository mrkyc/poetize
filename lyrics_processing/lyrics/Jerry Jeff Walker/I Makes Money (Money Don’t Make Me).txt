I makes money, money don't make me
And that's the way I am and it's plain to see
Get it right for yourself
Can't put you on a shelf
Live and let live, you know it's plain enough
There ain't a dollar in this world to make me change my stuff

Now I've met lots of men
Who told me when
They finally make their first million
They're gonna live like kings
Gonna try everything
And flatter pretty women
If they know how to do it
Why not get to it
Instead of waiting all their life?
'Cause your life is only doing
What you think is worth pursuing
Instead of waiting all the time

I makes money, money don't make me
And that's the way I am and it's plain to see
Get it right for yourself
Can't put you on a shelf
Live and let live, you know it's plain enough
There ain't a dollar in this world to make me change my stuff
You might also like
If you find yourself waiting
And you know you're hesitating
Get your butt off the ground
It ain't money or your honey
And you know it's kind of funny
When it's all boiled down
If you want to be the man
And you know you certainly can
So do it man, you do it, do it, do it, do it
Yeah, clothes don't make the man
And money won't help you stand
Any truer than you're doin'

I makes money, money don't make me
And that's the way I am and it's plain to see
Get it right for yourself
Can't put you on a shelf
Live and let live, you know it's plain enough
There ain't a dollar in this world to make me change my stuff

No you'll never find the ending
Of sittin' and pretending
You're gonna do it sometime
You keep a-knocking on wood
Doin' exactly what you should
Trying to save enough dimes
You build 'em up higher
So you can retire
To your castle in the blue
But you find it's all behind
'Cause it's probably slipped your mind
And you're too pooped to toot
I makes money, money don't make me
And that's the way I am and it's plain to see
Get it right for yourself
Can't put you on a shelf
Live and let live, you know it's plain enough
