I'd like to dedicate this song to Kris Kristofferson, and Johnny Cash, and Billy Swan, and funky Donny Fritts and

Pissin' in the wind
Bettin' on our losin' friends
Makin' the same mistakes we swear we'll never make again
Pissin' in the wind
But it's blowin' on all our friends
We're gonna sit and grin and tell our grandchildren

About the time I called this guy, it was four in the morning
To teach me the words to the song I was humming
Mmm-hmm-hmm,  mmm-hmm-hmm
He just laughed and he said that the old gray cat is sneakin' down the hall
But all he wants to know is who in the hell is paying for this call

Pissin' in the wind
Bettin' on our losin' friends
Makin' the same mistakes we swear we'll never make again
We're pissin' in the wind
But it's blowin' on all our friends
We're gonna sit and grin and tell our grandchildren

How this Nunn called me up, it was eight in the mornin'
Wondered to know how in the world am I doin'
I said "uhh-huh-huh, mmm-hmm-hmm"
He just laughed and he said "Get it together boy and fall on by the house
"Some Gonzo buddies would like to play anything you're picking now"

Pissin' in the wind
Bettin' on our losin' friends
Makin' the same mistakes we swear we'll never make again
We're pissin' in the wind
It's blowin' on all our friends
We're gonna sit and grin and tell our grandchildren

How we worked and we suffered and struggled makin' our record 'til we got it right
And now we're waiting on the check
To come sneakin' down the hall
Like that old time feelin'
That we never should have ever put the record out at all

Just pissin' in the wind
Bettin' on our losin' friends
Makin' the same mistakes we swear we'll never make again
We're pissin' in the wind
It's blowin' on all our friends
We're gonna sit and grin and tell our grandchildren
That the answer my friend
Is just pissin' in the wind
