This here's "Derby Day"
Written on the day of the Kentucky Derby
When Foolish Pleasure lost
And I was tryin' to make... amends
Well, I was tryin' to finish a love song

Yeah Susan, you are a jewel
About the rarest I've ever seen
I wish I could polish off
All the edges of my craziest dreams
But you know the way I am
There's nothin' you could do
If there's anything you don't want me to do
Said, go ahead and tell me to

It must have been one hell of a starry night
The moon was so bright
Guess it must've knocked out all of your lights
I guess that's the night that you fell for my silvery line

Everything we do is backwards
You know that ain't a lie
You love, I love, you love
Ah, you know you know I love your beautiful eyes
But I can't pay you back, no
I can't make it up in a song
I guess I'm here tryin' to tell you that
I missed myself while you were gone
You might also like
Yeah and it must've been one hell of a starry night
Yeah the moon was so bright
It must've knocked out all of your lights
I guess that's the night that you fell for the silvery line

Baby, you always picked the winners
At every Derby race
I guess you just picked on me
For a little bit of change of pace
Go on, shake your hair, let it loose
Run 'til you pass the wind
I'll be runnin' right in front of you
Tryin' to rein myself in

And it must have been one hell of a starry night
Yeah the moon was so bright
Guess it must've knocked out all of our lights
I guess that's the night that we tied that silvery line

Susan, you are a jewel
The rarest I've ever seen
I wish I could polish off
