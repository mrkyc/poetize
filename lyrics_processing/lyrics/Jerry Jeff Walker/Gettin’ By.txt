Okay buckaroos, Scamp Walker time again
Yeah, I'm trying to slide one by you once more
Don't matter how you do it, just that you do it like you know it
I've been down this road once or twice before

Yeah, gettin' by on gettin' by is my stock-in-trade
Living it day-to-day, picking up the pieces wherever they fall
Just lettin' it roll, lettin' the high times carry the low
Just living my life easy come, easy go

Last week I was thinking it's record time again
And I could see Mike Maitland had been pacin' his floor
Ah Mike, don't you worry, something's bound to come out
Besides, I've been down this road once before

Yeah, gettin' by on gettin' by is my stock-in-trade
Living it day-to-day, picking up the pieces wherever they fall
Just lettin' it roll, lettin' the high times carry the low
Just living my life easy come, easy go

Just gettin' by on gettin' by is my stock-in-trade
Living it day-to-day, picking up the pieces wherever they fall
Just lettin' it roll, lettin' the high times carry the low
Just living my life easy come, easy go

Income tax is overdue, and I think she is too
Been busted and I'll probably get busted some more
But I'll catch it all later, can't let 'em stop me now
I've been down this road once or twice before

Yeah, gettin' by on gettin' by is my stock-in-trade
Living it day-to-day, picking up the pieces wherever they fall
Just lettin' it roll, lettin' the high times carry the low
Just living my life easy come, easy go

Yeah, gettin' by on gettin' by is my stock-in-trade
Living it day-to-day, picking up the pieces wherever they fall
Just lettin' it roll, lettin' the high times carry the low
Just living my life easy come, easy go
