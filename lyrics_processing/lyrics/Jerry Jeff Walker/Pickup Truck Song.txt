Yea, I used to look forward to Saturdays
When me and my grandpa'd get way
We'd hop in his pickup truck and we'd go to town
We had a couple chores that we had to do
It didn't take long before we were throughC
Then we'd let the pickup truck just wander around
We'd make a run to the county dump
We'd always wave we saw someone
Grandpa make up a song as we rolled along
To the post office without fail
We get some feed and we'd check out the mail
And we never took the same road twice on the way back home
I spent a few years out runnin' free
I spent two or three in New York City
And I moved back to Texas tired, hell I'd had enough
I'd go to Luckenbach on Saturdays
Cause Hondo had a way to brighten up my day
He always made me laugh when we rode in his pickup truck
We'd make a run to the county dump
We'd always wave when we saw someone
Hondo'd make up a tale as we rolled along
To the post office without fail
He'd get some chew and we'd check out the mail
And we never took the same road twice on the way back home
You might also likeWell I miss grandpa and Hondo too
I really miss the things that used to do
So last week I went out and bought me an old pickup truck
Now me and the kids spend Saturdays
We do fun things in a simple way
We love to start the day with a ride in the pickup truck
We make a run to the county dump
We always wave if we see someone
The kids love to make up a song as we roll along
To the post office without fail
We get some stamps and we check out the mail
And we never take the same road twice on the way back home
