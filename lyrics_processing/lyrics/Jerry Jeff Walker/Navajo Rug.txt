Well it's two eggs up on whiskey toast
Home fries on the side
You wash her down with the roadhouse coffee
That burns up your insides
It's just a Canyon, Colorado diner
A waitress I did love
We sat in the back 'neath an old stuffed bear
A worn out Navajo rug

Aye aye aye, Katie
Shades of red and blue
Aye aye aye, Katie
Whatever became of the Navajo rug and you?

Well old Jack the boss, he left at six
It was, "Katie, bar the door"
She'd pull down that Navajo rug
And we'd spread it across the floor
I saw lightnin' frame the sacred mountains
The wooin' of the turtle doves
Just Iyin' next to Katie
On that old Navajo rug
You might also like
Aye aye aye, Katie
Shades of red and blue
Aye aye aye, Katie
Whatever became of the Navajo rug and you?

Well I saw old Jack about a year ago
Said the place had burned to the ground
All he'd saved was an old bear tooth
And Katie, she left town
Well Katie got a souvenir too
Jack smiled as he spit out a big old plug
"Well you shoulda seen her coming through the smoke
"She was dragging that Navajo rug"

Aye aye aye, Katie
Shades of red and blue
Aye aye aye, Katie
Whatever became of the Navajo rug and you?

So every time I cross the sacred mountains
And lightning jumps above
It always takes me back in time
To my long lost Katie love
You know everything keeps on a-moving
Everybody's on the go
Hey, you don't find things that last anymore
Like a hand-woven Navajo
Aye aye aye, Katie
Shades of red and blue
Aye aye aye, Katie
Whatever became of the Navajo rug and you, Katie?
Shades of red and blue
Aye aye aye, Katie
Whatever became of the Navajo rug and you?
