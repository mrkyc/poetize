Gotta put myself back in that place again

Well, when you're down on your luck and you ain't got a buck
In London you're a goner
Even London Bridge has fallen down
And moved to Arizona
Now I know why

And I'll substantiate the rumor that the English sense of humor
Is drier than than the Texas sand
You can put up your dukes or you can bet your boots
That I'm leavin' just as fast as I can

I wanna go home with the armadillo
Good country music from Amarillo and Abilene
The friendliest people and the prettiest women you ever seen

Well, it's cold over here, and I swear
I wish they'd turn the heat on
And where in the world is that English girl
I promised I would meet on the third floor?
You might also like
And of the whole damn lot, the only friend I got
Is a smoke and a cheap guitar
My mind keeps roamin', my heart keeps longin'
To be home in a Texas bar

I wanna go home with the armadillo
Good country music from Amarillo and Abilene
The friendliest people and the prettiest women you ever seen

Well, I decided that I'd get my cowboy hat
And go down to Marble Arch Station
'Cause when a Texan fancies he'll take his chances
Chances will be taken, that's for sure

And them limey eyes, they were eyein' the prize
That some people call manly footwear
And they said "You're from down South and when you open your mouth
You always seem to put your foot there"

I wanna go home with the armadillo
Good country music from Amarillo and Abilene
The friendliest people and the prettiest women you ever seen
I wanna go home with the armadillo
