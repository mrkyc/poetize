Sometimes I don't ride 'em at all
But I'm hooked in and I got to ride that train
When I get down in that chute
I can't keep from thinkin' about all that loot
I'm a rodeo deo deo de cowboy
Bordering on the insane
That's why I drink a cheeseburger, eat a six-pack
Take a Darvon to kill the pain
Pay thirty-two fifty just to take a fall
I live through it to tell you 'bout it all
I'm a rodeo deo deo de cowboy
Bordering on the insane
Now relax and take a deep breath or two
It's a one time shot and then you're through
Hang on boy, and someday you'll have fame
When they open up that gate
The bull takes off like a runaway freight
And you're a rodeo deo deo de cowboy
Bordering on the insane
That's why I eat a cheeseburger, drink a six-pack
Take a Darvon to kill the pain
Pay thirty-two fifty just to take a fall
I live through it just to talk about it all
I'm a rodeo deo deo de cowboy
Bordering horny insane

I feel like all my circuits are blown
I can't remember my number or name
Gimme a beer or two and I'll feel fine
'Least it's worked every other time
Cuz I'm a rodeo deo deo de cowboy
Bordering on the insane
That's why I drink a cheeseburger, eat a six-pack
Take a Darvon to kill the pain
Pay thirty-two fifty just to take a fall
I live through it to tell you 'bout it all
I'm a rodeo deo deo de cowboy
Bordering on the insane
That's why I drink a cheeseburger, eat a six-pack
Take a Darvon to kill the pain
Pay thirty-two fifty just to take a fall
I live through it to tell you 'bout it all
I'm a rodeo deo deo de cowboy
