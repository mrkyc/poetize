I'm just sitting here counting my money
Wondering why you're in love with me, honey
And why everybody is so high-strung these days
The price of living here has gone sky high
But guys like me we're always getting by
Babe told me, "A lean dog can run a long race"

All I know is you gotta keep trying
You gotta laugh now-and-then to keep from crying
The only sure thing is taxes and dying
And your lovin' makes the livin' worthwhile

Some days I'm more gone in here
Some days I like to just sit and drink beer
And some days I can't wait until I get home
All I like to do is play music and golf
The money I make pays the IRS off
Without you, Susan, I'd simply be a rolling stone

All I know is you gotta keep trying
Gotta laugh now-and-then to keep from crying
The only sure thing is taxes and dying
But your lovin' makes the livin' worthwhile
You might also like
Oh without you I'd have no one to sleep with
Nobody to laugh with late at night
Without you there'd be no light in the window
There'd be no reason to write

All I know is you gotta keep trying
Gotta laugh now-and-then to keep from crying
The only sure thing is taxes and dying
And your lovin' makes the livin' worthwhile

Well I've been sued and screwed and tattooed
But I'm standing right here in front of you
Telling you that even the President makes a mistake
We're all livin' life day-to-day
The whole damn world's just feeling it's way
But you can tell them ol' Jerry Jeff said it's okay

All I know is you gotta keep trying
You gotta laugh now-and-then to keep from crying
The only sure thing is taxes and dying
And that your lovin' makes the livin' worthwhile
