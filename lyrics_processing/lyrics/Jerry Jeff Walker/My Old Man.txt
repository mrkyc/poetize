My old man had a rounder soul
He'd hear an old freight train and then he'd have to go
He said he'd been blessed with a gypsy bone
And that's the reason I guess that he'd been cursed to roam
He came through town back before the war
Didn't even know what it was that he was lookin' for
He carried a tattered bag for his violin
Full of lots of songs of the places he had been
He talked real easy and he smiled and waved
He could pass along to you when his fiddle played
Makin' people drop their cares and woes
To hum out loud those tunes that his fiddle bowed
'Til the people there began to join that sound
And everyone in town was laughin,' singin,' dancin' 'round
The Fiddler's tunes were all they heard that night
Like some dream that says all the world is right

The Fiddler's eye caught one beauty there
She had that rollin' flowin' golden kind of hair
He played for her as if she danced alone
He played his favorite songs, the ones he called his own
'Til she alone was dancin' in the room
The only thing left movin' to that Fiddler's tune
You might also like
He played until she was the last to go
Then he stopped and packed his case, said he'd take her home
In all the nights that passed a child was born
In all the years that passed, love would keep them warm
And all their lives they'd share that dream come true
All because she danced so well his fiddler tune

The train next mornin' blew a lonesome sound
As if she sang the blues of what she took from town
And all that I recall that was said when I was young
