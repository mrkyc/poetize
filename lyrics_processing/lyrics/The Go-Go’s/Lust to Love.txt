It used to be the fun was in the capture and kill
In another place and time, I did it all for thrills
Love me and I'll leave you
I told you at the start
I had no idea that you would tear my world apart

And you're the one to blame
I used to know my name
But I've lost control of the game
'Cause even though I set the rules
You've got me acting like a fool
When I see you, I lose my cool

Lust to love
Was the last thing I was dreaming of
And now all I want is just to love
Lust has turned to love
Lust to love
Was the last thing I was dreaming of
And now all I want is just to love
Lust has turned to love
You might also like
That was when the fun was in the capture and the kill
In another place and time, I did it all for thrills
Love me and I'll leave you
I told you at the start
I had no idea that you would tear my world apart

And you're the one to blame
I used to know my name
But I've lost control of the game
'Cause even though I set the rules
You've got me acting like a fool
When I see you, I lose my cool

Lust to love
Was the last thing I was dreaming of
And now all I want is just to love
Lust has turned to love
Lust to love
Was the last thing I was dreaming of
And now all I want is just to love
Lust has turned to love

Lust to love
Was the last thing I was dreaming of
And now all I want is just to love
Lust has turned to love
Lust to love
Was the last thing I was dreaming of
And now all I want is just to love
