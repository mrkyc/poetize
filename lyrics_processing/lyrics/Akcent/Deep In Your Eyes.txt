Shadow, shadow
Yes, baby I'm in fire 'cause your love
Is the only thing i'm thinking of
Shadow, shadow
They are disappearing when you light
Is shining so bright

Deep in your eyes mama, deep in your eyes
That's where it lays, my love, that's where it lays
Deep in your eyes, mama, deep in your eyes
Baby, I am falling into

Where is the love? Where is the
Where is the love? Where is the
Where is the love? Where is the
Deep in your eyes, baby, deep in your eyes
Where is the love? Where is the
Where is the love? Where is the
Where is the love? Where is the
Deep in your eyes, baby, deep in your eyes

Shadow, shadow
Every time I look into your eyes
I am home and I am on the rise
Shadow, shadow
I will mute a doubting voice's eyes
Fight for your eyes
You might also like
Deep in your eyes mama, deep in your eyes
That's where it lays, my love, that's where it lays
Deep in your eyes, mama, deep in your eyes
Baby, I am falling into

Where is the love? Where is the

Where is the love? Where is the
Deep in your eyes, baby, deep in your eyes
Where is the love? Where is the
Where is the love? Where is the
Where is the love? Where is the
Deep in your eyes, baby, deep in your eyes

Baby, I am falling into

Where is the love? Where is the

Deep in your eyes, baby, deep in your eyes
Where is the love? Where is the
Where is the love? Where is the
