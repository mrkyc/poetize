In the night
I will keep you in my heart
Forever
In the night

And you are the one that lights the fire
I am the one who takes you higher
I love your voice when you say my name
That's my name, that's my name, that's my name

All the time I thought about you
I saw your eyes and they were so blue
I could read there just one name
My name, my name, my name (ah)
Because of you I'm flying higher
You give me love, you set a fire
You keep me warm when you call my name
That's my name, that's my name, that's my name

In the night
I will keep you in my heart
Forever
In the night
You might also like
And you are the one that lights the fire
I am the one who takes you higher
I love your voice when you say my name
That's my name, that's my name, that's my name

All the time I thought about you
I saw your eyes and they were so blue
I could read there just one name
My name, my name, my name (ah)
Because of you I'm flying higher
You give me love, you set a fire
You keep me warm when you call my name
That's my name, that's my name, that's my name

In the night
I will keep you in my heart
Forever

And you are the one that lights the fire
I am the one who takes you higher
I love your voice when you say my name
That's my name, that's my name, that's my name
And you
You will stay in my heart
As I knew from the start
And you
You will stay in my heart
Never keep you apart
And you
You will stay in my heart
As I knew from the start
And you
You will stay in my heart
