Kylie give me
Baby, your the one that left my heart
I swear i'm not lieing
Baby, tonight i'm going to try my luck
I can see that you want me
I'm dreaming about you avery night, every night
Kylie give me just a chance, lets go out and dance
We can get into the groove, I can watch you move
Later you can single me, like a shining star
But i rather, do you on the backseat of my car
Kylie give me just a chance, lets go out and dance
We can get into the groove, I can watch you move
Later you can single me, like a shining star
But i rather, do you on the backseat of my car
Baby, take a minute check me out, I'm seeing you front row
Baby, I'm the coolest guy in the crowd, I'm sure you have seen me
I'm dreaming about you avery night, every night
Kylie give me just a chance, lets go out and dance
We can get into the groove, I can watch you move
Later you can single me, like a shining star
But i rather, do you on the backseat of my car
Kylie give me just a chance, lets go out and dance
We can get into the groove, I can watch you move
Later you can single me, like a shining star
But i rather, do you on the backseat of my car
