Get up everybody, let's get to the disco
Come on, let's dance all night 'cause this is San Francisco
I wanna be on stage, I wanna feel like a star
(Oh baby, I'm the king of disco...)

I'm a young single man at the age 25
Ex-communist, I search American life
I have no cash, I have no job
But I don't give a damn as long as music is my world

Get up everybody, let's get to the disco
Come on, let's dance all night 'cause this is San Francisco
I wanna be on stage, I wanna feel like a star
(Oh baby, I'm the king of disco...)

Oh baby, I'm the king of disco...
Oh baby, I'm the king of disco...
Oh baby, I'm the king of disco...
Oh baby, I'm the king of disco...
Oh baby, I'm the king of disco...

She's a hot sexy lady, skin is dark, dress is white
Driving a jag, California type
She has the moves, she has the style
But I don't give a damn as long as music is my life

Get up everybody, let's get to the disco
Come on, let's dance all night 'cause this is San Francisco
I wanna be on stage, I wanna feel like a star

Oh baby, I'm the king of disco...
Oh baby, I'm the king of disco...
Oh baby, I'm the king of disco...
