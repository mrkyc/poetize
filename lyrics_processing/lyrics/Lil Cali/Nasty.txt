I pull it out and skeet it on her face (Ugh)
We could make a movie
She like it in her booty when we up in the jacuzzi
Ducked out on my cougar
Linked up in my jeweller
She bust, nut after nut
Like a, pussy oozer
She like it in her coot
Top down, beat low
Tell me she the truth
A fool with that deep-throat
Money make her cum, and shit I got a lot of dope
Cocaine cowboy, bitch I got a lot of blow
She suck it fast, she swallow slow
Do it for your man
With no hands
You know how it go
Got a hunnit bands in my pants and it got to go
Then I got to go
Adios

Got me hypnotized, you got me in a trance
Really love the way you dance
I could pull a rubber-band
Trying to get you out your clo-oo-oo-oo-oothes
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh (Trying to get you out your)
Look its raining money from the sky
Got me focused on your thighs
The way you look me in my eyes
Got me coming back for mo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ore
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
You might also like
She like the way I bend her pussy before I turn her over
Lick all in her asshole
Kissing in the V.I.P I, met her at my last show
Pizza rock my heater cock, I don't feel like I'm famous
Big ole' ass in front me then the music go to banging
Her booty go to shaking but I really can't explain it
All it take is a vacation
Maybe relocate to Vegas
Smoking on Garcia Vega's
O.G Kush is in rotation
C060 block code that's a Cocaine white Mercedes
In the top this empty theater, look around
I see a lot of haters
Bitch I bet I pull it out, no doubt
Head spinning she nasty
Got home sick from my last trip
Nigga, fuck your ho, don't want to fuck your ho
She a fat chick and she bad built
Got a bad bitch I go mad with
Went to school and took classes
B.E.B.E Armani Jeans just to really see how that ass sit
We at the Bayou Classic
On top of the hotel
Bout to get explicit just make sure you don't go tell

Beat it from the front
Eat it from the back {Ugh}
Blew another stack
Just to see her booty clap
She got Gucci, lotta Louis, buku diamonds on her wrist
Say the shit that makes her smile, is a reminder of my dick
Woke up from her, steak and eggs
All up in-between her legs
I get it when I want
I ain't never had to beg
She get nasty
Anyway I want it at
Any spot I pick
She monkey on that dick
Woke up to some head
Put me back to sleep
She a lady in the streets, turn beast up in the sheets
All up out of bed, she keep everything discrete
Don't compete for that meat
She complete, my lil freak
