Destined for tragedy
You wore a scar I could not see
This thorn between us rose a storm inside me
Buried within your heart
Lies the burning emptiness of your lost love
Why must you rain tears on me?

I don't care if I ever breathe again
Just confess tell me, tell me you're in love with him
I don't care if I ever breathe again
I thought you loved me more than this
Yes, every time I close my eyes
There's a memory of you

Every time I close my eyes
I see you running away with him
You cut yourself away, you bled me dry
This was not a dream
Nightmares did become reality
And I was left here waiting with a frozen heart, frozen heart

And I was left here with a frozen heart
With a thought of vengeance running through my head
It was destined from the start
I will bring you down
I will bring you down
I will bring you down
Destined for tragedy
Hate consumes me
You might also like
I don't care if I ever breathe again
Just confess tell me, tell me you're in love with him
I don't care if I ever breathe again
I thought you loved me more than this
Yes, every time I close my eyes
There's a memory of you
Everything I loved is lost
But the memory lives on
Why did you cut yourself from me?
And run far away from here?
I don't care if I ever breathe again
I thought you loved me more than this
Yes, every time I close my eyes
There's a memory of you

Everything I loved is lost
But the memory lives on
Why did you cut yourself from me?
And run far away from here?
From here?
From here?
From here?
From here?
From here?
From here?
From here?
