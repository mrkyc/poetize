As we march now to the end
One last kiss now we surrender
To a lifetime of regret
Throw our hearts into the river
As we march now to the end
I know nothing lasts forever
But you I won't forget
It's been so long since you left me here
Drowning in my tears of depression
It feels like time and space has stood still
As I wait for you my dear to come home
Only my heart beats for you
Tell me you feel the same way too
Leave me buried with my regret
Destroy me into nothingness
In her mind, she's lost her faith
She's giving up on broken promises
If I could turn back time
Erase all my mistakes
Then could I steal your heart?
Just like the first moment we met
Leave me buried with my regret
Destroy me into nothingness
You might also likeI call her in my distress
And she screams
This is the same shit all over again!
Tells me I will never change
And there is nothing in this world
That I could do or say to change her mind
'Cause you will never be the same again in my eyes
'Cause you will never be the same again in my eyes
So we march to the fucking end
Destroy the life that we lived
Maybe this was death's design
This is the end of You and I
Can you hear me?!
Only my heart beats for you
Tell me you feel the same way too
Leave me buried with my regret
Destroy me into nothingness
In her mind, she's lost her faith
She's giving up on broken promises
If I could turn back time
Erase all my mistakes
Then could I steal your heart?
Just like the first moment we met
As time goes by, is this the end?
My darling, will I see your face again?
As time goes by, is this the end?
My darling, will I see your face again?
In her mind, she's lost her faith
She's giving up on broken promises
If I could turn back time
Erase all my mistakes
Then could I steal your heart?
Just like the first moment we met
