Sunrise this is the last day that I'll ever see
Out in the court-yard they're ready for me
But I go to my Lord with no fear
'Cause I did what I did for Maria

As I rode into town with the sun going down
All the windows were barred there was no-one around
For they knew that I'd come with my hand on my gun
And revenge in my heart for Maria
My dearest departed Maria

Take an eye for an eye and a life for a life
And somebody must die for the death of my wife
Yes I did what I did for Maria
I did what I did for Maria

Laughter echoed across from the end of the street
There was the man I was burnin' to meet
And my mind was so calm and so clear
As I took my revenge for Maria

And he fell to the ground raisin' dust all around
But I knew he was dead long before he went down
It was quick it was clean made it easy on him
Which is more than he did for Maria
When he did what he did to Maria
You might also like
Take an eye for an eye and a life for a life
And somebody must die for the death of my wife
Yes I did what I did for Maria
I did what I did for Maria

Sunrise this is the last day that I'll ever see
Out in the court-yard they're ready for me
But I go to my Lord with no fear
'Cause I did what I did for Maria

Take an eye for an eye and a life for a life
And somebody must die for the death of my wife
Yes I did what I did for Maria
I did what I did for Maria

Take an eye for an eye and a life for a life
And somebody must die for the death of my wife
Yes I did what I did for Maria
I did what I did for Maria

Take an eye for an eye and a life for a life
