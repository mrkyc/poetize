I had never thought
We were hangin' on
But the fall looks very far
Staring at the ground
What flesh will do to you
Will do to me too
Be free and on your own

It's not that simple, it's not that simple
It's never that simple

It feels like the first time
That we've fallen behind and
We faltered too far down
No one could save us
It feels like the first time
And we're standing above them
And no one can touch us
The worst is over
The worst is over

I could say to you
A bitter word or two
There's no stopping now
Just get it out in the air
Heard it through the fog
And hurt by it all
I'd take it back today

But it's out of my hands, it's out of my hand
But it's out of my hands

It feels like the first time
That we've fallen behind and
We faltered too far down
No one could save us
It feels like the first time
And we're standing above them
And no one can touch us
The worst is over

Lost in the film again
All the signs were showing
Watching a single frame when the wind begins
You're never anywhere
Cause you're caught in my weather
Caught in my weather every time
Feels like the first time
We've fallen behind
No use is the other one to wait
And I can hold on
As sure as I'm strong
Get over the faithfull yesterdays...
Yeah... days..... yeah.....
It feels like the first time
That we've fallen behind and
We faltered too far down
No one could save us
It feels like the first time
And we're standing above them
And no one can touch us
The worst is over
It feels like the first time
That we've fallen behind and
We faltered too far down
No one could save us
It feels like the first time
And we're standing above them
And no one can touch us
The worst is over
The worst is over
