When you feel so close to some resolve
And you write the words you were writing for
But your courage gets dissolved
Into what, I don't know

When you feel that way again
You have to stop your thinking
And think of what you're here for
And let the rest of your feelings go

And you've got to find your balance, you've got to realize
You've got to try to find what's right before your eyes, oh
And if you find you've fallen, and all your grace is gone
Just scream for me and I'll be what you're falling on

When you feel so close to some resolve
And you say the things that you're standing for
Don't let your courage get dissolved
Cause it's then that the fear grows

And you've got to find your balance, you've got to realize
You've got to try to find what's right before your eyes, oh
And if you find you've fallen, and all your grace is gone
Just scream for me and I'll be what you're falling on, oh, oh

Whoa, just give me the word and I'll be there
Just tell me the words that I've been living for
Just tell me the things that I've been fighting for
It's do or die, this is either or
Just give me the word and I will be there
Just give me the word and I will be there

You've got to find your balance, you have to realize
You've got to try to find what's right before your eyes
And if you find you're falling, and all your grace is gone
Just scream for me and I'll be what you're falling on, oh
You've got to find your balance, you've got to realize
You've got to try to find what's right before your eyes
And if you find you're falling, and all your grace is gone
