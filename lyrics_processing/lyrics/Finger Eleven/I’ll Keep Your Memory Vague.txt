This won't break your heart, but I just think it could
Cause I haven't tried as hard as I should
To separate you from everything I do
But I would never want to come between us two

I'll keep your memory vague, so you won't feel bad about me
I'll say the things that you said, sometimes so it reminds me
I'll keep your memory vague, so you won't feel bad about me
I'll say the things that you said, sometimes so it reminds me

Now I'm thinking back to what I said before
I hope your heart won't have to hurt anymore
Cause it's really not that sad from here
Because the moments I can feel you near

They keep you close to me my dear
And if they ever become too clear

I'll keep your memory vague, so you won't feel bad about me
I'll say the things that you said, sometimes so it reminds me
I'll keep your memory vague, so you won't feel bad about me
I'll say the things that you said, sometimes so it reminds me

Now you've gone away, don't worry it's okay
That you're gone away
Now you've gone away, further than yesterday
But you'll never leave these scenes my mind replays

I'll keep your memory vague, so you won't feel bad about me
I'll say the things that you said, sometimes so it reminds me
I'll keep your memory vague, so you won't feel bad about me
I'll say the things that you said, sometimes so it reminds me

I'll keep your memory vague, so you won't feel bad about me
(Where in the world have you gone now?)
I'll say the things that you said, sometimes so it reminds me
(Where in the world have you gone now?)
I'll keep your memory vague, so you won't feel bad about me
(Where in the world have you gone now?)
I'll say the things that you said, sometimes so it reminds me
