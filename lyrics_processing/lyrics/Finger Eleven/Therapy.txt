'Round the safest orbit
You controlled the ordinary
I was grateful for it
Wide awake in the beginning
Trembling after the fall
Only half my world remembers
While the other half revolves
Cut off cause I can't remember
A face that could cut me deeper
But hearts could never leave me bleeding
Becoming the cause and burden
The lesson begins unlearning
And it has never been forgiving my dear
It's all too familiar
I've been here before
I'll carry this weight for your smallest reward
Because I'll continue to break down the door
Just let me in I swear it will not be like before
Can't think of what to say
I can't think of what to do
I just think I might be losing my mind
Can't stop this agony
Cancel my therapy 'cause
I just thought of you and now I feel fine

Apathy returns it's offense
But only after I get moving
Relax and begin the change
In time for the newest age
To help me find out what I'm missing in here
It's all too familiar
I've been here before
I'll carry this weight for your smallest reward
'Cause I'll continue to break down the door
Just let me in I swear it will not be like before
Can't think of what to say
Can't think of what to do
I just think I might be losing my mind
Can't stop this agony
Cancel my therapy 'cause
I just thought of you and now I feel fine
I covered all the grounds and I uncovered our design
And every second I have spent has come to remind me in time
Wide awakened out of spinning
'Round the safest orbit
You controlled the ordinary
I was grateful for it
I was grateful for it
Can't think of what to say
Can't think of what to do
I just think I might be losing my mind
Can't stop this agony
Cancel my therapy 'cause
I just thought of you and now I feel fine
Can't think of what to say
Can't think of what to do
I just think I might be losing my mind
Can't stop this agony
Cancel my therapy 'cause
