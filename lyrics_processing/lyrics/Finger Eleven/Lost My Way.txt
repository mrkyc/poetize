I'm bound to wander where
All of your glitter's going
But I'm so far from knowing
And none of my instincts showing
Kicking, kicking, I'm
Screaming from outside in
Tell me where I've been
There's nowhere to return to out there

I think I've lost my way
But that's just not news today

Because the story's old
The black and white
Have gone to grey
The story's old
The black and white
Have gone to grey
The story's old
The black and white
Have gone to grey
And you were right
'Cause I finally lost my way

Well I'm bound to wander where
All of your glitter's going
But I'm so far from knowing
And none of my instincts are showing
Kicking, kicking, I'm
Screaming from outside in
Tell me where I've been
There's nowhere to return to out there
