Thought it could somehow get me by
Watching the doctors as they slide
Needles into my eye
Thought I could finally get around
Laughable symptoms keep me down
Faces I see all keep me blind
And now they're redemption's mine
Now that I can't exchange actions for words
Now that I found these inside fears the worst
Now that I know there's no place left to hide
Can I become all I thought I might
As the leaders who follow the path of
Whoever was standing 'round them
Call to say what I'm missing
And into a detail they always go
Don't believe them but offer condolences
Under the circumstances
All too often I'm missing the spirit to fit in
So call me out, call me out
Thought I could soundly sleep tonight
Positive clear and breathing right
Panic attack, panic attacks me now
Seems like a fair redemption

Watching the doctors as they try
Slipping a needle in my eye
My eye
A needle in my eye
