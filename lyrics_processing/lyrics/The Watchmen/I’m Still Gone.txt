As bright and big as a clown parade
Streamers floating in her eyes
Son of God by her side
Dip into a low-cut back I
I don't think I'll wanna come back
Something strange fills the room
Soft voice brings me back too soon
Says, "Hey, there man with the stare
Could I help you to get yourself somewhere?"
I said, "Please dance close to me"
I said, "Please just dance close to me"
I go on and on, and on, and on, and on
Nothing tells me something has gone wrong
You can't do that so do this from now on
Just another thought don't mind me
Just another thought don't mind me, yea, I'm still gone
Yea, I'm still gone
Can I take you away from here
Rub you down, maybe dry your tears?
I don't have to know your name
The one like me, they're all the same
Lie you down and talk real soft
Let your dreams do what they want
Bright eyed girl that sure sounds nice
But my heart's been wrenched up in a vice
There's a girl left way back there
Who cries when she don't even care
I said, "Please dance close to me"
I said, "Please just dance close to me"
I go on and on, and on, and on, and on
Nothing tells me something has gone wrong
You can't do that so do this from now on
Just another thought don't mind me
Just another thought don't mind me, yea, I'm still gone
You might also likeSince you don't want me let's
Let's hear about the one you need
Something tells me her eyes are green
Makes you feel about fifteen
Sounds pretty good for a start
But let me tell you about her heart
Tells you she loves you with bedroom eyes
When you tell her that she only sighs
Says, "That's what I thought you'd say
Now may I please have your soul it's time to play"
I said, "Please dance close to me"
I said, "Please just dance close to me"
I go on and on, and on, and on, and on
Nothing tells me something has gone wrong
You can't do that so do this from now on
Just another thought don't mind me
