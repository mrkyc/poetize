But more front and center
She's what becomes a legend most with memories such as hers
Diarized inside the cage there's no escape only inches of clean air
Breathing the best that she knows how
Breathing the best that she knows how to breathe
She's so in love with the great escape it's all around her hopes and in her dreams
Of one day just transporting
Where would all the young girls go would they wander around like me
I wish I knew of a better place a kinder place a more gentler place to be
She's living the best that she knows how
Living the best that she knows how to live
Hear her sing shut up
Hear her sing shut up
Hear her sing shut up
And though she can't even bother
Hear her sing shut up
Hear her sing shut up
Hear her sing shut up
She don't have the strength to be fighting with you
One week and two and three four going insane
You might also likeIt's 19 in the 40s sometime what be it of a girl who's in the way
Of all the race they're ruining
She can almost hear them now she closes up her eyes but just the same
Hears their boots and knows that her days are short and she'll die before she wakes
Shut up
Hear her sing shut up
Hear her sing shut up
Will they walk by and grab me
If I break for the outside
Will I fall in love there
Or will I crumble straight down here
So I write and I fear it's real
Return me to my maker
Hear her sing shut up
Hear her sing shut up
Hear her sing shut up
Though she can't even bother
Hear her sing shut up
Hear her sing shut up
Hear her sing shut up
She don't have the strength to be fighting with you
