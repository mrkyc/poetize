And tear it inside out
Hear them crash with a burnin' flash
And rip your soul right out
Then I run for the rising sun
Mother Earth, please let me live
I was taught to walk tall and never crawl
But why die, it's not my sin
I can make you go down
(Na, na, na, na)
I can make you go down
(I don't think so)
I can make you go down
(Na, na, na, na)
I can make you go down, down, down
(I don't think so)
Well hear me cry to the burning sky
Oh, Lord what have I done?
No more running, no more time
My body has gone numb
I see her face in a safer place
And sweet smells fill the air
All I ask is one more touch
Dear God is that not fair?
I can make you go down
(Na, na, na, na)
I can make you go down
(I don't think so)
I can make you go down
(Na, na, na, na)
I can make you go down, down, down
(I don't think so)
Make you go down for the love of God
And all the land that he walks on
Don't you see, by his hand you will fall?
Keep on counting, keep the score
Don't want to be hanging around here no more
Oh, no, said to you, I don't think so
Now I rise up through the skies
And my body's still down there
Too many things that were left undone
Silent screaming in despair
If I had one last minute
Upon this world gone mad
I'd shout out, "Brothers and sisters
Please join hands and walk across this land"
I can make you go down
(Na, na, na, na)
I can make you go down
(I don't think so)
I can make you go down
(Na, na, na, na)
I can make you go down, down, down
(I don't think so)
I can make you go down
(I don't think so)
I can make you go down
(I don't think so)
I can make you go down
(I don't think so)
I can make you, make you
