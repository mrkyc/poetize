She sits and wonders, how did I get here
Mr. Cadillac, he tells Danah where it's at
When you're with me kid you've got nothing to fear
Makes you wonder about Danah's mother
Laying down the concrete law
Makes you wonder, Pop, about that constant buzz you've got
I don't need no Bible healing
I don't need Mr. Leary's whacked out feeling
I just need some understanding
I just need a happy home
Little Danah's legs, they look just like a road map
She's got to feed the monkeys crawling round her back
Helps to numb the pain when the rough boys play their games
I wonder if all the big stars started out like that
Makes you wonder about Danah's mother
She's yelling every time she speaks
Makes you wonder, Pop, you're always thinking with your c***
I don't need no Bible healing
I don't need Mr. Leary's whacked out feeling
I just need some understanding
I just need a happy home
You might also likeI can't take it, I can't take it
I can't take it anymore
Everytime I try to walk, I just end up on the floor
So put your arms around me, close them way up tight
I can't breathe, no I can't breathe, I'm being strangled by the night
Mr. Fat Man says, you wanna make some extra cash
You know you'd look real cute dressed up like a nun
Mr. Cadillac, he walks in on a blood bath
Fat Man says, hey I was only having fun
Makes you wonder mother, how you gonna treat your other
Will things turn out the same
Makes you wonder, Pop, just when are things they a gonna stop
I don't need no Bible healing
I don't need Mr. Leary's whacked out feeling
I just need some understanding
