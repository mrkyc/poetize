Who's that crawling on my floor
Who's that sneaking in my bed
Seems like someone wants me dead
Oh my Lord it's the reaper
I'm talking about the soul stealer
In my time of dying well I thought I'd be a man, but God I'm shaking
My sweet life ain't long enough to make me brave and strong enough for what I'm facing
Hey there Grandpa how you been
You're living free of Guilt and Sin
Looking down upon our world
Watch it bleed as it twirls
Oh my God where am I going
Oh my God the wind keeps blowing me
In my time of dying well I thought I'd be a man, but God I'm shaking
My sweet life ain't long enough to make me brave and strong enough for what I'm facing
All I want is one more chance to lie my baby down, God I love her
All I want is one more chance to buy my friends a round, my God I love them
With the misty morning and the cool wind on my face
I drop myself down to the ground and tremble and I shake
Then my back begins to crack and wings they take it's place
Goodbye my sweet I love you, goodbye my sweet I love you
I take my one last breath and then I fly

Who's that crawling around my floor
Who's that sneaking in my bed
It's me baby do not dread
Oh my God my head's reeling
Oh my God time to start again
In my time of dying well I thought I'd be a man, but God I'm shaking
My sweet life ain't long enough to make me brave and strong enough for what I'm facing
All I want is one more chance to lie my baby down, God I love her
