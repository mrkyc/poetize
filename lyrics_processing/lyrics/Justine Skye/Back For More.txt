You should be right here in this drop top
Or in the sand, on the beach, let our lips lock
Sex me with a view over Mai-Tais
No Wi-Fi, you get to my hotspot
Can I be honest?
Yeah, we both want it, yeah
You're losing focus
I hope you notice

You don't miss a good thing until it's gone
You don't take me serious until I'm done
You don't miss a good thing until it's gone
And you don't take me serious until I'm done, oh whoa

You'll be back for more, yeah, yeah
You won't regret it (oh yea!), no, no
You'll be back for more
You won't regret it (oh yea!), no, no

You don't miss a good thing until it's gone
You don't take me serious until I'm done (Done, yeah)
