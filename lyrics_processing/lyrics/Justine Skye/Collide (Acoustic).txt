I've been knowing you for long enough
Damn, I need you right now
You can take your time, don't have to rush
This might take us a while, yeah
I left all the doors unlocked and
You said you're on your way
When you get here, don't you say a word
Got no time to play, yeah

I know you think that you know me
But you ain't even seen my dark side
It's reserved for you only
So baby do it right
Do me right

We can go all the time
We can move fast, then rewind
When you put your body on mine
And collide, collide
It could be one of those nights
Where we don't turn off the lights
Wanna see your body on mine
Tonight, collide
Said it's all yours if you want me, all yours if you want me
Put it down if you want me, tonight, yeah
It's all yours if you want me, all yours if you want me
Put it down like you want me, yeah yeah

Is this love or is this lust?

Got me under your spell, mm

That you won't kiss and tell, yeah



I know that this is love when we touch boy
You've got my heart
And can't nobody make me feel like you do
Boy, like you do, woah
Oh, oh woah baby

Cause baby we can go
Woah, oh woah, oh woah
When you put your body on mine
And collide, collide
It could be one of those nights
Where we don't turn off the lights
Wanna see your body on mine
Tonight, collide
Said it's all yours if you want me, all yours if you want me
Put it down if you want me, tonight, yeah
