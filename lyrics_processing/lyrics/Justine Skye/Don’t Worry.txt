But I've been standing my ground
And I'm doing just fine without you
Yeah no I don't even trip about it
And ever since you went left
I found what's right for me, loving myself and other folks too
No I don't even trip about it

Thank you for the light you showed me cause I know now
What I wish I would've know
I'm just loving life, yeah I'm just doing me
I'm strong enough when I'm alone

So you ain't gotta worry 'bout me baby (don't worry bout me baby)
I'm good, I'm good
So you ain't gotta worry 'bout me baby (don't worry bout me baby)
I'm good, yes I'm good

If I'm the one that held me down then I can hold it down for myself

Hold it down, hold it down yeah
Hold it down, hold it down yeah
Hold it down myself
