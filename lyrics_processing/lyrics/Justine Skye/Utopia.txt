Knocking on your ribs
Underneath your skin
Boy let me in
Where you wanna go?
London, Tokyo?
I need you to know
That I'm all in
We don't need nobody on this planet
And only you and me can understand it
Knocking on your ribs
Baby let me in, yeah
Tell me if you're rocking
We can ride, we can roll away
There ain't
Nothing that can stop us
No, no, no
I can feel the danger inside
But it makes me feel so alive
I'm driving in the fast lane
Going insane with you
Tell me would you let it fall down, oh
Tell me would you let it fall
Tell me would you let it all go
Tell me, tell me would you let it all go
Oh no
Would you open up you heart in front of me baby
Promise I will protect it
But you gotta let it all go
But you gotta let it all, go, oh
You might also likeOpen up your heart
Knocking on your ribs
Underneath your skin
