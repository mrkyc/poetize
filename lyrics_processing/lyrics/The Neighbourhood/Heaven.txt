There's something 'bout you, baby
There's something 'bout the way
Ya got me shaking like a seizure
No mistaking

I would die for your Heaven
I could lie here forever
Every night we're together
If you'd like, I'll do whatever
You really want
You remind me of my mom
You make me feel like God
And I'm watching you fall from above

There's something 'bout you, baby
There's something 'bout the way
Ya got me shaking like a seizure
No mistaking that I need ya
There's something 'bout you, baby
There's nothing like the way you get me high
You got a heart from Heaven
But you're burning like Hell
You might also like
Happy I took that chance on you, yeah
Bless this, put my hands on you, yeah
Letting me put my trust on you, yeah
Spending my whole advance on you
Yeah, when I'm down you know how to lift me up
From the ground, through the clouds to the sun
Tell me how did I ever find you, babe?
Tell me now that you're never gonna run

There's something 'bout you, baby
There's something 'bout the way
Ya got me shaking like a seizure
No mistaking that I need ya
There's something 'bout you, baby
There's nothing like the way you get me high
You got a heart from Heaven
But you're burning like Hell

When I feel like I'm strangled
You treat me like an angel
Show me all different angles
And I never, ever felt that way, uh
When you leave, I don't wanna try
And if you stick with me, I'll be fine
'Cause your love's rubbing off on me
Tell me how'd you get so heavenly?
There's something 'bout you, baby
There's nothing like the way you get me high
You got a heart from Heaven
