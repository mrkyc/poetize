Like a restless leaf in the autumn breeze
Once I was a tumble weed
Like a rolling stone, cold and all alone
Living for the day my train would come
I never cared for school or any golden rules
Papa used to always say, I was a useless fool
So I left my home to show 'em they was wrong
And headed out on the road, singing my song
Then one sunny day, the man, he looked my way
And everything that I dreamed of, it was real
Money, girls and cars, and big long cigars
And I caught the first plane home so papa would see

When I went home to show 'em they was wrong
All that I found was two tombstones
Somebody tell me, please, was I right or wrong?
Oh, such a sad song
Now first I got lost, then I got found
But the ones that I love are in the ground
Papa, I only wish you could see me now
Take a listen, papa
Woo, I learnt how to play my guitar
Gonna be a superstar

Stay home for mama, now
First I got lost, then I got found
The ones I love are in the ground
Won't you tell me, please, was I right or wrong?

If there's any way you can hear what I say
Papa, I never meant to do you wrong
All the money, girls and cars, and all the words, and all the cigars
Papa, I just want you to know, they couldn't take your place

When I went home to show 'em they was wrong
All that I found was two tombstones
Somebody tell me, please, was I right or wrong?
Oh, such a sad song
Now first I got lost, then I got found
But the ones that I love are in the ground
