One, two, three

Now, I'll tell you plainly, baby
What I plan to do
Say I may be crazy, woman
But I ain't no fool
See, your daddy is rich, mama
You're overdue
Now I ain't the one, baby
Been messing with you

Got bells in your mind, lady
And it's easy to see
I think it's time for me to move along
I do believe
Ah, you're tryin' to put a hook in me, baby, oh no

Now you're talking jive, woman
When you say to me
That your daddy's gonna take us in, baby
Take care of me
When you know and I know, woman
I ain't the one
I never hurt you, sweetheart
I never pulled my gun

Are you ready, boots? Walk on

Well now, all right there, missy
Let me tell you a thing or two

Now you're talking jive, woman
When you say to me
That your daddy's gonna take us in, baby
Take care of me
When you know and I know, woman
