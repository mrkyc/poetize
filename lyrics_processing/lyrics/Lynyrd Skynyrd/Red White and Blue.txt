Ooh
Mm-mmm

We don't have no plastic L.A. friends
Ain't on the edge of no popular trend
Ain't never seen the inside of that magazine GQ
We don't care if you're a lawyer or a Texas oil man
Or some waitress bustin' ass at some liquor stand
If you got soul, we hang out with people just like you

And my hair's turning white
My neck's always been red
My collar's still blue
We've always been here
Just trying to sing the truth to you
Guess you could say
We've always been red, white and blue
Oh

Ride our own bikes to Sturgis, pay our own dues
Smoking Camels and drinking domestic brews
If you want to know where I've been, just look at my hands
Yeah, I've driven by the White House, spent some time in jail
Mama cried, but she still wouldn't pay my bail
I ain't been no angel, but even God, He understands
Yeah

My daddy worked hard and so have I
We paid our taxes and gave our lives to serve this great country
So what are they complaining about?
Yeah, we love our families, we love our kids
You know it's love that makes us all so rich
That's where we're at
If they don't like it they can just, get the hell out
Yeah

But my hair's turning white
My neck's always been red
My collar's still blue
We've always been here
Just trying to sing the truth to you
