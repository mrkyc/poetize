It's a lot been going on mane
Know what I'm sayin'?
Time for me to address this shit
Tired of hearing about it
Let's go, yeah

(These hoes)
They for everybody (Everybody)
Pass them all around, they at every party (Every party)
They ain't gon be loyal, not for anybody
Still I love these hoes
(Yeah, man, I love all these hoes)
They for everybody (Everybody)
Oh, that was your girl? Oops, I'm sorry (I apologise)
Don't bring her around, this just too much money (Money, my money)
Yeah, I love these hoes (I love 'em)

She's a super freak, super freak
Met her in Liv last week
She was in there with Meek
In VIP, then she left with me
She said she fuck with Breezy
Do I wanna keep it? Nah, that ho too sleazy
Now she fuck with Jeezy
Don't believe me? The shit's all over TV
Now she work the pole, but you ain't know
That's how she make her dough
Seen her in New York
She was all throwed, forgot we met before
She say she fuck with Drake
I ain't surprised, all these hoes fucking with Drake
I asked why she out this way
Said she on a date, then she left with Trey
When will niggas learn?
Hoes like a doorknob, everybody gets a turn
Chicks be so high-class on the internet
But don't got shit she earned
She got that bag from Juicy J
She got that ass from Rudy Gay
Now your silly ass down on one knee
Fuck man, is you cray?

Man, I fell in love with a stripper
Funny thing is I fell back out of love quicker
They don't pay attention to love anyway
They only concerned with what the haters say
Bottles be turnin these girls into thots
Instagram turnin these wifes into hoes
No real life they just readin the comments
Mess with a real one and get you exposed
I had a time when my mind was caught up
My niggas was lookin like what is he on
My family was too scared to talk to a nigga
Ain't comin back now the case just got closed
She do what she told
Sharin' is carin' that pussy ain't gold
Sorry you ain't in control
You all about that money, thats shit that I throw
Just make sure you clean off that pole
They turn on the TV and get on the gram
And say that's relationship goals
Trust me don't save em' anything goes with...

Stop cuffing, my nigga (Stop all the cuffing)
Is you the police? (Well, is you?)
Is you the police? (Well, is you then?)
Is you the police? (What? What?)
Why you cuffin' my nigga? (Why you cuffing then?)
Is you the police? (Well, is you?)
