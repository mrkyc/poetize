Shit get wild, I smoke loud, your shit mild, that ain't my style
Your bitch wanna have my child, ain't that against your wedding vow?
Shawty wanna lick my crown, I'm a king, take a bow
Juicy J don't fuck around, brand new Rollie, bust it down
All this smoke, that's a pound, call my car the smoker's lounge
Copy now, got too much sauce, you'll fuck around and drown
And all these niggas bitin' off the Three Six sound
But you bitches know the difference, y'all a bunch of clowns
You a worker, I'm a boss, that shit fake, knock it off
I just left with all these bitches, need some help to fuck 'em all
Drink on ice, wrist on frost, she was like, "What's the cost?"
All night she top me off, I gave her pipe, no exhaust
