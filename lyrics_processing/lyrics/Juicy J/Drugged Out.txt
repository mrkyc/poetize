Trippy as a motherfucker man
You niggas don't get high
(Drugged out, drugged out, drugged out, drugged out, drugged out, drugged out, drugged out, drugged out)
This some good loud
Know what I'm sayin' nigga
Fuck what you talking' 'bout

I fall up in the club I'm like a walking pharmacy
If you ain't smoking what I'm smoking need to get the fuck from me
I be gettin' so fuckin' high feel like I'm hang in with the stars
Outer space swag, shawty come hang with a star
I ain't waste any drank, but whole bar on me
Fifty thousand racks, shawty that's a car on me
I'm on so many drugs feel like my heart 'bout to bust
It's so many bitches a nigga can't help, but to lust
Give me a double cup, give me some ice
I got the lean, now where's the Sprite
My weed loud and you on that "Shut the fuck up!"
Meet me on the top floor, shawty let's get fucked up

I brought the drugs in, got the club drugged out nigga
Fuck with my high and you gon' get drugged out
I got the dope dick shawty come get drugged out
And I'm lookin' for the drug mane when my drugs out
I brought the drugs in, got the club drugged out nigga
Fuck with my high and you gon' get drugged out
I got the dope dick shawty come get drugged out
And I'm lookin' for the drug mane when my drugs out

I got Kush off in my pants pocket smoking back to back
I said I was gone quit, but I just relapsed
Mane this weed got me with the munchies, I need a snack
Even after winning Oscar's, we don't know how to act
Went from Hollywood to Hollywood, racks on top of racks
Smokin' out with Snoop and Wiz Khalifa, sacks on top of sacks
Met this bitch at the awards show, man her pussy fat
I'ma take her to my mansion, and sweat her out her tracks
Fine as Halle Berry, a great dick sucker
If she get it from her momma then I want to meet her mother
The reason why I'm filthy rich, is 'cause I hustle
And I'm always throwin' up money, on the double ho

I brought the drugs in, got the club drugged out nigga
Fuck with my high and you gon' get drugged out
I got the dope dick shawty come get drugged out
And I'm lookin' for the drug mane when my drugs out
I brought the drugs in, got the club drugged out nigga
Fuck with my high and you gon' get drugged out
I got the dope dick shawty come get drugged out
