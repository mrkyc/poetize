Best in the game
I am destined for fame
And you know how the story goes
But I know where the glory goes
So I pray for those who don't know your name
Lord God make me whole again
And why am I struggling?
When I know that I am covered with
The blood of lamb, Prince of Peace
Lord forgive my enemies
And please don't let them get to me
Cuz its hard to remain consistent when they testing my religion
And they all up in my business
They some gossip heavy Christians
Can I get a witness? WHOOOOO
(HOOK)
We know your kingdoms coming
So let your will be done
Forgive our foes transgressions
As you yourself have done
Deliver from temptation
And let no evil come
(Verse 2)
Not all of us gone make it
These are the facts that we're faced with
Gotta get right with the savior
Break free of the slavery
Gotta escape the catastrophe, the tragedy
So we can see his majesty
Alpha Omega
Beginning and end
Gotta thank God for cleaning my sin
The enemy banished, God's living within
We know that he's risen, He's coming again
I wanna be righteous, this is where it begins
Pray for the foes he's judging against
If temptation a person, we'll never be friends

(Verse 3)
Long road ahead of us
Lord God is telling us...
Break free of progression
Stop seeking acceptance
Cuz we got enough to cover our neck with
Tired of being angry
Tired of being violent
You know I'm mad when I finally switch to silent
I can't go to heaven with a potty mouth
Cuz it's making my breath stink
So in new habits I'm investing
That's a hard pill I'm still digesting
But I dare to believe and i'll shout till I believe it
Cut the music...
Everybody shout what you dare to believe in
(HOOK)
We know your kingdoms coming
So let your will be done
Forgive our foes transgressions
As you yourself have done
Deliver from temptation
And let no evil come
I am the greatest rapper
In case you haven't heard
There is not a problem
Bigger than the God I serve
And if you do not like it
