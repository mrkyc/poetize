You, s-since that magic day
We've been like magnets in a play
We smash in then pull away
E-every day
You, you're a jet, a flying gun
You kill me softly with your sun
You melt my wings and call it fun
I-I should run

Faster and faster I should run
Faster and faster from your arms
Faster and faster I should run
Faster and faster from your arms

I watch my powers die
Falling out of starry skies
You kryptonite my life
E-every night
Oh the, the ending of the road
Dashing prince or horny toad?
Who really ever knows?
I-I should know
You might also like
Faster and faster I should run
Faster and faster from your arms
Faster and faster I should run
Faster and faster from your arms

Mmm, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(I'm running) I'm running, running, running
(Shakin' like a schizo) I'm shakin' like, shakin' like a schizo
('Lectric sheep) 'Lectric sheep all over my feet
(Are dancin' in the window) They dancin', dancin', dancin' in the window
(My heart beats) My heart beats, it beats for you and only you
(Its kickin' like a kick drum) And it's kickin' like a kick, kick drum
(Am I a freak?) Am I a freak? A-am I a freak?
(Or just another weirdo) Or just another little weirdo
(Call me weak) Call me weak or better yet you can call me
(Just call me your hero) You can call me your hero, baby

You can't zap down all my good times, I know right from wrong
Kissing loving's feeling good and not this feeling down
You hide your chainsaw deep in kisses that don't make it quiet
You got me running, muttering, screaming, each and every night

Faster and faster I should run
Faster and faster from your arms
Faster and faster I should run
Faster and faster from your arms
Faster and faster I should run
