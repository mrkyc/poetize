Left the city, my mama, she said don't come back home
These kids 'round killing each other, they lost their minds, they gone
They quitting school, making babies, and can barely read
Some gone on to their fall, Lord have mercy on them
1,2,3,4, your cousin's here 'round here selling dope
While they daddy, your uncle, is walkin' round, strung out
Babies with babies, and their tears keep burning
While their dreams go down the drain now

(While their dreams go down the drain now)
Are we really living, or just walking dead now?
(Are we walking dead now?)
Or dreaming of a hope riding the wings of angels?
The way we live, the way we die
What a tragedy, I'm so terrified
Daydreamers please wake up
We can't sleep no more

Love, don't make no sense, ask your neighbor
The winds have changed, it seems that they've abandoned us
The truth hurts, and so does yesterday
What good is love, if it burns bright and explodes in flames

Or dreaming of a hope riding the wings of angels?

Daydreamers please wake up
We can't sleep no more

I've seen them shooting up funerals in their Sunday clothes (Yeah)
And spending money on spinners, but won't pay college loans (Yeah)
And all you gangers and bangers, rolling dice and taking
Lives in a smoky dark, Lord have mercy on them (Yeah)
Teacher, teacher, please reach those girls in them videos (Live your life)
The little girl's just broke, and queens' confusing bling for soul
Danger, there's danger when you take off your clothes
All your dreams go down the drain, girl

Are we really living, or just walking dead now?
Or dreaming of a hope riding the wings of angels?
The way we live, the way we die (The way we live, the way we die)
What a tragedy, I'm so terrified (Daydreamer)
Daydreamers please wake up
We can't sleep no more
Lord have mercy
Have mercy, have mercy
Lord have mercy
Are really living, or just walking dead now?
Have mercy
Have mercy

We live, then we die
And we never know, that's why
So young, now we're gone
Now are you gone?
We live, then we die
But never touch the sky
So young, now we're gone
Now are you gone?
