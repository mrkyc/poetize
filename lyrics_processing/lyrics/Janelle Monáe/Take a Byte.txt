I'm not the kind of girl you take home to your mama now
I tell you no lies (I tell no lies)
Your code is programmed not to love me, but you can't pretend
Oh, what a surprise
Maybe it's lust, maybe it's love, maybe it never ends
Ooh, say your goodbyes (Say 'em now)
Play in my hair and nibble there all on my mocha skin
Yeah, just take a byte

Take a byte (Just take a byte)
Help yourself (Help yourself)
It's alright (It's alright)
I won't tell (It feels so good when you nibble on it)
Take a byte (Just take a byte)
Help yourself (You look so good, just help yourself)
Don't think twice (Don't think twice)
I won't tell

My random access memory wants you to come again
No, don't say goodbye (Don't say goodbye)
I saw my therapist, she thinks you are my magic sin
Oh, maybe she's right (Well, maybe she's right)
Well, I'll just lick an angel just to purify again
Ooh, angels are fun (They're so fun)
So dress me up, I like it better if we both pretend
Yeah, make love 'til we're numb (Oh)
