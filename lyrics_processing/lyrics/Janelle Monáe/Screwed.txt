I live my life in a magazine
I live my life on a TV screen
I live my life on birth control
I lost my mind on rock and roll

And I, I, I hear the sirens callin'
And the bombs are fallin' in the streets
We're all screwed
And ah, ah, ah, it's my birthday, baby
Thought I'd go sex crazy, but I feel so screwed
Sex, body
We're gonna crash your party

Let's get screwed
I don't care
You fucked the world up now, we'll fuck it all back down
Let's get, let's get screwed
I, I don't care
We'll put water in your guns
We'll do it all for fun
Let, let's get screwed

Wanna get screwed on a holiday
(Wanna get screwed on a holiday)
Wanna get screwed in a matinee
(Wanna get screwed in a matinee)
Wanna get screwed at a festival
(Wanna get screwed at a festival)
Wanna get screwed like an animal
You might also like
And I, I, I hear the sirens callin'
And the bombs are fallin' in the streets
We're all screwed
And ah, ah, ah, it's your birthday, baby
Thought we'd go sex crazy, but we feel so screwed
Sex, body
We're gonna crash your party

Let's get screwed
I don't care
You fucked the world up now, we'll fuck it all back down
Let's get screwed
I, I don't care
We'll put water in your guns
We'll do it all for fun
Let's get, let's get screwed

See, everything is sex
Except sex, which is power
You know power is just sex
You screw me and I'll screw you too
Everything is sex
Except sex, which is power
You know power is just sex
Now ask yourself who's screwin' you
Let's get screwed
I don't care (I don't care)
You fucked the world up now, we'll fuck it all back down
Let's get screwed
I, I don't care
We'll put water in your guns
We'll do it all for fun
Let's get screwed

I, I, I hear the sirens callin'
And the bombs are fallin' in the streets
We're all screwed
And ah, ah, ah, it's your birthday, baby
Thought we'd go sex crazy, but we feel so screwed
I, I, I hear the sirens callin'
And the bombs are fallin' in the streets

Let's get screwed, I don't care
Let's get screwed, I don't care
See, everything is sex
Except sex, which is power
You know power is just sex
You screw me and I'll screw you too
Everything is sex
Except sex, which is power
You know power is just sex
Now ask yourself who's screwin' you
Hundred men telling me cover up my areolas
While they blocking equal pay, sippin' on they Coca Colas (Oh)
Fake news, fake boobs, fake food, what's real?
Still in The Matrix eatin' on the blue pills (Oh)
The devil met with Russia and they just made a deal
We was marchin' through the street, they were blockin' every bill (Oh)
