Pynk like the inside of your, baby
Pynk behind all of the doors, crazy
Pynk like the tongue that goes down, maybe
Pynk like the paradise found
Pynk when you're blushing inside, baby
Pynk is the truth you can't hide, maybe
Pynk like the folds of your brain, crazy
Pynk as we all go insane

So here we are in the car
Leavin' traces of us down the boulevard
I wanna fall through the stars
Gettin' lost in the dark is my favorite part
Let's count the ways we could make this last forever
Sunny, money, keep it funky
Touch yo' top and let it down

(Uh) Yeah, somethin' like that
(Uh) Ah, somethin' like that
(Uh) Yeah, somethin' like that
'Cause, boy, it's cool if you got blue
We got the pynk
You might also like
Pynk like the lips around your, maybe
Pynk like the skin that's under, baby
Pynk where it's deepest inside, crazy
Pynk beyond forest and thighs
Pynk like the secrets you hide, maybe
Pynk like the lid of your eye, baby
Pynk is where all of it starts, crazy
Pynk like the holes of your heart

So here we are in the car
Leavin' traces of us down the boulevard
I wanna fall through the stars
Gettin' lost in the dark is my favorite part
Let's count the ways we could make this last forever
Sunny, money, keep it funky
Touch yo' top and let it down, huh

(Huh) Yeah, somethin' like that, uh (Somethin' like that)
(Uh) Ah, somethin' like that (Somethin' like that)
(Ooh) Yeah, somethin' like that
'Cause, boy, it's cool if you got blue
We got the pynk
(Huh) Yeah, somethin' like that (Like that)
Ah, somethin' like that (Like that)
Yeah, somethin' like that
'Cause, boy, it's cool if you got blue
We got the pynk
Pynk like the inside of your, baby (We're all just pink)
Pynk like the walls and the doors, maybe (Deep inside, we're all just pynk)
Pynk like your fingers in my, maybe
Pynk is the truth you can't hide
Pynk like your tongue going 'round, baby
Pynk like the sun going down, maybe
Pynk like the holes in your heart, baby
