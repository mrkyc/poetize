Whisper in my ear, only me and you can hear
I seen it from the back and I'm excited (Excited)
Tell me what you do when we walk up in the room, yeah
Hope it's something nasty, we can try it (Try it)
Bite me on my neck and you know what's comin' next

'Cause for your love, I'll take my time
Just wanna feel your hips on mine
