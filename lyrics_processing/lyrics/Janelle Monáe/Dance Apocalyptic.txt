Dance apocalyptic
Bands, they make her dance apocalyptic now
Bands, they make her dance apocalyptic
Bands, they make her dance apocalyptic now
(Ah) Bands, they make her dance apocalyptic

You're going crazy, the hitmen always find you
Do that dance, smoking in the girls' room
Kissin' friends, it's over like a comic book
Exploding in a bathroom stall, ah
She's so freaked out, worried 'bout the bomb threat
You bought a house, but I'm allergic to the house pets
Credit cards, they bought a new wife for shiny little lonely men

But I really, really want to thank you for dancing 'til the end
You found a way to break out
You're not afraid to break out
But I need to know if the world says it's time to go
(Dance apocalyptic) Tell me, will you break out?
(Bands, they make her dance apocalyptic now)
Smash, smash, bang, bang
(Bands, they make her dance apocalyptic)
Don't stop, sha-lang-a-lang-a-lang
Ooh baby
But I need to know if the world says it's time to go
Tell me, will you break out?
Smash, smash, bang, bang
Don't stop, sha-lang-a-lang-a-lang
Smash, smash, bang, bang
Don't stop, sha-lang-a-lang-a-lang

You gotta laugh at the zombie in the front yard
Take a bath, but nothing gets the funk off
You're on TV, rockin' and a-rollin'
'Cause the dead just love to rock and roll
(The dead just love to rock and roll)
Sick and tired of food tasting plastic
You wanna cry, but they grew up without a real kitchen
Asking why the pain is always equal
But the joy just never spreads around (Uh-uh, uh-uh)

But I really, really want to thank you for dancing 'til the end
You found a way to break out (You found a way to break out)
You're not afraid to break out (You're not afraid to break out)
But I need to know if the world says it's time to go
(Dance apocalyptic) Tell me, will you break out?
(Bands, they make her dance apocalyptic now)
Smash, smash, bang, bang
(Bands, they make her dance apocalyptic)
Don't stop, sha-lang-a-lang-a-lang
Hey baby
But I need to know if the world says it's time to go
(Dance apocalyptic) Tell me, will you break out?
(Bands, they make her dance apocalyptic now)
Smash, smash, bang, bang
(Bands, they make her dance apocalyptic)
Don't stop, sha-lang-a-lang-a-lang
(Bands, they make her dance apocalyptic now)
Smash, smash, bang, bang (I love you)
(Bands, they make her dance apocalyptic)
Don't stop, sha-lang-a-lang-a-lang
You're going crazy, the hitmen always find you
Do that dance, smoking in the girls' room
Kissing friends, keep a-rockin' and a-rollin'
'Cause the dead just love to rock and roll
(The dead just love to rock and roll)
So freaked out, worried 'bout the bomb threat
Bought a house, but I'm allergic to the house pets
Credit card, you're working nine-to-five
Just to make enough to pay your rent

But I really, really want to thank you for dancing 'til the end
You found a way to break out
You're not afraid to break out
But I need to know if the world says it's time to go
(Dance apocalyptic) Tell me, will you break out?
Smash, smash, bang, bang
(Bands, they make her dance apocalyptic now)
Don't stop, sha-lang-a-lang-a-lang
(Bands, they make her dance apocalyptic)
Oh, baby, baby
I need to know if the world says it's time to go
Tell me, will you break out?
(Bands, they make her dance apocalyptic now)
Smash, smash, bang, bang
(Bands, they make her dance apocalyptic)
Don't stop, sha-lang-a-lang-a-lang
(Bands, they make her dance apocalyptic now)
Smash, smash, bang, bang
(Bands, they make her dance apocalyptic)
Don't stop, sha-lang-a-lang-a-lang
(Bands, they make her dance) I've been...
Look at you
You look just like a little old earthquake
(Dance apocalyptic) Break it, break it
(Dance apocalyptic) You got to break it
Ain't no order in this courtroom
(Smash, smash, bang, bang)
You all going to jail
(Don't stop, sha-lang-a-lang-a-lang)

What's the matter? Your chicken taste like pork?
You have triplets instead of twins?
Is your food taste plastic?
