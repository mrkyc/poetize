Booming like a speaker with my 40 dollar sneakers
4 year old jeans wrinkled Tee and some reefer (it's me bruh)
I spread disease like the Mayflower
And outwork these dumbells with brainpower
Got it mapped out so cut the crap pal
I'm bout to max out and milk the cash cow
Kids dress to catch me perform
Gessin' I'm the best thing since internetporn (word is bond)
Bet you artists' can't weather my storm
Step aside like matadors and watch me grab a bull by the horns
Grab a rose by the thorns, grab a hoe by your groin
Count my dough by the coins and throw swords
I'm tryina live like a fat rat
Outsmart the mousetrap and snatch the cheese swiss
Drop flows like hot potatoes and show Jersey's good for more than just sopranos and tomatoes

We don't play games and we don't fake jacks
Praise the name and be glad I came back
We don't play games and we don't fake jacks
We're far from fake where the garden states at

I need a whore who does more drugs than Courtney Love
So if she sees me OD she won't bugg'
Just give me an adrenaline shot like pulp fiction
I'll hop right up and then bone the broad in the kitchen
Going for mine
Sporting new rhymes with a mind that's 420 like it's 42 dimes
Grabbing fans from thugs in Mets hats to lonely fat chicks whose best friend's their pet cats (respect that)
The V shits like Ex-Lax and hops over obstacles hurdles and setbacks
Making necks snap
And leave the stage with strategically placed deathtraps for the next act
It's like fresh wax for your Vestax
Pack your best raps ones you don't wanna test black
Drop flows like hot potatoes and show Jersey's good for more than just sopranos and tomatoes

We don't play games and we don't fake jacks
Praise the name and be glad I came back
We don't play games and we don't fake jacks
We're far from fake where the garden states at

The best you'll find and I ain't even signed
Niggas can't see me and they ain't even blind
On my grind not the time to be wasting
Come up off my lyricist of the year nomination
And a standing ovation
I leave the crowd shaking
Making outrageous sound that's groundbraking (the radio sucks)
Listening til it gags me
I'd rather drink duff and watch itchy and scratchy (now that's livin')
I keep my lungs far from dirtweed
And keep my songs bumpin' like they're fraught with herpes'
Coldblooded like my hearts a slurpie
Soft artists forfeiting call the clergy
They don't want it they'll get lost in Jersey
I be so blunted I get lost in Jersey
Regardless though I can off you early
Caught your girly and twist the topsy-turvy
Not to worry I'll return her shortly
And overdose the anecdotes you hoped would cure me
Drop flows like hot potatoes and show Jersey's good for more than just sopranos and tomatoes
We don't play games and we don't fake jacks
Praise the name and be glad I came back
We don't play games and we don't fake jacks
