Back at it again
All right okay
Yo open your three eye, to see these rhymes fly
Got kids green with envy like keylime pie
Cause they're not real, they scream white lies
I ignore 'em for queens with kingsize thighs
Captain assassin back for action
So evil I was spotted laughing watching the passions
Y'all should learn my rep is hard to earn
So don't sleep just toss and turn
I'm an arrogant a-hole in bummy apparel
With no baby ma' cause i smoked myself sterile
Man if you can't be good then be careful
When crumbs snatching out the jar by the handful
Have everyone scared and staring at me strange
As if I was speaking in arabic on an airplane
Wargames in this game that's harebrained
I bring extreme pain with the speed of a freight train

Ya heard?
That's my word
The kid is gifted sick and twisted
If you want the job done I'm the one you want enlisted
The wrong one to riff with
Ya heard?
That's my word
The kid is gifted sick and twisted
The wrong one to riff with dipshit
That's my word
Ya heard?

I'm the most deranged, overdose your brain
Claim control of the game and the whole shebang
The total package so drastic you'll get a closed casket if I happen to blow a gasket
Pay no mind to these type of cats minor raps
Just see my mind adapt and read them the riot act
Be cuttin' them no kind of slack
Hold them accountable, clown them then drown them in my talent pool
Dumb sick over drumkicks homie
Teaching new theories to these one-trick ponies
Straight at the head of the rapclass
Where I burn rappers like backdraft
Cause I don't give a rats ass
Haters talk smart but marks like I ain't the boss
But yo I just brush them off like they're pretzel-salt
It's that easy none see me
So don't glance just run while you got the chance

Ey yo you reap what you sow my friend
And if your blow is only so-so I hope you meet the reaper that's grim
Niggas is so lame
Coming with high expactations but got no game like Ron Dayne
Review the newest data it's says the test is the pursuit of failure
And I'm in the house like room raiders
Chat a boxcutter Jersey show stopper
Warning you to flow proper 'fore I cold-cock ya
Stack the deck before you bet against this carnivore
Still lose even more than what you bargained for
Audio form of the art of war rationale
You woefully overmathed vs. this powerhouse
That's without a doubt
Won't dumb it down or give you the runaround
Just swing til' you counted out
Razor sharp designing rhyme of sort
Give you a headstart then grind you to a halt
