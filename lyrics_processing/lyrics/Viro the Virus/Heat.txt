Yeah
Snowgoons waddup, haha
Viro The Virus, yeah
Still in full effect
It's Bud, Bex and Beers, haha
This is what I do
And I love it
Check me out

Yo, I see the price of cocaine must have gone way up
When I see the things these dames would do for a buck
And the rap game went lame, the industry sucks
Even these underground kids ain't up to snuff
Born sinner getting older and more bitter
Cold-hearted with a hot head and some warm liquor
Trynna figure how to get dough more quicker
And a ho to bring me more dro and more swishers
Vulgar womanizer and a violent rhymer
Bag your wife or pulverise you with a pile driver
Either or I'm what it's hitting for
Whores fighting for the ball like a bidding war
I beat rappers like pussy lips
On some big boss man Bigfoot bully shit
On some fuck who you is and who you with
I ain't new to this I'm true to it, word up
You might also like
I live this shit, breath this shit
Willing to die for it, bleed this shit
Speak my mind never plead the Fifth
Give me a beat I keep some heat to spit (like this)
I eat, sleep and breath this shit
Need this shit, cut me and I'll bleed this shit
Speak my mind never plead the Fifth
Give me a beat I keep some heat to spit (like this)

Yeah, I'm spotted frequent at the weed spot
A veteran who fights dirty call me V hot
Lord of the underground I chief rock
No kidding the kid be spitting like a beatbox
Too sick for detox
Right here is where the Buck stops
Pass the rock I'll make the clutch shot
And go hard like I'm turbocharged
Cause the flow is cream of the crop and whatnot (yeah)
I stay a notch above the losers
Counting guap getting tug jobs from cougars
Mental giant these fools are Oompa Loompas
Even their highlight reels are full of bloopers
I stick to the script, how the story go
Twist the spliff and stick my dick in the glory hole
No homo but I'm sure to blow
Like a torpedo, so shorty slow your roll

Jersey general, push past the limits to the pinnacle
Be little and imbecile with lyricals keep my thinking on critical
Weak MCs keep it on typical, not the least bit original
Rushing sickle flow take ya head clean off
Nikita Koloff pissy with the Smirnoff
Vicious with the slick talk
Seen limping with a pimp walk
Ace up my sleeve like a pit boss
When you're this nice
It's like playing with trick dice
I crack windpipes like thin ice
Bet your girl is my biggest fan
So how the world is you sleeping like tryptophan
I'm  so I skip the spam
You're a fraud dog, eat a dick and scram
Before the shit hits the fan
Think you're seeing V? Need to switch your plan, nigga


Yeah
Viro The Virus
That's what it is
Snowgoons on the beat
Yeah
Waddup
Slim DSM on the bars
It's MJ all day
Going for broke niggas
