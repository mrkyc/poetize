Let me lay it back on 'em
Let me lay it back on 'em
Uh! no nonsense, I so got this
Right back with a boot load of hot shit
Concocted to make your head bop obnoxious
The most toxic product for gross profit
Cream of the crop, I'm in the cockpit
Listners are passengers I've taken hostage
Yeah, it's like 4:20 for sure buddy
That fresh shit, expect nothin' less or more from me
Man, I don't even ship shit to stores monthly
Still got a fan-base as thick as pure honey
Just wish I had a little more money
They cuttin' hours at my day job, it ain't funny
Hunger pains keep me with a store tummy
It's a blessing I ain't dressing more bummy
But see I was destined to sketch things that's more and more funky
Until the moment I make it, I'm almost famous

You can shoot me down but I'll re-group and put it down, huh
(I try)
Yeah can't give it up, gotta keep gettin' up, what
(I try)
Lock the door and I'll hop through the window, yo
(I try)
I can almost taste it, I'm almost famous, that's why
(I try)

This is a ressurection, for fans with a recollection
Of back when it was interestin', I'm refreshing
Like a breath of fresh air with a breath mint
And each selection's a testament to my excellent word expression
The coolest, the dudest, schoolin' the foolish
You, dude's are amusing but your tunes need improvin'
Long as I'm in the game New Jerusey isn't losin'
Got students boo-hooin' and schmoozing to join my movement
Turn up my music and wake up the few who snoozing
My nightmares be ruined in their dreamscape illusions
The arch bishop, talk boss, hog business
I'm an all-star in this spit raw dog vicious
Since back in the days been known to twist up a blunt
Rap with some haze and sit back in a daze
Writin' on napkins hoping rappin' that pays
So I don't have to be a 9 to 5 rat in the maze

You can shoot me down but I'll re-group and put it down, huh
(I try)
Yeah can't give it up, gotta keep gettin' up, what
(I try)
Lock the door and I'll hop through the window, yo
(I try)
I can almost taste it, I'm almost famous, that's why
(I try)

Yo, I need more green stuff, be it weed or bucks
Or envy in the eyes of MCs who suck
Need some free time to relieve my mind
From the nightly grief and daily grind
Rise and shine, tryin' to find
The sign to help me undo the tie that binds
Can't fear the fall once you decide to climb
'cause fear can paralyze, then you'll fall behind
So, I'm still at it, tryin' to score before I'm 40
Don't rep the grown and sexy, just the immature and horny
I'd have it made if I blew up, fell off
And got 15 minutes more like Flava Flav
Yet they say, that's how the dice roll
Even though I feel like my whole bio's a typo
Starving artist, who can almost taste it
But till then I'm almost famous

You can shoot me down but I'll re-group and put it down, huh
(I try)
Yeah can't give it up, gotta keep gettin' up, what
(I try)
Lock the door and I'll hop through the window, yo
(I try)
I can almost taste it, I'm almost famous, that's why
