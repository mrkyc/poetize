One i Di. Vision
The one and only, Viro The Virus
With EyeGo/Direct

Yo; I heard a lot of shit about me - like when I'm liquored up
I can't keep my wits about me (say words)
Bust it, I offered the public the same advice Chuck did
And that's don't believe the hype or trust it
I spit rugged till punks kick buckets
Wave white flags and take flight fast
Way too much of a scrub to play the clubs
So I play the local pub with the gateway drug
Battin' they idol, illogical scholar
Change a pocket of chronic into a fist full of dollars
Loose cannon on your town's police plotter
But move too smooth to slip and get horse-collared
On a rampage like Barry Bonds roid raging on a bad day
So you better amscray
But all the party people and fans stay
Twist the bombay and pass it this way

All jokes aside, I'm just here to keep hip-hop alive
For those who think it died
It's off the handle, when I ramble
Careers get cancelled, MC's trampled
All jokes aside, I'm just trying to keep hip-hop alive
For those who think it died
I'm real with no gimmicks, keep the dro twisted
You know it's dope fo' sho' if Viro did it
You might also like
It's the savvy veteran no rapper is better than
It's just the facts, no bullcrap or embellishment
I don't care one iota for the payola
I eat your rap bars like granola
You should know that I rape wacks
So get it straight black or get the bozak ASAP
Fuck ya chinchillas and ya Maybachs
I chill in Champion hoods and take the train tracks
My mother used to study the Bible, me?
I studied Organized Konfusion vinyls
A pothead from the Boondocks
Who rocks best in ya boombox, tighter than tube socks
The answer to the question of "Who's hot?"
In a separate category from "Who's not", see
The Big V be the sure shot
With more props than Carrot Top's box

All jokes aside, I'm just here to keep Hip Hop alive
For those who think it died
It's off the handle, when I ramble
Careers get cancelled, MC's trampled
All jokes aside, I'm just trying to keep hip-hop alive
For those who think it died
I'm real with no gimmicks, keep the dro twisted
You know it's dope fo' sho' if Viro did it
I sold weed for 4 years straight
All I gained was some Nautica Tees and some court dates
And every ho I done had is now like
"Fuck that broke-ass bum, he's a scum bag"
But I'm an artist with an Artest-mentality
Storm the stands and turn fans to casualties
Wheel and deal with movers and shakers
Plus stand and deliver much sooner than later
Freak the mic like a cut
Pussy-lipped rappers try to grab it and it screams
"Unhand me at once!"
Just get me back to the mac with a blunt
Who'll make you punks wear a hat that says dunce
I ask girls to play photography
Let's go in a dark room and see what develops possibly
Don't be mad, at least I'm speaking honestly
Now ma please, follow me for sodomy
Don't have a lot but on everything I got
If I ever get broke, somebody's getting shot (blaow!)
Kid U Not, you'll have a devil of a time
Tryin' to reach this level of mine, but

All jokes aside, I'm just here to keep hip-hop alive
For those who think it died
It's off the handle, when I ramble
Careers get cancelled, MC's trampled
All jokes aside, I'm just trying to keep hip-hop alive
For those who think it died
I'm real with no gimmicks, keep the dro twisted
