The type to drop ya quick with a mafia kick
Got the hunger of a young lion
Plus the eye of the tiger
Pummel you like hes a young Tyson
That young knockout kid split ya wig
Rivera Cloverleaf snap you like a twig
You're more than welcome to step up and get f'ed up from a Hangman's Clutch or Hero's Welcome
You're just a Joe Schmo
He'll bust your chops
It's a K.O once he hammerlocks the cravate
Tomato cans don't stand a chance
No holds barred
Rolling Elbow to a bozo's jaw
It's flawless offense done with precision
Get lumped up, he's head hunting, fuck the submission
Pound for pound the best without a doubt
So come on down and get left out for the count
Better bring ya best, cuz here comes the best
Who's your hero?
It's Chris Hero
Quick to injure any contender
So who's your hero?
It's Chris Hero
Ya better call the coppers, ya mama and a doctor
Yous about to get clobbered in a slobberknocker
Cruisin' for a bruisin'
Ain't no way he's losin'
So who's your hero?
It's Chris Hero
You might also likeDon't brawl with this grappler
He'll flatten ya
They'll have to get ya with a spatula
Be his guest to leave a bloody mess
You can't F with his moveset
Take your breath in a slugfest with a suplex
Violence at its finest
Pound you with the ground game or high flyin like he's death defying
No lying this is real as it gets
A perfect mix of killer instinct with ring generalship
Apply a Double Chickenwing with a tight grip
Middle of the ring have you crying "I quit"
Lucha Libre influenced
King of wrestling undisputed
Swear to hurt you in the square circle, beat you stupid
With maneuvers higher impact than a mule kick
Leave you toothless
Number 1 champion get the job done
When the bell rings get your bell rung
Here he comes
Better bring ya best, cuz here comes the best

You'll leave the ring feeling miserable
His defense is impenetrable
So the advantage is considerable
If you want a war, bet he wants it more
Better pass a peace pipe like you're Sitting Bull
Looking for a sweet lick? Well, he ain't one
You want love? Get a show on VH1
Cuz he don't play games, boy, you'll get maimed
His main aim is to inflict pain
Leave the ring apron bloodstained
Have the crowd going wild like they're untamed
He'll win easily like you're untrained
Then grin evilly while you complain
Once again, it's
Flawless offense done with precision
Get lumped up, he's head hunting, fuck the submission
