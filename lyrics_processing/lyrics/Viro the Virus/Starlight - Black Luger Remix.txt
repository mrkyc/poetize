Yeah, Snowgoons and Viro the Virus
Afro revox

Yo, I light up the jar under the light of the stars
And write a few bars until the silence dissolves
Contemplatin' if I'm right or I'm wrong
For dedicatin' most my time to holdin' mics in my palm
My dream has been life long
And though the finish line is still outta sight within my plight I fight on
And I ain't singin' no sob stories of sad songs
I stick to tellin' the total truth and that's all
It's ironic when your rap's best thing
And yet somehow your career is still fledglin'
That's my predicament and it's perplexin'
But instead of sweatin' it I just keep progressin'
While waitin' for the stars to align
In a moment in time when it's my moment to shine
But until then I keep my eyes on the price
And try to survive night-after-night goin' for mine
Because...

In a matter, of a moment lost till the end of time
(It only takes a moment)
And the image is reflected back to the other side
(For your life to fly by)
Like a mirror held before me large as the sky is wide
(It only takes a moment)
It's the evening of another day and the end of mine
(Just to find you're outta time)

I hope the struggle don't murder me
Before I find out how many people heard of V
From Jersey to Germany
And yeah, I try to act fine as though all is well
But at times I feel like a snowball in hell
I'm tryin' to find my way, that's why it's all grunt work
Got no time for play, no time for games
So while my time remains I won't wait like a time delay
I say what I mean and mean what I say
Chasin' dreams night-by-night and day-after-day
I met a broad at the titty bar
Called 'Starlight' because her eyes twinkled like little stars
She had a smile that could shine for a million years
I told her I got a trail of a trillion tears
Asked if she could help me make it disappear
And felt no fear, when she said this here, she said

Like a mirror held before me large as the sky is wide
(It only takes a moment)
And the image is reflected back to the other side"
(For your life to fly by)
Now the starlight which has found me lost for a million years
(It only takes a moment)
Tries to linger as it fills my eyes till it disappears
(Just to find your outta time)
It only takes a moment
For your life to fly by
It only takes a moment
