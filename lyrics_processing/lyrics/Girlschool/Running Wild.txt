Never felt this way before
When I saw you standing there
Living such a wild life
Having no one else to share
You turned out to be the same
Looking for some loving
Took you into my heart
All night long we kept on running

So come on now
Give me a love that I can hold onto
I wanna take all that you have
I want it all from you
We got something tonight I know
Tomorrow you'll be gone
You'll just be a dream of mine
And I'll just carry on

(Running wild)
Hear the sound of your heartbeat
(Running wild)
Tonight we gotta do everything
You haven't seen the best of me yet, oh, oh-oh
You might also like(Running wild)
You'll hear the sound of your heartbeat
(Running wild)
Tonight we gotta do everything
You haven't seen the best of me yet

Feelings that I've never had
Have made me feel for sure
I don't want the night to end
You're all that I'm here for
Say you'll stay with me this night
And leave with the light of day
I won't ever forget your face
And how I felt this way

(Running wild)
Hear the sound of your heartbeat
(Running wild)
Tonight we gotta do everything
You haven't seen the best of me yet
(Running wild)
You'll hear the sound of your heartbeat
(Running wild)
Tonight we gotta do everything
You haven't seen the best of me yet
Ooh, we've got something tonight, I know
'Cause tomorrow you'll be gone

(Running wild)
Hear the sound of your heartbeat
(Running wild)
Tonight we gotta do everything
You haven't seen the best of me yet, oh, oh-oh
(Running wild)
You'll hear the sound of your heartbeat
(Running wild)
Tonight we gotta do everything
You haven't seen the best of me yet

We got, we got something
Running wild (running wild)
Haven't seen the best of me
Running wild (running wild)
I'll take you into my heart
Running wild (running wild)
You haven't seen the best of me
Running wild (running wild)
