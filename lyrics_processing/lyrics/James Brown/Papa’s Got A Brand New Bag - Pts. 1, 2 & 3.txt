I gotta catch it where I can swing it, I can't swing it
It's a lotta words here, man
Sounds good, though
Yeah, that's the thing, though, preachin', man
This is a hit!

Come here, sister
Papa's in the swing
He ain't too hip
About that new breed thing

He ain't no drag
Papa's got a brand new bag

Come here, mama
And dig this crazy scene
He's not too fancy
But his line is pretty clean

He ain't no drag
Papa's got a brand new bag
You might also like
He's doing The Jerk
He's doing The Fly
Don't play him cheap
'Cause you know he ain't shy
He's doing The Monkey, The Mashed Potatoes
Jump back Jack, see you later, alligator

Come here, sister
Papa's in the swing
He ain't too hip now
But I can dig the new breed thing

He ain't no drag
He's got a brand new bag

Oh papa! Doing The Jerk
Papa, he's doing The Jerk
He's doing The Twist, just like this
He's doing The Fly every day and every night
The thing, like The Boomerang
Hey!

Get loose, hey
Blow your horn!
