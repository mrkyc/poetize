'Cause I know it's true now
You got the power
And I want you to try me
'Cause I don't mind
Don't leave me bewildered
'Cause this old heart can't stand no more
And if you leave me
If you leave me
There's one thing I can do now
There's only one thing I can say
There's only one thing I can do now
There's only one thing I can say
There's only one thing I can say
I lost someone, my love
Someone who's greater than the stars above
Someone who I need
Someone who don't let my heart bleed
Someone that's the one
That's the someone
That's the someone that I lost
Don't go to strangers, come on home to me
I love you tomorrow, I love you today
Help me, help me, I'm so weak
Gee whiz, I love you, I'm so weak
I love you tomorrow
I love you tomorrow
I love you tomorrow
I love you tomorrow
But, oh, yeah
But, oh, yeah
But, oh
Come on now
Come on now
Come on now
Sometime I get a little trouble
Sometime I get a little trouble
But let me hear you say, "Yeah"
Let me hear you say, "Yeah"
Say it a little bit louder
Say it a little bit louder
I love you tomorrow
I love
I want you to come on now
I want you to come on now
I need your love so bad now
I need your love so bad now
I just want you
I love you tomorrow
I love you tomorrow
I love you tomorrow
I love you tomorrow
I love you tomorrow
I love you tomorrow
I love you tomorrow
I love you
But I'm so weak
I'm so weak
I'm so weak
I'm so weak
I'm so
I'm so weak
I'm so weak
I'm so weak
I'm so weak
I'm so weak
Help me, somebody
Help me, somebody
Help me, somebody
I love you tomorrow
I, I lost someone
A million to one
Ten thousand people
Under my false sun
Who need someone
Someone
The only one
Just that someone who needs someone now
Under the sun
To care for
To care for
Just that someone now
Mmm, yeah
Now, I got something I wanna tell everybody
And I got something I want everybody to understand now
You know we all make mistakes sometimes
And all the ways we can correct our mistakes
We got to try one more time
So I got to sing this song to you one more time
Now, I want you to know I'm not singing this song for myself now
I'm not singing this song only for myself now
I'm singing it for you too
And when I said something that make you feel good inside
When I said that little thing
I said that little part that might sting you in your heart now
I wanna hear you scream
I wanna hear you say, "Ow"
I wanna hear you say, "Ow"
Don't just say, "Ah," say, "Ow"
And I believe my work will be done
Ow
Ow
I love you tomorrow just like I love you today
I'm so weak, don't take my heart away
Ow
But come on, come on
Gee whiz, I love you
And don't go to strangers
But come on home to me
Come on home to me
And I don't want you to go to see my next door neighbor
But I'll feel a little better if you come home to me
You don't have to tell me
But I believe somebody over here loves someone
And I believe somebody out here loves someone
And I believe, I believe somebody over there loves someone
I said, it's getting a little cold outside
I wonder, do you know what I'm talking about?
I said, it's getting a little cold outside
And everybody needs somebody
Everybody needs somebody
Everybody needs somebody
You know I like to sing this song
I said, I like to sing this song
It make me think about the good things
It make me think about the good things
It make me think about the good things
Ow
Ow
Ow
Mmm
Shucks
I feel aright
I feel so good, I wanna scream
I wanna scream
I feel just like I wanna scream
But, oh
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Ow
