Every day would be like the first day of spring
Every voice would have a new song to sing
We'll sing of a joy every morning would bring
If I ruled the world
Every man would be as free as a bird
Every voice would be a voice to be heard
Take my word
And we'll treasure each day that occurred
My world is such beautiful place
Where we can seek such wonderful dreams
My world would have a smile on its face
Like the man in the moon when the moon beams
If I ruled the world
Every man would say the world was his friend, do you know
There'd be happiness that no man could end
No, my friend
Not if I ruled the world
So hold your, hold your head up high
Let the sun shine in everyone's sky
Each day will never dawn
