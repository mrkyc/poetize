Sherry was a waitress
At the only joint in town
She had a reputation
As a girl who'd been around
Down Main Street after midnight
With a brand new pack of cigs
A fresh one hanging from her lips
A beer between her legs
She'd ride down to the river
And meet with all her friends
 
The road goes on forever
And the party never ends
 
Sonny was a loner
Bolder than the rest
He was going in the Navy
But he couldn't pass the test
So he hung around town
And he sold a little pot
The law got wind of Sonny
And one day he got caught
But he was back in business
When they set him free again
You might also like 
The road goes on forever
And the party never ends
 
Sonny's playing eight ball
At the joint where Sherry works
Some drunken out-of-towner
Put his hand up Sherry's skirt
Sonny took his pool cue
Laid the drunk out on the floor
Stuffed a dollar in her tip jar
Walked out of the door
She's running right behind him
Reaching for his hand
 
The road goes on forever
And the party never ends
 
They jumped into his pick-up
Sonny jammed her down in gear
Sonny looked at Sherry
Said, "Let's get on out of here."
The stars were high above them
The moon was in the east
The sun was setting on them
When they reached Miami Beach
They got a motel by the water
And a quart of Bombay Gin
 
The road goes on forever
And the party never ends
 
They soon ran out of money
But Sonny knew a man
Who knew some Cuban refugees
Who dealt in contraband
Sonny met the Cuban
In a house just off the route
With a briefcase full of money
And a pistol in his boot
The cards were on the table
When the law came bustin' in
 
The road goes on forever
And the party never ends
 
The Cubans grabbed the goodies
Sonny grabbed the jack
He broke the bathroom window
And climbed on out the back
Sherry drove the pick-up
Through the alley on the side
Where the lawman tackled Sonny
And was reading him his rights
She stepped out in the alley
With a single-shot four-ten
 
The road goes on forever
And the party never ends
 
They left the lawman dying
And they made their get away
Got back to the motel
Just before the break of day
Sonny gave her all the money
And he blew a little kiss
If they ask you how this happened
Say I forced you into this
She watched him as his tail lights
Disappeared around the bend
 
The road goes on forever
And the party never ends
 
There's a main street after midnight
Just like it was before
Twenty-one months later
At the local grocery store
Sherry buys a paper
And a cold six-pack of beer
The headlines read that Sonny
Is going to the chair
She pulls back onto main street
In her new Mercedes-Benz
 
The road goes on forever
