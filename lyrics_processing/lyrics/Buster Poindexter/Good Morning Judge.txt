You banshees have been brought here for drinkin'
When do we start?
There'll be no shenanigans in my courtroom
The other night, I took a ride with little old Lucy Brown
We went to all the honky-tonks, we really got around
She's five-foot-two with eyes of blue and pretty as a queen
I didn't know her pop was a city cop and she was just fifteen
Good morning, Judge, why do you look so mean?
Sorry, Mr. Judge, what can the charges be?
If there's been trouble, I will plead not guilty
It must be someone else, you know it can't be me
My wife and I were separated just the other day
The last thing that she said to me was, "Brother, you will pay"
I better pay her every week, I better never fail
I said, "Before I give you a dime, I'll die right here in jail"
Good morning, Judge, why do you look so mean?
Sorry, Mr. Judge, what can the charges be?
If there's been trouble, I will plead not guilty
It must be someone else, you know it can't be me

Yeah!
I filed my income tax return, I thought I'd save some dough
I cheated just a little bit, I knew they'd never know
I got some money back this year, like I always do
You'll have to catch me before I pay, Internal Revenue
Good morning, Judge, why do you look so mean?
Sorry, Mr. Judge, what can the charges be?
If there's been trouble, I will plead not guilty
It must be someone else, you know it can't be me
I'm going to make an example out of you banshees
That this courtroom will never forget
Two hundred and eleven years for you!
Ouch!
Contempt of court?
Another thirty six years, seven hundred and fifteen years for you!
Ow!
