An Amazon with a sexual peccadillo
Broke me in
My first sin
Just tossed me around as if I was a pillow
My first sin
My first sin
She left me bound and weepin' like a willow
My first sin
She broke me in
She had a picture of a hippie
Tattooed right on her spine
That read "Viva la revolution!
Nineteen hundred and sixty-nine!"
Everybody would warn me
Baby sister would warn me
Dear old mama would warn me
All the neighbors would warn me
Everybody would warn me
You better leave that woman alone
I should have learned and let it be a lesson
My first sin
My first sin
But I went back and kept up with my messin'
Broke me in
Broke me in
Now all the priests are hooked on my confessions
My first sin
My first sin
You might also likeOh my mama used to warn her
She'd call her on the telephone
That saintly woman used to warn her
You'd better leave my poor son alone
Better leave my brother alone
Better leave my sister alone
Better leave my papa alone
Better leave my doggie alone
Oh mama used to warn her
You'd better leave my family alone
Now I'm cast out, locked in an institution
My first sin
My first sin
This straight jacket is my retribution
Broke me in
Broke me in
Forgive me Lord, I don't know what I'm doin'
My first sin
My first sin
But now there is an angry nurse here
Full fashion stockings, eight-inch heels
And every night around midnight
Into my padded cell she steals
Everybody would warn me
Baby sister would warn me
Dear old mama would warn me
All the neighbors would warn me
Everybody would warn me
You'd better leave that woman alone
