'Cause the front side look hot
And I wanna have fun
Un-sober
I'm thinking you could hook me up
With a bottle of Platinum Patron
Yeah, I wanna pop the top then roll
On ice and then
I wanna shake that a**
There's something you should know
I need to dance!
All y'all haters stop your noise
You're acting like a dumb girl going off
I'ma be right on the floor
Getting started with a little bit of "he said, she said"
Cutie baby
Roll with us, I swear you'll have a fun time
Unless the situation changes
Rockin' all night long, no party people gonna be standing
I-I-I-I see how you is
You play that game
But I'm gonna win
Bouncing hard in his sea foam Porsche
Now I'm savoring everything that he says
Hang on, hold on, get the Red Bull flowing through my veins
Ain't even heard the question but I know I'll say yes
I do it all, put it in a bowl
Scoop down low, cherry pie
You can always count on me to go and show those other girls
Just how to lay it down, down, down
All y'all haters stop your noise
You're acting like a dumb girl going off
I'ma be right on the floor
Now I'm thinking you're way too slow
But I wanna shake it with ya, give me
One more shot, get your spray on hot
You asked for cinnamon and that's just what you got
Rockin' all night long, no party people gonna be standing
I-I-I-I see how you is
You play that game
But I'm gonna win
Let's hit it
'Bout to get raw, bell's gotta ring
I'm a alchemist, the beat is my base metal
Bring me
Potatoes, and meat, and greens, and weed
I'll snooze till I gotta hit them next week
I rock poo-nani-nani
Nobody can't help me destroy the prism
Roy G. Biv, have a seat
Damn, I got car sick by the swings
And she seen me dry heaving on the interstate
Every girl get they freak on please
You are the one that can bring him to his knees
Chop that carpet low
Yeah, it's our show
So good
Right back to it, come on!
All y'all haters stop your noise
You're acting like a dumb girl going off
I'ma be right on the floor
Getting started with a little bit of "he said, she said"
Cutie baby
Roll with us, I swear you'll have a fun time
Unless the situation changes
Rockin' all night long, no party people gonna be standing
Ice cream pig
Wooden octopus
Pig-tailed bank teller
I'm gonna lick the waitress
(I'm a waitress)
Pools of Tang
(It's like ghetto poison)
Exotic garlic syrup
(Helps to wash down licorice)
Black grizzly
(Come on and back that horse up)
I'ma eat celery
