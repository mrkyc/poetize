We'd ducked our final bomb
And there we met the lady known
As Miss VD of Guam
Oh, didn't she ramble, ramble
She rambled till the navy cut her down
Admiral Nimitz gave the order
"Better keep your noses clean,"
But Miss VD was waiting
Like a bloody sex machine
Oh, didn't she ramble, ramble
She rambled till the navy cut her down
She was the queen of the Chamorros
The Mariana's pride
She didn't fornicate us all
But, Jesus, how she tried
Oh, didn't she ramble, ramble
She rambled till the navy cut her down
Her hut was in Agana
It was mostly mud and grass
But she made it seem like heaven
With a wriggle of her ass
You might also likeOh, didn't she ramble, ramble
She rambled till the navy cut her down
Oh, she did it for the Army
The Marines were happy, too
But when the Navy came she bit off
More than she could chew
Oh, didn't she ramble, ramble
She rambled till the navy cut her down
The crew from off the Maryland
Thought she was mighty fine
So, after each engagement
They'd get back into line
Oh, didn't she ramble, ramble
She rambled till the navy cut her down
At first she liked the action
The salvo and the gun
But we kept it pouring into her
Until she weighed a ton
Oh, didn't she ramble, ramble
She rambled till the navy cut her down
We wound up in VD room
And, Lord, how it did burn
But though we came out battered
Lord, we sank her in return
Oh, didn't she ramble, ramble
She rambled till the navy cut her down
A simple plaque adorns her grave
"Miss VD here was sunk
Foundered on Guam Island
In a sea of Navy spunk."
Oh, didn't she ramble, ramble
