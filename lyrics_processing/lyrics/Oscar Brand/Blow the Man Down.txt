Give me some time to blow the man down

As I was a-walking down Paradise Street
Way, hey, blow the man down
A handsome young damsel I chanced for to meet
Give me some time to blow the man down

She was round in the counter and bluffing the bow
Way, hey, blow the man down
So I put on all speed and called, "Way, hold up now"
Give me some time to blow the man down

I hold out my flipper and took her in tow
Way, hey, blow the man down
And yardarm to yardarm away we did go
Give me some time to blow the man down

Says she to me, "Will you stand true to me"
Way, hey, blow the man down
"Delighted" says I, "For a charmer so sweet"
Give me some time to blow the man down
You might also like
She drank down a pint and I swallowed a quart
Way, hey, blow the man down
She listed to starboard, I listed to port
Give me some time to blow the man down

Was up in her quarter, she piped me a 
Way, hey, blow the man down
A there on the bed, I cut lose with my sword
Give me some time to blow the man down

I ruffled her scuppers, I battled her stern
Way, hey, blow the man down
And down in her gally, I was done to a turn
Give me some time to blow the man down

But just as my cutter was a forging ahead
Way, hey, blow the man down
She hollered, "My husband!" and she jumped out of bed
Give me some time to blow the man down

He was seven foot tall with a chest like a horse
Way, hey, blow the man down
And straight for my jawbone he plotted his course
Give me some time to blow the man down
He battered my rudder, he loosened my stage
Way, hey, blow the man down
And I flew down the steps like a ship on the waves
Give me some time to blow the man down

Well, I hopped on a packet then happened along
Way, hey, blow the man down
And when I woke up, I were assigned for Hong Kong
Give me some time to blow the man down

So, young men, take warning before I belay
Way, hey, blow the man down
Don't never pay head to what pretty gals say
