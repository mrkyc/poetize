Now, my name it is Sam Hall, it is Sam Hall
And I hate you one and all
And I hate you, short and tall
You're a bunch of muckers all
Damn your eyes, damn your eyes
You're a bunch of muckers all
Damn your eyes

Oh, I killed a man they said, so they said
Yeah, I shot him through the head
Just to fill his mind with lead
And I left him there for dead
Damn his eyes, damn his eyes
I left him there for dead
Damn his eyes

Oh, the preacher, he did come, he did come
And he looked so bloody glum
As he talked of kingdom come
He can kiss my ruddy bum
Damn his eyes, damn his eyes
He can kiss my ruddy bum
Damn his eyes

And the Sheriff, he come too, he come too
With his bonny boys in blue
Saying "Sam, we'll see you through"
He can take a flying flu
Damn his eyes, damn his eyes
He can take a flying flu
Damn his eyes

To the gallows I must go, I must go
With those bastards down below
Thinking that it's a bloody show
Shouting "Sam, we told you so!"
Damn their eyes, damn their eyes
Shouting "Sam, we told you so!"
Damn their eyes

I saw Molly in the crowd, in the crowd
She was looking stooped and bowed
So I hollered right out loud
"Hey, Molly, ain't you proud?"
Damn your eyes, damn your eyes
"Hey, Molly, ain't you proud?"
Damn your eyes
Now, in heaven I do dwell, I do dwell
And the truth it is to tell
That it is a bloody cell
All the whores are down in hell
Damn their eyes, damn their eyes
The whores are down in hell
