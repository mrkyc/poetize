It was in the month of June when the flowers were in bloom
I found her sweeping out behind the barn
As she shovelled up the gobs, I so gently pinched her knobs
And asked to spin her little ball of yarn

Ball of yarn (Ball of yarn), ball of yarn (Ball of yarn)
It was then I spun her little ball of yarn
Ball of yarn (Ball of yarn), ball of yarn (Ball of yarn)
It was then I spun her little ball of yarn

She undressed before my sight, we went at it all that night
Her little frame was shakin' stem to stern
And the blackbird and the robin watched her little butt a-bobbin'
'Twas then I spun her little ball of yarn

It was two months after that in the office where I sat
Never dreamin' that she'd done me any harm
A doctor dressed in white said, "Your pecker is a sight
It's been tangled in a little ball of yarn"

It was nine months to the day in the bathtub where I lay
I felt a heavy hand upon my arm
And a policeman with a hose said, "Get up and get your clothes
You're the father of a little ball of yarn"

In my prison cell I sit with my bathrobe in the shade
The shadow of my finger on the wall
And the women as they pass thrust their hatpins up my ears
And the little mice play hopscotch with my
Ball of yarn (Ball of yarn), ball of yarn (Ball of yarn)
