Poor little Angeline

She was sweet sixteen, little Angeline
Pure and sweet and the cowboy's queen
Never had a thrill, was a virgin still
Poor little Angeline

Now the foreman he was a crud confess
The biggest bastard in the whole southwest
And he set his heart on a vital part
Of poor little Angeline

Came the country fair and the foreman was there
He was drumming and a-coming in the village square
When he chanced to see the dainty little knee
Of poor little Angeline

As she raised her skirt to avoid the dirt
Skipping o'er the puddles of the foreman's squirt
Her thigh he saw, his nerves went raw
Poor little Angeline
You might also like
So he raised his hat and he said, "Your cat
Has been hit by a horse, smashed quite flat
My buggy's in the square, I'll take you there
Poor little Angeline

They had not gone far when he stopped to spar
He dragged her in to the horseshoe bar
And he filled her with gin to tempt her to sin
Poor little Angeline

When he filled her well, they drove to a dell
And there he started in to give her hell
His spirit soared as he jumped aboard
Poor little Angeline

Angeline cried, "Rape!" as he raised her cape
But poor little thing there was no escape
Unless someone came to defend the name
Of poor little Angeline

Now, it can be told that the blacksmith bold
Had loved Angeline for years untold
He was handsome true and faithful too to
Poor little Angeline
But sad to say, on that very same day
He'd been sent to jail and was there to stay
For coming in his pants at the local dance with
Poor little Angeline

Now, the window of his cell overlooked the dell
He saw the foreman a-giving her hell
He rammed the bars with his massive arms
Poor little Angeline

He kicked the foreman square on the butt
And he kneed the villain on his low swung nut
Till he fled from the scene with a painful gut
Poor little Angeline

She said, "Darling blacksmith, I love you
I see by your trousers you love me too
I'm still undressed, come do your best
With poor little Angeline"
