We have seen our aircraft carriers, we have heard the cruisers roar
We've seen our battle wagons sweeping everything before
But we're stuck aboard this tin can till the goddamn war is o'er
Well, we ain't going to sea no more

Holy Jesus, what a hell of a way to die
Holy Jesus, what a hell of a way to die
Holy Jesus, what a hell of a way to die
We ain't going to sea no more

Submariners get the glory when they come home from the scrap
Landing craft men get promotions while the Seabees get a nap
Aviators get the medals, tin can sailors get the crap
We ain't going to sea no more

Holy Jesus, what a hell of a way to die
Holy Jesus, what a hell of a way to die
Holy Jesus, what a hell of a way to die
We ain't going to sea no more

There is rust upon the fo'c'sle, there is soot upon her stacks
There is fuel oil in her bilge and salt upon her depth charge racks
Barnacles on her bottom, and we got 'em in our cracks
Well, we ain't going to sea no more

When Marines and troops are landing, and the going's gettin' rough
Then the call goes out for tin cans, "Shell the beach and make it tough"
Then the papers praise the cruisers, and the tin cans take the guff
Well, we ain't going to sea no more

Holy Jesus, what a hell of a way to die
Holy Jesus, what a hell of a way to die
Holy Jesus, what a hell of a way to die
We ain't going to sea no more

And in the bloody battle when the fleet is in a mess (Holy Jesus, what a hell of a way to die)
They holler for the tin cans, and they send for us express (Holy Jesus, what a hell of a way to die)
Who cares if, when it's over, there's a tin can more or less (Holy Jesus, what a hell of a way to die)
Well, we ain't going to sea no more

Holy Jesus, what a hell of a way to die
Holy Jesus, what a hell of a way to die
Holy Jesus, what a hell of a way to die
