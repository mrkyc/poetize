Just Strutting Like The Meters With The Look-ka Py Py
'Cause Downtown Brooklyn Is Where I Was Born

And No One Can Stop This Flow From Flowing On
A Flow Master In Disaster With A Sound That's Gone
I'll Give A Little Shout Out To My Dad And Mom
For Bringing Me Into This World And So On
I can't stand it I know you planned it
I'm gonna set it straight, this watergate
I can't stand rocking when I'm in here
Because your crystal ball ain't so crystal clear
So while you sit back and wonder why
I got this f*cking thorn in my side
Oh my, it's a mirage
I'm tellin' y'all it's sabotage
So listen up 'cause you can't say nothin'
You'll shut me down with a push of your button?
But yo I'm out and I'm gone
I'll tell you now I keep it on and on
'cause what you see you might not get
And we can bet so don't you get souped yet
You're scheming on a thing that's a mirage
I'm trying to tell you now it's sabotage
Why; our backs are now against the wall
Listen all of y'all it's a sabotage
Listen all of y'all it's a sabotage
Listen all of y'all it's a sabotage
Listen all of y'all it's a sabotage
I can't stand it, I know you planned it
But I'm gonna set it straight this watergate
But I can't stand rockin' when I'm in this place
Because I feel disgrace because you're all in my face
But make no mistakes and switch up my channel
I'm buddy rich when I fly off the handle
What could it be, it's a mirage
You're scheming on a thing - that's sabotage
1-2 1-2 Keep It On
Listen To The Shit Because We Kick It Until Dawn
Listen To The Abstract Got It Going On
Listen To The Ladies Come On And Let Me Spawn
All Your Eggs Then You Go Up The River

Let Me Get Down To The Rhythm
Yes I'm Getting Funky And I'm Shooting All My Jism
Like John Holmes, The X-rated Nigga

Nobody's Getting Any Bigger Than This
Get It Together, Get It Together
Phone is Ringing, Oh My God
Get It Together
See What's Happening
Ad Rock's Down With The Ione
Listen To The Shit Because Both Of Them Is Boney
Got To Do It Like This Like Chachi And Joanie
Because She's The Cheese And I'm The Macaroni
So Why All The Fight And Why All The Fuss
Because I Ain't Got No Dust
Yea, You Know I'm Getting Silly
I've Got A Grandma Hazel And A Grandma Tilly
Grand Royal prez And I'm Also A Member
Born On The Cusp In The Month Of November
I Do The Patty Duke In Case You Don't Remember
Well, I Freak A Funky Beat Like The Shit Was In A Blender
Well, I'm Long Gone Word Is Born
Don't Need A Mother F*cking Fool Telling Me Right From Wrong
I Don't Think I'm Slick Nor Do I Play Like I'm Hard
But I'm a Drive The Lane Like I Was Evan Bernhard
And I've Working On My Game Because Life Is Taxing
Got To Get It Together And See What's Happening
Get It Together, Get It Together
Get It Together
See What's Happening
I Go One Two Like My Name Was Biz Mark
But I Had To Do The Shit Just Let Me Embark
On The Lyric And The Noun And The Verb
Let's Kick The Shit Off 'Cause Yo, I'm Not The Herb
Well, It's Not The Herb But The Spice With The Flavor To Spare
The Moog With The Funk For Your Derriere
While We're On That Topic, Yes I Like To Mention
When It Comes To Boning I'm Representing
Spacing, Zoning, Talkin' On The Phone And
My Brain Is Roaming And I Don't Know Where It's Going
Talking Lots Of Shit A Little Tweaking On The Weekend
I've Got To Get Him By The Reigns Because I Know That I'm Freaking
Well, I'm A Funky Skull And I'm A Scorpio
And When I Get My Flow I'm Dr On The Go
So Q-tip, What You On The Mic For
Because I Had To Talk About The Times That I Rhyme
And When M.C.S Come In My Face, I'm Like Mace
Because I Back Them Off With The Quills
Nigga 'Cause I Tell You, Nigga 'Cause I'll Keep You Under Prills
Resting On Nine One One Sixteenth Ave Off The Farmes Boulevard
I'm From Manhattan M.C.A.'s From Brooklyn
Yea, M.C.A., Your Shit Be Cooking
Praying Mantis On The Court And I Can't Be Beat
So, Yo Tip, What's Up With The Boot On Your Feet
I've Got The Timbos On The Toes And This Is How It Goes
Oh One Two, Oh My God
One Two, Oh My God, I've Got Some Shit
I've Got The Kung Fu Grip Behind My Green Trap Kit
Never Ever Ever Smoking Crack
Never Ever Ever F*cking Wack
I Eat The F*ckin' Pineapple Now & Laters
Listen To Me Now, Don't Listen To Me Later
F*ck It 'Cause I Know I Didn't Make It F*ckin' Rhyme For Real
But, Yo Technically I'm As Hard As Steel
Gonna Get It Together, Watch It, Gonna Get It Together Ma Bell
I'm Like Ma Bell, I've Got The Ill Communications
I Can Hear The Trumpets Blowing Screaming Out The End Of Time
Look Around And Listen And You'll See Every Sign
The Waters Are Polluted As The Forests Are Cut Down
Bombing And Drilling Deep Below The Ground
Check The Prophecies From Around The World
And Look Around Now As It All Unfurls
Look Into Yourself And See What Goes On
Get A Feeling In Your Heart Of The Right From Wrong
Because The Mother Earth Needs To Be Respected
Been Far From Too Long That She's Been Neglected
Race Against Race, Such A Foolish Waste
It's Like Cutting Off Your Nose To Spite Your Face
And At The End Of The Wars, What Was The Cost
It's Clear That The Earth Was The One Who Lost
We Are One With Her As She Is One With Us
It's Unreal How She Is Treated So Unjust
As Our Planet Grows Smaller Each And Every Day
Everyone Affecting Everyone In Every Way
We're All Citizens Of The World Community
All Here Together And We're Searching For Unity
Over The Years, I've Grown And Changed So Much
Things I Know Now Years Ago, I Couldn't Touch
There Are Things I've Done That I Wouldn't Do Again
But I'm Glad That I Did 'Cause I've Learned From Them
I Just Try To Stay Present Right Here, Right Now
No Worries, No Fears And Without Any Doubts
It's About Time
'Cause In These Times, These Changing Times
A Transition Is Occuring And I Am Not Blind
As The Pendlum Swings A New Age We Enter
And With Every Swing, It Draws Closer To The Center
Yes The Storm Before The Calm And The Wars That Lead To Love
Things Must Run Their Course So We Push And We Shove
But We're Here To Work It Out In One Way Or Another
To Find A Mutual Respect For Ourselves And One Another
And The True Key Is A Trust In Self
For When I Trust Myself, I Fear No One Else
I Took Control Of My Life, Just As Anyone Can
I Want Everyone To See It's In The Palm Of Your Hand
The Past Is Gone, The Future Yet Unborn
But Right Here And Now Is Where It All Goes On
I Know We Can Fix It And It's Not Too Late
I Give Respect To King And His Nonviolent Ways
I Dream And I Hope And I Won't Forget
Someday I'm Going To Visit On A Free Tibet
Someday I'm Going To See Us All Joined As One
And It Would Be Too Bad To Blow It Up Before We're Done
'Cause We Long Behind The Rage Learning From The Pain
The Love Behind The Tension Like The Sun Behind The Rain
I'm Sending Loving Light To All That Is
To All Creation And The Life We Live
I'm Not Preaching Bull Shit, Just Speaking My Mind
'Cause I'm Here Now And It's About Time
"When Two Are Served, You May Begin To Eat"
Gene Futterman
Because I Grab The Microphone And I Pick It Up
And Then I F*ck It Up And Then I Turn It In
And Then I Turn It Out, Got The Body Rockin' Sound
And Then You Know I'm Gonna Get Down And
Eat A Scooby Snack And Take Disco Nap
Because I'm Shopping At Sears, 'Cause I Don't Buy At The Gap
Sending This One Out To All The Funky Inspirations
Pretty Purdie On The Drums With The Beat Relations
Well, I'm Working On Rhymes, They're Coming Line By Line
Trying To Put What I Feel Into Word And Rhymes
I've Got A Feeling Coming On, I've Got To Make Some Shit
A Little Something Stupid, For The Twisted And Sick
Because I Drive Like A Maniac On The Streets
And I Don't Give F*ck 'Cause I've Got The Beats
Got My Nuts Swingin' From Left To Right And
Right To Left And I'm Death Defying
Alright Hear This
Alright Hear This
I Spin My Fortune On A Wheel Like Sajak
Here's The Payback Keep Going Strong Like Since The Way Back
I Try To Be Myself But I Lose Track
'Cause The Shit Gets Complicated Now I've Got To Get Back
As We Learn To Breed Love For One Another
In These Times Of Melying Cultures
I Give Respect For What's Been Borrowed And Lent
I Know This Music Comes Down From African Descent
Because I Don't Need A Magic Potion
Let Me Talk About Back Field In Motion
My Girls Got Cheeks For Weeks And I'm Happy
You Know I'm A Sneak Like My Old Grand Pappy
I Gotta Give Thanks To My Man Archie Shep
For Staying True To Inspiration And I Don't Half Step
So I Kick Out The Jams And Tell You Who I Am
And I Talk To The People Like Les Mccann
I Ask God For A Rhyme Or Two
A Little Something For The Wise As Well As The Fool
A Little Something To Affect A Little Taste Of Change
For The Together And The Strong As Well As the Dearanged
I'll Do You Right Like Bobby Knight
And Then I'm Rapping On The Mic To The Broadway Light
Stomp My Hands, I Clap My Feet And
I'm Bugging Off Yusef Lateef
I Got A Match To My Ass And I'm A Keep It Lit
I Need To Get Some Cash, Call My Accountant Britt
I'm Rushing Around Town Taking Care Of My Functions
Always Got One More Thing So Forget About Function
We Create This World And The Problems Go On
Create Our Lives And The Things That Go Wrong
So To The Deaf, The Blind, Look Around And Listen
To What It Is You Want And For What You're Wishing
Moon Me!
So, Just Sit Back And Max And Relax
Off Tracks That I Kick, Come On And Give It Up
'CauseI Get Funky Like Diaper Rash
And You Know I'm Mad Spunky And I'm Making Cash
I've Got Sex Rhymes Like Victoria's Got Secrets
To All You Porne Peepers Who Are Trying To Peep This
I'm Like Al Goldstein, I'm All About Screwing
Lead My Team To Sixty Wins Like My Man Pat Ewing
Like Getting Shot Out The Barrel Of A Wave
Like Virgin Pow On The Peaks Of A.K
Like A Sound That To The Depths Of The Soul
Well That's The Feeling That I Make My Goal
A Little Wine With My Dinner So I'm In The Grape Ape
I Feel Like A Winner When I Make A Mix Tape
Because I Get Ill When I'm On The Pause Button
And I Get My Fill And You Can't Say Nothing
More Soul On This Train Then Don Cornelious
Got The Mad Subwoofer Pumping Bass For Your Anus
Just Getting On The Mic At The Monthly Function
Wires Hitting Switches Connecting At The Junction
Perlman's Got Beats And It Ain't No Secret
Dante Found His Shit But You Know He Freaked It
And So The Story Goes On And On
Down In S.D. 50 'till Early Morning
Like The Black Birds I'm A Do It Fluid
Building Rhymes Like Buildings, Like A Stonehenge Druid
Step Up And Get Enlightened, Educating My Mind
I Play The Tape Forward, It's Not Time To Rewind
Step Inside The Mother F*cker And I Get My Flow On
Amalgamating Styles So I've Got Something To Grow On
Season's Change When It Comes Their Time
Falls Brings The Winter And On Back To Springtime
Well, It's The King Ad Rock And That's Who I Am
Listen All Of Y'all I'm Not The Son Of Sam
'Cause I'm Thin And I Don't Grin
But Check It Out People 'cause I Love To Go And Swim
Caught Up On The Phone Fiber Optic Distraction
Information Super Highway Got The Brain Contraction

Take You To Another Realm, Another Level
I've Got The Funky Rhymes But I'm Not The Funky Devil
I Step From Minute To Minute, Lifetime To Lifetime
Step From Stage To Stage To See It All Unwind
Slowly But Surely I Seek To Find My Mind
And Every Wall That I Face Is Of My Own Desig
Glendale Boulevard Boulevard
Glendale Boulevard Is Where I'm At
It's Where I'm At, Where I Live
Check It Out Because My Head Is Like A Siv

What do we know about partying or anything else?
I Don't get Blind I Don't Drink Wine

Because My Record Is Mine, Word Is Born I Rhyme
And Everey Day I Write The Book Down Line By Line
I'm Feeling Good When I Do It Like This
So Come On And Turn It Up Because You Can't Resist
Because I'm Back With Another Track Wich You Lack
'Cause Things Is Wack And That's A Fact
Because I'm On Time, You're Shouting Rewind
You Know It's Ad Rock That's Blowing Your Mind
My Shit Is Rough And You Know It Is So Damn Tough
I'm Getting Intense, Not Talking Nonsese
I Made Up My Mind, Not Sitting On The Fence
I Don't Always Know The Right From The Wrong
I Do My Best To Figure It Out And Work It Out In The Long
I Try To Do A Lot More Than I Can Chew
Balance Out My Ambition's What I've Got To Do
Because You Hide In Broad Day Light, A Parasite
A Hypocrite, You Take A Peek Quick
You Turn Your Nose Up, You Think You're High Up
You Play It Real Safe And Now Your Shit's Fake
I Seen You Hawking And Then You Clock My Style
And Then You Try To Play It Off Like You Think You're Wild
D.I.Y. That Means Do It Yourself
I Don't Sit Around Waiting For Someone's Help
Don't Sit Back And Say Good Enough
Keep On Striving, Reinventing But Keeping It Off
The Cuff
So Kick The Level Up Cuhootnified
Mackadocius Vibes Positively Fortified
I'm Throwing Rhymes Down Kicking Them Downtown
Traveling High Speed Through The Underground
I Kick It Free Style, Make It Worth Your While
I've Got Shelves Of Rhymes That I Keep On File
I'm Feeling Good Now Back Home Again
New York City Is The City That I Feel At Home In
A Blast From The Grasshoff Awhile It's Been
Stepping Into The Future Again
I'm Straight From The 88 To 93 To 94, I'm Out The Door
Step Into The Party With The Fila Fresh Gear
People Looking At Me Like I Was David Koresh Here
Kicking Rhymes From The Heart 'Cause That's Where I'm At
F*ck The Bullshit, Be It Far From Me To Pop That
In The Search For Truth, I Go A Lot Of Ways
There's Not A Lot Of Peace, That I Find These Days
I Try To Stay Cool, I Try To Stay Calm
But My Life Is Getting Hectic Like A Smoke Bomb
So I'll Say It Like The Group Huggy Bear
There's A Boy-Grrrl Revolution Of Wich You Should Be Aware
You Can't Dis Me, It Ain't Worth It, B
You Put Yourself Down And You Don't Even See
Cause I Don't Play That, I Know Who I Am
For A Minute, I Did But Now I'm Back Again
I'm Feeling Strong See, Trust Myself G
Well I Stopped Smoking Cheeba
And That Was Part Of The Key
We've Got Fire, We Need Water
There ain't No Water So I Guess I Ought To
Leave You Broke In A Comatose State Of Mind
And I'm Blind And I'm Working Overtime, So Check It
I Keep My Rhymes In A Little Black Book
And I Know You Want To Take Another Look
As I Develop The Awakening Mind I Praise The Buddha As They Shine
I Bow Before You As I Travel My Path To Join Your Ranks
I Make My Full Time Task
For The Sake Of All Beings I Seek
The Enlighted Mind That I Know I'll Reap
Respect To Shantideva And All The Others
Who Brought Down The Darma For Sisters And Brothers
I Give Thanks For This World As A Place To Learn
And For This Human Body That I Know I've Earned
And My Deepest Thanks To All Sentient Beings
For Without Them There Would Be No Place To Learn What I'm Seeing
There's Nothing Here That's Not Been Said Before
But I Put It Down Now So I'll Be Sure
To Solidify My Own Views And I'll Be Glad If It Helps
Anyone Else Out Too
If Others Disrespect Me Or Give Me Flack
I'll Stop And Think Before I React
Knowing That They're Going Through Insecure Stages
I'll Take The Opportunity To Exercise Patience
I'll See It As A Chance To Help The Other Person
Nip It In The Bud Before It Can Worsen
A Change For Me To Be Strong And Sure
As I Think On The Buddhas Who Have Come Before
As I Praise And Respect The Good They've Done
Knowing Only Love Can Conquer In Every Situation
We Need Other People In Order To Create
The Circumstances For The Learning That We're Here To Generate
Situations That Bring Up Our Deepest Fears
So We Can Work To Release Them Until They're Cleared
Therefore, It Only Makes Sense
To Thank Our Enemies Despite Their Intent
The Bodhisattva Path Is One Of Power And Strength
A Strength From Within To Go The Length
Seeing Others Are As Important As Myself
I Strive For A Happiness Of Mental Wealth
With The Interconnectedness That We Share As One
Every Action That We Take Affects Everyone
So In Deciding For What A Situation Calls
There Is A Path For The Good For All
I Try To Make My Every Action For That Highest Good
With The Altruistic Wish To Achive Buddhahood
So I Pledge Here Before Everyone Who's Listening
To Try To Make My Every Action For The Good Of All Beings
For The Rest Of My Lifetimes And Even Beyond
I Vow To Do My Best To Do No Harm
And In Times Of Doubt I Can Think On The Dharma
And The Enlightened Ones Who've Graduated Samsara
