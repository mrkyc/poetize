I don't know how I didn't see it coming
It was too good to be true
I thought she was something that she wasn't
Ah, whatcha gonna do

It was love at first sight, love at first sip
Love at first word, rolling off her lips
Love at first chance at dancing real close with the lights down low
It was love at first, aw, love at first, yeah
Love at first, baby, let down your hair
Love at first whisper, honey, don't ever let me go
It was love at first and now it hurts
It was love at first and now it hurts

I saw her the other day as she was walking
Another guy by her side
I wish I went on up and started talking
And gave him some good advice

It was love at first sight, love at first sip
Love at first word, rolling off her lips
Love at first chance at dancing real close with the lights down low
It was love at first, aw, love at first, yeah
Love at first, baby, let down your hair
Love at first whisper, honey, don't ever let me go
It was love at first and now it hurts
It was love at first and now it hurts

Someday maybe she'll get what she deserves
What goes around comes around
She'll be crazy, singing these crazy words
Kinda like I am now

It was love at first sight, love at first sip
Love at first word, rolling off her lips
Love at first chance at dancing real close with the lights down low
It was love at first, aw, love at first, yeah
Love at first, baby, let down your hair down
Love at first whisper, honey, don't ever let me go
It was love at first and now it hurts
It was love at first and now it hurts
It was love at first and now it hurts
