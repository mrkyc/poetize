When you got a little heart shaped tat
Right there in the middle of your back
But if you ask me, it makes you even more attractive
They thought it was a phase, when you bought that pawn shop bass
Join a band on the road, hit the stage, on the back beat
Girl, I love the way you slap it (uh!)
Ain't nothin' 'bout you, baby, I wanna change
Girl, you're Miranda Lambert crazy and I like you that way
You keep the sunshine in your pocket and the rain on a chain Yeah, you're a little complicated, but I like you that way
So just hold up, before you go and mix things up
I want you to know that you're an original, in a world that's so digital
You're the analog baby, you make the others invisible
Yeah, you're the kind of girl I wanna write songs about (uh huh)
Just put you on my mixtape
Turn you up loud (turn it up!)
Ain't nothin' 'bout you, baby, I wanna change (nothin' bout you baby)
Girl, you're Miranda Lambert crazy and I like you that way (yes I do girl)
You keep the sunshine in your pocket and the rain on a chain Yeah, you're a little complicated, but I like you that way
Woah, oh oh oh oh oh
Woah, oh oh oh oh oh
All the girls on the block wanna be you
All the boys lining up just to meet you
But I love it that you only see you with me (with me)
