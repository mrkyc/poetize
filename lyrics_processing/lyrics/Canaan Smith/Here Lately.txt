Feels good to sit and pick a guitar
Me, myself and a crowd of stars
Hittin' Willie while I sing some Garth's
Been doin' me good here lately
All the rockin' that I did before
Only left me always wantin' more
Now I do my rockin' sittin' on the porch
More like I should here lately

I'm a little less worried 'bout what I been missin'
A little more kinda don't care
Do a little less late night stiff drink mixin'
A lot more sunrise prayer
You can call it growin' up
Call it slowin' down
Got it finally figured out, well maybe
Just a little less chasin' what's next out there
And a lot more here lately
Here lately
Here lately

I've been thinkin' kinda different 'bout life
I been watchin' how I'm spendin' my time
Instead of my dime
That's right
Cause they ain't makin' any more of it
You might also like
I'm a little less worried 'bout what I been missin'
A little more kinda don't care
Do a little less late night stiff drink mixin'
A lot more sunrise prayer
You can call it growin' up
Call it slowin' down
Got it finally figured out, well maybe
Just a little less chasin' what's next out there
And a lot more here lately
Here lately

I'm a little less worried 'bout what I been missin', yeah
And I'm a little more lovin' and a lot more livin'

I'm a little less worried 'bout what I been missin'
A little more kinda don't care
Do a little less late night stiff drink mixin'
A lot more sunrise prayer
You can call it growin' up
Call it slowin' down
Got it finally figured out, well maybe
Just a little less chasin' what's next out there
And a lot more here lately
Here lately
