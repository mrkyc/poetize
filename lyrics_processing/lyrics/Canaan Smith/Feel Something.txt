I've been sitting here all night long
Watchin' you watch the clock on the wall
Countin' down minutes, stackin' up chairs
Wishing you could be anywhere
Stuck in this town, stuck in this bar
Living on change from a tip jar
It just ain't right for a girl like you
To look sad like you do

I wanna make you feel something
Turning that corner in your heart
And get the wheels rolling
To a blanket of a million stars
Wrap you up tight, kiss you all night
Make you feel like you ain't missing nothin'
I wanna make you feel something
Yeah

So tell me whatcha want, tell me whatcha need
Where you wanna go, who you wanna meet
We can throw pennies into that well
Do you wanna be somebody else?
Cause girl, I wouldn't change a thing about you
Baby all you need is a night or two
To shake it all off, shake it on up
In the back of a getaway truck
You might also like
I wanna make you feel something
Turning that corner in your heart
And get the wheels rolling
To a blanket of a million stars
Wrap you up tight, kiss you all night
Make you feel like you ain't missing nothin' girl
I wanna make you feel

Like you're flying down a backroad
Hanging out the window singing at the top of your lungs
Yeah
You're shining like a diamond
Getting lost in 
Baby while the night's still young

I wanna make you feel something
Yeah, baby
I wanna make you feel something
Turning that corner in your heart
And get the wheels rolling
To a blanket of a million stars
Wrap you up tight, kiss you all night
Make you feel like you ain't missing nothin'
I wanna make you feel something
Yeah baby make you feel tonight, feel tonight
Girl, I've been sitting here all night long
