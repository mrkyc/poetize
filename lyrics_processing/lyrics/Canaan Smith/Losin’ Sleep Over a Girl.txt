That third date, out a little late, after the George Strait show
She said "My daddy's gonna kill ya boy if you don't get me home"
And you can't sneak down a gravel drive, so, I pulled in real fast
She kissed me once, she kissed me twice, and I got on the gas

That sunflower perfume messed with my mind
And I lied in my bed thinkin' of her all night

Wide awake, heart racin' so hypnotized
Lost in the moment, so lost in her eyes
As the sun made its way 'cross the dark side of the world
There I was the first time losin' sleep over a girl
Losin' sleep over a girl

A little down the road and we were sold got our first place together
We were buyin' dishes, hangin' pictures, settin' up forever
I popped a bottle of cheap champagne, she said can you believe
No more 'your' place or 'my' place, looks like you're stuck with me

Those shadows on the wall and that candlelight
We were tangled up, lockin' the world outside
You might also like
Wide awake, heart racin' so hypnotized
Lost in the moment, so lost in her eyes
As the sun made its way 'cross the dark side of the world
There I was again losin' sleep over a girl
Losin' sleep over a girl

Now it's baby girl cryin' and my turn to feed her
God, knows I'm dog tired but ain't nothin' sweeter
Than every time I see her

Wide awake, heart racin' so hypnotized
Lost in the moment, so lost in her eyes
As the sun made its way 'cross the dark side of the world
And here I go again, yeah, losin' sleep over a girl
Losin' sleep over a girl
Losin' sleep over a girl
