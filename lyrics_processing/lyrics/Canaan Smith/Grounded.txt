I've been down a thousand roads
But I still hold on to my hometown area code
'Cause the memories made
And the lessons learned
Keep one hand on the wheel no matter where I turn

I'm glad my daddy took my keys when he caught me drinkin' beer
And I can't blame the coach who benched my ass my junior year
And don't forget the girl that broke my heart and wrecked my plans
'Cause they made me who I am
From the red dirt on my boots
To the red word Gospel truth
I'm tangled in these roots that keep me grounded

When I left home, well I knew it all
I was gonna tear the world up like a wreckin' ball
But the world don't care what you think you know
Now every time it hits me like a big brick wall

I'm glad my daddy took my keys when he caught me drinkin' beer
And I can't blame the coach who benched my ass my junior year
And don't forget the girl that broke my heart and wrecked my plans
'Cause they made me who I am
From the red dirt on my boots
To the red word Gospel truth
I'm tangled in these roots that keep me grounded
You might also like
I'm grounded
Like the tallest pine on top of the Blue Ridge mountains
And I wouldn't wanna be no other way

I'm glad my daddy took my keys when he caught me drinkin' beer
And I can't blame the coach who benched my ass my junior year
And everyone along the way whoever gave a damn
Y'all made me who I am
From the red dirt on my boots
To the red word Gospel truth
I'm tangled in these roots that keep me grounded
