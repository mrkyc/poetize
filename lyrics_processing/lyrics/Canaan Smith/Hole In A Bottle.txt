Got a hole in my boots
So I gotta watch where I spit
Every time I chew
Got a hole in my boots
Got a hole in my jeans
Been working so hard
They're about to fall apart
At the seams
I got a hole in my jeans

It's a Friday night
And I'm out on the town
Man you know you're gonna
Find me somewhere

There's a hole in a bottle
Tonight I'm probably in it
Taking all my worries
Gonna bury 'em down
There's a hole in a bottle
Just hit me bartender
Gonna sink to the bottom
And drink my way out
Gonna drink my way out
Gonna drink my way out

There's a hole in the wall
Where the neon lights
Shine bright as a disco ball
That's my hole in the wall
Well I got a hole in my heart
I can slide right up to some
Pretty little thing at the bar
Pass that hole in my heart

You can pop a top
You can twist that lid
Doesn't really matter
Just as long as you get

That hole in a bottle
Tonight I'm probably in it
Taking all my worries
Gonna bury 'em down
That hole in a bottle
Just hit me bartender
Gonna sink to the bottom
And drink my way out
Gonna drink my way out
Gonna drink my way out
I don't care if it's from Tennessee
Kentucky or Denver, Colorado
Make it from wheat, make it from corn
I don't really care
Just make it pour

From that hole in a bottle
Tonight I'm probably in it
Taking all my worries
Gonna bury 'em down
In that hole in a bottle
Just hit me bartender
Gonna sink to the bottom
And drink my way out
Gonna drink my way out
