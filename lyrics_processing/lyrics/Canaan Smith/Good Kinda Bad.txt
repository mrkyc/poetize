Cross around your neck but the way that you're dancin'
Girl, its flirtin' with the dirty side
Bet that cotton dress is hidin' a tattoo
That you're wantin' somebody to find
Bought you a shot of whiskey
I thought you'd be sippin' it
When I turned around you'd already finished it, finished it

You're the good, you're the good
You're the good kinda bad
You're the best shot of trouble I ever had
Got a mile wide wild side, a beautiful crazy
Wherever you wanna take me
I'm in for a ride on the dangerous side
I'm ready for the devil in that angel smile
I can see you being the fix I gotta have
Cause girl, you're the good kinda bad
(You're the good, you're the good kinda bad
You're the good, you're the good kinda bad)

Keep every boy in town wrapped around your finger
But there ain't no diamond ring
You kind of like the thought of forever
But you love that freedom thing
Strap fallin' off your shoulder
Love the way you just leave it there
I move in just a little closer
Think I'll take that dare, yeah
You might also like
You're the good, you're the good
You're the good kinda bad
You're the best shot of trouble I ever had
Got a mile wide wild side, a beautiful crazy
Wherever you wanna take me
I'm in for a ride on the dangerous side
I'm ready for the devil in that angel smile
I can see you being the fix I gotta have
Cause girl, you're the good kinda bad
(You're a little lemonade and a lotta Jack Daniels
I want all I can handle)

You're the good, you're the good
You're the good kinda bad
You're the best shot of trouble I ever had
Got a mile wide wild side, a beautiful crazy
Wherever you wanna take me
I'm in for a ride on the dangerous side
I'm ready for the devil in that angel smile
I can see you being the fix I gotta have
Cause girl, you're the good kinda bad
(You're the good, you're the good kinda bad
You're the good, you're the good kinda bad)
You're the good, you're the good kinda bad
The good kinda bad
You're the good, you're the good kinda bad
You're the good, you're the good kinda bad
