I let her go, I let her leave
I never got to gettin' down on a knee
I said some things I didn't mean
And I got a couple more of those up my sleeve

Yeah, I'm a good ol' boy with some real good intentions
And good at makin' pour decisions

So pour me somethin' tall, pour me somethin' strong
Keep another round comin' all night long
She ain't gonna call, baby's long gone
Ain't nobody tellin' me I'm doin' somethin' wrong
I'ma sit right here, drinkin' beer, reminiscin'
And probably make a couple more pour decisions
Pour decisions

Like goin' fishin' with double vision
But I'm just buzzin' like a buzz
Bass spinnin' and frog giggin'
And if you think I'm gonna change, y'all trippin'

'Cause I am what I am and I can't give a damn
I'm a man who's makin' pour decisions
You might also like
So pour me somethin' tall, pour me somethin' strong
Keep another round comin' all night long
She ain't gonna call, baby's long gone
Ain't nobody tellin' me I'm doin' somethin' wrong
I'ma sit right here, drinkin' beer, reminiscin'
And probably make a couple more pour decisions
Pour decisions

Like what I'm gonna drink
How much I'm gonna shoot
What they gonna say
That I ain't here with you
Well, I don't really care
Just throw it on my tab
Put her right there

Pour me somethin' tall, pour me somethin' strong
Keep another round comin' all night long (All night long)
'Cause she ain't gonna call, baby's long gone
Ain't nobody tellin' me I'm doin' somethin' wrong
I'ma sit right here, drinkin' beer, reminiscin'
And probably make a couple more pour decisions
Pour decisions (Woo), pour decisions (Yeah)
Probably make a couple more pour decisions (Pour decisions)
Pour decisions (Goin' fishin'), pour decisions (Double vision)
Probably make a couple more pour decisions
