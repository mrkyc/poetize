Yeah, I might be a bad boy
And I know it's midnight
Yeah, we both know you're a good girl
But come on just this one time
Oh yeah

A little party never hurt nobody
And I can't keep my eyes off you
A little Picardi never hurt nobody
So what have you got to lose?

I wanna take you there
Just take me by the hand
You'll be my runaway
I'll be your trigger man
We're gonna be alright
Baby let down your hair
We're catchin' stars tonight
I wanna take you there
We're catchin' 1, 2, 3
Baby you and me tonight
Come on, let's go
I wanna take you there
You might also like
Anywhere you wanna go
Anything you wanna do, yeah
The sky's putting on a show
But I keep lookin' at you

A little party never hurt nobody
Your secret's safe with me
A little Picardi never hurt nobody
Come on, set yourself free

I wanna take you there
Just take me by the hand
You'll be my runaway
I'll be your trigger man
We're gonna be alright
Baby let down your hair
We're catchin' stars tonight
I wanna take you there
We're catchin' 1, 2, 3
Baby you and me tonight
Come on, let's go
We're catchin' 1, 2, 3
Baby you and me tonight
Don't you wanna go?
Yeah, baby
A little party never hurt nobody
And I can't keep my eyes off you

I wanna take you there
Just take me by the hand
You'll be my runaway
I'll be your trigger man
We're gonna be alright
Baby let down your hair
We're catchin' stars tonight
I wanna take you there
We're catchin' 1, 2, 3
Baby you and me tonight
Come on, let's go
We're catchin' 1, 2, 3
Baby you and me tonight
Don't you wanna go?
