They said I would never be shit
Look at me now, look at me now
Little kids wanna be me when they come around
My high school teacher's screaming out, "No way, no how"
I made it out that drug-free zone, I'm flexing now
I'm not mad at you, for doing me wrong
Pack your bags now (Bye), move along
You can hear my pain, just rewind this song
I made it so that, you can't hurt me no more

You say I will never be shit, but peep this
I got my daddy's features
4 years ago I was walking around in dirty sneakers
My son won't miss no Easter's
I put that on P-Funk
Black and orange Challenger, the same color as Heathcliff
R.I.P. Brown Baller, aka B-Dollaz
I ascend, let me in, mi casa, su casa
This is real shit that I deal with
My grandmomma 86
I tell her everything, but if you asked her she ain't saying shit
If I should die today, make sure my son is straight
Body gone, but my spirit right next to his birthday cake
I never had a father, just ya tutor
A black flag, and that Ruger
That's your ass when I shoot ya
Sticks and stones my break my bones but words will never hurt me
That's some lying shit, cause my, my momma still used words to hurt me
They want my heart to flat line
And watch my family straight cry, but I'm goin let you done today
You might also like
They said I would never be shit
Look at me now, look at me now
Little kids wanna be me when they come around
My high school teacher's screaming out, "No way, no how"
I made it out that drug-free zone, I'm flexing now
I'm not mad at you, for doing me wrong
Pack your bags now (Bye), move along
You can hear my pain, just rewind this song
I made it so that, you can't hurt me no more

I'm so tired of these broke niggas, that said that I would never be shit
I ain't know you before nigga, hell no, I'm not in your clique
Flat lie, you asking for a flat line, and it's goin be your lucky day
R.I.P. D-Baby, R.I.P. E.Money Stacks, R.I.P. B-Dollaz
Bring my fallen soldiers back
I said it once and I'mma say it again
I work hard to get them Benjamin's
Take one of mine I'mma take 10
An animal, you're facing
Stepped up from drinking sugar water, Kool-Aid
Its a new day
Got my top down, cooling
Like Jody C., oooh yeah
Your diamonds is fooling
Mine Tucan Sam's, fruity
CINEMAX when I walk past, watch me make a movie
They said I would never be shit
Look at me now, look at me now
Little kids wanna be me when they come around
My high school teacher's screaming out, "No way, no how"
I made it out that drug-free zone, I'm flexing now
I'm not mad at you, for doing me wrong
Pack your bags now (Bye), move along
You can hear my pain, just rewind this song
