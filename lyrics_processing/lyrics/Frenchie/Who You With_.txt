Who you with? Who you with?
I ain't ever seen his face
Who you with? Who you with?
We ain't ever seen his face
Who you with? Who you with?
Look, I got the supplies
Who you with? Who you with?
Look, just hurry up and buy
Who you with? Shop and buy (4x)
Who you with? Who you with?
I ain't ever seen his face
Who you with? Who you with?
So you should never come back to this place

Who you with? Who you with? Man, it ain't plain to see
You ain't with nobody cause they know you ain't with me
You ain't living of my fame, got these hoes thinking you me
Man, it cost to be a G,  I'm my brother's keeper
You won't get that far from your car when that shottie meet ya
Dislocate your arm, have your friend roll you up a reefer
Said that you in beast mode but when a nigga piece holes
It's no more wit that G code, you wanna play the peace role
Surrounded by pussy ass niggas that said they always gon' kill me (kill me)
Soon as I look in they eyes, they shaking my hand like they feel me
They mouth is so dirty, soon as I leave, they talking so filthy (stupid)
My single didn't make it to number one? Well, next one will be

Running laps around the course, your chick got a lot to talk
Before she cross, I'ma let her know she gotta top a boss
The top , and my life is 
And also drive around in a topless Porche
Semi-auto flow
I'm a stepdad to all these niggas swag, if I fell off, they all will go
That kid is not yours, I'll take you to the Maury show
Just to hear them say it's not yours and for the world to know
So many chiefs, so where the fuck the Indians?
A lot of dollar bills, where the fuck the Benjamins?
And I stash the work in a ceiling fan
So if you get in there, hope you get out, do you get it man?
