That gangsta, you not that
You balling, then cop that
I'm hitting, my target
Anything, I pop that
Bentley, top back
Sour, I got that
BSM, losing, not that
Your cannon, pop that
Your target, drop that
Niggas be fighting, I run to the trunk boy
I'm gon' pop that
I saw ? my clique in danger
I'm gon' pop that
Chickens be shaking their ass for pen's?
I make her drop that

Your mouth you, pop that
Really, you not that
BSM, on mommy, I got that
My dick is the floor and your girl is the janitor
You know she gon' mop that
No dodging, your head
I knock off, your top back
Bring that gang shit my way
And you'll get left in a foul way
I swear my gun work for a restaurant
How it serve niggas, like Friday's
Living my life like it's a Friday
If she nineteen, no problay'
I'm a kill the girl, like the Chucky doll
Ain't it a shame how your child play?

Live my life like it's a car seat, so best believe that I'm strapped in
When you hot, girls all on you
They didn't call you, that's back then
That little Glock, we packed in
My little homie, he packing
I got myself a westside connection, riding 'round with that mac 10
Corrupt the streets that I run in, ? in my pocket
I brought homies, I brought homies, see your haters was bragging
MJ, how I moonwalk
No penny loafers, my shoes talk
Crocodile, I might bite your ass
So you be careful where you walk


Wooh Da Kid said I'm straight, Waka said I should flex
BSM is my company, I calls bounce but don't text
Wolverine, I'm on X-men, so anytime I'm gon' wreck
Magneto ? , so you should show some respect
I'm turning up, my city
Notorious, no Biggie
Making the band, no Diddy
Taking the time, like Kimmy
Taking shit, like gimme
Take a look at my ? , I got a bird game like Jimmy
A terror squad, like Remy
Hit me Reverend Run, no Diggy
