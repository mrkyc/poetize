When I hustle, boy I double up
In the streets I got them hands, don't make me fuck you up
No need to cut you up
Wasn't a father figure, just a older nigga
That taught me how to ? before they come and get ya'
My family's so superstitious, laughing at my younger pictures
I take care of mom, brothers and my younger sisters
This is my hood letter, if you don't read it fuck it
Cause if I die today, I just might feel better
I take drugs to ease the pain, for the dirty days
But when I come down off my high, I still feel the same
Everybody hates you, when you doing fine
No HBO or ? they cutting your cable line
You made me who I am today, but I ain't mad bout it
Court cases, niggas lying, but I ain't sad about it
I been through every state, four stacks every show
And I do three a month, I think that's very straight
Who are you? This knowledge coming from me to you
God don't like ugly, and I am beautiful
Blew through a hundred thousand, nothing to show for it
But I be damned if I go back to that public housing
All I know is the hood, where everybody doubt you
Pain my woman, where would I be without you
I be bussin' dead, does that make me a crook?
Before I kill a nigga, I write in this notebook
You might also like
This is my hood letter, my hood letter
My hood letter, if you don't read it fuck it
My hood leter, my hood letter
My hood letter, I don't gotta rhyme

I think I lost the air, running from foster care
I couldn't turn my back, I was forced to care
This world is cursed with a disease, and I'm the penetration
I catch a HIV, but that's a home invasion
Been on MTV, also BET
Yelling Squad, Bricksquad Monopoly
Come and cop a key
But I'ma tell you before you pull out your money them niggas didn't get this drop from me
I don't like none of you rappers, I'm a different breed
But I like some of you rappers, what you got for me?
Especially when these sucka's start jocking me
