Welcome to my concrete jungle, you don't live this life
Trapping, stacking, macking, I don't live that twice
First I gotta think Gucc', then I gotta thank Flock'
And the boys ? , you the main reason a nigga off of the block
Welcome to my concrete jungle, step into my concrete jungle
Can't forget Wooh, ? Juice, you taught a nigga how to be humble
Brick Squad, I'ma yell it out
This is my family culture , So Icey reside in the south

Welcome to my concrete jungle, listen to the words I say
Don't ask me why, I was raised this way
Gorillas, lions and bears, they was always around my way
I got bananas for the apes, and a cage for the lion if he come this way
Yeah bitch, come near
Hibernate, you better live that way
I ain't scared to prepare for no niggas
Got some duct tape and a chair for these niggas
I run with dogs, beware of these niggas
I told you before, I prepared these niggas
You come with your girl, but she out when I get her
Living with pride, I won't fold for no nigga
Catch a cold when you living in the street, right?
Snitching? That's the thing you don't do
Tell her to come home early? What you think that's gon' do?
It's only gon' lead to when you come home, all eyes on you
Another black nigga going in, ? running down on you
