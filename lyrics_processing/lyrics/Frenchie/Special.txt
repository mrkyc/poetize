I'm so special, very special
I was raised around killers nigga, them boys will stretch you
You no gorilla figga', you just a nigga that's extra
You ain't got no scrilla' dealer, it's just the nigga you next to
If I die before my sleep, I pray the lord my soul to keep
I'm gon' make your bed spread, you gon' get eternal sleep
Bouncing like a '64, amaze them how I hit the streets
You gon' take that shit off, or fall victim to this beef

I'm so special, very special
Bred special, that's who you ought to stand next to
Something special, very special
Thankful for everything I get, very special
I'm so special, very special
I need a ten ? , call me special
I'm so special, very special
I need a ten ? , call me special

Joffy, I got special bread
One reach, nigga blink you dead
No train, no we fly here
I got it made, nigga special ed
In your town, niggas body's drop
In the club, nigga bottles pop
I got plenty bands, no rubber bands
That butter here, on the bread I spread
Three steps and spin, on my wild west
Make a nigga lose breath, that shotty' right here I call her bench press
You like working out, these shells will leave your ? rolling
Enough of those will hit your face, will get your casket closed
You might also like
I'm so special, very special
Bred special, that's who you ought to stand next to
Something special, very special
Thankful for everything I get, very special
I'm so special, very special
I need a ten ? , call me special
I'm so special, very special

Grab the keys to the Phantom nigga, I'm ghost though
Charm matching that Bezel
Plus my chain got too much water, niggas think Zoe's a ?
? got me with four broads, can't you tell that I'm special?
This Ruger fresh out this box, but big holes in 'em like pretzels
 , grip that steering wheel and I'm gone
Superman bands spent on that necklace, plus your insurance here on my arm
Don't be staring, nigga I'm on
Been this trap shit in my lifestyle
My jewelry got you like Ray Charles
And I'm dope here on this song, Zoe'

I'm so special, very special
Bred special, that's who you ought to stand next to
Something special, very special
Thankful for everything I get, very special
I'm so special, very special
I need a ten ? , call me special
