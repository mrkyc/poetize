Uh, we built this company together now you buggin' out
Throw my hands on you, na, but I don't wanna sock you out
Yeah
You got me screaming out fuck you
You don't want me to have what I have (jealous)
Cause in my eyes you a fuck nigga
And one G you gon' make me hurt you bad
Oooooooooo

Its kind of hard for me to trust people
I lost everything I ever loved
And when your friends turn into enemies
Its hurt to kill 'em OJ with a glove
Sometimes, Sometimes
It come a time in life that you feel down
Sometimes, Sometimes
I pray to god for a way out

Uh, we built this company together now you buggin' out
Throw my hands on you, na, but I don't wanna sock you out
Yeah
You got me screaming out fuck you
You don't want me to have what I have (jealous)
Cause in my eyes you a fuck nigga
And one G baby, you gon' make me hurt you bad
It hurts to know we broke apart
But it's better for me and better for you we both apart
I ain't never been hurt like this So Icy before Bricksquad
But you the nigga that got a bitch heart
You said you brought your whole clique cost
Where they at huh Trap God?
When I first met you didn't trust you
Be the same as your muscle
I'm moving on my hustle
Middle fingas up like fuck you
You might also like
Its kind of hard for me to trust people
I lost everything I ever loved
And when your friends turn into enemies
Its hurt to kill 'em OJ with a glove
Sometimes, Sometimes
It come a time in life that you feel down
Sometimes, Sometimes
