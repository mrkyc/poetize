The same niggas that I start with, the same niggas that I leave with
Same niggas that you start with, same niggas you catch beef with
And these niggas do not respect you homie
You say you getting money, nigga show me
Pour out some liquor for my dead dogs
Pour out some liquor for my dead dogs
Don't walk if you ain't real dog
Don't walk if you ain't real dog

Don't walk if you ain't real dog
My niggas know where you live dog
I'm walking in your crib dog
Opening your fridge dog
Dope man I came up, don't be preaching them lies
Don't call me a pilot, my altitude is too fly
Same niggas that I start with, same niggas that I leave with
The same niggas I break bread with, the same niggas that I eat with
Salute, all my P. dogs
Salue, for the P. dog
Don't show your strap if you ain't real dog
Don't bark unless you're real dog

The same niggas that I start with, the same niggas that I leave with
Same niggas that you start with, same niggas you catch beef with
And these niggas do not respect you homie
You say you getting money, nigga show me
Pour out some liquor for my dead dogs
Pour out some liquor for my dead dogs
Don't walk if you ain't real dog
Don't walk if you ain't real dog
You might also like
Don't bark if you ain't real dog
Fuck around and go in your grill dog
I'm not telling fuck niggas how I feel dog
Pussy, don't fight it, keep it real dog
Me and Frenchie in the six, the top down
All the hoes that used to front on me, they gon' pop now
Pull up in your hood, shut your block down
Know I got that forty, don't get shot down

The same niggas that I start with, the same niggas that I leave with
Same niggas that you start with, same niggas you catch beef with
And these niggas do not respect you homie
You say you getting money, nigga show me
Pour out some liquor for my dead dogs
Pour out some liquor for my dead dogs
Don't walk if you ain't real dog
