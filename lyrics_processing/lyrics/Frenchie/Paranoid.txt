I'm paranoid, nigga
So I don't keep the doors locked
My mama screaming out
Please son, keep the doors locked
I see you through my window
This ain't your block, I see you talk a lot
'Bout all the things that you're not
You talk it, I live it, you talk it, I live it, you talk it, I live it
I did it
You talk it, I live it, you talk it, I live it, you talk it, I live it
I mean it

You don't know who they are
All black on with them scarves
No contracts, they'll make contact
It's a wonderful life for these stars
Boy I shine far like a star
One me, four pistols in the car
One driver, me
Heat, that's the only passengers in this car
The same way that you came in is the same way that you gon' go out
Look you came out of a pussy, you can die pussy
See? It's the same route
You don't talk the same with them thangs out
You got to play the game just to remain the same
But you flaunt so hard with your chain out
But the rule of the game, they got to know your name
You run into fire and your thing don't bang?
Wanted to shoot but your gun is jammed?
It ain't hard to put a nigga to sleep
I'm the nigga to creep
Your whole 
You might also like
I'm paranoid, nigga
So I don't keep the doors locked
My mama screaming out
Please son, keep the doors locked
I see you through my window
This ain't your block, I see you talk a lot
'Bout all the things that you're not
You talk it, I live it, you talk it, I live it, you talk it, I live it
I did it
You talk it, I live it, you talk it, I live it, you talk it, I live it
I mean it

I really live it nigga, this ain't just a rap song
And I'm really getting it, hit me on the trap phone
In the trap zone
Trapping all day 'til the pack gone
While you worried 'bout me and who I done served
Police ass nigga, which one you working?
Rapping ass niggas getting on my nerves
I talk what I know and not what I heard
Hundred thousand dollars in the attic
Hundred bales of mid and they all wrapped in plastic
Hundred round drum, nigga rob, you can have it
Br-Br-Brrrr! Chopper tag-matic
I-I-I-I-I got cameras all in my trap house
I can tell when y'all niggas coming
Don't do it to yourself, shooters shoot for me only
You talk it, I live it
You talk it, I seen it and still can't believe it
These niggas ain't talking that English
Don't come with the paper, they chopping off fingers
I'm paranoid, nigga
So I don't keep the doors locked
My mama screaming out
Please son, keep the doors locked
I see you through my window
This ain't your block, I see you talk a lot
'Bout all the things that you're not
You talk it, I live it, you talk it, I live it, you talk it, I live it
I did it
You talk it, I live it, you talk it, I live it, you talk it, I live it
