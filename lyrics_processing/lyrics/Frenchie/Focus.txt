There's a lot of shit in my way, trying to throw me off
But I'ma make it my job, just to piss you off
Stay focused, I just gotta stay focused
I can see that you know this, I can see that you know this

I gotta stay true, whip without the roof
Waka, Wooh, OJ Juice
Frenchie, man the truth
I'm riding with my niggas deep, I don't need a coupe
I'm repping South Jamaica, Queens, 50 what it do
Be thankful you don't live here, got OG's and they still here
You better watch your step, cause trespassing get real here
I don't give a fuck how you feel here
It's real niggas that kill here
Hundred thousand, no deal here
Niggas do what they feel here

There's a lot of shit in my way, trying to throw me off
But I'ma make it my job, just to piss you off
Stay focused, I just gotta stay focused
I can see that you know this, I can see that you know this

I see a lot more, then these other niggas do
I'm just trying to live, I won't mention you
Family first, friends, then my fans next
But niggas hating on us, I just need a check
To get my niggas out, that's what I'm about
But I can't pay my bills, in my mama house
Gotta stay focused like fort, nigga
Eviction on my door, nigga
Can't take a loss I need more, nigga
I ain't worried bout no whore, nigga

There's a lot of shit in my way, trying to throw me off
But I'ma make it my job, just to piss you off
Stay focused, I just gotta stay focused
I can see that you know this, I can see that you know this

Couldn't walk a mile in my problems
See my life through binoculars
Cause we totting them choppers
One call, get the chopper
? died, then Dunk died, then they took ?
My soul dry, no tears to cry
So I just get high and keep my head screwed tight
Cause a lot of dudes write
Them whips touching your fam', trying to make it through the night
They know where I been, and what I've done
They seen what I saw, where I come from

There's a lot of shit in my way, trying to throw me off
But I'ma make it my job, just to piss you off
Stay focused, I just gotta stay focused
