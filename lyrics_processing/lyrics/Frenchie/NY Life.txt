Every morning that I roll up, uh
I got scripts of the lean, motherfucker left, pour up, gun smoke
Smell it in the morning
Little nigga that'll wake you up, fuck yeah I'm dressing up
Got hands, I fuck you up
Living in New York, these niggas wanna be like us
Yankee hats forever, (we rock them) Yankee hats forever
(We got them) Yankee hats forever, (we rock them) Yankee hats forever
We got pills and rap, molly's got deals on that
Fifty-thousand in your bag, go see my build for that
Fuck y'all can see I'm high, and I'm fly
Valencia, shoe's on mine
? belt, somebody needa' call the pilot cause I'm way too fly
Riding in the 6 with the roof cut off
Phony French, you need to cut off
I ain't losing, nigga not at all
Running your mouth, you need to knock off

You might catch me in Perfections, looking like a boss
Tell the waiter clear my section, come and wipe me off
Brooklyn I be gooned out, Queens got me hella' fly
Manhattan girls are like, welcome to N.Y
Yankee hats forever, (we rock them) Yankee hats forever
(We got them) Yankee hats forever, (we rock them) Yankee hats forever
Cold day out, but you know them niggas still outside
Ain't no place I'd hide, welcome to N.Y

Uh, my nigga said he wanna fly out to get him, some
Three pounds of that sticky stuff, he want you some
Bitch, take your motherfucking clothes off let's have some fun, shit
I be looking that fly every time I walk by these hoes
Serving in the west, when you know that's a sign that I control
When I leave, still control
New York nigga till I get old
You never gon' shine, so stay in the dark
This nina', will hit you, and tear you apart
I light up the coupe, and knock out your neon
The beam on will hit you, before you can park
Fuck with a nigga, slide with a nigga
Let 'em know that I am a G, fuck with me
Henessy on the ? nigga, gotta get high, live nigga
You can see that I'm holding a little of spark
You playing the target, so here goes the dart
My Yankee cap on, you know I'm gon' floss
The people running the region, the top peeled off

You might catch me in Perfections, looking like a boss
Tell the waiter clear my section, come and wipe me off
Brooklyn I be gooned out, Queens got me hella' fly
Manhattan girls are like, welcome to N.Y
Yankee hats forever, (we rock them) Yankee hats forever
(We got them) Yankee hats forever, (we rock them) Yankee hats forever
Cold day out, but you know them niggas still outside
