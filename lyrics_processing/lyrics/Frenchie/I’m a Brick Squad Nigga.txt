I'm a Brick Squad nigga doing what the fuck I wanna do
What the fuck I wanna do, what the fuck I wanna do (3x)
I'm a Brick Squad nigga doing what the fuck I wanna do
Psycho, bitch I'm warning you
That's your girl I'm talking to

I'm a Brick Squad nigga doing what the fuck I wanna do
I'm warning you, I kill clowns, ask them 'bout the carnival
I'm high like The Creator, you a dreamchaser
I'm a dictator, your chick a dick taker
Brick Squad, dick broads, you'll damn save her
In other words, you're named, you're named the Caped Crusader
I'm in my trap
So 9 times out of 10, you got shot by a nigga that listens to my raps
Nigga, I deal this cards, you best believe my ace of spades
Rainbow diamonds, different colors like the gay parade
David Ruffin, I got sunshine on the month of May
I got cocoa with no butter- that's pure yay
I say Brick Squad, that's what we all in
When I say Brick Squad, I'm kicking your door in
So you should know that we be on that gutter shit
If you ain't Brick Squad, go rep another clique

I do what the fuck I wanna do, let me tell ya
Get that money out the streets, I got that dirty paper
Get crossed off, Cartel the Terminator
Smoking my blunt, drinking my 
Wrapping bales up like some damn mummies
Shrimp, steak and Rozay all up in my tummy
And yeah, I fuck with meth, I got sharks for the zombies
Got partners in the pin, partners in the county
Brick Squad everythang, diamonds on my pinky rang
Sagging my 5-0-1's, I let my nuts hang
Still in the kitchen bustin' down bricks of cocaine
Keep this shit a hunna, keep in gutta, I will never change
Mafioso swag, I'm moving too much bags
My fingers hurt, I'm counting to much cash
Ready for war, I'm ready for that action
I do what the fuck I wanna do, I ain't askin' (Maf-Mafia!)


We the fuckin' squad, pussy nigga what you wanna do?
Get my time wrong, ain't no secret, bitch I'm murking ya
We getting it, we getting it,  we taking it
We see you plottin', we hear you niggas hatin'
But fuck that, we Brick Squad, Brick Squad, we Brick Squad
Frenchie, Waka, Hootie, Dunkin, Wooh Da Kid, that's Brick Squad
All my Zoes they fuck with us
Compton Bloods, they fuck with us
Real niggas, they fuck with us
Fuck your state, we prosperous
Anytime, anywhere, B.S.M., we everywhere
We gettin' money, fuck a hater
You see my chain, I'm icy, nigga
New whip- drop top. New bitch- top notch
We smell beef? Gun cocked
You a fuck nigga? Pow Pow!
