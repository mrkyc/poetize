Ten racks, twenty racks, I turn that to thirty racks
Believe me I've been on, way before the racks
Forty racks, fifty racks, I turn that to sixty racks
No more, I don't gotta buy it, I'ma order that
My money come six digits, I got more than six chickens
If your kitchens dirty nigga, I'm gon' come and do the dishes
Bow, nigga that's my middle name
One in your house, cause there's two on my wrists
Jack pot, I'm screaming cha-ching
I'm currently busy, I'm doing my thing

I'm currently busy, I'm doing my thing
I'm in the game, nigga
I'm feeding my niggas, you should do the same
That is a shame, nigga
Lost two of my niggas, I'm feeling the pain
You ain't the same, nigga
RIP Daddy I'm banging your name in vein
Frenchie, that's my name nigga
? I'm so official, you don't bang nigga
Totting the hammer should not be an issue, you just a lame nigga
Fighting over hammer charge
They don't want me feeding my family, they want me behind bars
Is that because I am a 80's baby?
Can you see how many people hate me?
Daddy died, ATF came inside
I was five, and I felt like nine-million baby
You should know I speak the (Oooh), come to my block they selling that (Oooh)
A lot of these niggas don't know what do to
Don't dig in my pot, you breaking the (Oooh)

I know they see the rocks is a cold blizzard
These niggas talking money, don't know digits
I turned a whole half, into four chickens
I'm live, money is my middle name
Look at the rock, nigga look at the chain
You only see one, but got ten different rings
Fuck you broke niggas know about it
My bread down, and I bet it's hooked
Niggas front like they know me
I control this shit like I'm Westbrook, but a shooter just like Ginobili
Boy that's head crack, and you owe me
You broke nigga, that watch is mine
I should clap you and your ? , but you bum niggas ain't worth the nine
My daughter nigga, she worth the time
Surfing 'round in these streets
I'll do life just to make sure she's fine, so I ride around with that heat
ZB ride around on this beat, took that fly shit and my head swoll'
And my swag nigga, you been stole it
Reason they all on me, Zoe
