I run my city, I call the shots
From corner to corner, I run them blocks
I'm on my grind, on my way to the top
Them niggas hate, boy like it or not
I took over the streets
I took over the streets
I took over the streets
I took over the streets
The city is mine
The city is mine
The city is mine
I run them blocks

I run my city so much when I leave my city
I take them with me, praying father forgive me
But you hating me cause I don't here that shit you kickin'
Would you hate me more if I tell you I'm not a Christian?
A whole lot different, walk what you say
I just know there's one god, now kneel and pray
For better days, You see death around the corner, it's a mile away
Me, I'm ? everyday
I'm my brother's keeper, I don't buy the Royce
I just break the Royce, cause I'm known as Chiefa'
Showtimes rocking on me, them them new Adidas
Check, check my clockwork, ? that for a feature

From corner to corner, I'm calling shots
You need that work, we got that drop
Your bitches work for me, like it or not
I took over the streets, now these niggas wanna murder me
They on the lurk for me, but I burn 'em like third degree
If a nigga try flexing, point him out and I stretch 'em
? make them bullets fly like Jetson's
This mac up so get backed up,y'all niggas better get strapped up
I come through masked up, saying nigga back up
I got diamonds all in my chain, my bullets never complain
I be stepping on purple, just to drive these bitches insane
I run my city, I call the shots
From corner to corner, I run them blocks
I'm on my grind, on my way to the top
Them niggas hate, boy like it or not
I took over the streets
