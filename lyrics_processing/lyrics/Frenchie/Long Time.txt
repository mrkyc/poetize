It's been a long time, very long time since I seen her
I think about her everyday, but I don't really need her
I used to call you my girl, I don't need her
And you don't either
I thought I'd never ever leave her, now I'm speeding
Let's turn our love around, make it easy
She thinks I love her, but I don't need her

I'm tired of hurting
She thinks I love her, but I don't even
You think you love her but you don't either
She gives you the run around every time you see her
I'm just gonna dick her down, make her a believer
You know it's worth it
Baby girl you know I'm working
You don't give a fuck if a nigga gotta do the jail time
Foul mind, you just worried about them Louie purses
That's why I'm here looking for a chick, you know I'm lurking
And when I find her I'ma come show you on purpose

It's been a long time, very long time since I seen her
I think about her everyday, but I don't really need her
I used to call you my girl, I don't need her
And you don't either
I thought I'd never ever leave her, now I'm speeding
Let's turn our love around, make it easy
She thinks I love her, I don't need her
I'm tired of searching

Panoramic, nice ride, I seen your house on the right side
Your girl was watching, had her mouth wide
True to the game like a pimp with a cane
Like Goldy Mac these hoes know my name
How they supposed to treat you the same?
I'm a mac, you a lame
I walk inside this club and watch the crowd turn up
You try to rob my chain and that's a bloody murder
And yeah I took your bitch but I don't really need her
I just did it to show you how fast that chick'll leave you
