Homicide, looking for another body
Don't ask questions, we ain't talking to nobody
Broke out the zoo cause I am a gorilla
Like fuck the judge, like I am not a killa'
No witnesses, so where's your proof?
I ain't killed that man, who said that, you?
Don't make me mouth cause I'm a blood spilla'
You are dealing with a fuck nigga

You are dealing with a fuck nigga
Short man complex, I wish I was bigga'
My boys don't think they some wild niggas
Soon as I blink you'll be a dead nigga
Stood on the trap like Dunkin, you ain't good for me
You trying to lock me up, take my hood from me
Look at my lawyer like shit, do what you could for me
Get me off cause you know I'm paying good money
Get it right

This work will make me catch one, assault and battery
My confession, got these niggas switching sides like a intersession
Interrogation, they throwing curves
Fuck what you heard, don't say a word
Put this on my bandanna, I'm gon' rap for this
Propaganda's I address, I am not a snitch
Fuck your mean muggin', ball up your fists
Throw a jab or something, and let it vent

Peek-a-boo you see me, iced out V-V's
Panoramic roof, look like flat screen TV's
She says she'll never leave me, but she did like Houdini
Disappear, then she reappeared, when she heard my CD
D.A. try to slay me, got a lawyer dog, no legal aid
Testify grand jury, y'all niggas will just talk away
I do my dirt by my lonely, so it's very easy for me to walk away
That fuck shit that you doing, cut it out you could be gone today
