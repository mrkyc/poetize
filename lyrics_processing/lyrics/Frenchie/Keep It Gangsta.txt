Keep it gangsta nigga
Keep it gangsta nigga
Keep it gangsta nigga
Keep it gangsta

Muthafuckas screaming out crime don't pay
When I was a little nigga had to find my way
Bandana wrapped it infront of my K
I ain't gotta move if you come way
Cause you dealing with a boss
You don't really want a war
Really though, you soft
How many killers did you ever come across
Keep it gangsta nigga
Muthafuckas screaming out crime don't pay
When I was a little nigga had to find my way
Bandana wrapped it infront of my K
I ain't gotta move if you come way
Cause you dealing with a boss
You don't really want a war
Really though, you soft
How many killers did you ever come across
Keep it gangsta nigga
You might also like
Did you ever see a dead body?
If you did would you talk about it?
If the feds came, would you give your last name up, in the courtroom, swearing that you'd tell um bout it?
Man, I'mma take um way back
Damion Wayans, this homie don't play that
But I got a lock in the sock, I crack you upside of your head, push your hairline way back
Muthafuckers screaming out crime don't pay
When I was a little nigga had to find my, own block to sell these rocks on
I Came a long way looking from the sidelines
We can get it popping like popcorn
You'll be the first to get popped on
I can look into your eyes, you are not armed
Get up off my dick, don't ride mines

Muthafuckas screaming out crime don't pay
When I was a little nigga had to find my way
Bandana wrapped it infront of my K
I ain't gotta move if you come way
Cause you dealing with a boss
You don't really want a war
Really though, you soft

Keep it gangsta nigga
You don't wanna die lil nigga don't tempt me
Gun all black like Waka in the Bentley
100 round drum, I can make it go empty
I don't talk shit, I'm just telling you simply
Yeah I got the strap everywhere that I go
I ain't worried bout shit, nah nigga we good
And I rep the mob everywhere that I'm at
You niggas know SONY, known G in his hood
On my shit screaming fuck your feelings
New drop top, nigga fuck your ceilings
And I get top off this brand new Rollie
Back in the trap tryna touch these millions
I'mma keep it real I don't feel these niggas
And you know the deal, SONY kill these niggas
Just told Frenchie get a brand new mop
Got a brand new Glock, I spill these niggas
Squad
