Go ahead 'n ask anything you want
Do I miss you? I can't say I don't
Put me on trial but I won't tell
If I want you and I always will
Uh huh uh huh
Right hand on the Bible
Uh huh uh huh
The other on a bottle

Have I ever mixed your memory with Tennessee?
Have I ever dialed you up, but never let it ring?
Do I wonder where you are with every sip?
Gettin' onto who you might be with
Drown myself in 90 proof, what else?
I plead the fifth

Well if you showed up at my door tonight
Would I let you in without a fight?
And if a little kiss led to the bed
Would we wake up with no regrets?
Uh huh uh huh
Any minute but I won't lie
Uh huh uh huh
Probly love you 'til the day I die

Uh huh uh huh

I plead the fifth
Just one more shot
I guess the heart wants what it wants
I plead the fifth
Won't say a word
Won't tell you just how much it hurts
I plead the fifth
Just one more shot
I guess the heart wants what it wants

I plead the fifth (Woo hoo)
I plead the fifth (Woo hoo, woo hoo)
Woo, woo, hoo
