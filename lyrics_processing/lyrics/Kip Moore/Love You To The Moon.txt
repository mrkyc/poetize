One, two, three

Johnny is a spaceman, sittin' on a rocket
Got a picture of Julie, ay, in his spacesuit pocket
Julie's at the window, standin' there in the kitchen
Got a NASA radio, pacin' the floor as she listens
Mission control says the engine is a-go
And the boosters glow as they point for the sky
Johnny comes over the radio
Says to Julie "Babe, it's time for me to fly," ay
"But you know this ain't no goodbye"

Yeah I love you to the moon
Took you with me right out of this world
Yeah I love you to the moon
You're always gonna be my girl
It don't matter where I'm at
We're stuck together like a zodiac
Babe I'm comin' home soon
I love you to the moon and back

When Johnny makes landfall on the lunar frontier
He's on the news and all, picture comin' in clear
Johnny blows a kiss right there on the TV
Julie says to herself, "Oh that kiss is for me"

Johnny comes on, puts his gravity boots by the door
Julie got champagne, ain't popped the cork
He says "Babe I missed ya, just couldn't wait to land"
He slips a moon rock out of his pocket and puts it in Julie's hand

That says "I love you to the moon"
I took you with me right out of this world
Yeah I love you to the moon
You're always gonna be my girl
It don't matter where I'm at
We're stuck together like a zodiac
Babe I'm comin' home soon
I love you to the moon
Babe I love you to the moon
Take you with me right out of this world
Yeah I love you to the moon
You're always gonna be my girl
It don't matter where I'm at
We're stuck together like a zodiac
Babe I'm comin' home soon
'Cause I love you to the moon and back
Hey, to the moon and back
To the moon and back
To the moon and back
Yea, to the moon and back
