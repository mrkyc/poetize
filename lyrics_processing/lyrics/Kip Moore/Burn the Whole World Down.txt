I'm goin' back through that open door
And I won't be back no more
If I'm gone, if I'm gone too long
Don't write me no sad song
I'll send you love through the cold black dark
From the bottom of my heart

You say it's hard to say I love you
But it's hard to say I don't
And that ain't enough to keep me hangin' 'round
If your daddy tries to stop me
I'm gonna make damn sure he don't
I'm gonna get out of this town
And burn the whole world down
Yeah, yeah ahhh
Yeah, yeah ahhh

Don't shed a tear, don't shed a tear for me
I'll be in good company
Just my guitar and a lonesome road
Where I ain't scared to go and if in the night
You miss my kiss, girl
Just remember this

Where I'll make my mark
It's so far to the dark

You say it's hard to say I love you
But it's hard to say I don't
