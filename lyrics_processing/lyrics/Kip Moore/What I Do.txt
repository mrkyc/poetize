I like to smoke cheap cigarettes
God knows I'll take what I can get
Mary jane's a friend of mine, from time to time
I'm a stubborn mule from what I hear
When it comes to what kinda beer I wanna drink
So don't think you'll change my mind

I'm a midnight lover on the loose
I'm a wild card baby through and through
Give me a guitar and I'll pick some songs for you
'Cause that's what I want and that's who I am
That's what I do

I've been known to offend, feel kinda bad but do it again
Ain't the first, sure ain't the last time I do
I'm on my way to perfect politically incorrect
I apologize ahead of time if it pertains to you

I'm a midnight lover on the loose
Cause I'm a wild card baby through and through
Give me a guitar and I'll pick some songs for you
'Cause that's what I want and that's who I am
That's what I do
'Cause that's what I want and that's who I am
And that's what I do

How am I to swear
When I ain't supposed to swear
But man that's how it goes
Settle down and loosen up
And we'll get along

I'm a midnight lover on the loose
I'm a wild card baby, through and through
Give me a guitar and I'll pick some songs for you
'Cause that's what I want and that's who I am
That's what I do
'Cause that's what I want and that's who I am
