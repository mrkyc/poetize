One, two, three

Most times, you wind up back at your place
With a few of them cold beers, your words feel safe
And you'll go through all the maybes
We should take it slows and you
Wake up with a hammer pounding on your heart
Scared you might carve yourself another scar
And when that sun creeps in, she's halfway out the door

But sometimes she stays
And asks you what you're doing that day
And where you keep the coffee and an old sweatshirt
And all your walls start falling for her
And one night turns into every day
Turns into one more toothbrush at your place
Yeah, there'll come a time that you'll turn around
And never see it any other way
'Cause sometimes she stays

First time she heads back to her side of town
You'll wanna call her when her car pulls out
You'll think twice about chasin' her down for one more kiss
It'll be like God just painted your world
A whole new shade of whatever that girl's got goin' on
And it sure ain't right when she's gone

And one night turns into every day
Turns into one more toothbrush at your place
There'll come a time that you'll turn around
And never see it any other way
'Cause sometimes she stays

'Cause sometimes she goes
And that's when you know
You want her to stay, yeah

Sometimes she stays
Wrapped in that bedsheet negligee
Looking like Heaven fell down to earth
And life'll never be the same 'cause of her
And one night turns into every day
Turns into one more toothbrush at your place
There'll come a time that you'll turn around
And never want it any other way
