Girl I know I drive you mad
And I know I make you cry
And I wish I knew the reason
But I don't know why
And you know all the things to do
To get under my skin when you want to girl
Here we are, yeah we made it this far
With both hands on the wheel
Of a getaway car

With the window down
Baby wave goodbye
To your mama standin' there in the drive
From the day we married
We were goin' too fast
We were born to run
We were built to last

All I know sometimes you love it
Sometimes you hate it
But what good's love if it ain't
A little complicated
No it don't always go just like you
Hoped it would
But sometimes complicated's pretty damn good

Girl you made your choice and you had your pick
Of a little bit smoother ride than this
Coulda played it safe
Coulda got out clean
But ya rolled the dice and you're stuck with me

With the window down
Baby wave goodbye
To your mama standin' there in the drive
From the day we married
We were goin' too fast
We were born to run
We were built to last

All I know sometimes you love it
Sometimes you hate it
But what good's love if it ain't
A little complicated
No it don't always go just like you
Hoped it would
But sometimes complicated's pretty damn good

Not much in the bank account
Just enough to get us by
So I'm scared as hell
The way you're smilin' at me
With those two pink lines
And oh I know sometimes you love it and you hate it
But what good's love if it ain't a little complicated
Now all I know sometimes you love it
Sometimes you hate it
But what good's love if it ain't a little complicated
No it don't always go just like you hoped it would
But sometimes complicated's pretty damn good

Pretty damn good
Damn
