Come on out, Mary Jane
I'm lookin' through your windowpane
I heard the word you're back in town
I got some cheap cigarettes
Your favorite beer, girl, wear the dress
I always dream about, oh

We'll chase the moon, ride the stars
Find the muscle in this car
I know it's still got somethin' left
Yeah, come on out, take my hand
Feel my heart, girl, understand
I've got a thunder poundin' in my chest

Hey, I
Can't see you as nothin' but mine
And girl, tonight
Let's go crazy one more time

We'll park the car, climb the hood
Turn it up when somethin' good
Starts playin' through these rusted doors
And in the sticky sweet air tonight
I'll kiss you, girl, 'til I get it right
'Cause I know that'll lead to more

The weeds have all grown around
Where I'll gently lay you down
And I'll try to tell you how I feel
But you'll place your finger on my mouth
Whisper, "Baby, no not now"
The night is young and we still got time to steal

Hey, I
Can't see you as nothin' but mine
And girl, tonight
Let's go crazy one more time
Hey

With the engine burnin' through my jeans
I watch you fall fast asleep
And this small-town sky fades from black to blue
And I'll wipe a tear from my eye
But you'll never know 'cause, baby, I'll smile
As I wave goodbye to you

Hey, I
Can't see you as nothin' but mine
And girl, tonight
Let's go crazy one more time
I guess I'll always have this longin' in my heart
And you'll have a piece of me
But tonight, there's a fire to start in our red, burnin' hearts
