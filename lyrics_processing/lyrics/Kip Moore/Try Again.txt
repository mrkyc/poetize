Well hey, hey, hey there pretty thing
I got a brand new song I'm dying to sing
I hope it goes a hold of your soul like an old church hymn
But if it don't I'll try again

Baby I'll try, try, try, no I won't quit
I'll fight, fight, fight you can count on it
To the moon and back, through the highs and lows
To win your love, girl just know
I'll try try try, then I'll try again

Most girls don't stand a chance
To make me move my two left feet to dance
That's what you want, girl I'm all in
Lord knows I'll get it wrong, but I'll try again

Baby I'll try, try, try, no I won't quit
I'll fight, fight, fight you can count on it
To the moon and back, through the highs and lows
To win your love, girl just know
I'll try try try, then I'll try again

If you and I don't get it right
I'll come and find you in the next life
