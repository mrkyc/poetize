Me and Teddy used to burn that old Chevy
All the way up to Mary Lee's
One of the guy's kinda ride or die
And we were thick as thieves
The whole damn town said when we come around
We're as mean as a four letter word
Up to no good, no we didn't have much
Just a whole lotta time to burn

So if we got high, we got stoned
If there was a fight, we got it on
If there was a backseat, we made love
That was then and that was us

We crossed the county line for a kegger one night
There were some girls we had never seen
Teddy had his eye locked on a dime
Mary said she was lookin' at me
Standin' there sippin' on smoke
And a cheap ass bottle of wine
She said "My name's Kate, you're my kinda crazy
And it takes one to know one"

Mary Lee started hangin', started talkin'
With a boy with a checkered past
It wasn't long before he showed his true colors
And he left her all blue and black
Cops stopped us runnin' ninety
With a loaded pistol and a bottle of booze
And it's a good damn thing the blue lights
Got us 'fore we did what we was gonna do

So if we got high, we got stoned
If there was a fight, we got it on
If there was a backseat, we made love
That was then and that was us
If we got high, yeah, you know we're gonna roll it up
If we got high, yeah, you know we got stoned
If there was a fight then you know we're gonna back 'em up
If there was a fight, we got it on
In the back of the seat, you know we got tangled up
In the back of the seat, you know we made love
