Well, I guess I'm doin' alright
I've had a few hard nights
Empty bottles to show
And I, I hear you're doin' okay
I guess you turned the page
Oh, but baby, you should know

When teardrops fall from your pale blue eyes
As sad as the sky on the Fifth of July
When you're lyin' with him and he's fast asleep
You're, you're gonna wish it was me
Still got a long way to go 'til spring
But I know winter's gone 'cause I don't feel a thing
When you tangle with him in the midnight sheets
You're, you're gonna wish it was me

Well love is such a funny thing
You're pickin' out a ring
Next thing you know
The grass is always green
On the other side
Until you throw a blanket on it

No, I won't be hard to find
I'll be right there on your mind
Under lock and key
Girl, there's gonna come a day
When you have to look away
When he's whispering your name
You're gonna wish it was me
