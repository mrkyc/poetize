Well, baby love's just one of them words that gets thrown around
Like a Jack and Coke, sitting on the bar, it gets watered down
So I ain't gonna say it, no I ain't gonna lie
If you want to known the truth, how I feel about you tonight

If you were my last breath, I'd just wanna hold ya
If you were my last night of hell on wheels, I woulda drive you like I stole ya
If you were my last shot, last shot of whiskey
I'd press you to my lips, take a little sip
Swirl you around and around and around
Then I'd shoot ya down

So baby let me look at you and see just what I got
If you were my cherry stem I'd tie you in a knot
And if I could inhale you, oh baby I'd be gone
I'd be floating round high as the Colorado sky blowing smoke rings all night long

If you were my last breath, I'd just wanna hold ya
If you were my last night I ever had on wheels, I woulda drive you like I stole ya
If you were my last shot of whiskey
I'd press you to my lips, take a little sip
Swirl you around and around and around
Then I'd shoot ya down

Last night of hell on wheels, I woulda drive you like I stole ya
If you were my last shot of whiskey
I'd press you to my lips, take a little sip

Then I'd shoot ya down
Then I'd shoot ya down
