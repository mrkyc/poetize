Dis type ah shit happen everyday
All dem a gwaan dem heart softer than clay
None ah dem have the guts to rise it and spray
None ah dem have the guts to bust the SK

I got diamonds on my blocka
Serve it to my flocka
Yeah, that's my flocka
To my flocka
Pray to Lord on my shotta
She be proper
Yeah, that's my flock

Hola! Grew up on the block wampin' coca
Never used my product, homie all I blow is mota
I know the streets up and down, so I keep my toaster
I'm turnt up to the max, only thing left is to roast ya
Growing up, Robbie Kyle was my mom and father
Pops, I'm 23 now, weak ass nigga, don't bother
Ya played me like a fish, man, you threw me in the water
I transformed to a shark, and all I know is to slaughter
I got a team full of mobsters, call me Coach Carter
One call will have ya block hotter than some lava
I'm a real light-skinned mobster, no imposter
Homeboy, I'm proper as a whopper, check the roster, its Rello
You might also like

King Addition is the blocka, you could get chopped up
I be with the mobsters, chilling with some rastas
Smoking Bob Marley, no you can't stop us
Turnt up, don't act up, you might need some coppas
Throw some Old Bay on y'all, leave you red lobstered
The game need surgery, guess who is the doctors
Me, Pat J, Rello, Jae'ar, free D Knight
VSFM, we be way too hype
You better think twice, we tight like two dykes
Wordplay leave your mind fucked up, its alright
Bumbaclot to you suckas, and your life
Check my dental record trick, all cocaine white


We got work on my blocka, trying to dodge the coppas
Esse with that cobra, leave ya ass slumped over
Drink til I'm hungover, but me no push-over
Trying to push that Rover, at the top, move over
As your dreams move closer, enemies approach ya
Keep em at a distance, act like I don't know ya
No I'm not against ya, see, I'm just not for ya
Enemies approaching, you get that cold shoulder
All my niggas soldiers, all ya niggas (?)
Come around my blocka, I might have to fold ya
On my blocka working, moving like a chauffeur
Yea that work for certain, pockets big as Oprah


I was a young nigga on my blocka, coming straight from the projects
Lone Oak, and Price Drive, and Kennedy Circle I got ya
Hell yea, we was acting up, doing shit we wasn't pose to
Throwing rocks at all the cars, when the cops would come, we was ghost dude
Shout out to my Ol'heads, who was out there drinking on 40s
Hurricanes and 211s, can't forget about OE
Everybody, they know me, I do the shit for my people
Ain't new to the struggling, hard times, I've seen those
What the fuck do you know about using stoves as heaters
Don't leave no food out, because the roaches'll it eat
All day hit By-Lo, got food stamps to get a jungle juice
Lot of people don't understand half the shit we was going through
