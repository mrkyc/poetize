But I feel this urge to grin
If I try to charm you
Well, that's just the mood that I'm in
If I wanna act real cool
That's just the way that I feel
You don't have to buy my stuff if you don't like my deal
I'm the one mama warned you about
I'm the guy mama told you about
Take another look and then look out
Mama warned you
I'm the one mama warned you about
I'm the guy mama told you about
Take another look and then look out
Mama warned you
I just wanna bare the facts to help you understand
Sometimes when two bodies touch
Things just get out of hand
And if I say some things to you that sound a bit bizarre
Just to let you know up front what my intentions are
I'm the one mama warned you about
I'm the guy mama told you about
Take another look and then look out
Mama warned you
I'm the one mama warned you about
I'm the guy mama told you about
Take another look and then look out
Mama warned you
You might also likeMaybe we should just kick back and keep it kinda light
Maybe we've been hit before maybe mama's right
I just wanna make it clear
The moon is full tonight
If you say that I should stay
You know what say what
I just might well alright
I'm the one mama warned you about
I'm the guy mama told you about
Take another look and then look out
Mama warned you
I'm the one mama warned you about
I'm the guy mama told you about
Take another look and then look out
I'm the one mama warned you about
I'm the guy mama told you about
Take another look and then look out
