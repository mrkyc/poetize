Everybody shout
(Oh, everybody, everybody)
Halleluia
My child is coming home
My child is coming home
Just an ordinary day in Heaven
Lookin' down the Streets of Gold
You can hear the strings and the angel wings
See the saints of Old
Then suddenly God breaks a smile
And begins His song
"Look, my Son is coming home!"
Open up the Pearly Gates of Heaven
Build another mansion next to mine
Everybody dance and shout for joy
Around the throne
Set another place at the table
Sound the trumpet loud and clear this time
Halleluia, my child is coming home
Now they say the only time God sings
Is when a lost soul believes
And they say that there's a celebration
There beside the Crystal Sea
And God, Himself, directs the choir
And the welcome band
And then He sings out once again
