So that no one could desert you
Always looking
For the perfect place to hide
You build up walls
So that no one could ever hurt you
And yet the loneliness made you cry
Bridges all burned
Nowhere to turn but to heaven
Miles and miles away
Love saw you there
Stretched out His hand to reach you
Across the lonely ocean of your tears
And He'll walk upon the waves, oh...
If that's what it takes to save you
Love doesn't have the heart to stay
Miles and miles away
He has the grace
To cover any distance
Always looking
For the lost and weary soul
No, no, He never stops
Offering forgiveness
And to the wanderer, a welcome home
So roam no more
Jesus is Lord, down from Heaven

Love saw you there
Stretched out His hand to reach you
Across the lonely ocean of your tears
And He'll walk upon the waves
If that's what it takes to save you
Love doesn't have the heart to stay
Miles and miles away
Neither day or night
Death or life
Could ever separate us
From the love the spans the ages
Miles and miles away
Love saw you there
Stretched out His hand to reach you
Across the lonely ocean of your tears
And He'll walk upon the waves
If that's what it takes to save you
Love doesn't have the heart to stay

Love saw you there
Stretched out His hand to reach you
Even through the lonely ocean of your tears
And He'll walk upon the waves
He'll do anything
If that's what it takes to save you
Love doesn't have the heart to stay
Miles and miles away
Miles and miles away
