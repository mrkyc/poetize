Why you wanna carry that heavy load?
Everybody oughta be singing
Freedom song
You can't even move
From all that's holding you down
Chains you made yourself
Are keeping you bound
And you've convinced yourself
That peace can't be found
So why'd you let the devil inside?
It's grace that gives you freedom in life
Stop, my brother, there's a better road
Why you wanna carry that heavy load?
Everbody oughta be singing
Freedom song
You can change your world today
Why would you want it any other way?

Freedom song
There was a time
When I just couldn't win
When my addictions
Made me a slave to my sin
I tried to break away
But then I'd do it again
Until helpless I fell down on my knees
And the love of the Lord made me free
Made me free
