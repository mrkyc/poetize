Just wishing that I could get out
When the man next to me
Saw the book in my hand
And asked me what it was about
So, I settled back in my seat
"A best seller," I said
"A history, a mystery in one"
And then I opened up the book
And began to read
From Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John
He was born of a virgin one holy night
In the little town of Bethlehem
Angels gathered round Him underneath the stars
Singing praises to the Great I Am
He walked on the water, healed the lame
And made the blind to see again
And for the first time here on earth
We learned that God could be a friend
And though He never ever did a single thing wrong
The angry crowd chose Him
And then He walked down the road
And died on the cross
And that was the end of the beginning

"And I've heard it all before
I've tried religion, its shame and guilt
And I don't need it anymore
It's superstition, made up tales
And just to help the weak to survive"
"Let me read it again," I said
"But listen closely, this is gonna change your life"
He was born of a virgin one holy night
In the little town of Bethlehem
Angels gathered round him underneath the stars
Singing praises to the Great I Am
He walked on the water, healed the lame
And made the blind to see again
And for the first time here on earth
We learned that God could be a friend
And though he never ever did a single thing wrong
The angry crowd chose him
And then he walked down the road
And died on the cross
And that was the end of the beginning
"The end of the beginning," he said with a smile
"What more could there be? He's dead
You said they hung Him, put nails in His hands
And a crown of thorns on His head"
I said, "I'll read it again but this time there's more
And I believe that this is true
His death wasn't the end, the beginning of life
That's completed in you
Don't you see, He did all this for you"
He was born of a virgin one holy night
In the little town of Bethlehem
All the angels singing praises to the Great I Am
He walked on the water, healed the lame
And made the blind to see
(And for the first time here on earth)
Did you know that God could be a friend
And though He never did a single thing wrong
He was the one the crowd chose
Then he walked and he died
But hree days later, three days later
Three days later, He rose!
Three days later, He rose!
You see He came, He lived, and He died
