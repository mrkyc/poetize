There you are, you've come so far
Sunny days, the air tastes so sweet
Flowers greet
Birds will sing "you mean everything"
You can be anything

More power, more pace
More money, more taste
More sex, more pills
More skin, more shills
Build tall, build higher
Build far, build wider
Build here, build down
Build up, build now

But look at the way you go
You're one in a million, and you know it shows
And we love you

Unto the mud!

More wants, more needs
More hits, morphine
More speed, more drive
More self, more time
Build out, build fast
Build strong, build vast
Build too, build more
Build all, build war

Look at the way you go
You're one in a million, and you know it shows
And we love you

Do unto the mud!
Mud!

Race to scale the body stack
And lay foot to face atop broken back
A failure here is a failure earned
So do unto the top!
Do unto the end!
Do unto the mud, do!


More power, more pace
More money, more taste
More sex, more pills
More skin, more shills

Build tall, build higher

Build here, build down
Build up, build now
Build out, build fast
Build strong, build vast
Build, build, build, build
Build, build, build, build
Look at the way you go
You're one in a million, and you know it shows
And we love you
Look at the way that you choose
You know you'll never lose
And all that you are, it was all you deserved anyway
Sunny days

And we love you
We love you
