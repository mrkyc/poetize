Skull!


(They all know)
(They all know)

Sorry, did I wake your dream? Some questions run too deep
We only, only wake up when we sleep
Led by the lunar light, trouble's all we find
Lost our way tonight

Is it somethin' we said?
Is it somethin' we said to them?
Is it somethin' we said?

(Save me)
I'm trapped in a vile world
(Save me)
Where the endgame's all the same as every other
We're only here to die
(Save me)
I'm losin' my only dream
(Save me)
I can use some guiding light, some place to go
If ya hear me, let me know

Ever since the day you left, my fate's been set unknown
How many years to walk this path alone?
So much to see tonight, so why'd you close your eyes?
Why can't I shut mine?

Is it somethin' we did?
Is it somethin' we did to them?
Is it somethin' we did?

(Save me)
I'm trapped in a vile world
(Save me)
Where the endgame's all the same as every other
We're only here to die
(Save me)
I'm losin' my only dream
(Save me)
I can use some guiding light, some place to go
If ya hear me, let me know
If ya hear me, let me know

Help me find my way
Said help me find my way

No pulse inside of me
Stone cold lips and heresy
All lies, and to a degree
Losing who I wanna be
You'll find out right now
He may be out of his mind
But someday, you will find
That sanity's left us all blind
And dragged us all behind
A moment seen through those eyes
Crystal blue disguise
They say that all beauty must die
I say it just moves on
If you'd only open your mind
Then someday, you will find
Insanity left us behind
And walked right through the door
I can see the pictures clear as yesterday
Pictures all my own
I can hear the voices begging you to stay
But know you're not alone
(Save me)
I'm trapped in a vile world
(Save me)
Where the endgame's all the same as every other
We're only here to die
(Save me)
I'm losin' my only dream
(Save me)
I can use some guiding light, some place to go
If ya hear me, let me know
If ya hear me, let me know


Tonight we all die young
Tonight we all die young
Tonight we all die young
Tonight we all die young
Tonight we all die young
Tonight we all die young
Tonight we all die
