And we're at it again
I turn around, another fucking war, man
I don't know where to begin
But I'll start with the radical leaders
Their steps we're following

Running, don't go back and fight, too many you'll lose
(And as clowns you follow suit
Behind the blood between the red and white and blue
But it's too deep for you to see and everyone eventually will take the step
'Cause it's in sight you take the left, I'll take the right
I feel the hate you've built for me and I say pay attention baby)

As they thank the Lord
The blind can't see
Like a plague fed to the brain
Deadly disease, woah

But it wasn't a sin
A sorry life judging every action
And as they're feeding your mind with this shit
You forget how to speak
How to ask all the questions

The business at hand tonight, make the people choose
(I see another side in you but there's not much more I can do
From on the outside looking in your government is listening
To push you on the story of immortal father mortal son
Give them your mind and all your wealth the cycle will rebirth itself)

If they had it their way I'd burn in Hell
And your future's a fucking disaster, can't you see?
Don't give them all the power
When your future's in desperate trouble baby

As they thank the Lord
The blind can't see
Like a plague fed to the brain
Deadly disease, woah
I'd run away tonight with my mind still intact
You gotta make it alright
Easier said than done with no place to hide
And having no place to

Running away from condition
I see you but you're running away from
Your scared seductive system
Most would claim I live a lie (I live a lie)
When pointing out it's easy to predict these things (Predict these things)
Every color has its side (I have a side)
They live together, vote and most embrace the same dark times
Please help us, please save us
Of course they have control, we're all the same
Up on the cross, crucified their problem
Drove the nail and let him rot
Family and friends, it won't matter in the end
I'm sure they'll understand
Now look at the world and see
How the humans bleed
As I sit up here and wonder about
How you sold your mind, body and soul
Looking at the fields so green
I know this sounds obscene
I see you're living for tomorrow
But decisions you have made will leave you empty

As they thank the Lord
The blind can't see
Like a plague fed to the brain
Deadly disease, woah
I'd run away tonight with my mind still intact
You gotta make it alright
Easier said than done with no place to hide
And having no place to (Run)

You have fallen asleep in denial
Look at the way we're dying one by one
How it ends I'll never know
