And lady - I just need to know - if you feel the same about me
'cause no one's ever touched me quite the way you do
You've got me thinkin' 'bout you day and night
And I've just got to know if it's the same for you
Do you wanna spend 4-ever by my side?
Think you're the one for me
And you'll always be the one that I love
I love you baby
Think you're the one for me
And you'll always be the one that I love
Oh girl - when I feel your heart - beating so close to mine
I feel so helpless - I must be falling in love
Cause I want you all of the time
Girl - you know that I will never let you down
You know I'll always be here 4 you
I promise you that I will never play around
I swear I'm always gonna be faithful and true
Think you're the one for me
And you'll always be the one that I love
Said I love you baby
Think you're the one for me
And you'll always be the one that I love
