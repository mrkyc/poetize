And I would just tell them that they were dead wrong
They said your true colors would start to show
So man just cut your loses, let her go
I said this conversation's over
How they gonna tell me I don't know ya
I'm your soldier
Girl, no one or nothing can change the way I feel
I don't regret never ever telling you lies
Regret not havin' a chick on the side
Regret that I ever fell for you
'Cause that's what people in love do
I don't regret not hanging out with my crew
Regret spending all my time with you
And I don't care what all of my friends say
You're the best thing that's happened to me
Got no regrets, regrets
Since I've met you everyone says I've changed
They say hangin' with me is just not the same
It don't bother me, let them think that I'm done
It's only 'cause I know that you're the one
You might also likeIt's just 'cause they don't know you
And baby girl, they don't get to hold you
Not like I do
Girl, no one or nothing can change the way I feel
I don't regret never ever telling you lies
Regret not havin' a chick on the side
Regret that I ever fell for you
'Cause that's what people in love do
I don't regret not hanging out with my crew
Regret spending all my time with you
And I don't care what all of my friends say
You're the best thing that's happened to me
See I don't miss the single life
A party for me is you by my side
Please believe that no one's more special to me
Girl, you're my everything
Got no regrets, no, no, woah
I don't regret never ever telling you lies
Regret not havin' a chick on the side
Regret that I ever fell for you
'Cause that's what people in love do
I don't regret not hanging out with my crew
Regret spending all my time with you
And I don't care what all of my friends say
You're the best thing that's happened to me
Regret never ever telling you lies
Regret not havin' a chick on the side
Regret that I ever fell for you
'Cause that's what people in love do
I don't regret not hanging out with my crew
Regret spending all my time with you
And I don't care what all of my friends say
You're the best thing that's happened to me
Got no regrets, regrets, got no regrets
Got no regrets, regrets, every time that I look at you, baby
Got no regrets, regrets, baby girl, I got no regrets
