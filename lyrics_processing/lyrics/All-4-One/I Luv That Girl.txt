I love her hair, her teeth, her nails, her feet
I love her laugh, her cry, her lips, her eyes
She's my future, my world and I love that girl
I've been feeling like this girl just might be the one
She got my heart on lock like the warden of a prison, alright, yeah
And every time we touch I just get all warm inside, oh yeah
I'm so glad she's mine, listen and I'll tell you why, yes, I will
I love the way she moves, she grooves, her shoes, she's smooth
I love her hair, her teeth, her nails, her feet
I love her laugh, her cry, her lips, her eyes
She's my future, my world and I love that girl
She's my only drug, a kiss from her and I'm all strung out, oh yes, I am
No need for getting help 'cause I know I'm way past that now, oh
I tell her every day, you won't ever get rid of me, oh yes, no, you won't
She's got me so open, I ask her for permission to breathe
I love the way she moves, she grooves, her shoes, she's smooth
I love her hair, her teeth, her nails, her feet
I love her laugh, her cry, her lips, her eyes
She's my future, my world and I love that girl
I'm gonna be with her until the day we're both old and gray
And even after that she's still gonna be with me, yeah
And if I never see nobody else that's alright with me
'Cause she's the only one that I need, hey
