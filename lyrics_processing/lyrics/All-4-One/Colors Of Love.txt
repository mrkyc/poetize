In the skies - in your eyes
Every time we're together and you put your little hand in mine
Blue is a feeling - that I'm never gonna have again
Can't be blue - I've got you
And lady in you I've found a lover and a friend
Whenever I'm with you - color me happy
Whenever we touch - color me hot
You color my world in
Colors of love - shades of emotion
At the end of the rainbow
We found everlasting love and devotion
Red are the roses - that you're holding in your hand
When you need - tender lovin'
Pretty lady you know I'm your man
Red is the color - of the passion that I feel for you
When it's hot - burnin' up
Sexy lady you know I'm so in love with you
Whenever I'm with you - color me happy
Whenever we touch - color me hot
You color my world in
