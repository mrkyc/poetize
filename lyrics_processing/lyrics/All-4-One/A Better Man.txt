So many times I looked and found
My dreams around, come tumbling down
And there you were
Holding out your hand (Holding out your hand)
When there was rain
You were the sun
You are my life when life was done
So this I say to you
Baby from my heart
From my heart (From my heart) (from my heart)

Every day you'll see (Every day you'll see)
How I try and be (How I try and be)
A better man for you (A better man for you)
By the things I'll do (By the things I'll do)
A better man you see
Has come to you today
(I'll try and be a better man)

And when others come my way
I'll just smile and politely say
That this heart of mine
It only beats for you (Only beats for you)
Though in the past I've let you down
There's no more tears I'll be around
Now and forever, my wandering days are through
I want you (I want you, I want you, I want you)
Every day you'll see (Every day you'll see)
How I try and be (How I try and be)
A better man for you (A better man for you)
By the things I'll do (By the things I'll do)
A better man you see
Has come to you today
(I'll try and be a better man)

So let me hold you close to me
Let me prove this love is real (It's so real)
I'll make up for all the times you've cried
Let me take you in my arms
I'll erase all the hurt I see
Come and feel the love I have
Inside, inside, inside, inside

And every day you'll see (Every day)
How I try and be (How I try and be)
A better man for you (A better man for you)
By the things I'll do (By the things I'll do)
A better man you see
Has come to you today
I'll try and be a better
Try and be a better
Try and be a better
