Out of touch and disconnected
I had it all, oh and watched it slip away
With the damage done, it's self-inflicted
It's no surprise to find it all end up the same
But then you shattered everything
And all that's left is the truth and you and me
And that's all I'll ever need to make sure that I don't do the same old stupid things

I never said nothing when I should've said
But this time's gonna be different
I won't let you down, no
See I'm the author of broken hearts
I'm tired of causing pain, I didn't need to start
And I won't let you down

Call it pride or indecision
It took so long, oh, for me to say
That I never loved with conviction
Cause all I thought about was looking out for me
But then you, you risked everything
You came along and you saved me from myself
And you won't ever see the shadow of the fool I used to be
You might also like
I never said nothing when I should've said
But this time's gonna be different
I won't let you down, no
See I'm the author of broken hearts
I'm tired of causing pain, I didn't need to start
And I won't let you down, no
I won't let you down

Listen baby
I know I made enough mistakes and there's only me to blame
But honesty could never lie
Then you can see the truth in my eyes
I know I can't run from myself without hurting someone else
So I'm standing my ground, won't be letting you down
Cause I'd never do that to me, no

Said I never said nothing when I should've said
But this time's gonna be different
I won't let you down, no
See I'm the author of broken hearts
I'm tired of causing pain, I didn't need to start
And I won't let you down, no
I won't let you down
