Cold wind's blowing, confusions growing
Signs showing, nobody's home
Peer through your window, nothing but an empty soul
Where'd you move? Where'd you go?
Am I too late to stop this?
I'm in disbelief, I keep knocking
But the carving in that old oak tree, said forever you and me
The one thing I believed in has failed me
When everyone was looking from the outside in
I got to know you behind closed curtains
And be the one to make sure that you're safe and warm
How could you leave me all alone in the cold at the door
Without a key to your heart?
How could you leave me? No goodbye, boy, I'm gone, movin' on
And now my love won't survive
Where can I mail off and send this pent up emotion?
'Cause you don't live here anymore
How could you leave me all alone in the cold at the door
Without a key to your?
You might also likeHeart's pounding, yelling loudly
Throwing rocks at your windows
Trying to kick it, put my shoulder into it
And once more tried the handle
And the telephone's disconnected
No more electricity I'm assuming
With our prints in the cement remember when we were six
Wish we could be there again
When everyone was looking from the outside in
I got to know you behind closed curtains
And be the one that made sure that you're safe and warm
How could you leave me all alone in the cold at the door
Without a key to your heart?
How could you leave me? No goodbye, boy, I'm gone, movin' on
And now my love won't survive
Where can I mail off and send this pent up emotion?
'Cause you don't live here anymore
How could you leave me all alone in the cold at the door
Without a key to your heart?
You said you'd never leave, this home feels so empty
Tell me where did you go, go?
Never saw a moving sign, just locked out wondering why
Your heart don't live here no more
How could you leave me all alone in the cold at the door
Without a key to your heart?
How could you leave me? No goodbye, boy, I'm gone, movin' on
And now my love won't survive
Where can I mail off and send this pent up emotion?
'Cause you don't live here anymore
How could you leave me all alone in the cold at the door
