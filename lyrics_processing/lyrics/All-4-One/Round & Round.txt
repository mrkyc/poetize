Round and Round, where we stop, nobody knows
That's right, round and round we go
And the line goes like this
Girl I met you about a year ago
You said you wanted to take it slow
So I been waitin' here patiently
But you still say you won't get with me
I call you up and you don't answer your phone
I come on out but you're never at home
How much longer will this trust me last
'Cause I'm sure up foot last
Friends ask me why, I still try
But they never looked into your eyes
I know I'm Get-ing-close-er
I'm tired of goin' Round and Round
Chasin' you all over town
Girl you really need to slow it down
No use trying to get away
I won't give up so easily
Girl I tell you go up and down, Round and Round
Won't you let me take you out tonight
Don't say no, just say you might
You and I can go paint the town
Say the word, I won't let you down
'Cause what you're getting isn't everything you see
The other guys want to get up in me
Then you can fall in love with me, at last, at last
You might also likeFriends ask me why, I still try
But they never looked into your eyes
I know I'm Get-ing-close-er
I'm tired of goin' Round and Round
Chasin' you all over town
Girl you really need to slow it down
No use trying to get away
I won't give up so easily
Girl I tell you go up and down, Round and Round
I'm tired of goin' Round and Round
Chasin' you all over town
Girl you really need to slow it down (Slow it down, I can't keep up baby)
No use trying to get away
I won't give up so easily

I'm tired of going Round and Round

Girl, you should learn to slow it down
(Slow it down, slow it down) down
