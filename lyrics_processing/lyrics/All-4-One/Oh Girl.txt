When I don't listen to you
And maybe know it seems that I am untrue
But give me one more chance
And I'll prove my love to you
And oh girl i'll do anything
To be back with you
I'll show affection and anything you choose
And I'll do all this to prove that I love you
I do love you
And girl you know I'll love you and I care
And if you ever need me I will always be there
I'm missin' all the love (All the love)
That you and I shared
And oh girl (Oh girl)
You and I should never be apart
So can we try it again
And make a brand new start
You know I love with all my heart
Cause baby I love you
I do love you
Now I lay me down to sleep
Your not by my side
My pillow soakin' wet
From all the tears that I cried
You might also likeWhen I look in your eyes
I don't see me any more
So can we try it one more time
Before you walk out that door
And oh, oh girl (Oh girl)
I'm sorry I didn't understand
That all you wanted
Was a sensitive man
So i'll do all that I can
To show you I love you
Baby I do love you
You know girl
I love you so much
I just can't understand how come
Why, things can work out for us
If I could only tell you right how I feel
I know everything between you and me
Would be all right
Know I love you baby
You know girl
I love you so much
I just can't understand how come
Things can work out for us
It's gonna be alright now baby
I love you so much
I just can't understand how come
Things can work out for us
You know girl
I love you so much
I just can't understand how come
Things can work out for us
I need you with me, I want you with me
I just can't understand how come
