Yeah I know that my hair ain't straight
And maybe I need to lose some weight
I may not have all the latest clothes
I got my song in my mind 

I don't care if you don't like me
I'm not here to live out 
Run your mouth 
Say what you want to, say what you want to
I wanna live each day like it's Friday
All about this life, yeah it's my way
Run your mouth 
Way what you want to, way what you want to
You can say what you want to

I know I can't play basketball
And sometimes I wish that I was tall
And people always got something to say
Well that's alright, I'm gonna live for me

I don't care if you don't like me
I'm not here to live out 
Run your mouth 
Say what you want to, say what you want to
I wanna live each day like it's Friday
All about this life, yeah it's my way
Run your mouth 
Say what you want to, say what you want to
You might also like
You can judge me by my cover cos it won't bother me
You can tell everybody that I'm too hard to see
You can say what you say but it ain't stopping me
Cos at the end of the day everyone will believe
(x2)
I don't care if you don't like me
I'm not here to live out 
Run your mouth 
Say what you want to, say what you want to
I wanna live each day like it's Friday
All about this life, yeah it's my way
Run your mouth 
Say what you want to, say what you want to

I'll say what I want to, love who I want to
(Say what you want to, say what you want to)
Do what I want to
(Say what you want to, say what you want to)
I'm gon' live my life, I'll always do me
You can say, I don't care, I don't care
