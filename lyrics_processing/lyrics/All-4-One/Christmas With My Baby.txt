And it's drivin' me crazy
'cause I'm missin my baby
I call her on the phone every day
Just to say
Even though we're apart
Baby you're always in my heart
I can't wait to see my baby
Smilin' right at me
I just wanna kiss her
Ooo, I really miss her
And everything will be fine with me
Once I get to see
My baby baby at christmas time
I just can't wait to spend
Christmas with my baby
Just seeing you again
Holding you so gently
We're playing in the snow
Just havin' a great day
I wanna be with you for christmas
Now that christmas time is here
Filled with cheer
My heart is beating so fast
I don't know if I can last
Excitement's building up in me
I'm shaking
I've got a present for you
And girl you'll get it soon
You might also likeI can't wait to see
My baby smiling right at me
I just wanna kiss her
Ooo, I really miss her
And everything will be fine with me
Once I get to see

And I just can't wait to spend
Christmas with my baby
Just seein' you again
Holding you so gently
Sittin' by the fireplace
Just havin' a great day

Holding you so gently
