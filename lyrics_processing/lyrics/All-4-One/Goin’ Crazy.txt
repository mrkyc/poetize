Mondays, I'm really startin' to hate on Mondays
Cos baby that's the day that you left me
Oh girl you left me
And now it's tattooed on my brain
Cos every Monday, I keep the  round 12:48
Girl you really did a big number on me
And it ain't all good, cos I took it harder than I should

Now maybe I'm taking this thing a little too far
But I'm way too gone to ride this 
One thing that I know is I'll never be the same again

Baby I'm going crazy ever since you went away
All I'm saying is 
What the hell is wrong with me?
Baby I'm going crazy ever since you went away
All I'm saying is 
I'll never be the same

Oh, girl I
I don't remember how to keep my eyes dry
I'm wide awake and crying watching lifetime
I said lifetime, and I'm praying for a change
Daily, I die a little more at 12:48
And the cause of death is looking like it's heartbreak
And it ain't alright, only you can bring me back to life, yeah
You might also like
Now maybe I'm, going one step a little too far
But there ain't no way to stop this pain
And one thing that I know is I'll never be the same again

Baby I'm going crazy ever since you went away
All I'm saying is 
What the hell is wrong with me?
Baby I'm going crazy ever since you went away
All I'm saying is 
I'll never be the same
[
Now baby I pushed your love just a little too hard
But I promise that if you come back
Girl you have my word, I'll never be the same again, no no no

Baby I'm going crazy ever since you went away
All I'm saying is 
What the hell is wrong with me?
Baby I'm going crazy ever since you went away
All I'm saying is 
I'll never be the same
I need you back, yes I do
Never be the same
Got me going so crazy
