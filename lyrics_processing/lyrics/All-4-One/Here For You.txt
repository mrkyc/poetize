And let the most important thing slip slowly by my eyes
Won't make the same mistake twice
I counted every minute since we've been apart
I want so bad to tell you girl what's in my heart
I want to touch you baby and hold you again
Give me one more chance to show you
Another chance to kiss and hold you
And let you know - how much I care
And if you need someone to love you
Girl, you know who you can run too
And you know I'll always be there
Baby I'm here 4 you if you change your mind
And I promise you it will be better this time
Baby I'm here 4 you won't you let me try
And I swear that I, I'll be here for you
When I wake up in the morning
Want you here with me
Want to wrap my arms around wanna feel
You breathe with me
Just we like we used to be
You never miss your water
'til your well runs dry
And I'm so thirsty
I don't think that I
Can make it...
Give me one more chance
You might also likeGive me one more chance to show you
Another chance to kiss and hold you
And let you know how much I care
And if you need someone to love you
Girl, you know where you can run to
So you know I'll always be there
Baby I'm here 4 you if you change your mind
And I promise you it will be better this time
Baby I'm here 4 you won't you let me try
And I swear that I, I'll be here for you
If you change your mind
And I promise you it will be better this time
Baby I'm here 4 you won't you let me try
And I swear that I, I'll be here for you
Too many times I treated you unkind
Now I have to wonder what
The hell was going through my mind
I had a good thing, I let it go
I guess I was afraid to let my true feelings show
Now things have changed because I'm not the same
I've been a different man ever since you went away
And baby if you come back I swear I'll always be true
And I just want you to know I'm here for you
Give me one more chance to show you
Another chance to kiss and hold you
Show you how much I care
And if you need someone to love you
Girl, you know where you can run to
So you know I'll always be there
Give me one more chance to show you
Another chance to kiss and hold you
I want a sweet love like you
And if you need someone to love you
Girl, you know where you can run to
