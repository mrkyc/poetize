A love like ours could never be replaced
And all this time I've only been with you
'cause you have made all my dreams come true
You are the only love I know
And I'll never let you go
You are the sunshine in my life
And one day you'll be my wife
And all my friends wish they could be in love
With someone just like me
A love that's sent from up above
'cause everybody needs somebody to love
'cause everybody needs somebody to love
'cause everybody wants somebody to hug
'cause everybody needs somebody to kiss
Someone just like you who's heaven sent
Every guy should have a girl like you
Someone so sweet that there's nothing
She won't do to make you smile
And brighten up your day
Like call you up just to see if your ok
And every day when I see you turn
All my gray sky blue
You make me smile you make me sing
You make me do those crazy things
And baby you're the air that I breathe
And I'd die girl if you leave
'cause babygirl it'd be so cool if everybody
Had someone like you
