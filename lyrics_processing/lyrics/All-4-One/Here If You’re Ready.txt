I couldn't help but see you across the room
I wanted to go and talk to you
But you had something else to do
That's why I waited a little longer
Before I tried to make my move
'cause girl I have nothing to prove
I just want to be with you ya baby
That's why I'm
Here if you're ready
I'm not gonna waste my time
A love like this is hard to find
I can't get you off of my mind
I gave ya my number and time we could meet
And girl I'm not afraid to let my feelings show
I just wanna get you all alone
And maybe I could take you home
And we could chill for a minute
And get to know eachother a little bit more
Turn off the lights and close the door
No one could ever love you more
Your curves were jumpin' out-I had to close my mouth
That's why I'm here
And I'm not gonna waste my time (here if your ready)
A love like this is hard to find (here if your ready)
And I can't get you off my mind
Now you gotta let me know
Baby if you want me
Don't be afraid to tell me
If you want to get together
Then let your feelings show
Girl you wanna sex me
Girl, you know sometimes you confuse me
I don't know if you wanna be
Together or just friends
But you gotta let me know something
'cause I'm not gonna keep
Waiting around for ya
You might also likeAnd girl, if you want me
You gotta let me know
Or you gotta let your feelings show
Baby I'm here (i'm here if your ready)
I'm not gonna waste my time
Love like this is hard to find (i'm here if your ready)
I can't get you off of my mind
Here if your ready
Baby, I'm here if you ready
I'm not gonna waste my time
A love like this is hard to find (i'm here if your ready)
I can't get you off my mind
Here if your ready
