In your heart is much too strong, it's been there too long-
It's time to let go and to find you someone new
Someone who really cares and will always be there for you
One who will hold you tight morning noon and night
Gently kiss your lips under candle light, give you all you need
Love you endlessly for life
If you're looking for love and romance, someone who cares
And understands, I'm your man, I'm your man, I'm your man
Baby I'm your man and girl I'll treat you right, hold you tight
And make sweet love all through the night
I'm your man, I'm your man, I'm your man, I'm your man
Now he promised you he would never let you down, but when
You needed love, there never was- just could not be found-
He played with your heart, just like it was a game, but girl
Never, never again just let me in, girl things will never be
The same, girl I'll hold you tight, morning noon and night-
Gently kiss your lips under candle light, give you all you need
Love you endlessly for life
If you're looking for love and romance, someone who cares
And understands, I'm your man, I'm your man, I'm your man
Baby I'm your man and girl I'll treat you right, hold you tight
And make sweet love all through the night
I'm your man, I'm your man, baby I'm your, your man
You might also likeGirl I'll never let you down, and when you need love
I'll always be around, to satisfy your every desire
Over and over again
If you're looking for love and romance, someone who cares
And understands, I'm your man, I'm your man, I'm your man
Baby I'm your man and girl I'll treat you right, hold you tight
And make sweet love all through the night
I'm your man, I'm your man, I'm your man, I'm your man
If you're looking for love and romance, someone who cares
And understands, I'm your man, I'm your man, I'm your man
Baby I'm your man and girl I'll treat you right, hold you tight
And make sweet love all through the night
