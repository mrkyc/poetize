I didn't know where you fit in (Where you fit in)
And if I could do it all over again (Again)
I'll never treat you that way
(I'll never treat you that way again)
I apologize for the pain that I caused
And I just wanna say (I just wanna say)

I'm sorry (I'm sorry)
So sorry (So sorry)
For treating you the way I did (I didn't mean it baby)
I'm sorry (I'm sorry)
So sorry (So sorry)
For leaving you the way I did

When I close my eyes
I think of how it used to be (Used to be)
That's when I realized
Just how much you mean to me (You mean to me)
A second chance is all that I need (I need)
To change what's wrong and make it right
(To change what's wrong and make it right)
A fool I was to let you slip away (Away)
When I know I need you in my life (Need you in my life)
