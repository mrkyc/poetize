I'm in paradise, when I look in her eyes
At a time when my heart couldn't see
Thank God, heaven sent an angel to me
I used to pray for heaven to sent me a love
Cause heaven knows a lonely man can't get enough
Each night and day, I search my soul, ask God above
But I'd still be home all alone by my self
In a world where the rain could last forever
My heart was crying for some
After all of the times I said "I'll never"
That's when my angel came along
Heaven sent an angel to me
I'm in paradise when I look in your eyes
At a time when my heart couldn't see
Thank God, heaven sent that angel to me
I used to wonder what it would be like to touch the sky
Someone to love me and wipe away these tears I cry
Held up my hands and hope one day my heart would fly
But I didn't know God was listening to me
In a world where pain could last forever
My heart was crying for love
After all of the times I said "I'll never"
That's when my angel came from above, oh
You might also likeHeaven sent an angel to me
I'm in paradise when I look in your eyes
At a time when my heart couldn't see
Thank God, heaven sent an angel to me
With every moment and every smile she brings
I want to love her, give her my everything
I'm on my knees thanking God up above
Just how good it feels to be loved
Heaven sent an angel to me (Heaven sent)
I'm in paradise when I look in your eyes
At a time when my heart couldn't see
Thank God, heaven sent an angel to me (heaven sent an angel)
I close my eyes at night (Heaven sent an angel to me )
I pray that you might send me somebody, somebody (I'm in paradise when I look in your eyes)
At a time when my heart couldn't see
Thank God, heaven sent an angel to me
Heaven sent an angel to me (Heaven sent, heaven sent)
Heaven sent an angel to me (oh oh, heaven sent)
