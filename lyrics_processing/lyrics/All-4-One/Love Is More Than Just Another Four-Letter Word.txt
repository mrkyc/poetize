I don't want to be alone
Said I need someone to hold on tight
Get ready for this magical ride
Helplessly I'm falling so deep
What am I supposed to do
Love's too big a word, baby to hold inside
I tried and tried, but I just can't find the love
Love is more than just another 4-letter word
Can't fight the feeling, no matter what you do
Love is more than just another 4-letter word
If you're not careful, it's gonna get you too
Today were together - tomorrow we're apart
This how our daily life goes
It really doesn't matter, baby, what's going on
We're still in love - everyone knows
If I need a helping hand I can count on you
Mornin' noon or evenin' time - it's always the same
You'll always be there - I can count on you
Love is more than just another 4-letter word
Can't fight the feeling no matter what you do
Love is more than just another 4-letter word
If you're not careful, it's gonna get you too
