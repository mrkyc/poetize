Fox Boogie Brown is bad as hell
Battle anybody, I don't care if you tell
I excel, they all fail
Suited in Chanel, Fox Brown will rock the bells (C'mon)
Uh, rock bells (Uh), ill
Firm (Firm), c'mon, ride along baby
What up, dada? Yo

Me and my Firmbinos ridin' to the death
The mahogany mami and shine like Pledge
Wouldn't suggest you try me, verses like Gianni
What? I hurt it on purpose like Bonnie
From the bottom to the T-O-P we flow
C.O.D., cash on delivery
Foxy, everybody's watch me now
Got these rap cats mad, can't stop me now
See the slanted eyes rise, wanna knock me down
I got one question for y'all (Ha), "Papi, how?"
We don't player-hate, we regulate in this camp
Y'all do what you can, we do what y'all can't
Amazing like Luther once the beat's looped up
Rock the bi-dells and tore your whole group up
It's ill like Na Na when it feel like drama
Boy, me and the clique roll tight like ganja
See me prima donna, breakin' the nails
Ain't come to gain no fame, we get the cake and we bail
Know you tryna get the picture, but the frame is frail
We gettin' richer, you wish you ran game this well
Rock the bells (Uh)
You might also like
Some players like it and some of them don't
'Cause I make a lot of cash and they girlfriends won't
Fox Boog's bringin' hell, gonna rock the bells
All you other MC's can't do this well, rock the bells

Rock the bells (Uh)

From the true borough, the B-K, too thorough
Down in D.C., touch me, tease me, baby
C'mon, you know the tracks I get dumb on
Can't front on me, playa haters we stunt on
I regulate, done on, down to I'm on
I swung on hits y'all couldn't get run on
Brown, baby, uh, I been chromed out
This ain't nothin' new, pa, been zoned out
And I flows like CK One
Somethin' in they hoes like she fakes none, aight
I'm the quintessential mistress of the instrumental
Y'all could wait to exhale, I'ma vent a little
Set it off like Jada robbin' the bank
I got this money thing covered from the dollar to the franc
The pounds to the pence, it's like hustlin' backwards
Nothin' y'all said made an ounce of sense
My moves be calculated, documented
No matter what you sell, I got you in a minute
Take a look at your charts, watch me climb
Turn it upside down, six digits to nine
Inside out, got reversible rhymes
We could go pop with it or run the block with it
Never before done 'til The Firm did it
If it ain't for the paper, then, nah, we not with it
Got to stay driven so we can stay drivin'
Vroom to my whole crew, gotta pull a diamond
See me lookin' hot in the crop SL
Gettin' richer, you wish you ran game this well
Rock the bells
Uh, is it raw? (Uh)
Uh-huh, to the core, uh
I'ma give it to ya raw, give your more, uh
Uh-huh, like that, yeah, c'mon, rock the bells
Rock the bells
Rock the bells
