What up, Firm? We got these niggas cornered, so maintain
I got the drugs here under the master bed behind the back stairs
Like twenty grams, plus the caravan
I left the keys by the safe, erase the code and flip the license plate
Got all the phone calls taped and all the weights and ice
To get the dough and the guns, and then we straight
He had the block locked, he knew the spot block
On some real web shit to get your spot knocked by killer cops
Tryna get your shit rocked, he don't know
'Cause all along we was plottin' to drop on the low
He straight snitch, he don't know how it go
He saw Nas, he know the Lex and the triple GS, for reala
I kinda think he got a feeling I'm squealin', me and Tone was on the phone
Probably thinkin' we dealin' this bug
Make sure Un got all the guns
His man Son had the whole mob of arsons runnin' through Parsons

Cormega know the spot, diminish him, Mega finish him
We power, the whole team shinin' through like Ma rule
Worse come to worse, we got shorties layin on 41st
They want The Firm somethin' awful, to tax somethin'
The way we style have a nigga tryin' to blast somethin'
I guess the way we politickin' probably got to niggas
I know they layin' like, "Dun, we got to stick them niggas"
In due time, they'll probably see the apple sour
And once we takin' over, they'll realize the world is ours
Them faggot niggas don't deserve to get cream
A bunch of snitches on the same team tryin' to reign supreme
Brooklyn, Queens thing, we lionhearted, never dear departed, I mean
You're fuckin' with Scarlett O'Hara
Desert 'em like Sahara, shit you never heard of, Firm strictly murderous
Gun is our punana, The Firm's First Lady organizer

Gon' cry together, shit get real, we gon' die together

Through the cheddar, through the cream, we gon' stay together
It's Doe or Die, through the slanted eyes
