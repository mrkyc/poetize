Lemme tell you where I grew up at
Sipped Mo', threw up at, flipped coke, blew up at
Where them fake thugs got they vestes chewed up at
Brooklyn beef, who want that?

I grew up in the thoroughest borough, BK
Where B.I.G. had everybody rockin' DK
Gav was the first dude with the CLK
And bricks was gettin' shipped out of East LA
It's Brooklyn, where niggas lives was tooken
Rich cats got knocked and they wives was tooken
Fort Greene and Hemlock, the fifth been cocked
We cried when they killed Lenox and popped them rocks
Ayo, y'all ain't hear what the **** I just said?
BK, the home of Biggie and Jay
Where niggas got Will Smith chips, get jiggy all day
Bitches that boost in the city all day
Heckle' and Koch, crack spots, federal watch
I grew up here, sipped Mo', threw up here
Yo, the feds snatched two up here in BK
Niggas in the hood in that all blue and grey
Gorillas got rich from stairwells and PA

Lemme tell you where I grew up at
Sipped Mo', threw up at, flipped coke, blew up at
Where them fake thugs got they vestes chewed up at
Brooklyn beef, who want that?

Brooklyn, the livest borough
You come here frontin', you might die in this borough
The East, the 'Ville and Bed-Stuy's in this borough
It's full of projects, the wildest borough
You try to figure out which side is thorough
From CI to Saint Marks is carryin' cons
Niggas rock Coogi and Dolce Gabbans
The women, they make a livin' just carryin' bombs
We pop corks a little bit, we floss a little bit
In the club buyin' out Cris', pour us a little bit
I told y'all that my borough was thorough
I know niggas that'll clap you up and bury the metal
Same day, still in the hood, we so ghetto
Brook-Nam, holla back, get your crook on
Live from the seven-one-eight, we raise the eight
Everytime papi raise the weight of that weight, motherfucker

It's BK nigga, get your vest ate up
Over them chips, you could get SKed up
They find you in the back of the building, sprayed up
All for the love of this paper, we misled
By twenty-one, some'll be dead
By twenty-two, the rest of these dudes'll be in the feds
We got change but we still fucked up
Niggas is outta jail but they still locked up
The feds takin' flicks when we pullin' the drops up
BK open up, get popped up
You know it's the borough where cats drive with the box in they truck
Trey pound Glocked up, wrist be rocked up
Yellin' out, "Get down, lay down" when we pop up
Blocks so hot, we drive the drops with tops up
Windows tinted, you can't see who is in it
It's Brown nigga, I represent it, it's Brooklyn
