Aw yeah, without a doubt
We up in here chillin,' this is the Kid Capri
And I'm in the house with Foxy Brown
For the nine-pound plus one
And we got things goin' on in a big way in here
You know what I'm sayin'?
So what we gon' do right now is want you to get involved in what's about to happen
Yo, drop that, Foxy

I'm Don like Perignon, peep me
Continously to (Take money), indeed
They keep frontin', my Firm'll keep stuntin'
Fox, uh-oh, freak somethin'
B-12 Coupes flossin', high post, off me
Killin' 'em softly like Fugees
My lah be straight cheddar, in K sweater
Them pussies fuck dicks, raw dog shit
Bubblin' mad chips, hard in the six
Where we at? (Brooklyn), you know that
Niggas'll get dismissed, so peep this
I flows on like heroin
Don like Deion, rewind the Ill, uh, Na Na
Layin' in the 'tel on stone like Sharon
Let's see, niggas say he really yappin' about
How that dick be all that, he blowin' backs out
Please, I was in the drop-three, it was D
And his man from DC on some straight PD
I ain't mad, papa, do your thing, get your thug on
Keep holdin', and I'ma keep high rollin'

Now let me hear you say uh (Uh)

Ah-na-na, na-na (Na-na, na-na)
Well, here we go now

You know the Na Na is all that
That's why I get briquettes, and lazarus, and all that
In fact, my sex game's all that
'Cause when I do my thing, no turnin' back
Bet that, I be stashin' in C-10
Chrome Lauren, shittin' hard in the Benz
Morocco dreamin', nigga, schemin'
Should've seen 'em, 850, I beam in
Gettin' his wild on, frontin' at the bar
Guzzlin' that low, kiko (who he tryna style on?)
Courvoisier sippin' all day
He was ballin', suede Wallabees, three-sixty waves
Anyway, I continues to floss
Iceberg shit on the ass of course
That's how we plays, high post all day
Come 'round my way, see a true player play
Fox Boogie straight ballin' all day
You know how I do, nigga, the Firm way, hey
Now let me hear you go uh (Uh)
Ah-na-na, na-na (Ah-ha-na, na-na)
And let me hear you say uh (Uh)
Ah-na-na, na-na (Na-na, na-na)

The ill na-na, na-na (Na-na, na-na)
Let me hear you go uh, uh-uh-uh, uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
Na-na, na-na

When it come to niggas, I'm game tight, game alright
High post, I plays the frame all night, alright?
Like Sill, push twenty mil' easy
Unplugged, fucks with only thugs
Pretty niggas too, but I'm seein' you, uh
Definitely I'm untouchable, hair
Strokin' the Na Na is like cocoa
Bitch is a dime, go loco for that toto
Shit, it's dangerous, peep the wrist, uh
Explain this, rocks all crisp
Chicks fuckin' for nothin', please, mama
Better get that cheese, villainess, on her knees
Tell him fuck the mink, she want a Persian lamb
Frontin', from where? He talkin' cribs, then he sayin somethin'
Sexual status, we's the baddest
Girls, we got the weapons, niggas got to have this
Pure Chandon frontin', to start somethin'
He buggin', lustin' over nothin', 'cause I'm gone
Now let me hear you go uh (Uh)
Ah-na-na, na-na (Ah-ha-na, na-na)
And let me hear you go uh (Uh)
Ah-na-na, na-na (Na-na, na-na)
And let me hear you say uh (Uh)
'Cause it's the ill na-na, na-na (Na-na, na-na)
I wanna hear you go uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Na-na, na-na

Along with Foxy Brown
Big shouts to The Firm
Big shouts to the TrackMasters
Big shouts to all my people in the Boogie Down BX

And everybody all over the world
'Cause it's goin' down like that
As we go get this money
We up outta here
