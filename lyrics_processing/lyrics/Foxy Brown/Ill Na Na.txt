One time
Huh, all up in you like a bone when I
Johnny Blaze the Iron Lung
Foxy Brown the Ill Na Na (Yeah, c'mon)
Destination (C'mon, c'mon), plat'

Yo, Na Na so Ill, first week out
Shipped a half a mil', niggas freaked out
She's all about sex, pardon, check your facts
And the track record, I'm all about plaques
Shaking my ass half-naked, lovin' this life
Waitin' for Kim album to drop, knowin' it's tight
Standing center stage, closin' the show holdin' a gat
Since you opened up, I know you're hoping it's wack
Niggas screamin' my name on record, straight wildin'
Maybe I'll answer back when you reach a hundred thousand
This is ladies night, and the Mercedes tight
When I'm coming home? Maybe tonight
Leave my food by the microwave, kiss the baby goodnight
It's my time to shine, it's playtime tonight
'Member tryna stand my ground, know when I fall
I left your ass home alone, hopin' I call

Who got the illest pussy on the planet?
Sugar walls comin' down, niggas can't stand it, the Ill Na Na
True Absolut Vodka, straight shots
For the has-beens and have-nots, dollar, dollar
Bill, and it don't stop, we movin' up
First the mansion, then the yacht, sound proper
Straight cash get got
Bloodhounds tryna hunt down the Brown Fox, the Ill Na Na

No more sexin' me all night, thinkin' it's alright
While I'm lookin over your shoulder, watching the hall light
You hate when it's a ball, right? Ladies, this ain't handball
Nigga, hit these walls right before I call Mike
In the morning when it's all bright, eggs over-easy
Hope you have my shit tight when I open my eyes
While I'm eating getting dressed up, this ain't your pad
I left some money on the dresser, find you a cab
No more, sharin' our pain, sharin' our maid
It's time to outslick niggas, ladies sharin' our game
Put it in high gear, flip the eyewear
Nas ruled the world, but now it's my year
And from here on, I solemnly swear
To hold my own like Pee Wee in a movie theater (Uh-uh)
Yeah, I don't need a man's wealth (Yeah)
But I can do bad by my damn self (Self), and, uh

Who got the illest pussy on the planet?
Sugar walls comin' down, niggas can't stand it, the Ill Na Na
True Absolut Vodka, straight shots
For the has-beens and have-nots, dollar, dollar
Bill, and it don't stop, we movin' up
First the mansion, then the yacht, sound proper
Straight cash get got
Bloodhounds tryna hunt down the Brown Fox, the Ill Na Na
Uh, vodka
Not, not
Dollar, dollar, stop
C'mon, c'mon, yah
It's the Ill Na Na

No more waitin' to exhale, we takin' deep breaths
Ladies take this all from Fox, repeat this
Love thyself, put no one above thee
'Cause ain't nobody gon' love me like me
If he don't do the right thing like Spike Lee
Bye-bye, wifey, make him lose his Nikes (Uh, uh)
Hit the road (Yeah)
Mommy told me in order to find a prince, you gotta kiss some toads

Who got the illest pussy on the planet?
Sugar walls comin' down, niggas can't stand it, the Ill Na Na
True Absolut Vodka, straight shots
For the has-beens and have-nots, dollar, dollar
Bill, and it don't stop, we movin' up

Straight cash get got
