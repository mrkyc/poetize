Uh, yeah
Uh, Firm
Lust, hate, envy, jealousy
Conniving niggas
Nigga nature, uh, yeah, uh

Jumped out the ride, floss high
Black tie, cocoa and lye
Three guys, slanted eyes, I shoulda tried
Sweet thugs stay dove up in the land
Crash bar, ill beam, and threw this cream
My whole team must fiend, the ghetto dream
Fox Boog jigged up, stay in the cut like what?
Slayin' in the Bentley, stoned, flossed on
Me a Capone, Picasso
Mardi Gras, play the low in the six-double-oh Benz chrome
Dominicano superstar, Lila Escobar, holy matrimon'
Tied to The Firm, die for The Firm, so help me, God
Street life played right, I got his wife hemmed up, and what?
Nigga, two to the gut

Nowhere to rest, nigga, nowhere to hide
It's a high-speed chase and death is on my mind
Will I fall or fail? Who call the shots? It's all real
Firm, get on your job, niggas, what the deal?
Nowhere to rest, nigga, nowhere to hide
It's a high-speed chase

Threw the heater to the grill, it was real
Pure steel, my niggas peel, murderin'
Gunnin' through Queens in Beams
Forty-four chrome, MAC-11, stow it in they jeans
Pretty thugs, Firm team hold it down, we hold the crown
Got it locked, rock shop, heroin cop
Out of town, breeze through, he had a V2 baby blue
No clue we had this whole life planned
Call the fam, lay low, Firm style, let it flow

Nowhere to rest, nigga, nowhere to hide
It's a high-speed chase and death is on my mind
Will I fall or fail? Who call the shots? It's all real
