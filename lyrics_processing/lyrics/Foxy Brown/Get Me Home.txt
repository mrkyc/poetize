Uh, yeah
I, I
Firm biz, what it is? Blackstreet (I, I)
Ooh (Na Na, steady ride, peace, dada), baby
I gotta get you home with me tonight (Gotta get you home), come on

Hold up, let's take it from the top, I, Fox
Gets my swerve on, floss pure rocks
In the six drop, boo, and it don't stop
See money lookin' alright, yeah, what up, pap'?
'Cross the room throwin' signals, I'm throwin' 'em back
Flirtin' 'cause I digs you like that
Peep baby boy style, hopin' we match
He sent me Crown Royale with a note attached
It said, "You look like the type that know what you like"
I could tell by the jewels you go for the ice
Plus you wear the shoes well, the suit flows nice
I don't like the notes too well, let's be more precise
Meet me by the VIP, let's powwow
Whisper in my ear like, "Boo, let's bounce now"
I'm 'bout to say peace to my mans for you
When it's all said and done, I got plans for you, he said (Gotta get you home tonight)

Ooh, baby (Gotta get you home with me)
I gotta get you home with me tonight, uh-oh, uh-oh
Ooh, baby (Oh)
I gotta get you home with me tonight (C'mon, c'mon)
You might also like
At the bar high-post, frontin', I toast
Gettin' my flirt on, playa, ain't nothin'
He tryna say the right words to get us out of here
Jackpot when he said, "It's bullshit in here"
And his smile blind like the shine on his necklace
Mind tellin' me no, body tellin' me exit
Breasts said yes, give me more wet kisses
Uh, twist my body like The Exorcist, hey
The way he licks his lips, he was mackin'
True thug passion, I'm like, "Slow down before you crashin'"
Never mind him, he ain't thinkin' 'bout you
Or the way we sex on the villa up in Malibu
Marry who? Daddy, please
I'm takin' it all from the stash to the keys, so let me see
Boo, I'm 'bout to dead my mans for you
When it's all said and done I got plans for you, he said (Ooh, baby, yeah)

Ooh, baby (I need you, want you in my life)
I gotta get you home with me tonight (Gotta get you home with me tonight), uh-oh, uh-oh
Ooh, baby (Baby, I need you)
I gotta get you home with me tonight (Right here, oh)

Grabbed me by the hand and led the way
Outside of the club talkin' to valet
Mind started to stray a million miles away
Contemplatin' goin' back to his crib to parlay
Jumped in the passenger seat, relaxed my feet
As he threw on Blacksteet casually
And we cruised the metro on premium petrol
Eyes sized up my thighs and couldn't let go
Ta-tas perkin', you're makin' me high
Like Toni, work me, take me, I'm hot
I thought for a second and then my mind went
Sex all around the car, isn't it ironic?
Back to reality, the soul to soul
Breathin' heavily, but still in control
Lost the shy girl role, put my hand on his leg
With sex in his eyes, he turned and then he said (Tonight, baby)
Ooh, baby (Come on, come on, Foxy, come on)
I gotta get you home with me tonight (Whatever you want me to do), uh-oh, uh-oh (Do it for you, baby)
Ooh, baby (Oh, yeah, I need it in my life)
I gotta get you home with me tonight (Woah-oh, I, I)
Ooh, baby (Gotta get you home tonight, I, I)
I gotta get you home with me tonight (Gotta get you home tonight), uh-oh, uh-oh
Ooh, baby (Gotta get you home tonight, I, I)
I gotta get you home with me tonight (Gotta get you home tonight, I, I)
