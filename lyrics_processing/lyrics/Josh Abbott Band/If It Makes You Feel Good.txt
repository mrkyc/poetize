Yeah, you know I like your hair down
Let it down, let it down, let it down
Tap your toes in the wind through the window
Keeping time with the radio
If it makes you feel good, use my lap as a pillow
Go on, go on, go on

Oh, oh, oh
You got the moonlight rocking in your eyes tonight
Oh, oh, oh
Don't start stopping 'cause it feels so right
There's a sweet kiss falling off the edge of your lips
Hot as any summer night's ever gonna get
Go on, go on, go on if it makes you feel good

You know I like it when you dance slow
Slow as we can go
Steaming up the windows
Dancing in the dashboard glow
Do what you wanna do, girl
You got the key to my world
So go on, go on, go on, go on, go on

I'm game for anything that crosses your mind
It's all about you, baby, tonight
