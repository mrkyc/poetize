It was right about sunset
She was sitting pretty on the front step
She said, "hey baby, are you done yet?
Are you gonna work all day?"
I started walking up the driveway
She said, "I'm headed inside, babe"
Before the screen door slammed
She turned and asked if I needed anything

I said this cup could use a little more whiskey
This porch could use a little more swing
This week could use a little more weekend
And we could use a little more Hank
This world could use a little more country
The sky could use a little more blue
Those bees could use a little more honey
And I could use a little more you

Trees swaying when the wind blows
Record playing in the window
Yeah we're taking it real slow while the crickets sing for us
She's got her legs hanging over me
There's no telling where the night might lead
When your kisses are sweet as sweet can be
I can never get enough

This week could use a little more weekend
And we could use a little more Hank
This world could use a little more country
The sky could use a little more blue
Those bees could use a little more honey
And I could use a little more you
And I could use a little more you

Oh these arms could use a little holding
And yours could use a little more too
But we both could use a little more loving
And I could use a little more

This cup could use a little more whiskey
This porch could use a little more swing
This week could use a little more weekend
And we could use a little more Hank
This world could use a little more country
The sky could use a little more blue
Those bees could use a little more honey
And I could use a little more you
