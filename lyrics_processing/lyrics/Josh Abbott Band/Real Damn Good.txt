Her favorite color is faded Levi blue
She folds her laundry in her birthday suit
Yeah, I was at the TV during Family Feud
Puts her turquoise on when she's in the mood
She puts her turquoise on when she's in the mood
She keeps her makeup in a coffee can
Got a Bible verse tattoo in her hand
Goes 90 in a 50 in her mini van
And she's real damn good at not giving a damn
She's real damn good at not giving a damn

She's a little bit out there, whole lotta don't care, gonna do what she wants
Living her life one night at a time, more hippie than debutante
She's genuine, one of a kind, hard to find, hard to understand
She ain't that great at not being late
She's real damn good at not giving a damn
She's real damn good at not giving a damn
She's real damn good at not giving a damn

Packs a .38 special in her Gucci purse
Likes chocolate on her chocolate when she has desserts
Wears a KISS T-shirt when she goes church
I never met a woman quite like her
Never met a woman quite like her
