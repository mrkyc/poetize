And the radio ain't playing none of your favorite songs
I know the cars driving by have got you thinking about
What might be going on just a few streets down
I'm hanging around if you're hanging around
If you're staying at home, if you're painting the town
If you want to talk, you can give me a call
Or if you really don't feel like talking at all
If you're drinking a beer, I'm drinking a beer
Just get in a cab and get over here
If you want some fun, if you're needing a buzz
We've got all night, baby if you're up or hanging around
Oh, I'm hanging around
You can leave in the morning or later tonight
You don't have to call tomorrow if it ain't feeling right
No you don't have to worry if it's gonna last
There ain't gotta be any strings attached
I'm hanging around if you're hanging around
If you're staying at home, if you're painting the town
If you want to talk, you can give me a call
Or if you really don't feel like talking at all
If you're drinking a beer, I'm drinking a beer
Just get in a cab and get over here
If you want some fun, if you're needing a buzz
We've got all night, baby if you're up or hanging around
I'm hanging around, yeah
