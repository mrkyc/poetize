Small talkin', old friends
Catching up on how you been
That smile I missed
Damn, it's good to see you again
I bought you a drink and I asked you to dance
After a couple more rounds, you were holdin' my hand
Next thing you know, we're closing it down
And we're sharin' a cab back to your house

And I know we were laughin' sayin' whatever happens
We can blame it on the wine when the sun comes up
If you're thinkin' it's because we were drinkin'
Well, that don't mean that it don't mean much
Cause it did, and it does
The truth of it is I wasn't that drunk

I was tipsy when you kissed me
But that ain't why I kissed you back
I'll be honest, I've wanted to do that, to do that, do that
Oh so long, yeah, oh so bad
Then last night, it happened so fast
And I'd do it over, I wouldn't think twice
Cause lying here sober, it still feels right

And I know we were laughin' sayin' whatever happens
We can blame it on the wine when the sun comes up
If you're thinkin' it's because we were drinkin'
Well, that don't mean that it don't mean much
Cause it did, and it does
The truth of it is I wasn't that drunk

And I want you to know it wasn't just the heat of the moment

And I know we were laughin' sayin' whatever happens
We can blame it on the wine when the sun comes up
If you're thinkin' it's because we were drinkin'
Well, that don't mean that it don't mean much
Cause it did, and it does
The truth of it is I wasn't that drunk
