It started with I'm better off without you
I didn't think your leaving would hit me so damn hard
I can list all the things I miss about you
You left me here with bottles tears and scars
Tried every little thing to fix it but it's in vain
I just can't seem to kick it wheeling this pain

Healing just ain't working with this kinda hurting for me
Your love is all I need
I gotta keep that whiskey flying
Bird it's just like you're lying for me
Another shot to set me free
I got that no more kissing you lovesick crushing you
Feeling blue, damn kinda missing you

Well all those things you did that drove me crazy
Like spin the truth and make me so damn mad
Oh it's just a couple awful white lies baby
You wonder if I'm pissed yeah just a tad
I just wanna hold you but it's too late
If it weren't I'd take a shot at one more mistake

Healing just ain't working with this kinda hurting for me
Your love is all I need
I gotta keep that whiskey flying
Bird it's just like you're lying for me
Another shot to set me free
I got that no more kissing you lovesick crushing you
Feeling blue, damn kinda missing you
Ain't hard to do this town

Healing just ain't working with this kinda hurting for me
Your love is all I need
