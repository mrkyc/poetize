Yeah, losin' my mind (ey, ey)
Losin' my mind (ey bitch)
Losin' my mind (ey, ey)
Losin' my mind (She pop one time, pop two times, pop three times and I'm feelin' just fine)
Haha, so Bentley
Out my fuckin' mind that behave so silly
She really wanna get with me
Cause she know a nigga hot, chili
Peppers and every single heifer want this fellah
Reals, Mr. Hugh Hefner
Mister put a bitch on lock like a cellar
Pussy, tighter than a turtle neck sweater
In the club, tryn'a fuck a white bitch named Debra
Touch her, she gets wetter
Better than rainy weather
Heather, let her play tetherball with my pole
And if she don't she gotta go, oh, yeah
Sorry babe I gotta go
I'm loaded in this bitch turnin' like a spiral
I'm vital to your life, suicidal
I'm tryn'a put a fuckin' dick in your spinal
Get it, get it poppin'!

I'm so high, birds look up to me
Chillin' in the clouds livin' life of the luxury
Cold Flame game
You should come and join the company
Married in this bitch so there ain't no dumpin' me
And I can't see straight
And I'm too bent so a nigga can't pee straight
Walk with a limp, feelin' like a nigga's knees break
Talkin' to a bush, I can tell you what the trees say
Ey, now, babe when we say
"Back that thang up and then press replay"
So back that thang up and then press replay
Dash is the name and Cold Flamez is the fuckin' game
I done lost my mind
Pease no more dranks lil' mama I'm fine
Yeah, and she not my kind
But a nigga so drunk that I'm damn near blind
And I'm feelin' so right, we feelin' so right
Mama can't feel me without feelin' my pipe

On the path of destruction, turnt up
Mama feel the flame so let me do my thang, ha
Took self-destruct so refill my cup
And excuse me if I throw up
C F gang, C F game
Look around, look around
Everybody pointin', who's to blame?
It's me, Mic 3rd, mothafucka
Skinny dude, really dude
Nigga leanin' like he got a 'tude
He do. She do what I say
And I'm a sex addict I just thought I'd say
Hey, let's play a game
Let's get nasty
See who the freak of the night
Come on
It's online baby, sex ain't a crime baby
Use what your mom gave you
Work that behind, baby Mic 3rd
Make you feel it in your spine
Baby if you not with it then I'm gettin' lost
I'm Jack Frost cold, polar bear
In the North Pole drinkin' coke chillin' with the band
