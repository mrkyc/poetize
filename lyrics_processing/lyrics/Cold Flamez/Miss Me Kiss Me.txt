Dolla sign H!
H stands for hooligan

Miss me, miss me, now she wanna kiss me
Never eva broke so you ain't gotta fix me
Skinny jeans keep a nigga biscuit from a slippin'
Biscuit headed bone nigga, now he just a pip squeak
Mr. Hitta old nigga, now he just a toddler
To all hip hoppa's, I am ya fatha'
You got a problem, I am ya docta'
You ride a boppa, you see a monsta'
And I am a mess, call me Dash D Cadet, here to serve and protect
Oh, and do not forget, I'll murder your flesh
Beat it over again and then murder your best friends
Ha!
Put it in the air, keep your face down as you pull your underwear
And if your friends want to join, they can meet me under there
Cause I might go down if it's clean up under there

Aye girl, you nasty
Girl, you nasty

Kiss me, kiss me, now she wanna lick me
Seductive, got me walkin' round with a stiffy, hickeys
Let em know that she with me
She pinned me on the wall, had me singin like Whitney
Yeah, she threw that ass back, while her friend's up under was lickin' my sack
Aye babe, you nasty
And when we in the room, yeah, I got you all trashy
And when you 'gurt me, I always start laughin' a little
You do it so good, you make the shit tickle
Oh ooh, I really love it
Really reals baby fuckin' while I'm clubbin'
Beat it so good like a nigga nearly clubbed it
Loaded in this bitch, yeah, I feal like David Ruffin
Yeah, I love deep temptation
You know I gotta swipe you, impatiently waitin'
You might also like
Aye girl, you nasty
Girl, you nasty

Lick me, she licked me
And now she wanna kiss me
Bitch, back, back, I don't know where your lips be
It seems to be at night
Sorry to say, lil' mama, I'm call it a night
You can call whoever we can get it poppin' tonight
Skinny jeans on but I'm still ready to fight
Warrior earnin' my survival stripes
I feed off pain killers, strong about the night
Poppin' this now, I'm headed to the club tonight
To see what chick is my next victim
She spotted me, now she wanna fuck me on sight
I tell her bring your friends. she can suck me all night
You nasty girl
Man, I know you did it
You swallowed no spittin', greatness
Now it's time to leave, bye, no hugs or kisses
Thanks for the sex. it was great I admit it

Aye girl you nasty
Girl you nasty
