And the hero got a pie in the face
He didn't like that and he stormed around the screen
But everybody else was laughin' in that place
That's cause it ain't hard to get along with somebody else's troubles
And they don't make you lose any sleep at night
Just as long as fate is out there bustin' somebody else's bubbles
Everything's gonna be alright
And everything's gonna be alright
Tell me, did you ever have to pay for something that you didn't do?
And did you ever figure out the reason why?

He said, "We all have to tighten up our belts."
But he didn't look any thinner than he did a year ago

And I asked that undertaker what it took to make him laugh
When all he ever saw is people cryin'

Said, "Steve, business just gets better all the time."

And they don't make you lose any sleep at night
Just as long as fate is out there bustin' somebody else's bubbles
Everything is gonna be alright
