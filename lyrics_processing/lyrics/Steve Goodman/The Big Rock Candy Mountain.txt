Down a track came a hobo hikin'
He said boys I'm not turnin'
I'm headed for the land that's far away beside the crystal fountain
And I'll see you all this coming fall in the big rock candy mountains
In the big rock candy mountains
There's a land that's fair and bright
Where the hand-outs grow on bushes
And you sleep out every night
Where the boxcars all are empty
And the sun shines every day
I'm bound to go where there ain't no snow
The rain don't fall and the wind don't blow
In the big rock candy mountains
Oh, the buzzin' of the bees in the cigarette trees
And the soda water fountain
Where the lemonade springs and the bluebird sings
In the big rock candy mountains
In the big rock candy mountains you never wash your socks
And little streams of alcohol come tricklin' down the rocks
The boxcars all are empty
The sun shines every day
There's a lake of stew and ginger ale too
And you can paddle all around it in a big canoe
In the big rock candy mountains
You might also likeOh, the buzzin' of the bees in the cigarette trees
By the soda water fountain
Where the lemonade springs and the bluebird sings
In the big rock candy mountains
In the big rock candy mountains all the cops have wooden legs
The bulldogs all have rubber teeth
And the hens lay soft-boiled eggs
There ain't no short handled shovels
No axes, saws, or picks
Well I'm bound to stay where you sleep all day
Where they hung the jerk who invented work
In the big rock candy mountains
Oh, the buzzin' of the bees in the cigarette trees
And the soda water fountain
Where the lemonade springs and the bluebird sings
