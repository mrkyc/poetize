He used to he a rodeo cowhand
He tried to rob the Kansas Railway
Along with two other friends of mine
I said for God's sake please don't do that
They put it off for quite some time
Until the fourth of January
Such a cold and bitter time
Snow was drifting on the line
A mind confused is sometimes altered
That's what a friend of mine who knows once told me
Don't tell a madman with a shotgun
That he is not supposed to shoot no one
Foolishly heeding my own counsel
Too easily tired of the fight
They done the deed and was successful
And returned that very night
Looking the same around the eyes
Having recently found Jesus
I tried to speak to them, as friends should do
Of the eternal consequences
And about those hellfires that wait below
You might also likeThey soon fell in with sweet companions
Who helped them spend their evil wage
Until the thought of precious Jesus
Drove me to a holy rage
And I knew they must be saved
Now who comes riding across the prairie
Seeking shelter from the wild deep snow
Why it's the sheriff and his deputies seeking
Information bout those three rodeo chums
I did not know that they'd be sleeping
That they'd come out with guns ablaze
And that all three was to be murdered
This was never my intention
This I swear I did not know
When I told the posse where to go
He used to be a roving cowboy
He used to he a rodeo cowhand
He tried to rob the Kansas Railway
Along with two other friends of mine
I said for God's sake do not do that
They put it off for quite some time
Until the fourth of January
Such a cold and bitter time
