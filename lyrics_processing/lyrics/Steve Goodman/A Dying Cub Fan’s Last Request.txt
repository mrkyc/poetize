By the shores of old Lake Michigan, where the hawk wind blows so cold
An old Cub fan lay dying in his midnight hour that tolled
All around his bed, his friends had all gathered, they knew his time was short
And on his head they put this bright blue cap from his all-time favorite sport
And he said, "It's late, it's getting dark in here and I know it's time to go
But before I leave the line-up, there's just one thing I'd like to know

Do they still play the blues in Chicago when baseball season rolls around?
When the snow melts away, do the Cubbies still play in their ivy-covered burial ground?
When I was a boy they were my pride and joy, but now they only bring fatigue
To the home of the brave, the land of the free and the doormat of the National League

He told his friends "You know the law of averages says that, 'Anything will happen that can'
That's what it says, but the last time the Cubs won a National League pennant
Was the year we dropped the bomb on Japan"
The Cubs made me a criminal, that's what they did
They stole my youth from me (that's the truth)
I'd forsake my teachers, to go sit in the bleachers, in flagrant truancy

Then one thing led to another and soon I'd discovered alcohol, gambling, dope
Football, hockey, lacrosse, but what do you expect
When you raise up a young boy's hopes?
And then just crush 'em like so many paper beer cups
You might also like
Year after year, after year, after year, after year, after year, after year, after year
'Til those hopes are just so much popcorn for the pigeons beneath the 'L' tracks to eat
He said, "You know I'll never see Wrigley Field, anymore before my eternal rest
So if you have your pencils and score cards ready, then I'll read you my last request

He said, "Give me a double header funeral in Wrigley Field on some sunny weekend day, no lights
Have the organ play the "National Anthem" and then a little 'Na, na, na, na, hey hey, hey, goodbye'
Make six bullpen pitchers carry my coffin and six ground keepers clear my path
Have the umpires bark me out at every base, in all their holy wrath

It's a beautiful day for a funeral, hey Ernie, let's play two!
Somebody go get Jack Brickhouse to come back, and conduct just one more interview
Have the Cubbies run right out into the middle of the field, have Keith Moreland drop a routine fly
Give everybody two bags of peanuts and a frosty malt and I'll be ready to die

Then build a big fire on home plate out of your Louisville Sluggers baseball bats and toss my coffin in
And let my ashes blow in a beautiful snow from the prevailing thirty mile-an-hour southwest wind
When my last remains go flying over the left-field wall, we'll bid the bleacher bums adieu
And I will come to my final resting place, out on Waveland Avenue

The dying man's friends told him to cut that out, they said stop it, boy, that's an awful shame
But he said, "Don't cry, we'll meet by and by near that heavenly hall of fame
He said, "I've got season's tickets to watch the Angels now, so that's just what I'm going to do
He said, "but you the living, you're stuck here with the Cubs, so its me that feels sorry for you!"
And when he said, "Play that lonesome losers' tune, gosh, it's the one I like the best"
He closed his eyes, and he slipped away, well, Mike
It was the Dying Cub Fan's Last Request
So here it is
