We were just about as wild
As we were green
In the ways of the world
She picked me up in that Red Ragtop
We were free of the folks
And hiding from the cops
On a summer night
Running all the red lights
We parked way out in a clearing in a grove
And the night was as hot
As a coal burning stove
We were cooking with gas
You might also likeOoh it had to last
In the back of that Red Ragtop
She said please don't stop
Well the very first time her mother met me
Her green eyed girl had been a mother to be
For two weeks
I was out of a job and she was in school
And life was fast and the world was cruel
We were young and wild
We decided not to have a child
So we did what we did and we tried to forget
And we swore up and down there would be no regrets
In the morning light
But on the way home that night
On the back of that Red Ragtop
She said please don't stop
Lovin' me
We took one more trip around the sun
But it was all make believe in the end
No I can't say where she is today
I can't remember who I was back then
Well you do what you do
And you pay for your sins
And there's no such thing as
What might have been
That's a waste of time
Drive you outta your mind
I was stopped at a red light just yesterday
Beside a young girl in a Cabriole
And her eyes were green and I was in an old scene
I was back in that Red Ragtop
On the day she stopped lovin' me
I was back in that Red Ragtop
