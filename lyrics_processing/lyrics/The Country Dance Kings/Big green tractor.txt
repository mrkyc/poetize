Sittin' in the drive but she wouldn't get out
The dogs were all barkin' and waggin' around
And I just laughed and said y'all get inShe had on a new dress and she curled her hair
She was looking too good not to go somewhere
Said "what you want to do, baby, I don't care
We can go to the show, we can stay right here"And I can take you for a ride on my big green tractor
We can go slow or make it go faster
Down through the woods and out to the pasture
'Long as I'm with you it really don't matterClimb up in my lap and drive if you want to
Girl, you know you got me to hold on to
We can go to town, but baby if you'd rather
I'll take you for a ride on my big green tractorSaid we can fire it up and I can show you around
Sit up on the hill and watch the sun go down
When the fireflies are dancing and the moon comes out
We can turn on the lights and head back to the houseOr we can take another ride on my big green tractor
We can go slow or make it go faster
Down through the woods and out to the pasture
'Long as I'm with you it really don't matterClimb up in my lap and drive if you want to
Girl, you know you got me to hold on to
We can go to town, but baby if you'd rather
I'll take you for a ride on my big green tractorJust let me dust off the seat
Mmm, put your pretty little arms around me
Hell yeahYou can climb up in my lap and drive if you want to
Girl, you know you got me to hold on to
We can go to town, but baby if you'd rather
I'll take you for a ride on my big green tractorOh yeah, yeah
We can go to town
We can go another round
