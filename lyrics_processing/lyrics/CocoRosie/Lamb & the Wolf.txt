Here's a little story
I like to tell
I'm the sister of Lucy, the angel who fell
He walks with his guns
Big, black his soul
Doing patrol, hunting for trolls
He stepped on a snail
The poor thing wailed
I'm afraid he got killed

The lamb & the wolf
It's always the same
The little lamb dies and the wolf gets framed
The wolf gets framed

Shepherd, shepherd, count your bears
Shepherd, shepherd, mend your tears
Pray to Mary, set you free
Close your eyes and count to three
Raise a glass and make a toast
Pour some out for all the ghosts

It's always the same, always the same, always the same
When the wolf gets blamed
It's always the same, always the same, always the same
Just the wolf gets framed
It's always the same, always the same, always the same
The wolf gets blamed
It's always the same, always the same, always the same
The little lamb dies and the wolf gets framed

I'm gonna have to call the FBI
At the grocery store there was a weird guy
He threatened my wife not once but twice
He's jealous of my piece of paradise
No more Mrs. Nice Guy, they're tryin' to Britney Spears me
It's a conspiracy, conspiracy, conspiracy (conspiracy, conspiracy, conspiracy)

I cut my hair, rest the buzzer and the Dutch slipped near
I stuck my lizard and my zipper and I bleeded tears
The sun is hot, I need to take me shade
Like a sudden door to an open lemonade
I gotta keep my cool cause I'm paranoid
Trying to wrangle all the tangles in this empty void
They talk back and my shadow laughs
The lamb & the wolf
It's always the same
The little lamb dies and the wolf gets framed

It's always the same
The wolf gets blamed
It's always the same, it's always the same
When the little lamb dies and the wolf gets framed

Oh, it's always the same, always the same
When he little lamb dies and the wolf gets framed
It's always the same, always the same
When the little lamb dies and the wolf gets framed
It's always the same, always the same
When the little lamb dies and the wolf gets blamed
It's always the same, always the same
