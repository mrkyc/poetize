I'm going to get a bag
The wind is just right
And the violets think so too
I think I spy a chat
Making a poo
I'd like to gypsy-lift the stars
And send one out to you
You, who are you
Someone with no dandruff
Perhaps brown eyes a derelict
A dandy
I'm out shopping in my canoe
Finger frolicking the fireflies
Finger fucking firewood
Spying on the masturbating snails
Hollyhocks and cat tails
Boneless jelly fish and whales
Perhaps I'll meet you then
On the decadent horizon
Where young lovers lock lips
Looking at the lockness monster
Phooey, phooey, hence cabluey
Gypsying-lifting on a hand stand
Little fawny, dawn-lit and scrawny
Daryl, Jordan, Henry and Johnny

Un beso, un beso
Your palm on my heart
It's just me the chimney sweep
Little bo-peep
Tending to her sheep
Eating her curds and whey
Daryl Hanna, get a grip
It's only the first season
Of the end of your career
Nightmares and dreams
Harlequins and queens
Who is my truest love
Don't make me take my finger out
And point it in your direction
The bible tells me so
Gee wiz
He's out shopping in the trees again
Moss on trees, moss on trees, moss on trees
Broken branches, avalanches
Who's got the keys to my jeep
Who's got the code to the condo of my soul
Out robbing graves again like Marilyn Manson
I'll admit I'm popular amongst the ivies and the ferns
Can't say if the felines took to me
Out robbing graves again like Marilyn Manson
