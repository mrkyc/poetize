There's a guy in the place who's got a bittersweet face
And he goes by the name of Ebeneezer Goode
His friends call him 'Ezer and E is the main geezer
And E vibes up the place like no other man could
E's refined, E's sublime, E makes you feel fine
Though very much maligned and misunderstood
But if you know 'Ezer E's a real crowd pleaser
E's ever so good - he's Ebeneezer Goode
You can see that E's mischievous, mysterious and devious
When E circulates amongst the people in the place
But once you know E's fun, and something of a genius
E gives a grin that goes around face to face to face
Backwards and then forwards, forwards and then backwards
'Eezer is the geezer, E loves to muscle in
That's about the time the crowd all shout the name of 'Ezer
As E's crouching in the corner, laughing by the bass bin

Ebeneezer Goode, leading light of the scene, know what I mean?
E created the vibe - E takes you for a ride as if by Design
The party ignites like it's comin' alive
E takes you to the top, shakes you all around
And back down - you know as he gets mellow
Then as smooth as the groove that is making you move
E glides into your mind with a sunny "Hello!"
A gentleman of leisure E's there for your pleasure
But go easy on old 'Ezeer he's the love you could lose
Extraordinary fellow, like Mr Punchinello
E's the kind of geezer who must never be abused
When you're in town and Ebeneezer is around
You can sense a presence in the sound of the crowd
E gets them all at it - the party starts rocking - the people get excited
It's time to shout LOUD!
