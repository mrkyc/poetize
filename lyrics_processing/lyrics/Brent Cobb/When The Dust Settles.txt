Nowadays, it's a race to the top
You got one shot to make your mark
You can do what the whole crowd's doin'
Or you can do what's in your heart

Well, there's money, if you win it
If your heart ain't in it, well, it ain't worth a dime
So get your tombstone ready and your suit 'n' tie steady
'Cause you might as well be dying

Cut all my wires, slash my tires
Throw my keys off of Slaughter Creek Bridge
If I get damned for givin' a damn, you can't say I never did
But there's too many jacked-up trucks in the way
And this dirt track's gettin' old
When the dust settles, I'll get on down the road

It's a shame that the love for the game
Ain't what the ride's about no more
Well it's nice to be number one
Hell, that's what we're all here for
But ain't there room for somethin'
That ain't like nothin' nobody ever saw
If there isn't, then forget it, you can have it
I'd rather not be known at all
