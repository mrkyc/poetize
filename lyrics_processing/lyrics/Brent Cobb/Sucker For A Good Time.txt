Well I guess I overdid it
Why can't I learn to quit it?
There must be somethin' bred in my bones
I heard a story 'bout my grandpappy
Gettin' down and rollin' till dawn

Way down in Alabama
Just south of Tallahatta
Them fellas hate to hear my name
'Cause all their pretty girlfriends shun them Lord
And leave me to blame

Well it's a mean scene, man
You never seen nothin' like it
And I ain't the kind to stretch out the truth
Every time I head south, son
I always come back missing a tooth

Hey, if work won't pay the first dime
Might as well sell a hook-line
Y'all, it ain't my fault
I'm just a sucker for a good time

She was dressed in Dolce Vita
Alone sippin' tequila
Breathtakingly gorgeous in pearl
A Eufaula temptress
And soon to be my company girl

Well the band was slowly swingin'
When Jessica came to me
Asked, "When you think you gonna save me a dance?"
In her eyes, I sensed madness
And whispered "Honey, here's your last chance"

She was a lap cat, man
I never had nothing like her
And I ain't the kind to stretch out a lie
While she was getting even
I was getting close to goodbye

Hey, if work won't pay the first dime
Might as well sell a hook-line
Y'all, it ain't my fault
I'm just a sucker for a good time
I was on the way out the back
When somethin' caught me
Like a stack of cinderblocks across the jaw
Overhead was a jealous red
Corn-fed and ready to brawl

Well I finally found my feet
I turned to him the other cheek
Said, "Mister, take it if you want 'cause I'm owed it
But just know I didn't know she had herself a sure-enough one-and-only"

Hey, if work won't pay the first dime
Might as well sell a hook-line
Y'all, it ain't my fault
I'm just a sucker for a good time

Hey, if work won't pay the first dime
Might as well sell a hook-line
Y'all, it ain't my fault
