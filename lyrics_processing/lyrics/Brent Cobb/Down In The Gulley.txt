Well, my granddaddy was a good man
No matter what the papers say
He worked 'til he bled for everything he had
Brought us up to do the same
One afternoon in June, they had us workin'
Just like a couple mules
My cousin and me were twenty feet deep
And covered in red mud clay

Well, we ran pipe from the creek bed through the woods
To the old grey shack
It was worth the trouble to work them shovels
For granddaddy's sour mash stash
All the weeds and pecan trees hid a secret
We all swore to keep
Well, my granddaddy knew what the law would do
If they ever come snoopin' 'round back

Lord, I'm down in the gulley where the creek is high
Lord, I'm down in the gulley where only the moon shines

Without money you can't buy nothin'
And nothin' is a damned ol' shame
When you're in the hole, you'd sell your soul
For runnin' water instead of rain
Well, the hills were filled with the smell of cash
Cookin' in the copper still
Everybody knew where to get their brew
And that made our family name

Well, years and laws passed by
They couldn't keep the county dry
One night, the sheriff went to lookin' for the man who was cookin'
That bootleg moonshine
Well, he called the press and he brought his best to
Tear our old shack down
But when they went for the stash, my granddaddy laughed
For the shack was a pump house

Lord, I'm down in the gulley where the creek is high
Lord, I'm down in the gulley where only the moon shines

It was down in the gulley where the creek is high
