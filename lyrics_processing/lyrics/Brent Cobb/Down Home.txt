Early in the mornin 'fore the sun comes up
Wood's burnin' in the stove
Coffee's stirrin' in his cup
He's chompin' at the dish to get his young'ns outta bed
Check the baskets at the creek
Get the hogs and chickens fed
By the time we get to town the church crowd will be gone
Grand daddy grins
Sunday sure is a blessing when you're livin' down home

Down home, everybody's got one
Down home, the place that you come from
Down home, it's something that your momma said
It ain't just a good place for you to lay your head

It's on the way to pick up crickets
Stoppin' by at Uncle Johnny's
Askin' if he'll make you fishin'
Oh, and he won't probably
Aunt Dot's got a honey do list a mile long
She bought the pants, hemmed them up and put them on
Wears them everywhere she goes
He just tags along
Oh, 'cause love is unconditional when you're livin' down home

Later in the evening with his babies back in bed
Yellow belly, bream and crickets still hoppin' through our head
I say "Thank you Lord for Grandpa and all my family
Days like today sure mean the world to me
I understand you have a plan when we up and go"
(One...) Do we ever really leave when we're livin' down home?

Down home, Heaven's on a rural route
Down home, forever never runs out
Down home, it's always blue skies
Down home, angels wave when they fly by
Way down home, you can see past tomorrow
Down home, there's never any sorrow
Down home, it's something Jesus said
