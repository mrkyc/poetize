I checked the time, it was almost time
A curious smell, an intangible crime
I'm washing my clothes, but the stain still grows
Cover your eyes, the stain still shows

I feel the graze against my skin
I feel the graze against my skin
I know this feeling is a lie
I know this feeling is a lie
There's a guilt within my mind
There's a guilt within my mind
I know this feeling is a lie
I know this feeling is a lie

I don't need this pressure on
I don't need this pressure on
I don't need this pressure on...
I don't need this pressure on
I don't need this pressure on
I don't need this pressure on...

What's the question I'll ignore
What's the question I'll ignore
Songs are always buried deep
Songs are always buried deep
There's a lion in my arms
There is motion in my arm
What's the question I'll ignore
I should believe and not ignore

You go down, down
Pass the talk of town
You go down Greek Street
Then it's underground
Well it's Soho life
For this mobile knife
It's the place to shoot
Friday night beat route

I don't need this pressure on
I don't need this pressure on...
I don't need this pressure on
