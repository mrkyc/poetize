I don't have to be so wise
You're just my fantasy and I will fantasise
Something more or less to make things started
We're the artisans and we've been crafted

I wanna be your magical mystery
I wanna be your final history
This is the news

Nothing's ever been so wild
All that I get to do is what I give to you
This is all about the circles we've found
And through the ups and downs, it goes round

Oh, I was just beginning to grow strong
She was only eighteen summers long
We were the news

Round and round it goes
And, oh, don't you know
This is the game that we came here for
Round and round it goes
And, oh, don't you know, ooh
