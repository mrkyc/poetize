Passion, take the wind
And break me from this tie
We're mortals on the Earth
Oh, but God's up in the sky
I haven't got a clue
I haven't got a thing
But what I give to you
Is all that I could bring

Woo-ooh, woo-ooh
Woo-ooh

I'll give you all my time
That's everything to me
You know my only crime
Is this flight of fantasy

Woo-ooh, woo-ooh
Woo-ooh
You might also like
Because I've nothing else here for you
And just because it's easier than the truth
Oh, if there's nothing else that I can do, I'll fly for you
Ooh, because I've nothing else here for you
And just because it's easier than the truth
Oh, if there's nothing else that I can do, I'll fly for you

Passion, take the wind
And break me from this tie
We're mortals on the Earth
Oh, but God's up in the sky
I haven't got a clue
I haven't got a thing
But what I give to you
Is all that I could bring

Woo-ooh, woo-ooh
Woo-ooh

Because I've nothing else here for you
And just because it's easier than the truth
Oh, if there's nothing else that I can do, I'll fly for you
Ooh, because I've nothing else here for you
And just because it's easier than the truth
Oh, if there's nothing else that I can do, I'll fly for you
I'll fly for you, ooh, I'll fly
I'm just an average boy
You're more than an average girl
And hen you sing to me the "shoo-be-doos", you sing so well
And don't you know that when I'm under you, I'm overjoyed?

Because I've nothing else here for you
And just because it's easier than the truth
Oh, if there's nothing else that I can do, I'll fly for you
Oh, because I've nothing else here for you
And just because it's easier than the truth
Oh, if there's nothing else that I can do, I'll fly for you
I'll fly for you, I'll fly for you
