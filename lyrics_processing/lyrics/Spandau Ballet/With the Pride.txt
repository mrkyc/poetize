Just leave me with the pride
That I worked for
Now they've taken the reason away
Just leave me with the pride
That I worked for
Today

Build on rock, or build on sand
They're never gonna lend a hand
So nothing grows or nothing stands
I can't take any more
I can't take any more
There's not a lot of space for me
But I've still got my dignity
I've got my price
Don't say I'm free
I can't take anymore
I can't take anymore

But I'm hungry
I could eat anything
But I'm hungry
Ooh, let's dance, ooh, let's swing
And all that I hear are the words that she sings
Now they've taken it all
Now they've taken it all
You might also like
Just leave me with the pride
That I worked for
Now they've taken the reason away
Just leave me with the pride
That I worked for
Today
Just leave me with the pride
That I worked for
Now they've taken the reason away
Just leave me with the pride
That I worked for
Today

I'd rather take this cure for life
Than make myself a sacrifice
When living is to pay the price
I can't take anymore
I can't take anymore
It takes a while to understand
When your eyes are full of sand
When only time is in your hands
I can't take anymore
I can't take anymore
But I'm hungry
I could eat anything
But I'm hungry
Ooh, let's dance, ooh, let's swing
And all that I hear are the words that she sings
Now they've taken it all
Now they've taken it all

Just leave me with the pride
That I worked for
Now they've taken the reason away
Just leave me with the pride
That I worked for
Today
Just leave me with the pride
That I worked for
Now they've taken the reason away
Just leave me with the pride
That I worked for
Today

But I'm hungry
I could eat anything
But I'm hungry
Ooh, let's dance, ooh, let's swing
And all that I hear are the words that she sings
Now they've taken it all
Now they've taken it all

Just leave me with the pride
That I worked for
Now they've taken the reason away
Just leave me with the pride
That I worked for
Today
Just leave me with the pride
That I worked for
Now they've taken the reason away
Just leave me with the pride
That I worked for
Today

Just leave me with the pride
With the pride (that I worked for today)
Just leave me with the pride
That I worked for
Now they've taken the reason away
Just leave me with the pride
That I worked for
Today
Leave me with the pride
Leave me with the pride
With the pride
That I worked for
