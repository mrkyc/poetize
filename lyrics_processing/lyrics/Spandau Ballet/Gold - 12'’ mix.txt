Sorry that the chairs are all worn
I left them here I could have sworn
These are my salad days
Slowly being eaten away
Just another play for today
Oh, but I'm proud of you
But I'm proud of you
Nothing left to make me feel small
Luck has left me standing so tall

Always believe in your soul
You've got the power to know
You're indestructible, always believe in, 'cos you are

I'm glad that you're bound to return
There's something I could have learned
You're indestructible, always believe in
After the rush has gone
I hope you find a little more time
Remember we were partners in crime
It's only two years ago
The man with the suit and the face
You knew that he was there on the case
You might also likeNow he's in love with you
He's in love with you
And love is like a high prison wall
But you could leave me standing so tall
