Oh, you're always in the back of my mind

Nothing ever changes
Oh, I wish to god it did
Just another drink and you'll be gone
Oh it's 2 a.m. raining again
I saw you making faces in the river
Only me, down by the quay
Just a sad reflection that I give you

Oh, I thought time would burn it
Burn it down to the ground
Just another breeze and you'll be strong
Driving home, all on my own
Just a passenger in all that we lost
Satisfy, oh, lord don't deny
I see your face in the everything that's near 'cause

Ooh, you were always in the back of my mind
Ooh, you were always in the back of my mind

Oh, I have all the memories
The winter of '82
When down upon the ice you saw me melt
Washed up on the rocks again
Oh it's 2 a.m. raining again
I saw you making faces in the river
Only me, down by the quay
Just a sad reflection that I give you
You might also like
Ooh, you were always in the back of my mind
Ooh, you were always in the back of my mind

Washed up on the rocks again
Oh, don't you know that it's so damn hot
And the things you do
Oh I won't ever learn
Ooh I won't ever learn


Washed up on the rocks again
Oh, don't you know that it's so damn hot
And the things you do
I won't ever learn
I won't ever learn
I won't ever learn

Ooh, you were always in the back of my mind
Ooh, you were always in the back of my mind
Ooh, you were always in the back of my mind
Ooh, you were always in the back of my mind
In the back of my mind
In the back of my mind
