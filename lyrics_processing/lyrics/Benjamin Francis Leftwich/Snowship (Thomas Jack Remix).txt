But the treasures buried beneath years and years of time
He put his hand in my hand and he told me, "Son
When they all come looking for you, where you gonna run?
Your heart's wired up to the eyes in your head and they're flashing bright"
I was only looking for the treasure in the dark
Not the tree's and people in the middle of the park
But the treasures buried beneath years and years of time

Your heart's wired up to the eyes in your head and they're flashing bright"

I signed a deal with the devil and he took my soul
To a room with a table in the dark and cold
