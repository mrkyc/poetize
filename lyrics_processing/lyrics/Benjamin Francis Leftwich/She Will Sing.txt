Couldn't be saved by no other one but you
Could you never make it out of the lie we were living through
And you sing
And free with desire
Then we are heading home
As the sun is rising

Sing to me, I feel I'm feeling nothing at all
Tell me where you're hiding
Tell me what you're crying for
Sing to me, I know you're feeling cold after all
You're looking for a way out
You could be the open door

It takes a little time to believe it
Whatever it is you've found
But I believe all I see when you're singing to me now
They say the time is a feeling
They say there's a sound
'Cause I believe you're free when you're singing to me now
Tell me where you're hiding
You might also like
It comes to me now like a bird flying out in the pouring rain
Can only hope you never change, at all
When you sing
You're taking me higher
To another place
Where we rise above the choir

Sing to me, I feel I'm feeling nothing at all
Tell me where you're hiding
Tell me what you're crying for
Sing to me, I know you're feeling cold after all
You're looking for a way out
You could be the open door

It takes a little time to believe it
Whatever it is you've found
But I believe all I see when you're singing to me now
They say the time is a feeling
They say there's a sound
Cause I believe we're free when you're singing to me now
Tell me where you're hiding
It takes a little time to believe it
(Sing to me)
Whatever it is you've found
(Tell me where you're hiding)
But I believe all I see when you're singing to me now
(Tell me where you're hiding)
They say the time is a feeling
I say there's a sound
'Cause I believe we're free when you're singing to me now
