(Yes you can, yes you can, oh yes you can)
(Yes you can, yes you can, oh yes you can)

They thought that I'd be weak (but you made me strong)
They thought that I would crawl down (but they were so wrong)
You held my hand and (encouraged me to stand)
When they said I couldn't do it I heard you say (you said yes you can)
They thought that I'd be weak (but you made me strong)
You say they thought that I would crawl down (but they were so wrong)
You held my hand (encouraged me to stand)
And when they said I couldn't do it I heard you say (you said yes you can)
I overcame that (cause you said yes you can)
And everyday I'm feeling stronger (cause you said yes you can)
I'm no longer doubting (cause you said yes you can)
Now here's my time to tell somebody (Cause God said yes you can)

Sing it with me (yes you can, yes you can, oh yes you can)
(Yes you can, yes you can, oh yes you can)

Said and won't believe (cause then they walked)
And out of everyone I lost (you were the one to stay)
But you held my hand (encouraged me to stand)
And when they said I couldn't do it I heard you say (you said yes you can)
See I overcame that (cause you said yes you can)
And everyday I'm getting stronger (cause you said yes you can)
I'm no longer doubting (cause you said yes you can)
Now it's my time to tell somebody (God says yes you can)
