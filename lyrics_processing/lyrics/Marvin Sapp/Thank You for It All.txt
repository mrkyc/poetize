The good, bad, the ugly, great and small
The times of victory and when I fall
I'm so grateful that I'm still standing tall
I thank You for my tears
The pain helped me overcome my fears

It's a miracle that I'm still standing here

All that I am is because
Of all that You brought me through
And everything I survived
It's all because of You
