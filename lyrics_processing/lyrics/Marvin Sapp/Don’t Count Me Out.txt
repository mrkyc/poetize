But never forgotten
Misunderstood
But my future is just starting
God is molding me and shaping me
He's building me and making me
A king is being formed
Right in front of your eyes
So don't count me out
When you don't see what He sees
You can't tell but His glory
Is resting on me
I'm His choice
After his heart
The unveiling is starting now
So don't count me out
Left alone
But never forgotten
Misunderstood
But my future is just starting
God is molding me and making me
He's building me and shaping me
A king is being born
Right in front of your eyes
