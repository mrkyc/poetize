People infatuated with their own thing
Some self-proclaim they're the GOAT
History provides that my God's the one
No losses, He's won the most

Resist temptation like mine
You've proven Your power and showed us the way
So we could win every time

Undefeated champion
Be seated on Your throne
Ruler, redeemer
Savior of the world
(Undefeated) Undefeated (Champion)
