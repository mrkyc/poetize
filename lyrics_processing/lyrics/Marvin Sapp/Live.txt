I see you smiling
Life is tearing you apart
Looking good on the outside
I can feel your heart
You feel helpless and hopeless
Isolated and confused
You feel like life has no purpose
So let these words encourage you

You shall live, and not die
Though you've been hurting  for sometime
By faith , you shall live  and not die
Though you have been hurting for sometime
By faith, you shall live

I see you standing there
With a towel in your hands
Getting ready to throw it in
Like no one really understands
They don't, don't understand
Here is what you must remember, yes
That you are in this for a reason
Don't give up, just keep the faith
Soon you will be walking in your season
You might also like
You shall live, and not die
Though you've been hurting  for sometime
By faith , you shall live  and not die
Though you have been hurting for sometime
By faith, you shall live

Just remember, just remember
He will never put more on you than you than you can bear
It may be hard right now, just know that He cares
You shall live
(I commend you to live)
Live
(It's your only option, yes it is)
Live
By faith you shall live
(You're gonna live through the hurt and the pain)
Live
(You're gonna live through the heartache and shame)
Live
By faith you shall live

Listen, listen, listen
I know you feel like giving up right now
'Cause you don't know which way to go
But I stopped by here to tell you
Just for a little while
You could always go to the Lord
By faith you shall live, live, live
By faith you shall...
You shall live and not die
Though you've been hurting  for sometime
