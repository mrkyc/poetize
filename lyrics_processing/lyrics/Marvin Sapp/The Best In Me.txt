When everyone else around
Could only see the worst in me
Can I tell y'all one more time? One more time?
I said he saw the best in me
When everyone else around me
Could only see the worst in me
I wish I had a witness tonight, all I need is one
He saw the best in me
When everyone else around me
Could only see the worst in me
Does anybody have their testimony?
When folks wrote you off
Said you would never make it
What did he see?
He saw the best in me
When everyone else around me
When everyone else around could only see the worst in me
Can I tell you all one more thing?
I just need to tell you one more thing, listen to this
See, he's mine, and I am his
It doesn't matter what I did
He only sees me for who I am
Does anyone know that tonight?

Can I ask ya'll one question?
The question is simply this
What did he see?
(He saw the best)
I can't get no help up in here
Because there's some folk in here that people have wrote you off
Said you would never amount to anything
Said that you would never end up being anywhere
But Myron, tell 'em one more time, what did he see?
He saw the best
When momma said you would never be nothin'
When aunties and uncles said you would never amount to anything
When daddy didn't come home anymore
He didn't look at you and say that you weren't going to make it
God looked at you and what did he see, what did he see?
He saw the best, the best
What did he see?
(The best)
I said, what did he see?
