This is not your place where you should be
Not the time or the place to (?lie in envy?)
You got to hold on you got be strong
This is not not the time to question your faith
This is not your place of destiny
It's not the time or the place to throw in the towel
You gotta hold on you you gotta be strong
Sometimes you win Sometimes you lose
It's apart of life that everyone goes through
Sometimes there's joy sometimes there's pain
That's apart of God's plan it is His own plan
Chorus:(2xs)
This is not the time(not the time not the place)
Just believe in the faith
Gotta learn how to wait
There's still hope for the hopeless(there's still hope for the hopeless)
There's still life for the lifeless(there's still life for the lifeless)
God is a friend to the friendless(He's a friend to the friendless)
He'll give you peace and sweetness(He'll give you peace and sweetness)
There's help for the helpless(there's help for the helpless)
There is a home if you're homeless(there is a home for the homeless)
He will mend your broken pieces(He can mend your broken pieces)
Cause you to live and be blessed(cause you to live and be blessed)
