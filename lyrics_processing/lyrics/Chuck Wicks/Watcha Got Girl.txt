So what you got, what you got going on tonight?
I can be there in 5
I'll pick you up for a little ride
We can jump in the truck, slide over close
Turn it on up, ready to roll
We can kill us some cans, girl, kill us some time
We ain't smoking but we'll sure be high
So what you think about going out like that?
Get a little later on full moon laid back
Sip sippin' on something strong
Keep the buzz going all night long?
Get a good song on the radio
Maybe a throwback mixtape slow jam I don't know
I gotta wrong way baby are you ready to fly
So watcha got, watcha got going on tonight
Watcha got going on tonight
Why you there sitting at home?
Talking and texting on your pretty pink phone
But you ain't gotta be alone
Cause girl I'm already ready to go
Come on
