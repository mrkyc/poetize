Girl you got me going
Yea I think you know it
Oh I'm ready for this ride
So come on take my hand
Cuz only you, you understand
How to kick this feeling into

Drive all night with me
Sing my favorite song and sleep
Under the stars on the hood of our car
It's all I've ever wanted
All I ever wanted was to
See you in the pale moon light
Just the way ya look tonight
And maybe some day
If love comes our way
We'll be walking in the meadow in the early spring
You'll be twirling in a sundress wearing my ring
Can you see it
Girl I believe em that
It's true
All I ever wanted
All I ever really wanted was you
You might also like
If life is what you make it
Here's my chance ill take it
You know I wanna make you mine
I have this picture in my mind
You were in it all the time
So baby hold on tight

And drive all night with me
Sing my favorite song and sleep
Under the stars on the hood of our car
It's all I've ever wanted
All I ever wanted was to
See you in the pale moon light
Just the way ya look tonight
And maybe some day
If love comes our way
We'll be walking in the meadow in the early spring
You'll be twirling in a sundress wearing my ring
Can you see it
Girl I believe em that
It's true
All I ever wanted
All I ever really wanted was you
All I ever wanted
Was to see you in the pale moon light
Just the way ya look tonight
And maybe some day
If love comes our way
We'll be walking in the meadow in the early spring
You'll be twirling in a sundress wearing my ring
Can you see it
Girl I believe em that
It's true
All I ever wanted
