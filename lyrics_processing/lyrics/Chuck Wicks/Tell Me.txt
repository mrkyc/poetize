No turning back now, turning back now

Did I leave a mark on your mind?
Just tell me, should I be coming over?

Down a road and where we don't look back
Name anything you're looking for and I'll just give you more
If you want we can get away
Feel the sunshine on our face
When we get there we'll never leave
