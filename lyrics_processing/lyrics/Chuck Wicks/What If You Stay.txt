And I can't take back what I did
I wouldn't blame you if you hated me
Before you slam that open door
And throw away four good years
Think of everything we used to be
I know you say that you're over me
But I'm askin you, beggin you not to leave
What if I told you I've changed
Would you still walk away
What if I told you I loved you
Would you say that it's too late
What if you could feel what I feel
When I watch you slowly drift away
What if you're wrong
What if I'm right
That you could move on
What if you stay
I know right now it's hard to breathe
Hard to think and hard to see
All the reasons we should work it out
It might be easier to go
But if you walk out, you'll never know
How strong we could be at the end of this
I know that sorry is not enough
But I'll do everything, anything to make it up

Would you still walk away
What if I told you I loved you
Would you say that it's too late
What if you could feel what I feel
When I watch you slowly drift away
What if you're wrong
What if I'm right
That you could move on
What if you stay
What if I told you I've changed
Would you still walk away
What if I told you I loved you
Would you say that it's too late
What if you could feel what I feel
When I watch you slowly drift away
What if you're wrong
What if I'm right
You could move on
What if you stay
Oooooo
I can't make you turn around
