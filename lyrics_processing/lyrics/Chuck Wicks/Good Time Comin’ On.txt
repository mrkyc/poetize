Oh, but it ain't easy
With you paintin your toes
With your feet up on the dash
Your legs so long and tan
You're my dixon girl with a summer smile
Oh just enough sweet, but just enough wild
Oh it's just that kind of day
Everything's goin our way
We've got the sunshine
Cooler's in the back
All day and all night
Let's see where this might go
We can drive real fast
Girl, while we take it slow
We've got the warm breeze
Blowing off the coast
One hand on your knee
Yea we're getting close
I feel a good time
I feel a good time comin' on
I've got a sleeping bag thrown in the back
Oh, just in case it comes to that
With any luck this might end
At a camp fire down by the river bend
You might also likeWe've got the sunshine
Cooler's in the back
All day and all night
Let's see where this might go
We can drive real fast
Girl, while we take it slow
We've got the warm breeze
Blowing off the coast
One hand on your knee
Yea we're getting close
I feel a good time
I feel a good time comin' on
Strong as anything could be
How could this be wrong girl
When we both agree
We've got the sunshine
All day and all night
We've got the sunshine
Cooler's in the back
All day and all night
Let's see where this might go
We can drive real fast
Girl, while we take it slow
We've got the warm breeze
Blowing off the coast
One hand on your knee
Yea we're getting close
I feel a good time
I feel a good time comin' on
I feel a good time
I feel a good time
Cool coming on
