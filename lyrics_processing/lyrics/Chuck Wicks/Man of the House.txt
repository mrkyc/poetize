Rolls outta bed with sleepy eyes
Goes to his sister's room across the hall
"Hey, Daisy
Rise and shine"
He pours two bowls full of Captain Crunch
Puts a fresh pot of coffee on
He wakes his momma up off the couch
"The bus is here
We love you mom"
He made the breakfast
He did the dishes
So she wouldn't have to
Oh he's only ten
Just comin' of age
He oughta be out playin' ball and video games
Climbing trees or on a bike
Just riding around
But it's hard to be a kid
When you're the man of the house
It's late at night
And Larry King is on
Momma's up on the couch again
Bobby hears them all talk about
That awful war his daddy's in
You might also likeSo he runs off
Straight up to his room
Don't want his momma to see him right now
He climbs in bed and says a silent prayer
Then he cries his little blue eyes out
Don't wanna let her down
Oh, he's only ten
Just comin' of age
He oughta be out playin' ball and video games
Climbing trees or on a bike
Just ridin' around
But it's hard to be a kid
When you're the man of the house
It's finally Saturday
Bobby gets a phone call
Another world away from home
He says, "I love you, Dad"
Daddy says it right back
"Wish I could reach through this phone
And hug you and Daisy
And your mom
I'm so proud of you, son."
He's only ten
Just comin' of age
He oughta to be out playing ball and video games
Climbing trees or on a bike
Just riding around
But it's hard to be a kid
When you're the man of the house
It's 6:00 A.M
And Bobby's waking up
