Do anything to go there
To take my breath away again
I still see your face right there
Staring at me and I swear
I can feel you here
When I close my eyes
I know I should drop everything
And run straight back to your side
Maybe I should take a bus ride
Maybe I should put this car in drive
And go find the love that we both used to know
Maybe I can find the one way
Maybe you'll forgive me someday
No red lights stopping me
Nothing gonna slow me down
Starting now
Every step, every turn that I take
Every thought, every move that I make
Brings me closer to you
If the day is done and I haven't found you
I'll take my love and turn around
Go down another road and try again
Yea, try again

Maybe you'll forgive me someday
No red lights stopping me

Starting now
I'm gonna find a new way to love you
I'm gonna find the one way to hold you
Cuz I just can't stay
Sitting around
Waitin on love to come back around
Back around
Maybe I should take a bus ride
Maybe I should put this car in drive
And go find the love that we both used to know
Maybe I can find the one way
Maybe you'll forgive me someday
No red lights stopping me
Nothing gonna slow me down
Yea, no red lights stopping me
Never gonna slow me down
