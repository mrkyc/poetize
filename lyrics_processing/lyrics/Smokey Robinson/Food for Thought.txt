Hey, tobacco man
Tell me if you can
How much money would you make off that cigarette?
If your only son should partake
And then proceed to get
TB or cancer, I got to know the answer

Industrial tycoon
You must see pretty soon
If you don't stop pouring that poison waste
Down into the water
Might not be any left to taste
Think of your thirsty daughter
You'd sure sound funny
Saying, "Come on, honey, let's try to drink this money"

Well, I'm not trying to tell you what to do
But he who spins the web sometimes gets caught
I'm not trying to fill you full of bull
I'm just feeding you some food for thought

(Food for thought)
A little food for thought (Food for thought)
Yes, I am (Food for thought)

Hey, man on the run
Out there having fun
Trying to gander all the gooses
Stallion all the mares
At home, she's immune to your excuses
For not being there

Somebody there when you're not

Well, I'm not trying to tell you what to do

A little food for thought (Food for thought)
You better listen, people (Food for thought)
A little food for thought (Food for thought)
Trying to tell you (I'm just feeding you some food for thought)
Trying to tell you

Well, mother who's a wife
Don't misuse your life
Makin', takin' care of babies
All you ever do
You got to fill daddy's needs
'Cause he's your baby too
Your attention slipping
Will make daddy start tipping
Out, that is
Well, I'm not trying to tell you what to do
But he who spins the web sometimes gets caught
Oh, I'm not trying to fill you full of bull
I'm just feeding you some food for thought

(Food for thought)
A little food for thought (Food for thought)
You better listen, people (Food for thought)
A little food for thought (Food for thought)

Trying to tell you (I'm just feeding you some food for thought)

Listen, people (Food for thought)
Food for thought (Food for thought)
Listen, people (I'm just feeding you some food for thought)
Trying to tell you

A little food for thought (I'm just feeding you some food)
