Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh

Holly made the rules
She laid down all the laws
Then broke the ones she made
Most folks would be afraid
To play the games that Holly played
When she was seventeen
She ran away from home
As fast as she could run
Said home was just no fun
There was an awful lot of doing to be done

Holly on a cloud in the sky
Way above the crowd flying high, ooh
Holly on a cloud in the sky, yeah
Way above the crowd flying high

Holly made the scene
She's gone to every place
She never should have been
Oh, but she was hanging in
Couldn't tell her nothing then, no
Strangers in the night (Strangers in the night)
Have paid a handsome price
To sleep in Holly's bed
She couldn't see that far ahead
To know that she would become
One of the living dead
(One of the living, one of the living dead)

Holly on a cloud in the sky, ooh
Way above the crowd flying high, ooh
Ooh, Holly

Holly was confused
She did some things that even she could not explain
Oh, but now she's so in pain
The devil running through her veins

Holly on a cloud in the sky, ooh-ooh
Way above the crowd flying high

How could Holly make such a great mistake?
To think that she could beat the rap in just one fling
It never happened

Holly on a cloud in the sky, ooh, Holly
Way above the crowd flying high, ooh, Holly
Holly on a cloud in the sky
Her life is passing by
Way above the crowd flying high (Yeah)
Her life is passing by
Holly on a cloud in the sky, ooh
