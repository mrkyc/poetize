This song is dedicated to some people
With whom I had the pleasure of spending
Over half the years I've lived 'til now
When we've come to our fork in the road
And though our feet may travel
A different path from now on
I want them to know how I feel about them
And that I wish them well

Sweet harmony
Go on and and blow on
Stay in perfect tune
Through your unfamiliar song
Make the world aware
That you're still goin' strong
Go on, spread your joy around the world
Spread your joy around the world

Sweet harmony, yeah, yeah
Go on and blow on
I believe in miracles
If you can dream it, it can be done
And though a task was made for two
It can be done well by one
Go on, spread your joy around the world
Spread your joy around the world, ooh

Sweet harmony, ooh
Spread your joy around the world, ooh
Sweet harmony, go on
Spread your joy around the world, oh
Sweet harmony, oh

Sweet harmony, go on and blow
You were the prelude for the song
The village minstrels play
Though most of them have come and gone
You're still around today
Go on, spread your joy around the world
Harmony, huh, spread your joy around the world

Keep on, sweet harmony, ooh, yeah
Go on and blow, now, now
Sweet harmony, ooh
To every heart and soul
You know the joy you bring
When you do your thing
Sweet harmony, yeah
Go on and roam my heart, 'cause you know how
Don't stop now, no
Sweet harmony, harmony
Spread your joy around the world, ooh, yeah
Sweet harmony, do it
Do it, do it, do it
