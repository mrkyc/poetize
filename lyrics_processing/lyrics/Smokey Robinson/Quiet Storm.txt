Soft and warm, a quiet storm
Quiet as when flowers talk at break of dawn
Break of dawn
A power source of tender force
Generating, radiating, turn me on
Turn them on

Ah, you short-circuit all my nerves
Promising electric things
You touch me and
Suddenly there's rainbow rings

Quiet storm
Blowin' through my life
Oh, quiet storm
Blowin' through my life
Oh, blow, baby

Oh, windy sigh, weaken my
Butterfly caught up in a hurricane (Hurricane)
Hurricane (Hurricane)
Lucky me, umbrella-free
Suddenly I'm caught up in your somber rain (Rain)
Oh, oh
