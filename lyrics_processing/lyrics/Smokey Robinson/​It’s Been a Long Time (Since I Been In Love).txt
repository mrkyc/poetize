Thought I forgot what to do
It's been a long time since I been in love
All it took was being with you
You are a simple and beautiful one
You taught me to love naturally
One look at you and I knew I was home
You gave myself back to me
Love how I feel, love how I feel
Love how I feel loving you
It's been a long time since I been in love
Wish I'd have known your address
It's been a long time since I been in love
Knowing you was called happiness, oh...
You are the sparkle that lights up my life
And makes everything seem so new
I'm all aglow with a halo of love
I know I'm shining for you
Love how I feel, love how I feel
Love how I feel loving you, oh...
