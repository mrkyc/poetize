Walking around in a daze
This feeling took so long to come
I'm never gonna be the same again, yeah
What happened to my common sense?
I thought that I at least had some
But love can make fools out of the wisest
And now I'm a man who recognizes

It's nothing like you hear on the radio
It's nothing like how you dream it at night
'Til you fall, until it happens to you
Oh no, no, no, you don't know what it's like
No, no

People say I'm acting strange
Like I'm in the twilight zone
It's got to be love that's got me out of my mind
I'm somewhere in total disconnection
'Cause I had a total misconception

It's nothing like you hear on the radio
It's nothing like how you dream it at night
'Til you fall, until it happens to you
Oh no, no, no, you don't know what it's like
It's nothing like in movies or magazines
Or those romantic novels they write
'Til you fall, until it happens to you
Oh no, no, no, you don't know what it's like

This love is not like my dreams
Or any fantasies I've had
It's taken me to both extremes
Sometimes it's better than good
Sometimes it's worse than bad
Ooh, oh, oh, oh, yeah

Oh, it's nothing like you hear on the radio
It's nothing like how you dream it at night
'Til you fall, until it happens to you
Oh no, no, no, you don't know what it's like
It's nothing like in movies or magazines
Or those romantic novels they write
'Til you fall, until it happens to you
Oh no, no, no, you don't know what it's like
Ooh...
It's nothing like you hear on the radio
It's nothing like how you dream it at night
'Til you fall, until it happens to you
