Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, yeah
Ooh, yeah

The first time I laid eyes on you I had an instant suspicion
To be with you would become my life's ambition
I knew right away from the very first day that somewhere down the line
I'd wake up to see you lying right next to me, you'd be mine, all mine, all mine

You're the one for me, baby, yeah, you're the one, baby
You're the one for me
Anyone can see, baby, yeah, you're the one, baby
You're the one for me

Opportunity comes knocking in the form of somebody new
But I don't answer 'cause the door to my heart is only open to you
Temptation comes 'round staring me down right in my face
But nobody could ever take your place, no one could fill your space

You're the one for me, baby, yeah, you're the one, baby
You're the one for me
Anyone can see, baby, yeah, you're the one, baby
You're the one for me
