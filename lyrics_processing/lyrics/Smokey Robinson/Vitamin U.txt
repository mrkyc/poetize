Since you went away from me
I've got a love deficiency

Tried vitamin A, and you went away
Vitamin B to bring you back to me
Vitamin C for all the nights I cried
Vitamin D to dry my eyes
I tried them all and now I see
The only one that's gonna work for me
Is vitamin U, girl
To see me through, girl, oh, yeah

Thought if I could find another lover
With some tender care, baby, I'd soon recover, hey
But like useless remedies
They can't satisfy my needs

Tried vitamin A, and you went away, baby
Vitamin B to bring you back to me
Vitamin C for all the nights I cried
Vitamin D to dry my eyes
I tried them all and now I see
The only one that's gonna work for me
Is Vitamin U, girl
To see me though, girl, ooh-ooh...

Tried vitamin A, and you went away, baby

Well, I tried Vitamin E, F and G
Vitamin H was no help for me
Vitamin I was hurting so
I tried Vitamin J, K, L, M, N and O
Vitamin P, Q, R, S, and T
Vitamin V, girl, and X, Y, Z
Only thing that they did for me
Was strengthen my eyes and help me see
I need Vitamin U, baby
