Mmm-hmm, well, well, well, well
Ooh-ooh-ooh, well, well

Put your arms around me, my sweet lover
Tell me things are gonna be all right
Sometimes I just need to hear
Your voice in the night
'Cause when you talk to me
I feel my troubles melt away
It doesn't what you say
Just as long as you can stay

Take me through the night
Tell me secrets by the firelight
And when you hold me, hold on tight
Come on, baby, take me through the night, oh...
(Come on, baby, take me through the night)

When the hours seem to last forever
And it seems the night will never end
That's the time I really know
That I've got a friend
'Cause even when is seems
The sun will never shine again
The world is not so dark and cold
As long as I got you to hold

So take me through the night
Tell me secrets by the firelight
And when you hold me, hold on tight
Come on, come on, baby
Take me through the night, ooh-wee...
(Come on, baby, take me through the night)
Yeah, come on, baby, take me through the night

Long as I near you, so I can hear you
Talking to me, it's would be so nice
Come sit beside me, I need you by me
So you can guide me through the night

Do, do, do, do, do, do, ooh...
(Take me through the night)
Oh, yeah, baby

Ooh, take me through the night
Tell me secrets by the firelight
And when you hold me, hold on tight
Come on, come on, baby
Take me through the night
Come on, come on
Well
Come on, come on, baby
Take me through the night, mama
Come on, you can do it right, baby
Oh, take me through the night, baby
Take me, take me, take me, take me
