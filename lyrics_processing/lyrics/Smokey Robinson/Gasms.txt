Eyegasms
When I look at you, it makes me feel better than good
And what I see is you and me together forever
I'm knockin' on wood

Every kind of gasm in the book
Each, I has 'em every time I take a look

You give me gasms
Eyegasms
You're the one responsible for my gasms
Gasm, gasm (Gasms, gasms)
Gasm, gasms (Gasms, gasms)
You give me gasms

Eargasms
When I hear your voice, my eardrums start to quiver
It's a sexy sound, makes my love come down, and I know
You can deliver

Any kind of gasm on the list
The gasms you don't give me, I don't think exist

Eargasms
Soft and sweet or the kind the neighbors hear, gasms
If I think about you right now, gon' give me gasms (Gasms, gasms)
Every little thought somehow gon' give me gasms (Gasms, gasms)

You give me those mind gasms
Those hard to find gasms
Gasm, gasms
Eyegasms
Eargasms
Just thinking 'bout you
Or when you're here, gasms
Every kind of gasm ever known
And a few I think are only mine alone

You give me gasms
Gasm, gasms
You give me gasm, gasms
Gasm
If I think about you right now, gon' give me gasms (Gasms, gasms)
Every little thought somehow gon' give me gasms
You give me those mind gasms
The kind you give me are the kind that are hard to find, gasms
Gasm, gasm (Gasms, gasms)
You give me those great gasms
When the morning's early
When the night is late, gasm
Gasms, gasm (Gasms, gasms)
You give me those real gasms
The kind that after you're gone, I still can feel, gasms
Gasm, gasm (Gasms, gasms)
You give me gasm, gasm
Ooh, yes, you give me gasm, gasms
