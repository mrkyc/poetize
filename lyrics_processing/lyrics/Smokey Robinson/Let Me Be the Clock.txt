Ooh, hoo, ooh
Ooh, ooh

Let me be the clock
For the time of your life, oh, yeah
Let me be the pendulum
That strikes your chime for the first time

I'm a cuckoo, I know
Counting hours till we will be together
When the door to my heart will open
It's for sure that I will be hoping
Hoping that you will

Let me be the clock
For the time of your life, oh, yeah, baby
Oh, yeah, babe
And let me be the pendulum
That strikes your chime for the first time
Let it begin
'Cause every moment we're apart
Is some good feeling wasted
A good feeling deep down inside me, told me
A good time for me to try to get you to hold me
Is right here and now
