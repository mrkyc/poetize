Baby, baby
Don't you know you drive me crazy
Oh, yeah, it's true, you do
Why don't you just let me love you
The way I want to
I just want to kiss and hug you
Oh, yeah, it's true, I do
Can't you see, it's you and me
Not them, not those, not they
But it's you and me, baby, yeah
You want to see my bad side
Just fussin' over nothin' and gettin' mad, well
Verbal stones hurt my love bones
Got me doin' things against my nature, yeah
Sometimes I think I overrate you
Child, honey, honey child
I just want to treat you right now, baby, yeah
Treat you good, you know I could if you let me, well
Well, well, baby, oh...
Ah...
I know with love comes from problems
But jumpin' up and down just ain't gonna solve 'em, no, no
Sometimes I want to leave you alone, baby
I don't dig no sadomasochism, no
It just throws my life all out of rhythm
