Wasting your time
Drinking that wine
Smoking that smoke
Doing that coke
Dealing that dope
Giving up hope
Gang bangin', gang bangin', gang bangin'

Staying out late
Preaching that hate
Defying your mother
Killing your brother
Killing in waves
Filling up graves
Gang bangin', gang bangin', gang bangin' (Oh yeah)

(You know that)
Bullets are flying
Babies are dying
A child at play
Got in the way
Innocent children
Somebody killed them
Gang bangin', gang bangin', gang bangin', gang bangin', gang bangin', gang bangin', gang bangin'
