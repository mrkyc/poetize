The whippoorwill whippoor-won't
The weeping willows laughing
Sunday is moonlight
All wrong is alright
And I don't love you
Lorelei is Laura Truth
The fallen leaves are rising
So low is so high
Hello is goodbye
And I don't love you
When positive is negative
And make-believe's the real thing, yeah
When bottoms up and everybody's
Walking on the ceiling, uh-huh
Still I doubt if even that
Could make me lose the feeling, yeah
Never lose the feeling
Oh, never lose the feeling
When morning comes in evening
And daily comes nightly, oh, baby
Or even if your love for me
Slackens up slightly, oh...
I doubt if I ever could
Take your love lightly, ooh...
I can never take your love lightly
Oh, take your love lightly
Lightly, lightly
Oh, take your lightly

Ooh, baby, ooh, baby, ooh-ooh-ooh...
Ooh, baby, ooh, baby, ooh, baby

Yeah
(Ah-ah-ah...)

What never was is here again, yeah
The past is in the future
Black and white rainbows
Colorful shadows
And I don't love you
When morning comes in evening
When morning comes in evening
When morning comes in evening
When morning comes in evening
When morning comes in evening
And daily comes nightly
Baby, ooh, oh, baby, ooh...
Or even if your love for me
Slackens up slightly
Don't start slacken up
Don't stop backing up
I doubt if I ever could
Take your love lightly
Never, never take your love lightly
Oh, take your love lightly
When positive is negative
And make-believe's the real thing
Baby, ooh, oh, baby, ooh...
When bottoms up and everybody's
Walking on the ceiling
Walking, talking, upside-down
Still I doubt if even that
Could make me lose the feeling, yeah
Never, never, never lose the feeling
Feels so good
(Never lose the feeling)
Feeling, feeling
I'll never lose the feeling
Never lose the feeling
Feels so good, baby
