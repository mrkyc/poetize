I am, I am

Lord, who will be with you
Every day, all the way, come what may?
Your story may go through
Thick and thin and back again
I'm gonna hang right in

I say, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am
Oh baby, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am
You can bet your life I am, yeah, yeah

Lord, who'll be standin' by
Prepared to take some heartache for your sake?
Can you dig that, baby?
What kind of fool am I?
When rising up, take 'em into your cup
When the going gets rough
Can you dig that, mama?

I say, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am
Ooh baby, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am
Oh, you can bet your life I am
And if the world don't like it
I don't give a damn

Lord, who will give you love?
And like a fire will rage through every stage
Of youth and age
Can you dig that, baby?
One of the lucky few
Realize a dream, though it may seem
A little too extreme
Can you dig that, mama?

I say, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am
Ooh baby, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am
Ah, you can bet your life I am
And if the world don't like it
I don't give a damn

I am, I am, I am
I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am
Ooh, ooh baby, I am, I am, I am, I am
Ah, nah, you can bet your life I am
And if the world don't like it
I don't give a damn
(I am, I am)
