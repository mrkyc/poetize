I'd like to slow down long enough
To call the girl I'm dreaming of
But too much highway's stretching out ahead
'Cause like the wind that's blowing free
There's something wild inside of me
That keeps me moving down the road instead

And I'm driving through life in the fast lane
(Another day chasing my dreams)
Fantasy and confusion, it's all an illusion
But the fire inside me is burning
(The wheels just keep on turning)
Searching for just what I can't explain
As long as there's a rainbow
And answers that I don't know
I'll be driving through life in the fast lane
Ooh-ooh-ooh...

It gets hard to read the signs
Or count the little yellow lines
That flash by like her picture in my mind
I've said so many sad goodbyes
I've quit asking myself why
Or if what's up ahead's as good
As what I've left behind

Fantasy and confusion, it's all an illusion
But the fire inside me is burning
(The wheels just keep on turning)
Searching for just what I can't explain
As long as there's a rainbow
And answers that I don't know
I'll be driving through life in the fast lane
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh...
I'm driving, driving

Yeah, I'm driving through life in the fast lane
(Another day chasing my dreams)
Fantasy and confusion, it's all an illusion
But the fire inside me is burning

Searching for just what I can't explain
As long as there's a rainbow
And there's answers that I don't know
I'll be driving through life in the fast
Driving through life in the fast lane
Another day chasing my dreams
Fantasy and confusion, it's all an illusion
But the fire inside me is burning
The wheels just keep on turning
Searching for just what I can't explain
As long as there's a rainbow
And answers that I don't know
I'll be driving through life in the fast
Driving through life in the fast lane
Another day chasing my dreams
