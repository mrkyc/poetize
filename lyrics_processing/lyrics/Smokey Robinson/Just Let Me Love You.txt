Just let me love you
Like nobody's loved you
Make you my queen
Make your heart sing
Over and over again

You've given up on true love
You say love's too unstable, yeah
You've seen the worst in mankind
But don't give me that label
I see the treasure in you
But your heart turned to stone
Give me the chance and you'll see
A world you never been shown
Girl, I know how it feels to let somebody in
Going through heartbreak again and again
But this time the hurting has come to an end
I'll keep love burning bright
Every day, every night

Just let me love you
Like nobody's loved you
Make you my queen
Make your heart sing
Over and over again

I don't expect you to trust
Take all the time you need
I've waited my whole life for you
I will follow your lead
If you'll just let me do all the things I can do
Nothing in life is more special than you
My darling, I promise this man will come through
I've got something to live for
To die for, to cry for

Just let me love you
Like nobody's loved you
Make you my queen
Make your heart sing
Over and over again

Now there are no guarantees in love
But if you just give me a chance
I can guarantee that I'll do my best
To make it the best it's ever been
For you, my love
If you'll just let me do all the things I can do
Nothing in life is more special than you
My darling, I promise this man will come through
I've got something to live for
To die for, to cry, cry, cry
(Cry for, cry for)

Just let me love you
Like nobody's loved you
You're a queen
I wanna make your heart sing
Over and over and over

Love you, love you
(Just let me love you)
Like nobody
(Like nobody's loved you)
Make you my queen
Make your heart sing
