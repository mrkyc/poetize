Take a look around
Now you know that farewell
Is a lonely sound
I'm the one you came home to
When you came home at all
And I'm the one who trusted you
But now I see you bring on your tears too late
And I don't wanna wait
'Til it falls apart again
So this will be the last time
That you cry your tears too late
As if your heart would break
But now I don't believe in you
I'm leaving you this time
You've really cried your tears too late
You never say you need me
Until I walk away
Now you're trying to tell me
That you're here to stay
I'm the one you cheated on
I fell for all your lies
And I'm the one you hit and run
You never change you bring on your tears too late
You might also likeAnd I don't wanna wait
'Til it falls apart again
So this will be the last time
That you cry your tears too late
As if your heart would break
But now I don't believe in you
I'm leaving you this time
You've really cried your tears too late
And I've heard it all before
I can't take it anymore
Now I've got to learn to live without you
You never change you bring on your tears too late
And I don't wanna wait
'Til it falls apart again
So this will be the last time
That you cry your tears too late
As if your heart would break
But now I don't believe in you
I'm leaving you this time
You've really cried your tears too late
And I don't wanna wait
'Til it falls apart again
So this will be the last time
That you cry your tears too late
As if your heart would break
But now I don't believe in you
