Miss what you?ve got till it's gone
But I found you and I wondered
How I got by on my own
Seemed like the star that I wished on
Was right there by my side
And I?ve been in pieces
Since the day you said goodbye, girl
Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me
Tell me where I went wrong
Show me, show me, show me, show me
How to be strong
?Cause all that I needed was someone like you
Now that you?re gone, what can I do?
Tell me, tell me
With the face of an angel
And a heart of gold
You were my shoulder to cry on
My flesh and blood, Venus to hold
But something was wrong with this picture
Wish that I?d seen it too
?Cause my dream was over
When I woke up without you, girl
You might also likeTell me, tell me, tell me, tell me
Tell me where I went wrong
Show me, show me, show me, show me
How to be strong
?Cause all that I needed
Was someone like you
Someone I thought I really knew
Tell me, tell me
Was it my imagination?
Was my head up in the clouds?
I can?t believe you?d build me up
Just to tear me down
But you left no explanation
And I just can?t work it out
Why say time was on our side
When time was running out?
You?ve got to tell me, tell me
Baby, I?ve been in pieces
Since the day you said goodbye, girl
Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me, baby
Tell me where I went wrong
Show me, show me, show me, show me
How to be strong
?Cause all that I needed was someone like you
Now that you?re gone, what can I do?
Tell me, tell me, got to tell me, tell me
Tell me, baby, how to be strong
Show me, show me, show me, show me
You got to tell me, tell me
Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me
Now you tell me time was on our side
Show me, show me, show me, show me
Tell me, tell me
Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me
Baby I don't know, well
Show me, show me, show me, show me
Tell me, tell me
