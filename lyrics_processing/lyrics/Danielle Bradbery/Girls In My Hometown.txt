When I turn on the news
When I drive by a church
When I flip through a country station
When I see cool kids in a parkin' lot
Livin' up to their reputation
When I'm three drinks in
And some guy's hittin' on a blonde three stools down
When the talk gets cheap
I cannot think about the girls in my hometown

Are they gettin' married?
Are they gettin' jaded?
When they think seventeen
Do they think of me and wonder if I made it?
Are they really happy?
Are they makin' Daddy proud?
What makes 'em cry? What gets 'em high?
I think about the girls in my hometown

When I see a denim jacket
When I hear a kid say a dirty word
When my faith's runnin' low
And me and God ain't on the best of terms
When I'm out with someone and we lose our buzz
And the conversation dies out
I go home by myself
And I cannot think about the girls in my hometown

What makes 'em cry? What gets 'em high?
I think about the girls in my hometown

When I hear the song "Strawberrry Wine"
I think about all of the fences, all painted white
I think about falling in love, the meaning of life
I think about the girls in my hometown

Are they gettin' married?
Are they gettin' jaded?
Am I bright in their mind like it's summertime
Or just a little faded?
Are they really happy?
Are they makin' Daddy proud?
In the back of my mind, did they get it right?
I think about the girls in my hometown
What makes 'em cry? What gets 'em high?
I think about the girls in my hometown
