And never see the seven wonders that'll be alright
If I don't make it to the big leagues
If I never win a Grammy, I'm gonna be just fine
'Cuz I know exactly who I am
I am Rosemary's grand daughter the spitting image of my father
And when the day is done
My momma's still my biggest fan, sometimes I'm clueless
And I'm clumsy but I've got friends that love me
And they know just where I stand
It's all a part of me and that's who I am
So when I make a big mistake
When I fall flat on my face, I know I'll be alright
Should my tender heart be broken
I will cry those teardrops knowing
I will be just fine, 'cuz nothing changes who I am
I am Rosemary's grand daughter the spitting image of my father
And when the day is done
My momma's still my biggest fan, sometimes I'm clueless
And I'm clumsy but I've got friends that love me
And they know just where I stand
It's all a part of me and that's who I am
I'm a saint and I'm a sinner
I'm a loser I'm a winner
I'm steady and I'm stable
I am young but I am able
I am Rosemary's grand daughter the spitting image of my father
And when the day is done
My momma's still my biggest fan, sometimes I'm clueless
And I'm clumsy but I've got friends that love me
And they know just where I stand
It's all a part of me and that's who I am
I am Rosemary's grand daughter the spitting image of my father
And when the day is done
My momma's still my biggest fan, sometimes I'm clueless
And I'm clumsy but I've got friends that love me
And they know just where I stand
It's all a part of me and that's who I am
That's who I am
