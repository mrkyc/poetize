My-y-y hands are shaking
My-y-y heart is racing
Don't know what I-I-I-I-I am thinking
I'm freaking

Loving you is like drinking red wine on a white couch
So stupid like I'm shaving with the lights out
Boy, you're making me so nervous, yeah, you're perfect
I'm the smart girl, oh, I don't even know how
You got me walking on a tight rope with stilettos
Counting all my money in the wind blow
Boy, you're making me so nervous, is it worth it?
Yeah, I gotta be careful loving you now
'Cause you're like drinking red wine, red wine on a white couch

My heart don't understand it
Baby, you could do permanent damage
(Permanent damage, no, no, no, no)
And I could end up standing in a blue dress in a mess
All in a panic, screaming, "Damn it"

Loving you is like drinking red wine on a white couch

I'm the smart girl, oh, I don't even know how
You got me walking on a tight rope with stilettos (I'm a smart girl)
Counting all my money in the wind blow (I'm a smart girl, oh)
Boy, you're making me so nervous, is it worth it?
Yeah, I gotta be careful loving you now
'Cause you're like drinking red wine, red wine on a white couch

Ooh, hey, hey, yeah
