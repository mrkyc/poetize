I'm not talking smack, you know there's no pity, pity
Tryna put in words that you understand
You don't call her back, you think it's no biggie, biggie
Seconds on the clock, you need a touch down

Thought you had a shot, you were good to go
There's never three strikes in love, you know
When she gets mad, it ain't gon' be pretty, pretty
Won't see it coming, it's like a curve ball

You think you're doing just fine
But ooh, she got you on the sideline
You think you're flying towards the endzone
You're just headed towards the friend zone

Let me break it down to the facts
You will never get a girl like that
You gotta step up to the plate with a bat
That's all I gotta say about that

Yeah, you gotta take her out, spend a little money, money
Show her she's worth more than 3.99
No room for doubt, I'm not being funny, honey
Tell her how you feel, she can't read your mind

Thought you had it on lock, you were good to go
But there's never three strikes in love, we know
I'mma help a brother out, it ain't gon' be sunny, sunny
You commit the crime, you're gonna do time

You think you're doing just fine
But ooh, she got you on the sideline
You think you're flying towards the in-zone
You're just headed towards the friend zone

Let me break it down to the facts (just a facts)
You will never get a girl like that (uh, uh)
You gotta step up to the plate with a bat
That's all I gotta say about that

Oh, I need the bass and the beat and my banjo
Bass and the beat and my banjo
Bass and the beat and my banjo
Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah
Let me break it down to the facts
You will never get a girl like that
You gotta step up to the plate with a bat
That's all I gotta say about that
Let me break it down to the facts (to the facts)
You will never get a girl like that
You gotta step up to the plate with a bat
That's all I gotta say about that
