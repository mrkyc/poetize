Since when do I care
What other people say
Or if they even talk 'bout me at all?
Since when am I scared
To fail before I try?
It's like I'd rather quit than risk a fall

I used to be brave
Barefoot in a field, just runnin'
I've been thinkin' these days
Little me was on to something

No one could put out my fire
Damn, I was freer and wilder
Talking to myself, yeah, I was kinder
Never looked down walkin' on a wire
They say with age, you learn so much
You figure it out when you grow up
Looking back now, I think they were liars
I swear I was younger and wiser

My heart could just love
Before somebody broke it
I could daydream and really believe it would happen
You might also like
I used to be brave
I'd step right up and slay my dragons
I've been missin' those days
I want that feelin' back from back when

No one could put out my fire
Damn, I was freer and wilder
Talking to myself, yeah, I was kinder
Never looked down walkin' on a wire
They say with age, you learn so much
You figure it out when you grow up
Looking back now, I think they were liars
I swear I was younger and wiser

Younger and wiser
Younger and wiser
I was younger and wiser
Younger and wiser
Younger and wiser
Oh my God, I miss
When ignorance was bliss

'Cause no one could put out my fire
Damn, I was freer and wilder
Talking to myself, yeah, I was kinder
Never looked down walkin' on a wire
They say with age, you learn so much
You figure it out when you grow up
Looking back now, I think they were liars
I swear I was younger and wiser
Younger and wiser (Oh)
Younger and wiser
I was younger and wiser
Younger and wiser
Younger and wiser
