If I were a cowboy I wouldn't be like
The kinda cowboy staying out all night
I wouldn't roll off like a tumbleweed
Sipping too much from my spiked canteen
I'd knock the dust off my boots
And I'd hang my hat to stay
Before the sun comes up
I wouldn't be saddling up
And riding away

Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I would not gonna leave him
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
All alone in a ghost town
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
'Cause I know that kinda feeling
There's a heartbreak when the sun goes down

There's enough of them riding around
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
There's enough of them riding around
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

If I were be a cowboy I'd be legit
I'd shoot it right from the hip
I'd be the salt of the earth
Underneath all the dirt
'Cause I've been on the upside
I've been fading off into a blue sky
With the rain fall into my eyes and
Waking up without a goodbye

Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I would not gonna leave him
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
All alone in a ghost town
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
'Cause I know that kinda feeling
There's a heartbreak when the sun goes down

There's enough of them riding around
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
There's enough of them riding around
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
