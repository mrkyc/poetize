Let's crank up the truck, kick up some dust
Leave it all behind, just me and you, baby
Don't look back, stomp on the gas
Tear off the rearview, let's go crazy

Maybe Tennessee
LA, NYC
Mississippi
Come on, come on

Whoa-oh, oh, oh, ready, set, go
Gotta get out of this small town
Whoa-oh, oh, oh, the open road
Air to breathe, the sun is shining down
Oh whoa, it's you and me
In the land of the free
So baby, let's run
While we're young in America
(Young in America, young in America, young in America)

We could do the Vegas thing, you could buy me a ring
Make a lot of love and a little bit of money
Go dancing in rain with the guitars playing
Down there in Memphis, how about it, honey?
You might also like
Fine wine, sand, bare feet
Kiss me on the beach
So much to see
Come on, come on

Whoa-oh, oh, oh, ready, set, go
Gotta get out of this small town
Whoa-oh, oh, oh, the open road
Air to breathe, the sun is shining down
Oh whoa, it's you and me
In the land of the free
So baby, let's run
While we're young in America

I'll go anywhere, it's true
As long as I'm with you, yeah

Whoa-oh, oh, oh, ready, set, go
Gotta get out of this small town
Whoa-oh, oh, oh, the open road
Air to breathe, the sun is shining down
Oh, whoa, it's you and me
In the land of the free
So baby, let's run while we're young in
Young in America
(Young in America, young in America, young in America)
Young in America
(Young in America, young in America, young in America)
Whoa oh, whoa oh
(Young in America) Young in America
(Young in America, young in America, young in America)
