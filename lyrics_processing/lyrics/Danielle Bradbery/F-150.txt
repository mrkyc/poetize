I can drive by your street and not feel a thing
Play all of those songs you used to play me
Get drunk with my friends and not think to call
Could think of you a little, but I don't think of you at all
I've been growin' up, gettin' strong, movin' on

Then I see an F-150
And all the memories of you just hit me
You're drivin' right through my mind
And every time I think I'm fine
I see the headlights of an F-150

I can make out with a boy I just met tonight
And not feel guilty, not drunk cry
I can sip whiskey straight, not think of your name
Be in any bar and not look for your face
I've been doin' better than okay, yeah

But then I see an F-150
And all the memories of you just hit me
You're drivin' right through my mind
And every time I think I'm fine
I see the headlights of an F-150
But it's not even your F-150
You might also like
It's the drive-ins, the late nights, the tailgates, and the bonfires
Slowin' down, growin' up, makin' love, it all sneaks back up
Maybe soon it won't sneak back up

When I see an F-150
And all the memories of you won't hit me
You'll be movin' on with your life and I'll be movin' on with mine
And I'll be fine
When I see an F-150
And all the memories of you won't hit me
You'll be movin' on with your life and I'll be movin' on with mine
I'll be actually fine
When I see an F-150

I don't even notice all those F-150's
I've been making myself new memories
At the drive-ins, the late nights, the tailgates, and the bonfires
I'll be slowing down, growing up, making love
But it won't be us, no

When I see an F-150
