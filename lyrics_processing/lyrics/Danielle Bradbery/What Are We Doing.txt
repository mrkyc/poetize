We're good, we're bad, we cuss, we laugh
We can, we won't, we do, we don't
We dance, we stop, we're high, we drive
We're fire, we're ice, we're day, we're night
You call my phone, then you give me the cold shoulder
And then you won't leave me alone

So what are we doing? Oh-oh
What are we doing? Oh-oh
'Cause it feels like we're losing, oh-oh
So what are we doing? Oh-oh, oh, oh, oh
I ain't been sleepin', been thinkin' instead
Why I keep kickin' you out of my bed
So what are we doing? (What are we doing?)
What are we doing?

You kiss me, you hold me, you tell me that you want me
You put your arms around my waist, then you flaunt me
You call me "baby," then we're fighting, you hate me
And I hate you and it hurts me that I hate you

So what are we doing? Oh-oh
What are we doing? Oh-oh (What are we doing?)
'Cause it feels like we're losing, oh-oh (Losing)
So what are we doing? Oh-oh, oh, oh, oh
I ain't been sleeping, been thinking instead
Why I keep kicking you out of my bed
So what are we doing? (What are we doing?)
What are we doing?

Tell me what we're doing
What are we doing? Hey, hey, hey
Ah, ah, ah
Tell me what we're doing, ah

You call my phone, then you give me the cold shoulder
And then you won't leave me alone

So what are we doing? Oh-oh (Yeah)
What are we doing? Oh-oh
'Cause it feels like we're losing, Oh-oh (Losing, baby)
So what are we doing? Oh-oh, oh, oh, oh (What are we doing?)
I ain't been sleeping, been thinking instead (Thinking instead)
Why I keep kicking you out of my bed (Babe)
So what are we doing? (What are we doing?)
What are we doing?

What are we doing, baby?
