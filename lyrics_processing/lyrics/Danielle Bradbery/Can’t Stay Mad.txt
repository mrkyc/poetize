Said I'd meet you nine o'clock at your house
Read your text at 9:30 and you're still out
Can't believe I'm still parked here waiting at your place, ooh

You show up with a couple of friends
Right now I'm seeing red
I know you can tell, ooh
You whisper my favorite words
"Calm down, pretty girl
You know you're my whole world"

Boy, I can't stay mad at you
Why you gotta look that good?
I was ready to drive away
Until I looked in your eyes again
Now I can't stay mad at you, ooh

I can't stay, I can't stay
I can't stay mad at you
I can't stay, I can't stay mad

You forget things, kinda messy, you're reckless
Something 'bout it is kinda sexy, I like it
You know how to make me crazy
We've been down this road, ooh
You might also like
Ooh, you say a couple words
I say something worse
You say you're sorry first

Boy, I can't stay mad at you
Why you gotta look that good?
I was ready to drive away
Until I looked in your eyes again
Now I can't stay mad at you, ooh

I can't stay, I can't stay
I can't stay mad at you
I can't stay, I can't stay
No matter what I do
I can't stay, I can't stay
I can't stay mad at you
Mad at you, mad at you
Can't stay mad
Can't stay mad

Whisper my favorite words
"Calm down, pretty girl
You know you're my whole world" (My whole world)
Boy, I can't stay mad at you
Why you gotta look that good?
I was ready to drive away
Until I looked in your eyes again
Now I can't stay mad at you, ooh

I can't stay, I can't stay
I can't stay mad at you
I can't stay, I can't stay
No matter what I do
I can't stay, I can't stay
I can't stay mad at you
