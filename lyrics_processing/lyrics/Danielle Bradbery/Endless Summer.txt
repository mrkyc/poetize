I remember you and I that July
We were falling hard underneath the stars
As we danced slow to the radio
First taste of love couldn't get enough
In the pale moonlight just flying blind

And I still feel you
Just like I used to
That time of year when days get long

Warm winds blowing
Reckless still in my mind
Takes me right back to that time
When I was your baby and you were mine
And we were on fire just like the sun above
Couldn't burn hot enough for each other
Endless summer, endless summer

I coulda stayed in our hometown
Married you and settled down
With a picket fence and would've had a couple kids by now
But I had to get out
Couldn't hide my dreams
Had to do some other things before a diamond ring
You might also like
And I still feel you
Just like I used to
That time of year when days get long

Warm winds blowing
Reckless still in my mind
Takes me right back to that time
When I was your baby and you were mine
And we were on fire just like the sun above
Couldn't burn hot enough for each other
Endless summer, endless summer

Funny how the seasons change
And time slips away

Warm winds blowing
Reckless still in my mind
Takes me right back to that time
When I was your baby and you were mine
And we were on fire just like the sun above
Couldn't burn hot enough for each other
Endless summer
Warm winds blowing
Reckless through  my mind
Takes me right back to that time
When I was your baby and you were mine
And we were on fire
Two crazy kids in love
I'll do anything for another
Endless summer, endless summer
