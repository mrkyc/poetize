Hey, we're all in the same boat
Life can really suck sometimes
But hey, can't live in a shadow
So here's a little piece of advice

Start by kicking off your shoes, leave 'em right by the door
Then you call a couple friends and you call a few more
Put a drink into your glass that will make you let go
Then you find something smooth on the radio

That makes you wanna sway to the left and sway to the right
Get lost in a groove that'll make you lose your mind
Put a smile on your face, sends you right into a daze
No there ain't nothin' wrong when a song comes on
That makes you wanna sway, eh-eh-hey, eh-eh-hey, oh-oh-ooh

Hey, world's kinda messed up
We got no time for sittin' around
Waitin' for it to let up
Let's break some rules and figure it out
