One hit of you, I went through the roof
Your love's so strong, that's a hundred proof
Too much of you, I ain't drivin' home
No, I ain't spendin' the night alone

I must've been high when I met you
Out of my mind when I decided to love you
Now I'm just tryin' to forget you
I must've been, I must've been
I must've been high when I met you (met you)
Out of my mind when I decided to love you
I must've been drunk off your words
Twisted off your kisses, I know
I must've been, I must've been

High
I must've been high
I must've been high
I must've been high
I must've been high

I've been off of the drink, off of the drink
When I'm off of the drink I can control what I say
Can't remember your name
I might have said some shit I didn't really mean
Didn't really mean
Was it all just a dream, all just a dream
Seems like all just a dream
Can't remember a thing
There's a drink 
A girl up in my bed
Don't remember her name
How she get here with me

All this lyin' got me stressin'
Tell me why you keep me guessin' (you keep me guessin')
I wish I'd have learned my lesson (uh)
But I wanted you, yeah, I wanted you

I must've been high when I met you
Out of my mind when I decided to love you
Now I'm just tryin' to forget you
I must've been, I must've been
I must've been high when I met you (met you)
Out of my mind when I decided to love you
I must've been drunk off your words
Twisted off your kisses, I know
I must've been, I must've been

High
I must've been high
I must've been high
I must've been high
I must've been high
High
I must've been high
I must've been high
I must've been high
