She got lipstick on my blue collar
And she always tells me to call her
And I only got a few dollars
To my name
But we still hang

She's only with me for the credibility
She introduced me to her friend named Tiffany
And I know it's gonna end eventually
But that's alright
I don't mind

I think she's slummin' it with me
Got money in the bank
I keep lovin' on her for free
And all the finer things
I know your dad would be mad and you'd  like that
I know your mom plays along; takes her way back
I think she's slummin' it with me (Oh, oh, oh)
I think she's slummin' it with me (Oh, oh, oh)

They won't let me in her country club
But I still go there to pick her up
'Cause she loves the way they look at us
In dismay as we drive away

Slummin' it, slummin' it, slummin' it
Slummin' it, slummin' it, slummin' it
Slummin' it with me
Slummin' it, slummin' it, slummin' it
Slummin' it, slummin' it, slummin' it
Slummin' it, with me
Slummin' it, slummin' it, slummin' it
Slummin' it, slummin' it, slummin' it
Slummin' it, with me
Slummin' it, slummin' it, slummin' it
Slummin' it, slummin' it, slummin' it
Slummin' it, with me
Ya dig? Do your thing
Turn your stereo up, and clean out your stinky conscience
Watch your funk return to normal
