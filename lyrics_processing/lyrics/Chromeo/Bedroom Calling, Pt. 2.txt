You need my time, and I'm here to watch you
I could be here everyday, Johnny on the spot
Just name the place, and show your face
First I had no clue about you, now I'm all brand new about you
Why, girl, be my love all night
I'm tryna be cool but you're too flame
Burnin' up this life of mine, head to toe
Competition ain't even close

You know that I want you, girl
You know that I need you, girl
You know that I care

I could be anywhere, but I wanna be here with you, girl
My mind's here and there, but I wanna be here with you, girl
It's okay, let 'em stare, I wanna be here with you, girl
Girl, you always set my love on
Fire, fire, fire, fire, fire
Fire (talk to me), fire (talk to me)
Girl, you always set my love on fire

Pinch me, babe, say I'm dreaming
All these girls out here, I know they schemin'
They not like you, you should be celebrated
Tonight it's goin' down, but it feels like we elevated

You know that I want you, girl
You know that I need you, girl
You know that I care

I could be anywhere, but I wanna be here with you, girl
My mind's here and there, but I wanna be here with you, girl
It's okay, let 'em stare, I wanna be here with you, girl
Girl, you always set my love on fire

Bedroom callin', bedroom ballin'
I bet you're fallin' in love in the bedroom you can't call in
Such confusion, and nothing's solid
Too hard to know what's right from wrong
So, baby, talk to me, come on (Talk to me, come on)
Talk to me, come on (Talk to me, come on)
So, baby, talk to me, come on (Talk to me, come on)
Talk to me, come on (Baby, talk to me, come on)
So, baby, talk to me, come on
