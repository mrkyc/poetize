Go ahead and steal the shampoo
Take the robe too
It's all about you
This weekend
We've been working too hard
Need a new start
Put it all on my card this weekend

We can stay in for the whole damn trip
Sleep in, let the phone line ring
I made us a reservation at the hottest place in town
But if you're down

All we're gonna have is room service (ooh ooh)
Stay up until four
With a sign on the door saying
"Please don't disturb us" (ooh ooh)
Ain't no need to get dressed for some breakfast in bed
Just me and you, you, you, you
We're never gonna leave this room, room, room, room
Just me and you, you, you, you
And room service (ooh ooh), room service (ooh ooh)

Go ahead and jump on the bed
Or jump me instead
Ain't seeing none of our friends
This weekend
Hell nah, we're staying cooped up
Staying boozed up
Movies are eighteen and up
So freaky

We can stay in for the whole damn trip
Sleep in, let the phone line ring
I made us a reservation at the hottest place in town
But if you're down

All we're gonna have is room service (ooh ooh)
Stay up until four
With a sign on the door saying
"Please don't disturb us" (ooh ooh)
Ain't no need to get dressed for some breakfast in bed
Just me and you, you, you, you
We're never gonna leave this room, room, room, room
Just me and you, you, you, you
And room service (ooh ooh), room service
We can stay in for the whole damn trip
Sleep in, let the phone line ring
We may never get around to seeing any of this town
But if you're down

All we're gonna have is room service (ooh ooh)
Stay up until four
With a sign on the door saying
"Please don't disturb us" (ooh ooh)
Ain't no need to get dressed for some breakfast in bed
Just me and you, you, you, you
We're never gonna leave this room, room, room, room
Just me and you, you, you, you
And room service (ooh ooh), room service (ooh ooh)

Your water runs dry
I'm fillin' up the cup
You're feelin' uptight
We loosen up your stuff
Whenever you're down
We get you on your feet
We're at your door like room service
Give you what you need
Your water runs dry
I'm fillin' up the cup
You're feelin' uptight
We loosen up your stuff
Whenever you're down
We get you on your feet
We're at your door like room service
Give you what you need
Your water runs dry
I'm fillin' up the cup
You're feelin' uptight
We loosen up your stuff
Whenever you're down
We get you on your feet
We're at your door like room service
At your door like room service
