Who's gonna have your time, when it's down to the minute?
Ooh, baby, who's gonna have your time?
Who's gonna have your back, when the shove comes pushin'?
Ooh, baby, who's gonna have your back?

I know you do
I'm pretty sure you had it since I've met you
I listen to you talk, and it's like you're forgetin' about all the bullshit that we've been through
But I paid my dues, whatever you choose
I took the burden off of you too
I don't know why it's such a struggle to make you come around to my point of view

And I know it's gonna take time
But you know that I care
Yeah, believe me, I know it's gonna take time
But you know that I'm there
And when it gets down to it

I could never leave I'm too proud
I got my mind made up, my feet on the ground
When you're up all night and you never make a sound
Well, I'm not too far if you look around

Who's gonna have your right, when your left needs leanin'?
Ooh, baby, who's gonna take your side?
Who's gonna hold you down, when your heart beat's need it'?
Ooh, baby, you know

I know it's you
That's no excuse
And we can't go back, cause there's no pact and there's no truce
In other words, it's just no use
I told you first, when you know the truth
I know you're thirsty for a change
But nothing can arrange the strangeness that we're goin' through

And I know it's gonna take time
But you know that I care
Yeah, believe me, I know it's gonna take time
But you know that I'm there
And when it gets down to it

I could never leave I'm too proud
I got my mind made up, my feet on the ground
When you're up all night and you never make a sound
Well, I'm not too far if you look around
And I know it's gonna take time
But you know that I care
Yeah, believe me, I know it's gonna take time
But you know that I'm there
And when it gets down to it

We had much of everything
Your touch was everything
Went dutch on everything
But got lost on the way home
