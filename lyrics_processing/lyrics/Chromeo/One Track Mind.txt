I just got fixated on somebody
When I say "somebody", I mean you
This obsession's much more than a hobby
But I can't help myself, I can't help myself
I've been calling you from private numbers
Just to hear your voice then I hang up
So damn hot you're showin' up the summer
And I can't help myself, I can't help myself

I got a one track mind
And it's takin' up all my time
I got a one track mind
And it's all on you (It's all on you!)
And it's all on you (Yeah, it's all on you!)
I got a one track mind
And it's takin' up all my time
I got a one track mind
And it's all on you (It's all on you!)
And it's all on you (Yeah, it's all on you!)

Feelin' myself when I think about you
Don't believe your friends, I'm not a creep
Not a creep, I'm not a creep
The minute that they tell me I'm allowed to
I'm gonna pick you up and I'm gonna take you out

You might think I'm crazy, but I'm crazy 'bout you
Baby, can you blame me lookin' good like you do
You might think I'm crazy, but I'm crazy 'bout you
Baby, can you blame me lookin' good like you do
And my friends they don't get it
But they say I'm obsessed
But I'm upset
And I won't settle for nothing less than your caress
And I won't rest
And I won't sleep
And I'm a mess
And I won't eat
And when it all is said and done, I know that you're the only
One track mind (One track mind, one track mind)
