Let me tell you that I saw your boyfriend walking down the street
He was standing all shaky, hands all sweaty
And he could hardly speak
I might as well take a minute or two to put you onto some game
You got a boy like him, a man like me
And that's just not the same

Nevermind an SMS
What you need is a sweet caress
Everybody wanna talk too much
But what you need is a special touch
Ooh girl wouldn't that feel right?
A little dinner with a candlelight
And really when it comes down to it--
A man that's down to fight

I'll give you bonafied lovin', oh oh oh oh
The type that makes me feel old
I'll give you bonafied lovin', oh oh oh oh
The type that makes me feel old

Let me tell you that I saw your boyfriend walking down the road
He was standing all shook, couldn't even look
And I was extra cold
I might as well take a minute or two to talk about the perks
Cause you can't compete with a man like me
And that's just how it works

Look, this comes as no surprise
What you need is an older guy
With a little bit of life experience
The right clothes and the right appearance
Ooh girl wouldn't that feel nice?
Hot dinner with a candlelight
And really when it gets down to it--
A man that's down to fight

I'll give you bonafied lovin', oh oh oh oh
The type that makes me feel old
I'll give you bonafied lovin', oh oh oh oh
The type that makes me feel old

Oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh

I'll give you bonafied lovin', oh oh oh oh
The type that makes me feel old
I'll give you bonafied lovin', oh oh oh oh
