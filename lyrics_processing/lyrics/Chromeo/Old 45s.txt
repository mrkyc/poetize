Dudes'll step to you with a corny line
Asking for your name, saying, "What's your sign?"
You turn around like, "Boy quit talking to me"
He could pick you up in a limousine
You'd look back like, "What you mean?"
Just worry about more important things

Boys are non-committal, always in the middle
It bothers you a little, bothers you a little
Why can't we be like mom and dad?
You don't wanna settle or didn't you get the memo?
You only get a date if you're walking in stilettos
This is enough to drive you mad

If you think romance is dead and gone
Find an old jukebox full of 45s
Pop a nickel in it and it all comes back

You're out of luck or maybe out of touch
You only see schmucks and you really had enough
It's not adding up and you just don't understand
A straight shooter, he's a straight shooter
Cut to the chase and he asked if he could do ya
PS: He had a ring on his left hand
