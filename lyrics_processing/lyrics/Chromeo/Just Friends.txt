I bark, you bite
Whatever it is it ain't right
It's not intentional but tension is running high
My time, your world
I sit back and watch it unfurl
They can't blame me because I'm worried about my girl

We fight every night and day
And make for it right away
This is driving me insane
But I still love you anyway
Yeah anyway you want to put it
Bite my tongue or bite the bullet
Said a couple things that I shouldn't
I would take back if I could

If things fall apart again
I know, you know, we can go back to being just friends
May feel like we're wrong in the end
I know, you know, we can go back to being just friends
We can go back to being just friends
Oh! Oh-no-oh

Speak once, think twice
Looks like you put me on ice
The ice is melting every time we dim the lights
I'm dimwitted, deal with it
You said something slick I didn't get it
And now I wonder if our love is counterfeit

All these questions on my mind
Is this all some sort of sign
Is this love or am I blind
Or are we headed for decline?
I decline to answer that
But I'm inclined to state the facts
We stay on each other's back
Because opposites attract

If things fall apart again
I know, you know, we can go back to being just friends
May feel like we're wrong in the end but
I know, you know, we can go back to being just friends
Oh, oh, oh
I know, you know, we can go back to being just friends
I know, you know, we can go back to being just friends
I just can't forget when you're touching me right
I melt in my head, got me feeling so high
The aftereffect boy you're fuckin' me up
May not be correct but I can't get enough
I just can't forget when you're touching me right
I melt in my head, got me feeling so high
The aftereffect boy, you're fucking me up
May not be correct but I can't get enough
I just can't forget when you're touching me right
I melt in my head, got me feeling so high
The aftereffect boy, you're fucking me up
May not be correct but I can't get enough
I just can't forget when you're touching me right
I melt in my head, got me feeling so high
The aftereffect boy you're fuckin' me up
May not be correct but I can't get enough
I just can't forget when you're touching me right
I melt in my head, got me feeling so high
The aftereffect boy you're fuckin' me up
May not be correct but I can't get enough
Yeah, yeah baby, yeah
