When the night falls, oh yeah
You can tell by the way that you feel
Make the right calls, oh yeah
And just hope that she remembers you still
I'm searching for a good time
In a city where there's no one else around
And I know it's been a little while

And it's rather strange
I want to come at you, girl
And rekindle the flame

When the night falls, oh yeah
You can tell by the way that you feel
Make the right calls, oh yeah
And just hope that she remembers you still
