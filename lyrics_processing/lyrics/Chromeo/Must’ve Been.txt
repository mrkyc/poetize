I must've been, babe
Ooh, babe, yeah yeah

One hit of you, I went through the roof
Your love's so strong, that's a hundred proof
Too much of you, I ain't drivin' home
No, I ain't spendin' the night alone

All this lyin' got me stressin'
Tell me why you keep me guessin'
I wish I'd have learned my lesson
But I wanted you, yeah, I wanted you

I must've been high when I met you
Out of my mind when I decided to love you
Now I'm just tryin' to forget you
I must've been, I must've been
I must've been high when I met you (met you)
Out of my mind when I decided to love you
I must've been drunk off your words
Twisted off your kisses, I know
I must've been, I must've been

Could be Mary, could be Molly, could be you
Y'all girls got me in a trance
Hypnotized, can't wake up
Fantasizing, could be Christina or Lucy
Can't believe this how y'all do me
You only call me to use me and abuse me

All this lyin' got me stressin'
Tell me why you keep me guessin'
I wish I'd have learned my lesson
But I wanted you, yeah, I wanted you

I must've been high when I met you (met you)
Out of my mind when I decided to love you
Now I'm just tryin' to forget you (forget you)
I must've been, I must've been
I must've been high when I met you
Out of my mind when I decided to love you
I must've been drunk off your words
Twisted off your kisses, I know

High
I must've been, I must've been high
I must've been, I must've been high

High when I met you

I'm comin' down like a flight of stairs
I guess I'm finally seein' clear
I know I promised I wouldn't call
I guess I'm just goin' through withdrawal

I must've been high when I met you
Out of my mind when I decided to love you
I must've been drunk off your words
Twisted off your kisses, I know
I must've been, I must've been

High
I must've been, I must've been high
I must've been, I must've been high
I must've been, I must've been high
