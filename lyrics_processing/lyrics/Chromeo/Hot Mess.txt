You're a hot mess
You act like you've got nothing to lose
But I've already lost my temper

I put my lovin' on the line for you, lady
But my spirit's were low
I would've committed a crime for you, baby
Yeah, it got outta control

But I know my temper's been kinda crazy
(I need somebody, what, I need someone)
Your love is real but I just feel suffocated
(I feel so lonely, what, I feel so numb)

If I'd only known the attention you craved
Could this be the reason that I'm running away
And so I-I-I-I-I-I'm breaking the chain
Because lo-o-o-ov-ove isn't meant to complain

I thought we had this conversation already
Do you really want to go through this all over again?

The way I was acting was just fine but then lately
You sort of noticed a shift
Everyday was Christmas time for you, lady
And you got showered with gifts

But you could hear it in my voice
That I was getting kind of aloof

I don't really have a choice
Boy you just always assume

You had me making up excuses
And now I gotta tell you the truth

Well maybe I don't wanna hear it
I think we both know what we have to do

If I'd only known the attention you craved
Could this be the reason that I'm running away
And so I-I-I-I-I-I'm breaking the chain
Because lo-o-o-ov-ove isn't meant to complain

I don't know what you want from me
I mean, I'm not a bloody social worker

I know my temper's been kinda crazy
(I need somebody, what, I need someone)
Your love is real but I just feel suffocated
(I feel so lonely, what, I feel so numb)

If I'd only known the attention you craved
Could this be the reason that I'm running away
And so I-I-I-I-I-I'm breaking the chain
Because lo-o-o-ov-ove isn't meant to complain

I feel so lonely
