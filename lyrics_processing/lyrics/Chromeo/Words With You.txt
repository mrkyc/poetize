When we met
I thought to myself, "She must be Heaven-sent"
Ah, yeah
But as of late
Communication started to deteriorate
Not great

Now I gotta have a word with you
I gotta have a word with you

I heard the rumors
Percolating 'round us, I didn't listen too much
I was in denial (In denial)
I didn't think that acting shady was your style
For a while

Now I gotta have a word with you
I gotta have a word with you
Let me get a word or two
I gotta have a word with you

A simple word called "trust"
That's between the two of us
I wouldn't wanna play with that, no
'Cause if I rocked the boat
You'd be comin' at my throat
Why'd you wanna break the pact?

So I gotta have a word with you
I gotta have a word with you
Let me get a word or two
Yeah, I gotta have a word with you


I don't wanna do a Q&A
No fingerprints or DNA
No need for an interview
Just a word with you
I don't wanna do a Q&A
No fingerprints or DNA
No need for an interview
Just a word or two
I don't wanna do a Q&A
No fingerprints or DNA
No need for an interview
Just a word with you
I don't wanna do a Q&A
No fingerprints or DNA
No need for an interview
Just a word with you

I just gotta share what's been on my mind
After all this time, I want you to know
I said I just gotta share what's been on my mind
After all this time, I want you to know
Yeah, I just gotta share what's been on my mind
