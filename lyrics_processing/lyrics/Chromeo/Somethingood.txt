An electrifying moment
A blast of lightning through the storm
Should have seen it as an omen
But I chose to carry on
This is what those tales are made of
It was rather true to form
A boy sees girl then his knees just drop
Heartbeat stops

I care for you
And I'll switch the word up if you want me to
I care for you
But caring is so see-through
The sequel is a thing we call love

I can't leave you alone
It's rattling my bones
I can feel it
It's just the start and this is something good
I can't leave you alone
It's rattling my bones
I can feel it
It's just the start and this is something good

I can never lie
I'm sweating but my hands are dry
Say the word and I'm the first one running
I'm the first one running
And every little move you make is no mistake
So don't just take me for a pretender
I'm a contender

I care for you
And I'll switch the word up if you want me to
I care for you
But caring is so see-through
The sequel is a thing we call love
