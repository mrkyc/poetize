Remember what you said to me?
Twenty-three, twenty-three
I'm your enemy's enemy
Remember what you said to me?
Twenty-three, twenty-three

Yeah, you may as well not help me, yeah, just send for me
Tonight is black with white, yeah, just like pen and ink
I need a girl right now, I need a heroine
What was that thing you gave me, was that heroin?
What was that day you gave it to me, yesterday?
I wake up my legs, that's not it, my head is dead
There's too many women and there's too many men in here
Angels like you, fucking with the devil in me

Remember what you said to me?
Twenty-three, twenty-three
I'm your enemy's enemy
Remember what you said to me?
Twenty-three, twenty-three

Oi, sometimes I hate my friends more than my enemies
A friend to all is not a friend to anyone
But each time the chips are down we will be leveling
Got the cup and went all the way like Wembley
Girls on one, boys on two, head for three
On the way out, in the Maybach, on the way back, pedaling
Flying high, flying high, flying, bury me
Angels like you, fucking with the devil in me
See The Streets LiveGet tickets as low as $95You might also like
Sometimes I hate my friends more than my enemies
You're supposed to have my back more than any of these
Say what you meant man I don't take offence easy
Herbal living, ain't got no time
Parsley, basil, fenugreek, yeah
Positivity, negativity, none of these are felonies
Sometimes I hate my friends more than my enemies
Sometimes I hate my friends more than my enemies
Angels like you, fucking with the devil in me

Remember what you said to me?
Twenty-three, twenty-three
Remember what you said to me?
Twenty-three, twenty-three
I'm your enemy's enemy
Remember what you said to me?
