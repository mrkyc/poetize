Ahhh see, right
See, the thing that's got it all fucked up now is camera phones
How the hell am I supposed to be able to do a line
In front of complete strangers
When I know they've all got cameras?

When you're a famous boy, it gets really easy to get girls
It's all so easy, you get a bit spoilt
But when you try to pull a girl who is also famous too
It feels just like when you wasn't famous

The celebrity pages in papers don't tell tales
That are always to the line of the truth
It's till a line at which most likely you'll have the time
Or enough finance to sue
Which is why it's so frightening buying papers in the morning
Fearing the next Mike Skinner scoop
'Cause I used to believe what I read
So now I know that others will believe that it's true
But I realised, with you, the truth can be
A whole lot worse than the flack
My whole life I never thought I'd see a pop star smoke crack
And I must admit I was quite shocked
With that thing you did with me on my back
But, outside in the lobby
I shouldn't have laughed when you slapped that man

When you're a famous boy, it gets really easy to get girls
It's all so easy, you get a bit spoilt
But when you try to pull a girl who is also famous too

You were so much fun
I really got to like you more than you liked me
I really hoped that you'd stay
Considering the amount of prang you'd done
You looked amazing on CD:UK
You learn dances, do promo, cameras flashing
Get in the van and zoom away
I wake up high, diss my beat
Feel hung over and sorry for my doomed day
But I know I got a bit close to you
And that you found it fucking boring
You taught me so much about how to deal
With the fire I'd fallen in
And what version of a rumour
Would next day be everyone's story of me
You taught me all the realities and turn the page and ignore 'em

When you're a famous boy, it gets really easy to get girls
It's all so easy, you get a bit spoilt
But when you try to pull a girl who is also famous too
It feels just like when you wasn't famous
Anyway, I had to rest my beer hat
Delete my dealer's number and unroll my bank notes
And we were on borrowed time anyway
What with the daily toilet papers not knowing
And I knew that when the people who thought they knew you
When they found out, I would've been mocked
Which is ironic, 'cause in reality
Standing next to you, I look fucking soft
Whenever I see you on MTV, I can't stop my big wide smile
And past the children's appeal, I see the darkness behind
We both know the scratches on my back
Much better than the alludes and lies
I miss the bitching and shouting, but I'm glad I got out in time

When you're a famous boy, it gets really easy to get girls
It's all so easy, you get a bit spoilt
But when you try to pull a girl who is also famous too
It feels just like when you wasn't famous

"You can't keep fucking pop stars
We've got a fucking business to run
There are industry repercussions, Michael!"
