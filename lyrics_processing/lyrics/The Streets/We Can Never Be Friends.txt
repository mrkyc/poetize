Saying, "I love you forever"
Won't hold us together
A dove and a feather won't better our love
Or recover us, ever
But I don't know if I missed you
Or if I'm blowing this tissue
Because I only miss you
Rather than no, I'd not risk you
That's not a frown I like
How is it, now you decide?
I'll go to town if I like
Be 'round about five
Your future lies in you seeing new guys
You'll feel new eyes on you
You'll need to lie about this
And me you like wise too

We can never be friends
One wants to stay together, one wants it to end
We can never be friends
We can make it easy

Mistake a little wait for an ache
Mistake loneliness to mean only us
An addiction to a fix of praise
Rely on me to say it's okay
There is only room for one in this sun
There was only one of me and you once
And you want to want another few loves
In the night, let it fly to the light
All the bits you miss from your ex
Commitment, kissing and sex
Are what you'll insist from the next
Are what you'll insist from the next
But is it who dares wins, or only who knows goes?
Frank Bruno's nose has seen too many blows
If you're bitter then it's better to pretend not bicker
It butters when it festers, it fucks all the fun
This is us fizzling
But with added little pangs
We reached the end
You'll never see me again

We can never be friends
