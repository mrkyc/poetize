Trust me
Is the skyline sliced up into pieces
And broken steel and mesh?
Or is the progress a process
That's a natural people quest?
Metal and the workings
Dark and lurking in my mind
Branded neon red and blue flashes
The view from the flats is nice
I see Alice in Wonderland
I see malice in Sunderland
Mouse to house, I am this land
The where without, it's Thumberland
Smoke to a karma coma
Jamaicans do yard aromas
Shake Bacardis and Coke and
Make me laugh and (Trust me)

So much stuff and many people
The future is not evil
The future is not fission
It's simple, it's efficient
Now that things are costing nothing
Is any of it good?
Come and love me, read my nothings
Blogging river floods
Dead plant planted on the window ledge
Shadows dance, glint and blend
Glance slow at the night outside
I'm God in the game
Sound rumbles in 5.1
Round some corner to fight with guns
Play God in games but nothing in
(Trust me)

Dub step, club sweat
Come get rubbed red

I see Alice in Wonderland
I see malice in Sunderland
Mouse to house, I love this land
The where without, it's Thumberland

Do the wrong thing, joke it right
Spurn the long tings and the fights
For all the oil and the toil
And the spoils of the royals
We are nothing if not nice
We are cuffing if we are wise
Roll me up like a leafy spliff
Fuck that, roll me up and (Trust me)

Why is there so much noise?
Reading info, buying toys
We all fear of company
But we are fierce anonymously
Enter shit on the internet
Clashing people, chatting evil
But we are cheery social sorts
With the pleasing photo forward
Pass the love around and back to me
Walking down a mad, mad street
The music in my ears is fleeting
Struggle to shuffle to the same beat
We are nothing if not nice
We have a pretty buttered knife
Is the skyline sliced up into pieces
And broken steel and strife?
Anything you tell me
Yes, yes, I will believe
But again and I suspect
Again and I will leave
Slow burn a little heaven
Roaming yearnings for Devon
Coburn sixty-seven
Don't work for them (Trust me)
Dub step, earth run
Red club sweat
Put up chests and freeze
Freeze
Is the skyline sliced up into pieces
And broken steel and mesh?
Or is the progress a process
