This ain't the down, it's the upbeat, make it complete
So what's the story? Guaranteed accuracy, enhanced CD
Latest technology, darts hit treble twenty
Huge non-recoupable advance, majors be vigilant
I excel in both content and deliverance
So let's put on our classics and we'll have a little dance, shall we?
No sales pitch, no media hype
No hydro, it's nice and ripe
I speak in communications in bold type
This ain't your archetypal street sound, scan for ultrasounds
North, south, east, west and all 'round
And then to the underground

You say that everything sounds the same
Then you go buy them
There's no excuses, my friend
Let's push things forward
You say that everything sounds the same
Then you go buy them
There's no excuses, my friend
Let's push things forward

As we progress to the check point
I wholeheartedly agree with your viewpoint
But this ain't your typical garage joint
I make points which hold significance
That ain't a bag, it's a shipment
This ain't a track, it's a movement
I got the settlement
My frequencies are transient and resonate your eardrums
I make bangers, not anthems
Leave that to The Artful Dodger
The broad-shouldered fifty-one percent shareholder
You won't find us on Alta Vista
Cult classic, not bestseller
You're gonna need more power
Plug in the three-phase and the generator
Crank it up to the gigawatts
Critics, ready with your pot shots, the plot thickens
Put on your mittens for these sub-zero conditions
But remember I'm just spitting, remember I'm just spitting
Once bitten, forever smitten

You say that everything sounds the same
Then you go buy them
There's no excuses, my friend
Let's push things forward
You say that everything sounds the same
Then you go buy them
There's no excuses, my friend
Let's push things forward

Spit jewels like Eastern riches, junkie fixes
Around here, we say "birds", not "bitches"
As London Bridge burns down, Brixton's burning up
Turns out you're in luck, 'cause I know this dodgy fuck in the Duck
So it's just another show flick from your local city poet
In case you geezers don't know it, let's push things forward
It's a tall order, but we're taller
Calling all maulers, back street brawlers
Corner shop crawlers, victory's flawless
Love us or hate us, but don't slate us
Don't conform to formulas, pop genres and such
Sharp darts, Double Dutch
Parked cars, troubles are much
With more bud
Let's push things forward
You say that everything sounds the same
Then you go buy them
There's no excuses, my friend
Let's push things forward
You say that everything sounds the same
Then you go buy them
There's no excuses, my friend
