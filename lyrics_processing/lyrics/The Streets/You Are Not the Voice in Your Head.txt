I look at my watch for the time this second
But then at my phone to confirm it's true
She comes back in from the bathroom smelling
The same as before but I guess a bit new
"There's no such thing as a joke" she says
There's only jest with the truth
But she accepts the apology I never said
And I get on with attempting to be cute
Her eyes look photoshopped catch like wet
Could see the reflection back behind my head
Every time her eyes closed I dreamed a whole thread
That reality was better than the truth
I said "I hope girls will start to instead cos' now men can't try the first move"
I knew it wasn't clever it was wrong saying 'owt
Her eyes rolled like a fruit machine not paying out
She said "Don't be that guy when we've only just met. Don't try the trousers of what doesn't suit you"

You are not the voice in your head
You're the one who listens to it

She checked her feed and I grabbed at the menu
And I felt like a child letting go of a balloon
I said "It's just too hard to know how to tread. I mean more time guys that just try to keep it moving. No more time guys become an all over rash and it takes you by shock if it's just fucking ew"
I was leaning in to try and get a little bit friendly
We were shooting up the bar with arrows of cupid
Wondered whether she felt like she was sitting in a bath
And then moved and was cold and was covered in goosebumps
Said if me and her threw our problems on a stack
I would see hers and I would want mine back

In the real world girls aren't making moves
Someone needs to if we want the race to continue
I pointed but we almost near enough touched
She remained still and didn't duck when we didn't touch
You're all lost
You're eating sweets at the seaside
When we need to be free so we can free you guys
You kissed the toy then avoid what's important
You missed the point like you missed the toilet
Awkward
Thirsty
Trying to corner off
She caught me at my worst like the boy in my corner shop
How the hell's a man supposed to know why you are saying things
When it is against the rules to find out straight
Despite what it might seem like it's fucking implicit
What someone thinks about you is none of your business

You are not the voice in your head
You're the one who listens to it
You are not the voice in your head
