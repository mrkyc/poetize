We haven't even started and it's almost the end
We never talked it over, in fact, we never said anything
Two of the same kind of sorts, hiding thoughts
As the small talk ebbs away, the silence is awkward
You hardly even know me and I'm starting to show that
I hardly even know you, but I like what I know
I want to talk about it, but I quake in my skin
It'll only push you further into making decisions
You want to like me, but you were likely undecided
The voice inside me's always right
Which is why the awkward silence
Not gonna risk losing you
Which is why I'm never gonna woo you

I think I love you more than you like me
Although I'm never surer, maybe I should want to be blind
I think I love you more than you like me
Because this is even crossing my mind

Any other day and you'd have not looked twice
The joking went along with my roll of the dice
Purely by chance, I happened on feeling
Really confident around the place and people
You caught a no-hitter, hitting winning strokes
I never am a winner, I'm a lonely bloke
Acting exciting like a man for a while
Until you realised I can act like a child
Eternal optimism is spurring me onto think
That acting on yearnings like this might lead me to learn a secret
But I don't really know, or why I think so
It's just a good hunch, hunches are always right though

I think I love you more than you like me
Although I'm never surer, maybe I should want to be blind
I think I love you more than you like me
Because this is even crossing my mind

I drew a drawing of you after last time I saw you
I never felt to draw a picture like that before
I learnt a lot about myself drawing all morning
It was absolutely shit, I'm awful at drawing

I think I love you more than you like me
Although I'm never surer, maybe I should want to be blind
I think I love you more than you like me
Because this is even crossing my mind
I think I love you more than you like me
Although I'm never surer, maybe I should want to be blind
I think I love you more than you like me
