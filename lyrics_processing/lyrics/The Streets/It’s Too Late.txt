She said, "Meet me at the gates at eight
Leave now, don't be late"
She said one day, she'd walk away 'cause I was always late
Thought things were okay
Didn't care though anyway
Say, "Sorry, babe, I had to meet a mate," tempting our fate
We first met through a shared view, she loved me and I did too
It's now 7:50, getting ready, better be nifty
Do my hair quickly; step out, it's cloudy
Mate bells me to borrow money, I got two Henry's and a dealer to pay
Call up on geezers to rid these green trees of my reeking jeans
Got a "You think I care?" air, out-glaring geezers' stares
I'm here and I'm there
Couldn't see past the end of my beer
What was getting near all the silence after the cheers

I didn't know that it was over
'Til it was too late (Too late)
But if I ever needed you
Would you be there?

She said, "Meet me at the gates, don't be late"
But pretty soon, the day came for change
And I was glad she never walked away
So I'm choosing what to wear
Doing my hair with an hour to spare
When my life went pear, she'd been there with a thick stare
Big wheel climbed to the top
Geezer stares bounced off
Standing at the top of this huge mountain
Smiling and shouting, spring flowers sprouting
Not one inch of doubt in my mind as I reached the gates
Came 'round the corner at a rate
Risked her love, but I was gonna set things straight
Never again am I gonna be late
Never again am I gonna be late
Never again am I gonna be late

I said, "Meet me at the gates
Leave now, don't be late"
I waited for a while listening to her voicemail, mind set sail
Then the facts turned me pale
Wind, rain, and hail
My fears unveiled for my fair female
She'd walked away; too little, too late
I step up the pace, walk past the gates, rain runs over my face
Spirit falls from grace
I purchase a hazy escape at the alcohol place in the Chase
Sat down, got a fat frown
Weeping and drowning my senses
For this love game's expensive
I walk in a trance
Got a wounded soldier's stance
And the everyday geezers' stares throw me off balance
Now nothing holds significance
And nothing holds relevance
'Cause the only thing I can see is her elegance
I didn't know that it was over
'Til it was too late (Too late)
But if I ever needed you
Would you be there?
I didn't know that it was over
'Til it was too late (Too late)
But if I ever needed you
