Two great European narcotics, alcohol and Christianity
I know which one I prefer

We never went to church
Just get on with work and sometimes things'll hurt
But it's hit me since you left us
And it's so hard not to search
If you were still about
I'd ask you what I'm supposed to do now
I just get a bit scared every now
I hope I made you proud

On your birthday when mum passed the forks and spoons
I put my head on the table, I was so distraught with you
You tidied your things into the bin the more poorly you grew
So there's nothing of yours to hold or to talk to
You put your hand up and interrupt the conversation with a "But"
People say I interrupt people with the same look
Sometimes I think so hard, I can't remember how your face looked
Started reading about dreams in your favourite book
I panic and pace when I can't see the right thing to do
You'd be scratching your head through the best advice you knew
And I feel sad I can't hear you reciting it through
I miss you, Dad, but I've got nothing to remind me of you

We never went to church
Just get on with work and sometimes things'll hurt
But it's hit me since you left us
And it's so hard not to search
If you were still about
I'd ask you what I'm supposed to do now
I just get a bit scared every now
I hope I made you proud

I needed a break when your book about dreams was taken
I needed to pray or see a priest that day
I needed to leave this trade and just heave it away
But I cleaned up my place like you so I could see things straight
I never cared about God when life was sailin' on the calm
So I said I'd get my head down
And I'd deal with the ache in my heart
And, for that, if God exists, I'd reckon he'd pay me regard
Mum says me and you are the same from the start
I guess, then, you did leave me something to remind me of you
Every time I interrupt someone like you used to
When I do something like you, you'll be on my mind all through
'Cause I forgot you left me behind to remind me of you

We never went to church
Just get on with work and sometimes things'll hurt
But it's hit me since you left us
And it's so hard not to search
If you were still about
I'd ask you what I'm supposed to do now
I just get a bit scared every now
I hope I made you proud
We never went to church
Just get on with work and sometimes things'll hurt
But it's hit me since you left us
And it's so hard not to search
But you used to tell me how you didn't know
What to do, even now
And then I'm not so scared somehow
'Cause I know that you'd be proud
I got a good one for you, Dad
I'm gonna see a priest, a Rabbi and a Protestant clergyman
