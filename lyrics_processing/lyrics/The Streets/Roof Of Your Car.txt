Gaze up to the skies
Truth, you've opened up my eyes, eyes

On the leg and a wing, we'll be winging it hard
On the wing of prayer, on the wing of a car
Between radio stations and tuned-in verse
Are echoes of the creation of this universe
Stars don't light up, stars reflect
I don't light up, we reflect
You then light up, I deflect
Just the racket of crickets
And this packet of biscuits
Some flat-out big riffs
And a fat lemon bifter

On the roof of your car, at the stars
On the roof of your car, at the stars
On the roof of your car, at the stars
Through to the start

Gaze up to the skies
Truth, you've opened up my eyes, eyes
See The Streets LiveGet tickets as low as $95You might also like
One day they're gonna make electrical implants for the brain
That simulate raving sensations, Wayne
Imagine the dilemma for the man and his penance
If he could get fucked without hanging his health up?
Would this be illegal? (No, no, no)
Would the Daily Mail rail on it?
Is this evil to need to escape these capers?

On the roof of your car, at the stars
On the roof of your car, at the stars
On the roof of your car, at the stars
Through to the start

Gaze up to the skies
Truth, you've opened up my eyes, eyes

Pull out the glove box, blanket in the boot (Woo!)
Yesterday's sweets are hankering for some fruit
In a rainproof jacket on the sunroof, sack it
I wish on a star (Please?), I wish for a bar (Please?) with a cigar
Start up the engine so the battery doesn't flatten
The music on the shuffle is becoming a pattern
(Oh) I don't know what that is
On the roof of your car, at the stars
On the roof of your car, at the stars
On the roof of your car, at the stars
Through to the start

Like some Ballardian nightmare from 1986
Let the satellite navigation system guide us to the Styx
We ride on her direction through the night, while up to tricks
So the authority-like figures don't find us with our spliffs

On the roof of your car, at the stars
On the roof of your car, at the stars
On the roof of your car, at the stars
Through to the start
