By dawn I close the book or it will be dusk on the page
We're beaten in the rainfall till there's blood in the rain
I feel your eyes on me whenever I duck away from saying
Envy eats everyone like rust on the paint
I ran the platform but I end up stuck on the train
Fluke's not a dude, yo, luck be a lady
If you ever need to talk, you know that I'm here
But there's no way I'd say, 'yeah, let's both be really clear'

If I ever told you needed you, I really needed you
If I told you I needed you and you weren't there
When I told you I needed you, I really needed you
If you're not here when I need you, I never need you again

There's a different weed for every scene
There's a plume for every mood
We partied on the train
We had to do in the tube
This story's not mad, it's really lunacy news
Basic merchandise, a black Fruit of the Loom
Running to our deaths, we all zoom to our tombs
This is not a nightclub, it's a room with a queue
Please don't give spoilers, I won't give clues to the movie
There's too many answers, but two questions few

If I ever told you I needed you, I really needed you
If I told you I needed you and you weren't there
When I told you I needed you, I really needed you
If you're not here when I need you, I never need you again

We patch over a love triangle by sewing on a square
Not everyone's a king, thrones are so rare
Download memes, laugh, decode and then share
Fast in a vacuum, but slow in the air
My worship needs a shaper, a blow dry for my prayers
Keep you the rosaries, but loan me your prayers
Hold on to the job, no, throw out the career
Lead us not to temptation, we know our own way there

If I ever told you I needed you, I really needed you
If I told you I needed you and you weren't there
When I told you I needed you, I really needed you
If you're not here when I need you, I never need you again

If you ever need to talk, you know that I'm here
There's no way I'd say, 'yeah, let's be really clear'
Been gambling on my own, playing poker for years
The river will drag you under when it looks to flow so clear
Wind never sings from afar, it only blows near
I hate you and I know you, but I just don't know, dear
Fast days they go so fast, but oh so slow the years
If you ever need to talk, you know I'm here
If I ever told you I needed you, I really needed you
If I told you I needed you and you weren't there
When I told you I needed you, I really needed you
