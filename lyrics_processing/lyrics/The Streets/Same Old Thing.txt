Yeah, street level
Oi, oi, yeah
That's it, right there

'Round here, nothing seems to change (At street level)
Same old thing every day (That's it, that's it, that's it)
Just gets played and replayed in different ways (Yeah)
Oi, tune's heavy

Whose round is it?
Down that beer quick, smash my glass back down
Fall over the table, all rowdy and pissed
Seems the only difference between midweek shit
And weekend is how loud I speak
And whether I try and pull a girlfriend, that's it
Who's got dough?
Ayy, you know I'd pay, but I'm broke, only got coinage to show
Putting off walking home on my own to my throne
Two empty takeaways, ashtrays, the remains of the day stoned
Pick a bottle off the table, peel the label, tell a fable
Offer opinion for free on a solution to the latest big news story
"Football and Smut Daily" as I ponder winning the lottery
Buy a drink, chat to a lady, the girl's well fit
Definitely, not maybe, she's rude
I'd shag her and make tea, right there

Can't lounge in the boozer all day, got manoeuvres to make
Gotta see a man about a dog, can't be late, I'm always late
Raining cats and fog, but nice and dry in the Black Dog
Down it in one, my son
Can't sit here, gotta run, things need done
If they don't win this and the next one
They're getting relegated to the third division
At street level, real people, same repeated sequel
Rock and roll, four to the floor
Like last night, yesterday morning
And the night before, and the night before

Apparently
There's a whole world out there somewhere (It's right there)
I just don't see it (Right there)
I just don't see it (Oi, oi)
