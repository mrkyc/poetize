I looked at your status: 'In a relationship'
'In a relationship', an earthquake hit me (Oi!)
Your status had changed
You've never quirked about this
Couldn't drag my eye away, the words on the screen
Nothing said between us but you just weren't that keen
'In a relationship', Plain Helvetica
So walk away and let it go

Why did you leave it so late to tell me?
Wow, what a revelation (Oh, oh)
Then I get you and you get me honestly, and
Wow, what a situation
Oh my god, why did you leave it so late to tell me?
Wow, what a revelation (Oh, oh)
Then I get you and you get me honestly and
Wow, what a situation

I looked at your photo of folks I didn't know
Folks I hadn't noticed seem close to you now
We'd been hanging out a lot
I'd gathered that'd have to stop
All that build up for me
All the weeks of us walking past tree after tree
All the patience and doubt, the elation that maybe
All may as well bow, you're in a relationship now

Looked at your status: 'In a relationship'
'In a relationship', it devastated me
Then what did I spy?
I punched the fucking sky
Among the normally ignorable requests at the right
I'd never have guessed there was a request so nice
Now, if you look at my status
I'm in a relationship too
With you

Why did you leave it so late to tell me?
Wow, what a revelation (Oh, oh)
Then I get you and you get me honestly, and
Wow, what a situation
I stand corrected, I was pushing for the best
I guess I took one look at you and forgot the rest
But I've got what it takes
And it won't be wasted on fakes

I paced myself
And I have faith this time
I saw something for me
I felt something right

Why did you leave it so late to tell me?
Wow, what a revelation (Oh, oh)
Then I get you and you get me honestly, and
Wow, what a situation
Oh my god, why did you leave it so late to tell me?
