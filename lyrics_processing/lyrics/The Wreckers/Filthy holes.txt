If you fuck with us you die
Have be ballin since July
All my niggas think I lie
Cause they Know I got a ride
Cause I gat no fucking time
Having been making music rhymes
If you think am damn insane
You go get yourself to blame

Down the filthy hole
You go down the filthy hole
Bitch
Down the filthy hole
You go down the filthy hole
Down the filthy hole
You go down the filthy hole
Bitch
Down the filthy hole
You go down the filthy hole
Bitch

Having been walking block to block
And am moving street to street
All my niggas know am neat
Cause they know I gat a knit
Have been fucking all this holes
And am looking just damn old
Have been wearing {uhh} all this Vs
To console all this soul
You might also like
I called her over
She came along with her grandmother
I fuck both twice
And I told damn is damn over
It seems like a coincidence bitch I need to game over
Damn this filthy hole
I think her grandma was fucking hotter
Thought my dick was the weakest ever
But their reaction shows it was the hottest so far
Now my money longer,shout out to bro Uzi
Notice you all bitches I don't need no single lover
My life on a race like a Benz on a western road
Before I reach 18th rounding up my 100th holes {uh}
Cause you know I gat no time
Have been making music rhymes
All my money coming now
Like I'm Mr.Busta rhymes

Down the filthy hole we go
Don't wanna let someone know
Have been eating this pussy
Like the bitch is a doe
Like a farmers with no hoe
The dollar is damn cold
So I trade it for the Ps then the price won't go
How I got my Gc3 that what niggas want to know
Fuck that bitch with ma toes
Like am damn Cole Joe
Yeah
Like am damn Cole Joe
Yeah
Like his damn Cole Joe
