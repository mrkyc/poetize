(Ay)
(Ay, yuh, ay)

Time is a place that I never don't go
Off to the lands when I'm off to the store
Offer me pussy and offer me dough
When it's all in my head then I'm feelin' alone
Open the gates and let's finish this song
And then most of these people be singin' along
(Yuh, ay, ok, yuh)
Time is a place that I never don't go
Off to the lands when I'm off to the store
Offer me pussy and offer me dough
When I'm all in my head then I'm feelin' alone
Open the gates and let's finish a song
Most of these people be singin' along

I be all in my room with my mind under wraps
And you runnin' away when I'm passin' the curb
And I never be safe when I lived in the grove
Headin' for lunch and your bitch wanna go
And I'm all in the cut and I'm all in my zone
And you sittin around when it's my time to blow
Spit in your face and I wax it some more
When I'm chasin' the paper, show why I got to go
When you want it they come but never could blow
Cause you always been pussy, you psycho before
You might also like
I want a pink sheep
I never roll around tuesday
I live a movie
Directed and scored, I shoot it
When I die, bury me in chrome
Cover me in gold
Put diamonds in my smile
(Smile)
Let me see the glow
When I lead the glow
Bad bitch, I'm lookin' down
Roll around with lemonade, face
Young bull payin' for the whole thing
Young bull stayin' straight stone face
Stone cold sold no bitch in me
I'm the new black history
I'm the no-love trinity
I'm the light that you see on the end of your Cigarette when you hit filter lit literally
(Yuh)

Time is a place that I never don't go
Off to the lands when I'm off to the store
Offer me pussy and offer me dough
When it's all in my head then I'm feelin' alone
Open the gates and let's finish this song
