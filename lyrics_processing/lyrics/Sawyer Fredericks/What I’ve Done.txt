Siren echoes through the hills
So the whole town gathers around
To see just what I've done, what I've done
So the whole town gathers around
To see just what I've done, what I've done
What I've done
Oh last few days, oh I've been lonely
Though I never loved you
Just didn't want to be alone
'Cause in the mornin' I brought you flowers
Singing love songs through your days
I gave you this false heart to make sure
You'd never leave me
So you'd never leave me
So the whole town gathers around
To see just what I've done, what I've done
So the whole town gathers around
To see just what I've done, what I've done
What I've done
Then you told me that you loved me
I didn't feel a thing
Guess I just never realized
Just what it means to be loved
What it means to be loved
You might also likeYour heart stacked on the line
Maybe it's just your fault
It comes crashin' down on me
The one who made you fall
Yes, let it come crashin' down, I'll be the
One to make you fall
I'll be the one to make you fall
'Cause in the mornin' when you awake
Just to find that I'm gone
No, I never loved you
I just didn't want to be alone
So I use love to pull you into my arms
Just to know how it felt to hold you
How it felt to hold you
How it felt to hold you
No, you couldn't stand to see me go
You couldn't bare to let me stay
So you went to that roof
Standing close to the edge
'Cause even though your heart is breakin'
You couldn't take that step
Yes, even though your heart is breakin'
You couldn't take that step
But you have to take it
But you had to take it
So the whole town gathers around
To see just what I've done, what I've done
So the whole town gathers around
To see just what I've done, what I've done
So the whole town gathers around
To see just what I've done, what I've done
