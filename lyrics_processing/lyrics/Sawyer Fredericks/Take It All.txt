My head is spinnin' around and my heart is on the floor
Beatin' louder than the roar of thunder, bangin' on my door
So take it all, oh, take it all, mmm mmm
I left my world wide open, it felt like a dream
You found me as another, I barely knew my name
You take it all, oh, take it all, oh-oh

Take the hurt in my chest, take the pain in my eyes
Take the fear in my soul, take the tears that I cry
You call me out of my head and I was ready to fall
'Cause you are all that I need
So, take it all

Take it all

My body's almost broken, it can't contain my soul
This storm is goin' quiet, but I still feel the cold
I left my world behind me, I'll never be the same
But these memories still screamin' loud, callin' out my name
Take it all

Take the hurt in my chest, take the pain in my eyes
Take the fear in my soul, take the tears that I cry
You call me out of my head and I was ready to fall
'Cause you are all that I need
So, take it all
You might also like
So, take it all
So, take it all
So, take it all

Hey now, it's hard to let go
Of everythin' that I used to know
Hey now, there's nothin' left to hold
And darlin', I can't make it alone

Take the hurt in my chest, take the pain in my eyes
Take the fear in my soul, take the tears that I cry
You call me out of my head and I was ready to fall
'Cause you are all that I need
So, take it all
Take the hurt in my chest, take the pain in my eyes (Take it all)
Take the fear in my soul, take the tears that I cry (Take it all)
You call me out of my head and I was ready to fall (Take it all)
'Cause you are all that I need
So, take it all
Take the hurt in my chest, take the pain in my eyes (Take it all)
Take the fear in my soul, take the tears that I cry (Take it all)
You call me out of my head and I was ready to fall (Take it all)
'Cause you are all that I need
