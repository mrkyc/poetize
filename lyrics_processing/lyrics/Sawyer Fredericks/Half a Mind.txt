I've been away
You've taken another
Into our bed
You wanted to love
Yes you wanted to laugh
I can not fault you
For that
But you knew
That I'd find out
Yes you knew
That I'd cut him down
You think I don't
Want you now
You think my love
Has run out
The day that I come home
Your bags are packed
You're ready to go
Cause how could I love you anymore
You said, "Why
Won't you let me go?"
Cause I've got
Half a mind
To kill you
And the other half
Is still in love
How I longed to be with you
All those nights I've been alone
You might also likeBut you knew
That I'd find out
Yes you knew
That I'd cut him down
You think I don't
Want you now
You think my love
Has run out
A lot of nights I've been away
Darlin I only wanted one thing
You say you worried about me
Darlin you don't worry about me
Cause you knew
That I'd find out
Yes you knew
That I'd put him in the ground
You think I don't
Want you now
You think my love
Has run out
The day that I come home
Your bags are packed
You're ready to go
Cause how could I love you anymore
You said, "Why
Won't you let me go?"
Cause I've got
Half a mind
To kill you
And the other half
Is still in love
How I longed to be with you
All those nights I've been alone
But you knew
That I'd find out
Yes you knew
That I'd put him in the ground
You think I don't
Want you now
You think my love
Has run out
I've got
Half a mind
To kill you
And the other half
