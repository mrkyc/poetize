Oh oh oh oh oh ooh
It's fine, I'm not broken cause you're going, it's goodbye
It's our final dance, we're calling it a night
It's last call which means I'm calling for the last time
We're moving on with our lives
I won't be lonely tonight
And I know we're closer to us being over
And there's no coming back to you, it's my last dance with you
When the party's over there's an after party
And there will be an after you, there is an after you
To the after party, oh oh oh oh oh oh
Keep it movin' to the after party, oh oh oh oh oh oh
Keep it movin' to the after party, oh oh oh oh oh oh
Keep it movin' to the after party, oh oh oh oh oh oh
Keep it movin' to the after party
I got no more time for lonely nights, I'm through with you
And this routine that you're showing me is nothing new
You think the music stops because we're not, so untrue
Baby watch me move
I won't be lonely tonight
And I know we're closer to us being over
And there's no coming back to you, it's my last dance with you
When the party's over there's an after party
And there will be an after you, there is an after you
To the after party, oh oh oh oh oh oh
Keep it movin' to the after party, oh oh oh oh oh oh
Keep it movin' to the after party, oh oh oh oh oh oh
Keep it movin' to the after party, oh oh oh oh oh oh
Keep it movin' to the after party
Lights on, let's dance babe our love is gone
They're playing the last song
And I know we're closer to us being over
And there's no coming back to you, it's my last dance with you
When the party's over there's an after party
And there will be an after you, there is an after you
To the after party, oh oh oh oh oh oh
Keep it movin' to the after party, oh oh oh oh oh oh
Keep it movin' to the after party, oh oh oh oh oh oh
Keep it movin' to the after party, oh oh oh oh oh oh
Keep it movin' to the after party
Oh oh oh oh oh ooh
