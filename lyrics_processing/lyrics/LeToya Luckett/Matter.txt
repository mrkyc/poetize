Boy, I'm in love with you and it ain't gon' go away
You got somebody who just ain't gon' cut it, mayne
She don't do what I do, she on her own thing
I wanna look out for you, do all the things she can't, no

Do she wash your clothes? No
Do she cook and clean for you, baby? Oh no
She don't fill the shoes, no
And she don't love you

If she don't love you as much as I do
She don't matter (No), matter (No), matter (No), matter (No)
Matter (No), matter (No), don't matter to me, no
If she don't want you as much as I do
Then she don't matter (No), matter (No), matter (No), matter (No)
Matter (No), matter (No), don't matter to me
She don't love you

Oh, you say it's gon' be cool, I'm caught in such a daze
Torn in between us two, why can't we make amends?
I know I crossed the line but boy you let me go
Knowing what I know now, I shoulda left it so
You might also like
Do she really know you? (Know you)
I wanna know you (You, you, yeah)
If she don't fill the shoes, I want you to choose
Don't want you to lose me, yeah
I want you to choose me, yeah
I'm tryna get you to see
That she don't love you as much as me, yeah yeah

If she don't love you as much as I do
She don't matter (No), matter (No), matter (No), matter (No)
Matter (No), matter (No), don't matter to me, no
If she don't want you as much as I do
Then she don't matter (No), matter (No), matter (No), matter (No)
Matter (No), matter (No), don't matter to me (Yeah yeah)
She don't love you

If there's one thing in this world
That I know for sure it's that I want you more than her
See, we both know, I can't deny
It's boy I need you in my life
I need you in my life, life, life (Need you, baby)
I don't wanna say goodbye, baby, bye, bye
So won't you give this love a try, try, try
I'll give you what you want, I'll be your everything
'Cause baby, she don't mean a thing, oh oh
If she don't love you as much as I do
She don't matter (No), matter (No), matter (No), matter (No)
Matter (No), matter (No), don't matter to me, no (Oh baby, baby)
If she don't want you as much as I do
Then she don't matter (No), matter (No), matter (No), matter (No)
Matter (No), matter (No), don't matter to me
(Oh, you don't need, don't need her, no, oh)
She don't love you

Oh, I love you, baby, oh oh
