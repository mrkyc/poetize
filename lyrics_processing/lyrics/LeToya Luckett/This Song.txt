I wrote a song
Wanna hear it, here it go
I wrote a song
Wanna hear it, here it go
I wrote a song
Wanna hear it, here it go
I wrote a song
Wanna hear it, here it go
I

The perfect melody is in my head
I got a song that's meant for one thing (One thing)
I got the candles lit, I'm rocking my La Perla fit
I'm pouring a glass of champagne (Champagne)
See, I've been planning the right time for me to tell you, baby
But it's better if I show ya
Forget the radio 'cause I already wrote

I wrote this song, this song (Yeah yeah)
Specifically to make love to you, boy, all
Night long, night long
There'll Be no hesitation on my part I wrote
(I said that I wrote) This song, this song (Ooh)
Specifically to make love to you, boy, all
Night long, night long (Yeah yeah)
There'll Be no hesitation on my part I wrote
You might also like
This one's for me
Would you mind if I run it back?
I'll lay my head back, baby, while you handle that
If you give me your best
(Then I promise you, baby, you're next tonight)
I don't need to hear Kells and Marvin (Why not?)
'Cause my body was already callin'
Forget about D'Angelo
(How does it feel?) Boy, I already wrote, oh

I wrote this song, this song (Yeah)
Specifically to make love to you, boy, all
Night long, night long (All night, all night)
There'll Be no hesitation on my part I wrote (On my part)
This song, this song (Yeah yeah)
Specifically to make love to you, boy, all (All night)
Night long, night long (All night)
And there'll Be no hesitation on my part I wrote

(Ooh, ooh) A half an hour ain't nothing
I swear that I ain't through
(Ooh, ooh) 'Cause I'ma keep on lovin', keep on lovin' you
(Ooh, ooh, ooh ooh) 'Cause you make me feel like a sho'nuff woman
(Ooh, ooh) That's what you do, and we don't need the quiet storm
Baby, I wrote this song
I wrote this song, this song (Yeah yeah)
Specifically to make love to you, boy, all
(Specifically to make love to ya)
Night long, night long (All night long)
There'll Be no hesitation on my part I wrote (Oh no)
This song, this song (I said I wrote it)
Specifically to make love to you, boy, all
(Hey, I said I wrote it)
Night long, night long
There'll Be no hesitation on my part I wrote
(Be no hesitation, hey)
This song, this song (Hey, hey)
Specifically to make love to you, boy, all (Hey hey hey)
Night long, night long (Hey, hey, hey)
There'll Be no hesitation on my part I wrote
(Let me hear ya say hey)
This song, this song (Hey, hey)
Specifically to make love to you, boy, all
(Hey hey hey)
Night long, night long (Hey, hey)
