What love can do
What love can do

I'm losing sleep over you
Look what you've done to me
Not saying you ain't the truth
This loves no fantasy
Sometimes I'm so sick of you
I need some therapy
Just like an addict on you
Making no recovery

So, should I stay, should I go?
Do I do, do I don't. Will I will, will I won't?
Do like my momma told me

That's what love can do now I know
Everything just ain't good for you, said I'm feeling like a fool
It's got me so confused oh baby
Maybe that's just what love can do (Love can do)
What love can do
You might also like
See you sweep me off my feet
Then bring me down on my knees
And then occasionally
I'm like somewhere in between
Everytime we get it right we go wrong (we go wrong)
And tell me why does every fight turn me on (On)

So, should I stay, should I go?
Do I do, do I don't?
Will I will, will I won't?
Do like my momma told me

That's what love can do now I know
Everything just ain't good for you, I said I'm feeling like a fool
It's got me so confused oh baby
Maybe that's just what love can do (Love can do)
What love can do

Everytime we fuss and fight
I'm headed for the door
And I know inside that this  ain't right
But it makes me want you more
My friends tell me that I should bounce
Maybe I should just up and leave (Yeah)
But they can't say cause they don't know
Just what you do to me (You do to me)
That's what love can do (Oh, baby)
Everything just ain't good for you
(See everything just ain't good for you)
It's got me so confused (But it feels so good)
Maybe that's just what love can do (Oh, oh-ho, oh-ho)
That's what love can do (That's what love can do to you)
Everything just ain't good for you
(No, everything just ain't good for you, no, no, no)
It's got me so confused (I'm so confused)
Maybe that's just what love can do
