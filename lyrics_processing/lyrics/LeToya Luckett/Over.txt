Over, over

What if I knew you was still keepin' old what's her name around
Then you couldn't say nothin'
And what if you was spendin' up my money taking her out on the town
Then you couldn't say nothin'
What if I knew all the nights you was out you wasn't with your friends
Then you couldn't say nothin'
What if I been done with you and you just didn't know until the end
Don't even try 'cause it would be

Over
If that's the way that you was treating me
It would be over
There would be no need to beg me, baby please
'Cause you, you would know to leave
You, you would know to pack your things
Don't, don't forget your keys, oh, oh
I'm tellin' you it would be over
No get back, no sorry, can't fix that, just over, over

What if I was washin' and found some movie tickets in your jeans
You would try to make up something
And what if you forgot to throw away the gift receipt from Tiffany's
You would try to make up something
What if she was callin' me and tellin' me for months she's been with you
You would try to make up something
What if I had pictures and a DVD of everything you do
It would be no use 'cause it would be
You might also like
Over
If that's the way that you was treating me
It would be over
There would be no need to beg me, baby please
'Cause you, you would know to leave
You, you would know to pack your things
Oh, don't, don't forget your keys, oh, oh
I'm tellin' you it would be over
No get back, no sorry, can't fix that, just over, over

Now if you were the kinda man to risk losing this love we have
You would be crazy, I know
And I know we get tempted but it don't make a difference
'Cause we should be worth a lot more
I put up with a lot, I'ma give it all I got
'Cause hard times only make us closer
Gonna play the fool I'm not
Before you move too far, just stop
'Cause I promise that it'll be over

It would be over
If that's the way that you was treating me
Tellin' you it would be over
There would be no need to beg me, baby please
'Cause you, you would know to leave
You, you would know to pack your things (You would know)
Don't, don't forget your keys, oh, oh
I'm tellin' you, I'm tellin' you, over
No get back, no sorry, can't fix that, just over, over
Over
