Yo, yo
Toya!
Yo, let's go, man
Uh, come on (Oh)
Uh (Oh, oh)

Hello, baby
As I was walkin' by
Hesitated, and then I realized
There go David
I was surprised to see you
And I asked - do you remember me?
Boy, I'm so elated to run into you here
Shadow-faded, with diamonds in your ears
The memories that go, I don't wanna let go
Hear you say you got a girlfriend, but I know

She don't even touch you like this (No)
She don't even kiss you like this (Oh, no)
She don't even treat you like I do
Boy, you know that
She don't even touch you like this (No)
She don't even kiss you like this (Oh, no)
She don't even treat you like I do
Boy
You might also like(Yo, Toya, let's pull up here real quick)

Ooh, I see us makin' plans
Me and you, forget your circumstance
Don't be actin' like me and you don't go way back
Late night, tippin' in your Cadillac
See, I'm no psychic, but I can understand
She's a sidekick, but I know all your fantasies
She can't do it to you like I used to
And you know that I know
That she can't do you like I do, oh

She don't even touch you like this
She don't even kiss you like this (Ooh)
She don't even treat you like I do
Boy, you know that
She don't even touch you like this (She can't kiss you)
She don't even kiss you like this (No, no, she can't treat you)
She don't even treat you like I do (No, no)
Oh, boy, you know that

Look at me and tell me you ain't feelin' me
Boy, you know that I'm the one you need
(Oh-oh-oh, you know)
She's a waste of time, I can love you right
(Boy, you know that)
I already know you want it personal
So, there ain't no need to take it slow
(Oh-oh-oh, you know)
You know your best is your first
So, tell me, why you with her, oh?
She don't even touch you like this (Oh-oh)
She don't even kiss you like this (She can't even kiss you, baby)
She don't even treat you like I do
Boy, you know that
She don't even touch you like this
She don't even kiss you like this
She don't even treat you like I do (No)
Boy, you know that (Oh)
She don't even touch you like this (She tried her hardest, baby)
She don't even kiss you like this (She can't even come close, no)
She don't even treat you like I do
Boy, you know that (Hey)
She don't even touch you like this (Oh, no)
She don't even kiss you like this (There's no room for question, baby)
She don't even treat you like I do
Boy, you know that

Uh-huh, come on
Uh, uh-huh
Ah
Uh-huh, uh, oh
Yeah, let's go at it
