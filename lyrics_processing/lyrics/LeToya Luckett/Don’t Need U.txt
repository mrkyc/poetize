It's Monday morning, checked my cell phone
But nobody's calling me, no
I tried to ignore it but it's sinking in that I'm
I'm all alone with me, whoa

So I stare at your picture for the last time to ease my mind
This time I won't even break down and cry
I had good reason for leaving you, I was never enough for you
You had me downing myself, putting me down, so I

'Cause I'ma keep smiling, I'ma keep it moving
'Cause I don't need you (You), don't need you (You)
Don't need you (You), don't need you
I'ma keep smiling, I'ma keep it moving
'Cause I don't need you (You), don't need you (You)
Don't need you (You), don't need you (You) no more
No more, no more, no more, no more, no more, no more

And baby, I stayed with you so long that I lost myself
Now who would've thought that someone so independent'd become so damn submissive
And sometimes in the back of my mind I'll be missing you, missing you
But I can get through this
'Cause I can do better, so much better
You might also like
So I stare at your picture for the last time to ease my mind
This time I won't even break down and cry
I had good reason for leaving you, I was never enough for you
You had me downing myself, putting me down

'Cause I'ma keep smiling, I'ma keep it moving
'Cause I don't need you (Don't need ya), don't need you (Don't need ya)
Don't need you (No no), don't need you
I'ma keep smiling, I'ma keep it moving
'Cause I don't need you (Oh no), don't need you (No)
Don't need you (You), don't need you no more

'Cause I've been down and out too long
It's time to pick my head up, baby
I'm tired of being fed up, baby
This heartbreak ends today
I'll be moving on
And I won't give up on love, I'll keep on smiling, yeah

'Cause I'ma keep smiling, I'ma keep it moving
'Cause I don't need you (I don't need ya), don't need you
(I don't need ya, no)
Don't need you, don't need you
I'ma keep smiling, I'ma keep it moving (Yeah, yeah)
'Cause I don't need you (You), don't need you (You)
Don't need you (You), don't need you
'Cause I'ma keep smiling, I'ma keep it moving
'Cause I don't need you (You), don't need you (You)
Don't need you (You), don't need you
I'ma keep smiling, I'ma keep it moving
'Cause I don't need you (Yeah), don't need you (You)
Don't need you (No), don't need you no more
