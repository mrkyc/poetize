What are you doing? How did we get here?
What is this feeling? Tell me it's mine (Yeah)
Where did you take me? I want to stay here
What I been missing all of this time (Yeah)
And as I whisper in your ear
Something is changing, I'm unclear
Touchin' and kissin', my body feels different
I've lost my senses

When you find the right spot and take control
And you lock on me and you won't let go
I wasn't ready for all that you had in store
Baby, I want more and more and more
I don't know

What have you got in you, makes me emotional
What is it you do to bring me in tears, tears
'Cause I'm cryin', you got me in tears, tears
Boy, you make feel so warm
I can't describe this mood, I feel so vulnerable
What is it you do to bring me to tears, tears
Got me cryin', you got me in tears, tears
You got me in tears
You might also like
You got me so high, I'm on a rush here
Please baby take me, I wanna go
What's happening now, my vision's unclear
Far from physical, you touch my soul
Don't bring me down, just leave me here
No other feeling can compare
Still touchin' and kissin', my body feels different
I lost my senses

When you find the right spot and take control
And you lock on me and you won't let go (No, baby)
I wasn't ready for all that you had in store
Baby, I want more and more and more
I don't know

What have you got in you, makes me emotional
What is it you do to bring me in tears, tears
'Cause I'm cryin', you got me in tears, tears
Boy, you make feel so warm
I can't describe this mood, I feel so vulnerable
What is it you do to bring me to tears, tears
Got me cryin', you got me in tears, tears
You got me in tears
Hold me, baby, don't let go
I'm speechless, baby, I don't know
What you doin' to me, but don't stop
What you doin' to me, do it to me
Hold me, baby, don't let go
I'm speechless, baby, I don't know
What you doin' to me, but don't stop
What you doin' to me, do it to me

When you find the right spot and take control
And you lock on me and you won't let go (Don't let go)
I wasn't ready for all that you had in store
Baby, I want more and more and more
I don't know

What have you got in you, makes me emotional
What is it you do to bring me in tears, tears
'Cause I'm cryin', you got me in tears, tears
Boy, you make feel so warm
I can't describe this mood, I feel so vulnerable
What is it you do to bring me to tears, tears
Got me cryin', you got me in tears, tears
