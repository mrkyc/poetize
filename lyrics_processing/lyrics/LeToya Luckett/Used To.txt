I cannot lie, I cannot lie
I do this, I do this shit
Come as no surprise
'Cause I get the job done, no pressure
Not playin' games
I know how she movin'
It's clear we don't think the same
Anything that I desire, I'm doin' that
I don't like to share
If she gets you, don't hold me back
Don't compare me to these girls that's soft up in here
This is not arrogance, baby, just bein' clear
Baby I heard...

I put you up on new
Not what you used to
It's what you need though
I, you keep lookin'
But they not me though
For real

Know what you used to
I'm what you need
You're not used to
I'll show you a love that you need
I got you
Not what you're used to
Not what you're used to
