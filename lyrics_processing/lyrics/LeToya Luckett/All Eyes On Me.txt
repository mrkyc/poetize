What it do, hey
Little mama, you a dime piece
In the club, lookin' sharper than a star's crease
It's all eyes on you, baby girl, you outta sight
Nails done, hair did, dress flyer than a kite
I see you skatin' on the dancefloor showin' that
I'm tryin to holla at you, baby, what you tell 'em 'bout it?
I'm on the sidelines plottin', I'ma make a move
'Bout to get my groove on, baby, tell me what it do
What it do?

I got you open, baby
I know you like what you see
You're lookin' at my body
Tryna sneak up on me
I peeped you starin' from the time I walked (Oh yeah)
Through the door
I know you want me, but I came to just hit the floor
