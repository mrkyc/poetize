I don't know
It's not you, it's the ones that hurt me
And I just can't afford to be hurt again
So

Hold on, I'm not really tryna go through this again
I'm not jumping up and down about love and
(It seems if) I don't wanna dive back into that pool of love
I'm done swimming, I'm good
See, I don't feel like getting to know you
What you like you eat and what you like to do
See, that's too much information to deal with
Play the love game with another 'cause I quit

(Don't wanna start over again) 'Cause I've had enough
(I don't wanna hurt again) Sorry, I give up
(Already know what I'm missin') Pain and heartache
I'm tired of it 'cause my eyes are staying dry now
(Don't wanna let another in) 'cause I'm cool on that
('Cause it might happen again) got no time for that
(And it keeps repeating) See, that's insanity
But I'm cured from this disease, can you forgive me?
You might also like
You gotta forgive me, I know it might sound crazy
But right now, my heart's a little lazy
I'm tired of opening up, tired of caring
I don't feel like loving you, don't feel like loving you
You gotta forgive me, I know it might sound crazy
But who knew love could be so drainin'
I'm tired of opening up, I'm tired of caring
I don't feel like loving you, don't feel like loving you no more

Baby, there's something that you gotta understand
It's not your fault but I've changed my plans (Yeah)
And I've said that before
But now it's different, I really mean it
Oh, see the problem is that I've (I've)
Loved so hard and I've got (I've got)
Too burned and I'm not (going down that road again)
'Cause I've found a different route

(Don't wanna start over again) 'Cause I've had enough
(I don't wanna hurt again) Sorry, I give up
(Already know what I'm missin') Pain and heartache
I'm tired of it 'cause my eyes are staying dry now
(Don't wanna let another in) 'Cause I'm cool on that
('Cause it might happen again) 'Cause I got no time for that
(And it keeps repeating) See, that's insanity
But I'm cured from this disease, can you forgive me?
You gotta forgive me, I know it might sound crazy (Crazy)
But right now my heart's a little lazy (Lazy)
I'm tired of opening up, tired of caring
I don't feel like loving you, don't feel like loving you
(I don't wanna give a damn)
You gotta forgive me, I know it might sound crazy (Crazy)
But who knew love could be so drainin' (Drainin')
I'm tired of opening up, I'm tired of caring
(I don't wanna love you no more)
I don't feel like loving you, don't feel like loving you no more

(No, no more, no more, no more, no more, no)
I hope you understand
(No more, no more, no more, no more, no)
I mean I wanna love again
(No more, no more, no more, no more, no)
I just can't do this anymore
(No more, no more, no more, no more, no)
(No more, no more, no more, no more, no)
Oh
(No more, no more, no more, no more, no)
I'm sorry, no more
(No more, no more, no more, no more, no)
No more
(No more, no more, no more, no more, no)
No more
You gotta forgive me, I know it might sound crazy (Crazy)
But right now my heart's a little lazy (Please forgive me)
I'm tired of opening up, I'm tired of caring
I don't feel like loving you, don't feel like loving you
You gotta forgive me, I know it might sound crazy
But who knew love could be so drainin'
I'm tired of opening up, I'm tired of caring
I don't feel like loving you, don't feel like loving you no more

It might sound crazy
My heart's a little lazy, uh, oh baby
You gotta forgive me
