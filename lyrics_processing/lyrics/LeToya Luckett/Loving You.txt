I love you

Don't know why
You still get to me
So easily
All this time
You ain't good to me
No good to me
Oh

Do something for nothing
Fighting like we're enemies
But still lovers
Got me on the front line
On my own babe
This might be the last time
This might be the last time, oh

I leave for the meantime
You call, we fight
Make love in the middle of the night
All in the name of love
We try to hold on
Feels right but so wrong
One time for the breakup
Even when I had enough
I can't stop
Loving you, loving you
Loving you, loving you
Loving you, loving you
Loving you
You might also like
I know there's no remedy
For you and me
Could it be
You're my one
Then you turn around
Showing out
Now we're back
Where we started from

Do something for nothing
Fighting like we're enemies
But still lovers
Got me on the front line
On my own babe
This might be the last time
This might be the last time, oh

I leave for the meantime
You call, we fight
Make love in the middle of the night
All in the name of love
We try to hold on
Feels right but so wrong
One time for the breakup
Even when I had enough
I can't stop
Loving you, loving you
Loving you, loving you
Loving you, loving you
Loving you
Loving you, loving you
Loving you, loving you
Loving you, loving you
Loving you
Said I'm done
I swear about a thousand times
Games you play
Got a girl going out her mind
Said you changed
But you say that all the time
I should let go
But I won't

I leave for the meantime
You call, we fight
Make love in the middle of the night
All in the name of love
We try to hold on
Feels right but so wrong
One time for the breakup
Even when I had enough
I can't stop
Loving you, loving you
Loving you, loving you
Loving you, loving you
Loving you
Loving you, loving you
Loving you, loving you
Loving you, loving you
Loving you
Oh, oh
I'll be loving you babe
