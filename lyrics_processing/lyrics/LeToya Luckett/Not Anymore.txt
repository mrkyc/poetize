This is dedicated to
This, this, this is dedicated to
Hmm...
Well, if you feeling like I'm feeling, this is dedicated to you

Well, I've been the super girlfriend
Let you think that nothing bothered me
Like when you go out with your friends
And people bring me back the stories
The stories about them other girls
'Bout this one, and that one, and those three
So when I ask a simple question (Where were you last night?)
You wanna yell and scream and try to flip it on me

No, no, no (No, no)
Is anybody else just fed up?
If you heard it all before, 'fore, 'fore ('Fore, 'fore)
Then right where you are just get up, eh

Somebody say I don't want it anymore
I don't want it anymore
Somebody say I don't want it anymore
I don't want it anymore
Because I dried my eyes and I realized
I deserve somebody that'll treat me right
Somebody say I don't want it anymore
I don't want it anymore
Somebody say I don't want it anymore
I don't want it anymore
Because I know my worth so you can keep that drama
I don't want it anymore
You might also like
Oh, oh, oh, oh, not anymore

Hmm, no more settling for less
I'm looking for that kind of man that's gonna give his best 'cause I'm giving my best
A man that wants to cherish this, and knows exactly how to move me
Not some silly little boy, who want my goodies 'cause he took me to the movies (Oh, no, no)

No, no, no (No, no)
Is anybody else just fed up?
If you heard it all before, 'fore, 'fore ('Fore, 'fore)
Then right where you are just get up, somebody say

Somebody say I don't want it anymore
I don't want it anymore
Somebody say I don't want it anymore
I don't want it anymore (No-oh, no-oh)
Because I dried my eyes and I realized
I deserve somebody that'll treat me right (Hey, hey)
Somebody say I don't want it anymore
I don't want it anymore
Somebody say I don't want it anymore
I don't want it anymore (Oh, no)
Because I know my worth so you can keep that drama
I don't want it anymore
Oh, oh, oh, oh, not anymore (Not anymore)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, not anymore (Walking out the door)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, not anymore (No, not anymore)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, not anymore (Ooh)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, not anymore (No)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, not anymore (Not no more, not no more)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, not anymore (I'm gone)
Oh, oh, oh, oh (No whoa oh)

This is dedicated to (Said I'm leaving today)
This, this, this is dedicated to (Wipe the tears from my face)
Hmm... (If you feel when I say)
Well, if you feeling like I'm feeling, this is dedicated to you

Somebody say I don't want it anymore (Oh)
I don't want it anymore (No-oh, no)
Somebody say I don't want it anymore

Somebody say I don't want it anymore
