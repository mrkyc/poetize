Listen, whenever you're so close it brings back those memories the way it shoulda been simplest time in my life but you weren't meant for me tears come rapidly
Land although you tell me you love I can't imagine you as part of my day the way my life keeps on changing you need attention I can't do it ur way I gotta go

If I take away love
If I take away love
If I get up leave
Would that be enough
We said we'd let it go take some time to get over us but that jus ain't enough no
Still wanna come around hoping I can make some time
Messing with my mind
