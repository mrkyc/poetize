I wanna know what's on your mind
But baby, I don't wanna talk
I see the fire in your eyes
So, why you holdin' up the wall?
And now, my curiosity is starting to get the best of me
And I'm not worried about who's watchin'
Baby, just put your hands on me

Whenever you move, I'm wit' it
Baby, I will follow
Come out on the floor
I'm waiting on you to take it there
Oh, ah

Boy, you got me
Thinkin' about it
Boy, you got to show me (Show me)
Show me (Show me, yeah)
Time out
For talkin' about it
Boy, you got to show me
Show me
You got to show me
You might also like
You gon' have to show me (Show me, show me)
You gon' have to show me (Show me, show me)
Yeah

If you lead, I'll be up on it
Take your time, we got the floor to ourself (All night)
And ain't nobody cuttin' in
I don't wanna dance with nobody else (Oh no)
Reading the signals that you're sendin'
And I'm giving it right back to you (Mmm, yeah)
Got me exactly where you want me
Time for you to show and prove (Ah, ah)

Whenever you move, I'm wit' it
Baby, I will follow (Yeah, yeah)
Come out on the floor
I'm waiting on you to take it there
Oh, boy

Boy, you got me (Got me)
Thinkin' about it
Boy, you got to show me (Show me)
Show me (Ooh)
Time out
For talkin' about it
Boy, you got to show me
Show me (Baby)
You got to show me
Loving the moves you're makin'
Got my whole body shakin'
Can't wait for you to show me more
You gotta show me (Show me)
Show me (Show me)
Show me, yeah (Show me)

Boy, you got me
Thinkin' about it
Boy, you got to show me (Yeah)
Show me (Yeah, oh)
Time out
For talkin' about it
Boy, you got to show me (Yuh)
Show me (Yeah)
You got to show me
Oh, you got me
Thinkin' about it
Boy, you got to show me (No more talkin', babe)
Show me (No more talking)
Time out
For talkin' about it
Boy, you got to show me (Yeah)
Show me (Yeah, yeah)
You got to show me
{Post-Chorus}
You gon' have to show me (Da-da, dah-da)
You gon' have to show me (Dah, da-da-da-da-da)
You gon' have to show me (Da-da, dah-dah-da)
You gon' have to show me (Show me)
