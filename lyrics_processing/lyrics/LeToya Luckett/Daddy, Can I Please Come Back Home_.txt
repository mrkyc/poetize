I'm so far away from home
I don't know how I ended up here all alone
Seems like just yesterday, everything was alright
How did I get here tonight?

I was raised better than this
Daddy, you don't know how much I miss
All the lessons life taught to you
You tried to tell me so I wouldn't have to go through
I cry myself to sleep (Cry myself to sleep)
Tryin' to find some peace
Your little girl has just one question for you tonight

Daddy, can I please come back home?
Hold me close and never let me go
I wanna say I'm sorry, Daddy, every time I let you down
Can I come home tonight?
Tell me everything will be alright

What am I gonna do, if I can't come home to you?
Am I still Daddy's little girl in this big, bad world?
I'm calling out to you now
Please hear me, some way, somehow

I was raised better than this (Oh)
Daddy, you don't know how much I miss (Yeah, yeah)
All the lessons life taught to you
You tried to tell me so I wouldn't have to go through
I cry myself to sleep (I cry myself to sleep)
Tryin' to find some peace
Your little girl has just one question for you tonight

Daddy, can I please come back home? (Can I come home tonight, oh-oh?)
Hold me close and never let me go (Hold me close, don't let me go, no)
I wanna say I'm sorry, Daddy, every time I let you down (Oh, please forgive me)
Can I come home tonight? (Tell me everything will be alright)
Tell me everything will be alright

I'm tired of gettin' independence
I'm tired of all the dumb pretending
Like I'm someone I'm not
When I'm so doggone lost
I wanna be free from these chains
A virtuous woman, free of pain
I'm calling out to you
Please hear me, some way, somehow
Daddy, hold me
Hold me close and never let me go
I wanna say I'm sorry, Daddy, every time I let you down
Can I come home tonight?
Tell me everything will be alright
Daddy, can I come home tonight?
Tell me everything will be alright
Daddy, can I come home tonight?
Tell me everything will be alright
Daddy, can I come home
