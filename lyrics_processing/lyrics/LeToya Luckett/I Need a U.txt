A kiss on my lips, a hand in my hair
Body to keep me warm while I'm sittin' in this chair
A voice is sayin' no I don't want you to go
I don't want you to leave
A chest to lay my head, your leg between my legs
A whisper in my ear that says "Ooh baby, right here"
A confession, tell me I'm the best
Better than all the rest

And I'm lyin' all alone in my room
Tossin', turnin', don't know what to do
I need a you
I want somebody come ease this pain
Baby please tell me your name
I need a you

A direction I can take, a move that I can learn
A game for us to play, laughin' takin' turns
No losers, winning is guaranteed
I'm so ready for you to teach (I'm so ready)
Time for you to walk through, a sight for your eyes
A bed for you to lay in with the girl that's been waiting
Congratulations, here's your prize
So baby turn off the lights

(I need a you) All night, all day
(You, you) Hurry, I can't wait
I need a you

I don't like bein' alone
I wish you were here with me right now
Whoever you are, wherever you are
Mmm, the things I'd do to you

And I'm lyin' all alone in my room
Tossin', turnin', don't know what to do
I need a you
I want somebody come ease this pain
Baby please tell me your name
