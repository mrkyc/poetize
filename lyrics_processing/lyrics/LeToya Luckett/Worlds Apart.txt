To say "I love you" and mean it
Does that even happen anymore?
I wanted to trust every word
Every word he said
But deep down
I knew
"I love you," he said
"I love you, trust me"
"Just trust me"
Not anymore

I believed
That we had it all
Thought we would last forever
Through the ups and down
I swore up and down you were mine
Never loved anyone like you
But you never gave me a reason to
But that's why I can't find any excuse
To keep holding on to you

God knows I tried
Even turned a blind eye
'Cause I know what I deserve
And I know my worth
That's why I know it's your time
You might also like
Your time to leave
Walk out that door
'Cause love doesn't live here
Live here anymore
You can take everything
Oh but you can't take my heart
You don't need it where you're going
'Cause we'll be worlds apart
Oh, oh, ooh

It's never fair (it's never fair)
Dealing with a heartbreak
I don't wanna wait and see how long it'll take
Ooh to find out we're back to the love that we used to make
You're not really here, no
You're just going through the motions
But I don't need you around
Telling me this is what love is about

God knows I tried
Even turned a blind eye
'Cause I know what I deserve
And I know what I'm worth
That's why I know it's your time
Your time to leave
Walk out that door
'Cause love doesn't live here
Live here anymore
Take everything
Oh but you can't take my heart
'Cause you don't need it where you're going baby
'Cause we'll be worlds apart

Apart
You tore us apart
Oh-ooh-oh
Oh-oh
Ain't no need in coming back baby
No more
(Love doesn't live here)
No more
(Love doesn't live here)
Anymore, anymore
Oh
(Love doesn't live here)
Love doesn't live here
(Love doesn't live here)
Love doesn't live here
Anymore, anymore
Hurt me so bad
Hurt me so bad I can't love you no more
