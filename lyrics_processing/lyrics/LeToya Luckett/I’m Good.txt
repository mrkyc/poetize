Uh, bet you remember how I
Used to put it down
When you used to be my baby
We used to hang out at the crib, or kick it around town
Till you switched the game up on me
You never realized what you had
Now that I'm gone, no, I won't be back
And I can smile 'cause it's so funny
That's what you get for tryna do me shady

And I heard about the chick you had in my car
Should've known the day would come when you would get caught
Never thought that I would ever take it this far
But you know what, you should've stepped your game up, game up
And you can't be mad now 'cause I'm on my G
I'ma play him the same way he tried to play me
Tell me how it feel now
You sittin' lonely, thinkin' bout me, hey?

You know that I'm good
Shorty, we ain't gotta talk about it
Should get off the gas
Man, I wish you would
Go and do that to somebody else
Don't try to run that bullshit on me, on me
I'm good
Shorty, we ain't gotta talk about it
Should get off the gas
Man, I wish you would
Go and do that to somebody else
Don't try to run that bullshit on me, on me

And then he got the nerve to think that I'ma fall back
While he flaunts this chick in my face (My face)
But what he don't know is I really don't care
I don't need that man for nothing
I got my own and I'm not concerned
Quit holdin' on, just let it burn
Can't trust you far as my eyes can see
Made up my mind and it's not changin', no no

And I heard about the chick you had in my car (In my car)
Should've known the day would come when you would get caught (You would've never thought, no no)
Never thought that I would ever take it this far
But you know what, you should've stepped your game up, game up (Mmm)
And you can't be mad now 'cause I'm on my G (Ooh)
I'ma play him the same way he tried to play me
Tell me how it feel now
You sittin' lonely, thinkin' bout me?

You know that I'm good (Please believe that I'm good)
Shorty, we ain't gotta talk about it (No, no)
Should get off the gas (No, no)
Man, I wish you would
Go and do that to somebody else
Don't try to run that bullshit on me, on me
I'm good
Shorty, we ain't gotta talk about it
Should get off the gas (You should)
Man, I wish you would (I wish you would)
Go and do that to somebody else (Hey)
Don't try to run that bullshit on me, on me (Hey-yeah)
I'm good (I'm good)
Shorty, we ain't gotta talk about it (I'm good)
Should get off the gas (And you should)
Man, I wish you would
Go and do that to somebody else (Keep wishin' you would, yeah)
Don't try to run that bullshit on me, on me (Wishin' you could, yeah)
I'm good
Shorty, we ain't gotta talk about it
Should get off the gas (Whoo, you should)
Man, I wish you would
Go and do that to somebody else (To somebody else)
Don't try to run that bullshit on me, on me (Somebody else)
Uh-huh, uh-huh
Uh-huh, uh-huh
But you know what?
