Ain't not a nigga in here that I could want more
But I know what happens if we go down that road
It's hard to measure the risk that we're takin'
Like who'll clean up that mess after we make it?

Hey, I know love can be real
It's the feelin' you feel
Oh babe, now I'm catchin' a wave
Are you feelin' the same?
Oh yeah, ain't no realer than this
Ain't no realer than I
You and I
We can meet somewhere, baby, in the middle
Middle, middle, yeah
I'm in your zone
Tell me if I'm in your mental, mental, mental
Oh, can't leave me alone

Be in my head like ohhh, oh, oh
All in my head, all in my head
Like ohhh, oh, oh
All in my head, all in my head

Can't walk away 'cause you're everything I want more of
Too curious, but I bet you already know though
Can't lie, I ain't tryna be solo
Take your time, we can go all night

Hey, I know love can be real
It's the feelin' you feel
Oh babe, now I'm catchin' a wave
Are you feelin' the same?
Oh yeah, ain't no realer than this
Ain't no realer than I
You and I
We can meet somewhere, baby, in the middle
Middle, middle, yeah
I'm in your zone
Tell me if I'm in your mental, mental, mental
Oh, can't leave me alone

Be in my head like ohhh, oh, oh
All in my head, all in my head
Like ohhh, oh, oh
All in my head, all in my head
We've been down this road before
We don't need to have a reason why
We can't seem to let it go (let it go)
Couldn't avoid it if we tried
All of my friends say don't do it
Keep the nigga to fool with
They don't know just how good it is
Ooh baby I'm feining
We've been goin' all night
Like it's nobody's business
I'm caught in the moment
Even if I regret it

Hey, I know love can be real
It's the feelin' you feel
The feelin' I feel
Oh babe, now I'm catchin' a wave
Are you feelin' the same?
The feelin' I feel
Oh yeah, ain't no realer than this
Ain't no realer than I
You and I
We can meet somewhere, baby, in the middle
Middle, middle, yeah
I'm in your zone
Tell me if I'm in your mental, mental, mental
Oh, can't leave me alone
Be in my head like ohhh, oh, oh
All in my head, all in my head
Like ohhh, oh, oh
