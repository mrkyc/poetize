A part of me wants to leave you alone
A part of me wants for you to come home
A part of me says I'm livin' a lie
And I'm better off without you
A part of me says to think it through
A part of me says I'm over you
A part of me wants to say goodbye
A part of me is askin' why

A part of me wants to leave
But a part of me wants to be here with you
And every time I think that we're over and done
You do something to get me back lovin' you
And you got me just torn

Torn in between the two (Oh yeah)
'Cause I really wanna be with you (I really wanna be)
But something's tellin' me I should leave you alone (With you)
Leave you alone, leave you alone
And you got me just torn in between the two
'Cause I really wanna be with you
But something's tellin' me I should leave you alone
Leave you alone, leave you alone
You might also like
There are some motions when we started out
It was cool, it was everything that love's about
But something happened
'Cause I'm feelin' so burnt out
Because I can't understand you now (Now)
I just can't understand you now (Oh)
A part of me says it's all my fault
A part of me says "he ain't what you want"
A part of me says to get my bags
A part of me says I can't do that

A part of me wants to leave
But a part of me wants to be here with you
And every time I think that it's over and done
You make me fall back in love
You got me just torn

Torn in between the two (Between the two)
'Cause I really wanna be with you (Be with you)
But something's tellin' me I should leave you alone
Leave you alone, leave you alone
And you got me just torn in between the two
'Cause I really wanna be with you
But something's tellin' me I should leave you alone
(Tellin' me I should leave)
Leave you alone, leave you alone
So many times, I
I was ready to go
So many times, I
Had my foot out the door
So many times, I
I thought to give him a chance
Thought he'd be a better man
Now I'm sittin' here and I'm so confused
'Cause I keep fightin' myself for you
I don't know how much more I can take
But I can't feel this way, you got me so torn

Torn in between the two (Oh yeah)
'Cause I really wanna be with you (I really wanna be)
But something's tellin' me I should leave you alone (With you)
Leave you alone, leave you alone (But I don't know)
And you got me just torn in between the two
(Should I stay or should I go?)
'Cause I really wanna be with you (I don't know)
But something's tellin' me I should leave you alone
Leave you alone, leave you alone
You got me just torn in between the two
(I'm torn in between the two)
'Cause I really wanna be with you (I really wanna be with you)
But something's tellin' me I should leave you alone
Leave you alone, leave you alone (But I don't know)
And you got me just torn in between the two
'Cause I really wanna be with you
But something's tellin' me I should leave you alone
Leave you alone, leave you alone
And you got me just torn in between the two
'Cause I really wanna be with you
But something's tellin' me I should leave you alone
Leave you alone, leave you alone
And you got me just torn in between the two
'Cause I really wanna be with you
But something's tellin' me I should leave you alone
