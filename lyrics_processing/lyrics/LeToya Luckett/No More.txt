Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
Ooh oooh
But I'm not gon' cry about it
No more, no more
Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
Ooh oooh
But I'm not gon' cry about it
But I'm not gon' cry about it

Think it over, think it over
When you walked out
Should've told you
That I was half-sleep
Half-deep in an argument that started
When I wanted to know why
You never came over
You said you would come by
I looked for your Rover
But no sign of you all night
No call to let me know what happened
You was acting like I got no right to be asking
You might also like
There you go back out the door
Leaving me lonely like you did before
But I ain't gon' cry no more (no)

Ooh ooh
You know how I feel about you
Don't think I could live without you
But you take advantage of me
Ooh oooh (oh oh ohh)
I'm so sick of being doubted
But I'm not gon' cry about it
No more, no more (I'm not gon' cry about it no more)
Ooh ooh
You know how I feel about you
Don't think I could live without you (you know how I feel for you)
But you take advantage of me (baby)
Ooh oooh
I'm so sick of being doubted
But I'm not gon' cry about it
No more

It's been a long time
Been a slow climb
And I made it, but I hated
Being treated like a burden
When I needed you seemed like
You were always there too late
If you came at all
Too much on your plate
To answer my phone calls
Nobody knows the trouble
With loving you the way I do
But what can I do
There you go back out the door
Leaving me lonely like you did before
But I ain't gon' cry no more

Ooh ooh
You know how I feel about you (you know how I)
Don't think I could live without you (feel about you)
But you take advantage of me
Ooh oooh (you can't take advantage)
I'm so sick of being doubted (see I'm so sick and tired)
But I'm not gon' cry about it
No more, no more (no more)
Ooh ooh
You know how I feel about you (ooh oh)
Don't think I could live without you
But you take advantage of me (don't think I can live)
Ooh oooh (but I gotta do better)
I'm so sick of being doubted (so sick)
But I'm not gon' cry about it (but I'm not gon' cry)
No more, no more (no more)

There will come a day
I'ma find a way
A way to live without you
Ooh ooh
I'm so sick of all the pain
All the hurtful things you say
No more lies
Why can't you tell the truth
Ooh oooh
My heart you're breaking
I keep taking
All this unnecessary pain from you
Ooh ooh
Baby, can't you see you're hurting me
I just wanna love you
But I'm not gon' play the fool no more
Ooh ooh (no more)
You know how I feel about you (no)
Don't think I could live without you
But you take advantage of me (don't think I can live without you)
Ooh oooh
I'm so sick of being doubted (so sick and tired of you driving me crazy)
But I'm not gon' cry about it
No more, no more
Ooh ooh (oh oh)
You know how I feel about you
Don't think I could live without you (you know how I feel about you, baby)
But you take advantage of me
Ooh oooh (and you know how you're driving me crazy)
I'm so sick of being doubted (ohh woah oh)
But I'm not gon' cry about it
No more, no more (I'm not gon' cry no more)

Ooh ooh (oh no)
You know how I feel about you (yeah, I know)
Don't think I could live without you (yeah, I don't think I can live)
But you take advantage of me
Ooh oooh (without you)
I'm so sick of being doubted (baby)
But I'm not gon' cry about it (I'm not gon' cry)
