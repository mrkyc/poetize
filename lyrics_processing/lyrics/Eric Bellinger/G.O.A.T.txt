Shawty bad, slim, thick
She my drug, she my fix
And I'm all up in her mix
She be mixin' with the wrist
She the plug, she finesse
She the one they call the GOAT
She don't stress, she don't trip
And she fuck with all my bros

So if I gotta choose someone
Then it must be her she been here since day one
I guess I'ma have to call her bae
I guess I'ma have to call her bae
I guess we gon' have to go hit London, Paris and Montego Bay
I guess I'ma have to call her bae
I guess she gon' have to scream my name
Now every time that she come to the crib
I'ma break her back like I break that bank
I guess I'ma have to call her bae
I guess I'ma have to call her bae
I guess I'ma have to call her bae
I guess I'ma have to call her bae

I guess, I guess, I guess
It's about time that you get what you need and what you deserve
This love been buzzin' like bees
I'm thinkin' the end, we been through the worst
My sign match your sign
I gotta thank God for the universe
Ain't had a nigga like me, this is new to her
Girlfriends like sheesh, what he do to her?
I'm on, yeah, I'm on
Blast that song, can't do wrong
I sure your ass could agree
She my right hand, no pledge of allegiance
GOAT, yeah, she the GOAT

Niggas from the past wanna take my place
Since they played dumb, I'ma call her bae
