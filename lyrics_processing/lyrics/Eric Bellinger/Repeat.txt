I follow her on her Insta
Then later, you know I slid in her DM's
She went through all of my pictures (You know she was scrollin')
Then you know she showed them to all of her friends
She the one, I know she is
Just had to get to know the kid
Sent the addy where she live
Damn, it's getting serious

She wasn't tryna fall in
At first she curved and all that
Now she can't keep from calling
Soon as I hit it, we did it on repeat

Here's a little story 'bout a woman and man
Who found a love y'all can't understand
You see times have changed, this ain't back in the days
Ain't no VCR's, MCM's all on her page, oh
Usually she hit the no and pass on 'em
Honestly, I don't know what it was
All her friends say he just like the last one
And he probably gon' run off on the plug

She wasn't tryna fall in
At first she curved and all that
Now she can't keep from calling
Soon as I hit it, we did it on repeat
We gon' do this shit every day, repeat
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
You'll be feelin' some type of way with me

She never wanna leave)

On repeat, this shit on repeat right now
On repeat, put this shit on repeat right now
On repeat right now
Yeah, yeah
