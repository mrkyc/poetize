This gon' be your favorite song

Yeah, when you be scrollin' through your cellphone, late at night
We be gettin' our freak on, all night
When you be goin' to the movies, you be frontin'
And we be at the crib makin' movies, me and my woman

I'm done living single
I know I could have 'em all but that ain't the shit that I'm on
I'm done living single
Oh, in a side chick kind of world, I'm glad I got my girl

'Cause it's overrated, overrated, overrated
Overrated, overrated, overrated (I'm done living single)
Overrated, overrated, overrated
Oh, in a side chick kind of world, I'm glad I got my girl

When you be trickin' in the friendzone, tryna get her
I be on one knee in the endzone, my nigga
When she be goin' through your caller ID, tryna see who you textin'
My girl ain't worried 'bout me 'cause she knows she the only one I'm sextin'
You might also like
I'm done living single
I know I could have 'em all but that ain't the shit that I'm on
I'm done living single
Oh, in a side chick kind of world, I'm glad I got my girl

'Cause it's overrated, overrated, overrated
Overrated, overrated, overrated (I'm done living single)
Overrated, overrated, overrated
Oh, in a side chick kind of world, I'm glad I got my girl

I could be up in the club all night
Baby, I'd rather lay here with you
Ain't nothin' out there but them hoes with no loyalty
That's why I fuck with you
Yeah, that's why I fuck with you, baby
That's why I'm in love with you, baby
And Lord knows the sex is amazin'
Girl, why you think you have my baby?
That's why I ain't never lookin' at nobody else but you, baby
That's why I don't give a damn about who's callin' my phone
I change my number every two weeks just for you, girl
See I don't need none of them bitches, no no no, not at all
They can have all the Louis and the Gucci too
But you work for it all, yeah you work for it all, baby
When I come home and the dishes is put away in the kitchen
And my clothes is washed and folded up in the dresser
I know, I know, I know that I'm doin' the right thing, babe
I'm on my Spike Lee shit, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh
