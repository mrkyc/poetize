Yeah, yeah, yeah
Whoa, whoa
This gon' be a favorite song

To all of the girls
Dealing with them no good niggas
Ready to give up on love
'Cause it never seem to work for you (This song for you)
Oh, I know that they get on your nerves
I know they be lying to you
And every chance them niggas get
They be quick to make a fool out of you
But you ignore the signs

Baby girl, you can't hurry love, take your time
There's somebody for you and probably looking for you now
Baby, won't you tell me what's the rush, girl, slow down
You might as well lay low 'cause he on the way for sure
I'm just saying you can't hurry love

So take this time and go and work on yourself
Get your bread up, be a boss, cut a few checks, yeah
Get it to the point where you don't need no one
You don't need no help, you can do it yourself
You don't need shit from a nigga
Be the type of girl we like and I bet he treat you right
Make the rest the best of your life
You still got some time
You might also like
Baby girl, you can't hurry love, take your time
There's somebody for you and probably looking for you now
Baby, won't you tell me what's the rush, girl, slow down
You might as well lay low 'cause he on the way for sure
I'm just saying you can't hurry love

Oh, baby, you can't hurry love
Gotta take your time, make sure he the one, yeah yeah
You find a love that was always meant to be, yeah yeah
He gon' take care of you not only physically but also mentally
Yeah, yeah, yeah
