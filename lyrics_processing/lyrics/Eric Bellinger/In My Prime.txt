I'm on my grind
Every night I flex, they impressed when I'm pullin' up
Phantom every time
Met her once at the club, she was wasted tryna give it up
Give it up, give it up
When it's over, she say baby, hit my line, we could live it up
I ain't gon' lie
Way she drop it and she twist it, make a nigga wanna do his stuff

It's prime time, I'm that 21 Dion, peons want be on what P on
Beyond what you see with TV on, 3's in the T-on
The britches on me, cost a booking fee
To see Lyon, what type of shit we on
We on, me and EB, where we belong
The coldest, you niggas AC need freon
EBM we on, we at where the money be
And all my bitches now sell flat tummy T, know me

You see the money coming

I'm in my prime
I remember those days when a nigga wasn't big enough
Now it's so easy
They be tryna sub tweet me when I don't pick it up
Pick it up, pick it up
Give it up, give it up
Big enough, big enough
I remember when it wasn't so easy

Now I'm the one she callin'
Let it go to voicemail once she got a problem
Roof castle boulevardin'
Yeah, now I'm in the Hills feelin' like Hillary Rodham
Presidential suite yeah, I made it boy
Tryna see the position that you ain't ready for
I could hold you down in the meantime
Don't need to think twice like a metaphor
You could play the main, you could play the side, yeah
You could come and go, you could stay and ride
Either way, you know I make it to it
I seen better days since you get through it
It's for the vibe, my mama, team and my state

Made your way out of nowhere
You see the money coming
How 'bout I throw some your way
We going places you ain't never been, yeah
We doing things that you ain't never did, yeah

I'm in my prime
I remember those days when a nigga wasn't big enough
Now it's so easy
They be tryna sub tweet me when I don't pick it up
Pick it up, pick it up
Give it up, give it up
Big enough, big enough
