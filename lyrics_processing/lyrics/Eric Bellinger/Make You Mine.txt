This gon' be your favorite song

Yeah, they say you no good for me, baby
Your love too wicked and bad
The way you drop, whine it, wiggle it
Girl, it might break my back
So gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme that good thing, oh
Sit down pon my lap
And we could start a conversation

Girl, I wanna kiss and caress, say yes
Put down all my loving, no one contest
When I need a freak, if you freak, say yes
One wicked and bad, bad girl
Tell me, does your mother know?
You're a bad, bad, bad gyal
Tell me, does your father know?
You're a bad, bad, bad gyal

If you give me the wickedest whine
I might take you out sometime
Get back, I won't get behind
Girl, I'ma make you mine
Girl, I might make you mine
Girl, I'ma make you mine
Girl, I might make you mine
Girl, I'ma make you mine, it's Eazy
You might also like
She say she don't do it for the money
She do it 'cause she want my love
If you want it, you gotta work for it
Show me you can play rough
If I give her the jiggy, jiggy
She comin' back with me, can't get enough
There won't be no hesitation

Girl, I wanna kiss and caress, say yes
Put down all my loving, no one contest
When I need a freak, if you freak, say yes
One wicked and bad, bad girl
Tell me, does your mother know?
You're a bad, bad, bad gyal
Tell me, does your father know?
You're a bad, bad, bad gyal

If you give me the wickedest whine
I might take you out sometime
Get back, I won't get behind
Girl, I'ma make you mine
Girl, I might make you mine
Girl, I'ma make you mine
Girl, I might make you mine
Girl, I'ma make you mine
I wanna make you fall in love
I wanna make you be my ting
You're my favorite, you're the one
The way you shake it is everything
I wanna make you fall in love
I see you naked in my dreams

Girl, I wanna kiss and caress, say yes
Put down all my loving, no one contest
When I need a freak, if you freak, say yes
One wicked and bad, bad girl
Tell me, does your mother know?
You're a bad, bad, bad gyal
Tell me, does your father know?
You're a bad, bad, bad gyal

If you give me the wickedest whine
I might take you out sometime
Get back, I won't get behind
Girl, I'ma make you mine

Girl, I'ma make you mine, it's Eazy
Wanna make you, make you, make you mine
