B.A.M (YFS)

Girl, come through and let's do
What we do in your imagination
When I'm gone, show me how you pretend
How do you bend your knees?
How do you arch your back?
How do you scream my name?
When we're in your imagination

I know that you hate how much I be on the road
And how I be workin' late, all night at the studio
I know you're a woman and I know you've got needs
But I know that you'd never, you'd never sneak out on me, no no
So how do you do it when it be like three o'clock in the morn'?
And how do you touch it when you in that bed all alone?
Show me, show me, show me
Show me, show me, show me

Girl, come through and let's do
What we do in your imagination
When I'm gone, show me how you pretend
How do you bend your knees?
(How do you bend your knees?)
How do you arch your back?
(How do you arch your back? Yeah, yeah)
How do you scream my name? (Ay)
When we're in your imagination
You might also like
Do I be all on the top of you? Do you be on the bottom?
And do we use protection? If we do, you know I got 'em, yeah
Do we skip the foreplay? Tell me, do we sixty-nine?
Do you prefer a quickie, or do we go hard all night?
I wanna know what turns you on (I swear I'm dyin' to know, baby)
So I can be all that and more (Oh, oh)

Girl, come through and let's do (Oh, let's do it, baby)
What we do in your imagination (Oh, oh, oh)
When I'm gone, show me how you pretend
How do you bend your knees?
(How do you bend your knees?)
How do you arch your back?
(How do you arch your back?)
How do you scream my name? (Name)
When we're in your imagination (Imagination)

Oh, oh, oh
