So you mean like...
You mean like for real, for real? Or you just like...
I'm just saying 'cause you know I
I'm ready, I'm with it, you feel me
And I mean it

When you say
You understand, you with the plan
You done with him, you trust again
You in love again, you better mean it
When you say
Let's make it work, you'll put me first
You know what I'm worth, fuck what you heard
Give me your word, you better mean it

'Cause you ain't got no reason to lie
If you ain't gon' ride, you could go right now
Go right now, you can go right now
Go 'head, leave, might as well head out
'Cause I ain't got no time for the games
If you gon' play, I'ma call timeout
Call timeout, I'ma call timeout

So keep it one thousand when you say what you mean
And just mean what you say
Girl, just say what you mean
And just mean what you say
If you say that you love a nigga
If you say that you wanna spend all my time
If you say that you want a nigga
It's a whole lot of women waiting in line
I'm just saying that you better mean it
Fuck around and say your name in one of my songs
We could have the whole world singing
First I gotta know that you gon' say what you mean

When I say
When it come to me, you enough for me, you the one for me
Tryna trust again, it's kinda tough for me
Just know I mean it
When I say
I'm done with her, I was made for you
I'm in love with you, I want a son from you, or another you
Just know I mean it

'Cause I ain't got no time for the lies
Use to run plays, couple bands on the side
But baby, you if mine then I'm cutting all ties
To keep it one thousand, you could trust me every time
'Cause I ain't got no time for the games
If you gon' play, I'ma call timeout
See what I'm about, you know I'ma find out
So keep it one thousand when you say what you mean
And just mean what you say
Girl, just say what you mean
And just mean what you say
If you say that you love a nigga
If you say that you wanna spend all my time
If you say that you want a nigga
It's a whole lot of women waiting in line
I'm just saying that you better mean it
Fuck around and say your name in one of my songs
We could have the whole world singing
First I gotta know that you gon' say what you mean
And just mean what you say
Girl, just say what you mean

Just say what you mean
