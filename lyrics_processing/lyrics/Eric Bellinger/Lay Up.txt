Before you got my text, you knew tonight would be the night
Before you made your bed, already made up your mind
Before I picked you up, you was ready to ride
Before you asked me up, I couldn't wait to get inside

This should be a lay-up
I already want you, you already want me
Just come over and lay up
Girl, quit wasting up time, let's see what this could be, oh yeah

You know you want it, my love
Girl, you been waiting for this
Baby, just throw me the pass
Bet I'ma put it right in
Keeping it light on the touch
I see you with the assist
Finally it's one on one
Look at the flick of my wrist
Girl, we should lay up
Girl, we should lay up
Girl, we should lay up
Girl, we should lay up
This should be a lay-up
This should be a lay-up
Girl, we should lay up

Every time I see you, they be perking out your chest
Hair done, nails done, waxed up, who you tryna impress?
It ain't hard to tell that you want me around
Nikes laced up, might as well just do it now

This should be a lay-up
I already want you, you already want me
Just come over and lay up
Girl, quit wasting up time, let's see what this could be, oh yeah

You know you want it, my love
Girl, you been waiting for this
Baby, just throw me the pass
Bet I'ma put it right in
Keeping it light on the touch
I see you with the assist
Finally it's one on one
Look at the flick of my wrist
Girl, we should lay up
Girl, we should lay up
Girl, we should lay up
Girl, we should lay up
This should be a lay-up
This should be a lay-up
Girl, we should lay up
Now you're in the mood
Mood, mood, mood
Now you're in the mood
