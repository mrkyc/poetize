This that true shit
This that true shit, baby
This may not be your favorite song (Nice)
Yeah

If I was to shower you with compliments
If I was to say that you were heaven-sent
Would it turn your confidence to cockiness?
Would you let it get to your head?

I see you with all them likes
But what you finna do with that?
My nigga saw you in person
He said you ain't even look like that
I see you with all them heels
And all them Birkin bags
You stay ordering room service
But you don't be paying for that

What happened to the real women, real women?
What happened to the real women, real women?
They all tryna be bad bitches, bad bitches
I'm speaking to my real women
Where my real women?
Yeah you Instafamous, you Instafamous
They know what your name is, but what about your babies?
What about a career? What about an education?
You ain't even got a job but you stay on them vacations, huh?
You might also like
I ain't trying to judge you
I ain't tryna put you on trial
I'm just stating facts
And some shit shouldn't be allowed
But I blame the niggas
Yeah, I blame the niggas
For getting these hoes excited
When they be posting pictures

I see you with all them likes
But what you finna do with that?
My nigga saw you in person
He said you ain't even look like that
I see you takin' all them trips
I see you only fly first class
But that shit cost a lot so
Explain how you pay for that

What happened to the real women, real women?
What happened to the real women, real women?
They all tryna be bad bitches, bad bitches
I'm speaking to my real women
Where my real women?
Yeah you Instafamous, you Instafamous
They know what your name is, but what about your babies?
What about a career? What about an education?
You ain't even got a job but you stay on them vacations, huh?
Why hate on me?
I'm everybody's woman crush
Don't hate on me
Girl, ain't nobody hatin' on you
Boy, don't hate on me (I'm not)
'Cause I got all these followers
Don't hate
You got the wrong idea
On me
Can somebody tell me?

What happened to the real women, real women?
What happened to the real women, real women?
They all tryna be bad bitches, bad bitches (They tryna be bad but they don't know)
I'm speaking to my real women (Niggas ain't lookin' for that)
Where my real women?
Yeah you Instafamous, you Instafamous
They know what your name is, but what about your babies?
What about a career? What about an education?
You ain't even got a job but you stay on them vacations, huh?

This that true shit
This that true shit, baby
