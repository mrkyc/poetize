It's a whole 'lotta chicks in the livin' room, gettin' it on
And they ain't leaving 'til six in the mornin' (They ain't leavin')
I've been tryna tell 'em, "Leave me alone"
They've been twerkin', it ain't workin', I been curvin' 'cause I'm focused on you
I'm tryin' to get you back to the telly (Telly)
Tryna be your man if you let me (Let me)
Baby girl, you so thick and you look so sweet
I just wanna taste your peanut butter jelly

While I'm feelin' on your body-ody-ody (On your body)
Uh, on your body-ody-ody (On you)
While I'm feelin' on your body-ody-ody (While I'm feelin')
Uh, oochie wally, wally, wally (On you)
You lookin' dangerous
I want you and it's obvious
We could be makin' crazy love
Whole world gon' be hatin' us (Why they hatin?)
'Cause I'm feelin' on your body-ody-ody ('Cause I'm feelin' )
Uh, on your body-ody-ody (On you)
'Cause I'm feelin' on your body-ody-ody (While I'm feelin')
Uh, oochie wally, wally, wally, oh, baby (Yeah)

2 Chainz!
Oochie wally, let me gon' and get it started
Lookin' like a molly dressed in Cavalli
Everythin' I do, it got gold on it
I just ate a three-hundred dollar hamburger
Change over, tell the lane that the game over
At the shootin' range, pinky ring, costs a Range Rover
Uh, do my thang for the pooty tang in the suit
Imagine Superman grabbin' Lois Lane on the booty
Told you from the jump, don't jump to conclusions
If you want a tan, put some sand on your booty
Used to have a tatt of a man on the booty
'Til I covered it up with my hand on her booty

Let me feel up on your body-ody-ody (While I'm feelin')
Uh, on your body-ody-ody (On you, Yeah)
Let me feel up on your body-ody-ody (While I'm feelin')
Uh, oochie wally, wally, wally (On you)
You lookin' dangerous
I want you and it's obvious (True)
We could be makin' crazy love
Whole world gon' be hatin' us (Why they hatin?, Let 'em hate then)
'Cause I'm feelin' on your body-ody-ody ('Cause I'm feelin')
Uh, on your body-ody-ody (On you)
'Cause I'm feelin' on your body-ody-ody (While I'm feelin')
Uh, oochie wally, wally, wally, oh, baby (On you)
I really, really, really wanna work your body (I wanna)
I really wanna make you scream and shout (I wanna)
I really, really wanna give it to you (I wanna)
I really really wanna turn you out (I wanna)
I really, really  wanna work your body (I wanna)
I really wanna make you scream and shout (I wanna)
I really wanna hear you call me papi (I wanna)
I really, really wanna turn you out (Turn you out)

So let me feel up on your body-ody-ody (While I'm feelin')
Uh, on your body-ody-ody (On you)
Let me feel up on your body-ody-ody (While I'm feelin')
Uhh, oochie wally, wally, wally (On you)
You lookin' dangerous
I want you and it's obvious
We could be makin' crazy love
Whole world gon' be hatin' us (Why they hatin?)
'Cause I'm feelin' on your body-ody-ody ('Cause I'm feelin')
Uh, on your body-ody-ody (On you)
'Cause I'm feelin' on your body-ody-ody (While I'm feelin')
Uh, oochie wally, wally, wally (On you)
