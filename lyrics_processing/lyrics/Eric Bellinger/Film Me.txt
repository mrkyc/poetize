You're my superstar and girl, tonight I'll be your groupie
I just wanna make love like they do it in the movies
Violins, harps and other sounds
Softly, gently, lay you down
I'll be the director, baby, you can be the actress
I'll pull out my camera, are you ready? Action
If you don't know what to do now
Let me show you how

First you start by kissing me
Then I grab your hips and we
Fall right back onto the bed, to the bed
Now the plot is thickening
I can hear you whispering
Over and over again

Oh, I love it when you film me
Baby, just film me
Pull the camera out on me
I love being in the spotlight
We can do this all night
Film me, let me star in your movie
You might also like
I got all the props and all the angles in position
Now we in the bedroom, we gon' end up in the kitchen
Pots and pans are falling down
Don't mind 'cause you like it loud
Baby, stay in character, I'ma take good care of ya
All you gotta do is perform for me
You know just what to do now
And so I ain't gotta show you how

First you start by kissing me
Then I grab your hips and we
Fall right back onto the bed, to the bed
Now the plot is thickening
I can hear you whispering
Over and over again

Oh, I love it when you film me
Baby, just film me
Pull the camera out on me
I love being in the spotlight
We can do this all night
Film me, let me star in your movie, oh
Baby, you can star in my movie
I just wanna star in your movie
Baby, come and star in my movie
Baby, can I star in your movie?

Baby, you know I'ma perform
