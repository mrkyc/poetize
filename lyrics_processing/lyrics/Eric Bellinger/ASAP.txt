It's gon' be your favorite song

Ayy girl, seems like I've known you for so long
Even though we just met, I've been waitin' to put you on
I can tell you've got some talent, some talent
But I'm ready for the challenge, the challenge

Let me touch on your body, girl, I know it's soft, huh
And I can't wait to see you with the lights off, uh
So what you say-ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy?
'Cause girl, I need that asap

Girl, I need that asap, asap, asap (I need it)
Girl, I need that asap, asap, asap (I need it, baby, I need it)
Girl, I'm tryna taste that, taste that, taste that (I need it)
Girl, I need that asap, girl, I need that asap, a-asap (I need it, baby, I need it)

Hope I ain't coming off too strong
But I've been single two weeks and I just can't stand to be alone
Girl, I've been so off balance, off balance
And I just gotta have it, have it
