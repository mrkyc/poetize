Come back to the island
Come back to the island with me

Yeah, up in the kitchen in her underwear
22 inches of long wavy hair
She's so petite with her lil caramel skin
She's saucy with some extra seasoning
Still wonder how she keep her ship so tight (Wavy, wavy)
So sexy cooking with the candlelight
So much good energy surrounding us
I ain't gon' lie, she got me so in love

It's a table for two
You're what's on the menu
Wetter than the dishes
Middle of the kitchen

We did that, we did that up on the island
We did that, we did that, right on the island
We did that, yeah, we did that up on the island
We did that and now I'm hooked like a pirate, yeah, yeah

Got that late night special, you should look into my menu
Saw some good reviews and wanna know if they were half true
Curious about the brown sugar up on my apron
Broken dishes on the floor, now we're the decoration
You're loving the way that my bum bum
Be shaking the shit like a pompom
You know who to call when you need that
I break you up like a Kit-Kat
Only your favorite positions
I serve 'em best in the kitchen
And I don't need to tips
Long as you bring that ass back

It's a table for two
You're what's on the menu
Wetter than the dishes
Middle of the kitchen

On the island
We did that, we did that up on the island
We did that, we did that, right on the island
Can't believe we did that on the island
We did that, yeah, we did that up on the island
We did that and now I'm hooked like a pirate, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
