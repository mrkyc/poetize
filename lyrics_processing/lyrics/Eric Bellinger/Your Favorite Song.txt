Oh, woah
Hey, yeah

This that shit you drink your wine to, this that, yeah
This that shit that you unwind to, yeah, oh
When you be up in the bubble bath, taking photographs
Baby, this that shit you put on soon as you get home

It's your favorite song, song
It's your favorite song, song
I know it make you feel some type of way
I know it make you feel some type of way

Take them heels off, let that dress fall
Unstrap that bra, baby
Let your hair down, run that water
Light a candle, it's just me and you
See I know I've been in your head all day, anyway, press play
Said I know I've been in your head all day, anyway, press play
And have your way

When you be up in the bubble bath, taking photographs
Baby, this that shit you put on soon as you get home
You might also like
It's your favorite song, song
It's your favorite song, song
I know it make you feel some type of way
I know it make you feel some type of way

Yeah, I see you
Girl, I see you, yeah
Now you walkin' round the house and you ain't got no clothes on
You still dripping wet but since ain't nobody over
You gon' air dry while you chillin' on the sofa
Drinking that mimosa, girl
Pour it up, faded
Pour it up, gone
Pour it up, faded
Pour it up

'Cause this that shit you drink your wine to, this that, yeah
This that shit that you unwind to, yeah, oh
When you be up in the bubble bath, taking photographs
Baby, this that shit you put on soon as you get home

It's your favorite song, song
It's your favorite song, song
I know it make you feel some type of way
