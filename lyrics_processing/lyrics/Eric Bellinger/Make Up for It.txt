Girl, I've been working all week
I know that you've been missing me on you
I already know you a freak
Ain't no telling what you and me gon' do

Let's not waste no more time
Girl, I'ma make up for it, uh
Baby, let me make up for it, uh
I just wanna make up for it
All night
Girl, I'ma make up for it
All that other shit ain't important
Tonight I'ma make up for it, babe

Put on that song that you like
Girl, this that song that you like
Put on that song that you like
I know this that shit that you like
So let me make up for it

Baby, all I wanna do is each and every part of you
Girl, you gon' get a round for every second spent away from you, oh
You might also like
Let's not waste no more time
Girl, I'ma make up for it, uh
Baby, let me make up for it, uh
I just wanna make up for it
All night
Girl, I'ma make up for it (Ayy)
All that other shit ain't important (No)
Tonight I'ma make up for it, babe
Put on that song that you like (This gon' be your favorite)
Girl, this that song that you like (This your favorite)
Put on that song that you like (This gon' be your favorite)
I know this that shit that you like (This gon' be your favorite song)

This ain't your typical, ordinary, make-up love
This the kind of love you want me to give to you
Over and over and over
Girl, you gon' start fights with me
Tripping on me for no reason
Just to get closer and closer and closer
Whatever it takes to be alone
Whatever it takes to get it on
Whatever it takes for your body to be on top of my body
I won't hurt you on purpose
But if I do, it'd be worth it
Whatever it takes for my body to be all up on your body
