Cuz I just wanna love you, baby
I don't wanna waste no time
Wanna be your only one, baby
Please don't break my heart


All these stars out
And these people know my name
I can be so pretentious
But he likes, all the same
And these lights are glowing
But he don't want none
He rather chill and hug me
Baby, he could be the one

You want me to trust you
But how can I trust you
When I don't know the first thing about that
There's so many questions
And I don't wanna listen
Messing with my heart and I just got it back
I just wanna love you, baby
I don't wanna waste no time
Wanna be your only one, baby
Please don't break my heart
You might also like
I've been here before
I don't know if you're the type
Who's gonna be keep me sure
When the dark creeps in my mind
Will you be there baby?
Or will you let me go?
Can you stand the pressure?
This is what I need to know

You want me to trust you
But how can I trust you
When I don't know the first thing about that
There's so many questions
There's so many lessons
And I need for you to have my back
I just wanna love you, baby
I don't wanna waste no time
Wanna be your only one, baby
Please don't break my heart


Don't break it
Please, don't break my heart
No, don't break it
Please, don't baby
I just wanna love you, baby
I know it from the very start
Wanna be your only one, baby
Please don't break my heart
You got me living on a prayer
You could be a millionaire or broke
We won't pretend
You know you're more than a friend
Just because you love me
Imma love you 'til the end
I got you
You got me
I like you
You like me
And we could do everything
I wanna love you, oh, baby, baby, baby
Don't break it
Please, don't break my heart
No, don't break it
Please, don't baby
Cuz I just wanna love you, baby
I don't wanna waste no time
Wanna be your only one, baby
