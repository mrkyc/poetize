To tell you how I felt right into the blue
Then I would tell, the time my heart felt
And I would probably say that it was a quarter to two
The time was nice, but it was far spent
You sent me flying then we both agree that time became the enemy
Of moments, I'm holding on to the next one
And if the sun should go away from here
It don't matter, cause with you I shine
And if these clouds, keep you from coming near
It don't matter, you're already mine
And that's all that matters, that matters, that matters
It wouldn't matter, cause baby you're mine
And that's all that matters, that matters, that matters
No one can take away what's yours and mine
If there's a name, for our type of story
I'll call it the days of our lives the age of a star and a guy
So built to last (to last), beyond glamour and glory
So easy to do, so easy to be, connected inside
I get to put (I get to put) his name right by mine now
It's kind of cool to give your all or nothing to
Someone who makes you love in these
Moments, keep rolling onto the next one, ooooh
You might also likeAnd if the sun should go away from here
It don't matter, cause with you I shine
And if these clouds, keep you from coming near
It don't matter, you're already mine
And that's all that matters, that matters, that matters
That's all that matters, cause baby you're mine
And that's all that matters, that matters, that matters
No one can take away what's yours and mine
Who makes love like this anymore
Instant enduring, your eyes still alluring, my love
Won't let you go
Holds us together through stormier weather
It's gold, and so if the sun
And if the sun should go away from here
It don't matter, cause with you I shine
And if these clouds, keep you from coming near
It don't matter, you're already mine
And that's all that matters, that matters, that matters
All that matters, cause baby you're mine
And that's all that matters, that matters, that matters
No one can take away what's yours and mine
And now we sit and wonder where life went
Of all the moments I've missed
