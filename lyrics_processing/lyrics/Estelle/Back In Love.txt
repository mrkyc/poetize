Love was simple at the start
We thought that was all
Somehow we got lost
And now what we had before
Together we made music
It was like the sweetest song
The melody so strong
We played it all day long
I know
Nothing ever stays the same
We all grow
Even if our love should change
You should know
That I don't ever want you to leave
Don't go
Don't go
Promise you won't ever go again
Now that you love again
Now that you love again
Say this love will never ever end
It's better than its ever been
Now that you love again
You might also likeNow we took it back
To where we started off and I
I see that you're exactly what I needed in my life
This goes longer
We'll go stronger till we get it right
Gets better everyday
Sweeter every night
When we fight
I know you never mean to say the things you say
We go back and forth
And then you walk away
Every time you go out the door, I cry
Say our love will never die
Promise you won't ever go again
Now that you love again
Now that you love again
Say this love will never ever end
It's better than its ever been
Now that you love again
Babe, I'm so glad you came back
You know, you never know how things turn out so
To prove to you I'm being real, listen...
Wanna live
Forever with you
Together with you
I'm better with you
I'll go
Do whatever with you
I'm livin' for you
It's what i wanna do
Have faith
That i am the one
The one that you want
We've already begun
This love
Is something we made
I won't throw away
I want you to stay
Promise you won't ever go again
Now that you love again
Now that you love again
Say this love will never ever end
It's better than its ever been
