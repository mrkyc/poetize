It's a queen, she used to wearing crowns
She gonna lead, cannot back down
No, don't you test her
No, you caress her
If you are a king then a king should respect
It's a queen, she used to wearing crowns
She gonna lead, cannot back down
No, don't you test her
No, you caress her
If you is a king then a king should respect

If you're a man, you gotta know
How to treat a beautiful woman
I lead and I don't follow
And these sayings are more than some bottles
I was born with a plan for tomorrow
And my days stay on full, ain't no high-low
I'm a leader and I don't know less
Everything I do is for the progress
It's more, more, more than you ever see
More, more, when I walk in them streets
Real goddess and a mi reign supreme
If you king and you recognize queen
You might also like
It's a queen, she used to wearing crowns
She gonna lead, cannot back down
No, don't you test her
No, you caress her
If you are a king then a king should respect
It's a queen, she used to wearing crowns
She gonna lead, cannot back down
No, don't you test her
No, you caress her
If you is a king then a king should respect

Woman, real impression and the king feel happy
Real goddess, that's what she embodies
All she really needs is freedom, spiritually
Wear the crown, nuh bow down to nobody
She is more than what you see in the magazines
Can't frighten her with Benz and Lamborghinis
I respect it longer than ten limousines
More than just beautiful legs and those jeans
She is more, more, more than you ever see
More, more, and when she walks in the streets
Real goddess and she now reign supreme
If you're a real king and you know she's a queen
It's a queen, she used to wearing crowns
She gonna lead, cannot back down
No, don't you test her
No, you caress her
If you are a king then a king should respect
It's a queen, she used to wearing crowns
She gonna lead, cannot back down
No, don't you test her
No, you caress her
If you is a king then a king should respect

Na na na na na, oh, na na na na na
Real queens, no, fa la la la la
You the rest of all I want, everyday
Na na na na na, oh, na na na na na
Girl, you a leader, fa la la la la
No, you the rest of all I want

It's a queen, she used to wearing crowns
She gonna lead, cannot back down
No, don't you test her
No, you caress her
If you are a king then a king should respect
It's a queen, she used to wearing crowns
She gonna lead, cannot back down
No, don't you test her
No, you caress her
If you is a king then a king should respect
Queen, ooh, ooh
If you is a king then a king should respect
Queen, ooh, ooh
