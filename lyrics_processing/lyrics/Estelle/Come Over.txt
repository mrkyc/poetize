If I was to tell you just how much I need you, would you come tonight?
Would you not believe me 'cause a love that easy never turns out right?
I'm trying to change the rules, you deserve something good in your life
We've waited for far too long so come get your blessings tonight, baby

Won't you come over love? So I can show you love
Promise I got enough to give you all that you need, baby
So many search to find love that's as good as mine
I will not waste your time so bring it all to me, baby
Ooh, ooh, ooh, bring it all to me, ooh, ooh, ooh

Baby let me teach you, give you love instruction, show you what I know
We should take it easy, ain't no need to rush, no, baby, nice and slow
All this love I can give to you, I expect just a bit in return
You don't have to be perfect love as long as you're willing to learn, baby

Won't you come over love? So I can show you love
Promise I got enough to give you all that you need, baby
So many search to find love that's as good as mine
I will not waste your time so bring it all to me, baby
Ooh, ooh, ooh, bring it all to me, ooh, ooh, ooh

Won't you come over love? So I can show you love
