I was hurt for so long
Doesn't matter who was right
Doesn't matter who was wrong
All that matters is I'm back where I belong, yeah
Got back up 'cause I was down
I was lookin' everywhere in the wrong way, babe
But then I opened up my eyes and I realized, yeah

I got somethin' good for you, baby
I got somethin' good for you, baby
I got it, I got it
I got it, I got it
I got somethin' good for you, baby
I got somethin' good for you, baby
I got it, I got it
I got it, I got it


For the rest of my life
All this good I've got to use
Ain't nothin' more to lose
I feel better now I'm back where I belong, yeah
Gotta think 'bout my love
There's a price you've gotta pay
Can't control the way it gets
Higher, higher, higher every day
Yeah, come on
