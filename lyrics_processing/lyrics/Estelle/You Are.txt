Every little-
Every little-

The first time I met you
You were so quiet and cool you
Never thought that you would kiss my heart the way you did
All of the sadness in passing
Making me feel like I'm past it
But you really end in the sweetest way

Oh, I'm so commended by you
All in my music, all you
Do you keeps me surfing on the hook that we can be together, are you?
I hope you listen to this
I hope you get to feel this because everything is you
Come on

Come close to me
Only your love can do me
Every little thing I do you are
Baby, you know your special
I don't care what the rest do
Every little thing I do, you are
You might also like
If love had a face then it's you
Made for me, how did you know?
The best type of love and, ooh, I'm so glad that you thought of me
If there's anything I can do, let me know I'll be a fool
But don't take advantage 'cause I will hate to have to leave you

Your touch makes me feel like a woman
Takes me beyond feeling human
When you touch me, ooh, the smell of you drives me crazy
When we're alone, it's beautiful
Makes me not want to leave you, no
Everything is you

Come close to me
Only your love can do me
Every little thing I do, you are
Baby, you know your special
I don't care what the rest do
Every little thing I do, you are
Come close to me (come on)
Only your love can do me
Every little thing I do you are
Baby you know your special
I don't care what the rest do
Every little thing I do you are
Oh, when your lying next to me
I can't believe you're next to me
It's only us in this moment
No interruptions, we're focused
Tell you, I'm glad I risked it
God knows that I would've missed this
You're so amazing baby, everything you do

Come close to me
Only your love
Everything little thing I do, you are
Baby, you know your special
I don't even care about the rest
Everything little thing I do, you are

Baby
Oh, you are
Baby, you are
Baby, you are
