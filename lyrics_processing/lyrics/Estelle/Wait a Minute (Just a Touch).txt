Baby boy, let's make it special
I'ma have it my way, right now you get just one touch

My love's so professional
Just because were kissin', don't mean were undressin', no
You ain't creepin' and suggestin' those
Freaky little things we could do 'cause the answers no
Baby I got let you know
If and when the time comes for me and your sex is slow
Wrap it up 'cause I ain't carryin' your embryo
You're starin' at a women that would slap your ass to the flo'
Damn, you say "I ain't right"
But you keep comin' back 'cause this girl is tight
You ain't spendin' the night
Uh-uh after were done here it's back to the wife
Yeah, I know it feels so nice, swing by for some love and that
It's so special, all you get to get is just a touch
