Wonder why, wonder why, wonder why
Why must we pretend?
Why can't we be more than friends?
Let's be more than friends

What are you afraid of?
We've been playing games love
Together we crazy, good I mean baby
So why you gotta change up?
Baby when we make love, in ways I never made love
Feels so real, but something still is missing from the picture
Everywhere I go, people wanna know
Wonder where I been, what's the deal with him
Is y'all really cool, is he just a friend
Now I'm asking you, tell me what it is
Look me in my eyes, you don't have to lie
Must think I'm a fool, fucking around with you
Need to give me proof I need to hear the truth
I just got one question for you

Wonder why, wonder why, wonder why
Why must we pretend?
Why can't we be more than friends?
Let's be more than friends

I think you see me as your play thing
Your Friday to Sunday thing
I'm not your weekend love, your secret fuck
Brother I'm not playing
And if I wanted to be part time
I'd be working at the check-out line
At the liquor store, the picture show
Let me give you piece of my mind
Why don't you put your arms around me huh?
Acting different when your friends around
See nah, when we together we fire
And no I never tell my friends your a friend
You're my guy we're together uh huh
Calling my phone about we needed a break?
How we gonna break up when we ain't willing to date?
You say you want that real woman, when you get her you run
How come I never met the family like your dad and your mum?
And I don't wanna hear it, stop being a bitch
You making me respect you less, I'm really starting to switch
You're saying that and this and you're heart broken
Yeah, you sound like shit like you're taking a piss
Somebody wanna see ya chick, ya see the problem with this is
I'm waiting in vain, I'm waiting for you to change
We ain't kicking it No, we ain't chilling NO
We ain't doing a ting blud
I'm more like a full time thing
See fam you got your own sock drawer
You can call me much more
More than just your friend much, more than before
Don't play me like an extra, I got speaking roles
I am not that hoe, I am so much more
I wonder why

Wonder why, wonder why, wonder why
Why must we pretend?
Why can't we be more than friends?
Let's be more than friends
Don't act like I'm tryna press you
It's just you know
It's obvious, it's all there, like
What you waiting for
(why can't we be more than friends, let's be more than friends)
Stop pretending
(let's be more than friends, let's be more than friends)
You know we more than friends

You know it's me and you
(Why can't we be more than friends?)
C'mon, yeah, sing
(More than friends, more than friends)
Why can't we be more than friends?
Let's be more than friends
