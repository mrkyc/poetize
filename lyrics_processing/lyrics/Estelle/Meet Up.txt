I wonder if no one tells you you're special
I hope that I can fill in where they lose
Been tryna tell you since I really met you
'Cause I've been thinkin' 'bout lovin' on you

Don't bother with that, you ain't attach
Come through
So we could cut the chat

(Meet up) I'm on my way, I ain't tryna waste no time no-no-no
(Meet up) Link up, link up, uh-huh, it's a link up, link up

I hope you see that you're so fucking special (so special)
I wouldn't risk this for nobody trash
There ain't no emojis in my phone to tell ya
I've been thinkin' 'bout you grippin' my ass (ass)
