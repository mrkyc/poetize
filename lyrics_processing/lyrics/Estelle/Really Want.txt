Yo, I already know my intentions
So not a one word of a mention
Feel the sexy wild tension
Doesn't know what I really want

When you walked up to me in the club
Said I looked like I'm 'bout it
And you wanted to wind in the corner
Said the floor is too crowded
That's when the gropin' and the hopin' start
Tryna find a way into my open heart
And if you sayin' that's what you want
Then do somethin' 'bout it

Don't have to say it
I know what you really want
Baby stop playing
I know what you really want

Yo, I already know my intentions
So not a one word of a mention
Feel the sexy wild tension
Doesn't know what I really want
You might also like
You know I be tugboat it
Action
You ready fi start movin'
Mi see upon your face, you are born rollin'
And if ya' do want me ta little, you can lonely
Wind up on it
First thing, well if you do
Then you save the number, when meet a you
Then we link you up, when we partied on
If you want the touch, when me call you, come, uhm-mm

Don't have to say it
I know what you really want
Baby stop playing
I know what you really want

Yo, I already know my intentions
So not a one word of a mention
Feel the sexy wild tension
That's a no what I really want

Actions speak louder, you're loud and clear
Show me that style, yeah that's how me like it
Actions speak louder than words
For real, come and give me what me deserve
Wind on me, waist like a go-go
Hands on my body, boy don't lose control, no
Me I give the love in the real life
They say I real like
No conversation, just make it feel right
We know how the world can go
Find you so set it up, anywhere we can go
This I know the small thing, your daddy jumbo
Boom boo doom boo doom bi ti, like a Congo
Some come now

Don't have to say it
I know what you really want
Baby stop playing
I know what you really want

Yo, I already know my intentions
So not a one word of a mention
Feel the sexy wild tension
That's a no what I really want

Don't have to say it
Oooh, I know what you really want
Baby stop playing
I know what you really want

Yo, I already know my intentions
So not a one word of a mention
Feel the sexy wild tension
