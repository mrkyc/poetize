Uh

Everybody put ya fists in the air now
Bounce like ya feet are fitted with springs and (Ah)
It's the start, the start of the New Year
Get out ya boots, get ready to start this here
Get out ya house do somethin' with yourself
Put down the weed, prove somethin' to yourself
This is out to the ladies and gents tryna do for themselves
They ain't waitin' on nobody else
You could say that this life is a laugh
I would say it's cool but we here it a lot
So, fix up be true to yourself
Save up for a ring or a belt or
Year's young and the night's are blazin'

You wanna easier life?
You should go to Iraq and talk about love, listen
You might also like

Begging to people, never good for your health (Free)
Don't have to kill no one or have to steal from no one

Ain't nothin' to make a change or two
Nothin' to nothin' to break chains through with you
Hear you're spittin' 'bout a penthouse view
Nothin's changed, you're lookin' up from a rent house, dude
Ballin' somethin' that the boys go through
Yo 'Stelly, this living is what the boys half do
Don't think about being less than yourself
Lemme see what come through fresh cuts
Stella your free, you're gonna throw these up, up
Blow seas up, tell a rude boy up
Better stay on the ground 'til ya times up, up
Make ya mind up, up, never gonna be left behind

The negative, the yeah, the hand prevail
Estelle, hail Mega, we do this for real

This is a dog eat dog world
But it belongs to the man
But it's not without the love of a woman's understanding
Hurting ourselves for no reason that you have
Was already yours anyway
If you see somebody, I want you to smile instead of frown (Oh)
Just because they look angry
Don't mean they wanna beat you down (Let's calm down, take some time off)
And it don't cost you nothing, but you pay for a gun (Let's remember this story)
Kill our sisters and sons, people, we need to be (But on the flip side)
