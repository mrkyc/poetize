Speaking of Christmas spirit, each year out in Hollywood, California, they have what they call a Santa Claus parade. A few years ago while I was riding in this parade, I saw smiles on thousands of faces, both young and old alike, waiting for a look at that most popular man all over the world
I can hear them shouting now
"Here comes Santa Claus
Here comes Santa Claus
Here comes Santa Claus..."

Here comes Santa Claus
Here comes Santa Claus
Right down Santa Claus Lane
Vixen and Blitzen and all his reindeer
Pullin' on the reins
Bells are ringin', children singin'
All is merry and bright
So hang your stockings and say your prayers
'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight

Here comes Santa Claus
Here comes Santa Claus
Right down Santa Claus Lane
He's got a bag that's filled with toys
For boys and girls again
Hear those sleigh bells jingle jangle
Oh, what a beautiful sight
So jump in bed and cover your head
'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight

That it's Christmas morn again
Peace on earth will come to all
If we just follow the light
So let's give thanks to the Lord above
'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight
