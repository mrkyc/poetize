There was never any limit
Never any power
Stand up then I listen
Never knew how
You could call me in the middle
Of everything that's been
Stand up and I listen
To you and I begin

And now you, you can call me up
And now you, you can call me up

How many days in
I never knew how
You could wait until the moment
That you have any doubt
Can't let you go on talking
And you can talk back
'Cause never any limits
The way you goin'
Turn up and I listen
Through everything you said
I know there's a limit
I looked into your head
So I continue calling
And there was no way back
Can listen to every minute
There way no way back now
You might also like
And now you, you can call me up
And now you, you can call me up
And now you, you can call me up
And now you, you can call me up

(Ooh) You can call me up, you can call me
(Ooh) You can call me up, you can call me
(Ooh) You can call me up, you can call me
(Ooh) You can call me up, you can call me

There was never any limit
Never any power
Stand up then I listen
Never knew how
You could call me in the middle
Of everything that's been
Stand up and I listen
To you and I begin

And now you, you can call me up (Waited a long time to tell you)
And now you, you can call me up (Waited a long time to tell you)
And now you, you can call me up (Waited a long time to tell you)
And now you, you can call me up (Waited a long time to tell you)
(Waited a long time to tell you)
(Waited a long time to tell you)
(Waited a long time to tell you)
