Tell me all your secrets, your secrets, your secrets
Tell me all your secrets, your secrets
Cause I really don't think, really don't think there's any way
Make me a believer, believer, believer
Make me a believer, believer
Cause I really don't think, really don't think there's any way

The rain keeps falling in the dead of the night
The man keeps calling in the dead of the night
Awake 'til morning in the dead of the night
All your finer feelings won't give up 'til it's light

Tell me all your secrets, your secrets, your secrets
Tell me all your secrets, your secrets
Cause I really don't think, really don't think there's any way
Make me a believer, believer, believer
Make me a believer, believer
Cause I really can't think, really can't think of another way
We can keep on pushing, keep pushing, keep pushing
We can keep on pushing, keep pushing
Cause money's gonna come, money's gonna go anyway

The rain keeps falling in the dead of the night
The man keeps calling in the dead of the night
The lion's roaring in the dead of the night
All your finer feelings won't give up 'til it's light
The end is coming in the dead of the night
Their eyes are watching in the dead of the night
The wheels are turning in the dead of the night
Keep running through the dark as the snake starts to bite
