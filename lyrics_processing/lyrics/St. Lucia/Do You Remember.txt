Do you remember the way it felt
When I was walking in the middle of you, yeah
We got to talking, I played it nice
Do you remember now, feeling it twice, yeah
Gave up the talking, gave up the blues
I don't know what you think, but baby, it's true now
I don't have time for, to thank you twice
Here's why I could never look into your eyes

But we can't pretend that times don't change
All the pieces have been rearranged

Innocent hearts right in the middle of it
Innocent hearts, sign and deliver
You want to believe it? You'll have to go slow
Innocent hearts, time is a ticking
But we're making a start, look in the mirror
The lines getting deeper, but what do you know?

Do you remember the way it felt
When I was walking in the middle of you, now?
I'll stop pretending that I played it nice
Do you remember now, feeling it twice?
You might also like
But we can't hold back from the light of day
And keep on with secrets and make up the meaning
And we can't hold back 'til the light escapes
We'll lean on the secrets cause we know the meaning

Innocent hearts right in the middle of it
Innocent hearts, sign and deliver
You want to believe it? You'll have to go slow
Innocent hearts, time is a ticking
But we're making a start, look in the mirror
The lines getting deeper, but what do you know?
Innocent hearts right in the middle of it
Innocent hearts, sign and deliver
You want to believe it? You'll have to go slow
Innocent hearts, time is a ticking
But we made a good start, look in the mirror
The lines getting deeper, but what do you know?
If you want to believe it, you'll have to go slow
