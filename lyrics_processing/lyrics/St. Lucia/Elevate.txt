I don't know how you do it
But somehow you always will be there
And there's nothing to it
But somehow you always understand
There's no way to wake up now
Too many times I saw you cry
And no one can make up it
You wait for the sun to make the sky

And no one elevates you, elevates you now
No one's gonna take you, gonna take you there

All this time, never thought I would see you smile
Know that I and I know that I see you now
But I know I can't walk in
Never go back again
No matter how, tonight
I'll never go back, never go back again

And no one elevates you, elevates you now
And no one's gonna take you, gonna take you there
And no one elevates you, elevates you now
And no one's gonna take you, gonna take you there

You know that I want to get away
And I cannot wait for another day
You know that I want to elevate
Time to pick it up and celebrate
You know that I want to get away
And I cannot wait for another day
You know that I want to elevate
Time to pick it up and celebrate

And no one elevates you, elevates you now
And no one's gonna take you, gonna take you there
And no one elevates you, elevates you now
And no one's gonna take you, gonna take you there
Hold on to your heart

You know that I want to get away
And I cannot wait for another day
You know that I want to elevate
Time to pick it up and celebrate
You know that I want to get away
And I cannot wait for another day
You know that I want to elevate
Time to pick it up and celebrate
Hold on to your heart

You know that I want to get away
And I cannot wait for another day
You know that I want to elevate
Time to pick it up and celebrate
You know that I want to get away
And I cannot wait for another day
You know that I want to elevate
Time to pick it up and celebrate
Hold on to your heart

You know that I want to get away
And I cannot wait for another day
You know that I want to elevate
Time to pick it up and celebrate
You know that I want to get away
And I cannot wait for another day
You know that I want to elevate
Time to pick it up and celebrate
You know that I want to get away
And I cannot wait for another day
You know that I want to elevate
Time to pick it up and celebrate
You know that I want to get away
And I cannot wait for another day
You know that I want to elevate
