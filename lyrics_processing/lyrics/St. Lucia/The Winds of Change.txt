All my life I waited patiently
Just to see if there's a place for me
In the black light, I found a different way
Hold me close before we drift away
Talk to me into the night again
Show me things I never want to see
When we go there, I'm gonna do it my way
Finally will we know who we are?

We felt the winds of change
And you thought everything would stay the same
We felt the winds of change
You'll do whatever not to go insane
We felt the winds of change
And you thought everything would stay the same
We felt the winds of change
And we'll be walking down the road again
We felt the winds of change
And you thought everything would stay the same
We felt the winds of change
You'll do whatever not to go insane

Talk to me right through the night again
Tell me things I never want to hear
When we go there, I'm gonna do it my way
Finally, we're gonna know who we are
You might also like
We felt the winds of change
And you thought everything would stay the same
We felt the winds of change
You'll do whatever not to go insane
We felt the winds of change
And you thought everything would stay the same
We felt the winds of change
And we'll be walking down the road again

We felt the winds of change
And you thought everything would stay the same
We felt the winds of change
You'll do whatever not to go insane

Leave me alone, leave me alone
Leave me alone, leave me alone
Leave me alone, leave me alone
Leave me alone, leave me alone
Leave me alone, leave me alone
Leave me alone, leave me alone
Leave me alone, leave me alone
