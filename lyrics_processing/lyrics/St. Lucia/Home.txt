You don't ever talk to me and everybody knows about it
How come no one told me that something's wrong?
You don't ever talk to me anyway
The night comes around and you ain't making any bones about it
How come no one told me the light was off?
There will be no guarantee, we will make it over
Cause the light's all around and you ain't telling anybody about it
But I don't like to be torn away
Oh, when you look at me
They say the fight's on the ground but there's a lion in the cage and it's silent
Whatcha think I did when they sold me off?
There won' be no guarantee, we will make it over

But you can call your friends and you can call your family out to the road
You can tell them you're going home, home

I did not expect for nearly everyone to know about it
I was always thinking about myself
When you look in the mirror, do you see something better?
But when life knocks you down, is there a spirit that you talk to about it?
I look in the mirror and ask myself
Can there be a guarantee we will make it over cause
You might also like
You can tell your friends and you can tell your family now that you know
You can tell them you're going home, home

And you, you don't know one thing that makes it right
And time, baby, like a thief running through the night
And no, no, you will never be the same after tonight
Cause time, baby, like a thief will steal away your life
Oh darling, please
You'll never be a lover
You'll never be the one for me
You're not the one for me
No, you'll never be the one for me

Oh baby, you can call your friends and you can call your family now that you know
That there's a difference when you're waiting for a life that's never there 'til it's gone
Oh, we'll take it baby
I will never call you crazy, I will never ask you for more
