Can you tell me? (tell me)
Can you tell me? (tell me)
Why not me? (Why not me)
Am I too ghetto for you? (ghetto)
Do I have "player" written across my forehead? (hell no)
I wanna say some things that I know you heard (you've heard)
Baby, I know you've heard these things before
But why not me, babe?

Why not me?
Is that I'm too ghetto for you?
Why not me?
Girl, there's nothing I won't cop for you
Why not me?
I'm here to give you all your dreams
I'm dedicated
No time to wasting
I'll fulfill your every need

It ain't a thing
I'm far from a lame
Girl, it's all to the good
You're by yourself, I'm all alone, and we're both from the hood
You're playing hard to get now
That's probably why you're by yourself now
But I caught your eye when you walked by and you persist to try To entertain all of them things that you probably just heard
None of it's true, it's all made up baby and that's my word
Baby don't believe a thing you hear now
The haters are always on my back now
But you feel me and this I know
So won't you just let go
Tell me why

I'd like to think I'm a good guy so tell me why not me
Can't blame you though if all your ex-boyfriends did you shady
But don't take that out on me, girl
Oops, I got to take it back, it's your world
Baby I'm just that guy, I'll show you why
If you just give me one try
You tell me lying, I'm telling you "I don't get down like that"
Can't play the role or play myself
Just to get in that (for sure)
I got a little money (for sure)
I spit game to the honeys
But you're all a nigga needs
I won't give you chicken feed
Why not me?

You should tell me something, something
Can't imagine me just wanting
Put your cards out on the table
Baby, I'm willing and able
Picture that me dipping on you
What's the use if I'm up on ya
I'm the one you searched so long for
Give me one chance, you'll want no more
