Baby I got many problems (problems)
But my momma won't help me solve them (solve them)
So I come to you (you, you)
But your ass don't wanna be bothered
So I come around trying to be down
But you're acting like a silly clown
Asking me for fifty dollars
Saying to myself "I'll be damned!" (I'll be damned)
Why you trying to give me such a
Very very hard time
When I spend the money on you
I can't get a little Bump 'n Grind
It must be another man (man)
Holding your hand (hand)
Please tell me baby (baby)
I will understand (stand)

I'm tryin to go on without you here in my life
I don't wanna accept the fact that you're no longer mine
Just to know that somebody else is holding and kissing you
It makes a guy like me feel like I'm a fool
So...

I'll do anything
Anything you want
Yes my word is bond
Baby I was wrong
Please forgive me
For what I've done, I'm sorry
I'll do anything
Anything you want
Yes my word is bond
Baby I was wrong
Please forgive me
For what I've done, I'm sorry

Is there something that I can do to reassure
That I won't hurt you like this anymore

Anything you want
