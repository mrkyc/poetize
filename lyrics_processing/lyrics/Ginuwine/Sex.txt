I want to feel you close to me
And never will I wanna let you go
The feeling of love
It's something that I need
And this is something that you gotta know
See You already know the kind of girl I am
Need a mean long stroke and a video cam
Cherry gloss, high heels I entice my man
Making love by the tub playing one of your jams
Then in front of the mirrors watch me work the pole
Then I work you on a chair till I reach my goal
When I bring you to the floor let you take control
See me down while you dig yeah this thang is gold
My weakness, pretty N****s with big sticks
I do tongue tricks, start running our own porno flicks
Turn you on like a light switch, hard as a brick
Cuz you never how I'm moving and it's extra thick
I have you anywhere bed floor or chair
And you can spank me hard and pull my hair
You see its all for you I ain't the type to share
Though you got dick for days and I got ass in spades (Ol')
