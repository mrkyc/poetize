(I just don't know what else to say baby
There's really nothing left to say
There's really nothing more I can say
But I love you, listen;
Yeah...
I love you...
I love you...
Listen)

Since you came inside my life
You've given me the best of you everyday and night
I felt my happiness in you
Make me wanna ride to the end of any valley
Then you give me piece of mind
You bring me comfort to my soul give me such a high
No I will never let you go
Make me wanna fly to the top of every rainbow

I love you more everyday
You show me love in every way
There's nothing left for me to say
But I love you
I love you more everyday
You show me love in every way
There's nothing left for me to say
But I love you (more and more everyday)
