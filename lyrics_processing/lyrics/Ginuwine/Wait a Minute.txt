My pager rings, I pick it up and you tellin' me that your girl peeped me (Uh-huh)
In my Range Rover, rollin' down the ave, pumpin' out my new hits
I think to myself it's cool, so I keep reading
And it's you sayin' that she saw me cheatin' (Uh-huh)
Now I'm all confused, baby, then I get a grip
It's just a little thing that I'm dealin' with
Why she hatin' on me? I don't really know what this is all about
But I'm finding out
Then my mind wanders, start thinking back at the party when she was all up in
All up in my face, up on me
Grabbing on my arm
And telling me things and how she was the bomb
Now, for me, it's clearer
That instead of you, you don't see the truth, but she wants me near her (Say)

Now, don't believe a thing your girl say
She wanna have what you have, all it is is jealousy
Baby, put your trust in me
She really wants to ride my pony
But you're the one I'm giving it
You're the one I'm living with
Givin' all my stuff and shit
So why you wanna doubt our love?
Don't let her take our world
Before you question me, you need to check your girl
Tell me, why you lookin' that way
'Cause she is all alone
And wishing what is yours, she can have alone
She done dished out more than she can take and her ass can't handle it
But you're my woman and we're one and I'm not having it
But it's alright (It's alright), yes, it's okay (It's okay)
I know you believe in G and I'm sure you can see the truth in me (I'm sure you can see the truth in me, baby)
Wait a minute, don't you hear me, baby? (You heard me?)
It's gon' be alright, we don't have to fight
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (We don't have to fight or fuss no more, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (I know you got your eye on me, yeah, yeah, yeah, you heard me?)
Wait a minute, don't you hear me, baby? (Uh, don't you hear me?)
It's gon' be alright, we don't have to fight (Don't you love me?)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Oh, yeah, baby)
