What we gonna do right here, haha
Is take you way back
Way back into time, haha
My man Ginuwine, ugh
For all y'all people
Out there
Vibing to this beat
It's done by me
Now, Ginuwine, speak
Ugh

Dig if you will the picture
Of you and I engaged in a kiss
The sweat of your body covers G
Can you my darling
Can you picture this?

Dream if you can a courtyard
An ocean of violets in bloom
A nigga like me strike curious poses
I feel the heat
The heat between me and you
See Ginuwine LiveGet tickets as low as $180You might also like
How can you just leave me standing?
Alone in a world that's so cold? (So cold)
Maybe I'm just too demanding
Maybe I'm just like my father too bold
Maybe you're just like my mother
She's never satisfied (She's never satisfied)
Why do we scream at each other
This is what it sounds like
When doves cry

Touch if you will my stomach
Feel how it trembles inside
Now you've got the butterflies all tied up
Don't make me chase
Even doves have pride

How can you just leave me standing?
Alone in a world so cold? (World so cold)
Maybe I'm just too demanding (maybe maybe)
Maybe I'm just like my father too bold (too bold)
Maybe you're just like my mother
She's never satisfied (She's never satisfied)
Why do we scream at each other (why)
This is what it sounds like
When doves cry
Ooh ooh ooh - baby

How can you just leave me standing?
Alone in a world that's so cold? (a world so cold)
Maybe I'm just too demanding
Maybe I'm just like my father too bold (you know, you know he's too bold)
Maybe you're just like my mother
She's never satisfied (never satisfied)
Why do we scream at each other (why)
This is what it sounds like
