As the day goes by i'm always thinkin of your face
Your hair your eyes your sweet lips and the way they taste
You got me goin on high that i have never felt
A beautiful thing (not like the same thing)
This thing we've got it so amazing what i love the most
Is how we can talk and how we laugh and the fact we're so close
It's no illusion but it's magic no tricks involved
With you i got it all

I'm in love i'm in love
Do you hear me
Was so scared not prepared
But it just hit me
Glad it's us now i'm good
I'm so in love
I'm in love i'm in love
And it's a good thing
Many miss out on things
Real lover's bring
Glad it's us now i'm good
I'm so in love

In my mind i'm in a world alone just you and I
Your my eve and im your adam so let's start new lives
'cause the way you make me feel it's like a new begining girl
In all different ways (so many different ways)
You have been with me for my past and the mistakes i've made
You was still strong and had my back now the foundations laid
And I wanna spend the rest of my life just fulfilling you
With everything you want everything you need
