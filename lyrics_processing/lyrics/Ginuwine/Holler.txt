I'm bout to holler coz I need ya
Baby lookin hungry so I guess I gotta feed ya
Peep me in the club, body tingling by the hour
Taking shots of bacardi, sipping on midori sours
Flower power coming straight from the daisy
Nothing like D'angelo but yes I am a lady
Maybe we could take your pony for a ride
I'm slippery when wet so hold onto my sides

Baby Holler...If you want me
Baby Holler...If you hear me
Baby Holler...If you want me
Baby Holler...If you need me
It ain't no thing just call my name
I'll be right there coz nuthin's changed
I'm still in love with you I'm sprung
You're my baby-boo
Girl I'm tellin you
Girl you drive my train you rule
I'm your pet tell me what to do
Girl I'm good in my heart I'm real
Girl you turn me on with your sex appeal
See Ginuwine LiveGet tickets as low as $180You might also like
(All you gotta do is scream and holler babe)
(C'mon and call me, I'll be right there, Yes I will)
I'll be there cuz I'm your man
Sure to give you all I am
Give you all I got to give
Girl I'm feelin' you hope you feel me too
Have no limits, What I do
Is strictly for just pleasing you
No need to doubt please have no fear
Girl I'm wanting you and I'll be right here

(All you gotta do is scream out my name, yes you do)
(All I gotta do is see you and I'll come running)

You make me wanna holler Ginuwine like the leather
Tickling my fancy tryna get my kitty wetter
I betcha like to hold your breath when you swim
Get a dose of nicotine from Mrs. Virginya Slim
And when you're through puffin you can butter up my muffin
Now I wanna bump n grind from the front n
Move to the back yeah I like it like that
