She pulls me down, starts whispering
Some words that start exciting me
And instantly I feel gratitude
Do I deserve this gift, this woman who
Just told me something every man wants to hear
And I'm so lost for words, but she made it so clear
That it's not a fantasy, it's real
What you hear is how I feel
I lost control, those words she said to me

This is more than a (ugh), more than I'm thinking
More than a (ugh), she wanna have my baby
I think she love me, yeah I think she love me
Cause she keeps sayin'... leave it in
This is more than a (ugh), more than I'm thinking
More than a (ugh), she wanna have my baby
All she needs is a man like me
Who can give her love... and leave it in

When she said those words, I looked in her eyes
This is what she felt with no compromise
She enlightened me, gave me more self worth
To trust in me to bring life from this earth
She's everything that every man wants, my baby
So how can I hesitate and not do what she asks me?
It's not a fantasy, it's real
What you hear is how I feel
I lost control, those words she said to me
