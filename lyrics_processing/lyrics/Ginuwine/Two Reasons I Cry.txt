Yes
I've been through a lot of things, and-
I lost my mom and lost my dad
The pain never goes away
And there are only two reasons that I cry

Two reasons I cry
'Cause my daddy's gone and my momma's
Gone
And I'm all alone-I'm so all alone
There are two reasons I cry
'Cause my momma's gone and my daddy's
Gone
And my heart is torn-I'm so all alone
There are two reasons I cry
'Cause daddy's gone and momma's
Gone
There are two-

Daddy, I miss you
It's hard to cope with my life
Didn't want to go on without you daddy
(still at night I cry)
I still can't understand
Why did you have to leave me
Why couldn't I just have seen all your pain (now I blame myself)
I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy
Ccause when your parents are gone its hard to believe
That this is part of life-that you must go on
They would want you to still be strong

Momma when you left, felt like my soul had gone
I still remember the day, had no words to say-my heart was gone (Still at night I cry)
You were the reason I lived
You gave me life that was pure
Always kept me so sure of everything (I miss you so much)
I looked down on you and no one ever knew
I almost took my life so I could be with you
I miss you, so one could never know
And I'm lost and I'm feeling so alone
