You know baby
I know alot of people are against you
All the ladies in the world
But you can do whatever you set your mind to do
Can't no one stop you
Believe that

It's time, now's the place, do your thing, it's your world
Don't be scared, its your world, don't trip, shout it out
You're the bomb, don't be scared, its your world

I can't begin to feel the agony I know you feel
I'm tryin' to break you out of that mold that once was real
But you're grown up and now it's time to let go all your fears
It's time for you to go
Its time for you to live
You've been under your parents
But they can't live for you
You got to go and do
What's best for you
Make your decisions and live by them and sweat and bleed
You must struggle to be you
Even when you're in need
