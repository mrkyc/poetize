If you cheated on him (Can you feel this?)
How I know you ain't gon' cheat on me? (Bom, bom, bom, bom, yeah)
I need to tell you something (Uh)
Check this out (Ginuwine, check)

You say you love me (Uh)
But at one time you loved him
So what's so different? (Uh-huh)
Tell me if you were in my shoes
What would you do or think of me?
Would you trust me?
But you feeding me all this rap about
How it's different, but it's not mentioned
What you're doin' is wicked
Now I'm having second thoughts about
You and me, 'cause this not
How I want it or it should be

You say you want my trust and
Told me you were leavin'
How am I to know that you won't do it to me?
You're tellin' me it's different
But what the hell is different?
If you cheated on him you'll do it to me
You're creepin' on him for me
But you say, "Just trust me"
How am I to know that you won't do it to me?
You're tellin' me it's different
But what the hell is different?
If you cheated on him you'll do it to me (Check this out)

Like the saying goes, you reap what you sow (What?)
And what goes around comes back around
To you five times harder
And I'm pretty sure that he's thinkin' (Say what?)
That you're totally his
But you're here in my rimmed-up drop top wit' me
All hugged up and all over me
Kissin' all of me
Is that to get me where you want me to be?
Don't want this to happen to me (No, no)
So I'll drop you off, go back to your man
'Cause really, this ain't me

Told me you were leavin'
