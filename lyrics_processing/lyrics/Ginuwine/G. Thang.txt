You wanna battle the unbattable, ha
I hit you with the Hong Kong fu, I smack ya
One, two, ha
Hey partner, you don't really want these beats from the streets
Cuz they stomps like sneaks
You be dry cheese so I sneeze
Around my door
Let's take it to the dance floor
Yo? Yo yo yo
Crank it up some more
This is for my chessit and my rose

Come here shorty, hey
Girl you're lookin' fine
I heard your searchin' for a real love
And I'm really Ginuwine
I come to move your body, hey
Keep it jumpin' like a party, hey
Come on everybody
Were gonna do it my way

It's a G thang, hey
Came to party till the break of dawn
Watch my speakers bang
Until daylight comes and we wanna go home
See Ginuwine LiveGet tickets as low as $180You might also like
I like me a buzz hey, hey
But I don't want to smoke a weed
Why smoke a box of Philly Plums
When she can get high on G
Go pick up a girlfriend
They can ride in my benz
Cause I'm taking everybody
Where G likes to party


Set it off on the left ya'll
Set if off on the right ya'll
Set it off
Set it off by subjection
Set it off on the right ya'll
Set it off, set it off

This rack will wreck you from the day till the dawn
Like Bennie and the Jets blew the spot for Elton John
You can catch me bustin loose like my man Richard Pryor
Or can call me Kato Kaelin cuz I'm really just a buyer
Achoo, god blessin you, and anyone that whips up mine
Butter lyrics built like this from my man Ginuwine
Got you open like the gasp of before the episode
