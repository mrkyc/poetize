Listen, its been a while since i've talked to you
And you've talked to me
So this girl is especially for you and i
Why can't we sit by the fireplace and play telepathy
I want to read your mind and see if your
Thinking about me
It's been a while since i sat down and
Express the way that i feel
But i'm about to cry it's too late and the pain is real
And its too much to bear
And i'm so awfully scared
I need someone who feels me
I need someone who loves me
*chorus*
Why don't i stay awhile with you
We can confess what we've been through
To one another to each other
There's nothing i'll keep from you
Why don't you reach and grab my hand
I'll be one who understands
You can count on me
I won't do you wrong
I'll be here with open arms
(you can count on me
I'll be here with open arms)

Me that you're so hurt
Your insinuations are screaming to me that you're really hurt (so hurt)
I want to be your mechanic and fix
Everything that is wrong
For you be crying and feeling so down baby thats so wrong
And it's to much to bear
You seem so awfully scared
You need someone who feels you
You need someone who loves you
*chorus*
We'll need no more
We'll have each other and love will endure
No pain just love
With you that's all i see and i think of
And for you i'll give my right and left arm
I'll forever be the man that won't do you wrong
Forever love you
That's no question
You're the one girl
I'm confessing (i'm confessing)
*chorus*
You can count on me
I'll be here with open arms
Oh yes i will yes i will
