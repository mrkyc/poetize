He saw me coming across them cotton rows
He was seventy-eight and I was twenty-one
Feeling guilty for who I'd become, and
Then the toughest man I knew pulled me close
He said son no matter what you've done, you gotta know
It ain't that you fall but that you get back up
Life's more about faith, that it is about luck
Man makes a living by the work he does
But he'll leave his mark cause of who he was
My boots have walked that road so son remember
Every saint has a past, and every sinner has a future
See I never knew the cane he raised he was a man of God a man of faith
He said, Let me tell you bout the way I used to be
I run from the law and I'd run shy
I've had some bar-room brawls and a shotgun bride
Till one night in a tent revival I hit my knees
It ain't that you fall but that you get back up
Life's more about faith, that it is about luck
Man makes a living by the work he does
But he'll leave his mark cause of who he was
My boots have walked that road so son remember
Every saint has a past, and every sinner has a future

Losers cheats and thieves
Who were changed so there's hope for you and me
It ain't that you fall but that you get back up
Life's more about faith, that it is about luck
