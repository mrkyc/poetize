(Talk fast)

I don't wanna think about a moment with you
I'm kinda hopin' for forever
I've been dreaming 'bout a knitted sweater for two
Goddamnit, we look good together

Would you wait a moment?
They're ringing the bell for last call
Would you wait a moment?
Just give me a second, that's all

Oh-oh, talk fast, romance
Oh-oh, it won't last, I'm okay with that
Oh-oh, burn, crash, romance
Oh-oh, I'll take what I can get from you
Talk fast, romance
Oh-oh, it won't last, I'm okay with that
Oh-oh, burn, crash, romance
Oh-oh, I'll take what I can get from you
You might also like
Leave all of your indecisions with you at home
Don't say you're doin' me a favour
Why so complicated, won't you throw me a bone?
I want your love in every flavor

Would you wait a moment?
They're ringing the bell for last call
Would you wait a moment?
Just give me a second, that's all

Oh-oh, talk fast, romance
Oh-oh, it won't last, I'm okay with that
Oh-oh, burn, crash, romance
Oh-oh, I'll take what I can get from you
Talk fast, romance
Oh-oh, it won't last, I'm okay with that
Oh-oh, burn, crash, romance
Oh-oh, I'll take what I can get from you

Oh-oh, oh-oh, ringing the bell for last call
Oh-oh, oh-oh, ringing the bell for last call
Oh-oh, oh-oh, ringing the bell for last call
