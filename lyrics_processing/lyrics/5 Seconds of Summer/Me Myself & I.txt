I guess, I guess I got what I wanted
I never knew what I needed, leave it
Up to me to fuck it up without a good reason
I know, I know that it was my own fault
I never picked up that phone call, oh, Lord
All these broke hearts, but mine's the one bleeding

Bullshit I feed myself
Me and my selfish appetite
I did not need your help
Now it's just me, myself, and I

La-la-lie, la-la-lie, la-lie-lie
Now it's just me, myself, and I
La-la-lie, la-la-lie, la-lie-lie
Now it's just me, myself, and I

Guess, I guess I got what I wanted
I never knew what I needed, leave it
Up to me to fuck it up without a good reason
I know, I know that it was my own fault
I never picked up that phone call, oh, Lord
All these broke hearts, but mine's the one bleeding
