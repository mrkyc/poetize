When the girls, when the girls talk
When the girls talk boys
Oh, when the girls, when the girls talk
When the girls talk boys, hey

When you're talking to your girls
Do you talk about me?
Do you say that I'm a sweetheart?
Do you say that I'm a freak?
Do you tell them white lies? (Hey)
Do you tell them the truth?
Do you tell them that you love me
The way that I been lovin' you?

'Cause every night, you and I find ourselves
Kissin' and touchin' like no one else
Fallin' and fallin' until I fell
For you

'Cause I been talking to my friends
The way you take away my breath
Is something bigger than myself
Is something I don't understand, no, no
I know we're young and people change
And we may never feel the same
So, baby, tell me what you say (Hey!)
When the girls, when the girls talk (Oh)
When the girls talk boys (I can hear 'em talking, I can hear 'em talking)
Oh, when the girls, (When the girls) when the girls talk
When the girls talk boys (Hey, hey)
