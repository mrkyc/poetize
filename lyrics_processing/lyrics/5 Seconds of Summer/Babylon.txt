Higher, higher, higher

I thought we had a place, just our place
Our home base, my headspace
Was you and I always
But that phase has been phased in our place
I see it on your face, a small trace
A blank slate, we've been erased

But if we're way too faded to drive
You can stay one more night

We said we'd both love harder than we knew we could go
But still, the hardest part is knowin' when to let go
You wanted to go higher, higher, higher
Burnt too bright, now the fire's gone
Watch it all fall down: Babylon

Babylon
We burnt too bright, now the fire's gone
Watch it all fall down
You might also like
I'm tired of the feud, your short fuse
My half-truths are not amused
I wish we had a clue to start new
A white moon, no residue
The colour of our mood is so rude
A cold June, we're not immune

But if we're way too faded to fight
You can stay one more night

We said we'd both love harder than we knew we could go
But still the hardest part is knowin' when to let go
You wanted to go higher, higher, higher
We burnt too bright, now the fire's gone
Watch it all fall down: Babylon

Babylon
We burnt too bright, now the fire's gone
Watch it all fall down

We said we'd both love harder than we knew we could go
But still, the hardest part is knowin' when to let go
You wanted to go higher, higher, higher
We burnt too bright, now the fire's gone
Watch it all fall down
We said we'd both loved harder than we knew we could go
(Than we knew we could go)
But still, the hardest part is knowin' when to let go (To let go)
You wanted to go higher, higher, higher (Higher, higher, higher)
We burnt too bright, now the fire's gone
Watch it all fall down: Babylon

Babylon
We burnt too bright, now the fire's gone
