Find me at a quarter to three, cigarette in my hand
I'd be at every party, I wouldn't miss a chance
New friends again and again, gone when the morning comes
Demons I tried to defend, but I couldn't get enough

Fadin' away, fadin' away
Wake up to someone with nothing to say
I'd never change, thought I'd never change
Then you come and change it all

With your love, your love, I'm a better, better man
With your love, your love, I'm a better, better man
Darlin', all of my wrongs, they led me right to you
Wrapped in your arms, I swear I'd die for
Your love (Ooh), your love (Ooh), I'm a better, better man

Hmm-mmm, hmm-mmm
Hmm-mmm, hmm

Thought I'd found the highest of highs
You came and topped them all
You shine in the dead of the night
And I was the first to fall
You might also like
Fadin' away, fadin' away
Wake up to someone with nothing to say
I'd never change, thought I'd never change
Then you come and change it all

With your love, your love, I'm a better, better man
With your love, your love, I'm a better, better man
Darlin', all of my wrongs, they led me right to you
Wrapped in your arms, I swear I'd die for
Your love (Ooh), your love (Ooh), I'm a better, better man

Hmm-mmm, hmm-mmm
Hmm-mmm, hmm
Hmm-mmm, hmm-mmm
Hmm-mmm, hmm

You're the only one who could lock this wild heart up in chains
You're the only love that can make this bad man better
You're the only one who could lock this wild heart up in chains
You're the only love that can make this bad man better

With your love, your love, I'm a better, better man
Oh, with your love, your love, I'm a better, better man
All of my wrongs, they led me right to you
Wrapped in your arms, I swear I'd die for
Your love, your love, I'm a better, better man
With your love (Ooh), your love (Ooh), I'm a better, better man
With your love (Ooh), your love (Ooh), I'm a better, better man
Darlin', all of my wrongs, they led me right to you
Wrapped in your arms, I swear I'd die for
Your love (Your love), your love (Your love), I'm a better, better man

Hmm-mmm, hmm-mm
Hmm-mmm (Love), hmm (Your love)
Hmm-mmm (Love), hmm-mmm
(I'm a better, better man)
Hmm-mmm (Love), hmm-mmm (Your love)
Hmm-mmm (Love), hmm (Your love)
