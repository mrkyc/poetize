Do it, do-do it, d-do, do-do-do-do-do

She's a good girl, she's daddy's favorite
He's saved for Harvard (He knows she'll make it)
She's good at school, she's never truant
She can speak French (I think she's fluent)
'Cause every night she studies hard in her room
At least that's what her parents assume
But she sneaks out the window to meet with her boyfriend
Here's what she told me the time that I caught 'em

She said to me, "Forget what you thought
'Cause good girls are bad girls that haven't been caught
So just turn around and forget what you saw
'Cause good girls are bad girls that haven't been caught"

Well, she's a good girl, a straight A-student
She's really into all that self-improvement
I swear she lives in that library
But if you ask her she'll say ("That's where you'll find me")
But if you look, then you won't find her there
She may be clever, but she just acts too square
'Cause in the back of the room, where nobody looks (Nobody looks)
She'll be with her boyfriend (She's not reading books)

Do it, do-do it, d-do, do-do-do-do-do
Good girls are bad girls and good girls are bad girls
Do it, do-do it, d-do, do-do-do-do-do
Good girls are bad girls and good girls are bad girls

She's a good girl (She's a good girl)
Hasn't been caught (She's a good girl)
She's a good girl (She's a good girl)
Hasn't been caught

She said to me, "Forget what you thought
'Cause good girls are bad girls that haven't been caught
So just turn around and forget what you saw
'Cause good girls are bad girls that haven't been caught"
She said to me (She said to me), "Forget what you thought
'Cause good girls are bad girls that haven't been caught
So just turn around (Just turn around) and forget what you saw
'Cause good girls are bad girls that haven't been caught"
Woah
Good girls are bad girls that haven't been caught
Woah
Good girls are bad girls that haven't been caught
Woah, woah
