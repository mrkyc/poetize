Everybody's got their demons, even wide awake or dreaming
I'm the one who ends up leavin', make it okay
See a war, I wanna fight it, see a match, I wanna strike it
Every fire I've ignited faded to grey

But now that I'm broken (Now that I'm broken)
Now that you know it (Now that you know it)
Caught up in a moment (Caught up in a moment)
Can you see inside?

'Cause I've got a jet black heart
And there's a hurricane underneath it
Trying to keep us apart
I write with a poison pen
But these chemicals moving between us
Are the reason to start again

Now I'm holdin' on for dear life (Now I'm holdin' on for dear life)
There's no way that we could rewind (There's no way that we could rewind)
Maybe there's nothin' after midnight that could make you stay

But now that I'm broken (Now that I'm broken)
And now that you know it (Now that you know it)
Caught up in a moment
Can you see inside?

'Cause I've got a jet black heart
And there's a hurricane underneath it
Trying to keep us apart
I write with a poison pen
But these chemicals moving between us
Are the reason to start again

(Oh-oh, oh-oh)

The blood in my veins is made up of mistakes (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Let's forget who we are and dive into the dark (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
As we burst into colour, returning to life (Oh-oh, oh-oh)

'Cause I've got a jet black heart
And there's a hurricane underneath it
Trying to keep us apart
I write with a poison pen
But these chemicals moving between us
Are the reason to start again

The blood in my veins is made up of mistakes
To start again
