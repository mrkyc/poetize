They would yell, they would scream, they were fighting it out
She would hope, she would pray, she was waiting it out
Holding onto a dream while she watches these walls fall down
Sharp words like knives, they were cutting her down
Shattered glass like the past, it's a memory now
Holding onto a dream while she watches these walls fall down

Hey, mum, hey, dad, when did this end?
Where did you lose your happiness?
I'm here alone inside of this broken home
Who is right? Who's wrong? Who really cares?
The fault, the blame, the pain's still there
I'm here alone inside of this broken home
This broken home

Wrote it down on the walls, she was screamin' it out
Made it clear she's still here, are you listenin' now?
Just a ghost in the halls feelin' empty, they're vacant now (Oh)
All the battles, all the wars, all the times that you've fought
She's the scar, she's the bruises, she's the pain that you brought
There was life, there was love like a light and it's fading out

Hey, mum, hey, dad, when did this end?
Where did you lose your happiness?
I'm here alone inside of this broken home
Who's right? Who's wrong? Who really cares?
The fault, the blame, the pain's still there
I'm here alone inside of this broken home
This broken home
You might also like
You've gotta let it go
You're losin' all your hope
Nothin' left to hold
Locked out in the cold
You painted memories
Then washed out all the scenes
I'm stuck in-between
A nightmare and lost dreams

Hey, mum, hey, dad, when did this end?
Where did you lose your happiness?
I'm here alone inside of this broken home

Hey, mum, hey, dad, when did this end?
Where did you lose your happiness?
I'm here alone inside of this broken home (Broken home)
Who's right? Who's wrong? Who really cares?
The fault, the blame, the pain's still there
I'm here alone inside of this broken home
