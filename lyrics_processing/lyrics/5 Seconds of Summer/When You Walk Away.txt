Cut me open, take my heart
So we'll never be apart
Don't you let it go to waste

Such a sentimental love in a cynical world
My feelings get the best of me (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
I messed it up before, so I'm almost pretty sure
My karma got the best of me (Uh-huh, uh-huh)

I'm bad at letting go
Won't you let me down easy?
I can't let you go, so

(When you walk away)
Cut me open, take my heart
So we'll never be apart
Don't you let it go to waste
(When you walk away)
I can feel it in my bones
You don't love me anymore
Make it worth all of the pain
(When you walk away)

I've been dreamin' like a fool in a nightmare of a world
It's bringin' out the worst in me (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
Shook me to the core, my optimism floored
My karma got the worst of me (Uh-huh, uh-huh)

Bad at letting go
Won't you let me down easy?
I can't let you go, so

(When you walk away)
Cut me open, take my heart
So we'll never be apart
Don't you let it go to waste
(When you walk away)
I can feel it in my bones
You don't love me anymore
Make it worth all of the pain
(When you walk away)

I'm so bad at letting go
How do you make it look so easy?
