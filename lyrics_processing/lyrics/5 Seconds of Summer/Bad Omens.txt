So this is where I am
Hanging on a feeling
Driving through the valley just to chase the pain again
So this is where we are
I should've seen it comin'
Every time we say goodbye, I say hello again

I cried in your dark brown eyes
For the thousandth time
'Cause you love somebody
I died when you left that night
For the thousandth time
'Cause you love somebody else
I tried to stop the door as it was closin'
It was closin'
Can't help the way I keep ignorin' every omen
Every omen
Heaven knows I should let go
It's nothing that I don't already know

I kiss you on your neck (Oh-na-na)
You were starin' at the ceiling (Oh-na-na)
I should've known right then and there you were a runaway (Oh-na-na)
Oh, just make it go away (Oh-na-na)
Can you help me rearrange it? (Oh-na-na)
I'm still makin' sense of having nothing left to save
You might also like
I cried in your dark brown eyes
For the thousandth time
'Cause you love somebody
I died when you left that night
For the thousandth time
'Cause you love somebody else
I tried to stop the door as it was closin'
It was closin'
Can't help the way I keep ignorin' every omen
Every omen
Heaven knows I should let go
It's nothing that I don't already know

We go 'round again, we jump back in bed
That's what you do when you love somebody
These bad omens, I look right through them
That's what you do when you love somebody
We go 'round again, we jump back in bed
That's what you do when you love somebody
These bad omens, I look right through them
That's what you do when you love somebody

Else (When you love somebody)
