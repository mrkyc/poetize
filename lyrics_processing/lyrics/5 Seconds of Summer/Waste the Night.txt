I, I need your love, need your love

Taste in your tongue, oh, the smoke in your lungs
And I need your love, and I need your love
The salt on your skin is pulling me in
And I need your love, and I need your love

I don't wanna say goodbye to another night
And watch you walk away
I don't wanna let it burn in the city lights
And make the same mistakes
This time

I don't wanna waste it, don't wanna waste it
I don't wanna waste it, don't wanna waste it
I don't wanna waste it, don't wanna waste the night
I don't wanna waste it, don't wanna waste it
I don't wanna waste it, don't wanna waste it
I don't wanna waste it, don't wanna waste the night

The scratch in your voice leaves me no choice
And I won't give up, and I can't give up
You might also like
I don't wanna say goodbye to another night
And watch you walk away
I don't wanna let it burn in the city lights
And make the same mistakes
This time

I don't wanna waste it, don't wanna waste it
I don't wanna waste it, don't wanna waste it
I don't wanna waste it, don't wanna waste the night
I don't wanna waste it, don't wanna waste it
I don't wanna waste it, don't wanna waste it
I don't wanna waste it, don't wanna waste the night

I don't wanna say goodbye to another night
I don't wanna let it burn in the city lights

I don't wanna say goodbye to another night
And watch you walk away
I don't wanna let it burn in the city lights
And make the same mistakes
This time
I don't wanna waste it, don't wanna waste it
I don't wanna waste it, don't wanna waste it (Don't wanna waste the night)
I don't wanna waste it, don't wanna waste the night (I don't wanna waste the night)
I don't wanna waste it, don't wanna waste it
I don't wanna waste it, don't wanna waste it (Waste the night)
I don't wanna waste it (Oh), don't wanna waste the night

I don't wanna waste it, don't wanna waste it
I don't wanna waste it, don't wanna waste it


And I, I was wrong all along
All along
I'm so alone, I don't know
What's wrong tonight
I lost my mind
