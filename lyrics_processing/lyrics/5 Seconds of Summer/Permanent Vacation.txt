You say that I'm too complicated
Hung up and miseducated
Well, I say nine-to-five is overrated
And we all fall down
I can't sleep 'cause my mind keeps racin'
My chest hurts 'cause my heart keeps breakin'
I'm so numb and I can't stop shakin'
And we all fall down

Frustration, desperation
You say I need some kind of medication
Situation: no motivation
Destination: permanent vacation

Hey, I'm doin' fine
And I know I'm out of line
So let's sing this one more time
It goes, destination: permanent vacation

Na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na

Voices coming through the speaker
They can't make me a believer
I know I'm an underachiever
And we're all so proud
And watch out, I think we're goin' under
Right now, you're just another number
Get out, your system's in the gutter
And we're all so proud
You might also like
Frustration, desperation
You say I need some kind of medication
Situation: no motivation
Destination: permanent vacation

Hey, I'm doin' fine
And I know I'm out of line
So let's sing this one more time
It goes, destination: permanent vacation
Hey, I'm doin' fine
And I know I'm out of line
So let's sing this one more time
It goes, destination: permanent vacation

Na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na

Congratulations, your imitations
Are takin' over the radio stations
Corporations, calculations
We're the voice of the new generation
