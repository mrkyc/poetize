Thinking 'bout you lots lately

Is it bad that I'm hopin' that you're broken?
Is it bad that I'm wishing you're still broken?
That you haven't found fish in the ocean
Is it bad? So bad
Is it weird that I'm drunken on my sofa?
Is it weird that I'm naked on my sofa?
All alone, damn, I wish I didn't know ya
Is it weird? So weird

I know I'm the stupid one who ended it
And now I'm the stupid one regrettin' it
It took me a couple drinks to admit it
I know I'm the stupid one
