Lane driver
The forces against you, the rain
I know everybody wants to put you down, but
I know everybody's gonna put me down, I want you

Because I rush in to feel you
But I won't set you down, I don't need to
Because I rush in to feel you
But I won't set you down, I don't need to

Fly, fly, fly, fly, fly, fly, fly
Don't try, try, try, try, try
It's a brand-new era, it feels great
It's a brand-new era, but it came too late

She won't let you know that ain't
Alright to touch her
She won't let you wait for me
For me to touch you

Crowds of the people
And voices and steeples
And wedding rings
Loud are the horses
And break-up divorces
And separate rooms from me
You might also like
My, my, my, my, my, my, my
I love your tinted eyes
So bad, so bad, so bad, so bad, so bad, so bad

She won't let me break you out
Well, the picture's crowded
Three of us, that is enough
And the simple stuff I need

Can't you see? Can't you see? (And the simple stuff I need)
Can't you see? Can't you see?
Can't you see?
Can't you stuff? (See, can't you see)
Stuff me (Can't you), stuff me
