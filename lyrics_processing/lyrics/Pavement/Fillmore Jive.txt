Hey, lady, what do you need?
Do you think you'd like to come and bleed with me?
I'd like to invite you to taste of my chalice
It's a special one, it's made of gold
(Passed out) Passed out on your couch
You left me there, thank you
Let me sleep it off, I need to sleep it off
I need to sleep, why don't you let me?
I need to sleep, why don't you

I need to sleep
I need to sleep
I need to sleep
I need to sleep, why won't you let me?
I need to sleep
I need to sleep
I need to sleep, why won't you
Why won't you let me sleep?


The jam kids on their Vespas
And glum looks on their faces
The street is full of punks
They got spikes
See those rockers with their long curly locks?
Goodnight to the rock 'n' roll era
'Cause they don't need you anymore
Little girl, boy, girl, boy
You might also like

The composers are so distracted
And jazzbo's skinny arms
And the dance faction
Little too loose for me
Every night, it's straight and narrow
Bones get broken, don't lose the marrow
Round and round and round and round she goes


Pull out their plugs and they snort up their drugs
When they pull out their plugs and they snort up their drugs
