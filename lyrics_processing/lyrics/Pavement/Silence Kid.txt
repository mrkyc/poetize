Silent kid, no one to remind you
You got no heel, no reels to remind you
Silent kid, don't take your pawn shop
Home on the road, goddamn you
Silent kid, don't lose your graceful tongue

This is the city life (This is the city life)
Come on, let's talk about leaving

Come on now, talk about your family
Your sister's cursed, your father's old and damned, yeah
Silent kid, don't listen to the
Grandmother's advice about us, yeah
Silent kid, don't listen to the rain

Hand me the drum stick, snare kick
Blues call and response, I lose myself in change
Into the spotlight, ecstasy feels so warm inside
'Til five hours later, I am chewin'
