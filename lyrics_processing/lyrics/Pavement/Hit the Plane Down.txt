I'm up on a hilltop where I
Keep you in sight, my little toys
I buried you because the sun will melt them
Got you up my sleeve, got you up my sleeve
I got you up my sleeve, got you up my sleeve

Hit the plane down
Hit the plane down
Hit the plane down
Taking over

Taking over your life, I'm taking over your scene
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I hope you see my face
I hope you see my face

Hit the plane down
Hit the plane down
Hit the plane down (Taking over)
There's no survivors
There's no survivors

Don't even snow (We're not that disturbed)
Don't even snow

Hit the plane down
Hit the plane down
I hit the plane down
No survivors
No survivors
Nobody arrived

I'm taking over your life, I'm taking over the scene
I'm taking everything
All, want it all, my little trick
I wouldn't mind just a milligram up my sleeve
I've got you up my sleeve
I've got you up my sleeve
I've got you up my sleeve

Hit the plane down
Hit the plane down
Hit the plane down
There's no survivors
Taking over your life
Taking over your life
I'm taking over the scene
I'm taking everything
I'm taking everything
I'm taking over (I've got to)

I've got to melt it
I've got to melt it (Woo, that's good)
I've got to melt it
I, I hit the plane down
Hit the plane down
There's no survivors
