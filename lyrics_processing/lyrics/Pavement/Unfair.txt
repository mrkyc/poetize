Down in Santa Rosa and over the bay
Across the grapevine to LA
We got deserts, we got trees
We got the hills of Beverly
Let's burn the hills of Beverly

Walk with your credit card in the air
Swingin' nunchakus like you just don't care
This is the slow, sick, sucking part of me
This is the slow, sick, sucking part of me
And when I suck and kiss, it's sour

Up to the top of the Shasta Gulch
And to the bottom of the Tahoe Lake
Man-made deltas and concrete rivers
The south takes what the north delivers
You film hack, I don't need your fade

Lost in the foothills on my bike
Drinking Euro, say goodnight
To the last psychedelic band
From Sacto, Northern Cal
From Sacto, Northern Cal

Take it all, neighbor
You're my neighbor and I need favors
You're my neighbor, you done me favors
'Cause I'm your neighbor
