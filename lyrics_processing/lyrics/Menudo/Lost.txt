It's getting hard to breathe
I'm tryin' to make her see
But she don't really know that I
I'm tryin to find a way, to tell her everyday
But she just doesn't long, so I
I don't wanna be the only one that knows
That somebody can come along and just
Take her right from me
I'm standing, shaking round
But I've been thinking that I'm gonna lose it cause
I'm losing my head
I'm losing my mind
I'm losing control of myself this time
She's got me losing my head (Losing my head)
I'm losing my mind (Losing my mind)
I'm losing my way but I think she feels I'm already Lost
I'm already Lost
(Damn...)
I wish that I could see (See...)
What is making you (You...)
Feel that you should be concerned (Should be concerned...)
My love is like a gunshot
All it takes is one shot
For me to blow it all, away... (It all, away...)
You might also likeI don't wanna feel like I'm just wasting time
It's gotta be with you and no one else
Do you notice me?
I need to know right now
Girl, I've been thinking that I'm gonna lose it cause
I'm losing my head (Losing my head...)
I'm losing my mind (Losing my mind...)
I'm losing control of myself this time
She's got me losing my head (Losing my head...)
I'm losing my mind (Losing my mind...)
I'm losing my way but I think she feels I'm already Lost
Maybe I'm trying too hard
But girl, you got me nervous
By now you should have noticed me...
And what will it take?
Do I have to lay across your door in chains?
You're driving me insane, girl
Losing my head, losing my mind...
I'm losing my head, Losing my head, Losing my mind...
Oh, oh, oh, OH!
I'm losing my head (Losing my head...)
I'm losing my mind (Losing my mind...)
I'm losing control of myself this time
She's got me losing my head (Losing my head...)
I'm losing my mind (Losing my mind...)
I'm losing my way but I think she feels I'm already Lost
I'm losing my head (Losing my head...)
I'm losing my mind (Losing my mind...)
I'm losing control of myself this time
She's got me losing my head (Losing my head...)
I'm losing my mind (Losing my mind...)
