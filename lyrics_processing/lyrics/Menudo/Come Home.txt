I think of us together, you know I miss you more than ever now
Just be with me--I guarantee my love's gonna make it right
Just be with me--without you in my life
I won't make it through another night
Come home(please come home)
Want you with me(please come back to me)

Jealousy got the best of me and so I made you leave
Let's put it all behind us, it's time we let love find us once
Again
Just be with me--I guarantee my love's gonna make things

I won't make it through another night
