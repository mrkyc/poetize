What goes on right outside our door
Come now, let's all take a stand
Our time has come
To lend a hand
Lies were spread
All across the land
We must fight by our joining hands
Listen to what we have to say
We are young we are the future
We are the sons of rock, rock
Oh oh, yeah
Oh oh
Oh oh
We are the sons of rock
As you seen we can move higher
We can set the soul on fire
Let the music spell desire
We know, it's hard to be young
But it's up to us to get things done
Let's fight, for what we have to say
If together we are, together we'll stay
Rock may not be the only way
But through our music we get to say
What we think of our destiny
We are young we are the future
