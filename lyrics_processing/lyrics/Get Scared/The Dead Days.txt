Ever since I can remember, I've been okay at best
It seems like every day's a struggle just to get out of bed
As a kid, I thought it couldn't get much better than this
Now I'm one pessimistic son of a bitch (Son of a bitch)

It was the last thing (Last thing) my momma taught me
How could I be so naive? She said

"Don't worry, kid, the dead days are on their way
Coffins line the streets, so dig your grave
There's not a soul alive or heart to break
'Cause we're all dead anyways, rotting away"

Soon we'll all be dead
(Dead, dead, we're already dead, dead, dead, dead)
(Dead, dead, we're already dead, dead)
Yeah, we're already dead

She said, "I'm sorry, now you know," I had no time to react
Since then I've been out on my own, but time was moving too fast
So I've accepted my fate because we're all gonna die someday
I never cared for life much anyway (Anyway)

We're already dead
(Dead, dead, we're already dead, dead, dead, dead)
Yeah, pushing daisies dead
(Dead, dead, we're already dead, dead, dead, dead)
Bored to fucking death
(Dead, dead, we're already dead, dead, dead, dead)
Yeah, we're already dead

And drowning to death, paid with a shot to the head
Too strange for me to come to terms with
She had me thinking what am I up against
Everything I ever love goes to shit
The dead days are on their way
Coffins line the streets so dig your grave
