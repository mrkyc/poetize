They'd love to call the search off
For me to go away
Just sweep me under the rug
Then no one takes the blame
They wanna fill my head up and scare me half to death
And when I bought what they want I'm there with nothing left

How can you stand up and say with a straight face
That nothing's wrong with me?
That nothing's wrong with me?
I don't think they've got a clue about what's best
For anybody else except themselves

I've got a bad, bad feeling overwhelming me
What if I'm right? (What if I'm right?)
What if I'm right?
I've got a bad, bad feeling overwhelming me
What if I'm right? (What if I'm right?)
What if I'm right?

They ask me why I'm nervous
Why I appear so tense
The pills offset each other
So I'm not making sense
Give me one more dosage to cure dependency
If I could wean myself off
You'll never hear from me
You might also like
How can you stand up and say with a straight face
That nothing's wrong with me?
That nothing's wrong with me?
I don't think they've got a clue about what's best
For anybody else except themselves

I've got a bad, bad feeling overwhelming me
What if I'm right? (What if I'm right?)
What if I'm right?
I've got a bad, bad feeling overwhelming me
What if I'm right? (What if I'm right?)
What if I'm right?

Paranoia, mass delusion
Stay confused and in the dark
Someday things will change
Self-destruction, lack of function
Fear cannot control us all
Blinded by your grace
But we will make them see!
The factories are burnin'
The medication fades
My lungs are finally open
And I can finally sleep
I've got a bad, bad feeling overwhelming me
What if I'm right? (What if I'm right?)
What if I'm right?
Got a bad, bad feeling overwhelming me
What if I'm right? (What if I'm right?)
What if I'm right?
What if I'm right? (What if I'm right?)
What if I'm right?
