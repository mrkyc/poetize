Get up!

Gone again in the undertow
Left to live with hate
(We won't let go, let go)
Faced again with a taste of it
Still I'll never change
(We won't let go, let go)

Understand I'm losing faith
Reminding self there are no saints
Comprehend I'm through with running

And I can't stop my long for belief
(On and on and on and on)
It goes (on, and on, and on)
And now I feel so lost and deceived
(On and on and on and on)
How will we rest in peace?

Fuck the sins that we fear to live in the end
(We won't ever follow, follow)
Stand against preach the same old shit
You're afraid to live
(We won't follow, follow)
You might also like
Understand I bow to nothing
Reminding self of pain and trusting
Comprehend I'm through with running

And I can't stop my long for belief
(On and on and on and on)
It goes (on, and on, and on)
And now I feel so lost and deceived
(On and on and on and on)
How will we rest in peace?

I can't buy into just a prophet dressed like a poet
And if you talk to God, I'm sure that He'll tell you He knows
I can't buy into just a prophet dressed like a poet
And if you talk to God, I'm sure that He'll tell you He knows
(Sure that He'll tell you He knows)
I can't buy into just a prophet dressed like a poet
And if you talk to God, I'm sure that He'll tell you He knows

And I can't stop my long for belief
(On and on and on and on)
It goes (on, and on, and on)
And now I feel so lost and deceived
(On and on and on and on)
