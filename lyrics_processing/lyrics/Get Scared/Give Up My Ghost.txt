Yeah!

Tongue-twisted lines, bitter symphony
I'll be the trustworthy side to my suffering
I've got a hit list for this sickness
So don't try to fucking sell me on a deathwish
Why? I've been here once before

'Cause I've been fighting all my life
It's all the same, I wasted all my time (In hopes to get it right)
Severed all my ties, and now I know where to go
There's so much they don't know

Maybe I should give up my ghost and live forever
Too hard to take, feels like I'm worlds away
I don't wanna go this alone, it's now or never
Too hard to say so I suffocate, suffocate

I should've known, should've known they were sick of me
Led me to play selfish games for the sympathy
I went insane, turned my allies into enemies
Then fucking left them a problematic, awkward status

Too hard to take, feels like I'm worlds away
I don't wanna go this alone, it's now or never
Too hard to say so I suffocate, suffocate
I always felt like a throwaway (Throwaway) ever since I can remember
Maybe I should give up my ghost and live forever

Forget my name
I put myself on display, tried not to show the pain
Inside of me, side of me no one ever sees
A side of me, side of me that no one would believe
Maybe you're all just too late, there's nothing left to take
There's a side of me, side of me no one ever sees
A side of me, a side of me believes that

Maybe I should give up my ghost and live forever
Too hard to take, feels like I'm worlds away
I don't wanna go this alone, it's now or never
Too hard to say so I suffocate, suffocate
