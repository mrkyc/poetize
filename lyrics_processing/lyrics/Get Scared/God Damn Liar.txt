You'll never take me
You'll never take me alive
Cause god knows you've tried
I once was blind but now I see the light
Maybe I should cut my wrists
You know I've never been fucked like this
You've ripped my heart apart
You know who you are

You're a god damn liar
You're a god damn liar
I don't want to care
Like I want to care
You're a god damn liar
You're a god damn liar
I don't want to care
Like I want to care

I know you hate me
I can see through your eyes
I feel the same way
You had the guts to take me by surprise
Maybe I should call it quits
I know you like to see me like this
I rot inside to fight the fight
You know I can't win
You might also like
You're a god damn liar
You're a god damn liar
I don't want to care
Like I want to care (like I want to care)
You're a god damn liar
You're a god damn liar
I don't want to care
Like I want to care

After all this regret
You had me at my best
With what little I had left
Now I'm finding out that bottom's not as bad as it gets
I may be wounded
You think I'm already dead
And now I've realized that sorrow only brings out my best

Maybe I should cut my wrists
You know I've never been fucked like this

God damn liar
You're a god damn liar
I don't want to care
Like I want to care
You're a god damn liar
You're a god damn liar
I don't want to care
Like I want to care
God damn liar
You're a god damn liar
You're a god damn liar
You're a god damn liar (you're a fucking liar!)
You're a god damn liar
You're a
