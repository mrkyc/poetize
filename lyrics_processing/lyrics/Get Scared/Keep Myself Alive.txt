I always ask myself
How could this darker cloud make me stronger now
I'll always ask myself
When will this go away?

When will this change?
Oh, I don't wanna, wanna wait
All of this pain
Oh, will it, will it go away?
I ask myself this every day

I just wanna leave this place behind
Every time I see your face in mine
I just wanna leave this place behind
Every time I see your face in mine

I sink and drink myself to sleep
Of course, I think I'm a lot stronger now
I gotta catch myself
To kick this over, make it go away

When will this change?
Oh, I don't wanna, wanna wait
Oh, all of this pain
Oh, will it, will it go away?
I broke apart to play the game
You might also like
I just wanna leave this place behind
Every time I see your face in mine
I just wanna leave this place behind
Every time I see your face in mine

So what's your inner thought?
You left me high, you left me dry
So, what's your life look like?
Just don't fix mine, you're all you got
Melodies all in my head
Keeping me alive from my death
I keep singing, "Da, da, da, da, da"
I keep singing just to keep myself alive!
Alive
Just to keep myself alive

I just wanna leave this place behind
Every time I see your face in mine
I just wanna leave this place behind
Every time I see your face in mine
I just wanna leave this place behind
Every time I see your face in mine
I just wanna leave this place behind
Every time I see your face in mine
So what's your inner thought!
You left me high, you left me dry!
So what your life looks like
Just don't fix mine, you're all you got
You're all you got!
