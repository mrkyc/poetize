It's the thing you least expected
When I got back up
And the world neglected me
Well, I got the best of them
Ladies, I'm now the main event
Take a hint from me
This is not what you came to see
This is only the minor threat
Ladies and gentleman, place your bets

Hold your breath, and shut your mouth
The scene will be the death of us
I told ya so (Hey!), told ya so (Hey!)
Everyone's out to get me
Nothing left to prove to you
Well, no one's gonna stop what I do
I told ya so (Hey!), told ya so (Hey!)
'Cause everyone's out to get me

Say "hello" to the brand new me
I gave out all apologies
I am not kissing ass again
Say goodbye to all my two faced friends (Goodbye!)
I'm the one your parents tell you not to hang around
At any moment I could snap and then choke you out
They need an enemy, who better than me?

Hold your breath, and shut your mouth
The scene will be the death of us
I told ya so (Hey!), told ya so (Hey!)
Everyone's out to get me
Nothing left to prove to you
Well, no one's gonna stop what I do
I told ya so (Hey!), told ya so (Hey!)
'Cause everyone's out to get me
Everyone's out to get me!

Ha ha ha!
Welcome to the shit show!
Introducing yours truly
I'm dependable, predictable, and watching others fall
Expect the least you'll be get the best
I'm sure you're seen it all
So confident and comfortable
They call me unforgettable
Refined at times, I never hide
And always so presentable

Hold your breath and shut your mouth
The scene will be the death of us
I told ya so (Hey!), told ya so! (Hey!)
Everyone's out to get me
Nothing left to prove to you
Well, no one's gonna stop what I do
I told ya so (Hey!), told ya so (Hey!)
'Cause everyone's out to get me
