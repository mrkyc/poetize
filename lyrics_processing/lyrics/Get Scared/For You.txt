I lost myself in a bottle of gin
And I'm wasted all the time
(All of the time)
One more shot for all my fucking failures
Might just end my life
(Just end my life)

And I think if I'm not mistaken
I may be breaking down
I might be acting a fool and breaking the rules
But I truly believe that I'll never be cool
I feel neglected
I'm young and reckless now

I'm so crazy
But I just may be
The type of personality that compliments your style
And I'm just waiting
For the day you save me
From myself cause I can't help
The way I feel for you
For you
You might also like
I found myself in a world of hurt
And I'm looking for a friend
(Fuck all your friends)
The devil called me up with a proposition
Forgave me for my sins
(For my sins)

I don't know but I've been told that rock'n'roll is dead
I've been losing my self and I never have dealt
With the problems I've had
And I'm needing the help
I feel neglected
I'm young and reckless now

I'm so crazy
But I just may be
The type of personality that compliments your style
And I'm just waiting
For the day you save me
From myself cause I can't help
The way I feel for you
For you
I feel like I'll be okay
I hope I can just maintain it
I will not let myself become my problem
And I know that if I keep trying
I might one day really find it
I will not stop until I truly solve this
Solve this!

I'm so crazy
But I just may be
The type of personality that compliments your style
And I'm just waiting
For the day you save me
From myself cause I can't help
The way I feel for you
For you

I'm so crazy
But I just may be
The type of personality that compliments your style
And I'm just waiting
For the day you save me
From myself cause I can't help
The way I feel for you
For you
For you
For you
