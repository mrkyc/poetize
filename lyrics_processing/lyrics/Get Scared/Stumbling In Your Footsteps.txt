What went wrong?
We both know that you're not here
This is where you haunt and it's kept me in fear for far too long

Now you hide like the ghost
The ghost we both know
I'm the taste on your tongue
The taste you can't spit up
Please come home again
Let me show you we're good enough for your love

What have you done?
When is it ever enough
To be seen in my eyes?
Tell me the truth
What did you have left to lose
To be seen in my eyes as a fool down on his knees?
When the kingdom has lost its king
Who's left to lead?

Torn apart and left here to rot away (rot away) rot away
Making sense while you save yourself
Saving me is all that can help
You might also like
Now you hide like the ghost
The ghost we both know
I'm the taste on your tongue
The taste you can't spit out
Please come home again
Let me show you we're good enough for your love

What have you done?
When is it ever enough
To be seen in my eyes?
Tell me the truth
What did you have left to lose
To be seen in my eyes as a fool down on his knees?
When the kingdom has lost its king
Who's left to lead?
Tell me who's left to lead

Your kingdom has turned into a boneyard
The look on your face as you leave
You cut me so deep that it left scars
You had the world right at your feet
You had the world right at your feet
You had the world right at your feet
You had the world right at your feet
You had it all
You had it all
What have you done?
When is it ever enough
To be seen in my eyes
Tell me the truth
What did you have left to lose
To be seen in my eyes as a fool down on his knees?
When the kingdom has lost its king
Who's left to lead?
