Yeah!

Open palms of papercuts
Backhanded as the compliments
I crossed out names on every page
And I gotta say, you're just fucking deadweight

Found you out, I know
Hands around my throat
They'll hunt you down and bleed you out
Then throw you to the crowd

I think you've said it enough
It screams poetic like a loaded gun
Your mind was made up
Fucked, pathetic, and numb
I'm better off
Broken hearts are hard to get through
Cleaned my wounds so I'd forget you
'Cause enough is enough, because enough is enough

So what did you expect of me?
I felt like a novelty
For honesty's sake
You're just a little too late
You might also like
Found you out, I know
Hands around my throat
They'll hunt you down and bleed you out
Then throw you to the crowd

I think you've said it enough
It screams poetic like a loaded gun
Your mind was made up
Fucked, pathetic, and numb
I'm better off (Better off)
Broken hearts are hard to get through
Cleaned my wounds so I'd forget you
'Cause enough is enough, 'cause enough is enough

Dug up and drained me of trust
Betrayed what little there was
I've heard you curse upon the blessed ever since you could speak
Only the lonely can't defend when they're down on their knees
Made us feel wretched, scared to death, ripped the hearts from my sleeves
They want to fill your head with hate then deprive you of dreams
You're just a coward and a martyr in a merciful scene
Disaster spared faith when mine got away
I think you've said it enough
It screams poetic like a loaded gun
Your mind was made up
Fucked, pathetic, and numb
I'm better off
Broken hearts are hard to get through
Cleaned my wounds so I'd forget you
'Cause enough is enough, 'cause enough is enough

Dug up and drained me of trust
Betrayed what little there was
