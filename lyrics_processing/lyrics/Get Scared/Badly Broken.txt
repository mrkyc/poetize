I'm so badly broken

I blamed myself, you're so pathetic
You've moved along but you won't forget me
If there's a million different reasons why
You left it all behind
Then try me (You'll say anything)

When love has lost all its meaning

You know, you know I'm not alright
This is where I draw the line
I've tried to run, I've tried to hide
But I'm so badly broken
You know you swept me off my feet
And now I'm stuck beneath
The bridge you burned on top of me
And I'm so badly broken

I'm sure you got the best excuses
To keep me at your feet
It's all you got to clear your conscience
Take a good long look at me
You see a shell of what I used to be
And can't get close to anyone or anything
Like how I thought it should be
You might also like
When love has lost all its meaning

You know, you know I'm not alright
This is where I draw the line
I've tried to run, I've tried to hide
But I'm so badly broken
You know you swept me off my feet
And now I'm stuck beneath
The bridge you burned on top of me
And I'm so badly broken

You've lost your chance (Your chance)
And you will never get to love me again
The sky has opened up (Opened up)
And I can finally see the sun
And what it was, it was

You, you know I'm not alright
This is where I draw the line
I've tried to run, I've tried to hide
But I'm so badly broken
You know you swept me off my feet
And now I'm stuck beneath
The bridge you burned on top of me
And I'm so badly broken
You know, you know I'm not alright
This is where I draw the line
I've tried to run, I've tried to hide
But I'm so badly broken
You know you swept me off my feet
And now I'm stuck beneath
The bridge you burned on top of me
And I'm so badly broken
