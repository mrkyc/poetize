You've got me shaking from the way you're talking
My heart is breaking but there's no use crying
What a cyanide surprise you have left for my eyes
If I had common sense I'd cut myself or curl up and die
Sticks and stones could break my bones
But anything you say will only fuel my lungs

Don't mind us, we're just spilling our guts
If this is love I don't wanna be loved
You pollute the room with a filthy tongue
Watch me choke it down so I can throw it up
Don't mind us, we're just spilling our guts
If this is love I don't wanna be hanging by the neck
Before an audience of death

You would be the corpse and I would be the killer
I would be the devil and you would be the sinner
You would be the drugs and I would be the dealer
Everything you say is like music to my ears
You would be the corpse and I would be the killer
I would be the devil and you would be the sinner
You would be the drugs and I would be the dealer
Everything you say is like music to my
Music to my ears
You might also like
Don't mind us, we're just spilling our guts
If this is love I don't wanna be loved
You pollute the room with a filthy tongue
Watch me choke it down so I can throw it up
Don't mind us, we're just spilling our guts
If this is love I don't wanna be hanging by the neck
Before an audience of death
(Before an audience of death)

Failure find me
To tie me up now
Cause I'm as bad
As bad as it gets
Failure find me
To hang me up now
By my neck
Cause I'm a fate worse than death
What a cyanide surprise you have left for my eyes
If I had common sense I'd cut myself or curl up and die

Don't mind us, we're just spilling our guts
If this is love I don't wanna be loved
You pollute the room with a filthy tongue
Watch me choke it down so I can throw it up
Don't mind us, we're just spilling our guts
If this is love I don't wanna be hanging by the neck
Before an audience of death
Don't mind us, we're just spilling our guts
If this is love I don't wanna be loved
You pollute the room with a filthy tongue
Watch me choke it down so I can throw it up
Don't mind us, we're just spilling our guts
If this is love I don't wanna be hanging by the neck
