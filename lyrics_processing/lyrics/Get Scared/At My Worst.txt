Bleed me out
I know you're the first to listen when I scream aloud
I'm coming clean again
And I will do my best to show you who, who I was and who I am
Don't write me off, please hear me out
My skin is so much thicker now

I feel it in my bones
Not feeling anymore
The writing's on the wall
My scars are at the door

The worst is over, my eyes are open
They can say whatever
They can say whatever they want
Tonight I'm not coming undone
They can say whatever
They can say whatever they want
And I'll throw it all away
You can see it on my face
And I'll throw it all away
Just to find my voice again
You might also like
Lay me out
Leave me bruised and broken
Watch me build back up and lead aloud again
I won't forget the ones who
Pulled me out when I was at my worst
If it's you I cared about, you know I'd tell you first
My skin is thicker now

I feel it in my bones
Not feeling anymore
The writing's on the wall
My scars are at the door

The worst is over, my eyes are open
They can say whatever
They can say whatever they want
Tonight I'm not coming undone
They can say whatever
They can say whatever they want
And I'll throw it all away
You can see it on my face
And I'll throw it all away
Just to find my voice again
(Just to find my voice again)
No turning back
I see it all in front of me
Forget the past
There's no way that I'd ever leave
No turning back
I see it all in front of me
Forget the past
There's no way that I'd ever leave

The worst is over, my eyes are open
They can say whatever
They can say whatever they want
Tonight I'm not coming undone
They can say whatever
They can say whatever they want
And I'll throw it all away
You can see it on my face
And I'll throw it all away
