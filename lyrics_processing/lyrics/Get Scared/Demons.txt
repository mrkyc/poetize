Feel the fucking pain and anguish pouring over me
Am I insane or am I drowning in the agony?
I once was fine, I'm not alright, it's getting hard to think
Am I insane or am I drowning in the agony?

Am I alive or just breathing?
Cast like a stone out to sea
(I'm sinkin')
Buried my lies and my secrets
Down where the world never sees
My demons!

And I swear it never had to end like this
If I could just pretend
I'm not those things that you resent, my friends
Just leave me here for dead
'Cause I'm left with nothing, but self-destruction
Stare down the cliff to my descent
Into the deep end
Into the deep end

Am I distraught in deceivin'?
Sick thoughts that hang over me
With meaning!

The monsters under my bed
Won't seem to leave me alone
They sleep inside of my head
Deceive to leave but they won't
The monsters under my bed
Won't seem to leave me alone
They sleep inside of my head
Deceive to leave but they won't
They won't
And!
