Talk candy in my ear
Come on, come on
I want your toxic, talk sick, baby
I know those gospel lips can change me

Look to the right of me, okay?
We got exhibit, "A"
She, she ain't okay today
And to the left, the left of me
We got exhibit, "B"
Oh, she's a mess to say the least
She's got her daddy's money, money, money

Honey, I think you should run (I think you should) run

Look, oh, look around, you're lost
But never found, no
6 feet below the ground
Where you avoid your problems

Look right in front of me
We got exhibit, "C"
Anorexic, obsessed with magazines
And when I look over here
Oh my God, that's me in the mirror
Oh no, no, ladies and gentlemen
This is my fear
My eyes and ears
You might also like
Honey, I think you should run, run

Look, oh, look around, you're lost
But never found, no
6 feet below the ground
Where you will never solve them

(I know you don't want to hear this, but just listen)
The last contender
Bad for us, bad for you
This capillary root
Could root up all the little puzzle pieces
Of what you've been through
Your hair all up in knots
Don't ever say you're not
Oh, just a nothing
Cause I swear, downstairs you're something
That's egotistic, cynical
I'm getting out of control
Out of control
Out of control, out of control

Look, oh, look around, you're lost
But never found, no
6 feet below the ground
Where you avoid your problems
Look, oh, look around, you're lost
But never found, no
6 feet below the ground
Where you will never solve them

Look, oh, look around, you're lost
But never found, no
6 feet below the ground
Where you avoid your problem

Out of control
