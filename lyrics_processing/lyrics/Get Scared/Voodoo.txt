I'm so nervous it shakes the fingertips that are coursing through your hair
With these lovely lips that are made to kiss, you know you put me in a spin
You've got the body of a goddess
You've got the moves that make me sweat
You've got a voice that makes me breathless

Girl, I've got you
Under a spell and I don't think I'll be letting you out
I've got you
If this is heaven then, baby, I don't want to know hell

Yeah, she says my singing gets her thinking filthy
The thoughts she's thinking I know I'm not worthy
I know what I need to sweep her off her feet
She knows the work will damn near kill me

Girl, I've got you
Under a spell and I don't think I'll be letting you out
I've got you
If this is heaven then, baby, I don't want to know hell

I've got you
Under a spell and I don't think I'll be letting you out
I've got you
If this is heaven then, baby, I don't want to know hell

She can't resist me
She's just what I need
She makes me so weak
At my knees, at my knees
She can't resist me
She's just what I need
She makes me so weak
At my knees, at my knees

I've got you
Under a spell and I don't think I'll be letting you out
I've got you under a spell

Girl, I've got you
Under a spell and I don't think I'll be letting you out
I've got you
If this is heaven then, baby, I don't want to know hell

I've got you
Under a spell and I don't think I'll be letting you out
I've got you!
If this is heaven then, baby, I don't want to know hell
Baby, I don't want to know hell
