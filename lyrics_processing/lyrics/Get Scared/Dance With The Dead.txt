Where the band never sleeps
The dead waltz through the streets
And I'm slowly falling
There's a voice in my head
Whispering softly it says
"Join me, dance, dance, dance with the dead!"

Where the band never sleeps
The dead waltz through the streets
And I'm slowly falling
There's a voice in my head
Whispering softly it says
"Join me, dance, dance, dance, dance with the dead!"

Whisper me a miracle
Or think of something logical
It's all too hard to deal
And if I die before I wake
I pray the Lord my soul to take
And if there's none, oh well

Where the band never sleeps
The dead waltz through the streets
And I'm slowly falling
There's a voice in my head
Whispering softly it says
"Join me, dance, dance, dance, dance with the dead!"
You might also like
You're screaming out a melody
You're ignorant but still you scream
You've given up on hell
And if I die before I wake
I pray the Lord my soul to take
And if there's none, oh well

Where the band never sleeps
The dead waltz through the streets
And I'm slowly falling
There's a voice in my head
Whispering softly it says
"Join me, dance, dance, dance with the dead!"

Where the band never sleeps
The Dead waltz through the streets
And I'm slowly falling
There's a voice in my head
Whispering softly it says
"Join me, dance, dance, dance with the dead!"
(Waltz through the streets)
(Dance with the Dead)
(Whispering)
Where the band never sleeps
The dead waltz through the streets
And I'm slowly falling
There's a voice in my head
Whispering softly it says

"Join me, dance, dance, dance with the dead!"
"Join me, dance, dance, dance with the dead!"
"Join me, dance, dance, dance with the dead!"
