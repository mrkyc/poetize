Hiding out in shadowed disguise in hopes to keep you alive
Has come to be the only way I've known you
Regenerate and revive just like a ghost in the night
But I'll be damned if that's the fate I fall to

No, I think it's time we let this go
'Cause now I'm finding a way to replace all the hate
You threw me away, now I'm left with your shame

You left me to feel dead and thrown to the wolves (To the wolves)
Reflect and reveal how you shattered my soul
If there was ever a time you had hope in your eyes
Then believe me (Believe me)
You're still a father of mine

Take a look inside of my mind
And see the hell you've designed
Once filled with hatred and I can't feel a thing
And now there's not a hope in sight
Just open wounds you left behind
Become another enemy and leave us rotting
You might also like
No, I think it's time we let this go
'Cause now I'm
Finding a way to replace all the hate
You threw me away now I'm left with your shame

You left me to feel dead and thrown to the wolves (To the wolves)
Reflect and reveal how you shattered my soul
If there was ever a time you had hope in your eyes
Then believe me (Believe me)
You're still a father of mine

I'll finally forgive
This doesn't mean that I won't forget all the regret again
Again
Agh, ha ha ha!

Finding a way to replace all the hate
You threw me away now I'm left with your shame

You left me to feel dead and thrown to the wolves (To the wolves)
Reflect and reveal how you shattered my soul
If there was ever a time you had hope in your eyes
Then believe me (Believe me)
You're still a father of mine
