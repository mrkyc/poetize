In a slumber where no one can wake me from
The scent of her skin still haunts my lungs
Where the moon never leaves her eyes
Here's a toast to another endless night
It's a feeling in my bones
A carousel for two that no one knows

What a twist, when we kiss, I feel sick
Any moment I could wake without your lips
My paradise is stripped and I'm weak
You'll never know how much it kills me

Every time I close my eyes
I dream that you're still here
(This is, this is my nightmare)
Every time I go to sleep
I scream cause you're not there
This is my nightmare

As you fade right behind my eyelids
I get the feeling it's so familiar
But I can't do a thing to stop this now
I can't believe this is happening to me again
The wake of a change is crashing
The lust of our fate is rusting
I hope I never wake up
It's not enough
You might also like
My paradise is stripped and I'm weak
You'll never know
How much it kills me

Every time I close my eyes
I dream that you're still here
(This is, this is my nightmare)
Every time I go to sleep
I scream cause you're not there
This is my nightmare
This is my nightmare

Floating, walking on air
I turn my head for just a moment
And you're gone again
This is not the way it's supposed to be
I've lost it all
This is not what I expect
From someone that I love
Lost but never found
How dare you pull me out
Hold me close I'm not alone
You've left me here to drown
Every time I close my eyes
I dream that you're still here
(This is, this is my nightmare)
Every time I go to sleep
I scream cause you're not there
This is my nightmare
