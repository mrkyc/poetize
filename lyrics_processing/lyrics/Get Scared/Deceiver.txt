It's all the same to me, so you can go
'Cause you're on your own
(Thought you had me fucking fooled, not even close)

Caught off guard like a deer in headlights
Tried to hide the bottle behind your bedside light
There hasn't been a colder night in my entire life

You're hard to avoid and somehow unaware
That I can't stand the sound of your voice or dry the tears of fifteen years
Took all the abuse, walked away black and blue
And betrayed me in the worst way you knew, so now I'm over you
So now I'm over you (Now, I'm over)

Before our desperate times
When we first laid eyes on fireflies and Indiana nights
I recall the year was '99

(Yeah, get the fuck out of here!)
(You motherfucker!)
(Yeah!)
(You motherfucker!)
(Yeah!)

Caught off guard like a deer in headlights
Tried to hide the bottle behind your bedside light
There hasn't been a colder night in my entire life

You're hard to avoid and somehow unaware
That I can't stand the sound of your voice or dry the tears of fifteen years
Took all the abuse, walked away black and blue
And betrayed me in the worst way you knew, so now I'm over you

More afraid than ashamed
I can't express enough the lengths I am willing to go
Filled my veins with disdain to save your withered bones
Hope you know, beautiful, I'm better on my own

You're hard to avoid and somehow unaware
That I can't stand the sound of your voice or dry the tears of fifteen years
Took all the abuse, walked away black and blue
And betrayed me in the worst way you knew, so now I'm over you

Caught off guard like a deer in headlights
Tried to hide the bottle behind your bedside light
There hasn't been a colder night in my entire life
There was not much of you left that I cared to lose
When you betrayed me in the worst way you knew, so now I'm over you
