Another glass to fill the void and get me by
Terrible company surrounding me
They're keeping me alive
Breathe in at an alarming pace
The second-guessing's always keeping me awake

From my bed, it's safe for hiding under covers
So instead, I'm fighting voices
When we were strong
Back to the times where we never gave up like
Where we went wrong
No turning back picking up where we left off

I cover up my face and hope it passes by
We masquerade around
When we can't find a safer place to hide
Think back to where we first escaped
If you can't save us, please just leave me in my ways

From my bed, it's safe for hiding under covers
So instead, I'm fighting voices
When we were strong
Back to the times where we never gave up like
Where we went wrong
No turning back picking up where we left off
You might also like
When no one wants to try
You get what you give
When no one's by your side
One choice to make
Will you buckle or break?
When the moment comes
Will I stumble right out the gate?
And now I can't escape
All the change
I'm not giving up
(Hear me out)
When there's so much to say
Drag my words through the dirt
I'm unheard again
(Hear me out)
I'm desperate on my knees

When we were strong
Back to the times where we never gave up like
Where we went wrong
No turning back picking up where we left off
When no one wants to try
You get what you give
When no one's by your side
One choice to make
Will you buckle or break?
Will you buckle or break?
Will you buckle or break?
Will you buckle or break?
Will you buckle?
