(And it is from this world of darkness which come the evil, destructive forces of man's nature)

You've got me shaking from the way you're talkin'
My heart is breaking, but there's no use cryin'
What a cyanide surprise you have left for my eyes
If I had common sense, I'd cut myself, or curl up and die

Sticks and stones could break my bones
But anything you say will only fuel my lungs

Don't mind us, we're just spilling our guts
If this is love, I don't wanna be loved
You pollute the room with a filthy tongue
Watch me choke it down so I can throw it up
Don't mind us, we're just spilling our guts
If this is love, I don't wanna be hanging by the neck
Before an audience of death

If you could be the corpse then I could be the killer
If I could be the devil then you could be the sinner
You could be the drugs and I could be the dealer
Everything you said is like music to my ears
If you could be the corpse and I could be the killer
If I could be the devil then you could be the sinner
You could be the drugs then I could be the dealer
Everything you said is like music to my, music to my ears
You might also like
Don't mind us, we're just spilling our guts
If this is love, I don't wanna be loved
You pollute the room with a filthy tongue
Watch me choke it down so I can throw it up
Don't mind us, we're just spilling our guts
If this is love, I don't wanna be hanging by the neck
Before an audience of death
(Before an audience)

Failure, find me
To tie me up now
'Cause I'm as bad, as bad as it gets
Failure find me
To hang me up now
By my neck, 'cause I'm a fate worse than death

What a cyanide surprise you have left for my eyes
If I had common sense, I'd cut myself or curl up and die
(I wanna fucking die!)

Don't mind us, we're just spilling our guts
If this is love, I don't wanna be loved
You pollute the room with a filthy tongue
Watch me choke it down so I can throw it up
Don't mind us, we're just spillin' our guts
If this is love, I don't wanna be hanging by the neck
Before an audience
Don't mind us, we're just spillin' our guts
If this is love, I don't wanna be loved
You pollute the room with a filthy tongue
Watch me choke it down so I can
Don't mind us, we're just spilling our guts
If this is love, I don't wanna be hanging by the neck
Before an audience of death
