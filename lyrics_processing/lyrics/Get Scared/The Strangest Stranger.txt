It's too late, what a waste
You're a stranger, shoving your words down my throat
If it's helping, I'll put you to bed
With the truth cause  you need it the most

I can hear the children talking, screaming, "You're a wreck"
If you think you're so convincing, where's your self-respect?
I can't feel sorry for you, no

I can't watch you throw it all away, I'm not like you
Every day you make the same mistakes, I can't follow you

In a chase, so ashamed you're in danger of spending your nights all alone
As you fail through the same fake emotions
Retracing your steps like a ghost

I can hear the children talking, screaming, "You're a wreck"
If you think you're so convincing, where's your self-respect?
I can't feel sorry for you, no

I can't watch you throw it all away, I'm not like you
Every day you make the same mistakes, I can't follow you
And I can't watch you go down
And drag my name through the  ground
Every day you make the same mistakes, I can't follow you
You might also like
Take a knife and throw it at my face
Treat us like we're a number all the same
Doesn't make a difference if it hurts
You will stoop so low where you deserve
Give me your best shot
Give me your curse
You're fucking toxic
You've shown me what you're worth
Give me your best shot
Give me your curse
You're fucking toxic
You've shown me exactly what you're worth

I can't feel sorry for you, oh no I can't
Oh no, I can't

I can't watch you throw it all away, I'm not like you
Every day you make the same mistakes, I can't follow you
And I can't watch you go down
And drag my name through the ground
Every day you make the same mistakes, I can't follow you
