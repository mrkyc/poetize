To build it tough, back it up, and tear it apart
We'll take the hype to the clubs (see what these kids are made of)
This scene can't break us, when veteran halls raised us
When we're days away
Just give my best to the midwest, baby
I've been missing her lately
And you know, it won't be long 'till I'm coming home
Truth be told, no matter where we go, we'll always have the shows
No, I'm not sorry for a damn thing
Don't take this away from me
When it's time, we'll know it
And take it coast to coast
Our past becomes a ghost
And you'll follow me
Looking back on the past year
We've come up and faced the clubs
The dirty pubs, and we didn't care
We live for cheers, sweat and blood
It's the scars that make us
We leave them open, we've got the guts to show it
When we're days away
Just give my best to the midwest, baby
I've been missing her lately
And you know, it won't be long 'till I'm coming home
Truth be told, no matter where we go, we'll always have these shows

Don't take this away from me
When it's time, we'll know it
And take it coast to coast
Our past becomes a ghost
And you'll follow me
We're just chasing the same, we guess the city by name
We take it back to the start, we don't forget
We know where we are from, we know how far we have come
We know we wouldn't be anywhere at all without you
When we're days away
Just give my best to the midwest, baby
I've been missing her
No, I'm not sorry for a damn thing
Don't take this away from me
When it's time, we'll know it
And take it coast to coast
Our past becomes a ghost
And you'll follow me
No, i'm not sorry for a damn thing
Don't take this away from me
When it's time, we'll know it
And take it coast to coast
Our past becomes a ghost
