But how can I apologize, comply with my demands?
They're written on these pages, it's written on our faces
I know you don't want this, but know that I need this more than I did before
It's easy to see that it's hard to ignore your subtle hints
I'm catching wind. How insincere are your finger prints?
So make me promises, girl, the kind I know you can't keep
And while I'm losing my mind, I hope you're home finding sleep
But you and I both know that that's not the case
Because the look on your face gives all your secrets away
Can we talk this over? At least just for tonight
I asked myself one hundred times
Why did we even bother? Why did we even try?
But I miss you more than I did before
I showed you my heart and you showed me the door
Your subtle hints, I'm catching wind. How insincere are your finger prints?
So make me promises, girl, the kind I know you can't keep
And while I'm losing my mind, I hope you're home finding sleep
But you and I both know that that's not the case
Because the look on your face gives all your secrets away
I've been waiting for a good time to decide whether I was wrong or right
Are you getting sick of the ride because I'm driving you out of your mind?

Girl, remember you're mine, girl
So make me promises, girl, the kind I know you can't keep
And while I'm losing my mind, I hope you're home finding sleep
But you and I both know that that's not the case
