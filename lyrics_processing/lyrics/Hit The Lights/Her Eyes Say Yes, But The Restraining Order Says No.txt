This damp rag soaked in chloroform
It makes me so hard to ignore
Cause I could never keep your attention
I'm not one to make threats
I've been reduced to promises
I lie to myself cause I do it best
I'm not honest with my intentions
So when the blindfold starts to slip
And the rope starts to rip
And I slowly start to give
And girl, you know I'm sorry
But tonight I'll wait until I know you're fast asleep
To poison you with memories of you and me
I pray you die slowly so I can be the last thing you see
You'll see
Girl you're busy and that's fine
But there's one thing I gotta get off my mind
I won't take too much of your time
I promise this won't last long, no
I used to be your biggest fan
You used to say I was your man
Now if I can't have you no one can
I'll be the last boy you hang up on

And girl, you know I'm sorry
But tonight I'll wait until I know you're fast asleep
To poison you with memories of you and me
I pray you die slowly so I can be the last thing you see
Oh you'll see
She's losing consciousness
I'm gaining confidence
It's starting to make sense, woah-oh woah-oh
She's covered in finger prints
From her lips to her hips
All I wanted was one more kiss, woah-oh woah-oh

Tonight I'll wait until I know you're fast asleep
To poison you with memories of you and me
I pray you die slowly (die slowly) so I can be the last thing you see
