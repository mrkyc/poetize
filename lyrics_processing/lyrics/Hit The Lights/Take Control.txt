I'm waiting for her to give me a chance to leave
This night is over and it's all been shot to hell
Heaven help me cause I can't help myself from falling asleep
Cause the pills and the drinks
Have turned us into creeps
Who can't speak to say what they're thinking
But she'll speak tonight
So tell me all about it
Speak slow
Everything is said
And there's nothing left to let you know
The secrets kept are let go
Everything is said
And there's nothing left to take control
I've got the mind set to take myself outside
And think over nicotine
Mix it with other things
I medicate in ways that are unsafe
But I don't feel anything
Now I've become a creep
Who can't speak to say what he's thinking
I'll talk tonight
I'll tell you all about it
Speak slow
Everything is said
And there's nothing left to let you know
The secrets kept are let go
Everything is said
And there's nothing left to take control

Speak slow
Everything is said
And there's nothing left to let you know
The secrets kept are let go
Til everything is said
And there's nothing left to take control tonight
Sometimes we say things we can't take back
But more than anything, we meant everything
Sometimes we say things we can't take back
But more than anything
Sometimes we say things we can't take back
But more than anything, we meant everything
Sometimes we say things we can't take back
We meant everything
We meant everything
So tell me all about it
Speak slow
Everything is said
And there's nothing left to let you know
The secrets kept are let go
Til everything is said
And there's nothing left to take control
So tell me all about it
Speak slow
Everything is said
And there's nothing left to let you know
The secrets kept are let go
Til everything is said
And there's nothing left to take control tonight
She's in the corner resting her head on her knees
