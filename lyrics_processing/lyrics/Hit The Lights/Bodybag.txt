You're gonna need a body bag
I'll break bones you didn't know you had
When I'm done there will be nothing left of you
For your friends to hold on to
When they find you cold and blue tonight
Face down in a parking lot

Next time around, think about what you say
Before you run your mouth
'Cause you're all alone and you're nothing
Without your friends now
You can tell the pavement what you really said
But I already know
You got another thing coming if you think you're walking home

This time I'm waiting here for you, you got nowhere to hide

You're gonna need a body bag
I'll break bones you didn't know you had
When I'm done there will be nothing left of you
For your friends to hold on to
When they find you cold and blue tonight
Face down in a parking lot

Here's a question
What do you do when you're all alone
And you have nowhere to run to, swear I'll find you
And this is what I'll do; I'll take it slow (I'll take it slow)
Just to let you know that we're not playing, you're not walking home

This time I'm waiting here for you, you got nowhere to hide

You're gonna need a body bag
I'll break bones you didn't know you had
When I'm done there will be nothing left of you
For your friends to hold on to
When they find you cold and blue tonight
Face down in a parking lot

Did you think that you had something to prove?
Well you do yeah, you do yeah
Did you think that you had nothing to lose?
Well you do so you think you're walking home

This time I'm waiting here for you, you got nowhere to hide
You're gonna need a body bag
I'll break bones you didn't know you had
When I'm done there will be nothing left of you
For your friends to hold on to
When they find you cold and blue tonight
Face down in a parking lot

You're gonna need a body bag (Next time around, think about what you say)
I'll break bones you didn't know you had (Before you run your mouth)
('Cause you're all alone and you're nothing)
When I'm done there will be nothing left of you (Without your friends now)
For your friends to hold on to
When they find you cold and blue tonight
