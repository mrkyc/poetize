What it is that you want and where you're sleeping tonight
It's no skin off my back or bones
If you wanna go home then just say so...
Just say so, whoa
Let go, of all that we've had
You know we've been down this road before
Pack your bags, dry your eyes
It's a long walk from my house to 309
Cry all you like kid
It's no secret you faked it
And it's no skin off my back or bones
If you wanna go home then just say so...
Just say so, whoa
Let go, of all that we've had
You know we've been down this road before
Pack your bags, dry your eyes
It's a long walk from my house to 309
By the way that your eyes
Travel to the floor when you tell a lie
Like the way that your eyes
Travel to the floor when you tell a lie
By the way that your eyes
Travel to the floor when you tell a lie
(Your eyes disguise, your ways and severed ties)
Like the way that your eyes
Travel to the floor when you tell a lie...
