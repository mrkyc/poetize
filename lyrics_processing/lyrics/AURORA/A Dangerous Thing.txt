Something about you is soft like an angel
And something inside you is violence and danger
I knew from the moment we met, you are a dangerous thing
When you are with me, I feel like I'm living
And living besides you can be unforgiving
I knew from the very first step, you are a dangerous thing

There's no end to the fall
You keep on getting better
I keep forgetting
There's no love in the end
I hope you'll call
I keep on losing feathers
I keep forgetting
There's no love in the end

No love in the end
No love in the end
No love in the end

Something about you is warm and seducive, and
When you're with me, you're cold and abusive
I knew, from the second we met, you are a dangerous flame
You are a dangerous flame

There's no love in the end
I hope you'll call
I keep on losing feathers
I keep forgetting
There's no love in the end
No love in the end

I don't think I know myself, without your help
I wonder why, how you got a heaven deep inside of me
I keep the light on, it keeps me warm
I hate it when I fall for your illusion of love
I know this is not love
There's no end to the fall
You keep on getting better
There's no love in the end
I hope you'll come
I keep on losing feathers
I keep forgetting
There's no love in the end
There's no end to the fall
You keep on getting better
I keep forgetting
There's no love in the end
I hope you'll call
I keep on losing feathers
I keep forgetting
There's no love in the end

No love in the end
No love in the end
No love in the end
No love in the end
