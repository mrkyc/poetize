Go row the boat to safer grounds
But don't you know we're stronger now
My heart still beats and my skin still feels
My lungs still breathe, my mind still fears
But we're runnin' out of time (Time, ah)
All the echoes in my mind cry

There's blood on your lies
The skies open wide
There is nowhere for you to hide
The hunter's moon is shinin'

I'm running with the wolves tonight
I'm running with the wolves
I'm running with the wolves tonight
I'm running with the wolves
I'm running with the

Trick or treat, what would it be?
I walk alone, I'm everything
My ears can hear and my mouth can speak
My spirit talks, I know my soul believes
But we're runnin' out of time (Time, ah)
All the echoes in my mind cry

A million voices, silent dreams
Where hope is left so incomplete
