This voice is calling for a touch to be undone
I hope love will come to us again
As a place we all can come
And if I'm blinded, will my eyes become the planets?
Will I float or will I drown?
This voice, is it calling for the world to pull me down?

I feel time looking out my window
Watching me dance on the moon
I feel time looking out my window
Watching me dance on the moon

Oh-oh-eh-oh-oh-eh-oh-ah
Oh-oh-eh-oh-oh-eh-oh-ah
Oh-oh-eh-oh-oh-eh-oh-ah
Oh-eh-oh-ah
Eh-oh-oh-eh-oh-ah
Oh-eh-oh-ah

I dance as I'm falling, but I never touch the ground
One day, I will penetrate the earth
And explode in motion sounds
And if I listen, will my mouth be filled with fire?
Will I laugh or will I cry? Ah
This time, I'll become everyone and the world will wonder why
