Hold your hands up to your chest
And tell me what you find
Out of you, a sparrow comes
And sees without its eyes

Don't forget who you are even though you are hurt
You are caught in a wire and soon it will burst

You can cry, drinking your eyes
Do you miss the sadness when it is gone? (Gone)
And you let the river run wild (Gone)
And you let the river run wild

I'm a shadow, I am cold
And now I seek for warmth
Stitch your skin onto my skin
And we won't be alone

Don't forget who you are even though you're in need
Like a bird in the night, your emotions deserves to be freed

And you let the river run wild
You can cry (You can cry), drinking your eyes
I don't miss the sadness when it is gone (Gone)
And the feeling of it makes me smile (Gone)
As I let the river run wild

You can cry, you can cry, you can cry
To where the ocean is bigger
Become a part of the river, ah
You can cry, you can cry, you can cry
Can you let the river run wild?

You can cry, drinking your eyes
