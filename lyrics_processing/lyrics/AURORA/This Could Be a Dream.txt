Look up at the light
This could be a dream or it could be real
Dive in to my mind
And don't come up for air, you won't need it here

Can I move you? Can I sooth your fear?
Could you trust love, if I prove it's there?
Oh, I need to know it too
And now I don't feel you

So I lift myself and I close my eyes
And I sing sometimes to know I'm alive
I know I should figure this out on my own
But if you come back could you take me home?
I get back up when the wind is strong
But I wish I knew how it felt to run
I know I'm not alone
And if you come back could you take me home?

Being so alive can hurt so very much
When you're losing touch

But if I touch you, would you feel it there?
Could I trust love, even if I'm scared?
Oh, I wish I could give, like I'm longing to give
Oh, I wish I could live, like I'm longing to live

And I lift myself and I close my eyes
And I sing sometimes to know I'm alive
I know I should figure this out on my own
But if you come back could you take me home?
I get back up when the wind is strong
But I wish I knew how it felt to run
I know I'm not alone
And if you come back could you take me home?

This could be a dream
This could be a dream

And I lift myself and I close my eyes
And I sing sometimes to know I'm alive
I know I should figure this out on my own
But if you come back will you take me home?
I get back up when the wind is strong
But I wish I knew how it felt to run
I know I'm not alone
