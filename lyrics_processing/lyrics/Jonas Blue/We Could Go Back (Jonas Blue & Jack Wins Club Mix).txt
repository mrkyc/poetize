Should have, could have, would have, but it's too late
Shouldn't catch feelings on a first date
Oh-whoa-ah, oh-whoa-ah
0 to 100, no first base
Ended up with coffee back at your place
Oh-whoa-ah, oh-whoa-ah

Every night, it's keeping me awake
I keep thinking about all the things that I would change

If we could go back, ah
Tell me would you even, would you still believe in me?
If we could turn back, ah
Tell me would you even, would you still believe in me?
Go back, go, go back
Go back, go, go back (If we could turn back)
Go back, go, go back
Tell me would you even, would you still believe in me?
Would you still believe in me?

If we could turn back
Go back, go, go back
Go back, go, go back
Would you still believe in me?

Tryna win your heart but it's no race
Never had the time to find our own pace
Oh-whoa-ah, oh-whoa-ah
Tryna drown feelings that won't go away
Sleep in the bed of my own mistakes
Oh-whoa-ah, oh-oh-oh-whoa-ah

Every night, it's keeping me awake
I keep thinking about all the things that I would change

If we could go back, ah
Tell me would you even, would you still believe in me?
If we could turn back, ah
Tell me would you even, would you still believe in me?
Go back, go, go back
Go back, go, go back
(If we could turn back)
Ah, tell me would you even, would you still believe in me?
Would you still believe in me?
If we could turn back
Go back, go, go back
Go back, go, go back
If we could turn back
Go back, go, go back
Go back
Would you still believe in me?
Go back, go, go back
Go back, go, go back
Go back, go, go back
