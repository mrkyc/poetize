All my life I've been a good girl
Tryna do what's right, never told no lies
Then you came around and suddenly my world
Turned upside down, now there's no way out

I tried to fight against it, shut out what all my friends said
Can't get you out of my head, oh-woah-woah-woah-woah
I keep letting you in, though I know it's not a good thing
I got you under my skin, oh-woah-woah-woah

You're so outta line
You make me bad and I don't know why
But that's what I like about ya
Yeah, that's what I like about ya
I'm out of my mind
You got me runnin' all the red lights
But that's what I like about ya
Yeah, that's what I like about ya
