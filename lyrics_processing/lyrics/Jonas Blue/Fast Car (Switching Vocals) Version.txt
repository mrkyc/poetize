I want a ticket to anywhere
Maybe we make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere
Any place is better
Starting from zero got nothing to lose
Maybe we'll make something
Me myself I got nothing to prove
You got a fast car
I got a plan to get us out of here
I've been working at a convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
Won't have to drive too far
Just 'cross the border and into the city
You and I can both get jobs
And finally see what it means to be living
So I remember when we were driving
Driving in your car
Speed so fast felt like I was drunk
And a city lights lay out before us
And your arms felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I, had a feeling that I belong
I, had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone

He lives with the bottle that's the way it is
He says his body's too old for working
His body's too young to look like his
My mama went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
I said somebody's got to take care of him
So I quit school and that's what I did
So I remember when we were driving
Driving in your car
Speed so fast felt like I was drunk
And a city lights lay out before us
And your arms felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I, had a feeling that I belong
I, had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone
You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
We gotta make a decision
