Should've, could've, would've, but it's too late
Shouldn't catch feelings on a first date, oh, oh
Zero to one hundred, no first base
Ended up with coffee back at your place, oh, oh

Every night is keeping me awake
I keep thinking about all the things that I would change

If we could go back, ah
Tell me, would you even? Would you still believe in me?
If we could turn back, ah
Tell me, would you even? Would you still believe in me?

Go back, go, go back (Hey)
Go back, go, go back (Hey)

Tryna win your heart, but it's no race
Never had a time to find our own pace, oh, oh
Tryna drown feelings that won't go away
Sleep in the bed of my own mistakes, oh, oh

If we could go back, ah
Tell me, would you even? Would you still believe in me?

Tell me, would you even? Would you still believe in me?

Go back, go, go back (Hey)
Go back, go, go back (Hey)

I know time waits for no man
I'm standing here now with no plans
Let's go back, go, go, back (Hey)
I know time waits for no man
I'm standing here now with no plans
Let's go back, go, go, back

If we could go back, ah (Yeah)
Tell me, would you even? Would you still believe in me?
If we could turn back, ah (If we could come back, oh)
Tell me, would you even? (Yeah, yeah) Would you still believe in me?
Go back, go, go back
(Tell me would you still believe in me?)
Go back, go, go back
Go back, go, go back (Me, me)
(Tell me, would you believe?)
