A night flight out to D.C
Phone rings with the news
My God, I'm so excited
It's time to look for baby shoes, yes
Everyone says I'm glowing
From a heart filled with joy
Too soon to be showing
Is it a girl is it a boy?

Found out you're my darling girl
Don't you know you change my world?
You're my little doll so sweet
You nearly knock me off my feet
You're my little darling child
Seeing you makes me smile
God bless the day He sent my little angel to me, mmm

Here's my favorite picture
When you were ten minutes old
And we were right there with ya
To wrap you up and keep you warm
And now that you're a little older, older
I see your personality
Every time that I hold ya
I'm sure you'll know much more than me
