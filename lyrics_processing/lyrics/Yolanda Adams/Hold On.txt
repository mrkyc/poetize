You've got dreams and
You've got goals
There's a vision burning down in your soul
Hold on
There's nothing that you can't do
You've gotta be driven
Motivated too
Stir up the gift that God has placed in you
Hold on
The future's looking bright for you

No matter how hard it seems (No matter how hard it seems)
Never give up, always believe
Hold on, hold on to your dreams (Hold on to your dreams)
(No, no, no) Though you're facing adversities (You gotta know)
You can still be all you wanna be (Just hold on)
Hold on, hold on to your dreams

Determination is the key
In this cold world, if you're gonna succeed
Hold on
There's nothing that you can't do
Don't be discouraged by the trials you face
'Cause your beautiful mind would be a terrible thing to waste
Hold on, hold on
The future's looking bright for you
