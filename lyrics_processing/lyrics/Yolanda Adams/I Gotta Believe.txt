Oh, oh, talk about it, talk about it

You know life, has its ups and downs
(Talk about it)
It can turn your pretty face to an ugly frown
Seems that when I face one thing, another one comes
Clouding up my vision, but I can feel the sun
I believe that I can do this; I know that I can win
Just as long as I have His love within

I believe that I can make it (Make it)
I can make it through the night
I believe that I can walk on (Walk on)
With my head held high
I believe that I am special (Special) in every way
But in order to have my victory, I gotta believe
Oh, oh, oh yeah
(Oh, take your time and tell the world you'll make it)

I have to see myself at the finish line
(Talk about it)
I have to visualize that everything will fall in line, uh-huh
(Talk about it)
I have to visualize the land while riding through the storm
I have to trust in my Father and open up my heart
I know that I can do this, I know that I can win
Just as long as I have His love within
