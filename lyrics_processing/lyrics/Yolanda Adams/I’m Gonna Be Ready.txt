I say a prayer every night
Whatever I do, I'll get it right
With no regret, no guilt or shame
This time, no not this time
Once I surrender, I won't dare look back
'Cause if I do, I'll get off track
Move ahead in faith, and patiently await
Your answer what will it be

Sight beyond what I see
You know what's best for me
Prepare my mind, prepare my heart
For whatever comes, I'm gonna be ready
Strength to pass any test
I feel like I'm so blessed
With you in control, I can't go wrong
'Cause I always know, I'm gonna be ready

I was free to do, what I wanted to
Lost everything, but I still had you
You showed me your grace, now my life's renewed
And I thank you, yes, I thank you
So I'll tell anyone who'll listen, I'll testify
About how good you were to me
When so call friends passed me by
The fact that you would show somebody
So broke down, so much mercy
