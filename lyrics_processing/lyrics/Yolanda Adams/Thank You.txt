When I think about how You saved my soul
I'm compelled to praise You, like a woman out of control
So I lift up holy hands
I take advantage of this chance to say thank You, mmm, yeah
When I think about what You brought me through
I'm reminded to praise You for all that You had to do
So I lift up holy hands
I take advantage of this chance to say thank You

So from the bottom of my heart I say
(Thank) Oh Lord (Thank) I (Thank You) Thank You
Oh, oh, oh, I just wanna say (Thank)
Gotta say (Thank), thank you (Thank You)
Oh Lord, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

When I think about where You brought me from
I gotta praise You like the victories already won
And I lift my hands
I take advantage of this chance to say thank You, oh yes
When I think about, oh Lord, yes, why You love me so
I'm compelled to praise You because
I really don't care who's looking and who knows that I love You
And I lift up my holy hands
I take advantage of this chance to say thank You
