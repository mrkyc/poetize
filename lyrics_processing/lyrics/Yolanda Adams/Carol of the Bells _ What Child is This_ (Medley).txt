What Child is this who came to earth
Through Mary was born of a virgin birth
What Child is this, the Son of Man
From Heaven, was sent with His plan

Hark, how the bells, sweet silver bells
Christmas is here, bringing the cheer

What Child is this who laid to rest
On Mary's lap is sleeping
Whom angels greet with anthems sweet
While shepherds watch are keeping

Oh, this, this is Christ the King
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing
Haste, haste, to bring Him laud
The Babe, the Son of Mary
(Hark, how the bells; hark, how the bells
Sweet silver bells; sweet silver bells)
Christmas is here
(Christmas is here, Christmas is here
Bringing the cheer, bringing the cheer)
To young and old
(To young and old, meek and the bold, oh, how they pound)
Raising the sound, the songs of good cheer
Merry, Merry, Merry, Merry Christmas, Christmas is here
(Merry, Merry, Merry, Merry Christmas)
Christmas is here
Christmas is here
