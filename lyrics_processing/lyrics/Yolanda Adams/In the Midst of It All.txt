I've come through many hard trials
Through temptations on every hand
Though Satan's tried to stop me
And to place my feet on sinking sand
Through the pain and all of my sorrows
Through the tears and all of my fears
The Lord was there to keep me
For He's kept me in the midst of it all

Not because I've been so faithful
Not because I've always obeyed
No, it's not because I trusted Him
To be with me all of the way
But it's because He loves me so dearly
He was there to answer my call
He was there always to protect me
For He's kept me in the midst of it all

I've come through (Oh yes, I have) many hard trials
(Through temptation on every hand)
Through temptations on every hand
(And Satan was there)
Though Satan's tried to stop me (Trying to stop me)
And to place my feet (On sinking sand) on sinking sand

(To answer every call, yes, He was, He was there)
There always (Always) to protect me
(To protect me, and He kept)
For He's kept me in the midst of it all
