Hold on and don't give up
Don't you worry
You don't have to cry
'Cause He, He sees what you're going through
Yes, He does

God is willing, and He is able
This did not catch Him by surprise
So just trust Him
And just, oh, step aside

Be still and don't question it
These obstacles, they were allowed
He wants to take you higher and higher
If you will hold on

God is willing and more than able
This did not catch Him by surprise
So just trust him
And just step aside

Oh, oh, oh, I know he's faithful
My God is faithful
To do what he said he'll do
Now, if He said it, just believe it
There's nothing He can't do
You must stand on his word (Stand on his word)
Cast all your cares on him (Give them to him)
'Cause he knows and he loves you
He did it for me, that's why I can say
Step (Step), just step aside (Gotta step aside)
God can work a miracle for you (Step)
Step aside (Gotta step aside)
You got to let go (Step)
And let God (Gotta step aside)
Let go (Step)
And let God be God (Gotta step aside)
Move yourself out of the way (Step)
Move your pride out of the way (Gotta step aside)
He'll never leave you, nor forsake you (Step)
That's what I know, it ain't just what I heard (Gotta step aside)
So I thank you, Lord (Thank you, Lord)
For being awesome to me (Wonderful)
You're marvelous (Marvelous)
Praise him, praise Him (Gotta step aside)
Oh, (Step) step aside (Step)
Let go, let go, let go (Step)
Let go, let go (Gotta step aside)
He knows what you go through (Step)
He knows what you can bear (Step)
He can do what you can't do (Step)
So step, so step, so step aside (Gotta step aside)
Thank You, Lord
And You're in control
