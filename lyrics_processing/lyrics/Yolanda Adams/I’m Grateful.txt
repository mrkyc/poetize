I woke up this morning
Growth in my right mind
Counting all the blessings
I've had in my lifetime
I'm so fortunate to have someone like God
Heavenly Father
When I was having so many problems
No one but Him could help me solve them
He stepped in and He made everything okay
And for this I'm so grateful

I'm grateful (Oh, oh)
So thankful (I'm thankful)
To be in the land of the living (I'm grateful)
I'm grateful (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
I'm so thankful (To be in the land of the living)
To be in the land of the living

I don't mind sharing my testimony
To anyone who hear it, 'cause I'm led by the spirit
And it's possible that something I might say
Could help along the way, yeah
Been through the storm but
Here I'm still standing
On solid ground I keep on landing
That's why I have so much faith in God
For His love I'm grateful
