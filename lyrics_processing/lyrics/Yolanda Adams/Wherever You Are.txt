Wherever you are, I wanna be
It's never too far, it don't matter
Just take me there

There's never a place to far
Too far for me to go
'Cause I always feel at home with you
I'll cover the universe and land on every star
If I can find out where you are, it's true

Mountain high, valley low, desert heat, arctic cold
Wherever you are, that's where I want to be
Mountain high, valley low, desert heat, arctic cold
Wherever you are, that's where I want to be

Take me on a vision quest and focus in on me
So you can tell me what you see in me
Please don't let me live a lie
Let me live in honesty
'Cause you're the only truth that can set me free
That's why I want to go
