You may see me laughing
You may see me crying
But you won't see me give up
I'll just keep on trying
Though sometimes it get hard
Hard to see my way
But I've got you in my life
It's makes it all okay, yeah

Nothing comes today
When you're treating me this way
And I thank You Lord for treating me so good (So good)
There are times when I get scared
But I'll know that You'll be there
And You'll pull me out of it for sure (For sure)

There are times I'm up
There are times I'm down
There are times I'm smiling
There are times I'm frowned
Sometimes I've done wrong
I still sing my song
Even when I'm weak, I know you make me strong
