I remember the first time, you laughed with me
And I remember the promises, you would never leave my side
Now I'm standing with the news of a tragedy
Standing here with a fragile heart, mmm
You see I never shed a tear
I stayed strong for them, oh yes I did
When everybody disappears
It's only you that kept me strong
And I can't imagine going on
Without you in my life
Going on with a fragile heart

When I think about, think about life
Lord I think of you
I forget about everything else
There's only you and I
And I can't think about ever giving up
Can't give up a fight (no..no..)
The only thing that matters Lord, is you

I ain't got no time to pretend
That I'm not missing you, oh no no no no
I know you're in good hands
The same hands that hold my heart
And I'll cherish every moment we spent
As a gift from God above
For he takes care of all the fragile hearts

When I think about, think about life
Lord I think of you, and I
Forget about everything else
There's only you lord and I
I can't think about ever, ever giving up
(a fight)
Lord the only thing that matters
When I'm going through
Is giving my fragile heart right back to you

You see my fragile heart's been broken
And you're the only one
Who can put it all together again
So I'm trusting you Lord to see me through

There's only you and I
I can't think about ever giving
I can't give up(up a fight)
The only thing that matters
When I'm going through
Is giving my fragile heart right back to you

When I think about my life
I, I, I, I forget about everything else
Only you and I, and I can't think about ever giving up
Can't give up, can't give up
