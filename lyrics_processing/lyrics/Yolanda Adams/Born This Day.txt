Christmas is the day
The angels came to say
They said be not afraid
For born on this day
Born to save is Christ the Lord
Shepherds watched by night
When that angel appeared from on high
And said be not afraid for born on this day
Born to save is Christ the Lord
Christ the Lord

Wise men from afar
Said they followed the eastern star
Followed it to this place
For born on this day
Born to save is Christ the Lord

Born this day
Christmas day
Born to save the world is Christ the Lord
Born this day
Christmas day
Born to save the world is Christ the Lord
Oh yeah, oh yeah
