Would you ever dare to believe you were made for so much more?
Dreaming was a luxury that you could not afford
If you had the chance to see what's behind that closed door
Your worries would all be erased

So no matter how dark the night
Know that you were created to fly

See the flowers grow when they dance in the rain
And new life only shows after a mother's pain
So you gotta be strong, you're too close to your change
And soon the whole world will know your story
Don't give up, you're one moment from glory, glory
Don't give up, you're one moment from glory

Remember to guard your heart from the voices you hear
Ones of negativity and reminiscent of fear
Whenever you feel alone (Ooh), know that God's love is near (Ooh)
You are not the mistakes that you make (Ah)

So no matter how dark the night (Dark the night)
Know that you were created to fly (Created to fly)
