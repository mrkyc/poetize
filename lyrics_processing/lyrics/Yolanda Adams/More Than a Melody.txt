In the still of a moment; my voice can be heard
So listen carefully, there music inside each word
I am the Composer, of the melody of life
So, take upon my yoke learn of me, I'll be your guiding light
I am the Director, Be part of My symphony
I speak peace unto the storms; even the winds obey Me
Let me be your song, you'll never have to walk alone
I will help carry on, carry on

I am the music within the inner ear
Hearken unto my voice, I'll declare, I'll draw near
I am the rythym to every beat of your heart
And, If you'll place your trust in me I'll never ever part
So, let Me be your song, you'll never have to walk alone
I will help you carry on, onnn

When the notes are formed (They make)
They make a special sound (the music inside the music)
The music inside the music (It lifts me when I'm down, I'm more than)
More than the beat of time (so much more)
More than the lyric more than
More than just a melody (More than just a ryhme)
More than just a rhyme, more than just a melody, come unto me
