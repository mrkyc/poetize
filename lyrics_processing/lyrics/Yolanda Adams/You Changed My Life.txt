You changed my life
You changed my life

So many nights I wondered
About this day I pondered
When you just stepped right in
I didn't know what to do
All I knew is I needed you and you rescued me
And you changed my life
Honoring this union
We were joined and now we are one
I love you forever, I'm gonna leave you never
Every day more and more is wonderful who I adore
I'm not the same since you came

(You changed my life)
Love went into my heart you came, yeah
(You changed my life)
You came into my life
I'm no longer the same

Now that I have you with me all of my life beside me
I'm free indeed
You said you'd never leave me lonely
If I made you my one and only love
And now you are my life

It's in you I live and to you my life I give
You can make me what you want
Full of glory ('Cause I wanna be)
Every day's a brighter day
'Cause you're with me all the way
I'm not the same since you came, since you came
Oh

(You changed my life)
Oh, you changed my life (You changed my life)
(You changed my life)
When into my heart you came, you
(You changed my life)
You changed my life
Oh, oh, oh, I'll never be the same

Today is the first day of the rest of my life
To be more of what you want me to be
And I promise to cherish what God has bestowed upon me
'Cause you

(You changed my life)
You changed my life
And I'll never be the same
No, no, no, no
(You changed my life)
I'm so glad you decided to bring your whole life to me
(You changed my life)
So glad you came into my life
(You changed my life)
You came and you changed me
You came and you changed me
You came and you changed me
You came and you changed me
(You changed my life)
Honor this union, Lord
(You changed my life)
