Say that you're not afraid
You're just fine
Got it all figured out this time
All of the plans you made will work out
Deep inside you have your doubts
But you're clinging to your pride
And you trust don't know you're free to let it go

'Cause even when it rains outside
(There is light)
Even when you cry all night
(You're alright)
Even when you lose your way
(You'll get through) You'll get through
'Cause there is someone watching over you

You say you've been hurt before, you're afraid
That you'll never love again
And why should you take a chance just to fall
But you'd rather build a wall
Than believe that you are loved
Open up your heart
Someone needs you as you are
