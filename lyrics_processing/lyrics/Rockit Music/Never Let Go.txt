I was in love
Woah-oh, woah-oh
Woah-oh, woah-oh

Holed up in the kinder, it's a Garten
Kids are missin', now it's lookin' so abandoned
Bad plans, he must be a bad man
Playin' in the room, now gone, got it bad from the Banban
No chance, understand that I'm broken
Lookin' for the ones that did it, it's a sick joke
I'm choked at the thought of it, dizzy, I'm out of it
I won't stop 'til they're back from the Banban

Radio, radio, radio waves
Lookin' lifelike (Lifelike) with their bright eyes (Bright eyes)
Radio, radio, radio waves
Lookin' lifelike (Lifelike) with their bright eyes (Bright eyes)
Echoes in the playroom, I'm bouncin' off the walls
Will you come home soon? I'm dronin' through the halls

I'll never let go, I'm hangin' on
Missin' you, missin' me, missin' everything
I'll never let go, I'm hangin' on (Yeah)
Missin' you, missin' me, missin' everything
You might also like
How should one feel when their world gets rocked?
Like what I have is all gone, where all is lost?
I wanna vomit, I'm sick to my stomach, it's all wrong
Monsters are walkin' among us, I'm not strong
Snatched right in front of me, outta my control
So low, oh no, these parents, they don't know
What they're getting into when they bring their kids into the Garten of the Banban
Now we let our fears unfold

Radio, radio, radiowaves
Lookin' lifelike (Lifelike) with their bright eyes (Bright eyes)
Radio, radio, radiowaves
Lookin' lifelike (Lifelike) with their bright eyes (Bright eyes)
Echoes in the playroom, I'm bouncin' off the walls
Will you come home soon? I'm dronin' through the halls

I'll never let go, I'm hangin' on
Missin' you, missin' me, missin' everything
I'll never let go, I'm hangin' on (Yeah)
Missin' you, missin' me, missin' everything

I'll never let go, I'm hangin' on
Missin' you, missin' me, missin' everything (I was in love)
I'm hangin' on (Woah-oh, woah-oh)
Missin' you, missin' me, missin' everything
I'll never let go, I'm hangin' on
Missin' you, missin' me, missin' everything
I'll never let go, I'm hangin' on (Yeah)
Missin' you, missin' me, missin' everything

I was in love
Woah-oh, woah-oh
