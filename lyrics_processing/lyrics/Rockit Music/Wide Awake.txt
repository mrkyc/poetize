Lonely, depression
I fix sadness, do you want a bear hug?
My heart hangs on my neck
Put a thorn in your back
Deep down, I'm a mean one

Be brilliant, be good
Big brained and I'm drenched in blood
Blue forever, friends to keep
Take whatever when you're fast asleep

Loosen up the noose
Stick my head in 'cause I gotta get used to this
Sleepwalk nights again

Wide awake
It's the night we take
Were we ever even really enough?
Now you see what we've become
Wide awake (Wide awake)
It's the night we take (Night we take)
Were we ever even really enough?
Now you see what we've become
You might also like
You're so beautiful (Ooh-ooh), such a lovely one
You should paint the world (Ooh-ooh), art is such a drug
Never sleepin' when I'm stayin' for the weekend
More insane than every critter
Yeah, I'm tweakin'

Kickin', kickin, kickin' your teeth in
Hate feels good when the kicking-in's easy
Stay cool
'Cause I feed on all your pain endured

Loosen up the noose
Stick my head in, 'cause I gotta get used to this
Sleepwalk nights again

Wide awake
It's the night we take
Were we ever even really enough?
Now you see what we've become
Wide awake (Wide awake)
It's the night we take (Night we take)
Were we ever even really enough?
Now you see what we've become
Sunshine rays
Givin' out praise
Tearin' up my toys these dog-gone days
Stuck in my ways, off-leash bark that stays
Sleep, sleep, sleep, I'ma put you in the sheets now
Tuck you real tight
Get you countin' all the sheep now
Don't you cry from that fear inside

Loosen up the noose
Stick my head in, 'cause I gotta get used to this
Sleepwalk nights again

Wide awake
It's the night we take
Were we ever even really enough?
Now you see what we've become
Wide awake (Wide awake)
It's the night we take (Night we take)
Were we ever even really enough?
Now you see what we've become
I've been eatin' too good, I'm in trouble (I'm in trouble)
Gimme one cheeseburger, make it double (Make it double)
I can't sleep no more
Poppy Gas, yeah, we need some more
Keep calm
Watch you sleep
Recalled, I'm easily pleased
Forever is the long-time nap you need

Loosen up the noose
Stick my head in, 'cause I gotta get used to this
Sleepwalk nights again

Wide awake
It's the night we take
Were we ever even really enough?
Now you see what we've become
Wide awake (Wide awake)
It's the night we take (Night we take)
Were we ever even really enough?
