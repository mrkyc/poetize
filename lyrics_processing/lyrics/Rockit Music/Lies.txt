You question what I have done, I see who you really are (Are)
Word is there's someone among us
Is it you? Is it me? We can't ever agree
'Cause you're a madman with a bad plan
You've got them under your thumb, you're so demandin'
That's what impostors would say to make the truth go away
Don't point your finger at me, I wonder who

(Is it you?) Who's the killer?
(Is it me?) I'm the killer!
Lies, tell me lies, who's been tellin' all these lies?
(Is it you?) Who's the killer?
(Is it me?) I'm the killer!
Lies, tell me lies, who's been tellin' all these lies?

Sound the alarm, we found another one (Another one)
A ghost and half a body, might be what we all become
Gather 'round the table, let's discuss who we think is among us
Who not to trust
So we got some clues to build off of, it's enough to find the impostor
What do we got to lose if we all accuse the wrong guy? We'll need a good doctor (Medic!)
Let's breakdown what happened, the guilty are laughin'
We'll see through their cracks and disguise

Lies, tell me lies, who's been tellin' all these lies?

Lies, tell me lies, who's been tellin' all these lies?
Lies, lies, who's been tellin' all these lies?
All these lies (Lies), lies, who's been tellin' all these lies?

I've got a sneaking suspicion that this particular mission's gonna be bloody difficult, isn't it?
Because people are tricky, manipulative, and given any reason to kill, they'll take the privilege
Are we deceitful, misleading, or evil? A little bit of each, though we're pleading our innocence
Wasn't me, well it could've been, but if I did it, would I really be dumb enough to be admittin' it?
You can see the bits of the ship I've visited, and witness that it's clean, nothing suspicious, got rid of it
Now there's three of us living the predicament is picking whether he did it, she did it, or whether we did it
Can't trust you now, can't trust you now, can't trust you now
Can't trust you now, can't trust you now, can't trust you now, can't trust you now

(Is it you?) Who's the killer? (Yeah, yeah, yeah!)
(Is it me?) I'm the killer!
Lies, tell me lies, who's been telling all these lies?
(Is it you?) Who's the killer?
(Is it me?) I'm the killer!
Lies, tell me lies, who's been tellin' all these lies?
Lies, lies, who's been tellin' all these lies?
