(Ooh-ooh-ooh) I'm stuck here
Lost down here

Beneath the surface, tumble down under-world
You see, I'm nervous, monsters creep and they lurk
Make your decision, let them live or to die?
While solvin' puzzles with a sentient guide
So I have got the monster munchies, and I'm cravin' a bite, and I
Don't know if I want to keep these monsters alive
So tell me another (Under-Under-Undertale)
So tell me another (Under-Under-Undertale)

I'm stuck here
Lost down here, so tell me another

I'm stuck here in the underground city
Lost down here, so tell me another (Under-Under-Undertale)
So tell me another (Under-Under-Undertale)
So tell me another

Betrayed by Flowey and he's seekin' my soul
The savior monster and her name's Toriel
Inside a story and I can't catch a break
Too many endings deep inside of this game
So I have got the monster munchies, and I'm cravin' a bite, and I
Don't know if I want to keep these monsters alive
So tell me another (Under-Under-Undertale)
So tell me another (Under-Under-Undertale)

We need to kill this kid, give me the seventh soul
I'm a carnivorous monster with a childish goal
I'm on a roll with the best, six souls in my chest
In this world, I will conquer, and these kids, I will slaughter
Think you can tame the beast? I'm hiding under your sheets
Do you play for keeps? I got souls to reap
Want to see what's underneath a monster cock with teeth?
It's got eyes that see, it has it's own heartbeat

I'm stuck here in the underground city (Yeah!)
