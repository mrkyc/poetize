Delicious, so delicious
Delicious, so delicious
With a dash of salt and a little bit of pepper
Delicious, so delicious
Delicious, so delicious
With a dash of salt and a little bit of pepper

It's so delicious
Won't you please come and cook with us tonight?
With a dash of salt and a little bit of pepper
This course was made for you fools
You know we rigged it so you'll die (You'll die)
With a dash of salt and a little bit of pepper

One, two, punch you and the cops for lunch (Ha!)
I got my mob on the line and I'm droppin' bombs
So let me spin the disc, soundwaves, they get thin
Like an ant on a hill, I'ma suck you in

Gnomes, they come lookin' for gold, woah there
Knocked my tooth out (Oh no), oh no, who goes there?
Glum to some, guess I'm sad to love
Callin' gaggles of my geese, double-crossed for blood
You might also like
Mortimer the mortician with the premonitions
My crystal ball's cloudy, snowin' all over my victims
An ice, cold mug for a storm that's 'bout to brew
It's aurora bore-all over for you!

When you hear my moo (Moo), step into my saloon
I'll be pullin' out your pockets with a heavy vacuum
Yes, I'm the wurst, tin cans to burst
You got beef with me? A sausage dessert

The bulldogs, we're the hogs on it (Rah, rah, rah)
Huntin' in a pack, top shelf, top ramen (*growl*)
Doggonit! Howlin' at the moon, chomp on it (Woo!)
Yankees of the sky, no, we're not fallin' (Ow)

Delicious, so delicious

You know we rigged it so you'll die (You'll die)
With a dash of salt and a little bit of pepper

One by one by one, your chance at victory is done
Simpleminded pawns and we're headless, on the run (Ha!)
No more usin' your gun, armor stronger than strong
You can only Parry heads, knockin' them off (Yup)

With a sword and a shield, I'll be knockin' you down
In the hall of the Knight, hit you with a fake-out
Come a little closer, hit ya with a wild swing
Jumpin' off my mane, dealin' me a good sting

Here's the Bishop, you're cups on my wishlist
My heads spin 'round, I see all of your business
Every angle in my sight, burnin' candles for the light
I am just, I am right, singin', all rise
Sharpen up my blade with a mask on my face
Got an ax, here to slash off your head, better brace
Smashin' through the cups, causin' cracks, I'm the crux
I'm the Rook with a guillotine, trap, better duck

Count my money, need a phat raise! (Cha-ching)
Keeper of the Pawns, queen of the bad days
Stackin' up my lions, roar with a new phase
Cannonballs, aim, fire, now, it's a checkmate

Delicious, so delicious
Delicious, so delicious
With a dash of salt and a little bit of pepper

You know we rigged it so you'll die (You'll die)
With a dash of salt and a little bit of pepper

It's one hell of a dream with an angel and a demon!
Burn it all down, souls we'll be stealin'
Walls with the fire, balls come to fight
Water from the choir, and the flood is on the rise

So here we are, with a final dish to die for
A Wondertart, silly mugs, I've had an eye for
Pile up the sodium, devoted to the holy one
The Devil's only finished when the deed is done

Delicious, so delicious
Delicious, so delicious
With a dash of salt and a little bit of pepper
Delicious, so delicious
Delicious, so delicious
