Roll or die, roll or die, rollin'
Roll or die, roll or die, rollin'
Roll or die, roll or die, rollin'
Roll or die, roll or die, rollin'

Feelin' frantic in the Botanic Panic
With the Root Pack jammin', now we're feelin' organic
Gettin' full, eatin' all these vegetables
Potato, an onion, a carrot lookin' psycho

Goopy Le Grande, kill you in the first degree
Rest in peace with a boss like me (Yeah!)
Bouncin' up and down with a globbity hop (What? Huh?)
I'm a slippery slugger with my boxing gloves

Flappin' those wings all the way in the sky
I'm a Threatenin' Zeppelin coming to join the fight
They call me Hilda Berg, I'm on an all-time high
Takin' out you Cupheads, (Float) float up on cloud nine (Nine)

(Woo! Ah!) Come into my Floral Fury, gettin' worried
Allergies actin' up, vision gettin' blurry (Ah!)
Cagney Carnation, causin' frustration
Droppin' seeds on top of you, I bring the pollination
You might also like
Wake us up inside 'cause the bosses own the night
Says the contract that we signed 'cause we roll or die, roll or die, rollin'
Gamble with our time because chance is on our side
Will you fold or stack 'em high? 'Cause we roll or die, roll or die, rollin'

Roll or die, roll or die, rollin'
Roll or die, roll or die, rollin'
Roll or die, roll or die, rollin'
Roll or die, roll or die, rollin' (Hoo-woo!)

Fightin' souls ever since we been some tadpoles
Windin' up a punch, double team 'em, take control
Call us Clip Joint Calamity, you'll have to scream profanity
While stackin' up your losses, you've become another casualty (Bye!)

Now, I won't sugarcoat it, I'm the greatest, bound to win
Baroness Von Bon Bon, I'm the candy queen of sin
Lackin' chin, I can see it, other demons gettin' scared
In the Sugarland Shimmy, man, you better come prepared (Oh-hoo!)

You hang around this Pyramid, you're bound to be in Peril (Woo)
'Cause the genie don't grant wishes and this puppet's actin' feral (Yeah)
Slappin' cups and mugs around, you could never take the heat
Master demon's got you chokin' on a streak, always play for keeps
Come into the carnival and hang out with the clown (Woo!)
Beppi doesn't bite, swear it's safe, so come on down (Ha-ha!)
We've been entertaining demons longer than you've been alive
Come and see what happens if you take a ride, take a look inside

Wake us up inside 'cause the bosses own the night
Says the contract that we signed 'cause we roll or die, roll or die, rollin'
Gamble with our time because chance is on our side
Will you fold or stack 'em high? 'Cause we roll or die, roll or die, rollin'

Roll or die, roll or die, rollin'
Roll or die, roll or die, rollin'
Roll or die, roll or die, rollin'
Roll or die, roll or die, rollin'

I own the air, don't you dare to try me, better be scared
I got more than just myself in this house, so be aware that
Me and my son have got this fight on lock
I can see your time is coming to an end, tick-tock, yeah!
M-M-M-My fire is a burnin' hot desire
T-T-T-T-Take you down as these clouds, they take you higher
But know that I got three heads, they're gonna keep you spun
Watch the fire march comin' for ya' off my tongue
Dang, you look tasty, now, please don't be hasty
I wanna take ya', make ya' mine, never can leave my hive
Wanna come test me? Gonna try to contest me?
I'm the queen bee, Cuphead, nothing can best me

Ya-ha-ha! Captain Brineybeard here
Only got one eye, but I can see your end is near
So give it your best shot to this mighty sea rover
Is that all you got? Why don't you wake me when it's over?

Wake us up inside ('Side) 'cause the bosses own the night (Own the night)
Says the contract that we signed 'cause we roll or die, roll or die, rollin'
Gamble with our time because chance is on our side
Will you fold or stack 'em high? 'Cause we roll or die, roll or die, rollin'

Roll or die, roll or die, rollin'
Roll or die, roll or die, rollin'
Roll or die, roll or die, rollin'
Roll or die, roll or die, rollin'

(Ooh) Dramatic Fanatic, we're gettin' up on the stage
A big wave works its way, third phase of my game
They're runnin' away, starlet's rage'll make you afraid
Give me an ovation 'cause you starred in my play

Werner Werman here (Ah), call me a Murine
My cannon fires loud, got shot from a spring
Fire streams burnin' up, splittin' you at the seams
Final phase, a cat, I'm controllin' its brain

Dr. Kahl's back, I'll turn you to scrap
With my robot in the junkyard, shootin' out bombs
Do your best, shatter his chest, heart is a mess
Trust me when I say my diamond's the real test

Cala Maria, the mermaid of the sea, yeah
Fishes are my friends, they can kill you in their leisure
Look into my eyes, chill you down to the bone
It'll petrify ya' quick, turn your cup into stone

Wake us up inside 'cause the bosses own the night
Says the contract that we signed 'cause we roll or die, roll or die, rollin' (Rollin'!)
Gamble with our time because chance is on our side (On our side)
Will you fold or stack 'em high? 'Cause we roll or die, roll or die, rollin'

All aboard the Phantom Express
We're a skeletal mess, you got a bone to pick?
Watch your back, on my tracks
Before we turn the heat up and watch your cups go crack

You'd better think twice before you roll the die
'Cause you got one life, so you better get it right
I'm a guy in disguise, wearin' a purple bow-tie
With a grin so big, it'll make you go cross-eyed
You made it this far, it's been a Hell of a Time
Remember when I said you'd be free? Well, I lied
You're in my house now, the flames they will surround
Get ready for your death, we're going deep underground
