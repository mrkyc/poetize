Hear your voice in the monitor
And I don't know what to do
But I follow all your rules, yeah
Hear a knock and it's raining outside
I look in those eyes, I'm closing those blinds
And I'm following your rules, yeah

Night comes, Freddy lets me keep
Lights on, but I can't stand
There's knocking like before
Bonnie's at the door
Wake up, Foxy just left
Now Chica's creeping on me
I can't sleep anymore
What's she waiting for?

How beautiful the night can be
I'm never getting any sleep
I'm losing all my sanity
Have you seen what I've seen?
How beautiful the night can be
I'm living in a memory
I'm losing all my sanity
Have you seen what I've seen?

An infant in a crib
With instructions to help me live
Innocent, what gives?
In the dark and they start, fall apart
Can I win? Resist to quit
Look at the clock, am I caught? Probably not
Many monsters jumping out at me, pretending that I'm not afraid
I gotta see if anything is killing me, stop
Creating all these memories are fading in the dark
Debating with these robots infiltrating 'round the clock
And I thought I lost
And the cradle rocks
Got me stunned, who can I trust?

Night comes, Freddy lets me keep
Lights on, but I can't stand
There's knocking like before
Bonnie's at the door
Wake up, Foxy just left
Now Chica's creeping on me
I can't sleep anymore
What's she waiting for?

How beautiful the night can be
I'm never getting any sleep
I'm losing all my sanity
Have you seen what I've seen?
How beautiful the night can be
I'm living in a memory
I'm losing all my sanity
Have you seen what I've seen?
(Night comes, Freddy lets me keep)
(Lights on, but I can't stand)
(There's knocking like before)
(Bonnie's at the door)
Wake up, Foxy just left
Now Chica's creeping on me
I can't sleep anymore
What's she waiting for?

How beautiful the night can be (How beautiful the night can be)
I'm never getting any sleep (I'm never getting any sleep)
I'm losing all my sanity (I'm losing all my, I'm losing all my)
Have you seen what I've seen?
How beautiful the night can be
I'm living in a memory
I'm losing all my sanity (I'm losing all my sanity)
Have you seen what I've seen? (Have you seen?)

Night comes, Freddy lets me keep
Lights on, but I can't stand
There's knocking like before
Have you seen what I've seen?
Wake up, Foxy just left
Now Chica's creeping on me
I can't sleep anymore
