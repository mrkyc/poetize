(I, I'll never let)
(Uh, misery)

Travelin' through the dark, what's with these floating cars?
I'm pickin' up these pieces of my fragile, broken heart
Cleanin' up the infestation that's been made from terror deep inside
Of God forsaken places, I'm a mess and I'm afraid of bein' infiltrated
They got my mind, musta' been sedated
Feels like the stingin' in my brain
It's like a migraine came and so it must be here to stay
You came by, what did I do to you?
I been brain-fried on an island with you (Yeah)

Oh, oh, oh, the baddest feeling in my bo-o-ones
The only Garten that I know, oh, oh
I'm stuck here searchin' all alo-o-one
Wrap around, your tentacles
I can't breathe when you've got a hold on me
But I'm not scared, I'm not scared of my

Rivals, don't tell me I got time for
(Ah-ah-ah) An eye for an eye, don't take another life from me
I'm not scared of my (Hey)
Rivals, don't tell me I got time for
(Ah-ah-ah) An eye for an eye, don't take (Another life) another life from me
(I'm not scared of my) I'm not scared of my rivals

What do we learn from our dreams? It's a stage for a reckoning
Blessin' me with insights from aquatic enemies
Evil's just a game that I would say we're both winnin' at, so
Place your bets down, put some skin in that stinger
Flynn is back, oh
Banban's Gavanium makes good look bad, gotta hand it to 'em
Brings life into these mannequins, so I'm askin' questions that no one's answerin'
How come this serum's makin' everything smell rancid?
We're sharin' these dreams together, now we're out here stranded, no

Oh, oh, oh, the baddest feeling in my bo-o-ones
The only Garten that I know, oh, oh
I'm stuck here searchin' all alo-o-one
Wrap around, your tentacles
I can't breathe when you've got a hold on me
But I'm not scared, I'm not scared of my

Rivals, don't tell me I got time for
(Ah-ah-ah) An eye for an eye, don't take another life from me (Another life)
I'm not scared of my (I'm not scared)
Rivals (Yeah), don't tell me I got time for (Don't tell me I)
(Ah-ah-ah) An eye for an eye (Yeah), don't take another life from me (Don't take another life from me)
I'm not scared of my
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
