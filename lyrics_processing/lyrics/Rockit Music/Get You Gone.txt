I know you just moved in, but what were you thinkin'?
(Tryna get, tryna get, tryna get-get, get you gone)
I know that you want in, I know that you need in
(Tryna get, tryna get, tryna get-get, get you gone)
Who could've known what I would become?
(Tryna get, tryna get, tryna get-get, get you gone)
What's hidden below? What's behind the door?
(Tryna get, tryna get, tryna get-get, get you gone)
(Get you gone, get you gone)
(Get you, get you, get you gone)

(Two times you've tried to get in my house)
(And I saw you try last night)
You're gonna be sorry
Can't hide, won't find anything inside, I swear it's true
You

You're gonna be sorry
Gonna be
You're gonna be sorry
Gonna be
You're gonna be sorry
Gonna be
You're gonna be sorry

I'm a mystery
Mindin' my own business, why you into me? So into me?
Consider me your enemy, your neighbor with no sympathy, no sympathy
What are you doin' inside of my home? Why don't you leave me alone?
Secrets are hidden that you'll never know, you'll never know
I'm gonna find you, I'm gonna hunt you down
You'll never be found

(Two times you've tried to get in my house)
(And I saw you try last night)
You're gonna be sorry
Can't hide, won't find anything inside, I swear it's true
You

You're gonna be sorry
Gonna be
You're gonna be sorry
Gonna be
You're gonna be sorry
Gonna be
You're gonna be sorry

(Tryna get, tryna get)
(Tryna get, tryna get, tryna get-get, get you gone)

(Tryna get, tryna get, tryna get-get, get you gone)

You're gonna be sorry (Oh-oh-oh)
Gonna be
