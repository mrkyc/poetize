Crashed into a brick wall
Play' Co., my downfall
Don't look in the depths of Hell
Rewind the tape so we know how they felt
Scratching out their face as if they have no name
But they've taken all the places and they have no shame
Taking what they want like it's a goddamn game
And I'm coming back to save whatever's left to save

Critters in the distance, they've got
Wide eyes and drop-chins
They're here for assistance with those
Sharp teeth and big grins
Chitters in the shadows with the
Gas from the kitten
I fear the resistance, put my gas mask on
I could be gone in an instant

I know there's evil inside
Beneath the surface, it hides

There's a deep sleep coming over me
Sitting on the secrets that are buried underneath
Deep sleep coming over me
Sitting on the secrets that are buried underneath
You might also like
Welcome home, now I need you to see
We've been drowning in anxiety
Welcome home, now I need you to see
They've been watching while we are asleep
(We are asleep)

These eyes dilated like
Felines, I proceed to find
These tapes, turn 'em back, rewind
Stories lift up, press up on the spine
These kids, they're stuck in a trance
Bloodlines that end with Playtime
Their dreams never had a chance
Drugged out, stopped in a flatline

They walk in the shadows with those
Sick charms, they glisten
Way back in the blackness, and they
Scurry their way in
Whispers in the nightfall with the
Gas, and it's poison
I dread the night's call, mask on
I take caution, gone in an instant
I know there's evil inside
Beneath the surface, it hides

There's a deep sleep coming over me
Sitting on the secrets that are buried underneath
Deep sleep coming over me
Sitting on the secrets that are buried underneath (Buried underneath)

Welcome home, now I need you to see
We've been drowning in anxiety
Welcome home, now I need you to see
They've been watching while we are asleep
(We are asleep)
Welcome home, now I need you to see (Welcome home now)
We've been drowning in anxiety (We've been drowning)
Welcome home, now I need you to see (Welcome home now)
They've been watching while we are asleep (We've been drowning)

There's a deep sleep coming over me
Sitting on the secrets that are buried underneath (Buried underneath)
Deep sleep coming over me (Coming over me)
