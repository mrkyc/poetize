So confused, how could it ever happen like this?
My cartoons, what did I do to deserve this? (Hey!)
Don't be mislead, he's only tryin' to suck you in
But the truth is it's only in my head, just pretend

Not again, it's intense, I invented this torment
Will he get his revenge?

Shade me with the Ink Machine, Bendy's gonna erase me
These walls tearin' up like paper
Black, white, and the lack of color
Shade me with the Ink Machine

Haha, let's go, Bendy

Bendy's comin' straight outta paper
2D, 3D, to meet his maker
Pop the pen cap, I'm the creator
Made this whole song without an eraser
Why does he want me? Why does he haunt me?
Is it 'cause he's lonely wanting a sense of belonging?
A cartoon that is watching everything I do, it's exhausting
(I got ink all over me)
These halls, trap doors and false walls, ink splats, I slip up and I fall
Plummet, I crash down, making a fracture
My foot breaks, no, I'll never get out
Stunned, he's lookin' at me with a grin, can't run
Jumping to scare me, it's humorous, huh?
Bendy and the Ink Machine, sorry, apologies!
