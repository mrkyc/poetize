Who's this dude grinnin' at me?
Got two horns and a bad attitude
Take my fans
Everybody's gonna come runnin' back when they have the chance
Playin' Bendy feels empty
What's the budget? Was it less than a penny?
Ha-ha, now I'm just bein' funny
No, but really, Bendy
Why are you still trending?
So what? You think you're the Devil?
Guess what? You're messin' with metal
So successful, this is what I was meant for
Takin' fools out, thinkin' they're takin' over
Grow up, and stick to your cartoons
Back off, or face imminent doom
No room for us two you will lose
So screwed, just a fad that will pass through

My name is Freddy, a deadly teddy
My teeth are sinkin' deep in under your skin (Under your skin)

My name is Bendy, the ink is spreading (Spreading)
In my machine, I'm drownin' all of your friends (All of your friends)

All I wanna do is talk about jumpscares
Nightmares, old news
Freddy's just a fuckin' teddy bear
Who cares? Robotic death stares
My ink will raise hell, so prepare
You know that I'll hack and slash
Freddy's rap is bleedin' black
My dark past, a final draft
Turn Freddy on, but he'll die fast
Kinda cute that he hangs with a Baby
I'mma kill you, gonna bring Sammy with me
Freddy's ugly, so you might scream, "Shade me!"
But I'm the one who's gonna kill you in a bad dream
Don't let this teddy bear feed you his lies (His lies, lies)
He's just another to meet his demise (Demise)
