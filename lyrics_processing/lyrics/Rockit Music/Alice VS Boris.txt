Take apart your limbs so I can see what's buried underneath
Sewin' up my only target
Covered up with ink, it's hard to breathe, I told you not to leave
Demonize a lonely artist
I'm feelin' I can cope with living life alone
What's home? Who knows?
You caught me once before, I'm breaking down the doors
Outrun dark love

And I want you back (You can't have me)
Stoppin' all the blood flow like a heart attack (Replicate me)
Come home, you were built to last (You can't have me)
Givin' you a body, you can't have it back (Replicate me)
Come home

Not sure what you've done with me, laid out like an amputee
Have you even heard me speak? Break the silence
Let me out, I've stayed my keep, an angel feeds on heinous deeds
Lashing out with demon wings, screeching siren (Siren)
I'll never have to cope with livin' life alone
You're home, who knows?
I caught you once before, you're breaking down the doors
Can't run from love
You might also like
And you want me back (Let me have you)
Stoppin' all the blood flow like a heart attack (Finally have you)
No home, I was built to last (Let me have you)
Givin' me a body, you can't have it back (Finally have you)
No home

Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ah-ah-ah-ah

And I want you back (You can't have me)
Stoppin' all the blood flow like a heart attack (Replicate me)
Come home, you were built to last (You can't have me)
Givin' you a body, you can't have it back (Replicate me)
Come home (And you won't)
And you want me back (Let me have you)
Stoppin' all the blood flow like a heart attack (Finally have you)
No home, I was built to last (I was built to last, let me have you)
Givin' me a body, you can't have it back (Finally have you, can't have it back)
