Overclock take our knowledge
Push it farther, man!
Movin' faster than
A fiber-optic hologram
I pack a punch even harder
Than a spartan can!
But there ain't no HALO here
We don't want your guardians
We've become machine
Even more than ever
Who needs a soldier anymore
A cyborg is better
If you don't wanna die
We're awaiting your surrender
Terminator status:
Without the Schwarzenegger
Want some of this?
Promise I'm not gonna miss
Comin' at you from the hip
When I'm done you'll be nothin'
But a bloody mess
Off the walls
On the fritz
Cybernetics we're running this
Bringing the robotic apocalypse
Black Ops, anonymous
If you're not with us
You're not gonna win
Don't make me call
Our mothership
Power core drop it in
Shock 'em all, watch 'em twitch
Not a meteorologist
But I've been forecasting ALL of this!
Call that rolling thunder in
Rockit, drop a bomb on them
You might also like
Back with a gut punch, you will see
Nobody can beat me and JT
Call of Duty brutality
The next hit after Fatalities
Let's get back as I talk about black ops
Suit up and I play like it's non-stop
Best in the series, it's right up on top
I'm killing for days you better call the cops
... Oh wait,wait ... don't do that

No need to say I'm sorry!
Pull back to the Line of Duty
I know I shouldn't go back
The future is always black
We're better off dead in
Black Ops 3!!!

We're back, we're here to paint it black
My mind it seems to never sleep
We're better off dead
In Black Ops 3

Interfacing mentally
Less of a man than a machine
Guess that I'm better than you'll ever be
Your cold blooded enemy
My heat signature will never be seen
Step up to me and I'll bet that you'll bleed
Bred to be deadly, a sentient weapon
The pharoh to your peasant, see
Red dot sight I'll never need
Make an SVG look so dope
When I trick-shot, no-scope
Running and Gunning Gung Ho
Give me flack I'll give you more
Anywhere from Zurich to Singapore
Ante up, set the score
Taking over like a Man-O-War
What's up it's Laidyslayer
I'm here to educate ya
For all those fuckin' haters
I'm a femme fatale dictator
Military technology robotic anthropology
With no sense of apology
I'm a bitch so back up off me
Donnie's gone way up in the air
Gravity spikes drop down right there
Fast blast and I hit the glass
You can't beat two tits and an ass
You can't see me wall riding
Two stories up kill guaranteed
A master in murder with three degrees
Six in a row: Killing streak!

Damn Laidy, you straight up killed it
See a doctor, I do recommend it
Crazier than JT expected
Black Ops 3 is fuckin' hectic
Treyarch's back with the best in class
Activision can suck my ass
Exo what I already forgot
Running on wall like a Titanfall
Specialize in high cholesterol
Customize guns I want them all
Must pick ten I'm limited then
What the fuck should I invest in?
Reflex Scope and it's time again
I am beast at least pretend
Rockit is back and I'm not your friend
I'm back in black for world domination
No need to say I'm sorry!
Pull back to the Line of Duty
I know I shouldn't go back
The future is always black
We're better off dead in
Black Ops 3!!!

We're back, we're here to paint it black
My mind it seems to never sleep
We're better off dead
In Black Ops 3

Forget the past my friends
Ain't going back again
Tactical mask in hand
We're back in black again!
You think it's gettin' bad
Ain't seen disaster yet
I'm gonna have to jet
Because I'm headin' back to black!
These holographic maps
Show every path I have
We handle matters in the shadows
When we're BACK IN BLACK!

No need to say I'm sorry!
Pull back to the Line of Duty
I know I shouldn't go back
The future is always black
We're better off dead in
Black Ops 3!!!

We're back, we're here to paint it black
My mind it seems to never sleep
We're better off dead
