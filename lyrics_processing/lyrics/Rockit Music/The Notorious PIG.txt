Yeah! Let's do this!
(Woo!)
Huh, it's been a while since I've been in the studio

The notorious
P-I-G
I want a piece of your
R-I-B
Slow cook while I slap that meat
The notorious
P-I-G
Hangry better move your feet
Pork hits harder than that beef

Hogtied
Pig in the night
I'm the muscle and I squat
Got pork thighs?
Salt and then I pepper
Pullin' all the levers
Turning up the temperature
Hit 'em with the meta
(Yeah) Barbecue
Brute force
Breakthrough
(Yeah)
Smokestacks so high
When I make food
I salivate when I cut you
Blood spews
Chopping up your ribs
I'm a piggy with a short fuse
I go ham
When I stick it to the man
Hot damn
I be killin' on command
Slamming your face
On the grill, what a look
Watch it sizzle up in smoke
Kick back with the kush
(Yeah)
Ravage through your stomach
For some meat I can cook
Hangrier than ever
And they feel so good
Digging through your bones
And it's finger-licking tasty
Packin' on the pounds
'Cause I do it on the daily

Slick grip
On your ribs
Need a pick
Packing up the bags
On the run
What a trip
Piggy with a killstreak
Read the fine print
On the front cover
With a belly so big
Dark Deception
No Protection
Grade A beef
Prime perfection
Stirrin' up a mean sauce
Callin' to the boss
LUCKY DINNER'S READY!
I'ma drop it like it's hot
So I got a few genetic differences
Snout so big
I'll be sniffing down the innocent
Hate to say it
But my crew and I is killin' it
Ready for the feast
Stomach's ready get the grillin' in
Slow down
Running out of breath
I'ma outta shape
When I'm chasing down death
I'm a proud motha fucka
With the
Joy Joy Gang
Together snappin' necks
Got killing on the brain!

Keep busy
Making mortal chili
Powder up a batch
Blood is stuck on my machete
Got smells on smells
Senses going off the rails
Dropping bitties off your body
Like I'm cooking up spells
Spices hit your lips
Mike Tyson
Step into my ring
Fine dining
Cook-off
Dry rub and I'm hot
When the rabbit says get 'em
I GO STRAIGHT
THROUGH THE WALL
New chapter
YOU is what I'm after
I'ma pork chop you
Turn you cadaver
Hangry got a thing
For them dope meats
Yeah it's butter in your mouth
Like Kobe
So cold
To the centre of my core
Temperamental pork chop
ALWAYS WANT MORE
I'm a pig
I can always eat again
Bring them ribs
By the hair of my chinny chin chin
