Diiiiiiiiiiie

Money don't make a man, money don't make a man
But a man can make money

Taadow

Yeah
Heyyyy
Once again, that nigga A-N, T
For the 9-fiddy
Heyy

Money don't make a man, money don't make a man
But a man can make money

Now money'll what, change a man after changing hands
And he moves from the ghetto lands up to the meadow lands
Now, peep a nigga when he come up, 'cause every time he run up
He'll have a different hoe with a hair done up
He'll hang with troops, keeps a gang aloof
Never seen without a .25 inside his boots
And he'll shoot too, he has to blast, the ghetto bastard
That's not for his cast, but really headed for disaster, maybe
It's the way that nigga trip and shit
'Cause when you hang with him, that nigga be runnin' his lip and shit
And it's bound to get him caught up, eventually
If he don't stop doin' that O.B.G. shit, become an O.G
He's a nigga with a master plan, that's what he thought
'Til the partner he was hangin' with started speakin' soft
He never shoulda let that shit go straight to his head
But now he chargin' it to the game, explain that to the feds, now

This bitch used to... fuck my nigga until my nigga went broke
's why she'd love him only if he was payin' car notes
Getting grips, giving tips, taking trips, even cruises
Bahamas weekends, whatever the bitch chooses
Fucked me up to see my partner getting played
But what the fuck can I tell a nigga that's getting paid?
Days, weeks, months go by
And the center of his happiness had just went dry
Down to his last cent, time to pay the rent
And I can tell your ass just where his cash went
Out being spend by the number one hooker
The bottoms up gold digger, the good-looker
I used to fuck the bitch, but now she doing him
And the hoe want my dick back, picture that, with Coogi, fam
Now you wanna hug me, don't even try that
Oh now you love me? Biatch, can you buy that?
Money don't make a man, money don't make a man

Now, put yourself in about position, this be dissin? Listen
What I mean is I'm out, to envision what has yet to be seen
What's been done has already been forgotten
Apple's bitten, no bullshit, and the whole world's rotten
White... own and popping off in my neighborhood
I know what's love, so what up, 'cause the flavor's good
I never gave a fuck, but I paid to fuck
But don't trip, 'cause some old slip never save a buck
I go for the mind in anatomy
Wit yo shit, fuzz it, bitch, don't try to flatter me
I'm shootin' from the hip, and never even slip
Now as I'm in the midst of making grip, 'cause

Money don't make a man, money don't make a man
But a man can make money
It's all about money, ain't a damn thing funny
You gots to have a con in this land of milk and honey  (Yeah)
Money don't make a man, money don't make a man
But a man can make money
It's all about money, ain't a damn thing funny
