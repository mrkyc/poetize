What?
You said what?
The president did what?
Ah man, that's, hey, that's all good, baby
He got rid of the player haters, too?
Ah man, we need to declare this a national holiday
We gon' call this Players Holiday
Ant Beezy, what's up, mayne?

Rise and shine, make you wanna say
Dear God, let me thank you for another day
For livin' life on the edge and I'm tryin' to break it
Tired of duckin' the Feds, but it's a struggle to make it
So this is your day homey, now it's time to shine
If a player's only trickin', you can wine and dine
Stress free from the drama, better go get your ticket
Then come on cause some squares can't lie to kick it

It feels good not to grind no more
Don't get it twisted cause I still hustle
Maintainin' just tryin' to reach my goal
Livin' life truly successful
So that my little soldier never have to sell no dope
All the cuddies from the pens comin' home again
And we ain't tryin' to kill each other 'cause brother we all kin
Beautiful Black women give 'em much respect
And ain't no funk 'tween the East and the West
It's just a Player Holiday
You might also like
Today's the day the players play
So you better be on your way
(On your way, your way)
Now it's time to celebrate
Hurry up and don't be late
'Cause you know it's gonna be
Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day
Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day
(A lovely day)
Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day
Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day

January 1 the year 2000
We gettin' all the money and we ain't through clownin'
You can tell everybody that stays around your way
Today is the official Player's Holiday
$hort Dog I'm lovin' every minute of it
'Cause pimpin's been around since the beginning of it
We barbecuin' chicken, that's what we doin'
Got some breezys and we kickin'
And Cap, what you doin'?

I'm just sittin here timin' like a Rolex watch
I figured by now y'all realize that Hip-Hop and Rap won't stop
Puttin' it together like a racing track (Like a racing track)
Where's all my Latino, Filipino, and Ese partners at?
I know you feel me when I say that life's a struggle
But God first, y'all know we all can't help but bubble
So keep your head up
And know that things are changing for the better
Talkin' 'bout the youth, the little kids
Forget about you, never
Today's the day the players play
So you better be on your way
(On your way, your way)
Now it's time to celebrate
Hurry up and don't be late
'Cause you know it's gonna be
Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day
Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day
(A lovely day)
Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day
Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day

Now all the real players throw your Rollies in The air
And wave 'em all around like you just don't care
From side to side and from front to back
Throw the peace sign baby, show me where you at
Dollar bill y'all, and we could scream it out loud
And Mac Mall's here, homie that can move the crowd
So what the deal with you, nigga, you could cross the town
Put the squeeze on the haters, ain't no need to clown

None of the homies got pop
None of the spots got batteram
And I'll be damned, it's crackin' like a Summer Jam
Barbecues, no more feuds, players embracin'
Slammin' dominoes, bustin' raps, still paper chasin'
Competitors keep a distance, it's all love baby
Rub-a-dub-dub love, welcome to the Players Club, baby
A family affair, a toast to the Bay, hey
Looks like it's gonna be one of them lovely days
Today's the day the players play
So you better be on your way
(On your way, your way)
Now it's time to celebrate
Hurry up and don't be late
Cause you know it's gonna be
Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day
Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day
(A lovely day)
Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day
Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day

Mama used to put my clothes on layaway
Now I'm dipped every day and every C-note got big face
Holler at me, mayne, used to ride the back of the bus
Now I'm spinnin' V-12's though the times is rough
In God we trust, haters, you can only hate us
But can't front 'cause you knew that we was bound to blow up
Gettin' paid what we can, $hort Dog and Ant Banks
