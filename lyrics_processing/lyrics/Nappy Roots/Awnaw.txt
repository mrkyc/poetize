Yeah, haha Nappy Roots
Awnaw!

Awnaw! Hell naw! Boy
Y'all done up and done it
Awnaw! Hell naw! Boy
Y'all done up and done it
Awnaw! Hell naw! Boy
Y'all done up and done it
Ah, y'all done up and done it
Man, y'all done up and done it

My first song was like forty-eight bars with no hook
You hear me flippin' through my pages out my favorite notebook
The microphone was in the closet (What?)
No headphones, we lost it
Niggas scared to get some water, roaches hangin' over the faucets
No AC, Tez'll break a sweat just tryin' to make beats
E-Dubz was being a hustler (Hey man!)
Flirtin' with all his customers, and flat broke
Nappy smokin' blacks out on the back po'ch
I'm thinkin' I got everything a country boy could ask for
You might also like
Now what we do to get here? (Say dat boy!)
Lay it down and bring it to ya raw (Say dat boy!)
Hey now we hurt some, suffered for more, takes what we work for
Hated for the cussin', but the hatred it made us cuss more
Held on, but it was hard, stepped up, took charge
Ran through what we scared of, but what was we afraid for?
Look at what we made of, hard times done made us
Being here is alright, but must believe we want more!

Them country boys on the rise!
With them big fat wheels on the side!
Peep them vertical grills on the ride!
And aw-aw-aw-aw
Them country boys
With them big fat wheels
Peep the vertical grills
And awwwwwwww!

My yegga, we hog wild, bet that from that roota to that toota-file
Hell naw, them country boys ain't headed south for six miles
Kentucky mud, them kinfolk, twankies with them hundred-spokes
Skullied on that front po'ch, plus you know they got 'dro
Seventy-nine coupe DeVille, vertical Caddy grill
Interstate 65, headin' down to Cashville
Glass-filled, to the tippy-top, back-seat Benz
Spent my last cent on the rent, left with pocket lints
A damn shame, gotta grind anything and everything
Jimmy Crack Corn, cross the county line with Mary Jane
A long time, a gravel road, to cash and fame and sold my soul
To Hell and back, and back and forth
With same jeans and nappy 'fro
I might hop off the Harley, smoke pot like Bob Marley
Block parties with shawties, wallin' like they swallowin' Bacardi
Them butter-skin, Prophet gutter like kin
Understand you 'bout to lose ya life fuckin' with them!

Them country boys on the rise!
With them big fat wheels on the side!
Peep them vertical grills on the ride!
And aw-aw-aw-aw
Them country boys
With them big fat wheels
Peep the vertical grills
And awwwwwwww!

Them country boys
With them big fat wheels
Peep the vertical grills
And aww!
Them country boys
With them big fat wheels
Peep the vertical grills
And aww!
Them country boys on the rise!
With them big fat wheels on the side!
Peep them vertical grills on the ride!
And aw-aw-aw-aw
Them country boys
With them big fat wheels
Peep the vertical grills
