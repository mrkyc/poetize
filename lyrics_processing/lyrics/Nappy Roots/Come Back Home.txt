You know what I'm talkin' about?

Life's good but it definitely ain't easy
Remember we was kids, just nappy headed, greasy
Everything was simple, just like we saw on TV
My how time flies, quick, fast, in 3D
Yesterday was fun and tomorrows never promised
Today is the moment that we seize and we squeeze
See, life is full of choices and opportunities they
Sometimes hard to come by, they knock once and they leave;
Like leaves in the fall is when I miss the summer breeze
When the seasons start to change what remain are the trees
We are the same like the birds and the bees
Even educated fiends find it strange to believe
Never mind the truth; it can be it as it seems
The answers that we seek are deeply rooted in our dreams
Why things happen usually end in diamond rings
And what often makes us happy leaves one envious in greed, C'mon

We can make it on our own
But we ain't got to be alone
Just in case when things go wrong
You can always come back home
Where you'll always be a star
Doesn't matter who you are
Even when you go too far
You can always come back home
You might also like
Ya'll know how it feel when you come from outta town
That familiar smell when the window come down
Catch up with Sports Center, let me sit down
Walk to the corner, and see what went down
Never thought I'd be back on my Mama's couch
Love me to death but can't wait till I get out
John Wall, he got me thinking 'bout Lexington
Downtown at the game, those were the days
BG ain't the same, Craig sold the club
Ridin' through the country rolls, spittin' and flow
Blocked out Western can't deal like we used to deal
Campus PD got a show so they gon' trip
Wizard of Oz on 'em, clicking my heels
 it's that real
Years ago I shot my first video
But the way they actin' now, you just wouldn't know

We can make it on our own
But we ain't got to be alone
Just in case when things go wrong
You can always come back home
Where you'll always be a star
Doesn't matter who you are
Even when you go too far
You can always come back home
Aight take me back to south Carolina
Outside Clemson leavin' out of a diner
We were so drunk but the owners didn't mind us
Plus we gave posters, course we gon' sign 'em
Next stop Athens, man I love Athens
Wake up with a smile like "damn what just happened?" (wake up)
Hit Tennessee now passin' UT
I love Gatlinburg, it's good for gettin' sleep
Stop in Cookeville cause gas was so cheap
Met V's aunt, she cookin' something to eat
Can't wait to see the signs from BG
Stop by and see the whole crib on center street
Roll some  and keep movin'
Kentucky lakes look real good but we cruising
Call Mama up to see what's on the stove
She said no matter where I go, I can come back home

She told me, seasons change
I feel like goin back to where I came
Just to find out that nothing stays the same
These are the good ol' days
These are the good ol' days

We can make it on our own
But we ain't got to be alone
Just in case when things go wrong
You can always come back home
Where you'll always be a star
Doesn't matter who you are
Even when you go too far
You can always come back home
Come back home, come back home
Come back home, come back
Come back home, come back
Come back home, come on back when the world treats
You nasty, when friends turn their back
