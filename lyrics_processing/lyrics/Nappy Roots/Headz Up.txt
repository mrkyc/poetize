Shawty, where yo' head at?
Show me where yo' head at
Shawty, where yo' head at? (that's all I know)

Y'all ain't never heard of B. Stille, the look that seals
Screwed up coupe DeVille, peep the vertical grill
Well Killa Cowboy pull the dirty cowbell
Hell anyway ya do the certified playa
The thickest, the thicker, the better, the pick of the litter
The sicker the chicken, the bigger the dick I deliver
The kidney, the liver, the shiver, the give in her BACK
Make the bigger the nigga deliver the miggity-MACK!

Y'all so ridiculous, hoes all up in my businesses
Got 'em stuffin up my tennant biz
My friend is here, so come around actin shady
I warned ya like (Dick Tracy) like Warren Beatty
Prophit hit it, 2-3-4-5
Kicked it off, 6-7-8-9, from behind
10-11-12, I'm... a glad man slingin geni-til y'all

I'm bout to leave ya juice joint
Drunk as a mug, drunk out his mind
Too damn drunk to drive, jump out the ride
Lookin for a chicken to pluck, with plumped up thighs
Gotta be thicker than Granny's gravy on the side
So when I get it, I can cut her, big ol' chunky slice
And if I love it, I'mma lick it like it's pumpkin pie
Now you guys don't really want it 'less it's country fried
Now tell me whatcha really know about the country side

I been in the wild slums po'
Now won'chu tell me whattcha'll know about them country folk
With all the chicken wing and fish and the dirty spokes
My yeaga smoke, betta sell and twank, and blowin smoke
(That fool cool ain't a thang) Look how that Caddy roll
On them twenty-two like Muddy move the fuck and blow
We forever reppin 'Tucky and e'rythang below
Skinny D, slum, Nappy's how the stories roll
We got that bump fo' sho' (yea)

Suckin and fuckin and tusslin, for the evenin, please believe 'em

Who's that girl? Oh that girl

Cross between, Britney, Whitley, Whitney (crispy) Mya, Pink

Tell ya mammy I said that
Stop the askin me, and naggin me, and harrassin me
For it be a tragedy

Don't you know the damn thang
They come to do the damn thang
For they leave best believe they do the damn thang
Scales throws scragglers
Hooks 'em like hagglers
Don't talk much the game is spectacular
