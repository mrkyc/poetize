I can't see out the window
I am blinded by my worries and my problems
I can't see out the window
Mama told me it'd be alright
Said, "Boy, always do what you like."
I can't see out the window

Mama I made it past the hatred
School of hard knocks, yup, graduated
Summa Cum Laude, forty acres
Bought a new Audi R8, bitch (OIN)
No matter what my age is
Room full of killers, still I am the bravest
Finally famous, thank God for patience
We international now, like the house of pancakes (I'm so high)
Make 'em light and fluffy
Numbers don't lie, but you ain't got to trust me
If a nigga gon' whine just like a puppy
Over here it gets rough, but he likes his rugby
What's love without a chick to fuck me?
What's luck if you ain't from Kentucky?
Made it out the bucket, learned that from hustling
Crabs can't stop me, so fate it must be

They say life ain't fair, but it sure is worth it
Doing pretty good, hell, I ain't perfect
Had a crazy year, sure, I deserved it
Back once again, dropping gems like bird shit
(Haters gon' hate players)
That's their purpose
Look me in the eyes, I ain't worried
I ain't nervous, but I'm encouraged
To make a couple bucks, sign my checks in cursive
Never gave a fuck, unless it's 'bout these verses
Always gave a damn about my fam and friends
Hotbox in the ride
God damn the rims look better when they stop but it's not over
Jaded by lust, I'm a man of sin
A child of god, if times are hard
Play the cards in my hand, I was dealt to win
I didn't get it all at first but now I understand why


As I drive by the places I used to love
I realize life truly moves forward
A moment fades as soon as we are afraid to let go of it
A bright day turns dark as soon as we think we are in control of it
Riding blind
Driving crazy through Sandyville
Something blocking my windshield
Know the world still on the outside
But I'm seeing it from my perspective
Cancer got my uncle sick
My cousin hustling, he want to quit
I'm still working hard without benefits
Still on probation, I'm proud to step (I see it)
