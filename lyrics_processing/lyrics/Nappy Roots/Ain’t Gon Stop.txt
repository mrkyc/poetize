Tell us no, but we ain't gon' stop saying yeah
Gotta keep on marching this road 'till we make it to the top
And we ain't gon' stop, no, we ain't gon' stop, no
No, we ain't gon' stop, no
No, we ain't gon' stop, no, 'till we make it to the top
And we ain't gon' stop, no, we ain't gon' stop, no

Yesterday we made it through, but what about tomorrow?
Everything we thought was wrong, we locked it in a bottle
The world we from, too many coming in the pain and sorrow
Dollar, can I borrow? Yup, yup, that is the motto
Follow your heart and you can never get the wrong direction
Listen to yourself before you ask someone what they suggesting
If any question, raise your hand and make it known
No, no, no, you're not alone, come on and sing right along
You have to master what's internal first then shout it out
We gotta help each other up and build without a doubt
Then it's still a sense of pride inside this greedy house
Rise above this petty shit and I where I sit it's a hit
Look how far we came, maintain the faith and keep a grip
Trust in hell will never fail, what he like is strong, black males
To teach the youth, that's why we need to speak the truth
Nappy's only a part of it, but we can't forget the roots

Sweet from my mama dukes, pops he can come too
I ain't scared of hatred, for snakes I got a mongoose
 got my back,  got my back
Big brother Ronny was with me before my 
A-town's where I live, KY where I grew
Milledgeville where I'm born, to this day I put it on
Plan to show the world to my people who ain't never flown
Hit the hood, scoop some kids, take 'em where they never gone
Find out my partner's on parole, help him get along
Grab me a single mother, take her out and get her home
Roxanne Adams be the angel that I'm leaning on
Even when I'm weak she be the reason I be seeming strong
Elevate your mind up, straighten up your spine cause
Heaven's up above and you can't know when your time come
Sweet potato pie, whipped cream, man, I'm killing it
Man, it be the simple things in life that be the realest shit
Tell us no, but we ain't gon' stop saying yeah

Unstoppable forces, immovable objects
Circumstances forced us to move out the projects
It's a slow process, but there's no progress
Without struggle, Frederick Douglass
That's before the drugs hit
Banging 'Pac in my uncle's '87 Cutlass
Smotking out, thugging, screaming only God can judge us
If everybody does their parts like assembly lines
Would eat when it's dinner time, sprinting to the finish line
It feels better breaking bread with your brethren
Individually we hell, but together we heaven
Use the open door policy to exit whenever
That's the only way the family ties could ever be severed
It's Nappy forever in capital letters
Like birds with feather we flocking together
I ride for my fellas 'til closed shop
Taking odds off top, let's march on the hop
Can't stop 'til me make it to the top
Tell us no, but we ain't gon' stop saying yeah
Gotta keep on marching this road 'till we make it to the top
And we ain't gon' stop, no, we ain't gon' stop, no
No, we ain't gon' stop, no
No, we ain't gon' stop, no, 'till we make it to the top
