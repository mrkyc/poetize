I'm sick and tired of bein criticized
I'm sick and tired of barely gettin by
I'm sick and tired of not livin right
I'm sick and tired of bein sick and tired
I'm sick and tired of bein pushed aside
I'm sick and tired of callin folks for rides
I'm sick and tired of this petty life
I'm sick and tired of bein sick and tired

What is life? What is makin it? For peace is there a price?
They tell me if you rich you only got to worry about more shit
The house, and the car notes, child support and kin people
Kick those, "Mo' Money, Mo' Problems" that's how the shit goes

Man, I'm gettin tired of runnin and duckin (quit runnin then)
Specially when I ain't did nothin (do somethin then)
Out here in these cold streets hustlin
Po', tryin to make this dough, before the police bustin in

And then it's what it coulda been, shoulda been
Find yourself outside lookin in, givin up, feelin stuck
Mad at the world cause you down and they gettin up
Mad at yourself cause you know you shouldn't be givin up

I'm tired and sick, of bummin rides, on top of that my nine to five
Sucks for a couple bucks and change, now what's the reason why?
My luck, don't amount to fuck, no matter how hard I try
I'm stuck in a 22, now +catch+ me when I'm sick and tired


Prophet, check this out
I'm gettin tired of mama breakin her neck for the paycheck
They makin her sweat, seem like everyday she stressed

I've had up to here with pussy footers actin like we owe you somethin
Let's see you-know-who like I'm supposed to throw you somethin

I'm gettin tired of daddy puchin the clock, scarin his knuckles
He tired of the hustle, he feel the pain deep in his muscles

Seems like the media portray us against bein rich
Like we shouldn't enjoy shrimp and occasional trips

While my baby brother scrappin with his baby mother
Deep down I know he love her but he shoulda worn a rubber
I'm sick and tired of players down to do us bodily harm
Like them Country Boys ain't at the range firing arms

And my little sister think she grown, wanna make it on her own
I ain't bring you in this world, but you still my baby girl

I'm fed up when I feel like this
My yeagas keep your heads up, we pray and kneel for this


Keep it real, remember God, don't change, sign this
Don't forget where you come from, you got some money gimme some
You different, fuck you, man I got your first tape
You always gon' be Vito to me, so get out my face

(I know what you mean dog)
Tired of people who complain, always 'bout the same thing
First you learn to maintain, after that create change
See we gettin up and gettin out
Playa what you jokin and you kiddin 'bout?
Change is what we gettin out
What they say? I ain't livin well
All day and night, I struggle hustle just to pay the dues
Now I gotta keep the lights on and ain't got no time for lay and snooze
Damn man, who made these rules? Wasn't thinking 'bout no William Hughes
I'm sick and tired but I can't stop, no matter if they say I lose

Yup, we still smoke weed, and my wife is curious
'bout how much she can get me on for life insurance
But still was bummin, no problem, that's when life was purist
"Mo' Money, Mo' Problems" - that's right Notorious
