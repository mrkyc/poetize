And I'mma stand on my own
And throw "L's" for my Ol' Kentucky Home
Yeah it's grimy down here but it's all hood
We keep a big block engine under our hood
Now if I make money then the city make money
It's all good they get nothing but love from me
Cus I was born here (born here!) raised here (Raised here!)
When I leave here, bury my grave here
Until then I'mma ride and drink liquor, blow Swishers
Sit back collect my thoughts by the river
I'm a bluegrass CEO cat
Trying to get my young homies out the projects
Show them a way they can turn they money legal
When the feds start to sweep I bob and weave on them people
Stay ahead of the game, quick to change it up on 'em
Set a level for the game quick to raise it up on 'em
Bluegrass, KD
Chorus
It's okay, hop in with your boys to the river and we taking the back way
We don't mind who you are just ride to the rhythm have a sip in the sunshine
Come on down where the bluegrass rolls, and the country cold wind blows
Where the city lights still glow
To My Ol' Kentucky Home, My Ol' Kentucky Home

Old school shotgun fishin pole and liquor dawg
I ain't tryin to catch no kinda bass or catfish
I'd rather sling rocks on the ave with a bad chick
Scales this track is hot lets make it a smash hit
They hating on my mess and ya see I get mad chips
In kentucky smash whips
And kentucky blast crips
In kentucky it ain't lucky to get found in a casket
Ya im city living chillin but im country at heart
Old school no shoes when we roll threw the park
Old dudes no rules when we roll threw the park
Goodfella hood dwella reppin' Victory Park
And that chicken's finger lickin and the digits got me finger lickin'
Countin' scrilla from the chickens that I be pitchin' out the kitchen
Trying to make a 100 million out this business
Goodfella, KD, Villebillies, Nappy Roots chillin
Chorus
They say welcome to the 502
Taking Georgia boys show em how Kentucky do
Old caprice classics paint Kentucky blue
They say don't forget 270 we hittin' too
Some call it blue grass some call it purple
I'mma call it home, take a shot of p'trone
Lay back in the 'Lac and take two to the dome
Riding from Da Ville to B.G. in my zone
Let me here you say
High times sittin' by the river
Got my old shotgun fishin' pole and my liquor
Cus people always trying to tell me how to run my life
When they say I'm doing wrong and I swear I'm doing right
High times sittin' by the river
Got my old shotgun fishin' pole and my liquor
I say it's time to take our children where the grass is blue
And peep how the mid south do
