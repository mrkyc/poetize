Imma be okay
Long as I got you
I got a brighter day
Imma be alright
Imma be okay
Long as I got you
We gon' find a way...aye, aye, ayyyeee!

I'm filled with mirth and I'm smilin'
Find me in a church on Mount Zion
I used to think I was cursed like "The Shinin'"
A lot of folks is worse off than I am
I'm truly blessed no denyin'
They say do your best, and I'm tryin'
But sometimes your best just ain't good enough
You get yourself in a mess, but things lookin' up
So before they break us
We're gonna make it like 40 acres
People do anything for this paper
Get a shape up with a sporty taper
Just so you can look fresher than your next door neighbor
Make yourself seem major and impress some stranger
Found Christ and now I got a new lease on life
You can hate all ya want...IMMA BE ALRIGHT

Me and you step out
The whole hood with us baby
Ain't nobody left out
Ain't nobody murder
Cuz they know we here to help out
Ballin' in the spots where our grandparents ??????
Man it's a new day, listen to the kids
Let 'em know it's them we care 'bout
When I hit the dance floor, tell 'em take the snare out
Turn the bass up and start a soul train line
It's a Nappy Roots record, let the whole thing ride
Still can't believe how the soul train died
We gon' bring it back like it's "Coltrane Live"
It's all in a moment's notice, ain't lyin'
My granny got tears in her eyes, but she ain't cryin'
It must be the joy that she feel when I rhyme
At least I'm on TV for somethin' other than crime
If haters gon' hate me for that then ?????
Cuz God say I'm cool with him, I'm busy tryin'
Chorus

Yo, and we gon' make it through these hard times
Life has a way of gettin' good when you keep tryin'
Never givin' up with you think you fallin' behind
Always on your way up sometimes you have to remind
Ourself to keep it movin' fast forward, never rewind
Do what ya gotta in the process, try to be kind
Try to keep it positive and things will start to rebound
And sooner than you know it opportunity will peek out
Get yourself together, keep it cool and never freak out
Take it one day then the next and haters keep out
Your business cuz they'll try to stop your motivation, bring down
Your spirits and your chances for success at the same time
But not for long, after rain there comes the sunshine
Take it as a blessin', it can only happen one time
In ya life, and if it never happens twice take advantage of the day
Cuz in the end...
