Boy say to me, he say, "Ay Yuk! What's yo favorite city?"
And I say "West Virginia.  That's my home town."
Chorus:
Take me back to West V-A
Take me back to Charleston
It's them doggone busy city streets
That I'm ridin' to get far from
Ridin' to a small town
Ridin' to a small town
Take me back to Massachusetts
Take me back to Cape Cod
It's them doggone big ol' city buildings
I'm ridin' to escape from
Ridin' to a small town
Ridin' to a small town
(B. Stille)
Yo, uh, ridin' past beautiful cow fields
Top down see how the air feels
I see trees that was here before me
Seem like each one's telling a story
I just wanna go hit the local bar
Where the owner's fat and smoke cigars
Where country girls attracted me
Like everybody works in a factory
Where they ship they goods to bigger places
A city lights just could never replace this
Where high school sports is what we live for
Hit the lotto and next week you still poor
In a small town

(Ron Clutch)
They say the whole damn world is country
Small town livin', not a porch monkey
Dirt road and gravel, anywhere you travel
Mechanic is the sheriff is the judge with the gavel
Everybody cousin, cuz everybody kin
Piggly Wiggly one school everybody friends
From high school football to family reunions
Movin' at the speed of life drunk by noon and
That's my uncle, I know everybody got one
Freaky-ass white girl, daddy got a shotgun
Fly through the town, ya blink ya might miss it
City slicker in the country wish you come visit
Come on down, come on down
Come on down, come on down
Lil' Yuk, what you think about that right there?
(Lil' Yuk)
Like, man, uh, I like North Carolina.  I like Kentucky, Tennessee, like...
I don't wanna, I wanna see something important and take a right and right there at it
I don't like all that traffic.  I like to get where I'm going
I like people with things on they man like, "Let's have a good time, let's sit on the porch."
That's what I was telling my homeboy Plump down in Duluth.  You know, in Georgia
We was gonna kick it and do it way big.  He always show us around at the office
And like why you go to the office?
I'm like "Man it's some real people comin' from a small town."
And that's where I'm from.  And that's where I do rappin'
That's Nappy Roots.  That's Fish Scales, and that's Clutch
An that's B. Stille and that's Skinny Deville, that's V
That's, that's history, man
You know when you from the country everything's cool, you know
Give us a front porch, give us a thing of Patron and give us
You know a few Corona, a Red Stripe.  You know, things like that
Budweiser if ya money's low.  But we gonna have a good time, man
We comin from a small town.  Bowling Green, Kentucky
Milledgeville, Georgia.  You know thangs like that
I like Keepwater(??) Mississippi, you know, Florida
All them places like that, small town
Still love for LA and Chicago, but when I wanna kick I wanna be in a small town
