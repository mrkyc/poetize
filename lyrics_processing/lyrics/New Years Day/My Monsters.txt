Afraid of the way I'm feeling when I say
That I should know better than to break down
I don't even know myself
All I see is someone else

And I won't let it pull me down, I've had enough
It won't stop feeding 'til my body self-destructs
I won't let it pull me down I've had enough
I've had enough

I created a monster inside of my head
And it's eating me alive
I created the demons, I once believed in
To get me through the night
Facing every fear 'til my blood's cold
Bigger than the ghosts that haunt my hopes
I'm not scared any longer
I'm stronger than my monsters

The sound of trouble as it follows me down
Trembling beneath my feet
It shakes me, trapped in my own private hell
Trying to escape myself
(Trying to escape myself)

I created a monster inside of my head
And it's eating me alive
I created the demons, I once believed in
To get me through the night
Facing every fear 'til my blood's cold
Bigger than the ghosts that haunt my hopes
I'm not scared any longer
I'm stronger than my monsters

No silence can keep me
As long as I keep breathing
I know I'll make it one more night

I created a monster inside of my head
It's eating me alive
I created the demons, I once believed in
To get me through the night
Facing every fear 'til my blood's cold
Bigger than the ghosts that haunt my hopes
I'm not scared any longer
I'm stronger than my monsters
I'm not scared any longer
I'm stronger than my monsters
I'm not scared any longer
