There is no escape
No one to keep you safe
I'm taking aim now, are you bulletproof?
You can't hide your hate
You keep tempting fate
I'll cause you damage that you can't undo

Come for me
There's no escape

C-c-c-come, c-c-come for me
Say it to my face when you talk about me
C-c-c-come, c-c-come for me
I'll have you screaming when you
C-c-c-come, c-c-come for me
Say it to my face when you talk about me
C-c-c-come, c-c-come for me
I'm waiting for you

Careful what you say
There's no turning away
I'll be the worst mistake you ever make
Fall down before me
I want you on your knees
I won't stop until you're begging please

You think you know me
You haven't seen my type of crazy
Don't think I'll put up a fight?
