I'm stronger than you know
I won't shatter
I won't shatter

I know you like a fight
I know you like to lie
I'm not gonna take it one more night
Back me against the wall
Toss me like a ragdoll
You can't break me
'Cause I've been feeling trapped for way too long
Feeling like I can't untie
What's been keeping me down and on my knees
But you don't know me
(You don't know me)

I am stronger than you know
'Cause unbreakable pieces don't shatter (Don't shatter)
I won't shatter
You can't shatter me now
I'm taking back my life
And putting myself back together (Together)
I won't shatter
You can't shatter me now
I'm unbreakable

I stepped on broken glass
Walking through the past
Feeling every cut that crippled me
Been through it all before
Won't go back anymore
I've gone too far
And I've been waiting here for way too long
Feeling tears that just won't dry
I opened up my eyes
Once when I was blind
Now I'm holding onto night
(Holding onto night)

I am stronger than you know
'Cause unbreakable pieces don't shatter (Don't shatter)
I won't shatter
You can't shatter me now
I'm taking back my life
And putting myself back together (Together)
I won't shatter
You can't shatter me now
I'm unbreakable

I am stronger than you know
I won't shatter
(I'm taking back my life)
I won't shatter
I am stronger than you know
'Cause unbreakable pieces don't shatter (Don't shatter)
I won't shatter
You can't shatter me now
I'm taking back my life
And putting myself back together (Together)
I won't shatter
You can't shatter me now

You can't shatter me now
Unbreakable
You can't shatter me now
I'm taking back my life
And putting myself back together (Together)
I won't shatter
You can't shatter me now
