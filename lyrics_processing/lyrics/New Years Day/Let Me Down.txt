I'm sick of the way that you pushed me away
When the times got tough, you jumped ship
A disease you couldn't come to grips with
A daughter with dreams bigger than this

You tried to bury me just like the past
But it won't stay dead for long
I wanna hear you finally admit you're wrong
But if I give you the chance...

You'll let me down, you'll let me down
Your guilt won't save you now from six feet underground
You'll let me down, you'll let me down
Maybe it's for the best you don't come around

I'm sick of the way that I begged you to stay
All I wanted was a little closure
All I got was the coldest shoulder
So tell me, how do you sleep at night?
It must have been so hard to bend your back
When you've got no spine
For years I blamed myself
When all along you could have made this right

You tried to bury me just like the past
But it won't stay dead for long
I wanna hear you finally admit you're wrong
But if I give you the chance...

You'll let me down, you'll let me down
Your guilt won't save you now from six feet underground
You'll let me down, you'll let me down
Maybe it's for the best you don't come around

You had your chance to be a man
Don't close your eyes and pretend I don't exist
Now it's my turn to walk out on you
(It's your fucking loss)

You'll let me down, you'll let me down
Your guilt won't save you now, six feet underground
You'll let me down, you'll let me down
You'll let me down, you'll let me down
Your guilt won't save you now from six feet underground
You'll let me down, you'll let me down
Maybe it's for the best you don't come around
Now it's my turn to walk out on you
Finally, now it's my turn
Now it's my turn to walk out on you
