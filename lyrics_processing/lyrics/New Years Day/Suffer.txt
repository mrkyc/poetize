To adore is to grieve
To worship is to bleed
Find your way inside my heart
And bring all your pain to me
There's Hell in your eyes
So let demons dance with mine
We'll kill each other some day
But now is not the time

Sacrifice is that all that's left so
You'll give it till it hurts

I'd suffer for you, would you suffer for me?
Feel our affliction set us free
The kind of hurt that we both need
I'd suffer for you, would you suffer for me?
How deep, how far will you go?
Tell me, 'cause I wanna know
I'd give you my life all the air that I breathe
I'd suffer for you, would you suffer for me?

It's not real unless it hurts
'Cause true love is a curse
Let's compare each other's scars
To see who really had it worse
I'll inflict myself from upon you
'Cause the pain means you're alive
We'll scratch our way through the dark
'Cause to struggle's to survive

Sacrifice is all that's left
So you'll give it till it hurts

I'd suffer for you, would you suffer for me?
Feel our affliction set us free
The kind of hurt that we both need
I'd suffer for you, would you suffer for me?
How deep, how far will you go?
Tell me, 'cause I wanna know
I'd give you my life all the air that I breathe
I'd suffer for you, would you suffer for me?

Would you hurt for me?
Would you bleed for me?
Would you die for me?

Suffer, suffer, suffer, suffer

I'd suffer for you, would you suffer for me?
'Til our affliction set us free
The kind of hurt that we both need
I'd suffer for you, would you suffer for me?
How deep, how far will you go?
Tell me cause I wanna know
I'd give you my life and the air that I breathe
I'd suffer for you, would you suffer for me?
