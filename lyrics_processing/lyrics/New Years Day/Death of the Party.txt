I see your soul decaying
Your light is slowly fading out
Your eyes are filled with fire
Your nails show dirt from digging down

There's nothing left in you
I know, I know it feels like dying
Like you're fighting just to breathe

We are the death of the party
We're here to save you
Blow out the candles
Come with the vandals
Baby, make 'em scream

Your world is like a nightmare
Your life has trapped you like a prison
Let's see you, break those chains
You cover up your scars
Ashamed of all that you've been given
You're one of us now, let's get a little strange

There's nothing left in you
I know, I know it feels like dying
Like you're fighting just to breathe
That's when we show them

We are the death of the party
We're here to save you
Blow out the candles
Come with the vandals
Baby, make 'em scream
We are the death of the party
We're here to save you
Blow out the candles
Come with the vandals
Baby, make 'em scream

To all the living dead boys and living dead girls
Let outcasts be outcasts, all you creep controllers
The kids of the night, the ones with no voice
It's time to fucking scream out

We are the death of the party
We're here to save you
Blow out the candles
Come with the vandals
Baby, make 'em scream
We are the death of the party
We're here to save you
Blow out the candles
Come with the vandals
Baby, make 'em scream
We are the death of the party
We're here to save you
Blow out the candles
Come with the vandals
Baby, make 'em scream

There's nothing left in you
I know, I know it feels like dying
Like your living just to breathe
