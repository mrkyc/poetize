I'm not afraid to crawl through thick and thin
If only you noticed
If only you could see
The struggle, the silence
I'm not afraid to bleed
Just let the past go, it's ancient history

If you keep shutting me out, it's gonna haunt you
And when you choke on your words...

Don't you go and make a scene
I am the one you need
I am the blood that boils when you feel me through your veins
Don't you go and make a scene
Nothing is what it seems
Are we gonna let this go to waste and let it all decay?
Don't you go and make a scene!

With you or without you misfortune finds its way
You're with me or against me, I refuse to wait
I wound up giving everything and now I want nothing to do with you
Now you're choking on your words

Don't you go and make a scene
I am the one you need
I am the blood that boils when you feel me through your veins
Don't you go and make a scene
Nothing is what it seems
Are we gonna let this go to waste and let it all decay?
Don't you go and make a scene!

Go ahead, blame me
You can't defame me
Get it all out of your system
Go ahead and hate me, I don't care!

If you keep shutting me out, it's gonna haunt you
And when you choke on your words...

Don't you go and make a scene
I am the one you need
I am the blood that boils when you feel me through your veins
Don't you go and make a scene
Nothing is what it seems
Are we gonna let this go to waste and let it all decay?
