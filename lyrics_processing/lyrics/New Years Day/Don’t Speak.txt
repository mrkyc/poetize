You and me
We used to be together
Everyday together
Always
I really feel
That I'm losing my best friend
I can't believe, this could be
The end

It looks as though you're letting go
And if it's real, well I don't want to know

Don't speak
I know just what you're sayin'
So please stop explainin'
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts
Don't speak
I know what you're thinkin'
I don't need your reasons
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts

Our memories
They can be inviting
But some are altogether mighty
Frightening

As we die, both you and I
With my head in my hands I sit and cry

Don't speak
I know just what you're sayin'
So please stop explainin'
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts
Don't speak
I know what you're thinkin'
I don't need your reasons
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts

It's all ending
We gotta stop pretending
Who we are


You and me
I can see us dying
Are we?
Don't speak
I know just what you're sayin'
So please stop explainin'
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts
Don't speak
I know what you're thinkin'
I don't need your reasons
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts

Don't tell me cause it hurts
I know what you're sayin'
So please stop explainin'
Don't speak, don't speak, don't speak ohh
I know what you're thinkin'
And I don't need your reasons
I know you're good, I know you're good
I know you're real good, oh
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la

Don't, don't
Hush, hush, darling
