Take what you want from me
I'll give you anything
Just don't leave me on my own
Desperate and destitute
A shadow of the former self I knew
My dear
Take what you want from me
I'll give you anything
Just don't leave me on my own
Desperate and destitute
A shadow of the former self I knew
Take what you want from me
I'll give you anything
It's so pathetic, I make myself sick
I can't get over you, I can't get over any of this
My dear
Is this really happening?
Do these tears mean anything?
How can you leave me on my own?
Desperate and destitute
These seconds feel like lifetimes without you
