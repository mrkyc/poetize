This is for the ones who hurt us
This is for the hypocrites
This for the shit we've taken
Get out our fucking way

We spit venom on your doors
We'll give 'em hell, lets make them listen
Torture and absorb
It's the kind of pain you've been missing

I'm the dealer
For your darkest secrets
Selling nightmares
To the ones in need

Hey! There's no way around it
Don't speak, don't make a sound
Hey! Now you're surrounded
It's our voices getting loud
Hey! There's no way around it
So don't try and drown us out
Hey! Now you're surrounded
It's our voices getting loud

This is for the ones who hurt us
This is for the hypocrites
This is for the shit we've taken
Get out our fucking way
I'm the dealer

To the ones in need

Hey! There's no way around it
Don't speak, don't make a sound
Hey! Now you're surrounded
It's our voices getting loud
Hey! There's no way around it
So don't try and drown us out
Hey! Now you're surrounded
It's our voices getting loud
Fighting for our lives
Won't be deceived
We won't go unseen
With our hearts so heavy
Tell me that you're ready

We're ready now
We're ready now
We're ready now!
Hey! There's no way around it
