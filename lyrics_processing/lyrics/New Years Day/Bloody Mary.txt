Mary, Mary
Bound and buried, shut your weary eyes
Bloody Mary, Bloody Mary
For what you've done, you've been buried alive

She screamed her voice away so she stole mine
Spoke my words but they didn't taste right
It's imitation but I'm not flattered
And she'll never matter in anyone's eyes
Bloody Mary, bloody Mary

It's not right standing in my spotlight
You can just lay in my shadow if it burns too bright
Don't trip following my footsteps
Or you'll be up to your neck in regrets, regrets, regrets

You're just a patched up doll coming loose at the seams
You're just a stitched up puppet chasing someone else's dreams
A sad combination of every single idol you've ever wanted to be but you can't touch me
Have fun sleeping your way to mediocrity cause that's as high as you'll ever climb
I'll see you in hell

It's not right standing in my spotlight
You can just lay in my shadow if it burns too bright
Don't trip following my footsteps
Or you'll be up to your neck in regrets, regrets
It's not right standing in my spotlight
You can just lay in my shadow if it burns too bright
Don't trip following my footsteps
Or you'll be up to your neck in regrets, regrets
