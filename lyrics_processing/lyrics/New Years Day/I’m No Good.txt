I've got a smile like cyanide
My insides are cold and bitter
I'm no good at regret, proud to be such a mess
I wear it on me like a scarlet letter
You feel like the perfect crime
Now my pain will be your problem
I told you that I'm no good, you think I'm misunderstood
Now heaven isn't ready, let's raise hell
Heaven isn't ready, let's raise hell

Danger
You'll never make it out alive
You know I'm so dramatic
And it's quite the habit
You know I won't let go
Danger (danger)
You know you'll never stand a chance
I tried to warn you
Like the ones before you
You know I won't let go

I've been burned here once or twice
Revenge always makes it better
I'm bored and you're just a fix
A heart to throw in the ditch
With all the other hearts that I've stolen before

With a mind so sick and twisted
Depraved sadistic torture
It's like you'll never even see this coming
Heaven isn't ready, let's raise hell (let's raise hell)

You'll never make it out alive

You know you'll never stand a chance
I tried to warn you
Like the ones before you
You know I won't let go

You know I won't let go
I will creep behind you while you sleep
And before the blood drips off the sheets
I'll wake you up so I can hear you scream
I wanna hear you scream
Don't say I didn't warn you

You'll never make it out alive

You know I can't let go
