I can't be the blame
For the reasons you're in pain
If you push or pull away
But in the moment when it's over
Don't hold on here's closure

I'll turn to something you won't like
Heartless tonight, you'll hate me in time
I'm warning you now - this is it

I try to stop you, you can't resist
I try to tell you but you insist
You bring out the Devil inside of me
And I can't help that I make you weak
Just because I can
Doesn't mean that I will
But I'm about to break you

I'm not the one you built up
I'm not the dreams in your head
I will take what I want
And leave you tortured instead
Caught inside another trapped I've set
I look distressed
But I'm pretending to care

I'll turn to something you won't like
Heartless tonight, you'll hate me in time
I'm warning you now - this is it

I try to stop you, you can't resist
I try to tell you, but you insist
You bring out the Devil inside of me
And I can't help that I make you weak
Just because I can
Doesn't mean that I will
But I'm about to break you

Hasn't always been this way
Been the prey but I escaped
Cross my heart and lick my scars
Play with me, get ripped apart

I try to stop you, you can't resist
I try to tell you, but you insist
You bring out the Devil inside of me
And I can't help that I make you weak
Just because I can doesn't mean that I will
I try to stop you, you can't resist
I try to tell you, but you insist
You bring out the Devil inside of me
And I can't help that I make you weak
Just because I can doesn't mean that I will
But I'm about to break you

(I'll turn to something you won't like)
