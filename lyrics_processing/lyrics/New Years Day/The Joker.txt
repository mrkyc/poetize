The heart wants what the heart wants
When I'm standing on the edge, it's time to make a choice
The most repulsive one of all is if I fall, it's all my fault
The heart wants what the heart wants
I know it isn't you

Will you take this
As a hint? I won't take shit from anyone
You pushed too hard, took this too far
Nothing's ever fair in love and war

Wipe that grin off your face

You'll always be a joker to me
Same old story, same routine
Now that I've seen the tricks up your sleeve
I'm not one for make believe
You use your illusions to hide what's inside
Save it for someone who doesn't learn
You'll always be a joker to me
But I'm not laughing anymore

Well, I can't say
It's been a pleasure, it's a pain and quite a mess
I'm no damsel in distress, a weight off my chest
I can breathe without your hands around my neck

You're mistaken if you ever think you'll make
Another fool out of me, how pathetic can you be?
Smile at the crowd, take one last bow
The show's over, no one's laughing now

You'll always be a joker to me
Same old story, same routine
Now that I've seen the tricks up your sleeve
I'm not one for make believe
You use your illusions to hide what's inside
Save it for someone who doesn't learn
You'll always be a joker to me
But I'm not laughing anymore

I've got a couple tricks of my own
A few I still haven't shown
When I get you alone
Now you see it, now you don't!
You've backed me in the corner for the last time, I'm taking control (Control)
Standing at the edge with your life in my hands and I let you fall
You'll always be a joker to me
Same old story, same routine
Now that I've seen the tricks up your sleeve
I'm not one for make believe
You use your illusions to hide what's inside
Save it for someone who doesn't learn
You'll always be a joker to me
But I'm not laughing anymore
