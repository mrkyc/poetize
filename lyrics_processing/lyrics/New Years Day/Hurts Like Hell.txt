I've got a fucked up complex
I want what makes me damaged

Deeper I fall in this cycle
I just can't deny

I must be outta my mind
Cause when you dig in the knife
I kinda like it
Like it when it hurts like hell
You cut me right to the bone
I'm feeling out of control
You know I like it
Like it when it hurts like hell
If I could break the habit
Then I could kill the addict inside
But I still like it
Like it when it hurts like hell

How did you get so toxic (Whoa whoa)
Am I a sick psychotic? (Whoa whoa)

But I still like it
Like it when it hurts like hell

Something's gotta give
Wish I could hate you
Wish I could hate you
I can't keep going on like this
Wish I could hate you
Break you, quit you
Wish I could hate you
I must be outta my mind
Cause when you dig in the knife
I kinda I like it
Like it when it hurts like hell
You cut me right to the bone
I'm feeling out of control
You know I like it
Like it when it hurts like hell
If I could break the habit
Then I could kill the addict inside
But I still like it
Like it when it hurts like hell

Like it when it hurts like hell
Like it when it hurts like
Like it when it hurts like hell
