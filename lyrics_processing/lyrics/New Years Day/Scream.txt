It's insatiable the worse I crave
This bed becomes my cage
I'm ready for what you give to me
If I let you get a taste
It's insane
That I can't get you out of my head
So take me
Use my body to sin

Bring me to bed but don't sleep
I wanna feel your sweat on my skin
Gimme the pressure you know I need
And if I'm tied up, you take the lead

Tell me how you want me
I can be your little slave
I can make your dreams come
I can make your dreams come true
If you want me on my knees
Just beg me pretty please
I can make you scream so
I can make you scream so loud

We both know you want control
To keep my mouth shut
So push me further than this
With stained red fingertips
Obscene
You're under a spell
You're trapped inside
Save me by destroying me

Bring me to bed but don't sleep
I wanna feel your sweat on my skin
Gimme the pressure you know I need
And if I'm tied up, you take the lead

Tell me how you want me
I can be your little slave
I can make your dreams come
I can make your dreams come true
If you want me on my knees
Just beg me pretty please
I can make you scream so
I can make you scream so loud
I know you want me
I know you need me
But I just wanna fuck

Passion drowns our ache for love
Maybe that's enough for us

Tell me how you want me
I can be your little slave
I can make your dreams come
I can make your dreams come true
If you want me on my knees
Just beg me pretty please
I can make you scream so
