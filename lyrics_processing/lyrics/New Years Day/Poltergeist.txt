Can you hear me now?
White noise drowning me out
I don't know what I did
'Fraid like a little kid
Trapped underneath my bed
All I want now
Is to find a way out
'Cause I'm convinced
Call in the exorcist
How did it get to this?

Becoming a shadow of who I was
Can anyone hear me?

Screaming from inside
It's haunting me like a poltergeist
Eating me alive
It's got me running for my life
There's something deep beneath
The surface that's possessing me
Can you hear me now?
The silence, the silence is drowning me out

Echoes in the night
Bringing me to life
Forgotten, unwanted
I'm helplessly fallen
Not running but crawling, I fight
'Cause I'm unafraid
Of something I've made
Somewhere beneath it
I wanna believe it
Help me find a way

To get back the things that I have lost
Can anybody hear me?

Screaming from inside
It's haunting me like a poltergeist
Eating me alive
It's got me running for my life
There's something deep beneath
The surface that's possessing me
Can you hear me now?
The silence, the silence is drowning me out
(The silence, the silence is drowning me out
The silence, the silence is drowning me out)
Like a dream that never ends
Can't wake up, can't make amends
These walls are slowly caving in
Breaking bad with all my sins
Such a heavy broken heart
Can't take the weight of all these scars
Something out there telling me
No one here is listening

Screaming from inside
It's haunting me like a poltergeist
Eating me alive
It's got me running for my life
There's something deep beneath
The surface that's possessing me
Can you hear me now?
