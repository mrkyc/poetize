This rose is kind and still
With change comes hatred
Now time to kill
I've heard it all
I know I cared too much
But It's cruel to let you die
I'll take the fall
I'll be the heartless one
My veins are made of ice
Well I'm not afraid
To take the world on myself
But if I can't have it all
Then no one will
Nothing's gonna save me
The evil that I see
Has taken over me
No ones gonna save me
The damage has been done
I'm righting all the wrongs
I'm relentless like you made me
You fool!

Now sinister and sharp
I was weak I would fall for a promise
I had no guard
Been through the worst
I've seen the purest soul
Fill up with such disdain
Watching them fall
Trying to take me out
I see your foolish games
Well I'm not afraid
To take the world on myself
But if I can't have it all
Then no one will
Nothing's gonna save me
The evil that I see
Has taken over me
No ones gonna save me
The damage has been done
I'm righting all the wrongs
I'm relentless like you made me
Rotten to the core
Sacred vows are torn
Can't expect a snake to be a sheep
Can't expect a liar not to cheat
