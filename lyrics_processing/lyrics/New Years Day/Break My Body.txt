(Break it)

It's the late nights
'Til the sunlight
It's how you bite
And the way you leave a mark
In the dark
I'm seeing stars
It's leaving scars
Across my heart
It's one stroke
Of a match strike
Whenever we light
We set the whole damn world on fire
With desire
Running wild
Fever's getting higher and higher
So break my body

We crash, collide
Head on and the sparks ignite
We burn, we rage
Going down, down in flames
Won't stop 'til the night is through
This is how we do, me and you
So go on and break my body
Break, break
Go on and break my body
Break, break
Go on and break my body

'Cause we're hell-bent
Dripping with sweat
Back of my neck
The way you make me lose my breath
I come alive
Inside
Round two, you're going down tonight
It's I hate you
When I want you
It's the face off
It's gonna get me off
So break my body

We crash, collide
Head on and the sparks ignite
We burn, we rage
Going down, down in flames
Won't stop 'til the night is through
This is how we do, me and you
So go on and break my body
Break, break
Go on and break my body
Break, break
Go on and break my body
I can take it, never fake it
Give me hell 'cause I like it like that
I like it better when you don't hold back
So don't hold back and break my body
(Break it, break it, break it)
Break it

We crash, collide
Head on and the sparks ignite
We burn, we rage
Going down, down in flames
Won't stop 'til the night is through
This is how we do, me and you
So go on and break my body
Break, break
Go on and break my body
Break, break
Go on and break my body
Break, break
Go on and break my body
Break, break
Go on and break my body
Break my body
