Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

I never knew that I was dealing with a graduate
With a major in defensive and a minor in excuses
It's not that hard to say you're wrong
Admit it, oh, go on, go on
You know I wouldn't want to make you feel worse than you should
But if you were me you'd do the same you know you would, you know, you would
It's not that hard to say you're wrong
Admit, oh, go on, go on

Oh-oh
It'd mean everything just to hear you say to me
That I was right and you were wrong
It's not that hard, go on, go on
It'd mean everything just to hear you say to me
That I was right and you were wrong
It's not that hard, go on, go on

I know you know it's all your fault and I should let this go
But I need to hear you say it love, it's principle, it's principle
It's not that hard to say you're wrong
Admit it, oh, go on, go on

Oh-oh
It'd mean everything just to hear you say to me
That I was right and you were wrong
It's not that hard, go on, go on
It'd mean everything just to hear you say to me
That I was right and you were wrong
It's not that hard, go on, go on
I was right and you were wrong
It's not that hard, go on, go on
Go on, go on

It would mean everything
But you're so smart with those clever eyes
So I tell you that I love you, and blow you a kiss
But until you say you're sorry, well that's all you're gonna get, oh
That's all you're gonna get, oh
Oh-oh

Oh-oh
It'd mean everything just to hear you say to me
That I was right and you were wrong
It's not that hard, go on, go on
It'd mean everything just to hear you say to me
That I was right and you were wrong
It's not that hard, go on, go on
I was right and you were wrong
