Cut the music up
A little louder, yeah

You had a lot of crooks try to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love, how to love, mm
You had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in a corner, tryna put it together
How to love, how to love, mm
For a second you were here (Hey), now you over there (Hey, hey)
It's hard not to stare the way you're moving your body
Like you never had a love (Ayy), never had a love (Ayy)

When you was just a youngin, your looks were so precious
But now you're grown up, so fly, it's like a blessin'
But you can't have a man look at you for five seconds
Without you being insecure
You never credit yourself, so when you got older
It seems like you came back ten times over
Now you're sittin' here in this damn corner
Looking through all your thoughts and looking over your shoulder

See you had a lot of crooks try to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love, how to love, mm
See you had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in this corner, tryna put it together
How to love, ah, how to love, mm
For a second you were here (Hey), now you over there (Hey)
It's hard not to stare the way you're moving your body (Hey)
Like you never had a love (Ayy), uh, had a love (Ayy)

Oh, and you had a lot of dreams that transform to visions
The fact that you saw the world affected all your decisions
But it wasn't your fault, wasn't in your intentions
To be the one here talking to me, be the one listenin', but
But I admire your poppin' bottles and dippin'
Just as much as you admire bartendin' and strippin', baby
So don't be mad, nobody else trippin'
You seen a lot of crooks and them crooks still crook

You see, you had a lot of crooks try to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out

That you deserve the best, you're beautiful (Ayy)
You're beautiful (Ayy), yeah
And I want you to know
You're far from the usual (Ayy), far from the usual (Ayy)
