But some can still try
To make their lives a little different
Before the time it goes by
Now I live up around the north shore in a room with no view
Every morning on that ferry, my view is filled with you
I'm gonna let my heart take me away
I'm gonna jump a little further everyday
I'm gonna let my heart take me away
I'm the long jumping jeweler of Lavender Bay
She's there every single morning with about a hundred more
They watch as I come a-runnin', they all know the score
I always like to be the last one so I jump as she pulls away
The gap gets a little bit wider the longer I delay
I'm gonna let my heart take me away
I'm gonna jump a little further everyday
I'm gonna let my heart take me away
I'm the long jumping jeweler of Lavender Bay
I handle gemstones in the city
In a little lane off Australia square
I got one picked out for you that looks so pretty
But I got to make you notice that I'm there
Well I started to make the papers and people began to bet
Would I end up with the lady or would I just end up getting wet
Now I'm not gonna give you the answer
In oh so many words
But swimming in Sydney Harbour
You know is strictly for the birds

I'm gonna let my heart take me away
I'm gonna jump a little further everyday
I'm gonna let my heart take me away
'cause I'm the long jumping jeweler of Lavender Bay
I'm the long jumping jeweler of Lavender Bay
Long jump, long jumping jeweler
I live in Lavender Bay
Hear what I say
I'm the long jumping jeweler of Lavender Bay
Long jumping jeweler ... (repeat)
