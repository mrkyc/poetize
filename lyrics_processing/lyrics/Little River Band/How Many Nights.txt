How many dreams will come true before we believe what is coming through?
How many days will it take and not give a damn about the bonds we break?
'til we decide to unite, I wonder how many nights?
On and on we go, the wind will blow our way
And we take a chance that love will come to stay
We could change the past if we had second sight
But we still would say "I wonder how many nights?"
How many nights will we sleep and not know a thing about the dreams we keep?
How many tears 'til we know we can't have it all until we all let go?
How many times will we break and come back again to make the same mistake?
Until we find out who's right, I wonder how many nights?
On and on we go, the wind will blow our way
And we take a chance that love will come to stay
We could change the past if we had second sight
But we still would say "I wonder how many nights?"
On and on we go (one and on we go) and the wind will blow (and the wind will blow)
And we take a chance (and we take a chance), on how many nights (on how many nights)
On and on we go (on and on we go) and the winds will blow (on and on)
How many nights will transpire wanting for love and playing with fire?
Do we know what we must learn before we can love and be loved in return?
Until we ask ourselves why, I wonder how many nights?
