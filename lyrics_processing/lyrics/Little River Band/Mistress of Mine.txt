I'm torn like the wind, there's magic in her eyes
I'm a slave to her love, I'm fooled by her disguise
That mistress of mine, that mistress of mine
She turns like the tide and takes me where I've never been
There's peace at her side, she's a lady and a gypsy queen
I'm caught by her spell, sometimes I wish I'd never seen
That mistress of mine, that mistress of mine
So, I say to myself, it's no good being left in the cold
It's no fun to be out on a shelf, and so sad to be lonely when your old
But I'll never give in, I accept the way that she lives
But could I ever start again?
If I cease to share the love that she gives
That mistress of mine, dah, da, da, dah
Dah, da, dah, dah, da, dah, dah, da, dah
Dah, da, dah, dah, da, da, dah
She's there like the heat, she dances like the fireflies
I'm torn like the wind, there's magic in her eyes
I'm a slave to her love, I'm fooled by her disguise
That mistress of mine, that mistress of mine
So, I say to myself, it's no good being left in the cold
It's no fun to be out on the shelf, and so said to be lonely when your old
But I'll never give in, I accepted the way that she lives
But could I ever start again?
