No parachute and no prayers to say
Yes, my faith flies off a mountain everyday
And there's no parachute, no goddamn prayers to say
Frightened little monkey up a telegraph pole
Sending out a signal to somebody, somebody
Somebody, please, somebody
I want to hear a song that makes me believe in something
I want to hear a song that makes me believe something
I want to hear a song that makes me believe there's something to believe in
I want to hear a song that makes me believe
Hey!
Had a dream...
I was riding on a train that wasn't bound for glory
Riding on a train, the train was bound for Hell
Riding on a train that wasn't bound for glory, that's for sure
Riding on a train bound for Hell
The engine with human blood was damp
The headlight was a brimstone lamp
An imp, for fuel, was shovelin' bones
And the furnace roared with a thousand groans

The Devil himself was engineer
The passengers were a mixed-up crew
Churchman, Atheist, Baptist, Jew
The rich in broadcloth, poor in rags
Handsome girls, wrinkled hags
Black men, yellow, red and white
Chained together, fearful sight
The train rushed on at an awful pace
The sulfur fumes burned hands and face
Wilder and wilder the country grew
Faster and faster the engine flew
Loud and terrible thunder crashed
Whiter, brighter lightning flashed
Hotter still the air became
Till clothes were burned from each shrieking frame
There came a fearful ear-splitting yell;
Yelled Satan: "Gents, the next stop's Hell!"
'Twas then the passengers shrieked with pain
And begged the Devil to stop the train:
"Stop this train!"
He shrieked and roared and grinned with glee
And mocked and laughed at their misery
"My friends, you've bought your seats on this road
I've got to get through with a complete load
You bully the weak, you've cheated the poor
The starving tramp you turned from the door
You've laid up gold till your purses bust
You've given way to your beastly lust
You've mocked at God in your hell-full pride
You've killed, and you've cheated, you've plundered and lied
You've double-crossed men, and you've swore, and you've stole
Not a one but is perjured in body and soul
Body and soul
So you've paid full fare, and I'll carry you through
If there's one don't belong, I'd like to know who
And here's a time when I ain't no liar
I'll land you all safe in a land of fire
And your flesh will scorch in the flames that roar
You'll sizzle and burn from rind to core!"
Then I awoke with a thrilling cry
My were clothes were wet, my hair stood high
And I prayed as I've never until that hour
To be saved from Hell and the Devil's power
It appears that my vows were not in vain
