Like a cocaine snowstorm
It's crystal clear in here, in here
Soft saxophones blow away
Like a cocaine snowstorm
It's crystal clear in here, in here
Soft saxophones blow away
Like a cocaine snowstorm
It's crystal clear in here, in here
Soft saxophones blow away
Blow away
Opposites attract me
Teach me to be holy
Little ego begins to fall
When your light is on me
I'm feeling holy, holy
When your light is on me
Here comes the magic again
Here comes the magic again
Soft saxophones blow away
Like a cocaine snowstorm
It's crystal clear in here, in here

Melatonin lets the dreams in
Serotonin is for surfing
Adrenalin keeps us running
Endorphin is our morphine

Want to shoot you through a needle

If there is a cure
I don't want to take it
And if there is a cure
Then I don't want to know
'Cause this is sweet addiction
My sweet addiction

You're my drug
My drug
