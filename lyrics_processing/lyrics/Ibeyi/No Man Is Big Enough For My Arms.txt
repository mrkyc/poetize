No man in the world, no man in the world
The measure of any society is how it treats its women and girls

No man is big enough for my arms
No man in the world, no man in the world
No man is big enough for my arms
The measure of any society is how it treats its women and girls

We create
The smart, powerful, creative, accomplished young women
We can fight
I'm here because of you. I'm here because girls like you inspire me
No man in the world

(No man, no man)
No man is big enough for my arms
Many of these girls have faced unthinkable obstacles just to attend school
(No man, no man)
No man is big enough for my arms
The measure of any society is how it treats its women and girls

Won't stand still
Your story is my story, your story is my story
Won't be shamed
Your story is my story, your story is my story

And I, I told them they should disregard anyone who demeans or devalues them, and that they should make their voices heard in the world
(No man, no man)
No man is big enough for my arms
No man in the world

(No man, no man
No man is big enough for my arms)
And I told them, I told them that they deserve to be treated with dignity and respect, and I, I told them that they should disregard anyone who demeans or devalues them. They should make their voices heard in the world
(No man, no man
No man is big enough for my arms)
Big enough for my arms

The measure of any society is how it treats its women and girls
