And it feels like the heartache fades a little more away
I look in the mirror and I like what I see
Hey you didn't take that much, baby, out of me...
Something proud and something strong
Fills the absence of a memory that's dead and gone...
(Chorus)
I do believe I'm crossing over
I feel that weight come off my shoulder
I close my eyes, and I drift over
To the other side...
And lord I swear I'm crossing over
I found the strength to let you go
And the thought of you, is getting colder and further from my mind...
And I think I've crossed that line- to the other side...
Lately I find, when I'm walking through town
I don't have to look away, I don't have to look down
If I should find you with somebody new
Well, I might get sentimental, but I'll make it through...
Something real and something right
Puts the shadow of a doubt in a different light....

I do believe I be crossing over
I feel that weight come off my shoulder
I close my eyes, and I drift closer
To the other side...
And now I swear I'm crossing over
I found the strength to let you go
And the thought of you, is getting colder and further from my mind...
And I think I've crossed that line- to the other side...
Something real and something right
Puts the shadow of a doubt in a different light....
(Chorus)
I do believe I'm crossing over
I feel that weight come off my shoulder
I close my eyes, and I drift closer
To the other side...
And lord I swear I'm crossing over
I found the strength to let you go
And the thought of you- is getting colder and further from my mind
And I think I've crossed that line- to the other side!
