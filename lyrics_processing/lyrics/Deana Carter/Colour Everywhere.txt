Never something in between
Waitin on the love of my life
To come into my dreams
Everything in shades of gray

And now there's colour everywhere
My life was so predictable
Never any mystery
But ever since you shined the light
All of that is history
Now I have a hand to hold
And a reason to believe
There's someone in my life worth living for

To put the happiness back in my heart and

The beauty that was waiting for me
