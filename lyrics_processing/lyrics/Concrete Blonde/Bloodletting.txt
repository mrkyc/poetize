And a bloodstain on the bed

I'm going down by the river
Where it's warm and green
I'm gonna have drink
And walk around
I got a lot to think about

There's a rocking chair
By the window down the hall
I hear something there
In the shadow down the hall
Oh you were a vampire
And now I am nothing at all

And now I am nothing at all

In the middle of the night
