If-If by any chance you would make a mistake
To try to come in and take any one of us
We will not let you, you will die
You will have to take anybody over all of our dead bodies
"Love is the only weapon"
Martin Luther King died with love
Kennedy died talkin' about something he couldn't even understand
Some kinda generalized love
And he never even backed it up
He was shot down, bullshit
"Love is the only weapon with which I've got to fight"
I got a hell of a lot weapons to fight
I got my claws, I got cutlasses
I got guns, I got dynamite
I got a hell of a lot to fight
I'll fight, I'll fight
Ah-ah-ah, I will fight, I will fight
I will fight, I will fight
I will fight, I will fight

Sheep are running scared tonight
The cows are coming home
They cling together terrified
Afraid to be alone
The bees are buzzing around the queen
Waiting for a word
Affected gods observe the scene
Collectively absurd
You might also like
They're looking for Jesus
They're looking for more
Just what are they looking up here to me for
They're looking for someone
They're looking for Christ
They're looking for some human sacrifice

It looks like Jonestown again
It looks like Jonestown
It looks like Jonestown again
It looks like Jonestown

They don't know who to run to
They don't know where to go
Unless you tell them what to think
They don't know what they know
Repeating the commercial
Something they have heard
From someone not they someone else
Somebody good with words

I think they're looking for an answer
They're looking for more
Just what are they looking up here to me for
They're looking for Jesus
They're looking for Christ
They're looking for some human sacrifice
It looks like Jonestown again
It looks like Jonestown again
It looks like Jonestown again
It looks like Jonestown again, oh

They're looking for an answer
They're looking for more
Just what are you looking up here to me for
They're looking for Jesus
They're praying for Christ
They're looking for some human sacrifice
It looks like Jonestown (Jonestown, yeah)

It looks like Jonestown
It looks like Jonestown out here, ah ah, yeah
