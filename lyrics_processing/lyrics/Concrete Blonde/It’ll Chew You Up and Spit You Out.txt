And psychic lady pointed at me
She said come on in and I gave her my money
Said tell me, tell me, what you see
And she said she saw the angels dancing with me
Dancing to the beat of my feet down the street
She said she saw the angels dancing with me
Keep on, keep on, keep on now
Still in Hollywood
Oh I thought I'd be out of here by now
Still in Hollywood
My, my I'm running on a wheel and I don't know why
I don't know why
And I ran into Tommy Pomy
What a goddamned phony
Had a new fish on the line
Well the last one left with the last bad check
The only good one that he ever had died
I gotta live and let live, I gotta learn to forgive
You know that everybody's got a right
But there's evil all around in this broken down city
It's a twenty four hour fight
Still in Hollywood
Oh wow I thought I'd be outta here by now
Still in Hollywood
My, my I'm running on a wheel and don't know why
Still in Hollywood
Oh wow I thought I'd be outta here by now
Still in Hollywood
My, my, my I'm running on a wheel
And don't know, don't know, don't know why

We can hop on the Harley and cruise
We can start at the pier and share a beer
Head out to the desert
I can feel it from here
Ride all the way to where the lizards play
Riding on, and on, and on
There's a million stars it'll blow you away
It's all so Concrete Blonde
Still in Hollywood
Thats right, you know we can ride it out all night
Still in Hollywood

Still in Hollywood
Oh yeah, ooo...

What's-a-matter with you, young man?
Going to Hollywood, gonna be a big shot?
That town's gonna suck you up and spit you out!
You ain't gonna have a pot to piss in!
Don't come back to me for a job!
You made your bed, now sleep in it!
Go back to these Copelands, what else...who are they anyways?
The Stewie, Miles Copelands...you ain't gonna have a dime!
