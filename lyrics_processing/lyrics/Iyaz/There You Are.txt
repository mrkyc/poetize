When my days are dark and my nights are cold
You come over so I won't be alone
You canceled an engagement with your friend
I cherish every single second that we spend
And I can count on you to never let me down
You tell me that you love me without making a sound
And I can't help the way I feel when you are around

'Cause when the sun comes out on a rainy day
And I thought I'll never love again but now I say
There you are (there you are, you are, you are, you are, you are)
There you are
When the times got hard they said you'd leave
Turns out you were the only one that stood by me
There you are (there you are, you are, you are, you are, you are)
There you are

It's funny how them other guys checking you
And saying I can't do the things they can do
But I got something they can never get
And this will be around even when money ain't
And I can count on you to never let me down
You tell me that you love me without making a sound
And I can't help the way I feel when you are around
You might also like
'Cause when the sun comes out on a rainy day
And I thought I'll never love again but now I say
There you are (there you are, you are, you are, you are, you are)
There you are
When the times got hard they said you'd leave
Turns out you were the only one that stood by me
There you are (there you are, you are, you are, you are, you are)
There you are

And I can count on you to never let me down
You tell me that you love me without making a sound
And I can't help the way I feel when you are around

'Cause when the sun comes out on a rainy day
And I thought I'll never love again but now I say
There you are (there you are, you are, you are, you are, you are)
There you are
When the times got hard they said you'd leave
Turns out you were the only one that stood by me
There you are (there you are, you are, you are, you are, you are)
