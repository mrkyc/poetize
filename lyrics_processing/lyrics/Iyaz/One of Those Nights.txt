Ayo, ayo
Ayo, just one of those nights
Ayo, ayo
Cause it's just one of those nights

We going crazy tonight
We don't know where we're going
But we gon' jump in the car and drive
And we figure it out as we go
With the radio on and they're playing our song

I love the feeling of living life on the edge
When you don't care who is watching, you dance
You're in the moment that you are will never end
Never end, no, it don't have to end

Cause it's just one of those nights, you do what you wanna
Let the top down and cruise like it's summer
Ayo, ayo, ayo, just one of those nights
Ayo, ayo, cause it's just one of those nights

Cause it's just one of those nights
Cause it's just one of those nights
You might also like
Where everybody turn up
We don't know where we're going
We came to ball, we party hard
Ride around in my CK, all these pretty girls with me
Radio on and they're playing our song

I love the feeling of living life on the edge
When you don't care who is watching, you dance
You're in the moment that you are will never end
Never end, no, it don't have to end

Cause it's just one of those nights, you do what you wanna
Let the top down and cruise like it's summer
Ayo, ayo, ayo, just one of those nights
Ayo, ayo, cause it's just one of those nights

Wanna party, everybody
(cause it's just one of those nights)
Got somebody who anybody
(cause it's just one of those nights)
We do it all and we getting rowdy
(cause it's just one of those nights)
Everything is on me, all Bacardi
Now hey, hey, who wanna stay
Pour another shot on your way
You know why to keep them come in
Til the morning, start hit a face
Now hey, hey, who wanna stay
Pour another shot on your way (way, way, way)
Cause it's just one of those nights

Cause it's just one of those nights, you do what you wanna
Let the top down and cruise like it's summer
Ayo, ayo, ayo, just one of those nights
Ayo, ayo, cause it's just one of those nights
Cause it's just one of those nights, you do what you wanna
Let the top down and cruise like it's summer
Ayo, ayo, ayo, just one of those nights
Ayo, ayo, cause it's just one of those nights
Cause it's just one of those nights, you do what you wanna
Let the top down and cruise like it's summer
Ayo, ayo, ayo, just one of those nights
