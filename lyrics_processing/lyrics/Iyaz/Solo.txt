Well ya dun know it's ya boy I-Y-A-Z
Alongside the man J-R'a
I said I don't want to walk this earth
If I gotta do it solo
(J-J-J-J-J.R.)

See how we used to be a team
Running the streets, yeah we was living out our dream, oh
You used to be my rider, I was your provider
Now we separated in two

Oh, and baby you left and sailed away alone (yeah alone)
And now you got me trapped up on this island
With nowhere to get home

And I don't wanna go, go
I don't wanna go, go
I don't want it no, no
I don't want it no, no
I don't want to walk this earth
If I gotta do it solo, solo
'Cause I was so high and now I'm so low
And I don't wanna walk around alone, solo
I said I don't want to walk this earth
If I gotta do it solo, solo, solo
You might also like
You was the beat onto my top line
Put us together and you have to hit the rewind
See, you give me a purpose, now I'm getting nervous
That my heart will never sing again
Oh, when we were burning up the airwaves
They knew us from the Virgin Islands to the U.K
See, we was on our way to the platinum and gold
Never thought that you'd go, but you did, yeah
Yeah, you did

Oh, and baby you left and sailed away alone (yeah alone)
And now you got me trapped up on this island
With nowhere to get home

And I don't wanna go, go
I don't wanna go, go
I don't want it no, no
I don't want it no, no
I don't want to walk this earth
If I gotta do it solo, solo
'Cause I was so high and now I'm so low
And I don't wanna walk around alone, solo
I said I don't want to walk this earth
If I gotta do it solo, solo, solo
I don't wanna walk S-O-L-O (no, no, no)
I don't wanna walk S-O-L-O
Oh no (oh no no) oh no (oh no no)
I don't wanna walk S-O-L-O

And I don't wanna go, go
I don't wanna go, go
I don't want it no, no
I don't want it no, no (yeah)
I don't want to walk this earth
If I gotta do it solo, solo
'Cause I was so high and now I'm so low
And I don't wanna walk around alone, solo
I said I don't want to walk this earth
