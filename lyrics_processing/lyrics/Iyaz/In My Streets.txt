Yagga oh! Yagga oh!
Yagga oh!
Yeah, ay!

In the streets, it's hard times
Never slippin', I'm on my grind
I'm gonna need her on my side
The only one who could hold me down (me down)
Everybody on a paper chase
And when you winnin' is when they gon' hate ya (hate ya)
They'll try to stick up for that dough, dough, dough, dough, dough, dough
To let them guns blow, blow, blow, blow, blow
This how them shottas they do, do, do, do, do, do
Right here in my hood, hood, hood, hood, hood, hood

Ch'yeah!
Keep the steel all day
Haters gon' hate when they see my name
Yes they gon' hate when they see my arm
Plus I pull up in a foreign car (foreign car)
When you hop out with a foreign broad
(They definitely gon' hate ya)
Cuz you gettin' them checks
And you ain't with the shit
Cuz you 'bout your paper
They don't care 'bout how you got it
All they aimin' for is the bling and your wallet
Test me, nigga, I will aim it and pop it
Live in the bunks while I was raised in the projects
This  made me a target
Ban Sik so you can't tell what I'm armin'
For that dough, if you think you can harm me
Better have your body armour or your army

They'll try to stick up for that dough, dough, dough, dough, dough, dough
To let them guns blow, blow, blow, blow, blow
This how them shottas they do, do, do, do, do, do
Right here in my hood, hood, hood, hood, hood, hood

I'm tryna get my paper right
I did some wrongs, time to make it right
Cuz where I come from, it ain't safe to fly
That's why you gotta stay low brow
Watch for the goons with the great .44
911 but the chase won't show
A time won't come if your face don't know
Cuz I'm about to take the world by storm
Chick in your dreams is the girl in my arm
 a trick like Merlin, I'm gone
This the clip, then it's the firm in the graw
You can't manage that shit
I ain't got time for you Cabbage Patch Kids
Talk too much, I'ma damage that lip
Find you in a wheelchair, on some handicap shit
In the streets, it's hard times
Never slippin', I'm on my grind
I'm gonna need her on my side
The only one who could hold me down (me down)
Everybody on a paper chase
And when you winnin' is when they gon' hate ya (hate ya)
They'll try to stick up for that dough, dough, dough, dough, dough, dough
