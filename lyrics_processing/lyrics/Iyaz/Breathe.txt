I'mma just breathe and let it out
Breathe and let it out, breathe and let it out
I'mma just breathe and let it out
Breathe and let it out, breathe and let it out

It started, we was at the mall, it's the first place we ever met
Off in a gaze?, I was thinkin' of ways to tell my love that this is the end
And as we sittin sippin' Pina Coladas, the thoughts wouldn't leave me alone
I know exactly what I gotta do, but I'mma let her know when we get home
My love don't wanna see you cry, and I don't never wanna leave
This situation got me so lost for words, but I'mma try to tell you how I feel

How am I to tell the love of my life, I'm in love with my best friend
I play it over and over up in my head, and I know how it's gonna end
How am I to tell the love of my life, I'm in love with my best friend
I'm tryin' hard to find the word, but not one seems to make sense

I'mma just breathe and let it out
Breathe and let it out, breathe and let it out
I'mma just breathe and let it out
Breathe and let it out, breathe and let it out

Oh baby, lemme holla at you, cause I really think that we need to talk
And by the way that you looked in my eyes, I could tell you knew something was wrong
And as I watched as you tried to plate up, with the tears fillin' up in your eyes
You put your hands around my waist and hugged me tighter and said "Baby tell me what's on your mind"
My love, you know me from the get go, I've always got to keep real
This situation got me so lost for words but I'mma try to tell you how I feel

How am I to tell the love of my life, I'm in love with my best friend
I play it over and over up in my head, and I know how it's gonna end
How am I to tell the love of my life, I'm in love with my best friend
I'm tryin' hard to find the word, but not one seems to make sense

I'mma just breathe and let it out
Breathe and let it out, breathe and let it out
I'mma just breathe and let it out
Breathe and let it out, breathe and let it out

Eh, Oh I, Oh I, Oh I
I'm I love with my best friend
Eh, Oh I, Oh I, Oh I
I'm I love with my best friend
I'mma just breathe and let it out
Breathe and let it out, breathe and let it out
I'mma just breathe and let it out
