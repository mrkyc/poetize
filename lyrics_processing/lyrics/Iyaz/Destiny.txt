Yaga oh
Kabaka P don show them
Yeah I, I know, I know
I wanna rule my destiny
I know, I know
What it feel like

Judge a wave me this man in
I have destiny calling
Got my head to the sky
Them can't hold me down
Them can't stop me now
Mama's voice keeps me focused
When I don't know who trust
I tell her 'mama, be waiting
Somehow I'm going to make it'

As I close my eyes
I say a new prayer tonight
'Cause I'm 'bout to start a new life
I be up up and away
Gone like a thief in the night
When they tell a story
Talk 'bout their boyfriend, the bay
While we at a whole other place
We been in flight
Captain say 'touch down in five'
Tell destiny I just arrived
You might also like
Oh destiny, I know it might take time
And the thought you is keeping me alive
Gonna rule my destiny
Destiny, I've been searching high and low
And I won't give up until you are my home
My destiny

I'm trying to get a win for the culture
I try and stay away from the vultures
So many don't play, they my friend
When really they my envy
Here to pretend, no
And I couldn't wait to blow
And pull up to every show
And I make them chant my name

As I close my eyes
I say a new prayer tonight
'Cause I'm 'bout to start a new life
I be up up and away
Gone like a thief in the night
When they tell a story
Talk 'bout their boyfriend, the bay
While we at a whole other place
We been in flight
Captain say 'touch down in five'
Tell destiny I just arrived
Oh destiny, I know it might take time
And the thought you is keeping me alive
Gonna rule my destiny
Destiny, I've been searching high and low
And I won't give up until you are my home
My destiny

Say me nah give up, me nah give in
If destiny calling me answering
No guarantee, no promises
But me tell myself, say me have to win, yeah
Me and try get a win for my island
Me no I switch for the finance
I wanna rule my destiny
Do what's best for me
With no stress for me my nan

When me touch the stage tonight
Flock to my right
If you're feeling my vibes
Light up for life
The world Caribbean unite
When they tell a story
About the boy from she here
We out the world, well amazed
We been in flight
Captain say 'touch down in five'
Tell destiny I've just arrived
Oh destiny, I know it might take time
And the thought you is keeping me alive
Gonna rule my destiny
Destiny, I've been searching high and low
And I won't give up until you are my home
My destiny
