Yagga o (yagga o)
Yeah I (yeah I)
Yagga o

They said I'm nothing but I laughed and told them keep talking
Now when they see me they hang their heads and keep walking
Does it hurt to see me shine, I'm getting radio and TV time
I rig them dossie doe, jumpin', screamin', yagga o

Some sittin' practing like they enemies
To think for once that they were friend a we
When they see you rolling through the street they try to act cool
But player hate cause I will never, ever doubt you

Many thought that I would fall, now I got it all
They thought that I will fail, that I'd just end up in jail

Look at me now
Look at me now
Look at me now
Look at me now
Look at me now
Look at me now now now
You might also like
They say that we won't last, we came up where to fast
We getting bigger and better with every day that past
Look at me now, us, ain't none of them can know me though
We comin' from the high to the west and east
And know every where else is down, down, down down

Mama told my spread your wings my son and fly
And though it might get rough you are your mother's child
They said you're nothing but son just tell them keep talking
So when they see you they'll hang their head and keep walking

Many thought that I would fall, now I got it all
They thought that I will fail, that I'd just end up in jail

Look at me now
Look at me now
Look at me now
Look at me now
Look at me now
Look at me now now now

So if you want to make a feeling
Or put your ones up to the ceiling
Cause we don't know how to lose, no way
So please just listen to the words that we sayin'
Just imagine that it was coming up
You try to come in but you can get a walk
Nobody can really hear your stuff
Cause the DJ isn't really play your cut
On top of that everybody hates you guts
All because you're really the boss
I'm blowin' up bigger than an African bus
But don't hate me cause you ain't do it like us
I know I good so why is shit so cruel
I give my best cause I got shit to lose
No it's my time, take your props but give me mine
Until the day I'm here to rest, every day I'll show up with the PVI

Many thought that I would fall, now I got it all
They thought that I will fail, that I'd just end up in jail

Look at me now
Look at me now
Look at me now
Look at me now
Look at me now
Look at me now now now

Many thought that I would fall, now I got it all
They thought that I will fail, that I'd just end up in jail
Look at me now
Look at me now
Look at me now
Look at me now
Look at me now
