Well, you done know it's your boy I-Y-A-Z
Alongside the man JR, Iyaz

Now I wanna do it up (so big)
Party it up (so big)
Spend it up (so big)
So the whole world knows my love for you is (so big)
My heart is (so big)
My love is (so big)
For you, for you

Now with a girl like you, nothing you can do
But give the whole world to her 24/7
When she looking so sweet, that kind of body
You dont mind spending all of your time, time, time
And its not that you're asking me for nothing
I just wanna show you how deep my love is

'Cause with them girls before
I wasn't feeling so, gone
But with you girl
I'm losing control, yo!

Now I wanna do it up (so big)
Party it up (so big)
Spend it up (so big)
So the whole world knows my love for you is (so big)
My heart is (so big)
My love is (so big)
For you, for you

Now with a girl like you, I don't care who
Passes my way, Rihanna or Beyonce
Could holla at me, it doesn't mean a thing
'Cause nothing compares to the joy you bring

So them other girls can go
They don't make me feel so, calm
'Cause with you girl
I'm losing control, oh!

Now I wanna do it up (so big)
Party it up (so big)
Spend it up (so big)
So the whole world knows my love for you is (so big)
My heart is (so big)
My love is (so big)
For you, for you

'Cause girl we are (so big)
Let's pop them bottles (so big)
Like superstars (so big)
We taking over (so big)
We got that love (so big)
Let's make it global (so big)
Let's blow it up (so big)
Oh, woah (woah-woah), oh-oh
Oh, woah, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
If this is real love
Then I didn't know before
She gotcha boy
Doing crazy things that I never thought I'd ever do, no

Now I wanna do it up (so big)
Party it up (so big)

So the whole world knows my love for you is (so big)
