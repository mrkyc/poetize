You think it's a fuckin' game?
World, wide, made it!

Tings wrong and that's why we grindin'
Cuz right now it's all 'bout survivin'
I gotta make it outta the ghetto someday
Can't live off of minimum wage
Still strugglin' and that's why I'm hustlin'
Cuz round here ain't no money comin' in
Ain't no same, people dyin' everyday
And that's how it is around my way

These times, so hard (Hard)
I, I grind, so hard (Hard)
I, I go, so hard (Hard)
Cuz I live so hard (Hard)
Hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard
(I think this muthafucka)
Hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard
(This muthafucka so)
Hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard
(This muthafucka goes)
Hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard
These times so hard

I'm hurtin', 2 jobs me workin'
My whole family still need supportin'
So how am I supposed to get by?
Cuz I can't even get a 9 to 5
Tings bad and no, we don't like it
The economy gone bad, we can't fight it
Decide to give you some tip
And if you see me, lemme see your husband

These times, so hard (Hard)
I, I grind, so hard (Hard)
I, I go, so hard (Hard)
Cuz I live so hard (Hard)
Hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard
(I think this muthafucka)
Hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard
(This muthafucka so)
Hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard
(This muthafucka goes)
Hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard
These times so hard

Yeah yeah, let me tell you where I come from
 I swear a lot of people do get gundam
We're well known from California to London
Still starvin', ghetto still roarin'
 don't listen, they still hollerin'
Still hustlin' from night to the mornin'
I get fuckin' serious, can you even see me laughin'?
These times, so hard (Hard)
I, I grind, so hard (Hard)
I, I go, so hard (Hard)
Cuz I live so hard (Hard)
Hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard
(I think this muthafucka)
Hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard
(This muthafucka so)
Hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard
(This muthafucka goes)
Hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard
