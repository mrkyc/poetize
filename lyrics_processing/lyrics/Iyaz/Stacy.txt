She's mad, been hurt for the very last time
He's gonna pay for the tears coming down her eyes
Those lies is gonna turn into a crime
She says that she's not gonna hurt no more
He's dead but he don't even know
He's laying down under the floor

Now she's pacing back and back and forth
He's smiling but he don't even know
What she's gonna do
But he's 'bout to find out soon

Stacy have a gun now, a gun now
Somebody getting gunned down, gunned down
Nobody really knows how, knows how
She'll blow him away
Now Stacy on the run now, run now
Somebody got gunned down, gunned down
Nobody really know how, know how
She blew him away

She's scared, thinking like "what have I done?"
In her mother car driving on the run
Close to the borderline, trying to hide that gun
From, the law who's right behind her car
She can see them getting close in the rearview mirror
She's a killer, I don't think she's gonna get too far

Somebody getting gunned down, gunned down
Nobody really knows how, knows how

Now Stacy on the run now, run now
Somebody got gunned down, gunned down

She blew him away

She running and a-running and a-running away
She running and a-running and a-running away
She running and a-running, but can she get away?
Running away, running away
She running and a-running and a-running away
She running and a-running and a-running away
She running and a-running, but can she get away?
Running away
Stacy have a gun now, a gun now
Somebody getting gunned down, gunned down
Nobody really knows how, knows how
She'll blow him away
Now Stacy on the run now, run now
Somebody got gunned down, gunned down
Nobody really know how, know how
