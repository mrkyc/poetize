Can't say I've never been a sensitive guy
But you find a way to keep my heart open wide
I'm telling you things that I never told no one
Spitting out words and I'm tripping on my tongue
One look at you, I just can't keep it inside

I'm crazy talking, falling like the whirlwinds
I can't help it, look what you've got me doing

I'm saying, I'm saying words I thought I'd never say
I never, not ever thought I'd ever feel this way
Telling the world about you, couldn't shut up if I wanted to
Not playing, I'm saying words I though I'd never say

Hey hey, keep saying these words I thought I'd never say
You make me wanna shout it out to the sky
Come to the rooftop and just let it all fly
I wanna put it in the song, so you hear it on the radio
Playing on the airways, New York to Tokyo
I'll tell the universe that, baby, you're mine

I'm crazy talking, falling like the whirlwinds
I can't help it, look what you've got me doing
You might also like
I'm saying, I'm saying words I thought I'd never say
I never, not ever thought I'd ever feel this way
Telling the world about you, couldn't shut up if I wanted to
Not playing, I'm saying words I though I'd never say

I say those three little words to tell you
You mean the world to me and I know without a doubt
I've never felt this for anyone, you are the only one
I just kiss, I talking about

I'm saying, I'm saying words I thought I'd never say
I never, not ever thought I'd ever feel this way
Telling the world about you, couldn't shut up if I wanted to
Not playing, I'm saying words I though I'd never say
I'm saying, I'm saying words I thought I'd never say
I never, not ever thought I'd ever feel this way
Telling the world about you, couldn't shut up if I wanted to
Not playing, I'm saying words I though I'd never say
I'm saying, I'm saying words I thought I'd never say
I never, not ever thought I'd ever feel this way
Telling the world about you, couldn't shut up if I wanted to
