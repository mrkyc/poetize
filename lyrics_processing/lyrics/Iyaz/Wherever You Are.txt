Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

It's easy to see it between us
Chemistry is crazy and
Baby, when I think about you
I lose my mind, mind, I lose my mind (mind)

All I need is an inch from you
Said that I can go a mile
Do what I can to understand
That I only wanna see you smile
Tell me what I gotta do for you
So that you can see that I (that I, that I, that I)

I'll be with you forever, I promise you'll never be too far
And, baby, forever, wherever you are (you are, you are)
I'll be with you forever back when you get back to my arms
And, baby, forever, I'll be where you are (you are, you are)

Wherever you are
Wherever you are
Wherever you are
Wherever you are (you are, you are)
You might also like
There's no need to worry
'Cause I'll be there in a hurry, baby
I got you, I promise I will never let you down
Down, won't let you down, down

All I need is an inch from you
Said that I can go a mile
Do what I can to understand
That I only wanna see you smile
Tell me what I gotta do for you
So that you can see that I (that I, that I, that I)

I'll be with you forever, I promise you'll never be too far
And, baby, forever, wherever you are (you are, you are)
I'll be with you forever back when you get back to my arms
And, baby, forever, I'll be where you are (you are, you are)

Baby, I'm coming
Don't you give up yet
I'm on my way, on my way, on my way
I will never keep me from getting to you
Wherever you are, wherever you are
Wherever you are, wherever you are
I'll be with you forever, I promise you'll never be too far
And, baby, forever, wherever you are (you are, you are)
I'll be with you forever back when you get back to my arms
And, baby, forever, I'll be where you are (you are, you are)

Wherever you are
Wherever you are
Wherever you are
