True fresh, I been 949
And everybody knows I'm a sucker for ice
So I'm like "What's up? Why you staying?"
"What's your name? Who you with?" She said
"My name is Brittany, and nobody's with me"
"And I came to party and have a good time"

Every girl in the club wants to be her
And her family says she a keeper
But they don't know what I know
She could be a crazy...
But I feel a bit o' paradise when I look into her eyes
I'm alright, I'm alright

This light of mine sets me on fire
She build me up, she break me down
Couldn't even let go; tell me, would you let go
Of what keeps you alive? Keeps you alive?
Yeah

I don't know whether it's wrong or right
But either way, I gotta take a bite
First sign of trouble, I'm diving in
And if I go too deep and get the bends
Well, maybe we can lay out by the pool and order takeout
Watching everybody watch us while we sipping champagne

(So we said)
She lights me up like the Fourth of July
When there's no holiday
And even if it's 100 degrees, I know she gon' keep it cool, whoa

This light of mine sets me on fire
She build me up, she break me down
Couldn't even let go; tell me, would you let go
Of what keeps you alive? Keeps you alive?
Yeah

You and I, we can never lose, yeah yeah yeah yeah
And now we're better, maybe cause of you
Cause I've been thinking lately
That maybe, just maybe
I'm going John Legend crazy
Cause all of me wants

This light of mine sets me on fire
She build me up, she break me down
Couldn't even let go; tell me, would you let go
Of what keeps you alive? Keeps you alive?
This light of mine sets me on fire
She build me up, she break me down
Couldn't even let go; tell me, would you let go
Of what keeps you alive? Keeps you alive?
