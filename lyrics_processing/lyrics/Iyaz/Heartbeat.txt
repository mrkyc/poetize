Well, it was just two years ago
I met a girl in San Fransisco
Took her by the hand and I said "Hello"
And it was then that I could see
Just her reflection of natural beauty
Never would've thought she'd become my own

Oh, oh, you got my heart beating like a drum roll
And if you said it's over I'll be done, woah
Man, I swear my hands start shaking and my heartbeat's racing like
"Bum, bum, rupapabum, oh, bum, bum" My heart's beating like drums
"Oh bum, bum, rupapabum, oh"
My hand starts shaking and my heartbeat's racing like
"Bum, bum, rupapabum, oh, bum, bum" My heart's beating like drums
"Oh bum, bum, rupapabum, oh"
My hand starts shaking and my heartbeat's racing like

Well now two years have passed
And we had our ups and downs
Please I said you'll be up and gone
But you're still by my side
Said everything would be alright
I guess I'm trying to say would you be my wife?

Oh, oh, you got my heart beating like a drum roll
And if you said it's over I'll be done, woah
Man, I swear my hands start shaking and my heartbeat's racing like
"Bum, bum, rupapabum, oh, bum, bum" My heart's beating like drums
"Oh bum, bum, rupapabum, oh"
My hand starts shaking and my heartbeat's racing like
"Bum, bum, rupapabum, oh, bum, bum" My heart's beating like drums
"Oh bum, bum, rupapabum, oh"
My hand starts shaking and my heartbeat's racing like

Me heart's beating like a drum
Me temperature like a sauna
If you know what I'm talking about
Then let me hear you holla
Me heart's beating like a drum
Me temperature like a sauna
If you know what I'm talking about
Then let me hear you holla

Oh, oh, you got my heart beating like a drum roll
And if you said it's over I'll be done, woah
Man, I swear my hands start shaking and my heartbeat's racing like
"Bum, bum, rupapabum, oh, bum, bum" My heart's beating like drums
"Oh bum, bum, rupapabum, oh"
My hand starts shaking and my heartbeat's racing like
"Bum, bum, rupapabum, oh, bum, bum" My heart's beating like drums
"Oh bum, bum, rupapabum, oh"
