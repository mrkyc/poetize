'Cause you're the definition of a good woman
Plus you give your boy that good loving, loving, oh
And it's more than just that, you had my back
When everybody say I wouldn't be nothing
Make me feel like I could be something, something, oh
I can't wait, can't wait
Till I see your face
We both hate when I go away
So let 'em say, let 'em say
What they wanna say
I know it can't rain every day, oh
ONE MILLION ways to lose it all
ONE MILLION ways that we could fall
But I keep holding on
I put that on my heart, baby
ONE MILLION miles kept you away
ONE MILLION days without your face
I never feel the love so strong
And I put that on my heart baby
Put that on my heart, girl, I put that on my heart
Put that on my heart, girl, I put that on my heart
Put that on my heart, girl, I put that on my heart, heart, heart
You might also likeEven thought we may fight, just give it li'l time
You know that we gon' be back up and running
Back to the kissing and the hugging, hugging. oh
Oh girl I need you to see, without you where would I be
You know you're my everything, my everything
I can't wait, can't wait
Till I see your face
We both hate when I go away
So let 'em say, let 'em say
What they wanna say
I know it can't rain every day, oh
ONE MILLION ways to lose it all
ONE MILLION ways that we could fall
But I keep holding on
I put that on my heart, baby
ONE MILLION miles kept you away
ONE MILLION days without your face
I never feel the love so strong
And I put that on my heart baby
I'll be right there till we grey and old
I'm gon' keep you warm when your world turns cold
Put me under pressure but my love won't fold, oh, oh, oh
Many can try but my love won't die
Can't shoot us down 'cause we up so high
Can't really explain what I see in your eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes
ONE MILLION ways to lose it all
ONE MILLION ways that we could fall
But I keep holding on
I put that on my heart, baby
ONE MILLION miles kept you away
ONE MILLION days without your face
I never feel the love so strong
And I put that on my heart baby
ONE MILLION ways to lose it all
ONE MILLION ways that we could fall
But I keep holding on
I put that on my heart, baby
ONE MILLION miles kept you away
ONE MILLION days without your face
I never feel the love so strong
And I put that on my heart baby
Put that on my heart, girl, I put that on my heart
Put that on my heart, girl, I put that on my heart
Put that on my heart, girl, I put that on my heart, heart, heart
Put that on my heart, girl, I put that on my heart
Put that on my heart, girl, I put that on my heart
Put that on my heart, girl, I put that on my heart
