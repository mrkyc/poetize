I said I don't want to walk this earth if I gotta do it solo
See girl we used to be a team
Runnin the streets (yeah)
We was living out our dream (ohh)
You used to be my rider
I was your provider
Now we separated in two
Oh we was burning up the block(yeah)
And everybody know when we step in the spot(ohh)
See, we was like the dynamic duo
Id never thought that you'd go, but you did uh, yeah you did
Oh baby you left and sailed away alone (Yeah, alone)
And now you got me trapped up on this island
Where nowhere to get home
And I don't wanna go, go
I don't wanna go, go
I don't wanna it no, no
I don't wanna it no, no
I don't want to walk this earth
If I gotta do it solo (solo)
Cuz I was so high
And now im so low
And I don't wanna walk around alone, solo
Said I don't want to walk this earth

You was the beat on to my top line
Put us together
And you'd have to hit rewind
See, you give me a purpose
Now I'm getting nervous
That my heart will never sing again
Oh, when we was runnin up the airways
They knew us from the Virgin Islands to the U.K
See, we was on the way to the platinum and gold
Never thought that you'd go but you did ya, ya you did
Oh baby you left and sailed away alone (Yeah, alone)
And now you got me trapped up on this island
Where nowhere to get home
And I don't wanna go, go

And now im so low
