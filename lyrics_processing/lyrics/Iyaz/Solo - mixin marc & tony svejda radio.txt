If I gotta do it solo
See how we used to be a team
Running the streets
Yeah we was living out our dream, oh
You used to be my rider
I was your provider
Now we separated in two
Oh, we was burning up the block, yeah
And everybody know when we step in the spot, oh
See, we was like the dynamic duo
I'd never thought that you'd go back, but you did, ah
Yeah, you did
Oh, baby, you left and sailed away alone (yeah, alone)
And now you got me trapped up on this island
With nowhere to get home
And I don't wanna go, go
I don't wanna go, go
I don't wanna go, no
I don't wanna go, no
I don't want to walk this earth

Solo
You asked me pinned onto my top line
Put us together
And you offered it the rewind
See, you give me a purpose
Now I'm getting nervous
That my heart will never sing again
Oh, when we were burning up the airways
Didn't know I was from the Virgin Islands or the UK (K)
See, we was on the way to the platinum and gold
Never thought you'd go back, but you did, yeah
Yeah, you did
Oh, baby, you left and sailed away alone (yeah, alone)
