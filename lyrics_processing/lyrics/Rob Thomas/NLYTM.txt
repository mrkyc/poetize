Man I heard it go boom, boom, boom
From the back of my room
But my feet don't move
Cause I'm stuck like glue
Like sometimes when I feel light
When I like the way we're looking
In the phantom street light
Oh my god, it's another one down
Street lace town, make it right now, bring it round
Thieves like us, we can make a change somehow
We can make it better but we don't know just how

It's not like, it's not like you told me
I'm sitting here sad and lonely
It's not like, it's not like you told me
I'm giving up, I'm giving in
Not like, it's not like you told me
Who's gonna be there to hold me
When someone brings me down

Man I heard like boom, boom, boom
Just a little too soon
And my head gets fooled
Cause I can't think straight
Like sometimes when it's real life
When you like the way it's looking
But you just don't feel right
Just hold up, here it comes now
It's letdown, let it out, let it start moving around
You can barely stand up now
Then you start to wonder where you'll land if you fall down

It's not like, it's not like you told me
I'm sitting here sad and lonely
It's not like, it's not like you told me
I'm giving up, I'm giving in
Not like, it's not like you told me
Who's gonna be there to hold me
When someone brings me down

And maybe all we get is over
And maybe all we need is more time

It's not like, it's not like you told me
I'm sitting here sad and lonely
It's not like, it's not like you told me
I'm giving up, I'm giving in
Not like, it's not like you told me
Who's gonna be there to hold me
When someone brings me down

It's not like, it's not like you told me
(Up on the middle and back to the front)
I'm giving up, I'm giving in
(Up on the middle and back to the front)
Who's gonna be there to hold me
