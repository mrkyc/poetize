In the evening when the stars shine down
All the bridge and tunnel girls come out
We can dance until the walls fall down
Cause tonight we own this town
But in the morning when the sun's on fire
I'm burning through you like a razor wire
When we see ourselves in passing windows
We feel like hell, everyone knows

You can't go back, heaven help me
We've gone too far, when we can't be
The ones we want
This is who we are, who we are

A shot of neon in a window pane
A shot of whiskey and we end again
You're moving further but you just can't win
And that's the way it's always been
You don't wanna let your life go by
So you give until the well runs dry
But when you lose your faith it never comes back
And time don't wait, now you know that

You can't go back, heaven help me
We've gone too far, when we can't be
The ones we want
This is who we are, who we are
I'm sorry but you can't go back, heaven help me
We know too much, please believe me
Believe yourself
This is who you are, who you are

You try to get your head around it but it's never enough
You give yourself a little something but it's not what you need
And all that worry, all for nothing
Where you've been and where you're going
And even if you changed it somehow
Every step would lead to right now

You can't go back, heaven help me
We've gone too far, when we can't be
The ones we want
This is who we are, who we are
I could tell you that you can't go back, heaven help me
We know too much, please believe me
Believe yourself
This is who you are, who you are
Oh, you can't go back, heaven help me
We've gone too far
We can't go back
This is who are, who we are

Oh, you can't go back, heaven help me
We've gone too far
