I'm not afraid of getting older
I'm one less day from dying young
I see the light go past my shoulder
I'm one less day from dying young

I see my life like a train with a one-way track
I've made mistakes, and I couldn't take 'em back
And I've been runnin' 'round in circles 'til I'm dizzy, I can't lie
But every night I go to sleep's a day that I survive

I'm not afraid of getting older
I'm one less day from dying young
I see the light go past my shoulder
I'm one less day from dying young

And I've seen my friends fall away before their time
And I've been afraid that I may follow in their light
So I drink and love and whisper all the things I know are right
Someday, I will leave this world, but maybe not tonight

I'm not afraid of getting older
I'm one less day from dying young
And I see the light go past my shoulder
I'm one less day from dying young
I'm one less day from dying young (Yeah)

All my life I have been wandering
Burning up my candle like my time just won't end
And I'll keep burning 'til there's nothing left
Praying that tomorrow I can do it all again
And if I get tomorrow, I will do it all again

I'm not afraid of getting older
I'm one less day from dying young
And I see the light go past my shoulder
I'm one less day from dying young
I'm not afraid of getting older
I'm one less day from dying young (From dying young)
I see the light go past my shoulder
I'm one less day from dying young (From dying young)
I'm one less day from dying young (From dying young)
Hey

I'm one less day from dying young
I see the light
I'm one less day from dying young
