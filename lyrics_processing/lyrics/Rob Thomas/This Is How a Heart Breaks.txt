Don't you wanna go for a ride
Just keep your hands inside
And make the most out of life
Now don't you take it for granted
Life is like a mean machine
It made a mess out of me
It left me caught between
Like an anchor dream I was stranded
I was stranded

And I'm steady, though I'm starting to shake
And I don't know how much more I can take

Well, this is it now
Everybody get down
This is all I can take
This is how a heart breaks
You take a hit now
You feel it break down
Make you stay wide awake
This is how a heart breaks

Don't you wanna go for a ride
Down to the other side
Feels so good you could cry
Now won't you do what I told you
I remember when you used to be shy
Yeah, once we were so fine, you and I
Yeah, why you gotta make it so hard on me?
Hey, it's hard on me

You're not the best thing that I knew
Never was, never cared too much for all this hanging around
It's just the same thing all the time
Never get what I want, never get too close to the end of the line
You're just the same thing that I knew
(Right before the time when I was running for you)


Well, this is it now
