"Oh, what the hell" she says "I just can't win for losin'"
And she lays back down
Man, there's so many times
I don't know what I'm doin'
Like I don't know now

And by the light of the moon she rubs her eyes
Says it's funny how the night can make you blind
I can just imagine (Imagine)
And I don't know what I'm supposed to do
But if she feels bad then I do too
So, I let her be

And she says, "Ooh
I can't take no more"
Her tears like diamonds on the floor
And her diamonds bring me down
'Cause I can't help her now
She's down in it
She tried her best and now she can't win
It's hard to see them on the ground
Her diamonds fallin' down
Way down (Way down, way down)

Well, she sits down and stares into the distance
And it takes all night (All night, all night)
And I know I could break her concentration
Oh, but it don't feel right

So, by the light of the moon, she rubs her eyes
Sits down on the bed and starts to cry
And there's something less about her
And I don't know what I'm supposed to do
So, I sit down and I cry too
But don't let her see

And she says, "Ooh
I can't take no more"
Her tears like diamonds on the floor
And her diamonds bring me down
'Cause I can't help her now
She's down in it
She tried her best and now she can't win
It's hard to see them on the ground
Her diamonds fallin' down

She shuts out the night
And tries to close her eyes
If she can find daylight
Then she'll be alright
She'll be alright
Just not tonight
And she says, "Ooh
I can't take no more"
Her tears like diamonds on the floor
And her diamonds bring me down
'Cause I can't help her now
She's down in it
She tried her best and now she can't win
It's hard to see them on the ground
Her diamonds fallin'
"Ooh, I can't take no more"
Her tears like diamonds on the floor
And her diamonds bring me down
'Cause I can't help her now
She's down in it
She tried her best and now she can't win
It's hard to see them on the ground
Her diamonds fallin' down
I can't take no more
Diamonds on the floor (no more, no more, no more)
Her diamonds fallin' down
I can't take no more
Diamonds on the floor (no more, no more, no more)
Her diamonds fallin' down, yeah
I can't take no more
Diamonds on the floor (no more, no more, no more)
Her diamonds fallin' over down, her diamonds fallin' down (oh, oh, oh)
