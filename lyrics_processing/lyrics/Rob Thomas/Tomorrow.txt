I listen to your heartbeat coming from the bed sheet
Keeping up the time with the song on the TV
Keeping up a tempo, everything is so low
I don't wanna sleep 'cause the moment is borrowed
Everything at half speed, like a woke dream
I don't wanna think that I won't see tomorrow

We are so fucked up
We just don't know how
We just keep on fighting
'Til the bell rings and we're out
Listen to that sound
Turn it up right now
'Cause we all know tomorrow
Will only break your heart

I listen to your heartbeat coming down the hallway
Kinda wanna reach but it's never in a real way
I'm a little simple, but I'm stable
I give it all when I can if I'm able
Everything is alright until it ain't right
And we all know that we ain't alright right now

'Til the bell rings and we're out
Listen to that sound

Don't look now my friend
We are lost and then
We come back again
Tomorrow will only break your heart

We are so fucked up
We just don't know how
We just keep on fighting
'Til the bell rings and we're out
Listen to that sound
And turn it up right now
'Cause we all know tomorrow
Will only break your heart
We fall down and then
(Turn it up right now
Tomorrow)
We come back again
(Tomorrow will only break your heart)
Tomorrow will only break your heart
(Listen to that sound
And turn it up right now)
Ah yeah
('Cause we all know tomorrow
Will only break your heart)
