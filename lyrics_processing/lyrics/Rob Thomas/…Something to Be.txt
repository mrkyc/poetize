Hey man, I don't wanna hear about love no more
I don't wanna talk about how I feel
I don't really wanna be me, no, no more
Dress down, now I look a little too boy next door
Maybe I should try to find a downtown whore
That'll make me look hardcore
I need you to tell me what to stand for

I've been looking for something (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Something I've never seen (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
We're all looking for something
Something to be
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Hey man, play another one of those heartbreak songs
Tell another story how things go wrong
And they never get back
My pain is a platinum stack
Take that shit back
You don't wanna be me when it all goes wrong
You don't wanna see me with the house lights on
I'm a little too headstrong
Stand tall, I don't wanna get walked on

We're all looking for something
Something to be
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Something to be
Yeah, oh no

I can't stand what I'm starting to be
No, I can't stand the people that I'm starting to need
There's so much now that can go wrong
And I don't need nobody trying to help it along
It's the same old song
Everybody says you've been away too long
Everybody wanna tell you what went wrong
Wanna make you like an icon
Till you believe that they're right

I've been looking for something
Something I've never seen
We're all looking for something
Something to be
Yeah, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
