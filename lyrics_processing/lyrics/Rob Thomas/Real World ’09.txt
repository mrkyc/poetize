"Hey yeah, welcome to the real world
Nobody told you it was gonna be hard"
You said, "Hey, yeah I can't believe it
I barely started now I'm falling apart"

And it's hard
Standing at the crossroads
But having all the answers
Never helped me out, no

Oh, but then a boom shake helps me awake
I need some coffee and maybe a shave
And it's a pretty bad way to start my today
Turn on the radio and what does he say

He says, "Hey yeah, welcome to the real world
Nobody told you it was gonna be hard"
You said, "Hey yeah I can't believe it
I barely started now I'm falling apart"

And the stars
They were shining through the window
You feel a little moon glow
Kind of like a rainbow

Oh, but then a boom shake, now I'm awake
I think it's over, but it's everyday
And it's a pretty fine mess I'm starting to make
I couldn't tell you I was never afraid

Sayin' "Hey yeah, welcome to the real world
Nobody told you it was gonna be hard"
You said, "Hey yeah I can't believe it
I barely started now I'm falling apart"
"Hey yeah, welcome to the real world
Nobody told you it was gonna be hard"
You said, "Hey yeah I can't believe it
I barely started now I'm falling apart"
