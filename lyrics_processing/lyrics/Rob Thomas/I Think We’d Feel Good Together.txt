Well I want to get to know you
What's your name?
And tell me what I'm gonna have to go through
Are you game?
To take a drive anywhere you want to
We'll leave these people behind
I don't know why I just imagine you're a good time
So you wanna get to know me?
Well then, hey
Well that's a start
I'll treat you like a picture
In a frame
A work of art
I think I want to paint you
And then I want to hang you
In my bedroom over my head

Hey, wait up baby
Well I really want to know you better
And maybe you can stay one night
Or stay forever
I think we'd feel good together

Say you wanna go to my place?
Well, okay
I'm kind of wild
Moving at a fast pace
Slow down baby
Have some wine, have a little champagne
We got no reason to rush
'Cause soon enough I'm gonna do some things that make you blush
Do you like a little music?
Marvin Gaye?
What's going on? I like the way you move it
When you sway
I like the way you bump and grind do you mind if I take a little more time
You're so fine but I can't believe you're mine even only tonight

Wait up baby
'Cause I only want to know you better
And maybe you can stay one night
Or stay forever
I think we'd feel good together

And in the morning when the sun comes up
You don't have to leave it's up to you
But I know that when I rise
I see that look in your eyes
I'll be thinking it's too good for only a night
Hey, hey, too good for only a night
Hey hey

Hey, wait up baby
Well I really want to know you better
And maybe you can stay one night
Or stay forever
I think we'd feel good together
Wait up baby
'Cause I only want to know you better
And maybe you can stay one night
Or stay forever
I think we'd feel good together
Yeah, oh yeah
And if you'd only want to stay one night or stay forever
