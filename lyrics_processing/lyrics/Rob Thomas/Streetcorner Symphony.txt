It's morning, I wake up
The taste of summer sweetness on my mind
It's a clear day in this city
Let's go dance under the street lights
All the people in this world, let's come together
More than ever
I can feel it
Can you feel it?

Come on over
A-down to the corner
My sisters and my brothers of every different color
Don't ya feel that sunshine tellin' you to hold tight
Things will be alright, tryna find a better life
Come on over
A-down to the corner
My sisters and my brothers there for one another
Won't ya (Come on over)
Man, I know you wanna let yourself go, oh

Some people, it's a pity
They go all their lives and never know
How to love or to let love go
But it's alright now
We'll make it through this somehow
And we'll paint the perfect picture
All the colors of this world will run together
More than ever
I can feel it
Can you feel it?
