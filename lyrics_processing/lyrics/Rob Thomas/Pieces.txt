Run away, run away if you can't speak
Turn a page on a world that you don't need
Wide awake and you're scared that you won't come down now

Didn't I tell you you were gonna break down
Didn't I warn you, didn't I warn you
Better take it easy, try to find a way out
Better start believing in yourself

We build it up, we tear it down
We leave our pieces on the ground
We see no end, we don't know how
We are lost and we're falling
Hold onto me
You're all I have, all I have
Hold onto me
You're all I have, all I have

Now and then there's a light in the darkness
Feel around till you find where your heart went
There's a weight in the air but you can't see why, why

Didn't I tell you you were gonna break down
Didn't I want you, everybody wants you
Tell me what you're needing, give into your bleeding
Never any feeling for yourself

We build it up, we tear it down
We leave our pieces on the ground
We see no end, we don't know how
We are lost and we're falling
Hold onto me
You're all I have, all I have
Hold onto me
You're all I have, all I have

Didn't I tell you you were gonna break down
Didn't I warn you, didn't I warn you
Better take it easy, try to find a way out
Better start believing in yourself

We build it up, we tear it down
We leave our pieces on the ground
We see no end, we don't know how
We are lost and we're falling
Hold onto me
You're all I have, all I have
Hold onto me
You're all I have, all I have
Can you hold onto me
Can you hold onto me
