Well I, I feel done wrong
Ain't been myself in far too long
I can't blame nobody, what I done wrong
Just blame myself and all is lost
From now on I will

I'm gonna wake up early in the morning
I'm blind but I'll raise my eyes to a new day dawning
Gonna raise my head when the sun comes up
And I won't lay down 'til the work's done
I'm gonna wake up early in the morning
I'm wise but there's still so much that I ain't been learning
Gonna raise my voice 'til I am heard
'Til the world rings out with my dying words, oh
I'm gonna wake up early in the morning

Don't wait, wait too long
Don't hide your feelings 'til the feeling's gone
'Cause when you suffer, pain makes you strong
And when you lose, you own that loss
From now on I know

That I'm gonna wake up early in the morning
I'm blind but I'll raise my eyes to a new day dawning
Gonna raise my head when the sun comes up
And I won't lay down 'til the work's done
I'm gonna wake up early in the morning
I'm wise but there's still so much that I ain't been learning
Gonna raise my voice 'til I am heard
'Til the world rings out with my dying words, oh
I'm gonna wake up early in the morning
I am, I'm gonna wake up early in the morning

And in the warmer light of day
I will resurrect my faith
And I'll scream out loud while demons that I chase
Strike me down without a warning
But I will win this morning

I'm gonna wake up early in the morning
I'm blind but I'll raise my eyes to a new day dawning
Gonna raise my head when the sun comes up
And I won't lay down 'til the work's done
I'm gonna wake up early in the morning
I'm wise but there's still so much that I ain't been learning
Gonna raise my voice 'til I am heard
'Til the world rings out with my dying words
And I'm gonna wake up early in the morning
