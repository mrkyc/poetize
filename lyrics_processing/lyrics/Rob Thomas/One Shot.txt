Everybody wanna get high again and play it all night long
Everybody get a little wild and then they turn and go back home
Well, I say "Why? Why?"
Everybody, let's turn it up again, I wanna hear that song
Then I'm gonna fly like Superman, feeling so far gone
So tonight, let's ride

We get one shot to get it right
We get one shot, so hold on tight
We get one shot, so let it ride
We get one shot to live your life
We get one shot to go all night
We get one shot, so let it ride

Everybody's got a little love to give, let's give it all we got
I don't wanna feel all weighted down, let's hit it while it's hot
And burning bright, bright
I know you know exactly what I mean
Too fast, too slow, there ain't no in-between
So tonight, let's ride

We get one shot to get it right
We get one shot, so hold on tight
We get one shot, so let it ride
We get one shot to live your life
We get one shot to go all night
We get one shot, so let it ride

I say we let it ride

I know everything could fall apart
We get one chance to make this kickstart
Turn on your light
Cause we are made of stars
And I wanna let it shine

Everybody gonna be alright, I feel it in my bones
If it takes all night, I'm bleeding water from this stone
So tonight, tonight
Let's ride

We get one shot to get it right
We get one shot, so hold on tight
We get one shot, so let it ride
We get one shot to live your life
We get one shot to go all night
We get one shot, so let it ride

I say we let it ride
