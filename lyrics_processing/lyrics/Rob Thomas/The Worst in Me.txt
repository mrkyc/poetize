When it's late, I'm a mess
You can tell, I can guess
There's a weight in your eyes
You and me, we're all out of lies

I said, it's alright
If you wanna fight now
'Cause I know we can go all night

Baby, wait a minute 'cause it's all I got
I was hanging on a moment that wouldn't stop
God damn, it's never easy, you know it's true
But the worst in me could bring out the best in you

Run away from it all
You can hide, I can stall
And I know that I'm wrong
But I can't stop now 'cause I'm too far gone

It's alright (It's alright)
If you wanna cry now (If you wanna cry now)
'Cause I don't wanna calm this down

Baby, wait a minute 'cause it's all I got
I was hanging on a moment that wouldn't stop
God damn, it's never easy, you know it's true
But the worst in me could bring out the best in you

Tear it away, a piece at a time
Hanging your head like you're losing a best friend
The stain on your heart in the shape of a name
Carved there by me
Take it all as it comes
Fight it out 'til it's done
All the weight and the blame
In the end, we're the same

Baby, wait a minute 'cause it's all I got
I was hanging on a moment that wouldn't stop
God damn, it's never easy, you know it's true
But the worst in me could bring out the best in you
Baby, wait a minute 'cause it's all I got (Baby, you)
I was hanging on a moment that wouldn't stop
(I could bring out the best in you)
God damn, it's never easy, you know it's true
