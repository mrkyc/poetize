When we were in love you were the damnedest thing
All uneven, I gave you everything
There's no reason, making me fall in line
But I fall in line, darling every time
You were floating, I was your satellite
I was drowning, you came and saved my life
Now you broke my heart, and it wasn't right
What you did to me, how do you sleep at night

All the things that you said
They all went to my head
And I don't know now
I don't know how to forget
What it is that I needed to get
And I don't know now
I don't know how to forget
I don't know how to forget

A hard luck story, you see it every day
Hearts get shattered, people are thrown away
Now we're crawling back and you know it's bad
When you can't stay home and you can't go back
I remember like it was yesterday
Hear you talking, seeing you walk away
Now I don't wanna give it up, give it up
But I don't know how to make it go away
I can't see the end

You wanna be loved by someone
Then love someone
In the face of all the world

All the things that you said
They all went to my head
And I don't know now
I don't know how to forget
What it is that I needed to get

I don't know how to forget
And I don't know how to forget (You wanna be loved by someone)
And I don't know how to forget (Then love someone)
