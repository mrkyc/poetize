Six a.m. backin' out of your drive
The sun's coming up so you pull that visor down
Morning news you spin your dial to the left
Then your heart does a backflip right outta your chest
It's me, and you'd know soon as you hear it
The frequency of a memory comin' in clear
And I know you don't hold on
But baby I still do
It's a long shot girl but I'm coming to you

From the other side of the radio
Turn me up I'll take you back down that road
I miss you like crazy
I'll never let you go
And the only way I can let you know is
From the other side of the radio

You remember Third Eye Blind and that Cracker Jack ring
Clothes hanging on the dogwood by that Mississippi spring
And anybody else who's listening won't know what I'm singing about
This is only for you baby, I'm pouring my heart out
Yeah I'm pouring my heart out
You might also like
From the other side of the radio
Turn me up I'll take you back down that road
I miss you like crazy
I'll never let you go
And the only way I can let you know is
From the other side of the radio

It's me
It's the last chance I have
To tell you that I'm sorry and how bad I want you bad
And I hope that I said something that brings you back to me someday
'Cause girl it gets so lonely here a million miles away on the

Other side of the radio
Turn me up I'll take you back down that road
I miss you like crazy
I'll never let you go
And the only way I can let you know is
From the other side of the radio
