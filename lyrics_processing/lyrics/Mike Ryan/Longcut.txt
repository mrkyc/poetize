I know every shortcut, every backroad in this town
Anywhere I wanna go, I know my way around
I can time it right, miss every light, get there and back in fifteen flat
When I'm on my way to pick you up, that's how I drive
When it's time to take you home at the end of the night

I'm gonna take my time, I ain't in no hurry
You don't wanna call it a night, and baby, don't you worry
We can pull on a one way and kick on the hazards
Wait on a train, follow a tractor
A whole lot of ways around here to get held up
If that sounds good to you, baby, you're in luck
'Cause I'm no longcut

There's a whole lot of letters we can fit between A and B
Dirt roads and detours that you ain't ever seen
If the moon is bright, we can kill the lights
Slow it down and get turned around
From here back to your place, it's a real short drive
Just as long as you're singing along with your pretty little hand in mine

I'm gonna take my time, I ain't in no hurry
You don't wanna call it a night, and baby, don't you worry
We can pull on a one way and kick on the hazards
Wait on a train, follow a tractor
A whole lot of ways around here to get held up
If that sounds good to you, baby, you're in luck
'Cause I'm no longcut

I can make ten miles take an hour or more
'Cause, girl, whenever we're together, I don't wanna cut it short

I'm gonna take my time, I ain't in no hurry
You don't wanna call it a night, well baby, don't you worry
We can pull on a one way and kick on the hazards
Wait on a train, follow a tractor
A whole lot of ways around here to get held up
If that sounds good to you, baby, you're in luck
'Cause I'm no longcut
