You could steal the keys too fast back forward
Ain't no one gonna stop you when you open the door
I'll let you have it, yeah it's like you're magic
You could hang around at the scene of the crime
With a red upon your hands no one's planning it out
Like they don't see it, oh can't believe it

You do what you wanna do, and all I want it is you

Take the heart out of my chest
Take the thoughts out of my head
Take me where you wanna
I don't wanna know the way back
I love the way that you could get away with
Taking my  off of my 
Shoot me down with just one kiss
I'd buy every single word that you say
You can get away, you can get away with anything

You could ask for silver, I give you gold
Take the jacket off my back and leave me out in the cold
With a smile on, yeah cause I'm feeling so strong
You might also like
You do what you wanna do, and all I want it is you

Take the heart out of my chest
Take the thoughts out of my head
Take me where you wanna
I don't wanna know the way back
Girl I love the way that you could get away with
Taking my  off of my 
Shoot me down with just one kiss
I'd buy every single word that you say
You can get away, you can get away with anything

You do what you wanna do, and all I want it is you

Take the heart out of my chest
Take the thoughts out of my head
Take me where you wanna
I don't wanna know the way back
I love the way that you could get away with
Taking my  off of my 
Shoot me down with just one kiss
I'd buy every single word that you say
