You don't have to panic girl i know just how to treat it
Let me see you back, back, back it up for me baby
Body fresh to death

When you work it so perfect i wanna cal you my habibi
I love it, 100, wanna hear you say inta-hayati
Never caught your name

Girl where you been all my life?
I got a pretty thing but you wife
And theres something about you in all black
I gotta feeling that you'd be my type (uh)
Uh i love to see a girl with some modesty
Take a chance why u scared, u ain't gotta be
Girl ur da only one i wanna holler at
All these other girls i see they jus wannabes
Locked in
Loved up
ROD (Ride Or Die)
But he fucked up
He talk game
But we live that
That oil money
We dig that
Yeh yeah yeah we out the box
Come in looking fresh when we on the spot
They wanna know whats next, they wanna know whats up?
So i, so i, so i upped the lev's
