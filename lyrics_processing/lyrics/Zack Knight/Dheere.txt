Dheere dheere se mere dil ko churaana (woah)
Tum se pyaar humein hai kitna
(And there's no other way for me to show you)
Tumse milkar, tumse milkar milkar (yeah)
I've never been the type for fall in love
But every time I see you, I'm alive
There's something in between us tonight (tonight)
And I know your probably sick and fed up
Of everybody wasting your time
So girl let me be your way out tonight
Jab se tujhe dekha
I get weak between the knees
Couldn't find the words to say
That I just wanna I just wanna love you now
Mere honthon pe
Baby can't you see, see it on my lips, got me crying out for your name
I just wanna love you now
Ban gaya hun main tera deewana (oh baby)
Dheere dheere se dil ko churaana (oh)
Tum se pyaar humein hai kitna
(And I don't know what it is about you girl)
Tum se milkar, tum se milkar milkar (woah)
Why you gotta fight what you feel?
When there's clearly a need I can see
So forget what you heard and let go tonight (oh babe)
It may not be right girl at first
But they don't need to know about us
Just go with your gut and just be who you wanna be
Jab se tujhe dekha
I get weak between the knees
Couldn't find the words to say
That I just wanna, I just wanna love you now
Mere honthon pe
Baby can't you see, see it on my lips, got me crying out for your name
I just wanna, I just wanna love you now
Aaja aaja ab kaisa sharmana (woah)
Dheere dheere se dil ko churaana
Tum se pyaar humein hai kitna
(And I don't know what it is about you)
Tumse milkar (oh baby), tumse milkar milkar (woah)
Tum se pyaar humein hai kitna
(Don't know what it is about you girl)
Tumse milkar (there's something about you), tumse milkar milkar (there's something about you)
Tum se pyaar humein hai kitna (oh)
Tumse milkar (there's something about you), tumse milkar milkar (there's something about you)
Tum se pyaar humein hai kitna
(Don't know what it is)
(Don't know what it is)
Tum se milkar (there's something about you), tum se milkar milkar
