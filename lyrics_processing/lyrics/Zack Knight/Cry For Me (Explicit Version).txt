I swear It's like I love to see you cry
Like I love to see them tears in those eyes
And every time I see you down
I get a little more torn inside
And I don't wanna see you get gone
'Cause you know you got that therapy
So as long as you know that
There's no other one
What you see is what you get with me, Baby
But I'm guilty, I'm guilty

So here we go again
Breaking your heart
For the Hundredth time
Here we go again
I'm making you pay
For another crime
I'm so addicted
To fucking with your feelings
That every time I see you cry, Baby

I love you little more inside
A little more, Little more inside
A little more, Little more inside
You might also like
You can call me insecure
But I'd rather tell the truth
Then tell lies
'Cause there's something about them
Tears like the rain falling from the night sky
'Cause when you're pulling that face
Baby I just wanna eat you up
So as long as you know that
I'm a little twisted
But you're the better half of me
So forgive me, forgive me

So here we go again
Breaking your heart
For the Hundredth time
Here I go again
I'm making you pay
For another crime
I'm so addicted
To fucking with your feelings
That every time I see you cry, Baby

I love you little more inside
She don't love me like she used to
That's how game go girl that's what I'm into
I messed around in the worst way
Shedding tears no candles on her birthday
So I spend my cake on her
But she that real chick
She want my time no dollars
Been tryna put my name on it
Don't wanna play, I know the game
I'm tryna change from it

So here we go again
Breaking your heart
For the Hundredth time
Here I go again
I'm making you pay
For another crime
I'm so addicted
To fucking with your feelings
That every time I see you cry, Baby

I love you little more inside
A little more, Little more inside
A little more, Little more inside
So Cry, Cry, Cry for me
