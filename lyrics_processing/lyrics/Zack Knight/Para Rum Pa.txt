Your mamma from the Bay of Bengal
But she a baddie from the East (baddie from the East)
She want that Para Rum Pa
You know she wanna get a piece (know she wanna piece)

Caramel skin, yeah she Bengali
Body so thick
Like a new Bugatti
Be my new ting
You ain't gotta worry, do you dirty
Always trustworthy

Like a criminal
When I call her she say balah ah see

Khota bolo tumhi Bala ni

Para Rum Pa

She got that extra P
She tryna rescue me
When she pull up in the ends in the SUV
She got these diamonds on her wrist
But she came from the bottom
Baby make a wish
Like a genie in a bottle
I wanna keep the talk to the minimal
Dance in traditional
If she want that vitamin D, I got the minerals
If you wanna go with the combo
Then imma give you extra cheeeeese
