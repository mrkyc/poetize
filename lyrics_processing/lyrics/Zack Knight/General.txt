You want me to get up on it girl
Come through cause you know you want it girl
She is a get up and go girl in uniform
She be putting in work all the time
Like an Indian dancer, she dip it low
And I really gotta make her mind

Jaaniya pyaar jo kiya to nibhana
Meri nazron se yoon door naa jaana tu
The way she come through like a general
So lay it all (me and let it go)

Runnin', Runnin like a General
Runnin', Runnin like a General
Runnin', Runnin like a General
Runnin', Runnin like a General

Tere tikhey-tikhey nain nasheeley
Kar dita jadoo
Tera aagey peechhey phirda waan main
Meri ban ja tu
She is a get up and go girl in uniform

Through through through
Bet up on her sleep she a corporal
Order when she control like
A general with an arrow up
Her sleeve like she a copper
The way she move up in the
Room like she professional
Floating by the side she got credential
The way she come through like a general
The way she come through
Through through through
Bet up on her sleep she a corporal
The way she come through
Through through through
Toone kya kiya hai mere dil ko sohniye
Dekhoon bas tujhko
Tere bin naa jee karda
Tu meri tamannah tu hi meri aarzoo
Dekhoon bas tujhko tere bin naa jee karda
