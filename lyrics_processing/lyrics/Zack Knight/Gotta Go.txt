Have you been playing me for long
With all these pictures all in your phone
Like I would never ever know (Oh-oh)

Cause you've been running your mouth all morning like I'm the only one you love, stop lying
I know you've been on your phone all night, all night
So don't you ever ever say you're sorry, when you know that you had me fooled, stop crying
It's all words, you can't change my mind, my mind

Now you're running all over the floor
How could you do this to me on my birthday
While you up in the club bailamos (Oh-oh-oh)
So, take your shit, girl, and get out my door
I hope you find what it is you've been searching
Cause you gotta go

Tainu main yaad rakhanga
Bhull ja mainu
Tod'ta dil tu mera sohniye kyun
Ni tu nave nave yaar bana le
Tode kasma te vaade tu
Saanu chhadna si je aasmaan ke
Dil sadde naal laaiya kyun
Je tu kardi wafa
Eh ni mildi saza
Mainu laande si tu laare
Ni tu akh na milaavi
Ni bahaane kaahton laavi
Jhoothe si tere kaare

(Gotta go)
(gotta go)

Cause you got me so faded, so faded
So tell me how many was it
Tell me was it really worth it in the end
In the end

Now you're running all over the floor
How could you do this to me on my birthday
While you up in the club bailamos (Oh-oh-oh)
So, take your shit, girl, and get out my door
I hope you find what it is you've been searching
