Nobody tells you, you end up knowin' (Knowin')

'Cause you're the voice of experience, every word you choose (Every word you choose)
Sweet stolen info you must never lose
You're so secure in your habitat familiar
(You feel it, you feel so secure)

But you won't want from me
(You never want, no, nothin', never, yeah)
There's nothin' else to see
(And you should know somethin')
Try smokin' your own and don't look at me
(I'm lookin', I'm lookin', singin', singin' it, singin' it)

No need to explain it, just order dresses
Bad habits (You keep) you shouldn't keep
(Don't sleep there)
Quick nip next door to the, the vendor of charisma
(No need to explain it, nip next door to the vendor of charisma)
Because the, the time, the place, and the, the mood is right
And good old Kevin'll be all right (Kevin's gonna be alright)
(Ooh) Here comes "His Soul" get your pen and notebooks ready

(Get your pen and notebooks ready)
