I've been thinking about my life
I know that, some things I did, they just don't seem right, and
I didn't know what I know today
I am a different person in every way

Times have changed, and I've changed too
To tell you the truth, I needed to
If I had known what I know today
I wouldn't need to be here and trying to say

I was brought up to believe, all of this bullshit
Women were repressed, everyone was a mess
Men didn't know what the fuck to do
So we controlled, we bullied, and we blamed it all on you

And now I'm seeing there's another way and this not the way to be
To be (that's right)
No one told me any of this. I was blind but now I see (Yeah)
Now this is the only way - the way it has to be (that's right)
Women have been put down for too long and it's down to you and me

We didn't even know, what the fuck we had (I know)
We shot ourselves in the foot, when we tried to make them feel bad
What we needed was to honour them, try and make them feel good
Instead we just put them down every time we could

And I'm a sorry man today and I know I was the worst (alright)
I took out my frustrations on them and them devalued all their worth (I know)
It was fear, fear, nothing but fear
I knew they were more powerful than me
But I couldn't hold that dear

So now you know
So now you know
So now you know

I was afraid of their sexuality, the feminine divine
So fucking powerful is their sexual desire
Now I watch her express it, right in front of me
It's such an honour, such a thrill, to see her love someone that's not me

Cos women are the superstars, the goddesses on earth
They need to be cherished, worshiped, adored!
It's not for them to do things for us
We got it the wrong way round
We should be serving them, for all we're worth. Yes!

So now you know
I really do
So now you know
I really do
So now you know
I really do
I'm sorry
You should be
So now you know
So now you know
So now you know

I really do
So now you know
So now you know
I really do
