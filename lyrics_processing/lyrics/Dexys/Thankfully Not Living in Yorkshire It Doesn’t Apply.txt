I'd like to dig it out, or maybe wrench it out
No touching, but there's not much involved
In casting doubt, too hard to think about
We'll be ready to move
But I'm not that stupid to put my faith in you
(Opportunity knocks)
(Ooh-ooh, ah-ah) Ooh
(Ooh-ooh, ah-ah) No searching anymore
(Ooh-ooh, ah-ah) Oh-ooh
Lord have mercy on me, keep me away from Leeds
I've been before, it's not what I'm looking for
No touching, but there's not much involved
In casting doubt, no need to think about
We'll be ready to move
But I'm not that stupid to put my faith in you
(Opportunity knocks)
(Ooh-ooh, ah-ah) No longer searching, searching
(Ooh-ooh, ah-ah) No looking anymore
(Ooh-ooh, ah-ah) Oh-ooh
I've walked around, seen the town and the crowds
With their frowns on their faces
And occassional traces of doubt
I've walked about, worked it out, pissed about
Tried to shout, no one's listening
It's all you and your rules and fools and
It's all you in schools they'll, tools they'll
Cut, cut

I've been before, it's not what I'm looking for
No touching, but there's not much involved
In casting doubt, no need to think about
I'd relate my thoughts to you
But I'm not so stupid to put my faith in you
