Poor old Johnny Ray
Sounded sad upon the radio
Moved a million hearts in mono
Our mothers cried
Sang along, who'd blame them
You're grown (you're grown up), so grown (so grown up)
Now I must say more than ever (come on, Eileen)
Toora, loora, toora, loo-rye-aye
And we can sing just like our fathers
Come on, Eileen
Oh, I swear (well, he means)
At this moment
You mean everything (everything)
You in that dress
My thoughts, I confess
Verge on dirty
Ah, come on, Eileen
Come on, Eileen
These people 'round here
Were beaten down, eyes sunk in smoke-dried face
They're resigned to what their fate is
But not us (no, never)
No, not us (no, never)
We are far too young and clever (remember)
Toora, loora, toora, loo-rye-aye
Eileen, I'll hum this tune forever

Oh, I swear (well, he means)
Ah, come on, let's
Take off everything
Pretty red dress
Eileen, tell him yes
Ah, come on, let's
Ah, come on, Eileen
Please
(Come on, Eileen, ta-loo-rye-aye)
(Come on, Eileen, ta-loo-rye-aye)
Now you are grown, now you have shown (toora, toora, ta-loora)
Oh, ah, Eileen, said
Come on, Eileen
These things, they are real (come on, Eileen, ta-loo-rye-aye)
And I know how you feel (come on, Eileen, ta-loo-rye-aye)
Now I must say, more than ever (toora, toora, ta-loora)
Things 'round here have changed, I said
Toora, loora, toora, loo-rye-aye (come on, Eileen, ta-loo-rye-aye)
(Come on, Eileen, ta-loo-rye-aye, toora, toora, ta-loora)
Come on, Eileen
Oh, I swear (well, he means)

Ah, come on, Eileen
Come on, Eileen
Oh, I swear (well, he means)
At this moment
You mean everything (everything)
You in that dress
