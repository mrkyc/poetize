I won't need to think of nice things to say
I don't want to want this way anymore
Shh now, hear comes silence
From this comes strength, I promise
This is it, soon, I won't care
No need for pain
Nothing physical, no violence
Just intense thought
Some space, some silence
Just something pure
And precious worth having
Soon, I won't care
Take this ridiculous mood all away
Give me something new I could say
Give me no more time to look like this
I'll never ask again, I promise


You've always been searching for somethin'
Which always seems to be so-so
It was so
Tightly close your eyes
Hold out your hand, we'll make a stand
Forget their plans and their demands

Plan B
They're testin' you, don't worry (Plan B)
This week, I'm strong enough for two
(Stop, stop, stop) I'm comin', comin'
(Stop, stop, stop) I'm runnin'
(Stop, stop, stop) I'm burnin'
(Stop, stop, stop) Wouldn't sell you anything

Well, it starts off just jokin'
I mean, just jokin'
And then they stop talkin' to you
Believe me, that's the worst thing of all
The worst thing of all

Whispers more than loud enough
Try to
Make you feel not good enough
Try this, like this
Don't believe your eyes
Hold out your hand, we'll make a stand
Forget their plans and their demands

Comin', comin', I'm a comin', I'm a, I'm a
