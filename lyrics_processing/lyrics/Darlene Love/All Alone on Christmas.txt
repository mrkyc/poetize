The cold wind is blowin' and the streets are getting dark
I'm writing you a letter and I don't know where to start
The bells will be ringin' Saint John the Divine
I get a little lonely every year around this time
The music plays all night in Little Italy
The lights will be going up on old Rockefeller tree
People window shopping on Fifth Avenue
All I want for Christmas is you

I've gotta know (Nobody oughta be all alone on Christmas)
Where do the lonely hearts go? (Nobody oughta be all alone on Christmas)
Oh, 'cause nobody oughta be all alone on Christmas

Things are different since you've been here last
Childhood dreaming is a thing of the past
Maybe you can bring us some hope this year
Visions of sugar plums have disappeared
Do you remember sleigh riding in the snow?
And dancing all night to "Baby, Please Come Home"?
Today's celebration is bittersweet
There's mothers and children in the street

I wanna know (Nobody oughta be all alone on Christmas)
Where do lonely hearts go? (Nobody oughta be all alone on Christmas)
'Oh, 'cause nobody oughta be all alone on Christmas
You might also like
I'm all grown up but I'm the same, you'll see
I'm writing you this letter 'cause I still believe
Dear Santa, I've been good this year
Can't you stay a little while with me right here?
Oh, oh, I've got to know

Tell me, I've gotta know (Nobody oughta be alone on Christmas)
Where do lonely hearts go? (Nobody oughta be alone on Christmas)
Because nobody oughta be all alone on Christmas
Oh, nobody oughta be all alone on Christmas
Oh, nobody oughta be

Oh yeah, on Christmas (Nobody oughta be alone on Christmas)
All alone on Christmas (Nobody oughta be alone on Christmas)
Tell me, I've gotta know (Nobody oughta be alone on Christmas)
Don't leave me alone (Nobody oughta be alone on Christmas)
All alone on Christmas (Nobody oughta be alone on Christmas)
Tell me, I've gotta know (Nobody oughta be alone on Christmas)
Where do they all go? (Nobody oughta be alone on Christmas)
Where do lonely hearts go? (Nobody oughta be alone on Christmas)
I've gotta know (Nobody oughta be alone on Christmas)
Nobody oughta be alone (Nobody oughta be alone on Christmas)
