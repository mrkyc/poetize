All I knew about love
Was how to live without it
All I knew about trust
Was how to doubt it
Lovin' me was like trying to be
A fire in the rain
I've been burned too many times
To relight that flame

Those days are gone, you took me on
'Til I could not deny you
You broke the spell, you cracked my shell
And let your lovin' shine through
You stood your ground, you wore me down
'Til my resistance got low
Then you stepped in, ever since then
I've never been the same

Empty hearts just like mine
Was all that life allowed me
Casual plays, one night stands
Never did arouse me
You might also likeLove would fly, but it just wouldn't stop
Like a speeding train
I never heard "All Aboard"
It was just a shame

Those days are gone, you took me on
'Til I could not deny you
You broke the spell, you cracked my shell
And let your lovin' shine through
You stood your ground, you wore me down
'Til my resistance got low
Then you stepped in, ever since then
I've never been the same
And I've never ever been the same
No

And I really love you baby
Yes I do
(I really love you)
And I don't know what I did
To have met you
Oh-oh
Oh, yeah
Those days are gone, you took me on
'Til I could not deny you
You broke the spell, you cracked my shell
And let your lovin' shine through
You stood your ground, you wore me down
'Til my resistance got low
Then you stepped in, and ever since then
I've never been the same

(Those days are gone)
Those days, those days are gone
Yeah, yeah
(You broke the spell, you cracked my shell)
You broke the spell
(And let your lovin' shine through)
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
(You stood your ground)
