I always dreamed the man I loved would come along
And he'd be tall and handsome, big  and strong
Now that man I love has come to me
But sure ain't the way I thought he'd be

He doesn't look like a movie star
He doesn't drive a Cadillac car
He sure ain't the man I've been dreamin' of, but
He's sure the man I love

He'll never be a big businessman
He buys on the installment plan
He sure ain't the man I've been dreamin' of, but
He's sure the man I love

When he holds me tight
Everything's right, crazy as it seems
I'm his, whatever he is
And I forget all of my dreams

Everybody knows
He'll never hang diamonds around my neck
'Cause all he's got is unemployment checks
He sure ain't the man I've been dreamin' of, but
He's sure the man I love
Oh yeah

He sure ain't the man I've been dreamin' of, but
He's sure the man I love

Whoa-oh-oh, yeah
He's sure the man I love
Whoa-oh-oh
He's sure the man I

Every day of my life

He's the man, he's the man, yeah, yeah

He's sure the man I love
