I must have been about three or four
You were the cute little boy next door
Anyone could see in my little girl eyes
That you were the guy that I idolized
My favorite doll once broke in two
Of course I came crying to you
I didn't know just what to do
You fixed it up just as good as new
But you've been gone such a long, long time
How you gonna fix this broken heart of mine?
Mr. Fix-it, oh yeah (oh, yeah)
Mr. Fix-it (Mr. Fix-it)
How you gonna fix this broken heart of mine?
Years went by and I was your girl
The happiest one in the whole wide world
Most of your money went to buy
Anything my little heart desired
Remember the night we took a ride
A hideaway on Moonlight Drive
The car broke down, I thought we were through
You fixed it up just as good as new
But you've been gone such a long, long time
How you gonna fix this broken heart of mine?
Mr. Fix-it, oh yeah, (oh, yeah)
Mr. Fix-it (Mr. Fix-it)
How you gonna fix this broken heart of mine?
You always took care of everything
One day you gave me a wedding ring
Yes, we got married and we settled down
Bought a big old house on the wrong side of town
At last we had a home to share
The roof was leaking, we didn't care
We were so happy, just me and you
You fixed it up just as good as new
But you've been gone such a long, long time
How you gonna fix this broken heart of mine?
Mr. Fix-it
How you gonna fix this, how you gonna fix this
Oh, yeah, Mr. Fix-it
Oh yeah (oh, yeah)
Mr. Fix-it (Mr. Fix-it)
Oh yeah (oh, yeah)
Mr. Fix-it (Mr. Fix-it)
Oh yeah (oh, yeah)
Mr. Fix-it (Mr. Fix-it)
How you gonna fix this
