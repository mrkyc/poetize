Somebody told me
Somebody told me
Somebody told me
Something about you

I didn't believe it
I just couldn't believe it
I'm still reeling
'Cause I just can't take the blow

Well there's laughter and love
And there's a lot of pain
I never wanna see your
Pretty face again
Well there's laughter and love
And there's a lot of pain
I never wanna see your
Pretty face again

I'm full of forgiveness
You're just twisted
I'm a silly little saint
With a halo of smiles
And it makes no difference
You might also like
Well there's laughter and love
And there's a lot of pain
I never wanna see your
Pretty face again
Well there's laughter and love
And there's a lot of pain
I never wanna see your
Pretty face again

Oh well, oh well, oh well, oh well
Oh well, oh well, oh well, oh well
Oh Well (oh Well!), oh well (oh Well!), oh well (oh Well!), oh well
