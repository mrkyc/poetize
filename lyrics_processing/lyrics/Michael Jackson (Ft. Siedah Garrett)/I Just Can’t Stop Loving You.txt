Each time the wind blows
I hear your voice so I call your name
Whispers at morning, our love is dawning
Heaven's glad you came
You know how I feel, this thing can't go wrong
I'm so proud to say I love you
Your love's got me high, I long to get by
This time is forever, love is the answer
I hear your voice now
You are my choice now, the love you bring
Heaven's in my heart
At your call, I hear harps and angels sing
You know how I feel, this thing can't go wrong
I can't live my life without you
I just can't hold on, I feel we belong
My life ain't worth living if I can't be with you

I just can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you
And if I stop
Then tell me just what will I do
'Cause I just can't stop loving you

At night when the stars shine
I pray in you I'll find a love so true (Mmm)
When morning awakes me, will you come and take me?
I'll wait for you
You know how I feel (Ah), I won't stop until
I hear your voice saying, "I do" (I do)
This thing can't go wrong, this feeling's so strong
Well, my life ain't worth living if I can't be with you

I just can't stop loving you (Woah-oh)
I just can't stop loving you (If I stop)
And if I stop (Uh-huh)
Then tell me just what will I do (Woah-oh)
I just can't stop loving you

We can change all the world tomorrow
We can sing songs of yesterday
I can say, "Hey, farewell" to sorrow
This is my life and I want to see you for always

I just can't stop loving you (No, baby, oh)
I just can't stop loving you (If I can't stop)
And if I stop (Oh, oh)
Then tell me just what will I do (Oh, oh, what will I do?)
I just can't stop loving you (Hee-hee-hee, love you, girl)
I just can't stop loving you (I know I do)
And if I stop (Oh, oh, oh)
