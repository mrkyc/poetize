Oh, no, babe
Yeah-yeah
Baby, you
Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
Yeah

If you leave this time, I fear that you'll be gone for good, so
And I hold on like leaves in fall to what is left
Said her father left her young and he said he'll be back
With that same tone that you just said you'll stay forever with

Ooh
It seems that all the autumn leaves are fallin'
Ooh-ooh-ooh
I feel like you're the only reason for it
Ooh
All the things you do, all the things you do, all the things you do
Ooh-ooh-ooh
All the things you do, all the things you do, all the things you do
Ooh
It seems that you're the only reason for it

I've been bleedin' in your silence, I feel safer in your violence
I hold on like leaves in fall to what is left
Before I sleep, I talk to God, he must be mad with me, it's karma
I'm confused who I'll spend my forever with, oh-oh-oh

Ooh
It seems that all the autumn leaves are fallin'
Ooh-ooh-ooh
I feel like you're the only reason for it
Ooh
All the things you do, all the things you do, all the things you do
Ooh-ooh-ooh
All the things you do, all the things you do, all the things you do

So the iceberg never broke
And I poked at it, and I poked at it, and I poked at it, and I poked (And I poked)
And I poked at it, but it stayed stagnant
Then I poked at it some more (Some more)
And in my notepad, man, I wrote (Man, I wrote)
If I don't have it, if I don't grab it
If it don't chip, then a toe tag is one last, I'ma hope (I'ma hope)
So iceberg, don't float (Don't float)
If I do manage to do damage to you, dammit
It'll be grand as ten Grammies on my granite
Still standin' with a note (With a note)
That read, ''Granted, don't you panic''
When you make mistakes the most (The most)
One day, it'll make you grow (You grow)
When you outlandish and you lose manners
To God, you shall consult (Consult)
When the bright cameras are still crammin' in your face
And it provoke (Provoke)
You to act mannish, just stay planted
'Cause you reapin' what you sow
Keep (Keep) positivity in your heart and (And)
Keep a noose from 'round your throat and (And)
When you get mad, and when you poke at it
When you poke it at, just note, man
The iceberg is a reflection of you when you renew your vision
Just think, if it had sunk Titanic
The fuck it would do to a critic, my nigga?
(Ooh-ooh)
Yeah, yeah
Tell me, when thugs cry, do you hear 'em, Lord?
(Ooh-ooh)
Do you hear 'em, Lord? Do you hear 'em?
And if my ship go down, tell me, who will abort?
And they won't let me live, even with remorse that I give
When they gon' rejoice and forgive, tell me how I stay positive
(Ooh-ooh)
When they never see good in me
Even though I got hood in me
Don't mean he won't redeem me, Lord
It seems that all the autumn leaves are fallin'
Ooh-ooh-ooh
I feel like you're the only reason for it
Ooh
All the things you do, all the things you do, all the things you do
Ooh-ooh-ooh
All the things you do, all the things you do, all the things you do
Ooh

Ooh-ooh
