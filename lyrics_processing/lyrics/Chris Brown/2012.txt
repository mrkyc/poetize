Faire l'amour lendemain

What if the sky was turnin' red?
I know we'd be safe right here in my bed, layin' face to face
Oh, girl, I love the way you sound when you rain on me
So tonight let's act it out, show you how it's gon' be
I'm gon' kiss your other set of lips
Hold your body by your legs and hips
The world can't end until we're finished (Ooh, we gon')
Girl, we gon'

And we gon' do it like it's 'bout to be the end of the world
And they depended on us
To make Earth-shakin' love
As we lay down, lay down
Tellin' me to go harder, go harder
You're tellin' me to go deeper, go deeper
I feel your knees gettin' weaker and weaker
We can go longer if you just lay down, lay down, down

All these vibrations from your legs, massagin' my back
I got your body shiverin' 'cause we're covered in sweat
And girl, I like the way it opens up when you throw it back, baby
Girl, it might be too much, oh, baby, if you keep doin' that
I got that pillow for your knees right here
Baby, can you make it disappear?
Your voice is the last thing I'm gonna hear
Then I wanna make you holler

We gon' do it like it's 'bout to be the end of the world
And they depended on us
To make Earth-shakin' love
As we lay down, lay down
And you're, you're tellin' me to go harder, go harder
You're tellin' me to go deeper, go deeper
I feel your knees gettin' weaker and weaker
We can go longer as we lay down, lay down, down

Do it like we only got one (Got one, girl)
Baby, let's pretend we only got one night
One last time (Ah), let me take my time (Ah)
And do it to you right
Buildings and bridges may be fallin' down
But that won't stop me from turnin' that thing around, girl, yeah
Won't you come on over
And we can treat it like it's the motherfuckin'

End of the world? (Woo!)
And they depended on us (And they depended on us to make it)
To make Earth-shakin' love (Love)
As we lay down, lay down (We can, we can)
Tellin' me to go harder, go harder
(A nigga goin' hard in the paint, you think I can't)
You're tellin' me to go deeper, go deeper
(A nigga so deep, underwater, can you feel my submarine?)
I feel your knees gettin' weaker and weaker
(I'll use my hands, and baby, you gon' get this rain)
We can go longer if you just lay down (Lay down), lay down, down (Lay down)
A nigga goin' hard in the paint (Lay it down), you think I can't?
Watch a nigga go hard in the paint (Lay it down), you think I can't?
(Lay, lay, lay down)
Goin' for miles, no stops (Lay it down)
(So good, lay down)
A nigga goin' hard in the paint (Right now)
Watch a nigga go hard in the paint (Just take that)
Watch a nigga go hard in the paint (Lay it down), you think I can't? (Get it, get it)
Watch a nigga go hard in the paint (Lay it down), you think I can't? (Get it, get it)
Watch a nigga go hard in the paint (Lay it down)
(Get it, lay down)
