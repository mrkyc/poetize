If you're only as good as the company you keep
Then I'ma blame you for what they say about me
(Free your mind, let your conscience be free)
When I was by myself, I was fast asleep
Since you came around, I've been up for weeks
(Free your mind, let your conscience be free)
Yi-Yi-Yikes, I've been with the wrong crowd
I can make you a believer if I turn the nonsense down
I keep my secrets in a safehouse (A safehouse)
Better if I don't speak (Don't speak)
Devil's tryna tempt me
They just outline my shape out (Shape out)
Place me at the crime scene (Crime scene)
I can see from this high up
You ain't got a heart, girl (You ain't got a heart, girl)
Privacy is for the cheater
Obviously, you're deceivin'

I know, I know just who you are
You put me on layaway
You just love to heart shop, oh, girl
I think that it's over
I think that it's over
