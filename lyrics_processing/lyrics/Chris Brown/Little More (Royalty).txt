Wake me up before you go
Ooh, I need a little more, just a little more
A little more of your love, oh
Wake me up before you go
Ooh, I need a little more, just a little more
A little more of your love

Oh, I need a jumpstart
When you call me, I'm runnin' to ya
Gimme a headstart
Thank God, gonna have me like hallelujah
Even though I'm a man, girl, you're makin' me feel like a baby
Ooh, girl, when you lay in my arms
I'll take advantage of the moment
Girl, the way you make me smile is the definition of a real lady

So before I go to work, can I ask you for a favor?

Wake me up before you go
Ooh, I need a little more, just a little more
A little more of your love
Wake me up before you go
Ooh, I need a little more, just a little more
A little more of your love

Woah, I need a back talk
Girl, I'm your daddy, no sass talk
Oh, baby girl, you inspire me
Give me the reason to keep on
My baby, my Royalty
Girl, you're the lyrics to my song
Girl, you got this heart lock on me
I don't think I can control it
I hold on with all my might while you look at me in my eye
Like a vitamin, you put back my energy
You're makin' me stronger
You bring out the best of me

So before I go to work, can I ask you a favor?
