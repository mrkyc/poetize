I don't wanna go there
We should never go there
Damn, why you wanna go there?
I guess I gotta go there

You're hearin' rumors about me and you can't stomach the thought
Of someone touchin' my body when you're so close to my heart
I won't deny what they're sayin' because most of it is true
But it was all before I fell for you, so please, babe

So please don't judge me, and I won't judge you
'Cause it could get ugly before it gets beautiful
Please don't judge me, and I won't judge you
And if you love me, then let it be beautiful

(Oh)
Let it be beautifu-u-ul (Oh)
Let it be beautiful (Oh)
Let it be beautifu-u-ul (Oh)
Let it be beautiful

Everythin' I say right now is gonna be used in another fight
And I've been through this so many times
Can we change the subject?
You gonna start askin' me questions like
"Was she attractive? Was she an actress?"
Baby, the fact is
See Chris Brown LiveGet tickets as low as $60You might also like
You're hearin' rumors about me and saw some pictures online
Sayin' they got you so angry, makin' you wish you were blind
Before we start talkin' crazy, sayin' some things we'll regret
Can we just slow it down and press reset? (Damn)
You're beautiful

(So baby)
So please don't judge me, and I won't judge you
'Cause it could get ugly before it gets beautiful
Please don't judge me, and I won't judge you
And if you love me, then let it be beautiful

Just let the past just be the past
And focus on things that are gonna make us laugh
Take me as I am (Take me as I am)
And not who I was (Not who I was)
I'll promise I'll be the one that you can trust, so please

So please don't judge me (Don't judge me)
And I won't judge you (And I won't 'cause)
'Cause it could get ugly before it gets beautiful
So please don't judge me (Please don't)
And I won't judge you (No, I won't)
And if you love me (If you love me)
Then let it be beautiful, babe
Let it be beautifu-u-ul (Oh, ooh)
Let it be beautiful (Let it)
Let it be, oh
Let it be beautiful, ayy

Yeah, yeah, yeah
