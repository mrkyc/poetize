You say all you need is consistent love
When I try, I swear it's never enough, I messed up
Maybe this thing here just ain't meant for us
Baby, you let go and I pull you back
I let go, you ain't havin' that

We do it like rock stars (Oh)
Sexin' in my hotel room and we so loud
Higher than a smoke cloud (Oh)
Shades on, doin' ninety-five with the top down
I might sound crazy (Oh)
'Cause we be goin' back and forth
One minute I hate you, then I love you
That's how it is

'Til we get it right, we gon' fuck some more
