Said I'm all up in my feelings, doubled up on this shot
Got me feelin' some type of way
Told you I hate you, I don't mean it
And the only thing that I got
Is the pain that you've been feedin'
Faded, faded, faded, all because of you
Now my current situation
Tryin' not to think of you, not to break the rules
Why it always happens when I get this way?
Just can't stop myself

So, baby, tonight
I'm blowin' up your line
I got you on my mind
And the truth is hard to fight
So I'll be

I'll be drunk textin', drunk textin', drunk textin' you
Drunk textin', drunk textin' you
Yeah, baby, I'll be drunk textin', drunk textin', drunk textin' you
Drunk textin', drunk textin' you

Drunk textin' you
Drunk textin' you
Drunk textin' you
Drunk textin' you

I'm lookin' at my phone thinkin'
"Am I gonna hit send or nah?"
It's gonna be one of them mornings when I wake up and regret it
If I don't get no reply
I don't wanna make it obvious that I'm faded, faded, faded off a drink or two
And you know how it goes, this ain't nothin' new
Why's it always happen when I get this way?
No, I just can't stop myself

So, baby, tonight (Tonight, yeah)
I'm blowin' up your line (Oh yeah)
I got you on my mind
And the truth is hard to fight
So I'll be (I'll be)

I'll be drunk textin', drunk textin', drunk textin' you (Hey)
Drunk textin', drunk textin' you
Yeah, baby, I'll be drunk textin', drunk textin', drunk textin' you (Girl, I'm drunk textin')
Drunk textin', drunk textin' you (Oh-oh)

Intoxicated, intoxicated
That's when I think of you the most
But after the toast, anything goes
When I put my pride aside
I'll be doin' the most, doin' the most
I done spent 1, 2, 3 A.M., thinkin' about you
Don't wanna be without you
'cause I'm on that liquid courage
I hope this shit is worth it
'cause if it ain't then it's all bad, all bad
So, baby, tonight
I'm blowin' up your line (I'm blowin' up your phone)
I got you on my mind (Woah-oh)
And the truth is hard to fight (Yeah)
So I'll be (I'll be)

I'll be drunk textin', drunk textin', drunk textin' you (Ooh-ooh)
Drunk textin', drunk textin' you
Yeah, baby, I'll be drunk textin', drunk textin', drunk textin' you ('Cause I'm fucked up right now)
Drunk textin', drunk textin' you

If by chance you're layin' next to someone else right now
Girl, I
