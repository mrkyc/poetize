She was a looker from Atlanta; led the choir; played piano; had a body that was made for sin
She didn't care he was married 'cause the torch that she carried was hotter than the fires of Hell
She had plans to seduce him, and she knew she would loosen a notch in the Bible Belt
So she called him up at home when she knew he'd be alone, said, "Preacher, I could use advice."
"I got troubles with the Man that I know you'll understand. If you could help me it would sure be nice."
They met a few minutes after in the office of the pastor, and she started telling how she felt
What a chance they were takin' when they first started breakin' the law from the Bible Belt
There's a lot of good people who were led astray that believe what the Good Book said
Well, I'll tell you something, brother, when you're dealin' with the Devil it's tough to keep a level head
And, it's hard to imagine how the flames of passion will burn 'til your soul will melt
And it'll spread like a cancer 'cause you're gonna have to answer to the Lord in the Bible Belt
Someone said they went to Vegas. Back home it didn't take us long to hear the news of what they did
I just can't believe that he left his wife to grieve alone with two pre-school kids
I don't know how they're doin', but I know that they're screwin' up a good thing they once had
They better get their heads together or they're gonna slap leather with the Lord in the Bible Belt
