Well I'm swimmin' in debt
And the money's all gone
I ain't got nothin' I can call my own
Work my fingers to the blood and bone
For a big disappointment when my paycheck comes

If I only had a little I could do just fine
I could put a down payment on some peace of mind
But I'm hangin' at the end of a credit line
Lord I'm just livin' on borrowed time

My truck's financed through the union bank
But I don't have enough to even fill the tank
I'd take you for a drive girl but I just can't
'Cause the damned old motor won't even crank

Our trailer's plenty big if we lived outside
But I can't swing the payments on a double wide
You better hold a place in that welfare line
'Cause I'm just livin' on borrowed time

Well if it comes real cheap but it don't come free
Then it stays off limits to a guy like me
They say it brings trouble havin' money to burn
I reckon that's a lesson I won't have to learn

Well if it comes real cheap but it don't come free

Yeah I bought my wife a little diamond ring
Her mom said, "Hon, can't even see that thing"
It'll be paid off when I'm sixty-five
If I'm lucky enough to still be alive

Even if I was to up and pass away
My family doesn't have enough to dig my grave
No tombstone just an old wood sign
Sayin' 'he was just livin' on borrowed time'

I'm out there swingin' from a credit line
Lord I'm just livin' on borrowed time
