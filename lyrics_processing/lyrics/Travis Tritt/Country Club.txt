I took a double take out on the interstate
When I saw her making eyes at me
So I followed her down to Clubhouse Drive
Past the pool and the eighteenth green
And in the parking lot I said it's mighty hot
Maybe I could buy you a beer
She said I'm glad you asked, but I'll have to pass
'Cause only members are allowed in here (and I said)

I'm a member of a country club
Country music is what I love
I drive an old Ford pick-up truck
I do my drinking from a Dixie cup
Hey I'm a bona-fide dancing fool
I shoot a mighty mean game of pool
At any honky tonk or roadside pub
I'm a member of a country club

Lord, you look so inviting, thought it might be exciting
For a woman with a limousine
To go bouncing around in a beat-up truck
With a man in wore-out jeans
Yeah, it's five o'clock before Friday night
And here's where the fun begins
So don't worry 'bout your reputation
'Cause you can tell all your friends
