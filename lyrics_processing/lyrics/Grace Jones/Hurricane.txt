See me, here I come
Can't see where I run
No matter how far
Still, here you are
I am woman, I am sun
I can give birth to she
I can give birth to son

And I can be cool
Soft as a breeze
Soft as a breeze
From the cradle to the grave
And I'll be a hurricane
Ripping up trees

See me, here I come
Can't see where I run
No matter how far
Still, here you are (From the cradle to the grave)

And you keep taking
And you keep on taking
My head should be aching
My head should be aching

I'm going from the stone
I'll darken your sky
Flowers will bloom
When I walk by

I can be cool
Soft as a breeze
From the cradle to the grave
And I'll be a hurricane
Ripping up trees
Ripping up, lifting up, oh
Tearing down trees
Ripping up, lifting up
Tearing down trees

Once a man, twice a boy
Once a boy, twice a man

And you keep taking (You keep taking, you keep taking)
And you keep on taking (You keep on taking)
My head should be aching (You keep on taking)
My head should be aching (From the cradle to the grave)
I can scheme, I can lie
I'll take care of you
Until the day you die

And I can be cool
Soft like a breeze
From the cradle to the grave

Here I come
Here I come
I'm a hurricane
A hurricane
I'm a hurricane
Yes, a hurricane
See me, here I come (So come)
Ripping up, lifting up
Tearing down trees
Here I come, hear me come (Yes, a hurricane)
Feel me come
Ripping up, lifting up
Breaking up
Tearing down trees
Here I come, feel me come, here I come
Here I come
See me come, hear me come
I'm a hurricane
Here I come, feel me come, here I come
Here I come
See me come, hear me come, feel me come
In the eye of the hurricane
