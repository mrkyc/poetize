Pleased to meet you
Pleased to have you on my plate
Your meat is sweet to me
Your destiny, your fate
You're my life support
Your life is my sport

I'm a man-eating machine
I'm a man, a man-eating machine

You won't hear me laughing
As I terminate your day
You can't trace my footsteps
As I walk the other way

I'm a man-eating machine
(I can't get enough prey, pray for me)
I'm a man, a man-eating machine
(I can't get enough prey, pray for me)

Corporate cannibal, digital criminal
(I'm a corporate cannibal, legalized criminal)
Corporate cannibal, digital criminal
Corporate cannibal, eat you like an animal

Employer of the year, grand master of fear
My blood flows satanical
Mechanical, masonical and chemical
Habitual ritual

I'm a man-eating machine
I'm a man, a man-eating machine

I deal in the market
Every man, woman and child is a target
A closet full of faceless, nameless
Pay more for less, emptiness
I'll make you scrounge, in my executive lounge
You pay less tax, but I'll gain more back
My rules, you fools

We can play the money game
Greed game, power game, stay insane
Lost in the cell, in this hell
Slave to the rhythm, of the corporate prison

I'm a man-eating machine
(I can't get enough prey, pray for me)
I'm a man, a man-eating machine
(I can't get enough prey)
Corporate cannibal, digital criminal
(I'm a corporate cannibal, legalized criminal)
Corporate cannibal, digital criminal
Corporate cannibal, eat you like an animal

I'll consume my consumers
With no sense of humor
I'll give you a uniform, chloroform
Sanitize, homogenize, vaporize you

I'm a man-eating machine
(I'm the spark, make the world explode)
I'm a man, a man-eating machine
(I'll make the world explode)

(I'm a corporate cannibal, legalized criminal)
Corporate cannibal, digital criminal
Corporate cannibal, eat you like an animal
(I'm a man, a man-eating machine)
(I'm a corporate cannibal, legalized criminal)
Corporate cannibal, digital criminal
Corporate cannibal, eat you like an animal, like an animal
