By command that I won't go (? )
If your a stranger your life is in danger
So guard your lives

Yes I'm a witch
No fantasy
You're stuck with me
No wonder evil, none is there to be found
Sinning every day
Cussing all the way
Sinning every day
Cussing all the way
No fantasy
You'er trapped with me
Just don't get tired and I won't bring you down
Sinning every day
Cussing all the way
Sinning every day
Cussing all the way
