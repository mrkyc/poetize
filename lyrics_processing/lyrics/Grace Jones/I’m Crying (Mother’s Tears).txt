Bathed in the water she ran every morning
Slept in the bed she turned down every night
I'm strong in food she prepared for me
Now I'm all grown up
Heating my hands on the very cold days
Drenched in the rain almost every school game
And in the middle of a scare, she's there
To wake me up

I'm strong enough (I'm strong enough), I'm tough enough (I'm tough enough)
I'm full enough, I'm crying my mother's tears
I'm warm enough (She's shed enough), I've pled enough (She's pled enough)
I'm loved enough, I'm crying my mother's tears

Treating my cuts with her home remedies
Combing my hair while she covered my knees
And sent me books I was forbidden to read
Educating me
I was there by her side when my grandmother died
Her weakness is strength, she's unable to cry
And lover's tears fell from father's eyes
She was all cried out

I'm strong enough, I'm tough enough
Slept enough, I'm crying my mother's tears
I'm well enough (She's shed enough), I've read enough (She's pled enough)
I've loved enough, I'm crying my mother's tears

'Cause I'm doing my best
To keep her, I leave the rest
I'm trying (You cry every night until dawn)
To stay awake (Don't make me regret you were born)
I'm falling in (Your faces are covered in red)
I have on public display (And your mother don't have the last word)
Crashing (I'm coming from the rain)
To the thunder (And don't let me hear you complain)
Scattering myself (Tell me nothing's real)
Over the floor (You can feel my pain)

Little memories of our past
Reminds her of how I used to make her laugh
I'm crying, I'm crying

I'm strong enough, I'm tough enough
Full enough, I'm crying my mother's tears
She's shed enough (She's shed enough), she's pled enough (She's pled enough)
Well enough, I'm crying my mother's tears
I'm tough enough (I'm strong enough), I'm strong enough (I'm tough enough)
