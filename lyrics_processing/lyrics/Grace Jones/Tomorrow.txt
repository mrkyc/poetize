Bet your bottom dollar that tomorrow
There'll be sun
Just thinkin' about tomorrow
Clears away the cobwebs and the sorrow
Till there's none
When I'm stuck with a day
That's grey and lonely
I just stick out my chin
And grin, and say
Oh, the sun'll come out tomorrow
So you gotta hang on till tomorrow
Come what may
Tomorrow, tomorrow
I love you tomorrow
You're only a day away
The sun'll come out tomorrow
Bet your bottom dollar that tomorrow
There'll be sun
Just thinkin' about tomorrow
Clears away the cobwebs and the sorrow
Till there's none
