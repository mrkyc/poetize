But  isn't everything I thought that it would be
I while away the lonely hours, gazing at the city towers
Wondering if there isn't someone in there just for me
Am I ever gonna fall in love in New York City?
Will I ever find a home so far from Tennessee?
Theres no future in the single bars, nothing but the one night stars
Am I ever gonna fall in love in New York City?
My ambition and wish ?
But I'm missin' the tradition ? that I knew before
Everybody in a hurry
No ones got the time and no ones got the time of day
Am I ever gonna fall in love in New York City?
Will I ever find a home so far from Tennessee?
Theres no future in the single bars, nothing but the one night stars
Am I ever gonna fall in love in New York City?
One city isn't pretty if you see it on your own
It's a fabulous place, but the ? isn't fun alone
There's no one I know to cherish, no one I can hug, 
Am I ever gonna fall in love in New York City?
Will I ever find a home so far from Tennessee?
Theres no future in the single bars, nothing but the one night stars
Am I ever gonna fall in love in New York City?
