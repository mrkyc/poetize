Uh, baby
I'm just playing around, baby
Work all day as men who know
Wheels must turn to keep the flow
Build on up, don't break the chain
Sparks will fly when the whistle blows
Never stop the action
Keep it up, keep it up, sing
Never stop the action
Keep it up, keep it up
Work to the rhythm
Live to the rhythm
Love to the rhythm
Slave to the rhythm
Axe to wood in ancient times
Man machine, power line
Fires burn, hearts beat strong
Sing out loud, the chain gang song
Never stop the action, oh
Keep it up, keep it up
Never stop the action
Come on, keep it up

Paul Cooke: "Best of luck with things."
Jean-Paul Goude: "Maybe we should kill her. And then we write - we do a film about the life of Grace Jones."
Paul Morley: "So are you, are you saying in a way that the only reality for you is you?"
Grace Jones: "I'm not sure I wanna answer that one"
Paul Morley: "Why not, is it too true or too banal?"
Grace Jones: "Well..."
Paul Morley: "Well do you know what I mean? Is it, for you.. are you the centre of the universe? Is that what you're saying?"
