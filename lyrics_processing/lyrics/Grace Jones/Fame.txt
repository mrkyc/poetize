Fame, trading love for a name, and there's no one to blame but me
You were the one  love me
I, ? take your place
You were the one that I needed
But stars don't need love, their so far above
Just screaming ?
Where are you?
Can't you hear me singing for you baby?
Where are you?
Come on back, I need you, won't you save me?
Fame, burning bright as a flame, but it drove you away from me
Fame, whats the use of this game, if I can't have you back with me
Making the big time, making the money, somehow it don't seem to take the place of
Never alone but I'm lonely, I search through the crowd and I never see your face
Where are you?
Can't you hear me singing for you baby?
Where are you?
Come on back, I need you, won't you save me?
Where are you?
Can't you hear me singing for you baby?
Where are you?
Come on back, I need you, won't you save me?
