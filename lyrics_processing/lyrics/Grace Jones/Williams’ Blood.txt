You can't save me
You can't save a wretch like me

When she was seventeen
She married a preacher man
And she settled down
In a little part of town
Followed him all around
Having little babies
Singing in a little church
In a little ghost town

She's so happy
(I don't want to keep up, I can't keep up)
She's so happy, keepin' up
(I don't wanna keep up, keepin' up with the Joneses)

Finally, she told me
Grandpa Dan traveled
Playing on the road
With Nat King Cole
And he womanized
Staying up all night
Cruisin' up around the town
From town to town to town

Let me go (Ah, ah), I'm wicked (Ooh)
Just let me go (Ah, ah), I'm going to care (Ooh)

Why don't you be a Jones?
Like your sister and your brother Noel
When are you gonna be a Jones?
You're just like your dad
And Dan, God bless his soul, oh

I've got the Williams' blood in me
I've got the Williams' blood in me
I've got the Williams' blood in me
(Got the Williams' blood)
I've got the Williams' blood in me
In me, in me, in me, I feel it running through my veins
My blood, the Williams' blood in me

In a room full of doves
I'm waiting for the angels
Spreading my wings
So I can fly
Let me fly, I'm wicked (You can't save a wretch like me)
Let me fly (Ah, ah), I'm wicked (Ooh)
Just let me go (Ah, ah), I'm going to care
Williams' prepared (Ooh)

Why don't you be a Jones?
Like your sister and your brother Noel
They said, "When are you gonna be a Jones?
You're just like your dad"
And Dan, God bless his soul, oh

I've got the Williams' blood in me
(Got the Williams' blood)
I've got the Williams' blood in me (Ooh, ooh)
I've got the Williams' blood in me (Uh, never change, uh)
I've got the Williams' blood in me (Ooh, ooh, ooh)

Oh, oh, oh so ready, change (Let me go)
For more people, let me go (Ooh, Williams' sweet, yeah)
I don't wanna keep up, I can't keep up (Let me go, ah, ah)
I don't wanna keep up, I can't keep up (Let me go, ooh)
Got the Williams' blood in me (Let me go, ah, ah)
I don't wanna keep up, I can't keep up (Let me go)
I don't wanna keep up, I can't keep up (Let me go, ooh)
I've got the Williams' blood in me
