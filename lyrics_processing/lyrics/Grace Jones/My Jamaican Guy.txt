Never standing by the door, just stretching out pan de floor
That way him don't fall over
No way him gwaan fall out pan me

Laid back, not worried back
Laid back, not thinking back
Laid back, never holding back

That way him don't waste him wata
No way it gwaan run out pan him
That way him don't waste him wata
No way it gwaan run out pan him
