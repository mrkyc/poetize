Who's at the door now?

Sun goes down, windows wide
One step closer to the other side
I can feel what others do
Can't stop this if I wanted to

Hey kid, what's the plan for tomorrow?
Where will I wake up? Where will I wake up?
Hey kid, what's the plan for tomorrow?
Where will I wake up? Where will I wake up?

Hurry now, boy, time won't wait
The here and the now will separate
There are some things you cannot choose
Soul and spirit movin' through

Hey kid, what's the plan for tomorrow?
Where will I wake up? Where will I wake up?
Hey kid, what's the plan for tomorrow?
Where will I wake up? Where will I wake up?

Two cold stones on a riverbed
Ripped and torn, cannot mend
Old white candles on a dusty porch
One flame down, another born

You showed me how to breathe, never showed me how to say goodbye
You showed me how to be, never showed me how to say goodbye
Every page turns, it's a lesson learned in time
You showed me how to breathe, never showed me how to say goodbye

Try and make good with the air that's left
Countin' every minute, livin' breath by breath
By breath, by breath, by breath, by breath, by breath
Try and make good with the air that's left
Countin' every minute, livin' breath by breath
By breath, by breath, by breath, by breath
By breath, by breath, by breath

You showed me how to need, never showed me how to say goodbye
You showed me how to grieve, never showed me how to say goodbye
Every page turns, it's a lesson learned in time
You showed me how to need, never showed me how to say goodbye
Try and make good with the air that's left
Countin' every minute, livin' breath by breath
By breath, by breath, by breath, by breath, by
Try and make good with the air that's left
Countin' every minute, livin' breath by breath
By breath, by breath, by breath, by breath, by

Goodbye!
Goodbye!
