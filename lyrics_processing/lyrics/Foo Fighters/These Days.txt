One of these days, the ground will drop
Out from beneath your feet
One of these days, your heart will stop
And play its final beat

One of these days, the clocks will stop
And time won't mean a thing
One of these days, their bombs will drop
And silence everything

But it's alright, yeah, it's alright
Said it's alright

Easy for you to say! Your heart has never been broken!
Your pride has never been stolen! Not yet, not yet!
One of these days, I bet your heart'll be broken!
I bet your pride'll be stolen! I bet, I bet, I bet, I bet!
One of these days, one of these days

One of these days, your eyes will close
And pain will disappear
One of these days, you will forget
To hope and learn to fear
