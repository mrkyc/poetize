(Ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah)

The sky is a neighborhood, so keep it down
Heart is a storybook, a star burned out
The sky is a neighborhood, don't make a sound
Lights comin' up ahead, don't look now

The sky is a neighborhood (Ah-ah, ah-ah)
The sky is a neighborhood, (Ah-ah, ah-ah) don't look now

Oh, my dear, Heaven is a big bang now
Gotta get to sleep somehow
Bangin' on the ceiling, bangin' on the ceiling
Keep it down
Oh, my dear, Heaven is a big bang now
Gotta get to sleep somehow
Bangin' on the ceiling, bangin' on the ceiling
Keep it down

Mind is a battlefield, all hope is gone
Trouble to the right and left, whose side you're on?
Thoughts like a minefield, I'm a tickin' bomb
Maybe you should watch your step, don't get lost

The sky is a neighborhood (Ah-ah, ah-ah)
The sky is a neighborhood, (Ah-ah, ah-ah) don't get lost

Oh, my dear, Heaven is a big bang now
Gotta get to sleep somehow
Bangin' on the ceiling, bangin' on the ceiling
Keep it down
Oh, my dear, Heaven is a big bang now
Gotta get to sleep somehow
Bangin' on the ceiling, bangin' on the ceiling
Keep it down

The sky is a neighborhood

Heart is a storybook, a star burned out
Something comin' up ahead, don't look now

Oh, my dear, Heaven is a big bang now
Gotta get to sleep somehow
Bangin' on the ceiling, bangin' on the ceiling
Keep it down
Oh, my dear, Heaven is a big bang now
Gotta get to sleep somehow
Bangin' on the ceiling, bangin' on the ceiling
Keep it down
(The sky is a neighborhood) Oh, my dear, Heaven is a big bang now
Gotta get to sleep somehow
(The sky is a neighborhood) Bangin' on the ceiling, bangin' on the ceiling
Keep it down
