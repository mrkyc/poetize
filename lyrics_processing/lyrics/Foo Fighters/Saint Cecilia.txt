There ain't no secrets anymore
My name's been hangin' on the hook outside your door
Just an old eyesore

I got this feeling, I can't keep it down anymore
Bring me some healin', Saint Cecilia, carry me home
To your house of
Broken bones

You're out of sight, I'm out of mind
Been sittin', watch your pictures dryin' on the line
Just a game of mine

I got this feeling, I can't keep it down anymore
Bring me some healin', Saint Cecilia, carry me home
To your house of
Broken bones

I know no matter what I say
Days will come and go, no matter what I say
Nothing's set in stone, no matter what I say
Days go by
I know no matter what I say
Days will come and go, no matter what I say
Nothing's set in stone, no matter what I say
Days go by
