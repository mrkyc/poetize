All my life, I've been searchin' for somethin'
Somethin' never comes, never leads to nothin'
Nothin' satisfies, but I'm gettin' close
Closer to the prize at the end of the rope
All night long, I dream of the day
When it comes around, then it's taken away
Leaves me with the feelin' that I feel the most
Feel it come to life when I see your ghost

Come down, don't you resist
You've such a delicate wrist
And if I give it a twist
Somethin' to hold when I lose my grip
Will I find somethin' in there?
To give me just what I need
Another reason to bleed
One by one, hidden up my sleeve
One by one, hidden up my sleeve

Hey, don't let it go to waste
I love it, but I hate the taste
Weight keepin' me down
Hey, don't let it go to waste
I love it, but I hate the taste
Weight keepin' me down

Will I find a believer?
Another one who believes?
Another one to deceive?
Over and over, down on my knees
If I get any closer
And if you open up wide
And if you let me inside
On and on, I got nothin' to hide
On and on, I got nothin' to hide

Hey, don't let it go to waste
I love it, but I hate the taste
Weight keepin' me down
Hey, don't let it go to waste
I love it, but I hate the taste
Weight keepin' me down

All my life, I've been searchin' for somethin'
Somethin' never comes, never leads to nothin'
Nothin' satisfies, but I'm gettin' close
Closer to the prize at the end of the rope
All night long, I dream of the day
When it comes around, then it's taken away
Leaves me with the feelin' that I feel the most
Feel it come to life when I see your ghost
Then I'm done, done, on to the next one
Done, done, and I'm on to the next one
Done, done, and I'm on to the next one
Done, done, and I'm on to the next one
Done, done, and I'm on to the next one
Done, done, and I'm on to the next one
Done, done, and I'm on to the next one
Done, I'm done, and I'm on to the next
Done, done, on to the next one!
Done, I'm done, and I'm on to the next one!
Done, done, on to the next one!
Done, I'm done, and I'm on to the next!

Hey, don't let it go to waste
I love it, but I hate the taste
Weight keepin' me down
Hey, don't let it go to waste
I love it, but I hate the taste
Weight keepin' me down

Done, done, on to the next one!
