A heart of gold, but it lost its pride
Beautiful veins and bloodshot eyes
I've seen your face in another light
Why'd you have to go and let it die?

Why'd you have to go and let it die?
Why'd you have to go and let it die?
In too deep and out of time
Why'd you have to go and let it die?

A simple man and his blushin' bride
(Why'd you have to go and let it die?)
Intravenous, intertwined
(Why'd you have to go and let it die?)
Heart's gone cold, your hands were tied
(Why'd you have to go and let it die?)
Why'd you have to go and let it die?
(Why'd you have to go and let it die?)

Why'd you have to go and let it die?
Why'd you have to go and let it die?
In too deep and out of time
Why'd you have to go and let it die?

In too deep and lost in time
Why'd you have to go and let it die?
Beautiful veins and bloodshot eyes
Why'd you have to go and let it die?
