When I get older, I will be stronger
They'll call me freedom just like a wavin' flag
So wave your flag, now wave your flag
Now wave your flag, oh oh oh

Born to a throne, stronger than Rome
But violent prone, poor people zone
But it's my home, all I have known
Where I got grown, streets we would roam
Out of the darkness, I came the farthest
Among the hardest survival
Learn from these streets, it can be bleak
Accept no defeat, surrender, retreat

So we struggling, fighting to eat
And we wondering, when we'll be free
So we patiently wait for that fateful day
It's not far away, but for now we say

When I get older, I will be stronger
I'll make it better, struggle no longer
When I get older, I will be stronger
They'll call me freedom just like a wavin' flag
So wave your flag, now wave your flag
Now wave your flag, now wave your flag
Now wave your flag, now wave your flag
Now wave your flag, oh oh oh

So many wars (Wars), settling scores (Scores)
Bringing us promises, leaving us poor
And in the situation, when there's no compensation
They got no occupation, no buy no medication
See, it's a combination of no education
We can never get it say, tomorrow's generation
Cause they can't control us, no, they can't hold us down

We gonna pick it up, even though we all struggling, fighting to eat
And we wondering when we'll be free
So we patiently wait (Wait) for that faithful day (Go)
It's not far away, but for now we say

When I get older, I will be stronger
I'll make it better, struggle no longer
When I get older, I will be stronger
They'll call me freedom just like a wavin' flag
So wave your flag (Yeah), now wave your flag (Yeah)
Now wave your flag (Yeah), now wave your flag
Now wave your flag, now wave your flag

Oooooh! Oooooh! Oooooh! Oooooh!
And everybody will be singing it (Oooooh!)
And you and I will be singing it  (Oooooh!)
And we all will be singing it  (Ooooooooh!)
When I get older, I will be stronger
Stronger, stronger, I will be stronger
Stronger, stronger, I will be stronger
They'll call me freedom just like a wavin' flag

So wave your flag, now wave your flag
Now wave your flag, now wave your flag
