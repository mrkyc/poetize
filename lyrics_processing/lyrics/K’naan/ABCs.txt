Hehehe
Yeah
Come!
Let's go

Bundle up, my whole style is so cold
I glow like old guys who go bald
My flow got no front in the vocal
Your flow got no button, it's so old
I don't mean to sound like a showboat
But it's true my persona's no joke
I stepped into some kinda portal
I'm legend and sometimes I'm noble
I'm from the most risky zone, oh
No place is more shifty global
More pistols, Russian revolvers
We shootin' all that is normal
But it ain't just because we want to
We ain't got nowhere we can run to
Somebody please press the undo
They only teach us the things that guns do
You might also like
They don't teach us the ABC's
We play on the hard concrete
All we got is life on the streets
All we got is life on the streets
They don't teach us the ABC's
We play on the hard concrete
All we got is life on the streets
All we got is life on the streets

Rock, you know my era
B-boy seasoning, Salt-N-Pepa
Grown and sexy, come with the extra
Crushed-up linen, fly like Cessna
This type-groove, I gave it birth
Now, it's time again to give it a verse
Jamaican born, not a fan of the ganja
Boulevard, Brooklyn to Somalia
And it goes in the background
Playa, that is my sound
The green doesn't symbolize, I made it on the top
Pioneer, legend, and they call me Mr. Rock
No B-word or N-word, I don't need those words
Respect for hers
The game dried up, so we come with the grease
Leading you right and treating you right, so, peace!
They don't teach us the ABC's
We play on the hard concrete
All we got is life on the streets
All we got is life on the streets
They don't teach us the ABC's
We play on the hard concrete
All we got is life on the streets
All we got is life on the streets

Superman I'm known by the locals
As this dude who's so fly it's global
Attitude that came outta struggle
Destitute but I make it hopeful
You real but my real is tenfold
My real will make yours a rental
Gangsta if it is, essential
Fight with guns or utensils
So bold, nothing's confidential
Breakfast was not continental
And lunch could not compliment all
We still become competent souls
These streets ain't paved with no gold
Matter fact, someone stole the light pole
Nobody fat enough for lipo
They don't teach us to read and write, so
They don't teach us the ABC's
We play on the hard concrete
All we got is life on the streets
All we got is life on the streets
They don't teach us the ABC's
We play on the hard concrete
All we got is life on the streets
