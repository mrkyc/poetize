Yeah, Uh
Let me introduce me
I don't gotta pack due to the fact I'm Africa's Rap Bruce Lee
Plus they've been trying to shoot me since I was two feet
So I am never scared, you can YouTube me
Where I'm from, they will pull your card, mister
You ain't hard, mister
I was initiated into manhood at thirteen and it wasn't a bar mitzvah
I break a bottle on ya like a bad bartender
Let my star venture out
I got war in me, so let me vent it out

I don't expect you to feel my pain
But with respects to the rules of the game
They don't apply because I made it this far
Stage down like a ghetto rockstar

And if rap gets jealous 'cause I rock heavy
It don't worry me if mothafuckers dont get it
So if rap gets jealous, 'cause of where I'm headed
I used to be a public enemy, don't forget it
And if rap gets jealous 'cause I rock heavy
It don't worry me if mothafuckers don't get it
So if rap gets jealous, baby I'm a menace
You know, I came to bring the pain
You might also like
I'll admit it, I could spit it like a fitted knitted cap
That means tight and won't stop like a city cab
That means I'm not white
But I figured do it big because the slum needs me
So instead of getting a beat from Kanye(eezy) who would probably take half my budget
I could save the back end and send it back to Mogadishu
Where my family and friends getting patched up again
You can ask Hova
The hood is harder than you thought
Like a fifty chain getting snatched in Angola

I don't expect you to feel my pain
But with respects to the rules of the game
They don't apply because I made it this far
Stage down like a ghetto rockstar

And if rap gets jealous 'cause I rock heavy
It don't worry me if mothafuckers dont get it
So if rap gets jealous, 'cause of where I'm headed
I used to be a public enemy, don't forget it
And if rap gets jealous 'cause I rock heavy
It don't worry me if mothafuckers don't get it
So if rap gets jealous, baby I'm a menace
You know, I came to bring the pain
(You know)
(You know)
(You know)
(You know)


So don't tell me I gotta be the same
I'm tryin to get you to know my name
And with respects to the rules of the game
They don't apply because I came this far
Stage dive like a rockstar

And if rap gets jealous 'cause I rock heavy
It don't worry me if mothafuckers dont get it
So if rap gets jealous, 'cause of where I'm headed
I used to be a public enemy, don't forget it
And if rap gets jealous 'cause I rock heavy
It don't worry me if mothafuckers don't get it
So if rap gets jealous, baby I'm a menace
You know, I came to bring the pain
(Here we go)
Uh!
Yeah!

And if rap gets jealous
So if rap gets jealous, baby I'm a menace
