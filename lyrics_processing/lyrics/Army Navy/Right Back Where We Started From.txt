We gotta get right back to where we started from
Love is good, love can be strong
We gotta get right back to where we started from, oh oh
Do you remember that day? (That sunny day)
When you first came my way
I said, no one could take your place
And if you get hurt (If you get hurt)
By the little things I say
I can put a smile back on your face
Ooh, and it's alright, and it's coming on
We gotta get it right back to where we started from
Love is good, love can be strong
We gotta get it right back to where we started from, oh oh
A love like ours (A love like ours)
Can never fade away
You know it's only just begun
You gave me your love (Gave me your love)
I just can't stay away
You know you are the only one
Ooh, and it's alright, and it's coming on
We gotta get it right back to where we started from
Love is good, love can be strong
We gotta get it right back to where we started from
