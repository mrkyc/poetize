I do not have to tell you how a welcome it will be
I felt the light before, but I let it slip away but
I still keep on believing that it will come back some day
It is not the spotlight, it is not the camera light
It is not the street lights of some old street of dreams
It is not the moonlight, not even the sunlight
But I have seen it shining in your eyes, and you know what I mean
Some times, I try to tell myself, the light was never real
Just a fantasy that used to be, the way I used to feel
But you and I know better now, even though it is been so long
If your memory really serves you well, you will never tell me, I am wrong
It is not the spotlight; it is not the camera lights
It is not the streetlights of some old street of dreams
Oh, Lord.It is not the moonlight, not even the sunlight but
I have seen it shining in your eyes, and you know what I mean
If I ever feel the light again, you know things would have to change
Names, and faces; homes, and places will have to re-rearranged
If you can help a bit come about, if you ever so inclined there is no
Roam reason why a woman cannot change your mind
It is not the spotlight; it is not the camera light
It is not the streetlights, of some old street of dreams
Oh, Lord It is not the moonlight, not even the sunlight but
I have seen it shining in your eyes, and you know what I mean

No, it is not the moonlight, never the sunlight but
