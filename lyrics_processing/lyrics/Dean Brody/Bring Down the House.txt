I'm from the country, you're from the city
I drive a truck, you think that's silly
But there's another side of me you know you'd like to see
Ain't that right? Oh that's right

I got my money, in my pocket
A girl beside me, a little bottle rocket
There's a finger on her lips and a swagger in her hips
Tonight, tonight, tonight

And I say "Hey, I, want you girl"
You make my heart, heart flutter like a tilt-a-whirl
It's getting freaky on the floor feel that rumbling sound
I might have grown up in a barn
But I can bring down the house

I'm wearing camo, y'all hastag this
This party's raging, you won't wanna miss
All my buddies turning up, parking lot is full of trucks
Hang on tight, hang on tight, oh my, my, my
You might also like
And I say "Hey, I, want you girl"
You make my heart, heart flutter like a tilt-a-whirl
It's getting freaky on the floor feel that rumbling sound
I might have grown up in a barn
But I can bring down the house

And we go down, down, down, down
The club goes round, round, round, round
We take it to the ground, ground, ground, ground
Oooh tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
And we go down, down, downtown
The club goes round, round, round, round
We take it to the ground, ground, ground, ground
Oooh tonight

And I say "Hey, I, want you girl"
You make my heart, heart flutter like a tilt-a-whirl
It's getting freaky on the floor feel that rumbling sound
I might have grown up in a barn
But I can bring down the house

And we go down, down, down, down
The club goes round, round, round, round
We take it to the ground, ground, ground, ground
Oooh tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
Girl you're so wonderful, why don't we ditch this floor
Head out to the barn, I'll hold you in my arms
I'll show you the stars
Oooh, oooh...

"Hey, I, want you girl"
You make my heart flutter like a tilt-a-whirl
It's getting freaky on the floor feel that rumbling sound
I say "Hey, I, want you girl"
You make my heart, heart flutter like a tilt-a-whirl
It's getting freaky on the floor feel that rumbling sound
I might have grown up in a barn
