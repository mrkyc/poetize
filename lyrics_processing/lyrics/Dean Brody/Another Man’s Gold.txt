And I heard daddy start the truck
I came runnin' from the house and waved him down
'Cause he was makin' a run to the dump
We watched the Bears and licked ice cream cones
Take a little walk around
I'll never forget what my daddy said
The day we pulled that bike from the ground
He said one man's trash is another man's gold
If it's thrown away it's free to take
A little oil, she'll be good to go
So I rode that bicycle home
Thumbs up, daddy honkin' on the horn
I got my first job workin' on a dairy farm
Drivin' tractor and bailin' hay
I'd have to circle around a bog in the ground
Where sat an old Mustang '68
One evenin' I asked that farmer
Why that car was just wastin' away
He said you can have it for free it don't mean nothin' to me
And I couldn't help but think
You might also likeOne man's trash is another man's gold
What someone will throw away is a crying shame
So I towed that Mustang home
Till she could be restored
I got that engine to roar
And boy did that engine roar
It was an awkward blind date we met at a park
She had her little girl taggin' along
A beautiful smile hadn't been out in a while
She was a hard working single mom
In time I learned he'd left her
He said "I'm just way too young
To be having a kid, I'm not ready for this
If you keep it I'm good as gone"
He never looked back as she watched him go
She stood there crying in the rain till one January day
She had a beautiful baby girl
Tonight I tuck her in and read her stories
And hold her mama while the sunset glows
My two arms full of this man's gold
What some men will throw away is a crying shame
Those girls make our house a home
Yeah my cup overflows
With this man's gold
