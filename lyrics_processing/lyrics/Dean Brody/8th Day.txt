8 years old, gone fishing
With a handful of worms
On a river bank with her daddy cheeks all sumgded in dirt
She's so proud, catching fish, missing both front teeth
Her daddy blind and happy, to the trouble she'll be
(And oh the trouble she'll be)

Complicated, wonder must have took more time
To figure her out
To get perfect just right
7 days he took then he said, its good
But there's just something missing in my world
So on the 8th day, God made country girls
Country girls

Teenage boy at an auction
Getting out bid on a truck
By a pony tail in the front
Wearing boots and tracking mud
He's so made, but she's so cute
He just can't speak his mind
She winks as she passes
Says "Hon, looks like you'll need a ride."
(Oh ain't he in for a ride)
You might also like
Complicated, wonders gonna take him time
To figure her out
To get perfect just right
Couple dates in the woods, then he said "this is good
You were the something missing in my world."
Thank heaven on the 8th day
God made country girls
Country girls

Make you laugh
Make you cry
Make you pace the porch on a Friday night
With a shotgun at your side
Cuz he's late again
Screen door creeks
Your wife steps out
She said "Honey, you stand down, that used to be you and I, don't you forget
And if he's anything like you, he's in over his head"

Complicated, wonders gonna take some time
To figure her out
To get perfect just right
Cuz 7 days it took the Lord said "Its good
But there's still something missing in this world"
So on the 8th day
God made, country girls
Country girls
Country girls
