We parked the car
And I sang you a song I wrote on my guitar
Oh I have kissed
Many times since then
But that first one is special
One you don't forget
If I had asked you then you probably took my ring
But time and distance have a way
Of changing things
And sometimes I wonder
What it would have been like
If we had wandered
The same path in life
Tonight if you're out there
Looking up at the same moon
Girl I hope
That your trail in life
Has been good to you
College days
Frat house nights
You were more than just a bunch of rowdy friends of mine
You made leaving home
Not as hard to bare
Yeah we swore we'd stick together
Till we were in rocking chairs
But we all kind of scattered
Getting our lives in gear
The phone calls went from weeks to months
To I ain't heard in years
You might also likeAnd sometimes I wonder
What it would have been like
If we had wandered
The same paths in life
Would we still smoke cigars?
Yeah when the wild cats beat OU
Oh friend I hope that your trail in life
Has been good to you
The day I was born
They said you cried
When you signed those papers
And kissed me good-bye
To young to know
How to raise me up
So you let me go and start this world in a house of love
I was 12 years old when daddy sat me down
And told me of a brave young girl
That I should know about
And sometimes I wonder
What it would have been like
If we had wondered
The same path in life
I think I would make you proud
Of the boy you never knew
God I hope
That your trail in life
Has been good to you
And some day I know
This old trail in life
