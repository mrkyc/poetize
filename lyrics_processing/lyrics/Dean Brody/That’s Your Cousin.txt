Friday nights around here ain't a whole lot to do
So I went and called up sweet Becky Lou
Said "How'd you like to go for a drive?"
I took her in my truck to the railroad tracks
I lit a cozy fire, for a little romance
Sang her song, and she reached for my hand
When Daddy busted out the woods
He said:
Chorus:
Stop it right there, hands in the air
Think there's something you kids oughta know
Scared your momma half to death, when your searchin the sticks
Tryin' to find ya, and dang that was close
Her daddy's older nephew might be twice removed
But she's the daughter of a mother related to you
If you don't wanna go swimming in the same gene pool
Don't be touchin'
That's your cousin
I turned around and looked at Becky
And she looked at me
Broke the law of attraction almost instantly
Her pretty brown hair went to ugly and green
And she gave me my coat back
So we packed it in when the night was young
She said "If you don't mind, I still like to have fun
There's a show called Deliverance on re-run
Down at the cinema

Stop it right there, hands in the air
Think there's something you kids oughta know
Scared your momma half to death, when your searchin the sticks
Tryin' to find ya, and dang that was close
Her daddy's older nephew might be twice removed
But she's the daughter of a mother related to you
If you don't wanna go swimming in the same gene pool
Don't be touchin'
That's your cousin
Yeah
Stop it right there, hands in the air
Think there's something you kids oughta know
Scared your momma half to death, when your searchin the sticks
Tryin' to find ya, and dang that was close
Her daddy's older nephew might be twice removed
But she's the daughter of a mother related to you
We need a little separation in our gene pool
Don't be touchin'
That's your cousin
I ran into Becky just the other day
At the new online Internet cafe
She was lookin' for a man from the Ukraine
