Sheepskin cloak across his back
A preacher man with kind old eyes
And a mystery for a past
He said he'd come to teach about
The love of God
But he soon learned what they were missing there
Was justice and the law
There was a cattleman who claimed his clan
Owned all the land around
And any brave fool who that might dispute
He was quick to snuff 'em out
He'd say, "Take my heed
And you won't pay the price
'Cause honor and a name ain't worth a damn
If you don't have your life."
He'd say, "Ain't nobody faster than this cattle man's gun
I'm a rattlesnake on the trigger
Your last stand'll be lyin' in the sand
Fallin' to the slam of my hammer."
So one man taught forgiveness
While the other taught suffering
The preacher said deliverance
Could be found out on their knees
He said, "I know that you want justice
And you want blood
But believe me when I say to you
Don't try and be that man's judge
You might also like'Cause ain't nobody faster than that cattleman's gun
He's a rattlesnake on the trigger
Your last stand'll be lyin' in the sand
Fallin' to the slam of his hammer."
One day a young farmer brought his sons to town for feed
And he noticed that the streets were quiet, and he knew what that might mean
The smoke rose in the distance
His farm burned to the ground
He let the fury overtake him
When Cattle Man came back to town
Those boys ran out from behind the crowd
And watched their daddy die
The big man laughed and said, "Now look at that
Anybody else wanna give it a try?"
Well, the church doors opened with that black cloak flowin' behind the preacher's fiery eyes
He said, "Your ticket to Hell is a comin' to you
And I got a hollow-point to give you the ride."
And the only thing faster than the cattle man's gun
Was the preacher's handy finger
He pulled iron from his side and let that bullet fly
Beat the rattlesnake to the hammer
While the preacher embraced forgiveness
Oh, they finally understood
Under that sheepskin cloak of his
