B-U-S-H P-A-R-T-Y
We'll have some F-U-N tonight
Everybody welcome in the VIP line
Out here in the woods
Up here there ain't no velvet rope
Just a big bonfire down this all grass road

It's a secret place where the music goes
It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes

Boom boom boom
'neath the big blue moon
And we stomp our boots
Sippin on Bacardi
Yeah me and you
Steal a kiss or two
Crash under the roof, up against the roots of a Georgia pine tree
Yeah come on down, outside of town
To our bush party

B-U-S-H P-A-R-T-Y
All my buddies need the stars and the roll bar lights
Yeah the Po-Po probably gonna visit us tonight
Kids you're way too loud
Here they come through the smoke country bo-ho girls, tunic shirts, lace skirts, rockin' janglets and curls
You might also like
Yeah it's a party now, the woofer's thumpin out
They go, they go, they go, they go

Boom boom boom
'neath the big blue moon
And we stomp our boots
Sippin on Bacardi
Yeah me and you
Steal a kiss or two
Crash under the roof, up against the roots of a Georgia pine tree
Yeah come one down, outside of town
To our bush party

Dancin' on the hood, it's off the hook
My kind of crowd outside of town
The sparks go up, and we get down, down, down

Boom boom boom
'neath the big blue moon
And we stomp our boots
Sippin on Bacardi
Yeah me and you
Steal a kiss or two
Crash under the roof, up against the roots of a Georgia pine tree
Yeah come on down, outside of town
To our bush party
Yeah come join the crowd
We'll show ya round' our bush party
