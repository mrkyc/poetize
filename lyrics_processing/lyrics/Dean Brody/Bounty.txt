I never stare nobody down
'Til one night my girl
I could not find her
She never made it back from town
I found my Shannon crying in the woods
A wicked man held her down
So I stuck him deep and I buried him good
Not deep enough to fool the hounds
We took shelter in a chapel
'Neath the blood moon sky
I bought a gun and made Shannon my wife
We jumped in a box-car to old Mexico
Where I ain't worth a penny of my bounty back home
No I ain't worth a penny of my bounty back home
That train stopped in Tijuana
We built a shack beneath the sun
I make my Shannon margaritas
We watch our children laugh and run, run, run
Sometimes I miss my daddy
Sometimes I miss my mom
But I think they'd be real proud of me
To know the man that I've become

Where I ain't worth a penny of my bounty back home
No I ain't worth a penny of my bounty back home
Train, train roll on
Train, train roll on
Train, train roll on, roll on
Shannon, why'd you run with me?
She said
What was I supposed to do boy?
Just watch you leave?
You'd have broken my heart
You'd have haunted my dreams
Your love, boy, is all I need
Your love, boy, is all I'll ever need
We took shelter in a chapel
'Neath the blood moon sky

We jumped in a box-car to old Mexico
Where we ain't worth a penny of our bounty back home
