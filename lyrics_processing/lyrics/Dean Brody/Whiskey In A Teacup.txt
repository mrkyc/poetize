Little frill on her pink tank top
Yeah she talks kinda soft with a little country drawl
Old money in the way she walks
My baby she looks kinda harmless
Boys hit on her from right to left
But judge a book by her cover and you're in for it brother
She's tea with a ninety proof twist
You better like whiskey, you better like smoke
A little bit a burn when you take a toke
A triple shot of buzz in your espresso
When you take a sip - when she's on your lips
She might look like Sunday morning
But she oughta come with a general warning
If you think that you can shoot her straight
You better pucker up
Cause she's whiskey in a teacup
She's whiskey in a teacup
When she was little she learned the graces
Momma taught her how a lady should be
But Grand-mammy snuck around, took that little girl out
And let her play in the mud in the creek
Well behaved girls rarely make history
She said there's wild in this family tree
So when you find a boy you love make sure he's man enough
To hold the liquor that he's bout to drink

A little bit a burn when you take a toke
A triple shot of buzz in your espresso
When you take a sip - when she's on your lips
She might look like Sunday morning
But she oughta come with a general warning
If you think that you can shoot her straight
You better pucker up
Cause she's whiskey in a teacup
She's whiskey in a teacup
She's the wobble in my walk
St-t-tutter in my talk
She's a party I just can't leave
She's the last call, make ya fall
China Doll in overalls
And boys she comes home with me
Cause I like whiskey, I like a little smoke
A little bit a burn when I take a toke
A triple shot of buzz in my espresso
When I take a sip, when she's on my lips
She might look like Sunday morning
But she oughta come with a general warning
If you think that you can shoot her straight
You better pucker up
Cause she's whiskey in a teacup
