I see ya'll laughing
As I pull up my truck
Fancy boys I can read your lips
You're saying "Look at that bucket of rust."
Then my baby steps out
Your jaws drop and your eyes go wide
What's a girl like that, doing with a guy like me?
I'll tell ya boys, I got four wheel drive

And I can take her where the crickets are crickin'
And the bullfrogs rumble low
Nothing makes her smile or drives her wild
Like bouncing round on an old back road, oh
When we get stuck, she gets that look in her eyes
I grab a-hold of the stick she says put it in
Four wheel drive

It's okay, turn your nose up
At my boots my Carhartt pants
But the girls on your arm know us boys from the farm
Take 'em places you pretty boys can't

Yeah we can take 'em where the crickets are crickin'
And the bullfrogs rumble low
Nothing makes her smile or drives her wild
Like bouncing round on an old back road, oh
When we get stuck, she gets that twinkle in her eyes
I grab a-hold of the stick she says put it in
Four wheel drive
You might also like
Aw hello, I can see that look in their eyes
Boys you better keep your dates close tonight
You might have daddy's money talking smooth as honey
But I got four wheel drive

And I can take her where the crickets are crickin'
And the bullfrogs rumble low
Nothing makes her smile or drives her wild
Like bouncing round on an old back road, oh
When we get stuck, she gets that look in her eyes
I grab hold of the stick she says put it in
Four wheel drive
Four wheel drive
