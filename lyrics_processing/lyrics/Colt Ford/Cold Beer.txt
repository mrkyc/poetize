Well just pass me a cold one buddy it's that time again
That neon sign says open and I'm here with all my friends
So just keep them taps a flowin' the first round's all on me
And as long as they keep pourin' 'em hey we ain't gonna leave

Well good God almighty there's a party in here
And Lord have mercy I'm thirsty pass me a beer
Been workin' all day, 'bout ready to play
I done called all my boys and they on their way
And we ain't going home 'til the sun come up
And if I'm too drunk to drive I just sleep in my truck
Won't be the first time and sure not the last
Got my eye on that blond with the heart-shaped ass
She been lookin' at me since I walked through the door
'Bout time for old Colt to twirl around the dance floor
See if she got a thing for them old cowboys who like to fight
Raise hell and make a lot of noise

Well just pass me a cold one buddy it's that time again
That neon sign says open and I'm here with all my friends
So just keep them taps a flowin' the first round's all on me
And as long as they keep pourin' 'em y'all we ain't gonna leave

Well here's the situation the blond wasn't cookin'
But she came with a friend who was just as good lookin'
So I eased on over with a bottle of Bud looked her right in the eye
Said little lady what's up?
Do you like country boys with a southern drawl
Who fish hunt and fight say yes ma'am and y'all?
If so then I might be just your type
If not what the hell darlin' I won't tell
Now me 'n' you can ease on outta here
My truck is out front I got a cooler of beer
And I'd love to take you for a bite to eat
Waffle House is still open right down the street
It's all on me I got plenty of cash
I might fight a grizzly bear for a piece of that ass
As a matter of fact run and get your friends
I'll round up the boys we can make some noise

Well just pass me a cold one buddy it's that time again
That neon sign says open and I'm here with all my friends
So just keep them taps a flowin' the first round's all on me
And as long as they keep pourin' 'em y'all we ain't gonna leave
Well just pass me a cold one buddy it's that time again
That neon sign says open and I'm here with all my friends
So just keep them taps a flowin' the first round's all on me
