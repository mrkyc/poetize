Was the dark of the moon on the sixth of June
In a Kenworth pullin' logs
Cabover Pete with a reefer on
And a Jimmy haulin' hogs
We's headed for bear on I-10
About a mile outta Shaky Town
I says "Pigpen, this here's the Rubber Duck
And I'm about to put the hammer on down"

'Cause we got a little ol' convoy rockin' thru the night
Yeah we got a little ol' convoy ain't she a beautiful sight
Come on and join our convoy ain't nothin' gonna get in our way

Ah, ten-four, about five mile or so
Ten roger, them hogs is gettin' IN-tense up here

By the time we got into Tulsa town we had 85 trucks in all
But there's a roadblock up on the cloverleaf
And them bears is wall to wall
Yeah them smokeys 's thick as bugs on a bumper
They even had a bear in the air
I says callin' all trucks, this here's the Duck
We about to go a-huntin' bear

'Cause we got a great big convoy rockin' thru the night

Ah, negatory Pigpen, you're still too close
Yeah them hogs is startin' to close up my sinuses
Mercy sake's you better back off another ten
Well we rolled up Interstate 44
Like a rocket sled on rails
We tore up all of our swindle sheets
And left 'em sittin' on the scales
By the time we hit that Shi town
Them bears was a-gettin' smart
They brought up some reinforcements
From the Illinois National Guard
There's armored cars and tanks and jeeps
And rigs of every size
Yeah the chicken coops was full of bears
And choppers filled the skies
Well we shot the line
And went for broke
With a thousand screaming trucks
And eleven longhaired friends of Jesus
In a chartreuse microbus

Ah, Sodbuster, this here's the Duck, c'mon here, ten-four
Hey Sodbuster listen, you wanna put that microbus in behind that suicide jockey?
Yeah he's haulin' dynamite, he needs all the help he can get

Well we laid a strip for the Jersey shore
And prepared to cross the line
I could see the bridge was lined with bears
But I didn't have a doggone dime
I says Pigpen this here's the Rubber Duck
We just ain't gonna pay no toll
So we crashed the gate doin' ninety-eight
I says, let them truckers roll, ten-four
'Cause we got a mighty convoy rockin' thru the night (rockin' through the night)
Yeah we got a mighty convoy ain't she a beautiful sight (oooh)
Come on and join our convoy ain't nothin' gonna get in our way
We gonna roll this truckin' convoy 'cross the USA
Convoy (convoy)
Convoy (convoy)

Ah, ten-four Pigpen. What's your twenty? OMAHA?
Well they oughta know what to do with them hogs out there, for sure
Well mercy sake's alive good buddy, we gonna back on outta here
So keep your bugs off your glass and the bears off your... tail
We'll catch you on the flip-flop
