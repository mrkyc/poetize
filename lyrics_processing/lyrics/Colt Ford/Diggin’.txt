He's got a backhoe it's Caterpillar yellow
He's a heller of a feller a drinkin' storyteller
With a DUI he's illegal to drive
But he legally drinks and gets illegally high
Then one night while he's up in the sky
He looked at that backhoe ask himself why not
I'm gonna drive that thing its a loop hole man
This DUI don't contain
I'm gonna drive it to the bar down on Main Street
Now he's

Diggin'
Gotta hot little honey hangin' outta that cab
Diggin'
Got the windows tinted and a bass tube hittin' it
Diggin'
Creepin' past the po po incognito like Joe Dirt
That's how he's livin' life's a garden man
And he's just diggin'

Hes wearin' a cat hat with the meow meow kitty
Rolls up in the club pimpin' like Denny
With the beer trippin' just sippin' on suds
Puttin' shots back then trippin' with his buds
Hes was 10 beers in about 12 o'clock
But to all the girls who's startin' to flock
He said hey ladies time to go home
We can't stay here who wants to go
About then the valet pulled that backhoe up
Now he's

He was drunk as a skunk and high as a kite
