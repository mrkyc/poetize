Welcome to the drop zone, got you in the crosshairs
Once I pull this trigger, they're gonna haul you outta here
Hunting is a lifestyle, survival of the fittest
We on a hunt, what you want, come on
Now you in a drop zone

Drop down, exhale, one shot, one kill
We do it like this all day, drop zone y'all we don't play
We chase them big old hogs, big trucks with old bird dogs
It's all American to hunt and tote a gun
Climb up in that tree stand, got a muzzle loader in my hand
Big buck walkin' into sight, game over drop zone good night
We hunt them grizzly bears, kodiaks, blacks and brown
Wanna see where the drop zone is
Follow them tracks to the edge of town
That's where you'll find me, all my folks behind me
We do it like every day, God bless the USA
No way we'll ever stop, we make that big game drop
Outdoors is where we roll, now welcome to the drop zone

Welcome to the drop zone, got you in the crosshairs
Once I pull this trigger, they're gonna haul you outta here
Hunting is a lifestyle, survival of the fittest
We on a hunt, what you want, come on
Now you in a drop zone
See Colt Ford LiveGet tickets as low as $54You might also like
Now if it flies it dies, that's geese, ducks, and dove
Pheasants and quail yeah, huntin' is what we love
We chase them thunder chickens, we make 'em strut and spit
When they enter that drop zone baby, game over that's it
Big bass, big bucks, big guns, get some
This is America and we don't ever run
Been known to tree a coon or maybe grab a gator
Support the NRA, what more do I need to say
One shot, one kill, drop zone, it's real
Outdoors is where we roll, now welcome to the drop zone

Welcome to the drop zone, got you in the crosshairs
Once I pull this trigger, they're gonna haul you outta here
Hunting is a lifestyle, survival of the fittest
We on a hunt, what you want, come on
