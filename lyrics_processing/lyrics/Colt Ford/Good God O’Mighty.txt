Woke up this morning about half past 8
Work started at 7 and I was still smelling like Seagrams 7
Oh hell, don't know what I'm gonna do
Man one sock is brown the others blue
Wheres my dang keys man wheres my truck
Ol scram musta took it that son of a buck
Got to go ask the neighbor if I can borrow his Saab
Cause Mondays rent due, shoot I need this job
Got the keys from slim took off slingin' rocks
Hit the town doin' 90 lord there's the cop
Now I'm pulled over in front of the bossman's gate
Got liquor on my breath lord I'm scared to death
Now the sherrif's lookin' at me like we ain't friends
Then I seen the camera crew not Cops again
Once was enough, I guess the devil's inside me
Somedays you gotta say "good god almighty"

Well I done went and hired me one of them P.I.'s
'Cause I think my ol' lady's tellin' me some lies
Now I'm lookin' at the tape and its her with Slim
When I was out workin' hard she was home with him
No wonder he was eager to let me borrow his car
But now he's comprehended in the cookie jar
They would thinkin' that the drinking might make me forget
But I'm sharper then bear claws, slicker than goose shit
They say life's a bitch and the shit just happens
I guess that's the truth cause I'm a country boy rappin'
Got my stuff all packed, everything's a blur
And my damned ol' dog wants to go with her
Man this is crazy I'm a pretty good dude
A little rough around the edges and an attitude
I don't know what do to, I guess the devil's inside me
