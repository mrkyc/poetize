Country girl shake them hips
D-D-D-DJ make that record skip
This a straight up redneck rager
Doing body shots of Yager, let er' rip
We on that moonshine and we're sippin' on Bacardi
We showin' Vegas how us country folk party (yes sir)
What happens in the backwoods, stays in the backwoods
We goin' ham y'all hard as a mother

So crank it up (crank it up woot woot)
Put some of that party in my cup (in my cup woot woot)
Y'all I'm dancin' with a girl up on my flatbed
She hotter than a cherry on a Marlboro red, wow
Weekends come and we can't get enough
So crank it up (crank it up woot woot)
Crank, crank it up (crank it up woot woot)

Man crank up the beat, put ACDC on repeat (woot woot)
We shake it all night long to the po-po come
You know me, I roll deep
It's three am you know we only gettin' started
We showin' Vegas how us country folks party
What happens in the backwoods, stays in the backwoods
We goin' ham y'all hard as a mother
