Man she's, she's like everything you've ever
You've ever dreamed of
She's so perfectly imperfect, watch the way she works it
Blowin' like a summer breeze, sweeter than a Georgia peach
She's like rollin' with the top down, every little small town
Even in the big city, everywhere you look around
She's like a free round of drinks at my favorite bar
She's like a new set of strings on my old guitar
She's like a pedal to the metal in my muscle car
She's a wide open road

She's like a hit song on the radio
And I can't escape her everywhere that I go
Shes got me singin' along when she comes on
Her memory moves me all night long
She's with me everywhere that I go
She's got me singin' like woah oh oh oh oh oh
She's got me singin' like woah oh oh oh oh oh

She's like (my favourite song like)
She's like (you know my song like)
She's like (I sing along like)
She (she)

She's like hotter than the summer sun, an angel ridin' shotgun
A devil in a sundress, sweet and sexy hot mess
She's a Carolina sunrise, California sunset
She's anything you want, man
She's like a free round of drinks at my favorite bar
She's like a new set of strings on my old guitar
She's like a pedal to the medal in my muscle car
She's a wide open road, so let's roll

She's like a hit song on the radio
And i can't escape her everywhere that I go
Shes got me singin' along when she comes on
Her memory moves me all night long
She's with me everywhere that I go
She's got me singin' like woah oh oh oh oh oh
She's got me singin' like woah oh oh oh oh oh

She keeps the party goin' all night long
If you know what I mean, then you can sing along
She keeps the party goin' all night long
And if you know what I mean, then you can sing along, sing along
