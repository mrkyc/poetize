How y'all doin'
Yeah my names Colt Ford
I got my boy Brantley Gilbert in here
We just some country boys from Georgia
We gonna do a little something 'bout the dirt roads that we come from
I'm gonna rap a little bit, you feel like singin'
Yeah brother
Let's go

Yeah I'm chillin' on a dirt road
Laid back swervin' like I'm George Jones
Smoke rollin' out the window
An ice cold beer sittin' in the console
Memory lane up in the headlights
It's got me reminiscin' on them good times
Sittin' turnin' off of real life drive and that's right
I'm hittin' easy street on mud tires (that's right)

Back in the day Pott's farm was the place to go
Load the truck up hit the dirt road
Jump the barbwire spread the word
Light the bonfire then call the girls
The king in the can and the Marlboro man
Jack and Jim were a few good men
When we learned how to kiss and cuss and fight too
Better watch out for the boys in blue
And all this small town he said she said
Ain't it funny how rumors spread
Like I know something y'all don't know
Man this shit is getting old
Man mind your business and watch your mouth
Before I have to knock your loud ass out
No time for talkin' y'all ain't listenin'
Them old dirt roads is what y'all missin'

I sit back and think about them good ole days
The way we were raised and our southern ways
We like cornbread and biscuits
And if it's broke 'round here we fix it
See I can take y'all where you need to go
Down to my hood, back in them woods
We do it different 'round here that's right
And we sho' do it good and we do it all night
So if you really wanna know how it feels
To get off the road and truck with four wheels
Jump on in tell your friends
And we'll be raisin' hell where the black top ends

Yeah I'm chillin' on a dirt road
Laid back swervin' like I'm George Jones
Smoke rollin' out the window
