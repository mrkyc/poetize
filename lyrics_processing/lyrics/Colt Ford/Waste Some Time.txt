I've been told I need to focus on my life
Work a little harder, do my part, start livin' right
Ain't got the answers, but I think I seen the light
'Cause since I met you, all I wanna do
Is waste some time, waste some time, waste some time
Waste some time, waste some time, waste some time
Waste some time, waste some time, waste some time
Waste some time, waste some time, waste some time

Now I'm a three hundred pound redneck rebel
I'm a God-fearin' man, who's had to dance with devil
The Lord I pray my soul to take
If I should ever die before I wake
But see, right now I just wanna love and live
And show this country girl what I got to give
The whole heap and helpin' of some country fun
Full of four wheel drives, dirt roads and shotguns
Ain't nothin' better than bein' out in the woods
With Nic and Nappy Roots and blazin' that good good
Lord I'ma tell you we're doin' it just right
Got my plow boy bunny right by my side
This is me and my girl and ol' Sick Em Sam
In a flatbed Ford off of Copperhead Dam
Listen to Jaime sing that lonesome song
It's all just right, y'all can keep the wrong
Come on

I've been told I need to focus on my life
Work a little harder, do my part, start livin' right (Gonna do my part)
Ain't got the answers, but I think I seen the light (Yeah)
'Cause since I met you, all I wanna do (Uh, what, let's go)
Is waste some time

With my feet up (Uh), lawn chair beat up (Yeah)
I'm on my third six pack, player can you keep up
Gotta ride deep in the sticks, wanna see us
Front yard golf field bought 'em, wanna tee up
Cataracts here tell Jenny go re-up
Bulldog fan every truck throw a G up (That's right)
Hospital, school and the church one street up (Yeah)
Talk more proper when the city folks greet us
Tired of goin' to jail so I learned how to chill
Me and the lil' lady have a ball at the crill
Friends and a keg and the country boy meal
I should write a menu how a country boy live
Luck no love, or bucks no buck
Someone hand me a ball and a truck-boat-truck (Yup)
I've never been rich but I really don't want much
Just a roof and some good liquor in my cup

I've been told I need to focus on my life (That's right)
Work a little harder, do my part, start livin' right (Gonna do my part)
Ain't got the answers, but I think I seen the light
'Cause since I met you, all I wanna do
Is waste some time
I got five on the wood, twenty on the keg
I been left the hood, yep I did what I said
Momma I'm good 'bout as cool as they come
We cooked the whole hog and love chicken where I'm from
I used to be the bomb, now to think I'm fresh
Still rock my same jeans and keep the liquor to myself
Got a little wealth so I gotta thank the Lord
Couldn't do it by myself, got some help from Colt Ford
Now we in the Ford, and we travelin' on a gravel road
He said he knew a spot, where the music and the liquor flow
And of course I'm down like four flats
Drove a country mile, took a left to be exact
Led us smack dab in the middle of the sticks
Now I had seen a lot of things, but nothin' like this (hey)
A bunch of pretty women, nothin' less than a dime
Colt Ford and Nappy Roots so you know we gonna waste some time

I've been told I need to focus on my life
Work a little harder, do my part, start livin' right
Ain't got the answers, but I think I seen the light
'Cause since I met you, all I wanna do
Is waste some time

Waste some time, waste some time, waste some time
Waste some time, waste some time, waste some time (hah)
Thank you baby, we're gonna waste some time
Waste some time, waste some time, yeah
That's all we're gonna do, that's all we're gonna do
