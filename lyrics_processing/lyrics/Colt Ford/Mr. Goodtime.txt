Ooh yeah
I got two shot glasses and a bottle of tequila
With nothin' but time on my hands
I got my boots on tight and some money for the jukebox
So tell me if you're ready to dance

I said hey good looking what's on your mind
Is there something I can help you find?
She said I'm lookin' for a man for me and my kids
I said honey he ain't here but a good time is (good time is)
She smiled and asked me if could show her one
I said take my hand darlin' let's start the fun
I asked her name and she asked me mine
I said honey they call me Mr. Goodtime

I got two shot glasses and a bottle of tequila
With nothing but time on my hands
I got my boots on tight and some money for the jukebox
So tell me if you're ready to dance
I got a four wheel drive parked right outside
And you can feel when it comes to speed
So if you're lookin' for that good time
Baby get with it take my hand
And just come to me
