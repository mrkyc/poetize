Let me tell you a little story 'bout how I was raised
Every day work, every day pray
God, family, friends, yeah everybody sins
A winner never quits, and a quitter never wins
Helps folks in need, don't fall for greed
A jealous man is weak so think before you speak
If you love 'em let 'em know, if you hate let it go
Fast can be fun, but sometimes you need slow
God is all good, the devil is so real
So listen up y'all cause this is how I feel

I won't back up, I don't back down
I've been raised up to stand my ground
Take my job but not my guns
Tax my check 'til I ain't got none
Except for the good Lord up above
I answer to no one

See I'm a flag flyin' bible totin' son of a gun
Yeah I'm hell on the heart just a rebel on the run
Scared don't know it, fear don't feel it
The truth is the light, sometimes you gotta fight
Good beats bad, right beats wrong
I'm a bar room preacher and this is my song
I'm climbin' for the top, representin' for the country
I'm the people's champ right out the deer camp
Shotgun toter, republican voter
Hank Jr supporter, let's protect our border
To hell with anyone who don't believe in the USA
'Cause this is what I say
See Colt Ford LiveGet tickets as low as $54You might also like
I won't back up, I don't back down
I've been raised up to stand my ground
Take my job but not my guns
Tax my check 'til I ain't got none
Except for the good Lord up above
I answer to no one

Give me my right to vote
My right to tote
The weapon of my choice
Don't censor my voice
Hate me if you want or love me if you can
If the truth is what you want then you found your man
I ain't backin' down, I ain't backin' up
If you think like I think, then crank it on up

I won't back up, I don't back down
I've been raised up to stand my ground
Take my job but not my guns
Tax my check 'til I ain't got none
Except for the good Lord up above
I answer to no one
