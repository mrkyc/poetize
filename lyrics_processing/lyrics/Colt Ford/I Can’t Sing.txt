Too easy
Lord I can't sing (I can't sing)
But I'm tryin' (but I'm tryin')
To give my country folks
Somethin' they gon' like (somethin' they gon' like)
But if you don't (if you don't)
Well then I'm sorry (then I'm sorry)
Meet me outback when I'm done
And we can fight (we can fight)

I'm just here to do me the only way I know
And I guarantee ya folks it's a hell of a show (hell of a show)
See me and my boys are a rowdy bunch
Yes ma'am I get drunk and throw the first punch
Old Colt's a ring leader, he ain't yelled at me
Been know to raise hell from LA to Tennessee (damn right)
So don't get outta line 'cause we don't take no crap
We're just here to drink beer and do some country rap (woo)

Lord I can't sing (I can't sing)
But I'm tryin' (but I'm tryin')
To give my country folks
Somethin' they gon' like (somethin' they gon' like)
But if you don't (if you don't)
Well then I'm sorry (then I'm sorry)
Meet me outback when I'm done
And we can fight (we can fight)
See Colt Ford LiveGet tickets as low as $54You might also like
Y'all never thought that I can do it like this
It ain't country twang when I do my thing (woo)
See I work from sun up to sun down (yes)
You better be ready when I come to your town (timeless)
'Cause me and my boys we can do it all night (that's right)
And we gon' party 'til we see the sunlight (that's right)
So fire up the grill, ice the beer
And tell your friends that they could meet us
Down the road where the blacktop ends (woo)

Lord I can't sing (I can't sing)
But I'm tryin' (but I'm tryin')
To give my country folks
Somethin' they gon' like (somethin' they gon' like)
But if you don't (if you don't)
Well then I'm sorry (then I'm sorry)
Meet me outback when I'm done
And we can fight (we can fight)

Well this here's the last verse 'bout time to leave
A redneck rap song I know it's hard to believe
But I was raised on Conway And Willie (woo)
Sugar Hill Gang, and Run DMC
So hell what'd ya think, it was bound to happen
'Bout time for someone to do some country rappin' (yep)
Give the whole world a taste of Colt Ford (yes sir)
So pass the ammunition and praise the Lord
Lord I can't sing (I can't sing)
But I'm tryin' (but I'm tryin')
To give my country folks
Somethin' they gon' like (somethin' they gon' like)
But if you don't (if you don't)
Well then I'm sorry (then I'm sorry)
Meet me outback when I'm done
And we can fight (we can fight)
Lord I can't sing (I can't sing)
But I'm tryin' (but I'm tryin')
To give my country folks
Somethin' they gon' like (somethin' they gon' like)
But if you don't (if you don't)
Well then I'm sorry (then I'm sorry)
Meet me outback when I'm done
