I got a cricket on the line and a bottle of shine
A whippoorwill whistlin' everything is fine
I got my plow boy bunny sittin' by my side
What else does a country boy need to survive

Let me hear you say hey we want some country
Hey we want some country
Let me hear you say hey want some country

Hey y'all it's me again
Time to get it on for my country friends
Got girls, got trucks, got mud
Y'all know whats up
Do you wanna know what its like to sip some
Moonshine by the moon light
Well come on down, well show you around
Load up the truck, take you into town
Head to miss betty's lunch is ready
Stop by the house, get mom and daddy
Drop em off there at the Walmart
Got to get to the lake before it gets dark
Load the boat in
Call my friends
Make the first left when the black top ends
Ease on back bout a mile or two
Then you can see just what we do

The boat in the cove then follow me to that castle
Gonna buzz all night and not worry bout a thing
Get your every move back run and ride moonshine's a candy thing
I got that apple pie moonshine blackberry muscadine
Country folks down get ready to ride
Got a cricket on the line and I'm feeling fine
Swamp land farmer's tan
Beer and a cane pole in my hand
Guess y'all would say I'm a Average Joe
