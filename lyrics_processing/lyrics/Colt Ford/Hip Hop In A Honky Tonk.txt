Red light, Friday night, headin' to town
I had some George Strait crankin' with the windows down
'Til this Escalade thumpin' bass, drowneded him out
He was rattlin' his rims and shakin' the ground, aw haw
I put my foot on the gas I didn't have to go far
I found this funky little steel and fiddle redneck bar
The band was in the middle of "You're Cheatin' Heart"
I bought a bag of tater chips and a PBR
Settled down on a stool plannin' on stayin'
But when they took a break the DJ started playin'

Hip hop in a honky tonk
Wait a minute hold the phone somethin's wrong
I came in here to hear a country song
Not hip hop in a honky tonk

Now what do you think ole Hank would say
It'd kill 'em if he still was alive today?
I bet money that he's rollin' over in his grave
'Cause Hank sure as hell didn't do it that way

Hip hop in a honky tonk
I'll give you twenty bucks if you turn that shit off
If you ask me it ought to be outlawed
Hip hop in a honky tonk
See Colt Ford LiveGet tickets as low as $54You might also like
When all of a sudden every girl in the club
Got on the floor startin' shakin' her butt
It was packed, it was stacked from the front to the back
This cowboy ain't seen nothin' like that

Hip hop in a honky tonk
They were dancin' like strippers but they kept their clothes on
I'm startin' to think that I might been wrong about
Hip hop in a honky tonk
'Cause when they move like that I'll watch em all night long
Hip hop in a honky tonk
I gotta admit I'm havin' second thoughts about
Hip hop in a honky tonk
I came in here to hear a country song, but I'm diggin'
