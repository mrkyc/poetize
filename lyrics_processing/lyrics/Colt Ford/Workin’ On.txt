Chasing after that dollar like it'll slow down my hurry
Settle all my worries when I get it in my wallet
Quit dippin' long enough to own a pair of jeans
That don't have a ring in the back left pocket
Laughin' at myself, admitting when I'm wrong
That's what this good ol' boy's gonna go out workin' on

Workin' on comin' to Jesus, kickin' the bottle
Wrestlin' with our roots
Tryin' to turn off Mama's tears, and fill our Daddy's boots
Shuttin' off our pride, fixin' bridges we burned, learnin' how to live and learn
Keepin' our demons down and our trucks up and runnin'
Lovin' them angels sittin' pretty in the middle of 'em
Fightin' with the man in the mirror 'til we gone
Yeah, that's what all us good ol' boys gonna go out workin' on
Gonna go out workin' on

Givin' more forgiveness, pickin' battles worth choosing
Little less cussin' and losin' my temper and my tools
Dialin' down my restless, outgrowin' my reckless
And my reputation for breakin' hearts and rules
Realizin' what I got what I got 'fore it's gone
That's what this good ol' boy's gonna go out workin' on

Owning up to my weakness, keepin' it humble but strong
Doin' the best I can with this flesh and bone
