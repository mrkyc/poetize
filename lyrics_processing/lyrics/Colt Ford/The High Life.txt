Feelin' good, feelin' nice, we can do it all night
Ain't nothin' wrong, naw we just rollin' along
Livin' the high life, yeah
Livin' the high life

Let me paint this picture for ya, small town on a Friday night
Football and a Facebook party, one post tell everybody
Win or lose, we're still gonna crank it
Mix it up, I bet we drink it
Don't worry, know what we doin'
Head home when the sun starts movin'
No sleep gotta get to work quick
Good Lord that girl was worth it
That kiss sure had me buzzin'
That kiss got my boss cussin'
It's alright, I'ma get this job one
Later on she'll be ridin' shotgun
My life, high life is perfect
My truck, my girl, all worth it

Feelin' good, feelin' nice, we can do it all night
Movin' and groovin' to the flow of a favorite song
Bass bumpin', beat's tight, everybody gettin' right
Hands in the air and we're singin' along
Bottle tops poppin', the cameras ain't stoppin'
Tailgates droppin', this whole town's rockin'
Yeah we're feelin' good, feelin' nice, we can do it all night
Ain't nothin' wrong, no, we're just rollin' along
Livin' the high life

Sheriff Thompson said Scott just got home
Spent 18 months in Iraq
Gonna pick him up and get gone
Gonna raise a little hell 'cause he's back
You gotta make time for your friends
You gotta make time for your work
You gotta find a girl you can love, live life for all that it's worth
Everyday I thank God for it, this life is such a blessing
Escape that concrete jungle, come see what y'all been missin'

Feelin' good, feelin' nice, we can do it all night
Movin' and groovin' to the flow of a favorite song
Bass bumpin', beat's tight, everybody gettin' right
Hands in the air and we're singin' along
Bottle tops poppin', the cameras ain't stoppin'
Tailgates droppin', this whole town's rockin'
Yeah we're feelin' good, feelin' nice, we can do it all night
Ain't nothin' wrong, no, we're just rollin' along

Sunday you gotta head to dinner
Grandma done made them biscuits
Fried chicken that's finger lickin'
Front porch little guitar pickin'
Sweet tea and apple pie, country girl right by my side
So right it can't be wrong, wanna hear y'all sing along
Feelin' good, feelin' nice, we can do it all night
Movin' and groovin' to the flow of a favorite song
Bass bumpin', beat's tight, everybody gettin' right
Hands in the air and we're singin' along
Bottle tops poppin', the cameras ain't stoppin'
Tailgates droppin', this whole town's rockin'
Yeah we're feelin' good, feelin' nice, we can do it all night
