Don't take my kindness for weakness, oh no
Don't take my silence for ignorance, oh no
So if you're into steppin' over lines, stompin' on my way of life
There's two things you need to know
We don't retreat, we reload

Always into givin' a helpin' hand, but never take a handout
Shakin' hands to sign a deal, that's what we're still about
Keep sweat on our brow and dirt on our plow
In hopes for makin' a future for the ones that we care about
It's a tradition, passed down like hand-me-down jeans with stitches
That humble background is rollin' through our system, flowin' like a river
Bred to be a hero and never play the victim
Never start nothin', but we will finish it
So don't be so quick to run your lips
'Cause you could get slapped by the same hand that I woulda helped you with
Somebody tell 'em

Don't take my kindness for weakness, oh no
Don't take my silence for ignorance, oh no
So if you're into steppin' over lines, stompin' on my way of life
There's two things you need to know
We don't retreat, we reload

A lot of times we don't speak, we just listen
Silence is a virtue, try it and find out what you been missin'
Although we keep our distance, I peek over the fence
And think the world needs a little John Wayne in it
Respect is earned, we say ma'am and sir
Salute those who served, 'cause it's well deserved
The first to call you out if you're lyin'
But the last to kick ya out if you're tryin'
We're the worst folks to those who kick us when we're down
But the best to those who've always been around
Friends for life, trespassers get shot once
Survivors shot twice

Don't take my kindness for weakness, oh no
Don't take my silence for ignorance, oh no
So if you're into steppin' over lines, stompin' on my way of life
There's two things you need to know
We don't retreat, we reload
