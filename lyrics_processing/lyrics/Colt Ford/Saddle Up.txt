You thought your boy Colt Ford was just a country clown
That bails hay all day and don't know how to get down
Ain't none of y'all messin' with this country sound
Them boys sent me with some new country
We rock Fords and lift kits with gun racks and mud on 'em
Ain't scared of nothin' so don't push the button
Like them long legged girls with curls and tight jeans
And they love cold beer 'round here with chicken wings
Baby this new country is all about me
But I love some Johnny Cash, Waylon, and Willie
Respect the old school and make room for the new
Now tell me you don't love what this country boy can do
Go get the skoal spit with the lighter style
Big boy so cool I make all them girls smile
So tell me what you need and old Colt will make it happen
Things is changin' we got a country boy rappin'

When they talk about the south they call it dirty baby (dirty baby)
We was raised on cheese grits biscuits and gravy (gravy)
We say sir and ma'am and we don't give a damn
If you like it or not we gonna hold our spot (yes sir)
Give me Crown and Coke or maybe Jack and Sprite
A case of Coors Light and it's on tonight (it's on)
We talking about a party down on Johnson's farm
Late night country trouble we don't mean no harm (no harm)
That's just how we do so tell me what you want (what you want)
Some say they will but still most won't (no they don't)
Keep it bangin' 'til the sun come up
Hear the rooster crow then it's time to go (let's go)
Got horses that need breakin' and cows that need pennin'
I do what it takes to keep them girls grinnin' (hey baby)
Every girl crazy about a bow legged boy (that's right)
In tight jeans and boots that rope rides and chutes

Hey it's a party baby get your swerve on (swerve on)
You wanna come get your boots put your spurs on (spurs on)

Go on and spread the word we about to have a hoe down (hey)
It's a party at Colt crib baby come by (come by)
You wanna saddle up (hey) I'll give you one try (one try)
And you a cowgirl so I know you know
How to hold on and ride like the rodeo
We ain't done yet (naw) your pretty silhouette (hey)
I'm hopin' me and you can ride off in the sunset
I wanna get you all alone (alone) girl I can't wait to
Get you to my home I've got 35 acres
It's not quite 40 but I'm hung like a mule (like a mule)
And if you got some friends then they can come too
We do it like they do it on the ponderosa
With a bunch of alcohol and our guns in holsters
