It's the mudslingin' country singin' redneck stunner
I'ma show you who I am if you really think you wanna
Take a ride down the dirty road, show ya where the still is
Scared stay at home son, this is where the real is
Folks 'round her still believe in God
And the right to tote a gun and our flag don't run
Ain't askin' you for nothin' if we can't get it on our own
Tell the government to leave my check and church alone
Y'all can do y'all and we'll do us
And our money should always say in god we trust
So if you think like that, then you one of us
If not then move on and leave us alone
'Cause country folk can survive, just ask Hank
Leave my money in my pocket y'all can have the bank
I'm tryna tell you that we smarter than some of y'all think
Even though we talk slow all of y'all should know that

This is our song everybody sing it
Clap your hands y'all and do it like you mean it
We stand our ground and we don't back down
If you're from a small town and you're never gonna leave it
This is our song everybody sing it
Clap your hands y'all and do it like you mean it
We stand our ground and we don't back down
And if you don't like it then don't come around
See Colt Ford LiveGet tickets as low as $54You might also like
We come from hardworking people, they can't stand a thief
Don't like a liar, freezer full of deer meat
Home grown tomatoes in the kitchen window
Daddy is a deacon, mama sings swing low
At the church in the choir, Sunday dinners on the fire
Colt Ford Danny Boone gettin' mud up on the tires
We represent our folks don't take us for a joke
We got a cooler full of boo and a pocket full of smoke
Yeah we country as cornbread, and bumpin' Nappy Roots
And if it ain't a funeral we ain't gon' wear a suit
We peein' off the front porch, peein' off the back
'Cause we livin' in the boonies and they don't know where we at
Can't market us urban, won't market us rural
Drinkin' moonshine 'til we drunk and seein' plural
Small town livin' and we don't give a damn
If yo hollywood or not, 'causewe know who we am

This is our song everybody sing it
Clap your hands y'all and do it like you mean it
We stand our ground and we don't back down
If you're from a small town and you're never gonna leave it
This is our song everybody sing it
Clap your hands y'all and do it like you mean it
We stand our ground and we don't back down
And if you don't like it then don't come around
Ain't it funny how the money change who you is
Sell your soul to the devil be a star in this biz
Give up everything so you can play this game
Make a buncha folks happy that don't know yo name
Don't worry 'bout me, 'cause I'ma spit the truth
See I gotta represent for our country youth
And keep hope alive, 'cause I will survive
With a shotgun baby and a four wheel drive
I'm buck huntin' dog runnin' playin' in a mud hole
Bumping'Johnny Cash, haulin' ass down a back road
Love it in the country where my soul is free
In god and my family is all I need, sing it

This is our song everybody sing it
Clap your hands y'all and do it like you mean it
We stand our ground and we don't back down
If you're from a small town and you're never gonna leave it
This is our song everybody sing it
Clap your hands y'all and do it like you mean it
We stand our ground and we don't back down
