I got a copper still hand built up in the hills
Fill it up with corn mash, heat it up, and chill
White liquor hits you quicker, knock you off your feet
Lay down your mason jars, you can't outshine me

I'ma put it out here, let me tell y'all something
What do y'all think my still be pumpin'
90 proof, spit the truth
Stop tellin' everybody you can do what I do
So if you can, you better get like me
Go sit down and write a hit like me
From where I stand you ain't shit to me
Gotta sell a few mil outta your own still
I won't sugar coat it, burn your throat
Scared stay scared, I'm locked and loaded
Real is all me, they all can feel me
Dirt road the steeple, man of the people
Mix it, churn it, light it, burn it
Daylight to dark, me and my folks earn it
Plow it, haul it, hunt it, shoot it, skin it, fry it
That's how we do it
Sip it, chug it, jar it, jug it
Do a little better than anyone else does it

Y'all are chasin' a thoroughbred
Y'all done got lapped out miles ahead
Too late to slow down, I'm a runaway train
Colt Ford, remember my name
Haters, Tweeters, bloggers, bashers
Watch your mouth 'cause I run these pastures

Fill it up with corn mash, heat it up, and chill

I can't take this, I wanna make this real clear
What do y'all think I've been doin' here
Switchin' gears and changin' lanes
Jackin' up trucks, runnin' down lames
Light that flame for America
Cross that line I'm darin' ya
I got a shotgun that'll take care of ya
And a mud hole that I'll bury ya
Gotta bunch of county folks all down to ride
And a bunch of rednecks ain't scared to fight
I'ma give it to ya my way, dirt road, highway
Four-wheel, jack it up, talk shit, back it up
Y'all a trip and I'm out of your league
Sippin' shine and I'm hard to see
I'm somethin' you'll never be
It's a pipe dream, you can't outshine me
'Cause I'm dura-coated, turbo charged
Everything about me is large
Y'all keep chasin' a thoroughbred
Y'all done got lapped out miles ahead
I will never slow down, I'm a runaway train
