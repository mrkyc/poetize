I got a cricket on the line and a bottle of shine
A whippoorwill whistlin' everything is fine
I got my plow boy bunny sittin' by my side
What else does a country boy need to survive

Let me hear ya say hey we want some country
Hey we want some country
Let me hear ya say hey we want some country
Hey we want some country

Hey y'all, its me again
Time to get it on with my country friends
Got girls, got trucks, got mud y'all know whats up
Do you wanna know what it's like to
Sip some moonshine by the moonlight
Well come on down, we'll show you 'round
Load up the truck, take you into town
Head to Miss Bettys lunch is ready
Stop by the house, gettin' mom and daddy
Drop 'em off there at the Walmart
Got to get to the lake before it gets dark
Load the boat in call my friends
Make the first left when the black top ends
Ease on back 'bout a mile or two
Then you can see just what we do

Lord have mercy here we are
In the middle of field who needs a bar
This here is a country party
Y'all get drunk and be somebody
I know you like my southern drawl
How I say yes ma'am and y'all
That's in my DNA
Good god ol' mighty is what I say
When I see those skirts and boots
Fat bottomed girls in them daisy dukes
They sweeter then momma's cobbler
Hold on a minute somethingss pullin' on my bobber
I think I got a bite
Heat the grease up fish fry tonight
So if you wanna see me and Rhett
Somewhere in the country is your best bet
I got a cricket on the line and a bottle of shine
A whippoorwill whistlin' everything is fine
I got my plow boy bunny sittin' by my side
