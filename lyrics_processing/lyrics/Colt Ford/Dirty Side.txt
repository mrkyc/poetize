Oh-oh ohh-oh-oh ohh-oh-oh ohh-oh-oh

I'm thinkin' 'bout the perfect girl, she gotta have a dirty side
I'm talkin' 'bout four wheel hoppin' inside my truck with a flirty side
She don't even dust seat off, she sippin' on a Yoo-hoo
Then a kiss on my right cheek, that's right that's what we do
Head out to the field, check them trees stands the food plots
Little further back in the trees, tailgate talk 'bout the birds and bees
Might even put the boat in and do a little crappie fishin'
I got the motor trollin', my girl is happy fishin'
She can catch 'em, skin 'em, fry 'em, what y'all know about that
Pretty good with a shotgun and a bow I'm for sure about that
All you boys better get you one that'll change your world
Ain't nothin' better then a dirty side of country girl

All my girls out there put your hands up high
If you ain't scared to show your dirty side
I love a girl with a dirty side (girl with a dirty side)
Yeah I got a girl with a dirty side (girl with a dirty side)
To my boys out there with me tonight
Lookin' for a country girl with a dirty side
I love a girl with a dirty side (girl with a dirty side)
Yeah I got a girl with a dirty side

I'm talkin' 'bout the perfect girl, man I'ma tell you they everywhere
Stop lookin' in magazines head on out to the county fair
Go look at the Walmart down any aisle at the supermarket
Field party on a Friday night, pull right up throw it in park and
Look around for the dusty boots, tan legs, cherry lips
Smile that'll make Jesus blush, faded denim hangin' on her hips
She can change her own oil, it's rodeos and football games
She plow her own soil, warm your soul when she calls your name
She pretty like her mama, got a piece of her daddy's tough
Ain't scared of a little drama, ain't scared of a little mud
You better go get you one, I guarantee it will blow your mind
Make sure she got a dirty side, you'll understand why I got mine

Keep your uptown socialite
All I want on a Friday night
Is a girl with a dirty side, I like a girl with a dirty side
Tore up jeans and dusty boots
Still in touch with them backroad roots
That's a girl with a dirty side, I love a girl with a dirty side, uh
