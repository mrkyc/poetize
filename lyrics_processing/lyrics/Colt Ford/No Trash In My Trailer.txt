Yes I live in a single wide
To get up here it takes a four wheel drive
Got a mean ass dog whose name is Sickem Sam
I got a motor hangin' from a tree
A satellite dish and a trampoline
A sixty-eight red chevelle
Been known to raise a little hell
All night, bar fight
Some of y'all say I ain't liven right
Eat butter beans and fried Spam
But I ain't what you all say I am

'Cause there ain't no trash in my trailer
Though you might find an empty can of beer
No there ain't been no trash in my trailer oh no
Since the day I threw you out of here

I burn my trash in a drum
Sometimes I shoot my gun
I'm mud boggin', camouflagin'
A ball game is what I'm watchin'
I work hard, mow the yard, fish, hunt, knuckle scar
Change oil, plow the soil, love a boat country boy
I wear a suit to church and stuff
And Daddy's the one that made me tough
He told me son
Don't be ashamed of who you are and our family name
I'm makin' it proud, sayin' it loud
Doin' my thing with a country crowd
I tell you the truth and don't give a damn
But I ain`t what you all say I am

'Cause there ain't no trash in my trailer
Though you might find an empty can of beer
No there ain't been no trash in my trailer oh no
Since the day I threw you out of here
Go on bring a little trash here for me boys
No there ain't no trash in my trailer
Though you might find an empty can of beer
No there ain't been no trash in my trailer oh no
Since the day I threw you out of here
No there's no trailer trash livin' here

It's pretty damn spotless around here now Uncle Mike
