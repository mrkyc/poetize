Gonna take a little, gonna take a little
Gonna take a little slow ride baby

Take a little slow ride
We got nothin' but time to lose
We gonna ride it all night
Yeah, baby just me and you
'Bout to turn off the map like we ain't comin' back
Leave it all up in that rearview
And take a little slow ride tonight
Tonight, we gonna take a little slow ride

Hey pretty girl come on jump in
Don't tell nobody where we goin'
That fast life got me slowin' down
Let's leave this town behind
I'm talkin' L-O-S-T
You'll always get the B-E-S-T
My God, girl you're so hot
Let's find that spot where we can let our hair down
Forget that truth or dare town
Just let that moonlight stare down on us
'Cause he won't tell (Nah)
Hell this old truck got half a tank
That Mason jar's full of shine
Tell me girl now what you think
I'm yours, yeah baby let's ride

'Bout to turn off the map like we ain't comin' back
Leave it all up in that rearview
And take a little slow ride tonight
Tonight, we gonna take a little slow ride

Let's stop for a second and think about it
Better yet I think we should drink about it
That he-she that you-me
Ain't no other place we gotta be
Just out here livin' our best life
Forget that everyday stress life
It's gonna be one of those best nights
Talkin' better than the rest nights
'Cause all I wanna do is just slide up next to you
Find that shootin' star, make wishes
Good Lord I love them kisses
'Cause girl you're the only one for me
No need for us to hide
Let's turn you and I into we and us
Come on baby let's ride
Baby let's take a little slow ride
We got nothin' but time to lose
We gonna ride it all night
Yeah, baby just me and you
'Bout to turn off the map like we ain't comin' back
Leave it all up in that rearview
And take a little slow ride tonight
Tonight, we gonna take a little slow ride

Gonna take a little, gonna take a little (Oh, yeah)
Gonna take a little slow ride baby (Gonna take a little slow ride)
Gonna take a little, gonna take a little (Oh, yeah)
Gonna take a little slow ride

Take a little slow ride
We got nothin' but time to lose (Oh, we got nothin' but time)
We gonna ride it all night
Yeah, baby just me and you (Oh baby, just me and you)
'Bout to turn off the map like we ain't comin' back
Leave it all up in that rearview
And take a little slow ride tonight (Baby just take a little slow ride)
Tonight, we gonna take a little slow ride
Gonna take a little, gonna take a little
Gonna take a little slow ride baby
Gonna take a little, gonna take a little
Gonna take a little slow ride baby
Take a little slow ride tonight
