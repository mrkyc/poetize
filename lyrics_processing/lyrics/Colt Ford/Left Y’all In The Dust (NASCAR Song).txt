Gentlemen (gentlemen, gentlemen)
Start your engines (start your engines)

Race for the rubber, turnin' my fast car
Racin' to the Sprint Cup 'cause I'm NASCAR
Call me Robby, Jeff, or Dale Earnhardt
Gentlemen, start your engines, it's NASCAR
Number one, I'll never be the last car
Finish line's all mine 'cause I'm NASCAR
Sorry, it's time to go party
Left y'all in the dust

Sprint Cup from Daytona to Talladega
Colt Ford gear shiftin' at the Bristol speedway
You can call me Jimmie Johnson, board leader all day
Got the Chevy engine rumblin' a car without keys
Five hundred laps to go, and the track is all me
Too many sponsors on my car from Kellogg's to Kraft Cheese (Kraft Cheese)
That's me walkin' in wants to win
My game plan is simple, son I came to win
Just give me a Budweiser, this one for Rough Rider
Runnin' loose past the signal just like spent wires (spent wires)
Chase to Bank America, my gas tank full now
See the checker flag drop, I'm feelin' good now
Foot to the pedal, asphalt touchin' rubber
Used to watch Richard Petty growin' up, I learned from it (learned from it)
My pit crew sick too, it's like Amazing Grace
I say a prayer 'fore the helmet touch my face

I wanna go fast, it's either first or last
So we can bang and trade paint if you're tryin' to pass
I feel the need for speed, guess I was born to do it
It's a crash in turn three, pick a line and drive through it
My fuel's gettin' low, but I got to go
This is NASCAR baby, ain't no time for slow
If you wanna come get it, we could walk the ground
But I'm here for one thing, and that's the finish line
Runnin' side by side with Smoke and Kurt Busch
See me haulin kinda fast, can't stop, I gotta push
Casey Mears and Mark Martin in the outside groove
Kasey Kahne goin' low, but they all too slow
Old Colt got the lead with twenty laps to go
See ya all at victory lane where they pop the champagne
Dodge and Toyota, even Chevy and Ford
I love 'em all, baby doll, when the pedal's to the floor
Race for the rubber, turnin' my fast car
Racin' to the Sprint Cup 'cause I'm NASCAR
Call me Robby, Jeff, or Dale Earnhardt

Hey, Colt
You look pretty good out there, buddy
I'm comin', baby
I know you wanna win
I came to win
You got to slow down
You're all over the track
Don't crash that car
You'll be in trouble if you crash that car
Don't worry about it son, I got it
How far back are they?
I don't know, just slow down
I can't slow down baby, this is NASCAR
