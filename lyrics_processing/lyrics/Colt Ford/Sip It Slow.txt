Feel the grass up between your toes
Take a deep breath for a minute
Sip it slow, something this good you gotta make last
If you let it slip by too fast, you gonna wish you didn't miss it
Sip it slow

How's it son, I was just like you when I was there
Always in a hurry growin' up I thought it wasn't fair
Livin' fast like every moment might just be the last
See it's the future that you want, who really needs the past
Makin' something outta nothin' that's what life's about
You keep the devil at your back even when you doubt
See it's your life son turn it up and let it rip
And don't forget to take a breath and just

Sip it slow, kick back and let the cool breeze blow
Feel the grass up between your toes
Take a deep breath for a minute
Sip it slow, something this good you gotta make last
If you let it slip by too fast, you gonna wish you didn't miss it
Sip it slow

Son I ain't preachin' I'm just teachin' lessons that I've learned
Cause I promised God that I would guide you each and every turn

Sometimes you turn the other cheek sometimes you gotta fight
You be a friend to a friend when they need you to
And I'll stand by you 'til the end and help to see it through
See its your life son turn it up and let it rip

Love the journey of your life son but don't forget
To take a breath, sit back and just reminisce
