See, me and my ole lady, we been fightin' a bunch
I ain't quite for sure, but I got me a hunch
Now I know I been drinkin', but I'm thinkin' kinda clear
This here's the truth, and I ain't leavin' this booth
'Til I tell everybody exactly what she done
I done called my boy John, told him bring my gun
I'm tryin' to figure out exactly what went wrong
Workin' daylight to dark to give her a nice home
I never been the type to ask for too much
Just a meal now and then and sometimes a slow touch
Tell me what to do, man what do ya think?
Know the waitress and the cook, and they don't care if we drink
I'm just tryin' to make sense outta all this
Lord, I'm not a violent man, but the gun's in my hand
Should I stay or should I go
Or just let it be? Lord, the cheatin' woman gon' be the death of me
So, uh

Meet me at the Waffle House
It's goin' down
I just found out my ole lady's been messin' around
Meet me at the Waffle House
Bring me my gun
Need someone to talk to before I hurt someone

Man, my whole world is upside down
I guess I'm 'bout to be the laughin' stock of the town
I heard from my cousin it's a dozen or more
I found the sheriff's badge on the bedroom floor
Ole boy from church said he saw her with the preacher
Forty miles from here at a bar drinkin' beer
She told me that she was havin' some lunch with her sister
I was home cleanin' up and wishin' I didn't miss her
See, love will bring you home, but lies brought me here
Heard her and the town judge been at it for a year
I reckon you can't make a whore a housewife
But I dang sure tried even when she lied
Now I'm sittin' here starin' at this plate of grits
Thinkin' about goin' to put a bullet in that bitch
Maybe I should shoot everyone of them fellas
But come to think of it, son I really ain't jealous
Matter fact, let me thank y'all for makin' it clear
Hell, fix me a patty melt, John pour me a beer
I'm scattered, smothered, and happy to be free
To hell with cheap women, y'all heard it from me
So, uh

Meet me at the Waffle House
It's goin' down
I just found out my ole lady's been messin' around
Meet me at the Waffle House
Bring me my gun
Need someone to talk to before I hurt someone
Meet me at the one off 28
My gun's in the closet
Underneath my Johnny Cash tapes
And grab that moonshine sittin' on the freezer
It's gonna ease the pain
The next time I see her

Meet me at the Waffle House
It's goin' down
I just found out my ole lady's been messin' around
Meet me at the Waffle House
Bring me my gun
