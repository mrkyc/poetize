Love is the more excellent way
But if I don't have love, I'm just a clanging cymbal
Love is the more excellent way
I could have the faith to remove the mountains
Love is the more excellent way
But if I don't have love, then I have nothing
Love is the more excellent way
Love is patient, love is kind
Love is humble all of the time
Not easily angered
Enduring the test
So never forget
Love is the more excellent way
I could have the gift of prophecy
Love is the more excellent way
But if I don't have love, does it profit me?
Love is the more excellent way
(Love is the way)
I could understand all mystery
Talk about love
But if I don't have love
It's not enough you see
Love is the more excellent way

Love is humble all of the time

So never forget
Love is the more excellent way
(Love is the way)
I could throw my body into the flames
Love is the more excellent way
But if I don't have love, I don't have anything
Love is the more excellent way
(You gotta have love)
I could give to the poor everything I own
Love is the more excellent way
But a heart without love is just a heart of stone
Love is the more excellent way
Love is patient, love is kind
Love is humble all of the time
Not easily angered, enduring the test
So never forget
Love is the more excellent way
Love is patient, love is kind

Never let it depart
