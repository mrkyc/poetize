Unity, unity
That's what we need is more unity
God's people are an army
We're in a war against sin
But a house that is divided
Is not able to stand
We've got to ask our Heavenly Father
For a change of heart
'Cause we can do much more together
Than we can do apart
We need unity, unity

That's what we need is more unity
How pleasant it is
To dwell in harmony
But how can we walk together
Unless we agree?
We've got to build one another up
And stop tearing one another down
So put your hand in mine
To turn this world around
