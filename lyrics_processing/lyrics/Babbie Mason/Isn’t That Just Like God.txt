Lives inside the heart of me
Isn't that just like God
Isn't that just like God
The One who speaks to the waves and stormy seas
Quiets every storm in me
Isn't that just like God
Isn't that just like God
From Heaven to a manger stall
A Baby came to save us all
To conquer sin upon a cross
Isn't that just like God
Oh, isn't that just like God
(Yeah, yeah)
The eyes that see a sparrow fall
Sees my need before I call
Isn't that just like God
Isn't that just like God
When I question if He even cares
He answers my unspoken prayer
Isn't that just like God
Isn't that just like God
The hands that hold the world in place
Can feel my pin and then erase
The sin that my own soul creates
Isn't that just like God
Oh, yes, it is just like God
You might also like(No one compares to Him)
No, no, no
He's sitting up high
But He's living down low
He's everywhere but then
He's here in my heart
And He wants me to know
That I'm a living miracle
He has made my life so beautiful
Oh, yes, He has
Oh, isn't that just like God
Oh, yes, it is, I believe it is
The way He uses ordinary things
To show His might and majesty
Isn't that just like God
Oh, yes, it is, yes, it is
(Oh, yeah)
His love is such a mystery
But with the faith of a tiny mustard seed
He gives me power to believe
Isn't that just like God
Oh, yes, it is
Isn't that just like God
Isn't that just like God
(Isn't it like Him)
Isn't it, yes, it is
(Just like God)
Whoa-whoa...
Think about it
That's just like God
(Isn't it like Him)
Isn't it, yes, it is
(Just like God)
(Isn't it like Him)
