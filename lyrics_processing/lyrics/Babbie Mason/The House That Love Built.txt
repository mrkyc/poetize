The people have gathered
Weary and weak, and needing relief
From life's stormy weather
A shelter secure, for the tired and the poor
To lay down their trouble and pain
A place where the soul can finally be whole
And healing can always begin
This the house that love built
The place that love filled
The home where love will
Be the foundation forever
And the light will lead us
And faith will free us
Our hope is Jesus
And He will bind us together
With love, oh, sweet love
Somehow she stands, through shifting of sands
The church is unfailing
She's come through the fire, pulled out of the mire
But always prevailing
She's heaven on earth, and the light of the world
That grows ever brighter with time
She's built on the rock, by the power of God
And His Kingdom will never die

It lives in our hearts
Forever will stand, it's gonna stand
