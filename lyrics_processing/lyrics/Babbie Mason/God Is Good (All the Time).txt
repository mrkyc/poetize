And I know for sure that when the praises go up
The blessings will come down!

Now I don't understand, but He loves me
And He promised He would meet every need
And I know I don't deserve it, I wonder why

I'm an heir to everything in His Kingdom
Now, what could be better than that?!

Just keeps on blessing, and giving, loving, and He's living in me!
