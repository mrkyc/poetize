Come and get me right now
Cause I done lost my woman
And I need a night out
Said I can't burn it down
Cause I'm gettin up early
I'm down for one round
But around 1:30
I was sittin at a Waffle House
I think I had grits
Started hittin on a waitress
Everything after that gets fuzzy
Like a TV in a cheap motel
My head feels funny
I lost my keys
I lost my cell
And all of my money
Did I crash a party
Have a run in with the law
Take a swim in a fountain
I don't know
Cause its all kinda fuzzy
You might also likeThere's a ring on my finger
There's a bra on the lamp
Gotta get outta this hot tub
And try to find my pants
Who the hell is Heather
And when were we together
Cause I've got every letter of her name on my chest
Think I got a shiner
And a cigarette burn
Nothing in that bottle of tequila but the worm
Its fuzzy
Like static on the radio
My head feels funny
I lost my watch
I lost my clothes
And all of my money
Did I call my momma
Try to break into the mall
Did I even pay the cabby?
(Can't tell what they say here, sorry!)
I don't know
Cause its all kinda fuzzy(fuzzy)
I remember how it started
After that its just a blur
Is it a Sunday or a Monday
Am I suppose to be at work
Its fuzzy
Like a tennis ball on my tongue
My mouth feels funny
I'm blinded by the sun
But things ain't sunny
Will the room stop spinning
Will I find my car
(Can't figure it out here either)
Its all fuzzy
(fuzzy)
Oh
Its fuzzy
(fuzzy)
Its fuzzy
(its fuzzy)
