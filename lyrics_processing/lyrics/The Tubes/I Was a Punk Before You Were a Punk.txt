We drove our truck a long way there to play
We had a lot of things to think about
It didn't take too long to figure out
We never dreamed that it all would come true
Never thought that we'd have to tell you
But if you ain't found out we're definitely cool
We wrote a song about some local boys
Who had Ferrari's as their favorite toys
And their music gave their lives some hope
And their music was White Punks On Dope
We wish we could be just like them
But they didn't want to be friends
'Cause their lifestyle got scarred from living too hard
I was a punk before you were a punk
You don't believe me? Just step outside and see me baby
I was a punk before you were a punk
You want some action? I'll put your ass in traction baby
I was a punk before you were
I was a punk before you
I was a punk before you were
I was a punk before you
We were a joke at our own record label
They told us, "Make a record, if you're able"
They told us not to take too many chances
And we pissed away our big advances
The producer we got was a jerk
But White Punks was one song that worked
It was shot in the dark that just missed the mark
You might also likeWe were surprised when it caused all this rage
And they wouldn't let us take the stage
We knew we had a lot of what it takes
But we didn't get the lucky breaks
Now it's all such a great big fuss
And they all seem to copy just us
We never got reimbursed for the punks that were first
I was a punk before you were a punk
You don't believe me? Just step outside and see me baby
I was a punk before you were a punk
You want some action? I'll put your ass in traction baby
I was a punk before you were
I was a punk before you
I was a punk before you were
