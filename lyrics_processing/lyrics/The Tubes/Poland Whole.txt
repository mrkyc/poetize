Rest of the band comes heavy
Said come on, baby, oh god, oh shit
Black and white, yeah, polish sausages
In a bun, in the sun, it's hit and run
Hey man, like, like check this out
Man, really, I mean listen
I was counting the holes
In the acoustic tile ceiling, you know
Mumbling and fumbling
With them little buttons on my mattress
You know, that hold it together
So anyways my mind strays
And the tricks that my memory plays
Like fascination and abomination
On a biblical Broadway stage
Like dancers and singers
And a fully landscaped gospel group
And the harmony and whatever
And dinosaurs eating like veggie burgers
At the snack bar out front in the lobby, you know
So anyways on the same stage
Is me naked like an empty page
You might also likeThat's when I heard him
Like a director's voice with too much echo
I guess he was talking to yours truly
I mean me
Madam, that's Adam
Ain't no other woman, that's had I'm
He's stronger than a tree
That apple tree over there
Wealthy in his healthy way
Never works, he never plays
Sits around and cogitates
Right now, he's planting his garden
Like I had to hear that chorus twice
You know before I finally got the picture
I screamed, "I ain't Adam, I never seen the dude
And I ain't no virgin either"
So anyways it's really looking bad
Man, like that director's mean when he gets mad
Like, might wreck your career
With just one nod and like cripple
You, you know, for life that's a long time
My legs are shaking, my stomach's knotted
My mind has gone neurotic, I'd run if I could
But you can't hid from him
And besides that jerk took my shirt
And my trousers
So anyways in the depths of my despair
My co-star arrives, oh God, more beautiful than Cher
I screamed, "Make up, gimme the script
Please sing that chorus once more"
Madam, that's Adam
Ain't no other woman, that's Adam
He's stronger than a tree
And he's freshly molded from clay
Wealthy in his healthy way
Never works, he never plays
Sits around and cogitates
He's inventing the original sin now
Hey madam, that's Adam
