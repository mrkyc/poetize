Coming out of
Lead guitar and drums
Rest of the band comes
Heavy
Said come on baby
Oh God, oh shit
Black and white, yeah
Polish sausages
In a bun, in the sun
It's hit-and-run
Hey man, like, like check this out man, really, I mean listen
I was countin' the holes in the acoustic tile ceiling, you know
Mumbling and fumbling with them little buttons on my mattress
You know, that hold it together
So anyways, my mind strays and the tricks that my memory plays
Like fascination and abomination on a biblical Broadway stage
Like dancers and singers and a fully landscaped gospel group
And the harmony and whatever and
Dinosaurs eatin' like veggie burgers at the snack bar out front
In the lobby, you know
So anyways on the same stage is me, naked like an empty page
That's when I heard him
Like a director's voice with too much echo
I guess he was talkin' to yours truly, I mean me
You might also likeMadam, that's Adam
Ain't no other woman, that's had 'im
He's stronger than a tree
That apple tree over there
Wealthy in his healthy way
Never works, he never plays
Sits around and cogitates
Right now, he's planting his garden
Like I had to hear that chorus twice, you know, before I finally
Got the picture
I screamed, "I ain't Adam! I never seen the dude, and I ain't no
Virgin either"
So anyways, it's really lookin' bad man, like that director's
Mean when he gets mad
Like, might wreck your career with just one nod and like cripple
You, you know, for life--that's a long time
My legs are shakin', my stomach's knotted, my mind has gone
Neurotic
I'd run if I could, but you can't hid from him, and besides that
Jerk took my shirt and my trousers
So anyways, in the depths of my dispair, my co-star arrives--oh God
More beautiful than Cher
I screamed, "Make up! Gimme the script--please sing that chorus
Once more"
Madam, that's Adam
Ain't no other woman, that's Adam
He's stronger than a tree
And he's freshly molded from clay
Wealthy in his healthy way
Never works, he never plays
Sits around and cogitates
He's inventing the Original Sin now
Hey madam, that's Adam
