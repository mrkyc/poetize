When you're always chasing rainbows
And you might not know
Which way the wind blows
You say your lucky day is comin'
Until that day, you're just slummin'

So you wait and you wait
But your signal don't change
Watching TV daily, there is no sign
You read your horoscope, but ah
It would appear there is no hope

So what? Who cares?
Gotta put a handle on your fear
A man comes and a man goes
And he always leaves alone

Only the strong survive
(You better wake up)
(From that fantasy, yeah)
It's time to open your eyes
(Don't be afraid to see)
(What you might see) Yeah
You might also like
The years go by and you're feeling cheated
And you fight back hard
But you know you're defeated
Oh, you let you hair grow, get a sports car
But you know you won't go so far

It's too bad, it's real sad
You lost the best thing you ever had
You had hope, you had your youth
And now you'll never know the truth

Only the strong survive
(You better wake up)
(From that fantasy, yeah)
I think it's time to open your eyes
(Don't be afraid to see)
(What you might see) Yeah

Only, only the strong survive
(Don't ever let it get you)
(Down, down, down, down, yeah)
Oh, I can't sympathize
(If you expect to stick around) Yeah

So what? Who cares?
Better put a handle on your fear
A man comes and a man goes
And he always leaves alone

Only the strong survive
(You better wake up)
(From that fantasy, yeah)
I think it's time you opened your eyes
(Don't be afraid to see)
(What you might see) You see? Yeah

Only the strong survive
(Don't ever let it get you)
(Down, down, down, down, yeah)
I think it's time to open your eyes
(If you expect to stick around, yeah)

Only, only the strong survive
(You better wake up)
(From that fantasy, yeah)
I think it's time for you to open your eyes
(Don't be afraid to see)
(What you might see, yeah)
