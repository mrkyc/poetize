Ooh, baby
Move closer to me
I've had all that I can stand
Take hold of me with your hands

Oh, baby
You give me the chills
Whisper low in my ear
Let me know how it feels
Just to know you are near

Your body gives me a thrill
As it leans against mine
I love how it feels
With your jeans against mine

B:  The smell of burning leather (burning leather)
B: As we hold each other tight (hold tight!)
B: As our rivets rub together (rub together)
B: Flashing sparks into the night (into the night)

Re: Don't touch me there (don't touch me there)

Unzip that jacket
That leather smells so sweet
Put your chest against mine
Feel my heart beat

I love the way your belt fits
The way it hangs so low
So low on your hips, my darling
I want you so

Re: I love your sweet, sweet lips
F: I love your salty taste
Re: I love your finger tips
F: When I reach for your waist
Re: Uh-huh...

I will give my love forever
If you promise me you'll
Never never never touch me there

(Don't touch me there)
Don't touch me there
(Don't touch me there)
Please, don't
(Don't touch me there)
Oh no, not there
(Don't touch me there)
Anywhere but there
(Don't touch me there)
Never, don't ever!
(Don't touch me there)
Do you care?
(Don't touch me there)
Then, don't touch me there
(Don't touch me there)
(Don't touch me there)
(Don't touch me there)
