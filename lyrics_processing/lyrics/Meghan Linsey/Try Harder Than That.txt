Hey boy, you know I'm on to your game boy
No I won't be another play toy playboy
No I'm not down with that
You can give me your best try
Come on give me one of your best lines
Don't play me a song about tan lines or takin' a ride
'Cause I'm so done with that

You're gonna have to try harder than that to get a girl like this
More than a back road moonlight kiss
Cherry red lipstick, cut-off jeans
Every woman in the world knows what I mean
If you're lookin' for a girl that'll hop in your truck
Maybe get lost, maybe get stuck
You might think you're cool now
But it ain't gonna last
To get a girl like this
You're gonna have to try harder than that

Hey boy
Dial it back a notch let's take it slow
'stead of layin' me down why don't we
Lay low you can get to know me
See where this thing goes
You might also like
You're gonna have to try harder than that to get a girl like this
More than a back road moonlight kiss
Cherry red lipstick, cut-off jeans
Every woman in the world knows what I mean
If you're lookin' for a girl that'll hop in your truck
Maybe get lost, maybe get stuck
You might think you're cool now
But it ain't gonna last
To get a girl like this
You're gonna have to try harder than that

You're gonna have to try harder than that to get a girl like this
More than a back road moonlight kiss
Cherry red lipstick, cut-off jeans
Every woman in the world knows what I mean
If you're lookin' for a girl that'll hop in your truck
Maybe get lost, maybe get stuck
You might think you're cool now
But it ain't gonna last
To get a girl like this
You're gonna have to try harder than that
Oh you're gonna have to try harder than
Hey girl why don't you hop up in my truck
