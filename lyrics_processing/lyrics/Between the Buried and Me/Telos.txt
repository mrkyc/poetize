Built to destroy, born to compress
Every worry, every idea
Push it deep down
The blood vessel cover
The skin suit of anxiety
Built to destroy, born to compress
Every worry, every idea
Push it deep down
The blood vessel cover
The skin suit of anxiety
Never speak a word
Just do as you're told and compete
Compete for success, for health, for sport
Climb the mountain of limbs
Built to destroy, born to compress
Every worry, every idea
Push it deep down
The blood vessel cover
The skin suit of anxiety
Build the walls around me
A covered land mine
Every smile, every itch
A covered land mine
Push it deep down
Put your head under the ground
Worm discussion, worm discussion

As I am you
You will never know
Just like all the fools before you
Here is what we must do
She writes:
I awake to a cold touch. Two arms in four-armed bed. The touch of wind wrapping around me. I'm trying to follow its scent. The scent of isolation. Every door opened, every aspect of our life... gone. Hauling around our memories. Every corner a display of our life. A life I assume will never be the same again. No signs, no clues. A game that I will question until the end. Where have you gone? Was I ever important? The late nights lend ideas, but nothing to gather actual progress
Years go by. The constant stare. The constant grip inside. Every organ grinding. Every day seems easier until I step back in our box. Boxed in. Surrounded by life, while suffocating inside a poor version of one. Grip the match, set the fire. Don't save a thing
Rebirth. Reborn. Now this is progress. The black box will reveal only this. I will sit. Sit and wait until not a breath escapes my body. Burning in our box. What did all of this even mean? More objects to represent a status. One we can't even prove. Hide behind what we have taken. You have done this. The memory of me will leave with the ash of lost treasures. Goodbye to you. Goodbye to everything
She speaks:
Was I ever, was I ever really alive?
Did I stay, did I stay in his mind?
Was I ever, was I ever really alive?
Did I stay, did I stay in his mind?
Goodbye to all I've known, I love you
Goodbye to all I've known, I love you
Rebirth, reborn
Rebirth, reborn
Prospect 2:
Do as we are built, machines for the future
Bright eyed and ready for life
The dual gods of our time, of all time
They will never see us coming
They will never see us coming
Let's end it all
Start from scratch
Patch the uniform and let the galaxy form a comfortable replacement
We will not be missed, goodbye to everything
Start from scratch
Patch the uniform and let the galaxy form a comfortable replacement
We will not be missed, goodbye to everything
Prospect 1:
Doing as one's told, a puppet through fear
The crossed finger clicking sounds
Inner anxiety with a smile

(Will he even know this? Will she notice? I haven't even begun telling her the truth, or telling you about her for that matter.)
Why can't we step back?
Why can't we step back?
Are we really this important?
Just because we can doesn't mean we should
(Let things happen naturally)
Personal resets through selfish release
At least I will enjoy
The worry slips under the door
(I will never see him or I again)

You won't see me coming
