Creep in before the rise of the sun
Execute a story never told
Do not think, just do
No human emotion
Who says I'm even human at this point?
A poor example of life
Do not think, just do
No human emotion
No morals, just a huge display of direction
Hear, then do, profit
Sneak in the box before the rise of the sun
A four-handed bed occupied by only two
The window is yawning
Faceless in a sea of space
My propulsion from their pain
Faceless in a sea of space
My propulsion from their pain
In, out, profit
Why would they need me for a simple confession?
Collect, then destroy
Collect, then destroy
Collect, then destroy
Before the rise of the sun
Collect, then destroy
Before the rise of the sun, the sun

Years Later:
Frantic writing, not meant for my eyes
Frantic writing, not meant for my eyes
Why did I keep this? What inside forced me to see the ink?
Smoothed out, then in pieces, in pieces
I can't live with this, I must let her know
A valley of smiling despair
Self-doubt would be my first guess
Confusion, sadness, the other half
But lost through selfish measures
I can't live with this, I must let her know
I can't live with this, I must let her know
The robot has stepped out of his box
Foreigner in my own land
No profit, for once no profit
The robot has stepped out of his box
Foreigner in my own land
No profit
Walk in
After the rise of the sun
Conclude a story never read
A burning smell creeps up my nostrils (the box is gone)
A trapdoor locked from the inside
Incomplete me
Impossible conclusion, me
Incomplete me
Impossible conclusion, me
Faceless in a sea of space
My propulsion from their pain
Faceless in a sea of space
My propulsion from their pain
Faceless in a sea of space
My propulsion from their pain
Faceless in a sea of space
My propulsion from their pain
Frantic writing, not meant for my eyes
