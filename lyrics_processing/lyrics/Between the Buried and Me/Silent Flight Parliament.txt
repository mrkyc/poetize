I know what I must do
I know what I must do
I'm coming home
Strigiformes:
Fixed socket threat
Binocular vision
I see all
I hear all
Superior intellect
I'm the night owl
Built by the alien Gods
I'm the night owl
A necessity to the existence of all life
I'm the night owl
I'm the night owl
Fixed socket threat
Binocular vision
I see all
I see all
I hear all
I'm the night owl
I'm the night owl
You might also likeI return in the day but you won't ever see me
Only my eyes
The blaring, yellow sphere
A sharp distortion
The TV screen you stare at night after night
Over and over
Over and over
I return in the day but you won't ever see me
Only my eyes
The blaring, yellow sphere
A sharp distortion
The TV screen you stare at night after night
Over and over
Over and over
You are staring into me
Cut the wires and cut your ties
You aren't what you think
An experiment
They will send us to warn, but that's part of the game as well
Fucking weaklings
Prospect 2:
I still know what my mind tells you to do
Cut out pieces to form new
I still know what my mind tells you to do
Cut out pieces to form new
Am I me?
What is he?
Am I me?
What is he?
It's come to the point of opening the box
Carved in the side are the words:
Property of the Night Owls
Smash to unlock the desperate measures
Am I me?
What is he?
Am I me?
What is he?
He is found and I will drag him to his end
It's not selfish if it's what's right
He knows I'm looking for him
This thievery is for the bettering of all humankind
So it seems
Creep in before the rise of the sun
They are sleeping
Holding each other like it's the last...
And it is
Open the valve
Fill the room
And it is
Open the valve
Say goodbye to everything
Creep in before the rise of the sun
They are sleeping
Holding each other like it's the last...
Creep in before the rise of the sun
They are sleeping
Holding each other like it's the last...
And it is
Open the valve
Fill the room
And it is
Open the valve
Fill the room
Am I me?
Am I me?
Strigiformes:
Seek the day
Never again
Seek the day
Never again
Seek the day
Never again
Seek the day
Weightless in the sea, sea of space
Never again
Seek the day
Weightless in the sea, sea of space
Never again
Never again
Prospect 2:
Eyes open to the sound of laughter
Like a mighty God casting his spells on the worlds below
The man is me

Dancing towards our future
A future of nothing
A future towards nothing

Dancing towards our future
A future of nothing

Jet propulsion disengage
Dancing towards our future
A future of nothing
A future towards nothing
Jet propulsion disengage
Dancing towards our future
A future of nothing

Dancing towards our future
A future of nothing
A future towards nothing
Goodbye to everything
