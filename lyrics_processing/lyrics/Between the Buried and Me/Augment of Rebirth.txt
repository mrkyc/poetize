Moving forward
Moving forward
Memories left behind. A new life, a new journey. I've built anew
For mankind... for my kind
For mankind... for my kind
The vessel stares back at me. From every angle, the menacing smile latches on
Talking walls speak and spell my life story
My past life
The vessel sleeps beside me... the comfort breath
Morning skin of machine, of humanity's beginnings
Am I God? I've been called worse... drift in and out
The vessel brings me sleep
Morning skin of machine, of humanity's beginnings
Drift in and out
The vessel brings me sleep
Hyper Sleep

Mind bending strategy game. Running through obstacles on a land never ventured
Every night. Every wake
Alone but not for long
Alone but not for long
The signals worked. Did I want this? I must go back and explain my reasonings
Worse things have happened:
Worse things will happen
The signals worked
Did I want this?
I must go back and explain my reasonings
Worse things have happened
Worse things will happen
The old atlas is found. No matter what I do it's been done... it's been worse
This is not reassuring
Imperfect. Improper. Extinct
They have found me

I approach unfamiliar ground
Left standing with the air swirling silently
A creepy siren, the siren of loneliness
Twisting, falling, and screaming
I approach unfamiliar ground. Left standing with the air swirling silently
A creepy siren, the siren of loneliness
Twisting, falling, and screaming
Please break out
The crumbling starts. Inch by inch the ground takes over
The wretched clench of my insides
Unspeakable anguish... this fucking contortion
Awake, mime standing
Air swirling around me... silent
Siren of loneliness. This is real isn't it? Can't tell these days, the longest fucking days
Why the anger I wonder?
To create
To recreate

Have I become a God?
I have been called much worse
Secretly that title makes me feel comfortable
In my place
It's been a while
This God-like complex does bring me a smile
To create

Down to the last seed, I stand with a dark stare
Still silent, still frighteningly silent
Down to the last seed, I stand with a dark stare
Still silent, still frighteningly silent
I must leave myself
That's what all of this has gotten me... infinite life? Conquering of death
The seed is planted
Time to move on. What have I become?...
I'll make my own life seem new
Face all of my mistakes and grow
I'll make my own life seem new
