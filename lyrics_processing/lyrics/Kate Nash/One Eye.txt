One fateul night I was driving around town
It was late, I was tired and feeling down
I like to drive to take my mind off all the stuff
That stresses me out and that keeps me up
And sometimes when I'm driving I put two and two together
I'd read the email earlier that day but thought, "no never"
Surely it couldn't be, surely this wasn't true
The person who betrayed me, who stole it all, was you

I took my knife and I held it right in front of him
To teach him a lesson in suffering

And now he sleeps (he sleeps)
With one eye open (God knows)
Oh God knows I told him
I guess he thought that I was joking
But now his face is broken (I'm not)
I'm not the kind of girl that
Would normally overreact
Cut it out so I could show him
Now he sleeping with one eye open

Let me back this up, I can explain
I forgot to mention I've been driving in the rain
I was in shock, a sort of catatonic state
But I tried to speak, I tried to breathe, I couldn't brake
The car it flipped, I flew into a ditch
It was in the hospital I first got the itch
I was laying in my blood soaked clothes when I knew what to do
Almost dying, it made me want to hurt you

And now he sleeps (he sleeps)
With one eye open (God knows)
Oh God knows I told him
I guess he thought that I was joking
But now his face is broken (I'm not)
I'm not the kind of girl that
Would normally overreact
Cut it out so I could show him
Now he sleeping with one eye open
That's what he's got now, one eye open
Ooh, one eye open
That's what he's got now, one eye open
One eye open

I kept it as a souvenir
So you can see I'm always here
I wear it like a locket around my neck
It's watching out for me so I never forget
And now he sleeps (he sleeps)
With one eye open (God knows)
Oh God knows I told him
I guess he thought that I was joking
But now his face is broken (I'm not)
I'm not the kind of girl that

Now he sleeping with one eye open
That's what he's got now, one eye open
Ooh, one eye open
That's what he's got now, one eye open
