I wanna be fucked and then rolled over, cause i'm an independent woman of the Twenty first century;
No time for knits, I want sex and debauchery
I read Glamour, and the Guardian
I like flowers, and I'm hardy and
I take cocaine
I don't give a fuck about her, I want your name
I can get fucked like the best of men; like the best of men, like the worst of pain, inflicted on another young girl again;
Impressed by another guitar hero; he's a top score and you're a zero - you're outta your league
There ain't no rubber on the tracks; it's gravel
You fall hard, cut quick and it's an STD; a cut knee
You're a side of stage grasp, a laugh, an after-show party in a bath
Fucked and expected to be fucked, a gasp from an uninformed intruder
The crowd go wild and things get ruder
They're already out of hand and there's no one here to take your hand;
It's a cold shower and a scramble for a dirty pair 'o knickers
Don't get yours mixed up with hers
Now get outta bed, get out, get out, get, get outta bed
Get up, get down and get undressed cause that's what you do best;
Strip, strip, strip and shag, fuck get fucked and drag and be impressed by the better sex
Take a piece of raw vegetable, and hold it to your breast and say that you stood for nothing
You were just a hole that lacked passion
Another undignified product of society
That girl shoulda been a mansion

We can make love 
You can get some 
This is not love
I am a mansion, I am a mansion
I won't take none of your shit. 
You can try and have your way, but I have far too much to say
You will be asleep before I'm taking off my shirt 
And I will be a lady
