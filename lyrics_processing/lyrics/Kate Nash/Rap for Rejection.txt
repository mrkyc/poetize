Well can you make up your mind and tell me which is which?
Oh now I get it, you think I'm ugly yeah tell your friends
How you never woulda done me
Are you trying to tell me sexism doesn't exist?
If it doesn't exist then what the fuck is this?
How many boys will it destroy?
How many girls and boys will it annoy?
Take your good look - yeah get your books out
I know you might have had high expectations
But this is what I call classic male rejection
I'm at my friends party - He's asking for my number
"I'm sorry I've got a boyfriend"
"Bitch, it was a joke aren't you a lesbian?"

Told all his friends about it - and now you feel depressed and crushed
