When I'm on my own thinking of you
Lying here alone in my cute bedroom
I'm twisted up
I've turn in two
I'm smashed - oh my god! - when I fucking miss you

I don't wanna read an email, read an email from a ghost, yeah
I wanna be touched by, I wanna be touched by you the most
I feel it in your hands, I feel it in your toes and mouth
I just thank God I'm alive right now

I don't usually hit delete but I threw it all out
And I only want magic from now on so get the fuck out
And now I'm at the beach, and I'm naked too
I'm dancing at the full moon yeah, and I'm howling for you

I don't wanna read an email, read an email from a ghost, yeah
I wanna be touched by, I wanna be touched by you the most
I feel it in your hands, I feel it in your toes and mouth
I just thank God I'm alive right now

I need you most in the night
I feel it crawling alive
It's riding up my chest
It's proper back from the dead
It's proper back from the dead
I'm proper back from the dead
It's proper back from the dead, baby
I feel it up in my chest
