I wish I could get away from here
I get it, you've made it pretty clear
Alone in my bed, I can't believe it's real
Dinner for one, another lonely meal

Take, take, take a look at me and all the things I've done
Waste, oh waste another day on me
I don't be the one
Let me be the one

I want a take away with you
I don't care if it's Chinese food
We'll get a side of Pepsi too
I want a take away, I want a take away

It's hard to think about something else
I kept your shirt and I like the smell
I wanna watch Buffy in my room on the TV
And you know I'll be smiling when we spoon and you kiss me

Take, take, take a look at me and all the things I've done
Waste, oh waste another day on me
I don't be the one
Let me be the one

I want a take away with you
I don't care if it's Chinese food
We'll get a side of Pepsi too
I want a take away, I want a take away
I want a take away with you
I don't care if it's Chinese food
We'll get a side of Pepsi too
I want a take away, I want a take away

I can do whatever I want
But do you even miss me?
Hungry for a taste of what you've got and for you to kiss me
So supersize your love I'm dizzy
Yeah you know that you won't miss me

I want a take away with you
I don't care if it's Chinese food
We'll get a side of Pepsi too
I want a take away, I want a take away
I want a take away with you
I don't care if it's Chinese food
We'll get a side of Pepsi too
