Bought you a drink and we chatted by the bar
Took me by surprise when you wanted to dance
Nothing I could fear when I'm in your arms
Baby, tell me what you want
Walked to the car and I felt something good
The wind blew up and I knew that you would
Blow my mind if you felt you could
Ask me if I wanted to, I think that we should

And I'm so hung up, I'm pretty drunk
I probably should go home
But I'm so hung up, I'm pretty drunk
I can't leave you alone

Kiss me in the karaoke bar
I need something, I feel so dark
Kiss me in the karaoke bar
I need something, I feel so dark

When I get in my head, I wonder where it'll go
Will we break up? End up alone?
I wonder if you feel the same
Never wanted to complain
I look in my heart and I still don't know
We take the risk 'cause we can't be sure
It's worth it for tonight
'Cause I feel alright when I'm with you

I probably should go home
But I'm so hung up, I'm pretty drunk
I can't leave you alone

Kiss me in the karaoke bar
I need something, I feel so dark
Kiss me in the karaoke bar
I need something, I feel so dark
Kiss me in the karaoke bar
I need something, I feel so dark
Kiss me in the karaoke bar
I need something, I feel so dark

Hung up, hung up
I feel it in my microphone
Hung up, hung up
(And I'm so hung up, I'm pretty drunk)
I feel it in my microphone

Kiss me in the karaoke bar
I need something, I feel so dark
Kiss me in the karaoke bar
I need something, I feel so dark
Kiss me in the karaoke bar
I need something, I feel so dark
Kiss me in the karaoke bar
