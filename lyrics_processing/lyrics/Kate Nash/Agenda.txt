Hey you! (Let it)
Hey you! (Let it)
Hey you! (Let it)

Hey you! Let it all hang out
Take a look in the mirror and open your mouth
You've got a tongue, let the words roll out
Now schh (shut-up)
No, wait I take it back
'Cause you're a dick and you're talking crap
And I don't want to hear ignorance like that
You're wishing it was pre-'73
So it was easy for you to suppress me

There's people marching in the street
Look what we made from just one tweet
Well, I don't give a fuck about your agenda
I don't give a fuck about your agenda

I don't give a fuck about your agenda
I don't give a fuck about your agenda
I don't give a fuck about your agenda
I don't give a fuck, no I don't give a fuck

Get ready for bed now and brush your teeth

Sweet dreams, my darling
Sweet dreams, are you dreaming of me?
'Cause I've been dreaming that you were free
I was dreaming that you did love me
I was dreaming it was better, it was better

You give a shit 'bout the Gaza Strip?
Dropping all them bombs on all them kids
The Hollywood land says you're dismissed
For being such a conscious caring bitch
I'm sending out a kiss with a fist to the big boys private members bliss
And when there's a grave from which to piss
I'm the first in line and you won't be missed
She's pretty, she's skinny
Low self esteem, I don't wanna be me
Nah, fuck that don't waste that energy
Live fast, die old, young at heart, happy
Well don't worry about a thing
We'll take a lesson, take a note, from Bob Marley
Ain't got time to waste on feeling ugly
Stop watching shit TV
