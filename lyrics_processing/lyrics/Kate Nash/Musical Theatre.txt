I was running, it was a cold night
I feel breaths so heavy on my chest
I see it smoky white
I turn around to see if I had lost them now
I chase, I'm run- I'm running
I'm run- I'm running out of time
And I feel it faster
I hear the footsteps catching up on me
I bite my lip so hard, I bite the skin off completely
I feel the blood about to drip
I save it with my tongue, it tastes like metal
I tell myself no matter what happens tonight that everything will be OK
Yeah, everything is gonna be alright
I'm not sure if I believe it
But I hold onto it so much
So tight, I really squeeze it
I mash it up so hard inside my hand I'm almost sure that I killed it
I check it for a pulse but I can't remember ABC correctly
1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3 count 1, 2, 3
1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3 count 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3
I think I feel a beat
I think I feel a beat
I really need you still
Come on, I really need you, get up
I help it get on top of my back
I wrap it 'round my body
I want it underneath my clothes
I lick the holes and toes and elbows
I shove it up inside me so it knows
Never to scare me like that again
Never to leave, always to stay
Never go away, no
Never scare me like that again
Always stay, always stay, always stay
