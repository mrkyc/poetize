There was this cool, cool girl
She was about your age
She kind of had your smile
She kind of had your face
There was this cool, cool girl
She was about your age
She kind of had your smile
She kind of had your face

She wanted to be my lover
But my heart was with another and
Yeah I really wish that we could be friends
But I know I'm never gonna get you back again
I just wish that you would answer the phone
'Cause, I could really do with talking to you right now

Another girl broke my heart; it hurt
I even wrote you poetry, so now I'm scarred
I look up into the sky and
I wish that I could fly, high

Sister, sister
Well, don't ya know how much I miss ya?
Oh my god, my, my sister
You were just like
A blister
Well, sister, sister
Don't ya know how much I missed ya?

It's not fair to watch you walk away like this
I just wish that I could get one more kiss
But you gave it, you gave it to another
And it's not fair to me to trust ya
Being ripped away from you, is like being ripped out of a womb
I'm sorry, is that too dramatic? I should just be far more placid
Well blah-blah, blah-blah, me myself and I
I'm so funny, oh my god, ha ha
