You know I hold up the mirror, babe, I'm the truth, truth
Look you in the eye and I see right through
I can't pretend but you want me to
Yeah, I can only be real
Yeah, yeah, I'm telling you
I'm as real as it gets
My skin is see-through
I can be what i need, I can present truth
Got this pain in my gut and I'm physically weak
Forced myself out of bed, forced myself to eat
And I admit that I'm lonely

Music is the only one
Music is by my side
Music will never leave
To the music, hold on
Music is the only one
All the music I own
To the music I belong
Yeah, music is the only one
Music is by my side
Music will never leave
To the music, hold on
Music is the only one
All the music I own
To the music I belong

And you never picked up the phone, never picked up the phone
Never picked up the phone
And I never got a face-to-face, never got told the truth
I never got told anything by you

Drive, drive, drive, drive, drive
(I ain't going nowhere but drive)
Drive, drive, drive, drive, drive
(I ain't going nowhere but drive)
(I ain't going)

It's funny staring at the phone, doesn't make you call
I'm obsessed now, look at my fingers scroll
It's for the best now, they're telling you I'm not your girl
It's in my chest now, guess it's laid to rest now
But it's in my chest, how is it for the best?
Sick to death hearing how you made amends with your friends
I just get nothing
I guess you never meant anything that you said

Music is the only one
Music is by my side
Music will never leave
To the music, hold on
Music is the only one
All the music I own
To the music I belong
Yeah, music is the only one
Music is by my side
Music will never leave
To the music, I'll die
Music is the only one
All the music I own
To the music I belong
Music is the only one
Music is by my side
Music will never leave
To the music, hold on
Music is the only one
All the music I own
To the music I belong
Yeah, music is the only one
Music is by my side
Music will never leave
To the music, I'll die
Music is the only one
All the music I own
To the music I belong
Music is the only one
Music is by my side
Music will never leave
To the music, hold on
Music is the only one
