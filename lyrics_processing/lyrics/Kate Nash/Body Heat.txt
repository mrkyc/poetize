Body heat, body heat, body

Woke up late for work again
Ticket on my windshield
And everyone's a dick but I don't wanna complain 'cause I'll come off as a bitch, of course
Coffee on my lucky shirt
Left my card at the bar last night
But when everything turns to shit, I know I can handle it since I met you

You make my dopamine levels go so crazy
Sky rocket symphonies when I see you lately

Baby, you can steal my sheets
Baby, you can steal my sheets
I got everything I need
I can live off of your body heat, yeah
Baby, you can steal my sheets
Baby, you can steal my sheets
I got everything I need
I can live off of your body heat, yeah

Body heat, body heat, body

I'll turn to you 'cause you make me happy when skies are faded
But I don't wanna wait this out
So could you please come over now?
I got all this stress in my head
I just wanna go to bed next to you 'cause

You make my dopamine go fucking so crazy
Sky rocket symphonies when I see you lately
