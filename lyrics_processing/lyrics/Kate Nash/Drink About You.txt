When I wake up
And we break up
I kinda wish you liked me more
But I don't care much
I look so cute but
I'm also kinda scary
I freak you out for Halloween
I drive, I drive you crazy

I'm sick and tired of being such a hypocrite
I'm kinda over being over it all
I think you hate yourself
I think I hate me even more
I can't remember what happened before

Well there's no one that I think about more than you
Spots are coming out on me what should I do?
And when the other boys tell me that we're through
I'll only drink about you-oo!
Drink about you!
Ooo!
Drink about you!
You!

It's only love but
I think I taste blood
I think you kick me in the gut
And I'm covered in mud!
And when it comes to sex
We are simply the best
My heart is beating in the jungle
And I'm pounding my chest!

I'm sick and tired of being such a hypocrite
I'm kinda over being over it all
I think you hate yourself
I think I hate me even more
I can't remember what happened before

And when the other boys tell me that we're through

Drink about you!
Wooo!
Drink about you!
You!
Well I'm drinking
We're thinking
Got a second to catch
You might miss if you blink
So while I'm hanging on
Come on and get it on
Cause we are old
But baby I'm not sure if we're on
Baby I'm not sure if we're on
Baby I'm not sure if we're

Well there's no one that I think about more than you
Spots are coming out on me what should I do?
And when the other boys tell me that we're through
I'll only drink about you-woo!
Drink about you!
Wooo!
Drink about you!
