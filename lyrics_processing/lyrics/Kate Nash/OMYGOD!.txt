Hey!
Check me out
I'm so happy by the sea
Look
I can tell
All my friends are jealous of me
But they don't know how I feel inside
They don't know how I feel
They don't know I pretend to smile, but
When I look at the stars at night

O My God
I really, really miss you
I remember what it was like to kiss you
The words you say don't make no sense
I wish you were in my bed
O My God
I really, really miss you
I remember what it was like to kiss you
The words you say don't make no sense
I wish you were in my bed

The sun shine is down on me
But I don't get no vitamin D
The bar does a 2 for 1, but
I'm not having any fun
Yesterday a dolphin kissed me
But I just don't feel no different
I write a postcard everyday, that
I intend to send your way

O My God
I really, really miss you
I remember what it was like to kiss you
The words you say don't make no sense
I wish you were in my bed
O My God
I really, really miss you
I remember what it was like to kiss you
The words you say don't make no sense
I wish you were in my bed
O My God
I really, really miss you
I remember what it was like to kiss you
The words you say don't make no sense
I wish you were in my bed
O My God
I really, really miss you
I remember what it was like to kiss you
The words you say don't make no sense
I wish you were in my bed
O My God

The words you say don't make no sense
