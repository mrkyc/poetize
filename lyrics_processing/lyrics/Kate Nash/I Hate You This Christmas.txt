Got too drunk at the Christmas party
Puked on my dress, shit! I guess I better leave
On the way home, I took a detour
I wanna see you
I wish I never saw
Get the key from under the mat
Trying to find the light, I stumble around
I swear I heard a noise, what's that sound?
Well, that's my best friend and you're going down

It's Christmas once again
But you are fucking one of my friends
Well, I hope her candy cunt tastes better than
My undying love that won't weather
Yeah, it's Christmas once again but you're fucking one of my friends
Well, I hope her candy cunt tastes better than
My undying love that won't weather
I hate her
I hate her
I hate you
This Christmas

Everyone's excited about going home
But I am embarrassed to tell my mom
All the Christmas lights and the mistletoe are only making me feel more alone
All the skater kids are stoned on the hill, even the goths are filled with good willI
I head to the bar to see old faces
We're in old streets but new places

It's Christmas once again but you're fucking one of my friends
Well, I hope her candy cunt tastes better than
My undying love that won't weather
Yeah, it's Christmas once again but you're fucking one of my friends
Well, I hope her candy cunt tastes better than
My undying love that won't weather
I hate her
I hate her
I hate you
This christmas

Well, I guess there's other girls you fucked
Well, I guess that means you really suck
Well, I hope you feel alone this Christmas
You can say goodbye to this cause
You know I am never coming back
It's Christmas once again but you're fucking one of my friends
Well, I hope her candy cunt tastes better than
My undying love that won't weather
Yeah, it's Christmas once again but you're fucking one of my friends
Well, I hope her candy cunt tastes better than
My undying love that won't weather
I hate her
I hate her
I hate you
