I think about death all of the time
Do you think that's morbid?
I'm not like the other girls
Don't get me started
But I'm
Try-y-ing
Well I wish that I could take you to another time
When everything was cool and my mental health
Was fine
But I'm try-y-ing
I'm not ly-y-ing

When you're in my head
Well I wish it was someone else
Mad at me again
And that's not even what I said!
What's wrong with me?
Am I a person yet?
What's wrong with me?
Oh!

Wish I could let my brain
Decide and stop the pain
I keep heart-shaped glasses close to me
For when it rains (life in pink)

My bedroom is a mess but I just can't clean it
Yeah I'm hungry but I don't even feel like eating

I guess I thought that I was something that I'm really not
Now I'm giving in and what I'm giving is a lot
Yeah I'm
Try-y-ing
Yeah I'm

I'm not
