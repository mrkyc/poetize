You're like a drunk tattoo on my back
That tramp stamp, oh shit, morning regret
That's why I'm telling you
(I really fucking hate you)
Just like a bad dose of PMS
I wish you didn't even exist
That's why I'm telling you
(I really fucking hate you)

Stringing me along, telling me you're not
Giving all I got baby
Stringing me along, telling me you're not
Yeah you got me going crazy

Show me something, all or nothing
You keep on changing your mind
I can't chase it, I can't take it
Only a matter of time
'Til you're crawling on your knees
Begging pretty please
You think it's funny keeping me wanting
And that's why
(I really fucking hate you)

It's 3am, you never showed up
You say come over, just take the bus
That's why I'm telling you
(I really fucking hate you)
Your mind's like ice, making me trip
But when I come down, I'm getting sick
That's why I'm telling you
(I really fucking hate you)

Stringing me along, telling me you're not
Giving all I got baby
Stringing me along, telling me you're not
Yeah you got me going crazy

Show me something, all or nothing
You keep on changing your mind
I can't chase it, I can't take it
Only a matter of time
'Til you're crawling on your knees
Begging pretty please
You think it's funny keeping me wanting
And that's why
(I really fucking hate you)
I can't go round and round no more
You're ringing my bell and I'm locking the door
I've been trying to give you everything
I lost my mind just trying to let you in
It's clear you actually don't give a shit
Before you really take the piss, hear what I'm saying

Show me something, all or nothing
You keep on changing your mind
I can't chase it, I can't take it
Only a matter of time
'Til you're crawling on your knees
Begging pretty please
You think it's funny keeping me wanting
And that's why
