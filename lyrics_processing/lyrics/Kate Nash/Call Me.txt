Sometimes when I get down
I really like to get down low
I sink my feet into the ground
I dig a great big hole
And I've been thinking lately
About letting go
'Cause nothing good comes from
Soaking self love

But now I feel pretty versed
At dealing with the blows
So if there's anything that I can do for you
Well, honey pick up the phone

You can call me baby
When you feel like that
Call me, call me, call me, you will call me
You know I'll get right back
You can call me baby
When you feel like that
Call me, call me, call me, you will call me
You know I'll get right back

Sometimes when it gets rough
I feel like giving up
I feel like I'm not tough enough
To face the real stuff
But I've been getting through it
Take a look at where I'm at
Everything happens for a reason
What doesn't kill you don't kill ya

But now I feel pretty versed
At dealing with the blows
So if there's anything that I can do for you
Well, honey pick up the phone

You can call me baby
When you feel like that
Call me, call me, call me, you will call me
You know I call right back
You can call me baby
When you feel like that
Call me, call me, call me, you will call me
You know I call right back
You're the one, with the sun
Feel that power and lift me up
You're the one, with the sun
Feel that power and lift me up
You're the one, with the sun
Feel that power and lift me up

You can call me baby
When you feel like that
Call me, call me, call me, you will call me
You know I call right back
You can call me baby
When you feel like that
Call me, call me, call me, you will call me
