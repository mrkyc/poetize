That girl is giving you the eye, and I and I and I
Don't Like it how she makes you laugh so much
How when you're talking, that you touch
She's instantly more pretty and more interesting than me
She is thinking before she speaks
She is not all red and angry
I bet she doesn't like to eat
I bet her feet don't even stink
I know your eyes are just for me, but...

Kiss that girl and I will shrink up
And I will die and I will think up
A thousand ways that I can hurt you and
You will never touch my hand
Kiss that girl and I will shrink up
And I will die and I will think up
A thousand ways that I can hurt you and
You will never touch my hand

Tonight we have not got on well
I know I have given you hell
I wish we should have stayed at home
Cause now I'm standing on my own
And you are having a nice time
With a girl I really don't like
I know your eyes are just for my butt

Baby please don't break my heart
Cause you are the only one I love
I'll be by your side till the very end
Cause you're my only friend!

Kiss that girl and I will shrink up
