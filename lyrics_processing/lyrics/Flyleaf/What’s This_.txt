There's color everywhere
What's this?
There's white things in the air
What's this?
I can't believe my eyes, I must be dreaming
Wake up, Jack, this isn't fair
What's this?
What's this? What's this?
There's something very wrong
What's this?
There's people singing songs
What's this?
The streets are lined with little children laughing
Everybody seems so happy
Have I possible gone daffy?
What is this?
There's children throwing snowballs instead of throwing heads
They're busy building toys and absolutely no one's dead
There's frost on every window
Oh, I can't believe my eyes
And in my bones, I feel the warmth that's coming from inside
Oh look, what's this?
They're hanging mistletoe
They kiss
Why that looks so unique, inspired
They're gathering around to hear a story
Roasting chestnuts on a fire
What's this?

In here, they got a little tree
How queer
And who would ever think
And why?
They're covering it with tiny little things
They've got electric lights on strings
And there's a smile on everyone
So now, correct me if I'm wrong
This looks like fun, this looks like fun
Could it be I got my wish?
What's this?
Oh my, what now?
The children are asleep
But look, there's nothing underneath
No ghouls, no witches here to scream
And scare them or ensnare them
Only little cozy things inside their dreamland
The monsters are all missing and the nightmares can't be found
And in their place, there seems to be good feeling all around
Instead of screams, I swear I can hear music in the air
The smell of cakes and pies are absolutely everywhere
The sights, the sounds
They're everywhere and all around
I've never felt so good before
The empty place inside of me is filling up
I simply cannot get enough
I want it, oh, I want
Oh, I want it for my own
I've got to know
I've got to know
What is this place that I have found?
