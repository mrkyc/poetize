Had you at your worst but when it's me you let me blow up
You never understand what you're doin' to me
You always have excuses either way
Don't know why each time you pass me by I get so nervous
Hesitant to walk towards you, don't know why I do this
When I call you're always unavailable
But if you'd call I'd answer right away
Yeah, am I just dumb, you make me numb and all fuzzy
When I'm with you nothing ever really feels the same
You drive me crazy but I stick with you
My heart jumps in every single way
You, you
You're like a
Tattoo
You're etched into my skin
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
You're poison to me
But I can't live without you
You, you
You make me ask if
It's true
You're deep under my skin
Why can't I just forget you
You're poison to me
But I can't be without you
You might also like(Poison)
Always see you do the things you know would really hurt me
Had you on my mind but you never thought about me
You want me here but you keep pushing me away
Don't know if you want me to stay
Yeah, am I just dumb, you make me numb and all fuzzy
When I'm with you nothing ever really feels the same
You drive me crazy but I stick with you
My heart jumps in every single way
You, you
You're like a
Tattoo
You're etched into my skin
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
You're poison to me
But I can't live without you
You're my favorite person
But why are you my poison?
You have my heart hurtin'
But you keep me wanting
Oh, you're my favorite person
But why are you my poison?
Yeah, you have my heart hurtin'
But you keep me wanting
Ohh, you keep me wanting
You, you
You're like a
Tattoo
You're etched into my skin
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
You're poison to me
But I can't live without you
You, you
You make me ask if
It's true
You're deep under my skin
Why can't I just forget you
You're poison to me
