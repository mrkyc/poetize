But sometimes they don't know that I'm weak
I put on a smile and know I do have a laughter
But sometimes I still break down and cry
But there's something that's missing
Something I miss
And it's all going down to that place in my heart
Where I hear a lullaby and you kiss me goodnight
And I put on a smile for the next day to come by
But now I need to be strong
I gotta keep moving on
I wanna go back home
I wanna go back to where it all started
I missing your face and I don't know if I can make it
But the roads gonna be long
And this life is so short
So right now
I wanna go back home
Hooooomeeee
When the lights go off and I go backstage
I still have these promised things that going to waste
But it all pays off
But I'm still missing you
But there's something that's missing
Something I miss
And it's all going down to that place in my heart
Where I hear a lullaby
And you kiss me goodnight
And I put on a smile for the next day to come by
But now I need to be strong
I gotta keep moving on
I wanna go back home
I wanna go back to where it all started
I missing your face
And I don't know if I can make it
But this roads gonna be long
And this life is so short
So right now
I wanna go back home
Hooooomeeee
I wanna go back home
I wanna go back to where it all started
I missing your face and I don't know if I can make it
But this roads gonna be long
And this life is so short
So right now
