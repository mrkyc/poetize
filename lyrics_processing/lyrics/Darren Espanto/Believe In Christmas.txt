Time stopped turning
And thought we couldn't stand
All the loosing
And the hurting
We all needed a hand
But we've been to
Dark places before
And when love shines through
There's always something more
A new season
A new reason
A spark of hope and joy to believe in
Never ending
Of new beginnings
A little bit of love, a little bit of love to believe in
You gotta believe, just believe in Christmas
Love you better believe just believe in Christmas you better do
Find the light and the dark ends
Set fire to you heart and
Let love do the talking
Everything will be shining
With love just like a home
And strength to carry on
To better days to better ways
I know we'll make it
