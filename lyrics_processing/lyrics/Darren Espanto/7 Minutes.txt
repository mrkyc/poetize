You're screaming out, you can't take this anymore
You're wondering what we're still together for
Do we even know what we're fighting for?
Are we losing ourselves this time?
Saying things we don't wanna say
Only hurting the one we love the most
She took a cab and just went away
To the station where we first met
I won't give up on us, didn't mean to do you wrong
Don't turn your back on love, with me is where you belong
'Cause I would rather fight with you
Than be happy with someone else
No I won't give up on us
7 minutes 'til the train departs
7 minutes 'til the train departs
I'm running down the streets, calling out your name
But you're not looking back as you slowly fade away
So out of reach but you're just a block away from me
Did we even know what we're fighting for?
Are we losing ourselves this time?
Saying things we don't wanna say
Only hurting the one we love the most
She took a cab and just went away
To the station where we first met
You might also likeI won't give up on us, didn't mean to do you wrong
Don't turn your back on love, with me is where you belong
'Cause I would rather fight with you
Than be happy with someone else
No I won't give up on us
7 minutes 'til the train departs
I can't take another sleepless night
Are we got up our crazy minds?
All we need is just one more try...
If we'd only make it through this night
I promise we're gonna get it right
Before the sun will rise we'll fall and fight and cry again
For one last time
I won't give up on us, didn't mean to do you wrong
Don't turn your back on love, with me is where you belong
'Cause I would rather fight with you
Than be happy with someone else
I won't give up on us
7 minutes 'til the train departs
I won't give up on us, didn't mean to do you wrong
Don't turn your back on love, with me is where you belong
'Cause I would rather fight with you
Than be happy with someone else
No I won't give up on us
7 minutes 'til the train departs
