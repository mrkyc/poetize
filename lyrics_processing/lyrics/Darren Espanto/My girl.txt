Hey girl with the pretty pink polka dot bikini
I don't want your number really, All I want is your DNA, Oh yeah!
The way you wearin' that sweater they don't make 'em any better
When you move and you swerve in that super model kind of way
Hey, hey, yeah
Two Cali girls go 'round the outside
'Round the outside, 'round the outside
Two Miami girls go 'round the outside
'Round the outside, 'round the outside
Two Manhattan girls go 'round the outside
'Round the outside, 'round the outside
Two Philly girls go 'round the outside

If I could build a girl
I'd build her just like you
I'd stay up day and night
To make her just like you
It's just the way you are
The little things you do
That makes me wanna build a girl like you
Oh oh oh, build her just like you

I need a pinch of Senorita, couple shots of Vadiva
Two scoops of vanilla and a whole lot a chocolate cake, oh yeah
I know it sounds silly I'm bit of a nerd
But I'mma be the fool that gets the last word okay, okay yeah

Every part of a million hearts to make a girl like you
The perfect smile would take a while to make it just like you
