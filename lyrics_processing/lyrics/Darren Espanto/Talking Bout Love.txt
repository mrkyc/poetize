What it takes for us to stay together
But they don't know we have love
Enough to stay with each other
Baby let's prove them wrong (Let's prove them wrong)
They don't even know what they're talking about
I know our love is strong (Love is strong)
'Cause you're the one I can't be without
Heard them talking 'bout love
Heard them talking 'bout trust
Heard them talking 'bout me and you
Heard them say we're too young
They don't know about us
Let us show them what we can do
Girl, I'm talking 'bout love, love, love
Heard them talking 'bout me and you
You and I both know
That it won't always be very easy
But you and I will grow closer to each other
Believe me
Baby let's prove them wrong (Let's prove them wrong)
They don't even know what they're talking about
I know our love is strong (Love is strong)
'Cause you're the one I can't be without
