Take a chance on love
Nobody understands
It's serious
Cuz every time you need me
I get butterflies
And I can't get you, get you off my mind
I keep saying
You're the best thing that ever happened to me
I've been waiting
I've been waiting, yeah
My baby, My baby
My pretty baby and me
It's time for us to get down
I really really want you around
My baby, My baby
My pretty baby and me
It's time for us to get down
I really really need you now
My baby, My baby
My baby, My baby and me

Got a thing called love
Nobody ever could come between us
Baby your so special
Is it the one for me
And I can't stop thinking
Thinking about you constantly
I keep saying
You're the best thing that ever happened to me
I've been waiting
I've been waiting, yeah
My baby, My baby
My pretty baby and me
It's time for us to get down
I really really want you around
