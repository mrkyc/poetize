Then everything I wished for has come true
You're the single item on my list
You're my one and only Christmas wish
The mistletoe is where I'll be waiting, meet me there
I know someone out there knows what I'm saying
Baby you're a girl who's wishing just like me
There is one, and you know who you are
My gift to you is all my heart
Make my holiday, and hear me when I say
If you're the only thing I ever get for Christmas
Then everything I wished for has come true
You're the single item on my list
You're my one and only Christmas wish
The mistletoe is where I'll be waiting, meet me there
In the morning I know everybody's rushing
To see what's underneath the Christmas tree
Know what I mean, cause I don't find it there
Underneath the mistletoe is where
You make my holidays, so hear me when I say
If you're the only thing I ever get for Christmas
You might also likeThen everything I wished for has come true
You're the single item on my list
You're my one and only Christmas wish
The mistletoe is where I'll be waiting, meet me there
Only you can make this
A merry merry Christmas
There is one, and you know who you are
My gift to you is all my heart
Make my holiday, and hear me when I say
If you're the only thing I ever get for Christmas
Then everything I wished for has come true
You're the single item on my list
You're my one and only Christmas wish
The mistletoe is where I'll be waiting, meet me there
All I ever wanted was you, this Christmas
Baby
You're the single item on my list
You're my one and only christmas wish
The mistletoe is where
I'll be waiting, kiss me there
(My one and only Christmas wish)
