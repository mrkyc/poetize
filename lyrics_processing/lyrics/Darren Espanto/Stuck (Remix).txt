That there's something about you
What am I supposed to do
I sure wish I knew
All the butterflies I felt inside
Never really mattered
Wishful thoughts and sudden smiles
End up being shattered
What are we supposed to be
I'm hopelessly addicted to you
But you never felt the same

But maybe I was wrong all along
I held onto something that never really mattered
Stuck on that starting line
I'm still silently, quietly hoping you'll end up with me
I was too dumb to notice
There was something about you
How are you supposed to see things
If only you knew
All the times we were together
I never really mattered
All you see is what you want
My heart is being shattered
