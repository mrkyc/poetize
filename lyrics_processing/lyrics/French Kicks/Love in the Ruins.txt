Running ahead out in my right mind
Needing you bad, feeling my soul fine
Cannot forget, had it with you all night
Run it down, run me down, run it down, run it down
Put me out, run me down, put me down, run me down
Let it down, let it down, let it down, let it down
Put me down, let me down, let me down, let me down
Digging my way out of this old mine
Giving em hell leaving em stone blind
Lend you hand now would you hold mine
Want it again, found it in your fine eyes
Put it down, put it down, put it down, put it down
Put me down, put me down, put me down, put me down
Put it down, let it down, let it down, let it down, let it down
Let me down, let me down, let me down, let me down
All of the days waiting for something alive
Found it in here, tell em to wait outside
Oh beautiful wings, seen in that angry light
Been here just to grow inside, thrown inside
Ain't going away, its taking a lifetime
Running ahead out in my right mind
Needing you bad, feeling my soul fine
Cannot forget, had it with you all night

Run me down, run me down, run me down, run me down
Let it down, let it down, let it down, let it down
Let me down, let me down, let me down, let me down
Put it down, put it down, put it down, put it down
Put me down, put me down, put me down, put me down
(Are you decaying)
Run it down, run it down, run it down, run it down
Let me down, let me down, let me down, let me down
