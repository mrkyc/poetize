Although you had some mornings that make you cry
You took 'em lying down
You took 'em oh so hard
And when you call the phone and talk to me and explain
I try to hark the words and not obey
They came out wrong
And I was back where I started
There is only one person that talks that way
And you use imagination in the back of the cab
You took it all the way
Home to my empty room
Well I remember that expression for the rest of my life
My answer to the party line up in and go get her
Reach inside my kitchen for that old carving knife
To mess up all my people
Make 'em see a little redder hey
When I do my dirt will you stand up high
And tell me how you got to be this way
I listened all the time
I wait around so long
And if you ever thought of dying to kill yourself
Like a tired old record you get played out
And you'll be on your own
Buried in the ground
You might also likeWell I remember that expression for the rest of my life
My answer to the party line up in and go get her
Reach inside my kitchen for that old carving knife
To mess up all the people
Make 'em see a little better hey
Woke up with a new song
Woke up with a tightrope
Living room is empty
Did you even miss me?
I knew about the last time
This could be the last time
Smoke going up the chimney
Can I take you with me?
Living room is empty
Dead with the memory
I can't get over now
Roll over now
If you ever thought of dying to kill yourself
Like a tired old record you get played out
And you'll be on your own
