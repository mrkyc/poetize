And she was very young
Everyday I wonder
What I could've done
Now she's sitting somewhere
Where the walls are all white
Losing herself underneath
Those flurescent lights
Each day goes by
Where the world looks the same
Where the seasons come and change
But I find myself the way I came
And I've lost all the things
That I lost in you
From losing ourselves
In each other like we use to do
Time moves on and those moments
That I held in my heart each day
Have now disappeared
Oh well the mountains stare at the face of the sun
The sky smiles down on everyone
We all wonder what we could've done
We end up passing one by one
One by one
One by one
One by one
One by one

By the side of the wind
Like a tree growing thin
I had nothing to believe in
Cause now the wind blows through me
On the side of the road
Like a freight train
Howling in the belly of my soul
Now the ocean's nestled
In a blanket of stars
Dreaming by the streetlights
Dreaming by a freeway of cars
The mountains stare at the face of the sun
The sky smiles down on everyone
We all wonder what we could've done
We end up passing one by one
One by one
One by one
One by one
One by one
I lost my brother when I was very young
To a drug he never knew
Cause he could not remember what he'd done
It was my first taste of fear in the hospital hall
Staring through a window at his eyes
That were black as coal
And even though something inside of him died
He left the room a different person
But he made it out alive
Oh he'd switch our cereals in the morning
Out of fear of being poisoned
By the people that had raised him
By the people that put him here
Oh but time moves on
And those moments
That I held in my heart each day
Have now disappeared
Oh the mountains stare at the face of the sun
The sky smiles down on everyone
We all wonder what we could've done
We end up passing one by one
One by one
One by one
The mountains stare at the face of the sun
The sky smiles down on everyone
We all wonder what we could've done
We all end up passing one by one
One by one
One by one
One by one
One by one
One by one
