They all roll on by
Burried again, I remember who I am
Well I woke outside to threes a crowd
The summer was festering down
Blood inside a honey jar, i'd stuck myself from the beating car
Drew my eyes open like -- chimney smoke through lazer grass
Sayin put on my black work horse boots
And heading past the business suits
As water and lillies over streams, rivers and brands and coffee beans
Pistol vision in my hands, i want to see my blood across the sand
Morning always looked like you
Morning always looked like you
And from my window the only view
Is you walk away not looking
All of my trains
My life spent away
In the dark of my veins
Oh nothing can stay
I continue through a back lit world
Where the willows bend like long black curls
Down your face from mine through the kinks in your spine
From the last thing that we spoke to the very first line
Love was something that we couldn't help but do
That something turned to someone else, somebody new
I just love to love and you love to cry
I meant it through each second that we said goodbye
You might also likeAnd i came up past a station where the floors were all blue
Something bout the way it looked reminded me of you
It might have been how far i'd come
So i dropped a match till the floor was gone
All of my trains
I let them all go
All of my trains
I let them all go
All of my trains
I let them all go
All of my trains
And i lit the thread across the station door
And took each drink, i hit the floor
The station tessled up in flames
But i could only read the bottles name
And i wound it's breast and turned it dry
Like the wake of summer from July
I got up and tripped over my knees
Which caved in at the slightest breeze
Morning always looked like you
Morning always looked like you
All of my trains
I let them all go
All of my trains
I let them all go
All of my trains
I let them all go
All of my trains
I thought you should know
I thought you should know
I thought you should know
