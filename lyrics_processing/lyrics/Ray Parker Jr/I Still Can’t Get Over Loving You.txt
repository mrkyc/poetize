'Cause I still can't get over loving you
I've had time, but I can't get you off my mind
No, I still can't get over loving you
Every time I run into your friends
I just have to ask them with who and where you've been
And when they tell me what I really didn't wanna know
It only breaks my heart, makes me want you more
When I hear your name, I get more insane
'Cause I still can't get over loving you
I can't turn you loose, though I know it's self-abuse
I still can't get over loving you
I tried to get involved with someone new
But it's just no use 'cause I expect them to be like you
Baby, I don't know what I'm gonna do
'Cause every girl I date resembles you
Oh, help me, baby, I'm going crazy
I still can't get over loving you
No, it's tearing my heart apart
'Cause I still can't get over loving you
Girl, I'm so sad
And it hurts me so bad knowing you're with someone else
(Someone else)
And though I have no right to be, I'm filled with jealousy
'Cause I want you for myself
I'm not blaming you
You might also likeOh baby, it's not your fault
If you don't feel the way I do
And even though I wish that you still loved me
It still won't change the way I feel for you
Girl, I can't forget, it's not over yet
I still can't get over loving you
Every breath you take, I'll be watching you, girl
'Cause I still can't get over loving you
Mmmm
(Loving you.) There's no way that this thing is through
No, no.  (I still can't get over loving you.)
Not yet, I ain't through loving you
I'm getting mad, girl.  (Loving you.)
Don't you ever try to leave, no, no
(I still can't get over loving you.) 'Cause it'll be the last thing you'll ever do
Ow!
Loving you.  Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh
I still can't get over loving you
Loving you
