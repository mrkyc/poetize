Living life as best I can
It's hard being a decent man
Sometimes it seems like I just can't
Sex and the single man
A little kiss
A little wine
I start to have a real good time
Then those dirty thoughts start
Running through my mind
I'm trying hard to listen to the angel on my shoulder
But I hear on my left
That voice of death
Saying go ahead do it, do it
Sex and the single man
Living life as best I can
Kinda hard being a single man
In a world with so many women
It's rough
It's tough being a single man
Much too weak to resist them
I like the life and the feeling
Can't get my mind of of them
No, baby
Sex and the single man
You might also likeHere it comes
I feel it getting strong
Try and fight it
But she's turning me on
My resistance is just about gone
I live alone in Beverly Hills
Trying to fight off temptation
I don't want to do wrong
But I'm all alone
You just can't wait anymore
Sex and the single man
Situation out of hand
I think I like being a single man
In a world with so many women
Beautiful women
Sex and the single man
No promises to...
I mean, what the heck
No promises to...
Let me tell you something
I love being a single man
People ask will ever get a steady lady
I don't know
I'm still a little wild and crazy
Baby, let me finish it later
I just love it when you
Oh, don't touch me there
Sex and the single man
Situation out of hand
I think I like being a single man
In a world with so many women
Sex and the single man
