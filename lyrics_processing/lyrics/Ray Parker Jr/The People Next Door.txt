I live in Room 203
I got two cute girls living next door to me
One's name is Lucy and the other's Kim
Late at night, you can hear them so loud
They oughta be ashamed making strange noises
It sounds like a choo-choo train.  (Oooh, oooh.)
Now I'm not complaining

I wanna bang on the walls, rock on the floor
I wanna party like (Oooh) the people next door

Let me tell you 'bout my old lady
When we first met, we used to go head up every chance we get
Now times have passed and we're slowing down
Sometimes two weeks go by before we fool around
You're darn right I'm envious
'Cause what I'm hearing through my walls sounds like happiness
Kinky little baby, you're driving me crazy
'Cause I wanna do it too
I wanna bang on the walls, rock on the floor
I wanna party (Ow!) like the people next door
I wanna wake up the neighbors at a quarter to four
