Now I wanna come back home
I've been a bad boy
Now I wanna come back home
I admit that I was messing around
Playing macho man and being cool
But all along you knew right from the start
She was just playing me for a fool
Now that the love affair is over
Here I come running back to you
So go ahead, girl, and punish me
'Cause I deserve to be hurt too
I've been a bad boy
Now I wanna come back home
Please let me in
I've been a bad boy
Now I wanna come back home
I'll never do it again
I don't know what came over me
Let my friends tell me what to do
But I swear it'll never happen again
'Cause your love's too valuable to lose
I know it's hard to forgive me
'Cause I acted like a spoiled brat
Soon as the other woman left me
I had the nerve to come running back.  Hoo

But I am a man now, baby.  Mmmm

Give me one more chance
Never again will I do wrong.  Oh
