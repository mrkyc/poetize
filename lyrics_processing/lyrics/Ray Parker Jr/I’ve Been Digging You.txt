But I just couldn't find a way
I've been lovin' you for the longest
Took me this long just to say
First time I looked into your eyes
You were huggin' someone else
I never had a chance to tell you
I wanted you for myself
Now my timin' may be wrong
But I've already waited too long
I've been diggin' you for the longest
But I just couldn't find a way
I've been lovin' you for the longest
Took me this long just to say
It's kind of difficult knowin' he's your friend
I'm tryin' hard not to show it
But I can tell by that look on your face
You're givin' him that lovin', I just know it
It's never been my intention to steal
But I got to let you know how I feel
You might also likeI've been diggin' you for the longest
Oh, couldn't find a way
And I've been lovin' you, mmm
Took me this long just to say
I've been watchin' you, watchin' you, watchin' you, baby, oh
I've been lovin' you, lovin' you, lovin' you, baby, oh, smile
(Ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh)
Mmm
I could be foolin' myself
Into thinkin' I will be with you (Baby), mmm
Guess I could be dreamin'
But I kinda think you want it too
I've been waitin' for such a long time
Now I've got to tell you what's on my mind
I've been diggin' you for the longest
But I just couldn't find a way
I've been lovin' you for the longest
Girl, I finally found what to say
Watchin' you, watchin' you, baby
I move on the slide
And I've been lovin' you, can't you tell
These feelings I just cannot hide
I've been diggin' you, oh
Na-na-na-na, oh...oh...
And I've been lovin' you for the longest, baby
Ow
I've been diggin' you
I've been watchin' you
