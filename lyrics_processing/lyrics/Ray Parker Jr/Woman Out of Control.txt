I've got a woman out of control
A woman out of control
You never seen nothing so cold
Like a woman out of control
When we met
She was still very young
(She was young)
Yeah
(So young)
She had no experience
I was her first one
(Her first)
Mmm
(For her)
Who knows what her and her friends discussed
(Sure ain't monogamy)
All at once
She started getting curious
(To see what else is out there)
Says I'm holding her back
(?)
Mmm

(You can't hold her back)
No
(She don't wanna stop)
(?)
Oh

A woman out of control
You never seen nothing so cold
Like a woman out of control
I taught her every little trick she knows
(I showed her)
Yeah
(For her to)
For her to show it off to another man
(I'm hurting)
Mmm
(I'm hurting)
Listen, I recall when she was to nice
(Too nice to love me)
Now she claims variety is the spice
(She don't really like it)
She don't know
(She's young and excited)
(I can't change her mind)
No
(I can't make her stop)
No

(No, no)
(The girl is too hot)

The lady is out of control
(Woman out of control)
(Yeah, whoa)
Mmm
This has definite effect on my ego
'Cause she feels there must be
More to life than loving me
Mmm
She's a runaway child
Running wild
Searchin' for her freedom
(Whoa, yeah, yeah)
Mmm
(Can't change her mind)
Oh
