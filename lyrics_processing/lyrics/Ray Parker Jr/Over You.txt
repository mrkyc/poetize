Over you
Here we go lovin' again
I can't tell the start from the end
Over you
That's what I said so that I could pretend
That I was over you
You could see through my disguise
All the love still here in my eyes
Over you
I've said it so long that I honestly thought
I was over you

Then when I saw you tonight
I knew in my heart
You never left me

Oh, all this time
I was just foolin' myself
After you there's nobody else
After you
So here we go lovin' again and again and again

You might also like
Over you
I've said it so long that I honestly thought
I was over you
Then when I saw you tonight
I knew in my heart
You never left me
(Ooh, ooh) Never, never (Hey, hey, hey)

All this time (All this time)
I was just foolin' myself (I was just foolin' myself)
'Cause after you there's nobody else
Oh (No) After you
So here we go lovin' again and again
I was over you
I thought I was over you
Never will be over you

Oh, she don't touch me (Hey, babe) like you do, girl (Woo, woo, woo)
Come on love me, baby (I'm not over you, I've tried, I've tried)
Oh, she don't love me like you do (He don't do it like you do, no)
I'm over you (Not your kisses)
She don't kiss me like you do, girl
(He don't touch me, he don't move)
Oh (He don't love me, he don't groove me)
Oh, come on do it, baby (Let's do it again)
Yes, just do it again
(Do it one more 'cause you've blown my mind) Yeah
(I, I...) I'm not over you
(He don't move) She don't groove me
(He don't do me like you do) No, baby
