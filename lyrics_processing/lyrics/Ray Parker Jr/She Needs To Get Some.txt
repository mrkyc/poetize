Has she had an attitude, or been unusually rude?
Ah babe, could it be that she feels neglected
That she's trying to tell you sometingh
In her own war without words, maybe
She needs to get some
It's so obvious, she needs to get some
Right now, right away
She needs to get some
Give her some attention
She needs to get some
Don't you leave her like this no more
She needs to get some
When was the last time you spent time with your lady mmm
And really listen to what she says
Does it matter to you any way
Maybe, you better pay her more attention
Before some guy like me
Comes along who can see
I think she needs to get some
Move over, Romeo
Cause I have what's right
I pop up on the scene
When your girl is uptight
Cause she needs what I gotta give is positive
Now watch how I live
Hello hum, hmmm, tsk, tsk what's the matter
Please don't cry, I have time, we can chatter
Oh, your man don't understand that you need affection
All you want is love, security and protection
Man oh man, I want to know, what's wrong
What's going on, are the men not strong
You better wake up and realize she's the one
Your girl looks good and ah, she needs to get some
You might also likeShe needs to get some

To keep her satisfied
