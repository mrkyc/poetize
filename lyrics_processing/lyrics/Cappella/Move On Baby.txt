'Cause he doesn't feel a thing for you
You can try to move on so nothing will go wrong
Maybe he will be back to search for you, oh
Back on the track, it's me, yeah, Fixxit
I proved my point and now we mix it
Yeah, the A, double L Star Fresh, and I got to it together
To make the track flow better
That's why we stand strong, now you know what's up
If i'm on the move I can't stop
The beat is simple but you can't refuse it
That's why I love music
Move on, baby, move on, baby
Move on, baby, and we get together
Move on, baby, move on, baby
Move on, baby, and we get together
Move on, baby, move on, baby
Move on, baby, and we get together
Move on, baby, move on, baby
Move on, baby, and we get together
Take the chance, giving all that you can
If he doesn't feel a thing of you
You can try to move along so nothing will go wrong
Maybe he will be back to search for you, oh

I stay funky like this and I bring
Beats to move you so I can prove you
That I can rock a microphone like I used to
I love music, yeah, can you feel it
Check me out, this is how I deal it
The bass, the mid, the treble, I just fuse it
Together, 'cause I love music
Move on, baby, move on, baby
Move on, baby, and we get together
Move on, baby, move on, baby
Move on, baby, and we get together
Move on, baby, move on, baby
Move on, baby, and we get together
Move on, baby, move on, baby
Move on, baby, and we get together
Move on, baby, move on, baby
Move on, baby, and we get together
Move on, baby, move on, baby
Move on, baby, and we get together
