We bend our knees
Oh Spirit come make us humble
We turn our eyes
From evil things
Oh Lord we cast down our idols
So give us clean hands
And give us pure hearts
Let us not lift our souls to another
Give us clean hands, oh God
Give us pure hearts
Let us not lift our souls to another
Oh God this be
A generation that seeks
Who seeks Your face, Oh God of Jacob
Oh God this be
A generation that seeks
Who seeks Your face, Oh God of Jacob
We bow our hearts - spoken
We bow our hearts
We bend our knees
Oh Spirit come make us humble
We turn our eyes - spoken
We turn our eyes
From evil things
Oh Lord we cast down our idols
