Oh, did I lose the words
Or did you take them away?
I can hear you calling
Yeah we burn just the same
The same, the same, the same

I'm such a fool to love you
Give me the pain I'm used to
Sharpen the blade because
It just don't feel the same

In the seams we weaved
Twisted between the sheets
Sent coursing through my veins
Touch your lips to mine
Discord and harmonize
Release into the wild, oh whoa

I'm such a fool to love you
Give me the pain I'm used to
Sharpen the blade because
It just don't feel the same

That burning urge that wants to
I'm digging deeper but
It just don't feel the same

I'm such a fool to love you
Give me the pain I'm used to
Sharpen the blade because
It just don't feel the same
Another ghost to haunt you
That burning urge that wants to
I'm digging deeper but
It just don't feel the same
I'm such a fool to love you
Give me the pain I'm used to
Sharpen the blade because
It just don't feel the same
Another ghost to haunt you
That burning urge that wants to
I'm digging deeper but
It just don't feel the same

Give me the pain I'm used to
Sharpen the blade because
