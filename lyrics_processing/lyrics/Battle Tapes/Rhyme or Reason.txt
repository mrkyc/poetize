I'm the back then
The forgotten story you never tell
I'm the shed skin
I'm the discontent
I'm the came and went
I'm the lie you tell, the lie you tell yourself
The lie you tell, the lie you tell yourself
I'm the lights out
I'm the guard down
The bated breath you take, you take and hold
I'm a shade of doubt
I'm the mask and shroud
I'm the burning out
I'm the lie you tell, the lie you tell yourself
If we make just one thing clear for the record baby
There ain't no rhyme, there ain't no reason to be saved from
If we make just one thing clear for the record baby
There ain't no rhyme or reason
There ain't no rhyme or reason
If we make just one thing clear for the record baby
There ain't no rhyme, there ain't no reason to be saved from
If we make just one thing clear for the record baby
There ain't no rhyme or reason
There ain't no rhyme or reason
You might also likeI know the feeling when you've lost more than you've ever found
You want an explanation, as if there any doubt
Don't make this more complicated then you already have
You say it's now or never, you say it's all in the past
So you hope and you pray you until you capsize
Cause the gods they don't favor any one side
When you're pretending you're not buried in a landslide
It's hard to hold your head up high
I'm the lie you tell, the lie you tell yourself
If we make just one thing clear for the record baby
There ain't no rhyme, there ain't no reason to be saved from
If we make just one thing clear for the record baby
There ain't no rhyme or reason
There ain't no rhyme or reason
If we make just one thing clear for the record baby
There ain't no rhyme, there ain't no reason to be saved from
If we make just one thing clear for the record baby
There ain't no rhyme or reason
