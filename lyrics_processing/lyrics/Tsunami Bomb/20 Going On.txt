Tired at twenty years old
Memory collecting before his time
Recall, the old stompin' ground
I see a tear welling up in his eye
No, you can't cheat time
Don't let that control your life
Hold your breath, close your eyes
Just jump in, the water's fine
These pleas, fall on deaf ears
Ears that were once tuned to truth
A dated, washed up, old man
Has seen it all, nothing else for him to do
No, you can't cheat time
Don't let that control your life
Goes over your head, look over your shoulder
When you look back you're that much older
(It slips away)
Be what you're becoming
(It slips away)
And not who you were
(It slips away)
Grab hold of the here and now while you still have the chance
You might also likeSo are you giving up now?
As for adventures you've had your fill
Who says you're over the hill?
I think it was you, and you know very well
No, you can't cheat time
Don't let that control your life
Goes over your head, look over your shoulder
When you look back you're that much older
(It slips away)
Be what you're becoming
(It slips away)
And not who you were
(It slips away)
Grab hold of the here and now while you still have the chance
You're holding yourself back
(Turn your face to the day)
When you could be doing anything
(Don't just dig your own grave)
When will you trust yourself?
(Take with you what you learn)
The same as I do
(Be yourself, not who you were)
I want to see
You use your capabilities
Build me an ocean, then destroy it with your own
(It slips away)
Be what you're becoming
(It slips away)
And not who you were
(It slips away)
