I know I'm not enough sometimes
I know that I'm too much sometimes
But you're still here, my love
I know, I know, I know, you wanna walk away
But something in me makes you stay
I can feel it in your touch

I used to turn off my phone
I used to never come home
You ask me where have I been
And I would lie to your face
But I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't

You were there for me when I was falling apart
And I let you down, it left a mark on your heart
I'll never let go again, I'll never let go again
I'll never let go again
You got healing hands
And I swear to God that I'm a better man
You're changing me with the touch of your hand
I'll never let go again, I'll never let go again
I'll never let go again
You got healing hands
You might also like
I know, I know, I know, I know, I've broken all your trust it seems
Promising that I've come clean
But darling don't give up
If I get drunk in the park
Stumble home in the dark
Break into the apartment
Set off all the alarms
Say you won't
You won't, You won't, You won't

You were there for me when I was falling apart
And I let you down, it left a mark on your heart
I'll never let go again, I'll never let go again
I'll never let go again
You got healing hands
And I swear to God that I'm a better man
You're changing me with the touch of your hand
I'll never let go again, I'll never let go again
I'll never let go again
You got healing hands

I'll never let, healing
I'll never let, healing
I'll never let, healing
I'll never let, healing
(Healing hands)
I'll never let, healing
I'll never let, healing
You've got healing hands
You were there for me when I was falling apart
And I let you down, it left a mark on your heart
I'll never let go again, I'll never let go again
I'll never let go again
You got healing hands
And I swear to God that I'm a better man
You're changing me with the touch of your hand
I'll never let go again, I'll never let go again
I'll never let go again
You got healing hands

I'll never let, healing
I'll never let, healing
I'll never let, healing
I'll never let, healing
(Healing hands)
I'll never let, healing
I'll never let, healing
