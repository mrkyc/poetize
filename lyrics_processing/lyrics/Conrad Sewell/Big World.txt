Momma had a long birth
I broke my collar head first
Always misbehaving
But always appreciating
Always singing in the kitchen
Dolphin noises, I was different
Went to church something to believe in
Middle child syndrome, I ain't kidding nah

'Cause I care what they think
And I can't catch a break
So I use an a drink
'Cause they told me you're never gonna make it
But I was strong enough to take it
So look at me now
I thank God and I smile

It's a real big world after all
Let's get high in my car
Trip to the stars
Oh what a wonderful life
It's a real big world after all
Let's get lost in the dark
Shoot from the heart
Oh what a wonderful life
You might also like
I remember my first
And I remember my worst
And all the in between
All the memories
A little fuzzy, I was dizzy
Will Smith was getting jiggy
Skippin' class, California dreaming

And all the teachers didn't like my long hair
And they always compare
They say life just ain't fair
Boy, go get a career
And they told me you're never gonna make it
But I was strong enough to take it
So look at me now
I thank God and I smile

It's a real big world after all
Let's get high in my car
Trip to the stars
Oh what a wonderful life
It's a real big world after all
Let's get lost in the dark
Shoot from the heart
Oh what a wonderful life
I guess the stage is where I do belong
I guess it's where I really feel at home
Think I wrote about a million songs
To try to prove the world that they were wrong
I hope one day before I'm gone
I leave a legacy that people know
I hope I get the chance to tell my son
Boy, you should know

It's a real big world after all
Let's get lost in the dark
Shoot from the heart
Oh what a wonderful life
It's a real big world
It's a real big world
It's a real big world (a wonderful life, it's a wonderful thing)
