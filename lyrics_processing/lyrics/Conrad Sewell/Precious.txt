Harder, baby

I find it hard to sometimes see what's underneath
'Cause I'm older now and still be known to me
Oh, you can call it self-destruction or call it what you please
But it's safe to say we're all just human beings

But the hardest part of when you face the dark
And the pain that you fear doesn't disappear
So you drink to numb it and start blaming others
Oh, it's enough to make you call it quits
I said, I'm not giving, I'm not giving up

This life we live
Well, it's so hard to give
Well, it really is precious
It will leave you breathless
The train is gonna stop
And nobody wants to leave
To leave, my baby, I'm not giving up

(Woo)
(Woo)
You might also like
Trying to keep my feet on the ground, but my head's up in the clouds
I've been dreaming my whole life and I finally found my sound
I'm not a perfect man and nothing comes for free (Come on)
I work hard for the things I got, just to get me what I need

But the hardest part when you face the dark
And the pain that you fear doesn't disappear
Man, you drink to numb it and start blaming others
Oh, it's enough to make you call it quits
But I'm not giving, I'm not giving up

This life we live
Well, it's so hard to give
Well, it really is precious
Said it will leave you breathless
The train is gonna stop
And nobody wants to leave (Shut up)
Said I'm not giving, I'm not giving up

Ooh, la-da-da-da
Gonna live my life and shut the door for all of them
Ooh, baby, please
Oh, no, no, no
Don't stop living the now and we'll keep on shining
Then you know I've gotta be a man of my word
Don't hate me if you don't know me
Don't tell me if you can't show me
'Cause I'm not giving, I'm not giving up
I'm sure not going down, so bless this holy ground
Gonna make my family proud
Holding on to everything that I got
No, I'm never letting go
Gonna let my love shine, shine, shine, shine, shine
No, I'm not giving up

This life we live
Well, it's so hard to give
Well, it really is precious
And it will leave you breathless
The train is gonna stop
Come on, nobody wants to leave
And I'm not leaving, I'm not giving up
I'm not letting go, got that time for sure
It's not my kind of show
Go tell the Devil I'm not going
Tell Jesus I'm not coming
And I'm not leaving, I'm not leaving
You know you gonna give me, give me, give me, give me, give me some more
Give me, give me, give me some more
