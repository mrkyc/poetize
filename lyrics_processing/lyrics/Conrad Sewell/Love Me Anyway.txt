I know that liquor and drugs will never be enough
It's just temporary highs they never keep you up
I put my faith on the line
Because you believe in me
For all that I am, all that I'm not, all that I want to be
I'm trying to fight all my demons
Tryin' to reconcile
'Cause when I look in the mirror I'm not happy now
Let me into your  love and I'll come back around
For all that I am, all that I'm not, all that I want to be

Take to your river baby
You're the only one that could ever save me
Could you love me anyway?
Could you love me anyway?
Even when I'm throwing it all away
For all that I am, all that I'm not, all that I want to be

Through all of my flaws I know there's love inside
And you bring it out let me rehumanise
Wanna pull myself together open up my eyes
Yeah I apologise, baby I apologise
You might also like
Take to your river baby
You're the only one that could ever save me
Could you love me anyway?
Could you love me anyway?
Even when I'm throwing it all away
For all that I am, all that I'm not, all that I want to be
Could you love me anyway?
Could you love me anyway?
Even when I'm throwing it all away
For all that I am, all that I'm not, all that I want to be

Even when I lie and know you're wrong
You can put my heart back where it belongs
Even if I'm lost I'm not alone
Because you love me
Because you love me
Because you love me
Love me

Could you love me anyway?
Could you love me anyway?
Even when I'm throwing it all away
For all that I am, all that I'm not, all that I want to be
Could you love me anyway?
Could you love me anyway?
Even when I'm throwing it all away
For all that I am, all that I'm not, all that I want to be
