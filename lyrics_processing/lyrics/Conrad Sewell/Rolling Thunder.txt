Said I just saw your face on a subway
Fooled me twice
Said I just wanna say I did it my way
You were right

I don't want you fallin' for another stupid lie
Dancin' with the devil with me in and out of fights
It was breakin' us apart, truth is this is all we know

Just know that we're broken
There's so many words left unspoken
If I'm honest
I need you to be by my side, my side
If I roll like thunder
Who's gonna slow me down?
Oh, thank God I had a brother
Someone to show me how
When there's nothin' holdin'
Holdin' me on the ground
Oh, we're all a little bit broken
Tryna put it back somehow

I'll be screamin' at the cars so we confess
Take us home
Mm, I said you hold me when my chin falls to my chest
It's all we know
You might also like
I don't want you fallin' for another stupid lie
Dancin' with the devil, tellin' you to come inside
It was breakin' us apart, truth is this is all we know

Know that we're broken
There's so many words left unspoken
When the night ends
I need you to be by my side, my side
If I roll like thunder
Who's gonna slow me down?
Oh, thank God I had a brother
Someone to show me how
When there's nothin' holdin'
Holdin' me on the ground
Oh, we're all a little bit broken
Tryna put it back somehow

I said I believe in, I believe in, I believe in you
I believe in, I believe in, I believe in

If I roll like thunder
Who's gon' slow me down?
Thank God I had a brother
Someone that could show me how
You see, we're all a little bit broken
Tryna put it back somehow
I'm rollin' like thunder now
I guess we're rollin' like thunder now, oh
I believe in
Yeah, I said I believe in
I believe in you
I said I believe in
You know I believe in
