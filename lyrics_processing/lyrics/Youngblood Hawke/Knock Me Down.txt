Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa

I'm feeling hollowed out, rough to the bone
I'm scared of dying here all on my own
I'm a slave for you under factory heat
Working my life away for something to eat
I've never known a world outside these walls
I've heard the stories, stories that call
And they keep me up, thoughts of living free
I'll stand out there on my own two feet

Whoa, whoa
Won't knock me
Whoa, whoa
Won't knock me
Whoa, whoa
Won't knock me

Won't knock me down, won't knock me down (won't knock me)
Won't knock me down, won't knock me down (won't knock me)
Won't knock me down, won't knock me down (won't knock me)
Won't knock me down, won't knock me down

Born in the shadows of violent machines
Washing my brain of all that I believe
Was a slave for you now I'm breaking out free
I pulled the curtain back and now I can see
I duck my head into the cover of night
I'm sick of watching, watching 'em die
Make a run for the fences, yeah, I'm breaking free
I'll stand out there on my own two feet

Whoa, whoa
Won't knock me
Whoa, whoa
Won't knock me
Whoa, whoa
Won't knock me

Won't knock me down, won't knock me down (won't knock me)
Won't knock me down, won't knock me down (won't knock me)
Won't knock me down, won't knock me down (won't knock me)
Won't knock me down, won't knock me down

Won't knock me
Won't knock me
Won't knock me
Won't knock me down, down, down, down (won't knock me)
Won't knock me down, won't knock me down (won't knock me)
Won't knock me down, won't knock me down (won't knock me)
Won't knock me down, won't knock me down (won't knock me)
Won't knock me down, down, down, down (won't knock me)
Won't knock me down, down, down, down
(Won't knock me)
Won't knock me down, down, down, down
(Won't knock me)
