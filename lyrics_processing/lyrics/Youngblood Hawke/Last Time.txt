You don't get a second chance to make the same mistakes
That break our bones 'cause we already kno-o-ow
There's a place between the trenches when the bullets fly
That'll take us to the tunnels, we don't need to find
Our way back home 'cause we already kno-o-ow
(This is the last time, this is the last time
This is the last time, this is the last time)
I turn to you now while the cliffs are falling
Into the sea, when the world comes crawling
Follow, get down, 'cause there's nothing back there
This is the last time, this is the last time
Turn out the lights while tomorrow's leaving
Don't take your time when the world is leaving
Follow, get down to the waves 'cause we know
This is the last time, this is the last time now
This is the last time, this is the last time now
This is the last time, this is the last time now
You never think the bitter winner's gonna call your name
Dissappeared into the dark, I watch your tail lights fade
Away so slow, but we already kno-o-ow
There's a window with a view, but it's broken into two
It's the only way to get back to the last time that you show
And I can't let it go-o-o-o

Into the sea, when the world comes crawling
Follow, get down, 'cause there's nothing back there
This is the last time, this is the last time
Turn out the lights while tomorrow's leaving
Don't take your time when the world is leaving
Follow, get down to the waves 'cause we know
This is the last time, this is the last time now
This is the last time, this is the last time now
This is the last time, this is the last time now
(This is the last time...)
I'll break it out
From the shaken ground
'Fore I make it loud
From the shaken
All around, around...
Turn to you now while the cliffs are falling
Into the sea, when the world comes crawling
Follow, get down, 'cause there's nothing back there
This is the last time, this is the last time now
Turn out the lights while tomorrow's leaving
Don't take your time when the world is leaving
Follow, get down to the waves 'cause we know
This is the last time, this is the last time now
This is the last time, this is the last time now
