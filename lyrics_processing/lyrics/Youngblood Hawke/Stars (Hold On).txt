Chasing after your restless heart
Mind is buzzing like Helicopters
Cutting quickly through the dark
Smoke is pouring from my windows
And I'm reaching out my hands
Hoping someone's at my fingertips
That can help me understand
That we've all got the sun to follow
That we've all got the sun to follow-ow-ow
Hold on, hold on
The stars are bound to change
Hold on, hold on
Wait for another day
Hold on, hold on
The future's not that far away-ay
Oh whoa whoa, oh whoa whoa
Oh whoa whoa, oh whoa whoa
Oh whoa whoa, oh whoa whoa
Oh whoa whoa, oh whoa whoa
Yelling for the sun as the water rises
Feeling like smoke, filling up your eyes
Swinging at a ghost, go and lock that door
Leave that wreckage, let it wash ashore
You might also likeGo save yourself up, it's a hell of a ride
Feel your heart racing in the middle of the night
Step out of your mind into the wild, wild, wild, wild
That we've all got the sun to follow
That we've all got the sun to follow-ow-ow
Hold on, hold on
The stars are bound to change
Hold on, hold on
Wait for another day
Hold on, hold on
The future's not that far away-ay
Oh whoa whoa, oh whoa whoa
Oh whoa whoa, oh whoa whoa
Oh whoa whoa, oh whoa whoa
Oh whoa whoa, oh whoa whoa
Oh whoa whoa, oh whoa whoa
Oh whoa whoa, oh whoa whoa
Oh whoa whoa, oh whoa whoa
Oh whoa whoa, oh whoa whoa
We're all fighting to make something for ourselves
Hold on, hold on
The stars are bound to change
Hold on, hold on
Wait for another day
Hold on, hold on
The future's not that far away-ay
Oh whoa whoa, oh whoa whoa
Oh whoa whoa, oh whoa whoa
Oh whoa whoa, oh whoa whoa
Oh whoa whoa, oh whoa whoa
Oh whoa whoa, oh whoa whoa
Oh whoa whoa, oh whoa whoa
Oh whoa whoa, oh whoa whoa
