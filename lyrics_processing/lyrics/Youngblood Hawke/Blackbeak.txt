Don't let it fade away
So as far as we go
I follow myself
Paint my face red
My face says "help"
Believing in me
Reason I'm around
What you have in your hands
Pale steam ahead
Might be the farthest away
So save a spot
Next to me in bed at home
But baby you'll be gone
Grapes dripping blood
Along the skinny vines
Skeletons we leave behind
Something's gotta give
Under the thundering light
Someone's gotta live higher
Than the jets tear by
Acknowledge what you have in your hands
Out in the rain
It's alright to walk back
Just not the same as you left
You might also likeSo as far as we go
I follow myself
Paint my face red
My face says "help"
Believing in me
Reason I'm around
What you have in your hands
Don't let the bird fly away
Or turn into a crow
Black beak and stork
Black beak and stoic
Black beak is loaded
You can't help who you're falling for
When you just fall
The white cliffs of Cortez
Never seemed that tall
I think I need it all
So find something, fill the time
And I'll know you'll do the same when we climb
Someone's gotta give
Under the thundering night
Someone's gotta live
Like they're living their whole life
Acknowledge what you have in your hands
Out in the rain
It's alright to walk back
Just not the same as you left
So as far as we go
I follow myself
Paint my face red
My face says "help"
Believing in me
Reason I'm around
What you have in your hands
Don't let the bird fly away
Or turn into a crow
Black beak and stork
Black beak and stoic
Black beak is loaded
As far as we go
As far as we go
As far as we go
So as far as we go
I follow myself
Paint my face red
My face says "help"
Believing in me
Reason I'm around
What you have in your hands
Don't let the bird fly away
Or turn into a crow
Black beak and stork
Black beak and stoic
Black beak is loaded
As far as we go
Don't let it fade away
As far as we go
Don't let it fade away
As far as we go
Although the records say
As far as we go
