When come running
We come running
We come running
We come running

Under a pale blue sky
You never felt so cold
Another sleepless night
How could you ever let go?
How do you recognize
The dirty face of gold
Behind that crooked line
Where you never knew you'd go

Headed for the open door
Tell me what you're waiting for
Look across the great divide
Soon they're gonna hear
The sound, the sound, the sound
When we come running
Never go where we belong
Echoes in the dead of dawn
Soon they're gonna know
The sound, the sound, the sound
When we come running
Whoa, whoa, oh, oh
Whoa, whoa, oh, oh
Whoa, whoa, oh, oh
The sound, the sound, the sound
When we come running
You might also like
When the world's gone quiet (whoa)
I see you dancing slow (whoa)
Feeling satisfied
Where you never knew you'd go

Headed for the open door
Tell me what you're waiting for
Look across the great divide
Soon they're gonna hear
The sound, the sound, the sound
When we come running
Never go where we belong
Echoes in the dead of dawn
Soon they're gonna know
The sound, the sound, the sound
When we come running
Whoa, whoa, oh, oh
Whoa, whoa, oh, oh
Whoa, whoa, oh, oh
The sound, the sound, the sound
When we come running

Days go by
Feeling broke and tired
Remember
Always remember
The sound, the sound, the sound
When we come running
The sound, the sound, the sound
When we come running
Headed for the open door
Tell me what you're waiting for
Look across the great divide
Soon they're gonna hear
The sound, the sound, the sound
When we come running
Whoa, whoa, oh, oh
The sound, the sound, the sound
When we come running
Whoa, whoa, oh, oh
The sound, the sound, the sound
When we come running

Whoa, whoa, oh, oh
Whoa, whoa, oh, oh
When we come running
Whoa, whoa, oh, oh
Whoa, whoa, oh, oh
