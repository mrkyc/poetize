We're all watchers on the edge of the world
We're all talkers on the edge of the world
We're all spinning on the edge of the world
On the edge of the world, on the edge of the world
We're all robbers on the edge of the world
We're all brawlers on the edge of the world
We're all tearing on the edge of the world
On the edge of the world, on the edge of the world

No matter where that I go
No matter where that I've gone
I work for the church just to do what I want
Suddenly you're released and I can see everything
Flying high above, they're looking down on me
No matter where that we go
No matter where that we've been
Forget our mistakes just to make them again
The truth will bleed you out, we'll never see anything
Flying high above, they're watching down on things

I won't break under all the waiting
I won't take the time to face it
All the bad things that we've done were yesterday
Yesterday

We're all watchers on the edge of the world
We're all talkers on the edge of the world
We're all spinning on the edge of the world
On the edge of the world, on the edge of the world
We're all robbers on the edge of the world
We're all brawlers on the edge of the world
We're all tearing on the edge of the world
On the edge of the world, on the edge of the world

We keep on pushing ahead
We keep on pushing along
It's worse in the West, the whole neighborhood's gone
Suddenly you're bleached and you can't see anything
Hiding under our desks, it's raining down on me
What happened to our street
When we all drove back home?
We all kept to ourselves but we're never alone
Suddenly you're free but you can't be anything
I slip away in the night just to let you breathe

I won't break under all the waiting
I won't take the time to face it
All the bad things that we've done were yesterday
Yesterday
We're all watchers on the edge of the world
We're all talkers on the edge of the world
We're all spinning on the edge of the world
On the edge of the world, on the edge of the world

You walk through the valley you never could see
And you're telling the people the things that they need
You know you're right, you know you're right
Before the dawn, before the light
The night will descend on the valley and show
That the people are yelling and stirring below
They know they're right, they know they're right
Before the change, before the sky
Buzzed with the hidden and vast enemies
Who were clouding the sunset with smoke to the sea
You know you're right, you know you're right
Before you left, before goodbye
The people revolted all covered in black
And they blocked out the moon with the dust from the blast
They know they're right, they know they're right
They have to bleed just to survive
We're all watchers on the edge of the world
We're all talkers on the edge of the world
We're all spinning on the edge of the world
On the edge of the world, on the edge of the world
We're all robbers on the edge of the world
We're all brawlers on the edge of the world
We're all tearing on the edge of the world
