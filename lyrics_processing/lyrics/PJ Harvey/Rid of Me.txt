Night and day

I beg you, my darling
Don't leave me, I'm hurting
Lick my legs, I'm on fire
Lick my legs of desire
I'll tie your legs
Keep you against my chest
Oh, you're not rid of me
Yeah, you're not rid of me
I'll make you lick my injuries
I'm gonna twist your head off, see

Don't you, don't you wish you never, never met her?
Don't you, don't you wish you never, never met her?
Don't you, don't you wish you never, never met her?
