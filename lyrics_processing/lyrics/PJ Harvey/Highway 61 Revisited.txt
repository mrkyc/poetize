Welfare department would give him no clothes
He asked poor Howard, "Where can I go?"

Said, "Yes, that can be easily done
Just take them down on that 61"

But the second mother with the seventh son
They were out on that Highway 61

Trying to create the next world war
And he found a promoter, fell on the floor
