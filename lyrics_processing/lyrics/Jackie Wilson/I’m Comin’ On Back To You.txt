And I'm comin', now (comin')

My little girl

When I said I loved you, did you think I was a liar?

But only your touch can thrill me through and through

And I miss your tenderness
Oh, the way you thrill me so
I  when I'm a feelin' low

So I'm a packin' my bags, I'm gonna be home soon
I'm gonna knock at your door, chase away your blues
Woman, nobody else can ever take your place
Oh woman, nobody else can do the things you do

That's why I'm comin' (comin')
