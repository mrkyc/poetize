Ooh, I can't believe what you told me
You know that I'd never hit and tell
You got me right where you want me
With candy apples and sweet caramel

You know I won't say a word
Yea, we can keep it discreet
Darling, no one in the world
It's just between you and me

If I gotta be your cheap back seat lover
Cruising down the street to nowhere
If I gotta be your cheap back seat lover man
Well let's get it on then

Ooh, I seen you with your girlfriends
Pretending like you never give it away
Ooh, you look a little nervous
You wanna know if your secret is safe

Baby I won't say a word
Yeah, we can keep it discreet
Darling, no one in the world
It's just between you and me
You might also like
If I gotta be your cheap back seat lover
Cruising down the street to nowhere
If I gotta be your cheap back seat lover man
Well let's get it on then
Na na na na na na nana
Na na na nana
Na na na na na na nana
Well, let's get it on then

Ooh, If you wanted more, ooh baby
I could show you the possibilities
Oh girl, I just can't ignore what we could be
But if that's all there is, that's alright with me

If I gotta be your cheap back seat lover
Cruising down the street to nowhere
If I gotta be your cheap back seat lover man
Well let's get it on
I'll be your cheap back seat lover
Cruising down the street to nowhere
If I gotta be your cheap back seat lover man
Well let's get it on, then
Na na na na na na nana
Na na na nana
Na na na na na na nana
Well, let's get it on then
Na na na na na na nana
