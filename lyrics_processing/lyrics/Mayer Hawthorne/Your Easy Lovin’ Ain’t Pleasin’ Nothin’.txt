The way you move your hips
When you're struttin' down the street
Oh, it makes a man so weak in the knees
Lipstick on your lips
When you say those words so sweet
Lord, have mercy, darlin' I'm beggin' you, please

But when we're all alone girl
And there's no one else in sight
And I'm holdin' you so tight and so true
Well, then you pull away girl
Just when I think that I'm home
And you leave me all alone
And I'm feeling so blue, oh

Your easy lovin' ain't pleasin' nothin', baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Forget teasing loving, I need that tender loving
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Come on

You know I need you, girl
Come on darlin', don't be scared
It's as natural as the birds and the bees
Out there on the floor
When you're dancing next to me
Oh, have mercy, darlin'
I'm begging you, please
You might also like
But when we're all alone, girl
And there's no one else in sight
And I'm holdin' you so tight and so true
Well then you pull away, girl
When there's magic in the air
And you leave me hangin' there
And I'm feelin' so blue

Your easy lovin' ain't pleasin' nothin', baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Forget teasing loving, I need that tender loving
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Oooh, I don't want nobody else
When I got you by yourself
Come on, come on

Your easy lovin' ain't pleasin' nothin', baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Forget teasing loving, I need that tender loving
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Oooh, say it one more time)
Your easy lovin' ain't pleasin' nothin', baby
Yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Forget teasing loving, I need that tender loving
