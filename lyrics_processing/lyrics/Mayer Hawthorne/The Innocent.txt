She walks into the room and all the lights
Flicker violently
Keep your head down
No one makes a sound
Her boots are made from souls of stronger knights
Sitting silently
She stalks her prey
And no one gets away

She's got it
And you want it
She's got it
And you want it
She's got it
The innocent
Are never seen again
She's got it
And you want it (And once she's on your track)
She's got it
And you want it (You're never comin' back)
She's got it
The innocent
Are never seen again
You might also like
She orders up a shot of Aberlour
The tender starts to pour
With trembling hands
They all understand
She spins her barstool 'round and walks my way
And it's too late to pray
I hold my breath
Surrender to my death

She's got it
And you want it
She's got it
And you want it
She's got it
The innocent
Are never seen again
She's got it
And you want it (And once she's on your track)
She's got it
And you want it (You're never comin' back)
She's got it
The innocent
Are never seen again
And when she's got you in her arms it's like a lullaby
The sweetest song you've ever heard, that's my word
She'll make you feel like you're not just one of the other guys
But when you sleep you'll rest assured

She's got it
And you want it
She's got it
And you want it
She's got it
The innocent
Are never seen again
She's got it
And you want it (And once she's on your track)
She's got it
And you want it (You're never comin' back)
She's got it
The innocent
Are never seen again

She's got it
And you want it
She's got it
And you want it
She's got it
The innocent
Are never seen again
She's got it
And you want it
She's got it
And you want it
She's got it
The innocent
