It's the end of the night
Yeah, I had a good time too
You know it doesn't have to end here
I know we only recently met
We don't know each other very well yet
But I can't help but feel like
We've got something special between us
And I just

I really wanna get to know you
I wanna learn you inside out
I really wanna get to know you
We can have some fun right now
I really wanna get to know you
I wanna make you feel alright
I really wanna get to know you
And we can get it on tonight
On tonight
So here we are
At the end of the evening
I can tell that you're feeling
Like you don't want it to be
It's getting late
And we're here at your doorstep
But you feel you don't know yet
If you can go there with me
You might also likeSomething's going on inside of you
(You don't know what to do)
This much I can tell
But you don't know me that well

I really wanna get to know you
I wanna learn you inside out
I really wanna get to know you
We can have some fun right now
I really wanna get to know you
I wanna make you feel alright
I really wanna get to know you
And we can get it on tonight
On tonight
So here we are
And the tension is building
Your defenses are wilting
As every moment goes by
I don't wanna wait
No, and it's not how we planned it
But you can't finally stand it
We oughta give it a try
Something's going on inside of me
(This love was meant to be)
This much I can tell
But you don't know me that well
I really wanna get to know you
I wanna learn you inside out
I really wanna get to know you
We can have some fun right now
I really wanna get to know you
I wanna make you feel alright
I really wanna get to know you
And we can get it on tonight
On tonight
I really wanna get to know you
I wanna make you feel brand new
I really wanna get to know you
