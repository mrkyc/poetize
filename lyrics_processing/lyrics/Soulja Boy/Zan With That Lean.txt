SOD (I'm in my xan with that lean)
Money Gang
Soulja (Xan with that lean)
Kwon (Xan with that lean)
JMoney, JMoney, Xan with that...

I'm in my Xan with that lean, smoke nothin' but Irene
The hoes going crazy when I'm on the scene
Racks on the way, busting out them jeans
I keep the hammer on me, I ain't worried 'bout a thing
I got all these bands on me, all this ice on me
All these hoes on me, everything on me
Xan with that lean, nothin' but Irene
The hoes going crazy when I'm on the scene

Gotta go to the mall (Juice), I gotta pull a band (Juice)
Fall off in the club, and I'm leaning like kickstand (Juice)
All the ice on me (Juice), all the band on me (Juice)
All the racks on me, it's a masterpiece (Juice)
Got the hoes scream my name, put your life to shame
In the turning lane, in that droptop fire flame
Bentley on them 4's got me shittin' on they ass
When I step inside the club with them muthafuckin' xans
SB my name, man you know that game
SOD all day, put that shit straight to your face
Boy beat the case, now he got them racks
Now he got them hoes, now he got them tats

Kush is on me (Juice), with JMoney (Juice)
Running down I20, I'm looking for some freaks
Yellow diamonds shawty, man 100k a piece
Hop inside the VIP and all the girls on me
Xan with that lean, Soulja Boy be clean
True Religion jeans, shit you never seen
Fresh up on the scene with that high right low left
Man the boy got wealth, girls can't help they self
Girls going wild, lifting up they shirts
Pull up in that Lambo, that bitch go skrrt skrrt
Everywhere I go, you know I'm putting in that work
SOD my turf, hit 'em where it hurt
