Steph, your first year, you won twenty-six games
Your second year, you win thirty-six
You talked about the changing perception of what it meant to be a Warrior
What does it mean now?
World Champs
Uh, this is truly special
This group is a special group from the time we started the season
This is what we envisioned and a lot of hard work goes into it
And all the way down to the last minute of this game
This is what it's all about
To have our families here
All the team coaches, everyone be a part of it
