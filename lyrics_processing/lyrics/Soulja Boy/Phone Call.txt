Huh? (Get that nigga on the phone, man)

I got a hundred K on my left wrist, I got a fifty K on my right

And if a nigga try to fuckin' rob me, then nigga gon' die tonight
Call all my fucking niggas up and tell them, "It's time to ride"
See, Zaytoven, that's my nigga, I've been fucking with him forever
Pull up on the block, like I'm Floyd Mayweather
100K up on my watch, all these shots in my Glock
If a nigga diss me, I'ma blow his fucking top
SODMG man, I put that on the map
You catch me in that white Ferrari, and I'm riding with the strap
You catch me in that red Bentley, and I'm swerving off the map
You catch me in my bitch whip, she got a Jag' that's matte black
Bitch, I'm Soulja Boy Tell 'Em, and you know I'm getting guap
Bitch a Panamera, I catch a fucking block
It ain't nothing to lil' Soulja, 'cause I do this shit a lot
Shout out to my boys, they been holding down my spot
