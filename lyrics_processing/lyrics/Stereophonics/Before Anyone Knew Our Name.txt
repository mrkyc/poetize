I miss you, man
Before anyone knew our name
We had the fire, had desire
But what went wrong then?
It seemed so big in the eye of our storm
We couldn't have been further away from unknown
Who did we become? Amen, we were meant to be
Was that really your destiny?
Was that really your dream?
I don't really feel anyone else came close to how we see

We had the prize before our eyes
But we already had it all anyway
Driving round for hours on end
With the music on loud
Driving round in a scrapyard van
With the music on loud
I've laughed and cried,  I've confessed and I've lied
We built this thing from a dead end street
And now I'm looking around for you to see
I miss you, man

Before anyone knew our name
We had the fire
Before anyone knew our name
We had desire
Before anyone knew our name
I miss you, man
You might also like
The street's so quiet now
Run down and heavy
It used to be a laugh
Swimming pools of cries
Yeah, we said our sorry's
Yeah, we made our make ups
But that don't make up for what's missing now
We built this thing from a dead end street
You couldn't drive through, just take the bus or just meet
The mountain tops, they don't seem so high
The trees I climbed, they don't seem so high
I take my kids to see the world where we played
I miss you, man

Before anyone knew our name
We had the fire
Before anyone knew our name
We had desire
Before anyone knew our name
I miss you, man
Before anyone knew our name
We had the fire
Before anyone knew our name
We had desire
Before anyone knew our name
