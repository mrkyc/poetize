Back from LA
You tie your hair in a red band bow
When you greet me by the gate
Sip and stir from your coffee cup
And break bread crumbs on the floor
I fight my head 'cause I wanna drink
But I want you so much more
Oh what's the fuss all about?
I knew all the way today
Back to our place
You didn't care if I said too much
I could see that by your face
You sleep and stir when I pick you up
And drop your neck scarf on the floor
I fight my mind cause I wanna think
That I'll be here evermore
Oh what's the fuss all about?
Oh what's the fuss all about?
The bell rings aloud in the school yard sun
Young boys all they wanna do is run
The trees and the leaves and they blow in the breeze
And the blossoms are pale pink, the young girls sneeze
The swings in the park and the ghosts in the dark
The truths and the dare and the secrets we share
The things that we learn and the things that we earn
Embarrassing days and mistakes that we make
Jet streams in the sky
You're gone in the blink of an eye
Heavenly hugs and the shoulders you shrug
The bully, the boss and the priest and his cross
The letters we write and the wrongs you can't right
The space that we need in the loneliest weeks
Blows in the wind
Repenting our sins
The games that we play and the changes we make
The love and the light and the smiles you ignite
Skin on skin
You might also likeThe life that we chase, it feels like a race
To get to the place with the pride and the grace
It's hard to replace the touch of your face
When you're so far away
Are you lost? Are you found?
On this merry go round?
