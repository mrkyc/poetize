Tickled with a feather of congeniality
Oh oh oh oh oh
I'm done forth
I was staring at a mirror and lookin' for clarity
Stepping over cracks to avoid calamity
Oh oh oh oh oh
I'm done forth
Cause you can't count on anything
Accept that you can't count on anything
No, you can't count on anything
Accept that you can't count on anything
So give whatever you've got
Take your very best shot
I'm addicted to change
I don't care if it happens for me or not
I'm a rollin' rock
I'm an ocean drop
I'm addicted to the way that I feel when I get my brain to stop
Thinkin' so much
I was loosin' my grip on love and sanity
Feelin' it slip like rain to gravity

I'm down low
Always sneakin' on the past and livin' in memories
Tripping over traps flashbacks to apathy
Oh oh oh oh oh
I'm down low
Cuz you can't count on anything
Accept that you can't count on anything
No, you can't count on anything
Accept that you can't count on anything
So give whatever you've got
Take your very best shot
I'm addicted to change
I don't care if it happens for me or not
I'm a rollin' rock
I'm an ocean drop
I'm addicted to the way that I feel when I get my brain to stop
Thinkin' so much
Stop thinkin' so much
Ooh stop thinkin' so much
Ooh stop thinkin' so much
Stop thinkin' so much
Stop thinkin' so much
Ooh stop thinkin' so much
Ooh stop thinkin' so much
Just stop
So give whatever you've got
Take your very best shot
I'm addicted to change
I don't care if it happens for me or not (happens for me or not)
I'm a rollin' rock
I'm an ocean drop
I'm addicted to the way that I feel when I get my brain to stop
