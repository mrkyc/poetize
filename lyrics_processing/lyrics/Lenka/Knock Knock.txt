A second, a minute
A hour
A day goes by
I'm hopin' just to be by your side
I'm turnin' the handle
It won't open
Don't make me wait
'Cause right now I need your smile
Knock, knock

When life had locked me out, I turned to you
So open the door
'Cause you're all I need right now it's true
Nothin' works like you

Little louder
Little louder
Little louder
Knockin'
Little louder
Little louder

A warm bath, a good laugh
An old song
That you know by heart
I've tried it but they all leave me cold
So now I'm
Here waiting
To see you
My remedy for all that's been hurting me
Knock, knock
You might also like
When life had locked me out, I turned to you
So open the door
'Cause you're all I need right now it's true
Nothin' works like you

You seem to know the way
To turn my frown upside down
You always know what to say
To make me feel like everything's ok

Little louder
Little louder
Little louder
Knockin'
Little louder
Little louder
Little louder
Knockin'
Little louder
Little louder
Little louder
Knockin'
Little louder
Little louder
When life had locked me out, I turned to you
And you open the door
And you're all I need right now it's true
Nothin' works like you

When life had locked me out, I turned to you
And you open the door
And you're all I need right now it's true
Nothin' works like you

Little louder
Little louder
Little louder
Knockin'
Little louder
Little louder
Little louder
Knockin'
Nothin' works like you, oh oh
Little louder
Little louder
Little louder
Knockin'
Little louder
Little louder
Little louder
Knockin'
Little louder
Little louder
Little louder
Knockin'

When life had locked me out, I turned to you
And you open the door
And you're all I need right now it's true
