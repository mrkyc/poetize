At the end of the world
I will be there with you
And we'll throw a party to celebrate
The things we used to do
Like living life, breathing air
Running your fingers through my hair
Oh, this isn't fair

At the end of the world
I will hold you so close
So we won't notice the destruction
Of all we used to know
We will close our eyes
As the waters rise
We'll float away and you will say
"Oh, isn't this nice?"

Ah, at the end of the world
We'll be together, be together
Ah, if I can spend it with you
Then the end of the world don't matter
You might also likeAh, at the end of the world
We'll be together, be together
Ah, if I can spend it with you
Then the end of the world don't matter at all

At the end of the world
We will kiss for the last time
And we won't feel the earth collapse into
A mess of flood and fire
We'll be making love
As the sky above falls down over us
We'll be the luckiest ones

Ah, at the end of the world
We'll be together, be together
Ah, if I can spend it with you
Then the end of the world don't matter
Ah, at the end of the world
We'll be together, be together
Ah, we both know it's the end of the world but
We won't care because as long as we are together
Our love will last forever
At the end of the world
I will be there with you
And we'll throw a party to celebrate
The things we used to do

Ah, at the end of the world
We'll be together, be together
Ah, if I can spend it with you
Then the end of the world don't matter
Ah, at the end of the world
We'll be together, be together
Ah, if I can spend it with you
Then the end of the world don't matter
