We've been waiting, anticipating change coming our way
You're my baby through the bad lights to the greater days
I know that something good is waiting just around the corner
There's a new day dawning, there's a new life for us
Got to keep on holding on for just a little longer I know

But that it's gonna be blue skies for you and I
We'll step out of the shadows and walk into the light
Yeah, it's gonna be blue skies for you and I
But my heart beats slow as the storm carries on up high
And the clouds roll by

I can feel it, it's a comet, fast and fierce and wild
I can see it every time I look into those eyes
Tell me is it really gonna storm again
Will the sky turn dark? Will the rain begin?
I wanna be with you wherever lightning strikes cause I know

That it's gonna be blue skies for you and I
We'll step out of the shadows and walk into the light
Yeah, it's gonna be blue skies for you and I
But my heart beats slow as the storm carries on up high
You might also like
And the clouds roll by
And the clouds roll by
I couldn't stand the rain for one more day
I know we can make it go away
Can you feel it?
Like a fever, burning till it breaks

Blue skies for you and I
We'll step out of the shadows and walk into the light
Yeah it's gonna be blue skies for you and I
But my heart beats slow as the storm carries on up high
And the clouds roll by

Blue skies, blue skies (And the clouds roll by)
Blue skies, blue skies (And the clouds roll by)
Blue skies, blue skies (And the clouds roll by)
Blue skies, blue skies (And the clouds roll by)
