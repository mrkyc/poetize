Roll, roll with the punches
Roll, roll with the punches

That really hurt me
Like a fist to the face
I wasn't ready
To be knocked out of place
Suddenly everything I was sure of
Sinking below the depths of the surface
It's unexpected, it usually is
When you're rejected
Or you take a hit

Suddenly everything's thrown in a spin
No time to grow a thicker skin
What kind of situation am I in now?

When life tries to knock all the wind out of you
You've got to roll, roll, roll with the punches
If all life offers is black and blue
You've got to roll, roll, roll with the punches
You might also like
Little weapons over the phone
They like to threaten the life that I know
They say get over here and get into the ring
But I'm not really much of a fighter
My mechanisms of defense are down
My resistance is out on the town

I was alarmed by your attack
This isn't a boxing match
But I'll be damned if I ever let you win

When life tries to knock all the wind out of you
You've got to roll, roll, roll with the punches
If all life offers is black and blue
You've got to roll, roll, roll with the punches

When all I want is a little stability
Some time without any bruises
You go and tell me the things that I don't want to hear
Putting your fist into my ears
Filling me up with the dread and the fear leaving me all in pieces
Suddenly everything's thrown in a spin
No time to grow a thicker skin
What kind of situation am I in now?
When life tries to knock all the wind out of you
You've got to roll, roll, roll with the punches
If all life offers is black and blue
You've got to hold, hold, hold your head up high

When life tries to knock all the wind out of you
You've got to roll, roll, roll with the punches
If all life offers is black and blue
