I'm happy to be sad, it's funny when I'm mad
I don't really make sense, but I know that that's not bad
I'm lonely in a crowd and I am quiet when it's loud
No, I don't know what I want, but I'll figure it all out

I like to move around to a different beat
And walk away then smile down my own street
And I don't really mind when you are fake
Cause I am me and that's unique
I'm living in my own world every day
I'm partly by myself in my own way
Might look a little funny but that's okay
Cause I am me and that's unique

I am me and that's unique

I love you when you're mean, I feel dirty when I'm clean
No, I don't really make sense, but I know that you know what I mean
I'm hungry late at night and I'm tired when it's light
I've got my imperfections but I know that that's alright

I like to move around to a different beat
I'll walk away then smile down my own street
And I don't really mind when you are fake
Cause I am me and that's unique
I'm living in my own world every day
I'm partly by myself in my own way
Might look a little funny but that's okay
Cause I am me and that's unique
You might also like
Why should I be like everybody?
It's overrated being ordinary

I am me and that's unique

I like to move around to a different beat
I'll walk away then smile down my own street
And I don't really mind when you are fake
Cause I am me and that's unique
I'm living in my own world every day
I'm partly by myself in my own way
Might look a little funny but that's okay
Cause I am me and that's unique

I am me and that's unique
