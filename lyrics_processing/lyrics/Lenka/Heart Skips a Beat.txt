(Heart skips a beat, my heart skips a beat)
My heart is playing tricks on me
And it's building bricks on me
I can't break through
And I can't face you
My world is turning slowly now
But it's burnin' up somehow
I need some time
To know what's right

'Cause it's only in the quiet that I feel some relief

I'm tryin' hard not to resist the joy
Don't listen to me I'm being paranoid
I might try hard but it's too hard to avoid

My heart skips a beat
My heart skips a beat

My heart is always first to know
And as the feeling grows
I can't deny, push those thoughts aside
You might also likeMy world is full of loveliness
But I focus on the stress
My hearts says "go", but my brain says "no"

And it's only in the quiet that I hear myself breathe

I'm tryin' hard not to resist the joy
Don't listen to me I'm being paranoid
I might try hard but it's too hard to avoid

My heart skips a beat
My heart skips a beat
My heart skips a beat
My heart skips a beat

Oh I know this time 'cause it's physical
My blood has stopped and I am breathless as well
But I need a minute to convince myself
'Cause it's only in the quiet that I know what to feel

I'm tryin' hard not to resist the joy
Don't listen to me I'm being paranoid
I might try hard but it's too hard to avoid
My heart skips a beat
My heart skips a beat

I'm tryin' hard not to resist the joy
Don't listen to me I'm being paranoid
I might try hard but it's too hard to avoid

My heart skips a beat
My heart skips a beat

My heart skips a beat
