$200 worth of summer yard mowin' that I just had to spend
I had my eye on two things, but I could only pick just one
A young man's first decision; is it a guitar or a gun?
I can still hear daddy's voice say "now think about it son
One of these will last forever, and the other's just for fun
One can feed your family, and one will end you up in jail."
And he seemed to know which one was which, but me, I couldn't tell
I could learn to shoot like Jesse James, out there on the run
Or play guitar and be a Rolling Stone, now that just sounds like fun
A rock star or an outlaw, well either way I've won
When I walk out this door with a guitar or a gun
I've thought about it long and hard, as I held 'em in my hand
Standin' at the crossroads, still deciding who I am
They're both just wood and metal. Six bullets or six strings?
Whichever choice I make I'll leave here feeling like a king
Will I learn to shoot like Jesse James, out there on the run
Or play guitar and be a rolling stone, now that just sounds like fun
A rock star or an outlaw, well either way I've won
When I walk out this door with a guitar or a gun
A cool September morning, waitin' on the pawn shop to let me in
