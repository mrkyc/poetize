Hey old man, remember 1964?
With your hair long and curly tryin' to end the damn war?
When peace signs and marches, it shook you to the core?
But here we are again and I don't see you no more

For the times, they are not changing
It's the same as it was once before
You got yourself a little, turned your back on the middle
And now you just don't care anymore

Then the 70's came and you got a real job
You bought a house in the suburbs on a half-acre lot
They started busin' in children, and you quit smokin' pot
The prices went higher, and the whole world is shot

And the times, they are not changing
It's the same as it was once before
You got yourself a little, turned your back on the middle
And now you just don't care anymore

Then the 80's swept in with a new set of rules
And you sent your kids off to private all-lily-white schools
Kept your hand-me-down money, and your millionaire's jewels
Give 'em food stamps and welfare, don't complain you poor fools
You might also like
And the times, they are not changing
It's the same as it was once before
You got yourself a little, turned your back on the middle
And now you just don't care anymore

From the 90's 'til now, not a whole lot has changed
The rich folks keep the winnin's and make the rules to the game
And expect us somehow to just feel lucky to play
But we see it all get harder and harder each day

And the times, they are not changing
It's the same as it was once before
You got yourself a little, turned your back on the middle
And now you just don't care anymore

Now if this song hurts your feelings, that don't mean it ain't true
Just prob'ly means we're singin' 'bout you

The times, the are not changing
Its the same as it was once before
You got yourself a little, turned your back on the middle
And now you just don't care anymore
As soon as you got a little, you turned your back on the middle
