Everybody wants it but you know that it just ain't enough
I hear people out on the street playing the game
Every time I end up in it, it ends up the same
Don't wanna hear no talk about falling in love
I think I'll just spend my money on a nice used car
It may move a little slow but it'll carry me down to the bar
I can spend my time drinking not thinking of you
She may not be pretty but she knows what to do
Don't wanna hear no talk about falling in love
Say that you want a white veil
And a shiny new diamond ring
But I know what you really want honey
It ain't nothing but sex, lies and money
It ain't nothing but sex, lies and money
So now you found a man that you say you've been trying to find
And he calls you sweet names and follows you around all the time
Got a card made of platinum and a watch made of gold
I hope you both get happy, get fat and get old
Don't wanna hear no talk about falling in love
Said that you want her right there
And a shiny new diamond ring
But I know what you really want honey
It ain't nothing but sex, lies and money
It ain't nothing but sex, lies and money
You might also likeSaid that you want her right there
And a shiny new diamond ring
But I know what you really want honey
It ain't nothing but sex, lies and money
It ain't nothing but sex, lies and money
It ain't nothing but, it ain't nothing but
It ain't nothing but sex, lies and money
It ain't nothing but sex, lies and money
Oh, no, it ain't nothing but sex, lies and money
It ain't nothing but sex, lies and money
No, it ain't
No, it ain't
No, it ain't
No, it ain't
