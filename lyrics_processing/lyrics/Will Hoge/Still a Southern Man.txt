There's a flag flyin' overhead and I used to think it meant one thing
But now I've grown up and seen the world and I know what it really means
I wanted it to be the symbol of a boy who wasn't scared to take a stand
But now I know it's just a hammer driving nails in the coffin of a long-dead land
Oh, and I can't take it anymore

But I'm still a southern man
I don't want your Stars-and-Bars and your blood on my damn hands
I'm lookin' away now, Dixie, 'cause I've seen all I can stand
But I'm still a southern man

The line really ain't that thin between heritage and hate
One's sayin', "Yes ma'am" and "Thank you" and makin' sure you pull your own weight
The other's what happens when you try to hold down anybody that ain't just like you
You can call it what you want but it's a goddamn shame
And I'm glad I finally see the truth
Oh, I can finally see the truth

But I'm still a southern man
I don't want your Stars-and-Bars and your blood on my damn hands
I'm lookin' away now, Dixie, 'cause I've seen all I can stand
But I'm still a southern man
You might also like
You say, "Where's your rebel pride, boy?"
Well sorry, Mister, it's all gone
That flag ain't never led to one thing good
Tear it down, I wanna tear it down
But I'm still a southern man

I'm lookin' away now, Dixie, 'cause I've seen all I can stand
But I'm still a southern man
But I'm still a southern man
But I'm still a southern man
I'm lookin' away now, Dixie, 'cause I've seen all I can stand
But I'm still a southern man
Oh, I'm still a southern man
