I spent my small-town Saturdays watching a big 'ol movie screen
Hoping someday I'd be up there living all my dreams
And I could be a Hollywood hero
Make the girls all smile and weep
Think that someday they might have a boy like me
And I'd remember playing baseball
Standing on the pitcher's mound
Thinking someday a fastball might get me out of this town
Maybe I could wear the pinstripes, be a Yankee true and proud
But all that seems a million dreams away right now

Cause I met you and then I knew my big dreams were done
And I'd settle down in the same small town
And swear you were the one
Some might call it giving up, but it don't feel that way to me
I think it's just the two of us and our little bitty dreams

I remember I first met you, oh, how you loved to dance
Said you'd be a ballerina if you just had the chance
Maybe go to some big city, where nobody knows your name
Bathe in all the bright lights, and find your fortune and fame
You might also like
But I met you and then I knew that your big dreams were done
We'd settle down in the same small town
And you'd swear I was the one
Some might call it giving up, but it don't feel that way to me
I think it's just the two of us and our little bitty dreams

I remember you first told me a baby boy was on the way
And everything I thought I wanted, it just washed away

Cause I met you and then I knew my big dreams were done
I'd settle down in the same small town and try to raise a son
Some might call it giving up, but it don't feel that way to me
I think it's just the three of us and our little bitty dreams
