You always used to say
That's why everything you ever built
Is still standing here today
That old Camaro in the carport
The fence along the lane
All the walls in this old house
Right down to the family name
Mama said you always worried
You wouldn't leave that much behind
You can't make a million bucks
On some damned assembly line
But you threw every dime you could
Into that Folger's coffee can
Half to ten percent to Jesus
Twenty-five to Uncle Sam
Whoah-oh, story after story
Of all your faded glory
Is all I ever hope to live up to
Whoah-oh, know as I get older
I'm standing on your shoulders
Trying to be just like you
They don't make 'em like they used to
You might also like
Well you always used to warn me
About this highway I was on
Ain't no way to make a living
Squeezing pennies out of songs
And I may never build a castle
But the ends meet up somehow
Throwing coins into the coffee can
Oh if you could see me now
Whoah-oh; story after story
Of all your faded glory
Is all I ever hope to live up to
Whoah-oh; know as I get older
I'm standing on your shoulders
Trying to be just like you
They don't make 'em like they used to

Leather skin, tough as nails
Promises never failed
Solid as the gospel truth
They don't make 'em like they used to

Whoah-oh; know as I get older
I'm standing on your shoulders
Trying to be just like you
But they don't make 'em like they used to
They don't make 'em like they used to
Oh, they don't make 'em like they used to
They don't make 'em like they used to
They don't make 'em like they used to
