Another politician sittin' far away
Doesn't matter how many got gunned down today
As long as you can keep your re-election bills paid
You're just a whore to the guild that's called "The NRA"

They tell you how to vote and they sell you all their lies
And we watch as common sense just slowly dies
And now you got blood on your hands, oh but you don't care
You just sit back and send out your thoughts and prayers

Thoughts and prayers, thoughts and prayers
Don't give a damn about your thoughts and prayers
It's just spit and wind flyin' around in the air
Why don't you do your job up there
And keep your thoughts and prayers

There's a momma cryin' 'cause her baby won't come home
You tell a father that you're sorry that his son is gone
While you sit and do nothin' in that big white dome
And just hope we all forget to care

But you could'a done somethin' and we all wish that you would
To prove to the world you had one tiny ounce of good
But you'll blame somebody else for all this despair
And not do a thing but offer up your thoughts and prayers
You might also like
Thoughts and prayers, thoughts and prayers
Don't give a damn about your thoughts and prayers
It's just spit and wind flyin' around in the air
Why don't you do your job up there
And keep your thoughts and prayers

Someday when time finally takes its toll
And your Maker comes to call his final role
I hope he'll close up the gates and send you straight to hell
For the truth that you knew but got paid not to tell

And you'll beg and you'll cry: "Lord don't send me down there!"
"The devil made me do it," you'll say, "I'm sorry, I swear!"
And God will just laugh and tell you "I don't care"
Send you to the fire with just his thoughts and prayers

Thoughts and prayers, thoughts and prayers
Don't give a damn about your thoughts and prayers
It's just wasted words now and nobody cares
Why don't you do your job up there
And keep your thoughts and prayers
Keep your thoughts and prayers
