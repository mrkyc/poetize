Tell me again, mister, the one about
How you and your generation got it figured out
From what I've seen now, it ain't so grand
You keep your pockets fat and starve away your fellow man

Now see fresh-faced kids on the streets and on TV
Talking about tomorrow and how good they think it could be
You say they're crazy, ain't worth a shit
You say they don't know nothing
They're just some stupid kids

Oh stupid kids, don't listen to what the old folks say
You're the only ones that are ever gonna make things change
Keep your feet marching, raise up your voice, don't quit
Keep doing what you're doing, keep being stupid kids
Stupid kids

They'll try to break you and slow you down
Buy you out and tell you "Maybe later... not right now"
Don't let 'em fool you, stay wild and true
Don't let the man with everything to lose tell you what not to do
You might also like
Oh stupid kids, don't listen to what the old folks say
You're the only ones that are ever gonna make things change
Keep your feet marching, raise up your voice, don't quit
Keep doing what you're doing, keep being stupid kids
Stupid kids

Turn your music up, make up your own damn songs
You'll know you got it right when all the old white men don't sing along
Turn your music up, sing to your own damn songs
You know you got it right when all the old white men don't sing along

Oh stupid kids, don't listen to what the old folks say
You're the only ones that are ever gonna make things change
Keep your feet marching, raise up your voice, don't quit
Keep your feet marching, raise up your voice, don't quit
Keep doing what you're doing, keep being stupid kids
Stupid kids
