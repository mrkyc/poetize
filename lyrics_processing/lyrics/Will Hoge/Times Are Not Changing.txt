Hey, old man. Remember 1964?
With your hair long and curly trying to end the damn war?
With your peace signs and marches, it shook you to the core
But here we are again and I don't see you no more

And the times, they are not changin'
It's the same as it was once before
You got yourself a little, turned your back on the middle
And now you just don't care anymore

Then the 70's came and you got a real job
You bought a house in the suburbs on a half-acre lot
They started busin' in children, and you quit smokin' pot
The oil prices went higher, and the whole world is shot

And the times, they are not changin'
It's the same as it was once before
You got yourself a little, turned your back on the middle
And now you just don't care anymore

Then the 80's swept in with a new set of rules
You sent your kids off to private, all-lilly-white schools
Kept all your hand-me-down money, and your millionaire's jewels
Give 'em food stamps and welfare, "Don't complain, you poor fools"
You might also like
And the times, they are not changin'
It's the same as it was once before
You got yourself a little, turned your back on the middle
And now you just don't care anymore

From the 90's 'til now, not a whole lot has changed
The rich folks keep the winnings and make the rules to the games
And expect us somehow, to just feel lucky to play
But we see it all get harder and harder each day

And the times, they are not changin'
It's the same as it was once before
You got yourself a little, turned your back on the middle
And now you just don't care anymore

And if this song hurts your feelings, that don't mean it ain't true
Nah, it just means that we're probably singin' 'bout you

And the times, they are not changin'
It's the same as it was once before
You got yourself a little, turned your back on the middle
And now you just don't care anymore
Soon as you got a little, you turned your back on the middle
