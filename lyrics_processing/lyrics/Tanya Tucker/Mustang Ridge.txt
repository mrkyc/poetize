I'm never goin' back to Mustang Ridge
If I ever make it out alive
If you don't see me by the risin' sun
You'll know I had to take the dive
When the hounds are runnin' down Oso Creek
Like Arabs on the track
I'll be halfway 'cross the southern horn
Too late for turnin' back
And if I die tonight on the Hays Street Bridge
I ain't never goin' back to Mustang Ridge

I got my knee on the wheel and I'm feelin' free
With my hobnail on the gas
I just crossed over the county line
Tryna make it up to Wild Rose Pass
Now the radio's sayin' all hell broke loose
This mornin' at the Lockhart Jail
Now I'm flyin' like an angel on a dead man's run
I got the devil ridin' on my tail
(Yeah, I do)

I'm never goin' back to Mustang Ridge
If I ever make it out alive
If you don't see me by the risin' sun
You'll know I had to take the dive
When the hounds are runnin' down Oso Creek
Like Arabs on the track
I'll be halfway 'cross the southern horn
Too late for turnin' back
And if I die tonight on the Hays Street Bridge
I'm never goin' back to Mustang Ridge

Did you hear they found an old burnt-out car
Up in the Davis Hills?
And the Sheriff said on the evening news
"Nobody found, but they're lookin' still"
Now a woman's life ain't just a list
Of the worst things she has done
I leave you now with a heart of stone
Sometimes the past is hard to outrun

Never goin' back to Mustang Ridge
If I ever make it out alive
If you don't see me by the risin' sun
You'll know I had to take the dive
When the hounds are runnin' down Oso Creek
Like Arabs on the track
I'll be halfway 'cross the southern horn
Too late for turnin' back
And if I die tonight on the Hays Street Bridge
I'm never goin' back to Mustang Ridge

And if I die tonight on the Hays Street Bridge, oh Lord
I'm never goin' back to Mustang Ridge
I'm never goin' back to Mustang Ridge
