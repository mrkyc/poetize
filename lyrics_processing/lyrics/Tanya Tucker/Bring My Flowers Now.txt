So I said, "Listen, I got..." and I said, uh, somethin' about, uh, goin' to somebody's funeral or something. She... I said, "Man," I said, I said, "Bring my flowers now, while I'm living"

Bring my flowers now, while I'm living
I won't need your love when I'm gone
Don't spend time, tears, or money
On my old breathless body
If your heart is in them flowers, bring 'em on

All the miles cast a long shadow
I'd take a couple back if I could
I'd have learned to play guitar
Tell my daddy more I loved him
But I believe, for the most part, I done good

There's always sunrise and rainbows and babies
And the little things I cherish on my way
Even though one day
They'll bury me and Jesse Ray
I just know we're gonna ride again someday

Bring my flowers now, while I'm living
I won't need your love when I'm gone
Don't spend time, tears, or money
On my ol' breathless body
Well, if your heart is in them flowers, bring 'em on

The days are long, but the years are lightning
They're bright and they will never strike again
I wish I'd been a better friend
A better daughter to my mother
There's no going back when your back's against the wind

So if you got love, then you're sittin' on a gold mine
And you can't take it with you when you go
So don't wait to help your sister
Forgive your brother and your neighbor
We all think we've got the time until we don't

Bring my flowers now, while I'm living
I won't need your love when I'm gone
Don't spend time, tears, or money
On my old breathless body
If your heart is in them flowers, bring 'em on
