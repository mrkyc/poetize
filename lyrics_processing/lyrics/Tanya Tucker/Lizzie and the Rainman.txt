He came riding in on the sunrise
On a hot west Texas day
A fancy man in a painted wagon
With some fancy things to say
Looks like you folks need some water
Well, water is my game
And for the small price of $100
I betcha I can make it rain

Step back, non-believers
Or the rain will never come
Someone start that fire a-burning
Somebody beat the drum
He said some may think I'm crazy
For making all these claims
But I swear before this day is over
You folks are gonna see some rain

They all just stood there a-staring
Trying to believe
But there was one named Lizzie Cooper
Who said he was a lying cheat
She said you call yourself a Rainman
Well, you oughta be ashamed
Starting all these people dreaming
Thinking you can make it rain

Step back, non-believers
Or the rain will never come
Someone keep that fire a-burning
Somebody beat the drum
He said some may think I'm crazy
For making all these claims
But I swear before this day is over
You folks are gonna see some rain

Hey Lizzie
Well, a man's got to have a dream
And if you can't walk on the inside with me
I'll meet you in between
Oh, come with me, Lizzie
And the stars will write your name
And if you still think I'm lying to you
Look yonder
There comes the rain

Step back, non-believers
Or the rain will never come
Someone keep that fire a-burning
Somebody beat the drum
He said some may think I'm crazy
For making all these claims
But I swear before this day is over
You folks are gonna see some rain
Step back, non-believers
Or the rain will never come
Someone keep that fire a-burning
Somebody beat the drum
He said some may think I'm crazy
For making all these claims
But I swear before this day is over
