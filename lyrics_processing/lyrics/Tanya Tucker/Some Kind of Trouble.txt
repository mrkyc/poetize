To no surprise, it was my landlord
He notified me I was late with the rent
What do you do with your last dollar spent?
You got trouble
Some kind of trouble
I called up my baby for a little advice
'Cause my sugar baby always treats me so nice
I had a funny feelin' he was not alone
When I heard another voice whisper "hang up the phone"
I got trouble
Some kind of trouble
Trouble in my heart, trouble on my mind
There never any trouble for me to find
Some kind of trouble.  (Some kind of trouble.)
I went to my boss
Said, "I need a little time
To work on this poor old broken heart of mine."
He said, "I'd like to help you.  I've been there before
The problem is, girl, you don't work here no more
You got trouble
Some kind of trouble."
Trouble in my heart, trouble on my mind
There's never any trouble for me to find
Some kind of trouble.  (Some kind of trouble.)
I got trouble
See Tanya Tucker LiveGet tickets as low as $70You might also likeI was down around low as a body can be
So I talked to my preacher about prayin' for me
He smiled and he said, "Child, you're not alone
'Cause all God's children got to deal with their own trouble
Some kind of trouble."
Trouble in my heart, trouble on my mind
There's never any trouble for me to find
Some kind of trouble.  (Some kind of trouble.)
Some kind of trouble.  (Some kind of trouble.)
Some kind of trouble.  (Some kind of trouble.)
Trouble in my heart, trouble on my mind
(Some kind of trouble.)
Never any trouble for me to find.  (Some kind of trouble.)
Trouble.  (Some kind of trouble.)
We got trouble.  (Some kind of trouble.)
