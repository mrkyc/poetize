One, two, three, four
Aw, I got somethin' to say

Well, it's a long walk down the hallway
But it's a short drive to the bank
Ain't it a bitch learnin' the hard way?
It might be easier than you think
Now, you can keep my tears and my good years
And your Sears and Roebuck ring
And I'll take this show on down the road
I don't owe you anything

Well, I made your bed and I made your lunch
And for the last time, your clothes are out to dry
I know you like my own reflection
I see her in your eyes
Darling, I ain't growin' old with you
I don't need your front porch swing
I raised up all your babies
I don't owe you anything

Now despite your sin, you're gonna start again
A retired family man
With a younger wife than our own son
And a cat that you can't stand
You're gonna call me up in Vegas
'Cause you're lookin' for a fight
And I'll be over you with better things to do
On a perfectly good Saturday night

Well, I made your bed and I made your lunch
And for the last time, your clothes are out to dry
I know you like my own reflection
I see her in your eyes
Darling, I ain't growin' old with you
I don't need your front porch swing
Well, I raised up all your babies
I don't owe you anything
Hey, I made your bed and I made your lunch
And for the last time, your clothes are out to dry
I know you like my own reflection
I see her in your eyes
Darling, I ain't growin' old with you
I don't need your front porch swing
Well, I raised up all your babies
I don't owe you anything

Hell, I raised up all your babies
And I don't owe you a god dang thing
