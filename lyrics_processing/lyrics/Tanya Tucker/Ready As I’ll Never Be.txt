I felt you callin'
I saw you start
From the old town movies to the bars on the boulevard
The bells were ringin'
For a gypsy soul
Straight to the smart-mouthed little girl from Seminole
All you outlaws
And the Opry queens
They wrapped those golden arms around the baby of the family
To stand beside you then
Was more than enough
I always was and always will be lookin' up

So gather 'round now, it's time to sing
It's bittersweet, but it's a hell of a silver lining
I tell the same ol' stories, y'all get your wings
And I get better every time I kiss a weathered cheek
And watchin' doves fly sooner than me
I guess I'm ready, ready as I'll never be

The snow don't fall on Willcox
And the whippoorwill don't lie
Are the two things you can count on
And if you blink, you're gonna miss it twice
Even if I saw it comin'
Even if I wanted to
You're just goin' to the one place left
That I can't follow you

So gather 'round now, it's time to sing
It's bittersweet, but it's a hell of a silver lining
I tell the same ol' stories, y'all get your wings
And I get better every time, but I don't know

Ain't no debts to repay
Even if you're light years away
May the circle be unbroken
Let it breathe through you
One sweet day (Day)
Whoa, happy days

Gather 'round now, it's time to sing
It's bittersweet, but it's a hell of a silver lining
I tell the same ol' stories, y'all get your wings
And I get better every time I kiss a weathered cheek
And watchin' doves fly sooner than me
I guess I'm ready, ready as I'll never be
