Seminole wind
Let me feel your breath again
Take me back to the place your love did find me
Black ribbon, lead me home
Wherever I may roam
And may the bridges that I cross not burn behind me

I've seen the Sunset Strip
And the Hollywood Hills
Where the desert fades into the L.A. sky
Where the palm trees are a-reachin'
And the holy devil's preachin'
To people blinded by the stars behind their eyes

To be roamin' like a gypsy
And livin' on the edge
Sometimes your loneliness, it comes with throttle
And happiness, it seems
Just like our golden dreams
Won't be found at the bottom of a bottle

Seminole wind
Let me feel your breath again
Take me back to the place your love did find me
Black ribbon, lead me home
Wherever I may roam
And may the bridges that I cross not burn behind me

As I followed this great highway
From the west coast to the east
I cursed the worn-out stars as they were falling
I got tossed and turned around
But I always stood my ground
I still hear the winds of Seminole a-calling

Seminole wind
Let me feel your breath again
Take me back to the place your love did find me
Black ribbon, lead me home
Wherever I may roam
And may the bridges that I cross not burn behind me

Seminole wind
Let me feel your breath again
Take me back to the place your love did find me
Black ribbon, lead me home
Wherever I may roam
And may the bridges that I cross not burn behind me

Seminole wind
Let me feel your breath again
Take me back to the place your love did find me
Black ribbon, lead me home
Wherever I may roam
And may the bridges that I cross not burn behind me
Seminole wind
Let me feel your breath again
Take me back to the place your love did find me
Black ribbon, lead me home
Wherever I may roam
And may the bridges that I cross not burn behind me
Seminole wind
Let me feel your breath
