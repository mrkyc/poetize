She'd left me long ago if she knew the things I did back then
No, they ain't said a word, stood silent through it all
I'd be a lonely man if these old walls could talk
This old house of ours, it's made of stone, but it's built on sand
And these four walls, they are my best friends
Been keepin' all my past locked deep inside
No one will ever know all those things I did so long ago
I've been runnin', tryin' to hide from yesterday
But there's just no need, I know my secret's safe
If these old walls could talk, I'd be a sad man
She'd left me long ago if she knew the things I did back then
No, they ain't said a word, stood silent through it all
I'd be a lonely man if these old walls could talk
They stood every storm those long, cold winter nights
They kept us warm holdin' back the rain
Not even the winds of change could blow 'em down
Yeah, we're on solid ground
If these old walls could talk, I'd be a sad man
She'd left me long ago if she knew the things I did back then
No, they ain't said a word, stood silent through it all
I'd be a lonely man if these old walls could talk
You might also likeThey've stood the test of time, never let me down
I put it all behind me, they remind me I'm on shaky ground
Won't let me forget
If these old walls could talk, I'd be a sad man
She'd left me long ago if she knew the things I did back then
No, they ain't said a word, stood silent through it all
I'd be a lonely man if these old walls could talk
Yeah, I'd be a lonely man
If these old walls could talk, I'd be a sad man
