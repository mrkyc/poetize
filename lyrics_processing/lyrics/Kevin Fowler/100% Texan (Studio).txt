On a hot summer night
Love to hear those hound dogs a-barkin
Howlin at the full moon light
Love to see those fireflies a buzzin
Lighting up the southern sky
Yeah I'm a hell bent 100% Texan til I die
Well I've crossed that old state line
More than a time or two
And if you see me leavin
You best be believing
I'll be back before the week is through
If I stay gone too long no tellin what I'll do
I might a-highjack a plane
I might jump a freight train
To get back home it's true
Well I love the sound of a rain on a tin roof
On a hot summer night
Love to hear those hound dogs a-barkin
Howlin at the full moon light
Love to see those fireflies a buzzin
Lighting up the southern sky
Yeah I'm a hell bent 100% Texan til I die

Ain't never met an Okie that I didn't like
I dont mind New York city
Those yankees talk funny but they're alright
I don't mind going to wessiana
Their red hot cajun cooking suits me fine
If I had my way
I'd be home today
On my front porch drinking moonshine
Well I love the sound of a rain on a tin roof
On a hot summer night
Love to hear those hound dogs a-barkin
Howlin at the full moon light
Love to see those fireflies a buzzin
Lighting up the southern sky
Yeah I'm a hell bent 100% Texan til I die
Well I love the sound of a rain on a tin roof
On a hot summer night
Love to hear those hound dogs a-barkin
Howlin at the full moon light
Love to see those fireflies a buzzin
Lighting up the southern sky
Yeah I'm a hell bent 100% Texan til I die
Well I love the sound of a rain on a tin roof
On a hot summer night

Lighting up the southern sky
Yeah I'm a hell bent 100% Texan til I die
