"Yeah, pretty good song or what"
"Well at least the girls were really hot"
He got some country and some Kid Rock making those speakers pop
For all those country kids rocking in bikini tops
He's got a couple pork chops on the grill
Got a case of twist tops on the chill
Sipping those suds rocking that buzz
The label says it sounds like a hit sure it does
Its a sellout, sellout song so catchy even haters sing along
Put your hands up in the air
The lyrics suck hey no one really cares
He's got his jacked up truck looking good got a couple fine girls dancing up on the hood
When you that hey make you say hey whats so wrong with a sellout song
Hell yeah he's lucky daddy sold out why should he hold out
Yeah he makes a hundred grand every time he rolls out
He could sing a song from the heart
But he'd rather be on the chart
He used to be broke he'd nearly lost hope
But that all changed on the day that he wrote
Its a sellout, sellout song so catchy even haters sing along
Put your hands up in the air
The lyrics suck hey no one really cares
He's got his jacked up truck looking good got a couple fine girls dancing up on the hood
When you that hey make you say hey whats so wrong with a sellout song
You might also likeYo listen up all the shorties in the woods bounce with me now
You know you ain't no good making out with me now
Don't think too much about what the words mean
Just focus on the backside of my skinny jeans and
Bounce with me
Bou-bounce with me
Bounce with me
Bou-bounce with me
When you hear that beat with the banjo
Kevin these days that's how you know
Its a sellout, sellout song so catchy even haters sing along
Put your hands up in the air
The lyrics suck hey no one really cares
He's got his jacked up truck looking good got a couple fine girls dancing up on the hood
When you that hey make you say hey whats so wrong with a sellout song
Come on come on come on its just a sellout song
"Yo Z Doub what you think about that song"
"Yeah that's country music these days"
