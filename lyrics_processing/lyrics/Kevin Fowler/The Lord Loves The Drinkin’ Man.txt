Sends honkey tonk angels to the promise land
I hear that he can turn water to wine
Any man that can do that is a good friend of mine
I've been baptized in beer, I'm here to testify
I was speaking in tongues when I came home last night
Some folks say I'm livin' in sin, but I know
The Lord loves the drinkin' man
The Preacher man he told me boy you ain't no good
The devils gonna getcha, better start actin' like you should
All the cold beers and bright lights, stayin' out all night
The good book it tells me boy your soul's gonna burn
My mamma said son you're headin' down the wrong road
They don't let honkey tonkers up in heaven I've been told
Don't you worry mamma I'll see you up in heaven
I've been thinking 'bout it and I've come to this conclusion now
The Lord loves the drinkin' man
The Preacher man he told me boy you ain't no good
The devils gonna getcha, better start actin' like you should
All the cold beers and bright lights, stayin' out all night
The good book it tells me boy your soul's gonna burn
My mamma said son you're headin' down the wrong road
They don't let honkey tonkers up in heaven I've been told
Don't you worry mamma I'll see you up in heaven

Lighting's gonna strike you down before too long
That man upstairs he don't like what you do
When you reach those pearly gates you ain't getting through
Well I've been thinkin', I've got a brand new plan
I'm gonna start a little church down at the Stumble Inn
Yea that's right I'm gonna start my own religion
We'll be drinkin' and dancin' at the church of Hank Williams yea
The Lord loves the drinkin' man
The Preacher man he told me boy you ain't no good
The devils gonna getcha, better start actin' like you should
All the cold beers and bright lights, stayin' out all night
The good book it tells me boy your soul's gonna burn
