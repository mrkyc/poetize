And all my life I've had to kick and fight
When the world comes after me
I ain't one to start a fight
But I'll stand up for what's right
This sleepin dog, he'll bite
If you wanna mess with me
Bring it on, hell I ain't scared
I've been beat up, beat down
Walked on, pushed around
But I'm still standin here
Bring it on, see what you got
If you think you want a piece of me
Then give it your best shot
Just bring it on
Yeah bring it on
Mama said it don't make you weak
If you turn the other cheek
But I'll be damned if I'll be whooped on anymore
Like a snake better let me be
Oh no don't tread on me
If you mess with this boy
Well, you just might get the horn
You might also likeBring it on, hell I ain't scared
I've been beat up, beat down
Walked on, pushed around
But I'm still standin here
Bring it on, see what you got
If you think you want a piece of me
Then give it your best shot
Just bring it on
I've been knocked down once or twice
Got right back up again
When this world tries to get me down
I'll punch it right on the chin and say
Bring it on, hell I ain't scared
I've been beat up, beat down
Walked on, pushed around
But I'm still standin here
Bring it on, see what you got
If you think you want a piece of me
Then give it your best shot
Just bring it on
Bring it on, hell I ain't scared
I've been beat up, beat down
Walked on, pushed around
But I'm still standin here
Bring it on, see what you got
If you think you want a piece of me
Then give it your best shot
Just bring it on
