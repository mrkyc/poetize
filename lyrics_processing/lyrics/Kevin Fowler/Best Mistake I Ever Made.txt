Glad that i was free
Had my whole life ahead
There was nothing stoppin me
Headed out to Vegas, me and all my friends
Just a bunch of clowns runnin round in a town of sin
Ten shots later and one double dare
Met a girl said I do in some chapel out there
That was the best mistake I ever made
The Lord works in mysterious ways
Chose a wrong path all my life
But for once I did something right
And just one look in her and I see
Someone smiling down on me
And I'm not too proud to say
That was the best mistake I ever made
Trying to start a family was the last thing we had planned
Till I came home from work
She had her head in her hands
I could see the worry
Through the teardrops in her eyes
She said, "How we gonna do this when we're barely gettin by?"
We wern't prepared for all those changes in our world
That all changed when the doctor said it's a girl

And just one look in her and I see
Someone smiling down on me
And I'm not too proud to say
That was the best mistake I ever made
There's consequences to the decisions in our lives
Just cause we didn't mean to do it that don't mean that it ain't right
That was the best mistake I ever made
The Lord works in mysterious ways
Chose a wrong path all my life
But for once I did something right
And just one look in her and I see
