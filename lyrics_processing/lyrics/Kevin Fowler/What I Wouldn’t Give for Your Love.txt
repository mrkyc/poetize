I'd give anything, your the only one in this whole wide world
Who makes me feel this way. You came to me just like you were
An angel from above. Hunny, what I wouldn't give for your love
Well I wouldn't give my rusty old pick up truck, I wouldn't quit drinking beer, wouldn't stop dippin' snuff, wouldn't give up my ratty old boots and jean, wouldn't stop reading playboy magazine. Wouldn't give up my dog or my old shot gun, not my fishin pole, hell that's my favorite one. Not my new bass boat, not my baseball glove. That's what I wouldn't give for your love
Now girl once I told ya, I'd give anything to hold ya, what was I think? I was outa my mind, what was I trying to prove telling you those things? Well now hunny, I'd give up some of my money. But there's a few things I ain't' letting go, girl you gotta know this boy ain't' ever gonna change
Well I wouldn't give my rusty old pick up truck, I wouldn't quit drinking beer, wouldn't stop dippin' snuff, wouldn't give up my ratty old boots and jean, wouldn't stop reading playboy magazine. Wouldn't give up my dog or my old shot gun, not my fishin pole, hell that's my favorite one. Not my new bass boat, not my baseball glove. That's what I wouldn't give for your love

Aw no, not my new bass boat, not my baseball glove, not my 5pound bass or my 10point buck. Not my poker night or leavin' the toliet seat up. That's what I wouldn't give for you love
