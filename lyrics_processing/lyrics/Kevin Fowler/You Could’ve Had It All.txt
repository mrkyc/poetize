I'd be a sad man
She'd left me long ago
If she knew the things I did back then
No, they ain't said a word
Stood silent through it all
I'd be a lonely man
If these old walls could talk
This old house of ours
It's made of stone
But it's built on sand
And these four walls
They are my best friends
Been keepin' all my past
Locked deep inside
No one will ever know
All those things I did so long ago
I've been runnin', tryin' to hide from yesterday
But there's just no need
I know my secret's safe
If these old walls could talk
I'd be a sad man
She'd left me long ago
If she knew the things I did back then
No, they ain't said a word
Stood silent through it all
I'd be a lonely man
If these old walls could talk
You might also likeThey stood every storm
Those long, cold winter nights
They kept us warm
Holdin' back the rain
Not even the winds of change
Could ever blow 'em down
Yeah, we're on solid ground
If these old walls could talk
Id be a sad man
She'd left me long ago
If she knew the things I did back then
And, no, they ain't said a word
Stood silent through it all
I'd be a lonely man
If these old walls could talk
They've stood the test of time
Never let me down
I've put it all behind me
They remind me
I'm on shaky ground
They won't let me forget
If these old walls could talk
Id be a sad man
She'd left me long ago
If she knew the things I did back then
No, they ain't said a word
Stood silent through it all
I'd be a lonely man
If these old walls could talk
Yeah, I'd be a lonely man
If these old walls could talk
I'd be a sad man
