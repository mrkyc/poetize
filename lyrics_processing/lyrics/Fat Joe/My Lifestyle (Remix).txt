Double R baby, D Block
Joe Crack this is history
Who got the most cars, most guns, most bitches
And I don't gotta pull the trigga I just blow kisses
Niggas love Jada that hate rap
Upstate tryin to get they weight back
Bout to go to k-sack
Cause I made niggas believers
My voice my flow that helped your faggot ass get in the league
And I ain't gotta suck dick to sell records
Get all outta character and scream and yell reckless
Listen to me; I'm the cat that'll sit in a tree
And shoot the dog in the head while he shittin and pee
And I'm just so cool; I prally could snatch Chilli
From Usher in a club in Atlanta wit no jewels
You always was puss you never was hard
You know who it is Ruff Ryders and Terror the Squad
And make sure you remember this
My lifestyle remix; 'Kiss, Joe Cracks and Remi-nisce

Y'all wanna live my lifestyle
Never seen a brick never seen a crack house
Wanna war with the Don have your macs out
Bring it on and I'mma show you gangsta
You might also like
Hoddie down wit the mac
Boggie down where it's at
Fuck around hear the sounds of these gats
Wanna clown? we react (come on) fuck dat
Don't you know what you do when you fool wit Joey Crack
I'm still the realest y'all just pretend that you
Claim to do shit that we don't remember
Always thinkin that you running the streets
Now I'mma leave you leakin under a sheet(what)
Fuckin with Joe Crack is costly
No gat can off me
They learned that when I sold lacks at 4th street
A few dudes crippleanother 2 vegi
Its more than obvious this terrorsquad crew deadly
What could we do to stop it?
Everything new he cop it
Convertable blue 6 before you knew they drop it
And even if they didn't wellyou would just assume he choped it
My lifestyle the shit man it's truly poppin
 - repeat 2X

Yea yea yea
I catch you backstage you already know whats gon happen
Ain't gon be no applause just a whole lotta clappin
You can't live my lifestyle lemme catch your ass rappin
First bitch to spit a verse first bitch that I'm slappin
Tell me how these clowns gon laugh at me
When I'm flyin pass they ass pushin a Porsche to it's capacity
You see me where ever Joey Crack be
Pretty have niggas sick like oh shit that's Remy ?
Yup Straight gangsta (what) straight music
All that hype about your album and it ain't even do shit
You might have a gun but you sure don't use it
And if given the opportunity you prolly wouldn't even shoot it
I'm the bitch in this rap shit so fuck all you wack chicks
I'm directin this movie and you're just an actress
They wanna what?
