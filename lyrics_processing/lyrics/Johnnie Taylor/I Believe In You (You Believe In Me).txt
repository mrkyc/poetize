I feel sorry, yeah, I feel sorry
I feel sorry, yeah, oh, I feel sorry
I feel sorry for any man out there
When he can't look around and say: "This is my woman
And, my woman alone."
I feel sorry, yeah, for any woman out there
Who can't say: "I got somebody I can call my very own"
I feel sorry, I feel sorry, I feel sorry, I feel sorry

One thing I can say about the people of the world, today
They see you with a good thing, they wanna take it away

But, I believe in you
You believe in me, too, yeah

Even your best friend can come around
Making sly remarks, trying to put you down

I believe in you
You believe in me, too
Listen honey
You might also like
People are talkin', trying to pull us apart
Stickin' pins and needles in both of our hearts
Our love is together, don't care about no stormy weather

I believe in you
(I believe in you. Do you, do you)
You believe in me, too
(Do you believe in me, too?)
Look, honey

I heard your mother say loving me didn't make no sense
But, when she put me down, you stood up in my defense

I believe in you
(I believe in you. Do you, do you)
Anytime you go against your own mother, that makes me know: You believe in me, too (Do you believe in me, too?)
Here's another thing

We had our hard time, and almost didn't make it
Always worked it out and never tried to fake it
I believe in you
(I believe in you. Do you, do you)
You believe in me, too
(Do you believe in me, too?)
Here's another thing about it

People talkin', trying to pull us apart, no
Always stickin' pins and needles in both of our hearts
But, our love is together, don't care about no stormy weather

I believe in you
(I believe in you. Do you, do you)
You believe in me, too, yeah
(Do you believe in me, too?)

I believe
That's why everytime we get a chance, I tell ya, honey
How much I love you, love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you
And, most of all, how much I trust you
The reason why I trust you, baby, is become of one thing:
I can lean on you, yeah
And you can lean on me, too
One more thing I wanna say
I believe
(I believe in you. Do you, do you)
Honey, please, let me believe in you
(Do you believe in me, too?)
I know a lot of folk out there wish they had somebody they could believe in
(I believe in you. Do you, do you)
Oh, I believe, I believe
(Do you believe in me, too?)
In you. You believe in me, too
(I believe in you. Do you, do you)
Anytime you stand against your own mother
(Do you believe in me, too?)
That makes me know that I
(I believe in you, Do you, do you)
Can believe in you, I believe in you
(Do you believe in me, too?)
