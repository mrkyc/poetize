Before I turn the page and leave the past behind
I would like to state my case and reveal some thoughts of mine
May I say that losing you is gonna be a heavy blow
But in your eyes, they tell me, and they're lettin' me know
The look that said you love me is gone

I can read between the lines
When I call, you're never in
I can read between the lines
As I watch the end begin

Seems like the same old story
'Cause life's an open book
One can say so many words with just a simple look
I can see that distant smile upon your face
Whenever he walks out the door
You wanna leave the place
Now, if you just can't seem to tell me what's wrong
I want you to know

I can read between the lines
I'm prepared to walk away
I can read, I can read it, between the lines
Before you plan a chance to say: "It's over"
You might also like
Don't send me cards or letters or notes of sympathy
For I grew stronger when I posessed all the love that you gave to me
Now the time has come, and I don't have to run you down
'Cause I've got myself together, headed for the final countdown
I can read it, 'cause my heart tells me
I can read it, 'cause your arms are tellin' me
I can see the signs

I can read between the lines, oh don't you know
I can see between the lines, listen honey

Don't send me no cards or letters or notes of sympathy
I grew strong when I posessed all the love that you gave to me
But you can't seem to tell me what is wrong

I can read, I can read between the lines
So, it's plain for me to see
I can read between the lines
And I know you're leaving me

I can read, I can read it
I can see the signs
I can read
Before you turn and walk away
I can read, oh yeah, between the lines
And, I know what you're gonna say
I can read, oh I can see the signs
