JOHNNIE: I've been born again, man
I've been born again
I'm a brand new man.  (I'm a brand new)
Oh, I've been born again
Saturday night in the city
Parties on every block
It's a temptation for a man who loves to party
But my party days had to stop
So fellas, you can keep your street life
Changin' women like you change your clothes
Every woman I need, she's wrapped up in one
And our love just grows and grows
You might also likeA whole lot of women is an ego trip
I'd rather spend my time kissin' my baby's sweet lips
I've been born again.  (There's a change in me.)
I've been born again.  (I said a change, a change.)
I've been born again, can't you see it?  (There's a change in me.)
I've been born again.  (I said a change, a change.)
Oh, I'm not a Casanova
My playin' days are over
I think I'm gonna start me a fire
Got my matchbox in my hand
Burnin' up the pages in my little black book
Start my life all over again
I don't need no women in excess
I can't afford to spread my lovin' around
When my woman needs me by her side
I just don't wanna let her down
Oh, a whole lot of women is an ego trip
I'd rather spend my, spend my time kissin' my baby's sweet lips
I've been born again.  (There's a change in me.)
Now see the change in me.  (I said a change, a change.)
I've been born again.  (There's a change in me.)
I've been born again.  (I said a change, a change.)
Look at that
Oh, I'm not a Casanova
My playin' days are over
I don't need a lot of women, no, no
Just to prove my manhood
I got me one woman, special woman
So I can be the man that I should
Oh, a whole lot of women is an ego trip
I'd rather spend my time kissin' my baby's sweet lips
I've been born again, said I've changed deep.  (There's a change in me.)
I've been born again.  (I said a change, a change.)
I've been born again.  (There's a change in me.)
You know what I'm talkin' about, a yeah is a yeah.  (I said a change, a change.)
I've been born again.  (I said a change, a change.)
The things that I used to do, I don't do no more.  (I said a change, a change.)
Places I used to go, I don't go no more.  (I said a change, a change.)
