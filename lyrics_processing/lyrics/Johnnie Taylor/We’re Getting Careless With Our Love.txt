Wake up, little darling
It's time to go home
If sunrise catch us sleeping
We'll be caught up in the wrong
Last time we were together
You made it home in
Just the nick of time
We got so much love between us
It's getting hard to meet the deadline

We're getting careless with our love
We're getting careless with our love
So careless with our love affair

Wake up, little darling
Because time, it won't stand still
Going home to someone
You don't love no more
I know it's against your will
I hate to see you leave
With tears all over your face
Just like Sherlock Holmes
The whole world is on our case
You might also like
We're getting careless with our love
I can't help but get careless with our love
We're getting careless with our love affair

Some people say that it's wrong
But it's the only love we know
And it keeps on getting strong
Everytime we see each other
Our love gets a little stronger
That's why I don't want you to leave
I wanna hold you a little longer

We're getting careless with our love
I can't help but get careless with our love
We're getting careless with our love affair

Lord, have mercy now
Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord
I think we better find, I think
We better find another meeting place
Before the whole world is gonna know
We might mess around
And make a disgrace
You see, honey
The rumors are spreading
The rumors are spreading all over town
And we don't wanna be like Mrs. Jones
We can't meet at the same place
Every time I see you, baby
I know other folk can see that
Look that we have in our eyes
Yeah, when you see me
You're supposed to walk on by
But I can feel it in my heart
That we're getting careless
Careless, careless, careless
We're getting careless
We're getting careless
Careless, careless, careless
Careless, careless , yeah
We're getting careless
Careless, careless, careless
