Live it like you wanna live it
Give it like you wanna give it
Love it like you wanna love it
Hold it like you wanna hurt it
I'm gonna express myself, mmm, yeah

It make me so mad, every time I turn my back
People are talkin' about Johnnie Taylor
They say I'm doing this and that
But, that don't bother me 'cause
I'm not botherin' you

I'm doin' my own thing, that's all I wanna do
Just one more thing

If I go out and get drunk every night and day
If I don't throw those beer cans in your backyard
What have you got to say?

Let me do my thing, that's all I wanna do
Here's another thing
You might also like
Big, fat Sally with your hot pants on
You say she oughta be whipped for ever leavin' home
Well, leave her alone, y'all
She's just doin' her own thing
What's wrong with big, fat Sally doin' her own thing?
You know what? Here's another thing
Wait a minute

I wanna tell you about a friend of mine
She was 92 years old
One thing I liked about her
She sure had a whole lot of soul
I said: "Girl, folks are talkin' about you
All in your neighborhood
They said all them young men you got
They sure don't mean you no good"
She told me one thing: "If I live to be 99
If young men kill me..."
You know what she told me? She say:
"I sure don't mind dyin'"
And that's when I made up my mind
I made up my mind that same day
I was gon', I was gonna do my own thing
Deal like I wanna deal
Go where I wanna go
Play where I wanna play, you know I wanna get down
Love like I wanna love
'Cause I'm just doin' my own thing (I'm doin' my own thing)
I'm doin' my own thing (I'm doin' my own thing)
Please don't stop me (I'm doin' my own thing)
I'm doin' my own thing, oh, yeah (I'm doin' my own thing)
I just got to do my own thing (I'm doin' my own thing)
I won't take the back roads, no, no (I'm doin' my own thing)
