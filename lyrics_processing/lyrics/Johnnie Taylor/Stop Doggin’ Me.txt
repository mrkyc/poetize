I'm as lonesome as I can be
Oh, oh, oh, yeah
Seems like my baby's tryin' to take advantage of me
I had to tell everybody
Stop it, baby.  (Stop it, baby.)
Stop doggin' me around.  Whoa, oh, please
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, why don't you stop your doggin'
Stop doggin' me around
I can't take no more, baby.  You see
I've been lovin' you, baby, for so doggone long
You even got me thinkin' I could stand up on my own
Everybody can see you're takin' advantage of me
And that's doggin', doggin' me around
(Stop doggin' me around.)
I can't keep my feet on the ground.  (Doggin' me around.)
That spells D-O-G-G-I-N'
That spells doggin' me around
I can't keep my feet on the ground, baby
(Doggin' me around.) Listen to me
I've been waitin', baby, for you to straighten up
It's hard for me to swallow the foolishness from my bitter cup
'Cause day after day, you keep turnin' away
And that's doggin', doggin' me around
(Stop doggin' me around.)
Oh, doggin'.  (Doggin' me around.)

Oh, oh, doggin' me around
You got to stop it, baby
Here's another thing I don't understand
I don't know why I keep hangin' around
Buildin' myself up for one more of your let downs
Lovin' you only when it's plain you don't want me
How could you do it
You get the pleasure out of doin' it.  I tell you
Keep on lookin', baby, and one day you'll see
You'll never find the kind of love out in the streets that you had in me
I keep beggin' for sweetness and you take my kindness for weakness
And that's doggin', oh, oh, doggin' me around
(Stop doggin' me around.)
Why can't I keep my feet on the ground, baby
(Doggin' me around.)  Oh, oh
D-O-G-G-I-N'
Oh, oh, doggin' me around.  (Stop doggin' me around.)
I can't keep my feet on the ground.  (Doggin' me around.)
I'm gonna walk out the door, I won't come back no more
If you keep doggin', doggin' me around
(Stop doggin' me around.) Whoa, oh, please
(Doggin' me around.)
Don't you get tired, (D-O-G-G-I-N')
