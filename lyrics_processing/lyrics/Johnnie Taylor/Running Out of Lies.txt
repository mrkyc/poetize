And low class places Oh I'm so tired, baby
I'm tired of worrying, whenever I come home late
With your lipstick traces Oh yes I am, babe
You can rest assured my woman's no fool
She can tell I been loving you
Stealing your love is getting harder and harder
The excuses I been giving just won't hold water
I'm running out of lies (lies, lies, lies)
Getting hard to think of an alibi
Running out of lies (lies, lies, lies)
Getting hard to think of an alibi
Please say goodbye
I've got too many alibis
Oh yes I do
I'm spreading myself a little too thin
Trying to do the job of too many men
You can rest assured my woman's no fool
She can tell just as good I been loving you
Stealing your love is getting harder and harder
The excuses I been giving just won't hold water
You might also likeI'm running out of lies (lies, lies, lies)
Getting hard to think of an alibi
Running out of lies (lies, lies, lies)
Getting hard to think of an alibi
No my woman ain't no fool, y'all
She can tell just as good that
I been out with somebody else
You know a lot of times
I don't wanna talk about it
I try, I try to get it off of my mind
But then my conscience, you know everybody got a conscience
My conscience get to bothering me
And when I try to go to sleep at night
Seem like to me I can hear my conscience say
(Johnnie) you oughta be ashamed of yourself
You know you got a good woman and you oughta treat her right
I made a deal with my conscience
That if my conscience didn't bother me
I sure wouldn't bother my conscience
But every now and then it comes around to me and tells me
(Johnnie) you know you been wrong, yes you have
A lot of fellas out there been wrong
You oughta go to your baby and tell her honey oh
I'm sorry for taking you through all of these changes
I'm sorry baby. I'm sorry that I did you wrong
I'm sorry I broke your heart baby
And it seem like to me I'm running out of lies
It's getting hard to think of an alibi
