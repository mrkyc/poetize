Whoo..uh.. what a shame
Alright

A lady at the casino
She lost all her money
She said don't feel sorry for me
No, don't feel sorry, honey
But if you wanna do a lady a favor
Here's what I want you to do
Just loan me two dollars
Until the next time I see you

These last two dollars (last two dollars)
I'm not gonna lose (not gonna lose)
These last two dollars (last two dollars)
I'm not gonna lose (not gonna lose)
One going for my bus fare
The other for the jukebox
To hear me some blues
Gonna hear me some blues

She said I wouldn't be over here
If my man had been treating me right
I came here to try to catch him here
Cause he been sneakin around every night
But I got, caught up over here
Yeah, got caught up in this scene
And I put all of my money
In that doggone gambling machine

But These last two dollars (last two dollars)
I'm not gonna lose (not gonna lose)
These last two dollars (last two dollars)
I'm not gonna lose (not gonna lose)
One going for my bus fair
The other for the jukebox
I got to hear me some doggone blues
(last two dollars, not gonna lose) x2
(bus fare, jukebox)
