Yeah some kind of safe haven to hide
And you know it makes me wonder
When the world keeps going under
Give me one more cigarette before I die
I never know what I'm thinkin'
Dumb luck
Down and out always sinkin'
I got nowhere to go when I'm drinkin'
God damn I've got to start livin'
I want to go to a place I dont know
Where I can ease my trouble mind
Forget all the pain I thought I left so far behind
Now I wait to catch the morning sky
And then I wipe the mud from out my eyes
Can you show me something different
Is there anybody listenin'
Cause the same old day to day it's getting dry
I never know what I'm thinkin'
Dumb luck
Down and out always sinkin'
I got nowhere to go when I'm drinkin'
God damn I've got to start livin'
I want to go to a place I dont know
Where I can ease my trouble mind
Forget all the pain I left behind
You might also likeI want to drown in the rain
Let it erase my memory
I want to be somebody else in a place where i've never been before
I never know what I'm thinkin'
Dumb luck
Down and out always sinkin'
I got nowhere to go when I'm drinkin'
God damn I've got to start livin'
I want to go to a place I dont know
Where I can ease my trouble mind
Forget all the pain I left behind
I want to drown in the rain
Let it erase my memory
I want to be somebody else in a place where I've never been before
Dumb luck
Knock me to the bottom
Dumb luck
Drive me to the bottle
Dumb luck
Kick me as I wallow
Dumb luck
Leave me feelin hollow yeah
Dumb luck
