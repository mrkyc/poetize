Then you can't tell me who or what I should be
Just 'cause it's right for you don't mean that it's right for me
Hey, This is my life so I can only be me
Who are you to judge me
You don't see things like I see
I'm not you and you ain't me
God loves me He loves me just for me
Who are you to judge me
You don't see things like I see
I'm not you and you ain't me
God loves you yes God loves you
But He loves me too
Now you don't even know down which road in life you'll go
So you know what's right for me now how could that be
What songs do blue birds sing
What will tomorrow bring
Where did we come from and when we die where do we go?
Who are you to judge me
You don't see things like I see
I'm not you and you ain't me
God loves me He loves me just for me
Who are you to judge me
You don't see things like I see
I'm not you and you ain't me
God loves you yes God loves you
But He loves me too
You might also likeYou see that girl on the streets
She sells her body it's all she knows
And that old man he's so weak
He lost his family and gave up long ago
Don't shun them in disbelief
It could be you, she could be me
Love and understanding is all we need
That's all we need
Who are you to judge me
You don't see things like I see
I'm not you and you ain't me
God loves me He loves me just for me
Who are you to judge me
You don't see things like I see
I'm not you and you ain't me
God loves you yes God loves you
But He loves me too
