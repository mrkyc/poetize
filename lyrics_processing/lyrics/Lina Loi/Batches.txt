It could have been better
Or is that your way you seem unhappy
Is your love life together?
Don't look so hard you're gonna make me
Have to pull your card
You better look the other way
Girl all I have to say
If that n***a got you trippin' like that
Acting how you act
Send that n***a back
Batch, 'cause I'm tired of catching
All your batches flack
Caught up in his mack
Time to send that trick back
Time to send that trick back
You ought to be ashamed
Think about it honey you can do better
Ain't got live that way
Always wondering where he is, whatever
Don't be no fool
You got to do whatever's best for you
Send the little boys out to play
Find a man to love the hurt away
You might also likeIf that n***a got you trippin' like that
Acting how you act
Send that n***a back
Batch, 'cause I'm tired of catching
All your batches flack
Caught up in his mack
Time to send that trick back
Time to send that trick back
He's a hot shot balla' figure
Got your ass wide open
Now you're stressing over that n***a
Skipping meals can't sleep
N***a playing you 'cause you weak
Mad at me 'cause your man is a hoe to the street
Instead of hating on all the ladies
Don't give these little boys babies
Take your soul back throw that
Hoe ass trick to the gutter black
This is your world f**k that squirrel
Trying to get a nut two minute squirrel
Can't get it up
Damn ya'll batches ain't had enough
If that n***a got you trippin' like that
Acting how you act
Send that n***a back
Batch, 'cause I'm tired of catching
All your batches flack
Caught up in his mack
Time to send that trick back
Time to send that trick back
