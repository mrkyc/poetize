The problems I think with most relationships is that..
We take each other for granted
Me and my girlfriends talk about this all the time
There's one in particular she's been in her relationship
For three years and she feels like she's not getting 100%
You know it's give, give, give, and get nothing in return
But I just told her...
It ain't gone get no better until you take control
See girlfriend if you let him, let him he'll try and take your soul
But tell him, HELL NO, it ain't goin down like that
And tell him as a matter of fact things around here are gone change
And if he wants you then he gone have to give you his best
You ain't gone take nothing less, tell him it's a brand new day
So be a man and..
Step up, you gotta let him know that you're fed up
Don't let him hold you down time to get up
I tell you it's the only way, only way so don't you
Let up it's all about you so hold your head up
And if you can't get it right it's time to shake up
Child it's the only way
See what is is is....
He's taking you for granted you let it be that way
Now you must make him listen. listen
To you when you say ,hell no, HELL NO it ain't going down like that
And tell him as a matter of fact things around here are gone change
And if he wants you then he gone have to give you his best
You ain't gone take nothing less tell him it's a brand new day
So be a man and...
