Can't find my other shoe what I'm gone do
We gone hop in the hummer glad 'cause it's summer
Head to the lingerie just got Jay-Z on the radio
We bumpin' them down south playas Dr.Dre,Joe
You know them broads gone be hatin'
We know them n****s gone be trippin'
We know the fakers gone be frontin'
Hatin' trippin' frontin' We be dippin' playa pimpin'
Gotta let 'em know what we came fo'
Straight from the no to the dance flo'
I only came to party so girl don't test me
You need to check your n***a
He's the one who's lookin' at me
Gotta let 'em know what we came fo'
Straight from the no to the dance flo'
I'm only here to party so playa don't sweat me
You need to check your girl
You betta tell her that it ain't me
If that n***a got you trippin' like that
Acting how you act send that n***a back, batch
Bud contact got me faded so
Ain't really trippin' off no silly hoe
The beat is bumpin' DJ you done started somethin'
We roll deep sh*t ain't nothin'
All we came to do is party but we know how they gone play
You might also likeGotta let 'em know what we came fo'
Straight from the no to the dance flo'
I only came to party so girl don't test me
You need to check your n***a
He's the one who's lookin' at me
Gotta let 'em know what we came fo'
Straight from the no to the dance flo'
I'm only here to party so playa don't sweat me
You need to check your girl
You betta tell her that it ain't me
We know broads gone hate so we ain't gone sweat that
N***a's gone hate and I'm willing to bet that
Now let that n***a follow me to the beat
Shot by the B O N I C
It's the L to the I to the N to the A
Hands down that chick at the end of the day
Ain't about nothin' hoes lookin ain't wantin'
Playa's hate your man keep lookin' but I don't want him
Rather kill'em with kindness or the gentleman's thug
We keep hoes on the floor like the gentleman's club
Shake break and boogie man whatever is clever
And before you claim the Bonic better have your shit together
Gotta let 'em know what we came fo'
Straight from the no to the dance flo'
I only came to party so girl don't test me
You need to check your n***a
He's the one who's lookin' at me
Gotta let 'em know what we came fo'
Straight from the no to the dance flo'
I'm only here to party so playa don't sweat me
You need to check your girl
You betta tell her that it ain't me
