Then you can't tell me who or what I should be
Just 'cause it's right for you don't mean that it's right for me
Hey, this is my life, so I can only be me
Who are you to judge me?
You don't see things like I see
'Cause I'm not you and you ain't me
God loves me, He loves me just for me
Who are you to judge me?
You don't see things like I see
'Cause I'm not you and you ain't me
Yes, God loves you but He loves me too
Now you don't even know, down which road in life you'll go
So you know what's best for me, now how could that be?
What songs do bluebirds sing? What will tomorrow bring?
Where did we come from and when we die, where do we go?
Who are you to judge me?
You don't see things like I see
'Cause I'm not you and you ain't me
God loves me, He loves me just for me
Who are you to judge me?
You don't see things like I see
'Cause I'm not you and you ain't me
Yes, God loves you but He loves me too

She sells her body, it's all she knows
And that old man, he's so weak
He lost his family and gave up long ago
Don't shun them in disbelief
He could be you, she could be me
Love and understanding is all we need
That's all we need
Who are you to judge me?
You don't see things like I see
'Cause I'm not you and you ain't me
God loves me, He loves me just for me
Who are you to judge me?
You don't see things like I see
'Cause I'm not you and you ain't me
Yes, God loves you but He loves me too
Who are you to judge me?
You don't see things like I see
'Cause I'm not you and you ain't me
