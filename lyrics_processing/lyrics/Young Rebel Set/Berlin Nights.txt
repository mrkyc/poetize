As they did tonight
As I lie in the arms of another man's wife
I dare not stop it no I dare not fight
Something so wrong
But when we let it go it felt so right
On that cold Berlin night
Tell me that I'm wrong in thinking that I'm right
For loving you
And sharing out bodies as lovers do
Nobody questioned no nobody cared
For they could not know
This gunshot love of the moment we shared
On this cold Berlin night
Who'd wanna heed the one
Who's carrying the weight of all the world?
There must be colour in your eyes
To find someone who feels that
Desperation clouds his every thought
And turn him round to face the light
Of the Berlin night
The Berlin light never shone so bright
As it does tonight
As I walk by the river in the pale moonlight
And I hid my heart on the upper west side
For you to find
And do with it as you decide
On a cold Berlin night
Who'd wanna heed the one
Who's carrying the weight of all the world?
There must be colour in your eyes
To find someone who feels that
Desperation clouds his every thought
And turn him round to face the light
Of the Berlin night
The Berlin night
The Berlin night
Who'd wanna heed the one
Who's carrying the weight of all the world?
There must be colour in your eyes
To find someone who feels that
Desperation clouds his every thought
And turn him round to face the light
Who'd wanna heed the one
Who's carrying the weight of all the world?
There must be colour in your eyes
To find someone who feels that
Desperation clouds his every thought
And turn him round to face the light
