You got nothing different to say
You contradict yourself so much darling
That I don't listen anyway
Crawl on back to his house
I saw you there anyway
'Cause I've got nothing left for you darling
So you've got no reason to stay
Now she's regrets 'cause she edged her bets both ways
Now she's regrets 'cause she edged her bets both ways
Walk on, if that's all you think of me
If that's all you want it to be
Oh, then you're never going to see
So walk on
Walk on, if that's all you think of me
It's that's all you want it to be
Oh, then you've never going to see
Me and you are never meant to be
I suppose this is my fault
I don't mind taking the blame
As long as turn to me and admit that me and you are both the same
But she's regrets 'cause she edged her bets both ways
Yeah she's regrets 'cause she edged her bets both ways
Walk on, if all you think of me
If that's all you want it to be
Oh, then you're never going to see
So walk on
Walk on, if that's all you think of me
It's that's all you want it to be
Oh, then you've never going to see
Me and you are never meant to be
Now she's got regrets 'cause she edged her bets both ways
Now she's got regrets 'cause she edged her bets both ways
So walk on, if that's all you think of me
If that's all you want it to be
Oh, then you're never going to see
So walk on
Oh walk on, if that's all you think of me
It's that's all you want it to be
Oh, then you've never going to see
