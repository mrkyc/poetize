Gonna sit down here and keep out of sight
Leave her struggling on her own
'Cos I'm not that strong like her you see
I'm not the man that I know I should be
I show my feathers and I run
I better pull it together, better step up soon
'Cos I've gotta get ready for the baby boom
And tie my colours to the mast
So I better put down the drink
Take a minute to think
About the real world and what I should do
Would I run straight home
Or keep on drinking alone
And just forget that I ever knew?
If I am to change for you
It's gonna be a bitter pill to swallow
For you, for you
And if I am to change my view
With a different road and goal to follow
It's for you. For you
Oh my boy you don't need to know
That daddy was a drunk 'cos he couldn't let go
Of his youth and reputation
Just running round town like an unemployed clown
Drinking to forget that his chips are down
Never realising what he had

For, if I am to change for you
It's gonna be a bitter pill to swallow
For you, for you
And if I am to change my view
With a different road and goal to follow
It's for you. For you
You come around like it was some big sacrifice
Who ever told you that I needed your advice?
Oh you should crawl back from where you once came
Whoever told you...?
That if I am to change for you
It's gonna be a bitter pill to swallow
For you. For you
And if I am to change my view
With a different road and goal to follow

It's gonna be a bitter pill to swallow
For you. For you
If I am to face this world
It's gonna be a different road to follow
