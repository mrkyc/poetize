I never said I wanted to at all
And all the things I promised you
I never said I'd follow through at all
And all the time I was thinking of ways to change your mind
I'm sorry if I lead you down the line
I never said I wanted you
I never said I needed you at all
And all the things I said I'd do
I never said I'd see them through at all
And that's why I'll be leaving before I change my mind
I'm sorry if I lead you down the line
And I know sometimes that it's hard to take
And I know that you still care
That's why I said why can't we just be friends
Instead of lovers till the end
So I'm gonna go to Stockton town
Find me a girl to fuck around again
Cause I'm gonna do just what I like
And I'm gonna do it every night again
And that's why I'll be leaving before I change my mind
I'm sorry if I lead you down the line
And I know sometimes that it's hard to take
And I know that you still care
That's why I said why can't we just be friends
Instead of lovers till the end
You might also likeI sat up drinking for three lonely nights
I asked myself; when will this end
I washed these thoughts down with a bottle of wine
I said my dear you're just my friend
I never said I'd marry you
I never said I wanted to at all
And all the things I promised you
I never said I'd follow through at all
And that's why I'll be leaving before I change my mind
I'm sorry if I lead you down the line
And I know sometimes that it's hard to take
And I know that you still care
That's why I said why can't we just be friends
