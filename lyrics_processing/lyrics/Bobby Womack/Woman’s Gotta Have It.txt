Fellas, I wonder, would you mind if I talk to you a minute?
You know, sometimes we have our tendencies
Or should I say, we forget
What a woman needs every now and then
That is, if you wanna keep your thing together
Listen to me now

Do the things that keeps a smile on her face
Say the things that make her feel better every day
Man, you got to stay on your Ps and Qs
If you don't, the woman, you can easily lose, oh-oh-oh
I had a love, oh, and I lost her
And no one can help me share the pain that she caused me

A woman's got to have it, I believe
She's got to know that she's needed around
When you kiss her, you got to make her feel it, every time, boy
She wants to know that she's not walking on shaky ground

Oh, yeah
Think it over
Think it over, my brother
You might also like
Don't take for granted the smile on her face
Check a little bit closer, you might find a tear trace
Maybe the girl might never say a mumbling word
But you gotta make sure that her voice is heard
Oh, I had a love, a true love and I lost it
I'm suffering all this pain that that love cost me, oh

A woman's got to have it, you've got to give it to her
She's got to know that she's needed around
When you kiss her, you gotta make her feel it
She wanna know that she's not walking on shaky ground

Yeah, oh

So if you got a love and you wanna keep her
You've got to give her what she wants when she wants it
Where she wants it
And how she wants it
Every doggone time she feels she needs it
What I'm tryna say (What you tryna say, boy?)
A woman's gotta have it, hey, hey, hey
