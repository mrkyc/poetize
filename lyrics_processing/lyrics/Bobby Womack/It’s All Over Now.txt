I used to love her (I used to love her now)
Whoa I used to love her (Oh I used to love her)
Ooh I used to love her (Love her)
But I can't go no farther 'cause it's all over now
Yeah it's all over now
Oh I used to love her (I used to love her)
Oh I love her (I used to love her)
Ooh I used to love her (Love her)
But it's all over now (But it's all over now)

I used to wake up in the morning, get my breakfast in bed
Whenever I got worried she would rub my aching head
Now she's here and there, with every man in town
Still trying to take me for the same old clown

I used to love her (Oh I used to love her)
Oh I thought I loved her (I used to love her)
Ooh I used to love her (Love her)
But I'm givin' on her (It's all over now)
Because it's all over now
Come on see her Bill, get it

Oh I used to peek into your window
I used to listen in at your door, ah ha
Tryin' to see if somebody else was in there
Oh but that don't bother me no more

Because I used to love her (Oh I used to love her)
Oh I used to love her (Used to love her)
I used to love her, oh
But it's all over now


I've got to deal with it
Oh Lord I've got to deal with it right now
Try to make it easier to live with it (Whoa about it)
Oh oh yeah yeah (I used to love her)
Ohhhh baby (I know it's your )
Used to love her (I believe I used to love her)
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah (Whoa lord yeah)
I believe it's all over now
Oh oh oh oh yeah
Oh I used to love her
I believe
