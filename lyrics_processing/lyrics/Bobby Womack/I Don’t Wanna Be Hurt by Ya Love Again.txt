Naw, Naw Naw Naw, Not again!
I can't even by your love
But I'm afraid to let you in
Ya see it's happened once before, darling
I can't let you take my heart again
That's why i keep runnin' runnin' -- runnin' away from you
But your good vibes -- just won't turn me loose
I don't mind trying - trying one more time
But love once took my heart
I can't let it take my mind
But it's so real (with back)-- I know I know I know
I like the way -- the way it makes me feel
Oh, I
I don't wanna be hurt by love again
Let me say it again
I, I
I don't wanna be hurt by love again
Love is something --
That we all need in our lives
Even the hurt, the pain
That comes along with it ---
Sometimes I wonder if it's
Worth the price
You might also likeJust like a fish hooked on a line
Having good life --
It's just a matter of time
I take it -- at even where it is
I like the way -- the way you make me feel
So real, (with singers in background) Lord, help me!
And all I can do, is tell it like it is
Ohhhh --- I (with background)
I don't wanna be hurt by love again
Why don't you sing it one more time --
Oh, I
Naw, Naw
I don't wanna be hurt by love again (with chorus)
Awwwww!!
Keep on runnin' Keep on hidin'
So I on runnin' runnin' -- running away from you
Ohhhh, I -- Ohhhh I
Dont wanna be hurt by your love again (with chorus)
Ohh!! Keep it on, Keep it on
Dont wannn be hurt by your love again (with chorus)
Awwww!! Baby!
