As I gaze around at the pictures hanging on my wall -
I don't know -- I can't help but reminisce --
I think about 'em all -- 'cause we all started together
I'm talkin' about friends of mine
People like Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix
Otis Redding, Marvin Gaye, Jackie Wilson, and Sam Cooke
Just to name a few
(Bobby goes into the song)
Sometimes I'm rolling --
Sometimes I'm standing still
Sometimes I'm just having a ball --
Feeling moody isn't worth it all --
They know I'm dependable --
Make the rounds and take the blows
'cause I'm the only survivor left still standing here
Sometimes I feel like I'm a long ways from home
And the light for me from yesterday is gone
And my armored lead has marched across the hill
And left me behind to fight the dream we live
And my heart can't take it
And my feet don't wanna make it
But I'm the only survivor left still standing here
You might also likeI can see that oh, how standing longside the road
Where papa laid his plan and he let us go
And the grass is high and I gotta chop it down
'cause I'm the only hope for my heirs to be found
And my heart can't make it
And my feet don't wanna make it
But I'm the only survivor left still standing here

(Refrain)
Oh, sometimes I'm rolling --
Sometimes I'm standing still
Sometimes I'm just having a ball --
Feeling moody isn't worth it all --
They know I'm dependable --
Make the rounds and take the blows
'cause I'm the only survivor left still standing here
But look like my heart can't make it
And my feet don't wanna make it
But I'm the only survivor left still standing here
As I gaze around at the pictures
Hanging on the wall
They come to life and my history is in it all
People say he's a living legend in his time
But I'm just a soldier who survived
In the royal line
Look like my heart can't make it
And my feet don't wanna make it
But I'm the only survivor left still standing here
(Refrain)
Sometimes I'm rolling --
Sometimes I'm standing still
Sometimes I'm just having a ball --
Being moody isn't worth it all --
They know I'm dependable --
Make the rounds and I take the blows
'cause I'm the only survivor left still standing here
Looks like my heart can't make it
And my feet don't wanna make it
But I'm the only survivor left still standing here
Bop, Bop, Bop, Bop, Bop, Bop, But my heart can't take it
And my feet don't wanna make it
I'm the only survivor left still standing here
Ohhh, looks like my heart can't make it
And my feet don't wanna make it
