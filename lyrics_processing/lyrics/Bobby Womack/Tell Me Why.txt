Looking back on my yesterday
The feeling that we shared -- left me breathlessly
Oooh, I never thought a cloud of doubt would get in our way
All we said and did -- a crazy melody -- I can't relay, Oooh
When it comes to your lovin' -- My soul gotta have it
It's tearin' us apart but I will surrender
It's breaking my heart -- Won't you love me tender
Before you take away my world forever
(With chorus)
Tell me why, Tell me why? (Why can't we work it out between ourselves -- We can't love with someone else -- let's work it out between ourselves)
Why can't we, baby?
Whoo, If you ever --
Honey, if you just do this for me (Tell me can't we work it out between ourselves -- We can't love with someone else -- let's work it out between ourselves)
Baby, Why, Tell me, Tell me, why?
Can't you see our love is about to die?
I don't understand, baby
(Whooo- Work it out!)
(Music interlude)
(Bobby:)
Some old jealous love -- keeps us fighting all the time, Hmmm
Rumors spread, so quick -- in the dark of the night, Oooooh
You meet me, Hmmm -- meet me on some street, Hmmm
With a friend -- you say is best
But you can't face love alone yet -- Hmmmm
You build me up when I was falling down
Your love ain't never, never let me down
Through the hard times, baby, we got by
But now you've got me asking you that question why
You might also like(With chorus)
Tell me why? (Why can't we work it out onto ourselves -- We can't love with someone else -- let's work it out between ourselves)

No, I don't understand it, I don't understand baby!
You don't have to do it for me -- but do it for the sake of the kids! (Tell me can't we work it out between ourselves -- We can't love with someone else -- let's work it out between ourselves)
