You've had your last laugh.  Tough
You laughed a whole lot of times as I walked out the door and said
"Don't worry, he be back.  See, he's in love and he's hung up."
You see, God, if he don't see that you want something that's good for you and he takes it and give it to somebody else that he feels he can use it
That's why today I can say that
Oh, I'm through (I'm through, I'm through,)
Trying to prove my love to you
I'm through, oh, girl, I'm through
(I'm through, I'm through.)
Sometimes I gave up the right when I know he was wrong
(I'm through, I'm through,)
But I believe today I can stand up on my own
(I'm through, I'm through, I'm through, I'm through.) Well
But I found someone
And I think she understands what it really means
What it really means to have a real man
Her daily deeds and the things she do and say
She said, "I'm not trying to take that other woman's place
But if I can't help you, it's I swear I won't stand in your way
Tell that woman that you're through
(I try to prove my love.)
Trying to prove your love to her."
She said, "Tell that woman that you're through, boy."
(I'm trying to prove my love.)
You might also likeI'm through, I'm through, I'm through, I'm through
I'm through, I'm through, I'm through, I'm through
I'm through, I'm through, I'm through, I'm through
I'm through staying up all night waiting for you to return
I don't think it's another lesson that I have to wait and try to learn
You'll find out far around the road
See, when you take my heart, I can't let you take my soul
It always happens in so many love affairs
Oh, you're so well loved today
And tomorrow, tomorrow you just don't care
When you're tired and give someone loving the other
And oh, the other one go running in the streets
Running in the streets trying to find it and another
Oh, I'm through
I'm through, I'm through, I'm through, I'm through
I'm through, I'm through, I'm through, I'm through
I'm through trying to prove my love to you
Well, I'm through, baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I don't feel bad about it, no, no
