Lordy, Lord
Hmmm Hmmm
(Bobby speaking)
You know, on my side of the town
When a persou wanted something
You had to put it in will call
And that same thing applies
To anyone that's looking for love
And that's why I'm tellin' you
(Singing)
If you want my love -- baby --
Put something down on it
Put something down on it
I know youre sad and you're lonely
But you could use a little time on it
By puttin something down on it
I can tell by the look in your eye
You've been hurt by love before
But that's the price you have to pay
Sometime's life is hard and rough
But you can't give up
Can't give up, can't give up

And with a touch a love -- how can ya give up

You might give in sometime
But you can't give up --
