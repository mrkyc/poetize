I wanna dedicate this song to all the lovers tonight
And I expect that might be the whole world
Because everybody needs something or someone to love

When it's cold outside, who are you holding?
You know
If y'all don't mind, I'd like to talk about this woman of mine
She's always complaining 'bout me never being at home
But when I'm there, I'm broke
She's telling me 'bout the things that her girlfriend's got
What she ain't got
And she want me to go out and get' em for her, but
But girl, I can't be in two places at one time

If you think you're lonely now, huh
Wait until tonight, girl
I'll be long gone (If you think you're lonely now)
And you'll never find another man that'll treat you right (Wait until tonight, girl)

When I ain't there to rub your back (If you think you're lonely now)
Just remember I made it a known fact (Wait until tonight, girl)
And the skeletons come out of the closet (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
And chase you all around your room (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
And the memories sail 'round like a ghost (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
And dance around in a sad slow tune, ah
You might also like
If you think you're lonely now (If you think you're lonely now)
Oh, wait until tonight (Wait until tonight, girl)
I'll be long gone (If you think you're lonely now)
And you'll never find another man that'll treat you right (Wait until tonight, girl)
If you think you're lonely now (If you think you're lonely now)
Wait, wait until tonight, girl (Wait until tonight, girl)

Girl, ain't it funny how the tables turn? (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
When things aren't going your way (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
But when love walks out, and the pain walks in
And settles for a stay, ooh

Lord, help me (If you think you're lonely now)
I feel like I wanna testify (Wait until tonight, girl)
(If you think you're lonely now)
Girl, wait until tonight (Wait until tonight, girl)
If you think you're lonely, lonely, lonely now (If you think you're lonely now)
Oh, just wait until tonight, girl (Wait until tonight, girl)
(If you think you're lonely now)
(Wait until tonight, girl)

You see, tonight's the night when the needs come out (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
When your needs come out to breathe
And the toils and snares, and there ain't now way you can sleep, oh
If you think you're lonely now (If you think you're lonely now)
I feel like I wanna testify this evening (Wait until tonight, girl)
I'm lonely, 'cause I know I gotta leave you, oh, girl (If you think you're lonely now)
I just can't take no more (Wait until tonight, girl)
Ooh-ooh-ooh (If you think you're lonely now)
Oh, girl, you just wait (Wait until tonight, girl)
(If you think you're lonely now)
If you think you got problems now, baby, you just wait
Wait (Wait until tonight, girl)
(If you think you're lonely now)
Too far gone, I'm packing up now (Wait until tonight, girl)
Ooh, ooh-ooh, babe (If you think you're lonely now)
(Wait until tonight, girl)
You say you're a little lonely (If you think you're lonely now)
But everybody needs somebody to love
(Wait until tonight, girl)

It's good that you know that you got somebody that'll stand by your side (If you think you're lonely now)
That'll build you up when you're falling down (Wait until tonight, girl)
And you had that someone, baby (If you think you're lonely now)
'Cause I've done my time
And it's your turn now (Wait until tonight, girl)
If you think you're lonely now (If you think you're lonely now)
Wait, wait until tonight (Wait until tonight, girl)
I'm tired (If you think you're lonely now)
I'm tired of the same old shuck and jive (You just wait until tonight, girl)
It's been too long
If you think we could start all over again (If you think you're lonely now)
It's been too long (Wait until tonight, girl)
If you think we could start just one more time
