Start your car won't go far brain's on holiday
Think I got a hit do you want a hit? Yeah!
All you need is a little bit! Why?
Open up your mind look at what you find
Touch the sky
Think it's almost time do you see the sign? Yeah!
Tasted like a grape but it was a lime! Yum!
Looking at the rain on a sunny day
Vitamin A! Vitamin A! Vitamin A!
I can see you and me floating in the air
It's allright day or night life without a care
Think I got a hit do you want a hit? Yeah!
First I used a toke Now I wanna flip! Cool!
Open up your mind and look at what you find
Feeling free
Don't anticipate hurry up and wait Now!
In a little while you'll be feeling great! Wow!
There's so much to do there's so much to see!
Follow me! Follow me! Follow me!
Rainbow cotton candy cloud thinking thoughts and speaking loud
Point to me the right direction pass the mirrors and reflection
See yourself as broken glass smash the vision of your pas
Running forward - can't turn back
Trains of thought are now on track now my mind's of purple haze
Screaming out in silent rage hearing things for miles around
Listen closely can you hear?
Can you hear the sound? Can you hear the sound? Can you hear the sound? Can you hear the sound?

All you really need is a little bit why?
Open up your mind look at what you find
Touch the sky
Think it's almost time do you see the sign? Yeah!
