Bring that money up like you bout to start a tryout
When you beat the cases turn into a stoner tryout
We dont stand in like buyin shoes hurt yo feet
Everybody stone weed mean mo meat
Everytime I walk up inside the club I see everybody looking
You know im a stoner I love drugs and I can't never be tookn
And you can't stop my banana but I want to eat your pudding
So come on the coast so my brisk will know ya

How the fuck a nigga think he gone survive when I why say you run wit
My thoughts is a man tryna blow off your chess
I come through yo home like nut in flet
Yo bitch is my dinner she wet like a fish
I took off her three legs...t-rex
