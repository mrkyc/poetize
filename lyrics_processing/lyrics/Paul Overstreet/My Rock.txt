And He made me free and whole (And He made me free and whole)

I can feel Him in my soul (Feel Him in my soul)

One night I repented
And I got down on my bended knees
And I cried "Lord, have mercy
Won't you save my soul from sin"
Now I'm walkin', but not alone
'Cause I'm headed straight for home
My Lord, He is real (My Lord, He is real)
I can feel Him in my soul (I can feel Him in my soul)

One day, He saved my soul (One day, saved my soul)
And He made me free and whole (And He made me free and whole)
