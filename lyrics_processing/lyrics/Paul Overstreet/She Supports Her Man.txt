And at first life was hard for them
Her friends and family told her
She should not have married him
Cause sometimes he'd get out of work
Then he'd work on big ideas
And the part time job she'd have to take
Would barely pay their bills
Sometimes they could both hear
People talk behind their back , saying
Chorus:
She supports her man
Yes she supports her man
And she believes that everyone
Should have a helping hand
And the Bible on the table says
It's al
L part of the plan
She's in love so she supports her man
Well after 15 years or so
Her man wound up on top
And when his big ideas come through
Well , everyone was shocked
To fin he'd never take the credit
For all his success
He was quick to set the record straight
When people asked
He would always turn to his wife
Take her around and say

Yes , she supports her man
Any good I'll never do
Well she believes I can
And the Bible on the table says
It's all part of the plan
I've been blessed 'cause she supports her man
Well last Sunday he turned 92
And she's just 85
But to look at them it's plain to see
Their love is still alive
His eyes don't see as well as hers
His ears hear fewer sounds
But with his feeble hand on her arm
They still walk through town
Now everybody's saying it's wonderful to see
Chorus: How she supports her man
Yes she supports her man
'Cause she believes eternity
Should find them hand in hand
And the Bible on their table says
It's all part o
F the plan
So with the strength God gives her
She supports her man
Yea , the Bible on the table says
It's all part of the plan
So with the strength God gives her
