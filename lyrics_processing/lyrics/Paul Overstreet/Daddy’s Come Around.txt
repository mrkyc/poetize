Daddy's come around to Momma's way of thinking
No more staying out all night a drinking
And everything's better on the home front now
They're meeting in the middle, working it out
He finally figured out he's got something worth keeping
Yeah that Daddy's come around to Momma's way of thinking

Daddy used to go out every night with his friends
And Momma stayed home taking care of the kids
Daddy didn't mind the way it was arranged
To his way of thinking it didn't seem strange
Then one night Momma met him at the door
'Cause the key in his hand didn't work anymore
Momma said more than the locks have changed
There's a new set of rules to this old game

Yeah that Daddy's come around to Momma's way of thinking
No more staying out all night drinking
And everything's better on the home front now
They're meeting in the middle, working it out
He finally figured out he's got something worth keeping
Yeah that Daddy's come around to Momma's way of thinking

Now it's been some time since she laid down the law
But Daddy don't seem to mind at all
He comes straight home when the work day's through
He's even done the dishes a time or two
Late last night when the lights were low
Daddy told Momma I love you so
Early this morning Momma said to him
You just might get to be a Daddy again

Yeah Daddy's come around to Momma's way of thinking
No more staying out all night drinking
And everything's better on the home front now
They're meeting in the middle, working it out
He finally figured out he's got something worth keeping
Yeah that Daddy's come around to Momma's way of thinking
