Well the guys that I work with they work real hard and they like to have a good time
And at the end of the day it's their time to play and they like to go and unwind
Well they make a lot of jokes and they laugh and they poke fun at me 'cause I don't stay long
And they can't understand why a married man is in a hurry to ever go home

Well I just tell 'em that all the fun that I'm ever gonna need
I got waiting at home for me
Yeah she likes to dance and she loves romance and she throws a great party
Naw there's never any dull minutes around here
Something always a-going on
All the fun that a man could want
I got waiting for me at home

Hey I used to be a fool and a sucker for a high time anytime night or day
I had a 'round the clock smile, just call me and I would be a-readily on my way
But to tell you the truth I was lonesome and blue praying for a little light in my life
Then a miracle came and everything changed and I made that little woman my wife

And let me tell ya that all the fun that I'm ever gonna need
I got waiting at home for me
Yeah she likes to dance and she loves romance and she throws a great party
Naw there's never any dull minutes around here
Something always a-going on
All the fun that a man could want
I got waiting for me at home

We got two little kids calling me Daddy
Running all over the house
And when they finally go to sleep their momma and me
Cuddle and we snuggle and we party on the couch

Yeah I got all the fun that a man could want
Waiting at home for me
Yeah she likes to dance and she loves romance and she throws a great party
Naw there's never any dull minutes around here
Something always a-going on
All the fun that a man could want
I got waiting for me at home
I said all the fun that a man could want
I got waiting for me at home

 Right at home
 I got all the fun that a man could want
All the fun that a man could want
I got all the fun that a man could want
