He gave him a beautiful woman to love
A place to live and some land to farm
Two good legs and two good arms
Well the devil came sneakinG around one night
Decided he would do a little evil to Ike
Figured he would hit old Ike where it hurts
So he filled up all of Ike's wells with dirt
And when Ike went out for his morning drink
He got a dipper full of dirt and his heart did sink
But he knew it was the devil so he said with a grin
God blessed me once and he can do it again
He blessed me once and he can do it again
So when the rains don't fall and the crops all fail
And the cows ain't puttin' any milk in the pail
Don't sit around waitin' for a check in the mail
Just pick up the shovel and dig another well
Pick up the shovel and dig another well
Now me and old Ike got a lot in common
The Lord blessed me with a beautiful woman
He gave me a job he gave me a home
He gave me a well to call my own
You might also likeNow when I go out for my morning drink
And get a dipper full of dirt my heart does sink
But I think of old Ike and I have to grin
Cause God blessed me once and he can do it again
He blessed me once and he can do it again
When the rains don't fall and the crops all fail...
Well the good book says Ike finally won
(Pick up the shovel dig another well)
The devil got tired and he left him alone
(Pick up the shovel dig another well)
All I know someday I'm gonna win too
(Pick up the shovel dig another well)
Cause the good book tells me what to do
(Pick up the shovel dig another well)
Pick up the shovel and dig another well
Pick up the shovel and dig another well
