Where I was better off
One wrong turn, then before I knew it
I was lost
Some say I was lead astray
But I'm the one to blame
I'm just glad I found my way
Back to this little road again
I gotta keep walking
Down the straight and narrow
Those winding roads are hard
On your heart and hard up on your shoes
Well you can take if from a veteran of the shadows
The straight and narrow is the road to choose
There's temptation on the left
There's temptation on the right
If you need a little help
Keep your eyes upon the light
Keep on walking
Down the straight and narrow;
Any other road you take
Will lead you toward the blues
If you want to save yourself a world of sorrow
The straight and narrow is the road to choose
You might also likeWell I know you've heard of greener pastures
Just beyond the hill
Once you've turned the corner
You'll find its a package deal
There may be good times now and then
But the truth be known
Just a trick to keep you lff the path that leads you home
Better keep on walking
Down the straight and narrow
Those winding roads are hard
Upon your heart and hard up on your shoes
Well you can take if from a veteran of the shadows
The straight and narrow is the road to choose
There's frustration on the left
And aggravation on the right
And it will worry you to death
So if you value your life
You better keep on walking down
The straight and narrow;
Any other road you take
Will lead you toward the blues
If you want to save yourself
A world of sorrow
The straight and narrow
Is the road to choose
