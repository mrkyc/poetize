My friends, they all laughed at me a lot
They slapped my back and told me how they thought I was insane
They said, "Son, you're too young to wear that ball and chain?"
But love don't feel like a ball and chain to me
When I'm close to you, my heart feels wild and free
If you are my jailer, darling, throw away the key
Love don't feel like a ball and chain to me
Love don't feel like a ball and chain
It don't feel like a ball and chain
Love don't feel like a ball and chain to me
Well, I still see my single friends from time to time
And they ask me how it feels to walk the line
Well, I tell them it feels better then I ever dreamed it would
And I would not trade places with them even if I could
No, love don't feel like a ball and chain to me
When I'm close to you, my heart feels wild and free
If you are my jailer, darling, throw away the key
Love don't feel like a ball and chain to me
Well, if it is a crime for a man to love his wife
Then throw that old book at me, give me ninety-nine to life
And I'll spend every minute, every hour, every day
Holding you close, I don't want to get away

When I'm close to you, my heart feels wild and free
If you are my jailer, darling, throw away the key
Love don't feel like a ball and chain to me
Love don't feel like a ball and chain to me
Love don't feel like a ball and chain to me
Love don't feel like a ball and chain to me
