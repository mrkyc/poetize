For every move you make
And a hum in your head
That's keeping you awake
You're a high school heart
Who's never satisfied
Kissing complicated ways to die
We live in tunnels under pressure
Are we undermined
Keep your name on your shirt
And enemies inside
Moving closer into focus
Can you see the cracks
I know just how bad
You want it back
Hey, look at you now
You're like a flower growing up
From a concrete box
Through the bottom of a plastic cup
Of wishes you had
Keep your head up
Because it's never as bad as
You think, you think
You think too much
You think, you think
You think too much
You might also likeDoes every laugh seem to die
In your gravity
Turns to dust
Do you sing a song
Good song in your sleep
All the anxiousness and worry
In your shoulders tied
I know what you'd do
With that tonight
Hey, look at you now
You're like a flower growing up
From a concrete box
Through the bottom of a plastic cup
Of wishes you had
Keep your head up
Because it's never as bad
As you might think about
This road it winds
It keeps on rolling out
If you'd have paid my shade
Believe you'd feel
Pavement giving out
Everything we hide
Is a little light inside
Hey, look at you now
You're like a flower growing up
From a concrete box
Through the bottom of a plastic cup
Of wishes you had
Keep your head up
Because it's never as bad as you think
Hey, look at you now
You're like a flower growing up
From a concrete box
Through the bottom of a plastic cup
Of wishes you had
Keep your head up
Because it's never as bad
