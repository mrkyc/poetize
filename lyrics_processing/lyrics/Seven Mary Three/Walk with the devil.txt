Frequently down at the open-air bar
The regulars run a dirty jukebox
And scowl at the weekenders swilled in their mock veneer
And I take my tricks, like a miner for coal
I shake their hands until the slippery voice
Waitress lends me a smile and some good advice
She says:
Don't walk with the devil (don't walk with the devil)
If you can't run with him too
Don't walk with the devil
If you can't run with him.
Well, the opulence fades with the bottles and cans
And I eavesdrop in on the localsdemands
Slither down their olives, one by one
Little they heed the saying that goes
If you talk to loud, then you really don't know.the best words of advice I can
Never give them:
Don't walk with the devil (don't walk with the devil)
If you can't run with him too
Don't walk with the devil
If you can't run with him.
The street is tired and the fever is high
Strangers creeps till the sweet delight
Of an unknown comfort in taking what's forbidden
Yeah, it was such a night when a man rolled in
With a gold toothed brow and a silvery grin
I knew for sure salvation was his profession
And he sat next to me and I can already tell
He had a question to ask, he had come to collect on a promissory paid
And I knew that I'd deliver
And I said:
Don't walk with the devil (don't walk with the devil)
If you can't run with him too
Don't walk with the devil
If you can't run with him.
Don't walk with the devil (don't walk with the devil)
If you can't run with him too
Don't walk with the devil
If you can't run with him.
And I swallowed my drink
Rolled the rust in my mouth
And motioned to him he should follow out to the alley in back
I said, step into my office.and he finally looked at me straight in the eye
I could see his jaw drop and shutter inside
Surprised in the wake of his newest epiphany
He said sir you are not who I thought you were
I never believed, but now I'm too sure
I sold you my soul, leave me some words of mercy.and I whispered:
Don't walk with the devil (don't walk with the devil)
If you can't run with him too
Don't walk with the devil
If you can't run with him
Don't walk with the devil (don't walk with the devil)
If you can't run with him too
Don't walk with the devil
