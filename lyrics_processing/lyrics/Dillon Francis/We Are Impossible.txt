Turn it down a little bit
Let's talk about this mess we're making
Before we set off fireworks
To the stars, to the stars
Tried to run away from this
We've questioned every chance we've taken
But something keeps dragging me back
To the start, to the start

Hey, we are impossible
In a messed up way
We are impossible
Hey, we are impossible
In a crazy way
We are impossible
Oh, we can't be separable
So I pushed you away
We can't be separable
Hey, we are impossible
In a messed up way
We are impossible

Waiting in an empty bay
Haunted by our mind racing
I'm picking up pieces you've never
From my heart, from my heart
I'll let it fade away instead
Fading like a sunset
But something keeps dragging me back
To the start, to the start

Hey, we are impossible
In a messed up way
We are impossible
Hey, we are impossible
In a crazy way
We are impossible
Oh, we can't be separable
So I pushed you away
We can't be separable
Hey, we are impossible
In a messed up way
We are impossible

Tell me something, something I need to hear
Cause staring in those eyes a million miles away
I know that something's never gonna change
So put down your bow and arrow now we're close to it
Giving up on giving in
Yet something keeps dragging me back
To the start, to the start

Hey, we are impossible
In a messed up way
We are impossible
Hey, we are impossible
In a crazy way
We are impossible
Oh, we can't be separable
So I pushed you away
We can't be separable
Hey, we are impossible
In a messed up way
We are impossible
