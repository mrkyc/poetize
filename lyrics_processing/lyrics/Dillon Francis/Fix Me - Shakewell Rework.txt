Fix me, I'm a lonely boy
I wanna be your only toy
I get played too much
I break way too much
Fix me, I'm a lonely boy
I wanna be your only toy
I get played too much
I break way too much

Love me, hug me, break me, fix me, all that
She said she would never leave me upset
Now she's gone it's hurting, yeah it's all bad
Think you trippin bout the life we could've had
Feeling like a lonely man
Had the world but now it's out my hands
Had the girl but now she's not my girl
Sippin just to make the time go fast, aye
Past emotions got me stuck on E
Said you'd never, now I'm broke, two piece
One too many times I've been cheated
I ain't got no one left to believe in
Praise you, gave you everything I could
Mixed emotions, misunderstood
Drown in oceans, I think I should

Fix me, I'm a lonely boy
I wanna be your only toy
I get played too much
I break way too much
Fix me, I'm a lonely boy
I wanna be your only toy
I get played too much
I break way too much

Tell me where were you, get to feeling nice
The bigger picture I could feel the vibe
Why you do me wrong
All I did was right
Everything I gave you could've been for life
Know it ain't enough, and you think I lied
I just wish we could put it aside
When you hurt me all the pain I felt
But I still see you in better light
I can still picture us taking flight
Pulling up, shorty by my side
Swear I never wanna make you cry
Guess I failed, well at least I tried
Now I'm better dead, feeling like I died
Ain't no more love, can't coincide
Just, fix me up now cuz girl I'm sick
Cursed at birth, that's just how it is
Fix me, I'm a lonely man
I wanna be your only plan
Heartbreaking made of rust
I'm fading into dust
Fix me, I'm a lonely man
I wanna be your only plan
Heartbreaking made of rust
I'm fading into dust

I'm a little overused
But you make me feel brand new
I'm a little overused
