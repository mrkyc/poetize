There's a war we can't ignore, waging silence on our lives
We will overcome, let the cowards run and hide
We were born to take it back
This is revelational
I am not afraid
Love is coming out to play

They'll chain our hands
And close the door
There's nothing worse
Than wanting more
We come outside
They run and hide
In the morning sun, baby, we were born to run

Na, na, na, na, na, na
This ain't over, we own the night
Na, na, na, na, na, na
Love in the middle of a firefight
Na, na, na, na, na, na
This ain't over, we own the night
Na, na, na, na, na, na
Love in the middle of the firefight
Na, na, na, na, na, na (Whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh)
This ain't over, we own the night
Love in the middle of the firefight
Na, na, na, na, na, na (Whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh)
This ain't over, we own the night
Love in the middle of the firefight

The world stops turning
I'll be searching for dreams we've never known
If the words of saviors fight unwavered
There's no place we won't go

Cause there's a world outside that's undiscovered
They're not gonna dream as big as us
We come outside
They run and hide
In the morning sun, baby, we were born to run

Na, na, na, na, na, na
This ain't over, we own the night
Na, na, na, na, na, na
Love in the middle of a firefight
Na, na, na, na, na, na
This ain't over, we own the night
Love in the middle of the firefight
