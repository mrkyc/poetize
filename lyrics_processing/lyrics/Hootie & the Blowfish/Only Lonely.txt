As I drift away in my little room upstairs
Oh I spend my nights imagining your face, your touch
Then I realise how I don't even know your name
If we could share our time, would I disappoint your fantasies?
But I belive that I could be the one you're needing
'Cause I'm only lonely on the inside
Didn't mean to take away your dreams
I'm only lonely on the inside
When you close your eyes to your deepest thoughts
And I could start to give apologies
For all the stupid things that I will say and I will do
If we should ever cross the same place at the same time
Would your world skip a beat 'cause it was me?
If we could share our life
Would I disappoint your memories?
And I believe that you could be the one I'm needing
And I'm only lonely on the inside
Didn't mean to take away your dreams
Only lonely on the inside
When you close your eyes to your deepest thoughts
If I could give back your hopes, your joys, your treasures
Don't you think that I would change my world
But there's so many things trying to pull us together
That even though we're far apart, I can still watch you walk away
So much I gotta say
Only lonely on the inside, I'm only lonely on the inside
When you close your eyes, what do you see?
I'm only lonely on the inside
Didn't mean to take away your dreams
I'm only lonely on the inside
In your deepest thoughts, what do you see?
Only lonely on the inside
I didn't mean, I didn't mean to steal your dreams away
Only lonely on the inside
When you close your eyes, in your deepest thoughts, do you see me?
Only lonely on the inside
I'm only lonely when you're gone
Only lonely on the inside
I see, I see
Only lonely on the inside
I'm only lonely, I'm only lonely on the inside
