Want to tell you about this girl I love
Oh my, she looks so fine
She's the only one that I been dreaming of
Maybe someday she will be all mine
I want to tell her that I love her so
And thrill with her every touch
I need to tell her she's the only one I really love

I got a woman, want to bawl all day
I got a woman, and she won't be true
I got a woman, stay drunk all the time
I got a woman, and she won't be true

Sunday morning, when we go down to church
See the menfolk just standing in line
They say they come to pray to the Lord
When my little girl looks so fine
In the evening, when the sun is sinking low
Everybody's with the one they love
I walk the town
Keep a-searching all around
Looking for my street corner girl
You might also like
I got a woman, want to bawl all day
I got a woman, and she won't be true, no no
I got a woman, stay drunk all the time
Said I got a little woman, and she won't be true

In the bars, where the men who play guitars
Singing, drinking, and remembering the times
My little lover does a midnight shift
Fooled around all of the time
I guess there's just one thing left for me to do
When I pack my bags and move on my way
Cause I got a worried mind
Sharing what I thought was mine
Going to leave her where the guitars play

I got a woman, stay drunk all the time
Yeah, I got a woman, and she won't be true, oh no
I got a woman, want to bawl all day
Oh, I got a little woman, and she won't be true

(Hey, hey, what can I do?)
I got a woman, stay drunk all the time
(Hey, hey, what can I say)
Said, I got a little woman, and she won't be true
(Hey, hey, what can I do?)
I got a woman, want to bawl all day
(Hey, hey, what can I say)
I got a woman, stay drunk all the time, all the time
(Hey, hey, what can I do?)
Yeah
(Hey, hey, what can I say)
Hey, what can I say?
(Hey, hey, what can I do?)
Said, I got a little woman, and she won't be true, no
(Hey, hey, what can I say)
I got a woman, stay drunk all the time, all the time
(Hey, hey, what can I do?)
Hey, hey, what can I do?
(Hey, hey, what can I say)
I got a woman, want to bawl all day
