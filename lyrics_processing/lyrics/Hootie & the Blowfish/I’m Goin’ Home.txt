Won't you stay here for one more day?
I've been your boy for so long now
There's so much I, I still have to say
Sky rips open, and I held my heart in my hand
Like a soldier on his very last day
Cried myself to sleep that night
And I listened as I heard the angels sing
Sha la la
Sha la la la, sha la la la, I'm going home
Sha la la la, la la la la, I'm going home
Oh, something inside of me makes me scream
How could God take you from a little boy?
He'll be alright, he is by my side
He's my little boy, he's my pride and joy
Sha la la la la
(Sha la la la)
Sha la la la
(La la la la, I'm going home)
Take me home
(Sha la la la)
Sha la la la la la
(La la la la, I'm going home)
Make it ease on down

When the phone rang and it was Jeanette
Said boy we had to let her go
I begged her no, no not yet
You left six of us to fend for ourselves
Guess it's just part of someone's master plan
We'll see you laugh, 'cause you're my best friend
You were the light of the lamb
And I smile when the angels sing
Sha la la la la la la
(Sha la la la, la la la la)
No no no, oh
(I'm going home)
Take me home
(Sha la la la)
Sha la la la la la la
(La la la la, I'm going home)
No, sha la
Hear the angels sing, sha la
(Sha la la la)
Oh, they're singing now
(La la la la)
Sha la la, sha la la
(I'm going home)
Sha la la la la la, go on and sing for me now
(Sha la la la)
Sha la la, sha la la la la
(La la la la, I'm going home)
No, no, no no, mama
No no, mama
No no, no no no no
Why, why, why, why, why?
Sha la la la la
I wish y'all would hear when I scream
Sha la, sha la la la la, oh...
(Sha la la la, la la la la)
See, all I ever wanted was her and me back when
(Sha la la la)
All she wanted was me, believe me
(La la la la)
