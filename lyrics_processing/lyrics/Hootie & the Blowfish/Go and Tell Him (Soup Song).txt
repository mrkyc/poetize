I don't care about your man's reputation
I don't care what you say about him
All I know is you're some kind of woman
And, it won't be tonight
But, girl, you're gonna give in
Go and give him his walking papers
Tell him things that he never knew
Don't you hear what your new man's saying, girl?
Don't you know what you've got to do now?

Go and tell him you can't see him again
Go and tell him you can't see him again

You can't say that you don't think about me late at night, lying in your bed
Stirring the soup
And you start to think about the times that we had
And the times that I said now

Go and tell him you can't see him again
Go and tell him you can't see him again

I don't care about your man's reputation
I don't care what your man's gonna do
You can tell that you're gonna come running, baby
I can tell that you're gonna come soon
You might also like
Go and tell him you can't see him again
Go and tell him, nah, you can't see him again. (You can't see him right now)
Go and tell him you can't see him again

Go and tell him that you are gone
Go and tell him that you are gone
Go and tell him that you are gone
I said, go and tell him that you are gone
Go, you can tell
Go and tell him girl
Let him know you're coming home with me tonight
Oh, oh, oh
(1:40 of silence then starts "Alright")

She's always reminding me that things are gonna be alright
Yeah, she's always beside me, she keeps reminding me that things are gonna be alright

I'm so confused, she's not amused
Cuz I've do it too much thinking
It's not supposed to be this hard
She calls me out, and there's no doubt
That I'm doing too much drinking
I guess it got me through this far
In my life it's crazy she can't still amaze me
Sometimes I think, "Hell, what's the use of going on"

But she's always reminding me that things are gonna be alright
Yeah, she's always beside me she keeps reminding me that everything will be alright

When I heard the news, I just refused
To believe that we were sinking
Still can't believe they went that far
So, I start to shout, but I'm all cried out
Still doing way too much thinking
Can't seem to scream putting away those scars

No, in my life it's crazy she can't still amaze me
Sometimes I think, "Hell, what's the use of going on"

But, she's always reminding me that things are gonna be alright
Yeah, she's always beside me, she keeps reminding me that everything will be alright

Alright
I think I've finally see what she's been telling me
It's all inside my head I guess I knew it all along
And, she's always reminding me that things are gonna be alright
Yeah, she's always beside me, she keeps reminding me that it's all in me
Yeah, she's always reminding me that things are gonna be alright
