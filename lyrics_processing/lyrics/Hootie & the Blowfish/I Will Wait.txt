Aboard his ship he stops to stare
Needs to smell her, touch her hair
Say's "I can't be without her"
Tonight he's going to be without her
"It's late now", she say's
Makes her mind up goes to bed
Another night alone without him
Another night alone in Charleston

When I wake to find the solace of
All that we've become
I can't wait to make the promises
I've been leery of
Take me down
Let me see

I'll be there waiting (for you)
In the morning when times have changed
I'll be there through the lies and all
I'll be standing like a soldier for you
You hold your secrets
Through the days when I need to be alone
(I will wait) I will wait for you
Through the rise and fall
You might also like
She was left behind so they could stay
Got to feel him this she prays
It'd make her feel so much better
I want to feel so much better

When I wake to find the solace of
All that we've become
I can't wait to make the promises
I've been leery of
Take me down
Let me see

I'll be there waiting for you
In the morning when times have changed
I'll be there through the lies and all
I'll be standing like a soldier for you
You hold your secrets
Through the days when I need to be alone
(I will wait) I will wait for you
Through the rise and fall

When I wake to find the solace of
All, all we've become
I can't wait to make the promises
That I've been leery of
Take me down
Let me see

I'll, I'll, I'll be there (waiting for you)
In the morning when times have changed
I'll be there through the lies and all
I'll be standing like a soldier for you
You hold your secrets
Through the days when I need to be alone
I will wait for you
Through the rise and fall

I'll be there
In the morning when times when times have changed
(I will wait) I will wait for you
