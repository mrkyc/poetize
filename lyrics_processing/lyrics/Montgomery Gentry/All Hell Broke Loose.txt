Somewhere on the other side
Of that line
You ain't ever s'posed to cross
Running with my demons chasing
What they said was freedom
Swore I'd never leave 'em
No matter what the cost
I've got a wild side
Forged by the wild fires of hell
Yeah that old devil knew me well
Till I heard you call my name
Saw you reaching through the flames
With one touch you broke these chains
That's been dragging me down
God knows I'm no beginner
When it comes to being a sinner
Never cared about where I went
Or where it was that I was bound
Till the devil in me fell in love
With the angel in you
That's the day all hell broke loose
I can see the devil now
Steaming mad, stomping round
Cussing me up and down
Every time you take my hand
I still feel the earth shake
When I think about the way
You came along and I was saved
Oh now here I stand

As I go down in this water today
Yeah, just like the day
I heard you call my name
Saw you reaching through the flames
With one touch you broke these chains
That's been dragging me down
God knows I'm no beginner
When it comes to being a sinner
Never cared about where I went
Or where it was that I was bound
Till the devil in me fell in love
With the angel in you
That's the day all hell broke loose
God knows I'm no beginner
When it comes to being a sinner
Now I'm a born-againer
Yeah I went from lost to found
When the devil in me fell in love
With the angel in you
