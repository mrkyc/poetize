For a minute
I could hear her hummin' a tune
Through the screen door in the kitchen
She was puttin' the final touches
On a homemade pecan pie
And just like always, I was
Right on time
A little game of guess who
And I got a hug and "How's my baby?", I said
You know me momma, I've been hittin' it hard
And runnin' like crazy
But I don't wanna bore you with that
Same old, nothin's new
I'd rather just pull up this chair and get
Caught up on you
Ain't it funny how it all comes back around?
I remember when I couldn't wait
To get out of her hair and ditch this town
I was 18, time to move on
Now it's any reason to go back home
That's what it's all about
Yeah, just slowin' down
And get my feet back on the ground

Before I knew it
I got my fill on pie and how everbody's doin'
I used to look for every reason in the world
To hit that door, and she said
Do you want another cup of coffee
And I said "Yeah mama I'll have one more"
Ain't it funny how it all comes back around?
I remember when I couldn't wait
To get out of her hair and ditch this town
I was 18, time to move on
Now it's any reason to go back home
That's what it's all about
Yeah, just slowin' down
And get my feet back on the ground
Ain't it funny how it all comes back around?
I remember when I couldn't wait
To get out of her hair and ditch this town
Now I, can't go too many days without
Checkin' in, just touchin' base
And just slowin' down
Back on the ground
I drop by to check on mama
