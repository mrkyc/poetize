I heard it through the grapevine
My new neighbor
Don't like my big red barn
A '47 Ford
Bullet holes in the door
Broke down motor in the front yard, ha ha

I got half a mind to paint a plywood sign
And nail it up on a knotty pine tree
Saying I was here first
This is my piece of dirt
And your rambling don't rattle me

Some people care about
What other people think
Worry 'bout what they say
Let a little gossip
Comin' from a loose lip
Ruin a perfect day
Sayin' blah, blah, blah
Just-a jackin' their jaws
Gotta let it roll off-a my back (roll off-a my back)
I don't give a dern
What other people think
What do ya think about that?

I wear what I want to
Overalls, work boots
Crank my music up loud
Like to sling a little mud
In my four wheel drive
Trek it all into town

Shoot a little eight ball
Down at the pool hall
Drink a beer with my friends (drink a beer with my friends)
Now don't judge me
And I won't judge you
Cause we all get judged in the end

Some people care about
What other people think
Worry about what they say
Let a little gossip
Comin' from a loose lip
Ruin a perfect day
Sayin' blah, blah, blah
Just a jackin' their jaws
Gotta let it roll off-a my back (roll off-a my back)
I don't give a dern
What other people think
What do ya think about that? ha ha ha
Some people care about
What other people think
Worry about what they say
Let a little gossip
Coming from a loose lip
Ruin my perfect day
Sayin' blah, blah, blah
Just-a jackin' their jaws
Gotta let it roll off-a my back (roll off-a my back)
I don't give a dern
What other people think
What do ya think about that?

Say, I don't give a damn
What other people think
What do you think about that?
Tell me what ya think about that
What do you think about that?
