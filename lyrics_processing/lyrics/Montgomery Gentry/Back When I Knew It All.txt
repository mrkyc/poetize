At the ripe old age of nineteen
I bought a short bed pick up chicks machine
Life ran on beer and gasoline
A half a lap ahead of the law
I had a fake I d that got me into "Tuffies"
Love was a word I used to get lucky
Was a big time spender with that plastic money
Back when I knew it all

Back when the world was flat and
Mama and daddy didn't have a clue
That was back
Back when a pitcher of beer and a
Couple shots made me bulletproof
Back when god was a name I used in vain
To get a point across when I got ticked off
Lord I'm learning so much more than
Back when I knew it all

I found out credit cards don't mean you're rich
And beer and gasoline don't mix
Yeah step side trucks can't jump a ditch
And those "big house" rooms sure are small
I've learned that love is a woman that will settle you down
A sunday sermon can turn life around
Man I can't believe all the answers I've found
Since, back when I knew it all

I've done some growing up
And I'm still growing up
So I know I'll never be
As smart as I once was
That was back
