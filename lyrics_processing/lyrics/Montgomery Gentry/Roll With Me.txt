Get to living my life
Making sure im all that I can be
Went to church on sunday
There was a moment that came
I swear it was like the lord spoke right to me
So now Im slowing it down
And im looking around
And im loving this town
And im doing alright
Ain't worried about nothing
Except for the man I wanna be
Im thinking maybe its time
To be living the rhyme
When im singing a song
About nothing but right
And it sure would be nice
If you would roll with me
Saw a kid last winter
Only 20 years old
Being laid to rest
While his mom stood by his side
It sure was hard to watch those tears run down her face
Made me think how we all just have our time

Who knows whats up ahead
I think id rather not know instead
