See I've been, sittin' round thinkin'
What life is, where I'm going, where I've been
What am I missing, what am I chasing
Life's what you make it, might as well face it
Everybody gets down sometimes
It's time we all start living a rhyme
Helping each other, loving our brother
Making this world a better place
Whatcha gonna say when your time comes
You and the Lord going one on one
Too late them I'm telling you friend
Make that change before he calls your name
See old Colt Ford done figured it out
What this life is all about
I brought my boy so y'all can see
Come on MG just roll with me

Wake up in the morning
Get to living my life
Making sure I'm all that I can be
Went to church on Sunday
There was a moment that came
I swear it was like the Lord spoke right to me

So now I'm slowing it down
And I'm looking around
And I'm loving this town
And I'm doing alright
Ain't worried about nothing
Except for the man I wanna be
I'm thinking maybe it's time
To be living the rhyme
When I'm singing a song
About nothing but right
And it sure would be nice
If you would roll with me

Saw a kid last winter
Only 20 years old
Being laid to rest
While his mom stood by his side
It sure was hard to watch those tears run down her face
Made me think how we all just have our time

So now I'm slowing it down
And I'm looking around
And I'm loving this town
And I'm doing alright
Ain't worried about nothing
Except for the man I wanna be
I'm thinking maybe it's time
To be living the rhyme
When I'm singing a song
About nothing but right
And it sure would be nice
If you would roll with me
Man it's funny how time goes by
I sit back and wonder why
But not no more, I done seen a lot
I'm done with wrong, only want to do right
And I live and I laugh and slow it down
Leave my mark on this here town
Pray that one day we can all be free
Until then just roll with me

Who knows what's up ahead
I think I'd rather not know instead

So now I'm slowing it down
And I'm looking around
And I'm loving this town
And I'm doing alright
Ain't worried about nothing
Except for the man I wanna be
I'm thinking maybe it's time
To be living the rhyme
When I'm singing a song
About nothing but right
And it sure would be nice
If you would roll with me
Maybe it's time
To be living the rhyme
When I'm singing a song
About nothing but right
And it sure would be nice
If you would roll with me
If you would roll with me
