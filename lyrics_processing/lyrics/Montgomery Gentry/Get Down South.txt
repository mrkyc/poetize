(Hey, over here)
(Get that fire started, where's that cold drink at)
Way out here there ain't no parking lot
It's a big green field and we just pick a spot
Grab a cooler and a folding chair
Just start walking, it's right down there
Tonight we're gonna get rowdy
Get out the coke and ground me
Stir it up in a dixie paper cup
Cause that's how we Get Down South
When you're living in a real small town
And there ain't nothing else around going on
You wanna party, gotta make your own
Get Down South, if you've never let your redneck out
Or had moonshine in your mouth
You gotta Get Down, Get Down South
Yeah I'm gonna shoot the bow and chew the fat
Catch up with the boys about this and that
Till the bees and the cornbread's gone
And maybe a little later on
I'm gonna find a girl and say howdy
And when the band gets loud we gonna rock the barn out on the farm

When you're living in a real small town
And there ain't nothing else around going on
You wanna party, gotta make your own
Get Down South, if you've never let your redneck out
Or had moonshine in your mouth
You gotta Get Down, Get Down South
If you ever get tired of the city
And that same ole crowd
Just call me up and come with me and I'll show you how
We Get Down South
When you're living in a real small town
And there ain't nothing else around going on
You wanna party, gotta make your own
Get Down South, if you've never let your redneck out
Or had moonshine in your mouth
You gotta Get Down, Get Down South
Come on, Come on
Get Down South
