Where I come from son we work hard
Fly flags real high in our front yard
Say sir and ma'am and we pray before meals
And we never let the government pay our bills
Hard work and hustle American muscle
If you want a bail out than get the hell out
'Cause we ain't scared and we don't ever run
And damn right I'm proud of where I come from

Don't you dare go runnin' down my little town where I grew up
And I won't cuss your city lights
If you ain't ever took a ride around
And cruised right through the heart of my town
Anything you say would be a lie
We may live our lives a little slower
But that don't mean
I wouldn't be proud to show ya

Where I come from
There's an old plow boy out turning up dirt
Where I come from
There's a preacher man in a cowboy shirt
Where I come from
Where a couple of boys fight in the parking lot
No, nobody's gonna call the cops
Where I come from
See Montgomery Gentry LiveGet tickets as low as $69You might also like
See that door right there, man I swear
It ain't never been locked
And I can tell you that it never will
That old man right there in the rocking chair
At the courthouse square I'll tell you now
He could buy your fancy car with hundred dollar bills
Don't let those faded overalls fool ya
He made his millions without one day of schoolin'

Where I come from
There's a pickup truck with the tailgate down
Where I come from
The pine trees are singing a song of the south
Where I come from
That little white church is gonna have a crowd
Yeah, I'm pretty damn proud
Of where I come from

Now, don't need no map, got a cup full of Jack
Got seat laid back, Lac boys on the track
I'll be comin' round the corner big 38's squallin'
Party people with me got the river banks callin'
Gun rack in the back like to shoot my guns
And I burn my trash in the back with a drum
Porch swingin' when it's rainin'
Love to work in the sun work boots my roots
That's where I'm from
Where I come from
There's an old plow boy out turning up dirt
Where I come from
There's a preacher man in a cowboy shirt
Where I come from
Where a couple of boys fight in the parking lot
No, ain't nobody gonna call the cops
Yeah, that river runs across that Oakland rock
Where I come from
