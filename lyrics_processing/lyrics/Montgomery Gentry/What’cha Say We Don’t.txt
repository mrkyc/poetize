Sitting on the edge of a powder keg
Blowing us away
Said everything we had to say
Ain't nothing left but to walk away
Call it a day, hey what'cha say?
There's a place you get in the dark too far
Where the easy love is too damn hard
And you just move on, just move on
All our friends are over us
Screaming fighting for the plug
Everybody does it
What'cha say we don't
Give it up, let it go
Send it on down the road
Start again, someone new
That's the easy thing to do
What'cha say we don't
What'cha say we don't
Call it quits over it
Wrap it all up with a goodbye kiss
Take our numbers off the phone
Do a little wakin' up alone
Get back on our own
What'cha say, say
What'cha say, say
What'cha say we don't

Ain't nobody stopping you
Except me wanting you
To hear you say you want me too
Wrap you up, spin you around
Hold me close, kiss me now
The thought of breaking up
Just brings me down
What'cha say we don't
Give it up, let it go
Send it on down the road
Start again, someone new
That's the easy thing to do
What'cha say we don't
What'cha say we don't
Call it quits over it
Wrap it all up with a goodbye kiss
Take our numbers off the phone
Do a little wakin' up alone
Get back on our own
What'cha say we don't
Give up just yet
Buy into, it's all for the best
Just keep holding on
What'cha say we don't
What'cha say we don't
Oh no, no
What'cha say we don't
Give it up, let it go
Send it on down the road
Start again, someone new
That's the easy thing to do
What'cha say we don't
What'cha say we don't
Call it quits over it
Wrap it all up with a goodbye kiss
Take our numbers off the phone
Do a little wakin' up alone
Get back on our own
What'cha say, say
What'cha say, say
What'cha say we don't
What'cha say we don't
Give it up, let it go
Send it on down the road
What'cha say we don't
Call it quits over it
