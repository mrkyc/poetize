That everybody around here's tryin to beat
He's a six pack up when he walks in
Tells the band crank it up to 10
Then he's up dancin on his seat
Well he's a big mouth, yellin' hey play some free bird
Says give me three steps and nobody gets hurt
Then he takes off his shirt

There's one in every crowd
Brings the party in us out
Good time Charley with a Harley, whiskey bent and hellbound
He's got the next round, but he always drinks for free
There's one in every crowd, and it's usually me
Hey ya'll, hey ya'll, hey ya'll, there's one in every crowd
Got a fliptop box of Marlboros
He'll bum a light and steal your girl
Then laugh at you for gettin' all upset, well everybody here knows his name
Makes everybody else look sane
When he's out, as far as you can get
In his mind he's a rock star, crankin' out that air guitar
Til the bartender says fool, get off my bar

There's one in every crowd
That brings the party in us out
Good time charley with a harley, whiskey bent and hellbound
He's got the next round, but he always drinks for free
There's one in every crowd, and it's usually me
Hey ya'll, hey ya'll, hey ya'll, there's one in every crowd

And women love him when they can
He's a bartender's best friend
It ain't a party till he walks in

There's one in every crowd
That brings the party in us out
Good time charley with a harley, whiskey bent and hellbound
He's got the next round, but he always drinks for free
There's one in every crowd, and it's usually me
Hey ya'll, hey ya'll, hey ya'll, there's one in every crowd
