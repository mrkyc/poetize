Every now an' then, on my home
I stop at a spot where the wild flowers grow
An' I pick a few
'Cause she don't tell me to

I go out with my boys all right
But most of the time I call it a night
Before they do

Sunday mornin', I'm in church
An' my butt an' my back an' necktie hurt
But I'm in the pew

Would have tried to control me and it would be over
Plannin' on my goin' on my own way attitude
All of that stubbornness melts away
When I wake with her head on my shoulder
An' I know I've got to love her
Until my life is through
'Cause she don't tell me to

'Cause she don't tell me to

Well, I got dreams in this heart of mine
But nothin' that I wouldn't lay aside
If she asked me to
'Cause she don't tell me to

An' she don't even know
That she keeps lookin' for the next right thing to do
'Cause she don't tell me to
Yeah, yeah

Any other woman I know would have tried
To control me and it would be over
Plannin' on my goin' on my own way attitude
And all of that stubbornness melts away
When I wake with her head on my shoulder
An' I know I've got to love her
Until my life is through
What else can I do?
What else can I do?
Whoa, I love her
'Cause she don't tell me to
She don't tell me to

Every now an' then, on my home
