Don't you dare go runnin' down my little town where I grew up
And I won't cuss your city lights
If you ain't ever took a ride around and cruised right through the heart of my town
Anything you say would be a lie

We may live our lives a little slower
But that don't mean I wouldn't be proud to show ya

Where I come from
There's an old plow boy out turnin' up dirt
Where I come from
There's a preacher man in a cowboy shirt
Where I come from
Where a couple boys fight in the parkin' lot
No, nobody's gonna call the cops
Where I come from

See that door right there? Man, I swear that it ain't never been locked
And I guarantee that it never will
That old man right there in the rockin' chair at the courthouse square, I'll tell you now
He could buy your fancy car with hundred dollar bills
See Montgomery Gentry LiveGet tickets as low as $69You might also like
Don't let those faded overalls fool ya
He made his millions without one day of schoolin'

Where I come from
There's a pickup truck with the tailgate down
Where I come from
The pine trees are singin' a song of the south
Where I come from
That little white church is gonna have a crowd
And yeah, I'm pretty damn proud
Of where I come from

Where I come from
There's a big ol' moon shinin' down at night
Where I come from
There's a man done wrong, gonna make it right

Where I come from
There's an old plow boy out turnin' up dirt
Where I come from
There's a preacher man in a cowboy shirt
Where I come from
Where a couple boys fight in the parkin' lot
No, ain't nobody gonna call the cops
Yeah, that river runs across that old flint rock
Where I come from
