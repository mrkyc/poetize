He's a jeans an' tee-shirt guy
Doesn't own a suit an' tie
He don't impress my Dad...
He ain't all that bad
He's the kind that's hard to catch
Lives his life out on the edge
Yeah, he's a little bit wild
But he knows how to make me smile
I can live with that;
Spend my whole life with him
If I only ever get one chance
Well, I guess you better count me in
Say I never make ninety-nine
Tell me that the world is flat
Just as long as that man is mine
Hey, I can live with that
A little house, a piece of ground;
A two room flat right down town
Hey, I don;'t care
I'll go anywhere
Indianna to LA
Oklahoma'd be ok
Wherever he might be
Hey, that'll work for me
You might also likeI can live with that;
Spend my whole life with him
If I only ever get one chance
Well, I guess you better count me in
Say I never make ninety-nine
Tell me that the world is flat
Just as long as that man is mine
Hey, I can live with that
He's my destiny, the only love I'll ever need
You know I'll be satisfied, oh, till the day I die
I can live with that;
Spend my whole life with him
If I only ever get one chance
Well, I guess you better count me in
Say I never make ninety-nine
Tell me that the world is flat
Just as long as that man is mine
Hey, I can live with that
(Oh, oh, yeah.)
(She can live with that;)
(Spend her whole life with him.)
Oh I can live with that
(She can spoend her life with him.)
Oh, I can live with that
(She can live with that;)
(Spend her whole life with him.)
