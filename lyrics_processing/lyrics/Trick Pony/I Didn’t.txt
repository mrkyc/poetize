I can see it now as I look back
You like Kenny G, I love Johnny Cash
We'd bark an' hiss like dogs and cats
But the thing that ticked me off the most
Was how he beat his chest, brag an' boast
Each time we had a difference of opinion
Well, he liked the covers pulled down, an' I didn't
He thought I should lose a few pounds, an' I didn't
What fin'lly tore our love apart was a matter of religion...
He thought he was God an' I didn't
Well, it was more than just a lover's spat
In the civil war of the thermer stack
He go on an' on like a maniac
Goin' back an' forth and forth an' back
I can see him now with his cocky smirk
Shoulda known right then that it wouldn't work
Standin' there, pushin' all my buttons
Well, he liked the toilet seat up an' I didn't
He thought I should be a C cup an' I didn't
What fin'lly tore our love apart was a matter of religion...
He thought he was God an' I didn't
You might also likeHe really thought he was the man
Who held my world in his hand
If he ever comes down from that cloud he's sittin' on...
Hallelujah, brothers and sisters, I'll be gone
(Instrumental Break)
What fin'lly tore our love apart was a matter of religion...
Yeah, he thought he was God
He really liked himself a lot;
Yeah, he thought he was God an' I didn't
Uh ha ha, hell, no!
Well, here we are halfway through the Trick Pony record
An' I am standin' here right now with the legendary George Jones
Now George, how do you like the record so far?
Well, I ain't even heard the dang thing yet
