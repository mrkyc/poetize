I woke up this mornin' with a feelin' that was gone for quite some time
Your long gone face had been replaced
With better thoughts now runnin' through my mind
When you left you cut my heart in half
Just took some time but now I'm makin' my way back

I feel more like me (She compromised and justified no matter what the cost)
I've let go of your memory (Inch by inch became a mile until she just got lost)
Now the hands of time have been so kind
And finally set me free (Free, free)
I feel more like me

There was a time when I was strong
Wild and free runnin' with the wind
And now the chains are finally gone
And I know I'll be that way again
You took my soul and tore it clean in two
But ever since I saw that open door and walked right through

I feel more like me (She compromised and justified no matter what the cost)
I've let go of your memory (Inch by inch became a mile until she just got lost)
Now the hands of time have been so kind
And finally set me free (Free, free)
I feel more like me
You might also like
I compromised and justified
No matter what the cost
Inch by inch became a mile until I just got lost
But there's no more cryin'
'Cause I'm flyin' and today's a brand new day
Just look at me go now
And I think it's safe to say that

I feel more like me (She compromised and justified no matter what the cost)
I've let go of your memory (Inch by inch became a mile until she just got lost)
Now the hands of time have been so kind
And finally set me free (Free, free)
