First thing, tell me where the bass is/
I'm back in the game now you better all face it/
Coming with something new, I give the game a face lift/
I'm about to blow, I can almost taste it/
Ahhhh I go hard, Been away for 2 years still I got bars/
Climbing up the ladder, soon to be a star/
I'm a different type of man, I ain't from mars/
If you don't know me well I'm a new addition/
Schooling new rappers, private tuition/
Game needs a tweak, I'm the technician/
Spit so hard, I'll make you choke into submission/
My flows like vodka, It's absolute/
Got girls blowing on a ting like a flute/
If a man wants to beef, I'll just rally the troops/
You wanna know where your girl is, I'll give you a clue/

Verse 2:
I'm a business man, with big business plans/
I don't want no drama, I wanna stack grands/
Move through the drama to the dry land/
No beef no more, yo I'm a grown man/
So I came in the game full throttle to get mine/
Made a couple tracks on route to cloud nine/
No lie, I'm talking up a real ting/
Life's been hard but I'm still gonna make it/
Nah I ain't faking, I'mma star in the making/
People try to pull me down, haters always put me down/
But it ain't enough to stop me going for the golden crown/
Someday I'll make it sky high/
Yeah!
Someday I'll make it sky high/
Yeah!
Smile at your girl as I ride by/
Cause I'm chilling with my boys, feeling fly/
It's my dream, my life, so watch me fly/

Bridge:
When I first came in the game, Yeah they all hated/
Now when they see me they don't know what to make of it/
I don't chase my dreams, they chase me/
I chase the lyrics to the beat, when I hear the beat/
Slow down, its the last round/
I ain't made a banger but still I shut the club down/
I do music so I don't abuse it/
So sit back yeah and watch me do this/
