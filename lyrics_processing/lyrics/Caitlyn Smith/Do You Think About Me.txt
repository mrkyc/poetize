Every time that I smoke cigarettes
The taste of the smoke rolling off my lips
Reminds me of how you begged me to quit
And I still haven't quit
Every time that I order my coffee black
Your memory keeps coming back
In a double tall Breve latte, two pumps classic

I think about you all damn night
I think about you all damn day
I think about you driving around in the same little town
And going on without me baby
I wonder if you're happy now
If you're ever gonna be
I think about you all the time, all the time, all the time
Do you think about me? Do you think about me?

I've been living my life on the frustrated side
Cause I can't hear your name without wanting to cry
But, can we just go back in time when you were holding me?
I've been doing my best just to shake it off
But you keep weaving in and out of my thoughts
You should go, so just get lost and leave me be
You might also like
Cause I think about you all damn night
I think about you all damn day
I think about you driving around in the same little town
And going on without me baby
I wonder if you're happy now
If you're ever gonna be
I think about you all the time, all the time, all the time
Do you think about me? Do you think about me?

I think about you all damn night
All damn day
Driving around in the same little town
Going on without me baby
I wonder if you're happy now
If you're ever gonna be
I think about you all the time, all the time, all the time
Do you think about me? Do you think about me?
