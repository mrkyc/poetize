Take off all of your skin
I'm brave when you are free
Shake off all of your sins
Then give them to me
Close up, let me back in
I wanna be yours, wanna be your hero
And my heart beats

Like the empires of the world unite
We are alive
And the stars make love to the universe
You're my wildfire every single night
We are alive
And the stars make love to the universe
And you touch me
And I'm like, and I'm like, and I'm like woo, woo
And I'm like woo, woo
And I'm like woo, woo
And I'm like woo

I will follow you down wherever you go
I am, baby, I'm bound to you and do you know?
Closer, pull me in tight
I wanna be yours, wanna be your hero
And my heart beats
