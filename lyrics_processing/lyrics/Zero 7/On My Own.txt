Imporous as she hides her pores
She'll sing my voice to anyone
She bore my teeth in lover's creed
Differently to anyone
There's just no way of leaving
It's midnight in a perfect world
Stay with me
And we can have it all
She flatters to deceive me
While lonely creatures gather round
Hand in hand
Trying not to fall

What will it take for me to learn from my mistakes
Before this reputation takes me down?
When will I learn to go home to my fears
Before this reputation takes me down?

I'm in love
I'm in love
On my own
I'm in love
In love
On my own
I'm in love
I'm in love
On my own
I'm in love
In love
On my own
You might also like
I fell in love in a bathroom stall
I said, "I've never felt like this before,"
Like the night was ours, the wolves had gone
She grinned at me and said, "I'm yours."
She needs me I'm not leaving
Speaks to me in perfumed words
Indiscreet
Echos from the walls
If only you could see me
Dancing with the perfect girl
Cheek to cheek
Trying not to fall

What will it take for me to learn from my mistakes
Before this reputation takes me down?
When will I learn to go home to my fears
Before this reputation takes me down?

I'm in love
I'm in love
On my own
(On my own)
I'm in love
In love
On my own
I'm in love
I'm in love
On my own
(On my own)
I'm in love
In love
On my own
I'm in love
I'm in love
On my own
I'm in love
In love
On my own
I'm in love
I'm in love
On my own
I'm in love
In love
On my own
