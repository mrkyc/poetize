I came from nothing, ain't that something?
Look what I've been through
And now I'm out here, feel like my year
Got all my friends through
'Cause I want this life for life, for life
This life for life, for life
'Cause I want this life for life, for life
This life for life, for life
'Cause I want it for life

It's feeding all night
Look at my ride, look at my life
Waking the night
Dreamed of this life, I'll be so patient
Waited all night
You know now I'm flexing, I'm fucking these hoes
Rollie is finally Rolls
Touring the club and I'm killing these shows
And I'm stacking, I'm stacking these hoes
Bad bitch into my arm and she ain't never tell me no
I just hit the crib with a brand new bitch
They both gon' find that pole
'Cause they all down to go, they been kissin' on the low
They been sniffin' on that blow when I never trust a hoe
'Cause everybody wanna get paid, I ain't no free ride
If I come inside, it's the best day of her life and

Feel mad rich, never sold my soul
When I told my pops that I copped that Rove

And to fuck that job cause I got that, that dough
Yeah, you know I got that money to blow
Yeah, you know that's how it goes
I puts it down (yeah), I puts it down (whoo!)
I don't fuck around, I don't fuck around
Had no time for chillin' or sippin', was rappin' and singin'
