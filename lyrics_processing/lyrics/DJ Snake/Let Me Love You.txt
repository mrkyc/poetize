I used to believe
We were burnin' on the edge of somethin' beautiful (Somethin' beautiful)
Somethin' beautiful (Somethin' beautiful)
Sellin' a dream
Smoke and mirrors keep us waitin' on a miracle (Oh)

Say, go through the darkest of days
Heaven's a heartbreak away
Never let you go, never let me down
Oh, it's been a hell of a ride
Driving the edge of a knife
Never let you go, never let me down

Don't you give up, nah-nah-nah
I won't give up, nah-nah-nah
Let me love you
Let me love you
Don't you give up, nah-nah-nah
I won't give up, nah-nah-nah
