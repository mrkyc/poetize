They used to sing about pickup trucks on my radio
Now those SOBs are in SUVs that ain't never left the road
But it keeps on workin'
Lord, Lord, Lord, it keeps on workin'
I was raised up on the outlaws, just three chords and the truth
But someone traded steel guitar for a big lie and the loot
But it keeps on workin'
Lord, Lord, Lord, it keeps on workin'

I ain't never been that good at bein' things I'm not
I just sing what I know, even though that ain't a lot
Wrong or right, whether you like my music or you don't
I live and breathe my country to the bone
I don't just sing the song

There ain't no country music down on Music Row these days
Used to feel all down back home, now it's watered down LA
But it keeps on workin'
Lord, Lord, Lord, it keeps on workin'
Just when I think it's over, another one comes along
A fresh new face in his sister's jeans, singin' the same damn song
But it keeps on workin'
Tell me why, why, why does it keep on workin'?

'Cause I ain't never been that good at being things I'm not
I just sing what I know, even though that ain't a lot
Wrong or right, whether you like my music or you don't
I live and breathe my country to the bone
I don't just sing the song

Yeah, Waylon never just sang the song
Keith Whitley, he never just sang the song
Merle, Hank, and Johnny and Lefty never just sang the song
Lord, they lived it, right or wrong
But they never just sang the song

But it keeps on workin'
Lord, Lord, Lord, it keeps on workin'
Yeah, it keeps on workin'
