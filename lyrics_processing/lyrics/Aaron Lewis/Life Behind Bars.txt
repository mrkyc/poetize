Spendin' my time livin' life behind bars
Ain't doin' hard time, but the times get hard
Didn't come wearin' cuffs in the back of some car
No judge, no jury ever put me here

Got a story to tell ya
A bunch of songs and there ain't nothin' 'bout no rock 'n' roll
Sold my soul to the devil
A pocketful of songs for a handful of gold, uh-huh
That was the day that everything changed

Spendin' my time livin' life behind bars
Ain't doin' hard time, but the times get hard
Didn't come wearin' cuffs in the back of some car
No judge, no jury ever put me here
Still payin' this price for the life I chose
Once you got a record, guess it's how it goes
Still servin' my sentence with this old guitar
Spendin' my time livin' life behind bars

Done a few nights locked up in county
Did the time, paid the fine, then they let me go
But this ain't that kind of party
No jail, no bail, and hell, no parole
