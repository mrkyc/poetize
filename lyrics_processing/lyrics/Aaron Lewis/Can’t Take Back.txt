I'm the last cuss word that cuts like a razor
The first sip of sin from an old brown sack
A feel good then, and hate yourself later
I'm just another thing that you can't take back

Another lonesome sun is almost gone
And the shadows climb the wall
Up to that nail where a picture hung
But you don't care at all
But you don't care at all

'Cause I'm the last cuss word that cuts like a razor
The first sip of sin from an old brown sack
A feel good then, and hate yourself later
I'm just another thing that you can't take back

As I lay my head in this big ol' bed
I think of you and me
And if I lay in this bed I made
I don't get no sleep
You ain't comin' back to me

'Cause I'm the last cuss word that cuts like a razor
The first sip of sin from an old brown sack
A feel good then, and hate yourself later
I'm just another thing that you can't take back


I'm the wrong first time, the first puff of smoke (First puff of smoke)
Give it a try when you should've said no (Should've said no)
Just this once, it tears you in two
But don't do that, that you go ahead and do

I'm the last cuss word that cuts like a razor
The first sip of sin from an old brown sack
A feel good then, and hate yourself later
I'm just another thing that I can't take
'Cause I'm the last cuss word that cuts like a razor
The first sip of sin from an old brown sack
A feel good then, and hate yourself later
