It sits above the mantel, on a couple rusty nails
It ain't worth a lot of money, and it damn sure ain't for sale
The good Lord only knows all the stories it could tell
My granddaddy's gun

Well he bought it new out of the Sears-Roebuck catalog
And it shot a many shells over the back of an old bird dog
It backed a burglar down when grandma took the safety off
Granddaddy's gun

It's just an old double barrel twelve
The stock is cracked and it kicks like hell
It wouldn't mean what mean's to me, to no one
I can still hear his voice when I put it to my shoulder
A guns like a woman son, it's all how you hold her
Taught me a whole lot more than how to hunt

And one of these days I'll pass it on to my grandson
My granddaddy's gun

He handed it to me on the day I turned thirteen
With a half shot box of shells and a kit to keep it clean
I keep a picture in the case of that sweet old man and me
Granddaddy's gun

One of these days I'll pass it on to my grandson
My granddaddy's gun

There's a long beard hangin' on my livin' room wall
That I got with a box call
And, grandaddy's gun
And there's a shot up sign out there on 49
That me and Billy Joe shot up one night
With, granddaddy's gun

Well it sits above the mantel, on a couple rusty nails
