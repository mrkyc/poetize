What a sad state of affairs I'm in
'Cause I'm tryin' to compete where I just don't fit in
'Cause the country, if you call it that, from off the Row
Ain't country just because I'm old enough to know, that

That ain't country, that's a natural fact
It's full of tales of good times and happy endings, my life ain't like that
So I'll keep listenin' to the old songs that my grandad used to play
Full of pain and heartache and desperation and the ones that got away

The ones that speak to me, the way I feel today

So tell me, whatever happened to the country songs
Full of truth and consequences, all the things gone wrong
Someone came and changed it up, made it all a lie
I'd like to spit a little Beech-Nut right in that dude's eye, 'Cause

That ain't country, that's a natural fact
It's full of tales of good times and happy endings, my life ain't like that
So I'll keep listenin' to the old songs that my granddad used to play
Full of pain and heartache and desperation and the ones that got away

(Now listen here)

We got Waylon singin' songs 'bout a Ramblin' Man
And Junior's got a cold one in his hand
And the Possum's gettin' drunk again, imagine that
And Charlie Daniels playin' fiddle underneath that hat
And John and June are goin' back and forth again
And David Allan Coe is singin' 'bout his kin
And Haggard sings the songs that'll save your soul
And Willie sings the songs about the hearts he stole, 'Cause

That shit's country, that's a natural fact
It's full of tales of hard times and complications, ain't life like that?
So I'll keep listenin' to the old songs that my grandad used to play
Full of pain and heartache and desperation and the ones that got away

The ones that speak to me, the way I feel today
