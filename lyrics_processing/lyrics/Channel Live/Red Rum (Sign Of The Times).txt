Evil rules everything around me
Scream! Armageddon blood shedding
Prepare where's your weapon

I stay fly like Tom in Days go by
And die by the God, word eye for an eye
I'm living the American nightmare, it's where
Souls get laid down, sleep without a prayer
It made millionaires off black despair
In a world freezing cold like wars in winter air
They swear God you was born just to go to jail
It got your wiz thinking that you can't exhale
But inhale the hersey
Before Uncle Sam's hands submerse me
Vampires is blood thirsty
Six thousand years curse me, work me, jerk me
My mind reverse G now it's time to reimburse me
I'm robbing devils like the IRS
And repossess in the statue of liberty of death
No matter who you are, where you at or from
When it come, deaf and dumb will be getting served Red Rum
 {x2}
It's a sign of the times
Add on or you die
We stay high like bricks and marija'
As the world burns and the drama grows thicker
Deaf and dumb will be getting served Red Rum
You might also like
I give my life like crucifixion
But the Christians got my wisdom
Wishing like crack head be fiending on a mission
For the matter
Livest liver
I wonder what's the matter
If religion is what yo practice, different Gods will gather
For the jewels
Fools be wearing Timbos dressed in pink before we sink to the bottom
I'm trying to hit this Brinks
Truck, yo what the fuck do luck
Got to do with the rules
Of laws of nature when you know the bucks moving
If your pocket got a knot, you can rock nonstop
Spot the Glock out the peripheral of your blind spot
Ayo, drop, freeze
Blown away with the breeze
Toking on a bowl trying to make the pain ease
From the hells of Gamora
To the jails of 
Black men getting burnt because the system's out of order
Like the water plus daughter
Sell the pussy for a quarter
If the devil speaks with forked tongue what the fuck's a lawyer?

I can't rest can't sleep
My mind's locked down by the beast, no peace
Police increase
Crime increases it's war
7-24 at your door hit the floor
Truth escape wickedness through the trapdoor
Black life been hardcore since Gettysburg four score
And seven no where to run like Reverend Armageddon
Got my body stressing like pork in your midsection
Making your ears deaf into the lesson
(No struggle no aggression)
No question, no peace with no weapon
Millennium threaten nights I wake cold sweating
Under moon crescents
Days seem like seconds
If life is but a journey this must be a slave ship
In the belly of the demon, screaming, "I can't take it"
Like a river named Phoenix, is the sun past the zenith
Because the evil flows around like syphilis out the penis
He's a genius like the riddler
(Rather sell out like the fiddler)
Or should I rock the vote when the only choice is Hitler?
Or some cotton picker, pass the ganja not the liquor
Hillary's stuck on my block, somebody might stick her
