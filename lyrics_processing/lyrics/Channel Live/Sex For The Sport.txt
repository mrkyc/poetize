Sex for the sport, the metaphor I kick is rhythmic
So listen, no competition, my love's Olympic
The pace that I set beats the mind until it scores
Waiting for the games to begin with my torch comes the javelin
The distance it can't be measured
The pleasure too deep, infinity marks the record
She's begging for my tongue to cease, so I halted
She wrestled me on the mat then up my pole she vaulted
Gymnastic flips and other tricks is how my game is
I'm live when I dive into sex like Greg Louganis
I don't come quick, sprints is not my meet
Sex for the sport a gold medal athlete

Can we sex for the sport of it, the sport of it?
Can we sex for the sport?
Can we sex for the sport of it, the sport of it?
Sisters bring your game to my court

Introducing, yes gives it to me and don't stop
My three forwards for boot knock
My main man Johnson jams hoops from the center position
To break her backboard's his mission
A guard name Jim Hats with mad control
His points to guard my brown balls to the hole
Or hoops no crap shoots, he plays close with Johnson
Johnson lost sense, caught a permanent bench
Don't stop
Bricks up my rock, rebound
Yes gives it to me
I stroke for the three
A trey was fouled for the four play
Back and forth, in and out my big brown balls sway
Then it drops
I got mad arch in my down stroke child
No referees so nothing's foul
We can get wild like the west
A full court press on ya chest with no twenty second rest
More plans than plants I don't miss backward tricks
Came out to see my Johnson slam out of flip
So don't trip
No need to bust your vocal cords
Crash, I shattered her hoop and her backboard

Stepping to my plate what's my fate
When I am swinging on a date I never rape
Just like I'm never singing
I'm wrapping when I'm batting
Louisville is hanging phat and fit the kitten like a mitten
Check my balls to see what's happening
I'm coming when I'm running to the 2's and to the 1's
Bases on your faces I hit the home runs
I'm not selling out
So I'm never popping flies
I'm going for the triple while I rose between your thighs
Forget the hi 5's
I'm collecting bucks
Wanna block me like a catcher but I'm coming like a trucker
I wear my hats when I bat
Correction say protection
Honey choke her for my wood cause I got the fat erection

So flip the quarter here's the order
I'm the giver you receive lay back
I've been in more sacks than quarterbacks
Let's kick off, this ain't golf
No little white balls to split ya up rights
I've been between more legs than Hudson Heights
She's on the rag, yellow flag, game delay
Won't touch her down for my brown balls it's out of bounds
I'm throwing hard balls and spirals, not Nerfs
No pushing up on breast implants, that's artificial turf
Like Buffalo I got Bills for Bears I Jets
I'm bucking hearing Redskins like a Raider when I sex
The Chief Stealer of a virgin of Saints I hit plenty
The flavor is 49er plus 20

Sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, sex for the sport of it
