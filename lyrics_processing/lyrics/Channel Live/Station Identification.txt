I spark a mental cypher lasting down through revelations
Take a trip into my mental cypher, I get hyper
Sniping-ass MC's, seem to get me higher
Like the buddah, bless the sess when I'm smoking
Hawaiian when I'm rhymin cuz there ain't no time for joking
Just lyrical bliss from the depths of the abyss
Rotating lyrical rhythms like the motions of the wrist
On a fag, I rag, wack MC's like Maxi
Pads, you can't see me
Intellectually, you shallow, mentally, you're just starving
I'm rollin on em like Calvin Butts up in Harlem
Wit metaphors, fuck a nine and clip
I make a rapper trip like white chicks in horror flicks
Identify your station or ?adjustment?
I'm transmitting, I'm giving MC's division, through diction
Cut em half, check the math, like magician
Conflicting pain on membranes
I'm running shit and killing flows like sewer drains
I maintain, no static feedback when I attack
Like Shaquille, oh so neal down as I appeal to the masses
I slash kids to ashes and dust, get strucked
As I construct skills that build, I don't be giving a fuck
Like chastity, my compacity's unlimited
Wit no gimmick, kids can't figure my structure like pyramids
I'm spirited like psychic and dead men resurrected
My wisdon's like prisms when light gets reflected, check it
My lyrical missiles, like heat suckers seeking
Never weakening, feeding off wack rhymers give me strength
Then I lengthen, wit no measure
Cuz I'm the ruler of styles, I rocket, the unidentified flowing object
You might also likeTime for a station, identification
Wack rappers, open up your eyes, time for lyrical elevation
But you can't handle when I channel
Entering through mental panels, melting membranes like candles
Disintegrating mental matter, into ashes
Steppin up to rappers, just like the Titan Clashes
Bash an eyelash, my lyrical energy travels fastest
When propel by the leaves of Hawaii
Hardcore raps is about skills, so why do gangstas keep trying
I'm breakin on these muthafuckas like beat, street
I beat other rappers like Sega meets beats, the beat meets
Vocal technique like Panasonic
My rhythm moves in motion cuz my skills is like bionic
Identification, station switches wit my lyrical hydraulics
I'm cosmic, the unidentified flowing object
I find that you can't defined this, other rappers are blind to this
I'm seeing, you're bleeding from your sinuses
Cuz I'm on a higher plane, I'll be frying brains
I crack heads like cocaine addicts, automatic
Dramatic, I break backs, I'm chiropractic
I got mad, drastic tactics and static
Gymnastic styles it seems
Cuz I be flippin and balancing beams
Of radiation, devastation, you're facing, no tracing
You can't sketch a figure, abstract, no pullin' gats
If you're wack, my rhymes are triggered, you're dying quicker
I jack, cuz I rip a weak-ass rapper, I shatter
Cross em, toss em, the more erratic, flow patterns them in the war zone
Females, you need braille, you can't see what I'm speaking
In fact, your delinquency can't see my frequency
I speak to thee in tongues like the exorcist
You can't test this, I resurrect wit correctness
I'm defying like death is
Open up your eyes and, open up your ears and
Check your station, check your station (3x)
Open up your eyes and, open up your ears and
Check your station, identification
Open up your eyes and, open up your ears and
Check your station, yo, it's time to come real, now yo
Open up your eyes and, open up your ears and
