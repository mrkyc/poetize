You see that shit right Tuffy?
Let's just analyse society and reality and what's really going on man. Motherfuckers claiming they making sense...the only way they making it, is in they pockets, you know what I'm saying? Dealing with currency. Mentally ain't nobody doing it, you know? Do you understand?

Six cents is your six sense where's your sense?
Ever since I got my sixes everything makes cents
 Spent they cents making no sense
My sixth sentences will get me  non sense

Trekking through the dense surrounded by your fence
Six pence for the sense using for intelligence
Ignorance gets cut like a sickle with the nickle plus one penny
Tell me do you have any?
Six sense for the thought
Six sense gets bought
Sold out without six, don't get caught
Without sense, common sense, six cents is essential
More tuition intuition
Six sense gets potential
Smoke weed (indeed)
Cut leaves like a sickle
MC's mislead, when I got dimes for a nickle
Can you sense it?
Can you sense it?
Don't you dis spend it (expand it)
Intelligence expands, ignorance condense and fenced in
(Fenced it)
So read 'bout what I've hidden
Ain't nothing changed since so motherfuck Bill Clinton

Tense brothers pack for those who act like they lost they sense
How much sense does that make?
No sense, so to ease my sense
I spent my last cents on sensimil'
I seen some, pulling triggers
But it's not the trigger that kills, it's the senses of a nigga
