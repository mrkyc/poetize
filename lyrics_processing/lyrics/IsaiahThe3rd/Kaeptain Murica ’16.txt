I think I am legend
You think it's all alleged
I play the fool it's working
My thoughts recollected
Oh now I finally get it
Serpents love to lay and slither
Turned me to a shameless sinner
I got the right to shine
Not no ordinary treasure
If we're talking colors
Ain't no ordinary nigga
Inny minny minie mo
Spot a brother by his clothes
If he won't work, let him go
Famous for amount of hoes
Cover every tooth in gold
Do it for the Stars and Stripes
Founded off of genocide
Pillaging and living lies
Line em up who next to die?
Getting star power from their enterprise
Most don't ever analyze
Enter lies with dollar signs
Hidden fines in them model eyes
Taking shots from every side
Now I move like polygon
You might also likeI got these little nieces
My little Hershey kisses
College funded but keep a secret
Teaching em bout the light and the evil
In and out their favorite feature
Global boy would never leave em
Pirate talk like LA Leakers
Went from saving the boss to being one just like Kiefer
"I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one Nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all."
Mama think her only's too medicated
People sleeping on me like I'll never make it
Zeke getting Zs for the low, been forever waiting
My life in your hands then I doubt I'll make it
Now it's time to grab the wheel, how it feel in this new edition?
Not the same when my girl is missing
Still don the mask, S Class beating every mission
In and out when I'm feeling different, money is the true religion
So I ditch it like Ruroni Kenshin
While the price of living hits inflation and the Pink's like Kirby
Oh my god the 3rds relentless
Back in the days, hung with Cory Jenkins
Now most of my friendships can't even mention
Won't see me much if you lack initiative
Artificial, manakins so naturalistic
Avoiding backstabbers with my afterimage
I've done a lot of wrongs
Many songs, telegraph sounds coming from the terror dome
God always get me home, our ties is set in stone
Might be his favorite clone
Blessed me with mind control
Jinzo my brains' in charge
Grew up on heart of cards
Kaiba with blue eyes they yachted up
I talk bout steal I look like I'm Zabuza
Mama told me Ima have to pray
I don't really know what to say
Really want to yell in his face
Trapped me doly in the figure 8
I just wish she called me
My real love real phony
Don't do dog and pony
Euro young Ginobli
Hit list filled with foreigns
Californicated
Rolling up in Porsches
Sober or sedated
Always practice caution
No scratch on my shield
State cap Bradley Beal
Brooklyn Boi like Steve
Who ain't got a need?
I can't beat my greed
Most ain't self aware
They should pledge to me
I'm a selfish boi
Viktor with the grip
If you're Richy Rich
I can't stand that shit
Good or bad bad? I can't balance it
