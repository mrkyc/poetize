When the day is done and there's nowhere to run
(Nowhere to run)
And the people of the city have all lost and won
In your city dress, you stand and stare
(You stand and stare)
And you smoke another cigarette and comb your hair

And the light (The light) that shines (That shines)
Paints a trace of sadness
On the street (The street), I wait (I wait)
But I can't seem to get to you

Oh, you start to sway, check your Cartier
(It's getting late)
'Cause it's getting late, you can't afford to wait
So you move along where it's going on
(It's going on)
And the people of the night are playing 'till the dawn

And the sun (The sun) that shines (That shines)
Paints a trace of sadness
In your eyes (Those eyes) that cry (That cry)
Wishing and a-hoping, oh
You might also like
Sweet, sweet is the night
Now you are near
Dark, dark were the days
They disappear
Sweet, sweet is the night
Now you are near

Well, you did your thing and you lost your wings
(You did your thing)
And you hurt so bad, you lost everything
And the tears that fall on the city wall
(The city wall)
Will fade away with the rays of morning light

(The light) That shines (That shines)
Paints a smile across your pretty face
(Your face) And I know (I know)
Everything is all right, hey, all right

Sweet, sweet is the night
(Sweet is the night) Now you are near
Dark, dark were the days
(They disappear) They disappear
Sweet, sweet is the night
(Sweet is the night) Now you are near
(Sweet is the night)
Sweet, sweet is the night
(Sweet is the night) Now you are near
Dark, dark were the days (Days)
(They disappear) They disappear
Sweet, sweet is the night
(Sweet is the night) Now you are near
