Well, I came a long way to be here today
And I left you so long on this avenue
And here I stand in the strangest land
Not knowing what to say or do
As I gaze around at these strangers in town
I guess the only stranger is me

And I wonder (Yes, I wonder)
Yes, I wonder (Oh, I wonder)
Is this the way life's meant to be?

Although it's only a day since I was taken away
And left standing here looking in wonder
(It's your life, it's your life)
Oh, the ground at my feet
Maybe it's just the old street
But everything that I know lies under
(It's your life, it's your life)
And when I see what they've done
To this place that was home
Shame is all that I feel, oh
You might also like
And I wonder (Oh, I wonder)
Yes, I wonder (Wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder)
Is this the way life's meant to be?

Too late, too late to cry, the people say
Too late for you, too late for me
"You've come so far, now you know everything, my friend"
(Look and see the wonders of our world)


And I wonder (Oh, I wonder)
Yes, I wonder (Yes, I wonder)
Is this the way life's meant to be?

As I wander around this wreck of a town
Where people never speak aloud
With its ivory towers and its plastic flowers
I wish I was back in 1981
Just to see your face instead of this place
Now I know what you mean to me, ooh
And I wonder (Oh, I wonder)
Yes, I wonder (Yes, I wonder)
Is this the way life's meant to be?


And I wonder (Oh, I wonder)
Yes, I wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder
Is this the way life's meant to be?

Ooh, I wonder
Oh, I wonder, wonder, wonder
Is this the way life's meant to be?
Oh-oh-oh, is this the way life's meant to be?
Mmm, is this the way life's meant to be?
I wanna know, now
