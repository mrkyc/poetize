Big wheels
Keep turning
They turn forever and ever

I've been thinkin' it over, so many times they say
You got it made they never understand
The answer lies within your soul
'Cause no one knows which side the coin will fall

Big wheels turnin', baby, I know (Or not at all)
Big wheels turnin', baby, I know (Or not at all)
Big wheels turnin', turnin'

Save it for a rainy day for when the cold wind blows
To see how they run I thought they'd know
I tried my best, all I could do
But somehow, it was not enough for you

Big wheels turnin', baby, I know (Oh, nothing but a wheel)
Big wheels turnin' (No, no, no)
Baby, I know (No, no, no)
Big wheels turnin', turnin'
Turnin', turnin', turnin'
You might also like
I remember the dead of night
A lonely light that shines upon the window
I see it all so clear the tenderness, the silent tears
Out here in the pouring rain
Through cold dark waiting days, I see you standing there
I see the big wheels turnin', never endin', on and on they go

I think I'm goin' home
I think I'm gonna have to start again
It's rather sad, because I've looked around
Can't seem to find whatever's always rollin' through my mind

Big wheels turnin', baby, I know (Through my mind)
Big wheels turnin', baby, I know
Big wheels turnin', turnin'
Turnin', turnin', turnin'

I remember the dead of night
A lonely light that shines upon the window
Oh, I see it all so clear the tenderness, the silent tears
Out here in the pouring rain
Through cold dark waiting days, I see you standing there
I see the big wheels turnin' never endin', on and on they go
Ooh, ooh
