(Sweet talkin' woman)
Where did you go?

I was searchin' (Searchin') on a one-way street
I was hopin' (Hopin') for a chance to meet
I was waitin' for the operator on the line

(She's gone so long) What can I do?
(Where could she be?) No, no, no
Don't know what I'm gonna do
I gotta get back to you

You gotta slow down (Slow down)
Sweet talkin' woman (Slow down)
You got me runnin' (Run, run), you got me searchin'
Hold on (Hold on)
Sweet talkin' lover (Hold on)
It's so sad if that's the way it's over

I was thinkin' (Thinkin') 'bout the lonely nights

Insufficient data coming through

Don't know what I'm gonna do
I gotta get back to you, no!
