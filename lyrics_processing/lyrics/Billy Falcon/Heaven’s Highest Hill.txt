How do I tell myself I'll be staying alone? Oh, I...I can't stop crying
She'll say,"Daddy, I wanna hold her...wanna see her again
I wanna kiss her..wanna touch her." Oooo, what can I say? So do I
Oh Mama, I'm missing you real bad
But, it don't do me no good sittin' thinking 'bout what we had...
Love don't stop...it goes on forever
Love don't stop...and it never will
Love don't stop...one day we'll be together
Love don't stop...and I'll sing this song to you someday from heaven's highest hill
How 'm I gonna look into those big brown eyes
When she wakes up crying out in the middle of the night for the Mama?
How will I make it better?
The house is full of people but nobody's home
Everybody's here and I'm all alone calling out your name
But, there's no answer
Oh Mama, last night she told me not to cry
I swear I see you every time she smiles
Love don't stop...it goes on forever
Love don't stop...and it never will
Love don't stop...one day we'll be together
Love don't stop...and I'll sing this song to you someday from heaven's highest hill
You might also likeI don't know if you hear me. Sometimes I'd like to think you do
All the things we been fightin' for, I'm gonna make them all come true
And these arms, they ache to hold you-and I know one day I will
I'll meet you in the tall grass up on heaven's highest...
Love don't stop...it goes on forever
Love don't stop...and it never will
Love don't stop...one day we'll be together
Love don't stop...and I'll sing this song to you someday on heaven's highest hill
(love don't stop)
(love don't stop) one day we'll be together
(love don't stop) on heaven's highest hill
(love don't stop) our love goes on forever
(love don't stop) and it always will
