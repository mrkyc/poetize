If you're bleeding, then everyone can see you're bleeding
They can call for the doctor
Who'll provide what the diagnosis says you're needing
Then he'll take away your pain

But if your heart, your heart has been broken
And you don't wear it on your sleeve
No one can tell, your hell goes unspoken
But there's one thing you must believe

Time heals the wounds no one can see
Time heals the wounds that no one can see
Whoa, time heals the wounds no one can see
Don't you know, time heals the wounds that no one can see

If you're crying, then everyone can see you crying
And they all sympathize, but it just doesn't matter
Though they may be trying
They can't feel the hurt inside

You can't go on, you've gone to the limit
And your life seems to slip away
You're on your own, alone, you must face it
And tomorrow's so far away

Whoa, time heals the wounds no one can see
Don't you know time heals the wounds that no one can see

You can't go on, you've gone to the limit
And your life seems to slip away
You're on your own, alone, you must face it
And tomorrow's so far away

You gotta hold on 'cause time heals the wounds no one can see
Whoa, time heals the wounds that no one can see
I know you'll make it, time heals the wounds no one can see
They say time heals the wounds that no one can see

Time heals the wounds no one can see
Whoa time heals the wounds that no one can see
Time heals the wounds no one can see
Time heals the wounds no one can see
Time heals the wounds that no one can see
Time heals the wounds no one can see
