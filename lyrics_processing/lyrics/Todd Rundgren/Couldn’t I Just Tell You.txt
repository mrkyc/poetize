Keep your head and everything will be cool
You didn't have to make me feel like a fool
When I tried to say I feel the way that I do
I want to talk with you
And make it loud and clear
Though you don't care to hear but

Couldn't I just tell you the way I feel?
I can't keep it bottled up inside
And could we pretend that it's no big deal
And there's really nothing left to hide?

Something sure doesn't seem right to me
When you can turn your back whenever you please
And you stroll away and calmly bid me adieu
Why can't I talk with you
And put it in your ear
Though you don't care to hear but

Couldn't I just tell you the way I feel?
I can't keep it bottled up inside
And could we pretend that it's no big deal
And there's really nothing left to hide?

(Hear me out, ooh)
Why don't you lend me an ear
(Hear me out, ooh)
You got no reason to fear
(Hear me out, ooh)
I'll make it perfectly clear I love you


I don't come whining with my heart on my sleeve
I'm not a coward, if that's what you believe
And I'm not afraid but not ashamed if it's true
I got to talk with you
And then I'll make it clear
Make it clear
Make it clear

Couldn't I just tell you the way I feel
I can't keep it bottled up inside
And could we pretend that it's no big deal
