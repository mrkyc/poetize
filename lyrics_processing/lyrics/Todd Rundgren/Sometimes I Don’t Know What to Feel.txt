Sometimes I don't know what
(Sometimes I don't know)
I just don't know what to feel

Sometimes I don't know what to feel
Everything I thought that I knew starts to look so unreal
There's a ringing in my head that keeps me awake at night
Sometimes I don't know what is right
Today I saw a car crush my little dog under its wheel
It did not even stop, it just sped off and out of sight
Sometimes I just feel so afraid
But I know that no one else has it made
So if I just believe in myself
I won't need no help from nobody else
And I can make it alone
And everything will be cool
I got to keep on keepin' on
There's nothing else I can do

Sometimes I don't know what
(Sometimes I don't know)
I just don't know what to feel
Sometimes I don't know what
(Sometimes I don't know)
I just don't know what to feel

Sometimes I don't know what to do
Someone said the world's going to end and I think it's true
I thought there was some love in the world but I guess I'm wrong
Sometimes I just feel so alone
I don't want to admit to my friends that I feel confused
I wonder what I'd do with myself if the world was gone
But something makes me stay on my feet
"Don't you dare admit to defeat!"
And if I tell myself it's all right
I can comfort myself through the night
And watch another day dawn
And everything will be cool
I got to keep on keepin' on
There's nothing else I can do
