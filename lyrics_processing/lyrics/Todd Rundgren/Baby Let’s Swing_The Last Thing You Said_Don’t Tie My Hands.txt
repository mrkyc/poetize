Laura, I saw you open in L.A
There's something I gotta say
Laura, you know it's really been such a long, long time
And you know

Laura, I knew you'd make it good someday
And you knew it anyway
Laura, I know that maybe this is the wrong, wrong time

But Laura, where did that magic go?
It's so hard, it's so cold down here
Did you have to leave me behind?

I wish that I could make it
But how I love to shuffle (how I love to shuffle)
Baby let's swing (how I love to shuffle)
Now I love to shuffle (how I love to shuffle)
Ever since I heard you sing (since I heard her sing)

So many people have heard me cry
Since that terrible day when you said goodbye
So many dark corners have heard me say
How the light has gone out since you went away

Everyone's heard of how you left me again
Everyone's heard about my so-called friends
They tell me I'm a fool, but I don't hear a word
'Cause the last thing you said was the last thing I heard
(The last thing you said was the last thing I heard)

How many times I've tried to talk to my heart
But it won't even listen since you tore it apart
I have to tell myself there's only one thing to do
Try and find someone else and forget about you

I know she doesn't mean a thing in the world
I waste my hours with another girl
She says she loves me so, but I don't hear a word
'Cause the last thing you said was the last thing I heard
(The last thing you said was the last thing I heard)

Long lost, gone
I can tell by the way that you carry on
And it's now I see
After all of this time what it's done to me
Can't you see? I can't go free
If you make me watch you cry one more time
Once more I walk away
Once more I hear you say
Once more please try to stay
Once more I may

Don't tie my hands, don't lock that door
Don't make me stand for this love anymore
Please let me leave, don't start making that scene
Don't crush me in between

No one I wanted more
I wanted to love, to be mine
Now it turns out I have to say goodbye
And I don't see why
I should have to watch you cry one more time

Once more I walk away
Once more I hear you say
Once more please try to stay
Once more I may

Don't tie my hands, don't lock that door
Don't make me stand for this love anymore
Please let me leave, don't start making that scene
Don't crush me in between
Don't tie my hands, don't lock that door
Don't make me stand for this love anymore
Please let me leave, don't start making that scene
Don't crush me in between
Don't tie my hands  (don't crush me in between) don't lock that door
Don't make me stand (don't crush me in between) for this love anymore
Please let me leave (don't crush me in between) don't start making that scene
