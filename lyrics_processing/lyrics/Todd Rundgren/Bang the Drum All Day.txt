Alright! Everybody now!

I don't want to work
I want to bang on the drum all day
I don't want to play
I just want to bang on the drum all day

Ever since I was a tiny boy
I don't want no candy
I don't need no toy
I took a stick and an old coffee can
I bang on that thing 'til I got
Blisters on my hand because

I don't want to work
I want to bang on the drum all day
(Yes, I do)
I don't want to play
I just want to bang on the drum all day
(That's right)

When I get older, they think I'm a fool
The teacher told me I should stay after school
She caught me pounding on the desk with my hands
But my licks were so hot, I made the teacher wanna dance
And that's why

Every day when I get home from work
I feel so frustrated, the boss is a jerk
And I get my sticks and go out to the shed
And I pound on that drum like it was the boss' head
Because

I don't want to work
I want to bang on the drum all day
(Bang! Bang!)
I don't want to play
I just want to bang on the drum all day
(I can bang that drum)
I don't want to work

I want to bang on the drum all day
(Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!)
I don't want to play

I just want to bang on the drum all day
(Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!)
