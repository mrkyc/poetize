You're prettier than all the world
I'm so proud (I'm so proud)
I'm so proud of you
'Cause you're only one fellow's girl
I'm so proud (I'm so proud)
I'm so proud of you

I'm so proud of being
Loved by you

And it would hurt, hurt to know
If you ever were untrue, yeah

Sweeter than the taste of a cherry so sweet
Yeah, yeah, and I'm so proud (I'm so proud)
I'm so proud of you
Compliments to you from all the people we meet
Yes babe and I'm so proud  (I'm so proud)
I'm so proud of you

I did you wrong
My heart went out to play
But in the game I lost you
What a price to pay, hey
I'm crying

Ooh, baby, baby
Ooh, baby, baby

Mistakes
I know I've made a few
But I'm only human
You've made mistakes too
I'm crying
Ooh, baby, baby
Ooh oo-ooh, baby, baby

I'm just about at the end of my rope
But I can't stop trying, I can't give up hope

'Cause I believe
One day I'll hold you near
Whisper I still love you
Until that day is here
I'm crying

Ooh oo-ooh baby, baby
Ooh oo-ooh ooh baby, baby
Ooh oo-oo-oo-ooh oo-ooh oo-ooh baby, baby
Ooh ooh ooh ooh baby, baby
Ooh oo-oo-oo-ooh


Many guys have come to you
With a line that wasn't true
And then you passed them by (passed them by)
Now you're in the center ring
And their lies don't mean a thing
Why won't you let me try
Now I don't have a diamond ring
I don't even know a song to sing
All I know is la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la means
I love you, oh oh baby
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la means
I love you

If I ever saw a girl
That I needed in this world
You are the one for me (one for me)
Let me take you in my arms
And fill you with my charms
I'm sure that you will see (you will see)
The things I am saying are true
And the way that I say them to you

Can't you hear me, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la means
I love you
Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la means
I love you
Woah
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la means
I love you
Bay, bay, bay-bay
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la means


Cool jerk, cool jerk
A cool jerk, a cool jerk

This cat they're talking about
I wonder who could it be
'Cause I know I'm the heaviest cat
The heaviest cat you ever did see
When they see me walking down the street
They think twice and then they speak
On their faces, they wear silly smirks
'Cause they know I'm the king of the cool jerks

Woah, cool jerk
Cool jerk

Ah ha ha ha ha ha ha
Look at them guys looking at me like I'm a fool
Aw, but deep down inside they know I'm cool
I said now, I said now the moment of truth has finally come
When I will show you some, some of that cool jerk

All right, now I want to hear a little bit
Of the drums by himself there, whoa!
All right, now I want to hear a little bit of a bass
With those eighty-eights
All right, now let's hear the organ player fall in
All right now everybody, I wanna hear you howl
Ah you're cooking, you're smoking

Do it, can you do it, can you do it, can you, can you
Do it, can you do it, can you do it, can you, can you
Cool jerk
Cool jerk

This cat they're talking about
I wonder who could it be
'Cause I know I'm the heaviest cat
The heaviest cat you ever did see
When they see me walking down the street
They think twice and then they speak
On their faces, they wear silly smirks
'Cause they know I'm the king of the cool jerks

Whoa
Cool jerk, cool jerk

Come on people can you do it now?
