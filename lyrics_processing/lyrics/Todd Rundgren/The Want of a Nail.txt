I've been wrong
I had plans so big
But the devil's in the details
I left out one thing
No one to love me
No one to love me
No one to love
For the want of a nail, the world was lost
For the want of a nail, the world was lost

For the want of a nail, the shoe was lost
For the want of a shoe, the horse was lost
For the want of a horse, the rider was lost
For the want of a rider, the message was lost
For the want of a nail, the world was lost
For the want of a nail, the world was lost

For the want of a rider, the message was lost
For the want of a message, the battle was lost
For the want of a battle, the war was lost
For the want of a war, the kingdom was lost

I've been wrong
I had plans so big
But the devil's in the details
I left out one thing
No one to love me
No one to love me
No one to love
Yes and no one to love

You're askin'
What's all this talk about horses and war?
Put yourself in the place of the man at the forge
And day after day you live a life without love
'Til the morning you can't take it anymore
And you don't get up
Multiply it a billion times
Spread it all 'round the world
Put the curse of loneliness on every boy and every girl
Until everybody's kicking, everybody's scratching
Everything seems to fail
And it was all for the want of a nail
(For the want of a nail)
Tell me what else could the answer be
(For the want of a nail)
(For the want of a nail)
Don't hold back now
(For the want of a nail)
Hey hey
(For the want of a nail the world was lost)
Want of a nail
(For the want of a nail the world was lost)
Wooh
(For the want of a nail the world was lost)
Don't hold back now
(For the want of a nail the world was lost)
Just a little tiny bit of love
(For the want of a nail the world was lost)
Don't hold back, don't hold back
(For the want of a nail the world was lost)
Give me all your love
(For the want of a nail the world was lost)
Don't hold back, don't hold back
(For the want of a nail the world was lost)
Hey, hey, hey!
