I think you better try to find another woman
Try, try to find one who loves you
And live with you the best you can
Don't start none of that grieving
This time she's leaving
She's packin' up her suitcase
Try to find another woman
When she first met you
You were her everything
You meant so much to her
She just had to be your loving bride
But in five years, you've changed
Now you never do nothin'
All you ever do is sit around the TV set, feed your fat face with slop
And make the woman's life a complete misery
I think you better
I think you better try to find another woman
Try, try to find one who loves you
And live with you the best you can
Don't start none of that grieving
'Cause this time she's leaving
She's packin' up her suitcase
Try to find another woman
