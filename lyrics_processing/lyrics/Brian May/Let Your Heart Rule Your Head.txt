Just a moment of your life is all I need
Don't say we should be parted
Because we only just got started
Let your heart rule your head tonight
There's a full moon shinin' on the water
There's a warm breeze blowin' off the sea
And when my pulse starts a racin'
I know life is for the tastin'
Let your heart rule your head tonight
Let your heart rule your head
Let your heart rule your head
Let your heart rule your head tonight
When your whole world is sinkin'
Come to my way of thinkin'
Let your heart rule your head tonight
It's been so long since I put my arms around you
And I don't know if it's real or it's a dream
But don't pussy-foot about it
Shout it
Just can't live without it
Let your heart rule your head tonight (everybody)

Come to my way of thinkin'
Let your heart rule your head tonight
Ooh you're starin' at my face as though I'm crazy
When I tell you that I need you every day
Can't you see that I love you pretty baby
And ol' time don't ever stop tickin' away - yeah
Well your Mama don't mind
And your Papa don't mind
But you'll never be mine
If you're thinkin' all the time
We can work it out right
When I'm holdin' you tight
We can make it tonight
Cos it ain't no crime
Don't let the moment slip away
Don't think about it - do it
Well I know that we're in a time of changes
And in love there is danger everywhere
But consider every portion
When you've taken your precautions
Let your heart (let your heart)
Let your heart (let your heart)
Let your heart (let your heart)
Let your heart let your heart let your heart
Let your heart rule your head
Let your heart rule your head
Let your heart rule your head tonight
When your whole world is sinkin'
Come to my way of thinkin'
Let your heart rule your head tonight
Oh sing it with me
Let your heart rule your head
Let your heart rule your head
Let your heart rule your head tonight
When your whole world is sinkin'
Come to my way of thinkin'
Let your heart rule your head tonight
