Yeah!

Ooh let me tell you now
Mama's in love, Papa's in love
It's such a shame they don't love each other, oh no
Papa's in a jam, Mama's throwin' pans
The game's up, it's time to run for cover

Everybody's cryin' but they can't stop hopin'
Everybody's lookin' for the door that's open
Mama's makin heat to keep the old fire smokin'
Papa's hangin' on to his old love token

You got love but you ain't got style
You want your freedom but in a while
You're lost children but you know for sure
You gotta find out who your love is for


Oh, baby life ain't what it used to be
You're tellin' me? Not since you've been hangin' around here
Hey
You might also likeMama what you screamin' for, actin' like a demon for?
And hey mama, quit wavin' them hands in the air (what?)
Don't talk to me that way!
Well, I don't see no reason to raise your voice to me
You put fat in the fire, you got meat for brains
Well, you don't give me comfort and a man's gotta get it somewhere
Ooh, that's a shame
Yeah, well
Mama's hangin' on to every word that's spoken
But Papa's hangin' on to his old love token
That's what it is
Here it comes, babe!

Oh I don't wanna leave you Mama
Said I don't wanna leave you Papa

Long haired women gonna turn you to stone
You can't beat 'em, cause you need 'em
You gotta live, you gotta love
You're love token's gotta fit like a glove

Listen to the story 'bout the dream that's broken
You gotta keep a hold of your old love token

Oh I don't wanna leave you Mama (mama mama mama mama mama)
Oh I don't wanna leave you Papa (papa papa papa papa papa)
Oh I don't wanna leave
No I don't wanna leave
No I don't wanna leave
No I don't wanna leave you alone
But I'm gonna have to, babe
Yeah!
