She's got everythin' you need, well you know what I mean
No it ain't what you're thinkin', she ain't love for sale, oh no
She'll get you jumping just for fun but there's a sting in her tale
She's a lover, she's a fighter, she's a red hot bit
You take her as you find her but you never can quit
She's a pretty little lady called China Belle
She's a Little Bit 'o Heaven and a Whole Lotta Hell
She got a bad reputation but you won't say no
You gonna need her sweet loving when you go, go, go
She gotta diamond on her finger, you can see it glisten
She's got plenty conversation (don't talk just listen)
She could be flat bed fakin', but you never can tell
Got the the body of an angel but you know darn well
She's a pretty little lady called China Belle
She's a Little Bit 'o Heaven and a Whole Lotta Hell
I was standing at the station on the neck of Siam
I met a man from Abu Dhabi said, "You know who I am?"
They call me Hard Nosed Harry who could never get hooked
But I fell in love with trouble and with just one look
She give you dirty loving honey make you feel real swell
But if you say you wanna stay she ain't that kind of gal
I said you're talkin' 'bout a lady that I know darn well
She's a Little Bit 'o Heaven and a
Whole Lotta Hell

You'll be singin' and a-dancin' underneath the Great Wall
But when you're strollin' in the rain through Tiananmen Square
You turn around to look for China and she ain't nowhere
She's a dangerous habit, she's a red hot hit
You could get a better rabbit but you just can't quit
She's a pretty little lady called China Belle
She's a pretty little lady called China Belle
She's a pretty little lady called China Belle
She's a Little Bit 'o Heaven and a
Whole Lotta hell
Take me to China
Take me away
