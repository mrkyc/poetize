NKOTBSB, baby

I know we haven't been getting along-long at all
I don't think that it's time
You and I to give in just call-call it off
I don't want to say goodbye

'Cause just when I think we're through
The memories come flooding back
It's like instantly I love you like that
I was on fire for you
We can get it back again
If you don't say it's the end, the end

So don't turn out the lights now
Lights now, light now
'Cause in a minute we'll be feeling like
Never before
Will I have the night now, night now, right now
I'll be whatever you need and more
So, don't turn out the lights now
Don't turn out the lights now
You might also like
I'mma give you a minute to clear-clear your head
Take the rest of the night, yeah
You gotta see that it's empty without me in bed
Baby, you'll change your mind

'Cause just when I think we're through
The memories come flooding back
And instantly you love me like that
I still got this fire for you
We can get it back again
If you don't say it's the end, the end

So don't turn out the lights now
Lights now, light now (Don't turn them out)
'Cause in a minute we'll be feeling like
Never before
Will I have the night now, night now, right now
I'll be whatever you need and more

Don't turn out the lights now

We gotta let go and take a chance
I'll take it higher, yeah
To the end, to the end, to the end
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Hey, so, don't turn out the lights
So don't turn out the lights now
Lights now, lights now
