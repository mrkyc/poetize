I know we haven't been getting along, long, at all
I don't think that its time
You and I can give in, just call, call it off
I don't wanna say goodbye!
Cause just when I think we're through
The memories come flooding back
Its like in-stan-tly, I love you like that
I was on fire for you
We could get it back again
If you don't say it's the end, the end!
So don't turn out the lights now, lights now, lights now!
Cause in a minute we'll be feeling like never before
We'll light up the night now, night now, right now!
I'll be whatever you need and more
So don't turn out the lights now
Don't turn out the lights now!
I'mma give you a minute to clear, clear your head
Take the rest of the night, yeah
You're gonna see that it's empty without me in your bed
Baby, you'll change your mind
Cause just when I think we're through
The memories come flooding back
And in-stan-tly, you love me like that
I still got this fire for you
We can get it back again
If you don't say it's the end, the end!
So don't turn out the lights now, lights now, lights now!
Cause in a minute we'll be feeling like never before
We'll light up the night now, night now, right now!
I'll be whatever you need and more
So don't turn out the lights now
Don't turn out the lights now!
We're down to the wire
(lets get high girl)
We gotta let go and take a chance
(Don't be afraid)
I'll take it higher
(Let us take you higher)
Till the end
Till the end
Till the end!
Yeah, yeah
(NKOTBSB BABAY)
HEY (C'mon)
Don't turn out the lights now, lights now, lights now
Cause in a minute we'll be feeling like never before
We'll light up the night now, night now, right now!
I'll be whatever you need and more
(Don't, don't, don't)
Don't turn out the lights now, lights now, lights now
Cause in a minute we'll be feeling like never before
We light up the night now, night now, right now!
I'll be whatever you need and more
So don't turn out the lights now
(Don't, don't don't)
Don't turn out the lights now
So don't turn out the lights now
(Woah!)
Don't turn out the lights now
(Gonna bring it down!)
