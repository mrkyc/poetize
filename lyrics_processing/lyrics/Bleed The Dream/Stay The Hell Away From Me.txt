I don't feel like i want you here anymore
I won't pay, and i won't steal
My dignity from your eyes
The whites of which
Have stared into more nights
Than i care to admit
A bit like lust, a bit like fear
I don't want you here
Don't you kiss me here
So take, take your plastic bags and go
Far enough so i will never know
How to find you when i'm in need
Stay the hell away from me
Okay i, i admit and i'll concede
That it might've even been me
That called you first and brought you here
Now i'm asking you to please leave
You've stayed too long
You've watched me bleed
And still you make me want more
One last kiss before you go
You might also likeI don't want you here
Don't you kiss me here
So now, just so that there's no mistake
I'm formally asking you to go away
I put my lips right up to your ear
And tell you you're not welcome here
So take your plastic bags and go
Far enough so i will never know
How to find you when i'm in need
Stay the hell away from me
Don't think that i don't know you've been with all my friends
I've seen the way it starts and i've seen the way it ends
First its just one bag and then you're slowly moving in
Lets stop this before it begins
Take, take your plastic bags and go
Far enough so i will never know
How to find you when i'm in need
Stay the hell away from me
Just so that there's no mistake
I'm formally asking you to go away
I put my lips right up to your ear
And tell you you're not welcome here
So take your plastic bags and go
Far enough so i will never know
How to find you when i'm in need
