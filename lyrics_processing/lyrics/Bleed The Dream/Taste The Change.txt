Sometimes these things just happen
Before you take it way too far
You gotta know that this will never happen I'm all alone Somebody Take Me away so What am I supposed to do
Where should I go
I need to find my way to you I hate feeling like this We always knew this night would come
But I could never give you up
So just go on lying
'Cause we can just pretend You always knew it was the right way I'm gonna make up for last time
I'm gonna make up for this
I'm gonna wake up and rewind You always had a way with words
In letters back and forth we'd send
Back when we were foolish kids
The world was only as big as a heart They're so dull
They'll only kill you one by one
So just go
Cause you know
I'll do it again and again The things we went through
And I wish I had another chancex2
But my feelings will never die............
So Close my eyes and count to 5 But words only reach so far,When I open my eyes Everyday Now and then
I look beyond the time Here I stand
Opening my arms
Hoping you would come
To free me
From the pain Oohh Oohh
But above all thisMaybe I'll never hearyou again Oohh..Maybe I need you to be here
I can't hold back no more my tears Maybe I need you to protect me from my fears
Maybe I need you when I fall
Maybe you'll hear me as I call Maybe I need you (by my side) Torn apart every single day
If only there's a way way wayyyyyyy Maybe could turn back time
And make everything right again
If only I'd be given another chanceI cannot take this anymore
Saying everything I said before
All these words they make no sense,Takes me one step closer to the edge, and I'm about to break! Wish I could find a way to disappear. Nothing seems to go away
Over and over again?
Just like before

Shut up when I'm talking to you!
Shut up (x3) Theres so many things
I didn't say
And even though
It may be too late I want you to know When I close my eyes and count to 5 When I close my eyes
Your all I see
In the dark of night
Your in my dreams
Through out the day
You're easy to find
You're always there
When I close my eyes In my mind I know
Your far away It's just me and you
Together again
It never ends
(chorus)
When I close my eyes
Your all I see
In the dark of night
Your in my dreams
Through out the day
You're easy to find
You're always there
When I close my eyes
Your always there
