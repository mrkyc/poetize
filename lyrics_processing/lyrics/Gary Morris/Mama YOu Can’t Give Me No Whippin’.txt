But even then as now, women were a weakness of mine
In grade school I was a mess just pullin' up some little girl's dress
Teacher would send me home from school, what a witch
Mama'd say, bad boy, go get me that switch
Mama, you can't give me no whippin'
Just for stayin' out all night
Mama you can't give me no whippin'
I'm old enough to know wrong from right
Mama, you can't turn me over your knee
It's embarrassing to a man like me
Mama, I think that I've got something that the girls like
Mama, I think I might have something that the girls like
I guess, I was about thirteen when this feeling came over me
I started learnin' how to talk the girls out of their virginity
I'd sneak 'em out into the light of the moon
Slip 'em up into my bedroom, mama'd catch us without a stitch
She'd say, bad boy, go get me that switch
Mama, you can't give me no whippin'
Just for stayin' out all night
Mama, you can't give me no whippin'
I'm old enough to know wrong from right

I remember celebratin' my eighteenth birthday
I started out on the town in the evening and I heard mama say
Boy, don't you be late, I rolled in about 4 a.m., didn't know
Where I was, where I'd been, rested mama with a belt in her hand
I said, hey, mama, your boy's a man
Mama, you can't give me no whippin'
Just for stayin' out all night
Mama, you can't give me no whippin'
I'm old enough to know wrong from right
Mama, you can't turn me over your knee
