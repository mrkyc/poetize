A decade of dancing dug into the boards
Every scratch, part of the story it tells
A pocketknife blade in my backyard tree
Two names in a heart for the world to see
Might be crude but it's a symphony
Of L-O-V-E
You got a melody, make 'em hear it
Shout it out loud and clear
'Til you rattle the walls of the atmosphere
Start right now, start right here
'Cause the world keeps spinnin' like an old Victrola
'Round and 'round, over and over
When the needle drops down, what you gonna do?
Life is a record, better cut your groove
Cut your groove
A lot of the time you're gonna be on top
But when you fall off the charts, don't let it stop you
'Cause part of the charm is the crack on a pop and a hiss
There's a song for the taste of your first kiss
A tune for the blues you feel when you miss
The one you love but can't be with
It's a crazy trip, it's a crazy trip
You might also likeYou got a melody, make 'em hear it
Shout it out loud and clear
'Til you rattle the walls of the atmosphere
Start right now, start right here
'Cause the world keeps spinnin' like an old Victrola
'Round and 'round, over and over
When the needle drops down, what you gonna do?
Life is a record, better cut your groove
Cut your groove
Don't matter what it is as long as it's true
It'll be unique to the story of you
You don't have to be famous, to be famous
A-side, B-side, let it all play
Don't let the music just fade away
You don't have to be famous, to be famous, no
You got a melody, make 'em hear it
Shout it out loud and clear
'Til you rattle the walls of the atmosphere
Start right now, start right here
'Cause the world keeps spinnin' like an old Victrola
'Round and 'round, over and over
When the needle drops down, what you gonna do?
Life is a record, better cut your groove
