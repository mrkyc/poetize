Bird and the egg are formed this way
Nothing quite like this to make me feel alive
Think back to the future past
Garden hose, green, green grass
Two years old, and a round bare ass in the bright sunshine
Now it's put on your pants, put on your shirt
Put on your tie, go to work
Keep wonderin' what I wear it for, ain't gonna wear it anymore
Take it off, take it off (woohoo)
Take it off, take it off (woohoo)
Get on down to your birthday suit
Who cares who's watching you
Take it off, take it off (woohoo)
Take it off, take it off (woohoo)
Nobody's stopping you so
Get on down to your birthday suit (ooh)
Get on down to your birthday suit (ooh)
Ooh, gonna feel so free, nature knows how it's supposed to be
And the good Lord knows there's no clothes on the birds and the bees
Yeah baby, don't be scared, ain't no shame in your underwear
One more step and we'll be there, just come with me

Take it off, take it off (woohoo)
Get on down to your birthday suit
Who cares who's watching you
Take it off, take it off (woohoo)

Ain't got nothin' else to do so
Get on down to your birthday suit (ooh)
Get on down to your birthday suit (ooh)
Hey, hey, hey, mm
Hey, hey, hey, mm
So to hell with the boss, to hell with the bank
To hell with brunch, to hell with the game
To hell with stuff I don't need
Long live love and long live freedom
Hell with the tie, hell with the shirt
Hell with the pants, hell with work
Hey baby we were born this way
It's how we procreate, hey hey, it's your birthday
Take it off, take it off (woohoo)
Take it off, take it off (woohoo)
Get on down to your birthday suit
Who cares who's watching you
Take it off, take it off (woohoo)
Take it off, take it off (woohoo)
Nobody's stopping you so
