You've never heard of a guy or a team on the scene that can flow like this
You've never seen anybody on the scene that can hold a track down like this

Every time when I write on a track it'll bang, blowing up in your bits
Every line that I write on the wax getting sang when it's up in the mix

Yeah
Yeah, I'm in this 'ting for life, fam
Most guys in the game are part-timers
That's why you might see me on the widescreen
These other guys you can catch for a fiver
You might see them in your high street jamming
8:28 working into these parts
Wanna first class in the VIP lounges
Chillin with your beats cause you're feeling me hot
Feeling me? Certain manaman are gazing
But it's over, they've got a bag of cash, sworn
Big fuss from him and the badda man ting
This crap from the can means all the wax gone
All your stacks gone, 
And that's what happens when manaman

Man, I come with the flows
Spit that fire, speak bars to your roast
I'm at large in the cell, a pro with the mic
I'm a  above most,  turn up on toast
See, many try but they never come close
Might boast the one flow, when I hit the booth
My approach is gung ho, I'm aiming to kill it
Tracks are out getting bare play at the minute
Man are killer, killer, certified rasta top biller
Other MCs small print
When it comes to the war ting, we move up the dance like a winner
Soldier straight out the war
We rap to retort, we come back with stacks, that's the sort
I come with the grammar, step to the 
Spread  man are getting bun in the manor
