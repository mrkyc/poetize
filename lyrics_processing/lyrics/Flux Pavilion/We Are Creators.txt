And I say
As we come at you straight with the facts
Well, we gon' do it just like this:
We have made it our purpose to scorn, scoff the principles for which we stand
But for the love the music, the love of my people
We have come together to party all night long

When you start to think about the gift of life
And find ways to cope with strain and strife
Sometimes you get the feeling for wheelin' and dealin'
The sweat of the hustle and the sweet of the bustle
Don't peel to be real with your lover deal
Which can bring you some charm, but do you some harm
Party people in the place, take it and break it
But I hope you realize, life is what you make it

All the people in the building, where you at?
In the front, in the middle, the side, and the back
As we come at you straight with the facts
We gon' do it just like this
We gon' do it just like this

The sounds that we use go hard, the beat match it
