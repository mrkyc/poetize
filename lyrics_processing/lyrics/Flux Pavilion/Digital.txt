Talk all the time
Said he'd been mine
I know he's lying
Watched him undress
Made him confess
Why does he care
But is he good
Look what you've made
I've gone and fallen
There's no more need
I know he needs
There is a secret
Nobody knows
You are a freak
I saw you wearing
You freak, you creep, you digital controller
You're like, that's right, my digital controller
You freak, you creep, you digital controller
You're like, that's right, my digital controller
You freak, you creep, you digital controller
You're like, that's right, my digital controller
You freak, you creep, you digital controller
You're like, that's right, my digital controller

Lookin for freaks want to be my craze
How many hits can you get today
Turns the lights off, fade away
Logging on to be center stage
Got a wife but you're in a phase
How many girls can you get today
Wipe the makeup and fade away
