Where the life just bleeds away from you
So here we are, so suddenly
Are your words so hard to find
Do the lies you told seem shameful
And you feel so cold
And you feel so cold
I've seen you cry your tears back for who
And I've seen you lost in thought, where do you go
And I've seen you forget I'm still here and so
I've seen you in everything that you try to keep from me
Truth, it was always far away
So here are, you turn again
And the path tread is hard to find
So here are, at war again
And your choice is clear to see
And your war has left no place for me
And you feel so cold
And you feel so cold
And you feel so cold
And you feel so cold
