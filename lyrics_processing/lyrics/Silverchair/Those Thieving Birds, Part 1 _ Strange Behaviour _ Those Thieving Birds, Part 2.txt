Those thieving birds
Hang strung from an empty nest
This swan plagued pond
Forsaken and under whelmed
Those leaving words
Hang strong from an emptiness
Hang strong from an emptiness
Those thieving birds
Hang strung from an empty nest

Those thieving birds...
Strange Behaviour

This is tearing me apart
If the sun won't shine
Forever will never be fine
Underneath the hollow ground
Lies a night time sky
For only a desperate eye
You might also like
When I'm paranoid I see walls behind walls behind walls
When I'm overjoyed I see falls over falls over falls
When I'm all alone I'll be wary and careful to
Only eat with uncles
Never talk to strangers
God is in the Kitchen
Faking baby dangers

Change whatever karma means
For the only things that end never truly begin

If this street's air ain't up to par
I'll take my clothes, I'll take this strange behaviour
Not only liked but loved as well
If this street's air ain't up to par
I'll take my clothes, I'll take this strange behaviour
Not only liked but loved as well

When I'm paranoid I see walls behind walls behind walls
When I'm overjoyed I see falls over falls over falls
When I'm all alone I'll be wary and careful to
Only eat with uncles
Never talk to strangers
God is in the Kitchen
Faking baby dangers
If this street's air ain't up to par
I'll take my clothes, I'll take this strange behaviour
Not only liked but loved as well
If this street's air ain't up to par
I'll take my clothes, I'll take this strange behaviour
Not only liked but loved as well

If this keeps tearing me apart
The walls come down won't stop this empty feeling
For everything apart from this
Those Theiving Birds Pt. 2

Lonely in life
Dead or alive
If the truth had incursions
No more goodbyes
No more big lies
If the truth had versions
As long as you and I are together
I'll hold onto the jewellery
Like staple strapped clenched fist and tongs

Hang strung from an empty nest
