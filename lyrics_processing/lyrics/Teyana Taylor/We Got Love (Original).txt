We got love, love, love
You better believe it (Say, love, love)
We got love, love, love
You better believe it

I got house and the carriage, yeah
I got black love in marriage, yeah
They gon' say, "You can't have it", but
I'm like, "Don't kill the messenger"
We gon' break the stigma up
Huxtables turned to Obamas
It ain't about where you been
Where you from, what you got, it's all about love
Self-love is the best love
When you gon' take that wristband off?
That pity party been over
Don't need makeup to dress you up
I gave birth on the bathroom floor
Just me, Iman, and headphone cords
Don't let this life defeat you
I hope this message reach you

Throw your hands up
Play catch with the hunnids
Love is the new money
I'm just chillin' with the homies, home is where the heart is
Throw your hands up
Play catch with the hunnids
Love is the new money
I'm just chillin' with the homies, home is where the heart is, ah

I live in abundance
Love is the new money
I'm mentally wealthy
Spiritually conscious
I'm fresh outta Onyx
I'm bawlin' and ballin'
I play with the hunnids
Love is the new money
That's my frequency
Spark up, burn the sage
Clear the room, kill the hate
Love is the new wave

Play catch with the hunnids
Love is the new money
I'm just chillin' with the homies, home is where the heart is, ah
Play catch with the hunnids
Love is the new money
I'm just chillin' with the homies, home is where the heart is, ah (Throw your hands up)
We got love, love, love
You better believe it (Throw your hands up, love, love, say)
We got love, love, love (Throw your hands up)
You better believe it (Throw your hands up, love, love, say)

Play catch with the hunnids
Love is the new money
I'm just chillin' with the homies, home is where the heart is, ah
Play catch with the hunnids
Love is the new money
I'm just chillin' with the homies, home is where the heart is, ah (Throw your hands up)

Throw your hands up
Throw your hands up
