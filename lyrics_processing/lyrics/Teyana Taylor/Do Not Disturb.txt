So I got this feelin'
You and I need a moment
I want you to love me, babe, make me know it
I need you to want me, babe, come and show it

Let me satisfy you tonight
Come inside, sit on my couch, oh
I know what you like, just sit back
Let me ride, hear it all out, uh

I want you right now
Not another minute later, so come on
Put your money where your mouth is
Give you what you paid for, come on
I know it's real, how my body feels on yours, oh
And I wanna spend some time
"No Enter" sign on the door, oh, no
Please don't disturb
Please don't (Don't, please, don't), disturb (Oh), no
