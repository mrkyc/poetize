Tonight I plan on fucking you to sleep
To, to, to put it deep
Baby, you know I'm a different type of freak (Yeah)
So what you tryna do to me?
Don't be shy, talk dirty to me
Now take a shot of Hennessy

Tell me what you want (How you want it?)
Ass up and face down with the loving
Baby, let me know when you need it
Four-course meal, chow down when you eat it
Make me curl my toes (Tell me)
What's the quickest way to turn you on?
I'm on it, middle of the night
Tell me what you want

Tell me what you want

Make you scream my name
I, I keep it nice and tight
Boy, relax and let me ride
Do the things we like, oh
To be the one, wanna see and feel the wood
I'm a nasty bitch so I'ma fuck it like I should
Know that you've been peeping I'm a savage
And the pussy good so if you want it, you could have it, yeah, yeah
Climb up on this dick, make it a habit, yeah, yeah
Fucking with a bitch that's never average, yeah, yeah

Yeah, tell me all the things you see in the kid
Is it me or is it just the life that I live?
Just tell me what it is 'cause I can make you feel (What is it?)
How he never did as long as you keep it real
And yeah, I know I'm young, but I'm old enough
I'ma stand in that pussy, have you folding up (Uh-huh)
Face down, ass up, girl, you know what's up
Eat it up, beat it up, make your toes curl up
I got no time to waste and no time to chase
Got to move at Christian's pace (C'mon)
Hold it down when it's all at stake
On your curves, girl, I'm slowing my brakes
No guarantees I'ma make it home safe
I'm so stuck in my ways, out of town for a couple of days
But when I'm back, I'll be right on my way
And I got nothing to say
No games, girl, you know my style
I got the recipe to make you smile, what?
Tell me what you want from me? (How you want it?)
Ass up and face down (With the loving)
Baby, let me know (When you need it)
Four-course meal, chow down (When you eat it)
Make me curl my toes (Tell me)
What's the quickest way to turn you on?
I'm on it, middle of the night
Tell me what you want
