I know you too well
Sounds like you're on your way
The highway's on your voice
Three exit signs away
You know how I think
I'll play it tough and cool
Try and shut you out
Like I always do

Then you knock, and you'll come in
If you come in, you'll sit down
If you sit down, I'll pour us a drink
And if we drink, then you'll be laughing if we laugh
We'll get closer, if we get close
We'll lose our clothes, and then we'll
Fall back in love for a while
We always go in cycles
On and on in cycles

We can't be together, sure can't be apart
Every last goodbye, is just another start
You gone and grab your things
And walk out the door
Say the hurt is over, and that we're done for sure
You might also like
Then you knock, and you'll come in
If you come in, you'll sit down
If you sit down, I'll pour us a drink
And if we drink, then you'll be laughing if we laugh
We'll get closer, if we get close
We'll lose our clothes, and then we'll
Fall back in love for a while
We always go in cycles
On and on in cycles

We're made for each other
Till we ain't made for each other

But then you knock, and you'll come in
If you come in, you'll sit down
If you sit down, I'll pour us a drink
And if we drink, then you'll be laughing if we laugh
We'll get closer, if we get close
We'll lose our clothes, and then we'll
Fall back in love for a while
We always go in cycles
On and on in cycles
On and on in cycles
On and on in cycles
I know you too well
Sounds like you're on your way
The highway's on your voice
