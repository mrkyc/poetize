You're better than the movies
I know how it ends, but I can't stop
Watching you ruin me like this
I heard you slip out the door
Heard you backin' out the drive at 10 out to 4
I bet your kiss on my lips
Knowin' it's the last one that I'll get

When I go high, you go low
Spill my dreams all down the road
Like a gypsy on the run
I'm all in and then you're done
You're a beautiful time waster
You're a shake my world, a quaker
You're the best heartbreaker I know
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

You're puttin' up pictures
You know, the ones I'm supposed to be in
You say I'll miss you
Then I never hear from you again
You got it down to an art
You watch me fall and disappear in the dark, yeah
You're a silent assassin, I can't stop it once it happens
You might also like
When I go high, you go low
Spill my dreams all down the road
Like a gypsy on the run
I'm all in and then you're done
You're a beautiful time waster
You're a shake my world, a quaker
You're the best heartbreaker I know
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

Why you gotta run, why you gotta run?
Why you gotta run, why you gotta run?

When I go high, you go low
Spill my dreams all down the road
Like a gypsy on the run
I'm all in and then you're done
You're a beautiful time waster
You're a shake my world, a quaker
You're the best heartbreaker I know
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Why you gotta be a heartbreaker, heartbreaker?
You're so good at breaking my heart
Yeah it's true, all you
You little heartbreaker
Oh, you little heartbreaker
You gotta be, gotta be, gotta be
So good at breaking my heart
