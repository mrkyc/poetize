Wall to wall, it's packed
Give your hands a smack
Polish up my watch
VIP is in the back
Hear the beat of the music playing
Rat pack, hi-hat swaying
I'll blaze it up and braise it
I'm saying

Just like the roof is on fire
So turn up the heat
All my friends are here
But the drinks on me
Pretty girls around
Everywhere you look
It's right on my face
You can say I'm hooked on
This crazy life I'm living
This crazy love I'm giving
Sit back, just watch, you'll see
You can try but you can't stop me
You can't stop me
No, you can't
You might also like
Oh no, the goose is loose
Just feeling up this groove
Don't it feel nice
Burning up these lights
Those green eyes, I've been watching
Got me all caught up and
The way your hips are talking
I can't stop it

Just like the roof is on fire
So turn up the heat
All my friends are here
But the drinks on me
Pretty girls around
Everywhere you look
It's right on my face
You can say I'm hooked on
This crazy life I'm living
This crazy love I'm giving
Sit back, just watch, you'll see
You can try but you can't stop me
You can't stop me
No, you can't
Bring the heat back
I could party with you, you could party with me
If you party with us, then you better believe
That the lights are up in this town
But they're about, about to go down
And it's about midnight
Oh, and I think she might
Told her to spin around, all around this town

Feels like the roof is on fire
So turn up the heat
All my friends are here
But the drinks on me
Pretty girls around
Everywhere you look
It's right on my face
You can say I'm hooked on
This crazy life I'm living
This crazy love I'm giving
Sit back, just watch, you'll see
You can try but you can't stop me
You can't stop me
