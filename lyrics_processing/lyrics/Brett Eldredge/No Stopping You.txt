Ever since you were a little girl
Your daddy told you, "you could run the world"
I knew it when we met that day
When you were sitting in the corner sippin' earl gray
You had the sweetest dreams in your eyes
That burn with the fire chasing sunset skies
As much as I wanted to hold you, I couldn't hold you back

There's no stopping you
'Cause your mind's set to
Where your heart says "go"
Go on, go girl, go
Hope you find me in a stranger's smile
Hope you hear me in the lonely miles
You gotta do what you were born to do
'Cause there's no stopping you

As you're looking out the window when you board a train
When you take a sip, do you say my name?
When you get lost on the silver coast
Will you stop for a minute and dance with my ghost?
In the flowers on the streets of Rome
Do you catch a scent of my cologne?
Just when I think you might wanna come back home
You might also like
There's no stopping you
'Cause your mind's set to
Where your heart says "go"
Go on, go girl, go
Hope you find me in a stranger's smile
Hope you hear me in the lonely miles
You gotta do what you were born to do
'Cause there's no stopping you

Sometimes I see you
When no one's there
And the wind blows through
Your golden hair
Whiskey burn
And the records spin
I pray that you'll come back again
But until then
Until then

There's no stopping you
'Cause your mind's set to
Where your heart says "go"
Go on, go girl, go
Hope you find me in a stranger's smile
Hope you hear me in the lonely miles
You gotta do what you were born to do
'Cause there's no stopping you
No stopping you
