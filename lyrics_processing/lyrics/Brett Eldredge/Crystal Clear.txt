Here I am
One flip flop and a farmer's tan
Floatin' 'round the bay on the net of a catamaran
Wouldn't mind if I got lost at sea
You can leave your watch
Don't you know we're on island time?
Everybody's in the business of feeling fine
Come on, get to feelin' alright with me

So come on and sail away
Why don't we take a break?
You can turn it all around
With a little sun on your face
Party all day and night
Future's lookin' golden bright
Trust me from way out here
The coast is crystal clear

It ain't about hate
Ain't about judging a book by its color
'Round here we're all sisters and brothers
Go and pass the love on down for me
And put your hand in mine
We can leave this crazy world behind
Dancin' with the moon 'til the morning light
Oh, don't it make you wanna sing?
You might also like
So come on and sail away
Why don't we take a break?
You can turn it all around
With a little sun on your face
Party all day and night
Future's lookin' golden bright
Trust me from way out here
The coast is crystal clear
Woo!

So come on and sail away
Why don't we take a break?
You can turn it all around
With a little sun on your face
Party all day and night
Future's lookin' golden bright
Trust me from way out here
It's crystal clear
So come on and sail away
Why don't we take a break?
You can turn it all around
With a little sun on your face
Party all day and night
Future's lookin' golden bright
Trust me from way out here
The coast is crystal clear
See it's not about where you are
It's about where you go in your mind
So if we just pull together, if we just love each other
Then life is beautiful
Come on and take a trip with me
Come on and take a trip with me
We're leavin' right now
I'll have one waitin' for ya
Let's go
Woah, sail away
Turn it all around
Party all day, party all night
Golden bright
