All I can do is try to drink you in
And do my best
To soak up all that sugar from your skin
But then you had to go and kiss me
You made me fall a little bit harder in this
Said you gonna have to miss me
Oh, what do you got to do that for your lips

Pressed to my lips
Oh, in my mind I keep
Replaying it
Over and over but that's how
I found that you're my favorite flavor
But all you left me was
Just a taste
Just a taste

I'd love to run my fingers through your hair
We could just pick up
Where we left off and start right there, hell I don't care
Oh, tell me what's your secret
Or how'd you get me going all crazy like this
And you got the touch and I needed
And I'm thinking you know that I can't resist your lips
You might also like
Pressed to my lips
Oh, in my mind I keep
Replaying it
Over and over but that's how
I found that you're my favorite flavor
But all you left me was
Just a taste

Now all I do
Is think about you all the time
But let me show you
That you never felt a love like mine
No you never felt a love like mine
All you left me was

Your lips pressed to my lips
Oh, in my mind I keep
Replaying it
Over and over but that's how
I found that you're my favorite flavor
But all you left me was
Just a taste, yeah
Just a taste, yeah
Back in my mind all the time
Just a taste
So good oh that sugar from your skin
Oh, I gotta drink you in
Oh, let me drink you in
