It happened on a Sunday
Outside and the sun was shining
That look on your face
Oh it hit me so hard inside
I could see how the light was fading
From your pretty blue eyes and
All I needed were the right words
But they were so hard to find

In a second my world changed
So fast that my heart was breaking
I wrapped my arms around you
And I just kept saying your name and
I put your hands in my hands
And we dropped to the floor board crying
At the moment your heart gave up on us

I told you
I'll bring you back, I'll bring you back
I'll bring you back to love, I will
Bring you back, I'll bring you back
I'll bring you back to love
You might also like
I kissed your tears all falling down
I said baby, you'll always be the one
I'm never going to turn around
You're all the life that I have in these lungs
We can all be skeptics
Never certain of what it is we want
All the fears we should confess
Holding our breath just dying to speak up

In a second my world changed
So fast that my heart was breaking
I wrapped my arms around you
And I just kept saying your name and
I put your hands in my hands
And we dropped to the floorboard crying
At the moment that your heart gave up on us

I told you
I'll bring you back, I'll bring you back
I'll bring you back to love, I will
Bring you back, I'll bring you back
I'll bring you back to love
I remember that night at your mama's house
We were so in love, finally said it out loud
I got down on my knees
Said you're the best thing that ever happened to me
You walking down the aisle, I remember it now
I remember your smile

I told you
I'll bring you back, I'll bring you back
I'll bring you back to love, I will
Bring you back, I'll bring you back
I'll bring you back to love

I'll bring you back to love
