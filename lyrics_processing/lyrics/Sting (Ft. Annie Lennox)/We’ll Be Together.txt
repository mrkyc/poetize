I see me with you and all the things you do
Keep turning round and round in my mind
Forget the weather we should always be together
And any other thought is unkind

To have you with me I would swim the sevens seas
I need you as my guide and my light
My love is a flame that burns in your name
We'll be together
We'll be together tonight

Is dancing here with you in my arms
Forget the weather we should always be together
Always be a slave to your charm
