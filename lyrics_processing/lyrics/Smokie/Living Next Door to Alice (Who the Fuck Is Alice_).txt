She said: "I suppose you've heard -
About Alice"
Well I rushed to the window
And I looked outside
But I could hardly believe my eyes -
As a big limousine rolled up
Into Alice's drive
Oh, I don't know why she's leaving
Or where she's gonna go
I guess she's got her reasons
But I just don't want to know
'Cos for twenty-four years
I've been living next door to Alice
Alice, who the fuck is Alice?
Twenty-four years just waiting for a chance
To tell her how I'm feeling, maybe get a second glance
Now I've got to get used to not living next door to Alice
Alice, who the fuck is Alice?
Grew up together
Two kids in the park
Carved our initials
Deep in the bark
Me and Alice

With her head held high
Just for a moment, I caught her eye
As a big limousine pulled slowly
Out of Alice's drive
Oh, I don't know why she's leaving
Or where she's gonna go
I guess she's got her reasons
But I just don't want to know
'Cos for twenty-four years
I've been living next door to Alice
Alice, who the fuck is Alice?
Twenty-four years just waiting for a chance
To tell her how I'm feeling, maybe get a second glance
Now I gotta get used to not living next door to Alice
Alice, who the fuck is Alice?
Sally called back, asked how I felt
She said: "I know how to help get over Alice"
She said: "Now Alice is gone
But I'm still here
You know I've been waiting
For twenty-four years"
And the big limousine disappeared
I don't know why she's leaving
Or where she's gonna go
I guess she's got her reasons
But I just don't want to know
'Cos for twenty-four years
I've been living next door to Alice
Alice, who the fuck is Alice?
Twenty-four years just waiting for a chance
To tell her how I feel, and maybe get a second glance
But I'll never get used to not living next door to Alice
Alice, who the fuck is Alice?
