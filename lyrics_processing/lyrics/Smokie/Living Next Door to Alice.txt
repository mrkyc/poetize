Sally called
When she got the word
She said "I suppose you've heard
About Alice"

Well I rushed to the window
And I looked outside
But I could hardly believe my eyes
As a big limousine rolled up
Into Alice's drive

Oh, I don't know why she's leaving
Or where she's gonna go
I guess she's got her reasons
But I just don't want to know
'Cause for twenty-four years
I've been living next door to Alice

Twenty-four years
Just waitin' for a chance
To tell her how I feel
And maybe get a second glance
Now I've gotta get used to
Not living next door to Alice
(Who the Fuck is Alice?)

We grew up together
Two kids in the park
Carved our initials
Deep in the bark
Me and Alice

Now she walks through the door
With her head held high
Just for a moment
I caught her eye
As the big limousine pulled slowly
Out of Alice's drive

Oh, I don't know why she's leaving
Or where she's gonna go
I guess she's got her reasons
But I just don't want to know
'Cause for twenty-four years
I've been living next door to Alice

Twenty-four years
Just waitin' for a chance
To tell her how I feel
And maybe get a second glance
Now I gotta get used to
Not living next door to Alice
Then Sally called back
And asked how I felt
And she said "I know how to help
Get over Alice"

She said "Now Alice is gone
But I'm still here
You know I've been waitin'
For twenty-four years"
And the big limousine disappeared

I don't know why she's leaving
Or where she's gonna go
I guess she's got her reasons
But I just don't wanna know
'Cause for twenty-four years
I've been living next door to Alice

Twenty-four years
Just waitin' for a chance
To tell her how I feel
And maybe get a second glance
But I'll never get used to not
Living next door to Alice
No, I'll never get used to
