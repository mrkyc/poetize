Well, I was out cruisin', getting late and I was losin'
When I saw you walkin' my way
So nonchalant, I bet you get what you want
So do I, and I ain't losing today

Well your hips were swingin', and your jeans were clingin'
You were drivin' me out of my mind
On a hot afternoon when there's nothing to do
You're not the sorta thing a fella should find

So I pulled on over, you tossed your hair off your shoulder
As you turned and you looked my way
Ah you would've died or you would've skinned me alive
If I'd have said what I wanted to say

So bein' polite, I said "whatcha doin' tonight?"
You said "it just so happens I'm free"
You got all the right curves and all the right words
And that's all right by me

Oh Carol, you got me eatin' my heart away
You got me countin' my nights and days
Oh I'm floatin' on the milky way
Oh Carol, nobody's done it before
Oh baby you've opened the door
Oh Carol you can do it some more

Well if you're ready for this, when we started to kiss
She said "hold on a minute or two"
Well naturally I knew it couldn't be me
I said "baby, what's troublin' you?"

She said "I'm not sixteen, if you know what I mean"
So we sat and we talked for a while
But when we finally kissed, you know she didn't resist
And I must say she did it with style

Oh Carol, you got me eatin' my heart away
You got me countin' my nights and days
Oh I'm floatin' on the milky way
Oh Carol, nobody's done it before
Oh baby, you've opened the door
Oh Carol you can do it some more

Alright!


Well, I was out cruisin', gettin' late and I was losin'
When I saw you walkin' my way

So do I, and I ain't losin' today
Oh Carol, you got me eatin' my heart away
You got me countin' my nights and days
Oh I'm floatin' on the milky way
Oh Carol, nobody's done it before
Oh baby you've opened the door
Oh Carol you can do it some more

Oh Carol, you got me eatin' my heart away
You got me countin' my nights and days
Oh I'm floatin' on the milky way
Oh Carol, nobody's done it before

Oh Carol you can do it some more

Oh Carol, baby you can do it some more
