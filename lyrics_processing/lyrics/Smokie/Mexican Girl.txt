Juanita came to me last night, and she cried over and over
Ooh Daddy I love you, you know, and I think it's the moonlight
She looked so fine, well she looked alright
And she moaned ooh daddy move over
Oh baby you know what I like, and I think it's the moonlight

Made in Mexico, schooled in France
Ooh la lovin' she needed no teachin'
Oh man I can say international ways I believe in

Mexican girl don't leave me alone
I got a heart as big as a stone
And I need you believe me
To be here and love me tonight
Mexican girl I want you to stay
You know my heart is longing to say
That as long as I live I will always remember
The one that I call, my Mexican girl

Her skin was soft as the velvet sky
And her hair it shone in the moonlight
As the music did play, well the night turned to day
And I held her tight

Then she looked at me with her dark brown eyes
And she whispered "hasta la vista"
I don't know what that means, but it sounded so good
So I kissed her

Mexican girl don't leave me alone
I got a heart as big as a stone
And I need you believe me
To be here and love me tonight
Mexican girl I want you to stay
You know my heart is longing to say
That as long as I live I will always remember
The one that I call

My Mexican girl don't leave me alone
I got a heart as big as a stone
And I need you believe me
To be here and love me tonight
Mexican girl I want you to stay
You know my heart is longing to say
That as long as I live I will always remember
