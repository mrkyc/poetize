(Ooo-ooo)
Don't play your Rock n' Roll to me
(Ooo-ooo)
That ain't the way it's meant to be
(Ooo-ooo)
I ain't so blind that I can't see
(Ahh-ahh-ah)
Just let it lie and let it be

So, don't play your Rock n' Roll, no
Don't play your Rock n' Roll, no
Don't play your Rock n' Roll to me
Ohh-oh

Well I know you think I'm crazy to keep hanging 'round
But I was sorta hoping you'd change from the girl I found
But your words just sound like rock n' roll lines to me
And they're just about as burned out as a worn-out 45
And you can't expect 'em to keep our love alive
Ohh-oh

(Ooo-ooo)
So, don't play your Rock n' Roll to me
(Ooo-ooo)
That ain't the way it's meant to be
(Ooo-ooo)
I ain't so blind that I can't see
(Ahh)
Just let it lie and let it be

So, don't play your Rock n' Roll, no
Don't play your Rock n' Roll, no
Don't play your Rock n' Roll to me

Well, I guess you had me fooled for a while
With your come on looks and your Mona Lisa smile
But your Rock n' Roll is gettin' out of time for me
Go sing your lines at someone else, 'cause someone else may be
The fool you always thought you saw in me
Ohh

So, don't play your Rock n' Roll to me
That ain't the way it's meant to be
I ain't so blind that I can't see
(Ahh-ahh-ah)
Just let it lie and let it be

Don't play your Rock n' Roll, no
Don't play your Rock n' Roll, no
Don't play your Rock n' Roll to me

(Ahh-ahh-ah)
Just let it lie and let it be
Don't play your Rock n' Roll, no
Don't play your Rock n' Roll, no
Don't play your Rock n' Roll to me

(Ahh-ahh-ah)
Just let it lie and let it be

Don't play your Rock n' Roll, no
Don't play your Rock n' Roll, no
