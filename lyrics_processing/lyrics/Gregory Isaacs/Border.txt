Then I would step across
So please take me to the border
No matter what's the cost, 'cause I'm leaving (Yeah)

This place could never be my home

Say we want, we want go home
That's where we want to go
Say we want, we want go home

Say we want, we want go home
Where the milk an' honey flows
Say we want, we want go home
