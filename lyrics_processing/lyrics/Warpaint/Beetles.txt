I'm not prepared, I just gotta gotta get there
Where am I? Why can't I just get it together?
Fuck it, where's my shit?
Oh my God, I'm mad at it
Oh my God, I'm mad at it

Oh my God, I'm mad at it
I wanna throw it out the window
I wanna throw it out the window
I wanna throw it out the window
I wanna throw it out the window
And here I go, hanging on
Nothing new, nothing new
Nothing and nothing and nothing
Oh no

Let's get naked and rip down the wall that makes me crazy
Tell me how
Someone hold my hand and give me lessons
'Cause I wanna melt the knot inside of it
I wanna melt the knot inside of it
I wanna melt the knot inside of it
I wanna melt the knot
You might also like
I'll never stay
Love is the only way out out
And oh, when I see you, I'm lucky
Waiting for silence to come
And take me down (down)
To see what you are waiting for
Why do I need the sound?
So slow
Hurt for me, please
I know that you want to
I know that you want to
Please tell me
Where you're hiding
Hurt me, ohh
Waiting for true love
To save this love
Break through fire

I'm not prepared, I just gotta gotta get there
Where am I? Why can't I just get it together?
Fuck it, where's my shit?
Oh my God, I'm mad at it
Oh my God, I'm mad at it
I wanna throw it out the window
Let's get naked and rip down the wall that makes me crazy
Tell me how
Someone hold my hand and give me lessons
'Cause I wanna melt the knot inside of it
I wanna melt the knot inside of it
I wanna melt the knot inside of it
