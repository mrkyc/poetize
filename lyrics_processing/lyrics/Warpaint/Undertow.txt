Your brown eyes are my blue skies
They light up the rivers that the birds fly over
Better not to quench your thirst
Better not to be the first one diving in
Though you caught me and you know why
You breathe in the deepest part of the water

What's the matter? You hurt yourself?
Open your eyes and there was someone else?
Now I've got you in the undertow
Now I've got you in the undertow

Why you wanna blame me for your troubles?
Uh, uh, uh, you better learn your lesson yourself
Nobody ever has to find out
What's in my mind tonight

Let tonight pass us by
Do you really wanna be the one to fight?
And I said, "You're better not to light that fire
It will take you to the darkest part of the weather"

What's the matter? You hurt yourself?
Open your eyes and there was someone else?
Now I've got you in the undertow
Now I've got you in the undertow

Why you wanna blame me for your troubles?
Uh, uh, uh, you better learn your lesson yourself
Nobody ever has to find out
What's in my mind tonight
Nobody ever has to find out
What's in my mind tonight
Nobody in my mind
Nobody in my mind

I feel it in my heart tonight

I lay on the floor
Pressing in my eyes, seeing little lights
Please light these decisions that only one can make
I wanted to stay home, but I went
Running, running, running, running from the troubles
Running, running, running, running from the troubles
Running, running, running, running from the troubles
Running, running, running, running, running, running, running, running, running
Running, running, running, running, running
What's the matter? You hurt yourself?
Open your eyes and there was someone else?
Now I've got you in the undertow
Now I've got you so

Why you wanna blame me for your troubles?
Uh, uh, uh, you better learn your lesson yourself
Nobody ever has to find out
What's in my mind tonight

I went running, running, running, running (I lay on the floor)
From the troubles (Pressing in my eyes)
Running, running, running, running
Running, running, running, running (Seeing little lights)
Running, running, running, running (Please light these decisions)
From the troubles (That only one can make)
Running, running, running, running (I wanted to stay home)
Running, running, running, running (But I went)
Running, running, running, running
Running, running
Running, running, running, running
Running, running, running, running
Running, running, running, running
Running, running, running, running
Running, running, running, running
