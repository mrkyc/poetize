Got caught up again in a moment, more than I wanted to
Once said I should've kept things all to myself
Now I say it loud as the words rain down
I can't find my way
I can't find my way
I thought I was done with you
I thought I was strong, I guess I was wrong
Once said I should've kept things all to myself
Now I say it loud as the words rain down
I can't find my way
I can't find my way
I can't find my way
I can't find my
I can't find my way
I don't like this, I can't take the fallout
I like things when there's nothing left to follow
And once said that I should've kept things before they fell, they fell, they fell
I don't like this, I can't take the fallout
I like things when there's nothing left to follow
So now I say it loud as the words rain down
Now I say it loud as the words rain down
You might also likeI can't find my way
I can't find my
I can't find my way
I can't find my way
I can't find my way
I can't find my way
I can't find my
I can't find my
Never again will I play that game with you
Thought I was done
Got caught up again in a moment
More than I needed (more than I wanted to)
More than I needed (more than I needed)
I took more than I wanted to
(More than I wanted to)
More than I needed (more than I needed)
I took more than I wanted to
(More than I wanted to)
More than I needed (more than I needed)
I took (more than I wanted to)
More than I needed (more than I needed)
Than I needed (more than I wanted, I wanted to)
Than I needed (more than I needed)
Than I needed (more than I wanted, I wanted to)
Than I needed (more than I needed)
