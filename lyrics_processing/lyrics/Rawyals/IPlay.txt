Im not gon be, not gon be basic
All up in these other hoes faces
I can tail you when I'm done here
I'm up on this game that you playin
I'm not gonna ask where you been
You're just gonna say with your friends
Is that the best you can come up with
Man this is some bullshit (ugh)

I'm not gonna lose any sleep at night
Instead i'll be doing me at night
I hope you don't think imma let you in
It's not a game but

Iplay (iplay) iplay (iplay)
I'm not gonna get into my feelings imma give it how i get it
Iplay (iplay) iplay (iplay)
I know there ain't no way to change ya, so thats how i gotta play ya. Now I think it's time I even out the score
Switchin up the rules I gotta clear the whole board
Iplay (iplay) iplay (iplay)
Even though I feel some type of way, iplay

Through thick and thin Imma rock, good luck tryna fill un my spot, good luck with that

And I ain't hurting no'more
Its just pain talking
Bottled inside and now its erupting
(Didn't even matter at all
The cards were beginning to fall)
See all of these tricks are for the kids baby

I hate the game but iplay)
