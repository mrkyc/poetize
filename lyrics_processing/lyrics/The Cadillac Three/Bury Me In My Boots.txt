Light a cigarette girl, lean on in and kiss me
Send me on my way with some black roses
This is the path I've chosen and you can't go with me
I got a "Bible Belt" buckle on sin-washed old blue jeans
Little scripture little liquor, sometimes a saint sometimes mean
I'll always love you baby and so that you just better believe
But that "pine box" clock is a ticking down on me
When I go, I wanna go out in style
Baby don't you cry, just
Bury me in my boots and don't forget the whiskey
Light a cigarette girl, lean on in and kiss me
Send me on my way with some black roses
This is the path I've chosen and you can't go with me
My hour glass was always half-empty
It's bound to be the bottle or the bullet that bit me
So when I go baby you know just what to do...
Bury me in my boots
And don't forget the whiskey
Don't dress me up like I'm going out on Saturday night
Invite all my rowdy friends to party and holler goodbye
When I'm walking into heaven I just wanna look down
And see a hell of a party down south

This is the path I've chosen, no you can't go with me
My hour glass was always half-empty
It was bound to be the bottle or the bullet that bit me
So when I go baby you know just what to do...
Bury me in my boots
And don't forget the whiskey
Oh, We're all gonna go sometime, yeah
When I go lay me down lay me down in style
Bury me in my boots and don't forget the whiskey
Light a cigarette girl, lean on in and kiss me
Send me on my way with some black roses
This is the path I've chosen, no you can't go with me
My hour glass was always half-empty

So when I go baby you know just what to do, oh I said, when I go baby you know just what to do
Bury me in my boots
