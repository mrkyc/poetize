This world don't care if I'm crying
So tell me, where does a broken man go?
I don't understand, I guess I'm kinda like my old man
Gonna live and die, just work with my bare hands
So tell me where does a broken man go?
I'm going down to the river, down to the river
That old muddy water gonna clear my mind
Down to the river, down to the river
And hope my troubles just float on by
Please, just float on by
When I was young, this world was just skipping stones
You could keep what you caught and take it home
So tell me, where did that world go?
At 21, that preacher took me back and dunked my head
I gotta get that feeling back again
He said Satan's trying to take my soul
I'm going down to the river, down to the river
That old muddy water gonna clear my mind
Down to the river, down to the river
And watch my troubles just float on
