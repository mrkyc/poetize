Well us boys, we ain't suit and tie
Like the young guns, hats and boots
Catch a cowgirl's eye
Oh, we came just for the party
We came for the girls that get naughty
We came cause we just wanna let it go
A little whiskey buzz through your radio

There ain't nothing wrong
If you want a knock-down, drag-out, go on let your hair down
Party on the farm 'til the rooster crows, yeah
From Skynyrd to The Rolling Stones
"Start Me Up" 'til "Tuesday's Gone"
Get your buzz on, get your buzz on
Get your buzz on, get your buzz right
Get your buss on, get your buzz on
Get your buzz on

We ain't done 'til the sun kills the fun
Yeah me and my boys drink with anyone
Oh, we came just for the party
We came for the girls that get naughty
We came cause we just wanna let it go
