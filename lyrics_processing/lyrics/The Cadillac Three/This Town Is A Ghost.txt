I see you in every truck that passes by
Louisiana tags, yeah, I pull over and cry
Oh, where did the time go? 'Cause your Rolex is still ticking
Oh, damn, it sure left a hole, it's like my heart went missing

This town is a ghost now
Feel like I used to know this city
Now I can't even go out
In every corner, there's a memory
Yeah, I ain't ever been scared of much
But man, I'm scared tonight
'Cause every bar, every beer, every song brings a tear
I'm here and you ain't around
This town is a ghost now

No, whiskey don't put out the fire, it just fuels the flame
And I know it ain't my fault, but I still take the blame
Oh, I can pick up the phone and call, but I can't hear you laugh
And I can punch through every damn wall, but that won't bring you back, no

This town is a ghost now
Feel like I used to know this city
Now I can't even go out
In every corner, there's a memory
Yeah, I ain't ever been scared of much
But man, I'm scared tonight
'Cause every bar, every beer, every song brings a tear
I'm here and you ain't around
This town is a ghost now

Size-nine box with my name written on the top
Took two weeks to open that pain
A pocket knife, Polaroids, bag full of dollar coins
A red bandana, and a sky full of rain

This town is a ghost now
Feel like I used to know this city
Now I can't even go out
In every corner, there's a memory
Yeah, I ain't ever been scared of much
But man, I'm scared tonight
'Cause every bar, every beer, every song brings a tear
I'm here and you ain't around
This town is a ghost now
This town is a ghost now
Oh, this town is a ghost now
