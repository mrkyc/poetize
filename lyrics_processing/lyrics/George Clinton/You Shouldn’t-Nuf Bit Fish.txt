Man, his nuclear fission
And the fish on his line
Is bigger in his mind
Than the reality of the reel
He has to reel it in
You shouldn't-nuf bit fish
Last one to get away
Is the catch of the day
You shouldn't-nuf bit fish
You took the bait
It's too late to pray
Now over you, they say the grace:
Lord bless this fish
Bring on the chill
Before we forget the spell
We bit the fish
Brother don't be so quail
Heads or tails
We ate the fish
We take the tempting bait
And don't matter about who is fishin'
Draw attention
And then we take the bait
We got to carry the weight a long time
Carry the weight a long time
Carry the weight a long time
Yo!

With a line attached to his mind
And a hook in his behind
Who do you suppose will bite?
And as the fisherman nodded
Are you sleek, are you sly, are you stoned?
Or are you fishin' for a song?
All these smelly fishy ain't fish
Oh! Somebody said "fish it's brain food"
Well I'm thinkin' about caviar (when we take the bait)
Fish eggs on brain (we got to carry the weight a long time)
Have a little sanity (carry the weight a long time)
Gonna raid your house
Saturday night fish fry
The Barracuda are still prime (when we take the bait)
Do you suppose he will bite (carry the weight a long time)
With the line attached to his mind
And a hook in his behind
Put up a good fight
Gimme line, gimme line
Give him time

Last one that got away
