DOIN' IT DOGGY STYLE
U.S. Custom Coast Guard Dope Dog, nicknamed "BUST EM"
Like most dope sniffin' dogs, he's got a habit, trained to have to have it
Pick up the tracks of the trafficker, and track em' like a rabbit up the coastline
Canine controlled substance retriever
Receiver of the "Golden Nose" award, for leadin' em' to the cash, cashin' in on the stash
Now he's in line for his issue of the booty
Never do a line in the line of duty, he's a dope dog
U.S. Custom Coast Guard Dope Dog
Keen sense of smell trackin the tell-tale trails of Cartels
Dope Boats, Big Dope
Never a gram or O.Z.. kilo too low key
Gotta be tons a "P" blow, bales of lumbo
When other dogs sniff at other dog's tails, he can track the profits from a dope sale straight to the stank account
Big banks, bankin' on laundering, the dirty money no stinkin' he follows his nose
And as the wind blows, he get a whiff, he take a sniff

Old Mac Uncle had some drugs, C.I.A. I-O
And with those drugs he bought some arms
C.I.A. I-O
It was a bang, bang here and a snort, snort there
Bangs and snorts everywhere
Old Mac Uncle starts a war, C.I.A. I-O
But the war on drugs is hell on Dope Dogs nose
It smells where the nose goes when the doors close and the dealer want to hide the dope
In the booty, in the twat
Then they squat and make the dog sniff their bowel
Foul, as they fart in his face
DAMN for a shitty half gram

Dope Dog-A Dope Dog
Out of the toxic waste comes a fox that wastes no time
A genetically improved smell capability, the long and dragging tales of the possibilities of "clone canine."
Conceived under the influence of toxic wasted doctors
Computer bugs debuggin' devices and vice verses and various viruses
And until his retirement don't mention, no requirement nowhere in his pension for the upkeep, the keeping up of the habit
The system have a habit of making sure you get, a habit that can't be kept up with unless you're a dope dog

An undercover NARC with a bark
He took a bite out of crime
Posin' as a seein: eye dog he bit the blind
The man with the cane in the coke
Soon as the dope boat float, the media goes comatose
Unrelated over-the-counter overdose now becomes drug-related
Aided and abetted by alot of apprehension and indifference
The bigger the headache the bigger the pill
Take your medicine cause you gonna be ill when I tell you the deal on dope
There's more profit in pretending that we're stopping it, then selling it
Selling out, we're in for the shock of a lifetime
Stop and we might find faces in primetime
The faces of yours and mine
Over the counter, under the counter
On account of the drugs:
It's not the drugs that drag you through the mud
It's the money. It ain't funny
