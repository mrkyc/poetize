Keep bringing me down
You always break my heart
Keep bringing me down, down
You always break my heart
Keep bringing me down
You always break my heart
Keep bringing me down, down, down
You don't really get a kick
Out of seeing me unhappy
Do you?
You always break my heart
Keep bringing me down
You always break my heart
Keep bringing me down, down
You always break my heart
Keep bringing me down
You always break my heart
Keep bringing me down, down, down
You get a kick out of kicking me?
Do you get a kick out of kicking me down?
You always break my heart
Keep bringing me down
You always break my heart
Keep bringing me down, down
You always break my heart
Keep bringing me down
You always break my heart
Keep bringing me down, down, down
You get a kick out of kicking me
Well?
You get a kick out of kicking me down
You get a kick out of kicking me
You get a kick out of kicking me down
Do you really get a thrill
When you cause me depression in your ear
You always break my heart
Keep bringing me down
You always break my heart
Keep bringing me down, down
You always break my heart
Keep bringing me down
You always break my heart
Keep bringing me down, down, down
I never knew that you
Would do
Such bad things to me
OH OH OH OH OH OH OH OH
