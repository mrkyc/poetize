Or play her like Play Dough
Cuz' she gon' say no
She like it hard
Hard as a rock
Hard as steel and still gettin' harder
Hard as steel and still gettin' harder
Her shit's got A heavy metal hard-on
Pussy posse pumped
To get its throb on
Eardrum bashin' sounds
Come crashin' down
From the dance band
On the band stand
To the dance floor
Encore
Hard up for more
Hard as steel and still gettin' harder
Hard as steel and still gettin' harder
And when she's thru
Off with the dude
She gave the backstage to
No Itsy Bitsy Pee Wee penis type
Of pecker poker pusher
Ever penetrating the pussy
She like 'em hung, young
A yard of tongue
Always givin' a five
For a job well done
You can't Silly Putty mold her in the pot
Or play her like Play Dough
Cuz' she gon' say no
She like it hard
Hard as a rock
Hard as steel and still gettin' harder
Hard as steel and still gettin' harder
Rock
We rockin' up a rockstar shit
You can't miss her with the faking the funk
Kind of popstar shit
She ain't wit' it
You can't Silly Putty mold me in the pot
Or play me like Play Dough
Cuz' I'm gon' say no
I like it hard
Hard as a rock
Hard as steel and still gettin' harder
Rockin' you between a funk and a hard
Place in between the place you are
And the place you wish to be placed
Funk 'em just to see the look on their face
Left to right face
About face, and etcetera!
Hump, bump, chump with a pump
That's hard to keep up with
Rock hard
If it ain't as hard as its gonna get shit
Put your hard-on the rock
Let me see what you got
If it's something hard
A few inches to a yard
Hard as steel and still gettin' harder
