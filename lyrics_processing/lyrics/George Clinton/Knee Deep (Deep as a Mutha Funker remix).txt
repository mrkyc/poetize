(She did the freak)
Never missin' a beat, yeah
(She did the freak)
Boy was it neat, yeah
Not just knee deep, she was totally deep
When she did the freak with me
(She did the freak)
Never missin' a beat, yeah
(She did the freak)
Boy was it neat, yeah
She did the freak
The girl is a freak, the girl never misses a beat, yeah yeah
But she was not just knee deep, she was totally deep
When she did the freak with me
She did the jerk
It didn't work, no
She did the monkey
It wasn't funky, no more
Chicken wasn't pickin'
But she was not just knee deep, she was totally deep
When she did the freak with me

She tried to work me, it did not work see
'Cause Humpty Hump's 'bout to go beserk
She tried to jerk me, Shock G said no
So let me let me floss 'cause here we here we go
Now I be the big nosed rappin' man
Funkin' 'em up with the brother George because I can
Money B getting sweaty on the knee deep
The freaky-deaky's wanna freak wit' him
It's the groove that Junie gavie us
Slapped you in the face with everlasting bass
The goobers of words coming out my face
Rise!
'Cause we's about to harmonize
I got the big brown nose
I got the big brown nose
I got the burgandy clothes
We're puttin' work in, we show up
And everybody stops and stares
We're gettin funky
And you can never ever get away from the man with the colored hair
I'm Money B
So turn up the CD
'cause knee deep will never ever go nowhere
So give us a pound 'cuase Digital Underground is out of here
(ah ha... yeah... like that
(Put it down for Uncle Jam)

(Round and round....)
(do be dee, do be do do)
(do do do-dee-do-do)
(do do do-dee-do-do)

Not just knee deep, she was totally deep
When she did the freak with me
And when she dance she sets the world on fire

(this funky music moved me, it grooved me)
