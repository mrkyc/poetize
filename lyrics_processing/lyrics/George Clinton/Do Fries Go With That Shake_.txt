Oh oh, oh oh...

Oh, I said the damndest things
Last night when I was runnin' games
I said "Baby, can I cut your cake?"
Oh, can I have it my own way
Don't I deserve a break today?
Them burns, I like the way you bake
Runnin' fever at a hundred and ten

He says that he possessed the beef
One quarter pounder just for me
A Whopper, that's sure to "satisfry"
He called me Legs McMuffin
And he ordered a kiss
I said I'll take a filet of this
Please don't fry it!
