But the entertainers didn't like the way you move
You'd have never pledged to yourself
That you'd become a dancer
By checking your steps you've found how to rock the groove
It's the close encounter of the funky kind
Close encounter of the funky kind
The funky kind, the funky kind
In the Hall of Fame she generated such a beautiful scene
She gone mad me too
OOH-AAH-OOH-TCHAA-TCHAA
OOH-AAH-OOH
She's got the look like a funky singer of Motown
She's gonna knock it down
Coming out of the blue, and I tear all that shit up
I'm here to get down
Her lipstick stained my long nose slacks
She said  I love you and smacked me
My mind was gettin' cracked
And I'm gonna knock it down
I'm gonna knock it down and tear it up
I'm gonna knock it down and tear it up
And when I get with it
I know you know just what I mean
I'm gonna knock it down and tear it up
I'm gonna knock it down and tear all that shit up
And when I do it
I'll be sticking to it like hot grits on Al Green
(The close encounter of the funky kind)
I'm gonna knock it down and tear it up
I'm gonna knock it down and tear it up
And when I get with it
I know you know just what I mean
I'm gonna knock it down and tear it up
I'm gonna knock it down and tear all that shit up
And when I do it
I'll be sticking to it like hot grits on Al Green
Heavy Metal, Hip Hop
Gangsta Rap oversamples of Doo Wop
Funkin' with rock chops, rockin' with funk chops
Only the weasel goes pop
(It's the close encounter of Starchild)
Only the weasel goes pop, only the weasel
Only the weasel goes pop
In the Hall of Fame she generated such a beautiful scene
Every night, after night
The Supremes send me crazy
As all Motown artists break my heart
Aretha Franklin, Marvin Gaye and Diana Ross
The Temptations, Otis Redding and Sam Cooke
Elvis, I do love you so too
You're gonna stay in my mind forever
Another component for T.A.P.O.A.F.O.M
To pick up of course, y'all
Communicating to the world with the stroke of my voice
I've got fever groove
And I'm driving you crazy with the words I utter out
From the cradle to the grave
Hey you, do a walk before I get angry
Yes that's what I've said, you know I get started
I'm bringing you aboard the Mothership
Therefore, I'm bringing you aboard the Mothership
Tonight, every night, after night
The Supremes send me crazy
As all Motown artists break my heart
Aretha Franklin, Marvin Gaye, Diana Ross
The Temptations, Otis Redding and Sam Cooke
Elvis, I do love you so too
You're gonna stay in my mind forever
(The close encounter of the funky kind)
Let them know
Tear it up, I'm gonna knock it down and tear it up
And when I get with it
I know you know just what I mean
Gonna knock it down and tear it up
Gonna knock it down and tear all that shit up
And when I do it
I'll be sticking to it like hot grits on Al Green
She's got the look like a funky singer of Motown
She's gonna knock it down
Coming out of the blue, and I tear all that shit up
I'm here to get down
Her lipstick stained my long nose slacks
She said I love you and smacked me
My mind was gettin' cracked
And I'm gonna knock it down
I'm gonna knock it down and tear it up
