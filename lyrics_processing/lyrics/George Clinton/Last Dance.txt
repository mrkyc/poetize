Oh let your eyes have followed her to the dance floor
Your heart has been dying to ask her for a dance
It's fair, your eyes began to grew
Your dumb mouth will not take the chance
Well are you some kinda psychedelic wallflowers
Why don't you walk right up n' ask her for her hand
Maybe she'll funk with you
Oh maybe she'll funk with you
So funky!
Oh let your eyes
Enjoy what your whole body craves to feel
Last dance
Last dance
I danced alone and never gazed in her direction
Maybe she'll get funky with you
It does not mean that we did not trade affection
Last dance
By a little degree I always be that open
Last dance
Yes you let your imagination sworn, hey
Last dance
Well are you some kinda psychedelic wallflower
Maybe she'll get funky with you
What are you, some kinda psychedelic wallflower?
Maybe she'll get funky with you
Maybe she'll get funky with you
What are you, some kinda psychedelic wallflower?
Maybe she'll get funky with you
Maybe she'll get funky with you
You might also likeNow them days and twisted bodies in your psyche
Maybe she'll get funky with you
Oh he's leavin' I'll pay sister
Last dance
You smartly hand you're not dreamin'
Last dance
Maybe she'll get funky with you, ah ah
The last dance
Oh, aren't you meant to be in joy heaven
It would have been, had you gotten with her
It's not so bad after all
It's not biorhythmic, psychoanalytically profound
It leaves lots of head room for sensivity
Maybe she'll get funky with you
May I have this dance?
OH LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA...
The last dance...
OH LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA...
The last dance...
Maybe the last dance
You see it's 2 o'clock in the morning
You see, the last dance, hey baby
Last dance
The last dance
Oh let your eyes have followed her to dance floor
Your heart's been dying to ask her for a dance
It's fair, your eyes began to grew
Your dumb mouth will not take the chance
Well are you some kinda psychedelic wallflower?
Why don't you walk right up and ask her for a hand?
