Uh-huh, AHH HAH! OOH YEAH!
Treat me bad, and I'll take it
Throw your ball I'll run and chase it
Fetch you the newspaper
Treat me good, I'll do you tricks
When you need, I'll catch a fix
Love me an' I'm in your favor
I said a dog is man's best friend!
I said a dog is girl's best friend!
Oh a fox, can be foxy
And brother wolf, he's the guy
Chased Red through the woods and ate grandma
But a dog is a dog is a dog is a dog
Unlike the wolf who made a widower of grandpa
I'm like a St. Bernard to you baby when you're lost out in the snow
I'll be like Santa Claus in the desert
Say you sho' can use some snow
Provin' dog is man's best friend

Ohh this sounds familiar
Make me stick my nose in there
And see who do I smell, ahahahaha!
You might also like
Oooh! Uh-huh, uh-huh, AHH HAH YEAH~!
Pat my back, pat my back
Pat my back, I'm contented
Watch my tail and I will wag it
Fetch you the newspaper
Extend your hand and I will lick it
Toss a stick, I'll run and get it
For just a bone I'll be forever in your favor
Standing guard in the yard

A dog is man's best friend  (Standing on guard)
A dog is girl's best friend  (Standing guard in the yard)
And don't forget puppy love!
And remember, my bite is rough
Much worse than my bark
An out of control dog, woof!
Tear the roof off!
{*long instrumental solo*}
Dog, is man's best friend, HIS BEST FRIEND!
Dog is a woman's best friend
I said dog, is man's best friend
Extend your hand and I will lick it
Toss the stick I'll run and get it
Just a bone I'll be forever in your favor
Standing dog in the yard, GUARRRD~!

Oh we keep turnin ya on, keep turnin ya on
We, keep turnin ya on
Hey hey, OWWWWWWWWWW!
