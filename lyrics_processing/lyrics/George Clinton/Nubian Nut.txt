Say follow follow they use their ears
Say follow follow then they use their minds
But when they follow your body
Then they loose their minds
Let me tell you a little story about King Nut
The natives call him the Nubian Tut
Out of 1407 he came to be somewhere around 2000 B.C
Well the natives clap for the Nubian sap
Then sit back and listen to the King Nuts rap
Do It!
Shaka do da Shaka do da Shaka do da
Shaka do da Shaka do da Shaka do da
I know you hitting be true
Knee deep in the jungle with the coconut groves
Where the tiger and the lion boogie with the rhinos
There's a tribe over here, there's a tribe over there
Drums beating funky rhythm, music's everywhere
Doing the Nubian Nut
Say follow follow they loose their ears
Say follow follow then they loose their minds
High high high
Doo doo doo doo doo
Shoo bee doo bee doo dow
Doo dow doo dow doo dow
You might also likeKing Nubian never got hot before a show
'Cause in the motherland they didn't wear too many clothes
People talk that talk, break out the camel walk
Then he wiggle through the jungle just as quick as a hawk
Then he grab his spear, then he grab his shield
Show all the native people just how good he feel
Doing the Nubian Nut
Say you got what you got gotten gotten goo ga got
Ho! doing the Nubian Nut
Say follow follow they loose their ears
Say follow follow then they loose their minds
Say follow follow then they loose their mouths
Late at night he'd talk his crap
While soaking his feet in some Nubian sap
He had a bone through his ear and one through his nose
The women in the tribe would massage his toes
Yeah!
When he asks you what's jumpin' it's the peas in the pot
They wouldn't be jumping if the water wasn't hot
Doing the Nubian Nut
Yeah follow follow follow follow
Follow follow follow follow
The people didn't know where the beat was coming from
But they knew it had to be another Nubian drum
King Nut is the future history
Somewhere around 2000 A.D
Holding up the shield that's a glowing green
Raising a spear that shoots laser beams
Riding in a spaceship up and down the street
Tooting at the fine women on the block he meet
Throwing down in studios track by track
Letting everybody know the empire strikes back
Another spaceship here another spaceship there
Here a ship there a ship everywhere a mothership
Landing in Detroit at United Sounds
Where all the funkateers like to boogie down
Because most of all we need the funk
Oh uh heh heh heh
Say follow follow they use their ears
Say follow follow then they use their minds
Say follow follow they use their mouths
But when they follow your body
Then they loose their minds
Follow follow follow follow
Follow follow follow follow
Shoo bee doo bee doo dow

Shoo bee doo bee doo dow

Shoo bee doo bee doo dow
