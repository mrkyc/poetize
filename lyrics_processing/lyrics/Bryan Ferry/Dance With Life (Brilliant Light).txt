One life's such a short time for love
When a match made in heaven arrives
Eternity is never enough
It's all been so simple 'til now
There's no brilliance like beauty out there
No knowledge as wise as the heart
We all need reason to care
I need to dance with life
Sweep you away into the night
When there is no one else around
I will make every day count
We need to dance with life
Swim in the soul of your eyes
'Til we melt into the night
We need to dance with life
And we leave a brilliant light behind
We could lay on the ground
We could look at that light in the sky
Show the moon and the million stars
The stars that we become when we die
You might also likeI need to dance with life
Sweep you away into the night
When there is no one else around
I will make every day count
We need to dance with life
Swim in the soul of your eyes
'Til we melt into the night
We need to dance with life
And we leave a brilliant light behind
It's no secret how I feel
This flesh and bone I love you is sealed
To cover me up and hide the deal
And the deal with me
To dance with life
Breathe the sweet fresh air
And make every second you're last
And I'll touch you from the world I wake in
Make the most of the present and the past
I need to dance with life
Sweep you away into the night
When there is no one else around
I will make every day count
We need to dance with life
Swim in the soul of your eyes
'Til we melt into the night
We need to dance with life
