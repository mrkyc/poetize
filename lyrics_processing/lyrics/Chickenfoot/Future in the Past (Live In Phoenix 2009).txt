This song's called the Future in the Past, it means a lot
It means a lot of things
But it's mainly about learning from your mistakes
Oh Lord, I made a few, Joe, how 'bout you?
Not tonight, you played perfect
Oh, help us out, it's real easy
Oh, oh, oh
It's all yours now, ready?
That's the Phoenix I know
C'mon, woo, give it up
One more, give it up, last one
Woo, that is sharp

I said, oh, watchin' them fall
Never hurt at all
One by one
They're falling from the sun
And melting down
Sooner hit the ground
Up so fast
The future's in the past

Oh, oh
The future's in the past
Oh, oh, woo, we got it
You might also like
I was thinkin' it's the real thing
Buckin' like a Mustang
We got everybody talkin'
Yeah, they talkin'
Said, "I got mine"
I got a funky, funky feeling
Somewhere in the past
Still everyday believin'
Yeah, I'm believin'
Saving the best for last
Saving the best for last, uh
I was saving the best for last

Mikey, I'm hearing voices
Alien voices
Ya- ya-ya-ya-ya
Ya- ya-ya-ya-ya, woo


The future's is the past
I'm gonna listen to the future, listen to the past
Let science be my church, the song that never ends, c'mon
The future's is the past
I'm gonna listen to the children, listen to my friends
Let science be my church, the song that never ends, c'mon
C'mon, c'mon
Yeah, come on
The future's is the past
The future's is the past
Now don't have to worry 'bout anything that's done
We each made of wax, get melted by the sun, c'mon
C'mon
The future's is the past
I'm gonna climb up on the mountain top, stand naked with the trees
Listen to the voice inside you and me, c'mon
C'mon, bring it on
