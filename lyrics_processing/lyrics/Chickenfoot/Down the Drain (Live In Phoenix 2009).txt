Uh, you know if things get a little rough Sam
If things get a little rough, you know what happens
Yeah, you know what happens
It all goes down the drain
You know this song, it started out as a jam session on day in the studio
And then we turned it into a song
Tonight we're gonna turn it back into a jam session for y'all, alright
Woo, give it up Mike

Sometime you gotta roll with it up front
Some things are better left in a closet
Some thing, just lay it on the table
Sometime gotta stop, gotta pause it
Yeah, oh, yeah
Well, she used to wake me up for breakfast
Force feed me with a silver spoon
Even do me when I'm dirty
We let it roll 'til way past noon
Yeah, oh, yeah

But all that's changed
'Cause it's all down the drain, yeah
You might also like
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Woo, oh Mike give it up

Yeah, love came and went like lightning
Just long enough to feel the heat
Felt like the ninth world wonder
Put the wings up under my feet

But all that's changed
My whole world's been shaken
And it's a low down, dirty shame
'Cause it's all down the drain

Oh, I need love first thing in the morning
Baby, last thing in the evening
I need love, baby, first thing in the morning
I need love, love, love, yeah
Ow, oh yeah
Yeah, baby
Satisfy me

All that's changed
My whole world's been shaken
It's a low down, dirty shame
'Cause it's all down the drain
Down the drain
Down the drain
Mikey give me somethin'
Down the drain, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Woo
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I need love, baby, I need love, baby, in the morning
I need love, baby, I need love, baby, last thing in the evening
Satisfy me, babe, oh
Show me love
In the morning, I need love
In the evening, I need love
Bring it on down, right on home
Oh, baby, I need love

In the morning, love
In the evening, I
Satisfy me, baby
