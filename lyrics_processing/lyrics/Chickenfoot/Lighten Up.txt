You could be makin' it easy
You know it pisses me off sometimes
When you, you start acting sleazy
I'm under so much pressure
You know there's not much blowin' up
Feelin' under the gun sometimes
Makes me feel like throwin' up, whoo
I said, oh baby
You're pushin' too hard
You're pushin' too hard
You say, lighten up, uh
Well, don't ask me no questions
And I will tell you no lies
We've been down that road before
And it's me, it ain't that other guy
And I never wanted to hurt you
I didn't mean to make you cry, yeah
But you always get what you want from me, don't you
With a teardrop in your eye
I said, oh baby
You're pushin' too hard
You're pushin' too hard
You got to lighten up
You might also likeYou're pushin' too hard
You're pushin' on me
You're pushin' too hard, baby
Lighten up
I like it when you want it
Especially when you take it
When you really, really need it
That's why I know you're not faking it, whoo
Hey, gonna call in a doctor
Maybe get you on some pills
But then I start to worry 'bout you, baby
Hey, could be the pill that kills
I say, oh baby
You're pushin' too hard
You're pushin' too hard
You got to lighten up
Oh baby
You're pushin' too hard
Lighten up
I said, oh baby
You're pushin' too hard
You're pushin' too hard
Oh baby
Come on, baby
Come on, baby
Lighten up, yeah
Oh baby
You're pushin' too hard
Oh baby
Baby, lighten up
Pushin' too hard
You're pushin' too hard
Pushin' too hard
Pushin' too hard, oh what you want me to be
I say, oh baby
Pushin' too hard
Oh baby, come on
Pushin' too hard
Baby, lighten up
