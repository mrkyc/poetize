All of my days
Been a certified hell hound
I changed my ways
Yeah, she crawlin' 'round the floor on her hands and knees
Rollin' on her back tryin' to show it to me
Long black hair swingin' outta control
All that temptation's messin' with my soul
Feel like Adam sittin' naked 'neath the apple tree
(I don't wanna go there)
It's like a forked-tongue serpent crawlin' all over me, yeah
(I don't wanna go there) Oh yeah
I've been a sinner
All of my days
Been a certified hell hound
I changed my ways
Smoke's so thick, you can cut it with a knife
She can make you real happy or ruin your life
All lubed up from her head to her toes
All this temptation messin' with my soul
Feel like Adam sittin' naked 'neath the apple tree
(I don't wanna go there)
It's like a forked-tongue serpent crawlin' all over me, oh
(I don't wanna go there)

A hardcore stripper workin' overtime
Spilled like honeysuckle drippin' from the vine
The last temptation, bitch is blowin' my mind
I've been a sinner
All of my days
Been a certified hell hound
Well, but I changed my ways
Now I'm runnin' outta money, I'm runnin' on rum
Waitin' on somethin' that's never gonna come
I'm slippin' in the darkness, slippin' outta sight
Gettin' outta here in the middle of the night
Like Adam sittin' naked 'neath the apple tree
(I don't wanna go there)
Feel like a forked-tongue serpent crawlin' over me, oh
(I don't wanna go there)
It's like a hardcore stripper workin' overtime
(I don't wanna go there)
It's like the last temptation, bitch is blowin' my mind
(I don't wanna go there)
Hey, hey, hey
I don't wanna go there
No, I ain't gonna go there
