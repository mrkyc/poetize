Maybelle (Ahem)
Are you gonna stay tuned like that for all the tunes that we're doing now?
Um, I may do the "Wildwood Flower" on the autoharp if y'all don't mind
I never recorded it on the autoharp
And I've done it with a guitar about a dozen times (Yeah)
But, um, and I do it in F standard, you know
And I'll probably do it in F standard key on the autoharp
And, um, "Thinking Tonight Of My Blue Eyes"
I'll have to do at the same place (Right there), yeah
And then, I don't know where we'll do, uh
"Will the Circle Be Unbroken" if everybody sings it
You just, you know, get the key that suits everybody
Maybelle, do you remember the old ending you folks put on that thing?
I know I started, on the old record, I started it like this

There's a dark and a troubled side of life
There's a bright and a sunny side too
Though we meet with the darkness and strife
The sunny side we also may view

Keep on the sunny side, always on the sunny side
Keep on the sunny side of life
It will help us every day, it will brighten all the way
If we'll keep on the sunny side of life

The storm and its fury broke today
Crushing hopes that we cherish so dear
Clouds and storm will in time pass away
The sun again will shine bright and clear

Keep on the sunny side, always on the sunny side
Keep on the sunny side of life
It will help us every day, it will brighten all the way
If we'll keep on the sunny side of life


Let us greet with a song of hope each day
Though the moments be cloudy or fair
Let us trust in our Savior always
To keep us, every one, in His care

Keep on the sunny side, always on the sunny side
Keep on the sunny side of life
It will help us every day, it will brighten all the way
