'Cause there ain't enough tickets sold
The air conditioner on the bus just broke
And I can't shake this cold
The single lost the bullet
The singer's losin' his wife
Well, I might be crazy but I wouldn't change
A single thing about this life
Sometimes we feel like champions
Sometimes we just can't win
Sometimes our records hit the top of the charts
Or the discount bargain bins
Through almost 20 years of touring
We've remained partners, brothers and friends
Well, we keep it together 'cause we're sure we're gonna be
Big time before it all ends
Just as long as Johnny's got his fiddle
And Jimmy's got his drums along
Then Jeffrey and me and Bobby will be
Singing all our favorite songs
Catch the fire from the folks in the front row
Fan the flames as the beat gets strong
It's great to be a part of something so good
That's lasted so long

Suddenly the band's big news
The critics all like our records just fine
But they seem a bit confused
Is it folk or rock or country
Whoa, seems like everybody cares but us
So just leave us an early wakeup call
So we don't miss the bus
Just as long as Johnny's got his fiddle
And Jimmy's got his drums along
Then Jeffrey and me and Bobby will be
Singing all our favorite songs
We'll catch the fire from the folks in the front row
Fan the flames as the beat gets strong
It's great to be a part of something so good
That's lasted so long
The band says it can't stand my latest song
It's too personal
But my first wife's second marriage blew up
They had to get the dang thing annulled
Well, if that ain't something to sing about
Well you tell me what is
And we'll give it a beat and put it on the street
And we just might have another hit
Just as long as Johnny's got his banjo
And Jimmie's got his harps along
Then Jeffrey and me and Bobby will be
Singing all our favorite songs
We'll catch the fire from the folks in the front row
Fan the flames as the beat gets strong
It's great to be a part of something so good
That's lasted so long
Yeah, it's great to be a part of something so good
That's lasted so long
