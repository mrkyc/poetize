To the mornin', my woman and love
And tall pine trees are pointing us easily
To heaven above
Blue spruce flaming on the grate in the evening
Takes the chill away fine
Cut the telephone line
And the story's the same
There's a worn red chair by the window
That we found at a sale down the way
When some old women said that they
Needed more room for the winter
But people like pulling out the stuffing when they sit down
And so it passes the time
Cut the telephone line
The story's the same
Oh, like a bubble on a windy day
I start to flutter when I hear you say
That you feel too good to go away
And you make me feel fine
And you made my world a warmer place
By the sparkling of your diamond face
On a frayed spot put a little lace
And you make me feel fine
Warm as the mountain sunshine
On the edge of the snow line
In a meadow of columbine

What you've got on your mind
It seems like most of the time
You're lying there dreaming
Maybe in your vision you see how our mission is
Slightly less than divine
You cut the telephone line
The story's the same
And now ripplin' waters flow through pipes
In the walls and they're keeping me warm
And the closest I've been to my family
For days is my music
But to silently stare in the morning sky
It's like hearing her calling my name
You cut the telephone line
And the story might change
Oh, like a bubble on a windy day
Start to flutter when I hear you say
That you feel too good to go away
And you make me feel fine
And you made my world a warmer place
By the sparkling of your diamond face
On a frayed spot put a little lace
And you make me feel fine
Warm as the mountain sunshine
On the edge of the snow line
