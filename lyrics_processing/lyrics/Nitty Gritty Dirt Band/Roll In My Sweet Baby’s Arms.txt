I roll in my sweet baby's arms
I lay around the shack till the mail train comes back
And I roll in my sweet baby's ...
Well, I ain't gonna work on no railroad, baby
Ain't gonna work on no farm
I'm gonna lay around the shack till the mail train comes back
And I'm rollin' in my sweet baby's arms
I roll in my sweet baby's arms
Roll in my sweet baby's arms
I come lay around the shack till the mail train comes back
And I'm rollin' in my sweet baby's arms
My mama was a beauty operator
Sister could sew and could spin
My daddy owned an interest in that new cotton ...
Just-a watchin' all that money rollin' in
I roll in my sweet baby's arms
Roll in my sweet baby's arms
I come lay around the shack till the mail train comes back
And I'm rollin' in my sweet baby's arms
Oh, I know that your parents they don't like me
They roll me away from your door
Help me find my life to live over
And I never go there no more
