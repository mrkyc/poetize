When things get to movin' and I gets to groovin'
Nightcrawlers all beware
I got a roundtrip ticket and I sing it like a cricket
And I think I'm halfway there
And I'm feeling kinda tipsy 'cause I bought it from a gypsy
With her hair down to her knees
Oh give it to your lover when you're feeling undercover
And you know you start to squeeze

(Spanish fly!) Bought it for a dime
(Spanish fly!) For a real good time
(Spanish fly!) To improve your luck
(Spanish fly!) Time to rack them up
(Spanish fly!) Just a tiny pill
(Spanish fly!) Make you lose your will
(Spanish fly!) Time to scream and shout
(Spanish fly!) Ain't no striking out

My body is shaking and my stomach is aching
But there ain't no turning back
All my head is quaking and I'm standing there naked
And ready to attack
And I'm feeling kinda tipsy 'cause I bought it from a gypsy
With her hair down to her knees
Oh give it to your lover when you're feeling undercover
And you know you start to squeeze
