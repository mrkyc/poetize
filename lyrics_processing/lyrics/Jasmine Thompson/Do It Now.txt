Silence is my worst, silence is my worst, my worst enemy
All I do is just, all I do is just revisit this memory

Cause you can't take back what you didn't say
If I could do it now, do it now, I would do it now
Cause you can't break promises you never made
If I could do it now, do it now, I would do it now

Oh, put your best suit on and carry on now
Oh, don't be fooled by how your life has turned out
Walking around in circles all day
Keeping your videos on replay
People will go, but feelings, they stay
Oh, if I had a second chance at love
I would do it now, do it now
Do it now, do it now
Do it now, do it now
Do it now, do it now
I would do it now, do it now
Do it now, do it now
Do it now, do it now
Do it now, do it now

Sorry doesn't work, sorry doesn't work
If it's a thing you say, every day
Feelings that come back, feelings that come back
Never went away, no they never went away

Cause you can't take back what you didn't say
If I could do it now, do it now, I would do it now
Can you give back the breath that you took away?
Won't you do it now, do it now, won't you do it now?

Oh, put your best suit on and carry on now
Oh, don't be fooled by how your life has turned out
Walking around in circles all day
Keeping your videos on replay
People will go, but feelings, they stay
Oh, if I had a second chance at love
I would do it now, do it now
Do it now, do it now
Do it now, do it now
Do it now, do it now
I would do it now, do it now
Do it now, do it now
Do it now, do it now
Do it now, do it now
Oh, put your best suit on and carry on now
Oh, don't be fooled by how your life has turned out
Walking around in circles all day
Keeping your videos on replay
People will go, but feelings, they stay
Oh, if I had a second chance at love
I would do it now, do it now
Do it now, do it now
I would do it now, do it now
Do it now, do it now
Do it now, do it now
Do it now, do it now
I would do it now, do it now
