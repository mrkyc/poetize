Hmm-hmm
Hmm-hmm-hmm
Hmm-hmm
Hmm-hmm-hmm

I can't control ya
Even though I want to
And you know it's torture
'Cause you brought someone new
And I can't ignore ya
Even though I'm trying to
I might need a doctor
So nervous next to you

Hell and hello
Yeah, those two words
Are oh so close
Oh baby, can you tell?
That I feel pain
I can't let go

I won't let you be someone's somebody
Can't see you with no one else
No, nobody, hmm-hmm
Someone's somebody
Should tell you that you can't leave this party
With her
You might also like
Hmm-hmm
Hmm-hmm-hmm
Hmm-hmm
Hmm-hmm-hmm

And I got some feelings
While you're holding hands right now
Know that I was healing
'Til you both came around
Don't you call her baby
Boy, you better watch your mouth
'Cause it's too soon, way too soon to say it

Hell and hello
Yeah, those two words
Are oh so close
Oh baby, can you tell?
That I feel pain
I can't let go

I won't let you be someone's somebody
Can't see you with no one else
No, nobody, hmm-hmm
Someone's somebody
Should tell you that you can't leave this party
With her
Hmm-hmm
Hmm-hmm-hmm
Hmm-hmm
Hmm-hmm-hmm
Hmm-hmm
Hmm-hmm-hmm
Hmm-hmm
Hmm-hmm-hmm

I bet you don't know how it feels to be me right now
And I bet you don't know what it's like to be talked about
Here, try and get me closure, have composure and be poised
It is hard to watch you leave 'cause I can't let you be...

Someone's somebody
Can't see you with no one else
No, nobody but me
Someone's somebody
Should tell you that you can't leave this party
With her

No, no, no, no, no, no
Ah-ah-ah-oh
No, no, no, not today
Oh, no, hmm-hmm
Oh, no, hmm-hmm
Hmm-hmm
