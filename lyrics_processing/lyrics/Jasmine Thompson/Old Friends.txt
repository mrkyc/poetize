People who matter don't mind
They don't need all of my time
Somebody told me to light up every room
Make them remember you
But nobody here knows what I'm going through
No, they never do

I miss my old friends
'Cause they know when I need them the most
I made some new friends and they're cool friends
But they don't know
What I do, what I got, who I am and who I'm not
I miss my old friends
I miss my old friends

I miss the good times we had
Now I don't know who's got my back
And somebody told me to light up every room (To light up)
Make them remember you (Make them remember you)
But nobody here knows what I'm going through
No, they never do

Oh, I miss my old friends
'Cause they know when I need them the most (When I need them the most)
I made some new friends and they're cool friends
But they don't know
What I do, what I got, who I am and who I'm not
I miss my old friends
I miss my old friends
I miss my old friends

Hey now, hey now
I know everybody changes
Hey now, hey now
I just want familiar faces
Ooh, hey now, hey now
Growin' up can be amazing
But it can even break your heart

I miss my old friends
When I need them the most
I miss my old friends
I miss my old friends
'Cause they know when I need them the most
I made some new friends and they're cool friends (I made some new friends)
But they don't know
What I do (What I do), what I got (Got, I got)
Who I am and who I'm not
I miss my old friends
I miss my...

(I miss my old friends, my old friends, I miss)
I miss my old friends
(I miss my old friends, my old friends, I miss)
What I do, what I got, who I am and who I'm not
I miss my old friends
