You keep promising me
That you're, you're gonna try
That things are gonna change
But when, babe, I'm on the edge of this
Don't make me jump, I wish
You'd give me more than this
But you don't

I'm so tired
Of asking you for
Attention
I need more
Than you're giving
So give it to me

I wanna know love
Wanna know what it feels like
I wanna hold it in my hands
'Til I truly understand
I wanna know love
Wanna know what it tastes like
Something bigger than I am
I'll make it something tangible
You might also like
Love, love
I wanna know love, love, love

If I wanted to leave
Would you come running after me?
Or would you let me leave?
Come on, babe
Would your perception change
Or will it stay the same?
Maybe you should do it
Maybe you should try it
Maybe I'll like it

I'm so tired
Of asking you for
Attention
I need more
Than you're giving
So give it to me

I wanna know love
Wanna know what it feels like
I wanna hold it in my hands
'Til I truly understand
I wanna know love
Wanna know what it taste like
Something bigger than I am
We'll make it something tangible
Love, love
I wanna know love
Love, love
I wanna know love, love
I wanna know love

Maybe you should do it
Maybe you should try it
Maybe I'll like it
Maybe you should do it
Maybe you should try it
Maybe I'll like it
Maybe you should do it
Maybe you should try it
Maybe I'll like it
So give it to me

I wanna know love
Wanna know what it feels like
I wanna hold it in my hands
'Til I truly understand
I wanna know love
Wanna know what it taste like
Something bigger than I am
I'll make it something tangible
I wanna know love
Wanna know what it feels like
I wanna hold it in my hands
'Til I truly understand
I wanna know love
Wanna know what it taste like
Something bigger than I am

I wanna know Love
I wanna know love
I wanna know love
I wanna know love
