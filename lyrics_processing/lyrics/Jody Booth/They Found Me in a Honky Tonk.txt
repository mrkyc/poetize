I was nine years old, I ran away
Mama and Daddy must've searched all day
They called the chief of police and the state patrol
They checked the skatin' rink and the swimmin' hole
Daddy stopped for a drink at the county line
Saw my bike propped up beneath a neon sign

And they found me in a honky tonk
Listenin' to a country song
Tappin' my sneakers and singin' along
Big ol' smile on my face
Sippin' an ice cold cherry Coke
While the waitress told a dirty joke
Somethin' about it made me feel at home
They found me in a honky tonk

Sent a hundred invitations out for the big day
Her daddy was there to give his baby away
She was standin' at the altar all dressed in white
But me and the ring were nowhere in sight
She gave the bouquet to the preacher, said "I'll be right back"
Took off draggin' them cans behind the Cadillac
You might also like
And she found me in a honky tonk
Listenin' to a country song
Tappin' my boots and singin' along
Big ol' smile on my face
Sippin' a Texas Crown and Coke
Tellin' the waitress some ol' dirty joke
First place she looked was my second home
They found me in a honky tonk
Aw get honky boys

Now when my time down here is over
And I've drank my last beer
When St. Peter calls my name out y'all, if I don't answer here

You'll found me in a honky tonk
Listenin' to a gospel song
Tappin' my boots and singin' along
To sweet Amazing Grace
Sippin' an ice cold cherry coke
Tellin' the waitress some ol' knock knock joke
If I ain't present when they call me home
You'll find me in a honky tonk
If I ain't present when they call me home
