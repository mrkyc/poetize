Oh, my reasons
And my ways
Keep on changing
From day to day
And as I grow
It becomes so clear
Why I'm here

It's all here
For you and me
The beauty of life
Someday you'll see
And then you'll join in
And sing along
And you'll understand why
I sing this song

Let me tell you now
I do love you, oh
I do love you, oh yeah
I do love you

Well I'm talking bout life (And living)
And the beautiful earth (And giving)
Talking about the natural things
We've had since birth (That's loving)
Well I'm talking about a walk in the country
About an angel's sweet charm
The smell of her perfume
And they're both coming on
You might also like
Let me tell you now
I do love you
I do love you, oh yeah
I do love you

Well, it's a beautiful day
And I'm on my way
Oh thank you, Lord, for the country

Well my thoughts
Are like ripples in a stream
I see myself so free
My eyes and spirit say hello
My soul goes dancing by
Oh, hello

The clean fresh air
Goes jumping through my head
The sun is smiling down
If you have ever lived out here
Then you know why I say
Ahhh
I do love you, oh
I do love you, oh yeah
I do love you

So come on, let's move
Out to the country
Whoa, let's go live out there
Let's get funky
Come on, people (Come on, people)
Yeah, let's be free (We got to be free)
Let's give up lies (Live in the country)
Give up greed (You and me)
Come on, people (Come on, people)
Oh, baby, good (Gonna have a good time)
Let's give up lies (You'll have a good time)
Race and sin (You got to be free)
