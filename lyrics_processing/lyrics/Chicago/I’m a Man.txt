Well my Daddy said I'm messy 'bout the whiskers on my chin
Never had no problems 'cause I've always paid the rent
I got no time for loving 'cause my time is all used up
I spend my time creating for some groovy kinds of love

I'm a man, yes I am
And I can't help but love you so
I'm a man, yes I am
And I can't help but love you so

If I had my choice of matter, I'd rather be content
Being closer to the chatter, showing where your mind is at
While relating to each other, how strong your love could be
'Cept for only sometimes groovy chicks you see

I'm a man, yes I am
And I can't help but love you so
I'm a man, yes I am
And I can't help but love you so
You might also like
I've got to keep my image, while I'm standing on the floor
If I drop upon my knees, it's just to keep them on my nose
You think that I'm not human, and my heart is made of stone
But I've never had no problems, and my body's pretty strong

I'm a man, yes I am
And I can't help but love you so
I'm a man, yes I am
And I can't help but love you so


If I had my choice of matter, I would rather be content
All engrossed in mental chatter, showin' where your mind is at
While relating to each other, how good your love can be
Resisting only some times groovy chicks you see

I'm a man, yes I am
And I can't help but love you so
I'm a man, yes I am
And I can't help but love you so
I've got to keep my image, while I'm standing on the floor
If I drop upon my knees, it's just to keep them on my nose
You think that I'm not human, and my heart is made of stone
But I've never had no problems, and my body's pretty strong

I'm a man, yes I am
And I can't help but love you so
Man, yes I am
And I can't help but love you so
Man, yes I am
And I can't help but love you so
Man, yes I am
And I can't help but love you so
