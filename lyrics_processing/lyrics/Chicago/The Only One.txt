What's been going on?
I've been trying to get through to you
Has it really been that long?
I've been thinking about you baby
And the way it used to be
There's so many things I wanna say
But will the words come out all wrong?
After all that's said and done
You're still the only one

You're the only one for me
I'm the only one for you
Baby, can't you see
You're still the only one?
Each and every night I pray
Hoping there will come a day
Baby you believe
You're still the only one

Got to find a way
To get back inside your heart again
If I let you walk away
I'd be dying without you baby
So I just keep holding on
Don't you know that we were meant to be?
But then I knew it all along (Ooh)
After all that we've been through (We've been through)
You're still the only one
You might also like
You're the only one for me
I'm the only one for you
Baby, can't you see
You're still the only one?
Each and every night I pray
Hoping there will come a day
Baby, you believe
You're still the only one

And the fire of our love
Keeps me running back to you
And no matter where you are (Where you are)
I will never be that far away

You're the only one for me
I'm the only one for you
Baby, can't you see
You're still the only one?
Each and every night I pray
Hoping there will come a day
Baby, you believe
You're still the only one
Ain't no need to wonder why
I'll love you 'til the day I die
Baby, I believe
You're still the only one
You're the only one
You're the only one
You're the only one for me, sweet baby
You're the only one
You're the only one
You're the only one for me, sweet darling
You're the only one (When times are rough and hard)
You're the only one
You're the only one for me, sweet baby
You're the only one (This is where I wanna be, yeah)
You're the only one (Oh yeah)
You're the only one for me
You're the only one (I am dying)
You're the only one (I, oh yeah)
You're the only one for me, sweet baby
You're the only one (With you is where I'll be)
You're the only one (Oh yeah, alright)
You're the only one for me (Ooh)
You're the only one
You're the only one (Yeah yeah, baby)
You're the only one for me, sweet baby (The only one for me)
You're the only one (Me)
You're the only one (Me, yeah)
