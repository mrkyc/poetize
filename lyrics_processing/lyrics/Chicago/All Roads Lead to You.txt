Headed north on a one way trip
I never thought I'd be back this way
I never thought I'd be missing you
Enough to suffer for the whole night through
Headed south and I didn't look back
I rolled the wind off the beaten track
Tried running from the thought of you
Haunted down by what I know is true

To the north, to the south
It don't matter
Every road leads to you
I'm coming home

All roads lead to you
Wherever I go
Every time I told you
I was just passing through
What my heart didn't know
Was all roads lead to you

Headed east on an Amtrak train
I hit the city in the pouring rain
I never thought I'd be calling you
Every hour from that hotel room
Headed west on a jumbo jet
I rode off into the red sunset
Stood there knocking on the devil's door
Wondering what the hell I'm searching for
You might also like
To the east, to the west
It don't matter
Every road leads to you
I'm coming home

All roads lead to you
Wherever I go
Every time I told you
I was just passing through
What my heart didn't know
Was all roads lead to you

All my life
The winding road I followed (The winding road I followed)
Has led me straight to your arms

All roads lead to you (Gotta get back to you baby)
Wherever I go (Oh yeah, yeah)
And every time I told you
I was just passing through
What my heart didn't know
Was all roads lead to you
(I'm coming home to you baby, ooh)
All roads lead to you
(Ah, I'm coming home)
All roads lead to you
(Never going away again)
All roads lead to you (Ah yeah)
All roads lead to you
All roads lead to you
(Gotta get back to you woman)
All roads lead to you
All roads lead to you
