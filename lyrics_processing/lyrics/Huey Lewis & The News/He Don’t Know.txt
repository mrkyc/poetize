But it's still mine
He took all the things that I loved best
But you still ain't got happiness
Gave you everything girl money can buy
He's a real big spender and a generous guy
You gave up on me, can't understand
Deep down inside girl, I'm still the man
Chorus
(He don't know what to do for you) He don't know
(He don't know what to do for you) He don't know
(He don't know what to do for you) But I do
You know I do....yeah
I passed your house today
I took it real hard
There was a brand new Mercedes
Parked right in front of your yard
He buys you things from A to Z
But no one, no one can satisfy you like me
(He don't know what to do for you) He don't know
(He don't know what to do for you) He don't know like I know
(He don't know what to do for you) But I do
You know I do
You might also likeYou had the world
But you wanted more
But nothin' can be better than what you had before
But you still got a chance to let him go
Gave you all of the best love
One man can give (check it out)
Girl, you're gonna feel it
Just as long as I live
Gave you all the love he could
But don't you know that
I spoiled you too good
(He don't know what to do for you) He don't know
(He don't know what to do for you) He will never know
(He don't know what to do for you) and I do
You know I do
(He don't know what to do for you) He don't know what to do
(He don't know what to do for you) for a girl like you
(He don't know what to do for you) he will never know
