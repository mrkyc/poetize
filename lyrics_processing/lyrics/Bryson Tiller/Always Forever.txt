Hold on, I'ma give it to you
I was just thinkin'
We started talkin' like two years ago, three years ago
Four years ago, somethin' like that, ah (Yeah)
It's two days 'til our anniversary, somethin' like that, oh (Yeah)
Uh-huh

Yeah, you know I tried to stop
Yeah, you know I tried
I tried to give you a little less of my time
Startin' to feel like I'm never in my right mind
In my right mind (In my right mind)
Is it the right time, babe? (Is it the right time, babe?)
See you in the nighttime, babe, it's nighttime
Wish you had feelings like mine, baby
Feels like I'm still just a homie (Homie)
Actin' like you don't want me, yeah (My God, do you feel me?)
No, shawty just don't do it for me (Uh-uh)
You do it for me (Yeah, uh-uh)

Yeah, say you're done doin' it for me, then say bye (Bye)
Say (Say) bye (Say bye, bye, bye)
Say-say now, girl, say bye (Bye, bye)
Say now, say goodbye (Say bye, bye)
Say goodbye

You know I tried, I really tried
Now you're right back on my mind
I feel the time just (Tick-tick-tick-tick-tick) passin' by
Thought this was always forever, so I'm askin'
Why would you lie to me, babe?
No, that ain't right to me, baby
You know I was here to stay
Ain't really got much left to say

Please, say you're done doin' it for me, then say bye
Say (Say) bye (Say bye, bye, you want me)
Say-say now, girl, say bye (Bye, why you just leave me?)
Say now, say goodbye (Say bye, bye, the memories)
Say goodbye (They haunt me, yeah, girl, I'm)

Overloaded
On all the memories and all the moments, yeah
When I look back to them, it's hard to focus
Oh, I like to imagine the time being frozen (Frozen)
Oh, don't tell no lies, you wasn't mine, but hit my line up
Why? 'Cause you was tired of somebody (Somebody)
I won't say his name, I'm simply tryna forget everything
Since you don't remember anything
