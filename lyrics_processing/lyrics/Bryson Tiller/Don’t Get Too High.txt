Okay, spend too much time with your friends
Too much time with your friends
Turned up at the function
You could barely function
Oh, you getting drunk and too high to call me up, and
Hanging with them other niggas, I could barely stomach
Oh, you telling me the shit you used to put up with
You ain't gon' go through that twice, okay
I'ma come through, spend the night, okay
1300 on the flight, okay
Love, you can't put a price on it
Something came up, girl, I know it
You don't never got time for me

'Cause you spend too much time with your friends, fuck y'all doing? Hey
Spending money on strip clubs and drugs, I knew it
They don't show you no love, not the same way I do it
I'm the only drug you need to get you through it
I always tell you don't get too high
Don't drink too much, don't smoke too much
Tell me if it's cool if I come by and keep you up
I show you love, I show you love

Girl, I'm not trying to kill your vibe, kill your buzz
I ain't tryna sober you up
Girl, I'm just trying to be by your side
And be the one that you saw first whenever you woke up

Woah, you make me feel how I make other bitches feel
Like you be cool without or with me here
Stuck in Miami, I don't know why I feel empty here
They say, "Don't bring sand to the beach, you'll see there's plenty here"
Seems like all I ever see is fake ass and fake titties here (Fake t*****, yeah)
And hoes looking for a come up and a nigga that's tricking here
Girl, I don't wanna be the nigga to give you dick and disappear
If you want me to, I could do you like I do women here
'Cause you spend too much time with your friends (Fuck y'all doing?)
