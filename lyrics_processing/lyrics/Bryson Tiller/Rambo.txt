Hol'on, hol'on, hol'on, hol'on
Hol'on nuh, hol'on nuh

Yeah, Rambo
They begging for mercy like the Lambo
Know they told me, "Kill them all," goddamn though
I know they want to see me fall, look where I am though
On two feet, that's where I stand though
I'm a true fucking killer like Rambo
No ammo, they see me on the Sanyo
Nigga, I just kill 'em because I can though

I'm as humble as they come, but you fucking with the wrong one
Boy, you fucking with the wrong one
This that new Pen Griffey, watch that nigga get a home run
Watch him hit it, that's a home run
I ain't playin' wit' you niggas, I'm a true Louis Villain
I'm the realest, they acrylic, fuck them niggas if they doubt it
Say I'm flippin' up, but so is a money counter
I've been getting up, 'bout to pay my self allowance
And I save it like the bell, I can't take no more L's
The day I sell my soul, that's the day I go to hell
Been putting on a show, just like Dave, I'm Chappelle
They ain't make it in the credits, I'ma tell them, "Oh well"
Tell Steve, don't let no more bitches in the hotel
Niggas gotta get to work, girl, unless you gon' twerk something
While I lay this verse on 'em
Damn, this lifestyle got a lot of perks on it
I'm just sayin' nigga (Young Tiller)

Yeah, Rambo
They begging for mercy like the Lambo
Know they told me, "Kill them all," goddamn though
I know they want to see me fall, look where I am though
On two feet, that's where I stand though
I'm a true fucking killer like Rambo
No ammo, they see me on the Sanyo
Nigga, I just kill 'em because I can though

This ain't temporary, I've been out here letting them know
New cat, years later, bet Sylvester Stallone
I've been working hard, I've been doing better, ya know
Peep the freeloaders, we won't be breaking bread with them, no
She chose me over him, cause he was so regular, oh
He was so regular, I'm like a butler getting this dough
I'm like a monster, or a motherfucking Predator
Oh-na-na-na, Soldier like Contra
I don't fuck with thotties, I pass her to my partner
All gold everything, bitch, I'm Fort Knoxin'
New sports car, man, I'm new Porsche coppin'
Two-door, hop in, girl, you know how I spend
And I been tryna budget my checks and the rest of my money, money
Rubber bands getting stretched with the hundreds, hundreds
M.V.P upper deck with the money, money
Don't I make the haters upset with the money
Bitch, I'm coming 'cause
This is not, this is not a, this is not a motherfuck-, a motherfucking game
This is, this is not, this is not, this is, this is not
A motherfucking game, why you playin' boy?
