Roll up through yo hood, yeah

Then I want you to strip

Hol', hol', hol' up
Freeze
Watch that boy come in with ease
You would not believe

Make you cum in yo jeans
Shawty so fresh she don't need Summer's Eve
Lose the joker and summon the king
Better hope I don't come in between
Dope dick will turn you to a fiend
Girl you better be careful
Yeah
If she don't take my advice
I just might
Pull the plug
Straight up why you acting like you so scared of him
