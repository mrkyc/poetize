Let's go

Gucci on my belt
Bought a necklace for myself
Bought Giuseppe for myself
Spent them blessings on myself
Donatello, that's that, (Killa) I smoke purple out the shell
She want Birkin, she want Gucci purse, she want Chanel, got it

I spend that cause I earned it for myself
Got my shawty out the way and now I'm splurging on myself
You should worry 'bout yourself, I've been working on myself
I've been balling like I'm Curry, need a jersey for myself (I need a jersey for myself)
What's next? I'm nervous for myself
If I changed, I became a better version of myself
Bought a chain, bought 2 more, yeah, I deserve that for myself
And my neighbors look at me like "How he purchase that himself?"
'Cause I'm a seven-figure, self-made nigga
Blow the money, get it back the next day, nigga (Made it back, yeah)
Wow, what the check say, nigga?
I'm getting paid, nigga
Need a chef and maid, nigga
