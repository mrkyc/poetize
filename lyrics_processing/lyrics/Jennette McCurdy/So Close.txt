You just keep tuggin', pushin', pullin'
On my little heartstrings
Got me all tied up in knots
Anytime I see your face
Oh, it brings out
It brings out the girl in me
Don't know just how you did it
But you got me real good
Hook, line, and sinker
Like I knew you could
But you don't even notice
Boy, I wish you would

I can't help myself
I can't help but smile
Every time I see your face
And we've never met
I bet you don't know my name
Am I out of my mind?
I think that I might be goin' crazy
'Cause my heart is yours to have and hold or break
How'd you get to be so close
When you're so far away?
You might also like
I think you might be close to perfect
Girls, you know what I mean
He's got a face straight out
Of a magazine
Gotta pinch myself
To prove he ain't a dream
Oh, oh, oh

I can't help myself
Now my secret's out
I can't help but smile
Every time I see your face
And we've never met
I bet you don't know my name
Am I out of my mind?
I think that I might be goin' crazy
'Cause my heart is yours to have and hold or break
How'd you get to be so close
When you're so far away?

I wish you were mine, all mine
Mine, all mine
I wish you were mine, all mine
I wish you were mine
I can't help but smile
Every time I see your face
And we've never met
I bet you don't know my name
Am I out of my mind?
I think that I might be goin' crazy
'Cause my heart is yours to have and hold or break
How'd you get to be so close
When you're so far away?

How'd you get to be so close
