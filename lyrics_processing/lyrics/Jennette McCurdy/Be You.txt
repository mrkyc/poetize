The cover of a magazine
Told me to be myself
But on that very cover of that magazine
Was some else
That someone else was peter
Don't call me crazy or something
But I feel sure I could securitate with him
If I was her
If I was her I wouldn't have a problem being me
If I was her and she was me
I'd be a better she than she
But I'm not her
I am me

 The moral of the story is
Be you, be you, be you, be you
Be the best, you that, you can be
Be you, be you, be you, be you
As long as you bestie was really perfect and also very pretty

So, what if you don't have this moment sign
You're gonna be fine
So, life is what you have in media
Make up for in the mine
But if I ask you a question
Or 2, or 3, or 4
And then determine what the rest of your life is based on your score
Oh, you don't mind
Hey, that's great
You must be smart
It must be fake
We'll party all night long
And then she'll walk in class and won't be late
Don't disagree with anything we say in class
But if you do
Go get a name and shove it up
Agree or disagree
Ask me anything and I'll tell you that the answer is why

 The moral of the story guys is
Be you, be you, be you, be you
Be the best, you that, you can be
Be you, be you, be you, be you
As long as your bestie is really perfect and also really smart

So what if you don't have the beauty of the brains
I have a good solution for you stupid ugly people
Hope it isn't late
People not look at you
And think of things that you know true
And don't expose yourself of lies you tell of someone
'Cause we all do that
Every morning, every night
We don't pretend the moral right
Every senate says it don't matter if you are black or white
Or to be fair
Any color as well

 I'm trying to tell you is
Be you, be you, be you, be you
Be the best, you that, you can be
Be you, be you, be you, be you
