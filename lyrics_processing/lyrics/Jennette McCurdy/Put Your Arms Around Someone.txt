Every single day, there's a million distractions
People come and go
Never know who they're passing
Sun's up, sun's down
Again and again
You can feel it in the air
You can tell something's missing
Might be a waste but, but if you listen
Our hearts are crying
Loud and clear
So why not start right here?

Just put your arms around someone
Never know whose waiting for a little love
It's not a waste of time
We got enough
So put your arms around someone
There's a whole lot of hurt going around
If you got a smile
Won't you pass it down?
It's going to mean so much
So go on go on and put your arms around someone
You might also like
You can make someone's day with a simple connection
Leave a little space for a new perspective
Who knows, never know what you'll find
Let your light shine, let it be contagious
Love always gonna be the remedy that saves us
Give it a chance, give it a try
It might even make you feel good inside

Just put your arms around someone
Never know whose waiting for a little love
It's not a waste of time
We got enough
So put your arms around someone
There's a whole lot of hurt going around
If you got a smile
Won't you pass it down?
It's going to mean so much
So go on go on and put your arms around someone

Feel the love
And don't be scared
To open up
Just put your arms around someone
Never know whose waiting for a little love
It's not a waste of time
We got enough
So put your arms around someone
There's a whole lot of hurt going around
If you got a smile
Won't you pass it down?
It's going to mean so much
So go on go on and put your arms around someone

Ohhhh
