You got a busted heart, you got a broken dream
Somebody tore your world apart on a rainy day
They didn't leave no note, they didn't leave no trace
Just a lump in the road and a look on your face

Well, don't give up, love is gonna find you
The feeling in your gut is there to remind you
Nothing good comes without a little pain

You got a brand new start, you got a real good heart
You got a smile, give it a while, it's gonna be okay
You're not the only one looking around, looking for someone
You gotta trust love, love is on the way

Well, you never known how the dice are gonna roll
So you gotta let me go, let 'em fly
You gotta dance with the truth, while you wrestle with the blues
You gotta wipe those lonely teardrops from your eyes

So don't you give up, love is gonna find you
The feeling in your gut is there to remind you
Nothing good comes without a little pain
You might also like
You got a brand new start, you got a real good heart
You got a smile, give it a while, it's gonna be okay
You're not the only one looking around, looking for someone
You gotta trust love, love is on the way


So don't you give up, love is gonna find you
The feeling in your gut is there to remind you
Nothing good comes without a little pain

You got a brand new start, you got a real good heart
You got a smile, give it a while, it's gonna be okay
You're not the only one looking around, looking for someone
You gotta trust love, love is on the way
