I just want to travel
I just want to roll up blunts, shake hands with the fans up front
I just want to travel
Summer winter fall spring seeing new places trying new things
I just want to travel
On the road with my homeboys broken down fans we pretending its a Rolls Royce
I just want to travel
I just want to see the world different parties different cities different weed different girls

Ayo I smoke like a Jamaican, drink like the fighting Irish
Every song is fire they twerking like Miley Cyrus
Sirens couln't stop me i'm wilding cash money piling
Styling on these rappers like im in the salon
And I kill beats when I speak never lose when I compete
The day I admit defeat is the day that my city sleeps
New York, where the best rappers were bred
It's a god damn shame the best rappers are dead
But wait Nas is alive, but wait I'm still alive
I turn the volume up high soon as I hop in the ride
I'm ground up produce it i write it record and shoot it
I do this in my sleep when you on the speakers they mute it
Nah he ain't a rapper  hes a fan
He deserves a grammy and actor
Show you a thing or two but you ain't beating your master
Drink a flask of jack daniels, couple of masked vandals
Forever burning spitting it hotter than wax candles
Never lost not once in the past
True boss everyday im smokin blunts with hash
Wheres the love and the lyrics, now its all about appearance
And bragging bout fuckin bitches I dont even want to hear it
Pacs spirits rolling eyes, Biggie turned in his grave
All thanks to Waka Flocka, Chief Keef and 2 chainz
Steady on my grind accumulating more buzz
Ima see the whole world on a tour bus

I'm real i'm not a pretender, Crispy like chicken tenders
Sweeter than fucking splenda, tear it up like blender
Yeah they call it love I call it infatuation
I'm back blazing, weed got me looking half asian
I'm young and dazed and confused , out here raising the roof
Boom pap write a rap and go insane in the booth
Cuz im cash motivated the lazy ones never make it
Im always chasing that cream cuz im money orientated
The washingtons go to wifey, tell her buy something shiny
Im grimy I need to double my cash grow my stash
Inhale take it easy , they all in awe when they see me
Dont give a fuck if i'm sleezy they foam at the mouth like Weezy
Im the best white rapper that you seen thus far
But fuck skin color regardless I go hard
Got the stage on fire, the fans arms tired
Until my voice expires i tell the crowd hoist me higher
I'm hungrier than a beautiful bride on her wedding day
All these critics thirsty ima serve them up some lemonade
Yeah that's dedication, because I live by the motto
No love for these hoes rib cage is hollow
Switch lanes full throttle, beat it up till they wobble
You could find me on the beach in mexico eating tacos
I just want to travel
