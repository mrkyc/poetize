Ayo, i'm Riding through the city in the Old School Q
And riding with me is the whole damn crew
Trying to get silly baby how bout you
You bring your biddies ima bring my dudes
Strap up them shoes baby we going to try something new
I Don't got much to do but waste my time with you
{Verse1}
I know theres not that much time in the day but it speeds right by time flies they say
When you're spending it with someone that you care about, your mom calls her phone asking for the whereabouts
Because you'd rather be with her than anybody else, Don't care for the fame or the money hell
Don't need a million fans or a ton of mail, and fuck a mansion put me up in Sunnyvale
Just leave my with her and leave that bottle of liquor ima make it just like the first time I kissed her
I want to look I want to stare I want to admire her, Because when we touch man I swear i'm seeing fireworks
Man she makes me wild she just moves so smooth, can;t help but to smile when she walks in the room
Think I might just die if I don't talk to her soon, Man I just had to cuff her like them officers do
{CHORUS}
Ayo, i'm Riding through the city in the Old School Q
And riding with me is the whole damn crew
Trying to get silly baby how bout you
You bring your biddies ima bring my dudes
Strap up them shoes baby we going to try something new
I Don't got much to do but waste my time with you

Think i'll die if I don't talk to her soon, I just had to go and cuff her like them officers do

{CHORUS}
Ayo, i'm Riding through the city in the Old School Q
