I love the way she moves, The way she moves her body
When she walks in the room, this girl can stop the party
And if I lose my mind, well that don;t bother me at all
Because with you by my side, girl we might rock but we won't fall
{Verse 1}
Uh, damn girl your phenomenal, when you walking by these guys are falling down like dominoes
I try to keep my cool and stay calm around you, I was lost but everyday i'm thanking god I found you
I've been looking for a girl like you, someone to keep it real around and share my views
She bring her own weed and she share them goodies looking cute as hell when she wear my hoodie
Uh
Everyday and everynight I've been up, thinking about my shitty day and how you brighten it up
Got me feeling dizzy like henny and ice in a cup, got a big old butt looking right in the front
I been, day dreaming straight fiending, when i'm with this little shawty I just stay cheesing
They might tell you that they love you but they don't mean it, girl ff your my drug them i'm ODing Fierce
{CHORUS}
I love the way she moves, The way she moves her body
When she walks in the room, this girl can stop the party
And if I lose my mind, well that don;t bother me at all
Cuz with you by my side, girl we might rock but we won't fall
{Verse 2}
You might also likeLiving too uptight, gotta come undone we can ride all night until the sun come up
Type of style to leave them all impressed, dress game short shoe game on fresh
She ain't like these other divas whining with an attitude, me and her can chill forever chatting kicking back a few
Brewskies, smoking watching movies I think i'll get used to this and do without the groupies
Baby we could ride, top down blunt lit, riding till road end talking about some dumb shit
You say i'm a good guy we having a good time, we the image of what a perfect couple should look like (look like)
Uh, I'm telling you its real girl, all eyes on us no real world
Anybody trying to step i'm putting up my fists, because I never thought that I would find a love like this

{CHORUS}
I love the way she moves, The way she moves her body
When she walks in the room, this girl can stop the party
And if I lose my mind, well that don;t bother me at all
Because with you by my side, girl we might rock but we won't fall

{BRIDGE}
I don't know If I can go much Longer Longer Longer
(Her eyes, her lips her thighs, her hips the way she kiss im high off this its her)
