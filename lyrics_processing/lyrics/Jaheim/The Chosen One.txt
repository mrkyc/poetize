Yea Yea
I choose you baby
Oh Oh Oh Oh
I choose you baby
Yeah

I can push that whip off a showcase floor
Put TV screens in the headrest or
Something a little more mature
Preparing for the future
Put the down on something
With a fence, a roof, and a door
Or the jewelry store
A pinky ring or ring for her (and)
Cherish her forever more what could be better?
Something for myself, or for my baby

All the places I can be
And people I can see
You're the only one for me
The decision was easy to make
I choose you over everything
You might also like
And I just wanna love my baby
I thank the heavens for the gift it gave me
Oh and I just wanna say
Oh Oh Oh just wanna love ya
There ain't a thing I wouldn't do for you
Changed my life so I could live it for you
(I did it all for you)

Camouflage get from the corner stores
Holding the dice tryna get a little more
Or something more secure
In the house cuddled up on the couch
With the woman I adore
Or in the streets steady breaking the law
Or creeping with my ex trying not to get caught
Or wifing you, ready yo die for you
Oh yea that's all I wanna do

All the places I can be
And people I can see
You're the only one for me
The decision was easy to make
I choose you over everything
And I just wanna love my baby
I thank the heavens for the gift it gave me
Oh and I just wanna say
There ain't a thing I wouldn't do for you
Change my life so I could live it for you

Out of all of the things that I been through
I'd rather be kicking it with my boo
When the pillow's not enough
And there's no one to cuff
I hit her up and she comes through
Can't no other chick compare to her
She can pull it off rocking Timbs and a fur
She's my class ghetto girl
And I wouldn't give her up for the world

And I just wanna love my baby
I thank the heavens for the gift he gave me
Oh and I just wanna say
There ain't a thing I wouldn't do for you
Change my life so I could live it for you
(And it's all for you)
And I just wanna love my baby
I thank the heavens for the gift it gave me
Oh and I just wanna say
There ain't a thing I wouldn't do for you
Change my life so I could live it for you

I choose you baby
Oh Oh Oh Oh I choose you baby
I choose you baby
