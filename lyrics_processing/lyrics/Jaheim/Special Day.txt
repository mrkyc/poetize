Breakfast when you wake
Along with the candle on a cupcake that I baked
Catering you is much of my oblige
Consider stress a mirage
You're the beat to my heart
Here's a rose with no thorns on the stem, you're a gem
You're the reason why I've, found one hundred ways to
Adore you three times a day, morning, noon and night
It's for you

Today's a special day for you
These are a few (These are a few, these are a few)
Things I'd like to do for you
Today's a special day for you, baby
These are a few, (these are a few, these are a few)
Things I'd like to share with you
(Now, now, now, now, baby)

I'm a fool for love today, honest I'll do
Anything you need me to, uh-huh
From sunrise to sunset on this ordinary day
You can have it all your way
That's my job, you're a heartthrob
Love's the reason why I got it, set you before me
So we can see what it's like, morning, noon and night
It's for you
You might also like
Today's a special day for you
(These are a few, these are a few, these are a few)
Things I'd like to do for you (Would you like that, yeah)
Today's a special day for you
(Today's a special day for you)
(These are a few, these are a few, these are a few)
Things I'd like to share with you, baby

It doesn't matter what the weather is, oh no
From this point on I'll share with you the break of spring
An angel kissed the day we fell in love
So to you, the sweetness of, out there, my love
Just because, oh yeah, yeah, yeah

Today's a special day for you
(These are a few, these are a few, these are a few)
Things I'd like to do for you
Today's a special day for you
(Today's a special day for you)
(These are a few, these are a few, these are a few)
Things I'd like to share with you, baby

- What you wanna do, baby?
- I don't know
- Think about it
- I'm thinking
- Think about it
- I'm thinking
- Oh, oh, I'm a fool for love today
Honest I, honest I, honest I
Honest I'll do anything you want me to
Today's a special day for you
(These are a few, these are a few, these are a few)
Things I'd like to share with you
