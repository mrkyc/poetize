Have you ever been in love?
Well, well, well

Yo, things was all fine when the sun would shine
But when the rain came, that's when the pain came
Sittin' up in the Range, she feel some kinda way
She doin' strange thangs, but I ain't with the games
Keep it a secret, yo, it's cheaper to keep her, bro
Two wrongs don't make this right, but we equal though
It's gettin' better though, and I can't sweat her though
I love her but I can't let her know
I can't let her go

She was five-foot-four from the floor
Prettiest little thing I've ever seen before
Her body was so tight, she had her hair done right
But who shorty with tonight?
I got that big boy sittin' outside
All I need to know if she'd mind if I took her for a ride
I couldn't wait to meet her
On that first date to treat her
I just wanna to please her

So we jumped in the Range (Jumped up in the Range)
Baby started actin' strange (So strange)
Her attitude began to change (Oh, oh)
As it began to rain (It began to rain)
Shorty started to complain (Oh yeah)
About every single thing (Oh, every time)

Every time I think about her (Every time I think)
I can't make up my mind (Oh no no no)
But it's hard to explain (So hard)
Just the way I feel about her (Ooh ooh ooh)
But I tell you what I know (Tell you what I do know)
Brown sugar love me real slow (Hey)
Now, I don't care what my friends say (I don't care)
I just can't let her go (Just can't let her go)

Two years go by
(I'm) tryin' to find a reason why
(I) always seem to make you cry
(I) just don't know why
Well, could it be, you always runnin' in the streets?
Come home from work ain't nothin' to eat
Your stretch your little dough runnin' home for more
Then you straight back out the door
Somebody tell me, baby
Even though we fuss and fight
(Even though we fuss and fight)
Cussin' all through the night
(Cussin' all through the night)
She's in my arms all the morning light
(We wake up then make up)
Even though she gets on my nerves (Ooh)
She take shit that she don't deserve
(Tell me what's a woman like that worth?)
(Tell me)

Every time I think about her (Baby, every time)
I can't make up my mind (Oh, no no)
But it's hard to explain (Yes, it is)
Just the way I feel about her (How I feel about her)
But I tell you what I know (Tell you what I know)
Brown sugar love me real slow (Ooh)
Now, I don't care what my friends say (I don't care)
I just can't let her go (I don't care, no)

Now, I finally realized, you're like heaven in my eyes
I took a long time, I apologize
Even though at times you messed up
Shakin' your ass up in the club, that's messed up
But you're quick to hit the block when the crib get hot
When my dough get low, you be holdin' me up
But I'm still out here chasin'
Out here baby makin'
What a brother gotta do?
Uh, yeah, money is nothin'
Whatever 'Kiss wants gon' get purchased
House so high in the hills phones don't get service
Just listen, even though we be riffin'
Without you around I think things would be different
And not for the better neither
My friends tell me I better leave ya
I tell them to get some better cheeba
Yeah, we gon' make it pop, ma
But you shakin' your ass in the club gotta stop, ma
Get my 'gnac, get my dutch
When I'm fallin', I need you to be my crutch
And we could just take it from there
And see if the love can overpower all the hate in the air, yeah

Every time I think about her (Every time I think)
I can't make up my mind (Oh no no no)
But it's hard to explain (So hard)
Just the way I feel about her (Ooh ooh ooh)
But I tell you what I know (Tell you what I do know)
Brown sugar love me real slow (Hey)
Now, I don't care what my friends say (I don't care)
I just can't let her go (Just can't let her go)

Hey, something she should know
I don't ever wanna let her go
But if she keeps on with the movements
She gon' make me lose it
And I hope that she can see
That I'm down for her, but is she down for me?
Whenever in need I make sure she eats
