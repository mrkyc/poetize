Morning, morning, morning

She sippin' on a drink, that's when I start to think
Look at that body and gotta go so hard in the paint
Pardon me, Miss Thing, diggin' your shoe game
What's your name? Nevermind, tell me all about it in the (Morning)
Open the blinds, I could cook you breakfast
Slip in a quickie one more time before we exit
It's not a spa, see - wanna take a ride with me?
What's your name? Nevermind, tell me all about it in the (Morning)

Girl, can you hang? Take your time, go slow
Make love 'til the middle of the (Morning)
I know you're wondering if I'm the type to quick heat the sheets
And get you out by the (Morning)
Do you look fresh, air-brushed magazine?
I'm tryna see if you pretty in the (Morning)
Girl, can you keep me calling
Coming back for just another, another, another (Morning)

We going non-stop, that's the alarm clock
I hit the snooze, reached for my shoes before my socks
Late for my interview, getting it in with you
Shadows on the wall, candle wick burning it into the (Morning)
I got your body on my mind and I'm tryin' to focus
But it's hopeless, baby you're so freakin' fine
We're texting freaky messages and countin' down the time
Until we find ourselves, together making love until the (Morning)

I ain't tryna come up, 'til the sun up, get done up
Stay one up on you, no keyboard
Touching on you, lotion I'll be rubbing on you
Get you, get you feeling good, keep it harder than some wood
Get Ginseng, you know I could
Get it in and tell me when you getting there so I can share
The same smile on my face when we arrive at the same place
Same time, you'll get yours, I'll get mine
All before the crack of dawn
Do it 'til the morning

Let's make love all night until the morning
Breakfast in bed then get you wet in the morning
Then we'll go shopping, hit the mall in the morning
And wait for the world, put it in churches and then maybe, lady
From here, we'll get married in the morning
Then I'll get you pregnant, nine months, have a baby in the morning
Even when cussin' and fussin' and fightin'
You just kissing me, hugging me, girl
Then make love in the morning, girl

Girl, can you hang? Take your time, go slow
