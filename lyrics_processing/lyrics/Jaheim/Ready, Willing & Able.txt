Baby, I'm ready and willing 'cause I'm able
To satisfy your fantasy
Baby, I'm able (Able) and willing (Willing) 'cause I want it
You can get just what you need

For one, I'm a young man
And I'm taking the time to do things right
Keeping you satisfied all through the night
Twice I've let you slide
I just wait for the ride
And I didn't put pressure on you
I stood by your side, oh

I just wanna let you know that I'm ready
To do all the things you want me to
Yes, I am, baby, oh, oh yeah
And if you don't mind
Baby, let's take it easy tonight
Let's slow it down to my pace
Lovin' all up in you face 'cause I'm ready

Baby, I'm ready and willing 'cause I'm able
To satisfy your fantasy (I, I wanna satisfy you, baby)
Baby, I'm able (I'm able) and willing (And I'm willing) 'cause I want it
You can get just what you need (Oh yeah)

Now wait a minute, baby
Slow it down to my speed (Slow)
Haven't I always given you
Everything you need (Ah yeah)
But now it's time, girl
To lay it all on the line
I don't wanna get fast with you, baby
I spend too much time
Just trying to get to know you better
Sent you flowers with a lovely letter (Lovely letter)
Take you out to dance, all that romance
Do those things you like
Stood right by your side
If you wanna make it right, girl
Just let me inside of your world
I'll never let go
'Cause I wanna show
You all I have in store

Baby, I'm ready and willing 'cause I'm able
(I'm ready, baby)
To satisfy your fantasy (Oh, oh yeah, yeah)
Baby, I'm able (I'm able) and willing (And willing) 'cause I want it
You can get just what you need

I'm lying here waiting, my dear
You can get what you want every time youu need it
Whenever you're ready, baby, yeah
I'm lying here waiting, my dear
You can get what you want every time you need it
All you gotta do is take my hand, take my hand, take my hand
