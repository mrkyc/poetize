You!
Alright, alright
I've been, I've been
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh no, oh no

Ten after eight, I'm running late
I jumped in my ride headed down the west side
I picked up the phone, is my shorty home?
See I saw you in the club last night and you were looking rather fine
As fine as wine, you blew my mind
And I was hoping that we'd get together tonight
Girl I really don't wanna sound conceded
But I'm the type of guy you need to be with
I've been...

Looking for love in all the wrong places (Yeah yeah)
Been around seen a lot of pretty faces (Awe yeah)
But I know that I'm the one for you
Only lying I would do is in the bed with you (Girl you've got me feenin')
Cause, you've got a brother feenin'
And baby you know what I'm needing (Baby you know)
Girl I hope that you are soon to see
That you and I were meant to be, baby (Check it out one time)

Now here we are, flossing in my whip
Things are getting heated time I get a grip
I can't play myself, won't lose my cool
See I refuse to let you down like those other fools did
I only wanna give you what you're missing
Good love when you want, is what I'm giving babe
Now, if it's cool with you, it's alright with me
Let's take this back to the way love's supposed to be
Cause I been

Looking for love in all the wrong places (Oh)
Been around seen a lot of pretty faces (Well well)
But I know that I'm the one for you
Only lying I would do is in the bed with you (You know I wouldn't lie to you baby)
Cause, you've got a brother feenin' (Baby you know)
And baby you know what I'm needing (Awe yeah)
Girl I hope that you are soon to see
That you and I were meant to be, baby (Alright)

Got what you want, I've got what you need
Been looking for somebody to put down on my team now
Baby girl you got me flippin' out
So full of trauma won't you tell me what it's all about

Could've bounced on you girl, but your ass is too fine (Too fine)
