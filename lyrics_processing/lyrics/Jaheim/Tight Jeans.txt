You've been looking real good lately, making me fiend
I know we're friends, but listen up
You can't be coming around me in tight jeans, making me weak
I think you really trust me too much

You and me been cool since back in middle school
Like when we used to clown and run around and act a fool
Now that we're older I've been noticing you bustin' out those jeans
Never seen that coming up, think you know what I mean
When other niggas tried to holla, had to let 'em know
Told 'em none of y'all ain't good enough, the truth be told
'Cause when I first figure out what love was I was a youngblood
And you've always been that treasure
We've always been together

You're not that little girl I once knew anymore (Yeah yeah)
I will see you fitting your clothes so well, I can tell
(Ooh ooh ooh, look at you)
You're not that girl from junior high school, that's for sure
(You're not the girl from junior high school)
You're changing the rules now that you're fine as hell

You've been looking real good lately, making me fiend (Oh yeah)
I know we're friends, but listen up (Listen here)
You can't be coming around me in tight jeans, making me weak
I think you really trust me too much
You might also like
Now there you go again on my lap
Thinking that I'm in control and I won't react
When your form has grown so phat
'Bout time you know for all that it's worth
You're killing me softly in those Prada tops and mini-skirts
Hots just puttin' work
All up in my face, girl, what did you think
That I'd stop being a man when you came on the block
Showin' your promised land
On the back of that bike, showin' just what I like
And a woman, if you get it, you had it coming, girl

You're not that little girl I once knew anymore
(You're not that little girl anymore)
I will see you fitting your clothes so well, I can tell
You're not that girl from junior high school, that's for sure
You're changing the rules now that you're fine as hell
(You're so fine)

You've been looking real good lately, making me fiend
I know we're friends, but listen up (Listen up here)
You can't be coming around me in tight jeans, making me weak
I think you really trust me too much (Much too much, too much)
You've been looking real good lately, making me fiend
I know we're friends, but listen up (Baby looking real good, yeah)
You can't be coming around me in tight jeans, making me weak
I think you really trust me too much (Oh yeah yeah)
You've been looking real good lately, making me fiend
I know we're friends, but listen up (Yeah yeah yeah)
You can't be coming around me in tight jeans, making me weak

I know you trust me too much, girl (Girl, I know)
You really trust me too much
I think that you trust me, but too much, girl
I know you trust me to much (Yeah yeah yeah)
I can't take it no more (Take it no more)
Gotta let it be known (Got to let it be known)
I've been watching you (Ooh)

And I wanna hey hey hey hey
Feel you and put my hands on you, girl
