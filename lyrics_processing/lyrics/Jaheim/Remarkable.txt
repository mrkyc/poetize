I know I wanna spend my life with you
I wanna spend my life with you
You're so remarkable

I never quite told you, baby
How much you meant to me?
From first sight, that first night
I knew instantly
That you'd be the one for me
Deep down in my heart, baby, oh yeah
Iceberg fit and Wallabees
Sat by me real casually
Asked you if you'd like a drink
Instead you offered one to me
Got the number to the crib, cell, J-O-B
Couldn't believe you'd even talk to me
And all I can say, ooh

Your love is so remarkable
Everything about you from head to toe
(Head to toe, yeah)
Baby girl, you're so incredible (Incredible)
I just had to let you know
(Know know know know know, yeah)
Your love is so remarkable (Ooh, ooh)
I never wanna let you go
(No, no) (Can't let you go) (No no no no)
If you left I'd be so miserable (Oh yeah)
You're good for my heart, my mind, my soul
You make me whole
You might also like
Girl, I know I done put you through some things
But I love you more each day
And that ain't never gon' change, no (No)
If you ever left me, nothing would remain
You're part of me, no, you're all of me
Girl, I'm on my knees, holding this here ring (This here ring)
And I'm beggin' please spend your life with me, yeah
'Cause all I'll ever need to survive is right here in my life
'Cause your love is so remarkable

Your love is so remarkable
Everything about you from head to toe
(All from head to toe, baby)
Baby girl, you're so incredible (So, so)
I just had to let you know
(Your love is so remarkable)
Your love is so remarkable (Never gonna let you go)
I never wanna let you go
If you left I'd be so miserable ('Cause you are)
You're good for my heart, my mind, my soul
You make me whole

There's always sunshine when you're around
It's like my feet don't even touch the ground, ooh
How my heart begins to pound
On one knee I will go down
Grab your hand and tell you now
You will always be all that I'll ever need
Much more than my baby or an angel heaven sent to me
Once was blind but now I see
Never let your love get away from me
Will you marry me?
Ooh, I will
Your love is so remarkable
Everything about you from head to toe
(Girl, I wanna spend my life with you, oh oh)
Baby girl, you're so incredible
(Girl, you're so incredible) (Yeah)

(Girl, I had to let you know)
(I had to let, to let you know)
Your love is so remarkable

Your love is so remarkable
(Diamonds, girl) (A little bit of platinum, too)
I never wanna let you go
(Ain't enough cheddar in this world that I wouldn't spend on you)
If you left I'd be so miserable
(Tell me, tell me you'll marry me) (Ooh, yes, I will)
You're good for my heart, my mind, my soul (Ooh)
