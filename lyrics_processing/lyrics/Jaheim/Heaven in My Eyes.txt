Yeah, I'ma take this one here to the streets, baby
Feel me?
Oh

When I look in your eyes (I can see it in your eyes)
Can't believe you're mine, (No, no, oh no)
Let's just take our time (Baby, let me take my time, ah yeah)
Your love's just like heaven in my eyes

Chillin' in the parking lot deep
Hit her, we meet on 21st Street, what
You know how we lounge when the weekend roles around
That's how we put it down
Listen now
You we're on your way to your car
You don't like them thugs that be hangin' in the bar
Lookin' so cool, but casual, fly, sexual, Miss
You know I had to back this girl

When I look in your eyes (I can see forever, baby)
Can't believe you're mine (Out of all the lovers in the world)
Let's just take our time (Ain't no doubt, ooh wee baby, yeah)
Your love's just like heaven in my eyes
You might also like
It's hard on the boulevard, ice shinin' hot
In your baby blue drop (Oh)
Puttin' weight on them haters, baby (Yeah)
You're the baddest girl on the block
Had all the hustlers open from the park to the weed spot (Weed spot)
But they don't know your style
All the things I do, girl, are worth my while
I'll be the man that'll spoil you
With diamonds galore, a ring with a stone
A child and a home, girl

When I look in your eyes (Oh, I can see forever, baby)
Can't believe you're mine (Out of all the lovers in the world)
Let's just take our time (Ain't no doubt, ooh wee baby, yeah, yeah yeah)
Your love's just like heaven in my eyes
When I look in your eyes (I can see forever, baby)
Can't believe you're mine (Out of all the lovers in the world)
Let's just take our time (Ain't no doubt, ooh wee baby, yeah, yeah)
Your love's just like heaven in my eyes

Ain't no doubt about it (Oh no)
I just can't get around it (No)
And every time i think about it (Yeah, yeah)
Your love is like heaven in my eyes (Heaven)
Ain't no doubt about it, (Girl, there ain't no doubt about it)
I just can't get around it, (No baby, no baby)
And every time i think about it (Yeah)
Your love is like heaven in my eyes (Heaven in those eyes of yours)
When I look in your eyes (I can see forever, baby)
Can't believe you're mine (Out of all, out of all the lovers)
Let's just take our time (Oh oh, ain't no doubt, ooh wee baby, yeah)
Your love's just like heaven in my eyes

Ain't no doubt about it (Your love, your love)
I just can't get around it (No)
And every time I think about it (Your love, your love)
Your love is like heaven in my eyes (Your love)
Ain't no doubt about it (Your love, your love)
I just can't get around it (Your love)
And every time I think about it
