Verse
It's killing me softly with every heartbeat
Thinking you can't see how your sons living
(Hey mama) Is there an address up in heaven
I feel like dropping you this letter but it will be return to sender
How I wish I could bring you home flowers on tombstones
Lets me know it's been too long since I've been in whose arms
(Yours mama) It's getting colder every winter
I can't take the heat in summer, can't hardly deal with all this drama but
Chorus 1:
(Just when) I'm inches away from losing my mind
(That's when) I swear sometime
(I hear your voice inside my head) and it feels like you're
(Everywhere, everywhere I am)
(Just when) the walls are closing in on my world
(That's when) I see my favorite girl
(Clear as day inside my head) and it's obvious you're
(Everywhere, everywhere I am)
Verse 2
Was that you saying just keep on praying
You'll see the day when it'll be worth the waiting

Think how I'm receiving blessings Finally got the platinum record
Did you see me on Soul Train dedicated the whole thing
To your memory just hoping you're out there and knowing

If God is in the spirit world talking to my heart
Then for an angel I know it can be hard
You are my guardian and I know you're still playing your part
(I know you are) Just on the other side but always in my life
No need to just believe I know you're here with me
I'm reaching out my hand and to the promise land
To feel your presence when I need strength
Everywhere I am, Everywhere I am
I know that you're watching
Everywhere I am Everywhere I am
I know that you're watching, over us, yeah
Everywhere I am Everywhere I am
Mama I know, yeah, yeah, yeah
Everywhere I am
Watching me
Everywhere (repeat)
I can feel it in my soul
Everywhere (everywhere) everywhere (everywhere) everywhere that I am
I know you're there
Just when (just when I'm inches away from losing my mind)
That's when (I hear your)
I hear a voice inside my head (I hear your voice, Julie, Julie, Julie, Julie, Julie I love you, Julie we miss you,Julie we still got love for ya baby)
Just, just, just when I hear your voice (clear as day inside my head)
I really don't know what to do
Sometimes I just put...
I put my hands up

Just when I go back to church
All your friends are talkin' 'bout ya'
