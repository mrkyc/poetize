Hey, hey, hey

I woke up on top of the world today
Holdin' her hand, she don't mind me leading the way
As long as I never let her fall
She wouldn't have to pull away (Ooh hoo)
Gypsy woman, can you read my palm?
Is my love line broken or is it long?
Small is yours inside of mine, words cannot define
How it feels to be in love

Oh, my fingertips touch your soft hair
Then my two lips kissed you and then this
I doubt that I'll find a love of this kind

'Cause when I hold your hand
I got the whole world in my hand
Ever since the day you came across my path
Oh, baby, that was the plan
What else could a man
With all the love his heart could stand?
Everyone thought if the riches all around the land
Don't compare to the woman he has
I got the whole world in my hand
You might also like
And here we stand the two of us face to face
Starin' at each other, me smiling, you cryin' away
So long ago we both made plans
To be together on this day
And with these two words I vow to be
Your protector providin' unconditionally
Oh, and never let go of your hand
You are my destiny

Oh, my fingertips touch your soft hair
Then my two lips kissed you and then this
I doubt that I find a love of this kind

'Cause when I hold your hand
(When I hold your hand)
I got the whole world in my hand (Baby)
Ever since the day you came across my path
Oh, baby, that was the plan
What else could a man
With all the love his heart could stand
Everyone thought if the riches all around the land
Don't compare to the woman he has
I got the whole world in my hand
Beautiful in every way
Promise not to let my heart ever stray
To give you peace of mind and never lie
And baby, if you ever cry, every tear I'm dryin'
I'm grateful and I'm reminded
That I see clear, more precious than any diamond
'Cause somethin' way bigger than us binds us
Together we're classic and timeless

'Cause when I hold your hand
I've got the whole world in my hand
Ever since the day you crossed my path
My baby, that was the plan
What else could a man
With all the love one heart could stand
Everyone thought if the riches all around the land
Don't compare to the woman he has
