No, no no no no no no no no no
Ooh, la la la, la

Girl, I hate to have to be the one to ruin your plans
It's unrealistic what you're looking for in a man
I may not be perfect but I can love you perfectly
You know what you want but you don't know what you need
Good sex, monogamous, keeps all of his promises
Handsome and tall plus no kids, I think you oughta see a psychiatrist
Bank account got a figure six
Bruce Wayne, Clark Kent
The only problem is, he don't exist

I think you need the invisible man
So you can never see his flaws and mistakes (Mistakes)
Better come get this loving while you can
Waiting to hit the jackpot, grand prize, sweepstakes (Sweepstakes)
With sis and then her friends wanna tell you how you feel
Making you believe there's something out there that ain't real
Don't mean to alarm ya, no prince coming to charm ya
And the perfect man you're waiting for, he don't exist
Ooh, la la la, ah
You might also like
Sorry to shatter your perfect picture of love
This ain't no movie, ain't no director yelling "Cut"
Everyone's an actor, you gotta stick to the script
You want a fairytale but they just don't exist
You want a knight in shining armor
Hero that come to save ya
Fly through the skyline, red cape
Baby, let me set the record straight
If you don't know what to settle for, you lose it all
'Cause it just don't exist

I think you need the invisible man
So you can never see his flaws and mistakes (Mistakes)
Better come get this loving while you can
Waiting to hit the jackpot, grand prize, sweepstakes (Sweepstakes)
With sis and then her friends wanna tell you how you feel
Making you believe there's something out there that ain't real
Don't mean to alarm ya, no prince coming to charm ya
And the perfect man you're waiting for, he don't exist

All that time that you're spending, looking for happy ending
Baby, it can start with us (Start with us)
Subtract all of the baggage, and maybe we can manage
A life that equals up to love
We'll never know division, I'll play my position
Be patient, baby, no need to rush
You want the most with the ghost, let me coast
You 'bout to miss out on this, 'cause he don't exist
I think you need the invisible man
So you can never see his flaws and mistakes (Mistakes)
Better come get this loving while you can
Waiting to hit the jackpot, grand prize, sweepstakes (Sweepstakes)
With sis and then her friends wanna tell you how you feel
Making you believe there's something out there that ain't real
Don't mean to alarm ya, no prince coming to charm ya
