Now what it is, what it's gon' be, no, I can't call it
All I know is I had to step up, step up
Speed it up, cut the chase, goin' for first base
Before them other cats try to get ya, get ya

You're movin' them hips, killin' me with every dip, girl
You about to get a tip, do it now, yeah
The worst that goes down is you turn me down
But this time around, I doubt it, shawty

Hey, how you doin'?
Baby, what you're gettin' into?
I don't know what your name is or who you came with
But I ain't leavin' without you
Hey, girl, how you doin'?
I never seen nothin' like you, like you
'Cause a body that shape is your claim to fame
And girl, I ain't leavin' without you, no
I want your body, yeah, yeah
(Your bod, your bod, your bod, your bod, your body)

Oh, what you drink? What you sip? I got the next round
Martini and Goose, now, tell me what's up, what's up
Conversation my eyes is havin' with your thighs
Gon' get me outta line, they better shut up, shut up
You might also like
You're movin' them hips, killin' me with every dip, girl
You about to get a tip, do it now, yeah
The worst that goes down is you turn me down
You're feelin' your boy now, so I doubt it, shorty

Hey, how you're doin'?
Baby, what you're gettin' into?
I don't know what your name is or who you came with
But I ain't leavin' without you
Hey, girl, how you're doin'?
I never seen nothin' like you
'Cause a body that shape is your claim to fame
And girl, I ain't leavin' without you, no
I want your body
(Your bod, your bod, your bod, your bod, your body)
I want your body, your bod
Your bod, your bod, your bod, your body

He snubbed, you think your love was with your love
Love to get to know you better
Let's go somewhere, anywhere
I don't care, long as we can ride together
One more sip, wet your lips, we can dip
I'll slip that, tip the valet
Doors up, full halogen, yep, yep, she modelin'
I just had to say hey, hey, hey
Hey, how you're doin'?
Baby, what you're gettin' into?
I don't know what your name is or who you came with
But I ain't leaving without you
Hey, girl, how you're doin'?
I never seen nothin' like you
'Cause a body that shape is your claim to fame
And girl, I ain't leavin' without you, no

(Hey) Hey, baby, what's that in your cup?
You need to let me fill that up
You know I'm tryin' to see what's up with you, ayy (I ain't leavin' without you)
(Hey, girl, how you're doin'?) And I ain't thinkin 'bout your man
He shoulda had you by the hand
'Cause I'm your number one fan (Girl, I ain't leavin' without you)
Hey, how you're doin?
