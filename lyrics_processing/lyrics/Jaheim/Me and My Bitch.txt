Ghetto Slick, Divine Mill
Another ghetto classic, baby
Y'all gon' smell this one
Ooh, yeah yeah yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh ooh

Sitting here with carats in your ears, mink on your back
Your bank account stacked
You deserve everything you got
'Cause you held me down when things got hot on the block
Looking back, I remember the days
When shit got thick you were the first to say
"Baby, keep your head up it'll be okay
You're better off without that kind of bitter ass nigga anyway"

It's on tonight
Cash up in the dash and I'm feelin' right (Yeah yeah)
Got heat up in the seat just in case of beef
For anyone who wanna come test me and my baby (Gotta know)
Honey, don't be afraid (Oh)
See this cat ridin' in that Escalade (Oh, oh)
Plotting on my riches, yeah, he will get slayed (Yeah yeah)
Messin' 'round with me and my lady, me and my bitch
You might also like
You're a dream, you're my ghetto queen
If I ain't got nobody else I know I got you on my team
So I knock, get the cake, cop the rock, meet your pops
Then move your whole family off the block
Still, niggas talking this and that
"Jah don't how to treat you, don't know how to act
You're a good girl you deserve better than that"
When in fact, accounts are major, got your name attached

It's on tonight
Cash up in the dash and I'm feelin' right (Yeah yeah)
Got heat up in the seat just in case of beef (Alright)
For anyone who wanna come test me and my baby (You gotta know, yeah)
Honey, don't be afraid
See this cat ridin' in that Escalade (Ah yeah)
Plotting on my riches, yeah, he will get slayed (Oh)
Messin' 'round with me and my lady, me and my bitch

Whatever's wrong I'll make it right
Got your back, count on that
Whatever you need I'm down for you, 'cause
