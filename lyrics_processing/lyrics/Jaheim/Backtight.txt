To much of a thug nigga to tell you that i love you (i love you)
I know that i made mistakes been hopein and prayin that it ain't to late
Thought i had my game tight thought i had it lockdown knew when shit wasn't right
Now you want to blow before i let you go theres something you just gotta know
(chorus)
Ain't nothing stopin me from gettin backtight wit you
Go head and dip you got tha right to if i gotta roll up my sleeves
And fight for you ill stand outside in rain all night for you
Ain't nothing stopin me from gettin backtight wit you
Go head and dip you got tha right to if i gotta roll up my sleeves
And fight for you ill stand outside in the rain all night
Three months three weeks two days its tha same shit shorty she ain't havein it
Back then i wasn't serious makein so much paper kept em curious
Chickens cluckin everywhere i didn't care thinkin to myself that you'll always be there
Used to makein love to ya lady i wouldn't rather be pushin my mercades
(chorus)
Ain't nothing stopin me from gettin backtight wit you
Go head and dip you got tha right to if i gotta roll up my sleeves
And fight for you ill stand outside in rain all night for you
Ain't nothing stopin me from gettin backtight wit you
Go head and dip you got tha right to if i gotta roll up my sleeves
And fight for you ill stand outside in the rain all night

Thru tha good thru tha bad thru it all girl i need ya back
