All she wanted me to do was tell the truth
She didn't really want much more from me
It ain't hard to do
You think I would learned my lesson after the hundredth time
Wasn't really ready to man up
So I kept telling lies

She had to go there ain't no way to stop it
She needed space so I made like a rocketship
I can't even trip cause I slipped up
Went and messed the whole thing up

If I were you I'd leave me too
I'd be over me trying to tell me what to do
If I were you, I wouldn't believe me
If I were you I wouldn't love me either, me neither

Girl if I were you
I'd hate me too especially after all that I took you through
If I were you I'd need to take a breather
If I were you I'd wouldn't love me either, me neither
The hardest thing to do is see your woman cry
There ain't no good answer to "who is she"? and "why"?
Cause Jay was the kind of man who looked girls straight in thee Eye, knowing that I was caught but deny deny deny

If I were you I'd wouldn't love me either, me neither
I'd do the same thing if I were you too
I'd wouldn't stay with me and play the fool, if I were you

If I were you I'd leave me too

If I were you, I wouldn't believe me
