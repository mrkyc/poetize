Yeah, yeah

I'm not wildin' out like I used to (Oh no)
I don't do the things I used to no more (Baby)
I've changed for you (Ayy, ayy)
Looking back, I thought I would never (Ooh ooh)
Love like this broke so many hearts before (Oh)
(Hey, 'cause) I changed for you

I don't do the things that I used to do no more
Everything that you do, I adore
No more lies, no more games
Everything I say, I mean, ayy
And all the love you give me, baby
It means so much to me
So don't take your love away
No one compares to what you do for me
And every time you see me, baby
You take me in your arms, hold me
Trust me, baby, I won't ever leave you

Believe me
I'm yours forever
You need me (I need you)
'Cause I'm down for whatever
Damn, I've changed
You might also like
I'm not wildin' out like I used to
I don't do the things I used to no more (No more)
I've changed for you
Looking back, I thought I would never (Never)
Love like this broke so many hearts before (Never before)
I changed for you (Yeah)

Pull out the fine wine glasses, dinner in bed (Yeah)
Went and took some culinary classes (Alright)
Gotta stay sexy for you, baby, tighten up my body
Workin' on my ghetto Pilates
I'm not going out tonight (Tonight)
We can hit the sofa
Cuddle up, satellite service
Oh baby, whatever, let me accommodate ya
Is there anything you'd like for me to change?
I can cut my plats (My plats)
But I can't cover up my tats (Oh no)
I did some things that I can't take back
But baby, it's true, I would change it all for you

Believe me (You gotta believe me, baby)
I'm yours forever (Oh whoa, oh whoa)
Completely (Completely in love)
'Cause I'm down for whatever
Baby, I can change (Baby, I can change)
I'm not wildin' out like I used to (Oh)
I don't do the things I used to no more (Oh, no more)
I've changed for you
Looking back, I thought I would never
Love like this broke so many hearts before (Oh yeah)
I changed for you

New and improved, bringing out the best of me
Because the old me was lonely
Searching for my one and only
So happy that I found you
Saw the potential
And you made it so simple to be loved
And I'll never be the same
Baby, for you, I've changed

I'm not wildin' out like I used to
I don't do the things I used to no more (No more)
I've changed for you (Ooh, ooh)
Lookin' back I thought I would never
(Thought I would never) (Love like this)
Love like this broke so many hearts before
(So many hearts before)
(So many hearts, so many hearts)
(I've changed for you)
I've changed for you (Hey, yeah, yeah)
I'm not wildin' out like I used to
(I'm not wildin' out like I used to no more)
I don't do the things I used to no more
(No more, I've changed for you)
I've changed for you (I've changed)
Lookin' back I thought I would never
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, pretty baby)
Love like this broke so many hearts before
