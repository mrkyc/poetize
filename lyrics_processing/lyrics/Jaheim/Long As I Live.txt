Long as I live, I'll handle my biz (Yeah)
Take care of our kids
'Cause loving you is what it is, girl
Long as I live, I vow to share with you
Happiness and bliss, 'cause loving you is what it is

With this ring, I thee wed
To share my life, to share my home
To share my heart, and my bed
To not make you weak but strengthen you instead
'Til death do us part
From this day forward, for all time, baby
Here on earth and where angels fly
Gonna love you so much 'til it makes you cry
With every beat of my heart, ooh ooh ooh

Long as I live, I'll handle my biz
Take care of our kids
'Cause loving you is what it is, girl
Long as I live, I vow to share with you
Happiness and bliss, 'cause loving you is what it is

Before our God I'll take this vow
With family gathered around it's official now
So take my hand and let's take a bow
And together we will win
A commitment to make, a sacrifice
I'd gladly give it up and made up my mind
Just for being my friend, being my wife
I'd do it all again

Won't you trust me? I will show you
The type of man I was raised to be if you just let me
(Let me, baby)
Slide this ring on (Slide it up), up on your finger
(On your finger, girl)
Cop the crib, help raise the kids, yes, I'll deliver
Promise to never let you down, oh no
I promise to always be right there, I'll be around
Just as long as you say the words
Long as I live, I vow to share with you
Happiness and bliss
Girl, loving you, loving you is what it is
