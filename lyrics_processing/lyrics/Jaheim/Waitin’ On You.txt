Yeah, uh, oh yeah
Sit right here girl let me talk to you
'Bout some things that we've been going through
Let's do whatever girl and make it last
We've gotta take our time we can't move to fast
Now I'm not the type of cat to hit and run
Girl I swear that you're the only one
Now what I am girl is a lovin' man
While others just wanna smack and smash that ass
Quick and fast
1- (Miss Jones) (Jaheim) One, two what you wanna do?
(Ain't gon' even front girl I wanna tear it up no)
Two, three tell me what's it gonna be? You ain't gonna get
No peppey so you better keep watchin' T.V
Look at you tryin to play me like I'm loose
(Girl you got it twisted got me waitin' on you
Waitin' on you, girl you must be trippin' I'll be waitin' on you)
(Jaheim)
Baby girl you know I'm stuck on you
And I'll do just what you want me to
Whatever it is I aim to please for your love
Give my all my needs
I wanna touch you right here
Kiss you right there
However you want it baby
I don't care
But if the night's not right
And that's okay I love you anyway
Your JaJa's here to stay

After all this time
I've been with you baby
Do you anna act up talkin' slick
You talkin' crazy (Crazy)
You know you mean the world to me
Out of all the places in this world
Theres not one place I'd rather be
So stop actin like you wanna be alone
If you felt that way you would of never phoned
And if tonight's not right
That's okay I love you anyway
Your JaJa's here to stay
