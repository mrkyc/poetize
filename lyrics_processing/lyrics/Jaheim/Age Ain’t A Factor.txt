My baby, my baby, my baby
What a lady, girl
Ooh

You're like a wine, you get better with time
Got your Nia Long on, this your song, you're so fine
From everything that you wear, your kind of beauty is rare
And I swear you get better lookin' with every year
Uh, uh, hit your sexual peak, your full figure physique
Young girl can't compete, come cook ya **** somethin' to eat, baby
And since we're in the kitchen, girl, let me get that muffin
You look better the older you get (Benjamin Buttons)

Can't believe with time, girl you're getting badder
Looking like a picture of before and after
Your story gets more pretty every chapter
Gettin' more attractive, age ain't a factor!
The young one that I got, I'm' bout to leave her
'Cause berries sittin' on the vine with time are sweeter
If I can be your man, girl, you won't want for nothin'
You look better the older you get (Benjamin Buttons)

I propose a toast, playas raise your glass
For my Vivica Foxes and my Stacy Dashes, uh
Ladies it's Thanksgiving, and I'm about to eat that stuffin'
You look better the older you get (Benjamin Buttons)
