Yeah, uh, it's crazy, man, oh, oh
Ooh, hoo, hoo, you wouldn't believe it, no, yeah

'Til that right somebody comes along
You fall so strong, now you're gone
Floatin' out of your body
Plans y'all makin', trips taken
But you can't even remember your life before them
But you won't believe that it's true
'Til it happens to you, to you, to you, oh yeah
'Til that Sunday mornin' and you heard that callin'
Gots to preach that sermon, choir, organ
Palms start sweatin', knees shakin'
And you fall to your knees sayin', thank you, Jesus
(Thank you, Jesus)
But you won't believe it's true
'Til it happens to you, yeah

And may your life be forever changed
May you find your voice, be forever brave
And on that day may you finally find
That happiness that you pursue (Oh)
May your eyes be open
May you see more vivid colors
Green and blue
When it happens to you, to you, hey

'Til every other woman looks good
Even though you're wifed up
And on the side got a sweet lil' thing
Still playin' games
Protection pop and you just couldn't stop
Then your junior drops
Then you're wonderin'
Could this really be happening to me?
(Happening to me, oh oh no no, oh)
This morning didn't go like it was supposed
House foreclosed, third time for this interview
Resumed that afternoon, thought you froze
'Til they shook your hand and they welcomed you
Your hopes restored and renewed
Can it happen for you?
(Yes, it can, yes, it can)
May your life be

And may your life be forever changed
May you find your voice, be forever brave
And on that day may you finally find
That happiness that you pursue
May your eyes be open
May you see more vivid colors
Green and blue
When it happens to you, to you, you
I can recall the days of hearing myself say
If I walk, talk, think a little differently
All those things that happen to them
Would never happen to me
'Til I found that girl, 'til I found the truth
I found out you pay for everything you do
Oh yeah, until I found out I'm no different from you

May your life be forever changed
Find your voice, be forever brave
And on that day may you find
The happiness that you pursue
May your eyes be open
And may you see more vivid colors
Green and blue
When it happens to you
(It could happen to you, hey, hey, hey)
May your life be changed
May you hear the words I say
Find the happiness you pursue
May your eyes be open
May you see more vivid colors
Green and blue
When it happens to you
(Happen to you, yeah)
May your life be changed
Hear the words I say
Find the happiness you pursue
