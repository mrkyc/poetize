Brige(Intro)
Mmmm get thorough it hmmmhmmmmm
I done stood out on the block 12 Oclock still pitchin
I done broke up bricks
Wit baken soda in the kitchen
I done lose my religon
And spend nights wishin
I could fill up the holes in my sole Theres something missin
I done sat back and laughed and let the beef unfold
Done squozed off triggers
Robbed niggas and stole
5 years parale, kid I been locked up
I done lost so much my heart is boxed up
Chorus:
I thought I'd never see a blue sky, never seen the birds fly (ohhhh until
I metcha Sunshine)
Neva new the otha side I Never new what love was like (what love was like)
Neva seen a pot a gold(seen a pot of gold), Baby ur the rainbow ( baby your the rainbow
Take me to where I neva been (ohhhh Iiiii
I thought the day would neva end
But now ,now that

I done drowned my sorrows in a bottle of gin
I done poured out licquor for my very best friends
I been rich, fell off, then got dough again
Been left out in the cold though it would never end
I done promisedd to my lady I've been tryna change
Met a chick went back an did the same damn thing
I don't took the blame, and blamed people for things
Snatching chains on the trains i done done some crazyyyyy things
Chorus
I thought I neva seen a blue sky(seen a blue sky)
Neva seen the birds fly
Ohhh until I metcha' sunshine
Neva knew the other side
Neva knew what love was like- (what love whas like)
Neva seen a pot of gold
But baby your the rainbow 
Take me were I've neva been ohhh IIIIiiii .(I thought this day would neva end)
But now, now that I found my girl ( I've got too)
I ain't neva eva eva gon let her goo0o0o
And now, now shes inside of my world
I ain't neva eva eva gon let her goooo nooooo
Every day seemed gray
Until you came and brought the sun my way
(to heaven up there send her my way, i long for the day somebody will say i love you baby)
And if it weren't for you, there be no person I be trustin and you
You got my word Oh for better or worse I missed you so much you just my girl for ever
Now, now that I found my girl I ain't neva eva eva gon' let her go nooooo
And now, now shes inside of my world I ain't neva eva eva gon let her go
( I will neva let youuu goo)
