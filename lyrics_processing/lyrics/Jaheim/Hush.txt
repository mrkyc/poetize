I can not believe this, we just put it down
What are you going to tell him, when he comes back in town?
Are you gonna let him know, that I'm giving you the business?
I tried my best to let it go, but I could not resist it
It's too temptin, I'm slippin
Touchin' it, feelin' it
Me and him be kickin' it, while all the while I've been hittin it, (Woah-oh)
I know that girl it's gone be hard for me to roll with him, cause we be hoopin in shit, that's my dog, my best friend
Said I would never let a chick come between me and my homie
Had a lil too much to drink and the night you put it on me
And I don't know if I regret that we be up in them hotel suites, baby this is crazy (baby)
