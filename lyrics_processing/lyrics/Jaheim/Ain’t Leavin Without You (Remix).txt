Well, let me at it
Say no more
Haha
Let's get it
Let me get my dance on
I like that
Yeah
This is the remix, uh
Oh yeah

Yo, nice red heels, jeans huggin'
Hair to the shoulder, mean muggin', look like me lovin'
Might be friendly or she might be stubborn
And all I know is she had Jaheim buggin'
I was on the other side, sippin' and puffin'
Poppin' over here all different, we touchin'
Everybody grown no riffin' and fussin'
You can get that, don't sweat that, it's nothin'

Now what it is, what it's gon' be, no, I can't call it
All I know is I had to step up, step up
Speed it up, cut the chase, go in for first base
Before them other cats try to get ya, get ya
You might also like
You're movin' them hips, killin' me with every dip, girl
You about to get a tip, do it now yeah
The worst that goes down is you turn me down
But this time around, I doubt it, shawty

Hey, how you're doin'?
Baby, what you're gettin' into?
I don't know what your name is or who you came with
But I ain't leavin' without you
Hey, girl, how you're doin'?
I never seen nothin' like you, like you
'Cause a body that shape is your claim to fame
And girl, I ain't leavin' without you, no
I want your body, yeah, yeah
(Your bod, your bod, your bod, your bod, your body)

Oh, what you drink? What you sip? I got the next round
Martini and Goose, now, tell me what's up, what's up
Conversation my eyes is havin' with your thighs
Gon' get me outta line, they better shut up, shut up

You're movin' them hips, killin' me with every dip, girl
You about to get a tip, do it now yeah
The worst that goes down is you turn me down
You're feelin' your boy now, so I doubt it, shorty
Hey, how you're doin'?
Baby, what you're gettin' into?
I don't know what your name is or who you came with
But I ain't leavin' without you
Hey, girl, how you're doin'?
I never seen nothin' like you
'Cause a body that shape is your claim to fame
And girl, I ain't leavin' without you, no
I want your body
(Your bod, your bod, your bod, your bod, your body)
I want your body, your bod, your bod, your bod, your bod, your body

Yo, let's leave the club and get some grub
And get in the tub and make some love and handle our biz
It's me and you, you and me, soon you'll see
That I'm a G and that's what it is
The way you move the way you shift your thighs and hips
Your face and lips, just something about you
See basically the moral of the story is
Baby girl, I ain't leavin' without you

Hey, how you're doin'?
Baby, what you gettin' into?
I don't know what your name is or who you came with
But I ain't leavin' without you
Hey, girl, how you doin'?
I never seen nothin' like you
'Cause a body that shape is your claim to fame
And girl, I ain't leavin' without you, no
(Hey) Hey, baby, what's that in your cup?
You need to let me fill that up
You know I'm tryin' to see what's up with you, ayy (I ain't leavin' without you)
(Hey, girl, how you doin'?) And I ain't thinkin 'bout your man
He shoulda had you by the hand
'Cause I'm your number one fan (Girl, I ain't leavin' without you)
Hey, how you doin?
