There's somethin' about young love (Young love)
So many people say that it is
So impossible, yeah, impossible, yeah yeah
Impossible, yeah
This is how I feel

Ever since I met you, girl
Everything about me changed
Suddenly I feel alive
Somethin' 'bout you by my side
Me and you against the world
Finally a diamond girl
I ain't even been the same
Ever since I heard your name, girl
(You are the reason)
My heart skips a beat sometimes
I've been waitin' all my life
Think I finally found my wife
But I don't wanna rush your heart
Take your time, sweetheart
Say the word and I'll come wherever you are

Shorty, hear me now
(When you need me)
Just reach out
(Just reach out and I'll be close enough)
To witness the moment you say
You might also like
(Now it's impossible)
For me to live without you
For me to breathe without you
'Cause I can see just who I'm supposed to be
(Now it's impossible)
For me to be without love
Girl, you make my life about love
So the people see the impossibilities, yeah

They said we couldn't touch the moon
Look what our love can do
Got forever in my sight
I saw heaven in your eyes
Just what I was dreamin' of
Need you on my team because
You make me a superstar
I don't need a fancy car
(You are the reason my heart skips a beat sometimes)
I've been waiting all my life
I think I finally found my wife
Wanna walk you down that aisle
Me and you together now
Happiness everywhere
Since I found my shorty
Shorty, hear me now
(Hear me now, hear me now)
Just reach out
(Reach out and I'll be there)
To witness the moment you say

(Now it's impossible)
For me to live without you
For me to breathe without you
'Cause I can see just who I am supposed to be
(Now it's impossible) Impossible, baby
For me to be without love
Girl, you make my life about love
So the people see the impossibilities, oh

Don't you ever take your love away from me
It would be so impossible for me to breathe
Can't eat, can't sleep, couldn't think
I need your lovin' right here at all times
So I can say it's alright, alright, alright
Yeah, yeah, yeah
It is so hard to see that I was meant for you
And you were made, you were made for me
Shorty, hear me now
(Hear me now, hear me now)
Just reach out
(Reach out and I'll be there)
To witness the moment you say

(Now it's impossible)
For me to live without you
For me to breathe without you
'Cause I can see just who I'm supposed to be
(Now it's impossible) Impossible, baby
For me to be without love
Girl, you make my life about love
