(Realize) You're out of time, oh, oh, oh yeah

I'm not like what you've been used to
'Cause I send flowers and listen to (To your problems)
To your problems and then take time to solve them
Girl, you just don't have a clue (No)
How good I'll be for you
Oh, oh, oh, my baby, oh, oh, listen

You're making all types of plans (But you just don't get it), oh no
The rock's waiting for your hand (But you gotta be wit' it)
I'm not trying to be no fool (No fool)
But I'm pretty damn close with you (With you)
Girl I really, really want (Really, really want)
I really wanna be your dude
