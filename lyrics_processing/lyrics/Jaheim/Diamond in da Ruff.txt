Mmm, diamond
Oh, diamond (Diamond)
Diamond in the rough
Someone that you don't meet twice

We left The Bricks for the 'burbs
(Bricks for the 'burbs)
Turned Mo' into Remy (Remy)
Matching fur coats and Fendi
From the bus to a Bentley coupe
With a closet full of shoes, yeah (Yeah, yeah)

Then our smiles turned to frowns
Ups turned to downs
I don't know where I'm going now
I think about her every once in awhile

We started out like Bobby and Whitney
Justin and Britney
Then it all got ugly
If it weren't for the money (Oh no)
You said I start actin' funny
But what's wrong wit'cha, honey?
Then the good turned to bad
Forgot what we had
Is it too late to get it back?
I think about her more than once in awhile
You might also like
Like when I spot a rainbow
Or see a fallin' star
A set of twins, or a classic car (Baby)
A four-leaf clover, or a two dollar bill (Yeah)
It's so rare that it's so unreal
And I don't know how to get over her smile
I wonder what she's doing (What's going on?)
I think about her every once in awhile (Every once in awhile)

I should've came with a ring (Came with a ring)
Set a date for next May
Guess I thought that you'd wait
Now I hate that I took so long
Played around with her, now she's gone (No no no)

Now my smiles turned to frowns
Ups turned to downs
And I don't know where I'm going now (Now now now)
I think about her every once in awhile

We argued like Archie and Edith
Like Ike Turner and Tina
But I really didn't mean it
I was raised not to hit a woman
Especially not the one I'm lovin'
But when the good turned to bad
Happy to sad
I wish we could take it back (How I miss you, baby)
I think about her every once in awhile
Like when I spot a rainbow
Or see a falling star
A set of twins, or a classic car
(I think about you, baby)
A four-leaf clover or a two dollar bill (Oh)
It's so rare that it's so unreal
I don't know how
To get over her smile
I wonder what she's doing now
I think about her every once in awhile

You're like a star
Shining in the broad daylight
Something you don't see all the time
And now I finally recognize
That I shoulda made you all mine
Never shoulda let you pass me by
You put that sparkle in my life
Someone that you don't meet twice
I'm gonna live to regret it, baby
Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh
Baby, baby
