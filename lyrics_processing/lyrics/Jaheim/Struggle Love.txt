Something special
Hey oh yeah
Do you remember (all of the hard times)
'Cause I remember so well
Let's play a little game, let's wait until it's raining
And kick 'em all out like I'm Martin
Let's go to Chinese blow a few trees
Pitter-patter on the roof of your apartment
Let's put it to a flick, put your butt up on my

It was four chicken wings and rice
And now we got more than we ever dreamed
If we got it all, that ain't the way it seems
If I could give it up, the richer I get
I really miss that struggle, love
Now ain't that love (love)
Ain't that love (love)

So much love (love)
Ain't that love (love)
Oh oh oh oh (love)

The stages and fashion nights
Before we got fly, baby, you and I
It was four chicken wings and rice
And now we got more than we ever dreamed
If we got it all, that ain't the way it seems
If I could give it up, the richer I get
I really miss that struggle, love
If that ain't love (love)
I don't know what love is (love)
If that ain't love (love)
(Love) love
If that ain't love (love)
(Love)
If I could give it up, the richer I get
I really miss that struggle, love
If it wasn't for the streets, if it wasn't for the crimes
Oh the struggle made me, oh girl
??? in you baby we gonna-- I never never
For the poor little girls and a couple of boys
A little bit of love bring you so much joy
Home grown love, home grown love
 on your phone kind of love
Champagne love, let's make love
 in your eye kind of love
Nothing could defy kind of love
Hurtful of pride kind of love
Struggle for you love kind of love
Ain't that love (love)

So much love (love
Ain't that love (love)
(love)
Oh oh oh oh (love)
Yeah (love)
If I could give it up, the richer I get
