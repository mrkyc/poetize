Got my mind stuck here in the stratosphere
30, 000 feet above the ground
Oh no

Standing so close to me, now tell me can you
Hear my heart beat at the speed of sound?
Oh no no
Just when I thought that I would never ever
Fall in love
You came and I surrender
Cause when I found you
I found forever
And I'll do anything I gotta do
To keep our world together
And believe me when I tell you
My dreams will come true
Baby, baby
Cause when I found you
I, I found forever
Ever ever ever ever
I, I found forever
Ever ever ever ever
I, I found forever

Once upon a time, came suddenly

You came and I surrender
Cause when I found you

And I'll do anything I gotta do
To keep our world together
And believe me when I tell you
My dreams will come true
