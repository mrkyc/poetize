My, oh, my, girl I know what's on your mind
He don't put it on you right like I do
Now come on baby don't be shy
I know what you wanna try
You know sugar will get fly all on you

You've got that feeling
You've got that feeling baby
I got you feeding
I got you feeding baby
Say hola hola
Before you go down lower
I got a question for you babe

Do you think about me?
Baby when you're with him
Do you think about me?
When you're out with your friends
Do you think about me?
Doing work at the gym
Do you think about me?
Do you think about...
Do you think about me?

'Cause I kiss you on that spot
The one that gets you high
And he don't get it popping like I do

You've got that feeling
You've got that feeling baby
I got you feeding

Say hola hola
