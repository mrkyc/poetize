Party after two
Goddamn
Yeah
You say that your boyfriend
Don't treat you like a girlfriend
So you called me up and
Told me to put that work in
I drive to the east end
And then we get to creeping, oh
No, no, no, no, no
Oh, no, no, no, no, no
Seven inches deep in
I can see my demons
You got me believing
I been catching feelings
I leave, then we pretend
Again until next weekend, oh
No, no, no, no, no
Oh, no, no, no, no, no
Because
I want your late night love
I want you in the darkness
I want your late night love

Used to know all of my exes
