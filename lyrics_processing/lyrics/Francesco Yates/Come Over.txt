Ooh
Oh, nah, nah, nah, uh

Yeah, sugar's so fly, back it up nice, uh
Oh my, oh my
Feelin' just right, thinkin' I might
Need a bad girl in my life
These low lights make me so shy
But somethin' in your eyes
Says "Take me all the way tonight"

Ooh yeah, you got me baby
And I feel your body calling
And I know you feel it too, yeah
Ooh, you got me baby
And the way the night is goin'
I think I might leave with you

So, baby, just come over
Let me pull you closer
I just wanna know you
For more than one night, let me hold you
Come over
Let me pull you closer
I just wanna know you
For more than one night, let me hold you
You might also like
Wind up tight, sip gin and wine
But you feel lonely inside
You've said one too many goodbyes
To look love in its eyes
Find what you will find
But we won't know 'til we try
So, take me all the way tonight

Ooh, you got me baby
And I feel your body calling
And I know you feel it too, yeah
Ooh, you got me baby
And the way the night is goin'
I think I might leave with you

So baby just come over
Let me pull you closer
I just wanna know you
For more than one night, let me hold you
Let me come over
Let me pull you closer
I just wanna know you
For more than one night, let me hold you
Let me hold ya
Let me hold ya
For more than one night
Let me hold you
Oh, yeah

Oh, baby stop, go slower
Drop down and get lower
Baby, stop, go slower
Drop down and get lower
Baby, stop, go slower
Drop down and get lower
Baby, stop, go slower
Drop down and get lower

So baby just come over
Let me pull you closer
I just wanna know you
For more than one night, let me hold you
Come over
Let me pull you closer
I just wanna know you
For more than one night, let me hold you
Oh, yeah
Hold you babe, babe
Hold you babe
