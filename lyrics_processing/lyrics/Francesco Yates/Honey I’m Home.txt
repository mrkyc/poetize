Hey, hey, hey, oh
Hey, hey, hey, ooh baby
Hey, hey, hey oh, yeah, yeah, oh yeah

Honey I'm home, where you hiding?
Tired of work, nine to fiving
I can feel your devotion
Come downstairs let's put this in motion
When we play, we play hard
No more talking, let's get it on
Babe, want your sweet, sweet affection
I'm in need of your attention

When your love is raining down on me, baby
Your love is all I need
And now we're making sweet, sweet love (sweet love, sweet love)
(To be loved) And now we're making sweet, sweet love (sweet love, sweet love)

Hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, ooh baby
Hey, hey, hey, mmmm

Honey I'm home, where you hiding?
Now I'm here, no more fantasizing
I can taste the pain and pleasure
On your lips, they're so soft and tender, tender
I'll be kind, I'll be gentle
With a passion you can not measure
I won't stop 'til it's over
So come here, pull me closer

When your love is raining down on me, baby
Your love is all I need
And now we're making sweet, sweet love (sweet love, sweet love)
(To be loved) And now we're making sweet, sweet love (sweet love, sweet love)

When your love is raining down on me, babe
Your love is all I need

And now we're making sweet, sweet love (sweet love, sweet love)
And now we're making sweet, sweet love (sweet love, sweet love)
And now we're making sweet, sweet love (sweet love, sweet love)
And now we're making sweet, sweet love (sweet love, sweet love)
And now we're making sweet, sweet love (sweet love, sweet love)
And now we're making sweet, sweet love (sweet love, sweet love)
And now we're making sweet, sweet love (sweet love, sweet love)
