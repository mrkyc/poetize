We're alone, we're alone, we're alone, once again
And it's better than being alone here all by myself
I could see it coming from a long way ahead
I don't ever want to be lonely with no one else

But you
You never told me
Yeah you
You never told me
If there was more than this

I'm there when you call
I'm there when you call on me
I'm there when you call
I'm there when you call on me
I'm there when you call
I'm there when you call on me
I'm there when you call
I'm there when you call on me
Ooh
You might also like
Well it's cold, it's cold, it's cold here next to you
And your close enough to hold me
But not to tell the truth, babe
I should'a seen this coming from a long way ahead
Ooh, there's an opening inside you
But you won't let me in

But you
You never told me, no
Yeah you
You never told me
If there was more than this

I'm there when you call
I'm there when you call on me
I'm there when you call
I'm there when you call on me
I'm there when you call
I'm there when you call on me
I'm there when you call
I'm there when you call on me

I'm there when you call me, baby (hmm)
You never call me
I'm there when you call
I'm there when you call on me
I'm there when you call
I'm there when you call on me
I'm there when you call
I'm there when you call on me
I'm there when you call
I'm there when you call on me
If there was more than this, Ooh
Oh, when you call me, baby (I'm there when you call)
I'm there when you call on me
I'm there when you call me
