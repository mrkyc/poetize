I know you know
You know I know
The feeling isn't easy being taken away from each other
But I will let
You be connected to me
By a red thread tying us to one another
To one another
To one another

You are a friend
But even enemies
Have a connection to the tapestry that's hanging in us
I wanna know
I need to know
The true amount of pressure that a heartstring can take upon it
Take upon it

When we
Find out that it's all
Find out that it's all
Just made of a little red thread
Find out that we're all
Find out that we're all
Just made of a little red thread

Is there a way
To be away from you
Without an aching in my soul making everything harder?
Oh, I am grateful
For the way you give
But my fragility is killing me
I wish it away
I wish it away
I wish it away

When we
Find out that it's all
Find out that it's all
Just made of a little red thread
Find out that we're all
Find out that we're all
Just made of a little red thread

Oh, a friend in need
Is a friend indeed
Gotta give what you got
So start it
Time is an illusion
This confusion leads to enemies
Take hand
Make a plan
And imagine every single soul
Standing for something
There's a thread that has led us
To each other over centuries
We're gonna break it, gonna break it
Yeah you know we're gonna break it, gonna break it
Oh, we never wanna break it, wanna break it
Oh, let's say we'll never break it
Never break it
When we
Find out that it's all
Find out that it's all
Just made of a little red thread
Find out that we're all
Find out that we're all
