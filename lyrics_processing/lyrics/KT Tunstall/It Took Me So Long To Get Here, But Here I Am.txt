I took it all, all on my back
I picked it up on my shoulders
Thought it was all, all I could have
And it was better, it was better than nothing
Now I know, I know that isn't true
What have I got to show
After seeing it through
Now I know, I know a few things

And I can feel it
Coming towards me

It took me so long to get here but here I am
(It took me so long I can't believe it)
It took me so long to get here but here I am
(It took me so long but here I am)
Everything I tried and
All the things I dreamed of
(It took me so long I can't believe it)
It took me so long to get here but here I am

If I could do it, do it all again
I can't safely say I wouldn't change it
There were things left me feeling ashamed
Like how I didn't stand up for myself
I didn't even try to see the truth
But the truth led to you calling my name

And it shot like an arrow
Into my heart

It took me so long to get here but here I am
(It took me so long I can't believe it)
It took me so long to get here but here I am
(It took me so long but here I am)
Everything I tried and
All the things I dreamed of
(It took me so long I can't believe it)
It took me so long to get here but here I am

All my systems were failing
And it didn't seem fair, no it didn't seem fair
But it made way
For something different
I could feel it in the air, feel it in the air
It took me so long to get here but here I am
(It took me so long I can't believe it)
It took me so long to get here but here I am
(It took me so long but here I am)
Everything I tried and
All the things I dreamed of
(It took me so long I can't believe it)
It took me so long to get here but here I am
It took me so long to get here but here I am
(It took me so long I can't believe it)
It took me so long to get here but here I am
(It took me so long but here I am)
Everything I tried and
All the things I dreamed of
(It took me so long I can't believe it)
It took me so long to get here but here I am

Here I am
Here I am
(It took me so long I can't believe it)
Here I am
(It took me so long but here I am)
