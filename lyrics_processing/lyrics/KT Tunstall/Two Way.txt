If you feel you have time
Come and spend a little bit of it here on my mind
I'll help you if I can
I'll be your woman, baby, I'll be your man

But don't you do what you always do
Close the door on me
The riches here, and they won't last forever

Hide yourself away
Make light of the situation
It's gotta be two way
Or it's never gonna work
Don't do what you say you will
Despite all the conversation
It's gotta be today
Or it's never gonna work

The story has no ending
'Til you decide you can seize your day
Darkness comes descending
But the booze and the cigarettes lightin' way

But don't you do what you always do
And ask for company
I've been there myself and I'm not gonna follow

Hide yourself away
Make light of the situation
It's gotta be two way
Or it's never gonna work
Don't do what you say you will
Despite all the conversation
It's gotta be today
Or it's never gonna work
No it's never gonna work

Don't go silent
Don't go dark
Realize you can come around too
In a natural arc
Don't go silent
Don't go dark
Don't fade away
Don't fade away
Hide yourself away
Make light of the situation
It's gotta be two way
Or it's never gonna, never gonna, never gonna, never gonna work
No, no, no, it's never gonna work

Hide yourself away
Make light of the situation
It's gotta be two way
Or it's never gonna work
No, no, no
Don't do what you say you will
Despite all the conversation
It's gotta be today
Or it's never gonna work

Oh no, it's never gonna work
Woah ooh
No, no, no, no
Never gonna work, ooh
