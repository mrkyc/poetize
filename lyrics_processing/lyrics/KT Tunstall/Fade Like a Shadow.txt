You grew wings on your heart
But you let it out your ribcage
And it flew into the dark
Like a ghost, just like a ghost
And it flutters by my window
When I need my sleep the most

So I choose my weapon and choose my way
It's easy saying nothing when there's nothing to say
I'm thinking about it every day
And starting to notice you're fading away
You fade like a shadow, fade like a shadow
Fade like a shadow, fade
You fade like a shadow, fade like a shadow

You want eyes in your hands
And power in your pocket
As I stop to watch you dance

With your hips swinging, your snake hips swinging
Got your hips swinging, your snake hips swinging
Got your hips swinging, your snake hips swinging, again

Hips swinging, your snake hips swinging
Got your hips swinging, your snake hips swinging
Got your hips swinging, your snake hips swinging
Again and again and again and again

So I choose my weapon and choose my way
It's easy saying nothing when there's nothing to say
I'm thinking about you every day and starting to notice
That it's two steps forward and one step back
I make up in love for what you think I lack
You've got a vampire on your neck
Everybody knows what happens next
You fade like a shadow, fade like a shadow
Fade like a shadow, fade
You fade like a shadow, fade like a shadow

I choose my weapon and choose my way (You fade like a shadow, fade like a shadow, fade like a shadow, fade)
It's easy saying nothing when there's nothing to say
I'm thinking about you every day and starting to notice (You fade like a shadow, fade like a shadow)

(You fade like a shadow, fade like a shadow, fade like a shadow, fade)
