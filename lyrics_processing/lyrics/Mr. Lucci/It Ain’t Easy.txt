Lay your motherfuckin' ass down
Shamike and Pookie take these motherfuckin' bags to they fleak now
We got the cash, hit the gas, 
I can see 'em right up there, make 'em scatter everywhere
Busting shots up in the air
Beware, I'm on parole, and they ain't stopping the three
They gon' have to take my soul before I cop 'em a plea
We done hit for five mill and I ain't droppin' a G
Now this shit done got real, I'm busted on all these police
Now let the ripper release, the one that's crushin' your hope
As I await to give and take, I got you up in my scope
We took the cash from you hoes, in about thirty seconds time
Now it's in my possession so I declare this money mine
We swift with the crimes, we got 'em blind to the movements
Reverse the two clips in your vest, bullets go through them
I got the bag, and if they follow I'ma dump
3.AD watching the  while Mr. Montis take the front

It ain't easy, watch me knock 'em
They can not stop us, watch how we spray
Bustin' at choppas, goin' one hundred down the freeway
Can't understand that these quick niggas off the 
That's how these G's play
It ain't easy, watch me knock 'em
They can not stop us, watch how we spray
Bustin' at choppas, goin' a hundred down the freeway
Can't understand that these quick niggas off the 
That's how these G's play

Well there ain't no stoppin' or pausin'
We on are way to count this cheese
And if you step up in our path
You'll get blown right off your feet
I'm too swift to face defeat
And I'm too rich to slow my roll
So I'm gon' bust and start a ruckus
Get to bombin' on you hoes
I'm too vicious for my foes
I'm the one who blew your safe
I'm the one who brought the gasoline and burnt your fuckin' face
Mr. Concussion, ah shit, law starts bustin'
Hands on your weapon, guns cocked, ready to test 'em
Zone
It's Mr. Montis sent to pick apart their tactics
Decimate the bank alarms, since we left that bitch in fragments
We done got this cash, let's ditch these masks and hit the freeway
Better give us some leeway, and nigga fuck what them law say
Just smash through that barricade, droppin' grenade and cockin' the 
Burnin' rubber, let 'em  the spray, doing eighty  down the one-way
Crooks are causin' mass distraction, just like Pearl Harbor
Got twenty-two laws found dead in this crooked man's slaughter

Smashin' 135 mashin' off, tryna keep straight
Nigga make a right at that stoplight
Huh?
Nah nigga go and hit the freeway
Man, fuck the police chase, let me get to the golden place
Where that  awaits, and brand new plates, so ain't no trace
Street sweepers, and fourty-four , B's my peoples
Rockin' lethal with creatures, and makin' sure there ain't no sequel
I let the heat go, and beat more, releasin' weak souls
Wassup daddy, I see some more, give me the four, and let me bust at em
Rip 'em up slow, from head-to-toe, grippin' my nuts standin'
Flamin' can up in my hand, and niggas gotta keep fannin' to stop burnin' where I'm landin'
Escape from the quick race, with the big face, gotta follow rules quick
All my niggas let two's spit, I ain't goin' for none of that foo shit
I brew shit, work with the rulest, nah who this?
Finna conclude this with two clips, Lucci and them crook boys runnin' through shit
