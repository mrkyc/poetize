Another night coastin sippin playa potion
In the drop top
Me and your lady coastin love and crook motion
Sounds from the ocean
With the boat docked
Playing real not intending to stop
Me and my niggas steady holding it down
Blazing a pound while I'm making them frown
Dallas, Texas be the place where I'm found
Bumping my sound
Twenty inches above the ground
Since I'm a crook I was born to clown
Low down is how I'm doing it now
Cause nigga your peeping I called my puerto rician
Tell him creep in
Do you feel like freaking for the whole weekend?
Flamed james got me geeking
And keeping me speaking
Pimp shit to get the hoes knees weakin'
Don P. is what I'm drinking
Bubbles baths and thinking
Parked the two door benz hopped in the licoln
Now we off in the wind
To deep with four sweets
To the coastin beet slow keep it calm and cool
Rubbing her fingers through my braids trying to set the mood
This lady rolling up the cake while I set the brew
This little trip was only mad for two
So pass the brew
And follow what your master do
I know your nigga are steady asking you
Why all your cats in true
And keep on saying he wanna blast with Luc
Squash that cuz im your pass in true
But ain't no way he can stop my style
Do all the things that will make you smile
Back rubs and hot tubs
Give you rose and huggs
Slow love and pleasure rubs
With your number one thug
I'm not your man but I plan to scuff
So girl whats up?
Lets go and chill fabulous
Turn off my screens in the slab with plus
You back and grabbed the tusk
Cuz the night of the hype is gonna light with us

If I'm riding with my trunk open
If I'm to deep deep choking
If I'm out on slow beet bumpin
Well then you know I'm late night coastin
Everybody wanna hate my style
Well everybody wanna hate me now
I'm going out to my lake beach house
With another niggas naked spouse
If I'm riding with my trunk open
If I'm to deep deep choking
If I'm out on slow beet bumpin
Well then you know I'm late night coastin
Everybody wanna hate my style
Well everybody wanna hate me now
I'm going out to my lake beach house
With another niggas naked spouse
(Mr. Pookie)
See I'm the type of nigga loving this
I want some more crrok lovly shit
I be the quickest one to roll up with the bud
When I roll and twist
Better prepare for the bomb and shit
Because the constant hit
This stoney crook brain
Flossing with a crook chain
Dark tone with a smile
Pick you up at seven it's about five thirty
So I guess it leave a crook nigga just a little while
So I can get clean and shit
With the startched down jeans and shit
Off audelia with the braids
Now she all up on me
She don't wanna get up off me
From the unique smell of my cologne and the cake
Go on and do your thing im the grey star fleight wood
Won't you take a ride with a deep crook
And I know you gonna be trying to look your best
With the trick wood
Try to come around with cheep look
Cuz of acting like a fish hook
I need a lady crook
One to pick a playa up when he fall
Put down a hustle with no regaurds to the law
When she know a few ballas and got the platinum on the mouth
Ball to the mall
Now it's time for the boasting shit
Tell your friends how I bought you this
Don't be worrying about the cost and shit
Cuz any lady that has seen the rippla was a flossing miss
Keep game i'll talk the trick
Right up on the dick
Slurp slurp got me wiggleing toes
Got me feeling like I'm fixing to explode
While she bobbing and boasting
I'll push back her head and she'll take in some more
How you deal with it all on your nose
I mean nut on your close
And i'll be damned if you kiss me girl
I ain't a playa that will lick the pearl
I'm just a crook type playa late coastin in this infra world
(C-Loc)Chorus
If I'm riding with my trunk open
If I'm to deep deep choking
If I'm out on slow beet bumpin
Well then you know I'm late night coastin
Everybody wanna hate my style
Well everybody wanna hate me now
I'm going out to my lake beach house
With another niggas naked spouse
If I'm riding with my trunk open
If I'm to deep deep choking
If I'm out on slow beet bumpin
Well then you know I'm late night coastin
Everybody wanna hate my style
Well everybody wanna hate me now
I'm going out to my lake beach house
(Mr. Lucci)
Hmm now I done did it again
She peeping the seen
And mixing the lean
Shining clean
To my crooked theam
Checking the pictures of my team
Platinum plack shining clean
Living room eurpean
With the movie screen
Pimped out just like a dream
That O.J. sing
A little twink from my queen
I'm sippin on the drink while I'm puffing on the green
I'm trying to debate weather the cherrys or the cream
Unplugged your phone
The pagers gone
Don't take me wrong
I'm trying to bone
Until the break of dawn
If theres a problem then I'm gonna take you home
But if not then I'm gonna make you mone
So girl don't take to long
Drop your keys, chain, shirt, and thong
Now go ahead on and do that shit
Just spread your tricks if you did
Young women when you gripped it
And licked it up so slick
So heres my chain cuz theres no ice up in the fridge
Now handle your biz
Cris-style fiz and siz
On the side of the tele
While I'm giving it to you steady
Un-button down the pele
Your rubbed down with jelly
She lick around the belly
While jaming down to kelly
The unseen is getting sweaty
And heavier than we freak
Up under the sheets
Work till my water bed leaks
She creeps up out the lace
In front of the fire place
She flossing it up in my face
And begin me for a taste
She scoops shakes
And takes it off
In bed and wall
And keeps a nigga dick straight standing tall
I mean I played it so slick from my pants to jaw
When it was time for me to spit she ain't even pause
Just squeezed my balls
Heath and halled
Up in this chick man I don't think I even seen a flaw
She make a nigga wanna ring the law
But cleanest thing of all
I ain't even gotta see her tomorrow
(C-Loc)Chorus
If I'm riding with my trunk open
If I'm to deep deep choking
If I'm out on slow beet bumpin
Well then you know I'm late night coastin
Everybody wanna hate my style
Well everybody wanna hate me now
I'm going out to my lake beach house
With another niggas naked spouse
If I'm riding with my trunk open
If I'm to deep deep choking
If I'm out on slow beet bumpin
Well then you know I'm late night coastin
Everybody wanna hate my style
Well everybody wanna hate me now
