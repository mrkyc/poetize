Then you just might lose your life tonight (Don't say nothing nigga)
My big brother told me
Never let a nigga fuck me (fuck me)

Talkin' all that ho lip

Plottin' schemin' watch me think it up
Now all my mark Crook niggas squeeze and bust

Get up out my face
Quit crowdin' my space
Peepin' me from neck to waist
Knowin' you fakaz
Soft as cakaz
Pushin' Lucci tah cop tha case
Who in tha fuck do you think I be?
What in tha hell do you think you see?
If it ain't treal then it ain't me
Ain't nothin' but G'z about my streets
That's all I know
Clutchin' tha 4-4
And goin' toe foe toe
Straight blow foe blow
Makin' em bleed slow
While us Crooks take control
Me, P-O-O-K-I-E, and Chief
Goin' on a rippin spree
Triple deep
Knockin' these ol' ho ass nigga right up off they feet
As we speed em up
And heat em up
Hollows steadily eat em up
The ones that's thinkin' it's free tah bump
The ones that's shakin' his feet in tha trunk
Talkin' all that nonsense
Fuck around make me bomb bitch
Unless you want tah see me strong arm shit
Keep thinkin' that I'm harmless
I see em everyday
Actin' like they born tah hate
When I'm blowin' my cake
What tha fuck is goin' tah take
Tah let these niggas know
I wasn't born tah play
From tha North of D

AKA
Wig Splitta
Showin' these half steppin' niggas
I'm serious bout my issues
