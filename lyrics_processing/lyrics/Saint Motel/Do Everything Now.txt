Let's all get pregnant and ditch our kids
It doesn't count if it's just the tip
Let's put the con back in consequence
This time is your time, let's get it on, get it on
Grab your neighbor and suck their face
Won't tell your lover, but you love the taste
I'm here to say that your sin's erased
No more worries, you're free (free, free, free)

Do everything now, do everything now
Do everything now, do everything now, right now
Do everything now, do everything now
Do everything now, while we're still young

Sick of waiting, then wait no more
You want some lovin', just buy a whore
And for a threesome, then buy one more
This life is your life, just get it on, let's get it on
The clock is ticking, just make the call
Drag your neighbor to the bathroom stall
Don't spill your milkshake on the dirty floor
No more worries, you're free (free, free, free)

Do everything now, do everything now
Do everything now, do everything now, right now
Do everything now, do everything now
Do everything now, while we're still young
We're still young
We're still young
We're still young

Make me laugh, make me dumb, make me cry, make me come
Make it so we never die, and take the pain away
Make me laugh, make me dumb, make me cry, make me come
Make it so I never die, and take the pain away
Make it hurt, make it sting, make me fly, make me bleed
Make it so we never die, and take the pain away

Do everything now, do everything now
Do everything now, do everything now, right now
Do everything now, do everything now
Do everything now, do everything now, right now
Do everything now, do everything now
Do everything now, do everything now, right now
Do everything now, do everything now
