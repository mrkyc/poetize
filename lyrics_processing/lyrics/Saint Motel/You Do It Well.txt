If night time should come
Before you come back to us here at Great Rock
We'll tell them to hold up, you complete us
You're our only savior since you destroyed our gods

You know us so well
You're brave like a mountain, ah
You fly like an eagle, ah
You do things that we'll never do, uh huh
And you do them well

If sunshine should shine
We'll tell you to wait from us back up in the sky
But know that you'll come back, matter of time
You own all our hearts and souls and you own our minds

You know us so well
You're brave like a mountain, ah
You fly like an eagle, ah
You do things that we'll never do, uh huh
And you do them well
Ah ah ah ah
And you do them well
Ah ah ah ah
And you do them well
Ah ah ah ah
And you do it

Wait for, your emperor, to come back again
Go repent
He's coming
He's our size but he's not just
He's not just a man
So much more he's better
Wait for, your emperor, to come back again
Go repent
He's coming
He's our size but he's not just
He's not just a man
So much more he's better
