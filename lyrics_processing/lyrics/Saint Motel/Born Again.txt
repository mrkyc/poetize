Well, there's no need to be nervous
I'm not dangerous anymore
Yeah, I cleaned up and found Jesus
And he's waiting at the door
Now here's a leaflet, try to read it
You have always been a friend
But when you see me next
Won't recognize the person that I am

I'm born again
Get born, get born, get born again
Get born, get born

Well, there's no use trying to fight it
Cause you fought it long enough
It starts with lies and leads to hate and hate to sex and sex to drugs
Here's the bad news for the sinners
And the solace for the saints
When you break it down, the two of us are really just the same

I'm born again
Get born, get born, get born again
Get born, get born, get born again
I died and saw the light, my friend
Get born, get born, get born, get born
