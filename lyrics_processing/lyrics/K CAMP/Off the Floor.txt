I been gettin' money, I ain't worried 'bout a ho
You better check your bitch 'cause she been creepin' on the low
No matter the occasion I'ma always get the dough
Throw it at the strippers, watch 'em get it off the flo'
I been gettin' money, I been, I been gettin' money
I been gettin' money, I ain't worried 'bout a ho
I been gettin' money, I been, I been gettin' money
I been gettin' money, watch 'em get it off the flo'

I been gettin' money, I ain't worried 'bout a ho
Know niggas with the white, they call it Marilyn Monroe
No need to spit the game because I had her at "Hello"
But she always bitchin' 'cause I'm in the studio
Hopscotch the pussy so you know I'm in and out
I scramble for the cheese like I work at Waffle House
The game needs change and I found it in the couch
I swear these niggas trash, they remind me of the grouch
Hold up, wait a second, I'm gone
I'ma sprint to the bill like a phone
Raise your hand if you gettin' that paper
Or you want that shit like foams
I'ma north side nigga, rep your zone
Fuck your rules, I'm grown
You better check your ho 'cause last night she ain't even come home
You might also like
I been gettin' money, I ain't worried 'bout a ho
You better check your bitch 'cause she been creepin' on the low
No matter the occasion I'ma always get the dough
Throw it at the strippers, watch 'em get it off the flo'
I been gettin' money, I been, I been gettin' money
I been gettin' money, I ain't worried 'bout a ho
I been gettin' money, I been, I been gettin' money
I been gettin' money, watch 'em get it off the flo'

Do you get the picture? I ain't talkin' Instagram
Alley-Oop to Donald and I know he 'bout to slam
I just want to smoke and take a trip to Amsterdam
And hit a couple hoes who pussy just as sweet as yams
Baby, I'm a player but I'm actin' like the coach
Dive inside your water, hit you with the backstroke
Hungry for the green and I ain't talkin' artichoke
I drive these hoes crazy, hope my license ain't revoked
You know these hoes don't love you, they'll fuck you for a check
Then play you like a sucker
Stay on your A game, don't get played like a buster
I'ma always stay true nigga word to my mother

I been gettin' money, I ain't worried 'bout a ho
You better check your bitch 'cause she been creepin' on the low
No matter the occasion I'ma always get the dough
Throw it at the strippers, watch 'em get it off the flo'
I been gettin' money, I been, I been gettin' money
I been gettin' money, I ain't worried 'bout a ho
I been gettin' money, I been, I been gettin' money
