Hey, shawty, what it do? What's happenin'?
Peep the way you move, I can tell you make it happen
I see you walkin' 'round like your feet don't hurt
Shawty just cold like the heat don't work
She independent, you be ballin' on the budget
She ridin' in the flyest, all the real niggas love it
Money makin' mission, she just steady chasin' duckets
Shawty, she ain't playin', she just ballin', Denver Nugget

G5 fly, Lord, oh my
Can't help to stare every time you walk by
You got thang for a nigga, I can see it in your eye
What I gotta do for a piece of pie?
Tell me you feelin' alright
Tryna get with you tonight
I'm with all the shit that you like
I'm with all the shit that you like
You might also like

Baby, just be comfortable
I'll be right here next to you
Baby, just be comfortable
Tell me what you wanna do
Baby, just be comfortable
I'll be right here next to you (Ha, look)

I ain't worried too much 'bout shawty, no
'Cause I know that she be workin'
In her spare time shawty just countin' dough
We all know she's important
Let me know if you gon' ride for a fella
Me and you together super fly like propellers
I let her hold her bag and I told her buy whatever
Get it while it's good 'cause don't nothin' last forever

G5 fly, Lord, oh my
Can't help to stare every time you walk by
You got thang for a nigga, I can see it in your eye
What I gotta do for a piece of pie?
Tell me you feelin' alright
Tryna get with you tonight

I'm with all the shit that you like
Tell me where you wanna go
Tell me what you wanna do
Baby, just be comfortable

Let's be real, you know you're dealin' with a real one
Let's be real, you know you're dealin' with a real one
Let's be real, you know you're dealin' with a real one

I ain't gotta say it, all the pretty bitches want it
When I get the chance I'ma fuck you like I own it
Feel good comin' from a real nigga, don't it?
When we in the bed I just tell her, "Jump up on it"
Remy all wet, fallin' right down your spine
I ain't tryna front, I just want that from behind
Hope you don't mind for the time, girl, you mine
Tell me one more time

Tell me where you wanna go
Tell me what you wanna do
Baby, just be comfortable
