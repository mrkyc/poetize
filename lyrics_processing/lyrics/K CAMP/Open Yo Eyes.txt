Oh, oh, oh
(Ayy, Genius, give 'em that flood, fool)
Skrrt, skrrt

Ayy, I been shootin' dice all day, lil' shawty
You ain't gotta keep callin'
Heard he poppin' shit, baby, he ain't really 'bout it
Baby, he ain't really 'bout it
I just wanna know, wanna know if you a rider
You ain't gotta lie, I won't tell nobody
I'ma keep quiet
Shawty, I'ma keep quiet
Playin' with them bands got you playin' both sides
Baby, open your eyes
I'm a real nigga, baby, I'ma keep quiet
Baby, open your eyes
I'm a real nigga, baby, I'ma keep quiet

Ayy, I'm a real nigga, baby, I'ma stay solid
Every where I go I gotta tote a Glock forty
I don't want no beef with them boys, they informants
In a tee and some Jordans
I know these niggas don't like me and shit
But that's on me, they won't try me and shit
If I go down will you write me and shit?
Do you like me and shit?
I'm pullin' up anytime about you
Like how you look, I be starin' at you
I'll turn you up, I'll put red on your shoe
You look right in them Loub's
Ain't never lonely, I stay with it on me
Kiss on your body, I know that you want it
Can you love me at the same be my homie?
Never let a nigga play with you and I'm on it
And you stay right there
Now I got racks and you still right there
I went to Cali two times on a flight
Might get a crib out there
Hold me so tight 'cause it's real outchea'
Don't give a damn how they feel 'bout you
Ain't gotta cap 'bout a damn thing shawty
I'ma keep it trill 'bout you
Might do a hundred on the highway tryna get to you
Ain't stoppin' for no cars, I swear
Got into it with some lil' niggas 'round the way
Had to look both sides, my lil' shawty right there
I know sometimes I act like I don't care
But you know that I'ma ride for you, girl
I'll get up there right in front of the judge
Don't care 'bout that time when you lied for me girl
Nan' ho better get wrong with lil' shawty
I tote that fire for you, girl
I been gettin' money all day with my woes
Ain't nobody tryin' you, girl
You might also like
Ain't nobody tryin' you, girl
Ain't nobody tryin' you, girl
Ain't nobody tryin' you, girl
Ain't nobody tryin' you, girl

You a real one and I peeped that shit
Might let you meet my bitch
You know a young nigga like to creep and shit
But you the one I creep with
Sex in the morning
Put this dick in while you yawnin'
She say she like my performance
Kissin' what's under your garments
I know it ain't easy
To deal with a nigga like me
She said, "Baby, please me"
The way you talk you can be wifey
Yeah, I know your ex ain't nothin' like me
I'm a real nigga and my life pricey
I swear these ratchet hoes don't excite me
Got stripes like Adidas, checks like Nike
Girl, open your eyes
Don't be surprised
It's a reason why we linked up, girl
This a blessing in disguise
Ayy, I been shootin' dice all day, lil' shawty
You ain't gotta keep callin'
Heard he poppin' shit, baby, he ain't really 'bout it
Baby, he ain't really 'bout it
I just wanna know, wanna know if you a rider
You ain't gotta lie, I won't tell nobody
I'ma keep quiet
Shawty, I'ma keep quiet
Playin' with them bands got you playin' both sides
Baby, open your eyes
I'm a real nigga, baby, I'ma keep quiet
Baby, open your eyes
I'm a real nigga, baby, I'ma keep quiet

Oh, oh, oh
