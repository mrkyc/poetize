I let you count my money, baby (Money)
You one hunnid, so that means you meet my standards, baby
I got a lot of hoes, more than I can handle, baby (Oh)
And I can't even lie, shawty, you my kind of lady
So what you doin' lately?
Let you count my money, baby (Count)
You one hunnid, so that means you meet my standards, baby (Woo)
I got a lot of hoes, more than I can handle, baby
And I can't even lie, shawty, you my kind of lady
And that's one hunnid, baby, just keep it a hunnid, baby
Just keep it a hunnid, baby (Ayy, ayy, yah, look, na-na-na-na)

Ayy, you one hunnid, baby (Ayy)
I'm just tryna figure out just why that nigga hate me
I got money and I throw it with no hesitation
Sneaky bitches, they be schemin' and investigatin'
But I'ma leave 'em waitin', put you in that drop top (Drop)
Pull up in that mothafucka, make your heart stop (Stop)
Lame bitches on the side tryna cock block
I pulled off her panties, next it was the crop top
And I will not stop, tell 'em 'bout our situation
It ain't really hard to tell by all the moves I'm makin' (Ayy)
Takin' all these nigga's bitches, you can say I'm Drakein'
I'm that nigga, you that bitch and ain't no damn mistakin'
So tell me why we waitin'
I let you count my money, baby (Money)
You one hunnid, so that means you meet my standards, baby
I got a lot of hoes, more than I can handle, baby (Oh)
And I can't even lie, shawty, you my kind of lady

And that's one hunnid, baby, just keep it a hunnid, baby (Ayy)
Just keep it a hunnid, baby (Zoovier, 1738, ayy)

The only girl I ever trust is you, baby
All this money I'ma spend with you, baby
I swear I love you but you drive me so crazy
Keep it a hunnid, you gon' run for me, baby
Keep it a hunnid, you is all I see, baby
Keep it a hunnid, throw you a couple G's, baby
Keep it a hunnid, I got what you need, baby
I keep it a hunnid, keep it a hunnid please, baby
Ayy, you ever seen a hunnid G's, baby?
Ayy, pull up with a hunnid G's, baby
Ayy, and they all ready to squeeze, baby
