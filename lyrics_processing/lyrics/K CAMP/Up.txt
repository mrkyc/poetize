I know that she wanna fuck
She took a shot and she goin' up
She wet like jacuzzi
I just wanna make a movie
She don't want me to tell nobody
She won't talk about it, she won't tell nobody
She independent, drive a Mazi
Just take a look at her body
Bend her over, got an arch on her
Quavo moonwalk on her
Fuckin' and smokin' on marijuana
Heard it good for the glaucoma
The pussy mine, I'm the owner
The pussy mine, I'm the owner
Fuckin' at four in the morning
Got her singin' like her name Kelly Rowland (Ayy)
