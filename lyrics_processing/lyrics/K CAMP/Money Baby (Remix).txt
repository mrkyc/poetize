French Montana, Dolla $ign
From the East to the West, respect that grind
Thought we were done but we still in this bitch
And I go by K CAMP and this is the remix

I like smokin' weed, I like gettin' fly
I like havin' sex, I like girls who ride
I like my cup full, I like turnin' up
I like brand new shit, so this is what I love to do
I like that money, baby, money, baby, money, baby
Money, baby, money, baby, money, baby
Gotta have that money, baby, money, baby, money, baby
That's that shit I like (Oh, oh)

Bustin' down, Rollie, you can tell time on it
Ain't no fuck nigga, watch me style on 'em
Put a hundred on your hat, call you bank head
And you can dock a yacht, on a tank head
Money, baby, Teterboro flights to Opa-Locka
Been turning to the max, shout to Wavy Crockett
When they come to the V's got a car lot
Hit Chinx I need a hundred G's, I'm in Far Rock
Get the two dogs for when I piss her off
Don't get too close, walk around with the pistol loaded
Been gettin' money like a car (Haan!)
Coke Boys, ten meals on the diner line
You might also like
I like smokin' weed, I like gettin' fly
I like havin' sex, I like girls who ride
I like my cup full, I like turnin' up
I like brand new shit, so this is what I love to do
I like that money, baby, money, baby, money, baby
Money, baby, money, baby, money, baby
Gotta have that money, baby, money, baby, money, baby
That's that shit I like (Oh, oh)

I like to get my dick sucked while I'm gettin' high
Make her deep throat, her mouth never get dry
I say "Who pussy is this?", she say "Dolla $ign"
Whose pussy is this? She say "Dolla $ign"
She strippin', still got nine-to-five
Say that she's mine but that's a lie
These hoes will tell you anything
She want the money and the fame
South Central niggas really don't be lovin' these hoes
These hoes don't be lovin' these niggas
Really we all just want the money
Money, money, baby, baby, Pusha Ink baby
Said she got blunts, I said, "I only smoke papers"
Come kick it with the Taylors, bunch of gang bangers
Pimps and players, young money makers
I like smokin' weed, I like gettin' fly
I like havin' sex, I like girls who ride
I like my cup full, I like turnin' up
I like brand new shit, so this is what I love to do
I like that money, baby, money, baby, money, baby
Money, baby, money, baby, money, baby
Gotta have that money, baby, money, baby, money, baby
That's that shit I like (Oh, oh)

I like takin' niggas' hoes, but i stopped doing that
Once I hit her with that dick she don't know how to act
Blowin' up a nigga's phone, can you please fall back?
Ayy, lil' ho, leave me alone, I ain't got time for that
I like good weed, I like bad bitches that can roll it up
And a rider that's gon' hold me down no matter what (Stay down)
Sippin' good, so please don't worry 'bout what's in my cup (It's not yours)
And she on them drugs so, yeah, you know she down to fuck
It's goin' down, it's goin' down, it's goin' down, lil' bitch
I'm known to stay one hundred and you counterfeit (I can't fuck with you)
And you ain't with my crew if you ain't tryna get rich (Gotta run that up)
And I'ma dick her down, yeah, she love that shit

I like smokin' weed, I like gettin' fly
I like havin' sex, I like girls who ride
I like my cup full, I like turnin' up
I like brand new shit, so this is what I love to do
I like that money, baby, money, baby, money, baby
Money, baby, money, baby, money, baby
Gotta have that money, baby, money, baby, money, baby
