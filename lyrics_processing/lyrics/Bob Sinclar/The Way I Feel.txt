Every night I sit and wonder why
Is still nobody knows?
And we living in houses of with rows and rows
And it's also hard to see a star
So every night I sit and cry
Every night I sit and wonder
Doesn't anybody want to listen to the way I feel? (it's way that I feel)
Doesn't anybody want to listen to the way I feel inside of me?
Every day I look at you
Every day you look at me
But no ones gonna be
Unless we get it together baby you and me
Coz I never knew love before
And I guess I never will anymore
I never knew love have feelings
So much feelings, now
Doesn't anybody want to listen to the way I feel? (it's way that I feel)
Doesn't anybody want to listen to the way I feel inside of me?
What would you do if it happen to you?
Like it's happen to me
It keeps on happen to me
What would you do if it happen to you?
Like it's happen to me
You might also likeOhhhh you
You got me really really wanting you
Each day just a little bit more
I keep on holding to stop feel evermore
Ohhhh you
You got me really really wanting you
Each day just a little bit more
I keep on holding to stop feel evermore
Every night I sit and cry
Every night I sit and wonder why
Is still nobody knows?
And we living in houses with rows an rows
And yet we so far apart
And it's also hard to see a star
So every night I sit and cry
Every night I sit and wonder why
Coz I never knew love before
And I guess I never will anymore
I never knew love have feelings
So much feelings
Doesn't anybody want to listen to the way I feel? (is the way that I feel)
Doesn't anybody want to listen to the way I feel inside of me?
Doesn't anybody wanna listen to the way I feel?
