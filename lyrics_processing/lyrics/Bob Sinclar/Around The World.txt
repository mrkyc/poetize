Do it how we grew, do it how we flow
Do it how we move, do it how we go
I won't chill no more, it's time that we show
The world where we are!

I wanna take you all around the world
I wanna take you all around the world
I wanna take you all around the world
I wanna take you all around the world
World, world, world, world!
I imagine life a passion
Living above  we find them but
Universe can't hold us
Pushing hard, hard, till we all are out of focus
Looking at me like 'are you joking?'
We are stars, we're above the ocean
Coast away, feel the vibe, day's on, nice alive
We are the reasons we survive
If everyone is even, we like the odds
Get the picture for you collage
Individual lifestyle, do it right now
It's a family affair, cause it took all of us to get here
All over the globe
We wish that you could be here, uh
You might also like
I wanna take you all around the world
I wanna take you all around the world
I wanna take you all around the world
I wanna take you all around the world
World, world, world, world!
Spot lights, we're making a movie night
Red carpet, high life
 no bar fights
Low  cause we're that nights
Hands in the air, we clap twice!
Music, we match like
Hot girls, and hot nights
You know you move the crowd
Living only how we wanna know
Flights where we wanna go
Lunch on the sky, but on the ground for dinner
No excitement, no longer 
Priceless, who pays the life?
Ice in the life, we chill for life
It's the reason  blissfully emotion
 across the globe, you won 
Do it how we grew, do it how we flow
Do it how we move, do it how we go
I won't chill no more, it's time that we show
The world where we are!
I wanna take you all around the world
I wanna take you all around the world
I wanna take you all around the world
I wanna take you all around the world
World, world, world, world!
World, world, world, world!
