Yeahh, c'mon
Working all week, 9 to 5, for my money
So when the weekend comes, I go get live with the honeys
Rolling down the street, I saw this girl and she was pumping
I wink my eye, she got in my ride went to the club, it was jumping
Introduced myself as dogg and she said you're a liar
I said I got it going on baby doll and I'm on fire
I took her to the hotel, she said you're the king
I said be my queen, if you know what I mean
And let us do the wild thing
Wild thing, wild thing, wild thing, wild thing
Please baby, baby, please
Shopping at the mall, looking for some gear to buy
I saw this girl, she rocked my world
And I had to adjust my fly
She looked at me and smiled
And said, you have plans for tonight
I said, hopefully if things go well
I'll be with you tonight
So we journey to her house, one thing led to another
I key the door, we go hit the floor
I looked up and it was her mother
I didn't know what to say, I was hanging by a string
She said, hey you 2, I was once like you
And I like to do the wild thing
You might also likeWild thing, wild thing, wild thing, wild thing
She love to do the wild thing, wild thing
Please baby, baby, please
... in effect, hanging out is always hype
And when me and my crew leave the shit ding
I want a girl who's just my type
I saw this lustious little freak, I ain't lying fellows, she was fine
This ... gave me a kiss and I knew that she was mine
I took her to my limousine, that was still parked outside
I tipped the chauffeur, when it was over
I gave her my own ride
Couldn't get her off my check, he was like static clean
But that's what happens when bodies start slapping
From doing the wild thing
Wild thing
She love to do the wild thing, wild thing
Please baby, baby, please
Wild thing
She wanna do the wild thing, wild thing, wild thing
Wild thing
She wanna do the wild thing, wild thing, wild thing
Wild thing, wild thing, wild thing, wild thing
She wanna do the wild thing, wild thing, wild thing
Please baby, baby, please
Wild thing
Say what? you love me, you must be kidding
You walking baby, just break out of here
Asta la vista baby, I'm not paying for nothing
