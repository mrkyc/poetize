Hold your drink up, lets us get wild
We came to party Miami style
We are people, go all the way, get on the floor it's time to bring
Always a good time to celebrate, so grab somebody and dance the night away
We came to party, keys in the car
I need to refill, go to the bar
We came to get down, down to the floor
I need to refill just get me some more wowowooooo
Give me some more wowowooooo
Give me some more, some more some more
So hold your drink up don't spill a drop
Don't want this music to ever stop
This partys jumping you can't deny so put your rimee up to the sky
Always a good time to celebrate, so grab somebody and dance the night away
We came to party, keys in the car
I need to refill, go to the bar
We came to get down, down to the floor
I need to refill just get me some more wowowooooo
Give me some more wowowooooo
Jump to the front jump to the back slide to the left and wiggle with your right
I wanna see you move it move it
I wanna see you shake it grove it
Bump with your bump and grind with your grind
Listen to the music let it get you winde up
If I get on the floor turn it up give me some more
Mamasita; senorita; get on the floor get out your seeta
For the ragda let the music pick you up you better use it
Bootcha basa bona dema
Let the man review your dream, you go back to the floor
Dip down and give me some more
