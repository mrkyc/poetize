Call it love and devotion
Call it a mom's adoration, foundation
A special bond of creation, ha
For all the single moms out there
Goin' through frustration
Clean Bandit, Sean da Paul
Anne-Marie, sing, make them hear

She works the nights by the water
She's gone astray, so far away
From her father's daughter
She just wants a life for her baby
All on her own, no one will come
She's got to save him (Daily struggle)

She tells him, "Ooh, love
No one's ever gonna hurt you, love
I'm gonna give you all of my love
Nobody matters like you" (Stay up there, stay up there)
She tells him, "Your life
Ain't gon' be nothin' like my life (Straight)
You're gonna grow and have a good life
I'm gonna do what I've got to do" (Stay up there, stay up there)
