Wakes up early, walks herself to work
She's all alone from 8 to 5, yeah
Keeps her eyes down, doesn't say too much
And all her colleagues think she's shy
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Watching the clock on the wall
Watching the clock on the wall, yeah
Watching the city go dark
Goes home and takes it all off, yeah
And pours up a couple of shots
She does it so well
As soon as she walks out the door
Turns into someone else

She only comes out at night
She only comes out at night
She only comes out at night (Only comes out now)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
She only comes out at night
I'm watching her come to life
She only comes out at night (Only comes out now)

Hey, baby girl is so nocturnal
The fire in her eyes burning brighter than inferno
The dimple in her thighs got me writing in my journal
Let her know
That this is forever just like my words are eternal, yeah
Fruitful and fertile thoughts
But us gone take it slow like the way a turtle walks
Or speed it up if she want that pussy outlined in chalk
Yeah boi, mm-hmm
