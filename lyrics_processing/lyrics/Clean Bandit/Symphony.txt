I've been hearin' symphonies
Before, all I heard was silence
A rhapsody for you and me
And every melody is timeless
Life was stringin' me along
Then you came and you cut me loose
Was solo, singin' on my own
Now I can't find the key without you

And now your song is on repeat
And I'm dancin' on to your heartbeat
And when you're gone, I feel incomplete
So if you want the truth

I just wanna be part of your symphony
Will you hold me tight and not let go?
Symphony
Like a love song on the radio
Will you hold me tight and not let go?

I'm sorry if it's all too much (Oh)
Every day you're here, I'm healin' (Oh)
And I was runnin' outta luck (Oh)
I never thought I'd find this feelin' (Oh)
'Cause I've been hearin' symphonies
Before, all I heard was silence (Oh)
A rhapsody for you and me (A rhapsody for you and me)
And every melody is timeless
You might also like
And now your song is on repeat
And I'm dancin' on to your heartbeat
And when you're gone, I feel incomplete
So if you want the truth

I just wanna be part of your symphony
Will you hold me tight and not let go?
Symphony
Like a love song on the radio
Will you hold me tight and not let go?

Ah, ah, ah, ah-ah-ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah-ah-ah, ah, ah, ah

And now your song is on repeat
And I'm dancin' on to your heartbeat
And when you're gone, I feel incomplete
So if you want the truth (Oh)

I just wanna be part of your symphony
Will you hold me tight and not let go?
Symphony (Ooh)
Like a love song on the radio (Oh)
Symphony
Will you hold me tight and not let go?
Symphony
Like a love song on the radio
