In the quiet of my room
I gather up my thoughts and questions
Could I ever be like you?
Could I ever be a person, so real and so true?
It seems implausible
I look at my reflection
If only I could say
The things I never mention
The things you never knew

And I'd like to thank you for the human I've become
I'm sorry if I've let you down
I'm trying, I'm learning as I stumble along
To see this new world without your eyes

Once upon a time there was a girl who so much loved the world
She have her only begotten sunshine
And dried her stained eyes on a neck tie
Took the best lies made 'em truths
And spit sad soliloquies in the booth
Cause people think they know but they barely knew
The reality of what the other-siders do
But I've been there, I've learnt that
Seen a whole bunch of world and done came back
Got a reckoning for wrecking in my knapsack
'Bout to journey on foot through the outback
GRRRL PRTY is the label on my snapback
Doin' worldwide shows in a black hat
'Bout to tell your ass a story so take that
Free prophecies from a black cat

Seen his demise with a pair of brand new eyes
It was sickening, guy
Never wanted to be stickin' it to thickening thighs
But now he deeper than the secrets that he keep with a lie
"Mm, tastes good!" baby say with a cry
Now wait...
Thinkin' about it too much, too much
Deepen the profit sooner, sooner
He never wanted to be a loser
But the bruises of losing is oozing through his fingers
The tips that like to brush at my hips
Is now at the hilt of a sword, Lord
On the battlefield, torn, sworn
To never think about another lover
Hopin' he had time to recover but nothing's ever easy
Beware the sting of queen bee (grr!)

And I'd like to thank you for the human I've become
I'm sorry if I've let you down
I'm trying, I'm learning as I stumble along
To see this new world without your eyes

So many things in he I would like to be
Wiser, more light on my feet
I could look up in the mirror and change me
Or right over my shoulder and save me
Thinkin' about back, back when, when I ain't have nothing
Not a thing or a ring to my name
Now my feet in the game, knee deep, don't speak
Feelin' like Gwen Stefani in this thing
But I can't complain cause we asked for this
Feelin' like a workaholic or a masochist
Don't call like I should like its sacrilege
To make a dollar in a dream into packed venues
Take a second, put your shield down
Laying down my sword, getting off the battlefield now
Makin' bigger moves, bigger pictures in my view now
Get up out of my way I've got ammo for days, pow!
I can feel the weight of wars you've lost
They're victories in my eyes
Every swing you take brings me closer and closer
Open the gates and I'm poised to charge
You told me we'd never get this far
Now we at the final round
There's no way we'll escape battle scars
Battle scars
And I'd like to thank you for the human I've become
I'm sorry if I've let you down
I'm trying, I'm learning as I stumble along
