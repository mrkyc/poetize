I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
I ain't wearin' na nada
I'm sittin' pretty, impatient, but I know you gotta
Put in them hours, I'mma make it hotter
I'm sending pic after picture, I'mma get you fired
I know you're always on the night shift
But I can't stand these nights alone
And I don't need no explanation
'Cause, baby, you're the boss at home

You don't gotta go to work, work, work, work, work, work, work
But you gotta put in work, work, work, work, work, work, work
You don't gotta go to work, work, work, work, work, work, work
Let my body do the work, work, work, work, work, work, work, work
Yeah, yeah
We can work from home, oh, oh, oh oh
We can work from home, oh, oh, oh oh

I gotta get through this
I gotta get through this
I gotta make, gotta make, gotta make it through this
Said, I'm gonna get through this
I'm gonna get through this
I gotta take, gotta take, gotta take my mind off of you
Give me just a second, and I'll be all right
Surely, one more moment couldn't break my heart
Give me 'til tomorrow, and I'll be okay
Just another day, and then I'll hold you tight

When your love is pouring like the rain
I close my eyes, and it's gone again
When will I get the chance to say "I love you?"
I pretend that you're already mine
Now my heart ain't breaking every time I look into your eyes
When your love is pouring like the rain
I close my eyes, and it's gone again
When will I get the chance to say "I love you?"
I pretend that you're already mine
Now my heart ain't breaking every time I look into your eyes

You don't gotta go to work, work, work, work, work, work, work
But you gotta put in work, work, work, work, work, work, work
You don't gotta go to work, work, work, work, work, work, work
Let my body do the work, work, work, work, work, work, work, work
We can work from home, oh, oh, oh-oh
We can work from home, oh, oh, oh-oh
You don't gotta go to work, work, work, work, work, work, work
But you gotta put in work, work, work, work, work, work, work
You don't gotta go to work, work, work, work, work, work, work
Let my body do the work, work, work, work, work, work, work, work
We can work from home, oh, oh, oh-oh
We can work from home, oh, oh, oh-oh
Yeah, we can work from home
Yeah, we can work from home
