I never said any of this was gonna be simple
But sometimes all it takes is just a symbol
Because the place you want to reach is right in front of you
You're getting stronger, so just keep on that but longer
Ra pa pum

Girl come over, mi want you closer, tired of the rainy days
You bring me sun sun sun sunshine
You bring me sun sun sun sunshine
So before the night over I want you to know that I'm willing to change my ways
You bring me sun sun sun sunshine
You bring me sun sun sun sunshine

Come over, come over, come over, come come over
Come over, come over, come over, come come over

I guess you're gonna run out of luck, love, sooner or later
You better make time to sit down and put pen to paper
Because the things you want to do will slip away from you
It won't be long now, so just keep on being strong now
Ra pa pum

A regular she blow my mind
Nah tell no lie mi can't live without you, without you
Girl you got me weak in my knees
Seven days of the week mi can't stop think about you, about you

Come over, come over, come over, come come over
(Sun sun sun sunshine)
(Sun sun sun sunshine)
Come over, come over, come over, come come over
(Sun sun sun sunshine)
(Sun sun sun sunshine)

Look how much time mi tell you say mi sorry girl
About time now fi you spend the night over
80 days past and mi nu see you girl
Baby make we move on cause the fight over
Regular she cuss me
Tell her friend dem bout she nu trust me

Hold heap of questions mi a go ask you
Baby mi love you why you a go on so?
Now you show off a bag man want you
(Ra pa pum)
