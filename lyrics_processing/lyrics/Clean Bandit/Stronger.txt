People tell me to be cautious
People tell me not to lose my self-control
People tell me to be flawless
People tell me not to let myself evolve

And I think I don't really get it
I think it's all just a peculiar game
And soon I'll wake up and I'll forget it
And everyone will know me by a different name

I wanted to be stronger (Stronger)
I wanted to be everything for you
If I could be stronger, would you believe
That I could love you like you want me to?

Gotta be stronger for you, baby
Love you like you want me to
Gotta be stronger for you, baby
Love you like you want me to

I held my breath every time
I tried to keep myself dry
But did I ask too much (No, no, no)
If I could do it again
Would you believe what I said?
That I still want that rush
You might also like
And I think I don't really get it
I think it's all just a peculiar game
And soon I'll wake up and I'll forget it
And everyone will know me by a different name

I wanted to be stronger (Stronger)
I wanted to be everything for you (Every little thing for you)
If I could be stronger, would you believe
That I could love you like you want me to?

Gotta be stronger for you, baby
I wanna be strong for you (I wanna be strong for you)
Love you like you want me to, you like you want me to
I wanna be strong for you
Love you like you want me to

I wanna be strong for you
And I can (I can), yes, I can (Yes, I can)
If only you can promise that you will try too
I'll be there, I'll be there
I wanna be strong for you (Woo, yeah)
If only you can promise that you will try too
I'll be there (Yeah), I'll be there (Oh)
I wanted to be stronger (Stronger)
I wanted to be everything for you (Every little thing for you)
If I could be stronger, would you believe
That I could love you like you want me to?
I wanted to be stronger (Yeah, ooh)
I wanted to be everything for you (Every little thing)
If I could be stronger, would you believe
That I could love you like you want me to? (Woo, uh)

Love you like you want me to (And love me like you want me to)
Love you like you want me to
Love you like you want me to (And love me like you want me to)
