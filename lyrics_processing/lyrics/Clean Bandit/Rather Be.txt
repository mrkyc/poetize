Oh-oh, oh, oh, ah

We're a thousand miles from comfort
We have travelled land and sea
But as long as you are with me
There's no place I'd rather be
I would wait forever
Exalted in the scene
As long as I am with you
My heart continues to beat

With every step we take, Kyoto to the bay
Strollin' so casually
We're different and the same, gave you another name
Switch up the batteries

If you gave me a chance, I would take it
It's a shot in the dark, but I'll make it
Know with all of your heart, you can't shame me
When I am with you, there's no place I'd rather be

No, no, no, no, no, no place I'd rather be
No, no, no, no, no, no place I'd rather be
No, no, no, no, no, no place I'd rather be (Ooh, ooh)
You might also like
We staked out on a mission
To find our inner peace
Make it everlasting
So nothing's incomplete
It's easy being with you
Sacred simplicity
As long as we're together
There's no place I'd rather be

With every step we take, Kyoto to the bay
Strollin' so casually
We're different and the same, gave you another name
Switch up the batteries (Yeah)

If you gave me a chance, I would take it
It's a shot in the dark, but I'll make it
Know with all of your heart, you can't shame me
When I am with you, there's no place I'd rather be

No, no, no, no, no, no place I'd rather be
No, no, no, no, no, no place I'd rather be
No, no, no, no, no, no place I'd rather be
When I am with you, there's no place I'd rather be, yeah
Be
Ooh, ooh
Be, be, be, be, be, be, be, be, be
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah (Ooh, yeah)

If you gave me a chance, I would take it
It's a shot in the dark, but I'll make it
Know with all of your heart, you can't shame me
When I am with you, there's no place I'd rather be

No, no, no, no, no, no place I'd rather be (Be)
No, no, no, no, no, no place I'd rather be
No, no, no, no, no (No), no place I'd rather be
