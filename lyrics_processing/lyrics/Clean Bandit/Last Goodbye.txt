I raise my voice, you slam the door
I don't let up 'til your heart's on the floor
Losing our minds, scream and we shout
'Til we forget what we fighting about
Turns me into a monster
We're no good for each other
Lying in bed, miles apart
We're side by side and alone in the dark

There's no going back
Back to when things were easy
But there's something that I'd like to do
Right before you leave me

If this really is the end
Then why don't you please come back to bed
Come on and spend the night
And let's say our last goodbye
Baby don't walk away
Don't wanna remember you this way
Come on and spend the night
And let's say our last goodbye
You might also like
I twist the knife, I know it hurts
It's time to stop boy we both make it worse
Tossing and turns, you get no sleep
I speculate on the secrets you keep
Turn him into a monster
We're no good for each other
We should be done, both of us know
Deep down the truth is we're better alone

There's no going back
Back to when things were easy
But there's something that I'd like to do
Right before you leave me

Mek we just cry and have a likke kiss
Spring the g-string
Forget about the phone when I ring
Lovin' at the backseat, you deh pon mi
I will not forget anything
Den we hear the knock and the guns go pow
It's been only 50 seconds
I've been all up on you now
It's so sad to see that we couldn't be all up in the clouds
And it's the last time I'll be all up in your mouth (Yeah)
The ting went off we no fly we no shy we nah cry
There's no going back
Back to when things were easy
But there's something that I'd like to do
Right before you leave me

If this really is the end
Then why don't you please come back to bed
Come on and spend the night
And let's say our last goodbye
Baby don't walk away
Don't wanna remember you this way
Come on and spend the night
