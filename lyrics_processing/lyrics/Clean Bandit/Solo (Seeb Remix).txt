Leave you hurtin'
Leave you hurtin'
Leave you hurtin'
I do it solo

I never meant to leave you hurtin'
I never meant to do the worst thing
Not to you
'Cause every time I read your message
I wish I wasn't one of your exes
Now I'm the fool

Since you've been gone
I've been dancing on my own
There's boys up in my zone
But they can't turn me on
'Cause baby you're
The only one I'm coming for
I can't take no more
No more, no more

I wanna f-woop, woop woop, but I'm broken hearted
Cr-cr-cry, but I like to party
T-t-touch, but I got nobody
Here on my own
I wanna f-woop, woop woop, but I'm broken hearted
Cr-cr-cry since the day we parted
T-t-touch, but I got nobody
So I do it solo

Leave you hurtin'
Leave you hurtin'
Leave you hurtin'
I do it solo
Leave you hurtin'
Leave you hurtin'
Leave you hurtin'
Can't do it solo
Leave you hurtin'
Leave you hurtin'
Leave you hurtin'
I do it solo
Leave you hurtin'
Leave you hurtin'
Leave you hurtin'
I do it solo

Every single night I lose it
I can't even hear the music
Without you
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Try to stop myself from calling
But I really wanna know if you're with
Someone new
Since you've been gone
I've been dancing on my own
There's boys up in my zone
But they can't turn me on (can't turn me on)
'Cause baby you're
The only one I'm coming for
I can't take no more
No more, no more

I wanna f-woop, woop woop, but I'm broken hearted
Cr-cr-cry, but I like to party
T-t-touch, but I got nobody
Here on my own (Here on my own)
I wanna f-woop, woop woop, but I'm broken hearted
Cr-cr-cry since the day we parted
T-t-touch, but I got nobody
So I do it solo

Leave you hurtin'
Leave you hurtin'
Leave you hurtin'
I do it solo
Leave you hurtin'
Leave you hurtin'
Leave you hurtin'
Can't do it solo
Leave you hurtin'
Leave you hurtin'
Leave you hurtin' (can't do it on my own)
I do it solo
Leave you hurtin'
Leave you hurtin'
Leave you hurtin'
I do it solo
I wanna f-woop, woop woop, but I'm broken hearted
Cr-cr-cry, but I like to party
T-t-touch, but I got nobody
Here on my own
I wanna f-woop, woop woop, but I'm broken hearted
Cr-cr-cry since the day we parted
T-t-touch, but I got nobody
