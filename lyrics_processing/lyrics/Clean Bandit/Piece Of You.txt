I get delirious, what am I meant to do?
So many hours praying for you, so many things to prove
You can't be serious?, the moment that we're cool
The day that I've been waiting for now it's all eyes on you

'Cause everybody wants to get some of the action
Everyone with half a mind sees your attraction
I'm not usually the type to follow fashion
I can't help it

Everybody wants a piece of you
I know, I know
That everybody wants a piece of you
I know, I know
That everybody wants a piece of you
I know, I know, ooh ooh-ooh-ooh
You
I know, I know
That everybody wants a piece of you

I gave my heart away, I put it down for you
Believed the lies you told me
How I wished that they were true
But I knew all along, it wouldn't be my time
But I could not move on and now I'm waiting in the line
You might also like
'Cause everybody wants to get some of the action
Everyone with half a mind sees your attraction
I'm not usually the type to follow fashion
I can't help it

Everybody wants a piece of you
I know, I know
That everybody wants a piece of you
I know, I know
That everybody wants a piece of you
I know, I know, ooh ooh-ooh-ooh
You
I know, I know
That everybody wants a piece of you

And I know what they want
'Cause you know what they like
You give it to them every time
'Cause everybody wants to get some of the action
Everyone with half a mind sees your attraction
I'm not usually the type to follow fashion
I can't help it
Everybody wants a piece of you
I know, I know (ooh ooh-ooh-ooh)
Everybody wants a piece of you (oh-oh woah)
I know, I know
Ooh ooh-ooh-ooh
Everybody wants a piece of you
I know, I know, ooh ooh-ooh-ooh (I know)
Ooh ooh-ooh-ooh
Everybody wants a piece of you
