I'm out of your control
There's nowhere left to hide
Packed my bags at midnight
And leave this mess behind
Me, myself and I
Have read between the lines
Left the engine runnin'
I guess this is goodbye

And you're never gonna change my mind
We've been here about a thousand times
Should've never let you back inside
Inside my mind

Should've known better than to let you break my heart
I should've known better, I believed you from the start
I should've known better, and now we wasted all this time
I should've known better, so I'm taking back my life

Should've known better than that
Ah, better
Should've known better than that
Ah, better
I should've known better than that
You might also like
Looking back, I know
You had me hypnotized
Since I've got my senses
I see right through your lies
Now you're on your own
You call me every night
You're looking through our photos, but I deleted mine

And you're never gonna change my mind
We've been here about a thousand times
Should've never let you back inside
Inside my mind

Should've known better than to let you break my heart
I should've known better, I believed you from the start
I should've known better, and now we wasted all this time
I should've known better, so I'm taking back my life

Should've known better than that
Ah, better
Should've known better than that
Ah, better
I should've known better than that
(Should've known, should've known, ah)
(Should've known, should've known, better)
(Should've known, should've known)
I should've known better than that
(Should've known, should've known, ah)
(Should've known, should've known, better)
(Should've known, should've known)
Mhm, mhm, mhm
Finally I've opened up my eyes
Why'd it take so long to see the light?
Now I'm gonna leave your ass behind

And you're never gonna change my mind
We've been here about a thousand times
Should've never let you back inside
Inside my mind

I should've known better than to let you break my heart
I should've known better, I believed you from the start
I should've known better, and now we wasted all this time
I should've known better, so I'm taking back my life

I should've known better than that
(Should've known, should've known, ah)
(Should've known, should've known, better)
(Should've known, should've known)
I should've known better than that
(Should've known, should've known, ah)
(Should've known, should've known, better)
(Should've known, should've known)
