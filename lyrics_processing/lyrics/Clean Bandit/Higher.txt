(I love you)

Under my skin, under my skin
Got me strugglin'
Don't know where you end and where I begin
And we feel incredible, we feel no pain
You got me feelin' insane, got me strugglin'
Don't know where you end and where I begin

Had my head underwater
Had my mind under covers
Had my faith in the gutter
Underwater, water, water, water, water, oh

But when you look at me
I'm higher, higher, higher
Eyes on me
I'm higher, higher, higher
Nothing matters at all
When I see you with your
Eyes on me
I'm higher, higher, higher
You might also like
Higher, higher, higher
Higher, higher, higher

Huh (I love you)
I'ma pop out with her, no lie
I'ma get her wet, oh baby we slide
Head in the clouds when I look in your eyes
I don't got a doubt on the back of my mind
That you got it, got it, got it all (Got it, got it, got it all)
And you know it's you that drives me crazy (Know it's you that drives me crazy)

Had my head (Had my head) underwater (Underwater)
Had my mind (Had my mind) under covers (Undercover)
Had my faith (My faith) in the gutter (In the gutter)
Underwater, water, water, water, water, oh (Water, water)

But when you look at me
I'm higher, higher, higher
Eyes on me
I'm higher, higher, higher
Nothing matters at all
When I see you with your
Eyes on me
I'm higher, higher, higher
Higher, higher, higher
Higher, higher, higher

Had my head underwater
Had my mind undercover
Had my faith in the gutter
Underwater, water, water, water, water

But when you look (You look) at me (At me)
I'm higher, higher, higher
Eyes (Your eyes) on me (On me)
I'm higher, higher, higher
Nothing matters at all
When I see you with your
Eyes on me
I'm higher, higher, higher

Higher, higher, higher
Higher, higher, higher
