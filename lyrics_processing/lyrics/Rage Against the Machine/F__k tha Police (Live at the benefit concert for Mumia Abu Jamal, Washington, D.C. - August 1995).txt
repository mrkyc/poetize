Good evening
We want to just quickly send a nice friendly message to the, uh, Fraternal Order of Police in Philadelphia
Here's something nice and friendly
Here's something nice and friendly
Here's something nice and friendly
It goes a little something like this

Fuck the police comin' straight out the underground
A young nigga got it bad 'cause I'm brown
And not the other color, so police think
They have the authority to kill a minority
Fuck that shit, 'cause I ain't the one
For a punk motherfucker with a badge and a gun
To be beaten on and thrown in jail
We can go toe-to-toe in the middle of a cell
Fuckin' with me 'cause I'm a teenager
With a little bit of gold and a pager
Searchin' my car...
... is sellin' narcotics
You'd rather see me in the pen
Than me and Lorenzo chillin' in a Benz-o
... out of shape
And when I'm finished, bring the yellow tape
To mark off the scene of the slaughter
Still getting swole off bread and water...
A young nigga on the warpath
And when I'm finished, know there's gonna be a bloodbath
Of cops dying in L.A
Yo, I got something to say
You might also like
Fuck the police, come on, uh, what
Fuck the police, yeah, come on
Fuck the police, yeah

Fuck the police comin' straight out the underground
A young nigga got it bad 'cause I'm brown
And not the other color, so police think
They have the authority to kill a minority
Fuck that shit, 'cause I ain't the one
For a punk motherfucker with a badge and a gun
To be beaten on and thrown in jail
We can go toe-to-toe in the middle of a cell
Fuckin' with me 'cause I'm a teenager
With a little bit of gold and a pager
Searchin' my car, lookin' for the product
Thinkin' every nigga is sellin' narcotics
You'd rather see me in the pen
Than me and Lorenzo chillin' in a Benz-o
... out of shape
And when I'm finished, bring the yellow tape
To mark off the scene of the slaughter
Gonna get swole off bread and water
I don't know if they fags or what
Search a nigga down and grabbing his nuts
And on the other hand, without a gun, they can't get none
But don't let it be a black and a white one
'Cause they'll slam ya down to the street top
Black police showing out for the white cop
Yeah, this brother will swarm
On any motherfucker in a blue uniform
Just 'cause we in Washington D.C
Punk police are afraid of me, word
Brother on the warpath
When I'm gonna finish, it's gonna be a bloodbath
Of cops dying in L.A
Ayo, we got something to say
Fuck the police
Come on, sing that shit loud, come on
Come on, one more time, here we go, here we go
Come on, one more, we gotta do it right now, come on
