Hey, don't miss out on what you're passing
You're missing the hootah of the funky Buddha
Eluder of the fucked up styles that get wicked
So come on as I start to kick it
'Cause we're like the outlaws striding, suckers are hiding
Jump behind the bush when they see me driving by
Hanging out my window
And my magnum taking out some putos
Acting kinda loco, I'm just another local kid
From the street getting paid for my vocals
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man

Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand

I've been doin' all the dumb shit, yo, because nothin' is coming from it
I'm not gonna waste no time fucking around, I got ya humming
Hummin', comin' at ya
Then you know I had to gat ya
Time for some action, just a fraction of friction (Uh)
I got the clearance to run the interference
Into your satellite, shining a battle light
Swing out the gat, and I know that we'll gat you right
Here's an example, just a little sample
How I could just kill a man
One time tried to come in my home
Take my chrome, I said, "Yo, it's on
Take cover, son, or you're assed out
How'd you like my chrome?" Then I watched the rookie pass out
Didn't have to blast him but I did anyway
Hahahahaha, young punk had to pay
So I just killed the man

It's gonna be a long time before I finish
One of the many missions that I have to establish
To light my spliff, ignite you with insights and
If you ain't down, bullshit

Say some punk tried to get you for your auto
Would you call the one time and play the role model?
No, I think you'll play like a thug
Next, hear the shot of a magnum slug
Humming, coming at ya
Yeah, you know I'm gonna gat ya
How do you know where I'm at
When you haven't been where I've been?
Understand where I'm coming from
When you're up on the hill in your big home
I'm out here risking my dome
Just for a bucket, or a fast ducat
Just to stay alive, yo, I gotta say, "Fuck it"
Here is something you can't understand
