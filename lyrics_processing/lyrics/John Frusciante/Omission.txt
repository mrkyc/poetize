Omit myself (Take myself from your eyes)
Omit myself (Take myself from your eyes)
Omit myself (Take myself from your eyes)

Omit myself as a favor for God
(All my rights are everyone's enemy)
Suffer fate 'cause it's the only lift you've got
(All my rights are everyone's enemy)
Dedicating all of before to now
(All my rights are everyone's enemy)
Emphasizing these things you won't allow

Never now we need the other

Going nowhere (Take myself from your eyes)

Going nowhere's the only clear shot
(All my rights are everyone's enemy)
