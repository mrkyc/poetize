For the love of Christ
I don't need ice to leave you froze
Turn your brains to toothpaste
And squeeze till it blows
Grim Reaper with rap flows
Rap's a trap, those attack
Foes who lack respect get head cracked (oh!)
Survive with the movement
Madness, domestic abusin'
Extortion, Organized Konfusion
Teenage abortion, tossed and forced to prostitution
9/11 distorted the law's proportion
We was one unit (word)
Now we back to bein' monkeys in mosh pits
Drama and mayhem, soon as the dark sits
Spark the heart, Bacardi dart
La Di Da Di inside
The Maserati dog, respect the art
Black Maxwell Smart
With special effects that light up your heart
Me and the mic is like the bite of a shark
Ignite, and blow ya bullshit
Right off the chart
Out the hood, most misunderstood
I gotta stay sharp
Remarkable with this modern day art
Po's the soldier from Rosewood
Vanilla dutch, touch that's so hood
Blaze like blueberry haze
You know how we roll in these last days
Smash cats with the raps but the cash stays
The dense Poe
Spittin' that '89 crack flow
Tap ho
Bounce out the back do'
But not without his gat tho'
Danger Mouse came with that bent back
The Ben Grimm track
Get back, Po

Hmm..
Is that so?
The first Hip Hop chat show
Whoever talk slick get they lip popped by Fatso
Bum, feel the sting linger
Wrote this humdinger with a dislocated bling finger
Still king of the hill, it's the DOOM hour
When he came to spit more gibberish than Boomhauer, mayne
Wigs'll bleed with the quick speed
Drag 'em backstage like the tiger nigga did Siegfried
Caught a deal on a sawed off
Bought off, suit and shells
And a hood shit
Just to ward off the groupie-males
Most will boast that his flows is coastal
I hope he get on the mic and don't go postal
But keep it blissful, it's wishful thinkin'
Piss full of drinkin', fistful of Lincolns
Pistol full of lead with one in the head
And a fan base that spread from the unborn to undead
Dunn said, terror alert high
Dress code when it's stress mode, it's shirt and tie
A certain guy told her ignore the mask
A flirt in a skirt to make you beg for the ass
Baby got back, maybe got black
In a stranger house, Danger Mouse gave 'em hot tracks
Aks'd him could he bark on the beat and spark Cali
