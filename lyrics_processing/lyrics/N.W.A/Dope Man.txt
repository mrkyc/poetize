Yo man, what you need?
Yo, uh man, I need something, man
I need a twenty, man
Then what you got, man?
Ayy, I got this rope chain, man
Man, this shit look like a gold on a roll shit from the swap meet (Man, what the fuck is that, man?)
Who the fuck at the door?
It's real, man, it's real
This shit ain't real, man (That nigga sellin' that shit again, man?)
You better get the fuck outta here and come back with some money, man
C'mon man, be cool, man
Y'all Mexicans always come with this shit
Yo Dre, kick in the bass!

Ooh, that's funky, that's funky
Like nine cans of shaving powder, that's funky
Come on with it again, fellas

It was once said by a man who couldn't quit
"Dopeman, please can I have another hit?"
The dope man said, "Cluck, I don't give a shit
If your girl kneel down and suck my dick"
It all happened and the guy tried to choke her
Nigga didn't care, she ain't nothing but a smoker
That's the way it goes, that's the name of the game
Young brother getting over by slanging 'caine
Gold around his neck in 14K heaven
Bitches clocking on his dick 24/7
Plus he's making money, keep the base heads waiting
Rollin' '64 with the fresh-ass Daytons
Living in Compton, California, CA
His Uzi up your ass if he don't get paid
Nigga begging for credit, he's knocking out teeth
Clocking much dollars on the first and fifteenth
Big wad of money, nothing less than a twenty
Yo, you want a five-oh? The dope man's got plenty
To be a dope man, boy, you must qualify
Don't get high off your own supply
From a ki' to a G, it's all about money
Ten piece for ten, base pipe comes free
And people out there not hip to the fact
If you see somebody getting money for crack, he's the

Dope man, dope man
Hey man, give me a hit
Dope man, dope man
Yo man, fuck that shit
Dope man, dope man
We just can't quit
Dope man, dope man
Well, suck this, bitch

Wait a minute, wait a minute, who the fuck are you talking to?
Do you know who the fuck I am?
Man, I can't believe this shit, this bitch is trying to gank me
Yo, I'll slap you upside your head with nine inches of limp dick

You need a nigga with money, so you get a dope man
Juice that fool for as much as you can
She likes his car and he get with her
Got a black eye 'cause the dope man hit her
Let that slide and you pay it no mind
Fine that he's slapping you all the time
But that's okay, 'cause he's so rich
And you ain't nothing but a dope man's bitch
Do what he say and you keep your mouth shut
Popping that trash might get you fucked up
Will sit and cry if the dope man strike you
He don't give a fuck, he got two just like you
There's a another girl in the dope man's life
Not quite a bitch, but far from a wife
She's called the strawberry and everybody know
Strawberry, strawberry is the neighborhood ho
Do anything for a hit or two
Give the bitch a rock, she'll fuck the whole damn crew
It might be your wife and it might make you sick
Come home and see her mouth on the dope man's dick
Strawberry, just look and you'll see her
But don't fuck around, she'll give you gonorrhea
And people out there are not hip to the fact
That strawberry is a girl selling pussy for crack to the
Dope man, dope man
Hey man, give me a hit
Dope man, dope man
Yo man, fuck that shit
Dope man, dope man
In your face
Yo Dre, kick in the bass!

Ooh, that's funky, that's funky
Like nine cans of shaving powder, that's funky
Come on with it again, fellas

If you smoke 'caine, you a stupid motherfucker
Known around the hood as the schoolyard clucker
Doing that crack with all the money you got
On your hands and knees searching for a piece of rock
Jonesing for a hit and you're looking for more
Done stole the Alpine of out Eazy's '64
You need your ass whooped, 'cause it's out of this Earth
Can't get a ten piece, need a dollar-fifty worth
Knucklehead nigga, yeah, you turned into a crook
But swear up and down, boy, that you ain't hooked
You beat your friend up and you whooped his ass long
'Cause he hit the pipe 'til the rock was all gone
You're robbing and stealing, bugging and illing
While the dope man's dealing, what is killing
Your pain, cocaine, this shit's insane
Yo, E, she's a 'berry, let's run a train
Man, I wouldn't touch that bitch, me neither
Ho, go home and wash out your beaver
And niggas out there messing up people's health
Yo, what the fuck you got to say for yourself?
Well, I'm the dope man, yeah boy, wear corduroy
Money up to here, but unemployed
You keep smoking that rock and my pockets getting bigger
Yo, got that five-oh, double up, nigga
Yeah, high-rolling, big money I'm folding
Bitch on my tip for the dick I'm holding
Sprung strawberry jocking me so early
Ho, you want a hit, you gotta get your knees dirty
Now that's my life, that how it's cut
Hey, dope man, bitch, shut the fuck up
Gotta make a run, it's a big money deal
Gankers got the fake, but you can get the real from the

Dope man, dope man
Yeah, that's me
Dope man, dope man
Yo, can I get a G??
Dope man, dope man
Clock as much as he can
Fuck this shit, who am I?
The dope man

Yo, mister dope man, you think you're slick
You sold crack to my sister and now she's sick
But if she happens to die because of your drug
