Catch those motherfuckers, catch them, catch them
Hey man, keep up keep up, this way, come on man, hurry up
You don't really think you're gonna get away, do you?
We haven't spotted them yet. But they're somewhere in the immediate vicinity

A 100 miles and runnin' -  MC Ren, I hold the gun and
You want me to kill a motherfucker and it's done in
Since I'm stereotyped to kill and destruct -
Is one of the main reasons I don't give a fuck
Chances are usually not good
'Cause I'm frisked with my hands on a hot hood
And getting jacked by the you-know-who
When in a black and white the capacity is two
But not alone, with three more brothers, I mean street-brothers
Not wearing medallions, 'cause we're not stupid motherfuckers
They're out to take our heads for what we said in the past
Point blank, they can kiss my black ass
I didn't stutter when I said "Fuck Tha Police"
'Cause it's hard for a nigga to get peace
Now it's broken and can't be fixed
'Cause police and little black niggas don't mix so
Now I'm creepin' through the fall
Runnin' like a G, we'll see, I might have slayed y'all
So for now pack the gun and
Hold it in the air 'cause MC Ren has 100 miles of runnin'

In today's news. Four fugitives are on the run
FBI sources tell us that the four are headed
100 miles to their home basein Compton

Lend me a motherfucking ear
So I can tell you why
Running with my brothers, headed for the homebase
With a steady pace on the face that just reads race
The road ahead goes on and on
The shit is gettin' longer than the motherfucking marathon
Runnin' on but never runnin' out
Stayin' wired and if I get tired, I can still try out
Hitchhikin' if that's what it gotta do
But nobody's pickin' up a Nigga Witta Attitude
Confused, yo but Dre's a nigga with nothing to lose
One of the few who's been accused and abused
Of the crime of poisonin' young minds
But you don't know shit til you been in my shoes
Now Dre is back from the C-P-T
Dropping some shit that's D-O-P-E
So fuck the P-O-L-I-C-E!
And any motherfucker that disagrees
Stuck and runnin' hard, hauling ass
'Cause I've been a nigga known for havin' a notorious past
My mind was slick - my temper was too quick
Now the FBI's all over my dick
Got the stick and running since they fired the gun that started the clock
That's when the E jumped off the starting block
100 miles from home and, yo, it's a long stretch
A little sprinting motherfucker that they won't catch
Yeah, back to Compton again
Yo, it's either that or the Federal pen
'Cause niggas been running since beginning of time
Taking a minute to tell you what's on my motherfucking mind
Runnin' like I just don't care
Compton's 50 miles but yo, I'mma get there
Arching my back and on a straight route
Just like Carl Lewis I'm balling the fuck out
From city to city I'm a menace as I pass by
Ripping up shit just so you can remember I'm
A straight-up nigga that's done in, gunnin' and comin'
Straight at yo ass, 100 miles and runnin'

This one goes out to the four brothers from Compton
You're almost there, but the FBI has a little message for you:
Nowhere to run to, baby. Nowhere to hide
Good luck brothers

Running like a nigga I hate to lose
Show me on the news but I hate to be abused
I knew it was a set-up, so now I'm gonna get up
Even if the FBI wants me to shut up
But I've got 10,000 niggas strong
They got everybody singing my "Fuck Tha Police" song
And while they treat my group like dirt
Their whole fucking family is wearing our T-shirts
So I'mma run 'til I can't run no more
'Cause it's time for MC Ren to settle the score
I got a urge to kick down doors
At my grave like a slave even if the rain pours
Clouds are dark and brothers are hiding
Dick-trickling at the sunny motherfuckers are riding
Started with five and, yo, one couldn't take it
So now it's four 'cause the fifth couldn't make it
The number's even - now I'm leavin'
We're never getting took by a bitch with a weave in
Her and the troops are right behind me
But they're so fucking stupid, they'll never find me

One more mile to go through the dark streets
Running like a motherfucker on my own two feet
But you know I never stumble or lag last
I'm almost home so I better haul ass
Tearing up everything in sight
It's a little crazy motherfucker dodging the searchlight
Now that chasing shit is done and
Four motherfuckers going crazy with
100 miles of runnin'!
