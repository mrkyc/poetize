I'm not afraid of ghosts
I had to let you go

I sit in my bedroom with nothing but candles on
No TV on, I choose
The pain that now has begun
T-taking over my heart
The only comfort that I had to keep me going
Is leaving, he's out the door
And so I cried for a week or two
To get over you, I want you to know that

I'm not afraid of ghosts
And that's all you want in me
I had to let you go
But you just didn't wanna leave
You can haunt me (On the phone)
Haunt me (And we're done)
Haunt me, whatever you wanna do
Baby, no, I'm not afraid of ghosts
And that's all you want in me

If I could wake up right now
I'm drowning in nightmares
I wanna be able to get up again
So I can open up the blinds
But there is no light that can seep in
So I choose to fight, I'm not giving in
Got my eyes closed so tightly
And I'm not afraid, I want you to know that
You might also like
I'm not afraid of ghosts
And that's all you want in me
I had to let you go
But you just didn't wanna leave
You can haunt me (On the phone)
Haunt me (And we're done)
Haunt me, whatever you wanna do
Baby, no, I'm not afraid of ghosts
And that's all you want in me

I'm not afraid to close my eyes at night
I'm not afraid
And I won't let you beat me down inside
I'm not afraid, no
I'm not afraid to tell you that you won't get my love
I'm not afraid to finally put myself number one
Not afraid
Not afraid, no (Ooh, I'm not afraid)

I'm not afraid of ghosts (Oh, baby)
And that's all you want in me
I had to let you go
But you just didn't wanna leave
You can haunt me (On the phone)
Haunt me (And we're done)
Haunt me, whatever you wanna do
Baby, no, I'm not afraid of ghosts
And that's all you want in me
If I could wake up right now
I'm drowning in nightmares
