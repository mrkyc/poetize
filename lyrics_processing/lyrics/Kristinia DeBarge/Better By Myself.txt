Forty days and nights without you, huh
You're pillow doesn't make a sound, mmm yeah
Was gonna leave, yeah I was about to, huh
Just had to pick my heart up off the ground
And there you were once again

When I needed you
Gone with the wind
I took a deep breath
Let my heart cry for the last time
Now I'm living some kind of lie

I'm so glad I'm that standing tall
And I had no idea at all
But I'm happy that I made it
Yes, I'm brave after all
Didn't think I'd get away from you
All the silly things you put me through
I thought I was good with you
But I'm better by myself
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Thought I was good with you
But I'm better by myself
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Thought I was good with you
But I'm better by myself

I don't fight anymore that's not me, no
Never was, I was just used to it, mmm
So sad, was the wrong kinda love that got me, huh
Can't be mad
Had to put myself through it
And there I was once again

I met the real me
Became my friend
I took a deep breath
Let my heart cry for the last time
Now I'm living some kind of lie

I'm so glad I'm that standing tall
And I had no idea at all
But I'm happy that I made it
Yes, I'm brave after all
Didn't think I'd get away from you
All the silly things you put me through
I thought I was good with you
But I'm better by myself

Now that I'm not with you
I feel good in my own shoes
Didn't leave a mark, not at all
Now I got no fear at all
This is some kind of lie, hey
I'm so glad I'm that standing tall
And I had no idea at all
But I'm happy that I made it
Yes, I'm brave after all
Didn't think I'd get away from you
All the silly things you put me through
I thought I was good with you
But I'm better by myself
I'm so glad I'm that standing tall
And I had no idea at all
But I'm happy that I made it
Yes, I'm brave after all
Didn't think I'd get away from you
All the silly things you put me through
I thought I was good with you
But I'm better by myself
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Thought I was good with you
But I'm better by myself
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Thought I was good with you
But I'm better by myself
Ohhh
