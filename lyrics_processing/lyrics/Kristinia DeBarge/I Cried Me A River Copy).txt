I hung onto every word you said
Asked me to surrender and that's what I did
And you broke my heart again and again
So now you are sorry like you are in love
But where was your sorry when you broke it all up?
I told myself never again, there ain't no way I'm lettin' you in
Because I keep rememberin' when you played me
I cried me a river, I cried me a sea
I cried me an ocean, I cried me a stream
I'm fresh out of teardrops, you got me on E
I'm out of emotion, got nothin' in me
And I would have done anythin' in the world for you
I would have done anythin' that you told me to
I cried me a river, I cried me a sea
And I ain't got nothin' left in me
You can't have my number, don't wanna be friends
I don't care to see you now and then
It's not that I'm bitter, it's just that I'm done
My heart finally said enough's enough
So now you are sorry like you are in love
Well, you wasn't sorry when you messed it all up
I told myself never again, there ain't no way I'm lettin' you in
Because I keep rememberin' when you played me
You might also likeI cried me a river, I cried me a sea
I cried me an ocean, I cried me a stream
I'm fresh out of teardrops, you got me on E
I'm out of emotion, got nothin' in me
And I would have done anythin' in the world for you
I would have done anythin' that you told me to
I cried me a river, I cried me a sea
And I ain't got nothin' left in me
Just in case you're not clear and you think there's a chance
There's no way you'll get near this or have me again
Until hell is frozen over, you need to understand
You'll never get with me again
I cried me a river, I cried me a sea
I cried me an ocean, I cried me a stream
I'm fresh out of teardrops, you got me on E
I'm out of emotion, got nothin' in me
And I would have done anythin' in the world for you
I would have done anythin' that you told me to
I cried me a river, I cried me a sea
And I ain't got nothin' left in me
I cried me a river, I cried me a sea
I cried me an ocean, I cried me a stream
I'm fresh out of teardrops, you got me on E
I'm out of emotion, got nothin' in me
And I would have done anythin' in the world for you
I would have done anythin' that you told me to
I cried me a river, I cried me a sea
And I ain't got nothin' left in me
I cried me a river, I cried me a sea
I cried me an ocean, I cried me a stream
I'm fresh out of teardrops, you got me on E
