Tell me it's not too late to call you my own
Do you have the time to talk?
There's something I gotta say
It's been weighing on my heart
And it won't go away, oh no
Don't know if I can keep it inside for long
Oh, I'm giving myself away
Why should I live another day without you?
Can't deny the way you give me butterflies
Remember that day you passed right by me
Cracked a smile, then you called me 'cutie'
Oh, oh and now I can't forget you
What is it gonna take to get you next to me?
Tell me it's not too late to call you my own
Could you be into me, like I am into you?
Tell me it's not too late to call you my own
Got excited when you called
You said you'd be here at eight
So I put my red dress on
Oh, I can hardly wait for you
To show up at my doorstep
So out of the blue
Man, you turn me on
You might also likeWhy should I live another day without you?
Can't deny the way you give me butterflies
Remember that day you passed right by me
Cracked a smile, then you called me 'cutie'
Oh, oh and now I can't forget you
What is it gonna take to get you next to me?
Tell me it's not too late to call you my own
Could you be into me, like I am into you?
Tell me it's not too late to call you my own
This could be so perfect
This could be so real
But all the while, I wait for you
I'll wait for you until
You tell me that you need me
You want me by your side
'Cause you're the kind of guy I dreamed of for my whole life
Oh oh oh oh yeah oh woah
What is it gonna take to call you my own?
What is it gonna take to get you next to me?
Tell me it's not too late to call you my own
Could you be into me, like I am into you?
