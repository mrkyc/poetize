I wish my heart was bulletproof
I could withstand these shots from you
But somehow I'm pulling through
In spite of all the pain I held on to
You tried to shoot me down
The shells fall on the ground
I'm sending them back to you
I wish my heart was bulletproof
I could withstand these shots from you
If I was bulletproof

You were once the world to me
I was living with no doubt in my mind
Taking my time
I was blind, I couldn't see
Small fish in a big pond
Somehow you made me fall and
No matter who was calling to try and get me off your hands
But a young girl was just try'na follw her heart
And now it's just too hard

I wish my heart was bulletproof
I could withstand these shots from you
But somehow I'm pulling through
In spite of all the pain I held on to
You tried to shoot me down
The shells fall on the ground
I'm sending them back to you
I wish my heart was bulletproof
I could withstand these shots from you
If I was bulletproof
I could withstand these shots from you
If I was bulletproof
I could withstand these shots from you
If I was bulletproof
You might also like
You start to lie to numb the pain
Kinda hoping that tonight it would rain
I'm going insane
Everybody laughs at me
They don't know what I've been through
I remember your name popping in my head
How you always left me bruised
But I guess it was my fault anyway
'Cause I continue to let you too
And now I wish that

I wish my heart was bulletproof
I could withstand these shots from you
But somehow I'm pulling through
In spite of all the pain I held on to
You tried to shoot me down
The shells fall on the ground
I'm sending them back to you
I wish my heart was bulletproof
I could withstand these shots from you
If I was bulletproof

And all the times I held on to
I could of sworn that we'd be fine
But you had to go and mess it up
You really blew my mind
It didn't have to be so hard
But it seems you made it clear
So go ahead and take your shots
I'm bulletproof, I'm standing right here, oh
If my heart was bulletproof
I could withstand these shots from you
But somehow I'm pulling through
In spite of all the pain I held on to
You tried to shoot me down
The shells fall on the ground
I'm sending them back to you
I wish my heart was bulletproof
I could withstand these shots from you
If I was bulletproof
I could withstand these shots from you
If I was bulletproof
I could withstand these shots from you
