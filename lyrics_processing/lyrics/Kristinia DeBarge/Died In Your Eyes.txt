I, I, just died in your eyes, eyes
Just died in your eyes, eyes
Just died in your eyes

There's a silence in the air tonight
There's a secret we can't hide behind, no more
There's a distance we don't dare to go
And a million things that I don't wanna know

Your hands are undressing me
Your lips won't stop kissing me
I hear you say you love me

But baby, you're lying, lying
I see the truth your hiding, hiding
I look at you and I, I, just died in your eyes, eyes
Before I start crying, crying
Give a reason for trying, trying
The one thing that keeps me alive, I
Just died in your eyes, eyes
Just died in your eyes, eyes
You might also like
From the window I've been looking through
I have seen the end of me and you, oh, oh
And it's not about what's right or wrong
When you wake up in the morning, I'll be gone

Your hands start undressing me
Your lips won't stop kissing me
I hear you say you love me (Yeah, yeah)

But baby, you're lying, lying
I see the truth your hiding, hiding
I look at you and I, I, just died in your eyes, eyes
Before I start crying, crying
Give me a reason for trying, trying
The one thing that keeps me alive, I (Alive)
Just died in your eyes, eyes
Just died in your eyes

My hopes, my dreams, all I believe
Just died, died, just died in your eyes, eyes
Baby, now I know is what matters most
Just died, died, died in your eyes, eyes
Just died in your eyes, eyes
Died in your eyes
There's a silence in the air tonight
There's a secret we can't hide behind
No more

Baby, you're lying, lying
I see the truth your hiding, hiding
I look at you and I, I, just died in your eyes, eyes
(I just died in your eyes)
Before I start crying, crying
Give a reason for trying, trying
The one thing that keeps me alive, I
Just died in your eyes, eyes (Just died in your eyes)
Just died in your eyes, eyes
Just died in your eyes

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I died in your eyes
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I, I, just died in your eyes
Just died in your eyes
