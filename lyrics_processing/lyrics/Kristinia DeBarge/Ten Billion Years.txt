Ten billion years
Ten billion years (Ten billion years)
Ten billion years
Ten billion years (Ten billion years)

Your hands awesomely designed
With my skin in mind
This must explain why you send me-
Your lips, candy coated wine
So tasteful each time
You place them inside of mine

So I say, "Heaven, heaven, heaven"
Can a girl get like?
Can a girl get like?
Can a girl get like?
Ten billion years (Ten billion years)
Like ten billion years (Ten billion years)
So I say, "Heaven, heaven, heaven"
Can a girl get like?
Can a girl get like? (Oh)
Can a girl get like?
Ten billion years (Ten billion years)
Like ten billion years
To love him
To love him
Like ten billion years
You might also like
The thought of your touch being here on a limit-supply
Makes a girl go numb inside
This must explain why you thrill me
'Cause I can't imagine (No)
You not being near me (No)
Your beautiful love (Oh) not traveling with me (Oh-oh)
I would go out of my mind
I would go out of my mind

So I say, "Heaven, heaven, heaven"
Can a girl get like?
Can a girl get like?
Can a girl get like?
Ten billion years (Ten billion years)
Like ten billion years (Ten billion years)
So I say, "Heaven, heaven, heaven"
Can a girl get like?
Can a girl get like? (Oh)
Can a girl get like?
Ten billion years (Ten billion years)
Like ten billion years
To love him (To love him)
To love him
Like ten billion years
I could have 100 years with you
But that would go way too soon
That just wouldn't do
Like ten billion years
Or I could have one million days with you
But that would go way too soon
That just wouldn't do, no
Like ten billion years

So I say "Heaven, heaven, heaven"
Can a girl get like?
Can a girl get like?
Can a girl get like?
Ten billion years (Ten billion years)
Like ten billion years (Ten billion years)

Like ten billion years (Ten billion years)
Like ten billion years (Ten billion years)
Like ten billion years (Ten billion years)
