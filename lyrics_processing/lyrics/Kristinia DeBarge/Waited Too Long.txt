I heard you got a new friend, is she cool?
Does she love you like me?
I know that it will take time
But I'm not over you
I can't believe it's been three months
And I'm still dying to see you
Sometimes I try, but it's too much
The pain, I can't let it go

I know sometimes you get confused
I wanna be the one you choose
But if it's not our time right now
Well then I gotta let you go

I'm not the one who's running 'round in circles
You've gotta get things straight (Because I've waited too long)
Baby I'm not the one that's tryna hurt you
But I just can't wait
I've waited too long, waited too long, waited too long
Can you give me an answer?
I've waited too long, waited too long, waited too long
Can you tell me right now? Because I've waited too long
You might also like
I'm tired of you texting me
Telling me that you miss what we had
Baby, if that was the case
Then why are you with her?
I keep on getting my hopes up high
And I think I'm goin' insane
I'm here, I keep on trying
Those things never change

I know sometimes you get confused
I wanna be the one you choose
But if it's not our time right now
Well then I gotta let you go, I'm not the one

I'm not the one who's running 'round in circles
You've gotta get things straight (Because I've waited too long)
Baby I'm not the one that's tryna hurt you
But I just can't wait
I've waited too long, waited too long, waited too long
Can you give me an answer?
I've waited too long, waited too long, waited too long
Can you tell me right now? Because I've waited too long
Oh, I'm not the one

I'm not the one who's running 'round in circles
You've gotta get things straight (Because I've waited too long)
Baby I'm not the one that's tryna hurt you
But I just can't wait
I've waited too long (Too long), waited too long (Too long), waited too long
Can you give me an answer?
I've waited too long, waited too long, waited too long
Can you tell me right now? Because I've waited too long

I've waited too long, waited too long, waited too long
Can you give me an answer?
I've waited too long, waited too long, waited too long
Can you tell me right now? Because I've waited too long
I've waited too long, waited too long, waited too long
Can you give me an answer?
I've waited too long, waited too long, waited too long
