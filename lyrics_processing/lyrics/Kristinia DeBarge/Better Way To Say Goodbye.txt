Ooh, yeah
Oh-oh, mmh

Another sleepless night
Pretending everything's alright
But we know the truth can't hide, yeah
I wonder, could we ever be happy
If we just let it ride? No-oh-whoa
'Cause there's something missing
There's too much distance now
It's so confusing but there's no use in
Beating 'round the bush
You should know I never will forget you
But now I think it's time I gotta let you go, oh-whoa-oh

I can feel your heart breaking
Every word that I'm sayin'
Like a knife just waiting
To stop the beating, oh-whoa-oh
And I hate the fact I'm making you cry
But it's better than living a lie
And I'm trying but I know that I
Can't find a better way to say goodbye
(Say goodbye, say goodbye)
Is there a better way to say goodbye?
(Say goodbye, say goodbye) Mmh, no

There's so much world out there
And I don't wanna be unfair
'Cause there's someone for you somewhere, yeah
And I only want you to be happy
Because I really care, woo-oh
It's not the way we planned it
So let's not drag this out
The clock is ticking, you gotta listen
Listen to your heart
Baby, don't you know you can't control this?
I don't wanna hurt you, but you know it's time, woo-oh-oh

I can feel your heart breaking
Every word that I'm sayin'
Like a knife just waiting
To stop the beating, oh-woah-oh
And I hate the fact I'm making you cry
But it's better than living a lie
And I'm trying but I know that I
Can't find a better way to say goodbye

Maybe in another place
Maybe in another time
When the stars are all aligned
If we're gonna make things right
Then we gotta walk away
I can feel your heart breaking
Every word that I'm sayin'
Like a knife just waiting
To stop the beating, oh-whoa-oh
And I hate the fact I'm making you cry
But it's better than living a lie
And I'm trying but I know that I
Can't find a better way to say goodbye
(Say goodbye, say goodbye)
Is there a better way to say goodbye?
(Say goodbye, say goodbye)

Can't find a better way to say goodbye
(Say goodbye, say goodbye)
Is there a better way to say goodbye?
