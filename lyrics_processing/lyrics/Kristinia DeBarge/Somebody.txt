So young and vulnerable, told myself
In order to feel the joy, I had to go through the pain
I lost track of tears, I cried through the years
Even convinced myself that I was the one to blame

All the searching
Left me broken
Had to pick up the pieces
Be sad for no reason
Now I'm so glad
To be with you
Had a breakthrough
Finally know how it feels

To be loved by somebody
Be loved by somebody
To be loved by somebody, body
Be loved by somebody, body
To be loved by somebody
Be loved by somebody
To be loved by somebody, body
Be loved by

I just gotta release myself from the negative
Learning from my mistake
So I never hurt again
I, I had to tear down the wall around my heart
Left myself open for love
And I'm so happy that I did it, 'cause...

All the searching (Yeah)
Left me broken (Oh)
Had to pick up the pieces
Be sad for no reason
Now I'm so glad (I'm so glad)
To be with you (Mhm)
Had a breakthrough (Through)
Finally know how it feels
To be loved by somebody
Be loved by somebody
To be loved by somebody, body
Be loved by somebody, body
To be loved by somebody
Be loved by somebody
To be loved by somebody, body
Be loved by

Now that I found you baby, I
Ain't ever gonna let you go
I wanna tell the world how good it feels
