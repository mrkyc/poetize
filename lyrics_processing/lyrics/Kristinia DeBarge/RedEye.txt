Can't control my body
Every time I see you
We're a faraway love
I close my eyes and breathe you

Too soon never seems like soon enough, no
Your heartbeat is my getaway
It could be a million miles between us
Still can feel you next to me

That's why I'm taking the
Red Eye to you, tonight yeah
I'm on the next flight, yeah
Taking the Red Eye to you, tonight yeah
I'm on the next flight, yeah

I wanna be wrapped in your love
Wanna drown in your love
Oh I'm, taking the Red Eye to you
I wanna be wrapped in your love
Wanna drown in your love
Oh I'm, taking the Red Eye to you
You might also like
Made a thousand wrong turns to get to
To you
Got caught it burned like a pencil
I never knew that someone could
Make me feel the way you do
I need you to shine the light forever
Forever, and always
We're better, together
No, never, break away
Like a paintin' on the wall
A wave on the waterfall
Current beneath it all
That's why I'm dying to get to the

Red Eye to you, tonight yeah
I'm on the next flight, yeah
Taking the Red Eye to you, tonight yeah
I'm on the next flight, yeah

I wanna be wrapped in your love
Wanna drown in your love
Oh I'm, taking the Red Eye to you
I wanna be wrapped in your love
Wanna drown in your love
Oh I'm, taking the Red Eye to you
Can't control my body
Every time I see you
We're a faraway love
I close my eyes and breathe you

That's why I'm taking the
Red Eye to you, tonight yeah
I'm on the next flight, yeah
Taking the Red Eye to you, tonight yeah
I'm on the next flight, yeah

I wanna be wrapped in your love
Wanna drown in your love
Oh I'm, taking the Red Eye to you
I wanna be wrapped in your love
Wanna drown in your love
