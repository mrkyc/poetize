I woke up the third time tonight
You asked if I was alright
I told you that I needed water
And when you looked in my eyes
You knew that it was a lie
The emptiness is taking over

Wish that I
Could rewind and start over
After all this time it's not the same
Will we ever get it back again?

How can I find it in my heart?
All the words I wanna say
Can this pain just go away?
How can I find it in my heart?
That you were a part of me
Instead you break me 'til I bleed
I always came to you looking for shelter
You left me here alone without an answer
If it was easier, then everyone would be doing it
I gotta find a way
You might also like
You always pull me back in
You tell me, "No, not again"
You always have the right things to say
Right up your sleeve like a trick
Where is your hat and your stick?
This seems to be your favorite part, babe

Wish that I
Could rewind and start over
After all this time it's not the same
Will we ever get it back again?

How can I find it in my heart?
All the words I wanna say
Can this pain just go away?
How can I find it in my heart?
That you were a part of me
Instead you break me 'til I bleed
I always came to you looking for shelter
You left me here alone without an answer
If it was easier, then everyone would be doing it
I gotta find a way
Remembering the times
When you had your own life
I'm so sick and tired
Of everything revolve around me
I can't spread your mind
But man I wish I could
'Cause I've run out of time
To give myself away to you

How can I find it in my heart?
All the words I wanna say
Can this pain just go away?
How can I find it in my heart?
That you were a part of me
Instead you break me 'til I bleed
I always came to you looking for shelter
You left me here alone without an answer
If it was easier, then everyone would be doing it
