Baby, I know
Every time I see you
Oh-oh, baby, I'm so
Intoxicated over you (Intoxicated over you)

Yeah, you've got some kind of control over me
Without even knowing
On the rocks is how I prefer my drink
Sipping slow till the morning
Like I'm drinking Hennessy
I guess that's how it feels when you're in love
Four glasses of Sex on the Beach
I guess that's how it feels when you're in love, love, love, love

Got my excited, go in and pour me one more cup
Yes, you're invited, empty my bottle, toss it up
I can't deny it, the room is spinning
What the fuck, did you pour in my cup?

Feels like I'm drinking Hennessy
I guess that's how it feels when you're in love
Four glasses of Sex on the Beach
I guess that's how it feels when you're in love, love, love, love
Walking so slow
I'm tipsy when I'm round you (I'm tipsy when I'm round you)
I shoulda had a chaser, I know
Hangover's gonna be a fool, oh-oh
Yeah, you've got some kind of control over me
Without even knowing
On the rocks is how I prefer my drink
Sipping slow till the morning

Four glasses of Sex on the Beach
I guess that's how it feels when you're in love, love, love, love

All I need is just you and me
I ain't thinking about getting no sleep
I ain't never gonna tell you no
Hold me tight and don't let go
