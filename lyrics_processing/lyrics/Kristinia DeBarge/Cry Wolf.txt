Your rose painted black
When I need the best of you, yeah
Give me the rest of you
I keep coming back
'Cause you tell me that you've changed
But it always ends the same

I tell you it's over, time after time
You say whatever just to make it right
You send me flowers and promise the sky
But it turns out your word is no good

You always cry wolf
You always cry wolf
I'm leaving so you can howl at the moon
Ah ooh, wooh
You always cry wolf
Na na na na na na na na na
You always cry
Na na na na na na na na na
You always cry wolf

Smoke, with no flame
Should've known from the start
You were just a false alarm
Save your tears for fool love
'Cause I know it's just a game
That you always make me play
You might also like
Baby it's over, I mean it this time
You'll say whatever just to make it right
You send me flowers and promise the sky
But it turns out your word is no good

You always cry wolf
You always cry wolf
I'm leaving so you can howl at the moon
Ah ooh, wooh
You always cry wolf
Na na na na na na na na na
You always cry
Na na na na na na na na na
You always cry wolf

Can't believe I fell for your lies
Every time you cried
You really had me going
You say you're a man, but you're a little boy
Too scared to tell the truth

You always cry wolf (you always cry, you always cry)
You always cry wolf (you always cry, you always cry)
I'm leaving so you can howl at the moon
Ah ooh, wooh
You always cry wolf
Na na na na na na na na na
You always cry
Na na na na na na na na na
