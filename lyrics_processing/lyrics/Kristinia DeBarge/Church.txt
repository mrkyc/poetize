Feels like the first day at school
And I'm just a freshman, church
I see the earth behind me, church
I'm nearly there, although I'm scared
No one said it would be easy
Don't want it if its easy
Look how you're eyeing me
Look how you tryna get by on me
You should be tryna get high off me
Lie on me, nigga please, sway it like you're just a fly on me
Boy I'm a business like INC
What's up with you and my privacy?!
I don't understand it!
I did no wrong to you
Can't make a lie the truth
Gave up on me too soon, 'cause
We all need something to believe in
Something to believe in
Something to believe
We all need something to believe
Is that loyalty? What you mean? You didn't know?
The world was crashing on me
When it was you I didn't retreat (hol' up)
I'm really mad at me
Should've saw through your dishonesty
Niggas is niggas, one hunned Gs
Trusted bitch niggas, that's all on me, damn!
You might also likeI did no wrong to you
Can't make a lie the truth
Gave up on me too soon, 'cause
We all need something to believe in
Something to believe in
Something to believe
We all need something to believe
Praying to God that devil don't find me
Angels above and the demons behind me
I took the bullet when you deserved it
Life was on fire, wish I knew that you burned it
Throw it out my window, let it go, Keyshia Cole
I ain't started yet
If you tired, catch your breath
You're too sentimental
Fucking up my high though
Tryna damage me?
But you can't hurt me
I did no wrong to you
Can't make a lie the truth
Gave up on me, it's cruel, 'cause
We all need something to believe in
Something to believe in
Something to believe
