Speak up
Your silence is killin' me
I've had enough
Baby, speak up
Are you lovin' or hatin' me?
'Cause I can never tell

I'll be the first to admit it, been silent for a minute
Thinkin' like, "Damn, is he feelin' me?"
We fell in love, took a second, but now I'm always checkin'
'Cause I never hear you say what you really think

Some days I feel it then I feel it's over
Some days were harder then some days were colder
When you open up, our love is alive
But now you're quiet and I'm dying inside

So baby, speak up (Speak up)
'Cause your silence is killing me
I've had enough, baby, speak up (Speak up)
Are you lovin' or hatin' me?
'Cause I can never tell, I can never tell
Just let your heart say what you can't say (Speak up)
Let your heart say what you won't say (Speak up)
Don't let the silence tear us away
'Cause I can never tell, I can never tell
If you don't speak up (Speak, speak, speak, speak, speak)
Oh, oh (Speak, speak, speak, speak, speak, oh)
You might also like
I don't know where you've been
But nothing's making sense
I'm standing on this fence for you (You)
And even when you're here, somehow you disappear
If I could read your mind, I'd know just what to do

Some days I feel it then I feel it's over
Some days were harder then some days were colder
When you open up, our love is alive
And now you're quiet and I'm dying inside

So baby, speak up (Speak up)
'Cause your silence is killing me
I've had enough, baby, speak up (Speak up)
Are you lovin' or hatin' me?
'Cause I can never tell, I can never tell
Just let your heart say what you can't say (Speak up)
Let your heart say what you won't say (Speak up)
Don't let the silence tear us away
'Cause I can never tell, I can never tell

Speak up
I'll be out the door before the sun comes up
Boy, catch me if you can while I'm pumping that clutch (Try)
Try to be the one (I), gave it all I got (I)
Giving you your last chance (If you don't speak up)
Say all the words that you never said (Said), oh
Write all the letters that I never read, oh
Show me your words or the love is dead
Just wanna hear it from you
First to admit it, been silent for a minute
Thinkin' like, "Damn, is he feelin' me?"
We fell in love, took a second
But you about to wreck it
'Cause I never hear you say what you really mean

Baby, speak up (Speak up)
'Cause your silence is killing me (Your silence is killin' me)
I've had enough, baby, speak up (Whoa, oh, speak up)
Are you lovin' or hatin' me?
'Cause I can never tell, I can never tell
Just let your heart say what you can't say (Speak up)
Let your heart say what you won't say (Speak up, oh)
Don't let the silence tear us away
'Cause I can never tell, I can never tell

(If you never) Speak up (Speak, speak, speak, speak, speak, oh)
(Speak, speak, speak, speak, speak, oh)
If you don't speak up (Speak, speak, speak, speak, speak, oh)
(Speak, speak, speak, speak, speak, oh)
