I am alone on this dark and empty road
My heart beating slow, is anyone out there?
I look to the sky, I am waiting for a sign
So throw up a flare, let me know that you're out there

I'm on a mission and I won't look back
You're in the distance and I need you bad
Too many times I've said "Goodbye"
But now I'm saying "Hello"

I want you to find me, want you to find me
Want you to find my restless heart
Want you to find me, want you to find me
Want you to find what I have lost
Tears I'm crying, can't you see I'm dying for you? Ooh
Want you to find me
Want you to find what I have lost
Find my precious heart

The closer we get
All the sadness starts to fade
And I don't have to pretend
Pretend anymore
You might also like
I'm on a mission and I won't look back
You're in the distance and I need you bad
Too many times I've said "Goodbye"
But now I'm saying "Hello"

I want you to find me, want you to find me
Want you to find my restless heart
Want you to find me, want you to find me
Want you to find what I have lost
Tears I'm crying, can't you see I'm dying for you? Ooh
Want you to find me
Want you to find what I have lost
Find my precious heart

Way back then, when we were torn apart
Oh, it felt like I was in the dark
And you returned, you heard my call
And you came to find me
In my, oh yeah, yeah
Oh-oh, yeah-yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I want you to find me, want you to find me
Want you to find my restless heart
Want you to find me, want you to find me
Want you to find what I have lost
Tears I'm crying, can't you see I'm dying for you? Ooh
Want you to find me
Want you to find what I have lost
