We're moving side to side
Music makes me feel alive
Tonight, tonight
Grab a drink, enjoy the ride
We can take our time
And just let it go
Let it go
In the sky I see a bright light
Dance all night, we're gonna get right
Ain't nobody gonna leave the floor
'Til the morning, morning
Let's get higher
Gonna make you feel alright
Lift the sky up
Gonna make your body fly
Let's get higher!
Higher tonight!
Let's get lost
Can you feel the rhythm going on tonight?
Let's get lost
Don't you feel tonight? We're gonna get real high
Let's get higher!
Higher tonight!
Higher tonight, higher tonight

And we're dancing face to face
Wanna take you far away
Tonight, tonight
Touching you, you're touching me
Feel the energy
And just let it flow
Let it go
It's my party and I love it
Shots of Bacardi, having fun yeah
Turn it up, just make it louder
Raise your glass up way up high
Let's get higher
Gonna make you feel alright
Lift the sky up
Gonna make your body fly
Let's get higher!
Higher tonight!

Lift the sky up
Gonna make your body fly
