It's just the way you touch me
I just can't get enough of you
Oh

You see through me
Like a new moon
Mirrors can't see right (right right right)
Lipstick on your neck like cologne
Wear me out all night

I'm bout that action like on a big screen (t-v)
We ain't gon' keep it PG
You make me, lose self-control
I don't know if I'm high or low
You make me lose self-control
I don't know if I'm high or low
You make me lose self-control, trol(10x)
Sometimes I just want you to...

Know what I'm talking about
Know what I'm talking about
Know what I'm talking about
(Make me,make me yours)
Know what I'm talking about (drop drop)
Know what I'm talking about (self-control)
Know what I'm talking about
(You make me lose self-control)
Know what I'm talking about
Know what I'm talking about
Know what I'm talking about
(You make me, you m-make me)
Know what I'm talking about
Make me yours
Like you hate me
Cause you love me, aha
You might also like
You can have me
Go 'head use me
Feels so wrong but right (right right right)
Touch me tease me how you please me
Boy you blow my mind

I'm bout that action like on a big screen (t-v)
