It's sabotage now

I keep praying she'd leave me alone (Leave me alone)
But she keeps waiting outside of my home
I got an angel on the left, saying, "Don't give in"
But the devil on the right, saying, "Let her in"
She won't stop kicking down my door
Oh, whoa-oh, whoa

Each time I try to play the good girl
I let myself get in the way
I try so hard to fight the bad girl
She's here to stay
And sabotage all over and over again
Sabotage all over and over again
Sabotage all over and over again
Now my heart is broken all over again
It's sabotage now

I can't hold on to guys I don't like (No, no no)
But she keeps looking with wandering eyes, oh
I got an angel on the left, screaming, "Get away"
But the devil on the right saying, "Time to play" (Ooh)
And I can't take it anymore
It's sabotage now

Each time I try to play the good girl
I let myself get in the way
I try so hard to fight the bad girl
She's here to stay
And sabotage all over and over again
Sabotage all over and over again
Sabotage all over and over again
Now my heart is broken all over again
It's sabotage now (Hmm, whoa, oh-oh)

Where to fall in love?
I, cause myself so much pain
I sabotage my heart
And, and I don't know how to change
It doesn't matter what I say or what I do
'Cause in the end, she always wins, I always lose
I need to get her out of my life, oh, oh

Each time I try to play the good girl
I let myself get in the way
I try so hard to fight the bad girl (Bad girl)
She's here to stay
And sabotage all over and over again
Sabotage all over and over again (Oh)
Sabotage all over and over again (Over again, yeah)
Now my heart is broken all over again (Oh)
Sabotage now
And sabotage all over and over again (Oh, oh)
Sabotage all over and over again
Sabotage all over and over again (Oh, oh)
Now my heart is broken all over again
