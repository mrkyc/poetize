Couple of years, and I'm gonna know your name
It's like I waited for you forever
And I know this might sound insane
But it won't be long
'Till we're gonna take this up
What I'm talking about, our future love

You're so far away
Maybe you're right next door
Got me picturing your face again
Something worth waiting for
Put all lovers behind me, they don't live up
I know what I want, what I need to the tee

Baby, if they ask me, I would say, "I don't even know your name"
And when they ask me, "Does it change?"
No, it don't change a thing
'Cause there's something 'bout the way you love me
There's just something 'bout the way you know me
And I can't explain enough
There's just something 'bout our future love
Future love, future love
Something 'bout our future love
Future love, future love

Walking hand in hand
Goin' on our second date
I can picture how we touchin' and
The kiss I can almost taste
I've imagined all the ways we'll meet for the very first time
I can see the place, feel the love at first sight

Baby, if they ask me, I would say, "I don't even know your name"
And when they ask me, "Does it change?"
No, it don't change a thing
'Cause there's something 'bout the way you love me
There's just something 'bout the way you know me
And I can't explain enough
There's just something 'bout our future love
Future love (Future love), future love
Something 'bout our future love
Future love, future love

I'll know, the minute you pull up next to me
We're standing there like destiny
When it feels like you're fighting just to breathe (Breathe)
That's when you know (You know)
The minute I pull up next to you
Suddenly you don't know what to do
Everything inside you says that I'm the one
Baby, if they ask me, "I would say I don't even know your name" (Oh)
And when they ask me, "Does it change?"
No, it don't change a thing
'Cause there's something 'bout the way you love me
There's just something 'bout the way you know me
And I can't explain enough
Baby, if they ask me, I would say, "I don't even know your name"(Don't even know)
And when they ask me, "Does it change?"
No, it don't change a thing
'Cause there's something 'bout the way you love me
There's just something 'bout the way you know me
And I can't explain enough
There's just something 'bout our future love (Our future love)
Future love, future love
Something 'bout our future love (Our future love)
Future love, future love

Oh-oh-oh
Future love, future love, oh
Future love, future love, oh
