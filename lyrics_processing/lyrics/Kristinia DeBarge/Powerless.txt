Baby, powerless
I'm about, I'm about to leave you
I'm about to leave you powerless

You held me down for too long
Battery charged up now, I'm on
I'll flip your breaker now and take your recharging off of me (Oh)
Drain me emotionally (Oh)
Thought I could ride on empty (Oh)
So I brought a back up knowing you'd be back up in the outlet
I feel

(Pull the) Electricity (Power)
This is it for me
It's about to be, it's about to be lights out (Pull the)
This is history (Siren)
Solve the mystery (Oh)
It's about to be, it's about to be lights out

What you think this is?
I'm 'bout to flip off the switch and shut it down, baby (Baby)
I'm 'bout to leave you powerless-less
Leave you powerless-less
Is it a false alarm?
Is it a false alarm? (I'm about to leave you powerless)
What you think this is?
I'm 'bout to flip off the switch and shut it down, baby (Baby)
I'm 'bout to leave you powerless-less
Leave you powerless-less
Is it a false alarm? (I'm about, I'm about to leave you)
Is it a false alarm? (I'm about to leave you powerless, oh-oh)

Now that your circuit is blown
In the dark and you all alone
Taking out your fuses, now you're just useless
No more doing me wrong (Oh)
Stole all of my energy (Oh)
Couldn't just, just let me be (Oh)
Thought you was golden
Now I'm withholding everything that you need

(Pull the) Electricity (Power)
This is it for me
It's about to be, it's about to be lights out (Pull the)
This is history (Siren)
Solve the mystery
It's about to be, it's about to be lights out

What you think this is?
I'm 'bout to flip off the switch and shut it down, baby (Baby)
I'm 'bout to leave you powerless-less
Leave you powerless-less
Is it a false alarm?
Is it a false alarm? (I'm about to leave you powerless)
What you think this is?
I'm 'bout to flip off the switch and shut it down, baby (Baby)
I'm 'bout to leave you powerless-less
Leave you powerless-less
Is it a false alarm? (I'm about, I'm about to leave you)
Is it a false alarm? (I'm about to leave you powerless)
Your body's having a blackout
Before you ask, what's that about?
Let's recall how you tapped right into me
Used up all of my life line
Took too much of my life
I'm putting all of the power back into me

What you think this is?
I'm 'bout to flip off the switch and shut it down, baby (Baby)
I'm 'bout to leave you powerless-less
Leave you powerless-less
Is it a false alarm?
Is it a false alarm? (I'm about to leave you powerless)
What you think this is?
I'm 'bout to flip off the switch and shut it down, baby (I'm about yo leave you, baby)
I'm 'bout to leave you powerless-less
Leave you powerless-less
Is it a false alarm? (I'm about, I'm about to leave you)
Is it a false alarm? (I'm about to leave you powerless)

(Oh-oh, flip off the switch and shut it down, baby, yeah, yeah)
(Oh, oh, oh) I'm about, I'm about to leave you
I'm about to leave you powerless
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
