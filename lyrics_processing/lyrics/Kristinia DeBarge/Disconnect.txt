Another day of no more you
I'm givin' everyone attitude
I'm losin' there and slowly dyin'
Kill me if I can't be around you

I don't wanna be too dramatic
Breakin' up is problematic
I don't even know what to do

But all I know is that I'm missing you
And I don't care for nothing else but you
I'm like (Two steps)
Two steps from losing it
One more step, I disconnect
Feels like I might as well be dead
No, I really don't think I'll make it without you
Not about to, baby

I try to deal but it don't make sense
I can't believe this is happenin'
I'm losing tears with all this crying
If you were here, I know it would drown you (Would drown you)
You might also like
(No) I don't wanna make it sound so tragic
(No) I believe we still got magic
(Ooh) I just need to know you do too (Ooh)

But all I know is that I'm missing you
And I don't care for nothing else but you
I'm like (Two steps)
Two steps from losing it
One more step I disconnect
Feels like I might as well be dead
No, really don't think I'll make it without you
Not about to, baby
I'm like (Two steps)
Two steps from losing it
No, I really don't think I'll make it without you
Not about to, baby

You better not give up
You know that you can't
I love you too much for this to end
(Boy) You gotta come through, boy (Boy)
I'm counting on you, boy (Boy)
You know what to do, boy (Boy)
(You should) Call a girl up and save her life
Tell her you're not gonna let her die
No way that's gonna happen tonight
(Oh no) But all I know is that I'm missing you (Oh)
And I don't care for nothing else but you (Oh, you, baby)
I'm like (Two steps)
Two steps from losing it
One more step, I disconnect
Feels like I might as well be dead
(And all I know is) And all I know is that I'm missing you
And I don't care for nothing else but you
I'm like (Two steps)
Two steps from losing it
And one more step, I disconnect
Feels like I might as well be dead
No, I really don't think I'll make it without you
Not about to (Oh no)
(And all I) Two steps from losing it
No really don't think I'll make it without you
Not about to (Oh no)
All I know is that I'm missin' you (Missin' you)
I don't care for nothing else but you (Else but you)
I'm like (Two steps)
Two steps from losing it
One more step, I disconnect
Feels like I might as well be dead (Oh-oh, no)
And all I know is that I'm missing you
And I don't care for nothing else but you
I'm like (Two steps)
Two steps from losing it
One more step, I disconnect
Feels like I might as well be dead
No, I really don't think I'll make it without you
