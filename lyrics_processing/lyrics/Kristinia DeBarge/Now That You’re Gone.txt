Still broken in two, oh yeah
And it's not the way I planned
Standing here without you
So understand boy, you killed a part of me
The heart of me, the best of me
So, I'm not your girl, boy, it's hard to breathe
The stars fall out of the galaxy
And our love fades off into memories
Now I'm lost in the world alone
Baby now that you're gone, gone, gone!
(Chorus)
I'm wasting away
Can't handle the pain
I'm shattered to pieces, now there's nothing to say
I tried to be strong, there's no holding on
Baby, now I'm lost in the world alone!
Now that you're gone
Now I'm screwed up in my mind
Still thinking about you, yeah
I don't care what's wrong or right
All I got is the truth, oh
You might also likeJust understand boy, I need you here with me
My destiny, my only gravity
If I'm not your girl, boy, I just can't breathe
It's like the stars fall out of the galaxy
Our love fades off into memories
I'm lost in a world alone
Baby, now that you're gone, gone, gone!
I'm wasting away
Can't handle the pain
I'm shattered to pieces, now there's nothing to say
I tried to be strong, there's no holding on
Baby, now I'm lost in the world alone!
I'm wasting away
Can't handle the pain
I'm shattered to pieces, now there's nothing to say
I tried to be strong, there's no holding on
Baby, now I'm lost in the world alone!
You see, I try to be strong but there just ain't no way
That I can keep on fighting, yeah
Wish I could forget you, baby I miss you!
I'm stuck in this world alone!
I'm wasting away
Can't handle the pain
I'm shattered to pieces, now there's nothing to say
I tried to be strong, there's no holding on
Baby, now I'm lost in the world alone!
I'm wasting away
Can't handle the pain
I'm shattered to pieces, now there's nothing to say
I tried to be strong, there's no holding on
Baby, now I'm lost in the world alone!
Now that you're gone, now that you're gone
Now that you're gone, now that you're gone
