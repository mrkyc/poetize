Stir, stir it up, while you're staring at my ass
Turn the beat up everytime we walk past
Moving too slow, double take fast
Who got the club turnt up up up up?
Who got the club turnt up up?
Who, who got the club turnt up up ?
Who, who, who got the club turnt up up?
We shut it down, we shut it down
It's the last call, throw your drinks on the ground
Everybody in the, in the club, get loud, loud, loud
Let's get wild!
Nights in the city
We love living it up
We dance and we drink 'til we're gone
'Cause we're on
Nights in the city
We love living it up
We dance and we drink 'til we're gone
'Cause we're on
Got the pink, pink overflowing in my cup
Now I'm going cray cray, put your hands up
Got them flows, tied it on my back
Near worldwide on things like that
