Shurning all in my time zone
I ain't talking about rhyme stones
I can get, I can get, I can get whatever I want
Push button, I start that
Horses all in my hair rest
Tell me what good is it if I be driving alone?
I know that you got the word babe
Blowflex, you ain't gotta flex babe
Keep on that I just want my babe
My babe
All day, all day
Moving, going big like it's breakfast boy
I don't giva
Moving like it's swisher engine make the boy
I don't giva
All these other niggas tryina holler but
I don't giva thing
I don't giva thing

It could all be so simple
But you make it hard
Don't you know money can't buy you my heart
And nothing is gonna change that out
You might also likeI was with you before all of that dough, yeah
And I'm still with you if you ain't got it no mo, yeah
'Cause I'll hustle with you and we'll get it back, yeah
But for real don't my nigga, don't take all that back
I know that you got the word babe
Blowflex, you ain't gotta flex babe
Keep on that I just want my babe
All day, all day
Moving, going big like it's breakfast boy
I don't giva
Moving like it's swisher engine make the boy
I don't giva
All these other niggas tryina holler but
I don't giva thing
I don't giva thing
I don't giva
I know that you got the word babe
Blowflex, you ain't gotta flex babe
Keep on that I just want my babe
All day, all day
Moving, going big like it's breakfast boy
I don't giva
Moving like it's swisher engine make the boy
I don't giva
All these other niggas tryina holler but
