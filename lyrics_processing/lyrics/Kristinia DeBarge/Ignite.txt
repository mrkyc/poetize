Oh-whoa
Yeah-yeah-yeah
Oh-whoa, yeah

Don't run away
Tell your worries you ain't scared
And you are here to stay
You are, you are
You're remarkable
Don't let nobody try to dim your light
Your light, your light

And as the music gets louder
Spread your arms and be ready to fly
If your days get harder
Remind yourself to always smile

Ignite the fire back in your life
Ignite the passion, make it worthwhile
Ignite the dreams that live within your mind
Let 'em shine bright
Ignite the fire back in your life
Ignite the passion, make it worthwhile
Ignite the dreams that live within your mind
Let 'em shine bright
You might also like
It is not the end
Just remember you can always stand and start again
Be you, be you
You're unforgettable
And beautiful all the time
The time, time

And as the music gets louder
Spread your arms and be ready to fly
If your days get harder
Remind yourself to always smile

Ignite the fire back in your life
Ignite the passion, make it worthwhile
Ignite the dreams that live within your mind
Let 'em shine bright
Ignite the fire back in your life
Ignite the passion, make it worthwhile
Ignite the dreams that live within your mind
Let 'em shine bright

Take the trip that you wanted to take
Drop the job that you really hate (Hate)
All you need is a little bit of faith
A little bit of faith, just a little bit of faith
Oh yeah, hey yeah, oh
A little bit of faith, oh-whoa, yeah
Ignite the fire back in your life
Ignite the passion, make it worthwhile
Ignite the dreams that live within your mind
Let 'em shine bright
Ignite the fire back in your life
Ignite the passion, make it worthwhile (Hey, hey, yeah)
Ignite the dreams that live within your mind
Let 'em shine bright

Take the trip that you wanted to take
Drop the job that you really hate
All you need is a little bit of faith
