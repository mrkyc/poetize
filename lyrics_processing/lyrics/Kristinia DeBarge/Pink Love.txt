Pull that seal, caress and feel it
Heart is racing, so impatient

Grab hold of me, eyes so wide open
I wanna see circular motion
Know my body, waves like the ocean (ooh)
I want you to make me feel
Petals blooming, so unreal
Silent kisses, give me chills
Pull my ribbon and open my seal, yeah

Got the chain from the middle
Love the pain just a little
I'm insane, solve my riddle
Love pink on the petals
All night, all night, all night
He want that pink love from me all night
All night, all night
He want that pink love from me

Sweet eruption, your love potion
Fire burning, boy I'm yearning
You might also like
Grab hold of me, eyes so wide open
I wanna see circular motion
Know my body, waves like the ocean (ooh)
I want you to make me feel
Petals blooming, so unreal
Silent kisses, give me chills
Pull my ribbon and open my seal, yeah

Got the chain from the middle
Love the pain just a little
I'm insane, solve my riddle
Love pink on the petals
All night, all night, all night
He want that pink love from me all night
All night, all night
He want that pink love from me

Grab hold of me, eyes so wide open
I wanna see circular motion
I wanna-

I want you to make me feel (Can't make me feel)
Petals blooming, so unreal
Silent kisses give me chills
Pull my ribbon and open my seal, yeah
Got the chain from the middle
Love the pain just a little
I'm insane, solve my riddle
Love pink on the petals
All night, all night, all night
He want that pink love from me all night
All night, all night
He want that pink love from me
