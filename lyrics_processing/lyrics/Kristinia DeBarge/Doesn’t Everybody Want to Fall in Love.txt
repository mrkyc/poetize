I think that I love him more, more than life itself
I know that I'll never find nothing close to him
Never gonna stop, I'll love him 'til I drop
Ain't never gonna let him go, oh
He drives me so crazy
I so love my baby
The way he be making me feel

I know you think I'm dead wrong (Dead wrong)
Said this should not be going on (Going on)
But are you gonna stop my heart (Stop my heart)
From falling in love?

Doesn't everybody wanna fall in love?
Doesn't everybody wanna need someone?
Remember when you told me that you didn't have no one?
You would've given anything to have someone
So don't hate on me, 'cause
He's so good to me
He's so sweet to me
I know that you don't think I know enough
But doesn't everyone wanna fall in love?
Fall in love

You think the way your too young, won't give me a break
I know when you fell in love, you were seventeen
I bet you didn't stop when it was getting hard
And I know you didn't let him go, oh
So how is this different
And why should I listen to you?
Don't know what's in my heart

I know you think I'm dead wrong (Dead wrong)
Said this should not be going on (Going on)
And are you gonna stop my heart
From falling in love?

Doesn't everybody wanna fall in love?
Doesn't everybody wanna need someone?
Remember when you told me that you didn't have no one?
You would've given anything to have someone
So don't hate on me, 'cause
He's so good to me
He's so sweet to me
I know that you don't think I know enough
Doesn't everybody wanna fall in love?
Doesn't everybody wanna need someone?
Remember when you told me that you didn't have no one?

He's so sweet to me
I know that you don't think I know enough
Doesn't everybody wanna fall in love?
I've been looking at him, he's been looking at me
It don't really matter what they really think about us
No, no, no, no, no, no
And we can hold it down forever
Long as you and I are together
You don't know what's in my heart

I know you think I'm dead wrong (Dead wrong)

And are you gonna stop my heart
From falling in love?
