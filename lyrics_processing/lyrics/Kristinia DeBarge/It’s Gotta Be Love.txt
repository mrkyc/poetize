It's gotta be love
It's gotta be love
It's gotta be love

Staring out my window pane
Waiting for the phone to ring
All I want is just to see you again
Ooh-wee, baby, I miss you so
So much that I can't sleep
So much that I can't breathe
My heart, it skips a beat when I think of you and me

It's gotta be love
Something about you, boy (It's gotta be love)
You bring me so much joy (It's gotta be love)
I can't wait no more
I wanna be with you and do with you
Everything you wanna do, boy
And when you're next to me (It's gotta be love)
Feels like a fantasy (It's gotta be love)
Oh boy, I can't believe (It's like I've died and gone to heaven)

Feels like I wasn't living before I met you
Don't think that I can go a day without you
I spend my days planning to be around you
(Nobody else, there's only you)
No doubt this must be love
You're all I'm thinking of
It's taking over me
So what else could this be?
You might also like
It's gotta be love
Something about you, boy (It's gotta be love)
You bring me so much joy (It's gotta be love)
I can't wait no more
I wanna be with you and do with you
Everything you wanna do, boy
And when you're next to me (It's gotta be love)
Feels like a fantasy (It's gotta be love)
Oh boy, I can't believe (It's like I've died and gone to heaven)

Always keep your picture in my bag (My bag)
Always looking at that photograph (Photograph)
It's crazy, I don't usually act like that (Like that)
Guess I must be in love (Sometimes I wanna)
Sometimes I wanna call when I know you're not home (Call, my home)
Just to hear your voice and your sexy little tone (Little tone)
What you do to me, boy, you don't even know
It's gotta be (It's gotta be, it's gotta be)

It's gotta be love
Something about you, boy (It's gotta be love)
You bring me so much joy (It's gotta be love)
Oh boy, I can't believe
I wanna be with you and do with you
Everything you wanna do, boy
And when you're next to me (It's gotta be love)
Feels like a fantasy (It's gotta be love)
Oh boy, I can't believe (It's like I've died and gone to heaven)
It's gotta be love
Something about you, boy (It's gotta be love, baby you)
You bring me so much joy (It's gotta be love, you bring me so)
I can't wait no more
I wanna be with you and do with you
Everything you wanna do (Do with you)
And when you're next to me, oh (It's gotta be love)
Feels like a fantasy (It's gotta be love)
Oh boy, I can't believe (It's like I've died and gone to heaven)
(It's gotta be love)
Something about you, boy
You bring me so much joy
I can't wait no more
I wanna be with you and do with you
Everything you wanna do (Do with you everything you wanna do)
And when you're next to me (It's gotta be love), whoa
Feels like a fantasy (It's gotta be love, whoa)
