Check it

Yo, two in the morning, sittin' in the room
Called you up because I wanna zoom-zoom in poom-poom
Girl, don't front, tell me what you want
Grab my sneaks then I grab my blunt
Meet me on the corner, baby, just you
Plus your crew 'cause you know how we do
On the down low, you won't forget
See, I keep it real, it's a full course meal
A pie for dessert - honey, wear that skirt
And me and you tear the roof off the mutha
Never had a lover 'til you had a swashbuckler
See, that's Pirate talk, and I walk the walk
Baby, you can leave if it ain't what you thought
But you're goddamn skippy it is
Been doin' it for years, better ask your peers
