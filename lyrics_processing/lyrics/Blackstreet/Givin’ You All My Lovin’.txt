I know I found someone that likes to do it right
No more looking up thinking I found love at first sight
You're here now, I feel you've been here all my life
Darling, you know I feel so good, I want you
(And) Speaking of which, I wanna make you feel the same
Tell me what you need, no one takes you from me
I'd rather fight than switch, I'm not the kind for playing games
It's crazy then positive
I wanna give it to you, give it to you, give it to you
You might also like
Givin' you all my lovin'
(Fifty percent won't do, I wanna give it all to you)
Givin' you all my lovin'
(All, my lovin')
So let me give it to you

This is a night you'll give and take scenario
You want me and you know I want your body and soul
Good things should last so let's take it nice and slow
'Cause I feel brand new, and it's all because of you, baby
(This is your night) Have it any way you want it
And it don't stop, now and forever
(All the love I have to give is yours) I'm more than in this thing
I'm not here to take, I'm giving you all of my love

Givin' you all my lovin'
(Fifty percent won't do, I wanna give it all to you)
Givin' you all my lovin'
(I wanna give you all of my lovin', baby)
So let me give it to you

Check, check, check it out
Ayo (A'ight), 'cause I make it right
Good lovin' if you want it, nothin' less than a hundred
Start to rub you down and drive you crazy
You know I wanna check, baby, check, baby, check, baby, check, baby
I kick the Willie Bobo to let you know
I freak you from the couch to the bed to the floor
I'm Audi 5 when I'm done 'cause I do run-run-run
I'm giving you all my love, hon
(All my lovin') I really think that you deserve it
You deserve all of my lovin', baby, yeah, you do
(All my lovin') If it's the last thing that we do, I wanna give you all of my lovin'

Givin' you all my lovin'
(Fifty percent won't do, I wanna give it all to you)
Givin' you all my lovin'

I wanna give you a hundred percent, baby, yes I do
So just take my love and do what you wanna do
Badababababa
(That means I love you)
Badabababa
(Yes, I do)
Badabababa
(I really love you, girl)
Bodya, bodya, bodyoddyoddyoddyop
(I do, darling, fifty percent won't do)
Badabababa
(I wanna give it to you, give it to you, give it to you)
