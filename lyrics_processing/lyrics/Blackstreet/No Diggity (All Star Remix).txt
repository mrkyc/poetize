Yeah
You know what
I like the playettes
No diggity, no doubt, uh
Play on playette, play on playette
Yo Street, drop the verse

Shorty get down, good Lord
Baby got 'em open all over town
Strictly biz, she don't play around
Cover much grounds, got game by the pound
Getting paid is her forte
Each and every day, true player way
I can't get her out of my mind (Well)
I think about the girl all the time (Well well)
Eastside to the Westside
Pushin' phat rides, it's no surprise
She got tricks in the stash, stacking up the cash
Fast when it comes to the gas
By no means average
She's on when she's got to have it
Baby, you're a perfect ten, I wanna get in
Can I get down so I can win?

I like the way you work it
(No diggity) I got to bag it up (Bag it up)
I like the way you work it
(No diggity) I got to bag it up (Bag it up, girl)
I like the way you work it
(No diggity) I got to bag it up (Bag it up)
I like the way you work it
(No diggity) I got to bag it up (Get up)

She's got class and style
Street knowledge by the pound
Baby never act wild, very low key on the profile
Catchin' feelings is a no
Let me tell you how it goes
Her's the word, spend's the verb
Lovers hit curves so freak what you heard
Rollin' with the phatness
You don't even know what the half is
You gotta pay to play
Just for shorty, bang-bang, to look your way
I like the way you work it
Trump tight all day, every day
You're blowing my mind, maybe in time
Baby, I can get you in my ride
I like the way you work it
(No diggity) I got to bag it up (Bag it up)
I like the way you work it
(No diggity) I got to bag it up (Oh oh oh yeah)
I like the way you work it
(No diggity) I got to bag it up (Bag it up, babe)
I like the way you work it
(No diggity) I got to bag it up (Hey hey, get up)

Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo (Hey yo, that girl looks good)
Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo (Play on, play on, player)
Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo (You're my kind of girl) (No diggity)
Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo (Hey yo)

'Cause that's my peeps and we rolls deep
Flyin' first class from New York City to Blackstreet
What you know about me? Not a motherfuckin' thing
Cartier wooden frames sported by my shorty
As for me, icy gleaming pinky diamond ring
We be's the baddest clique up on the scene
Ain't you getting bored with these fake-ass broads?
I shows and proves, no doubt, I been diggin' you so
Please excuse, if I come across rude, that's just me
And that's how the playette's got to be
Stay kickin' game with a capital G
Ask the peoples on my block, I'm as real as can be
Word is bond, faking jacks ain't never been me
So, Teddy, pass the word to your nigga Chauncey
I be sending the call, let's say around 3:30
Queen Pen and Blackstreet, no diggity
(No diggity, no doubt, baby)
I like the way you work it
(No diggity) I got to bag it up
(Girl, you got it going on)
I like the way you work it
(No diggity) I got to bag it up
(Play on, play on, play on)
(Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo)
I like the way you work it
(No diggity) I got to bag it up
(Hey, ooh)
(Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo)
I like the way you work it
(No diggity) I got to bag it up
(Hey, yeah, babe)

Yeah, ya don't stop, one two, uh
Yeah
Right
Blackstreet, 9-6, son, what
All-Star remix
Play on, play on, 'cause I like it
No diggity, no doubt
We out, we out
