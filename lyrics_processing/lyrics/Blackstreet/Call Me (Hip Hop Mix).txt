Jigga murder tracks, let the rap flow kill ya
Rock platinum jewelry, young ladies think it's silver
Need a fix? Hit me on the hip, but don't get berzerk and get whipped
Put my buisness in the street like work
I rock rocky ices, duck po-lices
Through your town run up and down like poppy prices
And through somethin', let me know - you wanna do somethin'?
I'll meet you by your building in a brand new somethin'
That's not a thing, I just copped a Range
The 4-dot-6 with the hot wood grain
Drop the front like hydaulics, got her hypnotic
Like the dearly departed Mr. Christopher Wallace
Jigga got it if you need it (Uh-huh)
Willin' to give it if you willin' to live it, lovin' killin' the digits
It's the rap black sheep along with the Blackstreet
We drop it Monday and go platinum that week
