Let's talk about us
I wanna talk about us
Lets talk about us
Blackstreet
Every time i call a single time
You didn't pop up in my mind (Ooh)
Like one more day
Where ever i go what ever i do (I think of you)
Your kisses and the way you hug me
The look of passion in your eyes
Every word you say whenever i'm down
You making me smile baby

Ooh girl, I love you so
Never ever ever gonna let you go
Once I get my hands on you, ooh-oh
Ooh girl, I love you so
Never ever ever gonna let you go
'Cause baby I'm so into you
(Check this)

(Ooh girl) When you're looking at me (Girl)
It makes me feel like I'm your world
And I feel the same
You are my rainbow after the rains done and gone
Oh, I just wanna make you mine until the end of time
When clock cease it will only be you and me, darling
