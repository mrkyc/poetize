I like the players
No Diggity, No doubt
Play on play that
Play on play that
Yo Dre drop the verse
It's going down fad to Blackstreet
The homeys got abby collab creations Funk like acne
No doubt I put it down never slouch
As long as my credit could vouch
A dog couldn't catch me, *ass* out
Tell me who could stop with Dre makin' moves
Attracting honeys like a magnet
Giving them ig-asms with my mellow accent
Still moving his flavor with the homeys Blackstreet & Teddy
The original rump shakers
Shorty get down, good Lord
Baby got 'em open all over town
Strickly biz she don't play around
Cover much grounds
Got game by the pound
Gettin paid is her forte
Each and every day true player way
I can't get her outta my mind
I think about the girl all the time
East side to the west side
Push your fat rides it's no surprise
She got tricks in the stash
Stacking up the cash
Fast when it comes to the gas
By no means average
She's on when she's got to have it
Baby your a perfect 10, I wanna get in
Can I get down so I can win

I like the way you work it (no diggity)
I got to bag it up (bag it up)
I like the way you work it (no diggity)
I got to bag it up
She's got class and style
Street knowledge, buy the pound
Baby never act wild, very low key on the profile
Catching villians is a no
Let me tell you how it goes
Curve's the word, spin's the verb
Lovers it curves so freak what you heard
Rollin with the fatness
You don't even know what the half is
You gotta pay to play
Just for shorty bang bang to look your way
I like the way you work it
Trump tight all day, everyday
You're blowing my mind, maybe in time
Baby I can get you with my ride
Hey yo hey yo hey yo hey yo
(hey yo that girl looks good)
Hey yo hey yo hey yo hey yo

Hey yo hey yo hey yo hey yo
(you're my kind of girl)
Hey yo hey yo hey yo hey yo
Cuz that's my peeps and we rows D
Flying first class from NY City to Blackstreet
What chu know about me
Not a (motha fuckin') thing
Cartier wooded frames supported by my shorty
Ask for me
Icy gleem and pinky diamond ring
We be's the baddest click up on this scene
Ain't you getting bored with these fake ass broads
High shows and proves, no doubt
I be diggin' you so
Please excuse if I come across rude
That's just me and that's how a player's got to be
Stay kickin' game with a capital G
Ask the peoples on my block I'm as real as can be
Word is born
Faking moves never been my thing
So Teddy pass the word to your (nigga) Chauncey
I'll be sending a car, lets say around 3:30
Queen Pen and Blackstreet, it's no diggity
Hey yo hey yo hey yo hey yo
Hey yo hey yo hey yo hey yo
Yeah, Come on
Jackie in full effect
Lisa in full effect
