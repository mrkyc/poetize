Yeah, hey baby
You remember the time when we first fell in love
We were so happy
We didn't care about none of the materialistic things
We were just having a lot of fun, staying in love
But check this out, let me take you there

I think I'm falling in love again
Falling in love again
I think I'm falling in love again
Falling in love again with you girl

Drop it, come closer
Yo Dave, take 'em to the hood

Reminisce about the past
As we held each other's hand and we took our first dance
Even at the start I knew, the only one I'll ever love is you baby
I remember when we both told each other these three words (I love you)
I love you, oh yeah

My whole world, I gave it all to you
Because of the love that we've shared
Girl, I know your heart will always be right here
I can't stop thinking 'bout my past
Girl, I wanna make it last

Falling in love again

Falling in love again with you girl

Yo Dave, I think I got 'em by now
But let's tell 'em 'bout the happy days

You made all my dreams come true
Like when you told me that you're having my baby
This miracle creates a stronger bond
And it's so beautiful the way our love grows
Now it's time to take it a little further
Will you say 'I do'? I'll take care of you
Forever and ever baby, you know that this takes two
So tell me what would I do without you?
I can't stop thinking 'bout the past
Girl I wanna make it last, I'm falling

I think I'm falling in love again (I'm in love again, with you)
Falling in love again
I think I'm falling in love again
Falling in love again with you girl
Teddy won't you sing it, yeah
I think I'm falling in love again (Whoa)
I think I'm falling in love again
I think I'm falling in love again (I think I'm falling in love, with you girl)
