It's alright, baby

I can't get you out of my mind (Oh, no)
Your love is one of a kind (You're one of a kind)
You've given so much of yourself (You know I can't do it, baby)
I swear, don't want nobody else (Listen)

Baby, don't you know that I'll do anything for you?
I'll give you my time, give you my heart
Give you the world if you want me to
Life hasn't been easy
Knowing that you love somebody else
Ain't nothing I can do about it
All I have to blame is myself, and I can't

I can't get you out of my mind (Oh, no)
Your love is one of a kind (You're one of a kind)
You've given so much of yourself (You know I can't do it, baby)
I swear, don't want nobody else (Listen)

I thought I had you fooled with the girls and the things that I was puttin' down
But little did I know, miss thing was spreadin' babies all over town
I don't know what she told you
But I bounced up on her love one time
I took her to my house, laid her on the couch (Oh, yeah)
Set it affray, then threw her ass out
So what about the girl in the six-four?
She didn't mean a damn thing to me, baby
She needed a ride from the jam
And being the man that I am, I said, "You can"
And what about the girl in the drop-top?
With the lollipop, at the light by the bus stop
You must've been fooled into thinkin' the kid was slack
Girl, I did my thing, but now, I want my baby back
Girl, I can't

I can't get you out of my mind (Can't get you out of mind)
Your love is one of a kind (You're one of a kind, baby)
You've given so much of yourself (Girl, you know I can't give you up)
I swear, don't want nobody else

Damn, just picked the wrong time to mess up
From the time you left me up until this moment
I just couldn't get you off my mind
But I know if we could start all over again
I know things won't be the same (Can't get you out of my mind)
I can make it better
I swear, I swear
Girl, I swear

I can't get you out of my mind (Can't get you out of mind)
Your love is one of a kind (Given me so much)
You've given so much of yourself (Girl, I swear, I swear, I swear I can't do a damn thing without you, baby)
I swear, don't want nobody else (Oh)
I can't get you out of my mind (See, I don't know what to do without your love, yeah)
Your love is one of a kind (I love you, baby)
You've given so much of yourself (And I need, oh)
I swear, don't want nobody else (In my life, baby)
