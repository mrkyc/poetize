(No, no, no diggity)
Yeah, this is the remix remix
Brought you by Blackstreet (One, one, one, two)
No diggity, no doubt
Play on, playa (One, one, one, two)
She was a gold digger
Yo, Black, drop the verse

She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
Said, 'I don't mind but what do you mean I am the one
Who will dance, on the floor, in around?" (No, No, No diggity)
She said I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in around (No, No, No diggity)
She told me her name was Billie Jean as she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of bein' the one
Who will dance, on the floor, in around (No, No, No diggity)

People always told me, "be careful what you do
Don't go around breakin young girls' hearts"
And mama always told me, "Be careful who you love
Be careful what you do, because a lie become the truth"
Hey, yeah
You might also like
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son (No diggity, no doubt about it)
She said I am the one
But the kid is not my son (No, No, No, no diggity)

For forty days and for forty nights I was on the scene
But who could stand when she's in demand her schemes and blames
Gonna dance, on a floor, in around, (No, No, No, diggity)
So take my strong advice:
Just remember to always think twice (No)
Don't think twice (Don't think twice, hoo)
She told my baby imagined free and she looked at me
And showed a photo of a baby cry his eyes were like mine
So we danced, on a floor, in around (No, No, No diggity)
(The bridge)

People always told me, "be careful what you do
Don't go around breakin' young girls' hearts"
But she she came and stood right by me
And I smelled her sweet perfume
It happend much too soon
She called me to the room, hey, yeah
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son (The kid is not my son)
She said I am the one
But the kid is not my son (No, No, no diggity)
(Oh, no no no, Billie Jean, yeah)
Billie Jean is not my lover (Oh no)
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son (No diggity, no doubt about it)
She said I am the one
But the kid is not my son (No no no no no no, Billie, Billie Jean)

Billie Jean is not my lover (Oh)
Billie Jean is not my lover (Billie)
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover (Oh no)
Billie Jean is not my lover (No diggity, no doubt about it)
Billie Jean is not my lover (Not my lover, no no)
Billie Jean is not my lover (Oh no)
