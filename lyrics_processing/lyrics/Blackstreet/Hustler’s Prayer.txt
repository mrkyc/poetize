My soul is so dirty
I've been hustlin' every day
Now I know that I should pray
But I wonder if He hear what I'd say
I know my mama didn't raise me this way
But I gotta feed my family
If I could just make it through one more day
I could live the right way

Lord, you know it's been 12-15 years I've been in the game
The way I live this life, forgive me, I know it's a shame
But who'd a thought I'd make it this far
From all the brothers and others that I've lost
I know I'm fortunate not to be one of those souls you choose
And I'm sorry for the ones I sent
Down here is to live or die, what was I suppose to do?
You know I wasn't quite ready
For this soul of mine to come before you

My soul is so dirty
I've been hustlin' every day
Now I know that I should pray
But I wonder if He hear what I'd say
I know my mama didn't raise me this way
But I gotta feed my family
If I could just make it through one more day
I could live the right way
You might also like
I know I may not have been right but I've been fair
I guess that's why you sought to keep me here
You must have somethin' better for me
Just give me a sign Lord, please show me
Just wanna thank you for the ones you've placed
I pray you watched over them, 'cause you watched over me
Until you clean us up Lord, like we should be
I know you will eventually

My soul is so dirty
I've been hustlin' every day
Now I know that I should pray
But I wonder if He hear what I'd say
I know my mama didn't raise me this way
But I gotta feed my family
If I could just make it through one more day
I could live the right way

Please watch over my babies and they mamas, too
'Cause they don't know what they daddy do
But this one thing, I promise you
I won't let my seeds do the same thing, too
Lord, bless my mama, you know how much she means to me
Despite the way I live, I know she still loves me
She's up in church, cryin' and prayin' for me
And I'ma try to see her there on Sunday, I said maybe
My soul is so dirty
I've been hustlin' every day
Now I know that I should pray
But I wonder if He hear what I'd say
I know my mama didn't raise me this way
But I gotta feed my family
If I could just make it through one more day
