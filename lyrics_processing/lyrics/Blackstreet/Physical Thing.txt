Just a physical thing
I gotta do my thing, yeah yeah
No baby, no baby, no baby
Check check check check it out

Tonight's the night, gonna do my thing
I'm gon find me a lady, we gonna dance at the party
And when the party's over, I'm gonna start her to the crib
So I can get to know her better, so I can see what she's made of

(Cause I wanna love...)
I wanna love you, hold you (hold you), squeeze you, please you
(Let me do my thing tonight baby)
And I wanna touch you (touch you), kiss you (kiss you, baby), but don't get emotional
(Don't get emotional, cause baby is a physical thing)

Hey girl, let me do my thing, is a physical thing, baby
(Let me do my thing to you)
Hey girl (hey girl) let me do my thing, (oh yeah) is a physical thing, baby

I'm goin' to the party to find someone, cause you'll be there waitin' for me
So we can start out to the crib, let me get to know you better
So we can get a little busy, let me show you what I made of, girl
