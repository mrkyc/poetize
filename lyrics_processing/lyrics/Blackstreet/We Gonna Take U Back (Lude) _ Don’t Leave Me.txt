What we're gonna do right here is go back
Way back
Back into time
No, baby, no, baby, no, baby
No, no, no
If you take your love away from me (No, baby, no, baby, no, baby)
I'll go crazy (No, no, no)
I'll go insane
No, baby, no, baby, no, baby
No, no, no
No, baby, no, baby, no, baby
No, no, no

You've got your problems, baby, and I've got mine
Let's just end it all by puttin' it together, yeah
When you say you love me it don't mean a thing
If you cared you'd be there like you used to be, yeah
I'm searching for the words to make you realize
That I really, really want you to stay
Tears of frustration I hold inside
But if you walk away you'll make this grown man cry

Don't leave (No, baby, no, baby, no, baby)
Don't leave me, girl (No, no, please)
Please stay with me tonight (No, baby, no, baby, no, baby)
Don't leave me, girl (Yeah, oh yeah)
Please stay with me to

Forget my pride, girl, I'm begging you
You're my heart, you're my soul
You've got so much control
My love runs deeper than the ocean and sea
But if you sail away, you'll take the center piece of me

Don't leave (Don't leave, no, no, no)
Don't leave me, girl
Please stay with me tonight (No, baby, no, baby, no, baby)
Don't leave me, girl
Please stay with me to

No, no, no, don't leave (No, baby, no, baby, no, baby)
Don't leave me, girl (No, no, no)
Please stay with me tonight (No, baby, no, baby, no, baby)
Don't leave me, girl (You can't leave me)
Please stay with me to

Stay (Come on and stay with me)
Stay (Don't leave)
Stay (Oh, yeah, yeah)
Stay right here with me forever (I love you)
Stay (Yes I do)
Stay (I need you)
Stay (Don't leave without you)
Stay right here with me forever
If you take your love away from me
I'll go crazy, crazy, crazy, insane
If you take your love away from me
I'll go crazy, I'll go insane
If you take your love away from me (If you take your love away)
I'll go crazy (Crazy, crazy), I'll go insane (Please stay with me)
Stay (Forever)
Stay (Forever)
Stay
Stay right here with me forever (Baby, don't take your love away, no, no, no, no)
Stay (Stay with me)
Stay ('Cause you know I love you)
Stay (You know that I need you)
Stay right here with me forever (Yes I do, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
No, no, no
