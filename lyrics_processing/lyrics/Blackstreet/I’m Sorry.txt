I'm sorry
I would do anything for you
Will you forgive me?
Just don't cry, don't cry
Listen
Just wanted to talk to you
I'm sorry

Just when you think you're strong enough
Temptation raises it's head
'Cause I kept on thinkin'
That I got a good woman back home
But I didn't regret it 'til it was over
(What should I do?)

I shoulda never told
(You were untrue)
How could I let it show?
That girl put a spell on me
I couldn't stop thinking about it
But I've got my lady
That I can't live without, oh
You might also like
If you look in my eyes, it says I'm sorry
(I'm so sorry)
I didn't mean to hurt or ever make you cry
(Didn't mean to make you cry)
I know I've got a good thing, girl, so don't you worry
(No no no no)
I'll go outta my way to keep you satisfied

We've got a future, gotta move along
I know it's easier said than done
But don't let this one mistake
Put a break on what we've made
Please forgive me, I'm so sorry, oh

Even though I forgive you
It won't be the same
All those sleepless nights
Explaining everything
That girl put a spell on me
I couldn't stop thinking about it
But I've got my lady
That I can't live without
If you look in my eyes, it says I'm sorry
(Said I'm sorry, baby, baby, baby)
I didn't mean to hurt or ever make you cry
(I didn't mean to hurt, didn't mean to make you cry)
I know I've got a good thing, girl, so don't you worry (No no)
I'll go outta my way to keep you satisfied

Girl, I'm sorry, forgive me
There's no reason why
Please don't cry
I love you, oh, no, oh, oh
Lady, lady, little lady
I need you by my side
I'm saying that I'm sorry

If you look in my eyes, it says I'm sorry
(Said I didn't mean to hurt you, baby. no no)
I didn't mean to hurt or ever make you cry
(Don't wanna make you cry, no no)
I know I've got a good thing, girl, so don't you worry
(See, I've got a good thing right here beside me, lady)
I'll go outta my way (i'll go out of my way) to keep you satisfied
(to keep you satis...satis.. satis...satisfied)
If you look in my eyes, it says I'm sorry
(Oh, come on, babe)
I didn't mean to hurt (don't wanna hurt you, baby) or ever make you cry
(I wanna be right there to give you all of me, yeah yeah yeah)
I know I've got a good thing, girl, so don't you worry
(We've got a good thing, baby)
I'll go outta my way to keep you satisfied
