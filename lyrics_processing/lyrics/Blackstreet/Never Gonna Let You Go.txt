Never gonna let you go away (You belong, yeah)
You belong to me (Yes you do, baby)
And I'm never gonna let you go (Woah-oh-oh)
Never gonna let you go away (Mmm, singin' this song for you, baby)
We were meant to be in love, love
Take your time, Mark, just sing it for 'em

I regret the moment when I heard you say
You don't want no part of me no more
But I'm so glad that you changed your mind
You're staying in my life forevermore, forevermore
'Cause I'll never

Never gonna let you go away (Can't do it, baby, no, no)
You belong to me
And I'm never gonna let you go (No, never)
Never gonna let you go away (I ain't tryna let you go nowhere now, baby, no)
We were meant to be in love, love (in love, in love, in love, in love)

Now I must admit that I did you wrong
Hiding all your tears
When you cried for me to come back home
And then you tell me
Part-time loving just won't do
I can't say a word but
Oh, I must have been a fool
But this time, this time, I'll never

You belong to me (You belong to me, yeah, yeah)
And I'm never gonna let you go
Never gonna let you go away (Won't let you go, I can't do without you, baby)
We were meant to be in love, love (We were meant to, we were meant to be in love)
Chauncey, won't you help me sing it? Yeah

Now, girl, I know
We've had our share of ups and downs (Yeah)
But we can make it if we try (Only if we try)
And your friends are telling you
That I'm not the one for you
But I'll never (Never)
No, no, never (No, no, never)
Let you go (Let you go)

Never gonna let you go away (Baby, I can't let you go)
You belong to me (You belong to me, yeah)
And I'm never gonna let you go (So I'll never let you go, no, no, no)
Never gonna let you go away (I can't let you go away)
We were meant to be in love, love (See, I've been waiting all my life for a girl just like you)
(So baby, I just can't let you go)
(Go, girl, let you go nowhere)
Never gonna let you go away
You belong to me (You belong to me, baby)
And I'm never gonna let you go
Never gonna let you go away (Can't you let go nowhere, no, no, no)
