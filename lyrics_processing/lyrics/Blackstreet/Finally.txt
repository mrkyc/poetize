You know you and I've been through many hardships in life
They say people who believe, hardship has made us doubt
The very God of gods
But the apostle Paul said in his scripture
We are troubled on every side, yet not in distressed
We are perplexed but not in dispair
Persecuted but not forsaken
Cast down but we are never distroyed
And the conclusion of the whole matter is that
Finally the storm is over
It's time for us to reap what we have sewn
No doubt my brothers and sisters
God has given us a miracle, finally
Blackstreet

Finally we'll make it through the storm and the rain
It's time to give and praise and bless the Lord
If you believe in miracles, just you wait and see
'Cause finally we'll make it through it all

Bless the Lord (give him blessings)
Bless the Lord (give him blessings, yeah yeah)
'Cause finally (oh lord) we'll make it through it all
(finally we'll make it through it all)
Bless the Lord (yeah yeah)
Bless the Lord (Bless the lord, bless the lord)
'Cause finally we'll make it through the storm (gotta give him praises and props yeah, oh yeah yeah)
You might also like
We've had our ups and downs
Sometimes there no way out, I know He is there
To lead me and guide me every step of the way, yeah
(Your grace, my joy, constant friend indeed
Everything that I do, I owe it all to you
I bless your name)

Bless the Lord (Oh lord)
Bless the Lord (Bless your name, yeah)
'Cause finally (finally) we'll make it through it all (said we'll make it through it all)
Bless the Lord (Bless his holy name)
Bless the Lord (give him all the praise yea)
'Cause finally (finally we will) we'll make it through the storm (said we'll make it through the storm hey hey hey)

To every believer, all things work together for the good
To him that love the Lord
It's time for us to speak to those things
That are not as though they were
So I command every household to be blessed
I command every marriage to work out
I command every broken heart to be heal
I command prosperity upon my life
It's my time, it's my time, finally, finally
The miracle is here
C'mon Blackstreet, c'mon Fellowship
Let's bless the Lord
