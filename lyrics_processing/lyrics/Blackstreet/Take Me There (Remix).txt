Sittin' here thinkin 'bout our yesterday

Just the thought of you brings a smile upon my face
That's how it makes me feel to see you everyday

Where smiles come to life, and dreams come true

Let's make a wish
Close your eyes and count to five
Cuz you know that everything will be all right

Angelica the one with all the exposure
Dil is the one they drive in the stroller
And Tommy is the one with snot on his shoulders
While Dil cried to sleep till his eyes are beat
And I couldn't be Chuckie, Chuckie too petro
Chucky get scared, Chucky says let's go
If I was a Rugrat, it would of been so real
Me and my twin would've been just like Phil and Lil

Now with one wish, Blink grant you one trip
Where we going this adventure

See and you're my little brother that I'll come get
Run with, but it gotta be done quick
