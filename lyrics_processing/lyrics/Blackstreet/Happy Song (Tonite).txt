Tonight
Gotta take these records off the shelf
Play something special for yourself
It's over now
Gotta leave your troubles far behind
Or just enough to ease your mind
'Cause only time can decide
Baby, you'll be alright this time (Oh, oh, oh-oh, I, oh, I)
This time (Oh, oh, oh-oh, I, oh, I)

Say my name when you feel the pain
I'll be there to shelter when it's pouring rain
If I can do anything, girl, you know I'll try
Times are rough, you feel you're going nowhere
Your sadness hurts so bad and there's no one to care
The sun shines after the rain, girl, I know

'Cause I been there before in this world all alone
And you been there for me, and you gave me your all
I've been there before, you'll come around
And you'll be alright, 'cause this is your time, so

Tonight
Gotta take these records off the shelf
Play something special for yourself
It's over now
Gotta leave your troubles far behind
Or just enough to ease your mind
'Cause only time can decide
Baby, you'll be alright this time (Oh, oh, oh-oh, I, oh, I)
This time (Oh, oh, oh-oh, I, oh, I)
You might also like
Just when you think love's about to end
That's when you find a new beginning, it's a part of life
You wonder why you go all through a change
Why it seemed like things never go your way
Girl, I know how it feels to be alone

'Cause I been there before at the bottom alone
I know the way to reach the top, you got to let go
I've been insecure, you'll come around
And you'll be alright, 'cause this is your time, so

Tonight
Gotta take these records off the shelf
Play something special for yourself
It's over now
Gotta leave your troubles far behind
Or just enough to ease your mind
'Cause only time (Time), can decide (Can decide)
Baby, you'll be alright this time
(Yeah, yeah)
Oh, tonight
Gotta take these records off the shelf
Play something special for yourself
It's over now
Gotta leave your troubles far behind
Or just enough to ease your mind
Oh, tonight
Gotta take these records off the shelf
Play something special for yourself
It's over now
Gotta leave your troubles far behind
Or just enough to ease your mind
Oh, tonight
Gotta take these records off the shelf
Here's something special for yourself
Oh, tonight
Troubles are far behind
Let me ease your mind
