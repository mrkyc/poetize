We givin' honor to God
Who's a head of our house
Thanking Him for His many blessings
And all He's done for us
And Blackstreet would like to share
All He's given us, with you

Jesus is real
Yes, He is real to me
More precious than silver
More precious than diamond rings
Or anything that I could give Him
It wouldn't mean a thing
It's good to know the love inside from Him
It guides me through
And ain't it good to know He's true?

I, I know the Lord is real
And this is how I feel
In time it will reveal
He sacrificed, He gave His life for us
It'll all reveal in time
You might also like
Yes, it will all reveal in time (I know it will)
So you don't have to worry
You don't have to be afraid (Oh)
All you got to do is trust in Him
And never doubt
He will always be there for you
He will never let you down
And I believe in that
'Cause I'm a living witness to this, y'all (Yes, I am, yes, I am)
'Cause without God, my life would be nothin'
So if you believe in what I'm sayin'
I want you all to come on and repeat after me (Come on)
I know the Lord is real
