Baby, baby, baby
I wanna know you
Place no one above you
I wanna love you
Baby, baby, baby
I wanna be your man

I remember the first time I came to this park
It was one day last May, I saw you lookin' like a star
I'll never forget the scent of your perfume
Girl, I just gotta see you again
To ask you may I have a chance to be with you?
Girl, I'll never forget how I traveled to the moon
Now I'm waitin' in the park, waitin' after dark
I've got to see you again, oh

Baby, baby, baby (Oh, baby)
I wanna know you (Wanna know you)
Place no one above you (Ooh)
I wanna love you (Oh yeah)
Baby, baby, baby (Wanna be your man)
I wanna be your man (Baby, take it from me one time, oh, mmm)

So I dream a little dream of us, we're holding hands
And we take a long walk down in love land
My palms are sweatin' and my heart's beatin' fast
'Cause you smiled and said you'd see me again, oh
I ain't gonna let you get away this time
That's why I waited here so long
I'm gonna make you mine
Still I'm waitin' in the park, waitin' after dark
Waiting here to see you again

Baby, baby, baby (Ooh, baby)
I wanna know you (Wanna know you)
Place no one above you (Oh yeah)
I wanna love you (Oh)
Baby, baby, baby (Wanna be your man)
I wanna be your man (Come on, help me sing it, help me sing it)

I loved you from the moment
That you graced your beauty in front of me
And I just can't wait, baby, to see you again
'Cause I wanna be your
I wanna be your man
Listen, baby, I wanna be your man
Oh yeah, oh yeah, girl, baby
Baby, baby, baby (Wanna know you)
I wanna know you (Oh yeah)
Place no one above you (No one above you)
I wanna love you
Baby, baby, baby (Ooh, baby)
I wanna be your man (Your man and only your man, oh yeah)
Baby, baby, baby (So what do you wanna do?)
I wanna know you (Tell me)
Place no one above you (Where do you wanna go?)
I wanna love you (Oh yeah)
Baby, baby, baby (How can I get with you?)
