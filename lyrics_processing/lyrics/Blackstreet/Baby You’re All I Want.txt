Hey ma
I know you don't understand me and the things that I do
But I think it's victory for us if we could just hold on
Let's keep this thing strong
I love you and I believe you love me, too
And I wanna spend the rest of my life with you
That's my word

From the projects in BK
All the way down to the villa copped in VA
Let's not forget 'bout the 30 footed doc in the bay
With keys of your own for when you wanna take it out to play
Now you wanna flip the script
Your friends got you talkin' real slick
I guess the forgot that night I
Saw you at the bus stop, suckin' on a lollipop
Took your bus pass
And put your pretty ass up in the drop

Baby, you're all I want
Baby, you're all I need
Hold on tight 'til we get it right
Can't let go, we got to keep it tight
Baby, you're all I want
Baby, you're all I need
You're too close to joe just to let it go
You need to stop flippin', girl, I love you so
You might also like
Now I messed up
Give me one more chance
I know you had enough
It was never in the plans to hurt you
I never meant to do you wrong
But then this shorty came along
And yo, her vibe was strong, so I hit it
It was one too many times I admit it
If you can find it in your heart to forget it
Baby, just forgive me, love
You're the only one I want, the one I'm thinkin' of

Baby, you're all I want
Baby, you're all I need
Hold on tight 'til we get it right
Can't let go, we got to keep it tight
Baby, you're all I want
Baby, you're all I need
You're too close to joe just to let it go
You need to stop flippin', girl, I love you so

Time and time again I know I played myself
But I had my thoughts of losin' you, no, baby
You best believe I'm in love with you
All I need, no one else will do
Girl, it's true, I'm so in love with you, girl
Baby, you're all I want
Baby, you're all I need
Hold on tight 'til we get it right
Can't let go, we got to keep it tight
Baby, you're all I want
Baby, you're all I need
You're too close to joe just to let it go
You need to stop flippin', girl, I love you so
Baby, you're all I want
Baby, you're all I need
Hold on tight 'til we get it right
Can't let go, we got to keep it tight
Baby, you're all I want
Baby, you're all I need
You're too close to joe just to let it go
You need to stop flippin', girl, I love you so
(I love you, baby)

Ma, I hope you feel me
I know you love me and I love you, too
It's like the street game, I can't get out of you
And you can't get out of me, too
So let's just do the damn thing, you feel me?
