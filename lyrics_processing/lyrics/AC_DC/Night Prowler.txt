Somewhere a clock strikes midnight
And there's a full moon in the sky
You hear a dog bark in the distance
You hear someone's baby cry
A rat runs down the alley and a chill runs down your spine
And someone walks across your grave
And you wish the sun would shine
'Cause no one's going to warn you
And no one's going to yell, "Attack!"
And you don't feel the steel till it's hanging out your back

I'm your night prowler (night prowler, I sleep in the day)
I'm your night prowler (night prowler, get out of my way)
Yeah, I'm the night prowler (night prowler, watch out tonight)
Yes, I'm the night prowler, when you turn out the light


Too scared to turn your light out
'Cause there's something on your mind
Was that a noise outside the window?
What's that shadow on the blind?
As you lie there naked like a body in a tomb
Suspended animation as I slip into your room

I'm your night prowler (night prowler, break down your door)
I'm your night prowler (night prowler, crawlin' 'cross your floor)
I'm the night prowler (night prowler, make a mess of you)
Yes, I will, night prowler (night prowler)
And I'm tellin' this to you, there ain't nothin'
There ain't nothin', nothin' you can do
