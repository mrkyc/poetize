Holding someone else thinking it don't matter
She's flying around leaving me on the ground
And holdin' every one she can
She's startin' a holding pattern
And I'm sorry for the fool that tries to land her
She's always in flight and I'm wondering tonight
When she's gonna take off again
I'm doing my downtime due to bad weather
But I won't stay grounded for long
I'm gonna find somebody to treat me better
And start a holding pattern of my own
I'm up to here with departure and arrival time
I'm gonna start riding on a new airline
I'm tired of her flying those friendly skies
While I'm sitting here wondering why
She's startin' a holding pattern
Holding someone else thinking it don't matter
She's flying around leaving me on the ground
And holdin' every one she can
She's statin' a holding pattern
And I'm sorry for the fool that tries to land her
She's always in flight and I'm wondering tonight
When she's gonna take off again

She'll never straighten up and fly right
I should've known she was on a holding pattern
When I saw her hanger empty almost every night
I won't be the one to try and clip her wings
And make reservations on some wedding rings
She's excess baggage that I don't wanna claim
And I might as well forget her name
She's startin' a holding pattern
Holding someone else thinking it don't matter
She's flying around leaving me on the ground
And holdin' every one she can
She's statin' a holding pattern
And I'm sorry for the fool that tries to land her
She's always in flight and I'm wondering tonight
When she's gonna take off again
She's always in flight and I'm wondering tonight
