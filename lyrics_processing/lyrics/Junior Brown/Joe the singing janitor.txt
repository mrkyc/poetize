You might have seen a singing cowboy, too...
I'm Joe the singing janitor
I'm at a theater near you
I'll also be appearing at the concert you'll be hearing...
But I won't be singing with the band
I'm Joe the singing janitor
Cleanin' up for the folks; gettin' by the best I can
I'm in your school room, your pool room, your office, and your home...
And I'll always give you service with a smile
And most folks don't think that a janitor needs
A little kindness once in a while
Well I really don't care if you think I'm a square
From my hat down to my shoes
I'm Joe the singing janitor...
So go easy on a guy who's tryin' to make life easy on you!
Well the school kids like to have a laugh on me
With their spitballs and chewin' gum mess...
Making fun of my cornball singing voice
And the real square way I dress
Well I'm gonna sing a song in the principal's office
So they better respect an old man
I'm Joe the singing janitor...
Workin' hard for the kids; gettin' by the best I can!

I could show you all a thing or two
I ain't on the stage, just a dirty old floor...
And I got a lotta work to do
I can't carry a tune in a bucket...
But I carry that bucket with pride
I'm Joe the singing janitor...
I'm the man behind the mop; I make everything sparkle and shine!
I'm in your school room, your pool room, your office, and your home...
And I'll always give you service with a smile
And most folks don't think that a janitor needs
A little kindness once in a while
Well I really don't care if you think I'm a square
From my hat down to my shoes
I'm Joe the singing janitor...
