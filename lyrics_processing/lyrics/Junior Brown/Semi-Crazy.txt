I'm a slap happy, gear jamming coffee drinking, truck driving fool
I may have a little shimmy in this cracker box Jimmie
But I ain't never cracked up yet
The more I try to make a buck in this beat up truck
The more semi crazy I get
Yeah, I'm semi-crazy, I gotta be half nuts
To keep running up and down the road in these semi trucks
I might a had half a mind to slow it down for a time
But I'm never gonna give it up 'til I'm pushing up daisies
I'll be semi-crazy
I'm just a truck driving fool who never finished school
I got my learning at the old truck stop
They said I won't amount to much when a gear shift
And a clutch was the only education I got
I'm just an old blue collar, semi-crazy road scholar
They tell me that I'm half insane
And I've been driving so long, I got diesel in my blood
And ninety weight oil on my brain
'Cause I'm semi-crazy, yeah, 'bout half nuts
To keep running up and down the road in these semi trucks
I might a had half a mind to slow it down for a time
But I'm never gonna give it up 'til I'm pushing up daisies
I'll be semi-crazy
You might also likeEverybody says we're dingy 'cause we're too semi-crazy to stop
That's the handle that were stuck with, no matter if we like it or not
Through the desert and the mountains
The sunshine, the rain and the snow
We'll be double clutching daddies 'til we're over the hill
And we're never gonna take it slow
Yeah, I'm semi-crazy, I gotta be half nuts
To keep running up and down the road in these semi trucks
I might a had half a mind to slow it down for a time
But I'm never gonna give it up 'til I'm pushing up daisies
I'll be semi-crazy
'Til they put us in the ground
They'll never shut us down
Till we're six feet under
We'll be rolling thunder
Oh yeah, hey breaker one nine
Red, you out there?
You got Lenear Junior out here
Come on back
Hey Lenear, this is old Cornbread Red
How ya doing, boy?
Well, I'm a little semi-crazy
From drivin' this truck too long but I'll be alright
Ha, ha, ha, me too
