But your buddy's worse off and he throws you his car keys
Blue lights are blinking, four o'clock in the morn'
State trooper makes you wish that you'd never been born
Better call Saul, better call Saul
You wanna tell the world you're in love with a girl named Fran
So you find an overpass and say it with a spray paint can
Blue lights start a-blinking, those handcuffs click
You know who to call and you better call quick

Saul, Saul, you better call Saul
He'll fight for your rights when your back's to the wall
Stick it to the man, justice for all
You better call Saul
Shopping at the Walmart, short just a couple of beans
There's a George Foreman grill down the back of your blue jeans
They caught you at the checkout, the blue lights blink
Only one got a call 'cause the others all stink
Better call Saul, better call Saul (Better call Saul)
Your husband disappeared in a most convenient way
Now your troubles are gone, his insurance will surely pay
You get to the bank but the cops say, "Whoa!"
Who you gonna dial when they lock you down low?
You might also like
Saul, Saul, you better call Saul
He'll fight for your rights when your back's to the wall
Stick it to the man, justice for all
You heard me, you better call Saul
Your customers are gone and your store is on the rocks
Spread around the gas 'cause it's time to torch the stock
But you gotta move quick before you singe your own hair
Who knew there was a homeless guy sleeping in there?
Better call Saul, better call Saul (Better call Saul)
FBI finds kids trapped in your creepy van
You stay real cool and tell them you're the ice cream man
But all that crying just gave you away
Who you gonna call to skip a prison stay?

Saul, Saul, you better call Saul
He'll fight for your rights when your back's to the wall
Stick it to the man, justice for all
You better call Saul
