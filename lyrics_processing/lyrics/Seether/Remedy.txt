Throw your dollar bills and leave your thrills all here with me
And speak, but don't pretend I won't defend you anymore, you see
It aches in every bone
I'll die alone, but not for you
My eyes don't need to see that ugly thing
I know it's me, you fear

If you want me, hold me back

Frail, the skin is dry and pale
The pain will never fail
And so we go back to the remedy
Clip the wings that get you high
Just leave 'em where they lie
And tell yourself you'll be the death of me

I don't need a friend, I need to mend so far away
So come, sit by the fire and play a while
But you can't stay too long
It aches in every bone
I'll die alone, but not for pleasure
I see my heart explode
It's been eroded by the weather here

Frail, the skin is dry and pale, the pain will never fail
And so we go back to the remedy
Clip the wings that get you high, just leave 'em where they lie
And tell yourself you'll be the death of me
Frail, the skin is dry and pale, the pain will never fail
And so we go back to the remedy
Clip the wings that get you high, just leave 'em where they lie
And tell yourself you'll be the death of me

Hold your eyes closed, take me in
Hold your eyes closed, take me in

Frail, the skin is dry and pale, the pain will never fail
And so we go back to the remedy
Clip the wings that get you high, just leave 'em where they lie

And so we go back to the remedy
Clip the wings that get you high, just leave 'em where they lie
