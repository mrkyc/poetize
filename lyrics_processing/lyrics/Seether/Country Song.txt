Well, I can't stand to look at you now
This revelation's out of my hands
Still, I can't bear the thought of you now
This complication's leaving me scared
Stay when you think you want me
Pray when you need advice
Hey, keep your sickness off me
Tryin' to get through
Blame all your weakness on me
Shame that I'm so contrite
Hey keep your fingers off me
Why can't I get through?

You think you have the best of intentions
I cannot shake the taste of blood in my mouth

(Hey) I keep on thinking that it's
(Hey) All done and all over now
You keep on thinking you can save me, save me
(Hey) My ship is sinking but it's
(Hey) All good and I can't go down
You got me thinking that the party's all over
See Seether LiveGet tickets as low as $46You might also like
Well, I can't stand to be with myself
This liberation's seemingly rare
And I can't stand the taste of your mouth
This sublimation's outta my hands
You stay cause you think you want me
Pray when you need advice
Hey, keep your sickness off me
(I'm tryin' to get through)
Shame you could take this from me
Bane on an empty mind
Hey, keep your fingers off me
Why can't I get through?

(Hey) I keep on thinking that it's
(Hey) All done and all over now
You keep on thinking you can save me, save me
(Hey) My ship is sinking but it's
(Hey) All good and I can't go down
You got me thinking that the party's all over

Lay down, just stay down
Lay down because I'm trying to get through
Say what you want, but you're not gonna win this time
Take what you want, but just leave me alive
Say what you want, but you're not gonna win this time
Take what you want, but just leave me alive

(Hey) I keep on thinkin' that it's
(Hey) All done and all over now
You keep on thinking you can save me, save me
(Hey) My ship is sinking but it's
(Hey) All good and I can't go down
Still you believe that we can start it all over

Lay down, just stay down
Lay down because the party's all over
Lay down, just stay down
