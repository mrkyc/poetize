Can you tell me a story
Without any words?
Then mold me misshapen
From the soaking dirt
Keep feeding me courage
That I don't deserve
So I don't feel broken
Like I have no worth

My apathy's growing
And I never learn
I'm spending this token
So I don't get burned

And it seems like
I'm never gonna make this
Feel right
I'm drowning in a wave of
Insight
I'll never be the one to
Breathe a sigh
But I'll survive

Even though the sun has
Gone down
Negative emotions
Inbound
I'll never be the one to
Make a sound
But I'll survive

Can you whittle me a token
Of strength and rebirth?
Can you wrap it in linen
And a stolen curse?
Take strength from the knowledge
That this always hurts
Now keep your eyes open
So it won't get worse

My apathy's growing
And I never learn
I'm spending this token
So I don't get burned

And it seems like
I'm never gonna make this
Feel right
I'm drowning in a wave of
Insight
I'll never be the one to
Breathe a sigh
But I'll survive

I can't make you feel alive
(And you know I don't regret it)
