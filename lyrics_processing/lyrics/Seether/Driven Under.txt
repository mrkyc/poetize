When I'm lying next to you?
Do you think that I am blind
There's nothing left for me to lose?
Must be something on your mind
Something lost and left behind
Do you know I'm faking now?

Do you know I'm faking
When I'm lying next to you?

To everything you ever do?
Must be something on your mind
Something lost for me to find
Do you know I'm faking?

When I tell you I love you
I guess you know that I am blind
To everything you say and do
Must be something on my mind
There's nothing left for me to hide
Do you know I'm faking?
