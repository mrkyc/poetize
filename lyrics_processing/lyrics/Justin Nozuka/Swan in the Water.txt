In the spirit of God, leave me alone
My mother tried to heal me, she said just feel me
Just feel me then leave me alone
My brother tried to scold me, he tried to hold me
To mold me then leave me alone
My sister tried to listen, but she couldn't understand
It's not how I stand but where I stand
And you talk and you talk and you talk
And then you walk
And you get what you wanted all along
And then you walk
And then you walk, oil in the water
How come you can't be with me?
Oil in the fire, I remember how it used to be
Swan in the water, you're moving so elegantly
And it burns and it burns and it burns
And it burns and it burns
I know World War III tried to convince me, you were shouting
On the radio and TV screen, leave me alone
My angels tried to mess me, constantly test me
And test me and now leave me alone
You might also likeThe devil tried to bless me, confessing the death
And then leave me alone
My sister tried to listen, but she couldn't understand
It's not how I stand, but where I stand
And you talk and you talk and you talk
And then you walk
And you get what you wanted all along
And then you walk
And then you walk, oil in the water
How come you can't be with me?
Oil in the fire, I remember how it used to be
Swan in the water, you're moving so elegantly
And it burns and it burns and it burns
This world is trying to break me
It's trying to break me
This world is trying to break me
It's trying to break me
The world is trying to break me
It's trying to break me
The world is trying to break me
Trying to break me
This world is trying to break me
It's trying to break me
This world is trying to break me
Ooh, it's trying to break me
