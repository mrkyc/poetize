She loves him more, he loves her more
Seems like they won't ever let each other go
Laughing and kissing, it's a match made in heaven
Behind the rings on their fingers
Imprints the ink deep in the inner
That has stained their souls together now
Stained soul mates forever now
Seems like they've made it to the other side
Where the grass is greener and the sky is always blue
And it goes on forever and ever but there is only room for two
Deep at night I'm awakened from my dreams
Next door, yelling cries mercy, she is begging please
"Don't end my life you're all I need
And darling, I will never leave, I'll never leave"
And then she prayed on her knees, she said

Save him, save him from the hand he that beats me on
Save him, save him from the hand he that beats me on
Save him, save him from the hand he that beats me on
Save him, save him from the hand he that beats me on

Dark clouds cover her paradise
She covers her eyes and hides behind enemy lines
And she walks through the night with her child in her arms
She's thrown back, hostage'd
See, twenty years ago when she was just ten years old
Lost in imagination, she was left alone
And pops had nothing to let his anger on
Oh, he beat her cold, yes he did, he beat her cold
She used to pray on her knees, she said
You might also like
Save him, save him from the hand he that beats me on
Save him, save him from the hand he that beats me on
Save him, save him from the hand he that beats me on
Save him, save him from the hand he that beats me on

Deep at night, I'm awakened from my dreams
Next door, yelling cries mercy
She's begging please, and begging please, and begging please
"Get up, get up", he brings her to her feet
And smacks her down 'til she falls to the ground
Oh, and over and over again
He brings her to her feet 'til she can no longer stand
Oh, and still, the beating never ends
Oh, on and on and on it goes
Until he brings out a gun
And says to her, "stop crying and bring me my son"
She cries harder and harder, he cries harder and harder
She says, "baby, please don't-don't do this"
Two shots to her chest
And a blow to his own head
She quickly loses breath and blood rushes to their bed
And baby cries, he cries his eyes out, yeah

Save him, save him from the hand he that beats me on
Save him, save him from the hand he that beats me on
Save him, save him from the hand he that beats me on
Save him, save him from the hand he that beats me on
She loves him more, he loves her more
Seems like they won't ever let each other go
