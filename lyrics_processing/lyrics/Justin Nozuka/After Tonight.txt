There's something in your eyes
Is everything alright?
You look up to the sky, you long for something more
Darlin'
Give me your right hand
I think I understand
Follow me and you will never have to wish again

I know that after tonight
You don't have to look up at the stars, no, no, no, no
I know by the end of tonight
You don't have to look up at the stars
And I know if the love is alright
You don't have to look up at the stars, no, no, no, no
I know by the end of tonight
You don't have to look up at the stars
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

Tell me how you feel
And if I'm getting near
I'll tell you where to steer, you tell me where to steer
D-d-d-darlin'
Way above the clouds
And high above the stars
Through the unknown black holes, no one knows where we are
But we'll return to earth and do it all over again

Come away with me
Come fly away with me
Just for one night, no one will ever know, no, no, no
Darlin'
I will leave you satisfied
Forever past time
You don't have to hide, you're free to fly

I know that after tonight
You don't have to look up at the stars, no, no, no, no
I know by the end of tonight
You don't have to look up at the stars

Said I, I know that after tonight
You don't have to look up at the stars, no, no, no, no

And I know if the love is alright
You don't have to look up at the stars, no, no, no, no
I know by the end of tonight
We're looking down upon them from heaven
Yeah, yeah
Oh, no, no
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no
Yeah, hey
