From across the doorstep
A shadow that moves
Bright rhythms towards you
Oh how would I do
In your ribbons of virtue
I'm waiting for the time
When you wave
The sun is falling
The sky a darker blue
A heavy weight
I can't fight
To want to fall
It takes a hold of me
A rise of lines in my mind
Upon they grew
A dream to lie
Too bare with you
I want to lie to the edge with you
I want to run down your arm
While you lie there
Warm under the light
Deeper in the height
With this lilac wine
You might also likeI could just scream
At the top of my lungs
Falling asleep
With your leg on my stomach
Warm under the light
Deeper in the height
When I'm with you
A starling that flew
It dips and it rises
To sit by your room
It sees what no one do
Oh how would I hold
In your ribbons of virtue
With nothing to hold to
Still waiting for the time
When you wave
The sun is falling
The sky still darker blue
A heavy weight I can't fight
To want to fall
It takes a hold of me
A rise of lines
How I admire you
I dream to lie
Too bare with you
I want to lie to the edge with you
I want to run down your arm
While you lie there
Warm under the light
Deeper in the height
With this lilac wine
I could just scream
At the top of my lungs
Falling asleep
With your leg on my stomach
Warm under the light
Deeper in the height
When I'm with you
Hadn't I known
The way that it'd grow
A moment in time
To ride like that
So heavy it flows
Deep in my mind
