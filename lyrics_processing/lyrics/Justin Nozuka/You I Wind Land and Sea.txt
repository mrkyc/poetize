Get up out your head
The sun will soon be rising
And the light's no longer red
We walk the street
We ain't got time to play
No, no, no, no
Standing for our reasons
Our time has come at last
To bring it down to bottom
And let the wind show us the path
This time we can see
We ain't got time to play
No, no, no, no
Rising comes the moon and the sun
I'll be alright for now, I'll be alright for now
A thousand buffalo on the run
Stand up and fight for now, stand up and fight for now
Over any distance
The sun will disappear
And darkness with its powers
Taking over anything that fears
You might also likeYou plant that seed
The light is on the way
Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Not for another moment
We must not divide
Harmony is what we need
Between both you and I
Wind, land and sea
The light is on the way
Yeah, yeah
Rising comes the moon and the sun
I'll be alright for now, I'll be alright for now
A thousand buffalo on the run
Stand up and fight for now, stand up and fight for now
Hold my hand, I know you're the one
Stand up and fight for now, stand up and fight for now
Cause what we see holding, that's how it should be, yeah
Rising comes the moon and the sun
I'll be alright for now, I'll be alright for now
Ten thousand buffalo on the run
Stand up and fight for now, stand up and fight for now
Hold my hand I know you're the one
Stand up and fight for now, stand up and fight for now
The rising of our generation
Stand up and fight for now, stand up and fight for now
Fight for now, fight for now
