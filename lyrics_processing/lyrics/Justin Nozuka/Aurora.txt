A sky full of ribbons in the night
Giving me rest
Under the old pine
How did we do it
With so many days
So many nights
We're on the move
A journey to west tides
Miles mean nothing
From the place we left last year
Where the hours cost
Here in our tent
Under Aurora
We're keeping warm
Until the morning comes
I'll lie here while it rains
Upon the soft green moss
I get the feeling that for once I know the meaning
I get the feeling that for once I know the meaning
Head in the water
I see them swim around my feet
Tell me my friend
Do you see the mountains
You might also likeMiles mean nothing
From the place we left last year
Where the hours cost
Here in our tent
Under Aurora
We're keeping warm
Until the morning comes
I'll lie here while it rains
Upon the soft green moss
I get the feeling that for once I know the meaning
I get the feeling that for once I know the meaning
Before we left
My papa told me son
I get the weight of it, I get the weight of it
And momma came
With her kisses and hugs
She said
We'll be waiting here
Yellow moon
Guide the way
Through the woods
And over hills
Take us to where we're going
We're on our way
The trees a sway
Upon the Earth
Take us to where we're going
Aurora glow
With us below
The stars above
Take us to were we're going
Take us to where we're going
Miles mean nothing
From the place we left last year
Where the hours cost
Here in our tent
Under Aurora
We're keeping warm
Until the morning comes
I'll lie here while it rains
Upon the soft green moss
I get the feeling that for once I know the meaning
