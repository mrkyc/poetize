When did you unfold, slowly turn cold
And finalize your soul?
Well, I will not be the one to tell your momma
That her son has gone
From and out the moment we locked eyes
I knew that this was wrong
Well, I will not be the one to let you slip
And watch you turn to stone

I carried you, carried you
Carried down to the ground
Down to the ground, down to the ground
I carried you
Mercy, mercy, mercy
Mercy, mercy, mercy, mercy
Mercy, mercy, mercy
Mercy, mercy, mercy, mercy

I sent a prayer to hold this colored tone
I knew had touched your soul
Well, how can I be the one to bring you the sun
When I freed you of your bones?
Oh no, I will not let you go
Well, I shall take my hand unto my heart
And leave this broken road
Everything I'll give to you
So we can dance the war, I'll let you lead
But let me take control
I sat down
You might also like
I carried you, carried you
Carried down to the ground
Down to the ground, down to the ground
I carried you
Mercy, mercy, mercy
Mercy, mercy, mercy, mercy
Mercy, mercy, mercy
Mercy, mercy, mercy, mercy

If there was just one way
For you to trust me
We could all three
Together forever, that's great
Just touch

Heaven is only three blocks
Heaven is only three blocks
Heaven is only three blocks away
Heaven is only three blocks away
Heaven is only three blocks
Heaven is only three blocks
Heaven is only three blocks
Heaven is only three blocks
I carried you, carried you
Carried down to the ground
Down to the ground, down to the ground
I carried you
Mercy, mercy, mercy
Mercy, mercy, mercy, mercy
Mercy, mercy, mercy
Mercy, mercy, mercy, mercy

Heaven is only three blocks
Heaven is only three blocks
