Calling out to thee
Whether the eyes find a way
To watch out over
Early on this side
Alone with just the air
Only the common tern
Was truly aware
Followed by a softer fade
A thunder cloud provided shade
The roar and its daring parade
The way that it holds
Until it slows
The wonder in the air
Eva's in the womb
Obachan's in the tomb
Wade in the water
Till I drifted down
Over these old walls
And into mothers hands
I was a boy
Now I suppose I'm a man
You might also likeI fit in an auburn mane
Comfort in the heavy rain
Ready to take the blame
The rises to ruins
The loveliest noons
The wonders in the air
Run to waters
It's all I need
Under the mother wave
Where I can hide away
Run to waters
It's all in me
Where I can hide away
When I need to escape
Earth and roam to run
Free under the sun
I dream to hold
The emerald I saw in the sea
Would I let it be
Or take it back with me
Every move
Does it really change o
Our whole destiny
Moving I see it's old
The opening
And then the fold
I guess even if it breaks
The hot or the cold
The water still holds
The wonders in the air
Run to waters
All I need
And under the mother wave
Where I can hide away
Run to waters
It's all in me
Where I can hide away
When I need to escape
Lines and wolves
Binds and rules
Leading fools
Lies
Lines and wolves
Binds and rules
Leading fools
Lies
Run to waters
It's all I need
Under the mother wave
Where I can hide away
Run, run, run, run to waters
It's all in me
Where I can hide away
When I need to escape
Run, run, run, run to waters
It's all I need
Under the mother wave
