Well I'm alone
And you're well gone and I can't fight it
You said goodbye
And I asked why and started crying
I can't sleep and I can't write
And I can't fight it

But you always said 'if a wave came by
Then we would ride it'
Yeah
Well I'm sinking baby and I'm drowning alone
Slowly slipping away from all of my life goals
Oh

Well Jenny, Oh Jenny
Have you seen my soul
I think it fell inside your suitcase
When you left me alone
Well Jenny, Oh Jenny, have you seen my soul
Without it I ain't, ain't got no soul
Ain't got no soul
I'm the soulless man
I'm the soulless man
I'm the soulless man
I'm the soulless man

Baby I just wanna ask you how you did it
Broke my heart, stole my watch, and all my money
Did you mean what you said when we were cuddling
Do you still look up at the moon
Like you said you would
At 3:02 in the morning'

Well Jenny, Oh Jenny, have you seen my soul
I think it fell inside your suitcase
When you left me alone
Well Jenny, Oh Jenny, have you seen my soul
Without it I ain't, ain't got no soul
Ain't got no soul
I'm the soulless man
I'm the soulless man
I'm the soulless man
I'm the soulless man

Pick up your phone, pick up your phone
Oh yeah baby
Pick up your phone, pick up your phone
I just wanna hear your voice one more time
Hey hey hey
Well Jenny, Oh Jenny, have you seen my soul
I think it fell inside your suitcase
When you left me alone
Well Jenny, Oh Jenny, have you seen my soul
Without it I ain't, ain't got no soul
Ain't got no soul
I'm the soulless man
I'm the soulless man
I'm the soulless man
