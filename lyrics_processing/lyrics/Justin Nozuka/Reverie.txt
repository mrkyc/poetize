Take me up to the open mind
It's hard to be
With the weight on my mind
Silent pace
Help me see
On I stare
Take it on
And it had me gone
I'm in the air
Over hills
Reverie
Heavier on the upside
I saw it climb
And watched it fall
When I'm here with you
Old tree's standing tall
I'm there
I'm leaving the times
From your well
From the wild
Saw it rise to the sky
And then it fell
I get caught
I get caught in the light of your spell
Let it roam
On I see
Reverie
You might also likeMines and scars
Take me up to the open mind
It's hard to be
With the weight on my mind
I get stuck
Travesty
Cut my hair
Had to lose and I didn't care
I couldn't bear
No I could not bear
Lost some sleep
But all day dream
Heavier on the upside
We make the climb
And then we fall
Water be the root
And the cause of it all
I'm there
I'm leaving the times
From your well
From the wild
Saw it rise to the sky
And then it fell
I get caught
I get caught in the light of your spell
Let it roam
On I see
Reverie
Take me there
Out of the room and in the air
I'd seen a path
From birth and into ash
A wishing tree
High as the eye can see
Rising ever constantly
Walk alone
I feel the feather on my feet
All around
The falling earth was silent
I saw her run
And then I saw her take off
How much further could I carry on
(How much further could I carry on)
I could get lost inside a song
When I am there
I'm not here at all
I'm there
I'm leaving the times
From your well
From the wild
Saw it rise to the sky
And then it fell
I get caught
I get caught in the light of your spell
Let it roam
On I see
