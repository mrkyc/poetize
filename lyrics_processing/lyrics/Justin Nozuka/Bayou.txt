Hear her sing and light
And making forward
From the water ways
And all's just waking up
I break
For it to lighten up these worries
Lighten up these walls
To feel the depth too
Feel my body open now and clear
Feel my body moving
To the pulse of the outer wake
I knew I had to get through
I've been in the carbon lines and haze
Where everybody's off
When they're on their way
I just want to get through
I find
Open up the hours
And the whole thing starts to follow
It won't hollow me today
You might also likeI wait for it
To lighten up be honest
Bring me straight deep down
No telling me to
Looking at the open skies and truths
Where everybody's under the sun
It's the only way
Honest eyes come through my friend
Signs are in the air I drew
Feel my body moving to the pulse
Of the outer wake
I can really feel it coming through
Bayou and the beating drum
Bayou
Bayou and the beating drum
Bayou
Did you hear the old one hum
Underneath the evening sun
Bayou and the beating in the drum
Bayou
I praise
I get in and all I hear's the honest call
The resonance
The sounds so deep and tame
A wait for it
To lighten up be honest
Bring it straight deep down
And feel the depth too
Feel the body singing loud and clear
Feel the body rolling to the pulse
That's been underway
The waves are coming you way
And on the water
Drifting proud
Serene
I tell you I belong to be out
And go all the way
When I fall
It's the land that makes me tall
I could run to my hearts call
I feel heavier from it all
I can hear the ancient sounds of...
Bayou and the beating drum
Bayou
Bayou and the beating drum
Bayou
Did you hear the old one hum
Underneath the evening sun
Bayou and the beating in the drum
