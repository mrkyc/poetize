Sunny afternoon, I was chattin' to her
She didn't really care about the bigger tings
'Cause the smaller tings in life are what really matters to her
Took her number, couldn't wait to make it back to her
Baby girl, would you come on this cruise with me?
You make me laugh, every day you're amusing me
I kinda know when I bump into a wifey
I gotta think about keeping her beside me
Strolling through the park, everyting fresh (yeah)
High street flexing, the cards are on deck (yeah)
Label can't get at me 'cause I don't want a check (yeah)
And she's looking like the flyest girl I've ever met (oh, oh, yeah)
Spending time with her, standard
And of course, I wanna show her off, standard
We both working every day 'round the clock
She hit the spa and go and get herself pampered

She talking like she wanna be my lover
She talking 'bout us living with each other
Try a ting instead of running for cover
But I've seen it causing headache to my bruddas
New job alert, now the industry is calling
Communication is falling
And we're not talking, talking no more
Talking, talking no more

Swear that you are cer-certified, yeah

We ain't really spoken in a couple weeks
I ain't even seen you do a couple tweets
Must be doing you, and I'm cool with that
Might give you a hello if you call me back
But I should keep it moving, I'm growing with it
I'm gonna wait until you call me and roll with it
You can tell me if your head is in a mess
We ain't gotta worry, girl, life is a test

You are cer-certified, yeah
