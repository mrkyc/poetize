Fire in my belly 'cause I'm back in the manor
I've spent my whole life there stacked in the manor
Yo, I've done a lot of tracks in the manor
E3, you can get the loud pack in the manor
I know gyal who are good and live normal
But I know gyal who are bad like Rihanna
Anybody wanna know what I'm doin' right now
Go tell 'em that I'm back with a banger (Preditah)

Yo, yo, liquid flow
I fire like a MAC, it's not a biscuit flow
E3 but I kill 'em with the Chrisp Street flow
DJs, spin the riddim, better mix me, though
Too clued-up, how you gonna trick me, bro?
Buy a lump, I don't wanna tick three Os
Got the KFC, man have got the Dixy flow
They never break, you've never gotta fix these flows
I'm a K-I-N-G, the liquid flows
With the cracks in the concrete, I'm in them, bro
Yellow like a Simpson though, Bart Simpson flow
You know I've got that instant flow
Hello, hello, hi, liquid pro
See me in the club, killin' off a liquid show
First measure, I tell my don pick these shows
'Cause I wanna be in the club drinkin', bro

Thinkin' cap on
My flow's what it's like when you turn the tap on
You ever see me often you're gonna see me back on
See me with white, might see me with black on
Ayy, man got the army Nike track on
I ain't gonna bother nobody, I just crack on
Stack up, stack up, stack up, stack on
It's my riddim the DJ wanna slap on
Step up, step in, watch everybody step out
I'm back on the Dizzee like when a man first set out
If you ain't goin' for the jugular then brudda, get out
Land and I do what I gotta do, then I jet out
Jet out, man, get out, the jets ain't private
I'll be in the aisle seats sittin' in silence
Spit bars and the crowd go wild
When I look into the dance floor, it looks like violence
Fire in my belly 'cause I'm back in the manor
I've spent my whole life there stacked in the manor
Yo, I've done a lot of tracks in the manor
E3, you can get the loud pack in the manor
I know gyal who are good and live normal
But I know gyal who are bad like Rihanna
Anybody wanna know what I'm doin' right now
Go tell 'em that I'm back with a banger

Backstage chillin' in the dance with my dargs dem
None of them are fake, you can ask them
People who are lookin' a hype, I walk past 'em
Dons could be richer or poor, I won't class 'em
Dons could be ready for war, my bars spark 'em
My sound travels the seas, that's why I part 'em
I can be foul, poisonous dart them
But the gyal dem wanna hype if I (uh)
It's been a good year, couple wars, couple sick tunes
But now I've got a deal with a couple quick few
I will clash MCs, I will clash crews
You will know if you wanna try, the choice you choose
I will roll up on my ones and bring twos
In the war, I don't get confused
You just get defused, nobody can't snooze
I ain't really got any points I wanna prove
But I gotta make a move
Fire in my belly 'cause I'm back in the manor
I've spent my whole life there stacked in the manor
Yo, I've done a lot of tracks in the manor
E3, you can get the loud pack in the manor
I know gyal who are good and live normal
But I know gyal who are bad like Rihanna
Anybody wanna know what I'm doin' right now
Go tell 'em that I'm back with a banger
Fire in my belly 'cause I'm back in the manor
I've spent my whole life there stacked in the manor
Yo, I've done a lot of tracks in the manor
E3, you can get the loud pack in the manor
I know gyal who are good and live normal
But I know gyal who are bad like Rihanna
Anybody wanna know what I'm doin' right now
Go tell 'em that I'm back with a banger

Boy Better Know
I've got the badboy flow
Yo
