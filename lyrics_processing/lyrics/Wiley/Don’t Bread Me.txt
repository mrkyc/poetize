I'm not gonna lie
All them "you weren't there" likkle cheap shots
It's like, come on man, that's not no kinda level

You know in this life it's not fair
So how you gonna talk about I weren't there
When the feds had you in Australia
I didn't act like a fool, I knew you was there
So you can't be a don if I'm not there
You likkle eediat
Get Dizzee, come 'round 'ere
This style none of you run around 'ere
I been livin', I been dying for my sons 'round 'ere
I come to your house, you've never come to my house
Bumbahole looking for the clout
Deep down in your heart you're not an MC
I look around, I see your real gauge empty
Try to drop man out on the sly
And then you come back start looking for a bligh
Haha, no bligh
Me and you are done, no lie
About god forgive you if you bust your nine
But wait-
You ain't gonna bust no nine
If Dan never made German Whip
You'd be right back there at the back of the line
And you ain't above clouds, you're the basic grime
I do shut up and fuckery and facey grime
I gave this brudda life, he ain't taking mine
I know two girls now
They're the reason why you're even out here now doing famous grime
Bumbahole stay there, I won't waste your time
Just me being real, it's not a hatred fam
You made Jme stop, that's paigon time
You made Jme stop
For you bro
I can never stop, 'cause I've gotta drop
You was never a top shotta, the cream of the crop
You was never on road like that
You gotta stop with all this
Clout-chasing, that's what we call this
That's Not Me gassed you up for all this
You're a real snake, that's what we call it
I thought about it, there's nuttin' else to call it
Tryna be my friend but I overrule it
'Cause you lost your way back, you need schooling
Bare yes man around you, that's boring
You're fame-whoring
I run up on any stage, one up
Your stage, one up
Anytime I step to you, I step one up
So you can't step on mic and run gum up
You man ain't like me, you can't one up
I'm a king of one up
Think about that tonight, till the mornin' when the sun come up
You said that Bob Marley copy fella
Could see them kinda talks I bun up
'Dem talks I bun up
I rock up on your next stage show, I come one up
'Cause I'm a rave done-er
I'm one up
You know me when I start help you out
Then your whole life tun up
Remember when Wiley told you to pick up the mic?
Good, I hope you never forget
Look into my face, you was never the best
I trip you over, I put my foot on your neck
I'm a junior, and you're a junior
You bring it to me, I bring it to yah
And manna heavyweight, looking like a cruiser
I might catch you on the chin like Bruza
Stand up and think of a plate, and run through ya
I'm the bo, and the booyah
You can bring Jaykae along to protect the greatness
I'm still gonna rise and do ya
Mascot's news to me
In my face, they can never say "boo" to me
It's not news to me
And how you gonna say that I'm ungrateful
When you was the one that was using me?
But I'm a street don, so I had the clue to see
Never ever put a limit on who you could be
So go and be who you wanna be
Don't try chattin' to me about envy or jealousy
'Cause that ain't me
I said, Wiley chill, his attack ain't peak
Cah man are followers, like that ain't sheep
Took a cheap shot like, that ain't weak
I guess you just wanna sing-a-long track of the week
And I was sitting down, now I'm back on my feet
I got a likkle few bars now I'm back on the beat
I'm Chiraq on the beat, I'm hard crack on the beat
I'm like, you wanna bread but no can do
I don't wanna squash any beef with you
Man are robots, and I programmed you
Pretending you like each other it's not true
'Cause you don't like me, and I don't like you
Man get rich and switch, end the crew
And I caught on like I was meant to do
And that whole rich and switch, that's for you
Yo, you can't G shock man
'Cause you man are some cheap shot man
Rocksteady and Bebop man
Round saucer, you man are teapot man
Blam, you fouled me as I was going to the basket
Now I got three shots fam
Look around, then I look to the basket
