Anything here is earned and worked for
And it's G2, what you think I murked for?
I've reached every checkpoint that I searched for
I'm older, of course I learnt more
The Earth warrior, I've been hurt more
Yeah, yeah, I roll in the dirt more
When it was beef bro, I went to the Earth's core
I ain't gotta say much, I work more

Gotta get ready for the set, make sure I'm cold
I was on the set with the wickedest rhymes and flows
Not just any MC is keepin' up with these pros
Anytime you hear my voice, that's Wiley from Bow
It's been a while but I'm still wild
Wilehouse boy, Eskimo style
E14, back to E3
You're gonna see me with the rest of my Gs

My bars are loners, nobody wants to roll with 'em
Started amateur, now I've gone pro with 'em
Look at all the energy I've given
Still feel like a car that's been made but it's never been driven
Sick riddims for days, I still bill 'em
If a spitter's puttin' me to the test, I still spin 'em
In tracksuits or denims, I possess the venom
You wanna buy the vibe to bring, but here the shops don't sell 'em

Gotta get ready for the set, make sure I'm cold

Tell them this ain't your normal MC in the booth
It's a animal, cool and deadly in the booth
Gotta be a badman riddim from the start
That's even gonna get me to step in the booth
You know, we've got the sound they call grime
I know this, brother, I'm the greatest of all time
Replay the goals, I've scored at full-time
All that work and now it's award time, yeah

Gotta get ready for the set, make sure I'm cold
