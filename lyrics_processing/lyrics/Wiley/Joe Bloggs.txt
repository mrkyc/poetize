Gotta bill a pension now so when I'm older
I can live when I can't get jobs
When I make a song, I ain't lookin' for a nod
'Cause manaman are old school like Joe Bloggs

Man can't say how war wicked I was
Man are old school like the Wizard of Oz
Man are old school like Bucky O'Hare
Man will pull out the ting and Bucky O'Hare
Man are old school, 2Pac had hair
Man are old school, 2Pac was here

And the smoke with them old school rusters
(Oi, remember when) Sharon Stone opened a leg
Man are old school like Bill and Ted

Cuddlin' up with SuperTed
That's never been a super bread

Blazin', blazin', but I ain't callin' squads
Key to the block but I ain't holdin' fobs
Took advice from my uncle but it ain't Bob's
Started the shop in the town
Back to the city of gods, wow
Never been after a head shake
Gave him a chance, call it a dead take
'Nuff of dem are spring feet, thousand missions
Not one of 'em complete
I was the whole grain without the wheat
So old school, I still purchase without receipt
Call me a president without the suite
Old school, old school, I don't give a monkey's
If I'm off-beat
Call shots, go against odds

Yo, I come through with the peng
Cuh man are shit, draw only the peng
When I was a kid, I went so many house raves
Somebody always came through with the leng
Could've been a rebore that fired couple duds
Still, everybody in the place gonna run
Still, everybody in the place gonna dust
They don't wanna fight, no, they don't wanna fuss
I had a wild upbringin', I was never stable
But I had manners at the dinner table
Stand out when I've gotta stand up tall
I've got a chair at the winners' table, like
Say my name when givin' out awards
My life's crazy, I never get bored
Can't lie, blud, manaman's toured
On top of that, yeah, manaman's warred

Call shots, go against odds
Can't go fishin' if you ain't got rods
