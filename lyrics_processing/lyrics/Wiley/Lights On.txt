Even though you don't know
Even though you don't know
Even though you don't know my name
Me and you bleed exactly the same
I smile and come across I'll tame
A hundred volts take your life ain't no game
I switch them lights on
Hey DJ turn them lights on

She got her light switched on
My light's switched on
She looking in my eyes like 'I like this don'
I wanna know what side she's from
I seen many girls but I like this one
Told me she was a west side lady
Had a few friends but they were all shady
Now she on a solo ting
So nobody can't send her crazy
Too many friends, and not enough true friends
Made her wanna go and move to new ends
I care though, cause even if my life gets lonely
It's all good, to keep few friends

We connected I asked her out and she accepted
I think she gets it
When the end of the night comes
Me and her leave through the exit
You might also like
Even though you don't know my name
Me and you bleed exactly the same
I smile and come across all tame
A hundred volts take your life ain't no game
I switch them lights on
(When the end of the nights comes)
Hey DJ, turn them lights on
(I like this one)

Anywhere we go, we bound to have fun
You take care of me we gettin' the job done
She keeps my mind calm, getting alot done
I know it's all new but it feels so long
On first sight I wanted to be acquainted
People gonna see us out clocking that we dated
And we don't know where we even wanna take it
But we got it good bond I don't wanna break it

We connected
I asked her out and she accepted
I think she gets it
When the end of the nights comes
Me and her leave through the exit
Even though you don't know my name
Me and you bleed exactly the same
I smile and come across all tame
A hundred volts take your life ain't no game
I switch them lights on

Hey DJ, turn them lights on

Turn the lights on, Beyonce
Well, you're not quite there, but I must say
I like them pushing off face
Young black and a tax and that rip cage
That sexy dress the only part that's revealing yes
That's why I'm respecting her
Rejecting them and selecting her, Strydes

Anywhere we go we're bound to have fun
You take care of me, we gettin' the job done

I switch them lights on
Hey DJ turn them lights on
When the end of the nights comes
