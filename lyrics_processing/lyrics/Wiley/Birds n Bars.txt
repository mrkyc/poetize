Yo, Eskiboy
BBK, dun know
Listen

Yo, biggin' up Teeza, man done a remix
Then I came through with the bars on point 'cause I'm a realist
Can't go against my scene even if you're the realest
I based my career on provin' myself to non-believers
My name's gonna ring bells to newspaper readers
Wiley, Wiley, yeah, that's one of the achievers
Most of my gyal dem are cool but some of them are divas
You win some, lose some, then you've gotta go take a breather
Man get weak off a gyal like Julius Caesar
I nearly killed myself on the highway, just before you reach peeler
Blud, I was lean already but now I wanna go home and get leaner
I should've went sleep, or I should've toured but I never done either
Can't keep your mouth shut, that girl 
I'm old school, yes, Avia and FILA
Smokin' a J, listenin' to Mila
I clean my own house, I don't want a cleaner
I run the dance like 
Reel up, hail up my dons
Always bringin' stars to the spotlight
I know what I'm like and I know what I'm not like
We move forward, do it like clockwise
I used to be one of my stand up on the block guys
Now I'm a OG, kush
Do it on my own, I won't need a push
Biggin' up Dynamite and I'm biggin' up Stush
I'm like Nike, I do it, I come through with a swoosh
Believe and achieve
Awards on the mantlepiece, I'm like jheeze
Stormzy's a don who's here to break barriers
Chip can't run out of bars, so it's peak
That's grime, that's grime, the ultimate vibe
Constant winnin', I won't take a dive
I will keep going 'til the wheels fall off 'cause
Even when I'm dead, my vibe will be alive
Man came from the back roads
On point, man are fully in stack mode
Straight London, buy a couple flats mode
Late nights, might work on my rap flow
You're plain and I'm the loaded nachos
I played the game for long on my cash flows
Used to waste money in my twenties
Now I've gotta keep an eye on where my cash goes
I can do it, I don't need to try
I can do it, I done it already, bro
Back in the days, I didn't have any dough
I was not Wiley, I didn't have any flow, now
I can do it, I don't need to try
I can do it, I done it already, bro
Back in the days, I didn't have any dough
I was not Wiley, I didn't have any flow, now
Now, now all of my dons get dough
From lyrics, riddims and flows
Let me go and do this show
I'm a impatient person, everybody knows
Wickedest MC alive
I provided all the pies, why would I lie?
Sorry if you've been deprived of
One of my wickedest vibes, I was goin' through life
Lookin' for an easy route
Then I didn't wanna live that life
My sound's alive, my sound's the in ting
All our names are on the flyers bein' printed, yeah
You might also likeBring Them All

All I need is studio time and a ounce
And some fast food, fizzy drink and an Uber account
Pretty swiftly's how the projects run
I come through, show 'em how it's done
Words float along inside your brain
You can pick which ones that you wanna say
I see some now but I'ma leave them there
Them words are not for me, so they get aired

See energies floatin' by?
You ain't gotta pick them all
Some energies, people are gonna go and pick
Won't fit them all
Some energies, dem evil in disguise
Tricked them all
If I wanna bring 25 MCs out
I'll bring them all

I'm nang and I know it
Pass me the mic, I'll show it
If an MC breaks down like a car breaks down
Then I'll come along and I'll tow it
Man fix things, small and big things
Man are eagle, man have big wings
Take a look at all the cars on the roadside
You're small rims, man are big rims
I was thinkin', don't tease that thought
Trust me, you don't really need that thought
Goodness, greatness, grief, that thought
Hold on, weight, let me see that thought
Sayin' I be the champ
Heavyweight, I'm in the ranks
Anywhere you go, just know
You help people like a big bro
See energies floatin' by?
You ain't gotta pick them all
Some energies, people are gonna go and pick
Won't fit them all
Some energies, dem evil in disguise
Tricked them all
If I wanna bring 25 MCs out
I'll bring them all

Think before you speak
Practice humble before you peak
If you move correctly
I know we can be cool before we meet
Don't be scared, go and take a shot
Piece of land for sale, I'll take the plot
If I do a song, that's crazy and credit's to be given
I walk up and take the lot, I said
I ain't scared to get my hands dirty
A likkle hard work won't hurt me
I wanna make my live rep clean up
Build up, start lookin' at arenas
Becuh my time ain't done
Wanna talk grime? Then I'm still the one
All of the doubt, that's gone
Why? Because I'm the lyrical don
 (x3)
See energies floatin' by?
You ain't gotta pick them all
Some energies, people are gonna go and pick
Won't fit them all
Some energies, dem evil in disguise
Tricked them all
If I wanna bring 25 MCs out
