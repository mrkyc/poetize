(Fine time to tell me you don't love me)
She's always tryin' it
Tellin' me I'm talkin' to this girl, that girl
This time, I ain't talkin' to no girl, haha
(You picked a fine time to tell me you don't care)
Classic
It's easy to talk about when it's true, isn't it?
This is too easy

Told me that you were at home sleepin' (Liar)
So many times you took me for a fool
Really, you were goin' out late in the evenin' (Slag)
In the club bang on the lash you were cheatin' (Up and down, you-you-you)
All them Victoria Secrets that you were keepin' (Shh)
That's not love, that's breakin' the rules
You think I'd never see those things you were tweetin'
Cut so deep (Oh), man couldn't stop bleedin' (Ah-ah, check this)
I was out there tryna get that house (On the grind)
All I asked for was a, "Well done, Junior!"
"Give my love to the boys" (Real shit)
Instead you wanna argue and make up noise
Shit's so fucked up, look at us now (You-You-You, fucked up)
No nice words comin' out of your mouth
We get drunk and then we say it's over
(Then) Get back together when we get sober
I don't what's true anymore (Oh)
We're just goin' around in circles now (Ah-ah, that's love)

(You were always)
I remember the times when I called you my queen and my wifey to be
But somehow I'm always in the wrong, so I guess it ain't you, it's me (You were always)
All the fights and the hype got a G stressed out but I can't lose sleep
But this time, I know that's it's over, bare more tings in the sea (You-You-You were always)

If I told you before still would've got mad though (Crazy ting)
I know you don't want drama, you don't want aggro (Sadly, nigga)
I still can't work out why you would cause a big scene in Nando's (Why?)
We had a good ting goin' on but that's how that goes (Damn, you-you-you)
I was drawin' away, in your house I didn't want to stay (Didn't wanna stay there)
Don't know when I woke up, I felt guilty for the whole day (Guilt trippin')
Too many women on my mind, too many swimmin' in my mind (Swimmin', swimmin')
Now I'm out of control (Oh), I've been steppin' out of line (Ah-ah, step)
Yeah, she was a fling so it weren't nothin' major, it was just vibes (Just vibes)
When I roll with her, she's got me in a natural high, no lie
And the time we spent was so great, I don't wanna blag (I don't wanna blag, no)
I'm thinkin' different now, babe, I don't wanna try (I don't wanna try no more, you-you-you)
I wanna move on 'cause I want a fresh vibe in the future (I wanna fresh ting)
I pick up on what's goin' on, trust, I'm not a snoozer (I don't snooze)
I know you heard I was spendin' bare time in the boozer (Haha)
I know the ting we had was cool (Oh), but this ting's much cooler (Ah-ah, much cooler, ice)
(You were always)
I remember the times when I called you my queen and my wifey to be

Always tryna press man's buttons and always tryna...
