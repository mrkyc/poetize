Whoo Kid

I'm getting so old
Feels like it was yesterday when I was nineteen (Nineteen)
Apologise if I say, suck your mum to haters who don't like me (Like me)
It's only cause I'm human
You should understand I don't put them beneath me (Beneath me)
Keep 'em on the same level (Same level)
It's probably why a major won't release me (Release me)
But ring me in a bit though
'Cause I can make your artist have a hit though
And I'm on the way back to my spot
With a few new vids that I already shot
Not that I ever left life on the top
But I got my faith back and I'm laid back
To the ladies, they wanna take me into the house
All over the house and she goes wild if I go crazy
I got studio booked in the morning but I wonder if I'll make it
Most of the time I go in the evening
Work so hard that I can't be lazy
You might also like
All I care about is women
And the money that I earn
If you think about the game
And you just haven't had a turn
I can tell you that it's magical
Just watch me and you'll learn (Whoo)
And I'm only getting older (Kid)
Somebody shoulda told ya I'm on one
Yeah, I'm on one
I said I'm on one
Fuck it I'm on one
Might upgrade when the cheeses do
Remember the haze and the cheese is you
Lemme tell you what the cheese will do
Control your mind and your breathing too
I'm on one
Fuck it I'm on one

Listen
Haters wanna doubt that I'm good
Niggers think I go clear and I'm outta the hood (Hood)
Creeping through the jungle, I'm out in the woods (Woods)
Catch me rolling through the 'narm, I'll be out there with judd
Go home, slip outta my boogs (Yeah)
Thinking how I used to move large, I'm out to the budge (Yeah)
Was out but I would have, got out if I could
So I lifted up my arms, held 'em out and I pushed
Mixtape came out with a woosh (Woosh)
Balling, came out with a swoosh (Woo)
Like an animal that came outta the bush
The real role model came outta the kush (Oof)
Big bad wolf, I came out with a woof (Woof)
These niggers characters, they straight out of a book (Umm)
Fuck a hand out, I went out there and took
Niggers stayed inside their house, I went out there and looked
They loving the swag (Swag)
Said they feel my deep voice, they be loving it bad (Bad)
I ain't one of them niggers that cum in a slag (Slag)
They wanna sex me, colour me bad (Jheeze)
If niggers roll out and they coming to spazz (Spazz)
Two pump actions, a mum and a dad
Will Smith niggers, they're coming to jazz
Fuck the police, hope that nigga gets one in his badge (Yeah)
They say I been starving the fans (Fans)
Right now I got the game in the palm of my hand (Haha)
And real talk, I'm part of a brand
I wish I coulda showed to my aunt and my nan
When I used to go school, never passed an exam
But divided the fractions, when I parted the grams (Yeah)
Couple mixtapes and the party began
I'm a rockstar and chicks wanna be part of my band
Yes
All I care about is women
And the money that I earn (Dayum)
If you think about the game
And you just haven't had a turn
I can tell you that it's magical
Just watch me and you'll learn (Whoo)
And I'm only getting older (Kid)
Somebody shoulda told ya I'm on one
Yeah, I'm on one
I said I'm on one
Fuck it I'm on one
Might upgrade when the cheeses do
Remember the haze and the cheese is you
Lemme tell you what the cheese will do
Control your mind and your breathing too
I'm on one
Fuck it I'm on one

I woke up in the club
Prada shades on
I'm part of a clan, but no my brother I'm not Raekwon
Too much women ain't enough women
That's people's wifey's here
Nigga, what women?
I'm an A&R
I should take you through
For you it's question time
Like who'd I take you to?
Only proper bosses, I'ma show you greater people they got knowledge, if you're good they'd like to know you owwww
I'm about to go, houses of parliament
I'm the king here, no argument
I don't show off, but I'd show you how the saga went
I done the core work, they don't know the half of it
Stated that the world would end, Nostradamus
It's feeling like the final days when I watched the farmers
Wiley is the name, I'll tell you how I got it
I copped a box of records and I weren't afraid to shot it
(Whoo Kid)
All I care about is women
And the money that I earn
If you think about the game
And you just haven't had a turn
I can tell you that it's magical
Just watch me and you'll learn (Whoo)
And I'm only getting older (Kid)
Somebody shoulda told ya I'm on one
Yeah, I'm on one
I said I'm on one
Fuck it I'm on one

I'm on one
Fuck it I'm on one
