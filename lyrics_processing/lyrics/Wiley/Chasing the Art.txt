Who ate all the pies? It was me, Wiley
Top boy riddims, yeah, made by me
But I didn't have any riddim in the tank though
That's why man had to phone up G
I sold vinyl, now I sell MP3s
And along with them, yeah, I sell CDs
When I get a haircut, shape up's right
Can't look like a 50 inch LCD
I've got time on my hands, grime in my hand
But grime, me and fans, we was in a full circle
They look into your life, don't matter if it's personal
Could be good, could be hurtful
Yeah, it's all human instinct
We're just following human imprints
We think we started this, started that
When you look on the real side, we're wrong in an instant

I said you ain't gonna get anywhere with all that hate in your heart
Don't wanna take too much of the grime legacy so I'm taking a part
"What you gonna do musically now it's not all about making your mark?"
Well, I'm back where I wanna be, it's not about money, I'm chasing the art
You might also like
When I'm chasing, I'm chasing, I won't stop chasing
No system is gonna block the creation
I'm a grime king of the king conversations
Not a grass, I don't need compensation
I'd be further if I was more patient
Like waiting for the trains at Euston station
Always in a race with the time and
I ain't gonna win but I'm racing
I run up on the stage like bang, came with a bang
Didn't even wanna be a lyrical thang
But it's dead where I'm standing, could've been stranded
If I never worked every day like my Nan did
Some dons, they don't wanna work though
While I'm here sitting with a workload
Even though I didn't get paid any money for my first shows
In music, I've got a name that the world knows


Don't throw shots, cause I will throw shots
We could throw pans, or we could throw pots
We could throw houses, we could throw shops
I don't give a damn because I've seen the whole lot
I said don't throw shots, I will throw shots
We could throw keys or we could throw locks
We could throw stones or we could throw rocks
I don't give a damn because I've seen the whole lot
I said don't say nuttin' if you ain't saying somethin'
Just cuh man are cool, don't press my button
Yes, I got dons on my side who will curry man
Pepper man, just like mutton
Every now and then we've gotta make an exception
When dons storm the game like Stormzy and Section
Team went quiet for a while but
Now we are headed in the right direction
