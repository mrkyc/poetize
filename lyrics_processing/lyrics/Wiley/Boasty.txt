Used to stand up on the block, now I'm always on my own
Look around, all of us are always on the phone
Buy a house cash, I ain't tryna get a loan
All the chains and watches I leave them alone
Still got the drip though, I be drippin' those
All the fresh drips, I be poppin' up in those
Bought so many cars, I ain't got enough toes
When they saw the black and yellow on my whip, bruddaz froze like

Boasty, boasty
Godfather, man are OG
Man a half humble, man are boasty
Fling a ragga riddim like it's '03
Boasty, house on the coast G
My money so long it doesn't know me
It's looking at my kids, like I'm boasty
I fly around the world 'cause I'm boasty

When I invest it's gotta be a gem
If I drop a half then I wanna see a M
My brudda drop a three, then he's gotta see a ten
Meet buff gyal we're never gonna see again
Used to stand up in a dance brudda, 30 man deep
In the after party we don't wanna go to sleep
Everybody wanna be a don I hear
You looking for the top boy, standing right here like
You might also like
Boasty, boasty
East side nigga like Toasty
I bust a dub step like Coki

Used to stand up on the block, now I'm always on my own
Look around, all of us are always on the phone
Buy a house cash, I ain't tryna get a loan
All the chains and watches I leave them alone
Still got the drip though, I be drippin' those
All the fresh drips, I be poppin' up in those
Bought so many cars, I ain't got enough toes
When they saw the black and yellow on my whip, bruddaz froze like

Boasty, boasty
Godfather, man are OG
Man a half humble, man are boasty
Fling a ragga riddim like it's '03
Boasty, house on the coast G
My money so long it doesn't know me
It's looking at my kids, like I'm boasty
I fly around the world 'cause I'm boasty

Standin' on a rooftop, lookin' at the sky
Which city next? 'Cause I feel I wanna fly
Which gyal wanna come and sing me lullabies?
Gyal dem ah love me, they wouldn't come here otherwise
You can see the Cali weed when you look into my eyes
Man call Drizzy and a couple other guys
Holla Medz let a brudda catch a vibes and-
Check my drip, let a brudda catch a vibes
Man drop twenty racks on a power bike (drop)
Hit the road, let me show you what the powers like (ayy)
My antennas dem are strong like a satellite
Dish bars out daily, let's have it right
I'm active when it comes to flexing
'Cause a bro seeing bro is a next ting
Sunshine blazing, I ride out
Boasty, boasty
Godfather, man are OG
Man a half humble, man are boasty
Fling a ragga riddim like it's '03
Boasty, house on the coast G
My money so long it doesn't know me
It's looking at my kids, like I'm boasty
