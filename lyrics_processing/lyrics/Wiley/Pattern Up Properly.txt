When I'm on a mission
I can't let anythin' stop me
When I'm on a mission
I can't let anyone knock me
That's why when I go out
Gotta make sure my ting pattern up properly
That's why when I go out
Gotta make sure my ting pattern up properly, listen

My ting pattern up like mosh
Trouser, blazer, waistcoat and shirt
In my life, now man are big brand like Bosch
I won't forget, I came from the dirt
If I go to a dance to rave, I think smart
Keep humble, I play my part
I've had a sick flow from the start
And I walked in the shubs with Jermaine and Marc
I've got bars for the shubs
Bars for the gyal dem, bars for the crooks
Anyone tryna set pace
Gonna get a nah look straight in the face
Anyone tryna get lairy
Better be careful, don't come near me
My dons are in here
I'm right but a couple of wrongs are in here

Yo, so everyting pattern
When the big dog's on campus
OGs, killers and champions
My darg, remember your manners
Cuh mi nuh tek tough talk, rise every cannon
Slap one out of the rooftop
We mek dem scatter when they say they wanna group up
Bumbahole dead, tell a man move up
Alright then, shut down, shop and then roll out
Global, we nuh lock one town
Gun bag, 'nuff of dem are gun clown
None of them are ready for us to start dumpin'
Man ah move scary like Halloween pumpkin
Clart one, mek them stop frontin'
Some likkle man need to remember
That the farrda always been a don king

I'm a lyrical phenomenon
When I'm on the riddim, ain't nobody badder than this
I'm honey, lemon and overproof rum
You're just a likkle Lemsip
I'm an old school vet, you're a bandwagonist
Ayy bwoy, tek time inna dis
I'm an HGV, you're a full licence
Don't carry no weight like this
I'm a known heavyweight inna dis
You're known as a bantamweight inna dis
If your girl ever saw me in the dance
You would ah get left lookin' ever so pissed
Your girl told me when it comes to the beatin'
I am the pro on and you're on a mist
But let me tell you straight, when it comes to the eatin'
You are the pro cuh
