My team's got a lot of dons
And we're doin' this ting, go check out the songs
"Man Don't Care", we "Shutdown" the park
You can see us onstage like, "What's Goin' On?"
BBK got a lot goin' on
Skepta, that's my brudda, that's my don
They could never control how man are doin' it
It's authentic, can't go wrong

Can't go wrong
Can't go wrong
When it's straight from the heart, you can't go wrong
If it's a real vibe then you can't go wrong
Can't go wrong
Can't go wrong
When it's straight from the heart, you can't go wrong
If it's a real vibe then you can't go wrong

When it's straight from the heart, the music gets heard
Could've been a roadman, could've been a nerd
Dad told me, "Don't follow the herd"
Instinct, yes, I follow the word
I used to go and get what I'm given
Now I go and get what I'm worth
Still goin' strong 'cause I gotta believe
That I'm the wickedest grime MC on this earth

What's gwanin'? What's the motion?
Fresh out the oven like a Sunday roast
You can find me swimmin' in the ocean
Sunset, I might drive round the coast
When it's showtime, jump on a plane and take flight
I stand out like one brake light
Everybody wants their crew to be sick
But you and your crew are just one great hype
