She said she wan' buy a Givenchy bag, bag small, but di price dem large

Bad ting, ting, but I made her badder

Say she never been to Selfridges, never been to Harrods
I should send you Primark just to keep a balance
One man to your pum pum, I could imagine
Cah pussy feels better when getting it's a challenge
Drippy young nigga, always flexing, it's apparent
You see me with a 10/10, just can't lower my standards
They saying she a gold digger, but I ain't a broke nigga
When her exes couldn't get the bill, she was embarrassed, so
I could be your Santa, baby, with some claws though
Could never put a ring on any ho, ho, ho
Way she wine sweet, what's that, moscato? Ayy
Tick and tock, make it clap, bravo, ayy

With the late-night lovin' got me tryna call on ya (Late)
Fuck your ex, that nigga old news (Uh)
You just need someone to go to (Go)
And she knows she a bad lil' mama
Givenchy, nah wan' no Dolce Gabbana
She finessing, never care about karma
Still I think that pussy might be worth all the drama, for real
On the east side with this ice on chill
Ayy, I'm with the mandem still
But you could be mine, baby, signed and sealed (Signed and sealed, let's go, let's go)
