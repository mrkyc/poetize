I tell a don it ain't funny
That's why I practice, so I stay on point like P Money

I ain't never been the type of spitter on a track
To have a donny murk me and never murk back
'Cause all I wanna do is see my name at the top
That's why I can't act like I never heard that
I've got ears, am I hearing, any pussy test, I will spear him
Them man have got one bag of chat
They've got one bag of Ps, what you bringin' round here?
Ask them what they're doin' round here
Cuh if they want a bit of mine, tell a man I want to get rid of guys
I'm known for rollin' with man that's clearly uncivilised
Man will fill in these pitta guys
About they wanna take man for a mouse
'Til I press a button and get your fanpage minimised
Every single one of their flows are epitomised
Everyone's sick 'til I realised
Nobody's sicker than the sickest MC
When you realise nobody's slewin' 'em again
I ain't Skepta, but man's been there, done that
And now man is on doin' it again
Don't touch my set, you'll ruin it again
There he goes offbeat, you're doin' it again
Mad, man can't diss my mum
Every clash I've had, I'm on bringin' in a skeng
Oi, Wiley, tell them again

When I was broke, I was better at this
My money got me couple iceberg sweaters and this
When I started, I didn't know I'd get on the list
Of MCs who were top flight, sprayin' on the top mic
Ain't done the work but you boast that it's not right
Used to waste grands on garms but now I shop right
First ten years, G, I was on a block hype
Some MCs are alike but I'm not like
None of them, and I've had wars with a ton of 'em
Nobody's ever gonna do what we done again
Put me in any scene, I end up runnin' it
My crew are winners, we end up sonnin' them
Cuh my dons stand on the frontline
Ready for the war in the cold or the sunshine
You wanna flop in your game but I run mine
I be in the skillzone, bullseye, one time
That's why I practice, so I stay on point like P Money (I'm telling you)
I tell a don it ain't funny
That's why I practice, so I stay on point like P Money (brap, brap)
I tell a don it ain't funny
That's why I practice, so I stay on point like P Money, P Money
I tell a don it ain't funny (hey)
That's why I practice, so I stay on point like P Money, P Money

Yo, a lot of these MCs think they're bad
I held the MAC and the MAC went mad
This something screaming ratatat
And now you're a myth nobody know, blam
Everybody scatters, nobody look back
Don't drink loads and think that you're rough, blud
