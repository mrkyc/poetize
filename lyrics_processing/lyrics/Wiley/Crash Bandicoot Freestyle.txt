Listen up

The way I stay live on the daily's crazy
I get short tempered, don't talk pay me
Turn to the darkside if my days ever get rainy
Drain me, never not maybe
Yeah I do know Jamie
And I know Sadie
Her she's a cool young lady
Back to the way I live daily
Had bare dough but that didn't change me
Yeah I got a daughter
Newborn child but her name ain't Amy
I ain't got a Winnie the Pooh scarf
But you can bet I'm getting one
So stay away from me
I'll spray three eighths and I'm not even crazy
Not even lately
Don't fuck about 'cause you can't irate me
Wile out one don't know how to take me
Take out crews on a daily
I said I take out crews on a daily standard
I done the dance more than your whole gang could
I swing through man just like Flowdan would
I ain't from Brentwood, I come from Danwood
Straight from man a bad man wood
Stand in flames you could not 'cause you ain't from Danwood
Your whole plan would flop
If you come across me and got lairy, standard
The bars I write they're like scriptures
I'm famous and everybody takes pictures
I had faith since decks and mixers
And you're a non believer
So I can't see you in the distance
Picture the game as a whole
Healthy like the Boy Better Know tee business
J's my witness
I'm a musician ask Skepta
Three of us talk, we make a decision
You know me I got good vision
Rude boy listen
Don't f about
There'll be a rude boy missing
When the goons start fishing
I'm a L.O.N. kid
I got the hood snakes hissing
Me, the shotter that you couldn't really see
Made the dream come true after years of wishing
After years of dissing, years of swinging
I still do the crime and walk, no singing
See the level I'm at, they wanna be at
The brake horse power's like a 20 valve Fiat
There ain't a club that you won't see me at
'Cause I'm a street star
There's no set time I have my tea at
You might see me draw a G at
