She was glowing up (Glowing), nightclub blowing up (Blowing)
Didn't have a show but hey I'm still showing up (Still showing up)
Look at the bottles, see champagne flowing out
('Course I spend more than a bag when I'm mowin' up)
Yep yep, another one impressing her
But she ain't impressed by the fame and the dough ya know
But I just like to see her face glowing up
So red carpet, back seat are rolling up
One rule for her, one rule for me, cause she don't wanna be even
I don't wanna be the one to go and pack my bags n tell her I'm leaving
I'm trying to give her chance, I think she needs to learn the meaning
It's no fling, I'm carrying feelings, so when I'm with you it's like I'm dreaming

Reality check, yo
I see the glow in you, and it felt right when I spoke to you
And I can't wait til we're so together, you holding me, and me holding you
And I see the glow in you, and it felt right when I spoke to you
And I can't wait til we're so together, you holding me, and me holding you

One thing I've learnt in this life is money of the root of all evil
You have to open your eyes, especially when you do what we do
I let you into my life and expressed to you my feelings
And that show you how serious I'm being, so why are we beefing for no reason?
Reality check yo
I just wanna do my thing, and avoid all things that can't help me
If I didn't have another hit song, the label woulda probably shelf me
In this current climate I can tell you that ain't healthy
That's why I ball out living wealthy, but I ain't gonna do that cause you tell me

Reality check, yo
I see the glow in you, and it felt right when I spoke to you
And I can't wait til we're so together, you holding me, and me holding you
And I see the glow in you, and it felt right when I spoke to you
And I can't wait til we're so together, you holding me, and me holding you

I used to watch her skin glow from my window
So bright I call her flaming
Hey there's no introduction needed, but wait, I still gave her the intro (Intro)
She told me she don't wanna be involved with a MC
But now she in so deep
If I leave for a week she'll ring loads
Even ring co for info
It's reality check
She's mad at me yeah, all off what her friend Natalie said
But I haven't had any sex with anyone but her
I swear down babes I ain't bang any skets
'Cause I don't wanna see her lose control
And I don't wanna see you lose your glow
And I don't wanna have to sleep alone (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
It's a Reality check tho
We can build this bridge before we make it worse
'Cause without you there's something missing in myself
Believe me it's me that needs the work
I'm giving you the time that you deserve
'Cause even heaven couldn't make this match no better, we just work
It's a Reality check tho
Reality check, yo
I see the glow in you, and it felt right when I spoke to you
And I can't wait til we're so together, you holding me, and me holding you
And I see the glow in you, and it felt right when I spoke to you
