What, what, what, newcomer yeah?
What, newcomers?
What, trying a ting, trying a ting?
Ey right now it's Eskiboy
You know me
Big up all the Roll Deep massive, all day
Hold tight Michalis
It's all real
What is he trying a ting? Newcomer yeah?
Yo, listen

Who me? I'm a legend
I got stripes you can never get
Do you know what's stored in my memorex
So much, I smoke lemons
I can't get vex, start licking off tech's
I'm a nine life boy, not a nine wife boy
Looking for cheques, I'll run upon your set quick
And you don't know why I get angry
Every time I see you, you're on some other flex
And I won't get the chances my brother gets
But I can teach him still, I'm educated
World wide music, I'm highly rated
Got a block of cheese and grated
I've never faded, even when my house got raided
I'll bounce right back like a badman
Grands in weeks, that's what I was making
I got a few concerns just as long as I'm bading
You might also like
Bad 'em up, bad 'em up, bad 'em up once
If you wanna come and take man for a dunce
I've been on the grind for a hundred months
And I ain't stopped doing music, not once
Bad 'em up, bad 'em up, bad 'em up once
If you wanna come and take man for a dunce
I've been on the grind for a hundred months
And I ain't stopped doing music, not once

A new MC's born every weekend
But you're not ready for me so buckle up
Don't get rude, man will shut him up
Standard procedure, serious, bad 'em up
Get on the mic and lyrically rough 'em up
Shh-hut-yuh-muh, you're not rough enough
Make you jam like Matt Lamont, you can't scuff
I'm old school like Karl Tuff Enuff
You're new school, you're not aggy
Jme badman, yeah I'm aggier
I go to Berlin, Sweden, Malia
Napa, France, pockets get baggier
I make dough while you're on the radio
Going mad but you're not mad enough
Boy Better Know that I'm maddier
Make so much P's you can't add 'em up
Bad 'em up, bad 'em up, bad 'em up once
If you wanna come and take man for a dunce
I've been on the grind for a hundred months
And I ain't stopped doing music, not once
Bad 'em up, bad 'em up, bad 'em up once
If you wanna come and take man for a dunce
I've been on the grind for a hundred months
