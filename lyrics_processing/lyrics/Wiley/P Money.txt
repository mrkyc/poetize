I tell a don it ain't funny
That's why I practice, so I stay on point like P Money

That's why I practice, so I stay on point like P Money, P Money

I ain't never been the type of spitter on a track
To have a donny murk me and never murk back
'Cause all I wanna do is see my name at the top
That's why I can't act like I never heard
I've got ears, am I hearing, any pussy test, I will spear him
Them man have got one bag of chat
They've got one bag of Ps, what you bringing round here
Take one shot, hear the bells ringing round here like
Who are you blud? Who are they? What'd you want?
Could've never come around and take man for a punk
Could've been sober or drunk
I will grab a don so slam dunk, concrete
But you wanna send dons on me
That's when things start going terribly wrong, G
Them are fraud, always tryna con me
Well, I'm ready, if it's on, it's on, G
I came and I conquered, I sprayed your sponsors
Got a scary flow the same as the monsters
Aliens don't even know how I do it
Nike Air don't even know how I do it
Get a reload on the stage like "pull it"
When I get the ball, I know where to put it
I'm a don like Frank Rijkaard and Ruud Gullit
Stray bullet

When I was broke, I was better at this
My money got me couple iceburg sweaters in this
When I started, I didn't know I'd get on the list
Of MCs who are top flight, spraying on the top mic
Ain't done the work but you boast that it's not right
Used to waste grams and guns but now I shot right
First ten years, G, I was on a block hype
Some MCs are alike, but I'm not like
None of them, and I've had wars with a ton of 'em
Nobody's ever gonna do what we done again
Put me in any scene, I end up running it
My crew are winners, we end up stunning them
Cuh my dons stand on the front line
Ready for the war in the cold or the sunshine
You wanna fuck with your game but I run mine
I'll be in the skillzone, bulls-eye, one time
I tell a don it ain't funny
That's why I practice, so I stay on point like P Money
I tell a don it ain't funny
That's why I practice, so I stay on point like P Money
I tell a don it ain't funny
That's why I practice, so I stay on point like P Money, P Money
I tell a don it ain't funny
That's why I practice, so I stay on point like P Money, P Money
Yo, a lot of these MCs think they're bad
I held the MAC and the MAC went mad
This something screaming ratatat
And now you're a myth nobody know, blam
Everybody scatters, nobody look back
Don't drink loads and think that you're rough, blud
