Constant winning, I won't take a dive
Trust me darg, I can't let that slide
I run the park, manna big like Hyde
I could show the houses, bikes and the rides
No matter what you think, it's an uphill struggle
Don't doubt me, I could show you the light
If you don't know me yet, I gotta tell you
I'm the wickedest MC alive

Bring it to life, bring it to life
Keep saying it and you might bring it to life
Help bake the cake, and I'll give you a slice
Bring the corned beef, and I'll bring you the rice
May as well holla at me, I do it right
I don't wanna see a wack verse in sight
Big publishing that's cause I write
And my fans sing my songs in the middle of the night
I mind my business in the middle of the hype
You know why, cause I live a real life
You coulda been top dog but you didn't wanna try
See my legacy it's never gonna die
I rate my journey cause I never got a bligh
You can follow it online, if you've ever got the time
I'm a killer, I'm a killer, I'm a killer with the rhymes
Man coulda dead more than 21 times
You might also like
Constant winning, I won't take a dive
Trust me darg, I can't let that slide
I run the park, manna big like Hyde
I could show the houses, bikes and the rides
No matter what you think, it's an uphill struggle
Don't doubt me, I could show you the light
If you don't know me yet, I gotta tell you
I'm the wickedest MC alive

I don't want the hate that goes with it
But if a star bigs me up, I roll with it
Go to the park, having a stroll with it
When I hit the studio, step in the booth
I remind myself, when I become in control of it
Lord knows I'm cold with it, bold with it
You and I both saw when he posted it
Westwood freestyle roasted it
Didn't know if anybody would notice it
I just do it, I had to fling a couple flows for it
I just knew I had to go and put my soul in it
Any mistakes made, I gotta roll with it
And I value my craft, so I can't fall
Out of touch with the worth of the brand
Manna set, I ain't gotta search for a brand
And I can't have an idiot hurting the plan, so it's
Constant winning, I won't take a dive
Trust me darg, I can't let that slide
I run the park, manna big like Hyde
I could show the houses, bikes and the rides
No matter what you think, it's an uphill struggle
Don't doubt me, I could show you the light
If you don't know me yet, I gotta tell you
I'm the wickedest MC alive

Oh what a baz
Ain't tryna hear what a next don has
No you must be crazy, you must be mad
What everybody's got, I don't wanna have
I don't wanna buy what I've already had
Walking down the streets, going on bad
I don't wanna take away, I wanna add
I've done it all already, I ain't gotta throw a jab
I ain't gotta throw ninja stars at people
Together we stand, divide and we fall
Where's my brudda, hearing me now
Cause I gotta be there for him when he calls
Mic check one
If you test man in my circle, they will spray back, you will get bun
To me it's all fun, it's all games
One day I'm gonna fling riddim like James
Maximum boost, don't get shakey
I ain't gonna lie blud, nuff of them are snakey
Manna move darkside, manna move hasty
Man copied the style, it's like he wanna trace me
Come from the east like Joey and Casey
Never know where the money's gonna take me
So I bust a move, gotta do it for the safety
Coulda been a rolex, coulda been an AP
I said, big up Paigey Cakey
I spit the fire till my scene can't take me
You can't move me, you can't drapes me
Not on Youtube or any site in HD
On this earth, is where God placed me
Don't get bright, don't get facety
All the music dons getting ratings
Why? Cause I know that they rate me
Constant winning, I won't take a dive
Trust me darg, I can't let that slide
I run the park, manna big like Hyde
I could show the houses, bikes and the rides
No matter what you think, it's an uphill struggle
Don't doubt me, I could show you the light
If you don't know me yet, I gotta tell you
