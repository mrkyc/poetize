Them have a style but them nah bad like ah we
Them have a song but them nah bad like ah we
When we ride pon the riddim, them nah bad like ah we
When we hype di crowd, them nah bad like ah we

Old time, someting come back again
If you have a start, then you must have a end
None of dem ever coulda test wid di pen
My pen's the equivalent to the leng
Bare vibes, manaman ah send them again
Five plus five, that equal to ten
You know seh MC Wiley have 'nuff girlfriend (Know seh MC Wiley have 'nuff girlfriend)
When we ride pon the riddim, that's ten outta ten
'Nuff a dem are scared, they nuh step out again
We seh all of mi dargs dem ah step out fi dem
We seh, all of mi dargs dem ah step out fi dem, yo

Them have a style but them nah bad like ah we

Them have a ting but them nah bad like ah we
Them have a lyric, them nah bad like ah we
When we ride pon the riddim, them nah bad like ah we
When we hype di crowd, them nah bad like ah we

Boy, you know that you the truth
You ain't got nothing to prove
They ain't got nothing on you, you
When you look into my eyes
Know the ting gon' maximize
Love it when we improvise-ise
See the way you riding the bassline
Better put your hands on my waistline
Know the body bad, it's a big crime
See the way you riding the bassline
Better put your hands on my waistline
You know the body bad, it's a big crime

Them have a style but them nah bad like ah we

Like a who, dem nah bad like ah we
Tru mi lyrics dem ah fire like a artillery
When mi sit down pon di riddim, sit down pon it easy
If a sound try a ting, dem get bucked up and bury
From mi step inna di dance, step inna di party
Whole heap a gyaldem jus a hang onto we
And a pure pretty gyaldem jus a run follow we
Original rude bwoy from London city
We nuh ramp, we nuh skin, yuh know seh we nuh easy
And mi nuh want any gyal wid nuh lazy body becah'
Bad like ah who, 'cah them nuh bad like a we, becah'
Bad like ah who, 'cah them nuh bad like a we
