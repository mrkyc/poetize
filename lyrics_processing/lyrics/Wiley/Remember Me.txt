Hey
I was putting in work, the money came after
In the rave tryna get burst, music, ladies and laughter
Yo, I fell down on the floor, my life got a bit darker
But then I got back up, and the fans said I'm the Godfather

I've had times in my life that were cringeworthy
Real street life, yeah, I seen it from early
Could've been much worse off than I am
But I'm still the genius like Richie Turvey
Played with the fire but the fire burnt me
Was a good kid but the streets turnt me
Ledley made it and Ashley made it
But what about Ryan, Yogi and Kurdi
Even back then when my flow was perky
Certain dons tried do me dirty
But my OGs on the road are certi
There ain't much that can stop me or hurt me
One off, don't die 'cause an MC cursed me
Been mobile ever since it was Mercury
The game took a turn when a man dropped "Flying"
Now I'm sleepless, every day I wake up early

Don't hope for much but I just hope you remember me
Bigging up the MCs on my team and the ones that sent for me
A don told me the Godfather title ting, it was meant for me
And it don't matter what you say to me, I just hope you remember me
You might also like
You see the game's open, I ain't loafing
Got it in motion, thought I was over it
But I was... ghosting, in my own bubble
But I never stray away from bars, I stay floatin'
I just stroll in, still rollin'
Deep waters, catch him and hold him
I'm a librarian like Logan
And if I ain't got it, I can phone him
It won't work if it ain't real, I know the deal
People talk trash and the trash looks real
If you don't read in between the lines
You get lost out 'ere in the field
Sorry, that's real, hold on for just a second and chill
I was Will back then and today I'm still Will
I still will, I still spray 'cause I love it
I could never regret it 'cause I've done it

Don't hope for much but I just hope you remember me
Bigging up the MCs on my team and the ones that sent for me
A don told me the Godfather title ting, it was meant for me
And it don't matter what you say to me, I just hope you remember me

I used to buy cars
Before I bought houses
I used to get producer block
But now I go 'round it
Ayy, I used to get arrested
I couldn't wait to leave the police station
I used to be a eediat, running my mouth
In the beef with the paigons, is what it is
I be the backpacker, the first backpacker
The first grime kid to care about what matters
Listen to myself in peace with no chatter
Market my brand like Patta
I remember when Titch had a bright green Kappa
Back then, I was a full-time trapper
I got the music in my soul
And if you put me in a band, I'll play the maracas
Don't hope for much but I just hope you remember me
Bigging up the MCs on my team and the ones that sent for me
A don told me the Godfather title ting, it was meant for me
And it don't matter what you say to me, I just hope you remember me
Don't hope for much but I just hope you remember me
Bigging up the MCs on my team and the ones that sent for me
A don told me the Godfather title ting, it was meant for me
And it don't matter what you say to me, I just hope you remember me

I was putting in work, the money came after
In the rave tryna get burst, music, ladies and laughter
Yo, I fell down on the floor, my life got a bit darker
