"Moonlight is thought to transform some people into strange creatures to drive others mad."
"Hola, soy Fernando Allende."
"One small step for man...giant leap for man-..."
"Does the moon actually possess such strange powers? Or is it all just... lunacy?"

Let's take a blast to the moon, baby
I sit around wishing you well
How I'm craving you
Yeah
Every time I'm near you
I always wanna swallow you down
I'll be right here if you need me

In my life, I'll need you here
Don't ask why and I'll never disappear
Why is it every day that I feel the pain?
Ah, yeah

Let's take a trip to the stars far away
Where were you when I was down?
Staring into the dead
Dead
My pain is caused by my pleasure
And my soul mate lives in your body
I can't get you out of my head
It never goes away

In my life, I'll need you here
Don't ask why and I'll never disappear
In your eyes, you can bid me farewell
Don't ever try to understand my situation
Why is it every day that I feel the pain?
It always comes when I least expect it
When I'm looking for love
Always seem to be regretting it
Why is it every day that I feel the pain?
Ah, yeah
Yeah

"I had nothing to do with this."
"Tolerance. Tolerance for pain."

"And we can't have weakness."
No, I can't be stopped
"I had nothing to do with this."
"I had nothing to do with this."

Don't be sad that I feel this way
I'd rather just keep making the same fucking mistakes
Over and over and over again
Please, can't this fucking mistake be over?
"I had nothing to do with this."
"I had nothing to do with this."

"And we can't have weakness."
"And we can't have weakness."
"Tolerance. Tolerance for pain."
"Tolerance. Tolerance for pain."
"Tolerance for pain."
