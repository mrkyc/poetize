Like the poison running through your veins
You're addicted to the pain and the shame
Chasing the same game every day
Hooked on all your bullshit and your vanity

Blind decisions, no regrets
A bitter sweet of toxic sweat

Take my pride, taken chances
All my life, never answers
But in time, you just wait
You're gonna say my name
Break this bind, cut my losses
No more carrying all your crosses
'Cause in time, you just wait
You're gonna say my name
Oh! You're gonna say my name!

A normal situation in disguise
Dragging me through your self-inflicted lies
Too bad you're never gonna win this game
Your misery's your only friend and you're to blame

Blind decisions, no regrets
A bitter sweet of toxic sweat

Take my pride, taken chances
All my life, never answers
But in time, you just wait
You're gonna say my name
Break this bind, cut my losses
No more carrying all your crosses
'Cause in time, you just wait
You're gonna say my name
Oh! You're gonna say my name!

Bringing everybody down, down, down
And turn it around into the same game
Twisting it upside down, another go-around
You're gonna say my name
It's gonna come around... Yeah!
Bringing everybody down, down, down
And turn it around into the same game
Twisting it upside down, another go-around
You're gonna say my name
You're gonna say my name, say my name
Take my pride, taken chances
All my life, never answers
But in time, you just wait
You're gonna say my name
Break this bind, cut my losses
No more carrying all your crosses
'Cause in time, you just wait
You're gonna say my name

Oh, bitch! Say my name!
You know you're gonna say my name
