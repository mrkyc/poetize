Something wrong, something right
Something missing...
Something black, something light
Something different...
Don't you ever feel you need
To speak to me that way
Something black, something light
Something different...
Something wrong, something right
Something missing...
Don't you ever feel you need
To speak to me that way

All this noise in my head
Ringing through and echoing
Simple things just take too long, long, long...
It's not like I'm not listening
But you just keep on flipping it
And maybe one day, I'll be gone, gone, gone!

Something wrong, something right
Something missing...
Something black, something light
Something different...
Don't you ever feel you need
To speak to me that way
Something black, something light
Something different...
Something wrong, something right
Something missing...
Don't you ever feel you need
To speak to me that way

To me that way

Try to leave the past behind me
But you just keep reminding me
And threw it in my face so wrong, wrong, wrong...
I try to see things your way
But something changes every day
And every question way too long, long, long...

Something wrong, something right
Something missing...
Something black, something light
Something different...
Don't you ever feel you need
To speak to me that way
Something black, something light
Something different...
Something wrong, something right
Something missing...
Don't you ever feel you need
To speak to me that way

To me that way
To me that way
Oh... oh... I've been missing yesterday
Oh... oh... Taking me so far away
From where I belong, yeah
Making me someone I've never known

Something wrong, something right
Something missing...
Something black, something light
Something different...
Don't you ever feel you need
To speak to me that way
Something black, something light
Something different...
Something wrong, something right
Something missing...
Don't you ever feel you need
To speak to me that way

To me that way
