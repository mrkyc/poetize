It's not complicated
Or very hard to grasp
But every time I see you
I laugh
I won't get too sappy
I had no epiphany
I just enjoy your company
(Pre-chorus)
You test my nerves, it makes me stronger
So can you bother me a little bit longer?
(Chorus)
Hate to say goodbye, goodbye (and I)
Hate to see the end, the end
Cause it's been so long since I made a friend
Hate to say goodbye, goodbye (and I)
Hate to see the end, the end
Cause it's been so long since I made a friend like you
(Verse 2)
I could dot the I's and you could cross the T's
Cause letters alone are lonely
I could be the blossom
And you could be the bee
And then I can call you honey
You might also like(Pre-chorus)
You test my nerves, it makes me stronger
So can you bother me a little bit longer?
(Chorus)
Hate to say goodbye, goodbye (and I)
Hate to see the end, the end
Cause it's been so long since I made a friend
Hate to say goodbye, goodbye (and I)
Hate to see the end, the end
Cause it's been so long since I made a friend like you
(Bridge)
Some like to be
Alone, independent, and on their own
All alone, I guess they're free
But not me
Not me
(Outro/Fadeout)
Hate to say goodbye, goodbye (and I)
Hate to see the end the end
Cause it's been so long since I made a friend
Hate to say goodbye, goodbye (and I)
Hate to see the end, the end
Cause it's been so long since I made a friend like you
Hate to say goodbye, goodbye (and I)
Hate to see the end, the end
Cause it's been so long since I made a friend like you
Cause it's been so long since I made a friend like you
Yes it's been so long since I made a friend like you
