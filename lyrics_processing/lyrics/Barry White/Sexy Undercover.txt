Baby, you know I'm nasty by nature

Just when you thought that it was safe
I'll come along with a new twist
I'll share my wildest fantasies
You never thought it'd be like this, oh no

Any time and any place (Oh yes)
So good time won't go to waste (Oh no)
Every day's a little treat (Mhm)
It could be loud or discreet (Uh-huh)
I know you can't tell from the outside
But baby, there is plenty in store
You know I'm as shy as they come, girl
Until I get behind closed doors

I'm your sexy undercover
Girl, I know just what, what you like
Your one and only lover
I'll surprise you, girl every time (Sexy)

Girl, I never want to be alone
It's like ice cream without the cone
One without the other
It just wouldn't taste right, oh nooo
You might also like
Any time and any place (Oh yeah)
So good time won't go to waste (Oh, oh no)
Every day's a little treat (Mhm)
It could be loud or discreet (Oh yeah)
I know you can't tell from the outside
But baby, there is plenty in store
You'll never know I'm as quiet as they come, girl
Until I get behind closed doors and I'm yours

I'm your sexy undercover
Girl, I know just what you like
Your one and only lover
I'll surprise you, girl, every time (Sexy)

Sexy, sexy
Sexy undercover (I can't get enough of your love, babe)
So on and so on, sexy, sexy, sexy

I know you can't tell from the outside (Know what I'm sayin')
But baby, there is plenty in store
You know I'm as shy as they come, girl
Until I get behind closed doors
Sexy undercover
I'll surprise you, girl, every time
Your one and only lover
I'll come up with it every time
Sexy undercover
Girl, I know what you like
Your one and only lover
I'll come up with it every time (Sexy)
