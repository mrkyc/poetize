Deep within your eyes
I see a sign that says goodbye
I can feel it when we kiss
Oh, don't let it end like this
Let's wash away the slates
Before it's too late
We both made our mistakes

I'd give everything I own
To keep your love at home

Lady, sweet lady
I'd give my love to you
If you'd only say you love me too
Lady, sweet lady
I'd give my love to you
If you'd only say you love me too

Tender was the night
Two people sharing love so right
All the memories we made
I wanna keep it this way
No matter what I do
This love depends on two
And girl, that's me and you
You might also like
I'd give everything I own
To keep your love at home

Lady, sweet lady
I'd give my love to you
If you'd only say you love me too
Lady, sweet lady
I'd give my love to you
If you'd only say you love me too

Lady, sweet lady

I wish that I could find
Some way to make you change your mind
Let's give it one more try
I know we're gonna make it this time
Let's put us back together
But this time it's forever
And I swear, I swear, I swear it's true
Please don't walk away
Hear what I got to say
Lady, sweet lady
I'd give my love to you
If you'd only say you love me too
Lady, sweet lady
I'd give my love to you
If you'd only say you love me too
Lady, sweet lady
I'd give my love to you
If you'd only say you love me too
Lady, sweet lady
I'd give my love to you
Just say you wanna love me too
Lady, sweet lady
Just let me give my love to you
Just tell me you want me too
Lady, oh sweet lady
I'd give my love to you
If you'd only say you love me too
Lady, sweet lady
I'd give everything I own
To keep your love here at home
Lady, sweet lady
I'd give all my love to you
Just say you love me too
Lady, sweet lady
I'd give everything I own
Just to keep your here at home
Lady, sweet lady
I, I, I, I, I, ooh...
Lady, oh sweet lady
I'd give my love to you
Just say you'll love me too
Lady, oh lady
I'd give my love to you
Just say you'll love me too
