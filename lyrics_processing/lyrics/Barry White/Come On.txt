You're a freak, sweet freak
You like to play
Hypnotic, erotic, sexy little ganes
You like to play
Just look at you
All that movement
All those subtle little movements
You like to play
Baby believe me when I say
I just love to play with you

Come on, come on, come on girl (Come on, baby)
Come on, come on, come on babe (Come on, baby)
Come on, come on, come on girl (Come on, baby)
Come here baby

I can't stand it, I can't much more
The way you dance, oh baby
You move your body like you're teasing me
Oh yeah baby, ah baby

I'll love you day and night
I'm with you wrong or right
I'll keep you satified
'Cause satifaction's guarenteed
Oh wait, show if you mean that much to me
Girl I need your love
Just give me all your love
Love you, oh baby
Oh right now, right now
Right here, right here baby
