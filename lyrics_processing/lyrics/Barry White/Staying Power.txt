I'm not going nowhere
I'm staying
Baby, I'm staying
You know why?
I've got staying power

Lady, I've made plans
In a fancy restaurant where we can dance
Put on my favorite dress
You know the one that oozes sexiness
Tonight, when we make love
I'm going to work your body with my tongue
Oh baby, my mission's clear
There's more than love that keeps you here

I've got staying power
Just when you think it's over
I'll come right back again
I've got staying power
Just when you think it's over
I'll come right back again
I've got staying power
Just when you think it's over
You might also like
Slow down, don't be so fast
Anticipation makes a good thing last
Tease me with your emotions
Soon we'll share nature's body lotion
Are you ready to free?
Girl, you know you got just what I need
Oh baby, my missions clear
It's more than love that keeps you here

I've got staying power
Just when you think it's over
I'll come right back again
I've got staying power
Just when you think it's over
I'll come right back again
I've got staying power
Just when you think it's over
I'll come right back again

No, baby, I'm not going anywhere
No no no, I'm not going anywhere
I'll be here
I'll be here
For years and years
Tonight when we make love
I'm going to work your body with my touch
Oh baby, my mission's clear
It's more than love that keeps you here

I've got staying power
Just when you think it's over
I'll come right back again
I've got staying power
Just when you think it's over
I'll come right back again
I've got staying power
Just when you think it's over
I'm right back again
I've got staying power
Just when you think it's over
