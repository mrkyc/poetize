I need love
I need life
I need to know that
That I have someone that I can love
Baby, you're the one
The one I need

Can you make me feel the way I think you can?
And girl, can you make me realize
How good it is to be a man?
Can you take the cold nights
And make them seem so warm
Can you unfold mysteries
And thrill me with all your charm
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

You're the one I need (The one I really need)
Girl, you're the one (Sure 'nough)
