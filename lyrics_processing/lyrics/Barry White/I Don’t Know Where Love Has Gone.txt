You know I never knew love could ever hurt this way
Baby, I never knew that a man could fall so deep in love this way
But, baby there's so many things I don't know
There's one thing that I wish I did know
Where is?
Where has our love gone?

I, I don't know where love has gone (No, no, no)
I, I don't know where love has gone
(You better believe me baby)
I, I don't know where love has gone (No no no)
I, I don't know where love has gone (No, no, no)

Where is the joy
The joy we used to know
How did we lose our love
Where did our love go?

Whatever happened to
All the promises we made
I remember every little word
Everything we used to say
You might also like
I, I, I, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
I don't know where love has gone
I, I, my darling, iiiiii, I don't know where love has gone
I don't know, yes, I don't know

I got to try
To make you understand
We've got to save our love
Or do it all again

Whatever happened to
All the promises we made
I remember every little word
Everything we used to say

Girl, iiiii, I don't know where love has gone
I, I, I, I, I don't know, I just know where love has gone (No)

Baby, you know what I feel like doing?
I feel like going out and buying me out a one way ticket to anywhere
Just anywhere I don't care
I don't know where love has gone
My darling, I don't know where love has gone
Whatever happened to
All the promises we made
I remember every little word
Everything we used to say (Ah, ah, ah)
I don't know where love has gone (No, no, no)
