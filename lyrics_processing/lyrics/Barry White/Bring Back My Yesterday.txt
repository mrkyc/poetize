What am I supposed to do now?
You're going, I know you're going
You're leaving me, baby - I know, I can tell
What did I do? What did I say?
Why are you doing this?
Baby, I love you - my life is nothing without you
Before, we were so happy together, so much together
I'm not lying, I'm totally mixed up
I'm so damn mixed up
I just can't figure out what went wrong
Won't you give us a chance
Won't you think it over
Baby, please, won't you change your mind

Yesterday, I felt so good inside
The joy you gave
The love we made
Fulfilled my life
Today, I'm alone
Without you, dear
There's no life here
I can't go on
You're all that I
I'm thinking of
I just can't forget
The way it was
Happy times were yours and mine
Now misery is all I see
Don't let it be
Oh, darling, please

Bring back my yesterday
Bring back the love you took away
Bring back my yesterday
Bring back the love you took away

I'd give the world
And all I own
For one moment
That we have known
It's strange
How you changed
Yet, I've remained
In love with you
I still feel the same

Bring back my yesterday
Bring back the love you took away, yeah
Bring back my yesterday
Bring back the love you took away
Bring back my yesterday (Ah yeah)
Bring back the love you took away
Bring back my yesterday
(Bring it all back, yeah)
Bring back that love you took away
I want your love
I need your touch
Oh, without your sweet love
I can't exist, no, no, not like this so

Bring back my yesterday
Bring back the love you took away
Bring back my yesterday
Bring back the love you took away
(Bring back that love you took from me, yeah)
Bring back my yesterday
Bring back the love you took away
Bring back my yesterday
Bring back the love you took away
(Bring back that love you took from me, yeah)
Bring back my yesterday
(Bring it on back)
Bring back the love you took away
(Baby, bring it on back, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby)
Bring back my yesterday
Bring back the love you took away
(Bring back that love you took from me, yeah yeah yeah)
Bring back my yesterday (Bring it)
Bring back the love you took away (Oh baby baby)
