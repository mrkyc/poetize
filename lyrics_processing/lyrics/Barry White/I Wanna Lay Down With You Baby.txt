Baby you know some men find it hard to express what they feel
I don't know why this is so hard, but I know a lot of them that do
I have no problem telling you how much, how much I love you
How much I need you, or want you
Some men are very bashful about doing certain things, especially when it comes to making love
Hehe, you know frankly speaking I don't feel a thing
I, I just love to undress you
I just love to undress you
I think it's very beautiful that a man can, that a man can sit and watch his lady, admire her body
I mean really get into it
I wanna lay down witcha babe repeating
There's nothing wrong with this
Hehe, is there baby, ain't nothing wrong with it
That's while you'll see me gently, very gently, taking, taking my time when I, when I, when I slip your little panties off
Because love to me is a way of life
And baby we got all the time in the world when we're making love, we, we never make love in a hurry
Never, ever in a hurry
So you see baby I, I really don't have a problem when it comes to telling ya just or showing ya just what I feel
It's, it's just the way I am
We make love so sweetly, I wanna make it with you yeah
We give love completely, nothing we won't do (Yeah)
