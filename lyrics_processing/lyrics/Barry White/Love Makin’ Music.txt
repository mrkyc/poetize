There's all kinds of music
Fast and loud, soft and slow
Classical and pop, rhythm and blues
But baby, you know which one I choose

There's no better music than love makin' music (No no)
Love makin' music, sweet love makin' music (Mmm, yeah)
And you are the music, I love makin' music, I love makin' music
You know that I do and there's nobody who
I wanna make it with more than you, no, oh no

Please hear what I say
Girl you simply blow me away
Just feel our bodies blend
Oh no, don't let this never end, no no

Can you feel my love going through you?
Don't you feel the mood getting to you?

There's no better music (No no)
Than love makin' music (I like that music, yeah)
Yeah, I love makin' music (I love it, I love it)
Sweet love makin' music (You know that I do)
And there's nobody who I wanna make it with more than you, no
You might also like
Hold it right there, baby, all night, yeah
The lights are way down low
Girl, just let your feelings grow

Can you feel my love going through you?
Don't you feel the mood getting to you?

There's no better music, (No better music)
Than love makin' music, (No better than, no better baby)
I love makin' music, (I love it, I love it, yeah)
Sweet love makin' music, (You know that I do)
And there's nobody who I wanna make it with more than you

There's no better music than love makin' music
Love makin' music, sweet love makin' music
And you are the music, my love makin' music
Love makin' music, sweet love makin' music
There's no better music than love makin' music (I love it)
Love makin' music, sweet love makin' music (I love it)
And you are the music, my love makin' music (I love it)
