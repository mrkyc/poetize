Baby, it's really amazing what I go through without you
You know sometimes I find myself counting
Counting the hours, the minutes, the seconds, the moments

Darling, please don't make me wait too long
I wanna love you, baby
Can't you see it's only you I want
And you I need
Please don't make me wait too long
I wanna love you, baby
Can't you see it's only you I want
And you I need

When I'm away from you
Seems like forever, yeah
Girl, if you only knew
What I go through without you
But knowing in a moment I'll
I'll see that face and see your smile (Give it here)
I turn the key (Give it here), open up the door (Give it here)
Girl, there you are, I can't take much more

Darling, please don't make me wait too long
I wanna love you, baby
Can't you see it's only you I want
And you I need
Don't make me wait too long
I wanna love you, baby
Can't you see it's only you I want
And you I need
You might also like
You're in my arms again
And heaven is waiting
Ah, one more kiss and then
And I'll be in time be making
Making you feel inside
Have you pleased and so satisfied (Give it here)
No visits tonight (Give it here), and no phone calls (Give it here)
You've got what I want - girl, I want it all

Darling, please don't make me wait too long
I wanna love you, baby
Can't you see it's only you I want
And you I need
Please, don't make me wait too long
I wanna love you, baby
Can't you see it's only you I want
You I need

Baby, I swear that I, I really can't take much more of this
Swear I really can't take much more of this
Give it up, baby - oh Lord, give it up
What do I have to do to make you, make you...
Oh, please don't make me wait too long
I wanna love you, baby
Can't you see it's only you I want
You I need
Please, don't make me wait too long
I wanna love you, baby
Can't you see it's only you I want
And you I need

Please don't make me wait too long
Girl, don't make me, make me
It's only you I want, I want
Don't make me wait too long, too long
It's only you I want. I want
Don't make me wait too long, too long
It's only you I want, I want
