You know my feelings for you
Are getting stronger and stronger every day
And I'm learning more and more
And more about you every day
And there's an area that we need to address
Mentally, physically and romantically
Immediately
Tell me, show me
All the little sensitive places
That make you feel
The way you love to feel
Baby, I want to please you tonight
Baby, I really need you tonight

Don't you want to know
Girl, if we can fill the nights with love
Don't you want to know
If it's better than it's ever been before, yeah

We've been together
Now for quite some time
When you gonna let me make love to you?
Baby, it's so obvious
We're like two of a kind
We just wanna make sure we're right
You might also like
Don't you want to know
If we can fill the nights with love
I do, baby
Don't you want to know
If what we feel is really real or no

I'll go nice and easy
I'll go gentle and slow
I realize that it's our first time
I won't miss a lick or miss one stroke
Just want to mesmerize your mind, your mind, your mind
Your mind, your mind, your mind, your mind
Your mind, your mind, your mind, your mind
Your mind, your mind, your mind, your mind

Don't you want to know
Don't you really, really want to know
You won't answer me, but in your eyes I see
The answer is very clear

Bring down the lights
Bring down the music
Baby, let's bring down the house
Don't you want to know
Don't you, girl
Don't you want to know
Bring down the lights
Bring down the music
Baby, let's bring down the house

Don't you want to know
If we can fill the nights with love
I do
Don't you want to know
If it's better than it's ever been before

Bring down the lights
Bring down the music
Baby, let's bring down the house
Mmm, I need to, I want to
Baby, I really want to
Girl, I really need you, I do
Help, I do
Bring down the lights
Bring down the music
