I love to talk to you
It's not every day that a man can find a woman that
That he just loves talking to
Different strokes for different folks
And you know what baby? That's very, very, very, very true
We're into our own world, in our own way
Doin' our own thing
And I hope that you can
Truly, truly understand what I'm trying to say to you right now
Because I think it's very important that you know
And that you realize just what you are to me
You're not just another woman, you're not just another fling
You're not just another ego trip, you are my hope to die woman
Needing you is a part of what I feel for you
Wanting you is a part of what I feel for you
But loving you, huh, baby that's all of me to you
I've been blessed, I swear to God I've been blessed
Because I've got you
And in everything that I want to be
And everything that I have to be and everything that I've got to be
It's all because of you baby, all because of you
(I can't believe that you love me)

I can't believe that you love me
I can't believe that you want me
You might also like
Girl you're mine
To love, to keep
I declare, I swear
You're so doggone sweet
To share your love with only me
And give your love so tenderly
How lucky can I be (Oh, baby)
Oh, babe (Oh, baby)
My pretty little babe (Oh, baby)
Oh, no babe

No, I
I can't believe that you love me
I, I can't believe that you do, that you want me

To find a love like yours these days
I declare, I swear
Ain't no way
Girl, my world is at your feet
And a love so real and so complete
For eternity (Oh, baby)
Oh, baby (Oh, baby)
My precious little babe (Oh, baby)
Mmm, oh no, baby
No, I
I can't believe that you love me
I can't believe that you want me

Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, darlin'

No, I
I can't believe, girl, that you want me
I, oh, I, I can't believe, I can't believe that you want me
My darling, I, I can't, girl, I can't believe it
Honey, I can't believe it
Girl, I just can't believe it
Oh I, I can't, I can't believe, girl, I just can't believe
You want me, you want me, yeah, you want me, you want me
I, I can't believe that you want me, girl, you want me

And with every word, it's, it's true, baby
I swear I do
And all that I own
Is all for you
I, I can't, I can't believe, girl I can't believe
Honey, I can't believe it
Girl I can't conceive
