You know I really wish him all the luck in the world
Cause he's gonna need it
He let you get away baby
Yeah I know he's got that sad, sad story
But I gotta story for him, goes like this
When ya move, ha, ya lose
Finders keepers, losers weepers
I don't care how he feels or what he tryin' to say
He never should've let you go, never should've let you stay
Now I've got you here at last, now he's certain and he's so sad
He better go out and try to find him someone new
Cause I don't see no other one but me, givin' his love to you
No, no

Cause I love you more than anything in this world, oh girl
And I need you more than anything in my world, oh girl
You know what I'm willing to do to keep you here?
Baby, any damn thing that I have to
That's the way it is baby, that's just the way it is
Lover and pleaser
Your heaven and keeper
That's the way I feel, I just can't help myself
Girl, low and deep you won't need love from no one else
Now I've got the chance to prove all the things that I've told you
With every breath I take, you're the air I breathe
And every step I make, you're always there with me
Oh, no
You might also like
I love you more than anything in this world, oh girl
I need you more than anything in my world, oh girl
I love you more than anything in my world, oh girl
I love you and baby I need you
Finders keepers, oh losers weepers
Your lover and pleaser
Your happy keeper
Oh, misuse her you lose her
Confuse or abuse her
Baby you know what, I don't wanna hear a thang that he's got to say
Because you're here in my life now, that's where you're gonna stay
I don't wanna hear a sorry
I don't wanna hear a reason why
I don't wanna hear a nah-pish
