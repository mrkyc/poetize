There's that look again
You know what I'm talking about
That insecure, that unsure that, that wondering look
It's all in your eyes, baby
You're sitting there and you're wondering:
Does he really love me as much as he says he do?
Does he really need me and want me as much as he says he do?
Baby, I can't
Sit around you twenty-four hours a day telling you
"Baby, I love you, I need you and I want you"
But I feel like right now, right at this moment
I should try to clear and make you feel reassured about me, huh
Women are sensitive, very sensitive
Baby let me tell you something, you know
Just as hard as a woman can love a man
A man can love his woman
And baby believe me, I do love you
Everything I have is you
And I don't like to see you look this way
I don't like to see you feel this way, I don't
I want you to be together
And know and feel and be sure at all times
We're going to make it baby, huh
You better believe me
The world is ours, no doubt in my heart or my mind
You and me babe, huh
Just you, and me, I know, you know why?
Because
You might also like
If I thought, I would lose you
I couldn't feel the way that I do
In you I found, my world of ecstasy
Honey, you are, honey, you're all I need
You and me together, we were meant to be, yeah

Girl, it's true, yeah
Girl, I'll always love you, I do
Yes, I'll always love
It's true, yes, I'll always love you
It's true, girl, yes, I'll always
Love you

With every step I make, and every breath I take
You and me, baby, you and me

Girl, I know, we're going make it
'Cause what we feel is real
And we don't have to fake it
I'm giving you, everything I've got
And truly I, I don't want to ever stop
You, you and me together, girl, we were meant to be
Yes, it's true, yeah, girl, I'll always love you, I do
Girl, I'll always love you I do
It's true, girl, yes, I'll always love you, I do
Yes, I'll always love you
