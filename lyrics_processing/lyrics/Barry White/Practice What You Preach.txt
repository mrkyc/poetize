So, what do you want to do?
I'm here, baby
I'm ready, baby
I'm waiting on you
Believe me, I am patiently waiting on you

Girl, there's something wrong with me
Every time I'm alone with you
You keep talking 'bout you loving me
Hey babe, your foreplay just blows my mind
So why don't we stop all the talking, girl
Why don't we stop wasting time?

I've had, my share of lovers
And some say I'm damn good
But if you think you can turn me out
Baby, I wish that you would

'Cause you keep telling me this and telling me that
You say once I'm with you, I'll never go back
You say there's a lesson that you want to teach
Well, here I am, baby, practice what you preach
I'm telling you this, I'm telling you that
'Cause once I've been with you, you'll never go back
There is a lesson that I'm gonna teach
Well, here I am, baby, practice what you preach

Some of them were damn good

And how you're gonna do it to me
