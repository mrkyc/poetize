It's not every day
That you can find something in your life
That is worth all the money in this world
Happiness
And for the first time in my life
I find it hard for me to express myself
Or the way I feel
It's plain to see why I wanna scream
Makes me wanna holler
Makes me wanna shout
It makes me wanna sing lyrics of love and joy and happiness
And what just stays with me
Dig this

Never thought I'd find someone who'd blow my mind, girl
Like you do
And never thought I'd see the day that it could be
So true, yeah

Yes, I found someone, yeah
Someone that I can give my love to
And do all the things I've longed to do
Girl, I've found out it's you, it's true
It's true, it's you
You might also like
Never have I known the kinda love you've shown
In my life
And don't believe myself, feel better than I've ever felt
Yes, I know why
It's all because I...

I've found someone, yeah
Someone that I needed so bad
You're nothing like the others I've had
Heavenly Father, I'm so glad, it's true
Honey, it's you

Ah yeah, mmm
Oh, oh
I've found someone, someone
Oh, I've found someone

There's no more words to this song
But, still, I want to express the way I feel
This love is so different, so new
My darling, it's so you
Oh, because I, I, I've found someone, yeah yeah yeah
Someone that I can reach out and touch
Your smiling face, it means so much
Girl, you'll be the one I need
When things go wrong
I'm gonna need your strength
To keep me strong
Oh, I don't care, I don't care
I don't care what you do
It's gonna take the rest of my life
Taking care of you
Mmm, baby
Mmm, mmm, my baby, my baby
