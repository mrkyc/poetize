Baby, put it in
Everything you ever wanted is here
Put me in

Put it in

Or how you want it
Or where you want it
Just take my love and put it in your mix

I'm waiting patiently
Hoping that I can be in your mix (I'm still here)
It's you that I adore
Just wait there's so much more, in my mix
Sweet as honey it can be
But you're the lock and you're the key
All the love you need is near
So open up and have no fear
