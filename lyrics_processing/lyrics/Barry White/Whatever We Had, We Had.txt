As the world turns from day to day
As we live we have to make decisions
And when we make those decisions
Things don't always turn out
The way we'd like them to
Or the way we want them to
No matter what we feel
Or what seems real, things change
We don't have a crystal ball to look into
To know what our future is going to be
Or what it's gonna be
You meet someone
You care for that someone and you love that one
We made plans and we planned for so many things
But life has always been that way
So you must understand how I feel when I say that
We had our run
Good times, sad times, the fun times, the bad times
We should always remember that we started as friends
And there's no reason we shouldn't end as friends
So whatever we had, we had

Whatever we had, we had
Whatever we had it's over, over now
We parted as friends
And for that I'm so glad
But whatever we had, we had
You might also like
You know time has played
A very important role in our relationship
It was time that, that first brought us together
And it's time that we separate and leave each other
No matter what you might think
Parting is always sweet sorrow
But whatever we had, we had

Whenever we loved, we loved
Whatever it was, it's over, over now
We both understand
Things don't always fall the way we plan
But whatever we had, we had

You know we did a lot of things in those years
We felt a lot of pain through tears
But there's something that we, that we did that I'll always
Always be thankful for
Together we created a very very special life
And that's why I'm saying to you that
Whatever we had, we had
And I know that we'll both be right
As long as we live life to its fullest
Because it doesn't really matter now
Who's right or who was wrong
Just live, be happy
You'll find someone, somewhere
Believe me, please believe me
But whatever we had, we had
We could have worked harder
But who knows
We went as far as we could go
But whatever we had, we had
We'll always be friends
And for that I, I'm so glad
But whatever we had, we had
Gone are the days
They seem so many years away
But whatever we had, we had
