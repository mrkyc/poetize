Baby, you know, I think we all need to
Take an inventory of
Our love and our feelings
When it's involved with that - with that special lady or that special someone
When I say "we all" I'm talking about all men
All the brothers around
The Black brothers, the White brothers, the Brown brothers, the Red brothers
Because you know basically all woman are the same
And we need to, we need to take in consideration that
That woman is God's greatest gift to man
And we need to take in consideration that nine out of ten times
They will be and they will do anything that we want 'em to
You know it doesn't take much
Than beautiful flowers, a simple card that says "I love you"
Somewhere to be and say "Baby, I need you"
You know that's why I'm so in love and so wrapped up in you, baby
Because I can give you what God gave me
The only thing that I feel that I really own is the life that I live
And to you I give this life and my love
You know why?

Just because of love I found in you, I feel this way
Never had a dream come true, not until the day
You came into my life and made it all so sweet
Girl, you did it all, you did it all for me
Please

Let me, live my life. Loving you girl
All the rest of my life, my life
Close, to you, girl
No one but you, girl

I dedicate my love, you got my heart and soul, forever
The greatest story ever told
How we love each other
When the people talk, they will smile and say, say
You're the only one who made it all the way
Hey

Let me live my life loving you-ou-ou, you, babe
All the rest of my life, close to you, babe
Come home...
Let me, honey, let me live my life, my life, my life
Woo babe, woo babe, woo babe
I wish that I could find
Another way to show, show
What I really feel
How much I love you so
Oh, let me live my life, loving you-ou-ou, you, babe
Rest of my life, close to you, babe
So I give, all that I have to give to you
But just as long, as you, as you want me to
Everything, baby
The air I breathe
The love I need
Everything is, everything is you
Only you, baby
Only you
I guess you could even say it's, just another way, to say, I love you
I need you, I want you

Let me live my life, loving you
Rest of my life, my life, close to you
Mmm baby
