Don't do that
Baby, please don't do that
What are you cryin' for?
Is it because you're sad or mad or...?
Nothing's gonna go wrong
Sometimes we feel inside of us that
That everything we have is only here for today
But every now and then two people get lucky
And find that certain thing that make them wanna
Just keep it, just keep it that way
I don't want you to feel that
That you have to go through these changes, baby
No way, no way
I know that our love is different
Our lives will be different
Trust me, baby, trust me

Now that I'm here, no more tears
Come here, come here
And you won't find things that broke your heart
And blew your mind
Not here, no, not here

And my, oh, my
Girl, can't you see, can't you see that I
I've got so much to give to you, my dear
It's gonna take a lifetime, it's gonna take years
To you my dear, I've got so much to give
It's gonna take my lifetime
It's gonna take years and years and years and years
You might also like
And I'll fill you in your hopes and dreams
Believe me, girl, you got everything
Right here, right here
No one could offer you more
Than the love I have for you in store
It's here, oh, oh, yeah

And my, oh, my
Honey, can't you see, can't you see that I
I've got so much to give to you, my dear
It's gonna take a lifetime, it's gonna take years
To you, my dear, I've got so much to give
It's gonna take my lifetime
It's gonna take years and years and years and years

Believe me, baby
We found that certain thing
That certain feeling
That lets two people express themselves how they feel
Let your love flow inside of you
Don't be afraid, don't be afraid, baby
Feel how it flows
That's outta sight
That's the way you're supposed to be
Now wipe all the tears away
Nothing in this world is gonna happen to us
Nothing in this world, baby
When you find that real thing, somehow you know
We'll be strong and we'll be together
Right on, right on
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Ah, my baby, my baby, ooh ooh
What am I, what am I gonna do? What am I gonna do with you, girl?
Oh, what am I gonna do? What am I gonna do with you, girl?
