No more questions no more lies
I will tell you the truth looking in your eyes
If I were president
Well first and foremost son, Jesus Christ is the only one
You're going to talk to when your day begins
I'm going to pass a law that says everyday you gotta get down on your knees and pray, Thank the man for dying for you sins
Chorus:
If I were president, I would make you understand
Jesus is the man he's the reason that we stand, if I were president
We're gonna put the word out on the streets, no more Washington, DC
I'm gonna make this country big and strong
No more paying of your taxes
The capital's in Fort Worth, Texas, that's the only place a house that big belongs
Chorus:
If I were president, the blue-collar man won't get the shaft
Nobody's gonna laugh when Jason Boland is my chief of staff
If I were president
Well, Iraqi boys you must be nuts
You're digging yourself deeper in a rut
I got a way to end your problems soon
We'll bring home every one of our boys
And pull out our biggest baddest toy
And blow you crazy bastards to the moon

If I were president, nobody's going to push us around
If they threaten us or put us down we'll burn their county to the ground
If I were president
Well, I got one for you Sadaam Hussein
We're gonna resurrect General John Wayne
Put together a very simple plan
We'll put down our nukes put down our guns
And you and the Duke will be one on one
And he'll kick your ass as if you were a man
Chorus:
If I were president
If I were president
If you don't like Willie Nelson, you gotta go to prison
If I were president
So cast your vote and make it me
And if I win the beer is free
