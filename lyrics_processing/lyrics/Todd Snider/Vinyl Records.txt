I've got a dusty old pile of vinyl records sittin' on my floor
I've played each one of 'em over and over a dozen times or more
All I've got is a beat up chair, a mattress, a fork and another to spare
And that dusty old pile of records on my floor
I got Willie Waylon and Woody Guthrie
Jimmy Buffett, Lyle Lovett and Bobby Gentry
Jerry Jeff, Bob Dylan, Donnie Fritts
The Dead, The Doors, Patsy Cline, John Prine and more
I got Jackson Browne, Townes Van Zandt, Zeppelin, Lynyrd Skynyrd
Harry Chapin, Guy Clark and Van Halen
I got Rita, Kris, Keith Sykes and Country Joe when he was singin' with the Fish, you know
I got Emmylou, U2 and Arlo, James Taylor, Jimmie Rodgers, Hank Williams, Mojo Nixon
Hendrix, Haggard and a whole lot more
In that dusty old pile of vinyl records I got sittin' on my floor
One time in San Francisco, I was standin' in an airport line
In one bag I had all my clothes, in the other was all them ol' records of mine
The lady said I could only bring one bag, I had two, oh what a drag
I had to jump on the plane and leave all my clothes behind
But I got Willie Waylon and Woody Guthrie
Jimmy Buffett, Lyle Lovett and Bobby Gentry
Jerry Jeff, Bob Dylan, Donnie Fritts
The Dead, The Doors, Patsy Cline, John Prine and more
I got Jackson Browne, Townes Van Zandt, Zeppelin, Lynyrd Skynyrd
Harry Chapin, Guy Clark and Van Halen
I got Rita, Kris, Keith Sykes and Country Joe when he was singin' with the Fish, you know
