I had that new book with pictures of Madonna naked, I was checking it out
Just then a friend of mine came through the door
Said she never pegged me for a scumbag before
She said she didn't ever wanna see me anymore
And I still don't know why
I think I'm an alright guy
I think I'm an alright guy
I just wanna live until I've gotta die
I know I ain't perfect but God knows I try
I think I'm an alright guy
I think I'm alright
Now maybe I'm dirty and maybe I smoke a little dope
It ain't like I'm going on T.V. and tearing up pictures of the Pope
I know I get wild and I know I get drunk
But it ain't like I gotta bunch of bodies in my trunk
My old man used to call me a no good punk
And I still don't why
I think I'm an alright guy
I think I'm an alright guy
I just wanna live until I've gotta die
I know I ain't perfect but God knows I try
I think I'm an alright guy
I think I'm alright
You might also likeYou know just the other night these cops pulled me over outside a bar
They turned on their lights and ordered me out of my car
Man, I was only kidding when I called 'em a couple of dicks
But still they made me do the stupid human tricks
Now I'm stuck in this cell with a bunch of dumb hicks
And I still don't why
I think I'm an alright guy
I think I'm an alright guy
I just wanna live until I've gotta die
I know I ain't perfect but God knows I try
I think I'm an alright guy
I think I'm alright
I think I'm an alright guy
I think I'm an alright guy
I just wanna live until I've gotta die
I know I ain't perfect but God knows I try
I think I'm an alright guy
