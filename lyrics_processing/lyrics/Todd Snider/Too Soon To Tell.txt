Low, grey clouds rollin' over my head
I'm walkin' up a hill to get my fortune read
I can still take rejection but it does get harder to do
I wish I could show you how you've hurt me in a way that wouldn't hurt you too

Tennis shoes hangin' from a telephone wire
I've got a little money, I could get a little higher
I was alright awhile but you know how it goes
Everything in moderation, including moderation I suppose

I never did like the people where I was employed
They was always out to get me 'cause I'm paranoid
Now I'm workin' for myself and that don't pay a lousy dime
If what we're here to do is learn to forgive, I'm gon' need a little more time

It's too soon to tell (too soon to tell)
It's too soon to tell (too soon to tell)
It's too soon to tell (too soon to tell) by and by
It's too soon to tell what's goin' to happen to you when you die

It's too soon to tell what we'll ever avenge
They say that living well is the best revenge
I say, "Bullshit, the best revenge is revenge"
This isn't over, we're going to meet again
You might also like
And good Lord if you're up there, you sure got some nerve
Seems like even the wicked get worse than they deserve
We're afraid to die, every goddamn one of us
I swear to God it's like you're makin' fun of us

Not worth keepin', or too good to keep
You got a better kinda secret, better wait 'til I'm asleep
And if you're so God almighty well then what's with all this mystery?
Yes, I wanna trust you, buddy, but you're clearly keeping secrets from me

It's too soon to tell (too soon to tell)
It's too soon to tell (too soon to tell)
It's too soon to tell (too soon to tell) by and by
It's too soon to tell what's gonna happen to you when you die

At the fortune teller's on the second floor
In bright red letters hangin' off of the door
It said "closed", I think it might've been some kinda sign
Don't give up on me, baby, I think I could be losin' my mind

I've just met too many people that I love too much
They're scattered all over, I could never stay in touch
With the travellin', almost forever it seems
You too will wake up one morning with a lot more memories than dreams
Low, grey clouds rollin' over my head
I'm walkin' down the hill without my fortune read
I can still take rejection but it does get harder to do
I wish I could show you how you've hurt me in a way that wouldn't hurt you too
