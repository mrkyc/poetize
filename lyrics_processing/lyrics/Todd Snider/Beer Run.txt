A couple of frat guys from Abilene
Drove out all night to see Robert Earl Keen
At the KPIG Swine and Soiree Dance
They wore baseball caps and khaki pants
They wanted cigarettes, so to save a little money
They got one from this hippie that smelled kinda funny
And the next thing they knew they were both really hungry
And pretty thirsty too

Found a store with a sign said their beer was coldest
So they sent in Brad 'cause he looked the oldest
He got a case of beer and a candy bar
Walked over to where all the registers are
Laid his fake ID on the countertop
The clerk looked, and turned and looked back up and stopped
And said "Boy, I'm not gonna call the cops
"But I am gonna keep this card"
The guys both took it pretty hard

Had we only brought a better fake ID

They met another old hippie named Sleepy John
He claimed to be the one from the Robert Earl song
So they gave him their cash, he bought 'em some brews
It was a beautiful day in Santa Cruz
They were feelin' so good it shoulda been a crime
The crowd was cool and the band was prime
They made it back up front to their seats just in time
To sing with all their friends
"The road goes on forever and the party never ends"
