I won't give a damn
If tomorrow never comes
I will not be afraid to meet my maker
Just the way that i am
You can't prove anything
But one thing is true
If you can steal from me
I can steal from you
Any kind of heaven every body doesnt get in
Won't seem like a heaven to me
They tell you that the garden of eden was perfect
But you couldn't even eat off the apple tree
And for heavens sakes look out for that snake
Lying to your woman constantly
Adam must have scratched his head
Looked up and said
Lord this just isnt doing it for me
If tomorrow never comes
I won't give a damn
If tomorrow never comes
I dont want to be afraid
To come and meet you just the way that i am
I can't do anything im dying to
If tomorrow never comes
Tonight will have to do
You might also likeI say i dont ever claim to know whats going on around here
I dont even know where im from
I know where im going when i get to where im going
What im doing when i get done
You tell me im forgiven if i need to be
I say permission ought to come that easily
Im piling cores up underneath this apple tree
Singing oh lord have mercy on me
If tomorrow never comes
And tonight is all i got
If tomorrow never comes
I dont want to be afraid
To come and meet you just the way that im not
Can't do anything
And then you die
Judge the judgemental and what am i?
Aaahhhhhhh
Either way im every guy i ever tried not to be
I want everything as good as it gets
Ive learned nothing but that there is another sun rise coming
All but one of the times it sets
And if tomorrow never comes
Tomorrow never comes
If tomorrow never comes
Tomorrow never comes
If we were all good people
We could work in perfect rythmn
If worms had daggers
