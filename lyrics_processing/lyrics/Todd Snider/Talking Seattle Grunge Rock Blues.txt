Hey-hey, my-my
Rock and Roll will never die
Hang your hair down in your eyes
Make a million dollars

Well I was in this band goin' nowhere fast
We sent out our demo but everybody passed
So one day we finally took the plunge
We went out to Seattle and we started playin' grunge
Washington State, that is
Space Needle
Eddie Vedder
Ichiro Suzuki

Now to fit in fast we got flannel shirts
And we turn our amps up until it hurts
We got bad attitudes, and what's more
When we play we stare straight down at the floor, oooh
I ain't seen nothin' like that on television in, like, an hour

Now to fit in on the Seattle scene
You had to show people somethin' that they'd never seen
So thinkin' up a gimmick one day
We decided to be the only band that wouldn't play a note
Under any circumstance
We called it Silence
Music's original alternative
Roots grunge
You might also like
Well we spread the word through the underground
That we were the hottest new young band in town
The record guy come out to see us one day
And just like always we refused to play
It knocked him out
He said he loved our work
He said he loved our work but he wasn't sure he could sell a record that didn't have any music on it
I said "Man you've been doing that all year"

Hey-hey, my-my
Rock and Roll will never die
Hang your hair down in your eyes
Make a million dollars

Well they made us do a video but that wasn't tough
We just filmed ourselves smashin' stuff
It was kinda weird 'cause there was no music
But MTV said that they would love to use it
The kids went wild, the kids went nuts
Rolling Stone gave us five stars, said we played with guts
We were meetin' chicks, takin' drugs
They asked us to do MTV Unplugged
You should've seen us
We went right out there and refused to do acoustical versions of the electrical songs we refused to record in the first place
Then we smashed our shit
Well we blew 'em away at the Grammy's show
By refusing to play and refusing to go
Then just when it looked like fame would last forever
Along come this band that wasn't even together
Now that's alternative
That's the alternative to alternative
They're called Guns n' Roses

(Sing if you know, alright)
Hey-hey, my-my
Rock and Roll will never die
Hang your hair down in your eyes
Make a million dollars

Well our band got fired and that's not funny
'Cause now we're hooked on grass but we're out of money
So the other day I called up the band
I said, "Boys I've taken all I can
"I say we shave off these goatees, pack up the van
