Call it a room with a view
This was the best night of pool that I ever shot
I made a lot of money too
I was looking for some company
In the weekly "Scene"
Seen an ad it, just had to be you
I hadn't seen you since New Orleans
And I never did figure out where you ran off to
I know I looked bad the last time you saw me
But lately I been doin' all right
I won a tournament last week in Oklahoma City
Hustled half of this town tonight
I got some cocaine if you want some
It's the best that I could find
Hey, we could just sit here and talk all night
If that big ol' guy out in the car don't mind
Like old times
Screw off the top on a bottle of wine
Living out our own kind of American dream
Old times
Your goal was always the same as mine
You didn't want to throw a fishing line in that old main stream
You know I ain't expecting anybody but you
I don't know who this could be at the door
But I'm pretty sure that you got a clue
And I bet that you've been to this hotel before
Put the "you-know-what" - In the bathroom
But don't flush it down just yet
Put your pager in my suitcase
I'll get the window
You light a cigarette
It'll be like ...

Just like the old times
Living out our own kind of American dream
Old times
Your goal was always the same as mine
You didn't want to throw a fishing line in that old main stream
"No sir officer you don't understand
We're just two old friends drinkin' wine
I'm sure she is but that's not all she is
She's also an old friend of mine
I got her high school picture right here in my wallet - 1982
No sir officer no offense taken
You have a good night, too"
Good thing we didn't throw this away, baby
Turn up that radio
I'm pretty sure that cop knew what we were up to
I guess he just decided to let us go
Don't make such a thing about that picture
That was just something I kept
Don't get all sentimental on me now, girl
You haven't even told me what your new name is yet
Old times
Just like the old times
Living out our own kind of American dream
Old times
Your goal was always the same as mine
