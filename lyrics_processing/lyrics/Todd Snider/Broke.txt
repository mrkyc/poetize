Credit complications in the check out line
It's an awkward situation almost every time
They keep your card behind and they keep your groceries too
Yeah they do
You try telling everybody it's a terrible mistake
But you can tell they don't believe that's true
It's written all over you
When you're broke

I hung my head down as I walked out the door
I'm never ever going back to that store
They treated me like a bum in front of everyone behind me in line
It was all my friends and neighbors lookin' at me
Like I'd committed some kind of crime
I guess you ain't worth a dime
When you're broke

Why, if I had money like I did in my day
Just out of spite, I think I'd give it away
I thought it didn't even matter anyway
And the more I thought, the madder I got

By the time I got home I was seeing red
I pulled a gun up out from under my bed
I put a sock on my head and into the night I flew, away I flew
The next thing I know, I've got blood on my hands
But I've got money in my pockets too
You never know what you'll do until you do what you do
When you're broke
You might also like
Now, if I had money like I did in my day
I'd buy a car and drive us far away
Of course, you know I've got this debt to pay to society
Honey, wait for me

With good behavior I'll be out in seven years
Don't worry over me or shed any tears
I've learned a lot in here and I know what a chance I blew
The next time I won't make the same mistake
I'll shoot the camera out too
I'm learning all kinds of things you can do
When you're broke
When you're broke
