They named that goddamn kiss-ass Handleman
Vice President of Human Resources, or something
He stood up and made a speech about how
We would all have to work even harder now
I thought, "Harder now? Harder at what?"
I would give up anything to get up and walk out of here but

I'm stuck on the corner (Yeah yeah)
Of sanity and madness (Oh yeah)
I'm looking 'em over (Yeah yeah)
I can't see a difference (Oh yeah)
We're making money out of paper, making paper out of trees
We're making so much money we can hardly breathe

You oughta hear the shit that I get from my daughter
She says that she can't stand the sight of the car I bought her
I ruined her life forever, she don't ride a rag-top
Her and her mother spend my money pretty much nonstop
They're trying to break me for the sake of the neighborhood
They want everybody up and down the street to think we're doing good

We're stuck on the corner (Yeah yeah)
Of sanity and madness (Oh yeah)
Looking 'em over (Yeah yeah)
I can't see a difference (Oh yeah)
Making money out of paper, making paper out of trees
We're making so much money we can hardly breathe

I didn't even want to study economics
My parents made me 'cause they said it would be practical
I can't make my kid do a goddamn thing I tell him to
That kid's an unrepentant radical
He is as unimpressed by these plaques in my cubicle
As I am secretly impressed
With his ability to look at everything so completely irresponsibly

I'm stuck on the corner (Yeah yeah)
Of sanity and madness (Oh yeah)
I'm looking 'em over (Yeah yeah)
I can't see a difference (Oh yeah)
We're making money out of paper, making paper out of trees
We're making so much money we can hardly breathe

You know now I have to call that little pecker Mr. Handleman
Drove home from work as mad I had ever been and then
I nearly jerked a kid out of a drive-through window
He said, "Will that be everything?" I said "Hey, what would you know?"
"You're looking at a man about to buy his kid a rag-top
"What are you driving? A bicycle, you little punk?"

I'm stuck on the corner (Yeah yeah)
Of sanity and madness (Oh yeah)
I'm looking 'em over (Yeah yeah)
Can't see a difference (Oh yeah)
We're making money out of paper, making paper out of trees
We're making so much money we can hardly breathe
We're making so much money we can hardly breathe
