Ya I'm on my way come outside
Baby girl, you're never that mine
I lost my watch and I still found time
Uh, girl you're hot and cold, that makes you warm
Let your ex-man stay in the storm

All I ever want is more

I remember when I met you, the thought of sex was so far away
All I wanted is to talk to you
Thought it would be cool to tell me what I thought of you
You're radiant, you're vibrant
