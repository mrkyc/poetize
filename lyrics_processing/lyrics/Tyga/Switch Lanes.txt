Uhh, when I switch lanes, Phantom doors swing
Arm out the window screaming "Money ain't a thang"
Call it automatic bang, bang, bang
Call it automatic bang, bang, bang
Rari switch lanes, diamonds in my chain
Been around the world, all the hoes know my name
Call it automatic bang, bang, bang
Miss that automatic bang, bang, bang

Fuck a nigga up, Louie belt match the chucks
I'm in the club with Raww nigga, ten ratchets tucked
Back it up like a U-Haul, when cash is up
Spades in my ice bucket, rub that for luck
Racks in my cargos, Audemars stupid
Bitch say she in love with me, stay away from Cupid
The Panamera's sick, lupus
T-Raww, show them how we do it

Ahh! Swoosh sign, do it
My new bitch a nudist, peace like a buddist
Cooler than Cool Whip, give brain, don't be stupid
Faded like Boosie, cut like a crew neck
Arm out the window, 'nother check, 'nother Rolex
Mo' less, the Moet, the mo' sex, I must say
I boarded the P-jet, more than a piss test
So wake up, I'm fucked up, my ex tryna make up
See Tyga LiveGet tickets as low as $24You might also like
Break up, telling these bitches to get their cake up
Wake up, shooting my babies all on her make-up
I'm running through these hoes, Brandon Jacobs
Lambo doors up, sitting just like her legs
Skeeted off from the club, rather fuck hoes instead

Uhh, when I switch lanes, Phantom doors swing
Arm out the window screaming "Money ain't a thang"
Call it automatic bang, bang, bang
Call it automatic bang, bang, bang
Rari switch lanes, diamonds in my chain
Been around the world, all the hoes know my name
Call it automatic bang, bang, bang

Never tell a bitch I love her, money talk, Chris Tucker
Got a chauffeur and a driver, I don't lease it, I'ma buy it
Y'all be on a broke diet, you ain't eating but you biting my style
Motherfucker strike like lightning
T-Carti, my bitch like Bvlgari
I walk in the spot, all the bitches bogart me
Spent 30 racks, I'ma make it back tomorrow
Pull up with a big titty bitch like Toccara
You ain't never seen a rari, look like a safari
Tyga riding shotgun, snake print Carti-er
I'm in them Nike Airs
2500 nigga, call them Nikes rare
See them niggas hating, but I don't really care
Gold bottles coming, tell them bitches light flares
Snow on my wirst call that Roley big bear
Nigga see it in the light though (woo!) Ric Flair

Pull up at the barbershop, chop the top off the Phantom
Bitches screaming A, we ain't nowhere near Atlanta
Maybe she a rockstar, maybe she a sinner
Fucking with them lottery balls, now she a winner
I'm all in that Virginia, I mean that vagina
Get lost in that pussy, nigga you will never find me
Eat it like lasagna, eat it like E-Honda
Shout out my nigga Breezy and beat it like Rihanna
