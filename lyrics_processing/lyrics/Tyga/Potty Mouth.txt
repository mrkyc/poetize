Man, I'm with whatever, man I do it, do it better

You need to take some notes
Niggas steal my lines and say they don't
There go another new quote
I'm fresh off the boat, nigga, let's toast
Young Money real, y'all shit just a hoax
Made a fairy tale, busy on a float
Why would I lie? Forever under oath

Young D, I'm freshest nigga on the line
Better man up, it's about to go do-down
Leave you with jaw-dropped, face on the gr-ground
Let the rain fill the moats round my kingdom, carved in the cement
Star, pledge allegiance, I'ma let you leave em screaming
Screaming, screaming, dr-dreaming just to get by-by
Girl you so fly-fly, why you so high-high?

Excuse me, bitch! Please let me kill it just a little bit
And let a nigga do what he do
That movie shit, that Tec make a niggas wanna vomit spit
You niggas already knew (hoo hoo hoo)
See keep on fronting niggas then I'm lighting up another city
Got 'em fighting 'til they get to biting then we getting gritty
See the time and now a nigga climbing up another milli
Then we shining 'til a nigga blind them up until it kills me
Forth and back
I'ma digest a nigga 'til I throw up on the track
Then I'ma dissect a nigga 'til I pop off
Like we in the Wild West when I finished giving you the crack
(What?!) If you ain't knew I'm in route
To the crib just to park the Bugatti at the house
Sitting big, one of my bitches done really turn her out now
Still everyone know I got a potty mouth now
Shit, they got me doing it again
Back to bodying the things and lots of screwing other women
You can never stop the shit that I be doing and the way we moving
Get it popping, never stopping, kill em in the end now
Then I'ma get 'em to the point
When I got 'em all open, handling my business with em, ha!
Trust me, you don't wanna start cause you know it's torture!
Every single minute 'til I finish with 'em
And I knock shit down
Every time I come and then I lock shit down
Tell the commonplace niggas better drop that crown
