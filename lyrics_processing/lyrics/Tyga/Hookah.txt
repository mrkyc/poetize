And I'm havin' swag, Rollie old like a tape (woop!)
Fish scale, yeah, I got these bitches on the bait
Don't wanna talk, man, no'n to say, I need some space
Woop, woop, woop! My new car geeked up
I just paid the cop, now I'm runnin' out o' court (ooh)
Panoramic top, I'ma put it on the rocks (ooh)
Crawl, walk and hop, got all o' these bitches shocked (ayy, hey!)
Hey! Stone molly whiter than my socks (on)

Hagh! Rubbin' on my chain, blowin' Cloudmatic
Smoke somethin' with a G and bend that ass backwards
Lay back, relax, and talk mathematics
Later on, we test a little sex practice
Write my name on the wall
Money in the mattress, bet she wanna get involved
She hopped on the blunt, say, where the hookah y'all?
I tell her pass back if the shit too strong, it's all set
Mozart art on the block, so wet
I got her where I want her and I ain't done yet
Lookin' at your future, baby, put down the cigarette
Come hop on this kush jet and take flight
Yeah, tell them bitches, hm, fuck that
You with Aladdin, bet I got a magic carpet for that ass
Yes, I'm also on one, got two Olsens on me

Hagh! Bein' frank, baddies in the Benz waggin'
You know she wanna ride home, hop on the band wagon
I got the chain saggin', you know the life lavish
Lifestyles like this, gon' need Magnums
Pass, baby, welcome to rich class, baby
You all Maybelline with ya new Celine
Audemars on lean, cars on sheen
You white, girl, but black girl ghetto fly ting
It's verified, they ain't on your sea level
Watered eyes, don't cry, inhale and breathe regular
My baby on it: high at the crack of dawn, and
Body shape; figure eight, like Picasso draw ya
Oh, yes, I'm winnin', bling kingin', ring blingin'
Like-Like, for no reason, let's get closer, closed in
Remove your clothes, we close friends
Don't get choked smokin' OG Oakland
Shout out Oakland
