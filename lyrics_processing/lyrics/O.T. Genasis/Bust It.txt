My watch, I'm busting it down
My chain, I'm busting it down
Your bitch, I'm busting it down
The pistol, I'm busting it now
My watch, I'm busting it down
My chain, I'm busting it down
Your bitch, I'm busting it down
The pistol, I'm busting it now
Bust it, bust it, bust it, bust it, bust it
Bust it, bust it, bust it, bust it, bust it
Bust it, bust it, bust it, bust it, bust it
Bust it

All the shine on my wrist
Club lights got me lit
Heard she called me a trick
But she still got the dick
Double R with the tints
Grill looks like a fist
Love to ball, fuck the bench
Now I'm turnt like a wrench
Get lit, hit licks
Rich bitch
Get chips
Chain big, wrist glitter
Man they hate, got 'em mad
So what? I'ma get a bag

The pistol, I'm busting it now
My watch, I'm busting it down
My chain, I'm busting it down
Your bitch, I'm busting it down
The pistol, I'm busting it now
Bust it, bust it, bust it, bust it, bust it
Bust it, bust it, bust it, bust it, bust it
Bust it, bust it, bust it, bust it, bust it
Bust it

38 on the waist
Hold the shell, no trace
Get the fuck out my space
Before I make niggas race
Bad bitch with a bundle
Intimidate so they mumble
Move the work, don't crumble
Touchdown, no fumble
Rap, stack
Crack, trap
Map that, trap packs
Take chance, move blocks
80 racks for the watch
Wore my chain, made her squat
My watch, I'm busting it down
My chain, I'm busting it down
Your bitch, I'm busting it down
The pistol, I'm busting it now
My watch, I'm busting it down
My chain, I'm busting it down
Your bitch, I'm busting it down
The pistol, I'm busting it now
Bust it, bust it, bust it, bust it, bust it
Bust it, bust it, bust it, bust it, bust it
Bust it, bust it, bust it, bust it, bust it
