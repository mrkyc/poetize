Turn up
(The Conglomerate)

I wasn't born last night
I was born on a flight
So high, not a hater in sight
You ain't fly, you're dressed like you might be scared of heights
And you got your nerve
And since I'm in the street, my bitch better have curves (Safe)
She lookin' both ways tryna find Mr. Right (Yeah)
Thinkin' she can find him 'cause she standin' by the light
Uh, she fuckin' for the cheese, and her plan A is not to take a Plan B (Bitch)
Famous pool, Porsche, wanna pop corks (Yeah)
And bitch, you want a ring, then you should've played sports
Bitch

When a rich nigga want you
And your nigga can't do nothin' for ya
Oh, these hoes ain't loyal
Woah, these hoes ain't loyal (It's Young Ave on the beat)
Yeah-yeah, let me see (Make your cypher complete)

There's too many divas, not enough dimes
If it ain't about paper, then I ain't got time (Nah)
Money moves puttin' me ahead, so I grind (Uh-huh)
Plus I'm gettin' head, ain't no hoes on my mind
'Cause I know they ain't loyal, around 'cause I'm boiled (Hot)
Baby, you can't out-slick a can of oil (Nah)
In my DM's, on the low from your man (Uh-huh)
So when I hit that, I'ma do it for the 'Gram
Same way she'll sniff a line off my dick (Thotie)
And go, homie, you sniffin' 'round who you with (Loudie)
'Cause she your only chick so you chalk it up to nonsense
Bozo ass nigga, that's the guilt on the conscious (Ha)

(Uh-huh)
When a rich nigga want you (Yeah-yeah, want you, baby)
And your nigga can't do nothin' for ya (No, nothin', no-woah)
Oh, these hoes ain't loyal (Oh-oh-oh-oh-no)
Woah, these hoes ain't loyal (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah

Bay Area, that's where he from
The land of where these hoes nine-to-five is to be a lead-on
Broke bitches all for niggas gettin' c-notes
But all they get is autotunes, make a ho hit a g-note
You standin' at my meet and greet
But bll these hoes get is to greet my meat
She want my  so when TJ call me
I just pulled up to the house like, "Yeah, ho, yeet"
I be laughin' at these girls gettin' fame off Insta
You proud of that, girl, but you better not kiss her
Now you sittin' at home, waitin' to exhale
But you ain't want me, you are XXL (Squad)
When a rich nigga want you
And your nigga can't do nothin' for ya
Oh, these hoes ain't loyal
Woah, these hoes ain't loyal
