Yeah!
Skrt!
Turn!

Early in the morning I was chilling at the spot
Shoes on the floor coz the money in a box
Work in the kitchen coz i'm fucking with the block
30 minutes later police kicking in my spot

I'm gone make it right back
I'm gone make it right back
I'm gone make it right back
Took a loss, I'm gone make it right back
I'm gone make it right back
I'm gone make it right back
I'm gone make it right back
Took a loss, I'm gone make it right back

Pistol on the table, trap still don't got cable
Turn the pyrex to a fucking turntable
Rubber band the benjis coz I'm tryna get rich
Best stay in your lane everybody can't whip
Got a bag of loud, broke the shit down
Nigga tryna charge, too much for a pound
Running up a check, I won't even sweat it
Get down to my lab, I'm gone make it stretch

I'm gone make it right back
I'm gone make it right back
I'm gone make it right back
Took a loss, I'm gone make it right back
I'm gone make it right back
I'm gone make it right back
I'm gone make it right back
Took a loss, I'm gone make it right back

All my niggas gunning, and we sell onion
Say the wrong shit turn your body to a funyun
Gotta get the money coz I just took a loss
Bounce right back backboard that's sauce
Catch me in the trap, got one pack
Put it in the air, got one bird
Bus or the train, got one map
Throw em through the shit, like one app
Phone

I'm gone make it right back
I'm gone make it right back
I'm gone make it right back
Took a loss, I'm gone make it right back
I'm gone make it right back
I'm gone make it right back
I'm gone make it right back
