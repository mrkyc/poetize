I don't understand why niggas acting cheap. Like you don't want to spend no money. Start holding onto it nigga

I'ma go off, I'ma go off, I'ma go off, I'ma go off
Fuck that cost, I'ma boss, fuck that cost, I'ma boss
I'ma go off, I'ma go off, I'ma go off, I'ma go off
Fuck that cost, I'ma boss, fuck that cost, I'ma boss

Run that check, make that bet
Fuck these hoes, get that neck
Trick that cash, blow that shit
She gon' dance, throw that shit
Get Saks Fifth, I'm at Gucci
They bring champagne when I'm at Coochie
Valentino got me looking like I'm in the army
Got a bitch shotgun looking like a Barbie
Seeder Hills, yeah I pay for that
Heard that's your bitch, why she broke? Where your paper at
Nigga looking too fly, gotta dust me off
Money coming too fast, watch me fuck it up

I'ma go off, I'ma go off, I'ma go off, I'ma go off
Fuck that cost, I'ma boss, fuck that cost, I'ma boss
I'ma go off, I'ma go off, I'ma go off, I'ma go off
Fuck that cost, I'ma boss, fuck that cost, I'ma boss
