She had a nigga up to no good
Can't believe that I met this bitch
But else sex this bitch
Sold it out just chillin' cause we friends
Now we fuck everyday but we friends
Start buyin' up shit but we friends
And I still got a girl cause we friends
Aye, she a saucy lil bitch
Not a fuck nasty lil bitch
 and the same old shit
Her pussy better that my main bitch

That pussy gon get me in trouble

Never let a bad bitch walk pass me
Back in the days, used to be with Ashley
Yeahs later I was trippin' over Casey
Though I got the best pussy 'till I smashed it
Ridin' round town lookin' for my baby mama
Pull up the four C's  Benihana's
Always stay in some drama, she would ask me about Britney
I had to pay the fee baby
Got my phone locked down, thank you lord for the fingerprint
My girl trippin', favortie line : Never seen the bitch
Found the rubbers in my pocket can believe that she
Every night a nigga need to hit damn
