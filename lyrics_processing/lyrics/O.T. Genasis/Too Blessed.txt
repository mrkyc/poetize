Hit the kitchen, whip that rock up
You remember we was locked up
He a trusty, got his own broom
My lil nigga coming home soon
Trap through the bag
Whip through the glass
Pot on the stove
Stretch like a rag
Came in a foreign, left in a jag
Took her to the store, left with a bag
I ain't gone trip about them bills, I'm like fuck that shit
I ain't gone talk about my ex, I'm like fuck that bitch
Thank God so I pray
We done came a long way, aye aye

What kind of car I'm about to buy today?
Drunk but I'm about to get high today
Say she want to see a nigga right away
I got to fly today
Get to miles up, money pile up
All these niggas stuck
Why you wined up?
Thought it was luck, never gave up
Should have been a bag, cause I'm too clutch
Watching how these fuck niggas try to look at me
Got that 45 ain't nobody booking me
I done came a long way
Please don't make a nigga spray aye aye
