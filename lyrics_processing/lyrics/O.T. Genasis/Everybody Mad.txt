Yeah

I be gettin' to the money
Everybody mad
I think I'm gettin' too much money
Everybody mad
The same old nigga from the block
The same old nigga with the pot
The same old nigga from the trap
Everybody hatin' on him and then he bounced right back

I done spent a whole lotta time overseas
Doubling my money cause you know I want cheese
I been in my hometown playin' with the key
When it fell off the boat, yeah, I'm talkin' 'bout Belize
I know its a whole lotta niggas that was hatin'
I know its a whole lotta bitches that was taken
So I shut the niggas up, bitches feelin' us
Always knew that I was sick so I had to stay patient
Takin' over summer nigga, tell me what's the bid?
Heard you still cuffin' nigga tell me what it is?
You ain't payin' no pills, buyin' no bags, buyin' no heels
God damn let the bitch live
All I see is 20's, 50's, 100's
If it ain't quarter mil', fuck the whip
I don't wanna but to make this nigga sick to their stomach

She was acting  stingy, now she wanna give it up
Fast life, O.T. I'mma live it up
Now my ex-girl tryna make me jealous cause she got a new nigga
She don't know that I don't give a fuck
I got me a deal but I still in the street
Heard a couple niggas, talkin' like they got beef
They forgot sesame teriyaki sauce with the rice
On the side swear these pussy niggas sweet
I got all this money on my motherfuckin' mind
Diamonds in my dial I can't even see the time
All my niggas pull up, please don't let me bend the line
And they super extra winnin' niggas off the line
All I know is Bloods, Crips, Pirus
I'm a West Side nigga don't get it fucked up
Nigga sick cause they thought I lucked up
