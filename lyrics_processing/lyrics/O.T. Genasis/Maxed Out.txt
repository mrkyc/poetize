Nigga, you know I stay turnt up, nigga
If it's anything you know, nigga, you know I stay turnt up, right?
Hahahaha!

(Turn it, turn it, turn it)
(Turn it, turn it, turn it!)
I'm maxed out, I'm maxed out
I'm maxed out, I'm maxed out

I'm in the V.I.P., she said, "The big section?"
I asked the dumb bitch, "Is that a trick question?"
Word to Nick Cannon, but I been the man
Before Drumline dropped, I been having bands
She wanna shake my hand but I'm tryna rub her
Put the rubber on my slugger, word to my mother
I ain't tryna cuff 'em, man, I'm tryna cut her
All on her case like a block of butter
Got moscato in a cup and my shit subtle
Niggas ain't thugs, they some mean muggers
Hate me if you want, I'mma keep it gutter
Made the chopper sound like it fuckin' stutter

(Turn it, turn it, turn it)
(Turn it, turn it, turn it!)
I'm maxed out, I'm maxed out
I'm maxed out, I'm maxed out

SB and Genasis, since the song Friends with Benefits
You can't French lip, b-b-been a bitch
Better say my name with emphasis
Cause never will I ever really tell a girl no
Patter patter patter on my leather peacoat
Get a 4-5-6 when I roll, CeeLo
And I side toss you when I kick that door
Man, I'm pullin' in the clutch when I'm sittin' on my bike
Then I pop another Dutch when I get another like
Then I get a better shade when it's gettin' kinda bright
And I got a lot of niggas so I don't gotta fight
Oh, it's time to breathe, yeah my car sick, time to sneeze
My neck cold, time to cough, fuck Tony Danza, I'm the boss
Hoppin' out the window like I'm wearing Pink+Dolphin
All my niggas giants, I'm Tom Coughlin
Killin' these niggas, buy their coffin
I got a girl so, ho, keep walkin'
SB, LV with the checkered bag
I'm always first place, bitch, call me checkered flag

(Turn it, turn it, turn it)
(Turn it, turn it, turn it!)
I'm maxed out, I'm maxed out
I'm maxed out, I'm maxed out
I ain't a murderer but I kill a lot
You heard what I said, bitch, I killed a lot
Audi outside with a top off
Playin' catch up, I got relish, I'm a hot dog
Yeah, I said it, dawg, and I'm real tipsy
Don't say I forgot the buzz cause my bitch with me
Got my Louis belt and my Louis frames
You ain't got no Vuittons, man, them Louis frames!
Before I had out, I got my stomach full
I'm talking triple stack, drank and a Red Bull
Nigga talking shit, he better back back
Cause the Henny got me bent like a bad back

(Turn it, turn it, turn it)
(Turn it, turn it, turn it!)
I'm maxed out, I'm maxed out
