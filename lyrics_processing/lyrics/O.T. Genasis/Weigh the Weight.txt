(Bricks on the beat)

Still selling all the O's
Pyrex on the stove
Zone on the dinner plate
Fish scale, I gotta weigh the weight

I gotta weigh the weight, I gotta weigh the weight
I gotta weigh the weight, I gotta weigh the weight
I gotta weigh the weight, I gotta weigh the weight
I gotta weigh the weight, I gotta weigh the weight
I gotta weigh the weight, I gotta weigh the weight
I gotta weigh the weight, I gotta weigh the weight
I gotta weigh the weight, I gotta weigh the weight

Wrist, Rollie
Pistol, throw it
Ass, throw it
Bitch, throw it
Rack, get it
Trap, live it
Hat, fitted
Rim, (?)
Packs, got it
Car, bought it
Hate, sorry
Still hard and
Strap on me
Niggas falling
Coke armor
Drug, Tony
