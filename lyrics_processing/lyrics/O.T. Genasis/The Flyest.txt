All my life I sold coke

But it ain't no trash in 'em, no

Heard a couple niggas wanna rob me
But still ain't do shit
Fuck with me like watchin' a movie

First time I seen coke
My mama caught me in the kitchen, oh shit
I'm thinkin' like, "What you lookin' at, mama?"
I'm tryna get me a chicken, damn
Nigga said he got more money than me
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
You broke niggas lookin' funny to me
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
You ain't got it, you ain't got it
Trickin' off on all of these hoes
Well, that's a shame on you
Tryna holler at my bitch
Pop, a stain on you

I'm the flyest nigga in the world
I'm the flyest nigga in the world
I'm the flyest nigga in the world

Who you know that's better than me?
Nobody
I'm the flyest nigga in the world
