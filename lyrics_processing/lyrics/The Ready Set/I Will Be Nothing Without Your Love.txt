Sink me into this tangled web I weave
Deep-sleep, where we are safe
Where we are free

Why should I wake when there's so much at stake
I'd lose if I open my eyes?
Cause this is something bigger than we both know
Bigger and we both know
We've got the space in our hearts for something bigger
But you don't show, deny me, but you know

I will be nothing without your love
I will be nothing without your love
I will be nothing without your love
Love

I'm thinking about the way my mind translates songs
Turns them into feelings and then makes them into these thoughts Where you surround me, shimmering around me
Maybe it's your energy, either way it's astounding
I wanna live in your heart and mind
Technicolor everything, so 'imma keep my lids shut tight
Like the lines are right in between time
Time and again my hearts asking me
You might also like
Why should I wake when there's so much at stake
I'd lose if I open my eyes?
Cause this is something bigger than we both know
Bigger and we both know
We've got the space in our hearts for something bigger
But you don't show, deny me, but you know

I will be nothing without your love
I will be nothing without your love
I will be nothing without your love
Love

Magnetic since I met ya, chemical potential
And you do feel it too so you're gonna
Run with me through my city
I could take you with me
Anywhere, anywhere, anywhere
Magnetic since I met ya, chemical potential
And you do feel it too so you're gonna
Run with me through my city
I could take you with me
Anywhere, anywhere, anywhere
I will be nothing without your love
Without your love
I will be nothing without your love
I will be nothing without your love
I will be nothing without your love
