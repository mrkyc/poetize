A thin white bed
A stack of magazines unread
Three days since you've slept
In this place time crawls by
Seconds turn into a lifetime
We should cherish that

Do you know, do you know
That I am on the brink of something beautiful
So believe

I'll be here, don't you shed a single tear
Let the memories remind you how to smile
You'll feel me in the sun, it warms your skin
As your shadow I will dance with you again

Cause we don't just flicker and fade
With love, nobody's gone forever
I'll see you when you get there

Simple words in attempt to dull the hurt
I know you're trying hard
The lull of these machines
Keeping time with every heartbeat, a soliloquy
You might also like
Do you know, do you know
That I am on the brink of something beautiful
So believe

I'll be here, don't you shed a single tear
Let the memories remind you how to smile
You'll feel me in the sun, it warms your skin
As your shadow I will dance with you again

Cause we don't just flicker and fade
With love, nobody's gone forever
I'll see you when you get there
No, we don't just flicker and fade
With love, nobody's gone forever
I'll see you when you get there

I traced the word "forever" on your arm
Don't ever let that go
Trade out my broken bones for wings of gold
You'll never be alone

I'll be here, don't you shed a single tear
Let the memories remind you how to smile
You'll feel me in the sun, it warms your skin
As your shadow I will dance with you again
Cause we don't just flicker and fade
With love, nobody's gone forever
I'll see you when you get there
No, we don't just flicker and fade
With love, nobody's gone forever
I'll see you when you get there
