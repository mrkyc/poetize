I don't want to slow, slow, slow, slow down, down
(Slow down, slow down)
(Slow down, slow down)

You go for seconds and days
I live for moments to say
That I may never get a second chance
Don't throw it away
Living for dollars and dimes
They'll all diminish in time
Oh let that motion come a-crashing
Like a plane from the sky
It was a long ride down the east coast
In a city you can't keep
Could you keep up on your feet
And I was struck down by the west coast
It was a quarter to three but it don't do sleep

Follow the freeway, break the routine
'Cause everything is second to your dreams
This is the green light, take what you need
And break out of this hospital scene
You might also like
I'm running through a stop sign
Cutting out the brake lights
I don't want to slow, slow, slow, slow down, down
I'm running through a stop sign
Living so it feels right
I don't want to slow, slow, slow, slow down, down
Don't wanna slow down
(Slow down, slow down)
(Slow down, slow down)

Thought I'd give impatience a try
Got a little enveloped in time
'Cause I watch you come and watch you go
And it don't seem right
Living for speed limit signs
Ignore and cross every line
Gotta let emotion take you over twenty miles at a time

Follow the freeway, break the routine
'Cause everything is second to your dreams
This is the green light, take what you need
And break out of this hospital scene
I'm running through a stop sign
Cutting out the brake lights
I don't want to slow, slow, slow, slow down, down
I'm running through a stop sign
Living so it feels right
I don't want to slow, slow, slow, slow down, down
Don't wanna slow down

I'm running through a stop sign, got the world on my side
No brake lights, feeling more than alive
But it's so bright, city, shine on, shine on tonight, tonight
I'm running through a stop sign, got the world on my side
No brake lights, feeling more than alive
But it's so bright, city, shine on, shine on tonight, tonight
Shine on tonight

Follow the freeway, break the routine
'Cause everything is second to your dreams
This is the green light, take what you need
And break out of this hospital scene

I'm running through a stop sign
Cutting out the brake lights
I don't want to slow, slow, slow, slow down, down
I'm running through a stop sign
Living so it feels right
I don't want to slow, slow, slow, slow down, down
(Don't wanna slow down)
Stop sign, cutting out the brake lights
I don't want to slow, slow, slow, slow down, down
I'm running through a stop sign
Living so it feels right
I don't want to slow, slow, slow, slow down, down
Don't wanna slow down
