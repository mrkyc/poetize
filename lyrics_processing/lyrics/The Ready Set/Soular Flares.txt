I've been thinking that the stars are all aligned
I'm young but I am bright enough to read solar signs
So, is it cool if I call you around eight or nine?
We'll talk a real long time about the days when we're young
We're still young, we're still young, we're still-
I told you that your heart's quite big and I like it
But you were skeptical, skeptical
Oh, oh, can you feel me in the sunrise?
Or in the daytime? I like your night eyes
And you are beautiful in every single way
I would like to see your shining face everyday
If I'm lying may lightning strike me down to the ground
'Cause I don't need electric currents when you're around

I'll contrive a way to find you diamond rings
I'll sell all of my things or rob a jewellery store
(But what good could that do?)
Love is something that just can't be bought or sold
It won't come when it's told, it only comes from the soul
So do you got soul?
(Because you've got me so wrapped up, wrapped up in you)

So darling do you know, darling do you know?
Do you know how you got so lovely?
Was it self-taught, learned through life?
You've got skill, making boys go crazy
And I've been running down the stairs again
I think you're in my head, girl, I think I'm freaking out, girl
Sometimes I wonder if you're even real, if not it's cool
I don't wanna go back to the way that it was
I don't wanna go back 'cause I think I may be-
You might also like
I'll contrive a way to find you diamond rings
I'll sell all of my things or rob a jewellery store
(But what good could that do?)
Love is something that just can't be bought or sold
It won't come when it's told, it only comes from the soul

Your relationships come and go
But what makes a difference is how you take advantage of
The flirting eyes, lips and thighs
Romance and regrets, this is a shipwreck
Your relationships come and go
But what makes a difference is how you take advantage of
The flirting eyes, lips and thighs
Romance and regrets, this is a shipwreck
I'm the one who fell in love and stayed that way
I'm the one who fell in love and stayed that way
So take my advice, love with your head
Love with your heart, love with all, love with all you have

I'll contrive a way to find you diamond rings
I'll sell all of my things or rob a jewellery store
(But what good could that do?)
Love is something that just can't be bought or sold
It won't come when it's told, it only comes from the soul
