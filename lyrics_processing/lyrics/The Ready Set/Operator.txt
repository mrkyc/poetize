I miss you when you're gone
A heart without a home
Just tell me it will be okay
I need ya, can't get enough of your face
I miss the way you called
When you put me on hold
I keep the words you throw away
I want ya, but what you want from me is a chase

And then I tripped and fell in love, love, love
I will never ever be the same
Soon as we kissed
Girl, you're bad for my health
I need help, doctor

9-1-1 (What's the problem?)
She's breaking my heart for fun
(So watcha gonna do?)
I need a cure (Oh, yeah?)
A love eraser
Cause nothing I'm doing's working
9-1-1 (What's the problem?)
She loved me like a hit and run
(So watcha gonna do?)
I'm gonna run (Oh yeah?)
I'm gonna fly away
So tell me operator, how do I operate her?
You might also like
I see you in my dreams, a picture perfect theme
Exposure never comes out right
I took my time, got the focus right tonight

And then I tripped and fell in love, love, love
I will never ever be the same
Soon as we kissed
Girl, you're bad for my health
I need help, doctor

9-1-1 (What's the problem?)
She's breaking my heart for fun
(So watcha gonna do?)
I need a cure (Oh, yeah?)
A love eraser
Cause nothing I'm doing's working
9-1-1 (What's the problem?)
She loved me like a hit and run
(So watcha gonna do?)
I'm gonna run (Oh, yeah?)
I'm gonna fly away
So tell me operator, how do I operate her?
I can feel, I can feel I got no control
It's just push and pull
When will I learn that everything about that girl's bad
Tell me operator, how do I operate her?
(How do I operate, how do I operate her?)
(Doctor?)

9-1-1 (What's the problem?)
She's breaking my heart for fun
(So watcha gonna do?)
I need a cure (Oh, yeah?)
A love eraser
Cause nothing I'm doing's working
9-1-1 (What's the problem?)
She loved me like a hit and run
