Need coffee, three in the morning
Shoes are in her hands and she's on the verge of departing
Telling her friends she wanna go home
But they don't want to listen anymore
New loving, used to want it
Trying not to give up a dream that she used to covet
They got everything you could want and more
But she don't wanna party anymore, no

And the city looks so bright from far away

So I say "Hey! Hey now, brown eyes, why you out in the cold?"
(Who is gonna drive you home? Who is gonna drive you home?)
They say sad-eyes should never be alone
(Who is gonna drive you home? Who is gonna drive you home?)

Head spinning, wondering where did she get it?
The liquors filling up, how's she drowning in the sink in feeling, oh
Has she got anyone to call or know anyone here at all?
Black lipstick, smear another kiss on anyone
Who's willing to tell her that she's important and beautiful
But she don't believe it tho

(Who is gonna drive you home? Who is gonna drive you home?)
They say sad-eyes should never be alone
(Who is gonna drive you home? Who is gonna drive you home?)
Chin up, darling, you gotta take it slow
(Who is gonna drive you home? Who is gonna drive you home?)
This won't break you, you're stronger than you know
(Who is gonna drive you home? Who is gonna drive you home?)
