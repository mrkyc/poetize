I've been soaked down to the bone
At the lowest I could go
Last year I lost my sense of self
Falling apart like someone else

And she said "Ooh, ya can't live that way, can't live that way
Yeah, I've got you, yeah, I've got you"
And my head contacted a concrete floor
I never know what I'm getting in anymore, anymore

She's fire in the sky burning from inside
My supernatural high, fire in the sky
I've been dancing in the dark
But I know where the lights are
Those electrical eyes are fire in the sky
(Are fire in the sky)

When my skin don't fit the same
And all the love has gone away
How could she not want someone else?
How could she not love someone else?
You might also like
But she said "Ooh, ya can't think that way, can't think that way
Yeah, I've got you, yeah, I've got you"
And when my head contacted a concrete floor
I never know what I'm getting in anymore, anymore

She's fire in the sky burning from inside
My supernatural high, fire in the sky
I've been dancing in the dark
But I know where the lights are
Those electrical eyes are fire in the sky
(Are fire in the sky)

She said "Ooh, ya can't live that way, you can't live that way
Ooh, ya can't live that way, you can't live that way
Ooh, ya can't live that way, you can't live that way
Yeah, I've got you, yeah, I've got you

Fire in the sky burning from inside
My supernatural high, she's fire in the sky

She's fire in the sky burning from inside
My supernatural high, fire in the sky
I've been dancing in the dark
But I know where the lights are
Those electrical eyes are fire in the sky
(Are fire in the sky)
She said "Ooh, ya can't live that way, you can't live that way
Ooh, ya can't live that way, you can't live that way
Ooh, ya can't live that way, you can't live that way
