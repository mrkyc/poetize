I been picking up the pennies when I see 'em heads-up
And I don't regulate my spending, all I need is my luck

No money, me and my honey
Tryna get by on what we got to do
Oh honey, you can have money
And a top story on the evening news

I love it when the wind goes blowing through the windows
We don't gotta pay a thing
Swimming in the cash flow, you with nothing on
Makes me wanna sing

Skip all the know-how and fuck all the highbrow shit
Too pretty to die, we're doing fine
Trash talking love, trash talking love

Oh honey, look at that money
Don't believe nothing they been telling you
This season diamonds are in
Wearing millions and it's all for you
You might also like
I love it when the wind goes blowing through the windows
We don't gotta pay a thing
Swimming in the cash flow, you with nothing on
Makes me wanna sing

Skip all the know-how and fuck all the highbrow shit
Too pretty to die, we're doing fine
Trash talking love, trash talking love

Ah honey, isn't it funny
We don't need the money, I'ma let 'em outrun ya
I been picking up the pennies when I see 'em heads-up
And I don't regulate my spending, all I need is my luck

We're looking pretty in our Tiffany blue
And I don't ever have to listen if I'm sitting by you
We're never pretentious, only impressive
Fuck all your trends and fuck all your 'Benzes

Skip all the know-how, fuck all the highbrow shit
I will be fine with you in my eye-line
Trash talking love, trash talking love
Skip all the know-how and fuck all the highbrow shit
Too pretty to die, we're doing fine
Trash talking love, trash talking love
