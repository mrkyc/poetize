It's the night before Christmas and I have you on my mind
And I wish you could be here tonight
So I could kiss you, so I could hold you one more time
All the signs seem to point in your direction all the time
And it's hard for me to not just drive there, run, walk, or fly there
So I could hold you one more time

I'll be hanging mistletoe
Because I never know
When you will be here with me
For stars on the tree
I wish I could see you again

Oh, if I could choose
I would never spend another Christmas without ya
And if the fat guy in the chimney comes through
He'll give me the opportunity to unwrap ya
If I can't have you
Under my tree
Don't you wake me in the morning
Cause I don't wanna spend another Christmas without ya
I don't wanna spend another Christmas without ya
You might also like
I could bring two turtle doves and five golden rings
And some more if that would get you right here
Maybe just lay here, so I could hold you one more time

I'll be hanging mistletoe
Because I never know
When you will be here with me
For stars on the tree
I wish I could see you again

Oh, if I could choose
I would never spend another Christmas without ya
And if the fat guy in the chimney comes through
He'll give me the opportunity to unwrap ya
If I can't have you
Under my tree
Don't you wake me in the morning
Cause I don't wanna spend another Christmas without ya
Without you
Without you
Under my tree, under my tree, under my tree
Oh, if I could choose
I would never spend another Christmas without ya
And if the fat guy in the chimney comes through
He'll give me the opportunity to unwrap ya
Oh, if I could choose
I would never spend another Christmas without ya
And if the fat guy in the chimney comes through
He'll give me the opportunity to unwrap ya
If I can't have you
Under my tree
Don't you wake me in the morning
Cause I don't wanna spend another Christmas without ya
