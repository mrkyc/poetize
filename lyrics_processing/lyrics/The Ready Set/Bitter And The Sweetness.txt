Troublemaker look on your face
Followed by a smile and I melt away
It ain't always been this lovely
We turn to ice and start a fire, melt away

It don't happen overnight
It's laughing after fights
Knowing which song I should sing to make you smile again
Your favorite flowers
How I know before you say "It's gonna be okay"

Love, I think we got time to make mistakes
Bitter and the sweetness, I just love the taste
Like the time we got stuck out in the rain
When you took my hand, said "Baby, we should stay"

You give me trouble in the best way
When you let your hair down I can't look away
You've just always been that lovely
We turn the darkness into light

It don't happen overnight
It's laughing after fights
Knowing which song I should sing to make you smile again
Your favorite flowers
How I know before you say "It's gonna be okay"
You might also like
Love, I think we got time to make mistakes
Bitter and the sweetness, I just love the taste
Like the time we got stuck out in the rain
When you took my hand, said "Baby, we should stay"

Troublemaker, oh
I cannot play her one I wrote
A couple chords, little verse
Something simple, make it work
You'll be staying close

Love, I think we got time to make mistakes
Bitter and the sweetness, I just love the taste
Like the time we got stuck out in the rain
When you took my hand, said "Baby, we should stay"

Got time to make mistakes (We got time)
Bitter and the sweetness I just love the taste (Oh, I love the taste)
Like the time we got stuck out in the rain (Stuck in the rain)
When you took my hand, said "Baby, we should stay"
(We should stay)
(Stay, yeah, woah)
(We should stay, stay, stay, stay yeah)
