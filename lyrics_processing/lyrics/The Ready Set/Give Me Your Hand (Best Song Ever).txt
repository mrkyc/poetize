Dressed in your Friday best and ready to impress
Oh whoa, I like the show, oh-oh
And can I say that you're the prettiest girl that I know
Or will ever know

So give me your hand
I got a record on the table
And I think it's gonna, gonna make you wanna let go
An opportunity to get a little wild, baby
Can I get a smile, smile, damn, I hope so
Now we're turning up the heat
Turn the shuffle to repeat, to repeat, to repeat, to repeat

She said, "I love this song
I've heard it before, and it stole my heart
I know every word"
She's gonna dance all night, night 'til it hurts
Singing the best song ever, best song ever

Give me your hand!
Give me your hand!
She said, "This is the best song ever, best song ever."
You might also like
Music colliding with the words singing what you wanna say
I hope it's my name, hey, hey
And every time you hear it you'll remember this night again
Again and again

So give me your hand
Cause I'm ready and I'm able
And I'm thinking I can make you finally wanna let go
Just to show you my affection
Turn the speakers up to ten and then eleven
'Til we break the windows
Now we're turning up the heat
Turn the shuffle to repeat, to repeat, to repeat, to repeat

She said, "I love this song
I've heard it before, and it stole my heart
I know every word"
She's gonna dance all night, night 'til it hurts
Singing the best song ever, best song ever

Give me your hand!
Give me your hand!
She said, "This is the best song ever, best song ever."
We're not coming down, you're all mine
Keep you in the sound, we're so high
Rocket to cloud nine when we're turning up the best song ever
Best song ever

She said, "I love this song
I've heard it before, and it stole my heart
I know every word"
She's gonna dance all night, night 'til it hurts
Singing the best song ever, best song ever! (Give me your hand)
She said, "I love this song
I've heard it before, and it stole my heart
I know every word"
She's gonna dance all night, night 'til it hurts
Singing the best song ever, best song ever

Give me your hand!
Give me your hand!
