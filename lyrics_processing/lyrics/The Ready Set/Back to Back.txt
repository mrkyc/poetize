My mind has left the building and I shouldn't be speaking
But now I can so I will, and I'll tell you the truth
I said these terrible things that she's done to me
Tend to creep into my dreams and it's impossible to sleep
To my left is a beauty, sleeping beauty, yeah she's pretty
But-but now I'm quickly finding out that looks can be deceiving
And I'd say to her face, but I'd miss the taste
Of blood in my mouth when she is knocking me out

I hit rock bottom, have I sold my soul?
I don't wanna-wanna know

I'm gonna fall back-to-back-to-back in love with you
I'll take the black and blues, I've got everything to lose
I'm gonna fall back to back to back in love with you
What else can I do? Oh, yeah, everything that I should lose

Everything I gotta lose
Everything I gotta lose

The arrow missed, oh, the mark and now I'm finally finding out Having doubts, she's been bringing me down
It's been a terrible dry spell
The last time the rain fell we had only met
And this was prior to our day going out
You might also likeBetter get her, wish I never met her
But I did so I do everything and it's clear
That I could treat her so greatly, she seems to hate me
Head in the clouds, I let her knock me out

I hit rock bottom, have I sold my soul?
I don't wanna-wanna know

I'm gonna fall back-to-back-to-back in love with you
I'll take the black and blues, I've got everything to lose
I'm gonna fall back to back to back in love with you
What else can I do? Oh, yeah, everything that I should lose

Everything I gotta lose
Everything I gotta lose

It's time to leave here and stop pretending
That it's worth mending, yeah
It's time to let my love break free, whoa
It's time to take my heart in my own hands
In my own hands, yeah
Cause you were all I never need
But I will fall fall back-to-back-to-back in love with you
I'll take the black and blues, I've got everything to lose
Back-to-back-to-back in love with you
I'll take the black and blues, I've got everything to lose
I'm gonna fall back to back to back in love with you
What else can I do? Oh, yeah, everything that I should lose

Everything I gotta lose
Everything I gotta lose
