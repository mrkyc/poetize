She walks on the air I breathe tonight
She don't care if I stay or I leave her side

Kisses her friends and says "don't you love me?"
I said "I do", she thought that was funny
Two for the road, she love getting money
Key on the dash, she said "keep it running"

Rose gold, when did it get cold
Why did I ever wait in the car?
Black clothes, you're an indigo
Breaking into the gallery bar

La vie en rose, where did you go?
La vie en rose, where did you go?
Where did you go?

Ten blocks never felt so far away
Small-talk, but it meant so much to say

Kisses her friends and says "don't you love me?"
I said "I do", she thought that was funny
Two for the road, a bag full of honey
Key on the dash, she said "keep it running"

Rose gold, when did it get cold
Why did I ever wait in the car?
Black clothes, you're an indigo
Breaking into the gallery bar

La vie en rose, where did you go?
La vie en rose, where did you go?
Where did you go?

Living her whole life in pink
She don't have the time for no-one like me
Living her whole life in pink (la vie en rose, bag full of honey)
She don't have the time for no one like me
(key on the dash, she said)
"Keep it running"

Rose gold, when did it get cold
(Kisses her friends and says "don't you love me?")
Why did I ever wait in the car?
(I said "I do", she thought that was funny)
Black clothes, you're an indigo
(Two for the road, a bag full of honey)
Breaking in to the gallery bar
(Key on the dash, she said "keep it running")
La vie en rose
(Kisses her friends and says "don't you love me?")
Where did you go?
(I said "I do", she thought that was funny)
La vie en rose
(Two for the road, a bag full of honey)
Where did you go? Where did you go?
(Key on the dash, she said "keep it running")

La vie en rose, where did you go?
La vie en rose, where did you go?
