Assuming I know that people around are moving to downtown
They're learning to get down, whoa
And let me say here - I'm glad that they lost their fears;
I'm glad that they cut their tears, cause I'm over that

And change can run around your head
Kill your thoughts instead;
Leaving you spinning around and all out of control
And lately, oh, it's amazing, I'm not letting it phase me;
But I'm feeling alive tonight
(Will you let me shine?)
Whoa...

You spelled my name
When I was young, I need you right there;
And you ran so fast, so fast
You stayed the same
Oh Melody, I hope that you care, you care, you care, you care

Girls on the West Coast, sing it like you used to
Boys on the East Coast, scream with some heart

Six years, (six years) and I'm learning about the darker side
I'm getting a feel for the faster life - I took sides
Long nights (long nights) and the drives we made through
Oh, what I did for you, well, it took some time
(Can I live my dream?)
It took some time

You spelled my name
When I was young, I need you right there;
And you ran so fast, so fast
You stayed the same
Oh Melody, I hope that you care, you care, you care, you care

And I'll never see the world without you
And I'm all about how it's gonna be
And I'm all about how it's gonna be (I can't complain, I can't complain)
You opened up the world around me, me, me
I couldn't have made it through
I'm counting all my debts in my head, in my head
And I'll always be radio

You spelled my name
When I was young, I need you right there;
And you ran so fast, so fast
You stayed the same
Oh Melody, I hope that you care, you care, you care, you care
Girls on the West Coast, sing it like you used to!
Boys on the East Coast, scream with some heart!
I'll write a song to remember where I came from
