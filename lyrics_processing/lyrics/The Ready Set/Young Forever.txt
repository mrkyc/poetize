We-we'll be young forever
We-we'll be young forever

We could be like prisoners
Yeah, and we could be alone
Or we could make a mess
Like no one knows and risk it on our own
Spending the money that we don't have
'Cause we don't care, uh-oh
Living like kings with broken strings
And bass down to the floor

Living with our headphones up
We've got sound and that's enough
Nobody can touch us and we run
And we run, and we run

Hey, hey, we'll be young forever
We'll be young forever till forever stops
We're singing hey-hey, we'll be on forever
Tonight will last forever till our bodies drop, drop, drop, drop
You might also likeWe can run through the night
Write our name up in the sky
Got the music on our side
Ain't nobody gonna catch us
Singing hey-hey, we'll be young forever
On the run forever and we'll never stop
(Don't stop, don't stop now)

Look at us, look at us
We'll take the whole world by surprise
Million dollar mindset in place
You can see it in our eyes
Everything here is ours to take
So come and take your side
Living like kings with broken strings
And the bass so synthesized

We can turn the speakers up
'Cause we've got sound and that's enough
Nobody can touch us and we run
And we run, and we run

Hey, hey, we'll be young forever
We'll be young forever till forever stops
We're singing hey-hey, we'll be on forever
Tonight will last forever till our bodies drop, drop, drop, drop
We can run through the night
Write our name up in the sky
Got the music on our side
Ain't nobody gonna catch us
Singing hey-hey, we'll be young forever
On the run forever and we'll never stop
(Don't stop, don't stop now)

We're gonna rule the world tonight
The beat of the drums keeps us alive
Tonight will last forever till our bodies drop

Hey, hey, we'll be young forever
We'll be young forever till forever stops
(Don't stop, don't stop now)
We're singing hey-hey, we'll be on forever
Tonight will last forever till our bodies drop, drop, drop, drop
We can run through the night
Write our name up in the sky
We can run, run, run away
Nobody gonna catch us
Singing hey-hey, we'll be young forever
On the run forever and we'll never stop
(Don't stop, don't stop now)
Run, run, run away
