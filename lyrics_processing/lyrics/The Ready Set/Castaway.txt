I heard you say that you were writing a diary
Of a nobody and the pages burn right through
If you want you can always talk to me, talk to me, yeah
Cause I've got time for you

Do you feel you're not enough
And impossible to love
Or like if you spoke your mind
All your words, they would be too much?
Well I'll be with you in the dark
And give you light when you're afraid
Like a billion shining stars

Everyone is a castaway
Everyone is a castaway
Everyone is a castaway

Well I stepped back from the doubts overtaking me
They were breaking me, so I know what you've been through
Don't you stray or run away from the good that I know you do
I saved myself, and I can save you too
You might also like
Do you feel you're not enough
And impossible to love
Or like if you spoke your mind
All your words, they would be too much?
Well I'll be with you in the dark
And give you light when you're afraid
Like a billion shining stars

Everyone is a castaway
Everyone is a castaway
Everyone is a castaway
Everyone is a castaway
Everyone is a castaway
Everyone is a castaway

Jake Miller, yeah
Everybody is a castaway, everybody's in the same boat
Yeah it's easy to sink when you're all alone
But together we can stay afloat
Sometimes it feels like you're 'bout to go under
And you're lost in the world, no wonder
But even when you feel like you've got nothing
Remember that we've got each other
So just stand tall and keep pushing on
And we can make it to the shore, I promise
You might feel small but together we B-I-G, Christopher Wallace
So when the water gets rough and you're fed up
Just stay strong, keep your head up, if you start to fall
Remember that we'll always be here to help you get up
'Cause we're all castaways
Do you feel you're not enough
And impossible to love
Or like if you spoke your mind
All your words, they would be too much?
Well I'll be with you in the dark
And give you light when you're afraid
Like a billion shining stars

Everyone is a castaway
Everyone is a castaway
Everyone is a castaway
Everyone is a castaway
