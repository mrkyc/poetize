The more I get, the less I want it
"The best is yet to come", or so they say
Well my head's like:
"I could do better, I should feel better" (So tell me)
"When's it gonna let up?" (Woah-oh)

She said "Boy you better slow down, take it in
You toss and then you turn until you break and bend"
Blackout in the blue, it starts again
Now that night's been stuck in my head

Are we happy now? Yes, no, guess again
I get everything I want, then I'm over it
So remind me what I got so I don't forget
I know I gotta smile but I haven't yet
Are we happy then? Yes, no, guess again
Guess again

The stars I catch, are always fadin'
Am I the only one to see it?
Should I listen to my heart when my head's like:
"I could do better, I should feel better." (So tell me)
"When's it gonna let up?" (Woah-oh)
