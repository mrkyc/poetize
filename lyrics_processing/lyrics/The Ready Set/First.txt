It's never what you say it is
And you're so bad at hiding it
When she talks I know you're listening
(When she talks I know you're listening)

So show me how you ache
Show me how you wanna watch my heart break
Breathing in my words
Like I'll be the one to make your lungs burn

But I can't, but I can't, but I can't cause I loved her first
I loved her first, yeah
And I know, and I know, and I know, and I know it hurts
You want me to only come around when you're lonely, but
But I can't, but I can't, but I can't cause I loved her first
(First, first, first)
(But I can't, but I can't, but I can't cause I loved her-)

A foolish game, a foolish kid
No subtleties involved with it
With those lips no sense bothering, love
You might also like
Tell me what you want
Half the fight is knowing it can't be won, ooh
Breathing in my words
Like I'll be the one to make your lungs burn

But I can't, but I can't, but I can't cause I loved her first
I loved her first, yeah
And I know, and I know, and I know, and I know it hurts
You want me to only come around when you're lonely, but
But I can't, but I can't, but I can't cause I loved her first
(First, first, first)
(But I can't, but I can't, but I can't cause I loved her first)

I have no place in your arms
You've got no place in mine
And that is why you want to see me hurt

But I can't, but I can't, but I can't cause I loved her first
I loved her first, yeah
And I know, and I know, and I know, and I know it hurts
You want me to only come around when you're lonely, but
But I can't, but I can't, but I can't cause I loved her first
(First, first, first)
I loved her first
I loved her first
I loved her first
