Hey, I'd like to stay a little longer
Though I wouldn't want to come off like a hope-monger and-
Hey, ain't it strange when you get the joke the next day?

Well we danced alone
While everyone cashed out
Told me that you insist
And we got the last song stuck in our heads
It goes a little like this:

Blame it on the wine, the night
We were talkin' till dawn
Like that, you had me down for the count
Never thought you'd make a move out of the blue
I love the way you're freakin' me out

Oh, I love the way
I love the way you're freakin' me out

Hey, I bet they never saw it coming
Thinking "What could be the harm in passin' out with shoes on?"
Strange, all those films from the 80s end this way
You might also like
Where we danced alone
While everyone cashed out
Come on now, I insist
And we'll get the last song stuck in our heads
It goes a little like this:

Blame it on the wine, the night
We were talkin' till dawn
Like that, you had me down for the count
Never thought you'd make a move out of the blue
I love the way you're freakin' me out

Oh, I love the way
I love the way you're freakin' me out
Oh, I love the way
I love the way you're freakin' me out

So don't stop, don't stop
Ooh, you caught me off-guard
Don't stop, I love the way, the way you don't stop
Don't stop, ooh, you caught me off-guard
Don't stop, I love the way you're freakin' me out
Dancing alone while everyone's cashed out
Come on now, I insist
And we'll get the last song stuck in our heads
It goes a little like this:

Blame it on the wine, the night
We were talkin' till dawn
Like that, you had me down for the count
Never thought you'd make a move out of the blue
I love the way you're freakin' me out

Oh, I love the way
I love the way you're freakin' me out (freakin' me out)
Oh, I love the way
I love the way you're freakin' me out

I love the way you're freakin' me out
