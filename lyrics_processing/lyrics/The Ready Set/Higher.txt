This feeling can't be wrong
Like it's so good it hurts
I've never heard this song
But it's like I know the words
Woke up in a dream that I had a thousand times
Held on real tight

Now I got what I need to survive
When it feels, like all the walls
Are caving in, it's okay we can let 'em fall
Climb on top and we'll get higher, higher
Get on top and take it higher
Never wake me up

We can watch this world spin from above
Both eyes shut tight, don't wake me up
If it's in my head that's real enough
Oh, oh, oh

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Now we're swingin' from the stars we were reachin' for
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Yeah, we're swingin' from the stars
And never wake me up
You might also like
Can't find a way to say
Without a thousand words
One spark is all it takes
Light a flame and let it burn
And if it's a dream, I don't want to leave it yet
Give it all I got
Look around, take it in, don't forget

When it feels like all the walls
Are caving in, it's okay, we can let 'em fall
Climb on top and we'll get higher, higher
Get on top and take it higher
Never wake me up

We can watch this world spin from above
Both eyes shut tight, don't wake me up
If it's in my head that's real enough
Oh, oh, oh

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Now we're swingin' from the stars we were reachin' for
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Yeah we're swingin' from the stars
And never wake me up
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Now we're swinging from the stars we were reachin' for
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Yeah, we're swinging from the stars
And never wake me up
We've got it all, so let 'em fall
Let your walls fall down
We've got it all, so let 'em fall
Let your walls fall down
We've got it all, so let 'em fall
Let your walls fall down
We've got it all, so let 'em fall
Let your walls fall down

We can watch this world spin from above
Both eyes shut tight, don't wake me up
If it's in my head it's real enough
Oh, oh, oh

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Now we're swinging from the stars we were reachin' for
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Yeah, we're swinging from the stars
And never wake me up
And never wake me up
And never wake me up

We can watch this world spin from above
Both eyes shut tight, don't wake me up
If it's in my head it's real enough
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Now we're swingin' from the stars we were reachin' for
Ooh, ooh, ooh
