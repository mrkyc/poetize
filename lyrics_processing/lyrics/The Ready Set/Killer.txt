Stuck in a limbo (Here we go)
Me and my sins go (Toe to toe, oh-oh-oh)
I played a vicious part (Whoa)
I've broke an unfair share of hearts
I'm about to blow
So if you come around then you should know

I'll tear you up in two
Go ahead, walk it off if you know what's best for you
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

I'm no good for you (No)
This heart ain't built for two, so
Run away, run away
'Cause I'm no, I'm no, I'm no good for you
I'm no good for you (No)
Bet on love and I'll bet you lose, so
Run away, run away
'Cause I'm no, I'm no, I'm no good for you

I'm a, I'm a, I'm a love killer
I'm a, I'm a, I'm a love killer
I'm a, I'm a, I'm a killer
You might also like
Lower than real low (Here we go)
Take your heart like a repo (No, no, no-o-o)
You dug yourself into (Whoa-oh)
A pretty mess that I made for you
I've a lot to show
For the time you're gonna lose by the time I go

I'll tear you up in two
Go ahead, walk it off if you know what's best for you
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

I'm no good for you (No)
This heart ain't built for two, so
Run away, run away
'Cause I'm no, I'm no, I'm no good for you
I'm no good for you (No)
Bet on love and I'll bet you lose, so
Run away, run away
'Cause I'm no, I'm no, I'm no good for you

I'm a, I'm a, I'm a love killer
I'm a, I'm a, I'm a love killer
I'm a, I'm a, I'm a killer
Bootleg emotions
Bottled up explosions
Intoxicating you
Learning of the truth
I'm your seventh sin
Exiting through your skin
Intoxicating you
Ninety-seven proof

I'm no good for you (No)
This heart ain't built for two, so
Run away, run away
'Cause I'm no, I'm no, I'm no good for you
I'm no good for you (No)
Bet on love and I'll bet you lose, so
Run away, run away
'Cause I'm no, I'm no, I'm no good for you

I'm a, I'm a, I'm a love killer
I'm a, I'm a, I'm a love killer
