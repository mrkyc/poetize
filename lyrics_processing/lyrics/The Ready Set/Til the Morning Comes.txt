Wanna talk it over, over?
I'm coming over, over
I'm near the edge
Cuz you been throwing, throwing
Your dirty laundry from him on me again

Gonna give you one more second chance
If it don't work then we're just friends
But we both know how that shit ends
Don't wanna let it burn like that

If you want to show the real you
Nothing but the whole truth
I'mma wait up (I'mma wait up, I'mma wait up)
With you till the darkness turns to
Early morning June gloom
I'mma wait up (I'mma wait up, I'mma wait up)

Till the morning comes
Till the morning comes, comes, comes
Till the morning comes
Till the morning comes, comes, comes

Till the morning comes, comes, comes, comes
