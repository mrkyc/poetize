(Yeah)

God I love how it looks so sweet
Do I get another chance to taste it?
I've been dreaming of broken teeth
Cold sweat, vision blurred and faded
There's a ghost standing next to me
In the dark I saw my own reflection
It was nothing like it used to be
False start, losing my direction

Fearing the sun would never come to the shadow of who I was
Wishing on empty stars to bring me back together

I'm in the place where you found me
I hid away trying to chase down gold
But I became my surroundings, yeah
She said "Your disappearing act is getting old"
I'm in the place where you found me
I hid away trying to chase down gold
But I became my surroundings, yeah
She said "Your disappearing act is getting old"

Running out of my disillusion
Running out of my disillusion

And I know that I will get back up
But does it really matter what we're saying?
Here at the bottom of a plastic cup
Where we forget all that we loved and we hated

I learned the sun will always rise
Here's to the ones with hazy eyes
Swinging from empty stars, falling down together

I'm in the place where you found me
I hid away trying to chase down gold
But I became my surroundings, yeah
She said "Your disappearing act is getting old!"
I'm in the place where you found me
I hid away trying to chase down gold
But I became my surroundings, yeah
She said "Your disappearing act is getting old"
Running out of my disillusion
Running out of my disillusion

Everybody wants a savior, but there's no saints to see
If you want it just grow ten-feet-tall
And take all that you need
We are not hollow projections on a blurry T.V. screen
I'm not scared to fall, no not at all
The sky belongs to me
The sky belongs to me
(Kat)

I'm in the place where you found me
I hid away trying to chase down gold
But I became my surroundings, yeah
She said "Your disappearing act is getting old!"
I'm in the place where you found me
I hid away trying to chase down gold
But I became my surroundings, yeah
She said "Your disappearing act is getting old"

Running out of of my disillusion
Running out of of my disillusion
(Guess the disappearing act is getting old)
(Guess the disappearing act is getting old)
