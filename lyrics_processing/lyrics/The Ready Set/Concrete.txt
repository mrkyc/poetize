Mornings built on bad nights
Those conversations led to vacations I needed
Systematic meltdown
The situation, we need to face it

Melodramatic, or maybe you're manic
I'm sympathetic, accepting you for every flaw
At least I tried to see the world through your eyes

(It's like I'm dancing with)
Concrete strapped to my feet
Tossed out into the sea
Why you gotta scream at me
When everyone is listening (Yeah-ah)
Calm down, you're waving that gun too fast
You've got to breathe
How am I gonna talk to you?
When I'm wearing bricks for shoes, yeah

C-o-n-c-r-e-t-e-e
C-o-n-c-r-e-t-e-e
C-o-n-c-r-e-t-e-e
R-e-t-e-e
You might also like
Cling on tight to loose-ends
Claim that I frayed them, when I tried to save them
I couldn't do it
Vodka-tonic freak out
Is twenty really that tiring?
'Cause lately you're spiraling down

Melodramatic, or maybe you're manic
I'm sympathetic, accepting you for every flaw
At least I tried to see the world through your eyes

(It's like I'm dancing with)
Concrete strapped to my feet
Tossed out into the sea
Why you gotta scream at me
When everyone is listening (Yeah-ah)
Calm down, you're waving that gun too fast
You've got to breathe
How am I gonna talk to you?
When I'm wearing bricks for shoes, yeah

C-o-n-c-r-e-t-e-e
C-o-n-c-r-e-t-e-e
C-o-n-c-r-e-t-e-e
R-e-t-e-e
And tell me when we'll get this, when we'll get this off the ground
Feels like never (Never)
I'll be spending my nights, spending my nights on the town
No sleep ever (Ever)

(It's like I'm dancing with)
Concrete strapped to my feet
Tossed out into the sea
Why you gotta scream at me
When everyone is listening (Yeah-ah)
Calm down you're waving that gun too fast
You've got to breathe
How am I gonna talk to you?
When I'm wearing bricks for shoes, yeah

C-o-n-c-r-e-t-e-e
C-o-n-c-r-e-t-e-e
C-o-n-c-r-e-t-e-e
