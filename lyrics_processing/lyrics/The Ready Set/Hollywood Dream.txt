She's a Hollywood dream
Straight from an A-list movie scene
Living the camera life
Oh, she is the queen of Rodeo Drive
I am a Midwest boy
Straight from a small town with a voice
Screaming, I want her with me
She could be the hills to my Beverly
My Beverly

She's a beautiful ray of social light
A paparazzi flash on a Friday night
She got me talking kinda fast like I'm on the fly
I gotta get her here, oh-oh
On the front of magazines the world over
I'm looking at her pretty face at every turn
Loving the way she drives that Range Rover
She's independent, oh-oh

Ce-ele-ebrity, come and be with me
Ce-ele-ebrity, come and be with me
'Cause I really think you might like my style
Take a break, get away for a while
Don't got a lot but I got a smile
I'd like to show you
You might also like
She's a Hollywood dream
Straight from an A-list movie scene
Living the camera life
Oh, she is the queen of Rodeo Drive
I am a Midwest boy
Straight from a small town with a voice
Screaming, I want her with me
She could be the hills to my Beverly
My Beverly

What do I gotta do to be your everything?
What do I gotta do to make her notice me?
Everybody knows her name
But I wanna be worth more than fame
I'm staring out into a crowd
But I'm without the one thing that I need right now
So come be my good feeling, oh

Ce-ele-ebrity, come and be with me
Ce-ele-ebrity, come and be with me
'Cause I really think you might like my style
Take a break, get away for a while
Don't-don't-don't know you but I know you drive me wild
I've got designer dreams
She's got designer shades
Can't look away from her magnetic gaze
Killing me slowly when her lips are talking
When I untie my t-t-tongue I swear I'll say

Pretty girl, pretty girl
Would you trade LA to come into my world?
Couldn't ask for nothing more
City girl, tell me, could you fall in love with-

A Midwest boy
Straight from a small town with a voice
Screaming, I want her with me
She could be the hills to my Beverly
My Beverly

She's a Hollywood dream
My Beverly
I want her with me
