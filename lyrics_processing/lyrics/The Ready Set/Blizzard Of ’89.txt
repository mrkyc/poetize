We welcome winter's wind, the colors of our bones
Will you collect me and compound?
And clear your mind before the ground gets cold
Embers in air (I know it's hard when you're alone)
The wind in your hair
If you were a snowflake, impossibly I'd be the same shape as you
Spilled coffee in the mornings, you still adore me
And that's what I love about the cold nights
'Cause your jacket fits me, just my size

Baby, love is like the holidays
And everyone's here, and this is sincere
Check that list you made for Christmas day
'Cause I've been on the rooftop all night
Giving out gifts to the world so every boy and girl
Can feel the way that I do, every time I see you

And it's these subtle things that make our spirit's warm
And it's the comfort of carols sung and ribbons hung
And Christmas lights on distant back-road drives
Embers in air, you know it's hard being so far
And so far it's a test of strength
But all it takes is a moment sitting by your side
You might also likeCome morning when I wake up, you fix your makeup
Lighting the fire up all night, we'll drink hot chocolate
We'll sing and sigh

Baby, love is like the holidays
And everyone's here, and this is sincere
Check that list you made for Christmas day
'Cause I've been on the rooftop all night
Giving out gifts to the world so every boy and girl
Can feel the way that I do, every time I see you

I'm coming home to the Midwest
Chasing down winter wonderlands
You take your poinsettia, you tell me what is better
Than being home and right by your side?
I'm driving home but the ice storm
Is making this a test of strength and time
Miracles real tonight, the feeling's right
The decorations fall into place

Baby, love is like the holidays
And everyone's here, and this is sincere
Check that list you made for Christmas day
'Cause I've been on the rooftop all night
Giving out gifts to the world so every boy and girl
Can feel the way that I do, every time I see you
Baby, love is like the holidays
And everyone's here, and this is sincere
Check that list you made for Christmas day
'Cause I've been on the rooftop all night
Giving out gifts to the world so every boy and girl
