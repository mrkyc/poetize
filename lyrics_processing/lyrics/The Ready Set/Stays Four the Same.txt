I could've wrote down
Every thought I've been thinking to myself all this past year
But would it stand out?
Whoa, I wanna make myself clear
And, baby, clearly
I need some balance in my ears right now
'Cause I've been freaking myself out
And I've been waking this whole town

And then I turned myself inside out
La-da-da-da-da, and it's all about
The way your hips move side to side
Left to right, guide me home tonight

And I need a little more thunder
A little more lightning, a little more you
Be my lantern, help me shine on through

So I said I
I gotta comb my brain for the words to say
And if it don't feel right then it's a wasted night
The price to pay is so, so high
And the irony could be cut with a knife
'Cause its my first chance
But it's my last chance, alright?

And then I turned myself inside out
La-da-da-da-da, and it's all about
The way your hips move side to side
Left to right, guide me home tonight

And I need a little more thunder
A little more lightning, a little more you
Be my lantern, help me shine on through
Baby, well I gotta have you loving me tonight
And when my world has become a whirlwind
Will you be my white flag?

Speed it up like, sugar I'm a wreck
And you know-know that I can't do a thing about it, about it
Break it down, I'm on my knees
Baby take another chance, oh please
I'm affordable, I'm trainable
When you're taking me out, I'm taking you in
Speed it up like, sugar I'm a wreck
And you know-know that I can't do a thing about it, about it
Break it down, I'm on my knees
Baby take another chance, oh please
I'm affordable, I'm trainable
When you're taking me out, I'm taking you in
I gotta migrate a catastrophe
I stood strong, it was the best for me
My town is irrela-relevant
My blue-eyes match my green lies
Yeah!

And I need a little more thunder
A little more lightning, a little more you
Be my lantern, help me shine on through
And I need a little more thunder
A little more lightning, a little more you (give me more)
Be my lantern, help me shine on through
Baby, well I gotta have you loving me tonight
And when my world has become a whirlwind
