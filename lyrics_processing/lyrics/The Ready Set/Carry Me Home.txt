I feel on top of the world
Across the bar saw my ex-best-girl
I might make a move, I might make amends
So I told her this:

"I've got a lot on my mind and
Got you a drink if you'd like to go
Baby let's roll, can I come home?"

Then she said:
"Shut up, don't you speak
You do this to me every week
And I won't carry you home, carry you home"
Oh, girl you got me so fucked up
That I could run around the world
But I won't, so carry me home, carry me home

Saying words, don't know what they mean
But I know you belong with me
I think I better slow down, slow it down (La-da-da-da-da, or nah)

She's like: "Don't come around"
And I should just be alone
I know you're making a joke
I'm comin' back home
You might also like
Then she said:
"Shut up, don't you speak
You do this to me every week
And I won't carry you home, carry you home"
Oh, girl you got me so fucked up
That I could run around the world
But I won't, so carry me home, carry me home

La-da-da, da-da-da, da-da
La-da-da, da-da-da, da-da
Carry me home, carry me home

Love-struck, I'm oblivious, oh yes, you know, oh
For you I don't mind makin' a fool of myself
Oh no-oh-oh, it goes a lot like this:

I've got plans and a feeling
It's no ordinary evening
No, I'm on a roll, I'm coming back home

Then she said:
"Shut up, don't you speak
You do this to me every week
And I won't carry you home, carry you home"
Oh, girl you got me so fucked up
That I could run around the world
But I won't, so carry me home, carry me home
La-da-da, da-da-da, da-da
La-da-da, da-da-da, da-da
Carry me home, carry me home
La-da-da, da-da-da, da-da
La-da-da, da-da-da, da-da
Carry me home, carry me home

(Then she said)
"Shut up, don't you speak
You do this to me every week
And I won't carry you home, carry you home"
(Oh, girl you) got me so fucked up
That I could run around the world
But I won't, so carry me home, carry me home
But I won't, so carry me home, carry me home
