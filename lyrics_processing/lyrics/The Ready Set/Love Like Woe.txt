(J-J-J-J-J-R)
Wo-oh, oh-oh ooh
Wo-oh, oh-oh ooh
I kinda feel like it don't make
Like-like-like it don't make
Feel like it don't make s-s-s-s-sense

I'm thinking baby you and I are undeniable
But I'm findin' out love's unreliable
I'm giving all I got to make you stay
Or am I just a roadblock in your way?
'Cause you're a pretty little windstorm
Out on the boulevard
Something like a sunset
Oh, you're a shooting star
And I might drive myself insane
If those lips aren't speaking my name

'Cause I've got some intuition or maybe I'm superstitious
But I think you're a pretty sweet pill that I'm swallowing down
To counter this addiction
You got me on a mission
Tell me darling can I get a break some-
How could I say no?

She's got a love like woe
(Wo-oh, oh-oh ooh)
Girl's got a love like woe
(Wo-oh, oh-oh ooh, la-da-dah)
I kinda feel like it don't make sense
'Cause you're bringing me in and now you're kicking me out again
Love so strong, then you moved on (Wo-oh, oh-oh ooh, wo-oh, oh-oh ooh)
Now I'm hung up in suspense
Because you're bringing me in and then you're kicking me out again

It's like a hurricane, speed train
She's a moving car
Catch her in the fast lane
Oh, I gotta know
Can I keep up with her pace?
Kick it into gear when I see that face
You can take up all my time 'cause you're the only one
That can make a storm cloud break
Pulling out the sun
And I can't get caught in the rain
Can I get your lips to speak my name?

'Cause I've got some intuition or maybe I'm superstitious
But I think you're a pretty sweet pill that I'm swallowing down
To counter this addiction
You got me on a mission
Tell me darling can I get a break some-
How could I say no?

Now I'm hung up in suspense
Because you're bringing me in and then you're kicking me out again

'Cause we only have one life
The timing and the moment all seem so right
So would you say you're mine?
(We'll be just fine)
Would you say you're mine?
(We'll be just fine)

She's got a love like woe
(Wo-oh, oh-oh ooh)
