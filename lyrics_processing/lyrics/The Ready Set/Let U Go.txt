Remember when we used to get high and stay in bed for days?
I really liked that
You tell me all the things you wanna do if you weren't afraid
I wanna see that

You make me so sad, why did you do that
If I got you back (Won't let you go again)
We got it all wrong, your friends long gone
But I'm still here yeah (Won't let you go again)
Won't let you go again
Won't let you go again
I won't let you go again

Oh I wish I never let you go
Why the hell did I let you go?
Hey oh, hey oh
Oh I wish I never let you go
Why the hell did I let you go?
Hey oh, hey oh
Oh I wish I never let you go
Why the hell did I let you go?
Hey oh, hey oh
Oh I wish I never let you go
Why the hell did I let you go?
Hey oh, hey oh
You might also like
I wanna say that I'm sorry but I don't know the way
I really hate that
I wanna go to a party, I wanna drink you away, away

You make me so sad, why did you do that
If I got you back (Won't let you go again)
We got it all wrong, your friends long gone
But I'm still here yeah (Won't let you go again)
Won't let you go again
Won't let you go again
I won't let you go again

Oh I wish I never let you go
Why the hell did I let you go?
Hey oh, hey oh
Oh I wish I never let you go
Why the hell did I let you go?
Hey oh, hey oh
Oh I wish I never let you go
Why the hell did I let you go?
Hey oh, hey oh
Oh I wish I never let you go
Why the hell did I let you go?
Hey oh, hey oh
I don't know who's driving now
I'll find my way to you somehow
I text your phone, you don't reply
I can't get you off my mind
I don't know who's driving now
I'll find my way to you somehow
I text your phone, you don't reply
I can't get you off my mind

Oh I wish I never let you go
Why the hell did I let you go?
Hey oh, hey oh
Oh I wish I never let you go
Why the hell did I let you go?
Hey oh, hey oh
Oh I wish I never let you go
Why the hell did I let you go?
Hey oh, hey oh
Oh I wish I never let you go
Why the hell did I let you go?
