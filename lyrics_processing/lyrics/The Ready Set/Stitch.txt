Locked up in my head
On my own swimming around an island
Treasure map to take me where your heart is
You could think I'm funny like you once did
I've been a cold mess
Laying all my problems out on your bed
Sinking 'till I'm underneath the mattress
Feeling like the monster that I swore to keep away

I've been an anchor that's pulling on you
Stopping and stalling is all that I do
You were so bright but I painted you blue
You don't deserve that
You don't deserve that

So I'm holding on, holding on
Tryna stitch myself back together
I won't be gone for long, gone for long
'Cause I'm working on getting better
I fell apart like I'm a jigsaw puzzle
It breaks my heart to see you stress and struggle
All I want, all I want
Is to stitch myself back together for you
You might also like
(You, you, you)
Na na na na na na na na na
Ooh, for you
(You, you, you)
Na na na na na na na na na

When I fix this
Maybe we can stay in on the weekends
Do the things you wanted that I couldn't
'Cause I was too distracted
Getting faded with some mattresses and running from my past
I know that

I've been an anchor that's pulling on you
Stopping and stalling is all that I do
You were so bright but I painted you blue
You don't deserve that
You don't deserve that

So I'm holding on, holding on
Tryna stitch myself back together
I won't be gone for long, gone for long
'Cause I'm working on getting better
I fell apart like I'm a jigsaw puzzle
It breaks my heart to see you stress and struggle
All I want, all I want
Is to stitch myself back together for you
(You, you, you)
Na na na na na na na na na
Ooh, for you
(You, you, you)
Na na na na na na na na na

So I'm holding on, holding on
Tryna stitch myself back together
I won't be gone for long, gone for long
'Cause I'm working on getting better
I fell apart like I'm a jigsaw puzzle
It breaks my heart to see you stress and struggle
All I want, all I want
Is to stitch myself back together

(You, you, you)
