(Alright)
Just give a little twist, little turn
Keep on looking in the right direction, baby
I'm alive with the line, with the lies
But I kept on building it, building it, stack it up
A little architect, you're crazy
White shirt, black dress tie
Dressed to the nine times too many times
Couldn't wait to get out of the nightlife
It's a straight lie

Just calm down
The trauma's on the inside
My line's been drawn
Just calm down
The trauma's on the inside
I don't want to be wasting time
Wasting time

Do you think that you'd call me crazy?
Contrary, and I shine amazing
Hazing, aging process, called it quits
And the quicksand I trudged through and everything I meant to
Say so, so said the young ones, the dumb ones
And "stupid" you called it, but I called it flawless
Played out and fade out
I planned it - pan left and right, set the curtain
You might also like
Just calm down
The trauma's on the inside
My line's been drawn
Just calm down
You know the trauma's on the inside
I don't want to
My ticket, my destination, singing "hallelujah"
Oh god, I think I've really changed
Wish you would love me all the same
My dear, it's all for you
And I will pay my dues
I owe you so many years
And it's coming to you

Don't say "calm down", and don't quit this sound
I left 'cause I was bored at what might be in store
Don't make a sound, 'cause I'll be 'round, oh
See, I wish you could buckle up and take you chance
You know I really do, really do
And you really, really do - whoa
Just come along, come along, come along
Time's up, life's up, but I, I won't go
My ticket, my destination, singing "hallelujah"
Oh god, I think I've really changed
Wish you would love me all the same
My dear, it's all for you
And I will pay my dues
I owe you so many years
And it's coming to you

Hallelujah, hallelujah
I've left town and I won't come home
Ohio, I don't know, Michigindiana, California
Where's home?
Why, oh why, do eyes collide
Why won't it feel the same, oh, why-oh?
Wonder stands
Why, oh why
If words are right
Why won't it feel the same, oh, why-oh?
So now I won't play games, and I won't change

My ticket, my destination, singing "hallelujah"
Oh god, I think I've really changed
Wish you would love me all the same
My dear, it's all for you
And I will pay my dues
I owe you so many years
And it's coming to you
My dream and now I'm getting out
I'm screaming "Hallelujah"
Today's the day my life will change
You're gonna make it all the same
Darling, it's all for you and I will pay my dues
