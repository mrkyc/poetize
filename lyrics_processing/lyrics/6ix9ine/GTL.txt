Havin' dreams about livin' my life
I've been havin' dreams about bein' outside
I've been, hello, baby girl, please don't cry, no
Please don't, no, no no, no, no, no (No)
Mama said, "Hold my hand, no crying, no"
Know these niggas wanna take my life, I know
Tell lil' baby boy, please don't die, no
And I might, no, no no, no, no, no
Tell me why, tell me why should I trust these niggas?
Tell me why, tell me how I really loved these niggas?
Hearin' voices in my head sayin', "Fuck these niggas"
My niggas, my niggas? These ain't my niggas
They gon' say what they gon' say, nigga, yeah, I know
They can say what they want, they don't know what I know
Ain't nothin' you could tell me 'bout this life I chose
I was facin' 47, you was sitting at home

I know I can't keep loving you
I know I can't keep trusting you
I put my life in front of you
Tell me what I'm supposed to do?
This shit get complicated, ah
My blood, thought you was ride or die
I was just tryna change your life
But you I had something else in mind

Keep my head above water, for my daughter
Gotta stay ten-toes, nigga, I'ma soldier
Got my back against the wall, I'll never fold up
Wait, wait, wait, wait, nigga, hold up
Still the King of New York, I know, I told ya
You have one minute remaining
Told ya

I know I can't keep loving you
I know I can't keep trusting you
I put my life in front of you
Tell me what I'm supposed to do?
This shit get complicated, ah
My blood, thought you was ride or die
I was just tryna change your life
But you I had something else in mind
