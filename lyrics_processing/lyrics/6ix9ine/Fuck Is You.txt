Superstaar Beats

Bitch, it's Wallah fuckin' Dan, who the fuck is you? (You)
You ain't my mothafuckin' mans, who the fuck is you? (You)
Brought the cannon to the jam, who the fuck is you? (You)
Who the fuck is you? (Nigga, who the fuck is you?)
Don't give a fuck what you sayin', who the fuck is you? (You)
We don't know, you better scram, who the fuck is you? (You)
Scum Gang my only fam, who the fuck is you? (You)
Who the fuck is you? Nigga, who the fuck is you? (You)

Tekashi69 from that Scum Squad
Y'all niggas don't want no drama (Don't want no drama)
First nigga act tough gettin' WorldStar'd (WorldStar!)
And I put that on my mama (On my mama!)

Can't be where I'm at, I don't know you (Bang)
Bet my little niggas run up on you (Baow!)
They'll leave a nigga flat, no warning (Woop!)
Scum Gang, bitch, we on it, trust me 'cause you don't want it
You can try 6ix9ine if you wanna die
A-A-All my niggas down for that homicide
You'll be on a shirt, you'll be in the church
Dressed up in a box with your mama cryin' (Ah!)
She kissing your corpse
I don't know who you is and you pissing me off
I aim at your heart, bullets rip through your cross
Rip you apart, stitches can't fix it, it's straight to the morgue
Better hope you don't slip and get lost in these parts
Walk through the park after dark, catch a spark
Ten o'clock news, you'll be out on the charts
Scum to the Gang, praise to Allah
