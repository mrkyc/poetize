Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 

I've tried with all my mind
But still don't understand why we ever let it get so out of hand
My arms are reaching out and holding on tight
To what has always felt so right

It's hard to figure out the answers to the questions
When both our lives are going in separate directions

One is breaking into two (One)
And my heart is turning blue
And you still don't get it, do you? (Still don't get it, do you?)
I thought we had all the love to go with for the long run (Thought)
So before the damage is done (Before the damage is done)
Let's start back over at one (Let's start back)

Lights out (Lights out)
When every evening used to get so hot now (hot now)
We got so damned distracted we forgot
How (How)
To lock the world away and just get lost in where you end and where I begin
You might also like
Love is strong, but it's so easy to divide (Oooh)
So, boy, let's think about how much is all this life (Oooh)

One is breaking into two (One)
And my heart is turning blue
And you still don't get it, do you? (Still don't get it, do you?)
Do you? (Do you?)
I thought we had all the love to go with for the long run (Thought)
So before the damage is done (Before the damage is done)
Let's start back over at one (Let's start back)


Oh, one is breaking into two
