When you walk into a room
Your face is all I see?
And my heart races so fast
I never knew a rush to feel like that
Every time you're touching me
I never did believe in anything
I couldn't hold between my fingers
But the way you make me feel
It's just so real the way it lingers
I get lost inside your stare
Lost when you're not there
When everything I have doesn't mean a thing
If it's without you
If it's a dream, don't wake me up
I'll scream if this isn't love
If bein' lost means never knowin'
How it feels without you
I wanna stay lost forever
I wanna stay lost forever with you
No, this feeling doesn't end
It's with me everywhere I am
Hope it never goes away
It's like defying gravity
Losin' all control and bein' free
And I always wanna stay
You might also likeI never thought that I'd let go
Long enough to fall for someone deeply
Who had the power to erase my fears
And find me so completely
I get lost inside your stare
Lost when you're not there
When everything I have doesn't mean a thing
If it's without you
If it's a dream, don't wake me up
I'll scream if this isn't love
If bein' lost means never knowin'
How it feels without you
I wanna stay lost
Don't tell me where we're goin'
I don't wanna know
I like the mystery
I can't believe we've come this far
So far away from where we started off
You found me when I wasn't lookin'
You found me
And now I'm lost inside your stare
Lost when you're not there
And everything I have doesn't mean a thing
If it's without you, without you
If it's a dream, don't wake me up
I'll scream if this isn't love
If bein' lost means never knowin'
How it feels without you
Yeah, if bein' lost means never knowin'
How it feels without you
Oh, if bein' lost means that I'm never
Gonna be without you
I wanna stay lost forever
