I had it tough when I was just a little kid
It didn't matter what I thought
It didn't matter what I did
I felt the doubt for what I like right from the start
It did a number on my head
It could never touch my heart
'Cause I have just enough imagination
Just enough to keep the faith
Somehow I would think of what to do
When I get lost in a momentary weakness of emotion
All the angels came around to help me through
Life pulls fast changes
Wind blows past pages
All I see is "I don't need this"
High strung tightrope walk
Ticking time bomb clock
Scratch my name and cut these chains

I'm free
Kicking out of that prison, I am free
Singing those words of wisdom, let it be
Nobody gonna put the booze inside of me
Yeah, go
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
And there ain't nothin; I can do about it
You might also like
 stress to be the best
I've done it all
I've slam the doors, I've jammed the locks
I laid the bricks, I built the wall
No one can tell me back then
Why joy eluded me
Kept bumping into that misery
Locked up, deep down inside of me
Took that rage and I
Turned that page and I
Pack my tools, went back to school
Yeah
And I pass my graduation
And I hold my PHD
And crash test moves out
I paid those dues

I'm free
Kicking out of that prison, I am free
Singing those words of wisdom, let it be
Nobody gonna put the blues inside of me
Yeah, go
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
And there ain't nothin; I can do about it
Time flies by in photographs
And papers scraps and songs
Here I stand in ruby slippers
Free tabs takes me home
Yeah

I'm free
I'm free
I'm free
Kicking out of that prison, I am free
Singing those words of wisdom, let it be (Let it be)
Nobody gonna put the blues inside of me
Oh, yeah
I'm free
I am free, yeah
I am free
I am free
I am free
I am free
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Time flies by in photographs
And papers scraps and songs
Here I stand in ruby slippers
Free tabs takes me home
I'm free
I'm free
I'm free
Yeah
