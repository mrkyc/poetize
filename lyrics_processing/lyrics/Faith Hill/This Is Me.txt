Yeah, I have my addictions
I keep my share of secrets
And things you'll never see
Mmm, I get selfish and defensive
And pay too much attention to my insecurity

Though I
I'm just like everybody else
I try to love Jesus and myself
Yeah, yeah
I don't know what you believe
What you think or what you see
But this is a part of me, yeah
What I do and who I am
All about your purities, oh
Are right here on my sleeve
This is me
This is me

Yes, my heart breaks for the homeless
I worry about my parents
And all my bills are late
Yeah I, I'm dealing with the changes
This complicated strangeness
I'm seeing life this way
You might also like
Though I
I'm just like everybody else
I try, oh I try, to love Jesus and myself
Yeah, yeah
I don't know what you believe
What you think or what you see
But this is a part of me, yeah
What I do and who I am
All about your purities, oh
Are right here on my sleeve
This is me
This is me
Yeah

I laugh at silly movies
Tear up when I see babies
And I'm stubborn as a stone
Yeah, I
I criticize my body
I wonder if I'm ready to ever be alone

Though I
I'm just like everybody else
I cry, yes, I cry, just like everybody else
Yes, I do
I don't know what you believe
What you think or what you see
But this is a part of me, yeah
What I do and who I am
All about your purities, oh
Are right here on my sleeve
This is me
Oh, this is me
Oh, this is me, yeah
I'm gonna celebrate it
I'm gonna celebrate it
Don't be afraid who you are
Celebrate who you are
What you do, what you feel, what you see, who you are
Celebrate, celebrate
This is me
I'm not afraid, I'm not ashamed
