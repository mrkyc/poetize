"It's late enough, all your kids should be home"
The policeman says as he takes your beer for his own
You remember wondering what his wife
Thought about his occupation

He knows that you were just chasing a dream
To the town line and then back and over again
So he winks at you girls
And tells you all, "I'll see you later"

I was stealing kisses from a boy
Now I'm begging affection from a man in my house dress
Don't know you who I am? Don't know you who I am?
Standing in your kitchen

It's late enough, your husband's dinner is cold
So you wrap it up and leave it for him on the stove
It's probably the traffic again
Another important meeting
You haven't talked to an adult all day
Except for your neighbor who drives you crazy
When he finally gets in
He's sure not in the mood for talking
You might also like
I was stealing kisses from a boy
Now I'm begging affection from a man in my house dress
Don't know you who I am? Don't know you who I am?
I'm standing in the kitchen

And hours become days, days become years
And you could burn down this town if they made matches from fear
'Cause you're no worse off than anybody else
Hey, don't you even know, don't you even know yourself?

So you're standing outside your high school door
Ones you walked through twenty years before
And you whisper to all of the girls
Run, run, run

I was stealing kisses from a boy
Now I'm begging affection from a man in my house dress
Don't know you who I am? Don't know you who I am?
Take a look at who I am, take a look at who I am

I'm stealing kisses
