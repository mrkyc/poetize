Didn't I make you feel like you were the only man?
And didn't I give you everything that a woman possibly can?
Each time I tell myself I think I've had enough
Well, I'm gonna show you, baby, that a woman can be tough
So come on, come on, come on

And take it
Take another little piece of my heart now, baby
Take another little piece of my heart, I know you will
Break it
Break another little piece of my heart now, baby
'Cause you know you got it if it makes you feel good, so good

You're out on the street lookin' good
Baby, deep down in your heart you know that it ain't right
No, you'll never hear me cryin'
You know I cry all the time
Each time I tell myself that I can't stand the pain
You hold me in your arms and I start singing once again
So come on, come on, come on

And take it
Take another little piece of my heart now, baby
Take another little piece of my heart, I know you will
Break it
Break another little piece of my heart now, baby
'Cause you know you got it if it makes you feel good, so good
You might also like
Each time I tell myself
That I can't stand the pain
You hold me in your arms
And I start singing once again
So come on, come on, come on

And take it
Take another little piece of my heart now, baby
Why you just take it?
Take another little piece of my heart, I know you will
And you will break it
Break another little piece of my heart now, baby
'Cause you know you got it if it makes you feel good, oh, so good
Take another little piece of my heart now, baby
Why you just take it?
Take another little piece of my heart, I know you will
And you will break it
Break another little piece of my heart now, baby
Take another little piece of my heart, my heart, my heart, my heart, my heart
Take another little piece of my heart now, baby
Won't you just break it?
Break another little piece of my heart, my heart, my heart
You cannot break
