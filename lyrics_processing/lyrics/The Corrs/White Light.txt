To stare back like a ghost
Dropping out
To wake with a bolt
It's all a moment
Everything will pass
Your heart grows
From your mistakes
What's in a number?
27 years
Not long enough to learn from your tears
Not long enough to live with the fear
That you just mightn't be done before your time
And all of the beauty
All of the pain
Everything borrowed
Won't happen again
And all that's left is love
White light, shine on a prodigy
Not yet, unfinished symphony
I can't breathe
I see what you could've been
You gotta live long enough to learn how to live

A fading Polaroid
Of a girl
Too sensitive a soul
This flash is blinding
Your hand over your eyes
Don't wanna see
Can't take the glare
Of all of the beauty
All of the pain
Everything borrowed
Won't happen again
And all that's left is love
White light, shine on a prodigy
Not yet, unfinished symphony
I can't breathe
See what you could've been
You gotta live long enough to learn how to live
Curtain fade into memory
Too young wasted a tragedy
Turn back
Be who you'll only be
When you live long enough to learn how to live
Gotta live long enough to learn how to live
Gotta live long enough to learn how to live
Gotta live long enough to learn how to live
You gotta live long enough to learn how to live
White light, shine on a prodigy
Not yet, unfinished symphony
I can't breathe
See what you could've been
You gotta live long enough to learn how to live
White light, shine on a prodigy
Not yet, unfinished symphony
I can't breathe
See what you could've been
You gotta live long enough to learn how to live
Curtain fade into memory
Too young wasted a tragedy
Turn back
Be who you'll only be
When you live long enough to learn how to live
