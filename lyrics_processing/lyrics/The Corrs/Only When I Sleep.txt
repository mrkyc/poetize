You're only just a dreamboat
Sailing in my head
You swim my secret oceans
Of coral blue and red
Your smell is incense burning
Your touch is silken yet

It reaches through my skin
Moving from within
It clutches at my breast

But it's only when I sleep
I see you in my dreams
Got me spinning round and round
Turning upside down
But I only hear you breathe
Somewhere in my sleep
Got me spinning round and round
Turning upside down
But it's only when I sleep

And when I wake from slumber
Your shadows disappear
Your breath is just a sea mist
Surrounding my body
I'm workin' through the daytime

But when it's time to rest
I'm lying in my bed
Listening to my breath
Falling from the edge

But it's only when I sleep
I see you in my dreams (Dreams)
You got me spinning round and round
Turning upside down
I hear you breathe (But I only hear you breathe)
Somewhere in my sleep (In my sleep)
Got me spinning round and round
Turning upside down
But it's only when I sleep

Yeah, yeah-eah
Yeah, yeah, yeah-eah
It's only when I sleep


Up to the sky, where angels fly
I'll never die, Hawaiian high
It reaches through my skin
Moving from within
It clutches at my breast
Yeah-eah-eah

But it's only when I sleep
I see you in my dreams (Dreams)
Got me spinning round and round
Turning upside down
I hear you breathe (But I only hear you breathe)
In bed I lie
No need to dry (Round and round)
My sleeping cry (Upside down)

But it's only when I sleep
Ah, yeah
Got me spinning round and round
Turning upside down (Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Up to the sky, where angels fly (Round and round)
I'll never die, Hawaiian high (Turning upside down)
But it's only when I sleep
Got me spinning round and round
