Have you ever wondered where the story ends
And how it all began?
I do (I do, I do, I do)
Did you ever dream you were the movie star
With popcorn in your hand?
I did (I did, I did, I did)

Do you ever feel you're someone else inside?
And no one understands you are (you are)
And wanna disappear inside a dream
But never wanna wake, wake up

Then you stumble on tomorrow
And trip over today

Would you be happier if you were someone together?
The sun shine brighter if you played a bigger part
Would you be wonderful if it wasn't for the weather?
You're gonna be just fine (gonna be just fine)

Are you not afraid to tell your story now?
When everyone is gone it's too late (too late, too late, too late)
Was everything you ever said or done?
Not the way you planned, mistake

So you promised that tomorrow
Be different than today

Would you be happier if you were someone together?
The sun shine brighter if you played a bigger part
Would you be wonderful if it wasn't for the weather?
You're gonna be just fine (gonna be just fine)

I think you're gonna be just fine
You're gonna be just fine (fine)
So don't worry baby (don't worry, baby)
You're racing for tomorrow
Not finished with today

Would you be happier if you were someone together?
Would sun shine brighter if you played a bigger part
Would you be wonderful if it wasn't for the weather?
You're gonna be just fine (gonna be just fine)
Would we be happier if you were someone together?
Would sun shine brighter if you played a bigger part
Would we be wonderful if it wasn't for the weather?
I think we're gonna be just fine (gonna be just fine)
I think you're gonna be just fine (don't worry baby)
You're gonna be just fine (don't worry honey)
You're gonna be just fine (don't worry baby)
