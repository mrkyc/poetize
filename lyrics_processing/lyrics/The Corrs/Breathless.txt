Go on, go on
Leave me breathless
Come on, come on, come on
Hey, yeah

The daylight's fading slowly
But time with you is standing still
I'm waiting for you only
The slightest touch and I feel weak

I cannot lie
From you, I cannot hide
And I'm losing the will to try
Can't hide it (Can't hide it)
Can't fight it (Can't fight it)

So go on, go on
Come on, leave me breathless
Tempt me, tease me
Until I can't deny this
Loving feeling (Feeling)
Make me long for your kiss
Go on (Go on), go on (Go on)
Yeah, come on
Yeah

And all we have is here and now
I'm happy just to have you
You're all the love I need somehow

It's like a dream
Although I'm not asleep
And I never want to wake up
Don't lose it (Don't lose it)
Don't leave it (Don't leave it)

So go on, go on
Come on, leave me breathless
Tempt me, tease me
Until I can't deny this
Loving feeling (Loving feeling)
Make me long for your kiss

Yeah, come on (Come on, come on)
Oh, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
And I can't lie
From you I cannot hide
And I've lost my will to try
Can't hide it (Can't hide it)
Can't fight it (Can't fight it)

So go on (Go on), go on (Go on)
Come on, leave me breathless
Tempt me, tease me
Until I can't deny this
Loving feeling (Loving feeling)
Make me long for your kiss
