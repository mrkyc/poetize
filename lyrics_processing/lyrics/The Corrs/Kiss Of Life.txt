Where I let it all out
You're never there to judge me
When I'm full of doubt
Held close to your pain
You burn me body and soul
I know heaven will be waiting
When I lose control
And I'm out of my head
Running blindly to you
Caught in the moment with you
I breathe you in
You're beautiful
And angels fly to Babylon
To save the world for you
You loved me and I came alive
All of me on fire
Surrendered like I'm made of wax
Your flame, the kiss of life
You're my voodoo man
With your body in paint
You'll always be my king
My heart you can break
I'm all flesh and blood
And deep down I know
That heaven is here waiting
So I give you control

If I fall I will break, I will shatter
