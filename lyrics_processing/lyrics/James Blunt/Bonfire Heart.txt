Your mouth is a revolver
Firing bullets in the sky
Hmm-hmm
Your love is like a soldier
Loyal till you die
Hmm-hmm

And I've been looking at the stars for a long, long time
I've been putting out fires all my life
Everybody wants a flame
They don't wanna get burnt
And today is our turn

Days like these lead to
Nights like this lead to
Love like ours
You light the spark in my bonfire heart
People like us, we don't
Need that much
Just someone that starts
Starts the spark in our bonfire hearts

This world is getting colder
Strangers passing by
Hmm-hmm
No one offers you a shoulder
No one looks you in the eye, ah-ah
Hmm-hmm

They don't wanna get burnt

Mmm, our bonfire hearts
Oh, our bonfire hearts
Mmm, you light the spark

Just someone that starts
Starts the spark in our bonfire hearts

Nights like this lead to
Love like ours
You light the spark in my bonfire heart (Two, three, four)
People like us, we don't
Need that much
Just someone that starts
Starts the spark in our bonfire hearts
Our bonfire hearts
Days like these lead to
Nights like this lead to
Love like ours
You light the spark in my bonfire heart
