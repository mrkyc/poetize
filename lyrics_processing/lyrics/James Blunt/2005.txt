I woke up this morning
And realised
All I do is apologise
For a song I wrote in 2005
Didn't come with a warning
But fame is unkind
Put me on top of the world
Couple of girls and then
Left me behind

Sure, let's take a photograph
You can show it to your friends and laugh
I'd tell you what I'm doing now
But you don't really wanna know

I wrote you a love song
Now it's something that you hate on
And I'm sad the record's broken
But I don't think I can write a better love song
Without it I'd be no one
And now that you've forgotten me
Tell me how to write one better

I'm not gonna lie
Say it didn't work out
'Cause I live in a big house
Made a few pounds
Nice car on the drive
And I went 'round the world once or twice
Saw the sunset and sunrise
But for big highs, there's a big price
When all you do is criticise

Sure, let's take a photograph
You can show it to your friends and laugh
I'd tell you what I'm doing now
But you don't really wanna know

I wrote you a love song
Now it's something that you hate on
And I'm sad the record's broken
But I don't think I can write a better love song
Without it I'd be no one
And now that you've forgotten me
Tell me how to write one better
I don't think I can write one better
Love, song
Love, song

I wrote you a love song
Now it's something that you hate on
And I'm sad the record's broken
But I don't think I can write one better love song
Now it's something that you hate on
And I'm sad the record's broken
But I don't think I can write a better love song
Without it I'd be no one
And now that you've forgotten me
Just tell me how to write one better

I woke up this morning
And realised
All I do is apologise
