Let it slide
All the choices I made
Let it burn
As it rolls down my face
Let it fall
Just to be the one again
But if I want
I won't be loved by you at all
Let it slip
Every promise I break
Let it burn
All the blows that we trade
Let it fall
'cause this place has been condemned
And we both know
That we can't be here anymore

Yeah, I know I pulled a pin on your heart
But I lost sight of the target when you let down your guard
Should've run, run a hundred miles
Never look back, Jack, 'cause now we can't backtrack
And yeah, I know what you'll say, nothing can change
No one to blame, it's on the tip of my tongue
Here it comes, this is crazy, you should know that
I would go back in a heartbeat
Just to make your heart beat

Let it fail
It's too late to be saved
Let it roll
They're all across this grey
Let it blaze
There's a darkness in the flame
And it's lost
And we can't bear it anymore
Let it slide
I can't start it again
Let it burn
While it's held in my hand
Let it fall
'cause this journey's at its end
It's only luck
That I was loved by you at all

Yeah, I know I pulled a pin on your heart
But I lost sight of the target when you let down your guard
Should've run, run a hundred miles
Never look back, Jack, 'cause now we can't backtrack
And yeah, I know what you'll say, nothing can change
No one to blame, it's on the tip of my tongue
Here it comes, this is crazy, you should know that
I would go back in a heartbeat
