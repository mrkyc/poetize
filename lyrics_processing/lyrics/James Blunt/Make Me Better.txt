You made me breakfast every morning
You made me sleep all through the night
You made me worry without any warning
Let me just lie here, drown in your eyes, dear
You made me sorry, this wasn't always
You made me hungry for your body, babe
You made me run down hospital hallways
You gave me life, dear and he has got your eyes

I waited so long, baby, I did you wrongs
Make up for the time we've wasted
You would wait by the phone
Every time I was gone, but all along

You are everything I have never been
I want you to make me better
And I've been wondering why you let me in
I want you to make me better

You made me stop and savour the moment
You made me laugh out loud, you do
You give me memories like time is frozen
You gave me a child and he's got your smile

And I sang a song every night I was gone
About all the dreams I'm chasing
And I have been wrong
With the things that I've done 'cause all along

You are everything I have never been
I want you to make me better
And I've been wondering why you let me in
I want you to make me better

Although that I've never read your mind
I figured it out on my own
I am so glad that I caught you in time
Before I am left all alone, alone

You are everything I have never been
I want you to make me better
So please, my darling, take this wedding ring
I want you to make me better
And I've been wondering why you ever let me in
I want you to make me better
I want you to make me better
