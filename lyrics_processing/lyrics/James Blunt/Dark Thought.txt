I drove up the hill just to say goodbye
But all I found was a "For Sale" sign
Put my hand on the gate and there's tears in my eyes
And all that's been left since the minute you died
Are the chandeliers in the trees, ceramic bees
Now they're just covered in leaves
My hands are shaking as I type in the code
The gate doesn't open, just a voice that says, "No"
But I know inside there's a piece of your soul
That they're painting over and everything else will be sold
And the piano that played on its own is not playing no more

I wish that you had called somebody (Oh)
And if I wasn't there, I'm sorry (Oh)
You made me believe you were strong
I wish you had called me and told me that something was wrong
So goodbye to my best friend ever (Oh)
I can't believe you're gone forever (Oh)
I came up to find you today
'Cause I finally found all the words that I needed to say
But a dark thought got there first

They buried your ashes in a Prozac pill
And all the vultures came to chew on your will
I hate that you're gone and the questions you leave
And it's sad that your daughter's not talking to me
Well, I can't draw a heart, so I drew you a star on the Hollywood Boulevard

I wish that you had called somebody (Oh)
And if I wasn't there, I'm sorry (Oh)
You made me believe you were strong
I wish you had called me and told me that something was wrong
So goodbye to my best friend ever (Oh)
I can't believe you're gone forever (Oh)
I came up to find you today
'Cause I finally found all the words that I needed to say
But a dark thought got there first
Dark thought did its worst
And that's what really hurts
A dark thought got there first

I drove up the hill just to say goodbye
But all I found was a "For Sale" sign
Put my hand on the gate and there's tears in my eyes
And all that's been left since the minute you died
Are the chandeliers in the trees, ceramic bees
