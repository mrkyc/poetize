I heard there's a song that God only knows
And it's keeping me dancing (Dancing, dancing)
Nobody here knows how the melody goes
But it's keeping me dancing (Dancing, dancing)
(Beside you)

Oh, Lord, here I go
I get the highs, but why the lows?
Set me up with all these souls
And I watch them fall like dominoes
Too long I been on my feet
Need more time, but it don't come cheap
Some day I'll be on my knees
And I pray my heart don't miss a beat

But here I am and I feel that rhythm
It's the lifeline that I've been given
And all these colours in my head
And I ask myself, "Is it over yet?"

I heard there's a song that God only knows
And it's keeping me dancing
Nobody here knows how the melody goes
But it's keeping me dancing beside you

Beside you
Beside you
Beside you

Oh, Lord, here I come
Touch the sky and I kiss the sun
And when she fades, I know I might fall
But I won't care much 'cause I've seen it all

But here I am and I feel that rhythm
It's the lifeline that I've been given
And all these colours in my head
And I ask myself, "Is it over yet?" (Is it over yet? Is it over yet? Is it over?)

I heard there's a song that God only knows
And it's keeping me dancing
Nobody here knows how the melody goes
But it's keeping me dancing beside you

Beside you
Beside you
Beside you
Not coming down, not coming down, not coming down
Head in the clouds, feet off the ground, not coming down
(I heard there's a song)

I heard there's a song that God only knows
And it's keeping me dancing (Oh-oh)
Nobody here knows how the melody goes
But it's keeping me dancing beside you

Beside you
Beside you
Beside you (Beside you)

I heard there's a song that God only knows
