There ain't nothin' better I like to do
Than sit around the house when the folks ain't home
And listen to the music on a gramophone
I like mountain music, good old mountain music
Played by a real hillbilly band
Give me rural rhythm, let me sway right with 'em
I think the melodies are grand
I have heard Hawaiians play in the land of the wicki-wacki
But I must say you can't beat "Turkey in the straw", by cracky!
I like mountain music, good old mountain music
Played by a real hillbilly band
To the Smoky Mountains of Tennessee
Came a hula girl from over the sea
With sparkling eyes, lips so red
She looked at me and then she said
I like mountain music, good old mountain music
Played by a real hillbilly band
Give me rural rhythm, let me sway right with 'em
I think the melodies are grand
I have heard Hawaiians play in the land of the wicki-wacki
But I must say you can't beat "Turkey in the straw", by cracky!
I like mountain music, good old mountain music
Played by a real hillbilly band
You might also like(Instrumental break)
Her flashy clothes are really neat
Flowing hair and dancing feet
When she does the hula, she can drive you wild
Swingin' and swayin' in the mountain style
I like mountain music, good old mountain music
Played by a real hillbilly band
Give me rural rhythm, let me sway right with 'em
I think the melodies are grand
I have heard Hawaiians play in the land of the wicki-wacki
But I must say you can't beat "Turkey in the straw", by cracky!
I like mountain music, good old mountain music
Played by a real hillbilly band
(Instrumental break)
While the fiddles play and the guitars ring
The people laugh, you can hear them sing
This hula girl can swing and sway
You can hear her shout to the break of day
I like mountain music, good old mountain music
Played by a real hillbilly band
Give me rural rhythm, let me sway right with 'em
I think the melodies are grand
I have heard Hawaiians play in the land of the wicki-wacki
But I must say you can't beat "Turkey in the straw", by cracky!
I like mountain music, good old mountain music
