This ocean inside
I'm tired and I'm afraid
And I can't find my way
I've been hiding for days
Caught up in these waves
Of hope and sorrow
I gotta find my strength
And I know I'm gonna make it
If my heart can take it
And if I don't, I know I'm gonna go out fighting
And I know I'm gonna get through
Cause I got the will to
And if I don't, I know I'm gonna go out trying
Could I rise up above
And be healed by love
And dream about the mountains that I've yet to climb
Can I touch what I feel
Can I make it all real
Just dream another dream to take me high
You might also likeAnd I know I'm gonna make it
If my heart can take it
And if I don't, I know I'm gonna go out fighting
And I know I'm gonna get through
Cause I got the will to
And if I don't, you know I'm gonna go out trying
I will be strong
I will hold on
I will keep winning until the race is run
I will be strong
I will hold on
I will keep winning until the race is run
It's a beautiful day
If I could just walk away
From everything that keeps me from the truth I know
Cause I know I'm gonna make it, make it
If my heart can take it
And if I don't, I know I'm gonna go out fighting
I know I'm gonna get through
Cause I got the will to, got the will to
And if I don't, you know I'm gonna go out trying
I will be strong
I will hold on, I will hold on
I will keep winning until the race is run
I will be strong
I will hold on
I will keep winning until the race is run
I will be strong
I will hold on
I will keep winning until the race is run
I will be strong
I will hold on
I will keep winning until the race is run
I will be strong
I will hold on
Until the race is run
