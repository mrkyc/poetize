There the river runs deep
Where the shadow ends
So begins the dream
Where the hunger leads me
It's hard to believe
I'll be lost to you
It's the blood that ties
It's the hurt that heals
It's the face you hide
Hides the pain you feel
So hold me up now
Yeah, I'm afraid to breathe
An' I'm lost to you
Yeah, I'm lost to you
I believe in a heaven
I believe in the night
I believe there's a path to follow
I believe in the light
Part of you is the devil
Part of you is the light
I'm gonna fly
Through the city of angels
You might also likeHold me under
Let the river wash away my sins
Let me drown and you
Let the water and the love rush you
You can hear me whisper
When you're listenin'
And I'm lost to you
Yeah, lost to you
I believe in a heaven
I believe in the night
I believe there's a path to follow
I believe in the light
Part of you is the devil
Part of you is the light
I'm gonna fly
Through the city of angels
It's the blood that ties
It's the hurt that heals
It's the face you hide
Hides the pain you feel
So hold me up now
I long to believe
And I'm lost to you
Yeah, lost to you
I believe in a heaven
I believe in the night
I believe there's a path to follow
I believe in the light
Part of you is the devil
Part of you is the light
I'm gonna fly
Through the city of angels
I believe in a heaven
I believe in the night
I believe there's a path to follow
I believe in the light
Part of you is the devil
Part of you is the light
I'm gonna fly
Through the city of angels
