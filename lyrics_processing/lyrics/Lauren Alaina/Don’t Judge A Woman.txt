Don't judge a girl
Cryin' in a bathroom stall
I bet there's a boy to blame
And it ain't just the alcohol
Don't judge a lady
For that too-tight, low-cut dress
She came here for a reason
Even if her judgement ain't the best

You don't know where she's been
So if you see her with him

Maybe he's a phase, maybe he's a rebound
Mighta been the one or a one-night stand
Maybe he's a nice guy, but only on the inside
And she's tried to leave him, but maybe she can't
You ain't in the heels she's walkin' in
So don't judge a book by its cover
Or a woman by her man

Don't judge a wife
Who just smiles and says it's fine
When the whole town knows he's runnin' 'round
It's easier to lie
And don't judge a mother
Who stays in it for the kids
She's just tryin' to do better
Than her parents ever did

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

Maybe he's a phase, maybe he's a rebound
Mighta been the one or a one-night stand
Maybe he's a nice guy, but only on the inside
And she's tried to leave him, but maybe she can't
You ain't in the heels she's walkin' in
So don't judge a book by its cover
Or a woman by her man
Don't judge a woman
Who takes back her maiden name
She's just tryin' to move on
