It's always on a Saturday night
When I feel like my jeans fit right
And I'm headin' out to get a little tipsy
Ready for somebody new to kiss me
My friends didn't have to beg
I got ready and I shaved my legs
And I'm living like the life of the party
That's when you call me

When I'm not sad anymore
When there ain't tears fallin' on the floor
When I'm not lookin' for a shoulder
My phone lights up with a "will you come over?"
When I ain't thinkin' one thing about you
You always do that thing you do
Yeah, you decide that I'm worth fightin' for
When I'm not sad anymore

It's as true as the sky is blue
You only want me when I don't want you
When I ain't even missin' you a little
Like my heart sends you a smoke signal

When I'm not lookin' for a shoulder
My phone lights up with a "will you come over?"
When I ain't thinkin' one thing about you
You always do that thing you do
Yeah, you decide that I'm worth fightin' for, yeah
When I'm not sad anymore
When I'm not sad anymore

You can't undo the gettin' over you I did
And I'll be glad to tell you when you show up here again

When I'm not sad anymore
When there ain't tears fallin' on the floor
When I'm not lookin' for a shoulder
My phone lights up with a "will you come over?"
When I ain't thinkin' one thing about you
You always do that thing you do
Yeah, you decide I'm worth fightin' for
When I'm not sad anymore
Oh-oh-oh, when I'm not sad anymore
It's always on a Saturday night
When I feel like my jeans fit right
