I don't care if you're wearing a flat bill
Cowboy hat, flip flops, or high heels
Don't care if you're up or downtown
If you're hard rock, or rap, or Motown
Don't care if you're PhD, or GED, or ADD
Don't care if, or where you went to school
As long as you're cool

If you can start a party anywhere you are, hey
You don't care who's watching
You just let go
Like everyday's your birthday
Even if it's Monday
You're not afraid to let your true colors show
You're my kinda people
(My kinda people)
You're my kinda people
(My kinda people)
You're my kinda

Don't matter if you got some issues
If you're clean-cut, or covered in tattoos
On the inside or on the out
Ain't what you look like, it's what you're about
I don't care where you're from
I don't care what you got
I don't care what you done
Who you are or who you're not
If you like to get loud that's okay
