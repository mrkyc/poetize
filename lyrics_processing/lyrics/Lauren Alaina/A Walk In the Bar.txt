I bet you think I'm broke up 'bout how bad this breakup is
No, I ain't goin' out like that, I'm goin' out like this

Gonna paint my payback jeans on
Beeline straight to the neon
Gettin' to a place I don't need you
Gonna be a breeze, yeah
Boy, it's gonna be a

Walk in the bar, walk in the bar
Find me a cowboy, kiss him in the dark
Do a little two shot, two-step, dance floor, forget
Tonight, if you see me
I'll be drinkin' for free
I'ma make movin' on look so easy
Who says heartbreak's gotta be hard?
Gettin' over you is just a walk, a walk in the bar

I fell for you and then I watched the whole thing fall apart
But this Kentucky's been the only thing I'm takin' hard

Goodbye, ain't stealin' my thunder
One boot in front of the other
Gettin' to a place I don't need you
Gonna be a breeze, yeah
Boy, it's gonna be a

It's a walk in the bar, walk in the bar
Find me a cowboy, kiss him in the dark
