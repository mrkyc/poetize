It's a battleground
Everywhere you go, there's something trying to take you down
So hard to stand up when they're kicking you around
Putting your fire out
Putting it out
Hey, hey

But I'm not scared and I'm not shaking
Yeah, I've got armor and they can't break it

'Cause you kiss me back together when I'm falling apart
When the music's gone, I'm dancing to the beat of your heart
You're the breath in my lungs when the gravity's pulling me under
I could win any wa-a-ar
I could face any sto-o-orm
Yeah, I could conquer the wo-o-orld
With just one hand
As long as you're holding the other

Saving grace
Baby, you're the hope I find behind my mistakes
Hold me close and I'll forget about the pain
You take it all away
You take it away
Yes, you do

'Cause you kiss me back together when I'm falling apart
