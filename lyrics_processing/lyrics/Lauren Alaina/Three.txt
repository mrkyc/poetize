Three weeks before I could even meet my brother's son
Didn't see him turn one or two
Three months I haven't made Sunday service once
I'm out on the road praying alone
Every night for a sign that I'm doing this right
And I'm right where I'm supposed to be

Mama said, "You'll be a star."
And daddy said, "You're gonna go far, all you gotta do is sing your heart out"
A lot of miles, a lot of tears
Have given me some of my best years
There's so much I had to miss out on
Six years of missing home for three minutes on the radio

Three years of wishing that he was here holding my hand
No, I didn't plan for those three words
To be the ones that hurt
They don't sound the same from so far away

Mama said, "You'll be a star."
And daddy said, "You're gonna go far, all you gotta do is sing your heart out"
A lot of miles, a lot of tears
Have given me some of my best years
There's so much I had to miss out on
Six years of missing home for three minutes on the radio

I'll do it for the three girls
At my show, who saved up for the third row
And the three times that I heard just this week that my words
Were sang by a three year old
Hairbrush for a microphone
Little girl with a dream
And that girl was me, yeah

My Mama said, "You'll be a star."
And Daddy said, "You're gonna go far, all you gotta do is sing your heart out"
A lot of miles, a lot of tears
Have given me my best years
There's so much I had to miss out on
Six years of missing home
