If you took care of me like the cowboy boots
That made you over six feet tall
If you shined me up like your jacked-up truck
Took me out and showed me off
If you just talked to me
A little sweeter with your Southern drawl to me
If you didn't feel like you were halfway gone to me
I never would've had to leave

But I guess it's all good ole boy
Didn't know you had it good ole boy
Learned your manners in Tennessee
Bet your momma doesn't know you didn't use 'em on me
Now you're drunk in a bar
Back in the saddle like a neon star
And I'm home alone with a broken heart
But I'd be lyin' if I said that I don't know that you are
A good ole boy
That didn't love me that good ole boy

If you held me like you held your beer
I'd still be drunk on you
If you loved me like you loved to fish
You could've hooked me too

That didn't love me that good ole boy, yeah

I hope you learned a lesson
On how you gotta treat a good ole girl
And when you get the next one
Let her be the queen of your small town world
I guess it's all good
You didn't love me that good ole boy

Now you're drunk in a bar

But I'd be lying if I said that I don't know that you are
A good ole boy
