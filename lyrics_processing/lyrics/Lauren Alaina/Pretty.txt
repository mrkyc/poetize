You spend an hour on your hair
And you can't find a thing to wear at all
You pile the makeup on real thick
Trace outside the lines of your faint lips
'Cause they ain't big enough

All the other girls are thinner
So you skip another dinner
And tell yourself "it's for your health"
What's the matter with this picture?
Girl, deep down you know better

Beautiful is who you are
When no one's watching it's your heart
It should be the only one to tell your story
'Cause the rhythm that's beating is your glory
The truth inside you can't erase
'Cause it ain't written on your face
There's no difference between a mirror and a liar
Because pretty is as pretty does, does

You've got hopes, and you've got dreams
But you've been hiding them behind the seams, oh yeah
But pretty cares, and pretty loves
And I'm pretty sure you're more than just giving, oh

Let your kindness be your fire
Burnin' bright
You are the light

Beautiful is who you are
When no one's watching it's your heart
That should be the only one to tell your story
'Cause the rhythm that's beating is your glory
The truth inside you can't erase
'Cause it ain't written on your face
There's no difference between a mirror and a liar
Because pretty is as pretty does, does
Pretty does

So be brave, be strong
Keep your love light on
Be the right in all the wrongs, yeah
Be generous
And be radiant
You are confident, oh
