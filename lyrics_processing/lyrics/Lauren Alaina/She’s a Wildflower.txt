She was the kind of girl that never quite fit in
Holes in her shoes and freckles on her skin
Every time she saw those school doors open wide
She'd wanna turn around and run back home and hide
Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh
She got used to bein' stuck at the back of the line
The kind that kept her head down most of the time
Secret dreams 'bout the boy in the high school band
And then wake up thinkin' she'd never have a chance

She's a wildflower just waitin' on a sunny day
Just waitin' on the winds of change to blow
Just a red hot spark that's lookin' for a little flame, yeah
Trying to find the perfect place to grow
She's a wildflower
She's a wildflower

She makes a wish on every single star she sees
Yeah, somewhere deep down, she still believes
Prays every night before she goes to bed
Pretty soon her luck is gonna change
She just doesn't know it yet
