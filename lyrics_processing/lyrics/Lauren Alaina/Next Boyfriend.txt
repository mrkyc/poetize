I thought I knew you from somewhere
Right when you walked through the door
So please forgive me for staring
It's driving me crazy where I've seen you before
Maybe it's the white T-shirt that you're wearing
The danger in your eyes or your fingers in your hair
It's a pretty small town, it's coming to me now, woah
I just figured it out

You look a lot like my next boyfriend
I can't believe how much you act like him
You and me, we'd be unbelievable
And I'm available
No, I don't think it's a coincidence
I put it all together, it makes sense
Boy, you ain't no fling or a could've been
'Cause you look a lot like my next boyfriend

Mm, yeah

You should probably come over
Tell me your name and I'll tell you mine
I'll probably give you my number
And you can call me anytime
I hope you like red lips, driveway kissing
'Cause if you want it, baby, that's what you'll be getting
Every night, all of the time, oh
Hope that's alright
