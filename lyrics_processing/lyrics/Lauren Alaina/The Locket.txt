Back in '41
You met a brown eyed boy who called you pretty
He'd walk everyday a couple miles out of his way
To hold your hand and keep you company
Your mama said, "Don't call it love at fourteen"
But sittin' on that front porch swing

He gave you his picture in a locket that you wore around your neck
Left it right beside your heart, so you would not forget
The way it felt when he held your hand
And you swore that you would never take it off
And the butterflies you felt said it all
You were fallin' with a boy inside your locket

Back in '43
Your brown eyed boy went overseas
And had to leave town for a little while
He swore he'd marry you
As soon as the war was through
You would be his wife
Standing in the pouring rain
You cried as you watched him ride away
But everyday

You had his picture in a locket that you wore around your neck
Left it right beside your heart so you would not forget
The way his kiss tasted on your lips
And everyday felt like a lifetime with him gone
And you prayed that God would bring him safely home
'Cause you made a promise to the boy inside your locket

Oh, sixty years you two had together
And he's been gone for a couple now
And it breaks my heart to see you struggle to remember
And I've been writing all your memories down
And I stopped by today to read a couple pages
Grandma, you sure look pretty
And you smile that smile
The one I haven't seen in quite a while
And you said to me: "I want you to keep

His picture in a locket that I wore around my neck
The one I left beside my heart, so I would not forget
The greatest love and the greatest man I've ever known
But it's getting time for me to head on home"
She said, "That brown eyed boy is waiting and I don't wanna keep him long
Heaven is calling"
And she said
