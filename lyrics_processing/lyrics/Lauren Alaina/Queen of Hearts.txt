Let's play it straight, no need to wait
Just place your bet on me
You never know what ace you might have
Hiding up your sleeve
Before you make your next move
Honey, you better think it through
Love's a game but you choose
So don't play it like a fool

'Cause I'm right here
In the palm of your hand
Right now, baby, go all in
Slow down before you lose your chance to win
Don't throw it all away
You underestimate what you got
Love is worth the wait, take a shot
Don't be so quick to fold your cards
You just might have
A Queen of Hearts

Even though I think your poker face is kinda cute
Just let it go, 'cause we both know
You can't hide the truth
Boy, you might look tough
But I wanna know the real you
And yeah, I'm calling your bluff
And I can see right through
