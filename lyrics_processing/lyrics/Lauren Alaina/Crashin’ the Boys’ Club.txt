Talking drama
Drinking red wine
If I hear I look fat one more time
Doin' spray tans
Getting highlights
Can't put up with this stuff all night

My boyfriend, and all of his friends, and all of their friends are drinking beer right now downtown, just keeping it cool
Talking about football cards, favorite bars, and glory days in high school
And I wanna be too

Girls are gonna go, go, go
Above you, wanna know, know, know
But I wanna have some fun, fun, fun
So I'm crashin' the boys' club
I know I ain't a man, man, man
But I hope you understand, stand, stand
'Cause tonight my kinda fun, fun, fun
Is crashin' the boys' club

Got no worries
Ain't no whining
No behind your back, smack talk, and crying
It ain't complicated
So don't complicate it
Just some good 'ol laid back hanging

My girlfriend, and all of her friends, and all of their friends are gossiping right now, so loud
And painting their nails
Talking about other girls, broken hearts, movie stars
I usually would, but tonight I don't care

Girls are gonna go, go, go
Above you, wanna know, know, know
But I wanna have some fun, fun, fun
So I'm crashin' the boys' club

But I hope you understand, stand, stand (Understand)
Cause tonight my kinda fun, fun, fun
Is crashin' the boys' club
