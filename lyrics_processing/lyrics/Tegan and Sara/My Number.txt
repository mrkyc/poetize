Wish I was pounding out a new beat
I trade my old shoes for new feet
I grab a new seat
I don't like the one I got
The fabric's wearing through
And it's wearing me out
You're wearing me down

Watching old baseball games and low budget telethons
Ain't like watching you yourself when you, yourself is on
Got time to wander, to waste, and to whine
But when it comes to you, it seems like I just can't find the time

So watch your head and then watch the ground
It's a silly time to learn to swim when you start to drown
It's a silly time to learn to swim on the way down

If I gave you my number
Would it still be the same
If I, if I saved you from drowning
Promise me you'll never go away
Promise me you'll always stay
You might also like
Closed down the last local zoo
I'm going to win the endless war
Over who kills the last koala bear
And who in death will love him more and I
He grabs me by the hand
Drags me to the shore and says
Maybe you don't love me
Or you'll grow to love me even more
And I well I'm not surprised

If I gave you my number
Would it still be the same
If I, if I saved you from drowning
Promise me you'll never go away
Promise me you'll always stay

Showers pounding out a new beat
I trade my old shoes for new feet
I grab a new seat
I don't like the one I got
The fabric's wearing through
And it's wearing me out
You're wearing me down
You're wearing me down
So watch your head and then watch the ground
It's a silly time to learn to swim when you start to drown
It's a silly time to learn to swim when you start to drown

If I gave you my number
Would it still be the same
If I, if I saved you from drowning
Promise me you'll never go away
If I gave you my number
Would it still be the same
If I, if I saved you from drowning
Promise me you'll never go away
