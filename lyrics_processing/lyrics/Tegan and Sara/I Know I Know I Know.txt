From hundreds of miles you cry like a baby
You plead with me, shout, scream, tell me I'm staying
I know I know I know, I'm still your love
Back from the last place that I wanted to fake you
Laugh with me, shout, scream now tell me you're staying
I know I know I know, you're still my love

The same as I love you, you'll always love me too
This love isn't good unless it's me and you

Box after box and you're still by my side
The weather is changing and breaking my stride
I know I know I know, it's just this day
House after house, just like car after car
You see club after club and it all seems so far
I know I know I know, what else are we here for?

The same as I love you, you'll always love me too
This love isn't good unless it's me and you

Stick your hands inside of my pockets
Keep them warm while I'm still here
Tell them this love hasn't changed me, hasn't changed me at all
You might also like
Last night I was writing about you
I know my screaming and shouting won't keep you
I know I know I know, you're still my love
I wake up to the sound of you working
You're one room right over, stressing and loving me
I know I know I know, be still my love

The same as I love you, you'll always love me too
This love isn't good unless it's me and you

Stick your hands inside of my pockets
Keep them warm while I'm still here
Tell them this love hasn't changed me, hasn't changed me at all
Stick your heart inside of my chest
Keep it warm here while we rest
Tell them this love hasn't changed me, hasn't changed me at all

The same as I love you, you'll always love me too
