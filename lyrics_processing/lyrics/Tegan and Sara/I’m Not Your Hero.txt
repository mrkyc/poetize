Standing where I am now
Standing up at all
I was used to feeling like I was never going to see myself at the finish line
Hanging on to parts of me
Hanging on at all
I was used to seeing no future in my sightline

Sometimes it feels like they want to remind me
Send all those villains after me

I'm not their hero, but that doesn't mean that I wasn't brave
I never walked the party line, doesn't mean that I was never afraid
I'm not your hero, but that doesn't mean we're not one and the same

Feeling like I am now
Lighting up the hall
I was used to standing in the shadow of a damaged heart
Learning all I know now
Losing all I did
I never used to feel like I'd be standing so far ahead

Sometimes it feels what I recovered, you lost
Sending your peaceful arms to me
You might also like
I'm not their hero, but that doesn't mean that I wasn't brave
(Oh, oh, oh)
I never walked the party line, doesn't mean that I was never afraid
(Oh, oh, oh)
I'm not your hero, but that doesn't mean we're not one and the same
(Oh, oh, oh)

Sometimes it feels like the side that I'm on
Plays the toughest hand, holds the longest stand
Sometimes it feels like I'm all that they've got
Gets so hard to know I'm not what they want
Sometimes it feels like the side that I'm on
Plays the toughest hand, holds the longest stand
Sometimes it feels like I'm all that they've got
Gets so hard to know I'm not what they want

I'm not their hero, but that doesn't mean that I wasn't brave
(Oh, oh, oh)
I never walked the party line, doesn't mean that I was never afraid
(Oh, oh, oh)
I'm not your hero, but that doesn't mean we're not one and the same
(Oh, oh, oh)
Do my best to walk the finest line 'til I've had all that I can take
(Oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
