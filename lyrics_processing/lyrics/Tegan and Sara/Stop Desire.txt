I can't deny I'm begging for attention
Dropping hints, hoping for some tension
Getting tired of making all this racket
Waiting on you to get your ass in gear
I didn't wanna be so invested
I played it cool and then I overdressed it
You were there, I was tired of this
Nonsense when you pretend you don't

Get me, feel me, want me
Like me, love me, need me

Tonight, if you fuel my fire
You can't stop desire, oh oh, oh oh oh
Stop desire, oh oh, oh oh oh
I tried, but you're fuel to my fire
You can't stop desire, oh oh, oh oh oh
Stop desire, oh oh, oh oh oh

In a minute, I'll be hoping that you're outside
Another second, you'll be walking on my wild side
You know I'm ready for anything to happen
Take this passion, turn it into action
You might also like
Get me, feel me, want me
Like me, love me, need me

Tonight, if you fuel my fire
You can't stop desire, oh oh, oh oh oh
Stop desire, oh oh, oh oh oh
I tried, but you're fuel to my fire
You can't stop desire, oh oh, oh oh oh
Stop desire, oh oh, oh oh oh

Right where I want you, back against the wall
Trust when I promise, never let you fall
Right where I want you, back against the wall
You can trust me, I'll never let you fall

Tonight, if you fuel my fire
You can't stop desire, oh oh, oh oh oh
Stop desire, oh oh, oh oh oh
I tried, but you're fuel to my fire
You can't stop desire, oh oh, oh oh oh
Stop desire, oh oh, oh oh oh
Tonight, if you fuel my fire
You can't stop desire, oh oh, oh oh oh
