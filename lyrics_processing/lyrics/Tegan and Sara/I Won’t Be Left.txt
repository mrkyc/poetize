I won't mistake you for problems with me
I won't let my moods ruin this you'll see
I won't take everything good and move it away
I won't be left dancing alone to songs from the past

Would you stay (Would you stay)
Home and keep (Home and keep)
Our memories warm with me? (My memories warm)
Would you give (Would you give)
All your love (All your love)
For a run at the past with me? (A run at the past)
I know you're sad (I know you're sad)
Even though (Even though)
You say that you're not (You say that you're not)
I know you're scared (I know you're sad)
Even though (Even though)
You say that you're not (You say that you're not)

I won't get mad when you say things are getting too hard
I won't make all of your love so scared to come through our yard
I won't scream in my head and let it isolate me
I won't be left dancing alone to songs from the past
