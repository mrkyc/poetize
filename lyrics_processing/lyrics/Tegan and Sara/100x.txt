I went crazy thinking I was wrong
Like a fool holding on too long
Let it crumble, let the whole thing fall
You were someone I loved
Then you were no one at all

It was cruel of me to do what I did to you, did-did-did to you
It was wrong of me to hurt such a big part of you, part-part of you

I swear I tried to leave you
At least a hundred times a day
I swear I tried to tell you
A thousand times, a different way
I need out, on my own, I don't wanna live this way
I need out, on my own, I don't wanna live this way
I swear I tried to tell you
At least a hundred times a day

You went silent watching as I packed
Rehearsed the words you hoped would get me back
Shout it out and let your whole world fall
I was someone you loved
Then I was no one at all
You might also like
It was cruel of me to do what I did to you, did-did-did to you
It was wrong of me to hurt such a big part of you, part-part of you

I swear I tried to leave you
At least a hundred times a day
I swear I tried to tell you
A thousand times, a different way
I need out, on my own, I don't wanna live this way
I need out, on my own, I don't wanna live this way
I swear I tried to tell you
At least a hundred times a day

Oh I told you, that I, I needed out
And I, I couldn't stay
Couldn't stay here one more day
Oh I told you, that I, I needed out
And I, I couldn't say
Couldn't tell you one more way

I swear I tried to leave you
At least a hundred times a day
I swear I tried to tell you
A thousand times, a different way
I need out, on my own, I don't wanna live this way
I need out, on my own, I don't wanna live this way
I swear I tried to tell you
