I love you
I don't need a ring to prove that you're worthy
You're under my skin
It's easy, I don't need a lock to prove that you trust me
I walk the walk

To be with you
Just to be with you
Oh, to be with you
Just to be with you

Save your first and last dance for me
I don't need a white wedding
Save your first and last born for me
We don't need a white wedding
All the girls I loved before
Told me they signed up for more
Save your first and last chance for me
Cause I don't want a white wedding

I told you, I struggled to stay before
And I worry about letting you in
It's easy how quickly the false starts end when I'm happy
I stop the clock
You might also like
To be with you
Just to be with you
Oh, to be with you
Just to be with you

Save your first and last dance for me
I don't need a white wedding
Save your first and last born for me
We don't need a white wedding
All the girls I loved before
Told me they signed up for more
Save your first and last chance for me
Cause I don't want a white wedding

Keep your name, you can keep your dates
Keep your name, you can keep your fame
Keep your name, you can keep your dates
Keep your name, you can keep it all
Keep your name, you can keep your dates
Keep your name, you can keep your fame
Keep your name, you can keep your dates
Keep your name, you can keep it all
Save your first and last dance for me
I don't need a white wedding
Save your first and last born for me
We don't need a white wedding
All the girls I loved before
Told me they signed up for more
Save your first and last chance for me
