Does your heart ache when you get around me?
Does your heart break when you think about me?
Now you want to say I was a liar
Led you astray, I won't deny it
I did what they thought would be good for me
Now you want to cry, call me a cheater
Left you to die, though I did neither
Thought that it would, that it would be best for me

Do you crumble? Do your worst
Do you tumble? Do your worst
I couldn't be your friend
Even if I tried again
I couldn't be your friend
Try to conceal it, I won't believe it
Even if I tried again
I couldn't be your friend

Does your body shake when you get around me?
Does your body wake when you think about me?
Now you want to say I was a criminal stole you away
That sounds so fictional
I did what they thought would be good for me
You might also like
Do you crumble? Do your worst
Do you tumble? Do your worst
I couldn't be your friend
Even if I tried again
I couldn't be your friend (couldn't be your friend)
Try to conceal it, I won't believe it
Even if I tried again
I couldn't be your friend (couldn't be your friend)

Now you want to say you had it all wrong
Now you want to say you had me all wrong
Now you want to say you had it all wrong
Now you want to say you had me all wrong

I couldn't be your friend
Even if I tried again
I couldn't be your friend (couldn't be your friend)
Try to conceal it, I won't believe it
Even if I tried again
I couldn't be your friend (couldn't be your friend)
Try to conceal it, I won't believe it
Even if I tried again
I couldn't be your friend (couldn't be your friend)
