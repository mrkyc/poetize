Sit and watch my TV set
What is on will make it better (Will make it better)
I wanna call and ask, "What's up?"
Go to dial, but then I stop (Why don't you call?)

"To the end, my friend," oh, what a lie
Oh, what a lie
If I could pretend, if I could lie
If I could lie
But I can't say
No, I can't stay

I run, run, run, run, run away
Get, get, get, get, get away
I run, run, run, run, run away
Get, get, get, get, get away
But I'll be back someday
I'll be back someday

Like to read to you at night
Like to read 'til you feel better (Until you're better)
Now's the time for us to begin
Not the time for us to give in (It's not the time)
You might also like
"To the end, my friend," oh, what a lie
Oh, what a lie
If I could pretend, if I could lie
If I could lie
But I can't say
No, I can't stay

I run, run, run, run, run away
Get, get, get, get, get away
I run, run, run, run, run away
Get, get, get, get, get away
But I'll be back someday
I'll be back someday

Know that feeling when you're cold
How do you make it go away? (How do you make it go away?)
Know that feeling when you're cold
How do you make it go away? (How do you make it go away?)

"To the end, my friend," oh, what a lie (Lie, lie, lie, lie)
Oh, what a lie
If I could pretend, if I could lie (Lie, lie, lie, lie)
If I could lie
But I can't say
No, I can't stay
I run, run, run, run, run away
Get, get, get, get, get away
I run, run, run, run, run away
Get, get, get, get, get away
But I'll be back someday
I'll be back someday
But I'll be back someday
