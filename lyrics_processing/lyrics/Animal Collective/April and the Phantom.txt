When April passes by, she thinks of playing Bach
She tells her mother, I am not afraid
Of dying in the bath, or swinging from a beam
She asks her mother if she's slept with strangers
Phantom was a bride who'd white out
All the things her mother said
And whip her to a stain
In autumn, "Goodbye leaves"
And December, "Hello frost"
And mother would say
"Daddy I don't know where April went"

She ran out in nature
She ran out in nature
She ran out in nature
She ran out in nature, ah!
She ran out in nature
She ran out in nature

(She ran out in nature)
I found the Phantom, we roll across the river
We're hiding from our suffering
(She ran out in nature)
I like a chase so please take off my dress
And throw it to the suffering
(She ran out in nature)
What'd she find?
(She ran out in nature)
Where'd she go?
(She ran out in nature)
Phantom bride
(She ran out in nature)
April's home

Dad, everybody wants it
Mom, can't you see me wasting?

She ran out in nature
She ran out in nature

(She ran out in nature)
Without a bra I let her lick around
And take me from my suffering
(She ran out in nature)
Forgotten knees, I'm reaching for the stars
I'm begging, please no suffering
(She ran out in nature)
What'd she find?
(She ran out in nature)
Where'd she go?
(She ran out in nature)
Phantom bride
(She ran out in nature)
April's home

Dad, everybody wants it
Mom, can't you see me wasting?
I finally see a baby girl
I'm sorry April, but you'll be fine 'til then
I'm the panther
I'm the panther
I'm the panther
When I sleep around, and you're on top
A frenzy April, then we ride again
I'm the panther
I'm the panther
I'm the panther
And in the end, your mother knows
I'm sorry April, but a child grows
I'm the panther
I'm the panther
I'm the panther
I am
Watch me as I lead the way
From infancy to grown up babies

Phantom, please put on my makeup
I am breathing, I'll keep calling
Phantom, you're all white and naked
Have your baby, I'll keep calling
I'm not right, I'm not faking
And I'm burning, and I'm shaking
April, doll, you're disappearing
Now in death the end is nearing
April and the Phantom
They were just like lovers
Always sneaking kisses for the weekend
Everything's just okay with me
Everything's just alright with
April and the Phantom spoke in secret code
Until they buried Phantom by the road
Everything's just alright with me
Everything's just alright with Phantom
Everything's just alright with me
Everything's just alright with Phantom
Everything's just alright with me
Everything's just alright with Phantom
Everything's just alright with me
Everything's just alright with Phantom
Everything's just alright with me
Everything's just alright with me
