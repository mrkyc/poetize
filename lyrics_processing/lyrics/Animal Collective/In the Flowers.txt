(I'm a dancer, I'm a dancer
I'm a dancer, I'm a dancer
I'm a dancer, I'm a dancer
I'm a dancer, I'm a dancer

I'm a dancer, I'm a dancer
I'm a dancer, I'm a dancer
I'm a dancer, I'm a dancer
I'm a dancer, I'm a dancer
I'm a dancer, I'm a dancer
I'm a dancer, I'm a dancer
I'm a dancer, I'm a dancer
I'm a dancer, I'm a dancer
I'm a dancer, I'm a dancer
I'm a dancer, I'm a dancer
I'm a dancer, I'm a dancer
I'm a dancer, I'm a dancer

You might also like
Met a dancer
Who was high in a field from her movement
Caught my breath on my way home
Couldn't stop that spinning force
I felt in me
Everything around seemed to giggle glee
She walked up with a flower and I cared

Saw the dancer
Who gets wild to the beats of record rhythms
But I'm always away for weeks
That pass slow my mind gets lost
Feeling envy
For the kid who'll dance despite anything
I walk out in the flowers and feel better

If I could just leave my body for the night

Then we could be dancing
No more missing you while I'm gone
There we could be dancing
And you'd smile and say, "I like this song"
And when our eyes will meet then
We will recognize nothing's wrong
And I wouldn't feel so selfish
I won't be this way very long
To hold you in time
To hold you in time
To hold you in time
To hold you in time

While we were dancing
Early hours, drunken days finally ended
And the streets turned for a pillowcase
Then I fumbled our good lock
Then the ecstasy
Turns to rising light through our windowpane
