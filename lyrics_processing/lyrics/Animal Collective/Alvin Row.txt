Baby, love me now that you are born, oh! Baby!
Baby in your cradle look at me
Baby speak in rhythms now you're three
Ride your German Shepherd 'till you're five
Baby think the TV is alive
Baby spend the night out you're thirteen
Bending for a wish your candles lean
Baby bang erasers and wash the board
Think just yesterday you wore the sword
Watch your New Year's evening wash away
You're on the floor, can you hear me troubadour?

Alvin Row
Tangled in your broken kite
It's hard to be Ben Franklin but
You've been entrusted with the light
November weekends, step inside
Accustomed to the rust your silver child

Alvin Row
We're glad to see that you can fake it
White corn grows on every side but you can't take it
The yellow wardrobe suits you fine
Alvin, are these visions mine?
Let them do your makeup, I know
You might also like
Alvin Row
Half of them are on your side
The other figments, old
I picked the pigments of their skin
One dollar in the nightmare bin
My mind is not unkind, it's just not open

Alvin Row
I watched the mime cry in his wheelchair
Brown black bear, we'll let you be until you're fa-mous (Wow!)
Fa-mous (Wow!)
Fa-mous (Wow!)
Fa-mous (Wow!)

Tired of reaching
For the lampshade
Baby reading
Baby love me
Run! Run! Run! Run! Run! Run! Run! Run!

I told the baker's daughter that I didn't want the water
She only likes it when I beg, so I expect she's waiting
I told the baker's daughter that I didn't want their water
She only likes it when I beg, so I expect she's waiting
Row, Alvin Row, Alvin Row, Alvin Row, Row Alvin

I remember the day that I walked away from the city fight
Cars like demons and radio runs when there's nothing on
Words slip by when I'm silent, I have to let so many people down
Then the bell from the ice cream man comes to save the day
When winter comes we do no wrong where I belong
With chocolate shakes, the sun awakes, I play ping pong
The autumn clouds distort and crowd tobacco lawns
I pull the glass and trip to fast a soccer dawn
Swiftly passed through an age as we unlock a stage on my horror ride
I remember the shining, the spot, and the day she bled
Though I've never known Moses, I've known many noses with dots like mine
Take a drive to the Jacksonville pharmacy and pretend
That a new apartment and a heart don't make me old
'Cause I've spied on rage and middle age and I've been told
When I'm walking on a wire with eight other I's
I'll be sure and pick the best of the eight other sides

And when I stay shy, you stay shy, dear Alvin
And when I say bye, you say bye, dear Alvin
And when I say go, you say go, dear Alvin
And when I sing Row, you sing Row, dear Alvin
And when I stay shy, you stay shy, dear Alvin
And when I say bye, you say bye, dear Alvin
And when I say go, you say go, dear Alvin
And when I sing Row, you sing Row, dear Alvin
And when I say go, you say go, dear Alvin
Why that's funny! My voice didn't come back to me. I'll try it again. Hello? Hello?! Oh my goodness! Now my singing voice is gone!
My singing voice is gone!
My singing voice is gone!
My singing voice is gone!
My singing voice is gone!
My singing voice is gone!
My singing voice is gone!
