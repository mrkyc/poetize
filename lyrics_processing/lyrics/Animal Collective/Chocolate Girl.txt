When sight goes
I'll lead you around the excavation
Where grass grows
And remnants of you in implication
Your breath sounds
Inhaling a porch, in time it's frozen
In blue gowns
You trace along the house which you had chosen
While holding tightly
All sound is dead so sing in time and lie
When life meets child, your only plight, you'll lie
When ceilings smile, we'll sleep awhile and lie
I'll take you for walks among the patients

She had a pretty dad
But she was growing out of play-school
Still she could kick and scream and play until she wanted to
My little chocolate girl
Her brother barely out of high school
Lived in a place where he could scream until he wanted to
No fuzzy tabby cat
And she could bury him in apples
And curl around a roll of cotton 'til she wanted to
You might also like
But still she had to speak loud
'Cause hearing isn't high among the widows
She eats in
And picks her Sunday flowers from the garbage
And cries late
Still drinking with the boys from Argentina
And prays long
In hopes of something better for the children
And holding tightly
All sound is dead so sing in time and lie
When life meets child, your only plight, you'll lie
When ceilings smile, we'll sleep awhile and lie
I'll take you for walks among the patients

She met a pretty boy
And they would dance between their elders
And she would cream until the wine she bought had settled in
My little chocolate girl
She used to love the stars from England
She slept on records and hung marble jewelry from her skin
Her colors matched the room
And she would twirl around the curtains
She had a hand to hold her chin up when her friends let down
The kid across the street
Would peek around when she was changing
And he would wait and she would tell her friends about the boy
Her mother died at home
She had saliva in her pockets
She gave a groan when her last days had finally gave the date
So goodbye, chocolate girl
Oh won't you lick a name?

And put your lanterns on across the maze
So I won't feast on folly
You better love the rain, who brought the strings in, dear
And who will pop the drain 'cause I can't see you
I'll open up my brain again
So put your lanterns on across the maze
So I won't feast on folly
You better love the rain, who brought the strings in, dear
And who will pop the drain 'cause I can't see you
I'll open up my brain again
So put your lanterns on across the maze
So I won't feast on folly
You better love the rain, who brought the strings in, dear
And who will pop the drain 'cause I can't see you
I'll open up my brain again
So put your lanterns on across the maze
So I won't feast on folly
You better love the rain, who brought the strings in, dear
And who will pop the drain 'cause I can't see you
I'll open up my brain again
So put your lanterns on across the maze
So I won't feast on folly
You better love the rain, who brought the strings in, dear
And who will pop the drain 'cause I can't see you
I'll open up my brain again
And put your lanterns on across the maze
So I won't feast on folly
You better love the rain, who brought the strings in, dear
And who will pop the drain 'cause I can't see you
