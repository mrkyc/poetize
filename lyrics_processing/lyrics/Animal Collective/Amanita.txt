What will happen to the stories from the bogs?
The trails of the Vikings? The passing of sea sirens?
Is tradition holding regularly in this town?
If it's going hiking, then I'm going hiking

To the other places that we never had
Something like a misplaced teacher that is old and sad
With big, big raven

What will happen to that story telling clown?
His voice hypnotizing, the fire side frightening
I have to travel so far just to hear his sound
But I'm going hiking, are you coming hiking?

To the other places that we never had
Something like a misplaced teacher that is old and sad
To the other places that we never had
Something like a misplaced teacher that is old and sad

Fantasy is falling down
She's breaking apart, breaking apart
Has she lost her number 1?
Throws out her hands, throws out her hands
Let her tell what she can tell
There's nothing to do, nothing to do
Imagination floating around
There's nothing to do, there's nothing to do
Imagination floating around
Then build it back up, build it back up
Build it back up, build it back up
Big, big raven, big, big raven
Big, big raven, big, big raven
Big, big raven, big, big raven
Big, big raven, big, big raven
What have we done? What have we done?
Fantasy is falling down

Has she lost her number 1?
Throws out her hands, throws out her hands
Let her tell what she can tell
There's nothing to do, nothing to do
Imagination floating around
There's nothing to do, there's nothing to do
Imagination floating around
Then build it back up, build it back up
Build it back up, build it back up
