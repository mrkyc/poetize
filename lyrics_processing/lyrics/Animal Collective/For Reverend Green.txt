Whether or not you believe it, you are listening to true recordings of Bigfoot creatures in their natural environment
We know these are natural

From one moment to the next
Reading in the papers to know what's best
Sometimes you don't know yourself
Eating loads of vitamins for your health
And from one moment to the next
Red negativity in the street
Maybe it's the dirt, maybe it's the heat
A baby on the bus smiled at me so easy

Now I think it's alright we're together
Now I think that's a riot
And now I think it's the best you ever played it
Now I think that's a riot
Now I think it's alright to feel inhuman
Now I think that's a riot
And now I think it's alright, we'll sing together
Now I think that's a riot

A running child's bloody with burning knees
A careless child's money flew in the trees
A camping child's happy with winter's freeze
A lucky child don't know how lucky she is
You might also like
From one moment to a next
A thousand wasted Brooklyners are depressed
The ins and outs of supper's chest
He'll only be your friend if he touches your breasts
And from one moment to a next
A shifting in the plates of what you ingest
From sugared tits to honeyed pests
Bulimic vegetarian wins weight contest

And now I think it's alright we're together
Now I think that's a riot
And now I think it's the best we've ever played it
Now I think that's a riot
Now I think it's alright to feel inhuman
Now I think that's a riot
And now I think it's alright, we'll sing together
Now I think that's a riot

A running child's bloody with burning knees
A careless child's money flew in the trees
A camping child's happy with winter's freeze
A lucky child don't know how lucky she is
