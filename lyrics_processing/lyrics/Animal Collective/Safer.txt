Why am I so scared
At the shadows on the wall from yesterday?
I turn and tell my dad
I saw ghosts in the park wooing girls with cakes
And their moms are scared
'Cause they haven't been home in two or three days
Wind blows trees through the tops of my hair
I saw wolves in the fog, I can see through the rain
Oh, man and things have changed
In the snow filled lake where there used to be waves
I feel deranged
They're building beaches inside so it's sunny all May
I don't know, I think it's strange
'Cause I know we met before but I cannot place it
I don't know if there's any real danger
But the creatures all know that it's safer in the dark

Why am I so scared
Of explosions going off just any old way
I turn, ask is it that bad
They say we've much bigger problems, we got wolves on the plane
You might also likeAnd they left their den 'cause the cracks in the pipe's shootin' murky grays
They're running just as fast as the hares
They say you shouldn't leave a place
If you can eat there
Oh, man, and things have changed
In the snow filled lakes where there used to be waves
I feel deranged
They're building beaches inside so it's sunny all May
I don't know, I think it's strange
'Cause I know we met before but I cannot place it
I don't know if there's any real danger
But I'm alright if you're alright

I'm alright if you're alright
I'm alright if you're alright
I'm alright if you're alright
I'm alright if you're alright
I'm alright if you're alright
I'm alright if you're alright
I'm alright if you're alright
And I'm alright if you're alright
I'm alright if you're alright, man
And I'm alright if you're alright
I'm alright if you're alright
And I'm alright if you're alright
And I'm alright
I'm alright
I'm alright
I'm alright
I'm alright
I'm alright
I'm alright
She dabs her diamonds so they
Look like a decoy lover
Many fine costumes but they're not like mine
He said I'd kiss you, sometimes I
Don't wanna kiss you, don't mean I
Don't like to kiss you, just means these lips are mine
He kept on jerking, he kept on working
He got wrapped up in loving but
We opened him just in time
He said don't make your problems my funny problems
Because I've got problems but I'll cover them up in time
Don't make your troubles my funny troubles
Because I've got troubles
Why you talk about them all the time

They break me down
Sometimes I wanna eat him
Sometimes I just wanna meet him for a
Good meal but to eat you better win so loud
(They break me down)
Sometimes he just want a basement
Sometimes, man, he can never take it when he's
Down I look at you, he's deep inside his mind
Thinking about torture
Don't let it get you down
There's other ways to fight torture
I hope it gets you around
Shake it off with me, torture
Don't let it get you down
There's other ways to fight torture
I hope it gets you around
Man, now don't get too freaky on me
And it's torture
Don't let it get you down
There's other ways to fight torture
I hope it gets you around
Shake it off with me, torture
Don't let it get you down
There's other ways to fight torture
I hope it gets you around

Man, don't get too freaky on me
Torture, torture, torture, ba-deh
