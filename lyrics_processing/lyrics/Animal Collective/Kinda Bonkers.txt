Life is so French toast to me
If you wait too long
It gets black and weak
If there's fire that's good
But we can't burn it all away for food
Balance the light from the sky
To your seat on, on your feet
Through your errors and days

I'm tryna reach out to you
Yes, I'm talking to you
You're the one in the room
We'll share a moment, let's meet
We're a fire with heat
You didn't know, not me
We all start suddenly
And get carried so far away

Synchronicities
Obscurities
Complexities
It's like I knew this would be happening
I went, "Oh my, oh god, oh me, ooh wow!"

Don't you feel me, feel your heart shine?
Unity of all kind, unity of all kind
Don't you feel me, feel your heart shine?
Unity of all kind, unity of all kind
Don't you feel me, feel your heart shine?
Unity of all kind, unity of all kind

Don't you want to know?
Knowing a mama's nose
Mending woes, healing herbs
Dancing in a hoopla

Is bonkers
Kinda bonkers
Pretty bonkers
Kinda bonkers
Standing in line again
Laughing and then
Asking my friend
"Have you ever felt like

Really bonkers?
Kinda bonkers?
Pretty bonkers?
Kinda bonkers?"

Underwater show
I went to the bro
My head was exploding
I said, "Man this Earth is

Really bonkers
Kinda bonkers
Pretty bonkers
Kinda bonkers!"

Irrepressibility
Sustainability
Impossibility
What the fuck is happening?
I was like, "Oh man, oh Jesus, oh!"

Unity of all kind, unity of all kind
Don't you feel me, feel your heart shine?
Unity of all kind, unity of all kind
Don't you feel me, feel your heart shine?
Unity of all kind, unity of all kind

Don't you feel me, feel your heart shine?
Unity of all kind, unity of all kind

Unity of all kind, unity of all kind
Don't you feel me, feel your heart shine?
