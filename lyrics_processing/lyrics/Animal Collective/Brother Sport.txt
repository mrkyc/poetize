Open up your, open up your
Open up your throat
And let all of that time
All of that time, all of that time go
I know it sucks that Daddy's done
But try to think of what you want
You've got to open up your
Open up your, open up your throat
Matt

Open up your, open up your
Open up your, open up your
Open up your, open up your
Open up your, open up your
Open up your, open up your
Open up your, open up your
Open up your, open up your
Open up your throat

Open up your, open up your
Open up your throat
And let all of that time
All of that time, all of that time go
I know it sucks that Daddy's done
But try to think of what you want
You got to open up your
Open up your, open up your throat

You've got his way and what he said
To help you shape the way you play
You've got to get rid of the more
Conservative habits of your mind
You got to weigh all he said
He helped you shape the way you play
You've got to get rid of the more
Conservative habits of your mind
You got to weigh all he said
He helped you shape the way you play

Conservative habits of your mind
