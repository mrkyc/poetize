Lately I need a better plan
I want to get my knees out in the dirt with my hands
Cause I have been a cerebral spouse
And my head wants to go into the emerald house

And I want to look out, I don't want to bail out
And I want to help out, I don't want to nod out
And I want to help out, I don't want to bail out
And I want to look out, I don't want to nod out
I don't want to knock you down, I don't wanna knock you down
I don't want to knock you down, I don't wanna knock you down
I don't want to knock you down, I don't wanna knock you down
I don't want to knock you down, I don't wanna knock you down

But why am I still looking for a golden age?
You tell me that I ought to have a golden wage
Every time I look up at that blurry sun
All I think about are bodies floating up
Everybody ought to get that special glance
Why does dawn leave everybody home with chance?
It makes me wonder how I even wrote this song
Does this not occur to almost everyone?

I make a monkey wrench
I make a monkey rich
I make a monkey wrench
I make a monkey rich
I make a monkey wrench
I make a monkey rich
I make a monkey wrench
I make a monkey rich

And lately I want to be in my heart
But where exactly is my heart and where does it start?
(I don't want that Tylenol)
Can I sing and make waves without crushing clams?
I can help the little things but I have big plans
(I don't want that Tylenol)

So I want to look out, I don't want to bail out
And I want to help out, I don't want to nod out
And I want to look out, I don't want to bail out
And I want to help out, I don't want to nod out
I don't want to knock you down, I don't wanna knock you down
I don't want to knock you down, I don't wanna knock you down
I don't want to knock you down, I don't wanna knock you down
I don't want to knock you down, I don't wanna knock you down
But why am I still looking for a golden age?
You tell me that I ought to have a golden wage
Every time I look up at that blurry sun
All I think about are bodies floating up
Everybody ought to get that special glance
Why does dawn leave everybody home with chance?
It makes me wonder how I even wrote this song
Does this not occur to almost everyone?

I make a monkey wrench
I make a monkey rich
I make a monkey wrench
I make a monkey rich
I make a monkey wrench
I make a monkey rich
I make a monkey wrench
I make a monkey rich

Why am I still looking for a golden age?
You tell me that I ought to have a golden wage
Every time I look up at that blurry sun
All I think about are spirits floating up
Everybody ought to get that special glance
Why does dawn leave everybody home with chance?
It makes me wonder how I even wrote this song
Does this not occur to almost everyone?
I make a monkey wrench
I make a monkey rich
I make a monkey wrench
I make a monkey rich
I make a monkey wrench
I make a monkey rich
I make a monkey wrench
