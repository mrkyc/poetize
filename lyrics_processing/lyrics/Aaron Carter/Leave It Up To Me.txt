It's the kids, baby, it's the kids, baby
It's the kids, come on
It's the kids, baby, it's the kids, baby
And you know we're gonna groove
It's the kids, baby, it's the kids, baby
It's the kids, come on
It's the kids, baby
Leave it up, leave it up to me

Leave it to the kids; grown ups, own up
Even when they mess up, actin' like it's all sewn up
Mom and dad, think we need to have a talk
Let the kids rule the world, boys and girls
You can't blame us for nada
You taught us to follow orders
'Cause I'm the baby, dun gotta
Monkey see, ah ah, monkey do no more
The fun stops here, what's the score?
We might start a play fight just to imitate you
Don't ya feel silly now? Shame on you
Don't start to cry now, I don't blame you
After all, you're just a grownup, what ya gonna do?

Yo, it's the kids (Give it up, gotta heat it up, heat it up)
What's the deal? (Don't ya know I gotta give it up, give it up)
Make way (Put it on, gonna hook it up, hook it up)
How's that (Leave it up, leave it up to me)
Yo, it's the kids (What would ya do if I speed it up, speed it up?)
What, what (Set it off, gonna live it up, live it up)
Make way (Put it on, gonna hook it up, hook it up)
How's that (Leave it up, leave it up to me)

When the grownups go awol, nothing's gonna fall
Here come the young ones, the baby crime busters
Big people, listen up, relax now, we're equal
And if the money's right, then we might make a sequal
Do I hear a "please"? I love it when you beg me
I need a bribe now just to move my legs, see
And I might put you in if you make way
(Lemme talk to my people, we can save the day)

Yo, it's the kids (Give it up, gotta heat it up, heat it up)
What's the deal? (Don't ya know I gotta give it up, give it up)

Ow ow, ow ow
Ow ow, now what ya gonna do?

Mom and dad, they be gettin' on my nerves
Workin' and workin 'em, is that what I deserve?
But after many days, hey, I want them back
Tell me who's gonna bake my cake and all that
Who's gonna suffer from my practical jokes?
And answer when I'm mowing, hey, it's gotta be my folks
And who's gonna get me up, ready for the flight
And who's gonna tell me, "Everything's alright"
But wait a minute, that sounds so soft
That won't impress a hot chick like Lara Croft
Don't play me out 'cause I'll switch ya off
You've been told old for too long, singin' the same song
If you're old enough to vote, then it's time to sit down
It's all about the little homies takin' the crown
So if you're too young to vote, here's your chance to have a say
Come on everybody, help me save the day
Yo, it's the kids (Give it up, gotta heat it up, heat it up)
What's the deal? (Don't ya know I gotta give it up, give it up)
Make way (Put it on, gonna hook it up, hook it up)
How's that (Leave it up, leave it up to me)
Yo, it's the kids (What would ya do if I speed it up, speed it up?)
What, what (Set it off, gonna live it up, live it up)
