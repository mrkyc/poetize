Just when you thought it was safe
Shake, shake, shake

When I hit town you the party can't fail
I'm hittin' 20 on the richtor scale
Gotta hundred million people, spillin' coffee and stains
On your brand new shirt, ooh that reminds you of me
When you feel your gums flap, it's Aaron's rap
Watch yourself, I'm a rearrange your map
When your hands shake baby you ain't gettin' old
Its only Aaron Carter here to rock and roll

When I join hands I shake, shake, shake
All the things in my room I brake, brake, brake
All the guys and the girls I make, make, make
Make 'em drop it down, Shake it down, break it down
Here we go
When I join hands I shake, shake, shake
All the things in my room I brake, brake, brake
All the people out in Cali say "Not Another Earthquake!"
Drop down shake it down, break it down
Here we go

When I drove by I'ma shake the foundation
Rock the formation, what's your graduation?
Photos flyin' off the walls It's amazing
Oh no, trouble with the bass vibrations
Brace for impact of my new track
Take cover 'cause we're comin' through like that
All the other tracks are wickie-wickie whack
It's 2, double 0 2, time to react
From the east, to the west To the north, to the south
I'm hitting every angle Shakin' every house
No doubt, uh uh That's what I'm all about
I can't stop even if you scream and shout
Shakin' up your life like an earthquake right
Strap yourself in "Hold tight, hold tight"
Watch your momma's China, fly like a kite
Shakin' up your life everyday and every night

When I join hands I shake, shake, shake
All the things in my room I brake, brake, brake
All the guys and the girls I make, make, make
Make 'em drop it down, Shake it down, break it down
Here we go
When I join hands I shake, shake, shake
All the things in my room I brake, brake, brake
All the people out in Cali say "Not Another Earthquake!"
Drop down shake it down, break it down
Here we go
Ladies out in Cali say, "Not another earthquake"
Fellas out in Cali say, "Not another earthquake"
Ladies out in Cali say, "Not another earthquake"
You're wrong my friend it's Aaron Carter again

Gotta move baby because it hurts so good
Even with Nova Cane you couldn't numb the pain
If your sleepin' again I'm gonna shake you out of bed
Or instead gonna shake the confetti for newly weds
Dead in the water, I never did wrong
Comin' through the floor can't stop my song
I bring bass like Jamacains
If you ain't playin' this partner, I can shake the whole station

When I join hands I shake, shake, shake
All the things in my room I brake, brake, brake
All the guys and the girls I make, make, make
Make 'em drop it down, Shake it down, break it down
Here we go
When I join hands I shake, shake, shake
All the things in my room I brake, brake, brake
All the people out in Cali say "Not Another Earthquake!"
Drop down shake it down, break it down
Here we go
When I join hands I shake, shake, shake
All the things in my room I brake, brake, brake
All the guys and the girls I make, make, make
Make 'em drop it down, Shake it down, break it down
Here we go
When I join hands I shake, shake, shake
All the things in my room I brake, brake, brake
All the people out in Cali say "Not Another Earthquake!"
Drop down shake it down, break it down
