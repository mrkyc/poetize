Aaron: Let freedom flow as constant as the tides
Kayla: I pray with each sunset, don't forget to rise
Aaron: (Don't forget to rise)
Kayla: I live without regret
Both: For ordinary lives
Both: I'm lookin' at life through my own eyes
Searchin' for a hero to idolize
Feeling the pain as innocence dies
Looking at life through my own eyes
I'm hoping and praying for a brighter day
I listen to my heart and I obey
How can I see it any other way?
I'm looking at life (looking at life)
Through my own eyes
Aaron: I see a land with liberty for all
Kayla: Yet still I know the truth will rise and fall
Aaron: (Oooh yeah-yeh)
That's just the way it goes
Both: A word now to the wise
The world was made to change
Each day is a surprise
Both: Lookin' at life through my own eyes
Searchin' for a hero to idolize
Feeling the pain as innocence dies
Looking at life through my own eyes
I'm hoping and praying for a brighter day
I listen to my heart and I obey
How can I see it any other way?
Looking at life (looking at life)
Through my own eyes

Aaron (rap): I take my heart into battle
Give that freedom bell a rattle
Get my independence signed
Declare it on the dotted line
In Philidelphia freedom ring
And patriotic voices sing
Red White & Blue never give up
We represent America
Both: I'm lookin' at life through my own eyes
Searchin' for a hero to idolize
Feeling the pain as innocence dies
Looking at life through my own eyes
I'm hoping and praying for a brighter day
I listen to my heart and I obey
How can I see it any other way?
I'm looking at life (looking at life)
