So grab your stuff and let's all go outside
Bang your head to this tune in your ride
Leaving all you cares right behind
For the summertime
Everybody starts to feel the vibe
Drinks are in the cooler chilled on ice
Lay back and unwind cause nothing else matters
For the summertime

I've been working real hard for just one reason
I've been waiting all year for just one season
The season that reminds me of palm trees
The smell of the ocean breeze and the sense of being free
Barbecues and pool parties what I call fun
Hanging with the honeys and enjoying the sun
24 hours just to clean the Benz
So you can cruise down the boulevard with your friends

Sights on the beach have got your mind blowing
Drinks on the chill, the money is flowing
Right here is where you belong
So if you're down with me, get up and come along
You might also like
So grab your stuff and let's all go outside
Bang your head to this tune in your ride
Leaving all your cares right behind
For the summertime
Everybody starts to feel the vibe
Drinks are in the cooler chilled on ice
Lay back and unwind cause nothing else matters
For the summertime

Had to take a sip of Ma's homemade
Freshly squeezed lemonade
Check out the honeys in my brand new shades
As they lay on the sand, topping up on the tans
Take in the scenery the mood is fine
Nobody's wearing their watches, nobody's checkin' the time
There is only one thing that's on everybody's mine
That's the summer, the summer, the summertime

Sights on the beach have got your mind blowing

Right now we're going to bring it to you one time
Bang your head to this tune in your ride
Leaving all you cares right behind
Everybody is feeling the vibe
Of the summer, of the summer
Right now we're going to bring it to you one time
Bang your head to this tune in your ride
Leaving all you cares right behind

So grab your bags and let's go back inside
Bang your head to this tune in your ride
But didn't we have a good time?
Destinations home, that's where we're going
The drinks are gone and the cash stopped flowing
Say goodnight to all of your friends
Cause when tomorrow comes, we're gonna do it all again

So grab your stuff and let's all go outside
Bang your head to this tune in your ride
Leaving all your cares right behind
For the summertime
Everybody starts to feel the vibe
Drinks are in the cooler chilled on ice
Lay back and unwind cause nothing else matters
