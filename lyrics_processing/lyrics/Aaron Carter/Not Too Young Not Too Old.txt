Listen up everybody
This ain't Aaron's party
Part two, I'm older now
Come and show me body
Girl, whatcha gonna do
Come and talk to me in the backseat
Baby backstreet
We could surf the board
Surf the net, better yet
We could make a little bet
If we get together, yo, it's gonna be da bomb
Hit me all baby, Aaron Carter dot com
See when it comes to girls
I'm not too young
Babyface back upon the scene
But when I get in trouble
Hey, I'm not so old
I put my cap way down
And say I'm thirteen-years-old
That's how we roll
Throw your hands up now
Let the music take control
This is how we roll
I'm not too young, and I'm not too old
You might also likeHere we go
Throw your hands up now
Let the music take control
This is how we roll
I'm not too young, I'm not too old
It's A to the A to the are O N
I'm all growin' up now
Run and tell your friend
It's all sewn up now
Where do I begin?
Don't even playa hate
Tryin' to say I look ten
Imma tellin' you again
I'm all up in da video
Catch me in the studio
That's my life bro. It's in my blood
Hey, it ain't my fault
You want to step to me
We can take it to the asphalt
Shoot some hoops
Slam dunk the funk
Battle on the rollerblades
You're callin' me a punk
Bring on the skateboards
Or the BMX. Show me what you got
Is that all? Please, next
I'll wipe the floor with you
Where's the concentration
Don't even talk about the Sony PlayStation
I'll make it happen if it's games that you want
Aaron Carter got you open
Don't front, don't front
Let's roll
Throw your hands up now
Let the music take control
This is how we roll
I'm not too young, and I'm not too old
Here we go
Throw your hands up now
Let the music take control
This is how we roll
I'm not too young, I'm not too old
He's steppin' out with the older boys
Cover up your ears 'cause we're makin that noise
He's steppin' out with the younger girls
Cover up your eyes 'cause we rock the world
He's steppin' out with the older boys
Cover up your ears 'cause we're makin that noise
He's steppin out with the younger girls
Cover up your eyes 'cause we rock the world
See, when it comes to takin'
All the girls for a cruise in my ride
All I need is pillows
Hello. I'm not too young
My cellular rung
Switch it off, yo
Hit me on the pager
A real teenager, with a fake beard
Battin' in the majors
That's how we roll
And when it suits me
I'm anywhere between 12 and 18-years-old
Here we go
Throw your hands up now
Let the music take control
This is how we roll
I'm not too young, and I'm not too old
Here we go
Throw your hands up now
Let the music take control
This is how we roll
I'm not too young, I'm not too old
Here we go
Throw your hands up now
Let the music take control
This is how we roll
I'm not too young, and I'm not too old
Here we go
Throw your hands up now
Let the music take control
This is how we roll
