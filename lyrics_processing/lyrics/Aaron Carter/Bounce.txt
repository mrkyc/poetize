Bounce!
I wanna see you bounce!

Welcome to the party, this is one of a kind
Like a hot chilly pepper, it'll blow your mind
Don't know if you could take it, so now we're gonna shake it
And if you can't ditch it your in the house of reds
It's like this we got a crazy notion
The DJ's CD was a jumpy potion
So come on everybody, throw your hands in the air
We're givin' it uno, dos, thres, oh yeah

You gotta get up, to get it down
Come on, come on
When the DJ's kicks in and you feel the swing, you just can't stand around
You better get up, gonna funk around
Come on, come on
When you feel this thing let the fun begin
Don't stop now 'cause I wanna see ya bounce

Livin' it up 'cause we're here to party
With a bounce-e-bounce, gonna make ya happy
Play the disco bongo with me
And a bounce-e-bounce come and dance with me
Livin' it up 'cause we're here to party
With a bounce-e-bounce, gonna make ya happy
Play the disco bongo with me
And a bounce-e-bounce come and dance with me

Stop the tracks, can't you see it's not enough?
'Cause the vine of bliss is come in tough
They say, "Turn it down," but ya say, "No way"
'Cause the sound is pumpin' from the jigga-DJ
Crank it up 'cause we gonna subside
Generation of Millenium, we gonna rock it
So come on everybody, throw your hands in the air
We're givin' it uno, dos, thres, oh yeah

You gotta get up, to get it down
Come on, come on
When the DJ's kicks in and you feel the swing, you just can't stand around
You better get up, gonna funk around
