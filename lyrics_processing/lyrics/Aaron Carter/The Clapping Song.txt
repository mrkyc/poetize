3, 6, 9, the goose drank wine
The monkey chewed tobacco on streetcar line
The line broke, the monkey got choked
And they all went to heaven on a little row boat
Clap pat, clap pat, clap pat, clap slap
Clap pat, clap your hand
Pat it on your partner's hand, right hand
Clap pat, clap you hand
Cross it with your left arm
Pat your partner left palm
Clap slap, clap your hand
Slap your thigh and sing a little song

My momma told me if I was lucky
That she would treat me if I was goody
My aunty told her, I shoulda told her
No I'm not kidding, that's what she told her

3, 6, 9, the goose drank wine
The monkey chewed tobacco on streetcar line
The line broke, the monkey got choked
And they all went to heaven on a little row boat
Clap pat, clap your hands and prepare to pat
Clap, take your right arm
Pat your partner palm with your right palm
Clap, take your hand back and clap
Clap, take your right arm
Cross your right arm with your left arm
Pat your partner's left palm with your left palm
Clap, now back with a clap
Take your hand with your palm and slap your thigh
And watch the fun materialize as you sing this little song
