She like fancy cars, I got fancy cars too
She want a movie star, well I'm a movie star too
She wanna fall apart, just to know someone can pull her together
She wanna break my heart, knowing that no one can make it all better

What did you want to say, is that what you want to say
Before you walk away, is that all you want to say
What did you want to say, is that what you want to say
Before you walk away, is that all you want to say
Come on tell me, but you don't know me
Come on tell me, you don't love me, you can't love me

I've been getting on, are you getting on too
If I'm what you want, why you put it on you
She wanna leave a mark, just to know someone will always remember
She wanna break these hearts, but nothing and no one can make it all better

What did you want to say, is that what you want to say
Before you walk away, is that all you want to say
What did you want to say, is that what you want to say
Before you walk away, is that all you want to say
Come on tell me, but you don't know me
Come on tell me, you don't know me, you can't love me

You can't love me
You don't know me
You don't know me

What did you want to say, is that what you want to say
Before you walk away, is that all you want to say
What did you want to say, is that what you want to say
Before you walk away, is that all you want to say
Come on tell me, that you don't know me
Come on tell me, that you don't know me, you can't love me

What did you want to say, is that what you want to say
