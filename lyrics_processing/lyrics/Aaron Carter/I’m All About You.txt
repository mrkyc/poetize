There's something I've got to say
You're always with me even though you're far away
Talking to you on my cell
Just the sound of your voice
Makes my heart melt oh, girl
Well, it's true

I'm all about you
I'm all about us
No, baby, you never have to question my love
And every night there's a new crowd
But it's always you, I'm singing about
There is only one these words are going out to
Oh, girl, I'm all about you

I know you worry sometimes (Sometimes you worry)
Some other girl will make me forget your mine
There's not a doubt in this world (Doubt in this world)
That anyone could take the place of my number one girl
But it's true

I'm all about you
I'm all about us
No, baby, you never have to question my love
And every night there's a new crowd
But it's always you, I'm singing about
There is only one these words are going out to
Oh, girl, I'm all about you (Yeah, yeah)
You might also like
When I close my eyes I can see you
It's like you're right here
And these feelings only getting stronger
You're with me everywhere

I'm all about you
I'm all about us
No, baby, you never have to question my love
And every night there's a new crowd
But it's always you, I'm singing about
There is only one these words are going out to
Oh, girl, I'm all about you
(I'm all about you, I'm all about you)

I'm all about you
(I'm all about you, I'm all about you)
I'm all about you
(I'm all about you, I'm all about you)
I'm all about you
(I'm all about you, I'm all about you)
I'm all about you
(I'm all about you, I'm all about you)
I'm all about you
