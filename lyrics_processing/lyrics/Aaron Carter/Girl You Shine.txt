I see you every day
And I can't seem to think of anything to say
To you baby, how can it be?
That breaks my heart when you're smiling at me

The moment that I laid my eyes on you
I knew you'd be the one
To make my dreams come true

Girl you shine, like the reflections on the water
Girl you shine, like the sun in the sky
Girl you shine, like the moon does in the night-time
Girl you shine, like the stars in the sky

In you I see something I won't find
Never again, baby, you're always on my mind
If I could find a way to open up my heart
We'd be together, we'd not be apart

The moment that I laid my eyes my eyes on you
I knew you'd be the one
To make my dreams come true
You might also like
Girl you shine, like the reflections on the water
Girl you shine, like the sun in the sky
Girl you shine, like the moon does in the night-time
Girl you shine, like the stars in the sky

Girl I can't imagine being without you
And I know you're going to make my dreams come true
You know I'll never leave you
I'll never decieve you, I'll give you every piece of my heart
Girl you shine, shine, shine on me
Girl you shine, shine, shine on me
Girl you shine, shine, shine on me
Girl you shine, shine, shine on me

Girl you shine, like the reflections on the water
Girl you shine, like the sun in the sky
Girl you shine, like the moon does in the night-time
Girl you shine, like the stars in the sky

You're all I need to survive
And girl you keep me alive
And girl you shine
