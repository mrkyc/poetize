Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

If I threw a party, would you be there?
Would you bring your friends too?
'Cause why should we stay at home
When there's something better to do
It started in the house
And move it to the street
C'mon and follow me

And have some fun, with the funk
Turn up the bass and pop the trunk
This party's gonna bump
Be-bopping buddy bump, oh
Let's have some fun, with the funk
Turn up the bass and pop the trunk
This party is too short
So c'mon, get on board
And have some fun
Yeah, yeah, yeah

We all need a permanent vacation
From the things that get us down
So just turn it up and turn it out
'Cause it can never get too loud
Let's take it from the street
And move it to the beach
The sand beneath our feet

And have some fun, with the funk
Turn up the bass and pop the trunk
This party's gonna bump
Be-bopping buddy bump, oh
Let's have some fun, with the funk
Turn up the bass and pop the trunk
This party is too short
So c'mon, get on board
And have some fun
Yeah, yeah, yeah

There's no place I'd rather be
And it's no secret why
It would never mean as much to me
Without you you by my side
1!
Stop staring at the walls, all you girls and boys
It's time to make some noise!
1! 2! 3!
And have some fun, with the funk
Turn up the bass and pop the trunk
This party's gonna bump
Be-bopping buddy bump, oh
Let's have some fun, with the funk
Turn up the bass and pop the trunk
This party is too short
So c'mon, get on board
And have some fun
Yeah, yeah, yeah
And have some fun, with the funk
Turn up the bass and pop the trunk
This party's gonna bump
Be-bopping buddy bump, oh
Let's have some fun, with the funk
Turn up the bass and pop the trunk
This party is too short
So c'mon, get on board
And have some fun
