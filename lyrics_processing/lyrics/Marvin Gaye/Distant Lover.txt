Distant lover, lover (Lover, lover, lover)
Ooh, so many miles away, ooh
Heaven knows that I long for you
Every night, every night and sometimes I yearn through the day

Distant lover, ooh (Lover, lover, lover), lover
You should think about me, say a prayer for me
Please, please baby, think about me sometimes
Think about me here, here in misery
(Save me, baby, save me, baby, save me, baby)
Misery (Please, save me, baby, please)

(Baby) As I reminisce, ah baby
Through our joyful summer together
(Oh, baby) The promises we made
All the daily letters
Then all of a sudden
Everything seemed to explode (Wow)
Now I gaze out my window
Sugar, down a lonesome road

Distant lover (Lover, lover, lover), ooh sugar
How can you treat my heart so mean and cruel? Didn't you know, sugar
That every moment that I spent with you (Every moment)
I treasured it (Every moment) like it was precious jewel, ah baby
(Save me, baby, save me, baby, save me, baby)
Lord, have mercy (Please, save me, baby, please), ooh
You might also like
Oh baby, don't go
Please, come back, baby
Something I want to say (Lover, lover, lover)
When you left, you took all of me with you
My Lord, I wonder, do you want to hear me scream, plead and plead, "Please"? (Every moment)
Oh please, baby (Every moment)
Come back home, little girl (Every moment)
Oh, baby (Every moment)
