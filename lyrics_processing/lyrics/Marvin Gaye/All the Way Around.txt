Oh, if you want to do it, let's get it on
But how you going to act this time around?
Before we take it off down to the skin
Let's get an understanding
Girl, you didn't understand my philosophy
You did not understand
You just ran away from me

Oh, I missed you, baby (All the way around, girl)
Ooh, I missed you bad
I missed you (All the way around, girl)
You're the best I ever had
You're so bad, baby (All the way around, girl)
But I must like you like that (All the way around, girl)
Although you won't let me control this or that (Back to me, my baby)
I still find you're where it's at

Ah, now I see you're coming straight to the point
(I know you want what you see, pretty girl)
You say the more you get, baby, ah, the more you want me
Yeah, darling, you're not wasting my time
(You're not wasting my time, pretty girl)
What I see, baby, is so hard to find
You might also like
(Baby, you went around) Although you've been all over town, baby
(Baby, you went around) Having your affairs, I still got to accept you back
(Baby, you went around) Angel, though you're promiscuous
(Baby, you went around) I don't mind a bit
(Baby, you went around) 'Cause you're still the greatest lay in bed, (Baby, you went around, baby) You're miles ahead

Girl, if you run away again (All the way around and back, girl)
Surely my heart would never mend
Don't tell me the love we made (All the way around and back, girl)
Was just for old times' sake
Say the pain I put on your mind (All the way around and back, girl)
Was just so hard to take
She said that pain might never mend (All the way around, girl)
So let's be sometime lovers (And back to me)
And oh, baby, that's when my poor heart broke up

So if you got a girl and you want her for your wife
(All the way, all around, girl, and never let me down)
You got to treat her good and love her all her life, mm
Well, if you've got a girl and you want her for your wife
(All the way, all around, girl, and never let me down)
You got to treat her good and love her all her life
If you've got a pretty girl and you want her for your wife
(All the way, all around, girl, and never let me down)
You got to treat her good and love her all her life
If you've got a pretty girl and you want her for your wife
(All the way, all around, girl, and never let me down)
You got to love her good all her life, baby
If you've got a girl and you want her for your wife
(All the way, all around, girl, and never let me down)
