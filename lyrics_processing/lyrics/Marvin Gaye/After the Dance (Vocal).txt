Ah, dance with me
Come on, dance with me, baby
Dance with me
Come on, dance with me, baby
Dance with me
Come on, dance with me, baby
Dance with me
Come on, dance with me, baby

I want you
And you want me
So why don't we
Get together after the dance
All right, ooh (Ah, what a freak!)

Ooh, when I first saw you (Pretty girl, saw you smile)
(Looking good on Soul Train)
You was looking good on Soul Train
So good (Oh, I)
That I came back at you (I was lookin' for you)
And I saw you there (Sweet and so fine)
You was dancing good (Then there she was)
Spinnin' everywhere, baby (Tantalizing)
You might also like
I thought to myself (Ooh, on the floor)
She is so fine (I started to dance)
The way she moves, she's so fine
She's moving so freakishly (I wonder if she)
Ah, what she needs is me (If she'd go for me)

I want you
And you want me
So why don't we
Get together after the dance?

And while we dance
Let's record, baby (Let's record, girl)
You were so in time (Felt so fine)
The way you move me (Move next to me)
Warm eyes told me one thing (Big brown eyes and  thighs)
Oh, baby
There is good vibes between you and me (Vibrations, you wanted me)

That you needed my sweet lovin', baby
And nobody else, girl
Nobody's but my love, baby
That's how I feel about you (Can satisfy all of your desires)
I want you to take me with you (Please, baby)
What you're gonna do?
I want you (Oh, I want you)
And you want me (Oh, you want me)
So why don't we (So why don't we)
Get together after the dance? (Get together after the dance)
Alright, ooh

Dance with me (Doin' it, baby)
Dance with me, baby (Saw you groovin', now)
Dance with me (Spinnin' around)
Dance with me, baby (Oh, baby)
Dance with me (She's caught my eye)
Dance with me, baby
Dance with me (Things have crossed my eye)
Dance with me, baby (Hey, baby)

Ooh, I want you
And you want me
So why don't we
Get together after the dance?
Ah, baby

And you want me
So why don't we
Get together after the dance?
(We've got to get together, baby)
I want you (Get to know you, baby)
And you want me
So why don't we
Get together after the dance?
(No, I don't want your number, baby)
Oh, I want you (I'm walkin' out of here with you, baby)
And you want me (Oh, take me with you, now)
So why don't we (We've got to)
Get together after the dance?
Oh, I want you (Please baby, yeah)
And you want me (You got to take me with you)
So why don't we (Don't you know I love you, baby?)
Get together after the dance? (Ah, get it together after the dance)
