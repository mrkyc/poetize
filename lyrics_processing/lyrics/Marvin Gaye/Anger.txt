It injures me, babe (Anger)
Anger, can make you old (Anger), yes it can
I said anger will make you sick, children (Oh, Jesus)
Anger destroys your soul
Rage, there's no room for rage in there
There's no room for rage in here
Line up some place to go to be mad
It's a sin to treat your body bad
When anger really gets the best of us
We've really lost our heads
We often say a lot of things, oh darlin'
Wish we'd never said
Oh, reason is beyond control
And the things we do for spite
Makes me ashamed and I mean this, baby
Makes me want to the things right
Someday soon, I hope and pray like Jesus
I'll reach that wiser age
Hope I will learn I really never, never profit (Anger)
From things I do in rage
One more time-anger, oh anger
When it's flaming hot
Anger burns to the bitter end
Know what I'm talkin' 'bout
Woo, you know when it cools, I find out too late
I have lost at love, love, love, dear friend
You might also likeI said, anger will make you sick, children, (Oh, Jesus)
Anger destroys your soul
I ain't gonna let you get the best of me, babe
I'm gonna go somewhere and cool
This is not the way my head's supposed to be, babe
You've got me feelin' like some silly fool
But I know a real nice place where I can go
And feel the way I'm supposed to feel
I don't want to be mad at nobody
I don't want to be feelin' bad
Up and down my back, my spine, in my brain
It injures me, babe (Anger)
Anger, can make you old (Anger), yes it can (Oh)
I said anger will make you sick, children (Oh, Jesus)
Anger destroys your soul (Ooh)
Anger
Anger
