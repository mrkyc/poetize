Ah listen everybody (Everybody), especially you girls (Especially you girls)
Is it right to be left alone
While the one you love is never home?
I love too hard (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah), my friends sometimes say (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
But I believe, I believe (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
That a woman should be loved that way
But it hurts me so inside
To see her treat me so unkind
Somebody, somewhere, tell her it's unfair

Can I get a witness? (Can I get a witness?) Can I get a witness? (Can I get a witness?)
Can I get a witness? (Can I get a witness?) Somebody (Can I get a witness?)

Is it right to be treated so bad
When you've given everything you had?
Even tossing in my sleep
'Cause I haven't seen my baby all week
Now, you chicks do agree
That this ain't the way love's supposed to be
Let me hear you, let me hear you say yeah, yeah
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Up early in the morning with her on my mind
Just to find out all night that I've been crying
But I believe a woman's a man's best friend
So I'm going to stick by her 'til the bitter end
But she caused so much misery
That I forget how love's supposed to be
Somebody, somewhere, tell her it ain't fair
Can I get a witness?

Witness, witness (Can I get a witness?), witness, witness (Can I get a witness?)

Everybody knows, especially you girls
A love can be sad
But half of a love is twice as bad
Now, all you chicks agree
That this ain't the way it's supposed to be
Let me hear you, let me hear you say yeah, yeah, yeah

I want a witness
I want a witness
Come on, witness (Can I get a witness?)
I want a witness (Can I get a witness?)
Just a little bit louder (Can I get a witness?)
Louder, hey (Can I get a witness?)
Oh yeah (Can I get a witness?)
