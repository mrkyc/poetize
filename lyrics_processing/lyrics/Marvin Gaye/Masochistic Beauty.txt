Get your ass in gear
Come closer here
See your passion sweat
Now is it wet?
I'll jam you 'til you faint
You're no saint
I'll rock you 'til your sore
Like a whore
Forget that closet scene
I'm so mean
I'll throw you on the floor
Like before
You say it's not your thing
But still you come
You say you hate my guts
Still want some
You silly little freak
Tryin' to rise
The devil's strong in you
It's in your eyes
The thing that's deep in you
You can't resist
I'm gonna tie you up and have my wish
You do not understand but still you love
The way you worship it is all your thinking of
Everybody knows the thing you love
While you're on your knees
Raise your dress above..
Get down...
You might also like
...Shut up
You nasty little slave, kiss my feet
Put your face right here and start to eat
Get down...
Shut up...
Get down...
Get up!
If you do it right, you get the pipe
And if you do it wrong, I'll spank you long
I love you, my masochistic beauty
I love you, I love your booty
I love it, my masochistic beauty... Yes
I love you, I love your booty
And it's my duty to spank your booty
And it my duty to spank your booty

It's my duty
To spank your booty

I love you
Got to learn
Shutup!
Get down
Get up
Get down
Get up
I know about your thing
You hate yourself
You selfish little bitch
You're in poor health
I'll use you till you moan
And cry so hard
Your guilt becomes your key
To turn to God
Although I am a part of this
Like you
I am a master man
With work to do
You must obey my will
Or face my rod
'Cause if you can't for me
You can't for God
Get down
Get up!
Get down
Get up!
Bitch, are you coming?
Get down
Deception is your game
You've been had
All your men are glad
And you are sad
Most of them were rich
But you are poor
Yet you take their cum
For nothing more
Seems that you're delighted
To fuck fate
You're looking for a way
To close the gate
The things you know you
Should you never do
Despite all the pain
It takes you through
