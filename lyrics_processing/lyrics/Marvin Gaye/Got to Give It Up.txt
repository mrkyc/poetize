And stand around
Cause I was too nervous
To really get down
But my body yearned to be free
I got up on the floor and thought
"Somebody could choose me"
No more standin' there beside the walls
I done got myself together, baby
And now I'm havin' a ball
As long as you're groovin'
There's always a chance
Somebody watchin'
Might wanna make romance
Move your body, ooo baby, and dance all night
To the groove and feel alright
Everybody's groovin' on like a fool
But if you see me spread out and let me in
Baby just party high and low
Let me step into your erotic zone
Move it up
Turn it 'round
Shake it down
Oooww!!
