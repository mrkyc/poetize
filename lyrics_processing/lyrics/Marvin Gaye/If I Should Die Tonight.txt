Oh, If I should die tonight, oh baby
Though it be far before my time
I won't die blue, sugar, yeah
'Cause I've known you

Ooh, oh, how many eyes have seen their dream?
Oh, how many arms have felt their dream?
How many hearts, baby
Have felt their world stand still? Ooh

Millions never
They never, never
And millions never will, baby
They never will, woo

If I should die tonight, love
Darlin', far before my time
I won't die blue
'Cause I've known you, ooh

I'm so grateful, baby, grateful that you're loving me, my desire
Is to love you 'til I'm no longer here and never tire
Love has been so good to me, me now
I'm so thankful, ooh-ooh

How many eyes have seen their dream?
How many arms have felt their dream?
How many hearts, oh darling
Have felt their world stand still? Oh, Lord

Oh, millions never
No, never never
And millions never will, sugar
They never will

If I should die tonight, oh, baby
I just want you to keep this one thought in mind
That I will never die blue
'Cause I've known you
