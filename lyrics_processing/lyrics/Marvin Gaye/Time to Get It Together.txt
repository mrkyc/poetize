Jesus said time would heal all wounds!
(Time, time)
(Time, time)
But we have to live right to get the time
(Time, time)
(Time, time)
(Time, time)
(Time, time)
(Time, time)
Please, you got to be a friend of mine
(Sometimes I'm ready to groove and then sometimes I'm unable to move)
Sometimes I am unable to move
(Sometimes I'm ready to groove and then sometimes I'm unable to move)
I let temptation get me off of my groove

Sometimes I get it
Sometimes it's hard to stay with it
Ooh, oh but right now, baby

(Tick tock tick tock tick tock tick tock -
My life's a clock and it's winding down)
I've been racing against time
Trying my best to find my way
Change our world in just one day
Blowin' coke all up my nose
Gettin' in and out my clothes
Foolin' 'round with midnight hoes (Wine, wine and dine)
But that chapter of life's closed
From the day you're born
'Til the day you're in the ground
(Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock, tick tock)
I've been racing against time
Trying my best to find my way
Change our world in just one day
Blowin' coke all up my nose
Gettin' in and out my clothes
Foolin' 'round with midnight hoes (Wine, wine and dine)
But that chapter of life's closed
From the day you're born
'Til the day you're in the ground
(Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock, tick tock)
I've been racing against time
Trying my best to find my way
Change our world in just one day
Blowin' coke all up my nose
Gettin' in and out my clothes
Foolin' 'round with midnight hoes (Wine, wine and dine)
But that chapter of my life's closed
