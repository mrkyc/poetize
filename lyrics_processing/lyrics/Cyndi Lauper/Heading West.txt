I drop my hat to a restless wind
Ooh, this time I'm not gonna chase it again
In a jigsaw dream with soft spoken words
I woke up crying and no one heard

You're looking through me like I never was real
You say you love me but you won't let me feel
So I'm gonna take a chance this time
Find myself some place where I can heal

And I'm heading west
Without a sad goodbye
And I'm heading west, woah-oh-oh
I'm like a letter with no address
Just like a book I read
I'm heading west

I said my name under my breath
Oh, he turned down a twisted road, I won't forget
I'm gonna fly my kite and let out all of the string
Hold on to hope, let go everything

I can't stop laughing and it's nothing you said
The altitude of freedom seems to go to my head
And if I fall down on my knees, I'm gonna get back up
I'm gonna get back up again

And I'm heading west
Without a sad goodbye
And I'm heading west, woah-oh-oh
I'm like a letter with no address
Just like a book I read
I'm heading west

And if I fall down on my knees
I'm gonna get back up
I'm gonna get back up

And I'm heading west
Without a sad goodbye
And I'm heading west, woah-oh-oh
I'm like a letter with no address
Just like a book I read
I'm heading west
And I'm heading west
Without, oh, a sad goodbye
And I'm heading west, woah-oh-oh
I'm like a letter with no address
Just like a book I read
I'm heading west
And I'm heading west
Without a sad goodbye
And I'm heading west, woah-oh-oh
