I was folding up your letters, unpacking winter clothes
Searching for my hat, I thought I'd left it by the door
So I tore around the room like a bird without a head
I saw your picture waving back at me from underneath the bed
From a long, long time ago

When all I had was a hat full of stars
The one I'll always treasure
The one that you wore
You loved the look but you never looked inside
You would have seen us there
You could've seen far
You should've seen the magic
In my hat full of stars

I'm trying to live in the present, but I keep tripping on the past
Finding out reality - well, clarity, comes in drips and drabs
No, we never had the time for everything we had
So it felt like we had nothing, that's what makes this hat so sad
It was a long, long time ago

When all we had was a hat full of stars
The one I'll always treasure
The one that you wore
You loved the look, but you never looked inside
You would have seen us there
You could've seen far
You should've seen the magic
In my hat full of stars

Now whenever I'm alone and I think I might forget
I wear my lucky hat just like a crown up on my head

'Cause all I had was a hat full of stars
The one I'll always treasure
The one that you wore
You loved the look, but you didn't look inside
If you could see me now
You would've seen far
You should've seen the magic
In my hat full of stars
In my hat full of stars
In my hat full of stars
