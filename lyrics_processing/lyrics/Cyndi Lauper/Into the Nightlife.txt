Got this endless itch to ride
Into the night
Fortune cookie says I'm right
Kung Fu-like

Shake your body, mister
Gonna make ya body blister
Say hey hey hey
Don't wanna have to make you
I don't wanna have to shake you down
Hey Hey Hey

I'll take you 'til you all spun up
Pitter, patter, doesn't matter what you got
I'll take you 'til you all spun up
And in love, into the nightlife
I'll take you 'til you all spun up
Turn you over baby 'til its never enough
I'll take you 'til you all spun up
And in love, into the night
Like love, into the nightlife

Want to dress for you tonight
Under the light
Shot up like a satellite
Into the night
See Cyndi Lauper LiveGet tickets as low as $94You might also like
Shake ya money maker
I will never be a faker now, hey hey hey
Leave them standing, waiting
Till they're practically fainting now, hey hey hey

I'll take ya 'til you all spun up
Pitter, patter, doesn't matter what you got
I'll take you 'til you all spun up
And in love, into the nightlife
I'll take ya 'til you all spun up
Turn you over baby 'til its never enough
I'll take ya 'til you all spun up
And in love, into the night
Like love, into the nightlife

Shirtless wonders wreck my sight
Shirtless wonders wreck my sight
Under the light

I'll take you 'til you all spun up
Pitter, patter, doesn't matter what you got
I'll take you 'til you all spun up
And in love, into the nightlife
I'll take you 'til you all spun up
Turn you over baby 'til its never enough
I'll take you 'til you all spun up
And in love, into the night
Like love, into the nightlife
Shirtless wonders wreck my sight
