Things like this
Can always take a little time
I always thought
We'd be together down the line
We start to fight
And can't get over what was said
'Cause you see black and white
And I see red

And I wonder who let in the rain
You know without you
I'm not the same
When love gets strong
People get weak
Sometimes they lose control
And wind up in too deep
They fall like rain
Who let in the rain?

I make the bed and cover
Where you used to sleep
I'm smoothing over promises
Made in these sheets
I envy lovers passing by
Out on the street
'Cause what they have
I couldn't keep

And I wonder who let in the rain
You know without you
I'm not the same
When love gets strong
People get weak
Sometimes they lose control
And wind up in too deep
They fall like rain
Who let in the rain?
Who let in the rain?


And I wonder who let in the rain
You know without you
I'm not the same
When love gets strong
People get weak
Sometimes they lose control
And wind up in too deep
They fall like rain (Fall like rain)
Who let in the rain?

Who let in the rain?
Who let in this rain?
Who let in the rain, ah-ha
(Who let in the, who let in the, who let in the)
Who let in the rain?
Who let in this rain?
(Who let in, who let in, who let in the rain?)
Who let in the rain, who let in the rain?
Who let in the rain?
Who let in the, who let in the, who let in the, who let in the
Who let in the rain?
