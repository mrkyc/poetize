You like a bad habit and I can't have it
You blocking me it's like a fire hazard
I need to get away from you
You got a lot of baggage, I can't keep packing
We're steady clashing, I need to get pass this
You walk around with a chip on your shoulder
And acting like the whole world just owes you
You push me back when I try to get closer
Another day that I'm wishing is over
We have a daughter and one on the way
We got these bills that haven't been paid
I used to think everythang was okay
But now I see that we ain't on the same page
I need to get away from you
You like a bad habit and I can't have it
You blocking me it's like a fire hazard
I need to get away from you
You got a lot of baggage, I can't keep packing
We steady clashing, I need to get pass this
Everyday you seem to grow much colder
And now I'm thinking that you might be bipolar
You wanna fight under any condition
And now the neighbors know all our business
You try to keep me from my mamma and daddy
It makes you feel good when I'm not happy
If I leave you said I wasn't gon make it
But I'd be crazy if I sit here and take it
You might also likeI need to get away from you
You like a bad habit and I can't have it
You blocking me it's like a fire hazard
I need to get away from you
You got a lot of baggage, I can't keep packing
We steady clashing, I need to get pass this
Gotta get away from you, so tired of your attitude
If I were to stay everything will still remain
