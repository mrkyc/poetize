Yea
Birdman, always priceless
Cash Money, Young Money
New money, swagged out
Uptown we in the buildin'

I want it all, I want it all, I want it all
I want it all, I want it all, I want it all
I want it all, I want it all, I want it all

Ride fly always on chrome
Birds fly count when we get home
Big money in the garbage can
New money every time we land
Big houses, new cars, uptown, third wall
On the wall with platinum plaques
In the club throwin' hundred stacks
She fly, my kind, and I brought her inside
She saw the marble floors, poppin' bottles blowin' dro
She like just how I live, private jets from Beverly Hills
Hundred mills on the platinum floor
Hundred mills, my son can glow
You might also like
I want it all, I want it all, I want it all
I want it all, I want it all, I want it all
I want it all, I want it all, I want it all

I want the world, you want the pussy
I want the pearl, I want the life, I want tonight
My fruits of labor, I want 'em ripe
That's right private flight
Money get stacks to the highest height
Better get your math and science right
But I want the drama, guided light
I-I-I want the hype but I don't believe it
I want it all but I know I don't need it
Man, I just want what's cool and I want you

I want it all, I want it all, I want it all
I want it all, I want it all, I want it all
I want it all, I want it all, I want it all
Yeah, big diamond rings, yeah, yeah (I want it all)

Diamond face, hundred on one streak
Everyday, do it like it's no sleep
'Round the way, choke 'cause we got heat
Hundred G's in the chopper, new fleet
No money, never get no time
Get money, stay on a nigga mind
Priceless strapped on a nigga street
Uptown Y-M-C-M-B, gotta get it
Fuck crime, get money all the time
Gotta know 'bout-me, Birdman, OG
Harley Davis do it to the sunshine
Tattoos, bloodline on mine
Billionaires, that's what it 'bout, nigga
Billionaires, we get loud, nigga
I want it all, I want it all, I want it all
I want it all, I want it all, I want it all
I want it all, I want it all, I want it all
