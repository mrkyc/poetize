I am unable to cope with this financial shituation
That is causing inflation upon creation
I can't stand this no longer
The wicked get stronger
I can't stand this no longer
'Cause the battle is getting hotter
Chorus:
But dem ha fe get a beatin'
The wicked ha fe get a beatin' (yeah)
Them must get a beatin' (yeah)
The wicked ha fe get a beatin' (yeah)
Now that you waited
'Til you back is against the wall
One step to progress my brother
And I know Jah will help you all
Chorus:
And dem ha fe get a beatin' (lord)
Them must get a beatin' (yeah)
Dem ha fe get a beatin' (I say)
And dem can't get away
You might also likeI can't stand this no longer
The wicked get stronger
I can't stand this no longer
'Cause even cockroach get nuffer
Chorus:
Me said them ha fe get a beatin' (yeah)
Dem must get a beatin' (lord)
Dem ha fe get a beatin' (yeah)
Dem must get a beatin'
Tell me how long
Must the good suffer for the bad
And every time the good open his mouth
The bad say "You must be mad!"
Chorus:
Dem ha fe get a beatin' (lord)
Them must get a beatin' (yeah)
Dem ha fe get a beatin' (lord)
And them can't get away, yeah
I can't stand this no longer
Now that you waited so long
'Til you back is against the wall
If you make one step to progress
I know Jah will help you all
Chorus:
But dem ha fe get a beatin' (yeah)
Them must get a beatin' (lord)
Dem ha fe get a beatin' (brother)

The wicked get so strong
I can't stand this no longer
Everything seem to be wrong
Chorus:
Dem ha fe get a beatin' (lord)
Dem must get a beatin' (yeah)
Dem ha fe get a beatin' (lord)
