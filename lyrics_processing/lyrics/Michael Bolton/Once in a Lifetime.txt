Some people fill their lives with empty nights
And days that slip away
Some search till the end of time
But never find the open arms of fate
One moment comes along
Someone who's a dream to you
And all at once your dreams come true

Once in a lifetime you find the one you really love
For now and forever one love that never ends
Once in a lifetime, when every star that lights the sky
Will shine with one reason, leading your heart to the one
Love you find just once in a lifetime

Some people live their lives in compromise
And hide their dreams away
Some never take the chance within their hands
To claim the prize they make
When faith is all you need
To hold the hand of destiny
To find the love that's meant to be

Once in a lifetime you find the one you really love
For now and forever one love that never ends
Once in a lifetime, when every star that lights the sky
Will shine with one reason, leading your heart to the one
Love you find just once in a lifetime

Once in a lifetime
