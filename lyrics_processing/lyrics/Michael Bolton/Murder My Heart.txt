Don't wanna let this moment slip away
Cause I... have something that I really need to say
And it's killing me inside
I think that you don't understand
How I... would give you all I have and all I am
Till the end of time
You got me defenseless, intoxicated senseless
You cut me so deeply, I must confess

Baby I can't breath, when my arms around you
Baby it kills me cause now that I found you
Your love is like a weapon girl, I can't live without you
You're so beautiful, it's tearing me apart
You murder my heart... oh
You murder my heart... oh yeah

I need to catch my breathe with you sometimes
Cause I... get dizzy when your body's touching mine
Girl you're killing me inside
The way you move is much too sexy baby
So I... surrender to your hands, your lips, your taste
And I'm telling you tonight
