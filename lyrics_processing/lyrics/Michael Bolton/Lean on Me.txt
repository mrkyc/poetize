Sometimes in our lives
We all have pain
We all have sorrow
But, if we are wise
We know that there's
Always tomorrow
Oh yeah

Lean on me
When you're not strong
I'll be your friend
I'll help you carry on
For it won't be long
'Til I'm gonna need somebody to lean on

Please swallow your pride
If I have things
You need to borrow
For no one can fill those of your needs
That you won't let show

Just call on me, brother
When you need a hand
We all need somebody to lean on
I just might have a problem
That you'd understand
We all need somebody to lean on
