You are the candle, and love's the flame
A fire that burns through wind and rain
Shine your light on this heart of mine
'Til the end of time
You came to me like the dawn through the night
Just shinin' like the sun
Out of my dreams and into my life
You are the one, you are the one

Said I loved you, but I lied
'Cause this is more than love I feel inside
Said I loved you, but I was wrong
'Cause love could never ever feel so strong
Said I loved you, but I lied

With all my soul, I've tried in vain
How can mere words this heart explain
This taste of heaven so deep, so true
I've found in you, oh yeah
So many reasons in so many ways
My life has just begun
I need you forever, well, I need you to stay
You are the one, you are the one

You came to me like the dawn through the night
Just shinin', shinin' like the sun
Out of my dreams and into my life
You are the one, you are the one

Said I loved you, but I lied (Said I loved you, but I lied)
'Cause this is more than love I feel inside (Said I loved you, but I lied)
Said I loved you, but I was wrong (Said I loved you, but I'm wrong)
'Cause love could never ever feel so strong (Ooh)

Said I loved you (Said I loved you)
