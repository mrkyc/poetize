We may be strangers, we may be worlds apart sometimes
And it's hard to accept the things, we just don't understand
Yeah, so blind to each other, we only see one side of nowhere
Some things we may never know
There's one thing you should ever know

Soul of my soul, heart of my heart
The greatest treasure of my life that's what you are
Soul of my soul, child of my heart
I love you more than you know, soul of my soul

Into this world we come with a heart, that's open wide
And the best of this life is all I ever want for you
I love you, believe in your every dream, your every passion
In time, I know you'll come to see, nothin' means as much to me

Soul of my soul, heart of my heart
Some kind of miracle of life that's what you are
Soul of my soul, child of my heart
I love you more than you know, soul of my soul

There'll come a time when you'll be on your own
But in your heart you're never far from home
Every road you take, your every living day
You will always be, you will always be
Soul of my soul
