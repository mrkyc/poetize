Baby, show me what you feel
Come to me, show me somethin' real
I need to know, I need you completely (closer, baby, closer)
Come on closer, baby (let's begin)
Love is takin' over, gotta let it in
Ooh and I need to feel the heart of you
I need to reach the very deepest part of you

Can I touch you there?
Touch you deep inside
Can I touch your heart?
The way you're touchin' mine
Can I touch you there?
Touch you deep within, oh
Can I touch you there?
Can I touch you? oh... (there)

Baby, tell me with your eyes
Tell me every secret, darlin'
Every deep desire, till you and I
Are makin' love completely (closer baby, closer)
Come on closer, baby (can't be close enough)
I can't help the way I hold you
I just hunger for your love (and I need to feel)
