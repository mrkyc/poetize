I can still remember when all I had was time
A time when I had nothing but this empty heart of mine
When I needed inspiration, when the night was all I knew
You were the light shinin' into my life
The reason for all the love I'm feelin'

Now that I found I don't know how I lived without you
I don't know how I survived without your love
Now that I found you I only know I'd be lost without you
I found the love I'll never find again
'cause all I ever needed and all I ever wanted has come true
I found it all now that I found you

I could've searched forever and never realized
The treasure of a lifetime was the love inside your eyes
When I reach for inspiration in your touch it's always there
Givin' me faith every step of the way, givin' me all I ever needed

Now that I found I don't know how I lived without you
I don't know how I survived without your love
Now that I found you I only know I'd be lost without you
I found the love I'll never find again
'cause all I ever needed and all I ever wanted has come true
I found it all now that I found you

Now that I've found you I don't know how I lived without you
I don't know how I survived without your love
Now that I found you I only know I'd be lost without you
Give you my love I swear it will never end
'cause all I ever needed and all I ever wanted has come true
