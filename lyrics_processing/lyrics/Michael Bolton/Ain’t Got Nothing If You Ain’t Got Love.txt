You can live your life on the edge of your seat
You can take your place down on easy street
Or just lose your mind
Over things only money can but
But it's a fact of life no matter what you do
Every stake ya claim, every dream come true
Down deep inside these kinda things never satisfy

Oh love is the precious thing
Set ya free and give your heart the wings, to fly
Love is the living dream
Callin' your name
Tellin' you somethin' 'cause you

Ain't got nothin' if you ain't got love
Ain't got nothin' if you ain't got love
You conquer the world but it's never enough
Because you ain't got nothin' if you ain't got love

You can carry the flame across the finish line
You can sign your name in the sands of time
But fortune and fame, they're just things that ya leave behind
Well you think you got the world in the palm of your hand
But there's one thing missin' in your promised land
It's a thing called love, the one thing that your heart demands

Oh love is the rhythm of life
In your soul is where the secret lies
When love is lookin' through your eyes
Every feelin' inside
Is tellin' you somethin'

Cause you ain't got nothin' if you ain't got love
Ain't got nothin' if you ain't got love
You conquer the world but it's never enough
Because you ain't got nothin' if you ain't got love


You can chase your dreams down the yellow brick road
Sail full steam down the river of gold
If you ever get it all ya never get enough
'Cause you ain't got nothin' if you ain't got love


Oh love is the precious thing
Set you free and give your heart the wings, to fly
Love is the living dream
Callin' your name, ooh
You ain't got nothin' if you ain't got love
Ain't got nothin' if you ain't got love
You conquer the world but it's never enough
