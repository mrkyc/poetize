I see your face and I feel your heartache
I see the trace of the tears you have cried
The silent sound of the hurt left unspoken
You were strong enough to hide
All your life no one's ever shown you
What is really like to have someone to hold you

In the arms of love heaven's just a heartbeat away (away)
I'll be your light in the dark, your shield from the storm
Your shelter from the rain
And in the arms of love I'll lift you above all the madness and all of the pain
And you'll be safe and warm here in the arms of love

We search this world for a little compassion
For just one look through the eyes of a child
For one more chance to be a believer
While there's still a chance in time
All your life no one's there beside you
Close your eyes and let this moment find you

In the arms of love heaven's just a heartbeat away (away)
I'll be your light in the dark, your shield from the storm
Your shelter from the rain
And in the arms of love I'll lift you above all the madness and all of the pain
And you'll be safe and warm here in the arms of love

High above the world where dreams are sailing
Far beyond the brightest shinin' star
Where everything you've waited for is waiting

In the arms of love heaven's just a heartbeat away (away)
I'll be your light in the dark, your shield from the storm
Your shelter from the rain
And in the arms of love I'll lift you above all the madness and all of the pain
And you'll be safe and warm here in the arms of love
You'll be safe and warm here in the arms of love
