Gimme back my life, all my second chances
If I'm gonna give my all, never be without you
Tell me will you catch my fall, 'cause I'm about to
Love is written on your face
Do you believe in what you've found
I'll be lost in time and space
Until I hear that sound
I wanna hear you say it
Doesn't get any better than this
If this ain't really love
Then tell me, baby, what it is
Without you I can't breathe
What do you promise me
I wanna hear you say it
I wanna hear you say it
Gimme back my pride, take away this silence
Gimme back my faith, show me where this road ends
Take away my choice, deliver me forever
You can free me with your voice even if you whisper
Love is written on your face
Do you believe in what you've found
I'll be lost in time and space
Until I hear that sound
