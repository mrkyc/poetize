Playing the same old melodies
The late-night crowd
Was wild and loud
But then a shot
Outside the bar-room
And then I saw you for the first time
The way you stepped out of the dark
Up to the bar
Said: "Here we are"
Whiskey for me
For you Tequila
The devil sent you to Lorado
Because he knew that I was there
A man with such a face
In such a lonesome place
Can only be a desperado
The devil sent you to Lorado
Because he knew that I was there
And when I heard you'd stay
I felt right away
You'd shake my life
Like a Tornado
You might also likeI still remember the piano
Playing a different melody
You won at cards
You won at darts
Left all the men without a dollar
And now you gotta leave Lorado
They want you out of here by noon
Oh, I can tell
I'm in a spell
So here we go to Amarillo
The devil sent you to Lorado
Because he knew that I was there
A man with such a face
In such a lonesome place
Can only be a desperado
The devil sent you to Lorado
Because he knew that I was there
And when I heard you'd stay
I felt right away
You'd shake my life
Like a Tornado
Get down, get down, get down
Down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down
The devil sent you to Lorado
Because he knew that I was there
A man with such a face
In such a lonesome place
Can only be a desperado
The devil sent you to Lorado
Because he knew that I was there
And when I heard you'd stay
I felt right away
You'd shake my life
Like a Tornado
The devil sent you to Lorado
Because he knew that I was there
A man with such a face
In such a lonesome place
Can only be a desperado
The devil sent you to Lorado
Because he knew that I was there
And when I heard you'd stay
I felt right away
You'd shake my life
Like a Tornado
The devil sent you to Lorado
Because he knew that I was there
A man with such a face
In such a lonesome place
Can only be a desperado
