You are just my fantasy boy
I made you up, you are my toy
And I found you as a dream inside my head
Your eyes are like a mystic dream
The deepest blue I've ever seen
You're a mixture of Paul Newman and James Dean
Tell me why, tell me why you're so real when I'm dreaming
Don't you know I have to face reality

Fantasy boy, please be my lover, not my toy
Cause I need you to be real
To be no fantasy, I want to touch and feel
My fantasy boy, come on and step into my life
It's so much harder to survive without your love for me
Come take me to eternity

I know someday we're gonna meet
Fantasy boy, I feel your heat
Want to squeeze you, tease you, hold you in my arms
Tell me why, tell me why you're so real when I'm dreaming
Don't you know I have to face reality

Fantasy boy, please be my lover, not my toy
Cause I need you to be real
To be no fantasy, I want to touch and feel
My fantasy boy, come on and step into my life
It's so much harder to survive without your love for me
Come take me to eternity, my fantasy boy
