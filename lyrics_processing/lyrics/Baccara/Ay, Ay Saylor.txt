Until I saw the sailor man
About twice the size of me, and also strong
He put my heart in such a mess
Until I heard myself say yes
When he asked me if I will sail along
Ay, ay sailor, or my my sailor
You sure done something to me
Bye, bye tailor, goodbye bye tailor
Let go I've got to be free
I wanna sail away with him
That's where I love to be
Along with my, my sailor
So ay, ay sailor
You know I joined you at sea
I used to leave a normal day
And always walked the easy way
And I have planned to spend my life assure
He'll take me to another world
Of which I've only read and heard
And we will sail what's left for ever more
Ay, ay sailor, or my my sailor
You sure done something to me
Bye bye tailor, goodbye bye tailor
Let go I've got to be free
You might also likeI wanna sail away with him
That's where I love to be
Along with my my sailor
So ay ay sailor
You know I joined you at sea
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ohohohoh
A sailor or tailor
A tailor or sailor
A sailor or tailor
A tailor
Ayy say
Ay, ay sailor!
Ay, ay sailor, or my my sailor
You sure done something to me
Bye bye tailor, goodbye bye tailor
Let go I've got to be free
I wanna sail away with him
Out on the lonely sea
To tiny isle that's in the sun
That's where I love to be
Ay ay sailor, or my my sailor
You sure done something to me
Bye bye tailor, goodbye bye tailor
Let go I've got to be free
I wanna sail away with him
Upon the lonely sea
To tiny isle that's in the sun
That's where I love to beeeeeee
Ay ay sailor, or my my sailor
You sure done something to me
My, my sailor, so ay ay sailor
