I'd give him something I could love him (oooh love him)
But why is he so shy (uuuummm)
Maybe I should tell him, tell him, tell him
I know your secret
You're trying to hide it boy
But go prove, go shake and wave it
They're doing and the way you move
Do you wanna touch me
Don't use your angle, use your hands my friend
But not too much weight
We've got all night now try and be a gent
You understand (ooooooh)
Body Talk
Gimme some more body talk
So that I can read what you want and what you need
Now you move it low
Let it go in out and out
Body talk is fun, fun, fun
It's number one, one, one
Oh yeah, body talk
Gimme some more body talk
Please your own embrace
Give yourself another chance
Now you'd move it low
Let it all hang out and out
It's the power high, high, high
You're me oh my, my, my

May I suggest to you a tender kiss
