Making love in the rain
I can't believe the joy it brings me
And when I'm all alone
I hear the rain on my window

It's just a little thing
But it means so much to me
Our bodies together
While the rain plays a melody

Every raindrop
Makes me think of you
(Wishing you were close to me)
There is nothing that I'd rather do than

Making love in the rain
I can't believe the joy it brings me
And when I'm all alone
I hear the rain on my window

When it's stormy outside
It's warm in my heart
With you in my arms
And when you're away from me
I wish it would rain
'Cause it's always the same

Every raindrop
Makes me think of you
(Wishing you were close to me)
There is nothing that I'd rather do than

Making love in the rain
I can't believe the joy it brings me
(I can't believe)
And when I'm all alone
I hear the rain on my window
(On my window)
Making love in the rain
I can't believe the joy it brings me
(Making love)
And when I'm all alone
I hear the rain on my window
(On my window, I hear the raindrops flow)


Every raindrop
Makes me think of you
(Wishing you were close to me)
There is nothing that I'd rather do than
(That I'd rather do)
Making love in the rain
I can't believe the joy it brings me
(I can't believe)
And when I'm all alone
I hear the rain on my window
(On my window, I hear it)
Making love in the rain
I can't believe the joy it brings me

All alone, I hear the rain
My love, here comes the rain
My love, here comes the rain
My love, here comes the rain
