I keep going over it and over it again in my mind
I get these flashback and I feel so good, yeah
Now this is one night that I'll never forget
You see, it was just like in the movies
I mean, it actually happened just like this
Yeah yeah...

The stars were shining
Brighter than most of the time
Then love came out of nowhere, yeah

No thrill will ever be like
(The night that I fell in love)
I tenderly remember
(The night that I fell in love)
It surely was the best thing I ever did that night
(The night when I fell in love)
The stars' lights were in your eyes
(The night that I fell in love) with you

I've known so many people
Been to most parts of the world
And seen some things that have blown my mind
Yes I have but...
You might also like
Nothing will ever be like
(The night that I fell in love)
And I tenderly remember
(The night that I fell in love)
It surely was the best thing to happen to my life
(The night when I fell in love)
The stars' lights were in your eyes
(The night that I fell in love) with you


Ooh yeah, I thought I could be happy
Without any love in my world
But now I know that, that is so untrue
Yeah, hey hey

No thrill will ever be like
(The night that I fell in love)
I tenderly remember
(The night that I fell in love)
It surely was the best thing to happen to my life
(The night when I fell in love)
The stars' lights were in your eyes
(The night that I fell in love) with you
All I can ever do is think about that night
That night, that night
All I can ever do is think about that night
That night, hey hey
All I can ever do is think about that night
That night, that night
All I can ever do is think about that night
That night, that night
All I can ever do is think about that night
