Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Yeah-yeah
Ooh-ooh
Eah-eah-eah, oh

What's there to say
There's not much to talk about
And whatever happened
To all of the love that we vowed
Yes, it's true
And there's nothing new you can say

Give me the reason to want you back
And why should I love you again
Do you know
Tell me how, how to forgive and forget
Give me the reason to love you now
It's been a mighty long time
And the love that used to be
Ended the day you walked out
Never knew I'd ever be
Standing alone and outside
With no one to love
You might also like
Yeah-eah
Ooh-ooh-eah

I was secure and so glad
There was you to love
What in the world would I ever do without us
But it's getting clear
That I have to get over you

Give me the reason to want you back
And why should I love you again
Do you know
Tell me how, how to forgive and forget
Give me the reason to love you now
It's been a mighty long time
And the love that used to be
Ended the day you walked out
Never knew I'd ever be
Standing alone and outside
With no one to love

No one, no one to love
No one, no one to love
No one, no one to love
No one, no one
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
You, ooh-eah-eah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

Give me the reason to want you back
And why should I love you again
Do you know
Tell me how, how to forgive and forget
Give me the reason to love you now
It's been a mighty long time
And the love that used to be
Ended the day you walked out

Give me the reason to
Love you, girl
