Ooh yeah
Oh, oh

I can only speak for
The things that I've been through
So when it comes to our love
I'll talk the whole night through, oh
About the lovin' I've been missin'
Lately, baby, I ain't had no kissin'
Don't you love me?
Can we stay together?

Like when we used to be in love
But now you've got your head on another cloud
Girl, we had a good thing (What a good thing)
But now you've turned around
Don't you care how this love we've had turns out?

Promise me you'll leave me never
And that we'll be in love forever (Ooh)
Promise me you'll leave me never (Yeah)
And that we'll be in love forever
You might also like
We can work at our love
And make it all brand new
If we stay together
There's nothing we can't do, no
Improve the loving is what I'm seeing
Let's do it, baby
Don't fight the feeling
Won't you love me?
Can we stay together?

Like when we used to be in love
But now you've got your head on another cloud
Girl, we had a good thing (What a good thing)
And now you've turned around
Don't you even care how this love we've had turns out?

Promise me you'll leave me never
And that we'll be in love forever (Ooh, tell me)
Promise me you'll leave me never
And that we'll be in love forever (Forever, girl)
Promise me you'll leave me never
And that we'll be in love forever (Ooh ooh ooh ooh, ever)
Promise me you'll leave me never
And that we'll be in love forever (Ooh, promise me)
Promise me you'll leave me never
And that we'll be in love forever
(Oh, won't you promise me)
Promise me you'll leave me never
And that we'll be in love forever (Promise me)
Promise me you'll leave me never (Forever and ever and ever)
And that we'll be in love forever (Your love)
Promise me you'll leave me never (Ever, ever)
And that we'll be in love forever (Promise me)
Promise me you'll leave me never (Forever and ever and ever)
And that we'll be in love forever (Your love, forever in love)
Promise me you'll leave me never
And that we'll be in love forever (Promise me)
Promise me you'll leave me never
And that we'll be in love forever (Your love)
Promise me you'll leave me never
And that we'll be in love forever (Promise me)
Promise me you'll leave me never
And that we'll be in love forever (Your love)
Promise me you'll leave me never
