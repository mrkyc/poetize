The sun is shining, there's plenty of light
A new day is dawning, sunny and bright
But after I've been crying all night
The sun is cold and the new day seems old

Since I lost my baby
Oh, since I lost my baby

The birds are singing and the children are playing
There's plenty of work, and the bosses are paying
Not a sad word should a young heart be saying
But fun is a bore, and with money I'm poor

Since I lost my baby (Since I lost my baby)
Oh, since I lost my baby
(My baby) My baby (My baby)

Next time I'll be kinder to my baby
Won't you please help me find her (I've got to find my girl)
Someone just remind her
(Someone just remind her, someone just remind her)
Of this love she left behind her (Of me, ooh ooh ooh)
'Til I find her, I'll be trying to ('Til I find her, I'll be trying to)
Every day I'm growing kinder
Trying...inclined to...find her
Inclined to find my baby (My baby)
I've been looking everywhere (My baby)
Hey baby, I really really care
I care, I care
You might also like
My determination is fading fast, so fast, so fast
Inspiration is a thing of the past
I can't see how my hope's gonna last
But good things are bad (So bad) and what's happy is sad
So sad, so sad, I'm sad, so sad, so sad

Since I lost my baby (Since I lost my girl)
Oh, since I lost my baby (Since I lost my baby)

I feel so bad (Got to find that girl, I've got to find my girl)
I feel so sad, yeah
(Since I lost my, since I lost my, my, my, my, my baby)
'Cause everything is gone (Got to find that girl, I've got to find my girl)
And it's hard, girl, to carry on
(Since I lost my, since I lost my, my, my, my, my baby)
I know it's up to me (Got to find that girl, I've got to find my girl)
What's gonna happen to me?
(Since I lost my baby)
What's gonna happen to me?
Oh, I don't know, I don't know, what I'm gonna do, no, no, no, no
I don't know
Since I lost my baby
I don't know, I don't know what to do without, my girl, my girl, my girl
I don't know
Since I lost my baby, yeah
(No, no) I can't find her nowhere (Don't go)
Nowhere, nowhere, nowhere, nowhere (Since I lost my baby)
Oh no (I don't know, since I lost my baby, yeah)
Yeah, hey (Don't know), I can't find her nowhere (I don't know)
Nowhere, nowhere, nowhere, nowhere, nowhere (Since I lost my baby)
Nowhere, nowhere, nowhere
(I don't know, since I lost my baby, yeah)
(Don't know) I can't find her nowhere (I don't know)
Nowhere, nowhere, nowhere, nowhere (Since I lost my baby)
(I don't know, since I lost my baby, yeah)
(Don't know) I can't find her nowhere (I don't know)
