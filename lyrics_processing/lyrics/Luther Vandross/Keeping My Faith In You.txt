I just love how long we've known each other
And I know you care about me
But I can't tell just where your life is going
You've been quite a mystery
You've got all of these brand new friends
They keep taking your confidence

But I'm keeping my faith in you, yeah yeah
Deep in my heart of hearts
You've been worried, puzzled, surrounded by your trouble
But I'm keeping my faith in you
Yeah, yeah, uh-huh, oh yeah

We all cried when your first bow was taken
No one could be prouder of you
But I care more about your heart if it's aching
If I'm your friend, what else can I do?
But those people who hang around
They keep bringing your spirit down

But I'm keeping my faith in you, yeah
Deep in my heart of hearts
If anyone can do it
I know you'll get through it
So I'm keeping my faith in you
You might also like
I've known you ever since way back when
And I know you, you don't want to change, my friend
But you're under pressure, like no one could imagine
It's not a good time that you've been having
But you're a real strong brother, and I know you'll recover
So I'm keeping my faith in you

Keeping my faith in you
Deep in my heart of hearts
If anyone can do it
I know you'll get through it
So I'm keeping my faith in you

Keeping my faith in you, come on
Deep in my heart of hearts, yeah
Keeping my faith in you, keeping my fait in you every day
Deep in my heart of hearts
You've been worried, puzzled
Surrounded by big trouble
But I'm keeping my faith in you

Keeping my faith in you
My faith in you
Keeping my faith in you
My faith in you
Keeping my faith in you
