I thought sometime alone was what we really needed
You said this time would hurt more than it helps
But I couldn't see that
I thought it was the end of a beautiful story
And so I left the one I loved at home to be alone (Alone)
And I tried to find out if this one thing is true
That I'm nothing without you
I know better now and I've had a change of heart

I'd rather have bad times with you than good times with someone else
I'd rather be beside you in a storm than safe and warm by myself
I'd rather have hard times together than to have it easy apart
I'd rather have the one who holds my heart
Ooh, ooh, ooh-yeah

And then I met someone and thought she could replace you
We got a long just fine, we wasted time because he was not you
We had a lot of fun though we knew we were faking
Love was not impressed with our connection they were all lies, all lies
So I'm here 'cause I found this one thing is true
That I'm nothing without you
I know better now and I've had a change of heart
You might also like
I'd rather have bad times with you than good times with someone else
I'd rather be beside you in a storm than safe and warm by myself
I'd rather have hard times together than to have it easy apart
I'd rather have the one who holds my heart
Who holds my heart

I can't blame you if you turn away from me like I've done you
I can only prove the things I say with time
Please be mine

I'd rather have bad times with (Please be mine) you than good times with someone else (I know)
I'd rather be beside you in a storm (Anytime) than safe and warm by myself (So sure, baby)
I'd rather have hard times together than to have it easy apart
I'd rather have the one who holds my heart (My heart)
I'd rather have bad times with you (Surely) than good times with someone else (Surely)
I'd rather be beside you in a storm (Oh, yeah) than safe and warm by myself (All by myself)
I'd rather have hard times together than to have it easy apart (You know it)
I'd rather have the one who holds my heart, ooh-ooh

I'd rather have the one who holds my heart
I'd rather have the one who holds my heart
