I need to have you next to me
In more ways than one
And I refuse to leave
'Til I see the morning sun
The time is right
You hold me tight
And love's got me high
Please tell me, 'Yes'
And don't say 'No'
Honey, not tonight
Move a little close to me
You owe it to yourself
And I will selfishly
Take a little for myself
And it's because of you
That love won't let me wait
Yeah, yeah

The time is right
Turn down the lights
And take my hand, yeah
We'll take a flight
And spend the night in Wonderland

'Til I see the morning sun
Creep through your window pane
Because love won't let me wait
Not another minute
Ooh ooh ooh. yeah, yeah...

And I need your love so desperately
And only you can set me free
When I make love to you
We'll explode in ecstasy
And I won't take the blame
That love won't let me wait
