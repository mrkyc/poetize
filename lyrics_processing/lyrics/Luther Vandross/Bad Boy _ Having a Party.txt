(Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, this is a party)

(Oh yeah, well alright)
(Oh yeah, well alright)
(Oh yeah, well alright)
(Oh yeah, well alright)

Roll back the rug, everybody
Move all the tables and chairs
We're gonna have us a good time tonight
Every time that we meet
We skip and we dip to the beat, hey, yeah
What in the world could be better
Than getting together again?

The last time we had a party
It ended when the sun came up
That's why your mama told you
That you couldn't go out
Stay in the house

Bad boy, gonna sneak out tonight
He's gonna tip by her window
'Cause he sure wants to go out and dance
You might also like
Everyone's here, let 'em all in (Oh yeah)
The chandelier downstairs has fallen (Well alright)
I know it's hard to resist
This is the party no one wanted to miss
If you don't get home on the double, boy (Oh yeah)
You're going to be in trouble (Well alright)
I hope your mama don't look in your room
'Cause if she does, she'll be here soon

(Boy) She's gonna be mad
You're a bad boy (Boy)
You've got it bad, boy
(Boy) Say goodbye to your friends
'Cause it's gonna be a while
'Til you see them again, oh

Bad boy, gonna sneak out tonight
He's gonna tip by her window
'Cause he sure wants to get out and dance

(Ooh yeah)
(Right, sure 'nough)
(Sure 'nough)
Everybody's swinging, dancing to the music
On the radio, having a party
Everybody's swinging, dancing to the music
On the radio, oh, no, no, no, no
You can't go

Bad boy, he's gotta sneak out tonight
Gonna tip by her window
'Cause he sure wants to get out and dance

(Ooh yeah)
Ow!

Everybody's swinging, dancing to the music
(This is it, this is it)
On the radio, having a party
Everybody's swinging, dancing to the music
On the radio, oh, no, no, no, no
You can't go

Oh, bad boy, he's gonna sneak out tonight
He's gonna tip by her window
Bad boy, he's gonna sneak out tonight
He's gonna tip by her window
Tip by her window
Oh, bad boy, he's gonna sneak out tonight
He's gonna tip by her window
