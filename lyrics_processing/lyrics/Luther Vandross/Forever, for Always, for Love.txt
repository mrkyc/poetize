I sing this song to remind myself that
There was a time when I didn't have no one, didn't have no love

Do you remember the love that we once had?
Well, if I had the chance to love you again
I would make your heart forget I was ever there
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no
If we forget the past
I know this time love will last
Forever, for always, for love
Yeah, yeah

I'm not coming home anymore, doesn't matter
Well, if I had the chance to hold you again
I would fill your heart with joy and make you remember
I'm the only one for you, yes I would
Let's throw the bad memories out
And make this the first day of our
Forever, for always, for love

I'd be a fool to ever change
If she says she loves the way I, I am
I'd be a fool to ever change, yes, yes, yes, yes
If she says she loves the way I am
It's gonna be starting here, starting now, yeah yeah yeah
Forever, for always, for love

Do it for the ones we love
And never, no no no, no no no no no no no no no no no
Forever, for always, for love
Hey yeah, hey yeah, yeah yeah, oh oh, yeah hey
Forever, for always, for love
Don't you know, don't you know, don't you know, don't you know, hey, ow
Forever, for always, for love
Your love, your love, baby, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, hey, ooh
Oh, I'm in love, I can't help myself
Hey yeah, ooh, hey yeah, ooh yeah, ooh, comes from my heart
Straight from the heart, mmm
Forever, for always, for love
Gotta say it once again, I can't help myself, I can't help myself
