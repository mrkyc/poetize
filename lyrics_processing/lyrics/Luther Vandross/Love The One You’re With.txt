There's a rose in a fisted glove
And the eagle flies with the dove
And if you can't be
With the one you love
It's alright
Go ahead and love the one
Love the one
Love the one you're with
Love the one
Love the one
Love the one you're with
Ooh...hoo...come on, yeah

If your guy can't come to you
And you don't remember
Who you're talking to
Your concentration slips away
Because your baby, sweetheart sugar is so far away

Well, there's a rose in a fisted glove
And the eagle flies with the dove
And if you can't be
With the one you love
Honey, love the one you're with
(Love the one you're with) Uh-huh
(Love the one you're with) Yeah
(Love the one you're with)

Don't be angry
Don't be sad
And don't sit cryin' for good times you had
There's a girl right next to you
And she's waiting
For something to do

And there's a rose in a fisted glove
And the eagle flies with the dove
And if you can't be
With the one you love
Do the wild thing, love the one you're with
Hey (Love the one you're with) That's right

Yeah, ooh...
(Doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo) Do it
(Doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo) Do it
(Doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo) Do it
Yeah
Don't know why (you don't, you don't)
Don't know why (you don't, you don't)
Don't know why (you don't, you don't)
Don't know why you don't (you don't)
Turn your heartache right into joy
She's a girl and you're a boy
Get it together, and make it tonight
You ain't gonna need anymore advice

And there's a rose in a fisted glove
And the eagle flies with the dove
And if you can't be
With the one you love...
Love love love love love (Love the one...)
Love love love love love (Love the one...)
Love love love love love (Love the one...)
Love love luh-luh-luh-luh-luh-luh-love (You gotta do something)
Gotta do something, the night's really jumping so love (the one you're with)
Don't fight the feeling, it's not like you're falling in love with (the one you're with)
Hugging and kissing when your love is missing ain't love, just love (the one you're
With)
Can't do no wrong if it's only one night and you're lovin' (the one you're with)
Mami, go 'head on, find somebody, get some love
Love will, still be, right there, when you get home
(For the night) Get the love
Eagles flyin' with the dove
(And if you can't) Get to the one you love
Just (love the one you're with)
Hey, yeah
Love the one, love the one
Love the one, love the one
Love the one, love the one
Love the one, love the one
Love the one, love the one
Love the one, love the one
Love the one, love the one
Hey...
