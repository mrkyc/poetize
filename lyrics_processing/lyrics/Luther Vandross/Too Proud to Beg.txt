Stayed longer than I planned
But change is good, they say
So I rearranged my world for them
For her and love and, here I go again
I spoke to my heart
Said, "Open up wide"
Then got the message you had changed your mind
And now here I am, and I just don't understand
Baby, if you talk to me then I will listen
There can't be no "us", honey, if "you" are missin'
Yes I love you, yes I need you
Ain't no world for me without you
I want you, I'm just too proud to beg
So sad the journey made
So high the price you have to pay
All for love
And it hurts you anyway
I can't let me lose my soul to hope and wishing
You don't understand me, I know that you think...
I don't love you, I don't need you
But, my intentions are to love you
See, I want you, I'm just too proud...
To beg for your love, honey
So don't put me through it
Take a little time to think about what you're doing
And try to understand why...
