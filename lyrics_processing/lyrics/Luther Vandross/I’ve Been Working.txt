I don't know why the world loves a forever love affair
(I'm just a freak)
Who loves a one-night thing, oh yeah
(A one night all night)
And after a long day of work all I wanna do is play around
(So I'm going out)
For a little bit of love
And a whole lotta getting down
Do you believe me? You gotta believe me

I've been working
I've been all day working
And I need somebody
Said I need some
I need some love tonight, oh yeah
I need some love
I need some love tonight
Uh ah

Because the night is mine
And I don't wanna change anything 'cause I like what I got
