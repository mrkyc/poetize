Oh oh yeah yeah
Oh yeah, yeah yeah

So close to paradise
But closer than I should be
It's like I'm along for the ride, it happened unexpectedly
Promised, myself
That I wouldn't ever love again
But you make me feel something, my mind's always on you

I was standing in the rain
(I thought about you)
I was riding on the train
(I thought about you)
Feeling high like I seem to do
Every time I think about you
Saw two lovers start to kiss
(I thought about you)
Had to hold back the tears
(I thought about you)
Other girls no more exist
All because I think about you
You might also like
Nothing seems to help, I don't even know myself
I'm trying not to think of you
But a heart does what it wants to do
Pass you by, see you smile and I must admit I get
So emotional, I think I'm falling for you

Bought a pillow for my room
(I thought about you)
Heard Alicia sing a tune
(I thought about you)
Sends my rocket to the moon
(Every time I think about you)
Happens every time oh
Right from this heart of mine
(I thought about you)
I wanted you every time
(I thought about you)
What I'm feel is so divine
And it's all because I think about you

But I, I'm constantly reminded
(I, I)
Reminded that you're only someone who I'd like to know
You don't know me, you're my private fantasy
You're with me, constantly in my mind
(You you you, you you you)
Oh you
(You you you)
Happens every time I think about you you you you you you
(You you you)
Oh you you
(You you you)
And I
(You you you)
I do need you
(Every time I think about you)
Had a lovely day today
(I thought about you)
Wasn't hard to get through
(I thought about you)
Seems to happen easily
Every time I think about you
Took a walk with myself
(I thought about you)
Wish it could've been with you
(I thought about you)
But every star in the sky came out for me
And it's all because I think about you

(You you)
(I thought about you)
You
(You you)
(I thought about you)
(Lovin' you baby)
Yeah yeah, every time I think about you
(Lovin' you baby)
(You you)
You
(I thought about you)
(Lovin' you, lovin' you baby)
(You you)
You
(I thought about you)
You you
(You you you)
All because I think about you
(Lovin' you baby)
(You you)
(I thought about you)
(You you)
I feel baby
(I thought about you)
(Lovin' you baby)
(You you you)
Every time I think about you
(I think about you)
(Lovin' you, lovin' you baby)
(You you)
(I thought about you)
Love you baby, oh yeah
(You you)
(I thought about you)
(Lovin' you baby)
(You you you)
And it's all because I think about you
