A kiss in the dark, a certain time I can call you
A letter of love, but no name did you sign
Pretending to all that we were just friends when I saw you
I didn't know that you wanted me to be
I didn't know that you wanted me for your
(You wanted me) to be

Your secret love, why can't we tell somebody?
'Cause secret loves never last as long
Your secret love will never be your true love
I can't be no secret, baby, it's breaking my heart

You should've let me know from the first time, baby
That you were not, were not free to love
How could you wait so long? Oh, what a waste of love, baby
I should've known that you wanted me to be
I should've known that you wanted me for your
(You wanted me) to be

Your secret love, why can't we tell somebody?
'Cause secret loves never mean as much
Your secret love will never be your true love
I can't be no secret, baby, it's breaking my heart
You might also like
I won't be your secret love
'Cause it's just a waste of my love
I'm tellin' you from the start
I won't be the one who gives you love
When your other guy ain't givin' you none
Don't come now, wait for awhile
Let's meet at the place downtown
It's a shame it has to be like this
But I really miss you, baby

Your secret love, why can't we tell somebody?
'Cause secret loves never last as long
Your secret love will never be your true love
I can't be your secret, baby, you're breaking my (Heart, heart), my heart
Your secret love, why can't we tell somebody?
'Cause secret loves never mean as much
Your secret love will never be your true love
