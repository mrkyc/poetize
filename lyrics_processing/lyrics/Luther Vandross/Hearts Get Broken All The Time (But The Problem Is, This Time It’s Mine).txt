So many times I've seen
So many people's dreams
Lost and washed away, out to the sea, yeah
I said, "No, not I"
Pain would surely pass me by
Happening to them but not to me, yeah

Hearts get broken all the time
Oooh never used to worry bout things like this (I wouldn't worry)
But the trouble is (this time it's mine)
Now I'm worryin' (this one is mine)
See the problem is the heart is mine

Love would be all I need
How naive could I be?
Trusting other people with my care, yeah
Never thought I'd have to be
One of love's casualties
Up until now my belief, was that love was fair

Hearts get broken all the time
OOH, but I never orried 'bout things like this (I wouldn't worry)
But the trouble is (this time it's mine)
Now I'm worryin' (this one is mine)
See, the problem is the heart is mine
You might also like
This time my heart's breakin'
This time my love's failin'
I'm tryin' hard not to be bitter now
(I never dreamed that the broken heart would be mine, ow)

Hearts get broken all the time
You think it's love but it never really is
Never could imagine a thing like that
(I wouldn't worry) I wouldn't
But the trouble is
(this time it's mine)
Got me worryin'
(This one is mine)
See the problem is
(this heart is mine)
This is mine, this is mine, yeah
(Hearts get broken all the time, ooh)
All the time, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Never cared a darn about a thing like that
I never really did (I didn't worry) never
But the trouble is (this time it's mine)
And the problem really is (this one is mine)
See, the whole thing is (the heart is mine)
Yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah, oh yeah
(This time it's mine) It's mine, it's mine, it's mine, it's mine
(This one is mine) It's mine, it's mine, it's mine, it's mine
(The heart is mine) It's different now, yes it is, yes it is
It's mine, it's mine (this time it's mine)
It's not yours, it's mine, it's mine (this one is mine)
It's different, folks, it's mine, it's mine, it's mine (the heart is mine)
This time it's mine, it's mine, it's mine
(This time it's mine...this one is mine...the heart is mine)
