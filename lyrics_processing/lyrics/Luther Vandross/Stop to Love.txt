Lately love keeps keeping me wake at night
Tossing and turning, my love
Wanna kiss, wanna hold you so tight
Ooh, but I wonder love
Whether you know or not
When you just hurry away
Leaving me laying there in shock
I just wanna be
The one that you wanna see
I just wanna have you near me
But you fly away
Almost every day
You work a lot
You never stop to love

(Stop)
I love you, stop
(Stop)
Come home from the road
Gotta stop to love
And let's celebrate
(Celebrate)
The love we got
(Stop)
Say you're coming home
(Gotta stop to love)
You might also like
You say my love
Has always been on your mind
But how can I ever love you
When you keep working overtime?
Too many empty nights
Can make almost any guy roam
To look for the love he don't get
Whenever he's at home alone
Awaiting the day
That you're coming to stay
I hate to see you go away
But you couldn't rest
Had to be the best
To reach the top
But you did not stop to love

(Stop)
I love you, stop
(Stop)
Come home from the road
Gotta stop to love
And let's celebrate
(Celebrate)
The love we got
(Stop)
Say you're coming home
(Gotta stop to love)
And one day you'll discover
I'm the one who loves you
(Gotta stop to love)
And no one does you better
Can't you stay forever
(Stop to love)
I can hardly stand the loneliness
Come on stay
Cause that's what it's all about
You really turn me out

I love you, stop
(Stop)
Love you, stop
(Stop)
Come home from the road
Got to stop to love
And let's celebrate
(Celebrate)
The love we got
(Stop)
Say you're coming home
(Got to stop to love)
I love you, stop
(Stop)
I still love you, stop
(Stop)
Come home from the road
Got to stop to love
And let's celebrate
(Celebrate)
All the love we got
(Stop)
Say you're coming home
Got to stop to love
I love you, stop
(Stop)
I still love you, stop
(Stop)
Come home from the road
(Got to stop to love)
And let's celebrate
(Celebrate)
All the love we got
(Stop)
