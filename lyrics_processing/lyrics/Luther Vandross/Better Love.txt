Oh, oh no, no, no, no, no
Swing down
Hey, hey, yeah, hey, hey, yeah, yeah
Better love, girl, that's what I got
Hey, yeah, hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Better love

Lately I toss and turn at night
I hold my pillow very tight
Wake up to find the covers on the floor
I can't go on since you've been gone
Sometimes I don't know what I'm living for

See, I don't know what he told you 'bout the better life
His better cars and how he can treat you better
But none of that will keep you warm at night
He'll give you more

But who could have a better love?
No, no, no, no
A better love
A better, better love
Who could love you better?
You might also like
There is no reason
Honey, you should ever worry what I'm doing
While you're gone, I'm being true to you
My fire burns for your return
And I'll just dream of you until you do

See, I never could replace your love with anyone's
I do believe it's easier said than done
No matter whose promises you dream of
Go search the world

You couldn't find a better love
No, no, no, no, no
A better love, love
A better, better love
Who could love you better?


Well, I never could replace your love with anyone's
I do believe it's easier said than done
No matter whose promises you dream of
Go search the world
You couldn't find a better love
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
A better love, yeah, love
A better, better love
No, no, no, no

(Better love)
You couldn't find a better love, no way
(Better love)
No one could give you better love, no way
(Better, better love)
You couldn't find a better love, no, no way
(Better love)
No way, no, no way, no, no
Searched the world and I can't find a (Better love)
Better love, no
(Better, better love)
Better, better, no, no
(Better love)
He couldn't love you better, better, oh no, oh-oh
(Better love)
No one could love you better, better, no, no, no
(Better, better love)
I searched the world, and there, nowhere, nowhere
(Better love)
Nowhere, nowhere, nowhere, no
