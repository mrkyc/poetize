The painted faces on the street
Caricatures of long ago
Oh, they were young and oh, so sweet
Down beyond the boulevard
Knock on doors and empty halls
And still sometimes remember
The masquerade's forever
(The masquerade's forever)

When you see the price they paid
I'm sure you'll come and join the masquerade

The reeling figures pass on by
Like ghosts in some forgotten play
Beneath the black and empty sky
Music plays, and figures dance
With partners chosen by chance
And still sometimes remember
The masquerade's forever
(The masquerade's forever)

They reached for tomorrow
But tomorrow's more of the same
And so they reached for tomorrow
But tomorrow never came
You might also like
When you hear the price they paid
I'm sure you'll come and join the masquerade
When you hear the price they paid
You'll come join the masquerade

One by one and two by two
Past eight by tens in shattered frames
The players try to leave the room
Frantic puppets on a string
And all the while the music sings
And still sometimes remember
The masquerade's forever
(The masquerade's forever)

When you hear the price they paid
I'm sure you'll come and join the masquerade
(The masquerade's forever)
When you see, oooh oh
When you hear the price they paid
I'm sure you'll come and join the masquerade
(The masquerade's forever)
When you see, yeah, yeah, join the masquerade
When you hear the price they paid
I'm sure you'll come and join the masquerade
(The masquerade's forever)
When you see, see, yeah, yeah, join
When you hear the price they paid
I'm sure you'll come and join the masquerade
(The masquerade's forever)
When you see, yeah, join the masque, masquerade
When you hear the price they paid
I'm sure you'll come and join the masquerade
(The masquerade's forever)
You see, yeah, join the masquerade
When you hear the price they paid
I'm sure you'll come and join the masquerade
(The masquerade's forever)
When you see, yeah, join the masquerade
When you hear the price they paid
I'm sure you'll come and join the masquerade
(The masquerade's forever)
When you see, oh
When you hear the price they paid
I'm sure you'll come and join the masquerade
(The masquerade's forever)
When you see...
When you hear the price they paid
I'm sure you'll come and join the masquerade
