You dance for me, you laugh, I make you sing
I want complete control, and I say when
Let's try again
I see you every day, you walk on by
I try to speak, but then I wonder why
I have you every night all to myself
Never alone, asleep, you're gone
I wrote a line or two, tried to explain
In your morality it's not the same
I want you on your knees, I want you down
Never a sound
You could be, yes, you could be the one I love
You could be the sexy thing I'm dreaming of
You could spend the night with me and never know you were here
In my dreams
You could be, yes, you could be my slow romance
You could be a master in my lover's dance
You could scream out loud, and there's no one to hear, only me
In my dreams
(It could matter to me, it could matter to me)
In my dreams
(It could matter to me, it could matter to me)
In my dreams
(It could matter to me, it could matter to me)
You might also likeI see you every night, I pull your strings
You dance for me, you laugh, I make you scream
I want complete control, I say when
Let's try again
Let's try, let's try, let's try again
You could be, yes, you could be the one I love
You could be the sexy thing I'm dreaming of
You could spend the night with me and never know you were here
In my dreams
You could be, yes, you could be my slow romance
You could be a master in my lover's dance
You could spend the night with me and never know you were here
In my dreams
You could be, yes, you could be the one I love
You could be the sexy thing I'm dreaming of
You could spend the night with me and never know you were here
