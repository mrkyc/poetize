You told me "Stay away"
You watched me walk away

You told me "Stay away away"
I can hear the silence
I can hear the silence
You watched me walk away away
I can hear the silence
I can hear the silence

There's a reason for your sad eyes
There's a reason for your sad life
There's a reason you blame it all on me

Tell me why it's over
I'm lost again
Tell me why I'm laughing
Through the end
Tell me why it's over
Tell me true
Tell me why I'm crying
Over you
You might also like
I waited, hoping you would phone
I can hear the silence
I can hear the silence
And now I'm waiting all alone
I can hear the silence
I can hear the silence

I'm missing your sad eyes
I'm missing your sad smile
I'm missing the only love I've known

Tell me why it's over
I'm lost again
Tell me why I'm laughing
Through the end
Tell me why it's over
Tell me true
Tell me why I'm crying
Over you

You told me "Stay away"
(Stay away)
I can hear the silence
(Stay away, the silence)
You watched me walk away
I can hear the silence
I can hear the silence
I'm missing your sad eyes
I'm missing your sad smile
I'm missing the only love I've ever known

Tell me why it's over
I'm lost again
Tell me why I'm laughing
Through the end
Tell me why it's over
Tell me true
Tell me why I'm crying
Over you
Tell me why, why, why oh why
Tell me why
Tell me why
Tell me why
Tell me why
Tell me, tell me, tell me why
Tell me, tell me, tell me why
Tell me why
Tell me why
Tell me...

Tell me why, why
Tell me why
Tell me why
Tell me why
Tell me why, why why why
Tell me why
