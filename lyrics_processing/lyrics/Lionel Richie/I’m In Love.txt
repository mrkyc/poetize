Ooh, oh, oh, say na, na, na, na, I am in love
Na, na, na, na, I am in love 

No tears, no tears, no more, I'm done crying now
No pain, no pain, said I found another way
No games not like before, not up here on this cloud
No time for yesterday, let me explain

I got a new woman
Loving me in every way that she can
All she want to be is part of my plan
Safe to say that I'm in a better way, a better way, hey
You got a new woman
Loves to walk around just holding my hand
Cupid must have found us loving like that
Loving this woman, does anybody understand

That I'm in love (Love, love)
And I think about a real thing (Real love)
Kind of love that makes your heart sing (Love, love)
You got me singing la, la, la, la
Say I'm in love (Love, love)
And I think I found the real thing (Real love)
Kind of love that makes your heart sing (Love, love)
You got me singing la, la, la, la, la, la, I'm in love

Life is made of this, no her, no me, no way
Let me explain

I got a new woman
Loving me in every way that she can
All she want to be is part of my plan
Safe to say that I'm in a better way, a better way, hey

Kind of love that makes your heart sing (Love, love)
You got me singing la, la, la, la, la, la, I'm in love
I want the whole damn world to know
Sure as the wind blows
To carry the message far as it can go
That I'm in love, yeah
Nothing that can hold back this feeling
True love in which we're dealing, baby, baby
Na, na, na, na, I am in love 

That I'm in love (Love, love)
And I think about a real thing (Real love)
Kind of love that makes your heart sing (Love, love)
