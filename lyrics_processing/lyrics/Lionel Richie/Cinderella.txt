As I was walking down a path in the woods one day
I came across a vision that caught my eye
There was a lady standing right there beside a well
And I heard her whisper, what you wish for you can have

Then the vision went away
I thought that I had lost her
The girl I had been waiting for
I can't believe I just saw her
She is the finest thing I ever could imagine
And I want her next to me, 'cause I want, 'cause I want more

Come to me my Cinderella
Straight to my wishing well and
You're the one I'll always cherish
I yi yi yi yi
Come to me my Cinderella
Straight to my wishing well and
You're the one I'll love forever
I yi yi yi yi

She is a gentle flower, she is the sun and rain and
She could be the reason for my joy and my pain
The first thing I see each morning
The last thing I see at night and
You know if I could have all that
That's all I wish for in my life

Why did she have to go?
What do I say to find her?
This girl is the only one
I just cannot deny her
She's making love to my mind
And I can't forget this feeling
It's her voice that's calling
It's her voice I need, oh

Come to me my Cinderella

You're the one I'll always cherish

You're the one I'll love forever
