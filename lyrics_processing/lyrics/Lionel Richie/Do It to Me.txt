Girl, you're such a bad thing
Standing there all alone
Looking so good to me, baby
Can't do no wrong (Hey, baby)
Put your arms around me
Set my world on fire
There ain't never going to be nobody like you, baby
Honey, that's no lie (Hey, honey)

You put that spell on me
I'll tell you, honey
You know you set me free
Hey, little girl you know my heart's desires
Come on and give it to me, baby
I can't deny you
Hey, hey, what I'm saying is

Do it to me one more time
Oh, give you one more chance
This heart of mine
Do it to me one more time, baby
Can't get enough of your love
