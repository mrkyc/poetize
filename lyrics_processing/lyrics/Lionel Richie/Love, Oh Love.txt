Show the world and all its people
All the wonders love can bring
Give us strength and understanding
Give us all one song to sing
Let the music play
Play it loud and make it clear
It's time to stand up
To a new world that is now so near
From the bottom to the top
To the leaders of the land
We all have one heart
Everyone of us must lend a hand

And let there be joy in the world (Let there be)
And let there be no sorrow (Let there be)
And let there be peace on Earth (Let there be)
For all the world we've got to see

That love, oh love
What a blessed thing, oh yeah
Say it loud
Make it clear today

All the walls are falling down
No more children off to war
If we search in our hearts
All the suffering will be no more

And let there be joy in the world (Let there be)
And let there be no sorrow (Ah, let there be)
And let there be peace on Earth (Let there be)
For all God's children, let them see

That love, oh love
What a blessed thing, oh yeah
Say it loud
Make it clear today

And freedom, no more lies
We can save this world if we try
One world I know we can make it
Yes, it's only in your heart
Yes, it's only in your dreams
You can climb the highest mountains
You can make the whole world sing
Oh yeah
Love, oh love
What a blessed thing, oh yeah
Say it loud (Say it loud)
Make it clear today
Love, oh love
What a blessed thing, oh yeah
Say it loud
