You came in
That's what my little heart was looking for
Laughter in the rain
Feeling like a fool in love again

And the laughter came
When the tears stopped falling
Now all I do is just call your name
(When I say lover)
You walked in and my heart discovered
That my life would never be the same

Oh, you are my destiny
You are my one and only
You gave that joy to me
When my whole life was lonely

Angel in disguise
With your power of love
You just hypnotize
I just love the magic of your spell
How much joy we'll have together
Only time will tell

When the tears stopped falling
Now all I do is just call your name
(I just call your name)
You walked in and my heart discovered
That my life would never be the same

I know, you are my destiny
You are my one and only
You gave that joy to me
When my whole life was lonely

Every day, every night
Oh, I know it's so right
When I see your face
Only time's going to tell
But I know you so well
Girl, my love's for real
From the first time that I saw you I knew
It was forever
This mighty love between us will
Keep us together
You're the girl God sent from heaven I'm so
Glad I found you
Forever, forever, forever, forever, forever, forever
I'm so glad to be around you
You are my destiny
You are my one and only
You gave that joy to me
When my whole world was lonely

It's alright, it's alright
Do it again
It's alright, it's alright
Don't let this love end
It's alright, it's alright
Do it again
It's alright, it's alright
