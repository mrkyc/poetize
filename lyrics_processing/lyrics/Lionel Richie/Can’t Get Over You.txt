I guess I need to say I'm sorry
I didn't mean to make a fool of myself over you
I only wanted just to love you
But now that we're through, I can't get over you

I didn't mean to write a love song
I didn't mean to share these feeling I have in my heart
I told myself I could forget you
Now I know that's not true, I can't get over you

And as I walk down through the halls
I see your pictures hanging on the walls
Those memories
For all the thing that we've been through
My heart can still feel me and you
Sweet memories
After the pain of losing you
After the heartache, I know it's true
'Cause when I saw you, I still can say
I'm never going to love anybody else the way I love you today

I guess I need to say I'm sorry
I didn't mean to make a fool of myself over you
I only wanted just to love you
But now that we're through, I can't get over you

Oh, I can't get, I can't get over you
No, no, know my heart is breaking, baby
Oh, I can't get, I can't get over you
Can't get you out of my mind
Oh, I can't get, I can't get over you
Tried so hard to love you
Oh, I can't get, I can't get over you
Ooh baby
Now you're gone, now you're gone, you're gone away
Oh, I can't get, I can't get over you
Got my heart in my hand
Oh, I can't get, I can't get over you
You and me baby, we got a thing going on
I can't get, I can't get over you
