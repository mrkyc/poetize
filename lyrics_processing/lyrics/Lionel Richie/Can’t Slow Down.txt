I know what's on your mind
You feel you're wasting time
Wanna talk about it?
You feel there's something wrong
Don't feel like holding on
You better think about it
You say you just can't see
Don't lay that hurt on me
Well, I'm trying, baby
Got something on my mind
Something I've got to find
I'm on the move, baby

You see, I can't slow down
Got to keep moving, baby
Can't slow down
No, I can't slow down, oh
Can't slow down
Got to keep moving on
Oh, baby, oh

I'm out here on the run
Trying to get things done
Can you hear me, baby?
You think my love's nowhere
You think I just don't care
Are you kidding, baby?
Oh, don't make me play no games
Too hard to just stay sane
You know that time won't wait
Why should I hesitate?
Got to do it, baby
