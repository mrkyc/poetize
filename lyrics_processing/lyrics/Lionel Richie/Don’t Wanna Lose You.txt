You know what?
It's taken me a long time, baby
To realize how much you mean to me
I don't wanna lose you

Times are hard, my spirits are weak (Oh yeah)
Everything seems to be going wrong, my outlook's bleak (Oh yeah)
You know I fooled around playing the field
That's when I found that your love was real

No, I haven't treated you so right
But I won't lose your love without a fight

I'm gonna hold on to the love we have together
Hold on, don't you say goodbye
I want you to tell me now before we lose forever
Girl, I don't wanna lose you

Ow, uh, girl, I've got to have your sweet loving
'Cause without it, girl, I'll just lose my mind (Oh yeah)
The way you hold me comforts me and shows me
That a love like yours is hard to find
