Every night and every day
My heart feels the pain
I wake up to the thought of you
And I call your name

No one ever made me feel the way you do
Nothing in this world I wouldn't do for you
But now I've got to let go

We don't stand a chance
In this wild romance, my tender heart
Maybe it's wiser to walk away and love again
With my tender heart
We don't stand a chance
In this wild romance, whoa, it hurts so bad
Knowing that I'm not the one you want
I can't hold on to my tender heart

I never thought I'd be the one
Who would play the fool
But I know love can feel so good
And can be so cruel

It's clear to me the writing is on the wall
It's clear to me that you don't really love me at all
And I can't go on this way

We don't stand a chance
In this wild romance, my tender heart
Maybe it's wiser to walk away and love again
With my tender heart
We don't stand a chance
In this wild romance, whoa, it hurts so bad
Knowing that I'm not the one you want
I can't hold on to my tender heart

I'm standing at the door
Don't need this hurt no more
I'm crying out in vain
'Cause you don't feel my pain, oh

Maybe it was always gonna be this way
Maybe I'll look back and understand some day
But now I've got to say
We don't stand a chance
In this wild romance, my tender heart
Maybe it's wiser to walk away and love again
With my tender heart
We don't stand a chance
In this wild romance, oh, it hurts so bad
Knowing that I'm not the one you want
I can't hold on to my tender heart
