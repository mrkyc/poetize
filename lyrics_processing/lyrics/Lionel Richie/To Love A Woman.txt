I don't know what it is, but she drives me crazy
I don't know what she does, but she drives me wild
If only she could let me be the man I wanna be
Well, she can leave me helpless as a child

I don't know how it is, but she has the power
She can make me laugh when I wanna cry (Oh yeah)
She tells me that I'm in control, but I know it's just a lie

And I don't mind, oh
Will she love you tomorrow like she loves you today?
She can keep your heart guessing, but she's yours if she stays
And that's what it feels like
To love a woman
To love a woman

When you're looking in her eyes you can see forever (Forever)
You're captured by the beauty of her soul (Oh yeah)
You know you're never gonna find a woman like this again

So don't let go, no
Will she love you tomorrow like she loves you today?
She can keep your heart guessing but she's yours if she stays
And that's what it feels like
To love a woman
Oh, to love a woman

Oh she can take it away (Take it all way)
And oh whether it's wrong or right
You know it in the end, you'd do it all again
To love a woman
Just to love a woman (Uh-huh)

Oh, you know (Yes, I know, yes, I know)
She loves you tomorrow like she loves you today (Well, she loves you)
She can keep your heart guessing but she's yours if she stays (She's yours if she stays)
And that's what it feels like (I'm gonna say it)
And that's what it feels like (What it feels like oh)
And that's what it feels like
To love a woman
To love a woman (Mmm, hmm)
