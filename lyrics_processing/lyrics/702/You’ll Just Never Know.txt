I bet you never imagined
That one day, you'd look around
And I just wouldn't be there
So, I hear you're leavin'? (Oh)
Please, don't go
I wanna make it right (Ooh, ooh)
You know, 'cause tomorrow is just not promised (Oh-oh)
You never know what tomorrow holds
You just never know
Don't put it off till tomorrow today (Stay)
Make it last (Make it last)
For always (Always)

My pride, my destiny
I find a peace of mind when you're next to me
You changed my darkest hour, with the gleam from your eye
Simply smilin' on me makes my life complete
So, what's the use in fussin' and fightin', when
If you ever leave me, I would be so weak?
Oh baby, please understand, when I go to sleep at night
I wanna know that everything is alright
You never know

You just never know (Ooh)
Don't put it off till tomorrow today
Make it last forever (Ooh)
Forever and always (Oh, oh)
You just never know
Don't put it off till tomorrow today
Make it last forever (Mmm)
And ever, forever
Forever and always
You might also like
And I'm makin' sure that every time you're round me
You're recreating sweet, brand-new memories
Can't let these silly changes aggravate the love in me
Just for a moment, you can concentrate on me
Through slow dances in parking lots
And through hugs and kisses in the restaurant (In the restaurant)
Oh baby, you can't let the sun go down before you let me know
You're lovin' me, 'cause you never know

You just never know
Don't put it off till tomorrow today (Tomorrow, today)
Make it last forever
Forever and always (You, you)
You just never know (Ooh)
Don't put it off till tomorrow today (Baby, today)
Make it last forever
And ever, forever (Forever)
Forever and always (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

I can't imagine one day without you (Day without you)
Don't ever let it cross your mind whatever you do
Nothing else really matters to me
I'm gonna keep lovin' you every minute

You just never know
Don't put it off till tomorrow today
Make it last forever (Mm-hmm)
Forever and always (Mm-hmm, forever)
You just never know (You never know, no)
Don't put it off till tomorrow today (Don't you wait, don't you wait)
Make it last forever (Ever)
And ever, forever (And ever, oh)
Forever and always
You just never know
Don't put it off till tomorrow today (Tomorrow, today)
Make it last forever
Forever and always (Oh, ooh)
You just never know (No, you're never gonna know)
Don't put it off till tomorrow today (Don't do it)
Make it last forever (Forever)
And ever, forever
