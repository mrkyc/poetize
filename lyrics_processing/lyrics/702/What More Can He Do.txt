What more can He do?
Tell me, what more can He do?
He sent *loving arms down from the sky
'Cause He cares so much for you and I*
What more can He do?
Tell me, what more can He do?
He sent *loving arms down from the sky
'Cause He cares so much for you and I*

Never in my imagination
Did I ever see so clearly
That someone has so much concern for my life
Till Your love came and found me
You loved me when I didn't even love myself
A love that will be there when there's nobody else
So with my voice, I'll sing this little song of praise
'Cause when I think of what He's done, all I can say's...

What more can He do? (What more?)
Tell me, what more can He do? (He sent)
He sent *loving arms down from the sky
'Cause He cares so much for you and I* (You and I, oh)
What more can He do?
Tell me, what more can He do? (Mm-hmm)
He sent *loving arms down from the sky
'Cause He cares so much for you and I*
You might also like
You really didn't have a reason
To love me so much right from the start
I haven't done a lot of things that I'm proud of
But that is just the way of Your heart
*"Why me?" is what I keep on askin' myself
Just could've given this gift to anyone else
But You made me realize that I was special too
And that is something that You didn't have to do*

What more can He do? (Oh)
Tell me, what more can He do?
He sent *loving arms down from the sky (Oh)
'Cause He cares so much for you and I* (And I)
What more can He do? (Oh)
Tell me, what more can He do? (Can He do)
He sent *loving arms down from the sky
'Cause He cares so much for you and I* (Ay-hey)

Don't know why He loved me (Loved me)
Don't know why He cared (He cared)
Even though I really didn't deserve it (I'm still glad)
I'm still glad that He did, oh (Glad)
*Don't know why He loved me (Don't know why)
Don't know why He cared (I don't know why)
Even though I really didn't deserve it (Mm-mm)
I'm so glad that He did, oh* (Tell me, what more?)
What more can He do? (Yeah-yeah)
Tell me, what more can He do? (He do)

'Cause He cares so much for you and I* (You and I, I)
What more can He do?

'Cause He cares so much for you and I* (Sent his loving arms down)
What more can He do? (What more?)
