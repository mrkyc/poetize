Hey girl, hey, where you been?
Your phone still on? I've been tryin' to reach you
My mans and them said they saw you, and I was like
'Man, I got to call her, man; I got to get at her, man'
It's funny that I see you now
Girl, you so fine, look at you
What's your, wa wa wa wan wa wan blah blah blah blah

There you go, again, talking about, where have I been
Like I'm, your child, it is, none of your biz
Shut your mouth, I'm tired, of hearing you, running your trap
And by the way, I forgot to say that, your bags are packed

Why you wanna bother me?
Constantly paging me, driving me crazy
Talking that yadi ya
All up in my ear goin'
Blah Blah Blah Blah

Silence, I ain't hearin' no more, 'cause all I hear is
Blah Blah Blah Blah
Every time you open your mouth, all I hear is
Blah Blah Blah Blah
Always tryin' to put me in check, spittin' to me that
Blah Blah Blah Blah
Sorry, boy, you played yourself 'cause you keep sayin'
Blah Blah Blah Blah

See, that house you in, it's your mama's crib, you ain't got your own
Flossin' fakin' bling, Jay-Z wanna be, claimin' money ain't a thang
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, you ain't got shit, just admit it
See, I'm rollin' high, but you passin by, on the passenger side

Why you wanna bother me?
Constantly paging me, driving me crazy
Talking that yadi ya
Always in my ear goin'
Blah Blah Blah Blah

Silence, I ain't hearin' no more, 'cause all I hear is
Blah Blah Blah Blah
Every time you open your mouth, all I hear is
Blah Blah Blah Blah
Always tryin' to put me in check, spittin' to me that
Blah Blah Blah Blah
Sorry, boy, you played yourself 'cause you keep sayin'

You wonder why, I don't, call you
Baby, you're just not man enough for me, no no
'Cause every time you call my phone you just go on and on
Talking all that nonsense, I can't take no more
Oh, blah blah blah blah

Silence, I ain't hearin' no more, 'cause all I hear is
Blah Blah Blah Blah
Every time you open your mouth, all I hear is
Blah Blah Blah Blah
Always tryin' to put me in check, spittin' to me that
Blah Blah Blah Blah
Sorry, boy, you played yourself 'cause you keep sayin'
Blah Blah Blah Blah
Silence, I ain't hearin' no more, 'cause all I hear is
Blah Blah Blah Blah
Every time you open your mouth, all I hear is
Blah Blah Blah Blah
Always tryin' to put me in check, spittin' to me that
Blah Blah Blah Blah
Sorry, boy, you played yourself 'cause you keep sayin'
