Ooh, ooh, yeah yeah yeah, ooh ooh
Ooh yeah yeah

See, everybody needs someone by their side
And I can't go on without you another night
Since companionship's been gone
My life has been so slow without you, you

See, it don't take a rocket scientist to know I love you
And it don't take a rocket scientist to know I need you
See, if you believe that you and me can change the world someday
Then you'll believe me when I say

I still love you (You, you, you, you)
I still love you (You, you, you, you)
I decided I still love you (You, you, you, you)
I still love you (You, you, you, you)
I decided

So what do you think, let's get back together
(Let's get back together)
There's nothin' it could hurt, it could only get better
Think of what it last felt like
For you and I to turn our nights into forever, see
You might also like
See, it don't take a rocket scientist to know I love you
And it don't take a rocket scientist to know I need you
See, if you believe that you and me could change the world someday
Then you'll believe me when I say

I still love you (You, you, you, you)
I still love you (You, you, you, you)
I decided I still love you (You, you, you, you)
I still love you (You, you, you, you)
I still love you (You, you, you, you)
I still love you (You, you, you, you)
I decided I still love you (You, you, you, you)
I still love you (You, you, you, you)
I decided

Never dreamed I'd be so happy and sure of myself
Baby, life without you is so dark (So dark, so dark)
Now I know it'll never be me lovin' someone else
This precious love, you're my shining star

I remember when we first fell in love
I was too young to know what it was
I couldn't address what made me melt
But quick to tell you how it felt
That love was so real, and it still is
I still love you (Whoa whoa, whoa whoa)
I still love you (Whoa whoa, I still love)
I decided I still love you (Whoa whoa, whoa whoa)
I still love you (Whoa whoa, I still love)
I decided I still love you (Whoa whoa, whoa whoa)
(Just think of the things we planned to do, me and you)
I still love you (Whoa whoa)
(Like changing the face of the world that we once knew)
I decided I still love you (Whoa whoa, whoa whoa)
(So long as the sun is yellow, the oceans are blue)
I still love you (Whoa whoa)
(And then we can laugh and cry when days are through)
