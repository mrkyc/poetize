Yeah, eventually, we'll be together, baby
It may not be now, but we'll be together
Know what I'm saying? You hear me?

I'm so glad see to you
I can't believe what I've found
You got yourself together, trying to move to a higher ground
Now what have I been missing
Besides from the fact that you're fine
I'm into your mind, and all that comes with it
So many feelings to deal with
Oh yeah, and I wanna know

Where do we go from here?
Can we face our fear?
Into a love again, and remain friends
I believe that I wanna stay
So once again I'll be finding my way
Finding my way, finding my way back to you
Finding my way back to you

That's just what it will be
So won't you lead right there
And create a future
Build a life that we can share
That's what it's about
So do you mind hangin' out
Now 'til forever
Somehow I know we will end up together
(End up together) Oh, I wanna know

Where do we go from here?
Can we face our fear?
Into a love again, and remain friends
Where do we go?
See, I believe that I wanna stay
So once again I'll be finding my way
Finding my way, finding my way
Finding my Way back to you

I'll be finding my way, finding my way
I'll be finding my way, way

Where do we go from here?
