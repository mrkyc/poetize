So many nights
I felt your beating heart
As we were deep in the dark
I'd watch you sleepin' tight
Protect you from the light
As if you were a child
Then put a kiss on your lips

Don't you go breaking my heart
Stay for awhile
I'll make it alright (Make it alright)
Cause if you go breakin' my heart (Go breakin')
I won't survive (Can't survive)
So, stay for tonight

Oh, oh oh, this can't be right
'Cause each and every time
I look deep in your eyes
I see the shinin' stars
Beautiful work of art
Still, we just never part
Let's talk it through, you and I here tonight, oh
You might also like
Don't you go breakin' my heart
Stay for awhile
I'll make it alright (Make it alright)
'Cause if you go breakin' my heart (Go breakin')
I won't survive (Can't survive)
So stay for tonight

Is it somethin' that I should have done? (Should have done)
Tell me where did I go wrong
Is it somethin' that I could've said
To make you stay around the way?

Don't you go breakin' my heart
Stay for awhile
I'll make it alright (Make it alright)
'Cause if you go breakin' my heart (Go breakin')
I won't survive (Can't survive)
So stay for tonight
Don't you go breakin' my heart
Stay for awhile
I'll make it alright (Make it alright)
'Cause if you go breakin' my heart (Go breakin')
I won't survive (Can't survive)
So stay for tonight (So stay for tonight)
Don't you go breakin' my heart
Stay for awhile
I'll make it alright (Make it alright)
'Cause if you go breakin' my heart (Go breakin')
I won't survive (Can't survive)
So stay for tonight (So stay for tonight)
Don't you go breakin' my heart
Stay for awhile
I'll make it alright (Make it alright)
'Cause if you go breakin' my heart (Go breakin')
I won't survive (Can't survive)
