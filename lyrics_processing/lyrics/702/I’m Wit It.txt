You got a lot of character
The way that you carry yourself
The way you talk to me
You was tangible, so respectful, unforgettable
Baby, I love the way you be wit me
So why you coming at me about these material things
When I've never asked you for nothing?
I don't care about what you be having

Boy, stop it because I could care less
What you got in your pocket
Even though I must admit it's hot when you stop
And the wheels keep spinning
That's not the reason why I'm wit' it
It don't fade me
I'm happy that you're out there making your money
And yeah, I like it when we in the drop
And the top down, wind be blowing
That's not the reason why I'm wit' it

You got good manners, you always be to yourself
You really impress me
So don't go messing up being silly 'cause
'Cause you got your trust
I understand you're doing good
But don't let that go to your head
'Cause I could do with it or I could do without it
And don't you ever get it twisted
You might also like
Boy, stop it because I could care less
What you got in your pocket
Even though I must admit it's hot when you stop
And the wheels keep spinning
That's not the reason I'm wit it
It don't fade me
I'm happy that you out there making your money
And yeah I like it we in the drop
And the top down, wind be blowing
That's not the reason why I'm wit' it
Boy, stop it because I could care less
What you got in your pocket
Even though I must admit it's hot when you stop
And the wheels keep spinning
That's not the reason I'm wit' it
(Baby, I ain't wit' it)

Why you trippin' on the things you have?
The things that you have and the things you got
See, I'm not trippin' on where you live
Or the car that you drive
You got yours and I got mine
So don't you get to trippin'
Boy, stop it because I could care less
What you got in your pocket
Even though I must admit it's hot when you stop
And the wheels keep spinning
That's not the reason I'm wit' it
It don't fade me
I'm happy that you out there making your money
And yeah I like it we in the drop
And the top down, wind be blowing
That's not the reason why I'm wit' it

Boy, stop it
'Cause I could care less what you got in your pocket
Even though I must admit it's hot when you stop
Keep on spinning, reason I'm wit' it
I'm happy that you're out there making your money
When we in the drop and the top down
Even though I like it, but that ain't why I'm wit' it
