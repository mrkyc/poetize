Ha, yeah, come on
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ha, yeah
Hm, yeah, yeah

I'm gonna keep it real
How you make me feel
Boy, you give me chills, baby
I'm gonna break it down
You just drive me wild whenever you're around

You know how I do
And you know how I flow (do, how I flow)
Can I get your name and number? (get your name and number)
'Cause I like your steelo (hey, hey)
And I dig the way you move
And the way you do your thing (ooh, do your thing)
Baby, you can bring it on
You can swing it this way

Boy, it's something about you
That make me tell my friends
But they don't understand, no, no
They don't know your style
With your high profile
The flyest thing in town
You might also like
You know how I do
And you know how I flow (get your name and number, yeah)
Can I get your name and number?
'Cause I like your steelo (I like your steelo)
And I dig the way you move
And the way you do your thing (baby, bring it on)
Baby, you can bring it on
You can swing it this way

You stay on my mind
Think about you all the time
Got to get to know you well
If you kiss, then I won't tell
You stay on my mind
Think about you all the time
Got to get to know you well
If you kiss, then I won't tell
Kiss me, oh, hold me
I say, squeeze me
Oh, please me, whoa
Kiss me, oh, hold me
I say, squeeze me
Whoa, kiss me, oh
One, two, uh
Check it, check it, check it out
Follow, follow me many, many, many miles
One two, check it out
Lemme, lemme, lemme, lemme, lemme break it down
One, two, check it out
Follow, follow me many, many, many miles
One two, break it down
Lemme, lemme, lemme, lemme, lemme break it down
This track gets nasty like pornography
Word to Mommy, I like Joe but he sloppy, dag
Poppy got a brand new bag, for real
I take and 'Quel O'neil like Shaq, Shaq
Ask Michael Jackson, "Who's bad?"
He says I am, but the queen not drag, dag
I'm bad enough to let my pants sag
I be in Vegas where 702 be at, chillax

You know how I do
And you know how I flow (give me what I want, give me what I need)
Can I get your name and number? (I like your walk)
'Cause I like your steelo (crazy about your style)
And I dig the way you move (your style, so fly)
And the way you do your thing (boy, you are so fine)
Baby, you can bring it on (I love your pretty brown eyes)
You can swing it this way (here's what I want you to do for me, yeah)
Hey baby, hold me
Come on, stop
