You say you wanna be the one
But you still leave the job undone
You only call me when you're free
But you know that it ain't good enough for me
You're always dippin' with your friends
As if you're out there makin' ends
And know you're knockin' on my door
Well, I guess you weren't too busy before

You better make time if you wanna be with me
Can't you see
Show me I got everything you need
Everything
You better think twice if you wanna be with me
Next to me
If you wanna take the ride
You better make the time
You better make time if you wanna be with me
Ecstasy
Show me I got everything you need
Fantasy
You better think twice if you wanna be with me
Next to me
If you wanna take the ride
You better make the time
You might also like
There's other places I can be
If you're not careful you might see
Me out there with somebody else
If you do you can only blame it on yourself
I'm feeling you without a doubt
But I know how to do without
So don't you call me on the phone
Late at night when you don't wanna be alone
Don't wanna be part-time lovers
Don't wanna be your part-time lover
I gotta be more than just another
You know, you better know, baby

You better make time if you wanna be with me
Can't you see
Show me I got everything you need
Everything
You better think twice if you wanna be with me
Next to me
If you wanna take the ride
You better make the time
You better make time if you wanna be with me
Ecstasy
Show me I got everything you need
Fantasy
You better think twice if you wanna be with me
Next to me
If you wanna take the ride
You better make the time
(You better)
Gonna have to show me (Gonna have to show me)
You wanna be my one and only (You wanna be my one and only)
You're gonna have to prove it to me (Prove it, oh)
Don't wanna be a part-time lover (I don't wanna be no, no, no)
I gotta be more than just another (You better)

You better make time if you wanna be with me
Can't you see
Show me I got everything you need
Everything
You better think twice if you wanna be with me
Next to me
If you wanna take the ride
You better make the time
You better make time if you wanna be with me
Ecstasy
Show me I got everything you need
Fantasy
You better think twice if you wanna be with me
Next to me
If you wanna take the ride
You better make the time
You better make time if you wanna be with me
Can't you see
Show me I got everything you need
Everything
You better think twice if you wanna be with me
Next to me
If you wanna take the ride
You better make the time
You better make time if you wanna be with me
Ecstasy
Show me I got everything you need
