Tell your girl to stop callin' my phone (I like that)
Tell her to get a life and leave us alone (whoo)
Will she get over it and leave us be
Gotta take care of yours
But you still gotta be with me
(Verse 1)
I got somethin' on my mind
So I'm 'bout to speak my peace 'cause
I'm sick of all the calls and
I'm tired of all the beef
Callin' my crib 7 days a week
Hangin' up with nothin' to say
She hate me 'cause I got your love
She's the one that got your baby
(Chorus)
Tell your girl to stop callin' my phone (I like that)
Tell her to get a life and leave us alone (whoo)
Will she get over it and leave us be
Gotta take care of yours
But you still gotta be with me
(Verse 2)
'cause the closer I get to you
The minute she's all up in your crib
Talkin' 'bout how ya'll should work it out
And it would be better for the kid
But she won't pull that shit on me
'cause I'm hip to the game
It ain't got nuthin' to do with her
So why she keep frontin' wit you and me
You might also like(Chorus)
Tell your girl to stop callin' my phone
Tell her to get a life and leave us alone
Will she get over it and leave us be
Gotta take care of yours
But you still gotta be with me
(Verse 3)
I know that everyday (everyday)
You think to turn this way (no, no, no)
I know you made mistakes and you wish that it would change
Once you look outside of things
You get nothin' but love from me so so
I'ma hold it down for you
No matter what anybody else do to you baby
(Bridge)
Tell your girl Don't call my phone
Tell her to leave Leave us alone
Tell your girl Don't call my phone
Why don't she leave Leave us alone
(Chorus)
Tell your girl to stop callin' my phone
Tell her to get a life & leave us alone
Will she get over it & leave us be
Gotta take care of yours
