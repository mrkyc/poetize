Hey, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Hey, yeah, ay yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

I've been watching you
Wondering when you
When you gon' notice that
I've been looking, all the while
Just been hoping that maybe
I can get you right where I want you
I heard that you got a girl
But I can't sweat that none
'Cause when I see something I want, I get what I want

Betcha she don't do you like me
Betcha top dollar she don't move you like me
Betcha she
Betcha that she don't turn you on
You know that I'm the one you really want
Betcha she can't rock it like me
Bet you all I got she ain't hotter than me
Betcha she don't, betcha she won't

I gotta be up front (Who knows)
And if I sound real blunt (Hey)
It's only 'cause I'm the type to put my feelings on the line
Every time I see something I like
Your girl says she loves you but
I cannot pay attention to anything I hear from her
Boy, you know she must not be
Trying to keep a hold on you while you're here with me
You might also like
You're so fine
I want you to be the one
I call mine for sure (Yeah, for sure)
'Cause she's not right (No)
I ain't trying to be a hater or nothing
But let me tell you something
She lost her game
That's why I gotta do my thing

Betcha she don't do you like me
Betcha top dollar she don't move you like me
Betcha she
Betcha that she don't turn you on
You know that I'm the one you really want
Betcha she can't rock it like me
Bet you all I got she ain't hotter than me
Betcha she don't, betcha she won't

Baby, I wanna do all the things you girl won't do, do, baby
'Cause the bottom line is this: I do, she don't
And the bottom is that: I will, she won't
Boy, once you're over here, said there ain't no turnin' back
Betcha she don't do you like me
Betcha top dollar she don't move you like me
Betcha she
Betcha that she don't turn you on
You know that I'm the one you really want
Betcha she can't rock it like me
Bet you all I got she ain't hotter than me
Betcha she don't, betcha she don't need your love
Betcha she won't, betcha she don't need your love now, baby
Betcha she don't do you like me
Betcha top dollar she don't move you like me
Betcha she
Betcha that she don't turn you on
You know that I'm the one you really want
Betcha she can't rock it like me
Bet you all I got she ain't hotter than me
Betcha she don't, betcha she don't need your love
Betcha she won't, betcha she don't need your love now, baby
