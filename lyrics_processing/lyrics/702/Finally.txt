I couldn't breathe
I couldn't see
I couldn't think
I cannot believe
How good it felt when we touched
Yea, yea
I couldn't fight
I couldn't try
I couldn't hide
I cannot deny
That lightening can strike more than once
Finally, I know everything is possible
Finally, I know everything that some things our beyond our control
Finally I know all is fair in love & war
Finally I know there's no need for keeping score
No need to worry
I didn't see
I didn't want
I didn't need
I did not recognize
That love was there inside your ride, yea
I didn't say
I didn't ask
I didn't complain
I did not resign
But somethin' happened that felt so right

I can't describe it
But I know that I like it - what you do
Finally I know everything is possible
Finally I know everything that some things our beyond our control
Finally I know all is fair in love & war
Finally I know there's no need for keeping score
No need to worry
Finally I know that life has a guarantee
& nothing' tears the flame
& everything must shame
Finally I've come to realize
That there is a reason for every season
I was so amazed by the magic that I found in you
(that I, that I found found in you)
I can't describe it
But I know that I like it - what you do (what you do)
Finally I know everything is possible
Finally I know everything that some things our beyond our control
Finally I know all is fair in love & war
Finally I know there's no need for keeping score
No need to worry
