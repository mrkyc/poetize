Something about you
I can't live without you
Want you to be with me, yeah
Got me losing control
And I can't let you go
Here is where you need to be, yeah
Feeling your energy
And it's killing me
My baby, I like your steez
You be moving me
So drastically
I'll do anything you please
Only you on my mind
And it's hard to define
What makes me into you
Just like Venus and Mars
We were written in the stars
Thinkin' we should continue
Maybe I should just face it
'Cause boy, I can't take it
This can't be circumstance
I'm in disbelief so many feelings
And love deserves a chance
(Love deserves a chance)

And the slang in ya talk
Just your style over all is sweet, yeah
From your head to your feet
Kissing you makes me weak
You make me wanna be sneaky
With your sexy eyes
That I can't deny
Got me hypnotized so deep
You're me type of guy
Hittin' you gets me high
Single love affair with me
I just wanna be
Your only queen
On the throne of eternity, yeah
'Cause our chemistry
Is amazingly
Overall a growing seed
I can't run from my heart
You were mine from the start
Just to deal I'll you breathe
Whatever, you're just my type
And I gotta be your wife
'Cause I need you in my life
(Need you in my life)
