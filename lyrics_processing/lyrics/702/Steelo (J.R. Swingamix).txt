I'm gonna keep it real
How you make me feel
Boy, you give me chills, baby
I'm gonna break it down
You just drive me wild whenever you're around

You know how I do
And you know how I flow
Can I get your name and number
'Cause I like your steelo
And I dig the way you move
And the way you do your thing
(Do your thing)
Baby, you can bring it on
You can swing it this way

Boy, it's something about you
That make me tell my friends
But they don't understand, no no
They don't know your style
With your high profile
The flyest thing in town
You might also like
You know how I do
And you know how I flow
Can I get your name and number
'Cause I like your steelo
(I like your steelo)
And I dig the way you move
And the way you do your thing
Baby, you can bring it on
You can swing it this way

You stay on my mind
Think about you all the time
Got to get to know you well
If you kiss then I won't tell
You stay on my mind
Think about you all the time
Got to get to know you well
If you kiss then I won't tell
Kiss me
Oh, hold me
I say squeeze me
Oh, squeeze me, whoa
Kiss me
Oh, hold me
I say squeeze me
Oh, kiss me, whoa
Ha
One, two, uh
Check it, check it, check it out
Follow, follow me
Many, many, many miles, uh
One, two, check it out
Lemme, lemme, lemme, lemme, lemme break it down
Ha ha ha
One two
Check it out
Follow, follow me
Many, many, many miles
Ha ha ha
One two, break it down
Lemme, lemme, lemme, lemme, lemme break it down
This track is nasty like pornography

Check it out
You know how I do
And you know how I flow
Can I get your name and number
'Cause I like your steelo
And I dig the way you move
And the way you do your thing
Baby, you can bring it on
You can swing it this way

Give me what I want
Give me what I need
I like your whole breezy vibe, your style
Your style's so fly, boy, you are so fine
I love your pretty brown eyes
Here's what I want you to do for me, yeah

Hold me
Come on, stop
