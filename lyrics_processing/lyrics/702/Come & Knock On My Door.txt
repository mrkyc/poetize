I anticipate, you told me that you wouldn't be late
Boy, here I wait
Got the candles lit so boy don't you hesitate
Prepare to be amazed
I'll bend to every move that you make
You can have it your way
I got the wine on ice
'Cause I'm sure we'll be up late

You got me buggin' buggin'
For you I'm always open
More kisses and more huggin'
Lovin' everything you do to me
No matter what the time is
You are always invited
On me, I'll never fight it
Don't take me wrong
Just wanna turn you on

Come and knock on my door
I've been waiting on you
'Cause your love is on time
I can't get enough of you
Can't be faking what's real
I'll just tell you what's true
That I love it when I turn you on
Come and knock on my door
I've been waiting on you
'Cause your love is on time
I can't get enough of you
Can't be faking what's real
I'll just tell you what's true
That I love it when I turn you on
You might also like
Come as fast as you can
I want everything to go as planned
'Cause tonight you're gonna win
Ready to give in 'cause you're not that average man
It's been a long time since
I let my guard down and let you in
It was you that I missed
Let's cut right to the chase
And just handle this

You got me buggin' buggin'
For you I'm always open
More kisses and more huggin'
Lovin' everything you do to me
No matter what the time is
You are always invited
On me, I'll never fight it
Don't take me wrong
Just wanna turn you on

Come and knock on my door
I've been waiting on you
'Cause your love is on time
I can't get enough of you
Can't be faking what's real
I'll just tell you what's true
That I love it when I turn you on
Come and knock on my door
I've been waiting on you
Your love is on time
Can't get enough of you
Can't be faking what's real
I'll just tell you what's true
That I love it when I turn you on
I like it, I like it, I really really like it
I'm for it, adore it
So come knock on my door
I like it, I like it, I really really like it
I'm for it, adore it
So come knock on my door

Come and knock on my door
I've been waiting on you
'Cause your love is on time
I can't get enough of you
Can't be faking what's real
I'll just tell you what's true
That I love it when I turn you on
Come and knock on my door
I've been waiting on you
'Cause your love is on time
Can't get enough of you
Can't be faking what's real
I'll just tell you what's true
That I love it when I turn you on
