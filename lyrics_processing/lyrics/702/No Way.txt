Everything you do is gonna hurt you
(You should know that's)
Just how things are, boy, you can't have me
(Don't mistake me)
For the average girl, I don't come easy
(You gotta work for it)
Can't be wasting my time, you don't deserve me
See, there is no way

You want something
But you're talking 'bout nothing
One day you'll be wishing
You'll come to realize there's
No way you can get it
Your tired game you should fix it
Must've got me twisted
Your same old lines I can't take
(No way) No way
La, lalala lalala, lalala lalala, lalala lalala
La, lalala lalala, lalala lalala, lalala lalala

My game is so tight you can't fade me
(I'm not that type)
To come a dime a dozen, baby, yeah
(Check yourself and)
Go find somebody else, don't play me
(Let me be real)
It's irritating, I can't fake it, won't you spare me

No way, no way
You can't keep on buggin' no way, no way
