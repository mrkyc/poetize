What we had was a thing of the past
And I recall showering you with gifts, you never had to ask
Thought love was real
Damn near gave you my last, bracelets with the karats
Purchasing class, that was me
Now you're alone and empty, bitter
To put it simply, I know you miss me
And that must be a hard pill to swallow
I feel for your man, I'm a hard act to follow

How I've found the time to think of what we had before?
When everybody that I know is dancing on the floor
Since you left, the time has been so slow
Well, ready, come light up my mind, where else can I go?

See, I need you, boy
I honestly think I'm impairing my health
See, I need you, boy
That's probably why I dance with myself

You're my star (my star)
It's such a wonder how you shine (oh)
So no matter how far (no matter how far you go)
I'm dancin' with you in my mind (yeah, yeah)
You might also like
Baby, it's cool with me
You left it off as friends
Oh, but I know it won't be long until it's on again
We'll be harmony to every note
You could come inside, kick it if you like
Whatever floats your boat

See, I need you, boy, uh
I honestly think I'm impairing my health
See, I need you, boy, yeah
That's probably why I dance with myself (you're)

You're my star (my shining star)
It's such a wonder how you shine
So no matter how far
I'm dancing with you in my mind

Baby, we used to
We used to walk and talk (talk)
And you would hold my hand (hand)
And by the time we finished talking (talking)
We were running out of land (land)
And I can't wait until we move together, again
You came to the home, to the water-front castle
Hopped on my king-sized bed and we wrestled
Closet full of thousand-dollar shoes with the tassel
You heard the chef, you know what he asked you
What you like to eat?
Meanwhile, Donatello on the other line asking to massage your feet
We'd laugh all day, nights we'd treasure
Damn, it's a shame that we couldn't stay together

Baby, we used to
We used to walk and talk (talk)
And you would hold my hand (hand)
And by the time we finished talking (talking)
We were running out of land (land)
And I can't wait until we move together, again

Oh, baby
You know I miss you so much
It's like you got the Midas touch

You're my star (you're my, my shining star)
It's such a wonder how you shine (so no matter how far)
So no matter how far (oh, I'm dancing with you)
I'm dancin' with you in my mind (you)
You're my star (you're my, my, my, my)
It's such a wonder how you shine (how you shine, yeah, yeah, yeah)
So no matter how far (how far, I'm dancing)
