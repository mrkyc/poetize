He's got it all, he's on the money and
He's spending, he knows what he wants
He's got it all, he'll sign your pity and
It's no thang, he's that Pootie Tang

Somebody's on the floor
Ain't just another smooth talkin' brother
Everybody's looking at him as
He puts his tie down, the ladies on the dance floor
He's got the whole world wrapped around his finger
A one woman man and you know he understand
Casanova with a bitsy cline
Can tell he's gonna go all night

He's got it all, he's on the money and
He's spending, he knows what he wants
He's got it all, he'll sign your pity and
It's no thang, he's that Pootie Tang

He's pimp to the core
He got a belt buckle rocket, you know where he got it
He's a bammy by trade and
You could see him on the corner doing business on his tippy-tie
Driving his convertible, keeping track of all his girls
He's the CEO of his own world
He commands R-E-S-P-E-C-T
And you know he's good to go all night

He's got it all, he's on the money and
He's spending, he knows what he wants
He's got it all, he'll sign your pity and
It's no thang, he's that Pootie Tang

On the Tang tip, turnin' heads, can't let 'em take ya
Pootie be packin', pleasing ladies, they payin' paper
