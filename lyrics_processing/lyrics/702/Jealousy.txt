Oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah yeah

It's like I hear it every day
How you gon' dog me out
Don't know what they're talkin' 'bout
They don't even know you
They tell me you're caught up in the streets
As if they follow you
Watching your every move
They have too much time on their hands
They say

They say you're bad for me
They say you're no good (No good)
Don't want us happy (No no)
I say it's jealousy
They're just wishing they could be me (Oh yeah)

I don't even look at them as friends
More so acquaintances
Just can't be trusting these chicks
They're so quick to backstab you
It's happened to me many times, oh yeah
They plant seeds of doubt
And try to take what's rightfully mine
Mine, but I can see right thru their attempts
Trying to turn me against you, you, you, you
You might also like
They say you're bad for me
They say you're no good
Don't want us happy
I say it's jealousy
They're just wishing they could be me
(And they say)
They say we'll break up
Why don't I just wake up?
I say they're full of envy and jealousy
They're just wishing they could be me

(And I don't see)
I don't see why they can't just leave us alone
(Leave us alone)
Instead of always trying to break up our happy home
You'd think they'd wanna find a love of their own
(But they don't, so they say)

They say you're bad for me
They say you're no good
Don't want us happy
I say it's jealousy
They're just wishing they could be me
(And they say)
They say we'll break up
Why don't I just wake up?
I say they're full of envy and jealousy
They're just wishing they could be me
(And they say you're)
They say you're bad for me
They say you're no good
Don't want us happy
I say it's jealousy
They're just wishing they could be me
They say we'll break up
Why don't I just wake up?
I say they're full of envy and jealousy
