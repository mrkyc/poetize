When I first saw you
I just knew I had to have you
And all I need is just one night with you

You're the type that I dream about in my fantasy, I swear
And no reason that we ain't together far as I can see
No disrespect to who you came here with
But this ain't where I want to be
So, tell your boys they can take your car, you can ride with me
(Don't be scared)
From the very first time that I saw your lips
Boy, I knew you'd be the one
Tell me, can we make love? (Please)

Because God really made you so fine
I wanna make you all mine
Where are you from? Where have you been?
Baby, take me there, you and I could go places
There are so many things on my mind
I should let you hit it just one time
Where are you from? Where have you been?
Baby, take me there, you and I could go places
You might also like
There's a secret place that I wanna to take you
But first you got to get in the mood (Follow me)
It's a private place only love we're making
And know that we can get there real soon
I bet our bodies make good conversation without even saying a word
(Hush)
Over over over again and again

From the very first time that I kiss your lips
Boy, I met the morning sun
Tell me, can we make love?

Because God really made you so fine
I wanna make you all mine
Where are you from? Where have you been?
Baby, take me there, you and I could go places
There are so many things on my mind (So many things)
I should let you hit it just one time
(Wanna make you mine)
Where are you from, where have you been
Baby take me there, you and I could go places
(We can go places)
Hey you, over there, yeah you, number three
Ain't no reason, that we shouldn't leave this place
And you know it just be you and me
I love my friends, but, this ain't where I want to be, unh-uh
So let me take you to a place
Where, you know, we can both be free

From the very first time that I saw your lips
Boy, I knew you'd be the one
Tell me, can we make love?
From the very first time that I kissed your lips
Boy, I met the morning sun
You're the one I dream of

Because God really made you so fine
I wanna make you all mine
Where are you from? Where have you been?
Baby, take me there, you and I could go places
There are so many things on my mind (So many things)
I should let you hit it just one time
Where are you from? Where have you been?
Baby, take me there, you and I could go places
God really made you so fine
I wanna make you all mine
Where are you from? Where have you been?
Baby, take me there, you and I could go places
There are so many things on my mind
I should let you hit it just one time
Where are you from? Where have you been?
Baby, take me there, you and I could go places
God really made you so fine
I wanna make you all mine
Where are you from? Where have you been?
Baby, take me there, you and I could go places
I've been waiting, I've been waiting all day
Oh, it feels so good
Ooh, oh yeah, ooh, oh, oh, oh, yeah yeah
Let me show you how it feels to be loved by an angel
Let me take you (Let me take you, let me take you, baby)
Come and feel me, baby, feel me up
Let me take you
('Cause I love you, I love you, I love you, baby)
Let me show you how it feels to be loved, by an angel
