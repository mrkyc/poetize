All I want is someone I can talk to
Someone who will listen to what I have to say
All I need is some special attention
Someone who will mention the special things in me

I'm not the kind of girl

The kind of man to treat me right
I know he'll be strong
He'll keep me going on
I'll know him when he comes
He'll be my number one

Takes time from busy days
To satisfy my needs
Says things to comfort me
It's not much to ask for
The things I want
I'll know him when he comes
He'll be my number one
