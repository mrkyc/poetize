We gotta get down
To what it's all about
See, and I want you
And that's no doubt
We gotta get down
To what it's all about
See, and I want you
And that's no doubt

I can tell you notice me
Only because I notice you
Walked through the crowd to get your name
And to give you my tune
'Cause we gotta get down

We gotta get down
To what it's all about (To what it's all about)
See, and I want you (See, and I want you, yeah-yeah)
And that's no doubt (That's no doubt)
We gotta get down (We gotta get down, baby)
To what it's all about (See, I want you)
See, and I want you (You want me too)
And that's no doubt
You might also like
We don't have to talk about
All the things we've been through
Just as long as you respect me
Get to the point, don't mess around
Let's talk about how we feel now
I just wanna know
How we could take this thing that we feel
To a level where love is real
Take it slow
So we can last
Look to the future, forget the past

We gotta get down (We gotta, yeah)
To what it's all about (Baby, I want you)
See, and I want you
And that's no doubt (And that's no doubt)
We gotta get down (We gotta get down)
