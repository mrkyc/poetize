Here we go again, you're about to cry
I'm about to listen to another nigga's lie
Every time you call, you want good advice
And every time you ask I tell you everything's all right
First you let it go, then gave him one more chance
This time number makes number three, it's a different circumstance
Women on the side, babies mamas too
This time I can't hold back, I think he's running game on you

If you don't know where your man is
And he left you home with both of your kids
Girl, your mans a ho, a playa, certified ho
Ho, ho, ho
If he can't call home to explain
And all a sudden everything has changed
Girl, your mans ho, a playa, certified ho

You say your man gets off from work at nine
So why'd he turn his cell phone off 'til one clock at night?
I'm trying to tell you like a friend
That if you think smell fish, you do girlfriend
He's been cheating on you
Don't take a blind man to see
That you're just holding on for what you wish that this could be
But see, every man's got his own set of rules
Lines that he won't cross if he's being true to you
You might also like
If you don't know where your man is
And he left you home with both of your kids
Girl, your man's a ho, a playa, certified ho
Ho, ho, ho
If he can't call home to explain
And all a sudden everything has changed
Girl, your man's a ho, a playa, certified ho

And I don't want
See, I don't want to come across
Like I'm coming down on all of my playas
But if you got a family waiting at home
You should be there, you should there
This goes out to all of my ladies and the fellas
Waiting for someone they love to come home
If they're not there and they should be there
Then it's certified (Certified), he's a certified ho

If you don't know where your man is
And he left you home with both of your kids
Girl, your man's a ho, a playa, certified ho
Ho, ho, ho (He done played you for the last time)
If he can't call home to explain
And all a sudden everything has change
Girl, your man's a ho, a playa, certified ho
If you don't know where your man is
And he left you home with both of your kids
Girl, your man's a ho, a playa, certified ho
Ho, ho, ho
If he can't call home to explain
And all a sudden everything has change
