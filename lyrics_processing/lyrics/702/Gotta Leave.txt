You got me pullin' my hair
From all your fussin' and fightin'
And you came into my heart
And you was not invited (Oh oh)
Boy, who you think you are?
With no invitation
I heard about boys like you
I just didn't know what I was facin'
What's your occupation?

Why you ruinin' me?
Why you do, why you do
These things to me
Who are you, who are you?
You're bein' mean to me
I gotta go, gotta leave
Why you do it to me?
Why, why, why you do it to me?
(Tell me, baby, why)
Why you ruinin' me?
Why you do, why you do
These things to me
Who are you, who are you?
You're bein' mean to me
I gotta go, gotta leave
Why you do it to me?
Why, why, why you do it to me?

Now I'm too young to be stressed out
But you don't know what I'm feelin'
Boy, I done had it with you
I had it up to the ceilin'
Had it up, had it up, had it up
I tried to work it out
But I can't deal with a heartache
I know 'bout boys like you
And you learn from your mistake
And you was a mistake, oh

Why you ruinin' me?
Why you do, why you do
These things to me
Who are you, who are you?
You're bein' mean to me
I gotta go, gotta leave
Why you do it to me?
Why, why, why you do it to me?

Why you do it to me?

Hold up, wait a minute
You could prevent it
I know what you are all about
I knew from the beginnin'
So I guess now you're finished
