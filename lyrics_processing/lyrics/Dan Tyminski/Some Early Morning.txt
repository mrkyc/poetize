Ran out of cash when I paid my tab, so I headed home
The night was black, the air was thick as I wandered past the bar
Then the shot rang out, and I heard a scream beside me in the dark
Afraid that maybe I'd be next, I started to run
Just as fast as my feet would go, into the barrel of a gun
The lawman's light was blinding me, he said why'd you do it son
Two weeks later in criminal court, I was up on murder one
Maybe some early morning, in a pasture of green
Beside the still water, I'll awake from this dream
This terrible dream

Well I sat there in the courtroom, as the tears ran down my face
A guilty man is free somewhere and they put me in his place
The jury read the verdict and the judge called out my name
He said young man, you'll spend your life wearing the ball and chain
Now I'm staring at the ceiling, as I lay here on my bed
Fourteen long and lonely years, it's where I laid my head
Behind these cold gray prison walls, time sure passes slow
And unless I die tomorrow, I've still got a life to go
=CHORUS=
Maybe some early morning, in a pasture of green
Beside the still water, I'll awake from this dream
This terrible dream
=CHORUS=

In the cold walls of this prison, my heart has turned to stone
The lights are growing dimmer as I take my final breath
I can smell the air of freedom as I close my eyes in death
=CHORUS=
Maybe some early morning, in a pasture of green
Beside the still water, I'll awake from this dream
