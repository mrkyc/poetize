WoohoohoooOhooo
Blackbird on the old church steeple
Spanish moss hanging in the setting sun
Every house house has got a bible and a loaded gun
We've got preachers and politicians
Round here its kinda hard to tell which one
Is gonna do more talking with a crooked tongue
This towns got the good lord shakin' his head
Lookin' down thinking we ain't heard a word he said
Word he said
Baptized in southern gothic
In the garden of good and evil
Devil right here who whould'a thought it
In a town full of God fearin' people
Dogs and deadbolts guard the night
Nothing left to do but kneel and pray
We've got a church on every corner
So why does heaven feel so far away
Far away
Must be something in the muddy water
Turns the whisky 'bout as sweet as sin
Every drunk in town can sing a brown bag hymn
Good fences make good neighbors
But good neighbors make good lovers too
When your man ain't home any man will do

So why does heaven feel so far away (far away)
High on homegrown, smokin' that brimstone
Momma ain't stoppin', poppin' that cotton
No happy ever after, waitin' on the rapture now
