The day I saved your life
But I couldn't
It could've been
But there ain't no use in crying
For what should've been
Now even though it rains it's funny
'Cause around you it was always sunny
The days with you will fall loose in my mind
And everything you touch looks brighter
When you kiss me I'm a little lighter
Look inside my heart I hope you'll find
A place where you can lock the door and hide
'Cause even though you're gone
This ain't goodbye
There never is a soothing lullaby
To be clever with
Let go of it
You know you'll always try
But there never is
Now even though it rains it's funny
'Cause around you it was always sunny
The days with you will fall loose in my mind
And everything you touch looks brighter
When you kiss me I'm a little lighter
You look inside my heart I hope you'll find
A place where you can lock the door and hide
'Cause even though you're gone
This ain't goodbye
You might also likeAnd I know the place that you should go
It's like a prison can't you see
The only one that sets you free
Now I remember when you told me
If I have to go then always hold me
I'm in every star that shinning in the sky
Even though it rains it's funny
'Cause around you it was always sunny
The days with you will fall loose in my mind
And everything you touch looks brighter
When you kiss me I'm a little lighter
If you look inside my heart I hope you'll find
A place where you can lock the door and hide
'Cause even though you're gone
This ain't goodbye
Even though you're gone
This ain't goodbye
Even though you're gone
