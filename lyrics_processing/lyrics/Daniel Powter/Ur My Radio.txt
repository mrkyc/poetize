It's a kind of strange
It's a kind of crazy
The way you got me thinking is never maybe
Should I stay or should I go now
'Cause you are the only one I ever wanna hold now
You make me dance
You make my soul shake
You're making me forget I ever had a heartbreak
And when you're gone, you know it's okay
I'll keep your love in a box for a rainy day
Now, you know it's true
There's nothing I wouldn't do
For you, for you
You make my heart beat, here it goes
Hey, kiss me, you're my radio
You turn me up when I'm feeling low
Sing to me, make my heart beat, you know
Kiss, kiss, kiss me, you're my radio
Hey, kiss me, you're my radio
Turn me up, turn me up, you
Sing to me, make my heart beat like 1, 2, 3
Kiss me, you're my radio now

I take a fast car or a jet plane
It spin me up speed, spin me like a hurricane
It doesn't matter
If it's morning night or noon
I'd take a rocket ship and meet you on the moon, yeah
Now, you know it's true
There's nothing I wouldn't do
For you, for you
You make my heart beat, here it goes
