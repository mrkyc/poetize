But I must have been a fool
I got no excuses
So I wrote this song for you
Whatever the reasons
Did you come to say goodbye
I'm hoping for one more try
I wanted to change your mind
So I pick up the pieces
I swallowed all my pride
I don't wanna wake up
Feeling this empty inside
Did it spin you around?
Did it turn you upside down?
I wonder when you found out
That I'm a waste of your time
So don't give up on me
(Don't give up on me)
I never meant to steal your smile
I haven't seen it for a while
And don't, don't give up on me
(Don't give up on me)
Just try to understand
That I can be a better man
You might also likeI tell you once just don't give up on me, yeah
I tell you once just don't give up on me
And now I feel that I'm out of place
I look for you on every stranger's face
I don't think I can do this any more
(Don't think I can do this any more)
And every little thing just falls apart
From the very first day
That I broke your heart
It only makes me want you more and more
Just like before
'Cause you spin me around
And now you turn me upside down
I never meant to be a waste of your time
So don't give up on me
(Don't give up on me)
I never meant to steal your smile
I haven't seen it for a while
And don't, don't give up on me
(Don't give up on me)
Just try to understand
That I can be a better man
I tell you once just don't give up on me
I could fall if you're not there at all
And what am I supposed to do?
I tell you once just don't give up on me
