That moved up in my block
At 6 foot 2 and knee socks high
And class of 80 rocks
She's got hips that sway for you
She's got legs that never really stop
She asked me if my momma dressed me
And I do like I should
From East Delroy to 51st
I run this neighborhood
She just smiles and says to me
"I just wanna know if we're all good"
She said "tell me once again"
"Why would you lie to me"
She said "do me like you should"
"Why won't you try for me"
It all depends on you
And where would you rather be
'Cause I' got everything you want
So take me back to
Your expensive restaurant
You can't trust me, we won't make it
Let me put you in the mood
She said "no, no, I've been there before"
"You got that attitude"
You sold me out before all this
And now I'm fabulous
Without you
You might also like"Tell me once again"
"Why would you lie to me"
She said "do me like you should"
"Why won't you try for me"
It all depends on you
And where would you rather be
'Cause I got everything you want
So take me back to your
Why did it take so long
It's all gone wrong
And I can say
That I've got everything you need
Who's like you
It's time for you to believe
"Tell me once again"
"Why would you lie to me"
She said "do me like you should"
"Why won't you try for me"
It all depends on you
And where would you rather be
"Tell me once again"
"Why would you lie to me"
She said "do me like you should"
"Why won't you try for me"
It all depends on you
