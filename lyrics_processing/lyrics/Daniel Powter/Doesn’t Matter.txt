If you're never really part of the scene
If you're the football star
Or you're the homecoming queen
It doesn't matter if you pass
Or whether you fail
As long as you try
Baby you've got the wind in your sails
It doesn't matter
What you're called you know
If you're big or if you're small also
It doesn't matter now
It doesn't matter at all
So laugh when you're down
'Cause that's the way you prove it
You smile and you frown
And you never have to lose it
Now when you're on top
Remember where you came from
You'll never stop and you know
It doesn't matter at all
It doesn't matter if you're scared
And you're changing your course
It doesn't matter if you're married
Or you just got divorced
It doesn't matter if you lose
Or come in last place
It only matters you try
And baby stay in the race

What you're called you know
If you're big or if you're small also
It doesn't matter now
It doesn't matter at all
So laugh when you're down
'Cause that's the way you prove it
You smile and you frown
And you never have to lose it
Now when you're on top
Remember where you came from
You'll never stop and you know
It doesn't matter at all
It doesn't really matter at all
So laugh when you're down
'Cause that's the way you prove it
You smile and you frown
And you never have to lose it
Now when you're on top
Remember where you came from
You'll never stop and you know

So laugh when you're down

You smile and you frown
And you never have to lose it at all
