When things don't go your way (your way)
Ask yourself what you're made of (you're made of)
When there's nothing left to say (left to say)
Don't give up, don't give in
Everyday is a chance to start again
Don't give up, don't give in
'Cause it's a place that we've all been (we've all been)
(We've all been)
It's somewhere that we've all been
So raise a glass to all the days you lost
You know that times get hard
You know that times get rough
But when the day is done
You never really messed up
So cheers to all the days
Raise a glass
Cheers to us
One thing that I've always known (always known)
When I feel I'm lonely I'm not alone (not alone)
It's what you give not what you take (what you take)
It's how you learn to laugh at your mistakes (your mistakes)
