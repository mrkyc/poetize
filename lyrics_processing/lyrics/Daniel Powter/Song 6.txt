You snapshot the girl in Tuscany
I didn't know or recommend at the time
You're acting out of line
And I don't need you any more
Seeing something new is what I'm hoping for
I'm gonna lose and go for a ride
Seeming that I've got time
So let's lie in the sun
You didn't want the world to know
But I'm not strong and you'll find out
How you girl likes rock n' roll
So let's swoon and get high
You know you'd better come and get right
I don't know if we're still alive
But the best comes back tonight
If it's good and you're gone
You hope you won't stay too long
You take like a fool, you bed some man
You take like a fool tonight
And some good, some bad
I'm sticking to the vibe we have
You take like a fool, you bed some man
You take like a fool you know

I don't know if we're still alive
But the best comes back tonight
Leave in me
On the backside still cold now
I'm on time
I feel now I'm all cold
(I am over here)
Everything's gonna be alright
(I am now timing)
(I'll call out, I'll call out)
So let's lie in the sun
You didn't want the world to know
