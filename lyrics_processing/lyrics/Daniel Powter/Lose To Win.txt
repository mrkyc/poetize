But the story is the same as before
You're looking in the mirror
But you just don't see yourself anymore
So give up what you know
What you learned and what you're all about
As long as you don't give up on you
Then you can find your way out
It don't take any money don't take nothing
But what you have inside
It doesn't matter if you fall now
It only counts if you try
So pull the blinds and let the light shine through
Don't you think it's time for the light
To finally shine right on you
So let them know what's underneath it all
You won't fall
And baby you will move mountains too
There is nothing really left for you to prove
'Cause everybody knows you lose before you win
And if you're finally at the end of your rope
Well then you just begin
When the world feels like it's left you behind
Just get back up and you will find
Everybody knows in the end
You got to lose just to win
