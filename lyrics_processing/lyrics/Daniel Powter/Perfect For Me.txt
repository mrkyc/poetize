Then fallen off
I had angels and both arms
Cameras exposing my heart
And I've seen so called friends
Fade away when parties end
They're shallow and phony
They really don't know me at all
And now I open doors
That were locked for me before
And I'm not scared to cry anymore
I like to sing in the rain and be out of key
I can dance by myself I don't need a beat
I know I'm not perfect
Don't know if I'll ever be
I can laugh at myself when my jokes are lame
I can fall on my face I'll get up again
I know I'm not perfect
Don't know if I'll ever be
It's perfect for me
We've all been through wars
All our battles leave the scars
And that will remind us not to define who we are

That were locked for me before
And I'm not scared to cry anymore
I like to sing in the rain and be out of key
I can dance by myself I don't need a beat
I know I'm not perfect
Don't know if I'll ever be
I can laugh at myself when my jokes are lame
I can fall on my face I'll get up again
I know I'm not perfect
Don't know if I'll ever be
It's perfect for me
It's perfect for me
I've been at the top of the world
Then fallen off
I like to sing in the rain and be out of key
I can dance by myself I don't need a beat
I know I'm not perfect
Don't know if I'll ever be
I can laugh at myself when my jokes are lame
I can fall on my face I'll get up again
I know I'm not perfect
Don't know if I'll ever be
It's perfect for me
It's perfect for me
