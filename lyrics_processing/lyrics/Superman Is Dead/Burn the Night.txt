The reason I run away
We're gonna burn the night
The reason I sing this song
We're gonna burn the night

Dress to kill, my shoes are slick now
Get on the bike this is the time, yeaa
Speed up the game with no direction, who would understand
Welcome to life that we've been given
We are the criminals of time, yeaa
And with the a dream that won't surrender
Let the fire burn again in the sky
Nana nana nananana...

Sick of the world, the saints are falling
We walked the streets with gasoline
Then we find love in the dark side of life, it's okay my friend
True to your heart
There's nothing stronger than the bullets of your mind
Burn up the night
Burn up the night, Burn up the night

Tonight will be alright coz I've got you
Millions of you and me
Lit up the dream, Lit up the dream
Our tattooed soul will spit the night again
In love and hate we rise

There was a time in this little town
We thought the world's gonna be okay
There was a time that we live with falling stars
There was a time in this little town
We thought the world's gonna be just fine
And now the time is up, tonight!
Tonight!


There was a time in this little town
We thought the world's gonna be just fine
And now the time is up, tonight..

The reason I run away
We're gonna burn the night
The reason I sing this song
We're gonna burn the night
The reason I look like this
We're gonna burn the night
Burn the night
Nana nana nananana...
I say I've got to go another place another to burn
I say I've got to go another place another to burn
I say I've got to go another place another to burn
