I smiled and I said, We just had a girl
He said, Oh, boy, just like me, you're a fortunate one
He said, Girls, they're different, and I ought to know
I've got three myself, but they're all grown
You're in for the ride of your life, just enjoy it, son
There's gonna be first words, gonna be first dates
You'll think she's perfect, but she'll make mistakes
So be there to listen, and be there to talk
And learn to let go when it's her time to walk
And she's on her way, she's on her own
Just yesterday, you were bringing her home
You'll watch her fall down, you'll watch her grow up
She'll meet somebody, and she'll fall in love
Hear what I say, there will come a day
When she's on her way
Holding her hand, you'll feel like a king
It's hard to say no to your little queen
And the sweetest words you'll ever hear are, 'I love you, Dad'
Sometimes, you're gonna wonder if you're getting it right
But as long as you love her, she'll be just fine
Smiles turn to tears, back to smiles at the drop of a hat

The years will go fast, some nights will go slow
Boy, honor her mother, whatever you do
'Cause the worth of a man, she'll take that from you
And she's on her way, she's on her own
Just yesterday, you were bringing her home
You'll watch her fall down, you'll watch her grow up
She'll meet somebody, and she'll fall in love
Hear what I say, there will come a day
When she's on her way
Off to school, down the drive
Ponytail waves goodbye
She's the light and the love of your life
And then there's cars, and there's boys
All made up, no more toys
One day, she's somebody's wife
And she's on her way, she's on her own
Just yesterday, you were bringing her home
You'll watch her fall down, you'll watch her grow up
She'll meet somebody, and she'll fall in love
Hear what I say, there will come a day
