Well a note said: "You've had time to think about it
Looks like to me you're feelin' kinda crowded
You're not looking for anything permanent here
So my Rodeo is packed and it's in 'goodbye gear.' "
So I shot down to the Longhorn Diner
Her sister works there and she'd know where to find her
She said, "You didn't hear this from me
All I'll say is momma's got that place out in Monterrey."
Oh, how fast can I go, I gotta catch that little, red Rodeo
She drove off with my heart, I gotta let her know
Need the girl in that little, red Rodeo
Texas plates, candy-apple red Rodeo
Two towns back I showed your photograph
And the gas-station man just started to laugh
"She said I might see you in this old bucket o' rust
And said 'Good luck boy.' Just follow that cloud o' dust."
Oh, how fast can I go, gotta catch that little, red Rodeo
She drove off with my heart, I gotta let her know
Need the girl in that little, red Rodeo
Texas plates, candy-apple red Rodeo

It took her leaving just to get it through my head
She's the one and only, it's over that's it
I'm commited, I'm in love, and I'm desperate
She's a good ways gone, but I'm closin' the gap
If I have to I'll chase her clear across the map
Oh, how fast can I go, gotta catch that little, red Rodeo
She drove off with my heart, I gotta let her know
Need the girl in that little, red Rodeo
Texas plates, candy-apple red Rodeo
Yeah, how fast can I go, gotta catch that little, red Rodeo
She drove off with my heart, I gotta let her know
Need the girl in that little, red Rodeo
Texas plates, candy-apple red Rodeo
Yeah, now, how fast can I go, gotta catch that little, red Rodeo
She drove off with my heart, I gotta let her know
Need the girl in that little, red Rodeo
