Carlene was the valedictorian
I was the quarter back in the back of classes
She was the whiz kid in horned rim glasses
It's been a long time since I've been around
Since I stepped foot on my old stomping ground
I ended up by the old school yard
When this red head pulled up in a blue sports car
She said, "I bet you don't remember, I guess it's been forever."
It took a second to put it all together and I said
Ooh la la la la la
Looking good Carlene
Woh my my my my my
Times been good to you
If you know what I mean
Girl you glitter like hollywood
Good god carlene
You sure are lookin good
She said hop in let's go for a spin
Tell me whatcha been doing boy and where you been
I said I write songs, you probably didn't know, but I
Finally got a couple out on country radio
She said, "What a switch, ain't life funny, I've got a PHD
Now I'm modeling for money."
Imagine little miss 4.0 just smiling for the camera on the cover of Vogue
I said you've come a long way since graduation
Let me say without hesitation
You've surpassed everyone's expectations

She said another ten years is too long to wait
Pick me up at my Momma's at eight!
And I said
