Looks like you've had one of those God awful days
Like someone dropped some serious rain on your parade, hey, hey
You looked around and you were all alone
You had to face the devil on your own
You know it's okay to cry
You don't have to be so brave, hey, hey
Just breathe deep, lay it all on me

Sometimes you're the king, sometimes you rule
Sometimes you're the joker man or playing the fool
Sometimes you fit in, sometimes you're just out of place
And sometimes you fall, fall all the way down
Sometimes your chute opens before you hit the ground
But you gotta play the game so why play it safe?
Life's about changes
Lemons into lemonade

Well, life is full of bad mistakes
You've got your tough breaks and your heartaches
Yeah, but you'll appreciate the sunny days, hey, hey
With love there's a learning curve
You gotta bend and swerve, you gotta keep your nerve
And above all else for heaven's sake, hey, hey
You gotta laugh
Sometimes that's all you have

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
It's gonna be okay

'Cause sometimes you're the king, sometimes you rule
Sometimes you're the joker man or playing the fool
Sometimes you fit in, sometimes you're just out of place
And sometimes you fall, fall all the way down
Sometimes your chute opens before you hit the ground
