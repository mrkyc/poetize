The kids screaming, phone ringing
Dog barking at the mailman bringing
That stack of bills, overdue
Good morning, baby, how are you?
Got a half hour, a quick shower
Take a drink of milk, but the milk's gone sour
My funny face makes you laugh
Twist the top on and I put it back
There goes the washing machine
Baby, don't kick it, I promise I'll fix it
Long about a million other things

Well, it's okay, it's so nice
It's just another day in paradise
Well, there's no place that I'd rather be
Well, it's two hearts and one dream
I wouldn't trade it for anything
And I ask the Lord every night, ooh
For just another day in paradise

Friday, you're late
I guess we'll never make our dinner date
At the restaurant, you start to cry
Baby, we'll just improvise
Well, plan B looks like
Domino's pizza in the candle light
Then we'll tippy-toe to our room
Make a little love that's overdue
But somebody had a bad dream
Mama and daddy, can me and my teddy
Come in to sleep in between?
