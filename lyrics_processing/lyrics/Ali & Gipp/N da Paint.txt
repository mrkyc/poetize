This a Nitti beat!

When i pull up in the club
Im goin hard in the paint
(im goin) hard in the paint
(we goin) hard in the paint
And when i step up in the mall
Im goin hard in the paint
(im goin) hard in the paint
(we goin) hard in the paint
And when i leave up out the club
They say thats not right
(see they say) thats not right

And when i creep up out the mall
They say thats not right

I bet yo rims ain't higher than mine
(tell em daddy)
I bet yo pockets ain't fatter than mine

I bet yo chick ain't as bad as mine

Krispy kreme in the paint
Chrome on the toes
Snow blows out the AC, 4-5 Doors

Money hungry hustlers
Real-estate investers
Get the fuckin friend
Like he'll never be a customer
Dougy fresh clean
On the scene chokin' Irene
We don't do relationships
We'd rather have a fling
My jeans and my shoes worth
More than a grand
40-thousand in the car
Keep em closer at hand
Watch the stone in my ear
Make the hoes go "Dang!"
And the women love me
Cuz they know who I am

See If u didn't well now u know
Just Cock it back and let it Go
My muscle cars is so strong
