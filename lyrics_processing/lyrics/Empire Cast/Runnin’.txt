Dollars in the bank
Dollars in the bank
(Bank)
We be pulling rank
If you coming for the money
He ain't shootin' blanks
I ain't shootin' blanks
(Blanks)
Fire in my tank
That's what keep me runnin'
Got the money
Ru-ru-runnin'
Imma get my cake
You can never take it from me
My mind runnin'
My mind runnin'
Every Everyday
Like I got these bitches runnin'

Go out for the money
I'm always around
To come and take it from me
I'll lay you down
Handle my business
Stay 100
My level is different
And none of you on it
I ain't playing games with you losers
I'm the type that he can do what he want
Got a shawty who gon ride wit me
I ain't gotta ask
You know she gon' run
Cause I come in fully loaded
When it come to this money no jokin'
Somebody shoulda warned me
That you better take notice
You might also like
Don't ask me how we do it
(I just say it's nuthin')
We don't run with yo lame
(Cause yo lames be frontin')
Hangin' wit Benjamin Franklin
(Cause he keep it 100)
She's my new Bugatti
A million miles and runnin'

Dollars in the bank

Imma get my cake
You can never take it from me
My mind runnin'

Every Everyday
Like I got these bitches runnin'
I ain't never gonna fall off
I see most of ya caught up
Ya'll looking like office
Thirsty need to sip water
That new whip but that spoiler
Whip lookin' like star ship
Blue strip on my dollars
I ain't talking bout ones though
Hundred miles a runnin'
Ya I'm always on it
Ya I ain't talkin' nothin'
I just gettin' keep it a hundred racks on my check
Keep it 100
Mess up the commas
You don't want no drama
Count my money too low
Get that
Don't play with me
Keep pays with me
I ain't talkin' bout them thangs flippin'
What we gonna keep wishing
Stick to whatever gonna pay dig me

Don't ask me how we do it
(I just say it's nuthin')
We don't run with yo lanes
(Cause yo lanes be frontin')
Hangin' wit Benjamin Franklin
(Cause he keep it one hundred)
She's my new Bugatti
A million miles and runnin'
Dollars in the bank
