I wanna reign over my Empire like Caesar
I wanna walk over water and die like Jesus
I want a G5 Learjet, fully loaded, all new features
It's easy to travel the world with a lifetime Visa
T-t-time of the essence
Hot damn it keep me focused
(Keep me focused, keep me focused)
My mind is a weapon
(Is a weapon)
I gotta keep it loaded
(Keep it loaded, keep it loaded)
They all wanna see you
Whenever you make it
They all wanna come when
Your name in the papers
The more that you give 'em
The more that they taking
So you gotta remember
To cover the basics

Power, for the power
Power, all for the power
Power, for the power
Power, all for the power
Power of the empire
For the power
I'll do anything for the power
Of the empire, of the empire
