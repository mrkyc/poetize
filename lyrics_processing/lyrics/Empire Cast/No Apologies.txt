Ahh, uh-huh
Turn down, hell nah
Turn up, hell yeah

My mouth is a weapon
I ain't scared of nothin'
They say he so reckless
Bunkie's in the casket
Better hit the exit, I'll eat you for breakfast
Diamonds on my necklace, guess that's what I'm blessed with
I'm a revolutionary, pardon my vocabulary
I don't even 'member ever carin'
Sue me when I'm in the cemetery
I'm legendary

I do what I want
And say what I want with no apologies (Not uh, not uh, not uh)
Excuse me if I'm blunt
I say what I want with no apologies (Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah)
And they won't shut me up, hell naw, hell naw (Hell naw)
And they won't shut me up, hell naw, hell naw (Hell naw)
I do what I want
And say what I want with no apologies (Yeah, yeah)
You might also like
They get mad, I keep on talkin'
Never mind, I beg your pardon
Guess I'm just too damn outspoken
They can't take me anywhere
Will I ever learn my lesson?
Try hard not to get arrested
Guess I didn't get the message
F it, I don't really care

So much in my head, ohhh (I would let 'em know)
It's so hard not to let go (I'm about the dough)
The closer that you get, they try to hold you back
But a closed mouth don't get fed, no
(And can't nobody stop me, y'all)
I ain't goin' nowhere (Not even for Obama, y'all)
I'm a loose cannon
I'm comin' for yah (Gunnin' for yah)
Hope you're ready (Automatic)
Ready (Ready), aim (Aim), fire, fire, legendary

I do what I want
And say what I want with no apologies (Not uh, not uh, not uh)
Excuse me if I'm blunt
I say what I want with no apologies (Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah)
And they won't shut me up, hell naw, hell naw (Hell naw)
And they won't shut me up, hell naw, hell naw (Hell naw)
I do what I want (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
And say what I want with no apologies
They can't be mad at me, look at my family
I guess it's all in my blood line
If you keep ridin' me for my apology
You'll be waitin' for a long time
Not sympathetic, I said it, I meant it
You don't like it then I could care less
Not sympathetic, I said it, I meant it
You don't like it then I could care less

I ain't sorry, I ain't sorry for nothin' I said
(One hand on the Bible, I ain't in denial)
I ain't sorry, I ain't sorry for nothin' I said
(Your honor, you can blame it on Tiana)
I ain't sorry, I ain't sorry for nothin' I said
(One hand on the Bible, I ain't in denial)
I ain't sorry, I ain't sorry for nothin' I said
