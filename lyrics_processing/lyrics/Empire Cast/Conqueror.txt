Life is like a big merry go round
You're up and then down
Goin' in circles, tryin' to get to where you are
Everybody's been counting you out
But where are they now?
Sittin' in the same ole' place, just faces in the crowd

Well, we all make mistakes
You might fall on your face
But you gotta get up

I'd rather stand tall
Than live on my knees
Cause I am a conqueror
And I won't accept defeat
Try tellin' me no
One thing about me
Is I am a conqueror
I am a conqueror
Oh

Got a vision that no one else sees
Lot of dirty work, roll up your sleeves
Remember there's a war out there, so come prepared to fight
You never know where the road will lead you
Not everyone's gonna believe ya'
And even though they're wrong, don't prove 'em right
