Like the water to the fire
We will find a way to make it alright
No looking in the rear view
The front window shows that our future's bright
Together we stand, divided we fall
Building up the bridge and we're tearing down the wall
So we done been through the worse
Love conquers all even if the truth hurts

If we don't, stand for something then we'll fall for anything
Blood is so much thicker, than water
Like a prince is proud to say he's king
I'm proud to say it's us over everything

No matter what you know, I'm here forever
No matter what, I know you're here forever
We've been through the storm and we're still together
We're back together now as
One
It's you and me over everything
One
It's you and me over everything
You might also like
Leave it all behind, no more wasting time
Too focused the worst's behind us now
Made it through the fight, finally got it right
This is what I've been waiting for, practically my whole life

Yeah, see I always stay down for my bros
Because loyalty is all I know
Down to ride for 'em and I won't lose control
Even when we hit bumps in the road
We get money, on our own
I treat it like baseball, and bring it back home
No King Kong, but we strong
So just like the bank, better leave us alone
Like we car shoppin'
Swear we've been through a whole lot
We swerved around all the road blocks
I put my family over everythin' like hot sauce on the stove top
Don't want me retaliate
Don't mess with nobody related
I roll for my bros, you know for my folks
I'm goin' as hard as the pavement
If they need anythin' then I got 'em
Promise all of their problems, my problems
I can always tell one thing about 'em
They hold me down even when I'm at rock bottom
Through it all, when I fall
They pick me up like a phone call
No pretend, all my kin
We goin' for the win like a long ball
No matter what you know, I'm here forever
No matter what, I know you're here forever
We've been through the storm and we're still together
We're back together now as
One
It's you and me over everything
One
