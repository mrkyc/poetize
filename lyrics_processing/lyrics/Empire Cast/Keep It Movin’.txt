Listen to me, here we go

I got a body like a weapon
It goes ba, ba, bang, bang
And every time that we're together (Sup, baby?)
I drive you insane, insane
Got me up in here, what you gonna do with it?
Now I need a man that can aim lets get it (Yeah)
Get a little trigger happy, baby
Get a little trigger happy, baby

Every time I show her my maneuver
She brag about the way I give it to her
I do it sort of like a ruger
That's true though, that's true though, that's true though
And I don't even got a license
But it don't matter 'cause we keep it private
Every time I usually like it, she gon' light it
She excited, and I'm excited

And I don't got time for love
Don't got time for love (I ain't got no time)
Keep it movin', keep it movin'
Keep it movin', keep it movin
And I don't got time for love
Don't got time for love (I ain't got no time)
Keep it movin', keep it movin', keep it movin', keep it movin
Whoa
Keep it movin', here we go
Keep it movin', here we go, go, go, go, go, go

I got a body like a weapon
It goes ba, ba, bang, bang (Bounce)
And every time that we're together (yeah)
I make you say my name (Bounce)
Got me up in here, what you gon' do with it
Now I need a man that can aim let's get it (Let's get it)
Get a little trigger happy, baby (Hakeem)
Get a little trigger happy, baby

I just wanna hit the bullseye once
You just wanna make me wait around for months
You can go first, I can go second
But I ain't sweatin' for the record
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang
One more time, bang, bang, bang, bang
I keep it in and I hit you like a dog
And I don't got time for love
Don't got time for love (I ain't got no time)
Keep it movin', keep it movin' (Uh-uh)
Keep it movin', keep it movin (Come on)
And I don't got time for love
Don't got time for love (I ain't got no time)
Keep it movin', keep it movin' (Uh-uh)
Keep it movin', keep it movin
Whoa
Keep it movin', here we go
Keep it movin', here we go, go, go, go, go, go
Whoa
Keep it movin', here we go
Keep it movin', here we go, go, go, go, go, go

Got a body like a weapon
It goes ba, ba, bang, bang
And every time that we're together (Yeah)
I make you say my name
Got a body like a weapon
It goes ba, ba, bang, bang
I make you say my name
Got a body like a weapon
It goes ba, ba, bang, bang
And every time that we're together (Yeah)

Got a body like a weapon
It goes ba, ba, bang, bang
And every time that we're together
I make you say my name
