Here we go again, here we go again, fire and  emotion
All up in your face, 'bout to walk away, both our hearts are broken
But the moment you're gone all my colors fade
Them bullets and bombs start to ricochet, oh
I'm defenseless you need me blown away
I was born to love you
And nobody else will do
I would rather die than live without you
And everybody know it too
Don't know why we go to war
But the one thing that's for sure
I was born to love you
I know I'm

Born to love you
Born to love you
Born to love you (yeah yeah yeah yeah)
Born to love you (I was born to love you)
Born to love you
Born to love you (yeah)
Born to love you (born to love you)
