Sometimes you feel insecure
Trust me girl I understand
But even with no manicure
Baby girl I'll hold your hand
You look so good when you walking by
Sexy comes in every size keep wearing that
You ain't playing
You got yourself a new man no need no workout plan
I call that baby fat
But it sure look good to me, see...

You're so beautiful
You got me watching you
Like a camera do
I still wait for you
You got me (In all kind of always)
You're so beautiful
You got me watching you
Like a camera do
I still wait for you
You got me (In all kind of always)

You wear your glasses you can't see
Girl I love your crooked smile
Hair ain't done you're makeup free
You'll never go out of style
Cause you ain't got time to pack
You look too good to be mad
Got way too much class all up inside
Them jeans
You should be happy with a nappy
Hot damn have you seen them thighs
You been all up inside
The cornbread and collard greens
You call me papi
And I like it wild
You might also like
You're so beautiful
You got me watching you
Like a camera do
I still wait for you
You got me (In all kind of always)

This the kind of song make a woman love a man
A woman love a man
A woman love a man now
This the kind of song make a woman love a man
A woman love a man
Adam and Eve and Clan
This the kind of song make a woman love a man
A woman love a man
A woman love a man this this
This the kind of song make a woman love a man
A woman love a man
Adam and Eve and Clan

You're so beautiful
You got me watching you
Like a camera do
I still wait for you
