Look at all the hurt and pain that you caused
You chose to divide the family for the fame at any cost
Be a man and accept that this is all your fault
Yes it is, I know it is
You made the good, turn into bad
Failed us so much that it's hard to call you dad
You're something like the worst nightmare, I've ever had

Tell me how could you be so heartless and selfish
Own up to your responsibility or am I just left to scream?
It hurts like hell that you can't see
That you're a cold cold man
You're a cold cold man
You ain't my family
How could you treat us this way?
You gon' die alone
'Cause you're a cold cold man

He's so so cold
You left the love of your life locked down in a cell
All because you wasn't man enough to say you did it
See I don't understand how you can live with yourself but it's alright though
You might also like
Your judgement's coming, it's long past due
If you live by the sword, you die by it too
You lied on your mother about being alive
Just so your fame and street cred won't die

Tell me how could you be so heartless and selfish
Own up to your responsibility or am I just left to scream?
It hurts like hell that you can't see
That you're a cold cold man

I pray that God has mercy on your soul
I pray that your money still here when you old
I won't reape what you owe
Even if it means that you're the most hated

You're a cold man
You ain't my family
How could you treat us this way?
You gon' die alone, die alone, die alone
