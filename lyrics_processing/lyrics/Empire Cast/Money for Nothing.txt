I want my MTV

Consumers, silver spooners
It's nothin', we get money for it

Commas and zeros, that's the way we do it
We make it work in this economy
Rollin' dinero, pockets stay polluted
Money is dirty and we don't play clean
We chasin' paper, run, run, hurry, move it
Get out the way if you ain't 'bout that green
Intensive labor, taxes are included
Ain't nothin' in this effin' world for free

We got to install microwave ovens
Custom kitchen deliveries
We got to move these refrigerators
We got to move these color TVs

We are the people who turn illegal to legal
We take the good with the evil, create more sales than the Beatles
And the lion's our logo, we the sharks in the water
Multimedia moguls, more offices than the oval
We do everything, pull up in the game to entertain
Finish it by any means necessary
(Finish it by any means necessary)
We everywhere, millionaires, billionaires, visionary
Back to business, let's just spend, think it in and celebrate
