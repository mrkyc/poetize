You can try and take my crown
But I will never let my kingdom down
When I put it on it's on for real
Damn I wear it so well
I know that they're comin' for my throne
But I'm the one who got there on my own
When I put it on it's on for real
Damn I wear it so well

I can still feel your eyes on me like a spotlight
You held me up, up, so high, so tell me was it all lies?
Everything that I've done has got me where I wanna be
So baby why'd you have to leave? Oh, oh

When you got the world in your hands
Seems like everyone wants you to fail
It's like I've got a target on my back
Take a shot at me, take a shot for me

You can try and take my crown
But I will never let my kingdom down
When I put it on it's on for real
Damn I wear it so well
I know that they're comin' for my throne
But I'm the one who got there on my own
When I put it on it's on for real
Damn I wear it so well
You might also like
I can see all their hands reaching out to touch me
Everyone wants a piece just so they judge me
I thought I had your heart, but you let me down
And left me standing all alone
But I'ma still put on a show

When you got the world in your hands
Seems like everyone wants you to fail
It's like I've got a target on my back
Take a shot at me, take a shot for me

You can try and take my crown
But I will never let my kingdom down
When I put it on it's on for real
Damn I wear it so well
I know that they're comin' for my throne
But I'm the one who got there on my own
When I put it on it's on for real
