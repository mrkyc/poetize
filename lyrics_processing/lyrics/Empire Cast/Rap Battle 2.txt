Or back under that rock
With the serpents
Claimin' your a rider 'bout that
Life of movin' workin'
You let the flame go but your
Life is really worthless
I don't give a damn where you came from
You're sweeter than a honey bun
That's why every single person
Don't desert you
Aww, you need a hug
Sorry I gotta hurt you
Get out of line
And butter boy I'll really have to
Merk you
Uh, think it's sweet
I ain't no dessert food
On the same stage you should
Be grateful
You about to get peeled like a
Grape fruit
Can't touch me
Little boy blue, hoo
Aww, look at you boy
You so precious
I think it's time we let 'em know just
Who the best is
If we talkin' money gone
And check it off your checklist
Freda 'bout that action
Watch me shoot right where your
Chest is
I promise I ain't lyin' when I spit it
And whoever writing this here
Just for you
I'm really wit' it
Tell your homie come and get it
It's whatever
I'm that Brownsville bully it's
Nothin' better
This rappin' ain't for you
I ain't lyin' I keep it true
I know a place in France where we
Send Lil' boys like you
Who love to dance and love to
Show off their ass in hammer pants
It's real here
You better check your time
Before you cross the line
Cuz when them hitters line you up
Boy, you can't call your mom
Okay, we all know your mommy
Was a hustler
But you not
You crazy if you think you
Really touchin' her
But this the type of field
That I play on
I put that ass to park with no break on
I blow like napalm
So you should hit the blunt
And keep on smokin' till
Your eyes low
Freda spit that ether
Boy them bars will make 'em die slow
I know you mad
'cause is not you boy
Your brother the man and he put on
A night gown boy
You look like a fan
I'm sorry boy you gotta put the
Check first
I'll make your neck work
Your lady know my best work
This empire all mine
And I ain't got no more time
To stand here with all these lies
Which one is it
You wanna be the queen or a Lyon
Tell cookie get the milk
Cuz the baby keep on crying
This here not my swag
And lucious please give him a towel
His sweat 'bout to make me mad
Yo, it's a rumble in the jungle
All eyes on me
I ain't Floyd
But am on the money team
Imma star nobody else compare
To Hakeem
I'm on Another level you could
Learn something from me
Bars for days
Word play dictionary
Go for blood kill every thing in sight
Carrie, scary I'm just warning up
They done lit a fire that
They can't put out
Imma new flavor
High hater, new paper, life saver
No sucker here
Top ten I belong to the greats
Takin' big, takin' nas
Takin' pac, takin' j
Feel me
The Dalai Lama of Hip Hop
I won't stop
Doing numbers like Warren Buffet
I own stock
Slide through in a ray park it
And board a yacht
Ice drip off the neck
Wrist like moonshine
No shame I'm a ball legend like
John Stockton
Ten, Big Ben is my best friend
Pocket full of blue stripes
Blowin' 'em every thing foreign
Yeah, i'm ownin' it
One time for you
(two times for keem)
Hands in the hair if you repin' dynasty
You know the motto
(full throttle)
Who the man out there
(Hakeem got it)
You want my spot flash
(but you can't buy it)
It's Hakeem pull a bullet to the
Name Lyon
Who run it (Hakeem)

Who put on for the city?
