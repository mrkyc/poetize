From the bottom I got up, to the top of the pro's
From the gutter to the shutter, trimmed out in gold
Life bless my soul, God bless my mold
Nothing less than the best, so the rest is old
Don't wanna play chess, wanna lock and load
Wanna tag some toes, wanna send you home
It ain't about the pain
Tell 'em what's my name

Look
From the bottom I started, so it's nothing that you can say to me
A product of where I grew up, and it's the newest slavery
People see you trying hard, like why you wanna play with me
I bring them heaters out, somebody better pray for me
Cause all I know is this money, I gotta have it
These suicidal thoughts getting bad, I'm getting madder
Uh, they say the good die young, I put the pedal to the medal hit the gas then I'm gone
Now I'm front line at the court, and I'm 'bout to take a shot
I pull it up, cock it back, let it fly
Now I'm watching for the back board
And when they say the world is yours, i just let them know
That I'm just trynna score

Y'all want some, come get some
Y'all want some, come get some
Y'all want some, come get some
Y'all want some

If you ever been through it, then I'm knowing you gotta feel it
You witnessing the struggle from the realest, what the deal is
They trynna lock me down, but they created a monster
I'm beating  down your block, and nobody can't stop us
(You was over there talking all kinds of tough
While you sipping on your little bit of "pick me up"
When you say you like to play a little fistacuff
So when the whistle puffs, I'm gonna call your bluff)
Words from a wise man, never let 'em see you hand
In the end, I bet they all gon' understand
You can't stop what you can't see, standing here is only me
So place your bet and gone prepare for your defeat
(I caught a new jack, it said kid guard ya check
There's a brother over there, that wanna bounce your neck
Ain't you 'fraid of that, watch you fade to black)
