Ahhhh, ahhhh
Ahhhh, ahhhh

If you know like I know say
Ain't about the money, it's about the power (say)
Ain't about the money, it's about the power (you know like I know say)
Ain't about the money, it's about the power (say)
Ain't about the money, it's about the power

Think about it, think about it
Ain't no need to think about it
Get that Money, keep that power
No they not the same thing
Money can be anybody
This somebody, that nobody
When it comes to power
Circle, super small and maintain
Money make em' do it cause of what you give to em'
Power make em' do it cause you told them to do it
Money make you fly, power never die, don't know why
Money can be lost, power never need an alibi
Blood thicker than the champagne
Power in my pride, power in my last name
You might also like
Said if I don't know nothing, I know this paper
Bigger than the world stepping over skyscrappers
If I don't know nothin', one thing I know
Power over money, man that's just how it go

If you know like I know say
Ain't about the money, it's about the power (say)
Ain't about the money, it's about the power (you know like I know say)
Ain't about the money, it's about the power (say)
Ain't about the money, it's about the power

When I'm in your presence you can feel the power
Even if this company was built from powder
Girls, kissin, on the couch, women, in the, shower
Surround, myself with kings, you can keep the cowards
Everytime I reminisce, I'm reppin' different bitches
Blood is thicker than water but BS is the thickest
Let the chain round my neck tell my life story
Born into the money but would die for glory
Get ready for the takeover, that face, lip and makeover
That case, that I break open, that great fifth like Beethoven
If you, wanna get it poppin', I can be in the team
Thirty-four, in a, rocket cause Hakeem's the dream
(Get it? They don't get it)
Oooh, we're makin' moves
You're only doing what my power let you do
You see that money isn't everybody's thing
When it comes to power, can only be one king

Said if I don't know nothing, I know this paper
Bigger than the world stepping over skyscrapers
If I don't know nothin', one thing I know
Power over money, man that's just how it go

If you know like I know say
Ain't about the money, it's about the power (say)
Ain't about the money, it's about the power (you know like I know say)
Ain't about the money, it's about the power (say)
