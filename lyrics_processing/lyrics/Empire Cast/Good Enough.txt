Oh, oh-oh
Oh

I gave you all of me
But it still ain't enough to make you happy
I gave you everything
It still don't measure up
It feels like I walked five thousand miles
And didn't even come close
It feels like I try to make you smile
But you don't even care, no

I'll never be big enough to pay your dues
But I keep trying
And you just keep on making me jump through hoops
What do I gotta do?

I just want you to look at me
And see that I can be worth your love
I just want you to look at me
And see that I can be
Good enough, good enough, good enough
And see that I can be, yeah
Good enough (Good enough), good enough (Good enough)
Good enough (Good enough)
Oh, whoa
You might also like
(Good enough, I can be good enough)
(Good enough, I can be good enough) That I can be
(Good enough, I can be good enough) Good enough
(Good enough, I can be good enough)

I try to show you that I'm strong
Why do I even bother?
'Cause it's the same old damn song
And you call yourself a father, whoa
Feels like I'm reaching for the stars
But Heaven isn't letting me
I wish that I had longer arms
But I know that will never be, never be

I'll never be big enough to pay your dues
But I keep trying
And you just keep on making me jump through hoops
What do I gotta do?

I just want you to look at me
And see that I can be worth your love
I just want you to look at me
And see that I can be
Good enough (Enough), good enough (Enough)
Good enough
And see that I can be, yeah
Good enough (Good enough), good enough (Good enough)
Good enough
(Look at me)
I'm standing right here waiting for you, here I am
(Look at me)
Lookin' for your acceptance, do you give a damn?
(Look at me)
See, it doesn't matter what you think, I'm still a man
(Look at me)
Open up your eyes, can't you see that I'm good enough?
(Whoa, whoa)

I just want you to look at me (Look at me)
I just want you to look at me
And see that I can be
Good enough, good enough, good enough
I just wanna be, yeah
Good enough, good enough, good enough
