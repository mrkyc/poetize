Some people spend most their lives
Looking for someone to lean on
I have held dreams once or twice
Always with no one to dream on
I might just have to find my own line of reason
Oh my, the freedom
'Cause life is a ball of twine
To be rolled out and weaved on

So I just hold on tight, keep hoping things will turn around
I'm so glad now that, finally found a love I can lean on
Finally found the truth to believe on
Finally found this dream I can dream on with you

Now some folks, they'll criticize ya
'Cause every one's got a different height they see from
They sympathize and they'll compromise ya
You look around and you'll come to find your dream's gone
But I want my life designed to be all mine, I need 'em
All times and seasons
And one thing I know for sure
That a gold mine ain't all pure
You might also like
So I just hold on tight, keep hoping things will turn around
I'm so glad now that, finally found a love I can lean on
Finally found the truth to believe on
Finally found this dream I can dream on with you

You see in every person that you meet
There's this little piece of God in them
So I just dream on, I'm not gonna dramatize this
Dream on, 'cause every one's got a different life to lead on
Dream on, I just gotta handle mine and
Dream on, try to find me a better way and ease on
'Cause life is a mound of clay
To be rolled out and then shaped, sometimes things break
But I'm not defined to, so rest of it's on you

So I just hold on tight, keep hoping things will turn around
I'm so glad now that, finally found a love I can lean on
Finally found the truth to believe on
Finally found this dream I can dream on with you
With you, with you
