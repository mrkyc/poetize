It's that new sound
Takeem
What up, baby?

Big shoes, big shoes
My new one got some really big shoes to fill
Made moves, made moves (moves)
I moved on, but I think about you for real
Big shoes, big shoes (big shoes)
My new one got some really big shoes to fill
Made moves, made moves (moves)
I moved on, but I think about you
I still, think about you, for real
Think about you, I still, think about you, for real
Think about you, 'bout you

Been thinking about your body in the worst way
A good god almighty, lord all mercy
That birthday sex like errday
Reminiscing over you like Mary J
I still think about you touching on my body
Still thinking about you, I don't wanna fight it
You're the one that got me thinking 'bout calling
I'm a sexaholic, sexaholic for you

Ah, yeah
I be having dreams, having moments (moment)
All up in your timeline trollin' (I can see that)
Staring at your pics and how you posin' (ow)
I'm frozen, mouth wide open

I feel like I need to feel it again
Til lights out, I'll come kill it again
A milli, a milli, a million
Times in a row, a zallion though
I'm missing you like you're missing me anyhow
Yeah, you missing what I'm missing
Yeah, it's been a while
Youre the one that got me thinking 'bout calling
