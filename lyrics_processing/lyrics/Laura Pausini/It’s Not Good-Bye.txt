And what if I never kiss your lips again?
Or feel the touch of your sweet embrace?
How would I ever go on?
Without you, there's no place to belong
Well, someday love is gonna lead you back to me
But 'til it does, I'll have an empty heart
So I'll just have to believe
Somewhere out there, you're thinking of me

Until the day, I'll let you go
Until we say our next hello, it's not goodbye
'Til I see you again, I'll be right here
Remembering when
And if time is on our side
There will be no tears to cry on down the road
There is one thing I can't deny
It's not goodbye

You'd think I'd be strong enough to make it through
And rise above when the rain falls down
But it's so hard to be strong
When you've been missing somebody so long
It's just a matter of time, I'm sure
But time takes time and I can't hold on
So won't you try as hard as you can
To put my broken heart together again?
