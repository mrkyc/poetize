I don't even know if he still thinks of me
Once he got on board that unforgiving train
I imagine that he whiled away the time
Through the cold gray morning and the city rain
Thinking of somebody else who'll run to him
Who'll ask him did you miss me, maybe now and then?
Laughing he'll say well he met this funny girl
But just a summer thing, he won't see her again

Oh, God, I hope I'm wrong
But I'm not feeling very strong
I've been so up and down so sad
So happy, feeling good and bad
I'm young, I'm old, I laugh, I cry
I tell the truth but that's a lie
I've been so in and out so wild
So well behaved, so pure, defiled
Oh, solitudine
That word I hate to say

And no, I was not crazy to do what we did
I even wish I'd been a bit more crazy still
And kept a little more of him to see me through
He loved me all he could, I never had my fill
And then I'm back inside my room, he knows so well
I feel again the way he moved, I take it slow
I talk to him and he becomes a part of me
And then I know he'll never let the summer go

Oh, God, I hope I'm right
I won't give in without a fight
And I can take the words they throw at me
For none of them could know
That we had something very few
Will ever find their whole life through
I wouldn't change a single day
Although the price I have to pay is solitudine

The loneliness is tearing me apart
It tears me up, it pulls me down and then
It wraps around my heart

Oh, solitudine
Does he remember all he said to me?
I've been so up and down, so sad
So happy, feeling good and bad
I'm young, I'm old, I laugh, I cry
I tell the truth but that's a lie
I've been so in and out, so wild
So well behaved, so pure, defiled
Oh, solitudine
Does he remember all he said to me?
And I can take the words they throw at me
For none of them could know
That we had something very few
Will ever find their whole life through
I wouldn't change a single day
Although the price I have to pay
