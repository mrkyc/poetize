And as crazy as it seems I'm still counting the days
Chasing your silhouette, always so hard to get
Putting my fate into the place that we first met
Thinking it was round midnight
One of those friday nights
When I saw you under those bright red and blue
It was like I just knew I had something to do
I'll be waiting here for you
To meet me under the strobe light
Told the dj not to move 'til you fall in my arms tonight
Let's get it on (let's get it on) until the dawn
We'll be closing down the club to your favorite song
I'll be waiting here for you
To meet me under the strobe light
Thought I had you for a minute
Baby, where are you now?
We were getting deep into it
Now you're lost in the crowd
Calling all of those blinding light (blinding lights)
Move out of sight
What a mistake I have to wait 'til the week goes by
Standing around the floor, blown you right to the core
Girl I want you under those bright red and blue
It was like I just knew I had something to do
You might also likeI'll be waiting here for you
To meet me under the strobe light
Told the dj not to move 'til you fall in my arms tonight
Let's get it on (let's get it on) until the dawn
We'll be closing down the club to your favorite song
I'll be waiting here for you
To meet me under the strobe light
You are my neon color lover (neon color lover)
Someone that I'm yet to discover
Communication lost in extacy
Say that you''l dedicate the night to me
I'll be waiting here for you
To meet me under the strobe light
Told the dj not to move 'til you fall in my arms tonight
Let's get it on (let's get it on) until the dawn
We'll be closing down the club to your favorite song
I'll be waiting here for you
To meet me under the strobe light
See, baby, there's nothing between us
