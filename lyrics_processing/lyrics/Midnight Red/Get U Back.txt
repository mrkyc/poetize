Baby I'll give you space to breathe
Tell me the truth, what did I do to make you leave
They say
You never know what you have, till it's gone
I'm alone, baby I need you back
Stop, stop
Cause I can't let you go
Whatever the cost, I'll pay it all to keep you close
Just stop
All of the walls you built up
Because I'm not ever giving up
Oh, no, no, girl
This time you won't escape
Can't get away from me
Oh, no, no, girl
This time I'm taking back
All that belongs to me
Ohh oh
I'm losing all self control
You're the only one I want
No matter what, I'm not gon' stop
Until I get you back
You might also likeWoah oh

Woah oh
Until I get you back
Ohh oh
No matter what, I'm not gon' stop
Until I get you back
Hold up
I didn't mean to let you fall
Breaking your heart, leaving the scars
I did in awe
This love
Never knew what went missing it
Baby today
Can't you see that I'm different
So now
I'm not gon' take a chance
How would I live, what would I give
To hold your hand
Break down
All of the walls that you built up
Because I'm not ever giving up
Oh, no, no, girl
This time you won't escape
Can't get away from me
Oh, no, no, girl
This time I'm taking back
All that belongs to me
Ohh oh
I'm losing all self control
You're the only one I want
No matter what, I'm not gon' stop
Until I get you back
