And my dream's about to end
You're in the dark, I know where you are
But you're underneath my skin
The way you dance real low, make me follow you slow
The way you hold so tight like you need the light
But when the music stops and you let me drop
Girl it's like nothing that I felt before
You turn me on then you're turning me down
Got me screaming out for more
Where did U go?
Now you can say that you don't want me
Your fingerprints all over my heart
No you can't take it back that easy
So finish up what you start
Where did U go?
You wanna steal my love and leave me
You're wondering where you are in the dark
No you can't take it back that easy
So finish up what you start
Where did U go?
Can't get no sleep, you're stuck in my head
I can still feel how you breathe
You got me caught up in your web
And I don't want to escape
You might also like'Cause when you move real slow makes me wanna know
The way you hold so tight when we dance on the floor
And when the music stops and you let me drop
Girl it's like nothing that I felt before
You turn me on then you're turning me down
Got me screaming out for more
Where did U go?
Now you can say that you don't want me
Your fingerprints all over my heart
No you can't take it back that easy
So finish up what you start
Where did U go?
You wanna steal my love and leave me
You're wondering where you are in the dark
No you can't take it back that easy
So finish up what you start
Where did U go?
I can't stop wanting you
The plot you put me through
You turn me on then you're turning me down
Got me screaming out for more
Where did U go?
Now you can say that you don't want me
Your fingerprints all over my heart
No you can't take it back that easy
So finish up what you start
Where did U go?
You wanna steal my love and leave me
You're wondering where you are in the dark
No you can't take it back that easy
So finish up what you start
