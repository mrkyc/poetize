Hell yeah let's crash a party like we don't care, whoa
Hell yeah let's crash a party like we don't care

We rock the party we got it locked down
Call up all your friends so we can take this down
Trip me, go all out, hit it like a leader!
Tonight we'll kick it like Beckham do
Girl my only goal is to score with you
Then we go all out work it like a leader

And now we are graduating from the school for cool
Play it stupid play it dumb play'em all like fools!

Hell yeah, let's crash a party like we don't care, woah
Hell yeah, said I won't it all right now and it right here, woah
We're gonna make your head spin  around and 'round
We're gonna take you there let's get loud
Hell yeah, let's crash a party like we don't care
This will make your heads spin

It's no illusion the baddest hands down
Like the way you move it, how you bump and grind
Let me take control, work it like a leader
And if you want me tonight, go all out and hit it like a leader
Hit it like a leader

And now we are graduating from the school for cool
Play it stupid play it dumb play'em all like fools!

Hell yeah, let's crash a party like we don't care, woah

Turn out the lights and lose yourself tonight
(Touch somebody's body)
It's alright to lose yourself tonight
(If you want it, want it)
And take your chance and do just what you like

And take your chance, and do just what you like, woah
