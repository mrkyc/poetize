You're killing my resistance, now I have to let go
I'm drowning in your stream girl, I could see heaven's door
I'm running out of fuse, you know I'm 'bout to explode
You're filling up my lungs, I swear I'm ready to blow

Don't leave me lonely
Leave me lonely, leave me lonely
Put it on me, put it on me, put it on me

Don't keep me waiting, this night is fading
Take me home
I try but it's not the same, give me your love again
Take me home
Just wanna be closer as the night gets colder
When the music's over, just take me home
Don't keep me waiting, this night is fading
Take me home

I'm finding myself trippin'
As I'm reaching your shore
Feeling something ripping
But I'm askin' for more
Why you hide ya' love from me
I'm losing control
It's so hard when you're falling
While you're climbing a tour
You might also like
Don't leave me lonely
Leave me lonely, leave me lonely
Put it on me, put it on me, put it on me

Don't keep me waiting, this night is fading
Take me home
I try but it's not the same, give me your love again
Take me home
Just wanna be closer as the night gets colder
When the music's over, just take me home
Don't keep me waiting, this night is fading
Take me home

Your love's so good, how can I forget
Girl your touch is still the best
You could see it all over my chest
Killin' every single piece of me
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Take me home)

Your love's so good
How can I forget
Girl your touch is still the best
You could see it all over my chest
Killing every single piece of me
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Take me home)
Don't keep me waiting, this night is fading
Take me home (Take me home)
I try but it's not the same, give me your love again
Take me home (Take me home)
Just wanna be closer as the night gets colder
When the music's over, just take me home
Don't keep me waiting, this night is fading
