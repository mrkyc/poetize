Baby, when I'm with ya
I can't describe the feeling
All I know is that you're in control of me
Girl, you got something different
Than all the other women
I can't deny that you got a hold on me

(I don't wanna lose you)
Girl, without you I don't (know)
What to do or where to (go)
I just gotta let you know
(I will never hurt you)
You ain't gotta worry (no)
You can let your problems (go)
Just so you know

I'm keeping your love on lockdown! (lockdown!)
Lockdown! (ohh)
I never wanna let you escape
I'm keeping your love on lockdown! (lockdown!)
Lockdown! (ohh)
I never wanna let you escape

I just can't be without you
Whenever I'm around you (I shut down)
No matter where I'm supposed to be
And girl when I'm not with ya (you know that I miss you)
Oh, I'll be there whenever you call on me

(I don't wanna lose you)
Girl, without you I don't (know)
What to do or where to (go)
I just gotta let you know
(I will never hurt you)
You ain't gotta worry (no)
You can let your problems (go)
Just so you know
