She's got a million dollar body
With a smile that makes you want her
I think I want her
And when she step up in a party
Everybody's eyes are on her
She knows they want her
It's like I'm losing control
I just can't help it at all
This never happened before
I swear I never let it go
Yeah I try to deny
But now I finally realize
When I look in her eyes
I'm in trouble
I think she got me
No I can't see tonight
I think she got me (I think she got me)
When I look in her eyes
I think she got me (I think she got me)
I think she got me
I, I think she got me (I think she got me)
I think she got me
I, I think she got me (I think she got me)
