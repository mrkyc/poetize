You drink your coffe slow
I want mine extra hot to take away
I jump on the bus, you prefer to walk, hey that's cool
I'm summing up the things that is separating us two
Could it be so that god always knew?
Giving us all these chances we blew
Making it accidently me and you
Now you're my one in a million
My soul companion and the universe just came through
Who's connecting the dots, what're the odds I found you
You're my one in a million in my opinnion
And there's nothing we can do
You've been searching for me
Like one day I'll be there for you
Now that you're one in a million
You're one in a million
Sunday's on the coach, while I'm working out, that's alright
Cause I'm a gadget boy, you're a pretty girl, not a lie
But you know the way I think whatever makes me tik
I'm your man
Could it be so that god always knew?
Giving us all these chances we blew
Making it accidently me and you
