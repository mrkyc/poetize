This is the love
Something you can feel but you can't define
Can't get enough
And I don't wanna leave what we can't rewind
This is the love
Something you can feel but you can't define
Can't get enough
And I don't wanna leave what we can't rewind

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Baby, baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Baby, baby

I'm so close
You take me far away
I don't know
We'll get to feel this again
Both eyes close
You make my heart awake
I just know that you're one hell of a love
You might also like
Shadows on the  ceiling
Can't ignore it

This is the love
Something you can feel but you can't define
Can't get enough
And I don't wanna leave what we can't rewind
This is the love
Something you can feel but you can't define
Can't get enough
And I don't wanna leave what we can't rewind

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Baby, baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Baby, baby

I don't wanna waste another day
Off my toes, don't think I ever wanna land
I feel you in every single way
I just know that you're one hell of a love
Shadows on the  ceiling
Can't ignore it

Oh when you're holding me
I feel something, and it feels so good
Oh when you're holding me
You give me something no one ever could
Oh when you're holding me
You give me something that it feels so good
Oh when you're holding me
You give me something no one ever could

This is the love
Something you can feel but you can't define
Can't get enough
And I don't wanna leave what we can't rewind
This is the love
Something you can feel but you can't define
Can't get enough
