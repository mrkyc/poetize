Stori
Kiezsa talk to em

Taking me higher than I've ever been before (oh yeah)
I'm holding it back, just want to shout out, give me more
You're just a hideaway
You're just a feeling
You let my heart escape
Beyond the meaning
Not even I can't find a way to stop the storm (nah)
Oh baby, it's out of my control
It's going home
But you're just a chance I take
To keep on dreaming
You're just another day
That keeps me breathing

Baby, I love the way that there's nothing sure
Baby, don't stop me
Hideaway with me some more

Everybody to the dance floor right away
Put your hands up if you need to hideaway

Girl I hate to be the one have to pull your pretty head out the clouds like a sweet taste out yo' mouth
You wanna hideaway with the one who can't be found
You might be gettin' a run around
You don't wanna hear it but I gotta tell ya, you trippin'
Girl I know you better
I don't care how good he put it down
Damage your vertebrate and your headboard make you say (ooh)
The other girl's screamin' (aah)
You can't see it cuz he got you so (high)
Tell me when stop caring bout the (truth)
Now that's brand new
The street's full of bad guys and some nice dudes
It'll turn your heart colder than ice cubes
Check yo'self before you wreck yo'self
And be using yo' cellphone for some extra help, yeah

You send me the shiver and the spine that might overflow
You're bringing me closer to the edge
I'm letting go
You're just a hideaway
You're just a feeling
You let my heart escape
Beyond the meaning
Putting my head into the clouds
I'm floating home
When you can be going I can't find a way to stop
You're just a chance I take
To keep on dreaming
You're just another day that keeps me breathing
