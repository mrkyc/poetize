Said he won't as he moved in close
Said he will if it's what I chose
Put my hand on his naked skin
Held me close and my heart gave in
Made up in the hotel bathroom
Made love in a one star bedroom
Hit the switch on the bedside light
And left that night

Well here I go again now, winding up in pieces
And what can I tell you?
I'm an open exhibition of mistakes and misses
And this is all I've got to show you

This is all I know
Woke up all alone
You left a goodbye note
To explain, my broken heart museum
There we go
My final drop of hope
In a goodbye note
To explain, my broken heart museum
Broken heart museum
You might also like
Retraced back a fake kiss
Cold luck serves an empty wish
Put faith in a perfect stranger
Stepped in to the perfect danger
I rip the sheets, covered in his cologne dew
Left a heart on a foggy window
Say goodbye to a fairytale life
And asked 'why tonight'?

Well here I go again now, winding up in pieces
And what can I tell you?
I'm an open exhibition of mistakes and misses
And this is all I've got to show you

This is all I know
Woke up all alone
You left a goodbye note
To explain, my broken heart museum
There we go
My final drop of hope
In a goodbye note
To explain, my broken heart museum
Broken heart museum
Couldn't hang your pride
Couldn't say goodbye
Couldn't spare the time
Could've fooled me right
As least stayed the night
Could've told me why

This is all I know
Woke up all alone
You left a goodbye note
To explain, my broken heart museum
There we go
My final drop of hope
In a goodbye note
To explain, my broken heart museum
