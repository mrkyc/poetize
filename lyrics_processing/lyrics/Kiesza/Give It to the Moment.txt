Feelings are starting to find you
The more that you see it, the more it rewinds you
And all of you're being that's dragging behind you
Is holding and screaming, I try to remind you

That the reason you're lonely (lonely)
It's cause you listen to everything that you hold in (hold in)
When your out fishing for yourself in the ocean (ocean)
But you don't know that it's the key that you're locked in
Locked in, locked in
Yeee

All I need, is you to bring what you are
And give it to the moment
All I need, is you to bring who you are
And give it to the moment
All I need, is you to bring what you are
And give it to the moment
All I need, is you to bring who you are
And give it to the moment
(Give it to the moment)
(Give it to the moment)
You might also like
Questions you've always been asking
I've giving you answers, but this all makes a clashing
You feel like you're drowning
It's not cause you can't swim, you're just holding your breath in

But the reason you're lonely (lonely)
Is cause you listen to everything that you hold in (hold in)
When you are fishing for yourself in the ocean (ocean)
But you don't know that it's a cage that you're locked in
Locked in, locked in
Uuuuhhhhuuhhh

All I need, is you to bring what you are
And give it to the moment
All I need, is you to bring who you are
And give it to the moment
All I need, is you to bring what you are
And give it to the moment
All I need, is you to bring who you are
And give it to the moment
(Give in to the moment)
(Give in to the moment)
Don't run away if you don't know what to do
Don't be afraid if you're still hiding the truth
Don't try to be someone you still want to
Just find a way to be you

All I need, is you to bring what you are
And give it to the moment
All I need (need, need, need, need, need, need)
Give it to the moment
(Give it to the moment)
All I need, is you to bring what you are
And give it to the moment
All I need, is you to bring who you are
And give it to the moment
Give it to the moment
Give it to the moment
Give it to the moment
