I'm lost, so lost trying to find a way
To you, been so long since you tempted me
So sure, the way that I feel
Oh, it's got to be for real

Suffocating love, I need to escape
I can barely breathe in this empty space
I need you to take me before I fade away

For you I will fall
For you I would lose it all
For you great or small
Dearly beloved, anything that you want
Anything that you want

Dearly beloved, dearly beloved
Dearly beloved, dearly beloved
Dearly beloved, dearly beloved
Dearly beloved, dearly beloved

Been rough
So rough wondering what you want
With me
Been so tough everyday that you're gone
While I fight the way that I feel
Oh it's got to be for real
You might also like
Suffocating love, I need to escape
I can barely breathe in this empty space
I need you to take me before I fade away

For you I will fall
For you I would lose it all
For you great or small
Dearly beloved anything that you want

Anything that you want
I will make it true
Because I'd rather drown in a sea of you
Than to drift away in the empty truth

Dearly beloved, dearly beloved
Dearly beloved, dearly beloved
Dearly beloved, dearly beloved
Dearly beloved, dearly beloved
Dearly beloved, dearly beloved

For you I will fall
(Dearly beloved, dearly beloved)
(Dearly beloved, dearly beloved)
For you I would lose it all
(Dearly beloved, dearly beloved)
(Dearly beloved, dearly beloved)
For you, great or small
(Dearly beloved, dearly beloved)
(Dearly beloved, dearly beloved)
Dearly beloved, anything that you want
(Dearly beloved, dearly beloved)
(Dearly beloved, dearly beloved)
For you
(Dearly beloved, dearly beloved)
(Dearly beloved, dearly beloved)
Anything that you want, for you
(Dearly beloved, dearly beloved)
(Dearly beloved, dearly beloved)
