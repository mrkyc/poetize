Open up my window, let a little wind blow
You catching my drift
Meet me on the side, go deep into my shadows
Grant yourself a wish
Give yourself a break, we're making a mistake
But maybe that's okay for us
Have a little fun, don't worry what we done
Won't matter when we wake up

Then you lie down
Turn the light off, lie down, lie down
Then you lie down
Turn the light off, lie down, lie down

Now we're breaking rules but they ain't breaking us
'Cause it's such sweet love, it's such sweet love, it's such sweet love
Might be cheating fools but there's no cheating us
'Cause it's such sweet love, it's such sweet love, it's such sweet love
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
It's such sweet love, it's such sweet love, it's such sweet love, oh
You might also like
Want me for a moment, meet me all alone
I know that you want this
Baby if it's hopeless, might as well be reckless
Scratch it off your checklist
It won't be enough, pretending it ain't what we want
We'll only want it more
Let it just be us now, have a little trust
Give your body what it's hoping for

Then you lie down
Turn the light off, lie down, lie down
Then you lie down
Turn the light off, lie down, lie down

Now we're breaking rules but they ain't breaking us
'Cause it's such sweet love, it's such sweet love, it's such sweet love
Might be cheating fools but there's no cheating us
'Cause it's such sweet love, it's such sweet love, it's such sweet love
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
It's such sweet love, it's such sweet love, it's such sweet love
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
It's such sweet love, it's such sweet love, it's such sweet love
It's all I want, you're all I want
The only one, and it's begun
It's all you want, I'm all you want
Can't be undone, and this we won

Now we're breaking rules but they ain't breaking us
'Cause it's such sweet love, it's such sweet love, it's such sweet love
Might be cheating fools but there's no cheating us
'Cause it's such sweet love, it's such sweet love, it's such sweet love
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
It's such sweet love, it's such sweet love, it's such sweet love
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
It's such sweet love, it's such sweet love, it's such sweet love
