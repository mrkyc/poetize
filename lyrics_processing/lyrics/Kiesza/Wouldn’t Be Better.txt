Found myself inside a war that I don't wanna leave
Found my way into a battle that I'll never beat
It wouldn't be better without you
It wouldn't be better without you

We get crazy, we get angry, we make fuss
It ain't complicated 'cause we're always makin' love
And I'm cool with all the feels 'cause our sex is so unreal
Fight like animals, but then you crawl up on me, feel your touch

I'm like, ooh, like that
Ooh, you get me hotter than the desert sand
You make my body want it when it feels like that
Mirage all my emotions and I can't hold back
'Cause, ooh, I want it, I want it

Found myself inside a war that I don't wanna leave
Found my way into a battle that I'll never beat
It wouldn't be better without you
It wouldn't be better without you
Found myself inside a war that I don't wanna leave
Found my way into a battle that I'll never beat
It wouldn't be better without you
It wouldn't be better without you
You might also like
Don't want to admit it, but I need your lust
Maybe I'm addicted 'cause I fiend for us
Fingers movin' down my curves, it gives me rush
I go back in time and I start fallin' in love

So touch me, ooh, like that
Ooh, you get me hotter than the desert sand
You make my body want it when it feels like that
Mirage all my emotions and I can't hold back
'Cause, ooh, I love it, I want it

Found myself inside a war that I don't wanna leave
Found my way into a battle that I'll never beat
It wouldn't be better without you
It wouldn't be better without you
Found myself inside a war that I don't wanna leave
Found my way into a battle that I'll never beat
It wouldn't be better without you
It wouldn't be better without you

(Ooh) No, it wouldn't be better
No, it wouldn't be better
Ooh, it wouldn't be better (It wouldn't be better)
'Cause of you, woah
It wouldn't be better
It wouldn't be better
