I feel a presence all around me that I can't control
I feel it entering my body and it's taking hold
I'm resurrection form an emptiness that had me in the cold
I was frozen

Oh, I need you to remember not to ever go
I could be this way forever, oh, that's one thing I know
You're deceiving my emotion
I'm believing again
This should be, this should be
More than a moment

(Sensuum Defectui) you're like a demon, oh
(Sensuum Defectui) the way you possess my soul
(Sensuum Defectui) taking my body whole
(Sensuum Defectui) keep possessing me more
Keep possessing me more
Keep possessing me

I feel unusual desire stirring deep in side
A sprit burning like a fire bringing me back to life
I'm giving in without a question
'Cause there's nowhere to hide
Out in the open
You might also like
Oh, I need you to remember not to ever go
I could be this way forever, oh, that's one thing I know
You're deceiving my emotion
I'm believing again
This should be, this should be
More than a moment

(Sensuum Defectui) you're like a demon, oh
(Sensuum Defectui) the way you possess my soul
(Sensuum Defectui) taking my body whole
(Sensuum Defectui) keep possessing me more
Keep possessing me more
Keep possessing me more
Keep possessing me

Dear Lord, if you can hear me
Save me from this unpenetrable bliss
Spare my body from an endless rapture of euphoria
That has taken hold of my soul
For it has seduced me, tempted me
And lured me into a most perfect darkness
Forgive me Lord
For I love it
Like a demon, oh

(Sensuum Defectui) you're like a demon, oh
(Sensuum Defectui) the way you possess my soul
(Sensuum Defectui) taking my body whole
(Sensuum Defectui) keep possessing me more
(Like a demon) keep possessing me more
(Sensuum Defectui) (Like a demon) Keep possessing me
(Sensuum Defectui) (Like a demon)
