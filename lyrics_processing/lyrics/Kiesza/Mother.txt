Woah to me
I know not what I do
The thorns I carry
Touch softer than the truth
Sing for me
I know not where to go
The road ahead of me
Is but the path I know

Soona we'll be dunna with the troubles of the world
The troubles of the world
With the troubles of the world
Soona we'll be dunna with the troubles of the world
Gone home to meet my mother
Soona we'll be dunna with the troubles of the world
The troubles of the world
With the troubles of the world
Soona we'll be dunna with the troubles of the world
Gone home to meet my mother

I'm gon', I'm gonna meet my mother
I'm gon', I'm gonna meet my mother
I'm gon', I'm gonna meet my mother
Early in the morning
I'm gon', I'm gonna meet my mother
I'm gon', I'm gonna meet my mother
I'm gon', I'm gonna meet my mother
Early in the morning
You might also like
Pray for me
I know not what I've done
And so I carry
The stones of where I'm from
Cry for me
I know not who I am
The future only leads me
Back where I began
La la la la la
The truth will only lead me back to
Where I am

Soona we'll be dunna with the troubles of the world
The troubles of the world
With the troubles of the world
Soona we'll be dunna with the troubles of the world
Gone home to meet my mother

I'm gon', I'm gonna meet my mother
I'm gon', I'm gonna meet my mother
I'm gon', I'm gonna meet my mother
Early in the morning
I'm gon', I'm gonna meet my mother
I'm gon', I'm gonna meet my mother
I'm gon', I'm gonna meet my mother
Early in the morning
From the days I've won
From the road I've come
Soon I will be done
From the endless run
Of the golden sun
Soon I will be done

Soona we'll be dunna with the troubles of the world
The troubles of the world
With the troubles of the world
Soona we'll be dunna with the troubles of the world
Gone home to meet my mother
Soona we'll be dunna with the troubles of the world
The troubles of the world
With the troubles of the world
Soona we'll be dunna with the troubles of the world
