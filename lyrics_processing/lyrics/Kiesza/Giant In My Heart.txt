I'm trying to pretend it isn't true
But even when I want it's like I can't get over you, over you
Over you, over you
Every time I try to tell you why
I turn my face and tears run down my eyes
It's over now, over now
Babe it's over now, over now

So give me all the magic
And give me all the magic that we made
It's like a giant in my heart babe
This love is greater than the heartbreak
So give me back the moments
Just give me back the moments that we made
It's like a giant in my heart babe
This love is greater than the heartbreak, yeah
Giant in my heart babe
Giant in my heart babe
Babe, babe, babe...
Giant in my heart babe
Babe, babe, babe...

What's the point of going through
All the pain of leaving you?
What am I supposed to do?
In my heart there's only you
Baby I can't lose you
Going through
All the pain of leaving you?
What am I supposed to do?
In my heart there's only you
Baby I can't lose you

I'm lying to myself that I'm okay
But when I see your photograph I'm still not over you, over you
Over you, over you
And every time I will your love away
It comes back in a rush reminding me
It's over now, over now
Over now, over now

So give me all the magic
Just give me all the magic that we made
It's like a giant in my heart babe
This love is greater than the heartbreak
So give me back the moments
Just give me back the moments that we made
It's like a giant in my heart babe
This love is greater than the heartbreak
Over you, over you
Hey, hey...
Still not over you, over you
Giant in my heart babe...
Over you, over you
Hey, hey...
Still not over you, over you
Giant in my heart babe...

What's the point of going through

My love, my love, my love, my love
My love, my love, my love, my love
My love, my love, my love, my love
My love, my love, my love, my love
There's no escaping you...

I tried my best, and I'll confess, I'll love with less
I gave the most, and took the loss, from what I chose
I fought for you, you lead me to, a painful truth
