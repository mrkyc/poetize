Trash, won't pick it up, take them lights away
Trash, won't pick it up, don't take your life away
Trash, won't pick it up, don't try to take my knife away

And please don't you ask me if I love you
If you don't know what I'm doing
What you know is

Trash, won't pick it up, take them lights away (Ooh)
Trash, won't get it up, don't throw your love away (Ooh)
Trash, won't pick it up, don't try to take my knife away (Ooh, ooh-oh)

And please don't you ask me if I love you (Ooh-oh)
'Cause I don't why I do
Up my nose

Trash, won't pick it up, take them lights away (Ooh)
Trash, won't pick it up, don't take my knife away (Ooh)
Trash, won't pick it up, forgot to take them all away (Ooh, ooh-oh)

And please don't you ask me if I love you
'Cause I don't know if I do
I want to wipe it out here with you (Ooh)
And take a lover's leap with you
You might also like
I'm going to fairyland with you
I'm going to  with you
But I just don't know if I do
I just don't know if I do
Ah, how you call your lover-boy?

Trash, pick it up, take them lights away (Ooh)
Trash, won't pick it up, won't put that knife away (Ooh)
Trash, pick it up, don't take your life away (Ooh)
