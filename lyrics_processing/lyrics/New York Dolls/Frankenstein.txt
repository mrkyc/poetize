Who coulda spawned all the children this time
Did they ever, could they ever
Expect such a Frankenstein
A Frankenstein
I remember when you were children
You were better than any man
There was never nothing you would ever understand
But you knew who was bent on being master
Making his demented plans
Who's always making his plans
And when those plans they don't fit your style
You get a feeling of your own or two
That's when he starts calling you out
And you just don't know what to do
So now you come around here
And you're trying to take over the town
Just because of back home, baby
How they put you down
Oh baby, how they put you down
I know they put you down
So now, you're storming 'round here
With a list of your demands
In a place where they don't expect nothing
You're trying not to dirty your hands
Well, I'm asking you as a person
Is it a crime, is it a crime
For you to fall in love with Frankenstein
You might also likeIs it wrong, could it be wrong?
Wrong? baby, don't you want a friend?
'Cause you're trying to be so selective
You'll never realize the whole time
Who's the one you're loving
Misunderstood like a Frankenstein
And that left them just a bit disturbed
Like Frankenstein, like Frankenstein
So now you're telling me
Well any time, you can get on home
Well, don't you know this place, it is my home
So where am I gonna go
You know, when you don't expect nothing
No, you're not alone, you know you're not alone
Well, something musta have happened over Manhattan
Who coulda spawned all the children this time
Did they ever, could they ever
Expect such a Frankenstein, a Frankenstein, Frankenstein
Now whose shoes are too big?
Now whose jacket's too small?
Oh I'll show you more Frankenstein
Frankensteins of us all
Well, asking you as a person
Is it a crime, is it a crime
For you to fall in love in with Frankenstein
Is it Wrong, could it be wrong
Wrong? Baby, don't you want a friend?
Well, Frankenstein
Oh, Frankenstein, Frankenstein
Frankenstein
You're gonna get it, you're gonna get it
You're gonna get it when Frankenstein gets home
You're gonna get it, you're gonna get it
You're gonna get it when Frankenstein gets home
I'm gonna shout about, I'm gonna scream about it
I'm gonna shout about it, bitch about it, scream about it, cry about it
Frankenstein

I gotta ask you one question
