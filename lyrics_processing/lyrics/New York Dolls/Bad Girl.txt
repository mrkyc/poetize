A new bad girl, moved in on my block
I gave her my keys, I said don't bother to knock
I said, come on, you got what I need
I said, come on, don't make my heart bleed
I'm begging
Woah, bad girl
Whatcha tryin' to do
What is the matter with you
Bad girl, what are you tryin' to do
'Cause from early in the morning, until late at night
You're tryin to tell me everything is alright
Then you're gonna ask am I gonna take it slow
I said, don't you worry, there's no place I gotta go
My bad girl
I'm walkin' to the corner, to the mornin' cafe
That's when I seen her, walkin' my way
And all dolled up in her waitress' skirt
I said, come on, don't make my heart hurt
I beggin
Woah, bad girl
Whatcha tryin' to do
What is the matter with you
Bad girl, what are you tryin' to do
