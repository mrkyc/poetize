But she does things that make your eyebrows curl
You let her loose for a Friday night
You know it's gonna end in a fight
Rosetta drinks her whisky neat
She gets in a fight and she might get beat
So I go round on the Saturday night
And ask her if she feels alright
Rosetta are you better?
Are you well, well, well?
Rosetta are you better?
Are you well, well, well?
Well, well, well
Well, well, well
Well, well, well
When Friday comes she's fine again
So we go to a club where we got friends
Knocked on the door but we couldn't get in
'Cause the boss don't want no fuss
So we went up town and we drank around
And Rosie ended on the ground
I took her home and I put her to bed
And you can guess what I said
You might also likeRosetta are you better?
Are you well, well, well?
Rosetta are you better?
Are you well, well, well?
Well, well, well
Well, well, well
Well, well, well
Rosetta are you better?
Are you well, well, well?
Rosetta are you better?
Are you well, well, well?
Well, well, well
Well, well, well
Well, well, well
Well, my little girl is a sweet little girl
But she does things, makes your eyebrows curl
You let her loose on a Friday night
You know it's gonna end in a fight
Rosetta are you better?
Are you well, well, well?
Rosetta are you better?
Are you well, well, well?
Well, well, well
Well, well, well
Well, well, well
Well, well, well
Well, well, well
Well, well, well (You know it's alright)
Well, well, well (Do you hear what I say?)
Well, well, well (Take it easy, baby)
Well, well, well
Well, well, well
Well, well, well
