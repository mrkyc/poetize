I call my baby, and ask her what shall we do
I mention movies, but she don't seem to dig that
And then she ask me, why don't I come to her flat
And have some supper and let the evening pass by
By playing records, beside a groovy hi-fi
I say yeah yeah that's what I say, I say yeah yeah
My baby loves me, she gets me feeling so fine
And when she loves me, she let's me know that she's mine
And when she kisses, I feel the fire get hot
Se never misses, she gives me all that she's got
And when she ask me, if everything is OK
I've got my answer, the only thing I can say, I say Yeah yeah
That's what I say, I say yeah yeah
We'll play a melody and turn the lights down low
So that no-one can see
We gotta do that, we gotta do that
We gotta do that, we gotta do that
And there'll be no one else alive in all the world 'cept you and me
Yea, yea, yea, yea, yea
Yea, yea, yea, yea
Pretty baby I never knew such a thrill
Just thought I'd tell you, because I'm trembling still
But pretty baby, I want you all for my own
I think I'm ready to leave those others alone
No need to ask me if everything is OK
I got my answer, the only thing I can say
I say yeah yeah, that's what I say, I say yeah yeah
That's what I say, yeah yeah
