This isn't maybe, this is always
Believe me this time it's love
Baby this is love
That means the real beginning of forever and evermore
This isn't just, mid-summer madness
No passing glow not a moment's gladness
Darling can't you see this is love
Oh please baby can't you see it's really love
And I knew it on that night when we met
You tied a string and wrapped it, round my heart
Darling tell me just how, can I forget you
My dear, each time we kiss I know that this is
Ow wanna scream that this is all
Ow wanna scream that this is all
Ow wanna scream that this is always
I fell in love with you
The moment that I looked at you
I knew no one else would do, only you, for always
Yours until the end of time, please be mine
I fell in love with you the moment that I saw you
You were passin' me by when you caught my eye
You were sent to me from heaven above
So very lovely, just standing there, wind in your hair
You might also likeI have never seen a dream go walking
Like the way you did that day stole my heart away
Please keep it dear 'till your old and grey
     
This this this, this is love
I know that this is love
Oh yes I knew it on the
Knew it all on, knew it on the night we met
And I never will forget
You tied a string around my heart
Darling tell me, how could I
How can I forget I met you
How can I, tell me ooh, my baby won't you tell me
Why must when ere we kiss
I feel this urge I can't resist
And I've got to tell the world that this
