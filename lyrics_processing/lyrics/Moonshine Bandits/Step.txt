Step to the bar for some Outlaw moonshine
Raise a glass and tip it back
Go and get ready for a mm-hmm good time
Get your grove on sing along with the band
Step on the floor baby shake it like it's midnight
Let it get a little out of hand
Go and get ready for an ooh-oo good time
Get your grove on sing along with the band

Thank God that this Friday finally came
I've been workin' all week goin' insane
Got my buddies comin' by to pick me up and we're gone (We're gone, we're gone)
To the honky tonk out on the edge of town
Where the outlaws stump and the girls get loud
When the sun goes down the shots pour out and we're gone (We're gone, we're gone)

Step to the bar for some Outlaw moonshine
Raise a glass and tip it back
Go and get ready for a mm-hmm good time
Get your grove on sing along with the band
Step on the floor baby shake it like it's midnight
Let it get a little out of hand
Go and get ready for an ooh-oo good time
Get your grove on sing along with the band

We'll be steppin' sideways by the end of the night
Got 10 on the touch tunes groovin' in her boots
She'll go right into the slide then she'll get a little loose
So I stepped right to her for that Outlaw shine
Then she flicked a cigarette and said "give me a ride"
Said "I'm parked outside in that four wheel drive
But you're gonna need a step stool to step inside"
