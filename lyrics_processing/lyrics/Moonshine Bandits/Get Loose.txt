We're gettin' diesel powered on this one for all you diesel pushers
Out there rockin' the Duramax, Cummins, or the Power Stroke
Love to sing your song

They don't wanna see us loose
They don't wanna see us loose
They don't wanna see us loose
They don't wanna see us loose
They don't wanna see us loose
They don't wanna see us loose

10 on the lift, big ball hitch
Mud flaps on the back so the sheriff won't bitch
Horns on the hood, 33's rub
More girls in the limo than they do in the club
I put Cali on the map like Mariah did
Like Nick and 80's is to a Niner's kid
Didn't need a pair of pliers to uncap this lid
We put the valley on the map before Mapquest did
Jonny Cash was alive and he's ridin' with the shine
Truck full of crackers and a box full of wine
10 years on the grind, Kevin Zinger on the line
Get my momma on the phone, tell her I'ma 'bout to sign
I did it, I lived it, I get it, I'm raw
I spit it, I flip it, I give it my all
Built it from the ground up and did it with y'all
Hope I don't lose it and let it loose on your jaw

Get loose! Get loose! Get loose with it
Get loose! Get loose! Get loose with it
Get loose! Get loose! Get loose with it
Get loose! Get loose! Yeah loose
They don't wanna see us loose
They don't wanna see us loose, nah nah
Get loose! Get loose! Get loose with it
Get loose! Get loose! Get loose with it
Get loose! Get loose! Get loose with it

Hell the shiner kids are comin' out of the woodwork
So loadin' up on high fives and flippin' the bird
And drinkin' whiskey 'til it's all silly, speech is slurred
And then get up and doin' shows and singin' every single word
See the cataract sung 'cause the way I recollect it
Read the Moonshine Bandits were the first to country rap
Now we cash country checks from the this country Cali rap
And I ain't satisfied 'til I got a country jet
To form a country ass around this country and raise hell
It took us 10 years and now were loose in this jail cell
The shiner's rage gonna help me raise hell
By the end of the night they're throwin' all of us in jail
I'm a blue collared sun 'cause the style is automatic
On my midnight run got me drivin' all erratic
And the coppers might cuff me 'cause I be causin' static
By the end of the night I blow the roof up off the attic

Get loose! Get loose! Get loose with it
Get loose! Get loose! Get loose with it
Get loose! Get loose! Get loose with it
Get loose! Get loose! Yeah loose
They don't wanna see us loose
They don't wanna see us loose, nah nah
Get loose! Get loose! Get loose with it
Get loose! Get loose! Get loose with it
Get loose! Get loose! Get loose with it
Well, I went out last night
Got fucked up and oh my God that's right
'Cause we signed on the line and it's about that time
For the nation to get up and get ready to shine (Uh)
This is my family I been shinin' so hard I can barely breathe
And I had a couple biscuits along the way
To try to settle me down, but I can never be down, uh
Uh, yeah, I don't get stuck in the rear view
I keep my eyes open keep my mind in the clear view
Uh, and I can see this is real fool
Been down for day one it's about to get real loose
You say we did it underground but we're country
'Cause we took you to the backwoods just to get funky
With the 4x4's, automatic, no stick
Super Swamper tires, six inch lift kit

Get loose! Get loose! Get loose with it
Get loose! Get loose! Get loose with it
Get loose! Get loose! Get loose with it
Get loose! Get loose! Yeah loose
They don't wanna see us loose
They don't wanna see us loose, nah nah
Get loose! Get loose! Get loose with it
Get loose! Get loose! Get loose with it
