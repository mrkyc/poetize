I'm out late (out late) gettin' drunk (Gettin' drunk)
Crackin' a couple of beers (Beers)
She walks in lookin' finer than sin
I swear to God the whole bar stood still
She had them cowboy boots (Cowboy boots) them daisy dukes (Daisy dukes)
A rebel Dixie smile (Dixie smile)
The kind of girl your mama warned you about
With country swagger, make a grown man cry (Grown man cry)
She want that bad boy with the tats all black
With the piece on the way send a patch and match girl
Wanna be my lady love
Huh, wanna see what the world could be
With the rebel on the run, livin' wild and free
Then get your Dixie ass in this truck

Kick off them cowboy boots (Cowboy boots) them daisy dukes (Daisy dukes)
And see your Dixie smile (Smile)
Girl I'm the boy your daddy warned you about
But you know it's just drivin' me wild
So just for gettin' time (Gettin' time)
Break out the shine (Break out the shine)
Let's fall in love
If this is livin' in a country dream
Baby girl I ain't wakin' up
Eyy, eyy

Turbo diesel, kick the dust up
On the back roads 'til the cops come bust us
Tailgate down once I back the truck up
Tell your pops he's not to trust us
He's so worried, get her home early
I'm ridin' dirty with a fifth of gin
Long blonde hair whippin' in he wind
High on life but we livin' in sin
She's the kind of girl that'll blow your mind
The kind of girl that'll ride shotgun all night (That's right)
A dive bar legend (Come on), my tattood queen
She love that Kid Rock, Johnny Cash and Bruce Springsteen (Come on)

Kick off them cowboy boots (Cowboy boots) them daisy dukes (Daisy dukes)
And see your Dixie smile (Smile)
Girl I'm the boy your daddy warned you about
But you know it's just drivin' me wild
So just for gettin' time (Gettin' time)
Break out the shine (Break out the shine)
Let's fall in love
If this is livin' in a country dream
Baby girl I ain't wakin' up
Eyy, eyy
Crank it up lady luck, you're still a little girl that your mama loves
I'm bad news, my tattoos, I'm everything she said I was
Eighteen pack full of Natty Light, one hot night, one long drive
Ride with the devil, can't tame this rebel, 'cause mama tried, mama tried
She's the kind of girl that'll blow your mind
The kind of girl that'll ride shotgun all night (That's right)
A dive bar legend (Come on), my tattood queen
She love that Kid Rock, Johnny Cash and Bruce Springsteen (Come on)

Kick off them cowboy boots (Cowboy boots) them daisy dukes (Daisy dukes)
And see your Dixie smile (Smile)
