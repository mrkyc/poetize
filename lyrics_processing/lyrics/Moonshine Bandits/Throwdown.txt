Yeah we 'bout to get muddy on this one
Moonshine Bandits and The Lacs
California to Georgia
What you know about that
And every mud hole in between
What you know about that
Let's roll

About to have a little redneck throwdown
Mud trucks with them big ass tires
So kick back if you never did know how
Them hick boys throwin' down tonight

Jump up in the Chevy, rev it up let's ride
Keep the red, white, and blue flyin' high in the sky
Double barrel in the back by my jar of apple pie
Pourin' whiskey out my glass for every soldier that's died
Oh got a Chevy full of girls gettin' muddy, gettin' gritty
They rolling with The Lac's and the Shine
Got a bonfire lit ridin' 51/50
Let's get a little rowdy tonight, oh yeah
Rev it up, drop it down, tear it up get loud
Super Duties full of mud got my farm boys proud
And my boys in the hills that don't go into the city
I got a bed liner full of kegs come and drink with me

Jager on deck with the Jack Daniels wavin'
So take a swig of the good shine and fire it up
Ass end tucked down watch out for flyin' mud
All them country girls they like to ride up in the sky
Got some lightnin' in the Mason that'll make 'em all try
I'd take it, jack it up, and paint it Bulldog red
I make them ladies back it up when I holler, hell yeah
Just get it get it go with it drink and get it started

Oh ride with me
Born to raise hell anywhere we go

Man what's up buckwheat
Grab that man's chest bro
We give them a high line
Don't forget them beers
We gon' party, woo
Blue flame's still burning from my outlaw shine
Cali girls don't dance to the 6x9
Tail gates still shakin' from the 15's hittin'
And the mud's still wet and the pipe's still drippin'
Oh ride with me
Chewin' through the mud when the river is low
Oh ride with me
Born to raise hell anywhere we go
I didn't choose country, country chose me
