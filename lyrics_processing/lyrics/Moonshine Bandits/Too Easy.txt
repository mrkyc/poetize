Rockin' ten thousand volts
Killin' that Jack and Coke
Rollin' that backwoods smoke
I make livin' hard, look too easy
Work hard and stand my ground
Speak my mind and I say it loud
I get up when I get knocked down
Best believe me, (Come on, come on) it's too easy (Yeah)

Fire up your Harley let your ape hangers hang
Mix a little bit of spit with a little bit of twang
Smash a rebel in a Chevy got somethin' to bang (Come on)
Hit the critics in the face where the truck nuts swing
I worked hard like a farm boy, built what I got
Earned every single shot with every stage that I rocked (Come on)
I keep the suitcase packed with a bottle of Jack
I never unload my clothes 'cause I know I'm goin' back
Gave the valley CPR brought 'em back to life (Woo)
Said goodbye to my family, gave a kiss to my wife (Yeah)
For me it's hard to swallow how I even survive
I put the bottle by the bottle prolly die for this life
Oh I've been runnin' off shine of that devils road (Yeah)
Put a finger in the air 'til I started over
By the grace of God I'm alive and standin' proud (Lets go come on)
I've been stabbed in the heart from a wicked women
But my wounds heal quick and then I hit the road
And any town I lay my head now I call home (Come on)
It's way too easy

I tell the doubters go to hell I can lock 'em and load
I'm on the Billboard charts while your hopin' to blow
I'm drinkin' firewater shots on a copperhead road
I got a family full of shiners all across the globe
Now I'm roamin' through the jungle I'm a bad moon riser
I'm in a travelin' band that just keeps shinin'
I been livin' too fast Cali boy survivin'
Make a livin' off drinkin', make a livin' off rhymin'
Every record exec that kept tellin' me no
I got that middle swingin' hangin' out my window
So grab your genre and you can label me this
Tatted up hell raiser slash outlaw fish
Oh from the big city lights to the country side
I get fired up from my fans every night
And they fuel the drive that burns deep inside my soul (Inside my soul, come on)
It's way too easy I guess is what they say
This load that I'm on and my life ain't a game
And the fortune and fame and the memories of pain won't break me (Come on)
