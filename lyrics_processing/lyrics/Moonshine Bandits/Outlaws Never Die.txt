Have a smoke, have a beer
Keep the whiskey pourin' here
And when I leave please don't say goodbye (Don't say goodbye)
Yeah, they're always goin' to remember me
'Cause outlaws never die, never die

Some hole in the wall is always playin' some Coe
'Cause TV was too scared and so was the radio
We did it for our brothers that have came and gone
But we can't say goodbye 'cause their legacy lives on
The highways are long so the memories fade
White lines wash away when the skies are gray
From dive bar salons to the hotel rooms
Gone April to June but I'll be home soon
It's been three months straight with no time for breaks
Been livin' off whiskey and Steak 'N Shake
And these bus bunks are small, plane rides are bumpy
But the bourbon in my glass still keeps me company
And this paper and pen's been my damn best friend
So we remember these times and relive them again
All the hell we raised, all the stories we trade
So outlaws don't die on judgement day

Have a smoke, have a beer
Keep the whiskey pourin' here
And when I leave please don't say goodbye
Yeah, they're always goin' to remember me
'Cause outlaws never die, never die
You might also like
Yeah, they said that I'd be haunted with regrets
Livin' on the highway
And those words I never-ever could forget
When I grabbed ahold of my reins
And now they sing the songs we wrote across the lands
Now we've broken all of their shame
And when they lay me down I know that I'll live on
Like the legends gone before me (Gone before me)

Have a smoke, have a beer
Keep the whiskey pourin' here
And when I leave please don't say goodbye
Yeah, they're always goin' to remember me
'Cause outlaws never die, never die

Another round for that broken road
It fixes all the holes in this outlaw's broken soul
I find my way to where the hopeless go
To raise a glass to the ones who said hell yeah when they told us no
We never buckled under pressure fool
Just pressin' hard to turn the heat up never catch a cold
And towed a heavy load, never heard me bitch about it
Just talk about the past, and laugh, and reminisce about it
Singin' 'bout the sorrows with a hope of a tomorrow
How I never gave back all the love she let me borrow
Heartaches of a honky tonk followed by a yee-yee
Let the song play it could be the last time that you see me
Have a smoke, have a beer
Keep the whiskey pourin' here
And when I leave please don't say goodbye (Don't say goodbye)
Yeah, they're always goin' to remember me
'Cause outlaws never die, never die (Outlaws never die)
(Keep the whiskey pourin' even when I leave
Please don't say goodbye
Yeah, they're always goin' to remember me
