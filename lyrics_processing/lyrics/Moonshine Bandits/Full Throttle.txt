Jacked up off my apple pie (That's right)
I've seen my tires light up like the Fourth of July
I'm off to John Deere Green man I'm so high (High)
Hit the back road flyin' in a jacked up four by (Yeah)
Tailgate shakin', truck nut swingin'
Blacked out window with the Fosgate bangin'
Pass me the lightnin', I'm drinkin' 'til sunshine
Bootleggin' booze runnin' all through my bloodlines
Roadkill Cali, smash through the valley (Come on)
Jacked up dive bar, Mustang Sally
Playin' out the jukebox, girls all around me (That's right)
I'm living like an outlaw, you've probably heard about me
Back it on up like a Tonka truck (Yeah)
Baby got a body make a honkey stuck (What)
Tank top trucker hat and all tatted up
She got the whole damn bar all jacked up (Yeah)

Ridin' down a country road, singin' along to David Allan Coe
(Slingin' mud) Slingin' mud high in the sky, there ain't no place that we can't ride
Full throttle, wide open, runnin' off shine, the swamper's smokin'
This is how we live and this is how we ride
Bottles in the back of my four wheel drive

There's lightnin' in my Mason and thunder in my pipes
That sunset I've been chasin' yeah I was born to ride
I'm addicted to them highways yeah I love the country roads
I'm addicted to doin' things my way got whiskey in my soul

Got the keg on tap, let the jack full of shine
Got the music jacked up, it's about that time
Buzzin', muddin', livin' full throttle
Grippin' on the wheel while I'm sippin' on the bottle
Got the crumb real dirty like the girls I meet
When it comes to raisin' hell, you're referrin' to me
Backroad renegade, ditch the highway
Straight out the gate I always did things my way
