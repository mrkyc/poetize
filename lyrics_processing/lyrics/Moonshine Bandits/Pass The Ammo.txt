There's a storm on the horizon and
My adrenaline's running wild
But I got my brothers standin' next to me
So praise the Lord and pass the ammo
Stars, stripes, and camo
There's a price to be paid
To stay free

Pass me the ammo ain't afraid to fight
Pass me the ammo ain't afraid to cry
Pass me the ammo ain't afraid to die
I do it for my family and do it for my pride
Pass me the ammo ain't afraid to fight
Pass me the ammo ain't afraid to cry
Pass me the ammo ain't afraid to die
I do it for my family and do it for my pride

Laid up in this bunker, rosary on my neck
I do this for my family and the colors I respect
Ain't forgotten that those cowards took the towers down
You can bet I ain't gon' hesitate to put 'em in the ground
Clutchin' on my rifle, ammo by my side
Clutchin' on my Bible, I do it for my pride
I'm trained to be fearless, I fear the unknown
Give my love to my family and I'll see 'em when I'm home

Proud of my county, it's the land of the free
Your enemy's my enemy, together we bleed
Your sister, your brother, your cousin whatever
Your families, my family in the trenches together
Pistol by my side with my rosary beads
Bible by my ammo, man I hope He is watchin' me
Overseas overnight if I die I know it's right
Freedom ain't free, pass the ammo, let's ride

And to the Republic for which it stands
One Nation under God, indivisible
