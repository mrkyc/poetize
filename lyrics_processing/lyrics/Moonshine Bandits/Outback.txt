Everything we do, we do it outback
Backyard half-charred ribs on a rack
Back-road runnin' gettin' dirty on a track
Back woods gunnin' hittin' birdies by the pack
Everywhere we go, we go to the back
Backyard bars serving jars full of batch
Back under the moon with the tailgate back
In back of the saloon where the jukebox at

Outback where the forest is thick
There's a circle in the middle of a field, where a bonfire's lit
Cup full of shine, Copenhagen in my lip
Now I'm dippin' sideways probably wake up in a ditch
So, crank that music into the night
And crack that beer and raise it high
Stacked little blonde want a midnight ride
Take her back to the country for a real good time

Everything we do, we do it outback
Backyard half-charred ribs on a rack
Back-road runnin' gettin' dirty on a track
Back woods gunnin' hittin' birdies by the pack
Everywhere we go, we go to the back
Backyard bars serving jars full of batch
Back under the moon with the tailgate back
In back of the saloon where the jukebox at

Got me steppin' in manure every time I spit shit
Feel like Cash in the photo with the bird gettin' flipped
Came from the bottom, so they labeled me a catfish
Worldwide better grab you an Atlas
Bonfire lit like Willy, let's smoke
Rack full ribs and a smoker full of oak
Blackberry Brandy, out back in the duck blind
Black Lab runnin', got huntin' in his bloodlines
Came from outback, but I'm back in the lead
Back like a rack full of fat double Ds
Back with a barrel on a rack let me squeeze
Back on the trigger, hit 'er right between the knees
Back with the tow strap I pull 'em real heavy
Ladies gettin' dirty outback on the Chevy
Dive-bar beauty queen, Bubba call 'em 'Betties'
Pedal to the metal, baby girl, I'm ready

Backyard half-charred ribs on a rack
Back-road runnin' gettin' dirty on a track
Back woods gunnin' hittin' birdies by the pack
Everywhere we go, we go to the back
Backyard bars serving jars full of batch
Back under the moon with the tailgate back
In back of the saloon where the jukebox at
Talkin' 'bout a burn pile, hound dog, me and my honey
We can run a game of shoes, we can lose a little money
Might talk a little smack, after sippin' that Jack
Bunch of jacked up trucks all parked 'round back
Yeah get loose, like they do it up in Cali
Ol' shine so smooth, like you cruisin' in a Caddy
Then we rolled ourself a fatty, went around to the shed
I had to back up off it, it was buzzin' my head

See I'm back in the Mac, I'm in the back with The Lacs
Get on these backs to the Sacs
Know how I'm hackler's act
See I'm partyin' to death, with Bacardi on my breath
I'm thinking naughty to myself about the shawty on my left
Yeah, we're still outback
It's the country outcasts
Thinkin' you can out-rap?
Yeah, bitch, I doubt that
Meet us all out back
And we'll whoop that loud ass
'Cause were bringin' country back, quicker than a snap-back

Everything we do, we do it outback
Backyard half-charred ribs on a rack
Back-road runnin' gettin' dirty on a track
Back woods gunnin' hittin' birdies by the pack
