Let every nation know, whether it wishes us well or ill
That we shall pay any price, bear any burden
Meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe
To assure the survival and the success of liberty

Straight from the valley, sweatin' from the sun
Ain't no Hollywood bullshit where I'm from
Known to raise hell, that's just how we get down
If you ain't proud of where you're from get the hell outta town
Raised on country, (Country) raised on Cash (Cash)
Raise Old Glory or I'll kick your ass (Kick your ass)
My heart starts pumpin' when the flag gets raised
Get the hat off your head or I'ma slap your face (Slap your face)
Home of the brave, (Brave) land of the free (Free)
Respect them soldiers and the shit they see (Shit they see)
I'm American made 'til I hit the grave
You gon' love me, you gon' hate me but it's how I'm raised

And so, my fellow Americans
Ask not what your country can do for you
Ask what you can do for your country

Raised up, finger above me
Some gonna hate me, some gonna love me
Raised up, finger above me
End of the day only God can judge me
Raised up, finger above me
Some gonna hate me, some gonna love me
Raised up, finger above me
End of the day only God can judge me

Bust ass all year how they do it down here
Raise your gun up quick if you're dumpin' a deer
Raise your rack on the mantle, raise your Bud Light beer
Raise your lid from the smoker if you slaughter or steer
Raise a limit for the Rainbows and German Browns
I was runnin' trout lines since grandma was around
Raised on country, (Country) raised on rock (Rock)
You could hear my speaker not but you still all stop (Still all stop)
Raise up with the tin on the lift bro (Lift bro)
Hit the turbo just to hear the whistle blow (Whistle blow)
Raise up the bass so my stereo blast
All the leaves off the trees when you hear me pass (Come on)

Raised up, clap, (Clap) clap (Clap)
Now let it breathe (Breathe)
Now they told me I could never make it on my own
They didn't know I was raised up by Mr. and Mrs. Jones
Terrorizin' mediocre mofo's tearin' through so many below
Average Joe's, come on you've seen the shows
I'm raisin' all kinds of hell if I do say so myself
I'd say I'm doin' it well
Raised in the sticks layin' rocks and bricks
Raised up to work for what you get and never bitch
And pick a switch when you raise your voice
And never quit once you make your choice
Just put your head down and keep gettin' it
'Til you got what you came here for
Then they can't say shit, uh
