This one right here is for small town America
We're still alive, we're still strong
Two bar towns
Lemme take you all on a ride
Roll down your windows

Rollin' down a two lane road (Two lane road)
Turn the radio on (Turn the radio on)
Arm hangin' low out the window, Tom Petty on
I feel right at home (Right at home)
And I'm so damn proud (Hell yeah)
Hell yeah I love this two bar town

Flags flappin' in the wind four by fours
Meet me at the corner of Matthew's liquor store
Bag of Funyuns couple of Mickeys
Drink it to the label before it even hits me
We been too messed up to know we're drunk
But we been raised up not to bite our tongue
From a land of hand shakes and old school fist fights
Two bar town two tone pinstripe
Chevy square bodies old school dirt bikes
Swervin' to the derby with only one headlight
Stevinson Bar drinkin' beer at the bull fights
Sittin' in the bleachers with Friday night lights

If you hear the rubber hummin' than you know who's comin'
Couple tall boys deep with my girls and my cousin
All piled up in that step side Chevy
Cookies in the console back wood ready
Cans hit the gravel when the door swang open
They already know who's crews been smokin'
Home made wine, home made diesel
Whatever Ty makes I don't think it's legal
We got a lot of pride but we don't talk slick
'Cause in a two bar town you'll get a busted lip
So put John Pardi on the stereo
And be proud of where your from no matter where you go

Rollin' down a two lane road (Two lane road)
Turn the radio on (Turn the radio on)
Arm hangin' low out the window, Tom Petty on
I feel right at home (Right at home)
And I'm so damn proud (Hell yeah)

This one right here is for everybody that grew up in a small town
It's okay to be proud of where you're from
Roll them windows down, and crank this up
Come on let's go
Yeah

Rollin' down a two lane road (Two lane road)
Turn the radio on (Turn the radio on)
Arm hangin' low out the window, Tom Petty on
I feel right at home (Right at home)
