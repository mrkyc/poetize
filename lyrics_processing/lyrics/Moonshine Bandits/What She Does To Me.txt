Oh my my, yeah I can barely breathe
Oh hell yeah, what that woman does to me
A shot of shine lit a fire inside of me
Oh hell yeah, what the hell she done to me?

I've lost all control, she's got it goin' on
I love the way she's dancin' to that Dwight Yoakam song
Her cowboy boots, her long blonde hair
That rebel tattoo makes me wanna stop and stare

Outlaw, shine in the cup
Whiskey bent, keep linin' 'em up
Fireball, shots on the bar
Jukebox bangin' out, steel guitar (Come on)
Chest piece, born to be a rebel
No high heels, when you dance with the devil
Dive bar, beauty on the dance floor
I'm barely breathin' but I'm bettin' for more (Come on)

Oh my my, yeah I can barely breathe
Oh hell yeah, what that woman does to me
A shot of shine lit a fire inside of me
Oh hell yeah, what the hell she done to me

I love the way she's dancin' to that Gary Allan song
Her cowboy boots, her long blonde hair
Her skin tight jeans knocks me right about my chair

Guitars and Cadillacs
Moves like a street glide, saddle backs
Pistols tattooed on her back
Quick to pull the trigger on a bottle of Jack
I love it when she dances to that Merle Haggard song
I love it when she drinks 'cause she likes to pour 'em strong (Come on, come on)

Yeah, I grab my cup
Walked on over and I said what's up
She said, "I'm trouble, how you do?"
I said, "I'm a rebel, just like you"
Ugh, drank some beers
And then she whispered in my ear
"Let's get the hell up outta here"
I said, "Hell yeah" (Yeah!)
