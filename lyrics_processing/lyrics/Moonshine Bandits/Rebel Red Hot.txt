Yeah
This ones for all you ladies out there
Moonshine Bandits, them Lac boys
We got another one

Rebel red hot and you know she don't stop
With her cup high up in the air (Woo)
She knew what she was doin', that fine as women
Shake around like she didn't care
A whiskey drink, and she crank the Hank
And she say she gets down that way (That way)
A 50 cal mag, and a little brown bag
If you're thinkin' that you're ready to play, okay (Yeah)
She bad as hell when your  up
A little rebel yell, 'cause she tatted up (Come on)
Sweat so much the hair matted up
Watch her work, work, work then she'll back it up (Ha ha)
Got a fine ass tan with her boots on
Got them short ass short Daisy Dukes on
Got a handle of Beam that she shoots on
If you think it's a dream then you gone (You gone)

'Cause she's a bad broad, drinks whiskey everyday
She'll dance her ass off, get drinks and make you go pay
Good Lord she's goin' down like a hound dog, hound dog
And every country boy and this place on lock, on lock
She's re-reb-rebelin

Rebel, rebel red hot
Rebel, rebel red hot
Rebel, rebel red hot
Rebel, rebel red hot

She the type of women you gon' find at the races
Or at the Talladega Superspeedway
Check the faces of them good ol' boys 'cause they done melted off
(Rebel, rebel red hot)
Not the type of girl that you smoke in mirrors
She the real deal, all those fake chicks fear her
She a thoroughbred, she done won the Triple Crown
Take a triple shot from the bottle set it down
Step your game up if you're tryna tackle that
Ain't too many players from this planet that can handle that
Seen them boys lose, lose snags with they last cast
She gon' get a bruise like a goalie with no hockey mask
She's the real deal, I though I already told you that
I'm the only one on this planet that can handle that
Revvin' up my engine 'cause I know that I'll never crash
Hold up, wait (Yeah)

Yeah, shawty got an ass like Shrek in a toss back two
Put some boots like, yeah
I'm watchin' from the bar, man's is such a retard
Visine's in the car, I ain't bleedin' yet
Well you gotta have a little money if you wanna get that
Five star hotel hundred thousand in the rack
Sorry boys she ain't in to y'all cats
'Cause your boots got heels bill fold look flat
You might have it in the bank, but you can't by gains
So the same thing goes, take your ass home
This a chick that'll tell you to get the hell back
Touched like rush Niki Lauda on the second lap
Aloe vera and some honey poppin' Advil
Don't wanna piss on your pride, but your man will
Get caught with your hand in the pot
Get burnt 'cause she rebel red hot, ooh
'Cause she's a bad broad, drinks whiskey everyday
She'll dance her ass off, get drinks and make you go pay
Good Lord she's goin' down like a hound dog, hound dog
And every country boy and this place on lock, on lock
She's re-reb-rebelin

Rebel, rebel red hot
Rebel, rebel red hot
Rebel, rebel red hot
