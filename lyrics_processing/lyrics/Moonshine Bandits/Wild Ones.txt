Well I like to beat the law
And I piss a lot of people off
This middle finger on my hand shows I don't give a damn
If you like it or not
I ain't high class, I fight for fun
Dive bar, bikes and guns
And I roll with the wild ones (With the wild ones)
Yeah with the wild ones (With the wild ones)
Here we come

Got arrested in Texas and they sent me to jail
Did a night in the can, wrote this song from my cell
Runnin' on empty, full tank of whiskey
Ol' lady love me but the kids still miss me
Blue lights flashin', sirens and whistles
Mugshots, whiskey, barstools and pistols
Bikers to clampers, Buck to Haggard
I'm running with the wild ones, drink 'til we stagger
They're always tryin' to make me conform into the scene
And if I did they'd try to take away more of my liberties
Why I stay free, open road, live for the ride with the rebels, oh
And I know, my name will live even when I go

Well I like to beat the law
And I piss a lot of people off
This middle finger on my hand shows I don't give a damn
If you like it or not
I ain't high class, I fight at the bar
Dive bar, bikes and guns
And I roll with the wild ones (With the wild ones)
Yeah with the wild ones (With the wild ones)
Here we come

Neck still red like my Jim Beam stag
The only coozie I use a brown paper bag
Collar still blue I'm dressed in black
I got a little bit of room for a few more tats
Bourbon on my breath still livin' on the run
Got my last paycheck, spent it all at once
Need a phone call sheriff, gotta call my son
Don't grow up like dad, stay away from the wild ones
One more shot of bourbon (One more shot of bourbon)
One more thing to smoke (One more thing to smoke)
Been really good at livin' wrong
So turn me up some coke
One more shot of bourbon (One more shot of bourbon)
One more thing to smoke (One more thing to smoke)
Been really good at livin' wrong
So turn me up some coke (Turn me up)

Well I like to beat the law
