Big B,  Moonshine Bandits, Suburban Noize Records
Let's go
]
I'm an outlaw (What) give me two shots (What)
We don't need a radio, bring the jukebox
For my outlawz, (What) bring me three shots (What)
We can raise hell before this beat stops
I'm a whiskey drinkin' S.O.B
If you don't like that then you won't like me
I'm an outlaw (Woo) I said I'm an outlaw

Fire up the Harley, now I'm off to Cali to do my thing
Rollin' down the 15 full speed, splittin' these lanes
I got the common folk thinkin' that I'm goin' insane
True outlaw, think I'm lyin' just Google the name
Since 2006, me and Dirtball were rockin' this Outlaw shit
And they can't stand it
2011, now I'm back with the Moonshine Bandits
It's that country hip-hop with this white trash renegade
Stayin' real motherfuckers 'til they put us in the grave
Pistol in my pocket, now it's straight at your dome
You the kinda kid that should have left it alone
We stay whiskey drinkin', bottle breakin', girlfriend takin'
Think really give a fuck, you must be mistaken
B.I.G. capitol B, the rest is history
Outlaw motherfucker, don't fuck with me

I'm for 1% patches on the leather vests
And every outlaw biker that I met on the West
I'll probably never see the Opry, if I did I'd laugh
I'd probably break some long necks then go out like Cash (Shit)
They put me in the prison trade, see ya in San Quinton
You can blame the fast livin' or the whiskey and women
Radio don't need to love me, but they need to respect it
I'm here to pick the pieces up where Bob Rock left it (What)
I done a few shows where the Sheriff won't go (Go)
And some of those shows were with David Allen Coe (Yeah)
In the motel sleepin', the truck stop eatin'
A different dive bar, drinkin' every other weekend
Like a trucker drivin' 18, I only slept two (Two)
My neck stays red and my collar stays blue
Hank III knows me, and Shooter does too
If ya don't like them, then I don't like you

Let me get mic one time I'll show ya how a Southern Boy does it
And poor another round for my Moonshine Cousins
My toast to the West
Courtesy of the South
Brought to ya by Colt Ford, people all aboard
It's the Midnight Rider, call me baby Bocephus
For truckers and one percenters, I'm the Southern representer
The midnight rider, a shotgun shooter
Real bad motherfucker, I'm the liquor store looter
Anyway ya want it I can give it to ya baby
If ya work it just right maybe you can get the gravy
Damn, Katy Perry was right
These Cali girls need to come to the South and see that Southern squirrel
I'm a mud diggin, frog giggin', blue collar man
Love Waylon Jennings, Skynard, and Uncle Sam
What ya see is what ya get, that's all that I am
If ya don't like that, I don't give a damn
