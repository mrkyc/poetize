Baptize me in bourbon
Baptize me in bourbon
Baptize me in

Baptize me in bourbon
Fill me up, let me down
Give me bottles, plastic cups, and shot glasses
Pull my troubles out and let 'em drown in the bourbon
Until all my dirt is gone
I learned my lessons, count my blessin'
Take my messes all and baptize them in bourbon

Sippin' on some whiskey and I'm listenin' to Stapleton
Meditatin' on mistakes I said I'd never make again
Devil tried to call me but I put him on hold
Fought for me at home then he left me in the cold
Now I'm all alone, left me with these skeletons
Lungs full of smoke so I guess I'm back in hell again
Try to blow it out but this flame is gettin' hotter
Now I'm left here tryna put it out with this muddy water (Water)

So take the top off the bottle, let me take it
Put my lips to the Bourbon, let me taste it
Take this pain that I got and erase it
Wash my cares away
Take the top off the bottle, let me take it
Put my lips to the bourbon, let me taste it
Take this pain that I got and erase it
Wash my cares away

But I'ma empty out my promises, pour 'em in the glass
Let the wind blow
I'm gone with this this, strike another match
Regret, I got a lot of it, reflectin' on my past
I burned a few bridges that I wish I had back
Forgive me father for a life that's too fast
Help me pick up the pieces that are lying in the ash
If I had a ounce of round for every time I shoulda asked
I could fill an empty river, baptize me in that (That)
