Lawn chairs and lighters lit
Sittin' 'round the bonfire pit
Smokin' on these trees got me stoned
Lawn chairs and lighters lit
Sing a song then take a sip
Underneath these trees that I call home

Drove a long ways we don't need no cable
Just an old lawn chair, old foldin' table
Pack full of pine, cold six pack
Box of wine, old Zig-Zags
Mama keeps dancin' to my iPod tunes
Pops had a shot about a quarter to noon
Smokin' with a squirrel drinkin' with a raccoon
Maybe I'm lit just a little too soon
Whistle in the wind, motor in the boats
Laughin' with the fam and that crackle of oak
Cousin Nick on the sticks and he's pickin' in the cold
Waves of whiskey, chili on the stove

Lawn chairs and lighters lit
Sittin' 'round the camp fire pit
Smokin' on these trees got me stoned
Lawn chairs and lighters lit
Sing a song then take a sip
Underneath these trees that I call home

Smoke start whippin' 'round them old cedar tops
Bath starts splashin' old wooden docks
Fishin' on a buzz we just pour 'em on the rocks
And we don't stop until the cops come knockin'
Great outdoors just like the movie
Grab you a koozie roll you a doobie
Fetch with a chocolate lab named Scooby
Need me a beer yeah bring it right to me
Throw another pole and I lost my bait
Lost in the moment, lost in the lake
Here's to the memories, cheers to the years
'Cause ever since a youngin' I've been comin' here

Where pine trees grow
Got pontoon boats
There's no cell phones
My home away from home
Them fishin' poles
That swimmin' hole
My family goes to our home away from home
