Drink drink drink drink drink (Drink some beer)

Well we jumped in our truck for a midnight ride
And we're headin' to the bar to drink some beer (Drink some beer)
Yes, we're headin' to the bar to drink some beers (Drink some beers, drink some beers)

Well I've been known not to walk the line
I find myself drinkin' on company time
Pour me some whiskey (Whiskey, whiskey)
I want some whiskey (Whiskey, whiskey)

Get up on the table, now break that bottle
Now drink drink drink drink drink
I can raise some hell and I can do it well
Ain't nothin' to a boy that dump a few shells
Gun rack in the back, old Jack in the sack
Yeah, I'm hitting on the dash while I'm hold her hair back
Now if Johnny Cash raped then he'd love this track
Tell momma I'm a rebel thank Hank for that
Tell momma I'm a rebel thank Hank for that

Well we jumped in our truck for a midnight ride
And we're headin' to the bar to drink some beer (Drink some beer)
Yes, we're headin' to the bar to drink some beers (Drink some beers, drink some beers)

Well we've been known not to walk the line
We stumble damn near every night
Pour us some whiskey (Whiskey, whiskey)
We want some whiskey (Whiskey, whiskey)
Whiskey river set me free, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

Get up on the table now break that bottle
Now drink drink drink drink drink
Hey waitress go ahead and get me some
But if it ain't about whiskey don't bring me none
And I ain't walk the line 'cause I'm a rebel son
I'm a tattooed redneck outlaw

Well we jumped in our truck for a midnight ride
And we're headin' to the bar to drink some beer (Drink some beer)
Yes, we're headin' to the bar to drink some beers (Drink some beers, drink some beers)

Well I know you can't walk the line
'Cause the police gon' pull you over later tonight
'Cause you're drunk off that whiskey (Whiskey, whiskey)
Pour some more whiskey (Whiskey, whiskey)
One shot, two shot, three shot, four
Raise your glass then hit the dance floor
Now put 'em on my tab and give me four more
One beer, two beer, three beer, four
Now whiskey women gon' treat me right
I'm gon' raise a little hell 'til I see a little light
I get kicked outta bars almost every night
