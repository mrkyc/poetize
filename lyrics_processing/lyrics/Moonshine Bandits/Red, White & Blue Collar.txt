I was forged from the blood sweat and tears from my dad
Just like his dad and my grandaddy, and his before that
And we answered to the call when Uncle Sam cried
And you know that we always stand and fight for what is right
And they still sing Amazing Grace
At the Baptist church down the street from where I was raised
And I love to see the pride in every small town I go
And to see our flag flyin' high fills me with hope
]
I work my fingers to the bone (To the bone)
For my country, for my family, for my home (For my home)
Now you may not understand but I don't give a damn
'Cause I know (Yeah I know)
I'm a red, white and blue collar soul (Red, white and blue collar)
I'm a red, white and blue collar soul, yeah

My still full of bills to pay
Every drop of blood was a buck I made
Red, white, blue collar
Worked my ass off to make a dollar
Never owned a suit, never had a tie
My grandad said it was all about pride
Leather hands, farmer tan
If you don't understand I don't give a damn
Boys with the hot tar, workin' the rooftops
18 wheelers pile in at truck stops
Boys in the oil field count the sweat drops
We're underdogs 'til the goddamn clock stops

I got family that farms, I got family in the military
I got family turnin' wrenches
They work until that clock stops
We're all red, white and blue collar
We're the red, white and blue collar souls
