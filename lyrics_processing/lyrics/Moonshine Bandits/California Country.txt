Pack of tobacco, bottle of shine
Pontoon boat and some fishin' line
Blow a little smoke just to ease our mind
That's California country
Lake in the woods and the water feels fine
Girls on the deck with no tan lines
Bonfire lit on them summer nights
That's California country

Pull up to the lake drop the tailgate down
Pull out the lawn chair, crank them sounds
Throw out the line when the sun goes down
'Cause this is how we do it when you're from our town
Knobs on the Swampers hum when they roll by
Lift kit, dairy boy, California four by
Super Duty full of cuties, west coast ride
Ziplock full of cookies, valley's so high

From the valley to the beach
From the mountains to the creeks
From the desert to the streets
That's where you'll find me

Dump gas on Cali, watch her blow
Give the farm boys fire, proud they're from the West Coast
Ribeye steaks with some homemade beans
Bourbon in my coffee with a Philly fulla dreams
And the cops can't catch me, I'm livin' too fast
I'm runnin' off shine I don't need gas
All my clampers drinkin' every dive bar dry
This is our song so we put 'em in the sky

From the valley to the beach
From the mountains to the creeks
From the desert to the streets
That's where you'll find me
