White lines, into the sun
He will ride, until it's done
(Yeah, come on)

This is for the clubs all across the globe
And every single outlaw that's been to my shows
All the rebels ridin' quick, dippin' down the road
Bumpin' Texas hippy with some chicks up on a pole
Shout out to Happy, Mick, Bobby, and Tim
At every club house I step my fuckin' foot in
Rest in peace Tipsy Jones, man he was my friend
Drink a fifth of whiskey every time I see him
This is real life shit ain't not curse son or strip
I got love for every club I ever got drunk with

So grab the clear out the copper, the jar out the locker
Nothin' but respect for your patch and your rocker

Pour whiskey on his casket when they lowered him down
Two fingers flyin' high, when they put him in the ground
He was buried as an outlaw (Outlaw)
Yeah he was buried as an outlaw
You might also like
Do a hundred through the desert raisin' hell to this
Real hell raiser's ain't no Jack Teller's bitch
Lightin' up the pine, sippin' on the devils spit
Finger flyin' high got no reason but the hell of it
Highway man poppin' wheelies on a Dyna
Splittin' down the lanes with the law right behind ya
Dive bar drinkin' doin' burnouts on the pavement
Thinkin' you can hang, nope buddy you're mistaken
Had to get the green light to make this song (Song)
You can drink 'em all night when you crank this song

Grab the clear out the copper, the jar out the locker
Nothin' but respect for your patch and your rocker

Pour whiskey on his casket when they lowered him down
Two fingers flyin' high, when they put him in the ground
He was buried as an outlaw
Yeah he was buried as an outlaw


White lines, into the sun
He will ride, until it's done
Pour whiskey on his casket when they lowered him down
Two fingers flyin' high, when they put him in the ground
He was buried as an outlaw (Outlaw)
Yeah he was buried as an outlaw
