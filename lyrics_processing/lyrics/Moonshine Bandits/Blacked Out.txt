We-we get, we-we-we get, we get blacked out
We-we-we get blacked out

The truck that I'm rollin' (Blacked out)
The smoke that I'm blowin' (Blacked out)
Back road, no lights, we're (Blacked out)
By the end of the night we'll be (Blacked out)
The truck that I'm rollin' (Blacked out)
The smoke that I'm blowin' (Blacked out)
Back road, no lights, we're (Blacked out)
By the end of the night we'll be (Blacked out)

We get blacked out (Hey)
Blacked out (Hey)
Blacked out (Hey)
Blacked out (Hey)
We get blacked out (Hey)
Blacked out (Hey)
Blacked out (Hey)

Bus all black, truck all black, off that Jack but I won't black out
Bump that man in black, all blacked out in a Cadillac
Pull that throttle back, I said I don't black out from a bottle of Jack
So sip that, pass it back, hear the bump in the sub when the bass go slap
Slicker than the slobber on my bulldog's jaw
Tougher than the rawhide they're chewin' on
Black out Super Duty gun rack out
You talk too slick, boy you get blacked out

I don't remember yesterday, I just know I was on the stage
Now I'm driftin' down that lonely road through another state
Blacked out from the moment of them screamin' fans holdin' on to me
Yeah, I was born to play the highway but I never sold my soul
I won't stop 'til I've been in every town, I don't know when I'll go home
I'm livin' in the moment, you see me on the stage
Blacked out, blacked out
The truck that I'm rollin' (Blacked out)
The smoke that I'm blowin' (Blacked out)
Back road, no lights, we're (Blacked out)
By the end of the night we'll be (Blacked out)
The truck that I'm rollin' (Blacked out)
The smoke that I'm blowin' (Blacked out)
Back road, no lights, we're (Blacked out)
By the end of the night we'll be (Blacked out)

We get blacked out (Hey)
Blacked out (Hey)

Blacked out (Hey)
We get blacked out (Hey)
Blacked out (Hey)
Blacked out (Hey)
Blacked out (Hey)
