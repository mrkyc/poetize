Yeah, come on

Throw down and never throw up
Sippin' whiskey and gin
Sundown until it come up
Then we gon' do it again
Light one then pass it around
Pour one then slam it down
Who came to party now?
We gonna do it again

Rolled up in that El Camino
Six pack stack and a bag of Cheetos
Zig-zag pack and a glass of Titos
Ziplock sack and a bag of burritos
Jacked up Chevys and jacked up Fords
Jacked off the apple and Jack I poured
So crack that cap back and tap that Coors
We slapped tour back 'til we hit the floor
From the cozy corner to the pats dime club
Lightin' up a willie at the gas light club
Larry rollin' hog legs back of his car
Tailgate parkin' lot back at the bar

We're at Hogs in Vegas hangin' with the freaks
See me at Lafitte's down on Bourbon Street
I'm on Main Street Daytona Beach
Hell I'll drink 'em all dry any day of the week
I'm in Nashville singin' at Santa's Pub
SBG always shows me love
From The Rusty Nail to The Raw Hide
And if a man humble, yeah we're all high
At the Twisted Pig I'm tilted back
Dog House Grill gettin' rowdy off of a pickle back
Back of the saddle rack, let me get a hit of that
We be gettin' shitty any city we at (Where you at?)
We go and drink the bar dry (Drink the bar dry)
Smoke 'til we all high (All high)
Small town to worldwide (Worldwide)
Small town to worldwide
Throw down and never throw up
Sippin' whiskey and gin
Sundown until it come up
Then we gon' do it again
Light one then pass it around
Pour one then slam it down
Who came to party now?
We gonna do it again (Come on)

(Throwdown)
If you didn't get fucked up to that one than you're just fucked up
West Coast in this motherfucker, five star
Shiners back up in this bitch
West Coast, Cent Cal, Green Pea all the way to Tennessee baby
209 to the 615

Throw down and never throw up
Sippin' whiskey and gin
Sundown until it come up
Then we gon' do it again
Light one then pass it around
Pour one then slam it down
Who came to party now?
