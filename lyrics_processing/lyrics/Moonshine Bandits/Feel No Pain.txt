I may not have been dealt the best of hands
But I ain't never been one to back down
My daddy told me do the best I can
And I've gotten pretty good and gettin' up off the ground
Up off the ground, up off the ground
Gettin' up off the ground

And I feel no pain
And I feel no pain
And I feel no pain
And I feel no pain (Sometimes you just don't feel pain)

Blood on my knuckles but I still ride strong
'Til they put me in a pimne box I'm a tickin' time bomb
My dad told me, be proud, stand your ground
And then get the hell up every time you fall down
Yeah, I'm JP Murray mixed with Chuck Liddell
Throw the finger to the critics every time that I fell
'Cause I never gave up no matter what these suckers say
Raisin' hell is a must 'cause it's in my DNA
Got my heart beat pumpin', blood runnin' through my veins
When you work this hard you don't feel no pain
I'll be livin' full throttle 'til they put me in the ground
Put the shine in my casket when you lower me down
You might also like
'Cause I feel no pain
And I feel no pain
And I feel no pain
And I feel no pain (Yeah, come on, uh huh)

Against the grain, against all odds
When the doors were closed I kept my faith in God
From the blood, sweat, the tears, the drive inside
Pushed me through those endless nights
To pick myself up if I should fall
To brush the dust off and still stand tall
The spotlight's blindin', a family behind me
Reminds me to live this life my way
And never give up the string that I chased
To seize the day no matter what I faced
Remember to breathe when it's comin' on strong
Look the storm in the eye and yell "Bring it on"

'Cause I feel no pain
And I feel no pain
And I feel no pain
