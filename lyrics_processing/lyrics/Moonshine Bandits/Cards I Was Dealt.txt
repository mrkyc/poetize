Get your money out the mattress, place your bid (Bid)
Put it all on the cap with the flap bill lid (Lid)
'Cause I earn with a stack, proud of where I'm from (From)
Now I sign the checks, back and the front (Uh)
I used to play shows free, now I make double nickles (Uh)
From that ass in the back,  might hit 'em with the triple (Uh)
Hard to stay humble when you work this hard (Yeah)
They tell you shoot for the moon but I was born a star (Woo)
I'll deal to you with no dirty tricks, no nothin's ever changed
Always schemin' to take my money and that ain't goin' away
That's why they dealt me in and said they love me
Now sign your life away
Better play it through the bone boy, don't wanna go home boy
As long as you're in the game, now hit me

Yeah, that dirty road up at the top can get rough (Can get rough)
Then twists and turns you, mercy, burns your cuts (Yeah right)
Laid down some cards and made it hard on myself
But it ain't gon' change not a damn thing
Just playin' the hand I was dealt

Got them Red Wing boots and some Levi jeans
A couple middle fingers flyin' for the world to see
Told them hang around a minute, we gon' give 'em a show
About to get it, get it poppin', shit I'm rockin' the boat
Like a Peterbilt big rig whistlin' in the wind
'Bout to take it International you know we're Mack like Kenworth
Right up next to nothin' when we came out the gates
Me and Clay took a loss so the bank would get paid
So just give me the beat boy and free my soul
But they ain't nothin' for free, boy, indeed I know
Was it a lodi-dodi life, ain't no party
Keep it head to the grind, don't shit nobody
Keep your work boots on, don't die in your sleep
The two pairs long, don't shit where you eat
Keep that ace in the hole with the one-eyed jack
When life hits low you can hit right back, now hit me

Yeah, that dirty road up at the top can get rough (Can get rough)

Laid down some cards and made it hard on myself

You wanna play the game with me boy
You better learn to play it right
'Cause when the cards lay down if we ain't around
Then the cards ain't shuffled right
And when they call your bluff you gon' realize
There's a dead man's hand right before your eyes
(Now hit me) You should have seen the tail
You've been played by the hand that I dealt (Uh, yeah)
Came in the game, a hot son of a bitch
With my finger flyin' high at everything that they pitch
'Cause if the skipper ain't steerin' then the boat won't sail
I'm the ace in the hole so you can ride on my coat tail
Termites bitin' and they're comin' out the woodwork
Hopin' they could borrow everything I ever stood for
Scoped out right one, let one loose
Watch me Chris Kyle any dealer I choose, now hit me

It's a long, long road when you're made to walk that line
Through the twists and turns and the cuts and burns but your boy gon' be just fine
When the smoke all clears and the scars all heal, don't tell me how I feel
'Cause I wouldn't change not one damn thing, I'm just playin' the cards I was dealt
Check 'em out, now hit me
Yeah, that dirty road up at the top can get rough (Can get rough)
Then twists and turns you, mercy, burns your cuts (Yeah right)
Laid down some cards and made it hard on myself
But it ain't gon' change not a damn thing
