Guess who it is, back with the Bandits
Colt frickin' Ford and them haters can't stand
Redneck Godzilla, ain't nobody realer
Hard like concrete, here comes the big killer
I'm that guy that y'all can hear comin'
Redneck boy with Hank Jr bumpin'
I'm that guy that's rollin' jacked up
Y'all know who it, y'all need need the back up
The only way I run is full throttle
Like a country girl you can keep your model
And keep your glass, I drink out the bottle
Kiss my country ass is my motto
Kiss my-kiss-kiss-kiss my-kiss my country ass is my motto

Backroad renegade, ditched the highway
Straight out the gate I always did things my way

Ridin' down a country road, singin' along to David Allan Coe
(Slingin' mud) Slingin' mud high in the sky, there ain't no place that we can't ride
Full throttle, wide open, runnin' off shine, the swamper's smokin'
This is how we live and this is how we ride
Bottles in the back of my four wheel drive
