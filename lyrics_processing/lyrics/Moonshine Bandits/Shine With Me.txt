Oh do you want to shine with me
Or do you want to shine with me
Oh if you wanna shine it's goin' down tonight
Put your cups up and shine with me

North Cal, San Cal, So Cal, green pea
Georgia, Oregon, Carolina, SC
Texas, whiskey, a lift kit, get a piece
4 by, low ride, strippers, get a knee
Truckers, loggers, haters, fighters
Fuckers, bloggers, hate us, biters
Bottles, fathers, papers, lighters
Mothers, fathers, Raiders, Niners

Farm boys, white boys, get a six pack
Zuggalos, spark it up, can I hit that
Rednecks, slednecks, rebels, outlaws
Shine runs kinda like Sonny runs south paw
Whiskey and women, still what I'm about ma
If you're a shiner, get real loud y'all

Oh we've been everywhere around this land
Oh we've been everywhere around this land
So when you're with the shine, then you'll understand
How we've been raisin' hell across the land

Now pass me the beer for the tired man
For the common man to be higher than

Pass me the beer for the single dad
Workin' for the weekend then sneakin' some Jack

Oh we've been everywhere around this land
So when you're with the shine, then you'll understand
How we've been raisin' hell across the land
Oh do you want to shine with me
Or do you want to shine with me
