Well I was drivin' down on Highway 99 (Highway 99)
Lookin' out my window when somethin' caught my eye
There was farmers plowin' and cotton growin'
And corn poppin' all along the road and I think
I like what see
Now I've traveled all around these 50 states (Oh-oh-oh)
And there have been so many good people I've met along the way
And they're workin' hard and they love the Lord
And they know what they're workin' for and I think
I love who I meet, this is my kind of country

Now were up in the mornin' with a coffee pot
Off to work to a dead-end job
But you won't hear us sing the blues
Come Friday at five well we all get paid
Now were off to the lake on Saturday
Time to light up my barbecue
If you feel like me
Let me hear you say
Hey!
If you feel like me, if you feel like me
Let me hear you say
Hey!
This is my kind of country

Bye bye bye miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levy, but the levy was dry
Couple good old boys drinkin' home made shine
Now were headed to the lake for some overtime
Tom Petty on the iPod I can't go wrong
And AC/DC Shook Me All Night Long
But Free Bird is still my favorite song
Singin' sweet home California all summer long

When the sun go's down we know what to do
We're gonna light up the sky red, white, and blue
And I think I'm proud to be free
Granddaddy fought in the war of '45 (45)
Well he jumped out of a plane behind enemy lines (Oh-oh-oh)
And they were scared as hell but they won the war
And them soldiers knew what they were fightin' for
And I think I'm proud to be free
This is my kind of country

Now were up in the mornin' with a coffee pot
Off to work to a dead-end job
But you won't hear us sing the blues
Come Friday at five well we all get paid
Now were off to the lake on Saturday
Time to light up my barbecue
If you feel like me
Let me hear you say
Hey!
If you feel like me, if you feel like me
Let me hear you say
Hey!
This is my kind of country
I drifted in a Waffle House when I went south
Never had a Oregon apple 'til they put it in my mouth
Mud boggin' in Texas, brisket, heaven
Some apple pie shine from Bootleg Kevin
John on the dairy still copin' the can
It's tomato season so you won't see Dan
Little Cole on the Gator tear it up again
Blue collar built proud Americans
I'm on a pontoon boat Lake Normand again
Damn fishin' derby got me up early again
Little Ronnie got pipes on his Chevy again
And you can bet this is my kind of country man
It's fair time and their packin' it in
Everybody got a Slurpee full of Jack or gin
Take a drive on the five, yeah I like what I see
I guess you could say this is my kind of country

Now were up in the mornin' with a coffee pot
Off to work to a dead-end job
But you won't hear us sing the blues
Come Friday at five well we all get paid
Now were off to the lake on Saturday
Time to light up my barbecue
If you feel like me
Let me hear you say
Hey!
If you feel like me if you feel like me
Let me hear you say
Hey!
