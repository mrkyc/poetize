Rusty ol' Fairlane, smokin' like a freight train
Cuttin' down a two-lane with the top rolled down
Crankin' up Springsteen, headin' out to the creek
Cooler full of empties as I tear through the town

Top off the tank, fill up the cooler
Give that girl a wink and away we roll
No time for stop signs, run it right through 'er
There's a party by the river down an old dirt road
Top off the rank, fill up the cooler
Give that girl a wink and away we roll
No time for stop signs, run it right through 'er
There's a party by the river down an old dirt road

Redneck paycheck, gone on the weekend
Pullin' up in my truck 'cause that's what I sleep in
Pabst Blue Ribbon, daytime drinkin'
Hit the rope swing, oak tree, cannon ball dippin'
Yeah it's hotter than a tater tot where we roll
To the river where the water and the liquor flow
So meet me at the bank, down by the swimmin' hole
We'll drink away the day on this old dirt road

Get the box wine out, fire up the pit
If you're sippin' on the 'shine then you know we get lit
Coozie for my can with the Copenhagen lip
Like to get out of hand when I get a little ripped
Grill full of burgers, smoker full of trout
Skinny dippin' in the river with the music up loud
Better follow the sound if you don't know the route
One way in, only one way out

Top off the tank, fill up the cooler
Give that girl a wink and away we roll
No time for stop signs, run it right through 'er

There's a worm in my bottle, gonna leave it hollow
One little swallow he'll be gone like me
Fire up a smoker, beer gettin' colder
Tie up the rope swing into the creek

Top off the tank, fill up the cooler
Give that girl a wink and away we roll
No time for stop signs, run it right through 'er
There's a party by the river down an old dirt road
Top off the tank, fill up the cooler
