Higher than a hippie in a helicopter
44's on a Ford or a Chevy bogger
Elevator to the doors on the Super Swampers
You been ridin' stock boy
You just been a belly flopper

For all my outlaw renegades rippin' up them backroads
Put up your rebel flag, whip it like a lasso
Like a lasso, like a, like a lasso, whip it like a lasso
If you're proud a rebel boss lady, ain't afraid to scrap no
Throw up your rebel flag, whip it like a lasso
Like a lasso, like a, like a lasso, whip it like a lasso

Higher than a hippie in a helicopter (Helicopter)
44's on a Ford or a Chevy bogger (Chevy bogger)
Elevator to the doors on the Super Swampers (Super Swampers)
You been ridin' stock boy
You just been a belly flopper
Flag toten' 'em stack smokin' 'em
Y'all know what I'm rollin' (Rollin')
Back roadin' 'em black smokin' 'em
Keep them suckers chokin' (Chokin')
Side by side I'm down to ride
But I'll probably die wide open
Get a shovel for the rubble
And the mud that I been throwin', ahh
You might also like
We on them back roads
We in them pine trees
We got them big toys
All you little stock boys
Wanna be just like me

For all my outlaw renegades rippin' up them backroads
Put up your rebel flag, whip it like a lasso
Like a lasso, like a, like a lasso, whip it like a lasso
If you're proud a rebel boss lady, ain't afraid to scrap no
Throw up your rebel flag, whip it like a lasso
Like a lasso, like a, like a lasso, whip it like a lasso

You been ridin' stock boy

Love the way that your eyes are so fixated
What the hell this boy ridin' down the Interstate in
Why the hell you gotta have that thing jacked up so high
Don't you know that we're in another gasoline crisis
Well listen up city slicker that's the country in us
We like to fish, fight, hunt, and play in the mud
We work our fingers 'til they bleed, 'til the job is done
Then drink them cold Coors Light's 'til the mornin' comes
For all my outlaw renegades rippin' up them backroads

Like a lasso, like a, like a lasso, whip it like a lasso
