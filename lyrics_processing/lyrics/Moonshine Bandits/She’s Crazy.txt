Get a little whiskey in her and she goes a little crazy
I'd be lyin' if I said I didn't love it
She's hard shot slammin', then she's bar top dancin'
And I just can't get enough of it
She's crazy and I love it
She's crazy and I love it
She's crazy and I love it
She's crazy and I love it

She's the kinda girl I'm takin' drinkin' on the weekend

Dancin' on the tabletops, I love it how she moves
She's my kinda girl cause she loves to get it loose

Get a little whiskey in her and she goes a little crazy
I'd be lyin' if I said I didn't love it
She's hard shot slammin', then she's bar top dancin'
And I just can't get enough of it
She's crazy and I love it
She's crazy and I love it
She's crazy and I love it
She's crazy and I love it
