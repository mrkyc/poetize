She's got the moves, she's got the moves
(Whoa)
She's got the moves, she's got the moves

She's hell on heels, her attitude
She's smokin' hot with a short fuse
Out on the floor she's bad news
Walks on the wild side, she's got the moves
She's got the moves, she's got the moves
She's got the moves, she's got the moves

Venom like a rattler fist of Jack
Sun dressed black with the pistol taxed
Bettie Page lips with some Christy Mack
Dip in her hip, whip it back
Heart so cold she could rip your soul
Get her on a dance floor, get a her a pole
Sit down slow for a bit of a show
Watch her flip that hair now dip it low
]
She floats like a bird
She's on fire, that's for sure
You got a cold she got the cure
You get too close and you might get burned

Doors were closed so she kicked 'em in
Top cut low belly fit them in
Body full of sin with the evil grin
If looks could kill, she's a killer then
Twistin' her hips and she threw up herhands
Buckcherry got her buckwild ready to dance
Everybody starin' 'cause she got 'em in a trance
She ain't even carin' 'cause they ain't got a chance
