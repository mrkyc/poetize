East coast west coast it's all country
Dirty south midwest it's all country
Leave the city go out back into the country
We're all country
From the first breath alive we're all country
Until the day that we die we're all country
So hop in your ride and get back to the country
Back to the country

West coast renegade, killa Cali outlaw
Wild west king like Colt in the south y'all
Cash tattoo with the flat bill flipped
Clutchin' on my whiskey like a pistol grip
I'm John Wayne with the gauge I ain't walkin' the line
I got my trigger finger itchy off a bottle of shine
'Cause we're shootin' clay pigeons from the bed of a step side
Bumpin' Dwight Yoakam out the window yellin' west side
Spinning like a wagon wheel mama come and rock me
All the ladies love me I'm a cold ass honkey
Hook 'em like a booger every time that I spit one
Yeah we all country ain't no matter where you fish from

East coast west coast it's all country
Dirty south midwest it's all country
Leave the city go out back into the country
We're all country
From the first breath alive we're all country
Until the day that we die we're all country
So hop in your ride and get back to the country
Back to the country

I'm been born to baptized in blue collar blood
Now with pumps through my veins as I stomp through the mud
Through 50 different states, the people's all the same
Just different faces, the shine still burnin' flames
It's so contagious this country rap thing now
All these pop artists ridin' in my lane now
See me on the YouTube with a millions of views
So they think that they can do everything that we do
I've been certified, country fried, spent since 1999
Homicide with the rhymes mad 'cause I lived a life
Y'all my kinfolk, it's our time to shine
American outlaws since birth we ride

East coast west coast it's all country
Dirty south midwest it's all country
Leave the city go out back into the country
We're all country
From the first breath alive we're all country
Until the day that we die we're all country
So hop in your ride and get back to the country
Back to the country

I'm from Jersey worthy as anyone heard
And cattle to be called country raised on dairy farm
Very armed and dangerous so just carry on
No matter where you're from you can carry the country baton
Country's on every continent and every state
Just a country girl with a buck on her tailgate
Windows down blarin' Miranda and George Strait
Ridin' jacked up in a truck that don't play (Don't play)
There's a back road in every city
So go get nitty gritty with those hillbillies
You don't need to lasso to live this
Now tell me, do y'all feel me
East coast west coast it's all country
Dirty south midwest it's all country
Leave the city go out back into the country
We're all country
From the first breath alive we're all country
Until the day that we die we're all country
So hop in your ride and get back to the country
Back to the country

Yeah, look at them (Look at them), now look at us (Look at us)
Everybody that I know is ridin' big old trucks
It's the south savior with a country flavor
Ride with Cali and this cutie from Jersey you heard me?
We got that common thread it's like a family tradition
What you've been missin' we give it 'cause country's how I'm livin'
I'm so Hank with it with a little Merle
A lot of Waylon and Possum there ain't no way to stop 'em
I'm like a super man, got girls they're super fans
Ridin' a super duty, my girls got super booty
I'm just a redneck tryna cash a paycheck
And I'm so blue collar holler if you heard that, woo

East coast west coast it's all country
Dirty south midwest it's all country
Leave the city go out back into the country
We're all country
From the first breath alive we're all country
Until the day that we die we're all country
So hop in your ride and get back to the country
