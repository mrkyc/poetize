Turn it up
It's the wild wild west the wild wild west
It's the wild wild west
It's the wild wild west it's the wild wild west

I'd like to welcome everybody to the wild wild west
The Sunshine State where we get crunk the best
From the Bay to L.A., Sac-Town and back
Through the Valley up in Cali keep the kegs on tap
And if the party's gonna pop then the party gonna crack
And the party don't stop, Cali got my back
Got them big boy four by's, rollin' with Guinness
Them low rider riders that are rollin' with switches
Gangsters, skaters, bikers, strippers
Lakers, Raiders, Niners, Clippers
Choppers, coppers, can I get a witness?
Come on ma, you know why you want to hit this
Sixteen switches on a Eldoradio
Smoke down windows with a bangin' audio
This is how we roll when we roll, when we roll
You know how we blow when we blow that dro
Cali Coast

Sweet home California, California
Where my skies are always blue (Where my skies are always blue)
Sweet home California, sweet home, oh yeah

Lord I'm comin' home to you

Now my old town is like every small town, on the wild west coast
We get rowdy and we cut loose, we some bad ass dudes
Intoxicated from the whiskey (Oh yeah)
Intoxicated from the rhythm and blues
(Let me help you sing, let me help you sing)
Moonshine go coast to coast
We gonna sing songs play show to show
And we keep on movin' down the interstate
Slangin' CD's out the tail gate
We go state to state for the place that we from
The town that we run, the sound that we brung
You can hear our sound all around the globe
But there's only one place that we call home and that's

Sweet home California, California
Where my skies are always blue (Where my skies are always blue)
Sweet home California, sweet home, oh yeah
I love comin' home to you
Lord I'm comin' home to you

I'm in the In & Out Burger then I'm hittin' the club
I'm in the Pink Poodle, San-ho gettin' some love
I'm in the Arco on Saxscot box above
I'm in my black Cadillac bumpin' California Love
I'm in the GB-freed in the SBC watchin' SF play against OAK
I'm in the LBC then the SAC but homie it's still all C to the A
I'm in the floor seats with Jack Nichol watchin' the game
I'm in the LBC with ol' Jesse James
I'm in the Humbolt County and we puffin' the train
I'm in the double XL next to Dre and The Game
I'm up in Fresno Atark and we bettin' on the dogs
I got love for my Valley because we all stand tall
Where we from?
