Let's make a toast to the good times
And let's drink away the bad
So to hell with the rough times
May the good ones always last

Let's go drinkin' with mom and dad
Yeah, whiskey is good when times are bad
So bring Uncle Johnny and Uncle Jack
That's my family and they got my back
I got another uncle and his name is Jim
By the end of the night I'll be talkin' to him
There ain't no problem that he can't solve
So I'll be hangin' out with Jim all night long

Let's make a toast to the good times
Drink away the bad
So to hell with the rough times
May the good ones always last
And together we will always ride
Through the tears and laughs
We're family to the end
Raise your glass

Pour me a shot, one on the rocks
Been solvin' all my problems with mom and pop's
Jose ain't my uncle, he still family
Got a crazy old lady and her name is Brandy
Let's go drinkin' with dad and mom
Boozin' is good when times are not
So if you had a bad day pour one more shot
And by the end of the night we already forgot
Let's go

You know what it's like around my parents house in the back yard
Just solving a world of problems
*Mumbling/Laughter*
We solve everybody's problems on a Friday night out there
