Back in the woods where the law don't go
You four-wheel drive a couple miles or so
And the sun stops shinin' and the stars come out
And one way in and no way out
And then you hear "Yee-haws" and a shotgun blast
You know that you made it there at last
Where the outlaw women can dance all night
And the liquor hit you quicker but feels just right

And the blood will flow but you'll have a good time
And the fires are always lit
And the moon shines
(What you say boy?)

Coyotes get to runnin' when them dogs start to bark
In California on the plate on every Chevy that is parked
Way back in the hills by that old wooden shack
Beauty queen, silhouette, spyin' old smoke stack
Bullfrog still sippin' from that Mason by the still
Got that dually with a mattress back away up on the hill
Bonfire got your jacket smellin' like your last meal
Got that hog still spinnin' like I spin my four wheels
They say Cali ain't country but I'll let you know the deal
I know some Oakdale boys that'll leave you in the field
Reachin' back to the rack, split a lip and grab the steel
I'm a Cali boy, valley boy, I think you know the deal
You might also like
And the blood will flow but you'll have a good time
And the fires are always lit
And the moon shines
(What you say boy?)

Two kegs of dust and now they floatin' in the mud
The firewater's flowin', now there's bound to be some blood
Ride 17 miles past the city limit sign
Where the bonfire's lit and the moon always shines
We raise hell, now that's country to us
I said we raise hell, now that's country to us
And our outlaw women like to drink all night (Yeah)
They ain't afraid of you and no they ain't afraid to fight
You can see the smoke clouds up and down Cotton Road
Turn that Bocephus loud 'til the sheriff makes us go
Hit the ditch bank, gravel pit, whippin' back roads
Smokin' funny cigarettes with some David Allan Coe

And the blood will flow but you'll have a good time
And the fires are always lit
And the moon shines

Yeah
Now this is Calicountry
Wild west
Tell Music Row they ain't ready for us outlaws
Sub Noize, Average Joe's
We're here to stay
Ha ha ha
