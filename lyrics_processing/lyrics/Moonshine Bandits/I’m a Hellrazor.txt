Oh, yeah
Yeah! Come on
I'm goin' down this lane

Devil without a cause and 98 rock shit
Some hogs have balls and we hop in a mosh pit
Stompin', rockin', robbin' a pots smith
Don't give two shits how pissed the cops get
Double back full of scotch, bangin' in the three fifth
Mom ridin' shotgun, she just took three sips
Lit by the fire but she still took three hits
Finger flyin' higher than a god damn G6
Booze in my closet, think I'm gonna grab it (Come on)
Cross on my wall with a bunch of bad habits
Ink on my skin, shows where I been
All the hell I raised and all the shit I'm in (Let's go)
Mama done tried, mama done tried
Let the choir sing and let the angels fly
When the church bells ring I'll say goodbye
'Cause the highway to hell has been a hell of a ride (Come on)

Held by the line of a razor (A razor)
One bad SOB (B)
Livin' overdrive, whiskey overload
I'm just a low down rebel soul
'Til my blood gone cold, I'm a damned Hellrazor
Damned Hellrazor (Razor, razor, razor, razor, razor, razor)

My daddy was a preacher
Tried to teach me wrong from right
Lord knows he did everything he could
But he never knew this life (Oh no)
Held one hand on the Bible
Got one foot in the flame
Please dear God don't let me lose my soul
Just to have this world to gain
(Come on)
