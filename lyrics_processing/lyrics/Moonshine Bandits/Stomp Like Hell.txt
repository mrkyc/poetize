I see the neon lights at the end of the road
Feel the big bass stompin', yeah it's shakin' the floor
Before the bar doors close I'm gon' get to steppin'
Gonna stomp like hell just to get to heaven
]
In the zone, I'm all in one
Get another shot, I'm gone son
Flash them lights when the bass go "thud"
Good old boy 'bout to cut a rug
Ride that bull baby get the saddle
Bucket so hard makin' bottles rattle
Bump that bass, she'll make you shake
Snap them necks 'til they finally break
Hold the handle of a bottle of Jack
Boots all scuffed up in the back
Threw it like a boomerang, brought it back
Didn't know God made a bra like that
Stomp so hard, dance floor broken
Straight from hell, body smokin'
Gangster hell, keep it movin'
She's my angel, time to roll then

Ooh, da-da da, ooh, da-da da-da da
Ooh, da-da da, ooh, da-da-da-da da
Ooh, da-da da, ooh, da-da da-da da
Ooh, da-da da, ooh, da-da-da-da da

Oh, hold up it's time to ride
I can hear that music callin' and no we ain't got all night
When you feel the high and the street's on fire
And the girls start floodin' in
Got your heart a pumpin', starter jumpin'
We don't want this night to end
