But there's gonna be a perfect day
Trouble get out of my way
I don't know why Lord
But I'll find out by and by
I don't know why Lord I stand in need sometimes
I don't know why Lord my poor heart bleeds sometimes
But there's gonna be a perfect day
Trouble get out of my way
I don't know why
But I'll find out by and by
You know the Lord, He Moves in mysterious ways
His wonders, they are to perform
He plants His footsteps way out on the sea
You know He rides in on every storm
His ways, they are hard to understand sometimes
No matter, no matter how hard we try, oh Lord
Sometimes I wonder why He allows some things to happen to me
But, oh I'll find out, I'll find out by and by
Whoa, oop
I don't know why I have to cry sometimes
I don't know why Lord I have to sigh sometimes
But there's gonna be a perfect day
Trouble get out of my way
I don't know why Lord
But I'll find out by and by
You might also likeI don't know why Lord I stand in need sometimes
I don't know why Lord this old poor heart it has to bleed sometimes
But there's gonna be a perfect day

By and by
I won't have to cry no more, by and by (By and by)
I won't be burdened no more, by and by (By and by)
Gonna lay my burdens down, by and by (By and by)
Going home to get my crown, by and by (By and by)

It'll all be over, by and by (By and by)
By and by

Said there'll be a perfect day
Trouble get out of my way
