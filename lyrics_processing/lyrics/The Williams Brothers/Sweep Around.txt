You know there are too many people trying to take care of
Other people's business and they can't even take care of their own
What you need to do is take six months to mind your own business
And six months to leave other folks' business alone
All I'm trying to say is

Sweep around your own front door before you try to sweep around mine
Sweep around your own front door before you try to sweep around mine

You smile in your neighbor's face and talk about them behind their back
But if you found out they were doing the same thing to you, you know you
Wouldn't like that. Who are we to judge what other people do, take a look
At yourself and you could find some faults too

Sweep around your own front door before you try to sweep around mine
Sweep around your own front door before you try to sweep around mine

You're always on the telephone putting down on someone else
You need to take a little time, stop, look in the mirror and
Check yourself. We all have sinned and come short of God's
Glory today, So we don't have time to spread hearsay

Put love in your heart where there is hate
(You need to clean it up)
I wouldn't let it be said I waited too late
(Clean it up)
Stop going around
(You need to clean it up)
(Clean it up)
Talking about your friends
Don't you know that that's a sin
(You need to clean it up)
How can you criticize someone else when you are doing wrong yourself
(Clean it up)
(You need to clean it up)
Be careful how you through stones
Because it might break up somebody's home

Sweep around your own front door before you try to sweep around mine
