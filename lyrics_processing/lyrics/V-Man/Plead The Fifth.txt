I probably shouldn't speak on it
More than a guilty conscience got the names of who did it
They tellin' me to plead the fifth
Should I speak my peace or maybe I should rest in it
The evidence is wrapping my mind
Bring up the first witness he won't tell ya who did
If the corporate won't rectify this
Maybe I should plead the fifth

Plead the fifth
I don't know who it is stop asking
I ain't like the rest, yvng boys not ratting
Yeah I saw the FEDs and I flew right past 'em
Yeah I did the dirt, but I swear it's all past tense
Can't stop for anybody boy y'all snapping
If I see a bad jawn I'll put her in the backseat
I was with the V, we was running like a track meet
I'm so serious... why y'all laughing?
This is not a joke we been on another road
We wasn't even in town we wasn't even around
Why you asking all these questions
Like a yvngin' got the answers
I don't touch a bottle 'less I'm in a sanctuary, nah

Yeah they say that I'm his brother
Coming from another mother
Yeah we look out for each other
Different bed same covers
We was riding down the block
Til we heard 100 shots
In the summer it was hot
We all thought it was the cops
I don't know nothing else
Keep my feelings to myself
Can I speak to someone else
Ain't my bro, I call for help
All of y'all got the wealth
Y'all can do it to yourself
If you can't not my problem
But your badge up on the shelf, V
I probably shouldn't speak on it
More than a guilty conscience got the names of who did it
They tellin' me to plead the fifth
Should I speak my peace or maybe I should rest in it
The evidence is wrapping my mind
Bring up the third witness he might tell ya who did
If the corporate won't rectify this
Maybe I should plead the fifth

Will I speak the truth
Only the truth
Nothing but the truth
Yes I will
First I seen him when he did it
He was posted on the corner
Had the whole crew rolling with him
They was wearing all black
This the truth all facts
And he told the plug he need the loud
He texted all caps
Last name Dime, first name Yvng
He stay down at the Getty and he always got his gun
He be with KATHOS & C.N.C
Don't forget D-Staxx & K. Gianni
They all ask me for the loud like I'm the "tree-man"
And I think their group is called something like 'vee man'
Alright let's be honest
Get me out of this I promise
This is all they did was steal some candy and some condoms
Yeah they really did it, I'm out of this I'm finished
May need witness protection I've been singing like the opera
When we first started all we wanted was some commas
I never would've thought that they would turn into some robbers
They cleaned up the evidence I'm so surprised you got us
