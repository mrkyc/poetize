I'm losing sleep
Light a smoke so I can breathe
It's too dark, it's too loud in the city
If I had a god, I would say he was wrong
Got these scars, but I think they're pretty

So I say Hey!
Been high since yesterday
You know it kills the pain
It's hard to find a love through every shade of grey
So tired of the same
Never seems to change

It's hard to find a love through every shade of grey
It's hard to find a love through every shade of grey
It's hard to find a love through every shade of grey
It's hard to find a love through every shade of grey
Hey hey hey...
Been high since yesterday
It's hard to find a love through every shade of every shade of
Hey hey hey...
Been high since yesterday
It's hard to find a love through every shade of every shade of grey
Hey hey hey...

I'm wide awake
I don't know if I can take
Another call another night in the city
Chasing the spark that got lost in the dark
Left these scars, but I think they're pretty

So I say Hey!
Been high since yesterday
You know it kills the pain
It's hard to find a love through every shade of grey
So tired of the same
Never seems to change

It's hard to find a love through every shade of grey
It's hard to find a love through every shade of grey
It's hard to find a love through every shade of grey

Been high since yesterday
It's hard to find a love through every shade of every shade
