When lights are low
High anticipation waiting for the show
Feel my heart is racing, losing all control
Got me so impatient for you
Yeah, yeah
'Cause in my mind
I see you touching me in ways undefined
I don't want to stop it
I gotta press rewind
So baby tell me what we gonna do
Gonna do
Oh
Don't you dance with all the lights
Let's make this last all night, yeah
Oh
Let's do it till the sky turns bright
Let's make this last all night
When you look into my eyes
The world stops and sparks fly
There's nothing sweeter than this paradise
Sing, oh
Baby set my love on fire
We can make this last all night

Building up inside it's like a sweet release
You play with this emotion, oh, so cleverly
You got me so addicted to you

'Cause in my head
I know the night doesn't really have to end
I'm ready steady go
I am so prepared for whatever you say boy I do
