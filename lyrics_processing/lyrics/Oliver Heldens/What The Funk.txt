I'm in love, with the city
And I don't wanna leave while the night is still young
Taking shots, dancing dirty
Every day in a dream and I don't wanna wake up
This won't be the last time, this could be our last life
And I don't, and I don't wanna lose the feeling
'Cos I'm love, with the city
And I don't wanna leave when the night is still young
HEY!

I got MJ in my feet, taking control of me
It's time to release the beast
Oh, hell no!

What The Funk
I'm feeling electrified
What The Funk
On whisky and coke all night
Gonna move it like I should
Good, good, good, good times
What The Funk
I'm out to get drunk, I'm drunk to get love tonight
You might also like
Oh my god, it's a party
And I don't wanna leave til they play my favourite song
Don't blame us, blame the boogie
Tryna stop but I'm party rocking in my zone
This won't be the last time, this could be our last life
And I don't, and I don't wanna lose the feeling
'Cos oh my god, it's a party
And I don't wanna leave til they play my favourite song
HEY!

I got MJ in my feet, taking control of me
It's time to release the beast
Oh, hell no!

What The Funk
I'm feeling electrified
What The Funk
On whisky and coke all night
Gonna move it like I should
Good, good, good, good times
What The Funk
I'm out to get drunk, I'm drunk to get love tonight
Everybody's looking, everybody's looking
Everybody's looking for a good time
Everybody's looking, everybody's looking
Everybody's looking for a good time

What The Funk!
I'm feeling electrified
What The Funk!
On whisky and coke all night
Gonna move it like I should
Good, good, good, good times
What The Funk!
I'm out to get drunk, I'm drunk to get love tonight

Everybody's looking, everybody's looking
Everybody's looking for a good time
Everybody's looking, everybody's looking
