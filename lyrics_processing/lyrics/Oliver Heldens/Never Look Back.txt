Don't lose your mind when you watch me walk away
Thunder and lightning, we're gonna detonate
Don't lose your mind when you watch me walk away
Thunder and lightning, and we never look back


Solid gold, saw you walking like that
Step too close, turn to liquid like that
Sleek and bold, can we keep it like that?
And we never look back
Fill it up, motor oil like that
Butter bomb and you light it like that
Throw it over your shoulder like that
And we never look back

Shhh, don't wake the lion
Come meet the flame
Don't wake the lion
Uh oh, too late
Solid gold, saw you walking like that
Step too close, turn to liquid like that
Sleek and bold, can we keep it like that?
And we never look back
