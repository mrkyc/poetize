Yeah
Oh-woah
Oh-oh
Oh-oh, hey

You know why I'm goin' crazy?
Because of you, only you, I
Hypnotized, you got me mesmerized with the thought of you
I'm in awe of you, oh
She's my medication for my heartbreak
Oh, I need her
She rehabilitate me
But I'm still addicted, yeah, to her

Livin' life blind with my top down, my roof missin' (Ooh)
This kind of love only comes around in a lifetime, I can't miss it (No)
This ain't no typical, ordinary scenario
I can't control (You know)

When opposites attract, I overdose, yeah, I
I took too much of your love, I overdosed, yeah, I
Girl, your sex is a drug, faded floatin', feelin' like
Ooh (Hey), ooh-woah (Woo, woo, woo, woo)
I-I-I-I, I over-I overdose
Ooh-oh-oh, I overdose (Woo, woo, woo, woo)
Every time I do you, baby girl, I overdose
I overdose
