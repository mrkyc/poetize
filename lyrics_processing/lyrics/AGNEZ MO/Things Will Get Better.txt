I'm the one that's always been here
Even through the darkest nights
And brave the tide for you and me
All I ever needed was you
You never have the worry at all
What happened to us
What happened to love

Every step seems just a little better
Your mistakes don't really seem to matter
I won't let go, we're okay
As long as I got you and you got me
I've been saying to myself be stronger
We can work it out, it's gonna take a little bit longer
As long as I got you, you got me you say
Things will get better
Just a little better

The mirror's never been so clear
Have you shattered like a broken glass
Can we mend the past with me and you
Maybe I should face the truth
I need you to be what I know you can be
Don't give up on us
Don't give up on love

Every step seems just a little better
Your mistakes don't really seem to matter
I won't let go, we're okay
As long as I got you and you got me
I've been saying to myself be stronger
We can work it out, it's gonna take a little bit longer
As long as I got you, you got me you say
Things will get better

Oooh yeah, yeah
Uhmmm mmm
Things will get better
Tell me things would get better
Just a little bit... better

Every step seems just a little better
Your mistakes don't really seem to matter
I won't let go, we're okay
As long as I got you and you got me
I've been saying to myself be stronger
We can work it out, it's gonna take a little bit longer
As long as I got you, you got me you say
Things will get better
