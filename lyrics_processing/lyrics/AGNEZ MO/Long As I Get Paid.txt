Pimpin hard
It's an art
Play your part
Go stand in the corner maybe
I'm the light
In the dark
Breakin' hearts
Finger fuckin' diamonds baby

I've been around you know what I need and
I ain't gonna wait for nobody's permission
Might say I'm rude, might call me conceited

Don't care my name in yo mouth
As long as I get paid
Long as I get paid, long as, long as I get paid
Long as I get paid, long as, long as I get paid
Long as I get paid, long as, long as I get paid
Don't care my name in yo mouth
As long as I get paid

Sex and lace
On my face
Gimme space
Go stand in the corner baby
Hunet bands
On my ass
When I do my dance
Make a money shower baby
You might also like
Bag a money what you lookin' at
When I walk up on ya wit ya lookin' ass
You got ninety-nine problems that I can't solve
I'm not the one, hey
Don't be callin' blowing up my phone
Don't you blow my high get me out my zone
If it ain't 'bout dollars don't make sense
I need commas and o's

I've been around you know what I need and
I ain't gonna wait for nobody's permission
Might say I'm rude, might call me conceited

Don't care my name in yo mouth
As long as I get paid
Long as I get paid, long as, long as I get paid
Long as I get paid, long as, long as I get paid
Long as I get paid, long as, long as I get paid
Don't care my name in yo mouth
As long as I get paid

Shinin' like a star
I'm havin' a ball
Bottles stack 'em high
Champagne waterfalls
You never seen this before
Come watch me put on a show
And if you ready to let me know
Ready, set (Go!)
I've been around you know what I need and
I ain't gonna wait for nobody's permission
Might say I'm rude, might call me conceited

Don't care my name in yo mouth
As long as I get paid
Long as I get paid, long as, long as I get paid
Long as I get paid, long as, long as I get paid
Long as I get paid, long as, long as I get paid
Don't care my name in yo mouth
As long as I get paid
Long as I get paid, long as, long as I get paid
Long as I get paid, long as, long as I get paid
Long as I get paid, long as, long as I get paid
Don't care my name in yo mouth
