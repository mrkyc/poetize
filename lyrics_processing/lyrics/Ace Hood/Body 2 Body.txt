Baby, you don't have to try to read my mind
'Cause you know I wanna get it in (Na'mean?)
And tell me why would we just think about it?
If you want it, then I got it (You know what it is, baby)
We can be body to body (Mr. Hood), body to body
I don't mean to rush you, girl
But we should be body to body
Body to body (Mr. Hood), body to body (Yeah, uh)

Picture your body soakin', bath water
No panties on, come up out them leg warmers (Ooh)
Wrap up your hair (Hair), leave on your heels (Heels)
Kissin' you while I whisper, "Shawty, how it feels?"
Let your mind wonder, oh, you thinkin' dirty?

Why dream about it? Let's take advantage
My body on your body, hope that you can manage (Yes)

Pullin' on her hair to let her know I'm still hood (Right)
Damn right (Damn right), serve her the real
