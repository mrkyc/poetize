Uh, would you ride for me? Would you die for me?
Had no money, would you still love me? (Yeah)
If I got jammed up and did a little time
Would you still be the woman who gon' hold it down? (Yeah)
Through the hard times and them cloudy days
Would you stand strong? Would you run away?
All the bullshit and all the heartache
She still ridin' with a nigga since the first day
Her ambitions of a rider
She would be around if I never had a dollar
She would be my nurse if I ever need a doctor
Bonnie and Clyde, she never side with the coppers
Never break code, forever be loyal
Never break ties 'til we buried in the soil
If it ever go down, she tryna go too
Down for whatever bullshit I'm goin' through
And I gotta hold on, knowin' she my backbone
Nothin' like that feelin' when I'm in her so long
Passion and that lovin' that's between us so strong
Grippin' on that ass, she just tell me, "Hold on"
And she can be the wife, maybe one day
Have a few kids, gon' and travel out the state
She gon' ride or die for a nigga 'til the grave (Yeah)
And I hope it never change
