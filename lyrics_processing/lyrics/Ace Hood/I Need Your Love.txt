Ace, we killin' 'em baby
Woo!

I need your love, need your love
Seen her at the mall chillin' wit her ladies
So fine, she mine, hey, baby
Oh, I need your love, need your love
Just right, my type, what I like and that dress fittin' nice
Can we kick it tonight?
Tryna get right for the end of the night
Shots to the head just to clear my mind
Baby I'ma Sag, tell me what's your sign?
From the bottom to the top girl you just my kind
I need your love, need your love
Got my mind so gone, bae, so what
Sho' nuff, wait, baby, hold up

Her love shawty know I really need that
Can't live without it I need rehab
From the pretty lipstick thinkin' how the waist sit so thick man that ass need a decal
Mayweather wit the stick get the beatdown
Throw it back I'ma snatch it like a rebound
Buss that, yeah, shawty, like a Greyhound
What up doe? Lil mama from the D-Town
Girl, I need your love it's like fresh air
Kick it with a Young Prince like Belair
Just as long as you never do it farewell
They stare but they never get to touch there
See you bad as hell and they know it
Fresh up outta the shower with that lotion
Bend it over you might cause a commotion
Reminiscin' how i'm swimmin' in ya ocean
Gone head lil mama, cause the swag up on her with the fly red bottoms
Me & you make sense, get the other boys pissed cause they already got her
Cause I need that love, swear its somethin' like a drug
Come fuck wit a thug, from the bed to the tub
You might also like
I need your love, need your love

So fine, she mine, hey, baby

That's right shawty welcome to the good life
We can do dinner time if the mood right
On the water with the stars and the moonlight
I deserve that love, you the wife type
Make sense I'm a boss and you need that
Upgraded hand bags baby Belkins
Credit cards going hard up in Neimans like Cam'ron bae I really mean it
That's my sense of humor and see I'm really like tryna pursue ya but
I know ya last boyfriend was a loser and I ain't lyin' im just way more cooler
I'm a fly young man take you anywhere you wanna im the guy that can
Hopin' for that chance I can give ya my time for ya love in advance
And that's all I demand, so shawty what ya sayin'?
Money ain't a thang lil' mama you can trip to the land we ain't even gotta plan
Put ya feet in the sand then its back to the suite no sleep in the bed
Straight freak in the sheets
I'ma beast with the D so deep, damn
I need your love, need your love
Seen her at the mall chillin' wit her ladies
So fine, she mine, hey, baby
Oh, I need your love, need your love

Girl, you killin' them hoes (I know it)
Watch you walk by (Wait for it)
Yeah that ass lookin' perfect girl look at how you work it
You ain't even have to pay for it ( know it)
Slidin' in that Jeep truck with the doors off, top off
Can you take yours off?
Ha-ha, I'm so crazy, ain't that the reason why you love me, baby?
Girl you killin' them hoes ( know it)
Watch you walk by (Wait for it)
You already that I keep that shit a hundred
Fuckin' wit my shades on, call me Stevie Wonder
Put it so deep she can feel it in her stomach
Dick so good I can tell it when she runnin'
Eyes roll back I can tell it when ya cumin
Tongue game mean I can tell that ya love it
Just tryna get right for the end of the night
Shots to the head just to clear my mind
Baby I'ma Sag, tell me what's your sign?
From the bottom to the top girl you just my kind
I need your love, need your love
Oh, I need your love, need your love
