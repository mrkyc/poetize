I got a bass drum thumping in my head
Woke up at the crack of dawn
I was laying in a strangers bed
He looked nice but I didn't think twice
Cause I knew that I'd done wrong
He looks like he's starting to stir
I better be long gone

I do the walk of shame (won't do it again, won't do it again)
I better do the walk of shame (won't do it again, won't do it again)
I do the walk of shame (won't do it again, won't do it again)
I do the walk of shame, baby (won't do it again, won't do it again)
I do the walk of shame
Step outside to the streets of the city
Well, damn it's a new day
Old Mack, he's sitting on the corner
And he sees me comin' his way
He just starts shaking his head cause he knows I'd done it before
Oh lord, wash away my sin
I ain't ever gonna do it no more

I do the walk of shame (won't do it again, won't do it again)
I better do the walk of shame (won't do it again, won't do it again)
I do the walk of shame (won't do it again, won't do it again)
I do the walk of shame, baby (won't do it again, won't do it again)
I do the walk of shame (won't do it again, won't do it again)

And you're wondering who is to blame
Just pack your things and go cause it never ever happened
If you can't remember his name

I do the walk of shame (won't do it again, won't do it again)
I better do the walk of shame (won't do it again, won't do it again)
I do the walk of shame (won't do it again, won't do it again)
I do the walk of shame, baby (won't do it again, won't do it again)
