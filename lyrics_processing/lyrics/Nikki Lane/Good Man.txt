Picking up all your mess that you're leaving behind
Cause you go on the road for a month at a time
You say you can't wait to get back home
And I don't mind when you're coming home late
Whiskey on your breath, say you made a mistake
Kissed a girl on the mouth, it was a three-dollar bet
But you'll always call me your own

How can I be the one that cries for you
Unless you love me true
How can I be the one that lets it slide
Unless you take the time
To be a good man to me
Any day of the week
Tell the boys all "No," that you just can't go
No, tonight it's just my baby and me
Be a good man to me
I understand if it's not in your way
To go doting around on a lady all day
But the simplest thing that would make my heart ring
Well, you don't even think to do it
So if it's too much to be given enough
To keep the sparkle alive
I guess that we tried everything that we could
To keep our love going good
And I'd like to think I'm better for it
You might also like
How can I be the one that cries for you
Unless you love me true
How can I be the one that lets it slide
Unless you take the time
To be a good man to me
Any day of the week
Tell the boys all "No," that you just can't go
No, tonight it's just my baby and me
Be a good man to me
And if you did ever really love me
Then it wasn't in vain
Cause what's a girl without a broken heart
And some baggage to claim
When she climbs on a plane
I don't mind doing dishes at night
Picking up all your mess that you're leaving behind
Cause you go on the road for a month at a time
