Patience is a virtue
Battered up and beaten by the road that horse has traveled
And I've rode so far my rope has come unraveled in the rain
Sometimes I get so tired, I don't know if I'll get home again
And Cecil was the first man
To ever teach me patience was in the palm of my hand
He said, "Girl, work hard and just be good to the land
And you'll find love in all that glitters
Sometimes it's tiny as a splinter"

As long as I can be
Good enough for you, that's good enough for me
Until the end of time
Darling, won't you say you will always be mine?
And if I start to stumble as I make my way back to your arms
Then I'll remember how you told me our love was written out amongst the stars
And you're never too far

So I'll try to show you patience
Even when the whole wide world goes crazy
Even when I get so mad, I just can't take it
Sometimes it's hard to shake it
But I made you a promise and I swear that I won't break it
You might also like
As long as I can be
Good enough for you, that's good enough for me
Until the end of time
Darling, won't you say you will always be mine?
And if I start to stumble as I make my way back to your arms
I'll remember how you told me our love was written out amongst the stars
And you're never too far

It's a beautiful morning to tell someone you love them
To tell someone you're thinking of them
All throughout the day
And then in the evening
We'll lay side by side
There's no other place I'd like to hide away

So that's patience, hope, and kindness
And all of those things that we call on to remind us
Of all the love and the trust we have inside us
So that evil just can't find us
I'll keep my heart protected so that nothing can divide us

As long as I can be
Good enough for you, that's good enough for me
As long as I can be
Good enough for you, that's good enough for me
As long as I can be
Good enough for you, that's good enough for me
As long as I can be
