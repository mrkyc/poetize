I hit the number, it was always you
I was looking for sevens, they were coming in twos
I was on a bad streak and honey, it was getting me down
Down to my last dime with no good news
I was getting pretty tired of singing the blues
My luck was running dry, was about to leave this town
I'll give it one more try
I'll give it one last shot
Put a quarter in the slot
Could it be a jackpot?

Viva, Las Vegas!
Atlantic City rendezvous
Weekend in Reno, late night casino
I'll go anywhere with you
I should have seen it coming
You were always there
Standing in the corner with a warm, dark stare
I had to move a little closer so I could get a better look
You said, "come on, little darling, we should have our share
Let's try to roll the dice and run away somewhere"
Didn't have to say another word
No, that was all it took
You might also likeI said, "let's go all in"
I'll give it all I've got
Put a quarter in the slot
There it is: jackpot

Viva, Las Vegas!
Atlantic City rendezvous
Weekend in Reno, late night casino
I'll go anywhere with you
Rolling down the Mississippi
Living us a riverboat dream
Playing the wildcard life ain't been too hard
Since you ran away with me
It's been a long, long time since we placed our bets
Crazy as it is, we ain't through winning
True love don't come til you lay it all down the line
So darling, go all in
And give it all you've got
Put your quarter in the slot
It's gonna be jackpot

Viva, Las Vegas!
Atlantic City rendezvous
Weekend in Reno, late night casino
I'll go anywhere with you
Rolling down the Mississippi
Living us a riverboat dream
Playing the wildcard life ain't been too hard
Since you ran away with me
Jackpot! I hit the number
It was always you
Jackpot! I hit the number
It was always you
Jackpot! I hit the number
It was always you
Jackpot! I hit the number
