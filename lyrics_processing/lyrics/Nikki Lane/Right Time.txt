It's always the right time
It's always the right time to do the wrong thing
It's 2 am and you're sitting at the bar
Wondering if you should make it your last call
But don't call me
Oh, don't make my phone ring
Cause you know what I say
Honey, it's always the right time to do the wrong thing
Well we're strolling in to your daddy's country club
That valet left that Shelby motor running
Let's jump inside
Oh, let's take it for a ride
Cause you know what I say
Honey, it's always the right time to do the wrong thing

Any day or night time
It's always the right time
It's always the right time to do the wrong thing
If you're looking for a good time
You and me will get on just fine
It's always the right time to do the wrong thing

I knock on his door and ask him for a toke
Just because
Hell, we're both outlaws
Well, he'll tell you the same
Honey, it's always the right time to do the wrong thing

Any day or night time
It's always the right time
It's always the right time to do the wrong thing
If you're looking for a good time
You and me will get on just fine
It's always the right time to do the wrong thing
If you're looking for trouble
Honey, I can show you how
We don't have to worry
My favorite time of day is right now

Any day or night time
It's always the right time
It's always the right time to do the wrong thing
If you're looking for a good time
You and me will get on just fine
It's always the right time to do the wrong thing
Any day or night time
It's always the right time
It's always the right time to do the wrong thing
If you're looking for a good time
You and me will get on just fine
