Well I heard tell of a woman out there
With tight blue jeans and long black hair
She'll come to play but she won't stay
And it always brings 'em down
Some folks say there will come a day
When she'll settle in some old town
But as best you know this long, long road
She ain't gonna come around

Sixty thousand miles of blacktop
Countless broken hearts between
Winding lines of white that don't stop
Living the life of the highway queen
She's a siren, leaves you pining
Haunts your mind like a melody
If you can tie her down, you can bottle lightning
But the highway queen don't need no king

Well one or two, they might have broken through
They might have nearly roped her in
But a fire like that is far too hot
It's gonna burn and burn again
Seasons fade and so does the pain
It blows away like a like a tumbleweed
You can't blame the girl for loving this old world
She can't help it she's a highway queen
You might also like
Sixty thousand miles of blacktop
Countless broken hearts between
Winding lines of white that don't stop
Living the life of the highway queen
She's a siren, leaves you pining
Haunts your mind like a melody
If you can tie her down, you can bottle lightning
But the highway queen don't need no king

Well miles and miles she keeps on rolling
Place your bets if you ain't folding
Miles and miles, no sign of slowing
It ain't who she loves, it's who she's holding

Sixty thousand miles of blacktop
Countless broken hearts between
Winding lines of white that don't stop
Living the life of the highway queen
She's a siren, leaves you pining
Haunts your mind like a melody
If you can tie her down, you can bottle lightning
But the highway queen don't need no king
Highway queen don't need no king
Highway queen don't need no king
Well miles and miles she keeps on rolling
Place your bets if you ain't folding
Miles and miles, no sign of slowing
