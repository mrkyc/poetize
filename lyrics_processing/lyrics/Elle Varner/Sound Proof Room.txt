I, Try to be strong
Try to turn down the desire I been hiding for so long
Don't wanna play, the innocent game
Like I don't have animal ways
Just like you
I wanna do something we ain't suppose to
Its hard to resist
When most of my day is spent dreaming of your kiss
Can you imagine, what would happen
If we give in this magnetic attraction
Baby you should know
That if I ever get you alone
(Chorus)
Me and you
Me and you
Boy we're gonna need a soundproof room
Me and you
Me and you
Boy we're gonna need a soundproof room
Oowwww Oowwww (Soundproof Room) Oowwww
Boy we're gonna need a soundproof room

I'm, surely a lady
But I'm not a stranger to badly behaving sometimes
Crossing the line
Doing what I know is wrong cause it feels so right
Sneaking away
For something extracurricular on a lunch break
With that being said
I'm ready to try what's been playing inside of my head
Want you to demonstrate your physical advantage
Am I sounding like a savage
I'm not a quitter, I won't give up til I get it
Baby I just gotta have it
(Chorus)
Me and you
Me and you
Boy we're gonna need a soundproof room
Me and you
Me and you
Boy we're gonna need a soundproof room
Oowwww Oowwww (Soundproof Room) Oowwww
Boy we're gonna need a soundproof room
(Hook:)
I never usually
Say such crazy things
I can't control myself
What have you done to me
But more importantly
What am I gonna do to ya
(Chorus)
Me and you
Me and you
If I get you in a soundproof room
Me and you
Me and you
Oh if I get you in a soundproof room
Hey yeah, I wanna get ya in a sound proof room
I wanna get ya in a sound proof wow oh oh
