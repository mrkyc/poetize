With a joyless smile in her own sad world
Walking nowhere all alone without a sense of time
On a cold dark street on a cold dark night, sayin'
This will be the last time
Im through with letting you keep me on sideline
They say insanity is doing all the same things
And thinking that you're gonna get a different ending
Cause I've been waiting in the storm for you
Freezing in the cold blowing wind
Can't tell my tears from the rain drops
I've been praying for a little bit of light
Listening for your love all night
With nothing but the sound of my wrist watch
Stop the clock, stop the clock
Never again, never again, never
Never again, never again, never
I can't wait to hear what your excuse is now
You're a professional two timing clown
I can only blame myself I let you bring me down
To a place in hell where I couldn't find a way out
'Til I saw the real you
Your smoking mirrors blinding me from the real truth
And though I'm never getting back the years I wasted
I got forever to never see you again
Cause I've been waiting in the storm for you
Freezing in the cold blowing wind
Can't tell my tears from the rain drops
I've been praying for a little bit of light
Listening for your love all night
With nothing but the sound of my wrist watch
Going toc-tick-tock-tick-tock-tick-tock-tick-tick-tock
Stop the clock, stop the clock
Never again, never again, never
Never again, never again, never
Stop the clock, stop the clock
Never again, never again, never
Backing it up, gonna find better weather
Cause I've been waiting in the storm for you
Freezing in the cold blowing wind
Can't tell my tears from the rain drops
I've been praying for a little bit of light
Listening for your love all night
With nothing but the sound of my wrist watch
Going tick-tock-tick-tock-tick-tock-tick-tock
