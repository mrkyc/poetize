I don't wanna be your homie
I don't wanna be the chick you call three in the morning
Late night creep, I'm asleep, you're drunk and horny
Wasting my time and you ain't got nothing for me
You ain't got nothing for me

Don't want that kinda love
Don't want that kinda love, no no
Don't want that kinda love
Don't want that kinda love, no no
Don't want that kinda love
Don't want that kinda love, no no
Don't want that kinda love
Don't want that kinda love, no no

See, I'm so good on that kinda love, woah
See, I'm so good on that kinda love, woah
See, I'm so good on that kinda love
See, I'm so good, ayy

Now, I ain't saying nothing crazy
It ain't that deep, it's not that complicated
I just want good loving and some conversation
If you ask me, that's quite a combination
And I want that elevation, oh oh
You might also like
Don't want that kinda love
Don't want that kinda love, no no
Don't want that kinda love
Don't want that kinda love, no no
Don't want that kinda love
Don't want that kinda love, no no
Don't want that kinda love
Don't want that kinda love, no no

See, I'm so good on that kinda love, woah
That maybe that sometimes that playing come alive
Just miss me (See, I'm so good)
Just miss me with that kinda love
(See, I'm so good on that kinda love)
Love, love, love
(See, I'm so good on that kinda love)
(See, I'm so good on that kinda love)
Ooh, I want that kinda love
(See, I'm so good on that kinda love)
Baby, I want that kinda love
(See, I'm so good on that kinda love)
(See, I'm so good)

Oh, I don't want that kinda love
Don't need that kinda love
Please just miss that kinda love
I don't want that kinda love
Can't feel that kinda love
