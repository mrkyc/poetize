My clothes are on, my makeup's smeared
I'm looking crazy
Got numbers on my head,
I'm such a freaky lady
My mouth is dry
I'm feeling kinda grimy,
Cause a got this hangover to remind me
(Chorus)
Oh what a night, Oh what a night
Straight shots of patron
And a slice of lime
Done got myself too drunk to drive
Oh what a night
I left my car, parked at the club
Woke up in the morning can't find my truck
I barely made it home alive
Oh what a night
(Verse 2: Elle Varner)
My roommate says I bought the club a round on my tab
And I was so far gone she had to call me a cab
But I won't let nobody tell me nothing
Cause all in all, I had that party bumping
You might also like(Chorus)
Oh what a night, Oh what a night
Straight shots of patron
And a slice of lime
Done got myself too drunk to drive
Oh what a night
I left my car, parked at the club
Woke up in the morning can't find my truck
I barely made it home alive
Oh what a night
(Verse 3: Elle Varner)
Maybe I was tripping, just a little
Who am I kidding
Hanging with the boys to long
And I quit sipping
Look at me buying bottles
It's for my team, I don't do it for the models shit
I still remember hanging at the bar
Hoping I can get a drink or two from a player or a star
But now, I got mo money than the ballers
I'll take your number
But i'll probably never call ya
Cause, Baby I'm a little bit buzzed
But, right now you look good in this club
But it can be a whole other side
If they turn on the lights
If they turn on the lights
(Chorus)
Oh what a night, Oh what a night
Straight shots of patron
And a slice of lime
Done got myself too drunk to drive
Oh what a night
I left my car, parked at the club
Woke up in the morning can't find my truck
I barely made it home alive
Oh what a night
(Outro)
I hate be a quitter
But I'm thinking bout' my liver
And the liquor that I giver her
It's go kill me even quicker
And I'm already a natural disaster
Don't need nothing to be taking me no faster
Yea I really gotta go and see my pastor
