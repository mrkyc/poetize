When I look down at my chest
Oh yes, my chest it might as well be nonexistent
How can I ever compete With 34 double D's?
And I'm rollin my eyes
When I look down at my thighs
They might as well tape everything that I eat
To my legs
I am too broke for the knife
Too lazy to excercise
But if I had hazel eyes
Maybe I could be fly
If I had no cellulite
Big breasts and pockets real wide
Then maybe I
Maybe I, I
I could be so fly
And if I had a small waist
I'd make the boys go insane
And maybe I
Maybe I, I
I could be so fly
So fly

I've got a beautiful soul
But only 4 people know
They've known me since I was 10
Beauty did not matter then
Now in my twenties all that matters
Is sex cars and money
I ain't got none of the three
So basically, I am invisible to all of the fellas
And I sit at home jealous
There was no golden ticket
In my chocolate today
And worst of all
I'm reminded in the cruelest ways
Of how I don't look and I should look
And that's why I say...
If I had no cellulite
Big breasts and pockets real wide
Then maybe I
Maybe I, I
I could be so fly
And if I had a small waist
I'd make the boys go insane
And maybe I
Maybe I, I
I could be so fly
So fly 
So basically all I need
Is to be everything but me
Colored contacts
Liposuction
And breast implants
Somehow that don't make much sense
I must be out of my head
If I think, that I am governed by material things
So I decided I'm
The definition of fly
And if you want to know why
I know what money can't buy
Don't go believing the hype
There's no runway in the sky
And no way you could be fly
Not if it costs you a dime
If I had no cellulite
Big breasts and pockets real wide
Then maybe I
Maybe I, I, I
I could be so fly
If I had no cellulite
The boys go insane
And maybe I
Maybe I, I
