I'm staring at him
But I forget to pick my face up off the floor, ooooh
We're in a crowd, but it feels like we're alone, ooooh
Oh my god he just looked at me
And I just wanna tell him something that he's never heard, oooh
But my lips won't let me tell him, tell him
I would say this

But maybe, maybe in another life
I could be the girl who walks up to the guy
And tells him, tells him how she feels inside
But, not tonight, no not tonight

What if he walks towards me
While all the blood is rushing right to my brain
What am I gonna say, what am I gonna say
I may stop breathing and freeze cuz
That's the story of my life
Wouldn't it be crazy
If he felt, how I felt, overwhelmed and terrified
But he took my hand
And he took his chance, can I have this dance
If only we were in a Cinderella story
You might also like
Maybe, maybe in another life
I could be the girl who walks up to the guy
And tells him, tells him how she feels inside
But not tonight, tonight

Who would I be
To make my feelings known
I need a little audacity but it's not in my bones
I'm standing here, terrified
Broken hearted, I could die, ooooohh
I'm staring at him
But I forget to pick my face up off the floor
I feel like a fool
And even though I do
I only wanna tell him that I love him more, more

Maybe, maybe in another life
I would be the girl who walks up to the guy
And say hey my name is Elle
And I think you're kinda fly
But not tonight, not tonight, tonight

Maybe, maybe in another life
I would be the girl who walks up to the guy
And tells him, tells him how she feels inside
But not tonight, not tonight
Maybe
