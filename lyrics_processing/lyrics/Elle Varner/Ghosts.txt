My oh my what a G-U-Y
Got me in trouble like a D-U-I
Brain cells booked themselves a flight
Senseless since you caught my eye
Think this one's my last lover
She says, "You can't fool me I'm your mother"
Apple don't fall far from the tree
Take it from me
Baby girl you're a runner
I swear it's a curse
Cause I meet so many men
And I never find the one in the city of Japan
Sucks so bad cause I really wish I wasn't in a rush but I am
If I just took a minute to be honest with myself
I will find I wasn't really ready cause I'm not
It's all a silly game and I'm only talking to the same boy cause he's hot

I don't wanna fall in love, I don't wanna fall in love
I don't wanna be the pretty girl
Carrying my mommy lump
I don't wanna be in love, I don't wanna be in love
I just wanna be invisible
Like a ghost in a living room

Three weeks into a new romance
And I'm already making all kind of plans
With a new guy
That I met on a flight from Detroit, I
Think he's more my type
Oh mama I'm so terrified
Restless spirit gone eat me alive
I don't know why I always find
A reason to be out like a power line
I swear it's a curse cause I meet so men
And I never find the one in Miami or L.A
Don't know where they hide
I've been searching high and low
Like it's going out of style
But if I just took a minute to be honest with myself
I would find I wasn't really ready cause I'm not
I stay breaking hearts
I could really use a minute to myself for a change

I don't wanna fall in love, I don't wanna fall in love
Think I'm running out of battery
I'mma need a charger
Right now I'm the low, right now I'm on the low
I just wanna be invisible
Like a ghost in a living room
Agony is my old best friend
But if I knew what I know back then
I never would have booked that plane to Spain all by myself
Would have needed someone else
On my peaceful lonely nights
Think I've been fooling myself
When it's all gonna be alright?
So I'mma put me first cause I never really do
And it really is a shame cause I work so hard
And I waste so much energy
And I only have me to blame
It's about that time to be off my phone
If you have business with me
You'll have my business email
If you don't I'mma catch you on the flip side

I ain't going to the club, I ain't going to the club
I'll be chilling in my living room
Like a ghost invisible
I'm chilling on love, I'm chilling on love
I'mma see you in another room
