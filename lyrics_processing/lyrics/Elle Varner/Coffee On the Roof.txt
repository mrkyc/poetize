Feelings (Yeah)
Feelings (I'm so conflicted)
Feelings
I was supposed to spend the night and
Leave in the middle of the back dead
That's what we mutually decided
That's love or something else ignited
I woke up and you were snoring
You made me reckless in the morning
We drank coffee on your roof
And what a view, but can't see clearly 'cause I'm
Catching feelings, catching feelings
Throw me off of the roof
Catching feelings, catching feelings for you
Catching feelings that I'm barely feeling, but it's true
Catching feelings for you
Ooh, catching feelings, catching feelings
Catching feelings
You were supposed to call me back long
Before you showed up at the party
Did not plan on seeing you there
So I acted like I don't care
Now I'm dancing with a stranger
I'm plannin' on giving in to danger
All because of you
All because I'm catching feelings, I'm catching feelings for you
Catching feelings, catching feelings, oh
Catching feelings, catching feelings

'Cause I'm catching feelings, I'm catching feelings
I'm barely feeling, it's true
I'm catching feelings for you
Catching feelings
Catching feelings
I'm catching feelings
I am barely feeling
Catching feelings
Feelings, oh (Feelings), oh (Feelings)
Catchin' 'em, catchin' 'em, catchin' 'em
Catchin' 'em, catchin' 'em, catchin' 'em, catchin' 'em feelings
Catchin' 'em, catchin' 'em, catchin' 'em, catchin' 'em, catchin' 'em
Catchin' 'em, catchin' 'em, catchin' 'em feelings
Feelings
The feelings, the feelings, you know I'm catching them feelings (Feelings)
The feeling, the feeling
The feeling, the feeling, the feeling, the feeling
When you touch me, I get this feeling all over my body, yeah
Oh, I wanna think about you and me in the future
In the summertime, in the fall, in the winter
What you doing around Christmas time?
Do you wanna be my mom and dad?
Do you wanna go out to the movies and hold hands? Oh
