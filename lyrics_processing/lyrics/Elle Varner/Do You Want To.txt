I know all about it
We've been down this road and back more times than I can count and
It's a far far cry from sun kissed sunday mornings
When you wake up and you just can't release the head your holding
And you say this car isn't driving like it used to
Why do
You stay if you're really leaving what's in your way

Baby
Baby do you really wanna walk away now?
(do you want to)
These doors are openin wide if you want to
(if you want to)
I can't be holding you back
If you want to
Do you want to

Have you pack your bag ?
Or is this smoke you're blowing ?
I once was scared of losing you
Now I know where you're going
Its the same routine
I know all about it
You're sure you're gun and
Yet you never pull the trigger on it
You say this car isnt driving like it used to
Why do
You stay if you're really leaving what's in your way

Baby do you really wanna walk away now?
(do you want to)
These doors are openin wide if you want to
(if you want to)
I can't be holding you back
If you want to
Do you want to

I'll stand by you humble tried and true
Nevertheless prepared to say goodbye
Baby I'm not scared
I want you to know I love you more than my impatience tends to steal the show
Honey I'm just waiting
I could be wrong but I'm predictin that you're stayin
Baby do you really wanna walk away now?
(do you want to)
These doors are openin wide if you want to
(if you want to)
I can't be holding you back
If you want to
If you want to
Baby baby
Do you really wanna walk away now?
Do you reall wanna walk away now?
