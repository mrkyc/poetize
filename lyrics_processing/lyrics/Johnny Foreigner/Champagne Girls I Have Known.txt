The first dreamt of butterfly tattoos that curled from her hair
And flew around her belly
While the second wrote this awkward poetry
10 lines, 6 fonts, 4 colours
And all I remember is, "Love is all I have to give"
We're like, love (love) and (and) train (train) fare (fare)
We made monsters, but monsters scare you
We prayed for days, but the conscience never came
We made zombies, but zombies never
Stare each other out in the sanctuary outside of town
Mutton dressed as mutton dressed as mutton dressed as lamb
Mutton (dressed as) mutton (dressed as) mutton (dressed as)
A nearly (dressed as) wasted (dressed as) call from (dressed as) Birmingham (dressed as)
Mutton, mutton, mutton dressed as...
And Brittany says, "I don't get drunk, but if I did, I'd get smashed and head for library"
Well I do drink, and I've done that, and I still owe them money
And how the champagne girls sit on the stands and look out to the crowd
And nothing is wasted, or comprimised
Champagne girls will get you in
Its like, love (love) and (and) train (train) fare (fare)
We made monsters, but monsters scare you
We prayed for days, but the conscience never came
We made zombies, but zombies never
Stare each other out in the sanctuary outside of town
