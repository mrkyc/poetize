There were no female pirates
Your friends are dressed like whores
And there's competitions to see what you're winning
We got short skirts and yo ho ho!
We'll take, take, take it in turns to get angry
Bury each other where we once balanced each other
I will wait, wait, wait for the moment to grab me
I remember sometimes I would walk to your bus stop
And it wouldn't change a thing

I can feel the doubt still lingering, I can feel my cheap heartbeat
We got three good clubs in the heart of the city
I'll only get precious singing about your day
I'd barely call this singing

And I'm a lost ghost stalking out grammar school corridors
(Oh, you'll never, oh, oh you'll never)
Like the worst kind of habit, how you're only gonna get ignored
(Oh, you'll never, oh, oh you'll never)
If I'm a car crash, then you're a car crash too
(Oh, you'll never, oh, oh you'll never)
Like the worst kind of habit, how they're watching while we're at it
Oh, you'll never, oh, oh you'll never
Oh, you'll never, oh, oh you'll never
Oh, oh you'll never, oh, oh you'll never
You might also like
And you can stop any time you wanted to
You can stop any time you wanted to
Take your hands off her and walk out of the room
With your dignity intact
We'll take, take, take it in turns to get angry
There's nothing like fighting battles lost
I will wait, wait, wait for the moment to grab me
I remember sometimes I would walk to your bus stop
And it wouldn't change a thing

You can stop any time you wanted to
I vomit desire, I sweat desire
We got three good clubs in the heart of the city
I'll only get precious singing about your day
I'd barely call this singing

And I'm a lost cause haunting out nightclub corridors
(Oh, you'll never, oh, oh you'll never)
Like the worst kind of habit, how you're only gonna get ignored
(Oh, you'll never, oh, oh you'll never)
If I'm a car crash, then you're a car crash too
(Oh, you'll never, oh, oh you'll never)
The worst kind of habit, kept the bodies in the attic
(Oh, you'll never, oh, oh you'll never)
