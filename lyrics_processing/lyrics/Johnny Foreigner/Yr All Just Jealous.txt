Hot girls know the words to our songs
And I'm terrified of what comes next
You got stars on your hips, you got scars on your wrists
And I'm wondering which you got done first

We three ghosts, simple and shallow
Three shots and we're transparent
And in the last dream I remember
We were dancing in the headlights
On the streets where I used to live (It's sudden life)

Bad summers, it's half the answer; halve the pressure
No sleep, no sleep!
But you've gotta move quick, yeah
We got taxis, we got people waiting

Hot girls know the words to our songs
And I'm terrified of what comes next
You got stars on your hips, you got scars on your wrists
And I'm wondering which you got done first

We three ghosts, swap hats like junkies share needles
Trade cities to fields and curses for verses
And on the last night I remember
We were dancing in the strobe lights
To the songs that we used to own (It's sudden life)
You might also like
Bad credit, it's half the answer, halve the summer
No sleep, no sleep!
But you've gotta move quick, yeah
We got taxis, we got people waiting

Don't call us in the morning, I won't call you at all
He's got a glass in his hand and ice in his heart
He almost looks guilty like you're taking a part
And a smile that says, "Yeah, you knew"
And now decisions are made, how the promises slain
And the parents are blamed and your tickets are paid

(Couldn't not go, couldn't not go, couldn't not go
Couldn't not go, couldn't not go, couldn't not go
Couldn't not go, couldn't not go, couldn't not go
Couldn't not go, couldn't not go, couldn't not go)
One by one will move away for friends or university
One by one fulfils a plan and leaves three ghosts in Birmingham
