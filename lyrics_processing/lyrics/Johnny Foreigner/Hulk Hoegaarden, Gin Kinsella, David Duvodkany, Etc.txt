Won't you take me back to Texas, where the parking lots are homes?
Won't you take me back to Texas, where it's warm?

Do you remember the edges of october
Sofa surfing 'til we made the flight?
The sum of our hangovers laid out before us
Stretched to where the desert touches sky

In flashes of sleep deprivation
An autumn collapsed and the border's convinced
But I swear I've never been so far from home

For everyone whose names we lost or were too drunk or tired to ask
Oh dispossessed house-guest
We ghosted the midwest
And settled where the desert touches sky

In flashes of sleep deprivation
An autumn collapsed and the border's convinced
But I swear I've never been so far from home
(I've never)
But I swear I've never been so far from home
I swear I've never been
You might also like
It's a milestone I'm sure
With the parents screaming murder in the hall
The morning spraying shadows on the lawn
The colour Kodak new
Is this magic, is this heaven for you?

And you think
The world's just going to fall into your arms
Like so many free drinks bought by strangers in strange bars
(I could go on)
Well if you faked your way this far
Then compromise seems... uh, uh, uh, unromantic
(I could go on)
Clutching last year's festival wristbands like medals from a war you think you think you fought
Well honey, you could cut diamonds on those lips, and that dress has sure stayed pristine
But you still lost
(I could go on, I could go on, I could go on!)
Hanging branches off your stories
And it's not like I don't think they're true
But they've all got the same plot
You get the badges, you get the booze, then you get the boys
(I could go on)
Johnny foreigner; The Mandy Morbid of indie rock
Never got the cash for flights but we've sure seen a lot of cock
Put money shots on our blogs and hope to god we're still hot
'Cause between you, and us, and her?
