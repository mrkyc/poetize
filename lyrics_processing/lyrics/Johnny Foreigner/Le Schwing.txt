She never picks up on the first ring
She leaves me hanging at the station with the tourists and the touts
And I light another cigarette and I wait with my doubts
And my doubts are all I have as the summer burns the parks
And I'm scratching for an answer cause I know she's going to ask
About the future that we're failing, and how we start a fire from a spark
And I'd tell her that my songs are just the stories of our lives
And the endings are unfinished and not everyone survives
But how I only sing the truth, and that's something only she gets to decide

And I hope you lied
I hope you shrugged and rolled your eyes and thought of all those other guys
Who promised love and gave it up
You'd never trust and never touch another life
If you believed them all
Slutever and ever, oh man
And we can talk about it

If I was honest I'd have ended me in Tokyo
And maybe that was cheap or maybe I'm just better than that
I'm calling it a chorus, singing "never going back"

Ended up in Washington, and got our shit stolen
I guess the moral of the story, is always take your wallet on the stage
And everyone is actors simply bouncing off each other
And our capitals are theatres and all your friends play lover
So I'd ask you as whatever, tell me that our script can be saved!

And I hope you lied
I hope you shrugged and rolled your eyes and thought of all those other guys
Who promised love and gave it up
You'd never trust and never touch another life
If you believed them all
Slutever and ever, oh man
And it's on
And it's off
And it's on
And it's off
Yeah it's off
No, it's on
No, it's off
Yeah, it's on!

And I hope you lied
I hope you shrugged and rolled your eyes and thought of all those other guys
Who promised love and gave it up
You'd never trust and never touch another life
If you believed them all
Slutever and ever, oh man
