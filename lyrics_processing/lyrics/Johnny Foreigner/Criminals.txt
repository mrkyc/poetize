We mapped out our futures as clouds drew around us
Our atlas embraces our guts like romantics
We never expected the end so soon
(Ah)
With the cold dead eyes of ex-Ramshackle DJs
Falling off the plane like I'm sorry how you missed the parade
(Drifted apart, drifted apart)
Picking through the rubble with the ghosts of the Astoria
(So leave the wrecking ball)
Let the bodies in the club match the bodies in the ground
Say NEVER. NEVER!
Misplaced confidence
These boys are only adults
It's happy hour for the wallflowers
Where do I stand?
Misplaced confidence
These rooms will always be so dumb
Happy hour for the wallflowers
So yr town's run by criminals
Closed yr clubs and sold you out, for what?
Yr town's run by criminals
They sold you out, they sold you out
Yr town's run by criminals
Sold you out and closed yr clubs, for what?
Yr town's run by criminals
You're almost all, you're almost all that's left
You might also like(Ah)
There's so many sharks that some are about to fall together
Shooting from the roof while the record starts to crump away
(Drifted apart, drifted apart)
Saving up yr time, saving yr sick days for something
(So let this mask lie)
Let the length of the queue, let the length of yr skirt say NEVER. NEVER!
Misplaced confidence
These boys are only adults
It's happy hour for the wallflowers
Where do I stand?
Misplaced confidence
These rooms will always be so dumb
Happy hour for the wallflowers
So yr town's run by criminals
Closed yr clubs and sold you out, for what?
Yr town's run by criminals
They sold you out, they sold you out
Yr town's run by criminals
Sold you out and closed yr clubs, for what?
Yr town's run by criminals
You're almost all, you're almost all that's left
I wish cameras
Could capture this
Yr town's run by criminals
Closed yr clubs and sold you out, for what?
Yr town's run by criminals
They sold you out, they sold you out
Yr town's run by criminals
Sold you out and closed yr clubs, for what?
Yr town's run by criminals
