I can't lose you in crowded rooms
But this year, we're not linking arms
Slow walk out of the barfly, cold air and taxis
And I'm biting my lip 'cause I know why we're dragged here
If you think this is primitive
I can dye my hair and you can call me Tracey, Tracey
Just me and her and a Casio

I got a plan, new maps every day
I have found a happy obsession
I might be drunk but at least I'm standing up
And in this place, gestures are all we've got

Like I will wait for you outside carparks
Outside busy shopping centres
I will wait for you at work when all your early shifts run late
And sometimes in the Bullring and always when you're sleeping
I will look at your hands and think
I could never, never explain what you had

How some of us just don't quit
Crossing the same lines since 1999
How it's not hard to break your heart
Sings Jeff Buckley across the bar
Six years shame for what you are
Feel no shame in what you are
Just me and her and a Casio
You might also like
I got a plan, new maps every day
I have found a happy obsession
I might be drunk but at least I'm standing up
And in this place, gestures are all we've got

Like I will wait for you outside carparks
Outside busy shopping centres
I will wait for you at work when all your early shifts run late
And sometimes in the Bullring and always when you're sleeping
I will look at your hands and think
I could never, never explain what you had

I might be drunk but at least I'm standing up
And in this place, gestures are all we've got
I might be drunk but at least I'm standing up
And it's more than I can say for you


Just me and her and a Casio
Just me and her and a Casio
Just me and her and a Casio
I got a plan, new maps every day
I have found a happy obsession
I might be drunk but at least I'm standing up
And in this place, gestures are all we've got

Like I will wait for you outside carparks
Outside busy shopping centres
I will wait for you at work when all your early shifts run late
And sometimes in the Bullring and always when you're sleeping
I will look at your hands and think
