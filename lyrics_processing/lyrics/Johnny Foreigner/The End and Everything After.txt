I guess the bar staff see this every night
They're turning tables putting candles out, careless and tired
And all your dramas are un-started
Came for the money, stayed for the community
And now the funds are tight, and now we chose our sides
We make the same mistakes our friends might
We're floating streamers down off balconies
Scattered arcs across the city, makes a new body cold

How you don't stop believing in the band
Because the band stopped believing in the band
Careless hands and one night stands
Where everything stands, we were made of plans

Backdrops set to falling stars
Does not describe what you are
And God knows what you think of us
I'm losing ground to future ghosts
I know that we're good and I know that I'm close
But God knows what you think of us

Now we sleep crooked if we sleep at all
We squeeze our bodies into spaces where the spaces are filled
Your blisters from our shattered
Arcs across the city make a new body
And now the pressures on and I still sleep alone
We barely notice when our friends are gone
We're sharing cigarettes to pass the time
Coward dazed by the money, trapped by community
You might also like
How you don't stop believing in the band
Because the band stopped believing in the band
Careless hands and one night stands
Where everything stands, we were made of plans

Backdrops set to falling stars
Does not describe what you are
And God knows what you think of us
I'm losing ground to future ghosts
I know that I'm good, I know that I'm close
But God knows what you think of us

Last hit for sure
Once was enough
Oh careless hands we were made of plans
Fake reports of faulty heart does not describe what you were and god knows what you'd think of us
