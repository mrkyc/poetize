We've been watching the boats and we're sure they know something we don't
How the bar staff talk of magic, something greater and romantic
And the cab drivers swear as the lightning splits at the sky
And all our friends are tour guides
We cut deals with the natives
Yes, yes, me and her I guess we're kinda the same
(So face the efforts of ?)
Both fell out of grace and afterparty shame
We get gracious when we can
(Gracious hospitality)
Let's talk about taxis
(We talked about taxis, we talked about coming back)
Who's watching the coast?
Who's watching the coast?
Who's watching the coast, and who's watching you?
We should have stayed in touch
For when we ran out of luck
We should have stayed in touch
There is a storm over St. Lucia
The streets are still warm but the spotlights are baiting the clouds
Oh, the air's cool in this taxi
I let the city-stain slide past me
3 hours sleep and we talk about going home

Drowned our losses with inheritance claims
(Drown our losses)
Now we're less careless where we stand
(Less careless where we stand)
Explicit examples to use up yr life while you can
Who's watching the coast?
Who's watching the coast?
Who's watching the coast, and who's watching you?
We should have stayed in touch
For when we ran out of luck
We should have stayed in touch
