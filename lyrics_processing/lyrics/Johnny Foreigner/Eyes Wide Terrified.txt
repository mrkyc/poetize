Pulling down the blinds blocks what's left of the stars
So I'm tripping over bottles, tracing footsteps in the dark
Tomorrow would be a good day for broken glass
There are men in this room who would pay for this
Missed calls to say I missed the morning's most

You can't talk about it, you can't talk about it
Keeping (we) secrets, (we) playing (can't talk about it) witches
Our bodies stretched out, our bodies stretched out
Casting sudden spells is not the answer
We'll build ourselves on hope and progress
Awake at water's edge, your eyes wide terrified
We'll build ourselves on hope and fortune
I wouldn't say, wouldn't say it to your face, I'm sure

Your life is a song, your life is a song
Your life is a song, but not this one (Sure!)
Your life is a song, your life is a song
Your life is a song, but not this one

It talks about confidence, I'll give it a month if I'm lucky
I'm not that lucky, and these t-shirts don't fold themselves
But he falls asleep on her shoulder
Every shift they spend together, which is most nights
You might also like
You can't talk about it, you can't talk about it
Keeping (we) secrets, (we) playing (can't talk about it) witches
Your bodies stretched out, our bodies stretched out
Casting sudden spells is not the answer
We'll build ourselves on hope and progress
Awake at water's edge, my eyes wide terrified
We'll build ourselves on hope and something
I wouldn't say, wouldn't say it to your face, I'm sure

Your life is a song, your life is a song
Your life is a song, but not this one (Sure!)
Your life is a song, your life is a song
Your life is a song, but not this one

It talks about confidence, I'll give it a month if I'm lucky
Your jealous friends have got to get laid
The only thing that's stopping you is more of the same
Yeah, you get it, you feel it, emotions, attention

Your life is a song, your life is a song
Your life is a song, but not this one
Your life is a song, your life is a song
Your life is a song, but not this one
Your life is a song, your life is a song
Your life is a song, but not this one
Your life is a song, your life is a song
