Where are the children we lost not long ago
Feel for the mothers who weep for them
I pray for the fathers who are standing by their side
In their world of pain and suffering
Have you ever seen the look in a hungry child's eyes?
They can't eat money or promises
Give them your smile, try holding out your hand
Let them know you're there, let them know you're there

Why is it always the ones that we love
Are the ones that will never come home?
Why must all of the bridges we cross take their toll?
Always remember the voice in your head
Speaks to you when you're alone
And it comforts you
From the top of your heart
To the bottom of your soul

You can swim in a river of tears they cry
For they sleep on the winds of uncertainty
Show us a sign and make us believe again
There's no other way, oh, there's no other way
