Willie D, what a fuck you gotta say?

Chika pow, chicka pow, chicka pow-pow-pow
Buckle up, buckle up right now
Sixteen rounds coming atcha
And I betcha, at least one of you hoes will need a stretcher
Break `em down, break `em down, break `em down, break `em down
Niggas in my clique don`t fuck around
And we bound to do something vicious
Diss us and even your bitches will need stitches
Bang-bang, that`s my thang, homeboy
Punk, so what you want with Willie D, homeboy
Better be more peace than a little bit
Cause your ass will get smoked like a cigarette
(Where they at?
Where they at?
Where they at?)

Blaow-blow, what a motherfucking peace this
Oh, what a relief it is

Icy Hott what a fuck you gotta say?

Me gun go pow-pow-pow, boom-boom, ripping the meat out their chest
You must not know how to wear a motherfucking bulletproof vest
Smack on a man who come to rescue you
And if the cops come early, they be backed off too
You shouldn`t have fucked with Icy, you had to aggravate a rockstar
Just as quick as my tongue can move, my bob and weave is faster
In military breaking them jaws every day
Pass de Piote` like we used to say

Racer X, what a fuck you gotta say?

Caught niggas getting reckless, acting skanless, taking chances
Getting their ass dropped to the fucking canvas
So what you think about a nigga now, nigga?
Kow-pow, nigga, kow-pow, nigga, pow, nigga
A couple mints of a razor, that`s how I mase ya
Make no mistakes, buckshots in your face
I`m bobing and weaving and sticking up, moving a nigga, I hook it
I jib and jab, I shook, I got a clique for that hoe shit, trick
Pass de Piote` like we used to say, hey
Pass de Piote` like we used to say, hey

Yo, Sho, what a fuck you gotta say?

Catch a square, fool and a nigga gonna square off
Blow to your chest then your head and try to tear it off
But you don`t really want to rump
Cause i`m possessing a pump that will make a fucking cold stump
If I`m caught in that mix, a nigga got a clique
Pop that bullshit, your ass is headed to a ditch
(Fuck with my piote` and your face get fucked
Get wrecked off  this spliff inside this big-ass truck)

They coming non-stop
They are coming drop on a rock, bow!
