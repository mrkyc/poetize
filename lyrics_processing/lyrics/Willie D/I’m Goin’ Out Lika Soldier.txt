He was arrested on numerous and varied charges of income tax evasion
No feasible means of support
Hustling, pimping, running dope
Narcotics in his possession
Assault and battery
Assault on a police officer and resistance
He's gonna divorce you without giving you a cent
Well, that no-good son of a bitch
What do you have to say about all these charges?

Born, born, born, born, born, born killer
I'm that motherfuckin' goddamn nigga
The brother that's tougher than any other you cover
The one you don't wanna take home to your mother
Fuck a loose screw, let me enlighten
I got a whole motherfuckin' toolbox need tightenin'
Fast like lightning, punch like Tyson
A clash of the titans when I start fighting
So what's a goddamn reporter?
A nigga with a foot in his ass and a tape recorder
Dissing W-I-double-L-I-E-D
And don't know shit about me
But you don't see me running
I'm from the ghetto, ho, so I keep coming
With more nerves, more verbs, more cuss words
To fuck with the suburbs
You can't stand me or can me
Bullets gon' go through people if you ban me
'Cause you're fucking with my livelihood
For your health, that ain't no good
Like Breed, I'm twenty below and getting colder
Goin' out like a soldier
You might also like
Crisp and clean, I'm leaving the scene
Blowing motherfuckers to smithereens
And if I fall, you know they didn't pimp me
'Cause the banana clip will be empty
You say, "Willie, clean up your act
And maybe you can sell more records than that"
Survival comes before principles and morals
So to the man in the street, I'ma stay loyal
And fuck up those who oppose
Outta there smelling like a rose
You ain't never seen a motherfucker kill a motherfucker
Like a motherfucker named Willie D, motherfucker
Rambo can't go
And Robocop'll get dropped like a ho
By something that he never saw
An M-72A to motherfuckin' law
We can rumble in the jungle
Or have a World War III right here on the concrete
Goddamn, I done told ya
(Willie D), goin' out like a soldier

Niggas say I'm crazy
And I'm still ain't kissin' no ass to be accepted
I got somethin' to make them hoes say, "Fuck you, black"
I got somethin' to make them hoes say, "Fuck you, black"
Fuck this, fuck that is my motto
Willie D is fuckin' everybody like a hot ho
So you better put a condom on your ear
'Cause I'm burnin' up the normal shit you hear
Smokin', smokin'
Y'all motherfuckers know I ain't jokin'
I've been payin' my dues for a decade
What time is it? It's time to get paid
Yeah, fuck the bullshit
And that nigga standin' at the damn pulpit
I left Charlie Brown on the cut
'Cause I felt like Snoopy, workin' for peanuts
Now my ass is sore
Yo, and I can't be fucked no more
So if you wanna test me, that'll hold ya
I'm goin' out like a soldier

Willie D, we understand you're not getting along with Bill
You and Scarface recently had a shootout
You left the Geto Boys and started your own record label because of greed
And have sold out your fans
Get this, to record a country-western duo with Garth Brooks?

I'm goin' out like an S-O-L-D-I-E-R
Pumped up for an all-out war
Searchin' like a predator
With an M-16 lookin' for a magazine editor
I know they don't write the columns
But they cosign every volume
So I'm cuttin' off the head of state
So the rest of the body can't operate
And while I'm into the slaughter
I may as well bust a cap on a TV reporter
And a DJ by the way
For givin' that wicky-wack shit radio play
If that's your preference, so be it
But I'ma call it like I motherfuckin' see it
And never be a pop chart trick
Y'all talk loud, but you don't say shit
I'd rather boycott that picture
And rap about that which affects ya
You wonder why the cussin' won't disappear
Goddamn, we ain't happy down here
Willie D got problems
So when mom walk in, turn down the volume
And act like you're doin' your homework
Or get your pussy or your dick knocked in the dirt
There's a vet in your vicinity
So pump up Ice Cube and jam Public Enemy
And let the OG Ice-T kick a rhyme that'll mold ya
