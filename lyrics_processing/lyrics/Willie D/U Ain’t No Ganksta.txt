The big gangster, here he goes
(Gangsta)

Everybody wanna be a gangster
Gather up a posse, a crew and live their life in danger
Get a 40Oz out and roll ace deuce
See a nigga that you don`t like and you shoot
Now you feel important to your homies
Who like you, a bunch of damn phonies
Cause when something go down Willie D can`t find ya
Unless you got an army right behind ya
You ain`t crazy like everybody think
You know who to fuck with and who to not point blank
You might be a motherfucking prankster
But Willie D know, hoe. U Ain`t No Gangsta

Yeah, you punk niggas be flexing cause you think your ass got protection. I don`t buy none of that shit cause i`m next to you, punk!

U Ain`t No Gangsta, punk motherfucker!
You don`t wanna start, punk, cause I will kick your little-bitty ass
Have your shit knocked in and a half
Boy, I roll like an 18-wheeler
From Fifth Ward to Acres Home, you know me, nigga
I know the rumbsta-funksta terminology
Wrong foot set get pummeled from me
Cause if you don`t know the streets, you gonna get picked on
You just might get clicked on
By a bunch of young niggas that`s coming up
And couldn`t give a fuck who they was fucking up
Pays to be a gangster, pays to be
(gangster, gangster)
Pays to be a gangster, pays to be
(gangster, gangster)

U Ain`t No Gangsta, so why you say it in your songs?
Everybody know you used to get chased home
Bitch, you ain`t Fifth Ward hard, you`re a hoe
Leave the ghetto shit to the niggas from the ghetto
I`m sick and tired of you looking mean on your album covers
Number one, it makes me madder than a motherfucker
Number Two, it ain`t nothing but hype
Don`t even know what a motherfucking fight look like
Except when you beat on a female
Still and yet, you ain`t raised no hell
Cause when it comes to a nigga, you can`t get shit
But you look like Tyson when you fighting a bitch
It`s for the gangstas, not your whole damn crew
But the one or two fools who are true
(Gangsta)
You`re five deep with a Blocko
But a true gangsta can roll solo
Like me, even if my posse is unloved
I can still go to a club
Cause motherfuckers know, I get down for my crown
And let my nuts hang to the ground
So while you coming with a simple
I`m fucking up your face like a goddamn pimple
Toe to toe, blow for blow
You`re on the floor, now everybody know
