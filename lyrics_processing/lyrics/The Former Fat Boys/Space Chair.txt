I'm in my space chair
I'm in the atmosphere
And everything so is clear
The whole world is so gorgeous
R&D ridiculous just try to afford this (yeah)
Float out the backyard straight pass the window
She's in her underwear
I tip my hat real slow
This mouse floats on
I captain my ship, yo
Too bad she laughed
Cause now she can't go
I'm in a chair in the atmosphere (uh huh)
I'm in a chair in the atmosphere (what up)
I'm in a chair in the atmosphere (so high)
I'm in a chair in the atmosphere (I fly)
I'm in a chair in the atmosphere (space chair)
I'm in a chair in the atmosphere (space chair)
I'm in a chair in the atmosphere (space chair)
So high
My space chair flies
Popping eyes and mouth drop wide
In my neighborhood as I float by
They said they couldn't reach but I touch the sky
So through this this pack of losers
Cream to the crop like a two-thousand Ludacris
You want to hear it again so you're bound to loop this
Space jam, so you bounce off coopers
You might also likeI hang a left to explore the equator
No onboard bathroom so I crap on haters
With ten times the force of a million Darth Vaders
And the fanboys know that I'm hot like taters
So they all put their hands in the air like waiters
Cause I fly so high that my goddamn brain hurts
I do it for science and a million earth nerds
All space dreamers stuck flipping burgers
I'm on float less
So focused
It's so damn cold in space
No joke kids
Don't try space-chairing at home
I don't need balloon boys clocking my zone
Cockblocking my quest for space-babes
Note to self: no orange ones cause they all got space-AIDS
I.C.O.E, the case I sing
Got a jetpack and a case of fizzy lift drinks
That I stole so sneaky
So if you meet me
Hail the space chair
Don't fail your species
Ah, shit
Shields up
Shields!
