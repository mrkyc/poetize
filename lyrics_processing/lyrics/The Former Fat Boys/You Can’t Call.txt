Please don't call
You can't call
You can't call me anymore
It's always the phone
Just one ringtone
Means she's alone
Another one down
Another one left her
Another wrong chioce
Another wrong left turn
Then its her voice
On the line
Begging to hear mine
Like somehow she doesn't know
I'm not fine
Like somehow she doesn't see me as a boy
I'm just another best friend she'll destroy
Like a toddler breaking its toys
Every time she's down she likes to make noise
That's when she calls

If I were a girl
I'd call I'd call ever guy
That ever listened to me whine
About some guy who repeatedly lied
While I repeatedly cried
And was so blind
Yeah, I'd apologize
Cuz I'd bet some rich dude's Corvette
That every dude in this club had a smurfette
That he knew he'd never get, but he answered every text
Took every call, and would always regret
And every ho sipping that goose and cran
Has got 5 numbers and a master plan
And she'll never be in love with any of them
But as soon as she's needy, she'll call again
So no I guess Ii'm not that tough
I don't care, done being dumb I'm calling your bluff
Cuz when you call I'm messed up
Cuz there's only one of us that's in love
Cuz there's only one that's in love
Cuz there's only one that's not love
Cuz there's only one so I give up
My heart is broken and I've had enough

As sam rosnon plays lindsay's song
While your boyfriend gets his thing on with a cutie in a thong (as the dj bangs this song)
And you wonder why he's gone so long
He was headed to the bathroom hours ago
And you're so smashed out on jack and blow
Acting a ho, so you pull out your phone
And ET me, baby, i ain't your home
You cannot call me cuz your just so sorry
That's life, and i'm so bored of games on these lonely nights
And i just can't pretend to care bout lights and bars and fancy cars
I drive a 97 neon it could be ours
Ac and tape deck
But you see stars
And you even try to call
If you got no bars
Blinded your living so large and giant
True loves in your face you can't find it
You say you need me now i ain't buying it
So leave a voicemail or just be quiet
