Yo, I wake up in the morning
He was A. C
And she was Jessie
And they were all over my TV
He was a pig
She was a bitch
What more can I say?
He called her mama and she acted mad
Did softcore porn to prove she could act
Lisa and Kelly, Screech, Tory, and Zach
Can be found out chilling at the Max
He was a Slater boy
Jessie would get annoyed
He was just too much jock for her
They tried to cloak the max
Slater said "kiss my ass"
And he saved the world with a radio broadcast
At the castle ball Kelly dumped Zach again
They get married at Vegas in the end
Mango and tonic with a kiwi twist
A drink that Lisa cannot resist
You might also likeScreech is a dork but he never quits
Wanted Lisa for violence so he could get
Tory comes in she's quite a badass
She dates Zach
A.C. Slater boy
Jessie would get annoyed
He moves all his ants with Zach
Teamed up to battle chess
They said syringe was the best
But Belding got out of the bet
He was a Slater boy
No one makes on highs
Got drunk and they almost died
And in the trees with Zach
The Zach-attack
And Zach 
J.J. loves the tunes
Come moya public crude
Coda did the drugs
Slater worked on Kelly but Zach couldn't cut
Now the sands of the groceries
On vacation Screech is hit
Misplaced by Mike Rogers door
And class is born
He's just A.C., dating Jessie
Zach has surgery when Belding trips
 and Screech, dating Belding's neice
Chocolate grasshoppers, have a piece!
They're from Afghanistan!
Without the Slater boy, the valley will be destroyed
While Belding seems so mad
He's just a Slater boy and Jessie she gets annoyed
Zach dates a poltergeist and a wheelchair bitch
And Screech forgets that he is a hit
He's just a Slater boy, Screech and Zach
The new school is on its well
Friends, forever
