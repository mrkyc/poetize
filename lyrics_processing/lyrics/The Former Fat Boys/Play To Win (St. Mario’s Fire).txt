Everyone with time to go before they die
You gotta play to win
Get past the boss
Gotta save the princess whatever the cost
Grab that one-up
Win the game
Warp a few levels
Enter your name
You got the high score
Don't get sloppy, pracitce, learn
Gotta play to win
Cuz bad guys return
You gotta play to win
Get past the boss
Gotta save the princess whatever the cost

There's a time when you gotta take life by the reigns
Grab the bull by the horns and a hundred other cliches
Fly planes, grab wheels of cars, jump off buildings
Head to the dentist, get those fillings
Stand up to wrong men, all over the continent
Show em you're competent, don't censor your content
Sport t-shirts saying something awfully rotten
Dry on low heat, they're 100% cotton
Sometimes the hero's an average guy who doesn't drive a hummer
Don't say you're just a turtle or only a plumber
Don't say you're just a baby dragon with bubbles to blow
Just a kid from hyrule with crappy a crappy sword and bow
When you hear the call you have to head it
When destiny calls you have to meet it
When they deliver a pizza you have to eat it
Feel the michael jackson step up an beat it
Its just a boss level, go on defeat it
Don't get caught drowing, swim like some semen
Sometimes faith in something hard to believe in
Can save the whole universe from monsters or demons
So if the dr's robotnik, stand up and stop it
If he escapes to space hijack a rocket
Spin up to warp three once you hop in the cock pit
This ain't a game of tag you can't just yell not it
You might also like
You can be the champ you can win it all
You can be the champ if you heed the call
You gotta win at all costs, losers suck
Loser gets the fatties, winner gets the sluts
Winner gets easter eggs after credits
Secret ending is your championship evidence
Keep on drinking straight through the puking
Do whatever ever it takes to be super human
If zombies ate your neighbors start blastin and shootin
If there's sonic boom, gon on blast that hadouken
There's probably treasure if you can raid the ruin
Keep you're head high when the crowd is booing
Power up with some milk if the cows is mooin
Grab that warp whistle and watch em all start oohin
Friday night when everyone's out
Train in your basement, don't ever doubt
Ignore your mom when she begs you to move out
Climb up that vine, jump in that cloud (reach for that crown)
Take the wheel from toejam, crash into earth
Blast to the top, be a jim and a worm
Don't do it for fame, be your own champion
Even greats get forgotten just ask little samson
The fact is practice, just learn to rap this
Then chill in 8-8 with the former fat kids
Stand up to bad guys, your attack must show
Olivia and layla must be let go
This ain't just for you, its for your people
Want job security, do it right, and you'll get your sequel
Someone always doubts, but they'll be sorry though
