I know what you been bustin
In my girlfriend's face
Giving her that loving
Sing her your lullabies
Don't lie i recognize
All the classic signs
Under your spell, she's hypnotized
You're such a player
Breakin lots of hearts
Well she's a good girl
Go play some mario kart
Cuz ur 16 she's 26 and i don't don't mean to scold
But shouldn't you be running game on 9 year olds
Go fuck demi lovato or miley cyrus
Hollywood's finest they love your heinous
Go frost they eyelids let's put this behind us
Come on bro, tell me why you takin all my vaginas

Cuz you tell her baby baby baby

She begs begs begs her way back to my world

Dear justin
I think your motherfuckin face needs readjusting
Dear bieber
Let me make it clear
If you come round here
If you ever see her
If i see your sneakers
If you deciever her
You'll be mike seaver
You better become a believer
I'll explode your brain
Left hook, my kick's the crane
Right hook, uppercut, more of the same
Hello hospital j-biebs got growing pains
In every appendage
Aww look what ben did
This pop stars legless and suspended
Mini steve urkle hung from distended
Bowels someone get some towels it's ended
Can't be mended, even out facebook's unfriended

And you're little chipmunk face
You're little chipmunk teeth
And you're little chipmunk hair
You're gonna be chipmunk meat
You got 3 billion hoes

You mom called bed time
So you better head home
