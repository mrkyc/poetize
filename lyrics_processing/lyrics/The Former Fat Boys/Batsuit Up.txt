It goes and goes forever wrapping all around the block
There's lotsa bitches here
There's lotsa dudes too
There's bouncers out front
What's this Lil Wayne s'posed to do?
I could flash some cash
Or try to whoop some ass
Or go detective comics on em...
And just just sneak past
It's getting late all the bottle whores
Will be spoken for
They'll be nothing left for me
When I get my in the door
So I spring into action
It's back to the mansion
Gotta switch my style up
Then I'll kill it like a Manson
Ditch the designer jeans
Grab a killer dark suit
Straight out a cave
But it'll have to do
Ditch my Rolls-Royce
Hop into a modified
Ford Futura from old times
And blast the turbine
Then I speed back
Through the empty streets
And when I pull up
All the bros scream
And when I pull up
All the hoes cream
And when I pull up
It's like a a fucking dream
And when I pull up
All the villains flee
You got a dress code
But I come dressed as me
You might also like
So I bat suit up
I got my cape and my cowl on
Cuz tonight I'm here to party
Cuz I made the crime all gone
I saved the city once
I saved the city twice
I saved it three times
I deserve to skip the line
So I bat suit up
I got my cape and my cowl on
Cuz tonight I'm here to party
Cuz I made the crime all gone
I ain't no Superman
But I saved the whole world
Now come here cutie bootie
You can be my bat girl
All you wannabes
Gangbangers and gun-toters
You think you run this place
Y'all a bunch of fucking jokers
You got your bottle service
You push a lot of weight
One little wire transfer
I'll fucking own this place
You drunk and confident
Why not hit the batman?
You think your supervillians
But you're just some henchmen
We're up in VIP
She's making lots of noise
She's screaming out
"Where does he get these wonderful toys?"
Then there's a bat signal
Shinin' through the skylight
The whole club just stops and stares
But this is my night
I'm drinking taquila
I'm singing that new ke$ha
Tik-tok on clock till it's time that I defeat ya
It could be killer croc
Or the scarecrow
It could be harley quinn
Or poison ivy but I'll never know
It's a holiday, I got the night off
Someone else can handle it, maybe they can call the cops
So I switch chicks
This one's got no class
Plus she's a clayface
She's the one that needs a mask
Cuz I've done catwoman
Bagged a beaumont
I need some pedigree if you wanna ride the bat cock
So I bat suit up
I got my cape and my cowl on
Cuz tonight I'm here to party
Cuz I made the crime all gone
She's wearing latex
She's got her head bobbin
My batphone rings
But tonight immma leave it up to robin
So I bat suit up
I got my cape and my cowl on
Cuz tonight I'm here to party
Cuz I made the crime all gone
I trained with R'as al Ghul
Don't try this at home kids
