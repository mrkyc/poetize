I'm chilling out out in the lost world baby
Getting all the ladies in the lost world baby
Cuz it gets a little crazy in the lost world baby
And i'm falling in love in the lost world baby
I ain't the typical dino living in the BC
Every other dino wants to be me
Cuz i'm so 2009, metrosexual pedigree
I'm a star all these hot compys keep petting me
Completely divorced, beyonce was a whore
And she never seemed to make me go ROAR ROAR
Still got my time traveling train
And my oversized brain
Bankrupt in the future, but I'm back to reign
Pop a squat on my throne, like a prehistoric rome
Lost my record deal, pulled an ET and phoned home
Just like a mortgage, totally a loan
Prehistoric emperor ruling with an iron bone
The next first caligula
Fuckin nothing in particular
Fucking hot dino mamas i'm a stiff-a-ler
Ain't fucking looking at chu, i was looking at her
I'm looking to flirt, i'm looking to make my heart hurt
And i see a lil raptor with them birdlike thighs
Scaly fucking tail with some green ass eyes
With a little amber in her hide like the fly that made me alive
I say baby you wanna ride and travel through time
You can be my jennifer i'll be your marty mcfly
You can be my high school love, my sight for sore eyes
Or i can be your doc brown, you can swallow my cock down
The call me brian wilson cuz i get around, round get around
Round baby i get all of the girls
And i'm setting up shop chillin in the lost world with a boner
You might also likeI pretend to be a player, i'm really just a poet
Original author romeo and juliet i wrote it
Shakespeare stole it and i hold it against him to this day
He's a phony who stole every word in all of his plays
He's a money grubbing idiot clever early london city kid
Original vanilli didn't write or sing his biggest hits
But back to the program, that's pg
13 chicks on my dick in the pan-G
A bakers dozen, of dinosaur loving
But one stood out man this chick had something
Maybe her teeth, maybe her claws
Prominent jaw my horny little triceratops
Took her out dinner literally at the ivy
Over by the forrest glen, next to a couple of high trees
My hot lil vegetarian chowing down some ferns
I even used silverware eating grilled laura dern
That it was back to my place which is basically a giant fucking rock
She moaned from the size as she jumped on top
That's where the term originated...yeah, dinosaurus cock
And every single night we make the bedrock
We make the bedrock make the make the bedrock
Killed my first wife in cold blood
Then kicked back with a cold one
But i'm having a blast cuz this new one ain't the old one
She's fun we party nightly
Her exes wanna fight me
I rip off their heads
As she smiles nicely in her tight jeans
What are the chances like rocks falling from above
One in a billion chance that i'd fall in love
Every once in awhile i need pussy so i get it
And i find myself a sabertooth tigrette and its electric
But otherwise i'm old faithful, one girl for my geyser
Ok i'm lying, i'm a womanizer womanizer womanizer womanizer
I only have eyes for you and you and you and her
Pussy's pussy whether covered in skin scales or fur
But now she got pregnant shit's hit the fan lately
She keeps screaming, i think she hates me
The kid pops out, roar and i just go crazy
I hate the thing, it keeps saying i'm the baby i'm the baby
Well i'm the daddy, i'm a deadbeat a lot
I'll miss her forever, future's calling, i'll reclaim the top spot
Besides paris hilton texted, she wants to bone on her yacht
