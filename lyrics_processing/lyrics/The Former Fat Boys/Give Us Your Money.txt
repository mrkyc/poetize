I'll give it back
Lower the deficit fast
Increase my taxes
Or I just might drop my pants
And whip out the future
So what you gonna do sir?
The rack
In the back
After the fact
I'm hittin' that
In that short skirt, twerk-twerk
She gon' make it squirt squirt
Do it like we're Ernie and Bert
Her friend jumps in berzerk
Whips off her shirt
We share her like dessert
So fund my dreams
Gimme me money like you were tithing at your church

Give us your money
Give us your cash
Give us your money
We won't give it back
Then give us your girlfriends
Give us your wives
They'll dump your ass
For our twenties and fives
You might also likeGive us your money
Give us your cash
Give us your money
We won't give it back
We'll get your daughters
We when got a Porsche
We flash some cash
They're down on all fours

They say my behavior is likely to endanger
Myself and others
But I recover under covers
Of hundred dollar bills
And pills and thousand dollar lovers
And I'm so ridifferent
I combine words, I'm mothers
Worst nightmares
But who cares, it's about who stares
Gold-plated platinum
Platinum-plated diamonds
Who cares where they mine is?
So cold, gave her so much ice
She let me frost her eyelids
Shut with my kids

Now shut your fucking faces
Cut off your bracelets
Dad's working late shifts
Mom's rockin' facelifts
I already had her taste this
Then squirtled on her fake tits
In your basement, she drove me home in the minivan, shameless
Let them underage hoes get shitfaced its
Jack Daniels with braces
It was your mom, don'tcha worry about AIDS miss
I got a Benneton heart and my dick ain't racist
Gimme white girls, black girls and a mix of Asians
One day we'll get married, it starts with a first kiss
Promise, make your way lower, it's ok, I'm so rich
Don't worry about breakouts, I hear it clears zits
