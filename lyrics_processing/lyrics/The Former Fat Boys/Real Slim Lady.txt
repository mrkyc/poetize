May I have your attention please?
To stay thin, ladies:
Throw up
I repeat:
In order to stay thin, ladies:
Throw up
We got a thin one here
You act like you never seen a thin person before
Jaws all on the floor like a Jewish camper just burst through the door
Extended then they did in 44 but they're models, not Jews, anymore
It's a model, oh wait, no wait, you're kidding
That's a not a person down there on the runway
And Jenny Craig said
"Diet you idiots! Buy my food that tastes just like dog shit"
Bulimic women puke M&Ms
Chikka chikka slim ladies there stick thin
Look at them walking puking food in their gut
Not eating food though
But their boob's huge, though
Think they got a couple hundred pounds to lose?
But the bitch is so thin she's wearing kids size 2
She wants to have a steak and let loose
But can't but it's sexy to have a huge caboose
You might also likeCome on and sway your hips
Come on and sway your hips
Want to be sexy? Then look like a popsicle stick
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what binging and purging is
Of course they're going to know what throwing up is
By the time they're in the fourth grade they've seen at least one 
Thin sex symbols, well there's something animal
Compare fat and thin if I don't hold a candle
But if men and drink and drink until they're drunk
There ain't no reason why I see a tubby women can't throw up
But if you feel like I feel I got the antidote
Don't attend to little hoes
Bulimic wouldn't touch those

I love slim ladies yes real slim ladies
All you non-slim ladies are just nauseating
'Cause to stay slim lady just throw up
Just throw up

 have to eat 
It's true, I'd fuck her
I'd fuck Kate Moss too
Think I give a damn about pussy?
There's plenty other women who purge their stomachs just to look pretty
You're slim ultra maggot haven't eaten in a year
Hey girl, how about we share a hot dog and a beer?
"No way then I'll get fat like the girl from Cheers!"
Shit, Christina Aguilera in a couple of years
She'll be so hungry she'll bite off Fred Durst's bratwurst
You hear about the new diet drug? I brought it first
It's working well I lost a hundred pounds in a week
Just have to put up with normal heart rate times three!
And they look pretty boney and it's a wonder to me
How they survive and never eat
Think of all those crazy diet ads
Richard Sims annoys me, think I'm going to kick him in the gonads
And there's a million women who just don't eat
Who think they're heavy live off water and celery
Who dress slutty who throw up a 
And just might be the thinnest thing but not like me

Think he's a head trip to listen to
Because I'm poking fun at you
Most people eat their fill until there's no more room
The difference is these girls got cotton balls in their stomach
Those cotton balls feel full so they don't eat anything at all
They go to a buffet and just eat it
Run to the bathroom and quickly excrete it
And diuretics help shit ninety percent of the food out of there
Then people wonder why kids eat Metabolife without a care
It's funny because at the rate they're going when they're sixty
They'll be the only grandma in the bathroom still purging
Losing their asses but starving isn't working
And they want to be slim so guys will keep flirting
And every teen girl is a slim lady lurking
She could be working at Dairy Queen puking up her ice cream
Or in the kitchen bingeing screaming "I look like a truck"
In the bathroom mirror looking at her butt
Will all the real thin ladies please throw up
And raise one of your centimeter arms up
And realize this disorder is out of control
But who cares? As long some guy wants to shove in his pole

Haha
There's probably a thin lady in all of us
Hey, girl, if you're not going to eat that
Give it to us
Uh oh I have to lose some weight
