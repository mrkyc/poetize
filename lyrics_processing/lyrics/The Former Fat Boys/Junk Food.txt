All in all he's bad for your heart
Be smart let him go cuz we got a spark

So you say you got a man now and that's fine
But i heard from your friends he's a bad guy
You're the taco bell onions he's ecoli
He started off a spud, now he's a large fry
He still tastes good, but your not sure you should

I'm Corona Zero, so go on drink a keg
