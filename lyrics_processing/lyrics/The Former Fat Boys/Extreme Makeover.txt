And if you're house is glass you better hold your stones
And if you're home alone, and hear my tone
Its time to be a man, act full grown
Cuz all the animostity takes it toll
I got an extreme make over for your soul
We need an extreme make over for the soul
This an extreme make over for your soul
I ain't been to prison but I done a bunch of crimes
I ain't got a lot of dollars but i got a lot of dimes
Ain't got a fancy watch but i gotta lot of time
I ain't good at writing beats but i can fucking rhyme
I put lamborghini doors on my 97 neon
And i got buzz for light years to infiinity and beyond
And y'all more simplistic than bunch a fucking heathens
I got more sides to me than a dodecahedron
They call me sucksex baby cuz I suck at sex
Naw, just kidding cuz I suck the best breasts
On chests on girls that never used to look my way
Now it's a sunny day, sweeping clouds away
Formerly fat just trying be formerly famous
I'll be a one hit wonder then gladly the lamest
Lemme get a lil eloquent, speak a little beautifully
Preach a little promise, encourage a little unity
Put your hands up if you're feeling alive
And if you're not too cool go on give a high five
And if you feeling a lil angry go on swallow your pride
Lemme be your guide let's rebuild ourselves on the inside
You might also likeMaking so much noise they gonna call the police
Got my piece of shit ride cuz i ain't go no lease
Sitting on my porch rap-rapping to dope beats
Kids biking in the streets, a million little opie's
Pass a smile on and see where it goes
If you're moving really fast, stop, breathe, smell a rose
Treat her like a lady, not like a ho
Do what's right, instead of listening to polls
And who knows, one day the sun may shine brighter
Every friendship may be a little tighter
Study a little harder, pull an all nighter
Train a little longer, be a better fighter
Pick your battles don't get lost fighting wars
Don't drown in whores, lose your savings at scores
Don't dismiss the poor cuz one day you may be more needy if your job don't need you any more
Please don't ask me for a cigarette you shouldn't fucking smoke
Please don't ask me to drop a verse you're a fucking joke
This ain't that kinda party, i got pepsi not coke
Don't come backstage for groupie love, you'll prolly choke
If you got a million bucks make it rain
Cuz time's flying like doc brown on his train
Even scrooge mcduck with all of his luck and brains
