Put down that remote, lemme be your LeVar
Let's celebrate who you are, read a little Babar
The elephant in the room is that today's kids are starved
They need a imagination, its not very hard
You can see the man in the moon with a library card
So, read

If you stroll down the road Where the Red Fern Grows
Frog and toad still play and the wind still blows
In the willows leaves a world that's free from batteries
If you take a look it's in a book
Imagination is the key
And we speak clearly like Beverly Cleary and Ralphus Mouse
Those human friends so dearly
Henry Huggins and Ribsy have a paper route
Growing up is so confusing but Romona works it out
Are you there god?
It's me, Margaret
Menstruating in the bathroom adolescent target
Then again, maybe I won't lock my bathroom  door
Blue marker on the face is the freckled juice cure
Marty Preston has a friend and his name is Shilo
In West Virginia where the lilacs lie low
And when the Stinky Cheese Man is on the run
I never knew that PBS could be so much fun

Wordburgla, read some books they help you learn stuff, check
I can't lie
Most of my favorite books have pictures in them
Action adventure ridiculous where all fixtures in them
Fix the system individuals matrix outwards
Little insurance sured I can spout words to music
Before I knew of CS Lewis let me move anything with no BS
To it, grew it kids from Narnia to Slaughterhouse Five
Choose your own adventure
Never thought about why
Life of Pi
Friend forever of pals and dirt
Graduated more to Alan Moore
Calibre, galacre, Henry Clay
JD Salinger rabbit ears at bay
So stay between the pages kids I'm telling you books is major

Flip it to see what comes next

Check it out I just wrecked my zephyr
And the sails won't fly, I'm stuck forever
In a land faraway, and I'll have to stay
I should known it was gonna be a no good very bad day
I should have moved to australia, chilled with kangaroos
Worn a purple coat with my bright white shoes
Imagination is endless, but pasta is not
That is unless you happen to possess a pasta pot that's magic
So I throw a batch in, its starts to grow
But I shoulda listened when streganona said no
But the best lessons, I've learned have been on my own
Turns out there's no gila monsters at my new home
Turns out there's nice monsters underneath my bed
And I no longer fear being where the wild things tread
I'm starting to understand, how with just a purple crayon
I can draw an adventure with only my hand
I can dig up dinosaurs and assemble the bones
Find a buttonless bear and give him a home
And travel so far without leaving my chair
Picking blueberries with sal look out a bear!
I'll keep on reading, I'm never gonna stop
Like pre-jimmy neutron bob fulton stretching soda pop
Till its endless
Create a little mischeif like Calvin or Dennis
The day got worse I'm at the dentist
But Mrs. Piggle Wiggle and her house upside down
And solving a case with encyclopedia Brown
And chance of rain, from a meatball cloud
Have turned my frown upside down, my day around
Now i'm prepared for anything, whatever I do
If it rains carrots or there's a phantom toll booth
That appears just to test me, or a pirate with a hook
Got me hooked, its fun come take a look, in a book
