That's when I flash my smile
Warp two we chit chat awhile
Warp three she smiles back at me
And then we're out on the floor
They say that's warp four
Warp five warp six
I'm giving her all she's got
Warp seven
Just radiating hot
Warp 8
I brush her hair to the side
When her lips touch mine
That's warp 9
She's feeling lonely, like every guys an actor
My crew beams in to relax and party after
Girls come around cuz we bring the laughter
They say we bastards
Cuz we up on our prey like pastors
I front a bit cuz I know love hurts
And it's rare to find a chick that's down with Captain Kirk
That'll love a man dancing in a dinosaur shirt
So I play my position until they tired of jerks
Cuz other guys wanna be bullies
So me and bo vice tip the DJ cuz we wanna hear oldies
A little Johnny B Goode mashed up wit Boyz in the Hood
About to go and damn near went blind where I stood
She loved the way I did the Marty McFly
She says it's been years since guy that could slide
Past her defenses, put a smile on her face
So I spin her around and we light up the space
You might also likeThe worlds moving so fast, I see stars
She could be my six I'm Baltar
I need a sword of omens to see if she lyin
Will we last forever or are we Conan O'Brien?
Cuz I'm jumping ahead this might not last months
But I can see us raising kids or even singing Chipmunks
I hope this doesn't go supernova just this once
Usually hit bunts I'm due for some home runs
Cuz I pimp hits, say baby sip this
VIP it for free, cool like the sickest kids
Poppin whippits, in Benz Merecedes that's
Really a '97 Neon ha can I get a witness?
I'm kinda crazy and I'm sometimes late
I'm from a dimenson where it's impossible to drive straight
Where we drift all day, cuz life's so great
So take my hand babe, let's accellerate
People say you need a spaceship with fresh nacells
Hyperdrive, navi-computer would work as well
But in my T-16 back on Tatooine I find my queen
And I cast my spell
Woo her at the cantina until she fell
And me and this little princess would lay until
The stars seemed to move on their own in space
It's really just science just ask Bryce Case
How we can move so fast just by standing in place
How I can sing her this silly diddy and she don't mase
How we can be blackjack I'm a two she's an ace
She's a miracle berry no matter how sour life tastes
It's so yum, when she gives me some
When she first asked me my name I was like ummmmmmm
My ship's name is Prince and she's like why
