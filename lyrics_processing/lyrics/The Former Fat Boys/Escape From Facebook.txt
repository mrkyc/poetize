Mark Zuckerberg
I see that you made it
Got out of my basement
But you'll never escape
There is no way
I've been awaiting this day
I cannot lose
What can you do
I control truth
It's whatever I say
No moves
Can counter my factious funnels of fatal fake news
So bow to my brain or I'll leak nudes
Of you in '04 hazing frat dudes
They're saved on my servers
The terms of the service
Soley serve some sick purpose
To forever and blindly bind you
So take your best shot
I'm always behind you
Lurking and jerking round every wall
Undefeated I'm Jake Paul
First place I'm a vessel of light
Congress can't stop me with their oversight
You close an account and think I'm out of your life?
My schtoyle unblockable you think that you might....

I can feel you weaken
Lean in to my Beacon
Freaking, I feed on anger, I feed on hate
I feed on users that think that they can try to escape
And it's time I ate cuz it's late
And you're on my plate escape from Faceook
But that wasn't even my last laugh
Monopoly map
I get you back
Messenger Instagram and WhatsApp
Ha!
And you think you're fully equipped
With potions and tunics and upgrades and ish
That you bought from the ads that I served on your quest
Then my 5G cancer ray blasts through your chest
Banished Boss Babes & farm games
MLM schemes cranked to eleven
Logic as leveled up weapons
But I've tracked every move that you've ever made since you were seven
Know thyself, know thy enemey
100 battles, AI fear no threat to me
Beat-up a brainwashed boomer horde
You made my Russian Robots roar
Killed krazy Kevins and killer Karens
Zombies that you used to know as your parents
Standing there swaggerin'
Like your name is Saverin
But there's no escape from my blue & white labyrinth

Robot Mark Zuckerberg: I remember that night I launched Facebook. I wondered if I was just an impostor
Player One: An impostor?!
Robot Mark Zuckerberg: The thing that I was reall fascinated by is understanding people. Understanding facial expressions, emotions
Player One: Like some kind of AI...robot?!
Robot Mark Zuckerberg: Processing. Processing. Processing
Player One: Why did you do it?
Robot Mark Zuckerberg: A billion dollars. Billion dollars. Billion dollars
Player One: Why are you still fighting? What do you even have to fight for?
Robot Mark Zuckerberg: I get a little bit frustrated when people fear monger about AI and how it could end up hurting people
Player One: You robot butthole!
Robot Mark Zuckerberg: It is gonna bother you because you're human. And I was human. I am human. I am not a lizard
Player One: Arrgghhhhhhhhhh!
Kill Mark Zuckerberg
And if you get free, where will you be
TikTok on the clock hear the beat
The devil you know or don't, see?
A Sophie's choice it's China or me
You got a blockchainsaw and an antitrust sword
I got a billion dollars that says I win this war...
