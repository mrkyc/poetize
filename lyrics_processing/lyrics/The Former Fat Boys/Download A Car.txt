Woo!
I'd download a car
I'd download a boat
I'll download anything
Cuz man I'm broke
I'd download a mouse
I'd download a house
I'd download a chair
And a matching couch
If you can make it zeroes and ones
And I can print it out
I don't fucking care, I'll download a cow
I'd download a spaceship
And fly to the stars
I'd download cologne
I'd download a car
I'm on the net from the rise to sunset
I'm bored and broke and the day ain't begun yet
Got a 15 megabit connection to free stuff
You wanna ride, grab ya laptop and surf's up
Head to http www Tee Pee Bee
Go on an Isohunt DL an NZB
Download Twilight 3, in 1080p
From a workprint release smuggled by DGs
The unsung bothans of the piracy scene
They DS9 unseen, so we call em the breen
You got a puny e-penis
Compared to scene kids
Who've already seen it
And by it, I mean everything happenin
Your hundred million dollar turd starring Hugh Jackman
Right now I'd be drunk if I could download Captain
And Coke, but that's just a distant hope
That we'll replicate matter from a port in our homes
Dre's Detox will leak, I'll crank it thru foobar
And I'll download rum, and a whole bar
And I'll download free gas while I unRAR my new car
Science will figure it out, it can't be too hard
You might also likeI'd download a car
I'd download a boat
I'd download your mom
Then upload to her throat
And do the same with Jenna Jame and Taylor Rain
You could say I downloaded brain
I'd download a bat suit
And then download joker
I'd download Edward Cullen
Then Bram Stoker
And watch him kick some Twilight ass
I'd download David Duke and photoshop him black
They call us Millennials, we got excess degrees
Crushed by student loans we don't just want it free
We got a need, we're 'bout to bleed
Demographically, the most unemployed group in half a century
Raised on McMansions and credit cards
Laptop rappers now we're saving in jars
So it's back to mom and dad's
They don't really want us back
But their pad's got WiFi
And so we eek by
Arrested Development, L.O.S.T. season 4, 5, 6
And so on, and so forth and so pissed
As O's stimulus goes to districts that don't exist
This system is wishin on population growth
But we're shrinking and consumption chokes
Then there's less jobs for us younger folks
Debt's a noose, we'll be in debt to hope
Which is why, no joke, we'd download soap
I'd download a car
I'd download a boat
I downloaded 12 seasons of Murder She Wrote
I'd download SpongeBob, Kazoos
And party favors
I'd download Baskin Robbins 31 flavors
And a new pair of Addidas rod lavers
I'd download the '69 Celtics and Lakers
I'd download a submarine and play Captain Nemo
Then some 3-D glasses and see captain EO

Those of us with jobs are blessed
But what about the rest
Stimulus checks don't exactly future protect
But if I learned anything from Picard and La Forge
Is that one day we'll replicate what we cannot afford
And everything will be free
And every English degree can download a living
And a pool to go swimming
And all the snooty classic lit and history kids
Won't be shoutin "they took our jobs!" at Asian kids
And us business students
At our class reunions
We'll all download Bentley's
And real fine suits
Download gorgeous blonde porn star prostitutes
I mean escorts, maybe we'll be on ships and fight borgs
For now we're suburban brats with big dreams
When even Jay-Z's gotta wear some girls jeans
Won't fear RIAA, if my dreams come true
We'll have to face the wrath of the UAW when we...
I'd download a car
I'd download a boat
I'd download a goa'uld and be it's new host
I'd download a goat
I'd download a ghost
I'd download a castle and piranha-filled moat
Download everything that my eyes can see
Maybe a t-rex from Jurassic Park site C
I'd download a cave
Then I'd be brave download Osama bin Laden as a slave
Be depraved give him to the goat to ram
I'd download Aerosmith and watch em jam
I'd download some ice cold Surge from 1998
I'd download the world's greatest PB and J
If you can make it zeroes and ones
And i can print it out
I don't fucking care, I'll download a cow
I'd download The Graduate
By MC Lars
I'd download a robot
I'd download a car
Would you download a car?
Of course you'd fucking download a car!
What are you, stupid?
You'd be more likely to download a car than this song
But here's what I want to see happen:
Let's get everyone in the world to steal this song at least once
I want to see it on like every fucking torrent site ever
So game, on
Steal my song
