It's the return of the fat kid
The dork strikes back
I'm a brand new hope
When these clones attack
A phantom menace
Now I've returned
Witness the rebirth
This is the revenge of the nerd
The fat kids back
The fat kid has returned
Picking up chicks
'Cause all the fat he burned
Still a nerd
Fuck what you heard
I'll emerge
King of the suburbs
And lord of the Adwords
Nerdier than Star Wars geekier than Star Trek
Getting rides to PAX like mom we there yet?
Punt me, DoS me, I ain't leaving
I'll be hawking CDs like my name was Steven
Shooting some aliens like I'm Spaceman Spiff
Send 'em swimming with the fishes down with MC Chris
'Cause no one ever says: get good grades
You can get straight A's
Its ok
'Cause one day those A's will get you laid
'Cause one day those A's will get you paid
'Cause one days those A's will make you great
Then you can rub that shit in everyone's face

We've been pushed down in the dirt
We've been the source of your burns
Physically and emotionally hurt
We've heard all sorts of harsh words
Teased 'cause we're fat or we're squirts
Gotten blood on our Yoda shirts
We think its time that you learn
We think its time that you heard
We think its time we stood up
We think its time we return
We think its time we were heard
This is the revenge of the nerds
(Beefy)
Keithy Keithy he's so beefy
He sat down and squashed the city
He's half cow and half a Beener
Neener neener neener
Been pushed and I pushed back
Throw downs at the gym track
Where I smash 'em with the backpack
Kids wanna bring the big man down
Make me hit the ground
Make a big man sound
It's no wonder that I hit the stage
And let the nerdy rage
Spill off the page
But still inside me is that lonely kid that
Who's just way too pissed because he's always hit just
Just jot it down with a pad and a pen -
If I wore a trench coat you'd take me seriously then
Why I don't get mad when other rappers diss
Because I heard better fat jokes at the age of six
So talk your smack behind my back
You better watch out because I'm on the attack
And they kick and they punch and they taunt and they spit
Now they're all pissed off cause I'm big on the net, go!

Once upon a time I wrote a rhyme
And this line, it defined what was mine so benign, now it's always rap time
Filling the hole I wish I knew
You can't please everyone
This much is true cause
'Cause people said this, people said that, people said you're nerdy on the mic when you rap
Who cares what they say when it's never that smart
To see your worth in how people judge your art
So show after show yo, I got addicted
To being on stage so unrestricted
Finally found peace and serenity in a post-modern identity
Now I rap for me
And I can't go wrong
Lots of kids with RhymeTorrents with opinions on my songs
I'm here to lyrically assisinate the mediocre
Stake to your heart r.i.p, Bram Stoker!

I'm murderous now
Oh so solid
But back in the day I was a little awkward
Now in magazines
Watching my scene
Explode
Unfold
And the future holds
Everything that I dreamed about
The full count
Sermon on the mount, come and hear me shout
All about nerd pride and "what's inside"
That sticks in the hearts and minds of the people
Back then, when the kids were evil
I plotted and revenge now I laugh last
I came up in the game just oh quick fast
Now I see these people from my past
And they ask how did you do it?
How did you come up in the game so fluid?
I planned this, planned to ninja vanish on all the haters
Now I command this, command this
