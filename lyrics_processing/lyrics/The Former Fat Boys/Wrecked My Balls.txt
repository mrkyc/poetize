I clutched, yes I'm gonna cry
She kicked, not once like tons and tons
I think, I am gonna die
Don't you ever say, you look overweight
Say she looks cute and lie
If her friend is hot, don't tweet her your cock
Or you might not survive
She came in and she wrecked my balls
She never hit so hard below
And yeah maybe it's all my fault
But now she'll never
Erect e e ct me
No one'll
Ere e ect me
I think it's broke, my only hope
Is pills little blue pills
I might have sexted with her sis
And now, I'm writing my will
Don't you ever cheat, even secretly
She will find out you lied
If her mom's around, no drunk making out
They'll be no place to hide

I guess she probably checked my calls
And yeah maybe it's all my fault
But now she'll never
Erect e e ct me
She came in and she wrecked my balls
She never hit so hard below
And yeah maybe it's all my fault
But now she'll never
Erect e e ct me
No one'll

Never thought she's ruin my jizz
Wanna make another pearl necklace
I always thought I'd have some kids
Jason Bateman in the switch
I always thought I'd use my jizz
To make another pearl necklace
Guess I'll never get that wish
Don't you ever say, you look overweight
Say she looks cute and lie
She came in and she wrecked my balls
She just closed her eyes and punched
Man you shoulda seen me fall
Now no one'll ever
Erect e e ct me
She came in and she wrecked my balls
She never hit so hard below
And yeah maybe it's all my fault
And now she'll never
Erect e e ct me
Yeah she wrecked me
