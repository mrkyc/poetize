Fight the bad guys
Go! Go!
Even if they get supersized
Go! Go!
You gotta Risk you lives
Go! Go!
It's morphin Time
How many teens got a surprise
A secret identity they try and hide
Go! go!
So if you got a power coin
Just flip the side its morphin time

Dynamic duo here to fight some crime
Like what's up its morphin time
Heroes naturally selected by intelligent design
Cuz it seems like villans been writing rhymes
We're the straight a's, you're the straight d's
We gonna make you go poof like we punched z's
When you go turbo, we're gonna go lightspeed
Just call us like (boop boop boo doo) beep beep
You might also likeWe'll go from regular suburban nerds
To folk super hero ninja ranger rappers
With powers unheard of, rock your ear drums
So tap your communicator and beam up

Back into action, the fight never ends
From earth to the moon and back again
Leaving angel grove girls exposed like lord zedd
And totally blowing flutes like tommy did
We're the real thing cuz girls always know
A futuristic sex robot is just a dildo
And we transform and combine to kill those
With our own robot made out of dinos
Widely respected widely adored
Fighting villans from Rita to the evil Moltor/Norg/Lothor
Getting girls cuz they all wanna ride in my zord
And play with my sword, cuz these other mc's have em totally bored
Every other second a new hero is born
Looking up to us like the beaver to ward
They don't know they have the power till we show em how to morph
Cuz i'm pretty sure every hero was previously a dork
Push your hands out if you wanna transform
To a superhero ranger that brings the ninja storm
Drum some dino thunder, strike a chord
And if you're the white ranger sing along with your sword
Never use your power for personal gain
Never use your morpher for personal fame
Keep your identity secret, friendships true
Don't escalate a battle unless rita forces you
Spread your wings and you'll defeat the goldars
With a little team work you'll be stacking gold bars
Come on now, its easy and simple
Don't be stupid now like bulk and skull
Before:
Average chunky geek teen
After:
Alt rapping crime fighting machine
Pick tommy if you're playing with friends
