Landed that plane, defeated some snakes
Hit the bars for some R&R like charles i'm in charge
Me and my whole crew we hyperstraight living it large
Except the ones that died, from poisonous bites
But we pour 40s of frozen, flavored ice
On the curb as we enter this theme park center
Hard corey hard is fuck samuel l still my mentor
Wanna ride every ride till we done
Wanna win a prize squirtin a gun
Want my g's past 4 bye olivia munn
Like that old man said more flags more fun
And we chillin out yo we riding those rides
Fast pass in our hands yo we skippin those lines
But then i feel a splash from nowhere, water hits me
Something ain't quite right, something seems fishy
It happened fast so i grabbed my Glock
Whipped it out let it spray like Peter North's cock
But the way we was whipping in those loop dee loops
I couldn't aim couldn't shoot the mutant sharks on the loose
Hard Corey threw up and then ran to el bano
Prolly gonna get a blumpkin cuz he was runnin with blonde hoes
I was shooting and axeing, luckily i brought my axe
Junior woodchuck for life, prepared for attacks
From snakes or sharks or bug bats or rats
Putting Great Whites in them body bags
And the Hammerheads hammering they heads with a hammer
Yeah i also had a hammer, crowd takin pics with cameras
Ustreaming it live for their at home grammmas
I hope the third movie ain't zepplins and pandas
They running the attractions, things going nuts
Only one way to stop it, put bombs in they butts and blow the park up
You might also likeA better shark fighter than me, no fucking way
I'm deep blue sea, i'm ll cool j
I'm blowing up sharks, from a rollercoaster car
That i ripped off the track retrofitted in an hour
Driving it straight over to the main control tower
The park's my greyskull, and i have the power
There's a boss shark inside it's clear from his face
This ain't a normal shark, this shark's from space
Part squid too the way he let his ink spray
But i dodged like a chrysler
Like a rock chevrolet
His henchmen chased i got in costume 'n lost em
Threw bombs on they butts blew em up it was JAWSOME
Followed clues 'n toothes to the water park ride
A final showdown, climactic boss fight
Ate shark guts for longer life, pay attention kids
Deepest bluest, my hat is like a sharks fin
It cuts in, cuts him, exposing the lies
These mutant sharks were really snakes in elaborate disguise
Back for revenge consumed with hate
Chopped him up like a scene out of Fishysiousse 8
Wounds ridiculous, his blood glows in the dark
The smell is horrendous like an ostrich fart
But i've got the last laugh as i axe out his hearts
