And we getting down on the dance floo
And i love you everywhere you go
You know i love you so
I wrote this out for you
So you would know
So can i yap at ya
I wanna yap at ya
I wanna ya at ya
I wanna let you know
That you're my ho
And take you home
And make you moan

So kiss my toilet parts
I'll kiss your toilet parts
I pull up to the club in a car that don't exist
It's got rims, gps, ps4's, its got chicks
Paint job changes twice a night
Candy coated go on taste the rainbow if you like
Lick it lick, suck suck baby just don't bite it
If you wanna ride pull shirt up if you excited
Down on your knees, please, if you wanna get knighted
Cuz my clothes glow and sparkle shiny shiny
And when i ride my whores in the club you can find me
Front and center, neverending bender
If a ho steps outta line, pull an urkle and suspend her
Cut off her funds, cut off her ones
I'm vip i don't want none if you got buns hun
So we kick down the doors find some trim and just start eyein it
So many cuties booties so little time i haven't decided
Then in the strobe is this ho with diamond eyelids
Banging smile bouncing boobs man she can have my kids
Or we can adopt cuz she's hot and i'm not one to waste away what the lord gives
And i stride to her side and straddle her fine hips the finest
And this is what i whisper to her ears with my lips
You might also likeI wanna grab wanna grope wanna gaze wanna yap at ya
Can i take a snap for my myspace, can i get your picture
Can i get your ass out them jeans
Prolly not cuz its like nothing i've ever scene
Cuz she got them shoes with the holes where her toes show so sexy
8 inch heels, tits faux real, go on feel, flexy flexy
Legs behind her head right out in my backseat
She spent her stimulus check some baggies of weed
And her hdtv, so i can watch esp-n
While she gives me head on the weekends
And babe i promise that i'll dress you up in nothing less than gucci stuff
With prada bags not lauren conrags
You're no hills slut, i promise babe you're worth it
And i love when you climb up on a pole and work it
The way you move's electric and i'm a circuit
You flow through me like a wave and i gotta surf it
Got aids syphillis and gonorrea
More worms crawling through me than crawling through aailyah
So i'll see ya
Feeling 6th grade cuz I wouldn't wanna be ya
Bing bang bong ding check my onomatopeoia
I don't care if that turns you off or sumthin
There's a million other shorties out there waiting for a humpin
But if you wanna be my main ho, the engine is runnin
