And I'm just Bruce Wayne
I've got some cash
But I gotta up my night game
She needs a Superman
And I'm too Clark Kent
She's got that stamina
All too quick I'm all spent (i come too fast like wally west)
She needs a superman
Stopping bullets blocking spam
He does it all
Even defeats the foot clan
She's got expensive tastes
An absurdly tiny waste
And its like her boobs
Protrude up to her gorgeous face
She's like a barbie doll
Wonder woman bratz child
Its like she can't exist
Like i'm on the x files
Its not a porn flick
But she makes the porn chicks
Look just like the girls
Who were born with no tits
She's ridiculous
Some villains up to vicious tricks
Cuz no girl that looks like this
Means it when she gives me a kiss
Its twisted resistin is overloadin my system
I'm lifted into her mission
Now listen this is my admission
You might also likeShe needs a Batman
And I'm just Bruce Wayne
I've got some cash
But I gotta up my night game
She needs a Superman
And I'm too Clark Kent
She's got mad stamina
I come too fast like wally west
She needs a superdude
A man of steel with an attitude
She needs a hero a zero just will not do
She needs a superguy
Someone who can make her fly
Take her up into the sky
Cuz she's already oh so high
She needs nothing
She's something
She's my sarah ten
And i pretend we're just friends
I'm failing this experiment
Cuz i'm staring at not her eyes
Her spandex suit lets nothing hide
I'm just an average guy
I think i need a new disguise
A new persona
She's my ramona flowers
I suspect she's got powers
She's skating through my mind
When its locked after hours
And then there's my knives chau
The girl i've got now
She'll probably have a cow
And wanna take my new girl down
If we go out and hit the town
She needs a spiderman
And i'm just peter parker
Even with the symbiote
She wants me a little darker
She needs an iron man
And i'm just tony stark
She wants someone to shock her
But i just ain't got that spark
She's needs a superhero
She needs a freak of nature
She needs something special
The average joe just cannot date her
She needs a superboy
A couple clones just to enjoy
That's probably not enough love
She'll probably need a couple toys
She needs a justice league
She needs a whole team
Gather the avengers
She'll take em on at full steam
I'm talking tony and peter and bruce
Steve hank carol jessica drew
She's into girls too
There's nothing she won't do
If you only wanna 3
She'll just laugh kinda sweet
Then she'll start to leave
Telling her no is like pressing control alt delete
Please appease her every whim and request
If you wanna see her breasts
You better have an S on your chest
Cuz she's not into money
She's not into fame
She's into guys
Who are afraid of villians learning their name
You're mr. invisible date
If you ain't got a cape
Normal guys wait
But if you fly, say hi
You cannot escape
She needs her own robin
And I'm just jason todd
Outta my league i can't compete
Yeah i'll be dead on the job
She needs a green lantern
And i'm too hal jordan
She likes me bad, but now i'm good
And i'm kinda boring
She needs a green arrow
But i'm just ollie queen
I got a billion bucks
But thats not her favorite green
She needs the wonder twins
But i'm just plain zan
I can get her wet
But she says she needs another hand

She needs a superman
She needs a batman
