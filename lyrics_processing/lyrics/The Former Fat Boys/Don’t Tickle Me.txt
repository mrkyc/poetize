Who who he he
Hahahaha, hohoho, hehehe
Don't, don't don't tickle me
No, don't tickle me
Hahahaha, hohoho, hehehe
Don't, don't don't tickle me

I turn beats into legends
Of Smith and Wessons
Poppin off, I'm doing sins in sevens
Downing slurpees at 7-Elevens
I'm a touch the heavens
Throw lightning bolts they won't find your remnants
I got the weapons and guns and stuff I'm wearing rubber gloves
I'll shoot you in the face with a gun I don't know the name of
You fucking tickled me first? You picked the fight
You think you wanna play chess, but I'm fucking Chris Night
I'm bored with life, finding myself
Are you prepared if gravity reverses itself
Cause my back packs got jets
They call me sucksex
Straight A's, I think so good
They call me the test
They call you leguizamo cuz you're only a pest
Catch me if you can, cuz I'm out cashing bad checks
Staying two steps a head, my plan is complex
You unleased a monster trying to tickle my chest
You think you're tracks the best, but you're missin' finesse
Like a high school prom with out the sucksex
Like European porn without all the Czech's
So don't tickle me get that in your head
Besides, Corey's funnier tickle him instead
Same name as the Pirate Roberts yo you can call me Dread
My words like iocane powder, defeat your evil
Beat your giant and your Spaniard and all your people
I win land wars in Asia, I'm unbelieveable (OHHH)
Tickle me and get away..nah inconceivable
You might also like
Instrumentally horrendous the way I upend this
You bitches just scream "mother" like that dude from The Misfits
Let's see if this fits
Don't tickle me there
Or you'll go through wall with a long patch of pubic hear
You're a pussy, infected, your bread is done
If you tickle me my stomach there ain't nothing saying love
You treat me like doughboy, I'll gleam like cube
I ain't a boy from the hood but I know what to do
I can tickle Hard Corey but we'll leave it at that
You'll get smacked in time with his 4x4 clap
Stack bodies like Pringles
I can't just pop one
An arsenal of dick and a sawed-off shotgun
I'm a race card you got me in the red
I have to quote Pulp Fiction cause I ain't well-read
This is Saltine's drip to core
I'm a nuclear warhead of common gore
I'm an inconvenient truth like bishop and juice
I'll warmup the block with bullets, and poof

You'll get me shaking and quaking
Twiching and flinching
Michael J. Fox looks like a statue when I'm hit with the tickling
Like an epileptic on crack
There's no turning back, tickle me motherfucker, and I'm kicking your ass
Heroes live on motherfucker, but legends never die
Have you ever danced with the devil in the pale moonlight?
Motivated by vengence I'll get back
Hide under your bed for a late night tickle attack
When I was born the doctor was like "oh shit!"
This kids got a nature to which no nuture would stick
Hanging around in Central Park like its Home Alone 2
With a fat bird lady trying to catch avian flu
And give it to you
Achoo, yeah that's what I'll do
Like Michigan after a loss, staggering yellow and blue
You're green fucker and I'm thinking you gonna puke
Raped so bad you'll think I play for Duke
Revenge is "mmm good" like a can of Campbell's soup
La de da de, who likes to party?
If you tickle FFB we bound to hurt somebody
Le da de de, who likes to party?
If it tickles when you pee something's wrong with your body
