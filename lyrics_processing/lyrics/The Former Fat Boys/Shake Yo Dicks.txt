Shake your junk side to side
Make em wonder if they're ready for a ride
Make all get ready to drop their fly
Make em forget to look you in the eye
Make em bend over and shake their behind
Let em know you ain't lying, shake it with pride
Show off your bulge make em all wanna glide
Cuz time's wastin its half past the hour
Are you prince adam, or do you have the power
Should your be worshiped or are you a bower
Are we talking ranch house or a penthouse tower
Are you gonna come early or will you stay up late
Are you a fuckbuddy or just a first date
Are you some tofu are are you the steak
Cuz if you're the man, let that thing shake
Shake your dicks
Wave your nis
Come move it just like this
Get those dudes
Or grab those chicks
It doesn't matter which
Just make sure you wave it wave it
Swing it like you're naked
If you got a big thing, that's ready for a swing
Just make sure that its shakin
You might also likeSh sh sh sh show them girls
Sh sh sh sh show them boys
If you you got a nice nis
Make them wish
Make em wanna kiss
Make em twitch ooh till they make some noise
Girls wiggle and show them tits
When the boys in the club all shake those dicks
If you got a nice package come on wave that nis
Let me show you how its done come on move like this

When i see a diiiick shaking i wanna take it out
When i see a diiiick shaking i wanna put it in my mouth
When i see a diiiick shaking it makes me wanna shout
When i see a diiiick shakingit makes me start to sprout
So wave your nis like a flag
Straights and gladd
Nothing wrong with that
Shakins the new fad
Gays grab a guy, girls grab a man
Almost said the f word, there cuz it rhymed my bad
I meant no harm, i ain't trying to offend
I'm just a weather girl trying to make it rain men
I'm trying to get britney spears pregnant again
I'm trying to hypnotize your eyes with my shaking lil ben
Come on spray some liquor
Cock it hard and pull the trigger
Bounce around the club like a drunken tigger
Make it bigger, till we all sweat
If you XX you better be erect
Cuz its gonna get intense like camping
Everybody pitch tents and start dancing
If this dance could kill they'd call it manson
Something bout the shake makes ya more handsome
Pants got y'all dicks hostage, someone pay the random
And don't forget to include the chicks
Girls if you're left out just strap on some dicks
And shake sha ke shake shake shake that dildo
And if you got it in your shirt giggle those pillows
Every buffy in the house try kissing a willow
And every guy kinda scared just grab your best bro
March your back pussy's straight to the dance flo
And gay or straight get a little homo
