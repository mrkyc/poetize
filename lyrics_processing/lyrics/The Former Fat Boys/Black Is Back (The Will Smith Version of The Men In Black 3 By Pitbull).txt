Guess you forgot
No fingerprints
You never saw what you saw
Black suits
Ray bans
Alien glee clubs doing dance hands
Don't laugh, this ain't for laughs
The men in black is back to protect the past
Saved the kids, now its boomer moms and dads
With 3D effects like lazer cats
Cuz the a,b,c's of temporal defense
Are just j and k
Can you be that dense
The incredible
Usually inedible
Federal undercover brothers
From other mothers
In general
We always win
We'll do it again
Back to go back to the 60's and defend
Our planet god dammit mib 3
Worth ten bucks even if critics pan it ugggh
