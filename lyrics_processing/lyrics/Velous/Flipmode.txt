Flipmode, Flipmode, (let's go)
Knock it down, fade away
Knock it down, fade away
Flipmode, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Flipmode, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Shoot it, shoot it, knock it down, fade away
Shoot it, shoot it, knock it down, fade away
Told her bust it, bust it, bust it, bust it
Bust it, bust it, bust it like a AK
Told her bust it, bust it, bust it, bust it
Bust it, bust it, bust it like a AK
Told her bust it, bust it, Flipmode
Told her bust it, bust it, Flipmode
Told her bust it, bust it, bust it, bust it
Bust it, bust it, bust it like a AK
Shoot it, shoot it, knock it down, fade away
Shoot it, shoot it, knock it down, fade away

Faded off the woohah
You know I'm faded off the woohah
Bustin', bustin' out the trap
In the coupe doing laps
Got me a Dominican mami
Folding paper, origami
Ragger, ragger on sight
Spliff Star off the hype
Ain't got no time to fall in love
Ain't no time to fall in love
When the push come to shove
Money all I ever love
Gary Payton with the glove
O.J Simpson with the glove
Guilty pleasure, pick your poison
We got all of the above
Shooter, shooters on deck
Still banging with the set
30 thousand in the P.J
Got my niggas out the Jecks
Surfin' through the village, bust it, bust it up
Diamonds on me flooded bust down
Ever since she let me bust it, bust it up
She be wanting me to cuff now, ghost

Told her bust it, bust it, bust it, bust it
Bust it, bust it, bust it like a AK

Bust it, bust it, bust it like a AK
Told her bust it, bust it, Flipmode
Told her bust it, bust it, Flipmode
Told her bust it, bust it, bust it, bust it
Bust it, bust it, bust it like a AK
Shoot it, shoot it, knock it down, fade away

Faded off the woo hah
 faded off the woo hah
Pulling up with the 
All white, hallelujah
Off white, get the mullah
Wrist popping off the arm
Bust it, bust it, bust it, bust down
It was them but it's us now
With my niggas off the 
I got niggas off the grid
We just runnin' up a muck
We just come from the mud
Late minute talking Purple Rain
Talking purple, purple like the Byrd Gang
Talking green, green, green, leprechaun
Red rubies and the lucky charms
We be really on the scene
Balling like I won a ring
Mobbing in the first 
Reppin' like a mascot
Livin' like 

Shoot it, shoot it, knock it down, fade away
Shoot it, shoot it, knock it down, fade away
Told her bust it, bust it, bust it, bust it
