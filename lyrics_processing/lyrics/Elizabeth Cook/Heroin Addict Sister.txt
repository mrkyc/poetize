And a pot of potato soup
She's gonna dry out this time if it kills her
She wants the whole family in the loop
She can outsmart death like a stuntman
She's a cat with 99 lives
She's my heroin addict sister
And I've known her all my life
SHE'S MY HEROIN ADDICT SISTER
AND I HATE TO SEE HER GO
AND I HATE TO SEE HER HOLDIN ON
AT THE END OF THE SAME OLE ROPE
She pushes a tiny needle
It's like the devil's DNA
It takes her somewhere she's just gotta go
But can't afford to stay
She stripped for a while in Connecticut
Got married at least 5 times
Every one of them men was crazy about her
So she married a couple of em twice
She's a certified underwater welder
She can cook, clean, and crochet
She can flash a smile from her sweet weary soul
That'll melt all your doubts away

AND I HATE TO SEE HER GO

AT THE END OF THE SAME OLE ROPE
She's high at the homeless shelter
When she's had it out with my niece
She don't notice the holes in her clothes
Or perverted Orlando police
I've been so mad I wanted to kill her
So worried I had to cry
Such crazy stories I can't help but laugh
So scared of when she's gonna die
She called outside of Atlanta
Been dodging them big ole trucks
Ya know she cleaned up in Tennessee one time before
She just needs a couple hundred bucks
And she just needs to be with us
We all say thank God mama
Ain't here to go through it this time
She's in heaven telling them Macon County cops
Better give her baby a ride
And they got to her just in time
SHE'S MY HEROINE ADDICT SISTER
AND I HATE TO SEE HER GO
AND I HATE TO SEE HER HOLDIN ON
