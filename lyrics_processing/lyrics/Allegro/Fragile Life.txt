Town of shame, you know
Death is all around and it wants another round
The reing of fear has no name and while you try to hide yourself
Away away from them
They know everything about everything
The streets of the town hsd its own rules every night
And all that I want is a better place to hide
Don't you ever think you're safe and sound at home
You know the fear is here
And we all know the rules, we never have a choice
You must learn the brutal lessons of your life alone beware and
Never trust
No one, no way, not even your best friends
And if you sad your sadness will turn to hate
It's out fo control, there's nothing else to be done
We try to find an easy way out for our sins
And things that went wrong
We must try to do our best, we won't take it anymore
Every day avery time the bullers take an innocent child
Do what you want but take caro of your fragile life
You might also likeNight and day we see the blood of lonely
Faces in this town of shame, you know
Death is all around and it wants another round
The reing of fear has no name nad while you try to hide
Yourself away from them
They know everything about everything
The fear in your mind will never protect your life
And all that I wnat is a better place to hide!
Hungry screams are heard at night
And it's so real; it's not only your crazy mind
Selling death, they pay the price
To meet a world that only means blood!
We try to find an easy way out
For our sins and things that went wrong
We must try to do our best, we won't take it anymore
Every day and every time the bullers take an innocent child
