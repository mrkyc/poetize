Everybody wanna ball
Everybody wanna ball
Holla at broads at the mall
Everybody wanna ball
Everybody wanna ball
Everybody wanna ball
Nigga I can't fuck with y'all

I'm still smokin' out, pourin' up
Puttin' dick up in yo' slut
Niggas look, I'm sayin' "what?"
Hustlin' not in a rut
Gettin' down, on the grind
Puttin' meat up in they spine
Young girl lookin' fine
Comin' back with the whole nine
Grip the 'lac, Do the track
Young Goldie off the "Mack"
Hit the sack
Drop 7 grams, watch it bubble back
All heart, never fraud
Only trust in the lord
Never in no (man mouth)
Represent the whole South
Everybody wanna be the boy gettin' rich
Everybody wanna have a bad-ass bitch
Everybody want a 'Lac
Wanna blow the doja sack
Everybody wanna come through with their foot packed

Nigga I can't fuck with y'all

I'm the king pulling the strings, the man behind the man
And the Trillest, swag too it, with Bible in my hand
Representin' for the G's and the real Trill fellas
In the hoods, the barrios, even the favelas
Try to tell us we couldn't do it, don't even try
They almost had me believin' that shit, I won't even lie
I had to look them in the eye to see the hate in their hearts
See everybody can't love you, mane, they're just playing their part
I was taught to play my position and wait for my shot
And when it came, blow the spot, fuck who like it or not
You can't please everybody (no), you might as well please you
And keep it 100 with yourself, just like the G's do
Everybody wanna ball

Nigga I can't fuck with y'all

Everybody wanna have a platinum ass dick
All gold aged pussy, don't you want to break a trick
Don Magic Juan told me to stay true
It's all about the green, not the red or the blue
The lean, flat screens and the disc say "Screw"
Leanin' on the switch, pressin' on your bitch
You don't put no gun to your brother head
Nigga don't put your rubber on like you squeezin' the trigger
On yo' swight, time right
In the dark or the light
BBS prime cuts, 92 karats I'm right
In the prone said link change
Grippin' on the wood grain
Young hoes suckin' on my dick like it's a chicken wing
Everybody wanna ball
Holla at broads at the mall
If he up, watch him fall
Nigga I can't fuck with y'all
Everybody wanna ball
Holla at broads at the mall
If he up, watch him fall
Nigga I can't fuck with y'all
