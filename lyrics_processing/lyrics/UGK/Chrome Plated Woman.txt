Chamillion' gave me the bitch, she was already a star (star)
Now, all these niggas wanna fuck my car
She a video ho, the bitch make big money
Like to let her hair down when the sky get sunny
You can catch her in the Dub or the King magazine ('Zine)
Young red bitch, pussy wet, five screens (Five screens)
Now watch her fat ass drop (Drop)
Fifth pouring out, and the trunk gets popped (Gets popped)
These niggas scheming on my young ho
Niggas so gung-ho, bitch can't let me go (Let me go)
I bring the bitch value up ten times (Ugh)
It's going higher every time I write another line
I get my paper in the streets
Big cocaine, grip grain and pimp the lane (Pimp the lane)
I really miss Robert Davis
I'm repping for you, baby, leave these niggas on the pavement

I got the grill on the front, trunk steady humming
I fell in love with my chrome plated woman
The grill on the front, trunk steady humming
I fell in love with my chrome plated woman
The grill on the front, trunk steady humming
I fell in love with my chrome plated woman
The grill on the front, trunk steady humming
I fell in love with my chrome plated woman

Well, let me introduce you to the baddest bitch alive
Can't nothing fuck with her (With her) when I put her in drive
Other hoes got four shoes, but mine got five (she got five)
And got the hood buzzing like a beehive
She's immaculately dressed, with good hygiene
Take a bath everyday, 'cause she gots to stay clean
I wipe her down slow with a real soft rag
Now, she looking so good (Good) a nigga gots to brag (I gots to brag)
When we pull up, my nigga, we stop to show
You'll probably kill yourself when you see the suicide doors
In the summertime, she might come outside without a top (Without a top)
And one look'll make a nigga mouth drop (Your mouth drop)
We don't stop, we keep it rollin like a ball
With a bitch this bad, how could a nigga take a fall?
Naww, she ain't for y'all, you gots to get your own
Just make sure that she's covered in chrome, c'mon

I got the grill on the front, trunk steady humming

The grill on the front, trunk steady humming
I fell in love with my chrome plated woman
The grill on the front, trunk steady humming
I fell in love with my chrome plated woman
The grill on the front, trunk steady humming
I fell in love with my chrome plated woman
On the highway (Way), living the fly way (Fly way)
Bitch on my hood, guidin my way (Ugh)
Money on the nightstand, never did lay (Lay)
True to the game, I put that on P.A
P.A., still gettin sucked under the streetlights (Ugh)
And nigga, it sure feel good when you're living right (Living right)
Eating right (Eating right), fucking right (Ugh)
Steady pimping bitches through my website

So get your head right (Head right)
And get your bread right (Bread right)
'Cause babygirl'll hit you in your chest dead right
Have it on your mind 'cause she'll put it in your heart
The game'll be over 'fore the motor even start
With the brand new parts, (What?) got them boys erupting
But don't call it plastic surgery, it's body sculpting
Take a old school classic, give it new car scent
And then, I don't regret one motherfucking dollar I spent, mayne

I got the grill on the front, trunk steady humming
I fell in love with my chrome plated woman
The grill on the front, trunk steady humming
I fell in love with my chrome plated woman
The grill on the front, trunk steady humming
I fell in love with my chrome plated woman
