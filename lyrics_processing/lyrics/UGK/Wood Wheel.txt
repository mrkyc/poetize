Whaaat
Smoke somethin', bitch...smoke somethin'...

I'm up early cause my nigga
Don't sell dope after night time
Love choppin' blades, rollin' hooptie
'N move the dope through the pipeline
Pimp C, bitch...holla at yo' bitch
Now yo' bitch on my team;
Got her buyin' us sticky green
Lace some with promythazine
Candy sweets, a candy bitch
You lookin' at a candy boy
I done came down Main and popped trunk;
Hit the switch on my candy toy
We all young ghetto boys
That's why we act this way
Tryin' to see a million dollars
Hopin' these niggas don't blast today

Pro smoke, pro choke
Anti-broke, conservative liberal
Left-wing slangin', right-wing hangin'
In criminal court, it's civil
In the middle of reality
Unsolved mysteries riddle
Knockin' over fat cats
And gettin' my dogs some bits and kibbles
On note pads I scribble
Write rippers that'll make you think
Snap so hard it'll break your synchronicity
Fuck it, take a drink
I fake it, blink 'n poof
We disappearin' into a shroud of dojer
Cloud composures, all-nighters it's like Folger's
But, bitch, I tried to told ya
You might also like
Rollin' Seville, grippin' my steel
Might pop a pill, bitch, I'm workin' wood wheel
Sedan DeVille, house on the hill
Countin' up my scrill, bitch, I'm workin' wood wheel
Nigga, how you feel? I feel so trill
Might pop me a pill, bitch, I'm workin' wood wheel
House on the hill, marijuana fields
Grippin' my steel, bitch, I'm workin' wood wheel

They tellin' me, "Bun don't go there"
But, man, I just gots to bring it
These niggas, they wanna hate on that Texas
But scared to sing it
They don't know what that star 'bout
They don't know what that barre 'bout
They don't know what that candy car 'bout
Or smokin' that jar 'bout
All they know is what the fuck I tell 'em
Or what the fuck we sell 'em
Smokin' Swishers, wood grain
And leavin' stains on cerebellums
Rebellum, propell 'em, gel 'em
From P.A. to Deep Ellum
Tell 'em I tol' 'em
Wrote 'em, fuck it, phone 'em
To hell to heaven
I just spent 60 G's
On a brand new Eldo-reeze:
Black-on-black, drop top 'lac;
Northstar fifth wheel on back
Sometimes I feel like Lil' Ke
When my trunk steady hummin'
Had to leave my bitch
Cause I fell in love with my chrome-plated woman
I love my wood wheel Grant
'84 Cadillacs that slant
Slowed-down Screw tapes that knock
Blowin' on Green private stock
Bitch, I don't eat hamhock
Try 20-ounce Angus beef
Hangin' with young niggas, that pack big triggas
'N got big-ass diamonds off in they teeth

Fifth wheel and grill, Candy Seville
Might pop a pill, bitch, I'm workin' wood wheel
House on the hill, still flexin' mills
Countin' up my scrills, bitch, I'm workin' wood wheel
Comin' down so trill; nigga, how you feel?
Might pop a pill, bitch, I'm workin' wood wheel
Grippin' the steal, nigga, I'm so real
Bitch, how you feel? Nigga, I'm workin' wood wheel
Smokin' on bionic, bubonic, chronic, it's so ironic
Sippin' gin and tonic: supersonic like Johnny Mneumonic
We crash your party, piss on your parade
Sip syrup like it's Lemonade
From Paris to the Palisades to the Prominade
Bomb and fade, closes the car, break worlds, it's plain as day
That's the game we came to play
It don't change, ain't a thang to say

It's goin' down in the H-Town
Young playa from the South 'bout to blaze a pound
Tryin' to find me a bopp with some good mouth
I know you freaky bitches know what I'm talkin' 'bout
Ain't got no time to play, girl
Let me get a little throat and some good skull'
Bitch, didn't you know who the fuck I was
Off in the street, lookin' for the good stuff?
Bitch, I don't give a fuck about yo' man, so
Bitch tryin' to fuck fast, I'mma fuck slow
How the fuck you're gonna out-fuck James, ho?
Like Teddy Pendergrass, you better let it go

Gettin' ready fo' head doctors, show shockers
Body rockers, late-night do' knockers
Gotta break us off big pimpin', baby, we ho clockers
Bitch bosses, takin' no losses, best go ask aks Lil' Wee-wee
Been I-T, yo, we crack a danger ray about big Pee Wee
Baby brother, Sweet James Jones: guerilla pimpin' at its finest
Leavin' haters and ho-hustlers behind us, rewind us

Touched like Midas, these bitch-ass niggas they study and bite us
Couldn't not recite us, come to our show
And bitch niggas try to fight us
Ho niggas scream and talk, trill niggas bust and leave
How the fuck you're gonna go to war
When you bitch-ass niggas ain't got no cheese?

Blowin' big kill, Million-dollar deals
Nigga, I'm so trill, bitch, I'm workin' wood wheel

Uh...puttin' down one time for the king, Lil' J
