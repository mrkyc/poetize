It is just not the same
I made a lot of change
Think what you wanna think
I'm doing better now
Look how it's turning on
I made a turn around
She's one of many you heard about
Back in the days when I worked at the Days Inn
Your daddy you hated said I'll never make it
Now I'm making payments, now you make a paycheck
Now look who's impatient
And tables you waitin'
I tried to tell'em but they never listened
So now when they call me, I tell them I missed it
I don't need provisions
I don't need permission
And now that I'm winning
They all see the vision
You've been forgiven
I will not forget it
Said it I made it
Always remember
You've been forgiven
I will not forget it
Said it I made it
Always remember
You might also likeI'm thankful for lessons you taught me 'bout life
And the way that these women work
It was never 'bout love
If it was then the rest of my life would be spent with her
When I come in town
Oh, she down I'm around
Boy, you might get your feelings hurt
She don't fucking care 'bout the love that you share
All the flowers you sent to her
They switch it up when they seen it you up
When they see what you've done
And how far that you've come
Act like the friendship is something it isn't
They start acting different, I know what they want
My ex is my ex for a reason
The team is for maybe next season
At least you had me to believe it
Let that sink in
You've been forgiven
I will not forget it
Said it I made it
Always remember
You've been forgiven
I will not forget it
Said it I made it
