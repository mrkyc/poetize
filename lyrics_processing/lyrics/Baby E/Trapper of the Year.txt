It's Baby E on the track

Trapper of the year and my heart got broken
Wiping my tears with a brand new Rolex
Money coming in my heart got stolen
Had to go and get the AP frozen
Trapper of the year and my heart got broken
Wiping my tears with a brand new Rolex
Money coming in my heart got stolen
Had to go and get the AP frozen

I can't buy love
I can't buy love
I can't buy love
Had to go and get the AP frozen
I can't buy love
I can't buy love
I can't buy love
Had to go and get the AP frozen

Bars for the low, got drugs for sale
If you don't have lot you got nothing else
Duffel in the drop got it from Chanel
If you can't love me I gotta love myself
Driving in the rain and I crash the foreign
Wearing six rings like I'm Michael Jordan

Money in the safe and it's talking dirty
Shorty left me and it really hurt me
I got my grill in
I'm in my feelings
Whole lot of gang shit
I miss my main chick

Wiping my tears with a brand new Rolex

Had to go and get the AP frozen

Looking like a star so I wish them well
We're hitting hard like the NFL
Jeans hang low see the Gucci belt
Choppa with the scope but I miss her still
Married to the game and I can't divorce it
Jellos on my feet baby these ain't Forces

Money in the safe and it's talking dirty
Shorty left me and it really hurt me
I got my grill in
I'm in my feelings
Whole lot of gang shit
I miss my main chick
