Extender on my side, I'm shooting 30 times
I had to do some things to get it certified
Let ma mama fix you got a dirty mind
Step out in Evisu like a turbine
I pop out on in bitches in a hunnid bands
This song shit ridiculous, get them rubber bands
Birkins on my bitches, runnin' up again
I've been getting digits, she in love with them
Bitch I'm, tatted, up
Run the bands, run the bands up
She gon', back it, up
Hunnid band, hunnid band love
Shorty on geek, geek
(Shorty on geek, geek)
Probably on repeat
(Probably on repeat)
Diamonds on wifi
