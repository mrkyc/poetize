God, at least a hundred times
She won't leave me alone
And I know she wants to fight
But I don't want the drama
So, I just let it ring
Told her, save it for her mama
And drop the hippie scenes
Girl, you need stop trippin', trippin', trippin', trippin', trippin'
Out on me
Man, these bitches been trippin', trippin', trippin', trippin', trippin'
Out on me
You get on my nerves
The way you fussin' me and you fight with me
And you try to be my mother sometimes
You know I don't deserve
The stuff you say to me when you mad at me
Stop askin' me them questions like I'm lyin'
'Cause this ain't gonna work out
If you can't trust me
'Cause what's love, then?
Pretty much nothin'
Is it really worth losin' me
All because of little insecurity?
One minute she'll be sendin' that breakup text
Next me minute we'll be havin' that makeup sex

God, at least a hundred times
She won't leave me alone
And I know she wants to fight
But I don't want the drama
So, I just let it ring
Told her, save it for her mama
And drop the hippie scenes
Girl, you need stop trippin', trippin', trippin', trippin', trippin'
Out on me
Man, these bitches been trippin', trippin', trippin', trippin', trippin'
Out on me
You actin' brand new on me
When I'm trynna be the reason we can work it out
But you just wanna fight
I don't know what to do
I tried everything but a wedding ring
But that might just be a futile fight
Baby, why you wanna do me dirty, yeah?
You know I'm bed drunk
My Facebook, my Twitter, my cellphone
You know I'm a man
What the hell is wrong with you?
Baby, you know what you doin' to me
I'm losing my mind when I'm alone in my sleep
You drivin' me crazy
She's blowin' on my phone
God, at least a hundred times
She won't leave me alone
And I know she wants to fight
But I don't want the drama
So, I just let it ring
Told her, save it for her mama
And drop the hippie scenes
Girl, you need stop trippin', trippin', trippin', trippin', trippin'
Out on me
Man, these bitches been trippin', trippin', trippin', trippin', trippin'
Out on me
