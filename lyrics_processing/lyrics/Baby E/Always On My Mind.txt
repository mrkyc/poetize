Take a breath and take it easy
And believe me when i say
You don't need it, if you leave it
Everything will be okay
You'll be gone, and they'll be sorry
You'll be strong and they will cave
You'll be on, and they'll be calling
You'll live on a better day

You're way too beautiful
Take the old you and have a funeral
Make a bold move and try movin' on
Pick up the pieces and prove them wrong
Go show them people who you really are
You don't get to use an excuse anymore
I won't get to kick it with you anymore
I'll always be here and you know who to call

You do your thing, don't lose your way
Just use your pain for goodness sake
I see the light inside your eyes
I know that i would find a way

(yeah)

Make a choice and make a statement
You'll be patient, things will change
I can feel it, keep it real
And everything will be okay
It's your time and it's your moment
If you want it it will come
Just forgive yourself and then rebuild the damage you have done
