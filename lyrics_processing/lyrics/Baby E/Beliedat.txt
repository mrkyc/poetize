Hey, yeah
Hey, yeah

Mama had to work a lot
And daddy was a criminal
I grew up in a trailer park
With dreams of fucking centerfolds
So woke up with the perfect plot
Then make it to the other side
I learn to work with what I got
Cause all I've ever had was I
Pretty soon I'll be a millionaire
Give you every single thing you thought you'd never have
We'll buy diamond rings and drive a Cadillac
Take you shopping on 5th and put a mink on your back

Hope and pray but swear to God I'm 'bout to testify
If I'm 'bout to tell a lie, then strike me dead tonight
They would never say "I quit" until the day that I die
And if I never really win, I gave it all that I've got
Ready to die, gonna repeat
Maybe he's right it was all just a dream
Maybe I'm wrong and then I start to think
We all got a song that we all want to sing
So sing, what's holding you back?
I told you there's no looking back
Who gives a fuck about how they react
Because if you do then you'll fall through the crack

I took everything I had in one bag and left Florida
A dollar and a dream to make a name in California
Grindin' like the gears of the machinery
Car ain't got no gas, but shit at least I can still sleep in it
(Beliedat) I can feel the changes, I can feel it coming
(Beliedat) They'll know what my name is
I would never break my promise
