I know, sometimes it gets hard
I know, sometimes it gets hard
I know, sometimes it gets hard
I know, I know

We've both been through a lot
Just getting back into the swing of things
We talk about it all the time
We take it slow, and that's okay with me
You kiss me like you mean it
And you fuck me like you need it
And you tell me that your day was great
And you tell me I'm the reason
When it's good it's good, when it's bad it suck
I yell and scream, and getting mad as fuck
I start to think I've had enough
I can't do this thing with that lack of trust
If loyalty is royalty then show me you are a queen
I don't need the player, I just hate it when they cheat
Something tells me to put faith in you
And it was worth it, if i ended up hating you

I'm feeling us (12x)
Don't let me down
Sugar don't let me down
Sugar don't let me down
Don't let me down, no
Don't let me down
Sugar don't let me down
I'm feeling us (5x)
Sugar don't let me down
I'm feeling us (3x)
Don't let me down, no
I'm feeling us (4x)

Out here in Hollywood
With all these rappers, and actors they trying use all their tactics, they tell you you a attractive
You know it's obvious
I hope you never get blinded by fake ass jewelry and diamonds and rental cars that they driving
It all fake
And don't you fall for them rumors, them kind of
Thoughts will consume you
Relationships they get ruined
When either side starts assuming
And we both jump to conclusions
Or I can't take the confusing
You got your chance
Don't you lose it, girl

I'm feeling us (12x)
Don't let me down
Sugar don't let me down
Sugar don't let me down
Don't let me down, no
Don't let me down
Sugar don't let me down
I'm feeling us (5x)
Sugar don't let me down
I'm feeling us (3x)
Don't let me down, no
I'm feeling us (4x)
