Yeah
It's Baby E on the track
Yeah
Sing

Trapping getting old so I've been moving weight
Pigeons in the trunk, I'm on the interstate
Made myself a plug, get it a 100 ways
And I still got the act, you know I love the taste
Spendin' dirty money at the gucci store
Fucking with them models, eating sushi rolls
She think I'm a rapper, get that groupie love
Baby mama mad, she see me moving up

On to bigger better things, bigger television screens
That I'll never get to see, cus I'm to heavy in these streets
I just blew a 100 thou, so I'm going out of town
And Imma try to make it all right (Back)

Finessin, finessin I be finessin
Finessin, finessin I be finessin
Finessin, finessin I be finessin
Finessin, finessin I be finessin

Jay get home in June and we can hardly wait
Caught him with the work and sent him off to state
Wanna play the game it's just a risk you take
My doggie held it down, he never said a name
Sorry my new bitches make you insecure
Sorry for the party and the Swisher smoke
No really I'm just kidding I don't give a fuck
I'm glad it makes you mad to see the kid is up
On to bigger better things, bigger television screens
That I'll never get to see, cus I'm to heavy in these streets
I just blew a 100 thou, so I'm going out of town
And Imma try to make it all right (Back)

Finessin, finessin I be finessin
Finessin, finessin I be finessin
Finessin, finessin I be finessin
Finessin, finessin I be finessin
