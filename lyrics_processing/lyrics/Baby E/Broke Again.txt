Back-back in school I used to hate all of the rich kids
I'd always fight them in the halls and get suspended
Growing up I always felt like such a misfit
Now I celebrate the fact that I was different
From good will to the Gucci stuff
All the honeys used to diss me, now they they're groupies all
Homie, I was writing rhymes in the cubicles
Tell em now I'm just somebody that you used to know, woo!
Cruising in the Cadillac, rolling down sunsets
On so many drugs you think I'm listening to dubstep
Feeling super faded we ain't even hit the club yet
Voices in my head are asking if we're having fun yet
This feeling ain't the kind you can describe
Just a moment, you'll remember as the others pass you by
You never know when there could be a time
So we might as well just celebrate the night

We popping champagne
Like we just won the ring
Only look how far we came
Throw some money, make it rain
We work so hard, we deserve this shit
When you see me at the top, just know

I made a promise to myself
I will never be broke again!
I will never be broke again!
I made a promise to myself
I will never be broke again!
I will never be broke again!
I made a promise to myself

I'mma move my grandma out the trailer park
I'mma buy my baby girl a brand new car
Momma, you can tell your home girls, I blessed you all
And no longer have to tell em how upset you are
It's like I'm on the road, the success stuck in traffic
World in my hands, but I can't seem to grasp it
I'm taking what I want, don't need permission, I ain't asking
Fuck-fucking with my money it's how you end up with your ass kicked
Yeah, I got shit to do
I-I-I call being broke being miserable
Being broke don't mean you ain't fixable
Cause it ain't about the money, it's the principle
This feeling ain't the kind you can describe
Just a moment, you'll remember as the others pass you by
You never know when there could be a time
So we might as well just celebrate the night
We popping champagne
Like we just won the ring
Only look how far we came
Throw some money, make it rain
We work so hard, we deserve this shit
When you see me at the top, just know

I made a promise to myself
I will never be broke again!
I will never be broke again!
I made a promise to myself
I will never be broke again!
I will never be broke again!
I made a promise to myself
I made a promise to myself
I will never be broke again!
I will never be broke again!
I made a promise to myself
I will never be broke again!
I will never be broke again!
