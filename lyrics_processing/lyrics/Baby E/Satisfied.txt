Kinda funny how we met
Shoutout to the internet
I'm at 616
Send a text when you make it to the steps
I'mma pour a lil cognac
Baby girl you know I'm on that
We can smoke a little weed too, shawty
But it's only if you even really want it

Got the body of the goddess
That's me bein' modest
Girl them pigs don't fly
And them hips don't lie and that's
That's you being honest, okay
And your ears took a journey
Baby girl I know you heard me
'Cause your eyes roll back
And you arch your back
And you say you need to leave at 10:30

She said we need a soundtrack for this
So she opened up my iTunes
And she made a new playlist
She said I'mma take it from the top
Just ride the beat on top of me
Do everything but stop

She like that rock and roll
That James Dean
She like them slow jams
She's having anything
She like that deep and slow
That 808
She like that Barry White
I keep her satisfied
I, I keep her satisfied
I, I keep her satisfied
I keep her satisfied, yeah
I, I keep her satisfied
I, I keep her satisfied
I keep, keep her satisfied
I keep her satisfied

Got her layin' in my bed
Got her legs around my neck
I be kissin' on the flower
Got her petal soakin' wet
Make her tell me how'd she want it
Gettin' lost in the moment
And I know I do it right
Cause your legs get tight
And I barely even get to hear you moanin'
She came twice from foreplay
She taste like some sorbet
That's sorbet is gourmet
I beat that like a court case
Out of all he sex that I've ever had
Baby you're the best that I've ever had
You're heaven sent, got angel wings
I hit the note and I make you sing
We need a soundtrack for this
So she opened up my iTunes
And she made a new playlist
She said I'mma take it from the top
Just ride the beat on top of me
Do everything but stop

She's down with anything
She like it deep and slow

I keep her satisfied

I, I keep her satisfied
I keep her satisfied, yeah
I, I keep her satisfied
I, I keep her satisfied
I keep, keep her satisfied
I keep her satisfied

Heart racing
Legs shaking
Bed soakin'
She ain't faking
She can barely take it
We just laying naked
I keep her body satisfied and
She appreciate it
That rock and roll

She like them slow jams
She's down for anything
She like that deep and slow
That 808
She like that Barry White
