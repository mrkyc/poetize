This is a stick up, stick up
I'm here for no liquor, liquor
Put the money in the bank
And I might not have to make the forty go bang
On the floor, on the floor
Don't make a move, you know how this shit goes
Give me all the cash
And I might not have to make the forty go bang

Gotta get it even if it is in the worst way
Gotta pay the rent by Thursday
Really hope you understand
Now put the money in my

Nobody has to get hurt
Nobody has to get hurt
Nobody has to get hurt
Nobody has to get hurt
Nobody has to get hurt
Put the money in the bag and I'll go
Nobody has to get hurt
Nobody has to get hurt
You might also like
No, I don't fuck up, fucked up
You call the cops, call me motherfucker
You can't see me do the math
And you know that I'ma leave through the back
I see the lights, see the lights
As I flee to the streets and I high
Got money in the bag
And I might not have to make the forty go bang

Gotta get it even if it is in the worst way
Gotta pay the rent by Thursday
Really hope you understand
Now put the money in my

Nobody has to get hurt
Nobody has to get hurt
Nobody has to get hurt
Nobody has to get hurt
Nobody has to get hurt
Put the money in the bag and I'll go
Nobody has to get hurt
Nobody has to get hurt
Nobody has to get hurt
Nobody has to get hurt
Nobody has to get hurt
Nobody has to get hurt
Nobody has to get hurt
Put the money in the bag and I'll go
Nobody has to get hurt
