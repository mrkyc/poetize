Now I'm chillin' with my latest ex
I should've never read the fuckin' text
This feeling here is too familiar
Put them notes drugs down, baby girl, them pills'll kill ya
We're sippin' wine and askin' questions
Don't remind me, by now you'd think I'd learn my lesson
She's a mess, I'm a nervous wreck
She rubs my back and starts to kiss my neck
For some reason I can't look her in her eyes
I just stare at shadows dancing in the candlelight
I feel her touch, her hands are cold
The music plays, her door is closed
Now we're lying naked in the sheets
My conscious screams, "get dressed and leave"
I have to stay, I have to know
I have to have my closure, then I'll let you go

Yeah, I'm single
She still seems to be the only thing that I can think of
I was trippin' on somethin', sipped too much of somethin'
I got caught up in the moment, did the last thing that I wanted
Last night
Yeah, I'm single; yeah, I'm single
I was trippin' on somethin', sipped too much of somethin'
I got caught up in the moment, did the last thing that I wanted
Last night

She makes me mad so I make her hate me
But if you knew what she put me through, you wouldn't blame me
We were young, just kids in love
We would scream into the phone until we had enough
I always had a feeling things would never last
For some reason, I can't leave you in my past
I was on the road, she was gettin' lonely
I even had to hear the rumors from my fuckin' homies
That's something there I can't forgive
And sure as hell I won't forget
But it's cool, I'm over it
Just know that things will never ever be the same again
It's such a shame how it had to end
Really wish it could've been different
Your first love, it never dies
But somebody tell them hoes I'm single for the night
