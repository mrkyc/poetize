Changin' things that I think about
Change the way that I view the world
Change the way that I view you, girl
Back when I was struggling
Fucked around with other men
You will never know my love again
You know it's all because
You started dancing, what a shame
Baby girl, work dat ass, click them heels
Work the pose, you can pay them bills
Leave a message at the tone
Take the hint and let it go, yeah
Take the hint and let it go, yeah
You only call me (you only call me)
When you need me (when you need me)
When you want it (when you want it)
When you finesse (when you finesse)
For that good love (for that good love)
I'm so glad I'm out of town (I'm so glad I'm out of town)
'Cause you only call me ('cause you only call me)
When you need me (when you need me)
You need me, yeah
She said, "You kissable and quiet
You read me like a psychic
And you're the only one
Who really knows just how I like it"
Said.."You're wasted I can hear it
Just call me back tomorrow"
Then things got really awkward
And I was in my castle
I couldn't really hear her
Just know that she was cryin'
She told me she was sorry
Just know that she was tryin'
I lied and said I noticed
Pretended I was happy
I'm tryin' stayin' focused
But she don't wanna let me
You might also likeNo
I won't let you bring me down
No
You only call me (you only call me)
When you need me (when you need me)
When you want it (when you want it)
When you finesse (when you finesse)
For that good love (for that good love)
I'm so glad I'm out of town (I'm so glad I'm out of town)
'Cause you only call me ('cause you only call me)
