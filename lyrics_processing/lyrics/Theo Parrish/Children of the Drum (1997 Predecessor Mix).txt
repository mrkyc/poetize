Our time has come
To come together and take over
And it's not those who move in expectation in attaining the goal of meditation and harmonize
Children of the drum
Strive to still all the thoughts
Make mind
One point still jointed
In its heart is pure
The cure for the restless souls
Restless natives
And heartbeats
Speaks of true tongue natives
Native sun
Calms body
Clears mind
Free Body
Free Mind
Ritual and sacrifice
True medicine
And pure healing
And soul is beyond
We're one unravelling our threads the external is dead
You might also likeWe're are Children of the Drum
Our gathering freedom in our harmony pulse 
To instinctual creation
Meditating in a grasp
Challenging the Freedom
Pure Rythm that dips and sways and lips waves of infinite Joy  Caressed by the Sun shook by the source 
Children of the Drum
In a  from the Sky
Re-harmonize in Freedom in Pulsating Freedom
For time is a construct designed to conduct our body
No body hold In Space
Pushing space to hold freedom from this
And a fire cover from the smoke
 The token mirror obscured by dust
The trusted embryo resting deep in the womb
The tomb of Knowledge is hidden by selfish desires
Take me higher freedom from pain
Take my higher freedom from pain
Take me home
Make me one
Take me home beauties from the Sun
Take me home children from the drum
Take me home
Children of the Drum

Take my higher freedom from pain
Take me home
Make me one
Take me home beauties from the Sun
Take me home children from the drum
Take me home

We're are children of the drum
