Tried to master me with his stop and go
Do you want to control me
Cause i serve the only
Do you want to control me
Tried to master me with his stop and go
Would you like to control me
Now the beat starts to mold me
Do you want to control me
If you want to know me
You just flow through me
Do you want to control me
Do-you-want to con-trol me, yeah
Don't get up too close to me
Do you want to control me
Like the drummer can groove move me
Know i serve the only, yeah
Only the drummer can move me
Said a new day is coming, hey
All of this and now nothing
Move groove
Control me
Do you feel how it moves me
Only the DJ can groove me
Don't you see how it grooves me
Ain't nobody can fool me
You might also likeNow he has control of my soul
In a way i think the DJ knows
Dictate the mood with the beat
The beat owns my feet
Do you want to control me
'Cause i serve the only
The beat makes me lonely
There's a brighter day coming
Where the beat will make you something
Do you like to control me
I serve the only
Know i serve the only
Heard i serve the only
Take the beat and i'm lonely
Rushin' like a train on me
I can feel it like a rocket
Keeps you moving and i can't say no
When i woke last night i was OK
But the beat made me feel a certain way
DJ controls my very soul
And it's almost like remote control
Would you like to control me
People hit the ground runnin'
Love it, yeah, yeah, yeah
Can't you feel the pressure coming
