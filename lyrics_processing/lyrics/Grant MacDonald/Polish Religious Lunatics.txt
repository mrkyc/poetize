In Warsaw, Poland
A Polish presidential prick
Against the gay community
With his evil religious bullshit?
We the gay people of the world
Stand up for love and dignity and respect
Our religious lunatic, suppressing our love
Based on a cult of hate
Should be stopped in its track
Religious bullshit from Leviticus with the Torah
An Old Testament against gays
Started by man's evil fallacy of religious filth
Polish homophobic witchcraft
Spread from Washington
And America's corrupt churches throughout the world
Based on hate
We the gay people love
And will love who we may
And no religious lunatics will ever stop our love
Go fuck yourself, Polish president
And the Tony Perkins of the world
Polish president Duda, a fucking prick
Look up the word evil, in the dictionary
And you'll see the picture of President Duda
You fucking scum
You might also likeWe are the he and she of two spirits
As seen by the First Nations, aboriginal peoples
With love and respect and dignity
The Polish president is a fucking prick
And a lunatic
We shall love who we wanna love
Holy faux, here we go
Time to cut to the chase, bro
The pope and religion are oh so faux
Time to give religion the old heave-ho
The old death blow
We'll get back to the days of the Pharoah
Religious lunatics are wacko
In their own hell-ville wallow
Telling us what's a no no, as if they know
Stringing their evil lingo
Holy faux, holy faux, holy faux
Oh no, no, no, no
Religious fanatics are schizos
Running a fake sideshow
Woe woe woe
Holy foe, it's time for a veto
Treating others like a weirdo
It's religion, that's really psycho
Time to change from the days of holy faux, holy faux, holy faux
Religion is nothing more than bogus hocus pocus
Christianity is a 2012 year old cult
Constantine's insult
Leviticus 18:22's hatred applied to priestly rules
Never meant to apply for schools
It does nothing but manipulate us
It's only good for the brainless
To believe in such a cult
Hatefulness is the final result
Religion is bogus hocus pocus
Just a big manipulative business
The pope and preachers are heartless
Such fiction like Judas is total madness
It ends up noxious
The preachers of such drivel are ruthless
To abuse gays, it's shameless
Religion is based on ignorant rudeness
Religion is baseless
Religion is monstrous, such fiction
Like Moses is larcenous, claimless, and baseless
Bogus, hocus pocus
We shall love who we wanna love with dignity and respect
Polish lunatic president, religious lunatic arsehole
Go fuck yourself
We shall love who we wanna love
You fucking prick
Political religious lunatic dick
We are proud of who we love
We are proud of our love
And we shall love and love and love
Yo, what do we see
In Warsaw, Poland
A Polish presidential prick
Against the gay community
With his evil religious bullshit?
We the gay people of the world
Stand up for love and dignity and respect
Our religious lunatic, suppressing our love
Based on a cult of hate
