When I get home from work
I wanna wrap myself around you
I wanna take you and squeeze you
'Til the passion starts to rise

I wanna take you to heaven
That would make my day complete

But you and me ain't no movie stars
What we are is what we are
We share a bed, some lovin' and TV, yeah
And that's enough for a workin' man
What I am is what I am
And I tell you, babe, well that's enough for me

Sometimes when you're asleep
And I'm just starin' at the ceiling
I wanna reach out and touch you
But you just go on dreamin'

If I could take you to heaven
That would make my day complete

'Cause that's enough for a workin' man

And I tell you, sweetheart, that's just enough for me


You and me ain't no superstars
What we are is what we are
We share a bed, some popcorn and TV, yeah
And that's enough for a workin' man
What I am is what I am
And I tell you, babe, you're just enough for me

When I get home from work
I wanna wrap myself around you
I'd like to hold you, squeeze you
'Til the passion starts to rise

I wanna take you to heaven

We share a bed, some lovin' and TV, yeah
And that's enough for a workin' man
