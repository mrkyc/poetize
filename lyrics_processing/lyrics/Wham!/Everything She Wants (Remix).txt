Uh, huh-huh
Ohhh yeah
Work, work

Somebody told me
"Boy, everything she wants, is everything she sees"
I guess I must have loved you
Because I said you were the perfect girl for me, maybe
And now we're six months older
And everything you want, and everything you see
Is out of reach, not good enough
I don't know what the hell you want from me, oh

Uh-huh, uh-huh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Ah-ha, ah-ha, doo doo doo
La, la, la, la-la
Uh-huh, uh-huh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Ah-ha, ah-ha, doo doo doo
La, la, la, la-la

Somebody tell me, oh (Won't you tell me?)
Why I work so hard for you?
(Give you money, work to give you money)
Oh
You might also like
Some people work for a living
Some people work for fun
Girl, I just work for you
They told me marriage was a give and take
Well you've shown me you can take
You've got some giving to do
And now you tell me that you're having my baby
I'll tell you that I'm happy if you want me to
But one step further, and my back will break
If my best isn't good enough
Then how can it be good enough for two?

Uh-huh, uh-huh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Ah-ha, ah-ha, doo doo doo
I can't work any harder than I do (La, la, la, la-la)
Uh-huh, uh-huh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Ah-ha, ah-ha, doo doo doo
La, la, la, la-la

Somebody tell me, oh (Won't you tell me?)
Why I work so hard for you?
(Give you money) All to give you money
Oh

Oh!, why do, I do the things I do?
I'd tell you if I knew
My God, I don't even think that I love you (La, la, la, la-la)
(Won't you tell me?)
(Give you money, work to give you money)
Oh
Oh ohh, oh yeah
Tell me, tell me

How could you settle for a boy like me?
When all I could see was the end of the week
All the things we sign
And the things we buy
Ain't gonna keep us together
It's just a matter of time
My situation, never changes
Walking in, and out of that door
Like a stranger, but the wages
I give you all, you say you want more
And all I can see was the end of the week
All the things we sign
And the things we buy
Ain't gonna keep us together
Girl, it's just a matter of time
Work, work
La, la, la, la-la
(It's just a matter of time)
Uh-huh, uh-huh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Ah-ha, ah-ha, doo doo doo
La, la, la, la-la
Somebody tell me, oh (Won't you tell me?)
Somebody
Why I work so hard for you?
(Give you money) All to give you money
Oh
Somebody tell me, oh (Won't you tell me?)
Why I work so hard for you?
(Give you money) All to give you money (La, la, la, la-la)
Somebody tell me (Won't you tell me?)
Won't people tell me?
Why I do the things that I do?
