And every day, I seem to laugh a little less
Living this way, it seems my sky's a little darker
You went away and left me lonely in success
Can't you see I'm falling apart?
Can't you see I'm falling apart?
Can't you see?
Can't you see I'm falling apart?
Can't you see I'm falling apart?
Can't you see what's happenin' to me?
Take this hand and show my fingers where my heart is
Understand, you may just save me from despair
Watch this man, you'll see he can't stop what he has started
Take this hand, you'll see right now there's no-one there
Can't you see I'm falling apart?
You laugh at me as I fall
Can't you see I'm falling apart?
Just tell me, tell me, give me one good reason
Armed with love, I could save my heart
But on my own I just can't make it
I'm too weak to fight, so take it
Armed with love, I could save my heart
But instead I watch you die
Armed with love, I could save my heart
But on my own I just can't make it
I'm too weak to fight, so take it
Armed with love, I could save my heart
But instead I watch you die
Can't you see I'm falling apart?
Can't you see I'm falling apart?
Tell me why, why, why
Can't you see I'm falling apart?
Can't you see I'm falling apart?
Can't you see I'm falling apart?
Can't you see I'm falling apart?
Can't you see I'm falling apart?
Can't you see I'm falling apart?
Can't you see, can't you see
Can't you see me?
Armed with love, I could save my heart
But on my own I just can't make it
I'm too weak to fight, so take it
Armed with love, I could save my heart
Tell me why am I so blue?
Armed with love, I could save my heart
On my own I just can't make it
I'm too weak to fight, so take it
