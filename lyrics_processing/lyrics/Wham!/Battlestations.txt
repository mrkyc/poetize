You ask too much of me
You try my patience
Your tongue, it's like a razor
You choose your words like weapons
Here we go, battlestations
I never have the guts to let you look inside
I don't think you'd appreciate the things that I hide
Monday was the worst day
And Friday wasn't my day
But Wednesday was the best day
Because on Wednesday night we made love
All I'm trying to give you is a good time honey
Why d'ya have to keep on playing games with my head?
Used to be your baby, when you had no money
Now we spend more time in battle than we ever do in bed
Than we ever do in bed
You don't know how much I hate that answer phone
Are you standing there?
But, you won't pick up the 'phone
Why lie to my face?
(When you can buy a tape machine to give me bullshit in your place)
You might also likeToday I did something I thought I'd never do
I opened up your diary and read about you
Monday was the worst day
And Friday wasn't my day
But Wednesday was the best day
Because on Wednesday night we made love
All I'm trying to give you is a good time honey
Why d'ya have to keep on playing games with my head?
Used to be your baby, when you had no money
Now we spend more time in battle than we ever do in bed, yeah
Than we ever do in bed
Monday was the worst day
Wednesday we made love
And Friday, ooh but
Saturday, is today, is what I'm thinking of
Come in baby, come in close
Take off your designer clothes
'Cause you know what I'm thinking of
Do you remember me? Do you remember us?
Do you remember love?
All I'm trying to give you is a good time, baby
Why d'ya have to keep on playing games with my head?
Used to be your baby when you had no money
Now we spend more time in battle than we ever do in bed
All I'm trying to give you is a good time, baby
Why d'ya have to keep on playing games with my head?
Used to be your baby when you had no money
Now we spend more time in battle than we ever do in bed
La premiere fois tu m'as fait beaucoup rire
Tu etais si mignon, et tu jouais du piano
Maintenant, mon mellieur ami c'est l'argent
Au revoir, cheri
