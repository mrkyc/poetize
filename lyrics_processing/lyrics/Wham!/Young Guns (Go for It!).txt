Hey sucker
(What the hell's got into you?)
Hey sucker
(Now there's nothing you can do)

Well I hadn't seen your face around town awhile
So I greeted you, with a knowing smile
When I saw that girl upon your arm
I knew she won your heart with a fatal charm
I said "Soul boy, let's hit the town"
I said "Hey boy, what's with the frown?"
But in return, all you could say was
"Hi George, meet my fiancee"

Young guns having some fun
Crazy ladies keep 'em on the run
Wise guys realize there's danger in emotional ties
See me, single and free
No tears, no fears, what I want to be
One, two, take a look at you
Death by matrimony

You might also like
A married man, you're out of your head
Sleepless nights, on an H.P. bed
A daddy by the time you're twenty-one
If you're happy with a nappy then you're in for fun
But you're here and you're there
Well there's guys like you just everywhere
Looking back on the good old days?
Well this young gun says caution pays

Young guns having some fun
Crazy ladies keep 'em on the run
Wise guys realize there's danger in emotional ties
See me, single and free
No tears, no fears, what I want to be
One, two, take a look at you
Death by matrimony

I remember when we had such fun and everything was fine
I remember when we used to have a good time, partners in crime
Tell me that's all in the past and I will gladly walk away
Tell me that you're happy now, turning my back nothing to say
"Hey tell this jerk to take a hike
There's somethin' 'bout that boy I don't like"
"Well sugar he don't mean the things he said"
"Just get him outta my way, 'cause I'm seeing red
We got plans to make, we got things to buy
And you're wasting time on some creepy guy"
"Hey shut up chick, that's a friend of mine
Just watch your mouth babe, you're out of line"
Get back! Hands off! Go for it!
Get back! Hands off!
Get back! Hands off! Go for it!
Get back! Hands off!
Get back! Hands off! Go for it!
Get back! Hands off!
Get back! Hands off! Go for it!
Get back! Hands off!
