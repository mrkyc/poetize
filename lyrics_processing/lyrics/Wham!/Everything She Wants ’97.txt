Oh yeah
Somebody told me, boy
Everything she wants is everything she sees
I guess I must have loved you
Because I said you were the perfect girl for me
Baby
And now we're six months older
And everything you want and everything you see
Is out of reach
Not good enough
I don't know what the hell you want from me oh

Girl I just work for you
They told me marriage was a give and take
Well you've shown me you can take
You've got some giving to do
And now you tell me that you're having my baby
I'll tell you that I'm happy if you want me to
But one step further and my back will break
If my best isn't good enough
Then how can it be good enough for two'

All the things beside
And the things you buy
Ain't gonna keep us together
It's just a matter of time
My situation
Never changes
Walking in that mad that door
Like a stranger
Full of wages
I give you all you say you want and more
And all I could see
Was the end of the week
All the things beside
And the things we buy
Ain't gonna keep us together
