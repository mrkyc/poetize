Are you ever gonna tell me why you left me here
With all the words and the worry didn't sound so clear
Do I blame it on the bottle or the cigarettes, man
Or the late night devil always holdin' my hand

If you believe a man can change

I'll try
If I can hold you in my arms just one last time
To keep us from fallin' apart
'Cause it's hell on my heart
And I wanna do anything to try to make things right
I know it's a shot in the dark
But it's hell on my heart

Well, ever since you left I can see it so clear
Through all the smoke, and the whiskey, and the bars, and the beers
I'd sell my soul for a chance to rewind
And stay with you just one more night

If you believe a man can change, oh
If you believe a man can change
You might also like
I'll try
If I can hold you in my arms just one last time
To keep us from fallin' apart
'Cause it's hell on my heart
And I wanna do anything to try to make things right
I know it's a shot in the dark
But it's hell on me

Lookin' out the window
And all that's left is a dusty road and some taillights
And a heart that's broke
And anywhere the wind blows
I'll follow you there
And you should know

I'll try
If I can hold you in my arms just one last time
To keep us from fallin' apart
'Cause it's hell on my heart
And I wanna do anything to try to make things right
I know it's a shot in the dark
But it's hell on my heart
Well, it's hell on my heart, oh, oh, oh, oh
It's hell on my heart
It's hell on my heart
Hey yeah
