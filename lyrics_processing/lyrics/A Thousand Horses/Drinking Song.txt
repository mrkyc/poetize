Reminiscin' on a love gone wrong
Some like a little slow groove
Or maybe somethin' kinda old school
Some people like it more upbeat
To get 'em movin', get 'em on their feet
Last dancin' with a Mary Jane
But not everybody rolls that way
But everybody loves a drinkin' song
To get you goin' when the week's been long
It goes good with a drink too strong
A glass raised every time it comes on
And everybody in the partyin' crowd
Yeah, they gonna wanna sing it loud
Even if you get the words all wrong
Everybody loves a drinkin' song, that's right
If you're sittin' on a broken heart
A-tippin' back on what's been torn apart
Crank it up for the whole room
Gettin' down like some old blues
And if you're mixin' misery with gin
Or gettin' high with some low friends
Every time the night's about to end
Or you're whiskey bent
All you gotta do is turn it on
