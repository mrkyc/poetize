Pack up that old suitcase
With everything I own
Gonna leave this place
Now all I need
Is you to come with me
I got a full tank of gasoline
I grabbed your old sundress
And your cutoff jeans
Now all I need
Is you to come with me

'Cause there's a million miles of road
Take us anywhere we wanna go
With the wind in your hair
And the sunset burnin' gold
And from the mountains to the sea
Great Plains to New Orleans
Where the Mississippi River flows
Don't it feel like Heaven is close

We don't need all the fancy things
Like the brand new cars or the diamond rings
Just roll the windows down
And baby sing with me
I pick up this old guitar
And teach you how to play underneath the stars
Your favorite song
Is "Me and Bobby McGee"
You might also like
'Cause there's a million miles of road
Take us anywhere we wanna go
With the wind in your hair
And the sunset burnin' gold
And from the mountains to the sea
Great Plains to New Orleans
Where the Mississippi River flows
Don't it feel like Heaven is close
Lord, don't it feel like Heaven is close
Guitar, ya'll


Time is just a memory
And baby there's just one thing that I need
That I need

'Cause there's a million miles of road
Take us anywhere we wanna go
With the wind in your hair
And the sunset burnin' gold
And from the mountains to the sea
Great Plains to New Orleans
Where the Mississippi River flows
'Cause there's a million miles of road
Take us anywhere we wanna go
With the wind in your hair
And the sunset burnin' gold
And from the mountains to the sea
Great Plains to New Orleans
Where the Mississippi River flows
Don't it feel like Heaven is close
Lord, don't it feel like Heaven is close
