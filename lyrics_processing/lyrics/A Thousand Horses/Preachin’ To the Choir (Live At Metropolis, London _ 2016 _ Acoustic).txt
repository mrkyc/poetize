I'm in the wooden pew Sunday party crowd
If no one else will drink it then you know I will
And wake up in the morning with some Baptist guilt
Every tattoo's got a story to tell
Mama said she's prayin' hard to keep me outta hell
But whiskey tastes better when you chase it with a beer
But I ain't telling nothing new to nobody here
If I'm preachin' to the choir
Raise your hands a little higher
If you wanna sing along to a Saturday night revival song
Let me see you sparking up your lighters
Pour a little payday on the fire
If you're a forty drinking, forty working, living the dream
Then you're just like me
And I'm preachin' to the choir
Preachin' to the choir
I ain't rich but I'm grateful
Every time I'm driving with a tank full
"Simple Man" coming through the dashboard speakers
I'm a southern rock sinner, believer
If I'm preachin' to the choir
Raise your hands a little higher
If you wanna sing along to a Saturday night revival song
Let me see you sparking up your lighters
Pour a little payday on the fire
If you're a forty drinking, forty working, living the dream
Then you're just like me
And I'm preachin' to the choir
You might also likeNothing like bourbon and the blues
Smoke ring hallelu's
Breaking our backs, bending the rules
Southern dry, deep-fried, hearts of gold
Hell, but you already know
That's right!
Cause I'm preachin' to the choir
Raise your hands a little higher
If you wanna sing along to a Saturday night revival song
Let me see you sparking up your lighters
Pour a little payday on the fire
If you're a forty drinking, forty working, living the dream
Then you're just like me
And I'm preachin' to the choir
Yeah, I'm preachin' to the choir
I'm either all in or all out
Cause I'm preachin' to the choir
