But that's okay, all signs are pointin'
To another good time, I'm already on my way
Got on my shades, gonna paint the town when the sun goes down
I'll be holdin' my six-string shooter with my finger on the trigger
Don't it make you wanna slide across the hood
Step on the gas and burn like Willie
Get up to no good, lead this horse to the Whiskey River
Don't you wanna ride with me?
Red bandana had one too many, we're the last of our breed
So let's step on the gas and burn like Willie
Boots good and broke in, holes in my sole gonna fill 'em up
And this joint is smokin', with the loud and proud sound of a rowdy crowd
We gettin' down, shakin' the walls all over this town
And I'm holdin' my six-string shooter with my finger on the trigger
Don't it make you wanna slide across the hood
Step on the gas and burn like Willie
Get up to no good, lead this horse to the Whiskey River
Don't you wanna ride with me?
Red bandana had one too many, we're the last of our breed
So let's step on the gas and burn like Willie
Alright, alright, alright
(Alright, alright, alright)
Alright, alright, alright
(Alright, alright, alright)
Alright, alright, alright
(Alright, alright, alright)
Alright, alright, alright
