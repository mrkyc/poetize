It'll feel like I'm still gone
'Til I feel those wheels touch down
'Til I breathe that familiar air, run my fingers through your hair
I'll be alone, out on the road
It'll feel like I'm still gone
'Til I see that rusty sign
Population you and me, that one red light starts turnin' green
And I'll be home, yeah I'll be home

Where everybody knows everybody else
Ain't no such thing as the top shelf
Good times flowin'
Dancin' in the light of a jukebox glowin'
There's only one station on the radio
And we'll crank it up baby loud as it'll go
And it's you I'm holdin'
Don't you know that's where I'm goin'

I've been gone too long
But you can't make me forget
The smell of that ol' diesel smoke, my old man pullin' out the choke
'Round and 'round and 'round this town we'd go
You might also like
Where everybody knows everybody else
Ain't no such thing as the top shelf
Good times flowin'
Dancin' in the light of a jukebox glowin'
There's only one station on the radio
And we'll crank it up baby loud as it'll go
And it's you I'm holdin'
Don't you know that's where I'm goin'
Where I'm goin'

Where I found true love and I let it go
Climbed a Greyhound bus on a dead end road
And I took me just as far as it would go
But she took me back, so I'm goin' back home

Where everybody knows everybody else
Ain't no such thing as the top shelf
Good times flowin'
Dancin' in the light of a jukebox glowin'
There's only one station on the radio
And we'll crank it up baby loud as it'll go
And it's you I'm holdin'
Don't you know that's where I'm goin'
Where I'm goin'
Don't you know that's where I'm goin'
Where I'm goin'
