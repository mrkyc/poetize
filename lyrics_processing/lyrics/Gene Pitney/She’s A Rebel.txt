See the way she shuffles her feet
How she holds her head up high
When she goes walking by, I could die
When she holds my hand out so proud
Though she's not just one of the crowd
 always the one
Trying the things they've never done
Just because all that they say, hey
She's a rebel and she'll never be any good
She's a rebel 'cause she never ever does what she should
Well, just because she doesn't do what everybody else does
And that's the reason why I can give up all my love
She is always good to me
 from outside of me
Well, she's not a rebel, no, no, no
She's not a rebel, no, no, no, to me
And I'll be going my crooked way
They won't like me after the day
I'll just stand there, right by her side
And they say
You might also likeShe's a rebel and she'll never be any good
She's a rebel 'cause she never ever does what she should
Well, just because she doesn't do what everybody else does
And that's the reason why we can't share our love
She is always good to me
 from outside of me
Well, she's not a rebel, no, no, no
She's not a rebel, no, no, no, to me
Oh, she's not a rebel, no, no, no
She's not a rebel, no, no, no
Well, she's not a rebel, no, no, no
She's not a rebel, no, no, no, no, no
She's not a rebel, no, no, no
She's not a rebel, no, no, no, no, no
She's not a rebel, no, no, no
She's not a rebel, no, no, no, no, no
She's not a rebel, no, no, no
She's not a rebel, no, no, no, no, no
She's not a rebel, no, no, no
