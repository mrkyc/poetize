Keeping my soul and my senses apart
Something's gotten into my life
Cutting its way through my dreams like a knife
Turning me up, turning me down
Making me smile, making me frown
In a world that was war
I once lived in a time
That was peace
With no trouble at all
But then you came my way
And a feeling I know
Shook my heart
And made me want you to stay
All of my nights
And all of my days
I wanna tell you now
Something gotta hold of my hand
Dragging my soul to a beautiful land
Yeah something has invaded my night
Painting my sleep with a colour so bright
Changing the grey, changing the blue
Scarlet for me, scarlet for you
You might also likeI've got to know if this is the real thing
I've got to know what's making my heart sing, oh yeah
A smile and I am lost for a lifetime
Each minute spent with you is the right time
Every hour (yeah) every day (yeah)
You touch me and my mind goes astray
And baby yeah, and baby yeah
Something's gotten hold of my hand
Dragging my soul to a beautiful land yeah
Something's gotten into my life
Cutting its way through my dreams like a knife
Turning me up, turning me down
Making me smile, making me frown
In a world that was war
I once lived in a time
That was peace
With no trouble at all
But then you, you, you
You came my way
And a feeling I know
Shook my heart
And made me want you to stay
All of my nights
And all of my days
I Wanna tell you now
Something's gotten hold of my heart
Keeping my soul and my senses apart
Something has invaded my night
Painting my sleep with a colour so bright
Changing the grey, changing the blue
