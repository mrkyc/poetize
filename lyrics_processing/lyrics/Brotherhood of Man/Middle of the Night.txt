'Cause you're coming home and I'm feeling great
'Cause it's been so long and lonely without you
Will you give me love like you did before
Will you give me love will you ask for more
Will it be alright to love the whole night through
It will be alright in the middle of the night (aha)
It will be alright in the middle of the night (aha)
Well I just can't wait for the day to break
'Cause you're coming home and I'm feeling great
'Cause it's been so long and lonely without you
And will it be alright to love the whole night through
Well I just can't wait till you're at the door
Just to see you standing there once more
And to hold you in my arms like lovers do
Well I hope your love goes on and on
And I hope it never will go wrong
'Cause I only want to spent my live with you
It will be alright in the middle of the night (aha)
It will be alright in the middle of the night (aha)
Well I just can't wait till you're at the door
Just to see you standing there once more
And to hold you in my arms like lovers do
'Cause I only want to spent my live with you
