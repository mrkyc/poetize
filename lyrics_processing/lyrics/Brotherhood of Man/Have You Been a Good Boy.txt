Ever since you went away
I cry and cry, most every day
I never thought I'd miss you so
But baby love, I want you to know
Ooh, I love you honey
Ooh, I need you baby
Gotta have your lovin, you know you got me crazy
Oh baby tell me, truly
Since you've been gone have you been a good boy?

Baby, baby, baby, It's been so long have you been a good boy?
Baby, baby, baby, I've been so lost without you
All I do is dream about you
Baby, baby, baby, Have you been a good boy?

Baby, It's my jealous mind (my jealous mind)
That makes me think that you'll make in time
But baby boy let's get out too (what can I do?)
It's been so long since I been with you
Ooh, I love you honey
Ooh, I need you baby
Gotta have your lovin', you know you've got me crazy
Oh, baby tell me, truly
Since you've been gone have you been a good boy?
