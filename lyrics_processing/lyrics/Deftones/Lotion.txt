I meant to come back to put out bliss
But your style's crumbling, covered, canned
It was sick and no, you don't even know how it
Comes and shifts, then gets ruined by you fucking slobs

It's classical anyway

I can't help it, you make me so sick over and over
It sits stiff, bound with no heart
Fine, 'cause this is where the separation starts arising
I can see it coming over your cloud

It's classical anyway
How cool are you?
I remember

I feel sick
I feel sick
I feel sick
I feel sick

It's just a bad call, ha, it's so funny
How you think I'm so serious, oh, but that's not it
The thing is I don't give enough jacks to give a fuck
You're just plain boring and you bore me asleep

It's classical anyway
How cool are you?
I remember

I feel sick
I feel sick
I feel sick
I feel sick

I feel sick, I feel sick
I feel sick, I feel sick
I feel sick, I feel sick
I feel sick, I feel sick

Who the fuck are you anyways, you fuck?
It's making sick sense, see how you're sticking out
Hardly hoping, ha, you like to please, rise up off the fucking knees
I'm about to train you for a second, try to find your fucking heart
It's classical anyway
How cool are you?
I remember

I feel sick
I feel sick
I feel sick
I feel sick

I feel sick, I feel sick
I feel sick, I feel sick
I feel sick, I feel sick
I feel sick, I feel sick

I feel sick right here
I feel sick right here
I feel sick right here
I feel sick right here
I feel sick right here
I feel sick right here
I feel sick right here
