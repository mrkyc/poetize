I don't know where to begin
I need to be set free
No, I just can't let you win
To hurt you or make you angry
You know I'd never do
But what you deserve is my whole heart
I can't give that to you
Please tell me how much is it gonna take
To bring the peace, to soothe the pain?
If we trust the heart will it find its way to wisdom
Or just a fool's mistake?
Bye, bye, my heart's gonna find its soul
Heart break from love that always slips away
What brings a change of heart? Is my heart really mine?
Does it beat just to take me over? Can it be satisfied?
My heart is first to love
And first to throw love away
My mind tries to explain
To make some sense of heart's ways
My mind poses with the question
Can heart be blame to tame?
Heart grins and says can bring it on
You'll never make me change

If we trust the heart will it find its way to wisdom
Or just a fool's mistake?
Bye, bye, my heart's gonna find its soul
Heart break from love that always slips away
What brings a change of heart? Is my heart really mine?
Does it beat just to take me over? Can it be satisfied?
Come take my heart, come take my soul
Come give me peace, give me love, give me hope
Come fill my heart, come fill my soul
Come bring me peace, give me life, make me whole, who-whole
Bye, bye, my heart's gonna find its soul
Heart break from love that always slips away
Bye, bye, my heart's gonna find its soul
Heart break from love that always slips away
