I think you said clearly
Clear skies was the forecast today (but where did they go?)
Well I'm lookin' west, I see cloudy skies at best
And to the east storm clouds are headed this way
(Look out here they come)
What good does it do me to worry about tomorrow
When It's all in Your hands
So where You lead me I'll follow
Everything is gonna be just fine
You know that nothing can stop me now
Rains fallin' from the sky
But my day is shining bright
This love has gone and turned my world upside down
And it's gonna be alright, alright
You're givin' up, down in the dumps
This life's so rough, too tough
Had enough all before you get out of bed
(Get out of your bed)
Lift up your head my dear friend
This tunnel does have an end
I think I see light ahead
(I see light ahead)
You might also likeYou're wastin' your time
No need to worry about tomorrow
It's all in His hands, He will lead, will you follow
Everything is gonna be just fine
You know that nothing can stop me now
Rains fallin' from the sky
But my day is shining bright
This love has gone and turned my world upside down
And it's gonna be alright
Why won't you just let it go?
Stop trying to make it on your own
Yeah, you've got something to live for
This is the love that put stars in the heavens
This is the love that makes life worth livin', yeah
Everything is gonna be just fine
You know that nothing can stop me now
Rains fallin' from the sky
But my day is shining bright
This love has gone and turned my world upside down
And it's gonna be alright
