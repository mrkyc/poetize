She just stepped out a magazine, such a pretty thing
There she goes again knowin' there's a chance
That she might create a scene, do you know what I mean?
Don't you fellas agree?
(Oh yeah)
I said ain't she the finest thing that you ever did see
(Oh yeah)
So beautiful to me
'Cause if you ever had a good love
Then there's one thing you got to know
That there's something about that woman
She's got something you can't live without, makes your heart sing
Oh, it's just something about that woman
If you're in doubt, then you are missin' out on a good thing, yeah

These eyes can't fool my lady next to me
And she don't play that kind of thing, no
