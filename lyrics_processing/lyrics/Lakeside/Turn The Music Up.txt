You might also likeMy neighbours getting on my nerves
Telling me to turn my music down
They said the pictures bouncing off the walls
The bass is shaking things around, yeah
But all the people in my building
Hey, they get off into the groove
I got this one square set of neighbours
And we all wish that they would move
So we can turn it up
He-hey, yeah
Turn it up
Ah... Hey!
Won't you let me let my music play?
(Turn it up)
He-hey
Turn the music up!
My landlord needs my money
(Money, I need my money)
I know he won't ask me to move
So, if it comes down to me or them
I hope they learn to dig the groove
'Cause I'm gonna play my music
Until the end of time
(Till the end of time)
So, I hope someday they'll learn to party (party)
Then we'll all be doing fine
