Just, living in a dream
Everyday that goes by
Is the same old thing
I'm like a captain on a ship
With no certain course
Only run on a power back
Baby, you're the source take a look
If you would take a good look, between the lines
Two can see the vision inside my mind

In my mind!  In my mind
I see a rainbow
Just in time
You brought, the sunshine  sunshine, blue skies
In our time
We've seen storm clouds storm clouds sometimes
In my mind
Are those visions of always loving you
I just won't last that day, without you
Oh baby, please
Hey, won't you rescue me?
If you leave me, I die
Hey lady, can't you see?
My life has changed
Since your sun set on my new day
Over the horizon are the wants in my life
That the only way
To sit you down, sit you down
To explain the vision inside my mind
You might also like
In my mind! in my mind
I see a rainbow rainbow
Just in time
You brought the sunshine  sunshine, blue skies
In our time
We've seen storm clouds storm clouds sometimes
In my mind
Are those visions of always loving you  love you
I wonder, I wonder
Was it just a vision on my mind
Must have been a vision of my mind
You see, I don't ever want you to leave me baby
No, no, no, no, no, no babe
Ooh baby, everywhere I go
I see your picture
Visions of you
Follow me everywhere I go
Hey baby, ooooh babe
You see, I tried, I try
I can't deny
I, won't last a day, without you baby, you baby
Oooh
Good times, bad times, you've been around
My life has been a one with ups and downs
My life would be a mess, so I guess
I just won't last a day Ooh, baby
