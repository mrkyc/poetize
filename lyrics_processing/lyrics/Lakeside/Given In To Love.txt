I can't even sleep
Visions of you
Crowding my dreams
I don't know what to do
Thought I didn't need your love
It's too heavy for me
Intimate friends is all I wanted to be
Girl, with you
Now I just can't wait to call you up
I never stayed at home till I met you
I need you more each day
Hey, what can I say?
I've given in to love, sugar
(Given in to love)
I'm possessed with the feeling
I've given in to love
Girl, it's you that I needed
I tried to go out with somebody else
I found out that I was just kidding myself
I only thought of you
I talked to a friend for some advice
He told me to weigh the value of life
Living without you
You might also likeRight there I knew I had heard enough
I went to the nearest phone to call you up
And tell you I've got it all together now
I've given in to love, sugar
(Given in to love)
I'm possessed with the feeling
I've given in to love
Girl, it's you that I needed
I'm needing you, oh, baby
Badaba, ba-badaba, ba-bada
Yeah...
...I knew that I could take no more
Surrender or lose the girl that I adore
Baby, this loneliness I can't take it no more
I'm giving in it to love
(Given in to love)
I'm possessed with the feeling
I've given in to love
Girl, I ain't too hard to talk about it
Go 'head and tell the whole world about it
Giving in to love, baby
(I'm giving it to you)
(You can take it, take it from me)
I'm possessed with the feeling
(Of loving you too)
(You can take it any way you want to)
Giving in to love
Giving in, giving in, baby
(I'm giving it to you)
(You can take it, take it from me)
I'm possessed with the feeling, baby
(Of loving you too)
(You can take it any way you want to)
Giving in to love
I'm gonna give on in
(I'm giving it to you)
