Get your hands up in the air

This is a raid
Everybody raid the dance floor
Raid, hey we're here to turn the party out
Raid, everybody raid the dance floor
Raid, party people let me hear you shout

When we fell in to Chi-town
Everybody was throwin' down
(Throwin' down, yeah)
And every town we went to
A certain group would play, rocked the house
(Rocked the house yeah)
It got everybody up and dancing
If you know what I mean
Then, sound your alarm
Everybody scream, if you feel alright

This is a Raid
Everybody raid the dance floor
Raid, 'cause you're here to turn the party out
Raid, everybody raid the dance floor
Raid, party people let me hear you shout
You might also like
The groove has caught you sleeping
That girl you looking for is gone
(She's gone)
That's what you get for waiting
(That's what you get for waiting)
There's no more dance floor room on this song, no
So all you people, out there dancing
Hey ya'll, do you know what I mean
You got to sound your alarm
Everybody scream
If you feel alright

Everybody raid the dance floor
