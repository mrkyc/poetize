Starchild
You've got to do something about these
Mind crimes
The shuffling feet and sad expressions
They don't go, they don't go
I thought you came down from heaven
To save souls
These angry men are into making
Bad seeds
The only thing we had they're taking
Now love needs
Needs a little, needs a little
Five thousand million people
To spread joy, spread a little joy
I thought you came down from heaven to save us
I thought you came but you just don't take us

Somewhere in the world tonight
There's a fire blazing bright
Keeping warm the superman
Sent to us to save the land
Somewhere in the world today
A hungry one will kneel to pray
Wishing all the while to see
Starchild
I've seen the preachers on the TV
In white suits
With precious stones they're studded into
Their boots
Can you take the money, can you take their money?
I don't know who to believe
Is it them or you?
I thought you came down from heaven to save us
I thought you came but you just don't take us

When you gonna come, when you gonna come
You've got to save us from what we've begun
From what we've begun
So long coming down
