She's gone away
Flying out on a jet plane
Told me, she won't be back again
And Talullah, Talullah is her name

Well, I got this thing, girl
I wanted to say to you
"Talullah, I'm still missing you"
Baby, can't you stop that plane?
Turn it around, I still love you, babe
Tell the captain that I'm to blame, I'm to blame

This ink stained with tears
All these letters from my heavy heart
This is what I always feared
That these sparks would fly and we would break apart

But I got this thing, girl
I wanted to say to you
"Talullah, I'm still missing you, I miss you so"
Baby, can't you stop that plane?
Turn it around, I still love you, babe
Tell the captain that I'm to blame, I'm to blame

You've gotta stop that plane
Turn it around, turn it around
You've gotta stop
You've gotta stop it now and turn it around
You're my magic star
Don't you fly too far from me
From me, from me, can't you see?
There's a hole in my soul
And I'm losing control
And it's not too late for you to be my magic star
Come and see me, baby
So solitaire, I think of your midnight hair
And it's still the same
'Cause you're on my brain
You gotta stop that plane, come and see me, baby

She's gone away
Flying out on a jet plane
Told me, she won't be back again
And Talullah, Talullah is her name

I curl up tight
So alone, I can't sleep at night
Return to sender, that's me tonight
I really think I'm lost in space
I shut my eyes, I still see your face
Reach out, touchin' your soft embrace
You've gotta stop that plane
Now there's a hole in my soul
And I'm losing control
I know you're my magic star
But you've gone away and flown too far this time
And Talullah, Talullah, Talullah la la la la
Stop that plane, turn it around, baby
You've gotta come and see me
Stop that plane, turn it around, baby
I know you don't need me
But stop that plane and turn it around
Turn it around
I need to see you, baby
I need to see you, baby
And you, you're my magic star
Don't you fly too far
Stop that plane
