Why can't we be together?
Could you love me? Don't hate me
I don't see, why can't we live together?
Maybe we can get it on, people, we can get along
Should be our destiny
There's a cold streak living inside us
There's no rainbows, just bullets and bombs
And if you want to rise up, we got to stick our love inside us
We can make this hate stop (It's all the same, all the shame)
Now don't you want to rise up?

We been giving hate a chance
(We got all this love to give, you know)
And the love will be running out for us
Can you feel the dream's alive?
We're hoping we can still survive
As the wind carries every dove away

So why do we see these colors?
It's only skin deep, don't mean a thing
So clear, underneath this, we're all brothers
Can't you see it's killing us, can't you see it's killing us?
Can't you see it's killing me? Trigger happy fantasy
So stand up and be so strong now
Freedom is not so far away
If you know you want to rise up
(We've wanted to rise up for so long now)
We can make this hate stop
Now don't you want to rise up?

And the love will be running out for us
Can you feel the dream's alive?
We're hoping we can still survive
As the wind carries every dove away

The wind carries every dove away
The wind carries every dove away
Every dove away
(Dove, dove, dove, dove, dove, dove, dove)
Now you've been taking our dignity for too long
I want to save this sanctity that we hold
And who's right and who is wrong?
We're not so different anyway
Words are in this song
Can't we stop the fighting?

'Cause we been giving hate a chance
(Don't give this hate a chance, we got all this love to give, you know)
We have all this love to give
And the love will be running out for us
I feel the love is gonna run out for us
Can you feel the dream's alive?
We're hoping we can still survive
As the wind carries every dove away
(The wind carries every dove away)
Don't give this hate a chance
We got all this love to give, you know
(The wind carries every dove away)
That this dream's alive, we'll still survive
Until no more people have to cry, I said
(The wind carries every dove away!)
Don't give this hate a chance
(As the wind carries every dove away!)
We got all this love to give, you know
(And the love will be running out for us)
That this dream's alive, we'll still survive
Until no more people have to cry
(Give yourself a break, amen!)
Don't give this hate a chance
(Just because you know you can!)
We got all this love to give, you know
That this dream's alive, we'll still survive
