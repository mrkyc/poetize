The pebbles you've arranged
In the sand, they're strange
They speak to me like constellations as we lie here
There's a magic I can't hold
Your smile of honey gold
In that you never seem to be in short supply of

Ooh, so baby, let's get it on
Drinking wine and killing time
Sitting in the summer sun
You know I've wanted you so long
Why'd you have to drop that bomb on me?

Lazy days, crazy dolls
You said we'd been friends too long

Seven days in sunny June
Were long enough to bloom
The flowers on the summer dress you wore in spring
The way we laughed as one
And then you dropped the bomb
That I've known you too long for us to have a thing

Drinking wine and killing time
Sitting in the summer sun
You know I've wanted you so long
Why'd you have to drop that bomb on me?

Could it be this?
The stories in your eyes

You'll fly away on

Seven days in sunny June
Were long enough to bloom
The flowers on the sunbeam dress you wore in spring

You know I've wanted you so long
Why'd you have to drop that bomb on me?

Could it be this?
For seven days in June I wasn't lonely
Could it be this?
You never gave me time to say I love you
Could it be this?
I know you don't believe me but it's so true

Don't walk away from me, girl
I read the stories in your eyes
Don't you walk away from me
I read the stories in your eyes
And you've been telling me we've been friends for too long, yeah
I think I love you, I think I love you
