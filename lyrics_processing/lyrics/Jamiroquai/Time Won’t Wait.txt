She
Was sleeping at the bus stop
Heaven away
But a magic in her blue eyes
Told me she had left a daze
(Left a daze)
So I have to check her wisdom
And there was no doubt
I told her I was sitting alone and on crestfallen
Future's gonna catch me out
She said, "Time won't wait for you
So do all the things you wanted to
Better hurry up, take it in your stride
And use your resolution which you've been supplied"
"And love won't change you, boy, it's true
I can tell you till my face is blue
Every second screams, listen to your dreams
Ooh, 'cause you just can't stop the clock
On a brick wall I was banging over my head
But the sweet rings on my feet now
Where once they were made of lead
(Sweet rings on my feet now)
Do you hear the message in the music, I hear it too
You know, you got your history in the making
Slowing down won't get you through, no, no
Time won't wait for you
So do all the things you wanted to
Better hurry up, take it in your stride
Use your resolution which you've been supplied
And love won't change you, boy, it's true
I can tell you till my face is blue
Every second screams, listen to your dreams
'Cause you just can't stop the clock
