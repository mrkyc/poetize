Can you dig it?
There's something in the air tonight
Got a one-way ticket
Baby, don't you wanna ride?
Got to make it, make it to the other side
I've got demons snappin' at my heels tonight

I just want to run away, turn me loose
Got people around, runnin' me down, I can't stay (Woo)
I just want to get away, I just wanna get away now (Turn me loose)
Get them off my back today

Can you feel it?
I'm stuck inside a hurricane
Chasin' rainbows
Can't you see I'm going insane?
I wanna be a free man
But I'm spinnin' on this crazy wheel
I'm jumpin' for the high bar, can't you dig it?
No longer know what I feel
Can't you see?

I just want to run away, turn me loose
Got people around, runnin' me down, I can't stay
I just want to get away, I just wanna get away now (Turn me loose)
Get them off my back today

I just want to run away, I just wanna run away (Turn me loose)
Got people around, runnin' me down, I can't stay (Can't stay no more now)
I just want to get away, I just got to get away (Turn me loose)
Get them off my back today (Woo)
