Woo, woah, woah, yeah

Have you gone astray or lost your way?
You should have seen me yesterday
Well I knew this kind of love was written in the stars
It's only once or twice that you're in line with Mister Moon
Then it was you, you took me on your cloud
And gave me flowers for my pain, but with some degree of certainty
My destiny seemed to slip away from me
Yeah, before I got to know your name, aw, honey

Just give me a chance, I'll do what you want me to
Everybody wants to dance, so how come I can't dance with you?
You really turn me on
You're the one that makes me smile

It's Mister Moon who plays in tune, Mister Moon who knows
And if it's Mister Moon who gives the sign, then that's the sign that goes
I never know what to do 'til I'm there with you
Yeah, I'm right on

Did you lose your mind for a day?
You don't remember anyway
Like the waters of a dream encapsulate my mind
A place I haven't seen sits at the end of space and time
So lost in love that I think I'm blind
To perchance upon this circumstance is something of a miracle
So spiritual, it's vergin' on the physical (How?)
Searchin' for a love I cannot find
