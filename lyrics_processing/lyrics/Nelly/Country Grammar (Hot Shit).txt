Hot shit

Mmmm, I'm goin' down, down, baby, your street in a Range Rover
(Come on)
Street sweeper baby, cocked, ready to let it go
(Hot shit)
Shimmy, shimmy, cocoa what, listen to it pound
Light it up and take a puff, pass it to me now
I'm goin' down, down, baby, your street in a Range Rover
Street sweeper baby, cocked, ready to let it go
Shimmy, shimmy, cocoa what, listen to it pound
Light it up and take a puff, pass it to me now

Mmmm, you can find me in St. Louis rollin' on dubs
Smokin' on dubs in clubs, blowin' up like Cocoa Puffs
Sippin' Bud', gettin' perved and gettin' dubbed
Daps and hugs, mean mugs and shoulder shrugs
And it's all because, accumulated enough scratch just to
Navigate it, wood decorated on chrome and it's
Candy painted, fans faintin' while I'm entertainin'
Wild, ain't it? How me and money get acquainted
Plus I hang with Hannibal Lecter (Hot shit)
So feel me when I bring it
Sing it loud (What?), I'm from the Lou' and I'm proud
Run a mile for the cause, I'm righteous, above the law
Player my style's raw, I'm Born to Mack, like Todd Shaw
Forget the fame and the glamour, give me D's with a rubber hammer
My grammar be's Ebonics, gin, tonic and chronic
Fuck Bionic, it's ironic, slammin' niggas like Onyx
Lunatics 'til the day I die
And I run more game than the Bulls and Sonics
See Nelly LiveGet tickets as low as $40You might also like
I'm goin' down, down, baby, your street in a Range Rover
(Come on)
Street sweeper baby, cocked, ready to let it go
(Hot shit)
Shimmy, shimmy, cocoa what, listen to it pound
Light it up and take a puff, pass it to me now
I'm goin' down, down, baby, your street in a Range Rover
Street sweeper baby, cocked, ready to let it go
Shimmy, shimmy, cocoa what, listen to it pound
Light it up and take a puff, pass it to me now

Who say pretty boys can't be
Wild niggas, loud niggas, O.K. Corral niggas
Foul niggas, run in the club and bust in the crowd, nigga
"How nigga?"
Ask me again and it's goin' down, nigga
Now nigga, come to the circus and watch me clown, nigga
Pound niggas, what you be givin' when I'm around, nigga
Frown niggas, talkin' that shit when I leave the town, nigga
Say now, can you hoes come out to play now?
Hey, I'm ready to cut you up any day now
Play by my rules, boo, and you gon' stay high
May I answer your Third Question like A.I
Say, "Hi", to my niggas left in the slamma
From St. Louis to Memphis, from Texas back up to Indiana
Chi-Town, K.C., Motown to Alabama
L.A., New York Yankee niggas, to Hotlanta
Louisiana, all my niggas with country grammar
Smokin' blunts in Savannah, blow thirty mil', like I'm Hammer
I'm goin' down, down, baby, your street in a Range Rover
(Come on)
Street sweeper baby, cocked, ready to let it go
(Hot shit)
Shimmy, shimmy, cocoa what, listen to it pound
Light it up and take a puff, pass it to me now
I'm going down, down, baby, your street in a Range Rover
Street sweeper baby, cocked, ready to let it go
Shimmy, shimmy, cocoa what, listen to it pound
Light it up and take a puff, pass it to me now

Let's show these cats to make these
Millions so you niggas quit actin' silly, mon
Kid quicker than Billy, mon, talkin' really and I need it mon
Flows, I kick 'em freely mon, especially off Remi, mon
Keys to my Beemer, mon, holler at Beenie Man
See me, mon, chiefin', rollin' deeper than any mon
Through Jennings mon, through U-City back up to Kingsland
With nice niggas, sheist niggas who snatch your life, niggas
Trife niggas who produce and sell the same beat twice, nigga (Hot shit)
Ice, niggas, all over, close to never sober
From broke to havin' brokers, my price-range is Rover
Now I'm knockin' like Jehovah; let me in now, let me in now
Bill Gates, Donald Trump, let me in now
Spend now, I got money to lend my friends now
We in now, candy Benz, Kenwood and 10's now
I win now (Woo), fuckin' lesbian twins now
Seein' now, through the pen I make my ends now
I'm goin' down, down, baby, your street in a Range Rover
(Come on)
Street sweeper baby, cocked, ready to let it go
(Hot shit)
Shimmy, shimmy, cocoa what, listen to it pound
Light it up and take a puff, pass it to me now
I'm goin' down, down, baby, your street in a Range Rover
Street sweeper baby, cocked, ready to let it go
Shimmy, shimmy, cocoa what, listen to it pound
