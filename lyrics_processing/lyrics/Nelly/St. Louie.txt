You can find me in St. Louie
Where the gunplay ring all day (Na-na-na)
Some got jobs and some sell yay
Others just smoke and fuck all day

I'm from the home of the Redd Foxx, Ced the Entertainer
Jettin' off with Brian Cox, I'll see you later
Maybe not 'cause I got somethin' hot
In the Navigator, waitin' in the parkin' lot
A bad boy on a ride rougher than The LOX
I keep 'em both cocked, Nina and Sabrina
Now tell me, boys, have you seen her? Have you seen her?
Uh, nine millimeter makin' niggas believers
Hop out the two-seater in a Vokal wife beater
Levi's fresh from the cleaners
Heavy starch with the cuff, like fuck it, leave it to beaver
Catch me in the Galleria, Plaza, or Chesterfield
Rollin' down Hanley Hills in a black Sedan Deville
I used to love it when they hit me for a rocker
Maybe a bopper, I kept it proper
A non-stopper, around the clock-er
Now it's cool to pull up the Benz and helicopter, uh
See Nelly LiveGet tickets as low as $40You might also like

Sunday mornin', crack of dawnin' and I'm yawnin'
Natural Bridge and Kingshighway is where I'm goin'
Wake up, man, and start blowin'
Gotta get the juices flowin'
Now I'ma tell you one more time for you cats that just ain't knowin'
Hey, you can find me in St. Louie
In the hole with me, Fetty, and Leezy gettin' swoll
Wrappin' the Optimos, sharpin' up my flows
Practicin' for my shows, that's usually how it goes
We be ready to roll, got chronic already rolled
Swingin' through O'Fallon, sounds knockin' out of control
Like a boom-boom-boom, who is it? It's Jackie Frost
The one who gettin' where he at and he showed you who was the boss
I'm like a human hot sauce, thinkin' I'll burn your thoughts
Your information was false, I'll show you just what it costs
In the M-I-crooked letter-crooked letter
O-U-R-I, no one could do it better, hey
You can find me in St. Louie

Now, now, now, now in the middle we keep it crunk and jiggy
Love 'Pac and Biggie
The way that you love your sticky
Call Louie, he have you pissy
Mix with Hen' and Crissy
Bumpin' Tim and Missy
With Slim that used to diss me
In the red Expedition
That's okay though, she can ride just for the day though
Can't even be a house guest like Kato
I'm a dog, I said it, woof, woof, now call me Snoopy
Wouldn't have me in a hooptie, now you see me in a coupie
In front of utopia, I'm hopin' ya
Come down here trippin', man, I'm toastin' ya
Thanksgiving 'round these parts, yo, we roastin' ya
And when the heat come down, get ghostin' ya (God bless us)
Lox with us, just how the folks with us
My daddy told me that, said I'm supposed to bust
Don't be provokin' us, it ain't no joke in us
Just the North, South, East, West coast in us
You can find me in St. Louie
Where the gunplay ring all day (Na-na-na)
Some got jobs and some sell yay
Others just smoke and fuck all day

They know the fun, Sunday night (DJ Charlie Chan)
Poppin' that like that there, huh? Get up
Sendin' shouts out to London, yessir, ah-ha, the Arch
You can find me in St. Louie
White Castle's live, my nigga (Voodoo)

Some got jobs and some sell yay
