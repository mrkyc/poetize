Toasted skin turned darker shades
So as to better disguise your figure from the streetlights
First floor window opened up
As you tip-toe on the back porch
To meet the new girl on the corner
Make your big plans for the summer
No one's gonna stay inside
We're singing, we are finally here
And we're not going nowhere without our friends
And we can't stop singing
Everybody's making sure we stay up till sunset
But we can't forget
If we ever find our way back
This is all we've got
So you borrow your best friend's Jeep
Cracked her windshield and lost her keys
Crashed the rich kids' parties
Got kicked off of private beaches
We introduced our friends to yours
And we would laugh while we were ignored
And from coast to coast, we'll soon disperse
But let's live tonight like it's our first
You might also likeWe've got fast food, tattoos, late talks, longer walks
Checkin' for the music, for the fireworks and alcohol
No one's gonna stay inside
We're singing, we are finally here
And we're not going nowhere without our friends
And we can't stop singing
Everybody's making sure we stay up till sunset
But we can't forget
If we ever find our way back
This is all we've got
I will never sleep in with the shades drawn
Casting shadows on my bed

No one's gonna stay inside
We're singing, finally here
(Fuck yeah!)
And we're not going nowhere without our friends
And we can't stop singing
Everybody's making sure we stay up till sunset
But we can't forget
If we ever find our way back
If we ever find our way back
First floor window opened up
As you tip-toe on the back porch
To meet the new girl on the corner
Make your big plans for the summer
If we ever find our way back
