It was a plane ride from LAX to O'Hare
And what happened next was a series of unfortunate events
(Please stay tuned for what happened next...)
The life I breathe for you gives to me new wounds
Well to patch and dress as I reflect on what else I could give you

Maybe I should blindly throw my faith
Into the next thing that comes my way
Standing at the back door with the life that she left behind
Are we all the same behind the frame
Beneath the glass and fake last names?
I've been waiting far too long to feel the sun on my back

It was a big bang
And a bright white light from no where
It turned my coach class window to
A first class seat on the evening news, on NBC
The life I gave for you is yours
So keep it, you oughta keep it
If I had one last chance to take it all back
You know I'd take take take you

Maybe I should blindly throw my faith
Into the next thing that comes my way
Standing at the back door with the life that she left behind
Are we all the same behind the frame
Between the glass and fake last names?
I've been waiting far too long to feel the sun on my back

"Apologies are all we'll ever be," she said
Standing on the stairs
Looking back, looking hard at me
"Well, life is long for those who have to wait," I said
It's the choice I had to make
The choice I had to make
It's the choice I had to...
(Make)
It was a plane ride. (plane ride)
It was a plain ride. (plain ride)
It was a plain ride
Just a plane...

Maybe I should blindly throw my faith
Into the next thing that comes my way
Standing at the back door with the life that I'd left behind
If we know the way we're gonna die
Through everything else we will survive
I've been waiting far too long to feel the sun on my back-
Yeah

But one day
