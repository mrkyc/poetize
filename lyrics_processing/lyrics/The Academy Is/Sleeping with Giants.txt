I've noticed, people, they all have motives
Different, yet all the same
I fumble through every word that was spoken
And I barely knew your name
I'm tongue-tied, it runs through my blood and my insides;
Some things we can't escape
But if we try, if we try, we can leave this behind

It's been a lifetime, a lifetime we waited for
A simple question, kid, "are you with me or not at all?"

Your eyes wide, always ahead of the curve type
Quiet, and confident
Oh, we stood there, awkward and youthful, we tangled;
A piece of my soul escaped
Oh, we are restless and tired of sleeping with giants
A modern mankind with their egos of fire and it seems like

It's been a lifetime, a lifetime we've waited for
A simple question, kid, "are you with me or not at all?"

Are we wasting time or is it wasting us?
It's been a lifetime waiting for now, now
Well, you've got to find a way
You've got to find a way
You've got to find a way
You've got to find a way
You've got to find a way before you fold
You might also like
It's been a lifetime, a lifetime I've been waiting for
A simple question, kid, "are you with me or not at all?"

It's been a lifetime, a lifetime we waited for
I need an answer, kid, you're either with me or not at all, no, no
Are we wasting time or is it wasting us?
It's been a lifetime, a lifetime, a lifetime, lifetime, yeah
Well, you've got to find a way
You've got to find a way
You've got to find a way
You've got to find a way
Son you've got to find a way
You've got to find a way
