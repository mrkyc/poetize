Don't be so scared, we will not lead you on
Like you've been doing for weeks
So you're selfish and I'm sorry
When I'm gone you'll be going nowhere fast
Nowhere fast, nowhere fast

Would you believe me if I said I didn't need you?
'Cause I wouldn't believe you if you said the same to me and
Near death, last breath and barely hanging on
Would you believe me if I said I didn't need you?

Don't be so scared to take a second for reflection
To take a leave of absence
See what you're made of
So I'm selfish and you're sorry
When I'm gone you'll be going nowhere fast
So who's selfish and who's sorry?

Would you believe me if I said I didn't need you?
'Cause I wouldn't believe you if you said the same to me and
Near death, last breath and barely hanging on
Would you believe me if I said I didn't need you?

Someone somewhere said some things
That may have sparked some sympathy
But don't believe
Don't believe a word you've heard about me

Don't be so scared
It's harder for me
Don't be so scared
Don't be so scared
It's harder for me
Don't be so scared
It's harder for me
Don't be so scared
It's harder for me
Don't be so scared

Would you believe me if I said I didn't need you?
'Cause I wouldn't believe you if you said the same to me and
Near death, last breath and barely hanging on
Would you believe me if I said I didn't need you?

Someone somewhere said some things
That may have sparked some sympathy
But don't believe
Don't believe a word you've heard
Would you believe me if I said I didn't need you?
'Cause I wouldn't believe you
Wouldn't believe you now
Would you believe me if I said I didn't need you?
'Cause I wouldn't believe you
