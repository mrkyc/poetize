So listen up (so listen up)
I worked in daylight feeding fashion to housewives
For just this once (for just this once)
I'll take my chances on truck stops and state lines

Go ahead and tell them again
Well, I think that I know they won't remember
Go out and tell them twice
Yeah, twice is nice
But three times is just right

Hey, hey
Now we're almost home
I'm missing you to death
But it's all for the best I know
Hey, hey
We're not far from home
And I've got my pride
And I'll let you sleep tonight

So listen up (so listen up)
My old friends have been dropping like houseflies
The smoking gun still sits in my pocket and I know how to use it
You might also like
Go ahead and tell them again
Well, I think that I know that I won't forgive them
For turning their backs when we started to get busy
Well, yeah, twice is fine, three times is just right

Hey, hey
Now we're almost home
I'm missing you to death
But to each his own
Hey, hey
We're not far from home
I've got my pride
And I'll let you sleep tonight
Hey, hey
Now we're almost home
I'm missing you to death
Missing you to death, oh
Hey, hey
We're not far from home
I'll swallow my pride and push back my seat tonight

I'm on my feet
I'm on my feet
I'm on my feet
I'm on my feet (this isn't like us anyway)
I'm on my feet (this isn't like us anyway)
I'm on my feet (this isn't like us anyway)
I'm running
Our time is almost
Our time is almost here
Our time is almost
Our time is almost here
Our time is almost (this isn't like us anyway)
Our time is almost here (this isn't like us anyway)
Our time is almost (this isn't like us anyway)
Our time is almost here
Our time is almost (this isn't like us anyway)
Our time is almost here (this isn't like us anyway)
Our time is almost (this isn't like us anyway)
Our time is almost here
Our time is almost (This isn't like us anyway)
