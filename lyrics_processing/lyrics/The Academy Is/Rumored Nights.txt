I walked you home most days
To beat the traffic after class
With all my best intentions
But when the weather changed
Like fine print, you were hard to read
Blind-folded, eyes wide open
Staring through me

I never heard the words that were spoken
With the rumored nights, with the rendezvous
I never thought the whispers were true 'til now

I saw things that I shouldn't have tonight, tonight
I know now what I couldn't have
I've gone too far to turn it back
I've gone too far to turn it back

Followed you home halfway
Over the fence to your backyard
With all my best intentions
And through your window frame
Outstretched and lying on your bed
Blind-folded, eyes wide open
Staring through me
You might also like
I never heard the words that were spoken
With the rumored nights, with the rendezvous
I never look at you like I used to now

I saw things that I shouldn't have tonight, tonight
I know now what I couldn't have
I've gone too far to turn it back
I've gone too far to turn it back

Uninvited, no one knows
How much I care, how bad you are
How good we'd be, but you won't let me in
Goodnight, I'm leaving

I never heard the words that were spoken
With the rumored nights, with the rendezvous
I never thought the whispers were true 'til now

I saw things that I shouldn't have tonight, tonight
I know now what I couldn't have
I've gone too far to turn it back
I've gone too far to turn it back
I saw things that I shouldn't have tonight, tonight
I know now what I couldn't have
I've gone too far to turn it back
I've gone too far to turn it back
I walked you home most days
I had the best intentions
I walked you home most days
I had the best intentions
