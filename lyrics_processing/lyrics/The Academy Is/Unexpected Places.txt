'Cause I've been looking at you
And I can read what you think, yeah
Don't cut no corners when you're talking to me
Like I don't know how it is
But I can see it
You've got no answers but you've got your concerns
About the people we see
And all the secrets we're keeping
I think about what you're expecting of me
Like you don't know how it is
But I can see all of it
We always have to wait
By the choice we had to make
You sold yourself so short
Is this the way to carry on?
In the most unexpected places...
Don't try and tell me you've been thinking of us
'Cause I will never believe you
Now you're shit out of luck, yeah
Don't cut no corners when you're talking to me
Like I don't know how it is
But I can see all of it

By the choices that we make
