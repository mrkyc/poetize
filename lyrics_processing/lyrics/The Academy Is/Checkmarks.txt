So there you are
And here I stand
As far as I remember
You weren't half bad
Your bedroom behavior was never more than checkmarks on bedposts
The more I remember we never had

Get me out of the rain
You get me out of my clothes
Hope I don't make a sound
You hope that nobody knows
Get me out of the rain
Get me out of my clothes
Hope I don't make a sound
You hope that no one

So suck your so-called pity down
It's not so bad, is it
So take your cold, cold heart and drown
And don't forget to take deep breaths
So suck your so-called pity down
It's not so bad, is it
So take your cold, cold heart and drown
And don't forget to take deep breaths
You might also like
So don't explain
'Cause I know exactly what you're going to say
Big words, recycled phrases
And the bittersweet taste of other boys on your lips
So now just sit here and talk about how you wanted it all
Now just sit here and talk about how you wanted it all
You wanted it all

Get me out of the rain
You get me out of my clothes
Hope I don't make a sound
You hope that nobody knows

So suck your so-called pity down
It's not so bad, is it
So take your cold, cold heart and drown
And don't forget to take deep breaths
So suck your so-called pity down
It's not so bad, is it
So take your cold, cold heart and drown
And don't forget to take deep breaths

Do you miss looking up from the floor at my face on a stage in a crowded room?
Well, it's not the same
I bet you're still a sucker for those famous faces
Downtown, looking down, down
Looking over the crowd
I hope you're out there, look at me now
Well, it's not the same
Just look at how we've changed
So suck your so-called pity down
It's not so bad, is it
So take your cold, cold heart and drown
And don't forget to take deep breaths
So suck your so-called pity down
It's not so bad, is it
So take your cold, cold heart and drown
