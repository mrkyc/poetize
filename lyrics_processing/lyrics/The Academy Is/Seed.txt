Looking for the ones that got away
A feeling of soft anticipation
Another confrontation I won't make
But how do we do it?
We turned into something else entirely, we fake it
But I wanted it so desperately to be real
Run, run, holding on to some pieces that you left behind
Hope now, as I walk away, you're the one that finds me out
Run from the only thing left that I hold close
While he's letting you in
You've got the feeling you've been followed under your skin
It will be weighing on your shoulder, believe it
If I could express it in a different dialect or in a delicate way
I'd capture the phrases inside the cage beneath my chest
And keep it locked for days
I wanted you so desperately to believe me
Run, run, why are you running from another conversation?
Someone that I've been planning on, you're the one that finds me out
There's nowhere, now I found you, that I won't go
While he's letting you in
You've got the feeling you've been followed under your skin
It will be weighing on your shoulder
You've got that seed in you
You've got that seed in you
You might also likeRun, run, what are you running from?
Let all your small steps expose your secrets
You don't have to speak for me to believe it
But what do you mean? Yeah...
Shaken and faint, you've got the feeling
You've been followed under your skin
It will be weighing on your shoulder
You've got that seed in you
You've got that seed in...
While letting you in
You've got the feeling you've been followed
Are you listening to anything I've said, said
To anything I've said, said
You've got that seed in you
Shaken and faint, it was the hardest thing to swallow
Pretending you don't miss me
You've got that seed in you
You've got that seed in...
While letting you in, I'll be thinking about tomorrow
And every time we cross those lines
You've got that seed in you
You've got that seed in...
