Close the door and take the stairs
Up or down, ups and downs
Well, don't pretend you've never been there
You kiss me like an over-dramatic actor
Who's starving for work
With one last shot to make it happen
You've won the role, you've played your part
You've been cordially invited
But I'm not impressed, and I'm definitely not excited
'Cause the film runs a shallow budget
And the writer's subject script isn't any deeper
So dive right in

Hollywood hills and suburban thrills
Hey you, who are you kidding?
I'm not like them, I won't buy in
Hollywood hills and suburban thrills
Hey you, who are you kidding?
Don't quit 'til 47
Then we'll turn it up, and we'll play a little faster

Take back everything you ever said
You never meant a word of it
You never did
Take back everything you said
You never meant a word of it
You never did

She said
"Alright alright, slow down"
Oh no, oh no, we won't
'Cause I regret everything that I said
To ever make her feel like she was something special
Or that she ever really mattered
Or did she ever really matter?

Hollywood hills and suburban thrills
Hey you, who are you kidding?
I'm not like them, I won't buy in
Hollywood hills and suburban thrills
Just don't count on this summer
Don't quit 'til 47
And then we'll turn it up, and we'll play a little faster

Take back everything you ever said
You never meant a word of it
You never did
Take back everything you said
You never meant a word of it
You never did
I'm not saying that I'm not breaking
Some hearts tonight, girl, oh
I'm not saying that I'm not breaking
Some hearts tonight, girl
Alright, alright, slow down

Take back everything you ever said
You never meant a word of it
You never did
Take back everything you said
You never meant a word of it
You never did

Hollywood hills and suburban thrills
Hey you, who are you kidding?
I'm not like them, I won't buy in
Hollywood hills and suburban thrills
Hey you, who are you kidding?
I'm not like them, I won't buy in
Hollywood hills and suburban thrills
Hey you, who are you kidding?
