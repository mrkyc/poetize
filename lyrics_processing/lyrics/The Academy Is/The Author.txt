Men meet your maker
I give you The Author
He may seem familiar because he looks like your mirror
You've lied like a lawyer
But don't deny it
When you're face to face with demons
Dancing off of mirror images
Reflecting all that you wanted
So far from perfect
Onward, we will strive
Take it for what it's worth
This truth that you've realized
You're not who you thought you were
It's time you see the other side of what you have become
Nothing but your single-serving selfish chapters
Of sacrificial moral standards
You're no stranger to apathy in bold situations
Take your time to make it happen
Leave your mirror
And spare your excuse as a self-serving actor
Who's so close to perfect
You might also likeIt's all the same
No face or complexion
You're not worth what you're spending
When you're screaming danger danger
Don't stop
Go on alone
Desperate endeavor
You've got to take it or leave it
If you will
It's not so convincing
That you're the only one here who can't be like me
The search has begun
Leave your letters but it won't matter
Take back what is left before your death
But is it really you that they suspect
You take shots
Who's the figure before the flame
It's not hard to spark
But it's hard to master
So look for the answer
Single-serving selfish chapters on your condition
Lust and liars
So get out
Stop dreaming
If you're one for breathing
Sacrificial moral standards of two reflections
Truth and fire
Something you'll live for
So close to perfect
It's all you've got
One chance for conviction
Lies fuel fires
And your suspect won't walk
When you're screaming danger danger
Don't
Don't stop
Go on alone
Desperate endeavor
You've got to take it or leave it
If you will
It's not so convincing
That you're the only one who could be like me
From this point on
The way you thought it would all work out
But we've hit Autumn
Just follow the story
The fall of The Author
Just one more year
And you'll cease to regret
One on one to repent
All eyes are fading
