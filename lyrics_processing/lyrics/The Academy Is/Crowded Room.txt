Excuse me? Yeah I'm talking to you
Look in the mirror, could you tell me what you see?
Hard hearts are crashing in a crowded room
You never felt so good, you never felt so free

Save you from yourself
Before you start to deal with everyone else
You should have kept it to yourself
Now we're looking to fight, this isn't alright
Alright, you better hold your scripted tongue
If you ever plan to use those words again
The future doesn't make much sense
With you at the helm with your friends
This is where that ends

You've got a problem here
The tide is turning you inside out

This won't take long, your reign is done
We are the innocent ones
You can't take back the damage done
This is the last time you will shine
You might also like
Spare us your excuse
Cuz this exercise of self-abuse
Will swallow everything that you hold dear
The further you are, the closer we get
The more you need to hold your scripted tongue
If you ever plan to use those words again
The hallways are filled with silence
And gawking stares that don't care
This is where that ends

You've got a problem here
The tide is turning you inside out

This won't take long, your reign is done
We are the innocent ones
You can't take back the damage done
This is the last time, last time
This won't take long, your reign is done
We are the innocent ones
You can't take back the damage done
This is the last time you will shine
This is the last time you will shine
The last time you will shine
Shine
This won't take long, your reign is done
We are the innocent ones
You can't take back the damage done
This is the last time you will shine, shine
