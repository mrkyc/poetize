I took a step back as the room was filling up
And I was packed up against these people who were tossing up a strong vibe
Now the door's locked and the shower's on
And I realize I don't recognize anyone, but I don't mind
Well, the neighbors have complained damn near every night
The neighbors have complained damn near every night

You should've shown up, should've shown up by now
You should've shown up by now
With a knock at the door, the knock at the door as it goes
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh

Well, now everybody's losing control
Intoxicated circulation
Just trying to sit back and get my palette whet
Get me mentally prepared for the consequences
And you know why
Because that knock at the door calls the crowd to quiet
The neighbors have complained damn near every night

You should've shown up, should've shown up by now
You should've shown up by now
Give it a rest, give it a rest, give it a rest
You should've shown up, should've shown up by now
Yeah, should've shown up by now
With a knock at the door, the knock at the door as it goes
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh

There's no one left
Lying on the second story floorboards
And I'm sure they heard next door
But the bottles are hollow now
And there's room at the bottom
And I would take it all back
If I could but I won't

Sit back and get my palette whet
And get me mentally prepared for the consequences
And you know why
'Cause the neighbors have complained damn near every night
The neighbors have complained damn near every night

You should've shown up, should've shown up by now
You should've shown up by now
Give it a rest, give it a rest, give it a rest
You should've shown up, should've shown up by now
Yeah, should've shown up by now
With a knock at the door, the knock at the door as it goes
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh
