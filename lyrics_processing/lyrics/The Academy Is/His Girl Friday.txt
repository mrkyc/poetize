If you knew what you do
When no one's in the dark room
But me and you, our brilliant disguise
It's the taste of the chase, I do confess
It's the mess that feels so right

Call on a Monday, come on a Tuesday
They'll never know, pop off a cork for a
Wednesday, play with me Thursday
But she'll always be his girl
Call on a Monday, come on a Tuesday
They'll never know, pop off a cork for a
Wednesday, stay with me Thursday
But she'll always be his girl
His girl Friday
His girl Friday
His girl Friday
His girl Friday
His girl Friday
His girl Friday

Just a kiss, he won't miss
You know you're gonna miss this
As long as you live, when you were mine
Bite your lip, pull me in, it's not the sin
It's the mess that feels so right
You might also like
Call on a Monday, come on a Tuesday
They'll never know, pop off a cork for a
Wednesday, play with me Thursday
But she'll always be his girl
Call on a Monday, come on a Tuesday
They'll never know, pop off a cork for a
Wednesday, stay with me Thursday
But she'll always be his girl
His girl Friday
His girl Friday
His girl Friday
His girl Friday
His girl Friday
His girl Friday

If he knew what I knew
He'd thank God it's Friday
He's out of luck, I'm with you

Call on a Monday, come on a Tuesday
They'll never know, pop off a cork for a
Wednesday, play with me Thursday
But she'll always be his girl
Call on a Monday, come on a Tuesday
They'll never know, pop off a cork for a
Wednesday, stay with me Thursday
But she'll always be his girl
His girl Friday
His girl Friday
His girl Friday
His girl Friday
His girl Friday
His girl Friday
His girl Friday
His girl Friday
His girl Friday
His girl Friday
His girl Friday
