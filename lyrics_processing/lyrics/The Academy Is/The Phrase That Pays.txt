My eyes can't believe what they have seen
In the corner of your room you've stockpiled millions of my memories
Oh, doctor, doctor
I must have gotten this sick somehow
I'm going to ask you a series of questions
And I want them answered on the spot
Right now
"Is it serious?"
"I'm afraid it is"
"Am I gonna die?"
"Well, son
Death is gonna catch up to all one day
But yours is coming quicker than ours, than ours"
Some things I may have taken for granted again and again
Well, here's what was said then

Hold your head high, heavy heart

So take a chance and make it big
'Cause it's the last you'll ever get
If we don't take it
When will we make it
I make plans to break plans
And I've been planning something big
Planning something big
Planning

I never tried to make the best of my time
When I thought that I had plenty of it
Is this serious?
I don't know what to think
Is it all a lie?
Well, one thing's for sure
I'm taken back to the glory days
When, when we were kids without a brash or bitter thing to say
Now my life is one make it or break it

Hold your head high, heavy heart
And save your strength for the morning after

So take a chance and make it big
'Cause it's the last you'll ever get
If we don't take it
When will we make it
I make plans to break plans
And I've been planning something big
Planing something big
So take a chance and make it big
'Cause it's the last you'll ever get
If we don't take it
When will we make it
I make plans to break plans
And I've been planning something big
Planning something big
Planning

Hold your head high, heavy heart
And save your strength for the morning after

So take a chance and make it big
'Cause it's the last you'll ever get
If we don't take it
When will we make it
I make plans to break plans
And I've been planning something big
Planing something big
So take a chance and make it big
'Cause it's the last you'll ever get
If we don't take it
When will we make it
I make plans to break plans
And I've been planning something big
Planning something big
