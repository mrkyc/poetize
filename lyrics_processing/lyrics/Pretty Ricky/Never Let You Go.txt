Baby girl, don't leave, I need somebody 'round here to help smooth things out
Like comin' off the road from tourin' to a happy home
See that's what I'm talkin' about? I'm givin' you the benefit of the doubt
You're gettin' all mad and got me sleepin' on the couch
You tryna get chicken but right here, girl, you got steak
Stop tryna break up somethin' good, you gotta have faith
'Cause it's in God's hands, plus I'm bein' a bigger man
And I'm a veteran, come on, girl, gimme one more chance

You was there before the deal, me and you was like Jack and Jill
All I wanted was a varsity jacket and a yearbook to remember the years
See you stopped believin' in me when I needed you the most
Now you want a weddin' ring, the most I propose is a toast
I was beggin' you to stay, pleadin' with you not to leave
But you left me anyway and all that I could do is grieve
I thought I needed you, thought I couldn't be nothin' without ya
Now I'm the one you're beggin' to because I made it without ya
Ooh, you're in my heart, you're in my soul
You're on my mind, all the time
You're in my heart, you're in my soul
You're on my mind, all the time

Baby girl, take your time (Baby girl, take your time)
Please don't rush to go (Please don't rush and go)
I can't ever let you leave (I can't ever let you leave)
And I don't wanna have to see ya go
No, no, I can't let you go (Girl, I'm never ever gonna let you go)
No, no, I can't let you go (Girl, I'm never ever gonna let you go)
No, no, I can't let you go (Girl, I'm never ever gonna let you go)
