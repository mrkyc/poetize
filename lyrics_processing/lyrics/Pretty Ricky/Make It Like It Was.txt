But I can't find no one
Oh, oh, oh

That's how people fall in love (In love)
First kiss (First kiss), first touch (First touch)
Can we make it like it was? (It was)
When we were (We were), in love (In love)
Can we make it like it was?
See the love I have, that I have for you
I can't explain it for you, girl
Because I've been around the world, and I met a lot of other girls But they're nothin' like you
No, no, no, no

See I came at it and I came at it (Oh)
Now I'm so addicted like a gamblin' habit (Oh)
'Cause you was the one here when I ain't have it (No)
Now you say you leavin' me, but I ain't havin' it
We put too much in just to pull out
This thang just too good for me to pull out
Girl, you know Pleasure can't stand to see you cryin'
So I'ma love you, or die tryin'

No, no, no, no (I been wantin' to tell you this for a very long time)

I reminisce on the way that it was (First kiss, first hug)
24-7 you was on my mind (Baby girl, you was my first love)
We closer than the pages in my composition book
But I let you walk in front so them other players can look
And when they tried to holla, you point at me and say that you took
And you been in my heart, before I know that you can cook, cook
Girl, you shine like a brand new dime
The love I have for you is more than all my chicks combined, for real (Oh, oh, no-no-no, no-no-no-no, no-no)

See pleasure is pain (Pain), and pain is love (Love)
First kiss, first touch, first hug
God had to send you up from above
Two jittybugs on the back of the bus kissin' like we grown ups
But we broke up
All of the pain we went through is on us
A couple months went by, then we woke up
Break up to make up, girl, you know us
And yeah, they try, But they'll never be able to do
All the things that you do (Girl)
They ain't got your style, your body and your smile
They ain't really off the chain like you
Because I showed you how to ride it (Ride it)
And you showed me how you like it
When it's time for that good lovin'
You read my mind like a psychic
So whenever I'm gone, you worryin' 'bout your king to return to his throne
That's why our love is so strong
And you ain't ever gotta worry 'bout me doin' wrong
Just long as you come back home (Come back, girl, girl)
'Cause this where you 'posed to be
Right here close to me, on the side of me (Oh, I love you)
Baby girl, you can ride with me (I love you)
'Cause with you is where I'm tryna be, you know I love you, girl (I love you, babe)
That's how people fall in love (In love)

No, no, no, no

You know I love ya
Frozen cup your wrist, so I can spoil ya
Hold ya and never ignore ya
Adore ya, when times get hard, I'll do anything for ya
'Member back in the days, Parkway
Catch a early matinee day at the Omni
Rubbin' oil of Olay on your body, hot tamale
Because you're my shorty, 'cause you're my shorty
Life passes by when you're busy makin' plans
I'm a bigger man, a veteran
A business man, a gentleman
I know you're so sick and tired of my ignorance
I can't breathe, I can't get no sleep
Without you, my life is incomplete (I can't sleep)
Picnics at the park, eatin' corn on the cob, real talk, from the start (I can't think)
You got the keys to my heart, that's a promise to God (Without your love)

That's how people fall in love (In love)
First kiss (First kiss), first touch (First touch)
Can we make it like it was? (It was)
When we were (We were), in love (In love)
