You hit me up on your cell phone
You go, girl, with your thong-th-thong-thong-thong
Sexy black, come over here
And let me put a few love voices in your ear
You smiled at me, girl, you're so fly
Shorty, you never had a love like I

Think about you all the time, you on my speed dial
Don't answer the phone and I'll be damned if I hit redial
(Can you hear me now?) Good
From the first time I called I knew you understood (Ooh-woah, oh)
But do you comprehend, girl? Get with the plan
I'm like one hour, compared to a minute man
I'm everlastin', I want longevity
Under Pretty Ricky, baby, where you need to be (Yeah, yeah-eh)

I'm like a love rollercoaster, flip you over (Oh-ho), make you scream my real name
Hollerin' Diamond Blue Smith when you feel the pain (Ooh-oh, oh-ho)

Easter, Christmas, Thanksgivin', even Valentine's?
Forever in a day and beyond, baby, what's wrong?
