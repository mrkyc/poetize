Yeah, yeah, yeah

Baby, let me lay ya down on the carpet when I come 'round
Get rug burns when I tear you down on the ground, all I wanna hear is that "ooh, ahh" sound
I'ma push up on ya slow, get ya right by the end of the night
Do somethin' sweet, like massage your feet and put Pretty Ricky CD on repeat then
Get a ice cream and put in work, go to the kitchen for a lil' dessert
I love butter pecan ice cream, eat cake, but I lick off the icin'
Maxin' and relaxin', I'm guaranteein' satisfaction
Give you fast or slow back action, dependin' on your reaction, girl

It's seven in the evenin'
Everybody's leavin' (Everybody's leavin')
I decided to stay in (Hoo)
I just felt like chillin'

And I wondered if (If) you felt the same (The same)
Just say the word, I'll be on my way (Woah-woah, ho)
I'm just a few (A few), few blocks away (Away)
I just wanna see (Wanna see your pretty face)

All I'd like to do is lay with you tonight (Hey)
I don't wanna hit the club, I wanna lay up
(And when I come over) I'll get you right (I will), get you right
(I will) Get you right
We can do anything that you wanna do
And before I go home, I'll get you right (Woo)
See Pretty Ricky LiveGet tickets as low as $180You might also like
I picture me holdin' you
I picture you holdin' me
We can watch a movie, girl
I just bought some brand new DVD's

And I wondered if (And I wondered if) you felt the same (You felt the same)
Just say the word, I'll be on my way
I'm just a few (A few), few blocks away (Away)
I just wanna see (Wanna see your pretty face)

All I'd like to do is lay with you tonight (I wanna lay with you, baby)
I don't wanna hit the club (I wanna chill with you, baby), I wanna lay up
('Cause, 'cause, when I come over) I'll get you right (I will), get you right
(I will) Get you right (Woo)
We can do anything that you wanna do
And before I go home, I'll get you right

When I leave my house, I hope that you'll be
Lookin' for me and you'll be waitin' for me, 'cause I will
(Ah-hoo) I'll be speedin' all the way (Ah-hoo)
And when I get there, I'll get you right (Woo)
You call my phone and told me, "Baby, come through"
I said, "Unlock the door, and I'll be there in a few"
Brought Love & Basketball and ordered some food
Now it's time to do all the things that you wanna do, boo
Opened the door, locked it back and head into the room
Popped in the movie, hit the lights and laid next to you
Cuddle under the covers, kissin' and huggin' while I get you right (Yeah)
Forget the club and goin' out, baby, I'm spendin the night (Sling ding, sling ding, baby, girl)

It feel like Heaven when I'm with ya, baby, I just wanna chill with ya
Spend some time with ya, wine and dine with ya, in my mind I'm paintin' a beautiful picture
Of me and you spendin' Q-T, on the lowkey, baby we
Overseas knockin' boots like H-Town, you holdin' me
Girl, you got me feenin' like Jodeci (Haha), this is where I wanna be
With you screamin', "We out here," so what they do?
'Cause baby, I'm so in love with ya, everywhere I go, I got your picture
Baby, I miss ya I just wanna spend some time with ya

All I'd like to do is lay with you tonight
I don't wanna hit the club, I wanna lay up
('Cause, 'cause, when I come over) I'll get you right (I will), get you right
(I will) Get you right (Woo)
We can do anything that you wanna do
