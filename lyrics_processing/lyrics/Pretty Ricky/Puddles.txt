Ohhhh
You ain't gotta say to much to me
Cus I know how to get your body wet for me
Woahh when I go down
I'ma have your body so weak leave a puddle in the sheets
When I go down and baby I'ma keep it coming all night
I'm bout to take it over

The way you leave a puddle in the sheets
Got me feeling like I'm on the beach
Got you bent over on the seat
Like a scuba diver magiva I'm bout to go deep
Brought a umbrella cus that thing dripping
How its so wet and its still gripping?
Smell like fruit let a nigga sip it
Taste like fruit eat it in the kitchen
Soaked up the covers
Mami pussy wet like butter
Every time I fuck she ask me if I love her
And I tell her hell yea I don't even stunt
Got my latex on cus cus I'm wetter then a motherfucker
Open up let me wet them vocals
Shorty squirt like super soakers
Met her in the atl that strokers
She'll be eating that meat like vultures

And I love the way you get down
Hell naw we ain't fall off
