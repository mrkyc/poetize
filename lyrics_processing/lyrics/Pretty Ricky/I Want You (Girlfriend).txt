My buddy and kid sister, you and me
Get down like two flats on the side of the street
First I gave my heart then I gave you the key
Then I stepped up to the plate and gave you all of me
You had me fallin' like some leaves in the summer (Summer, baby)
You had me fixin' things like I was a plummer (Ayy)
You do the math, man around the house
I did it all for you, baby, what you talkin' 'bout?

I started out talkin' to your best friend
Next thing I knew you was my girlfriend
I got beef with your ex-boyfriend
But it's all good 'cause (You're my baby)
It ain't no problem Baby Blue can't solve
Cause I relieve headaches without Tylenol
With you on the sideline, your boy gon' ball
I give you my all, girl (Ohh)

I know you used to me bein' slick and slimy
Comin' home late when I'm with the boys, I'm shinin' (Baby girl, what's wrong?)
We started like a nappy head to a hot comb
One minute I'm there, the next I'm gone
I gave you a shoulder to lean on, a team to be on
Got your head spinnin' like a bottle of rum
Let's get it on, beatin' the stomach up while I'm in the zone
I'm ready to come home to see my queen on the throne
You'll be my girlfriend
And I'll be you boyfriend
Let's make it official
Cause I want you, girl

I really want you, baby (Want you, baby)
I need you in my life (In my life)
I got to have you honey
I want to spend some time
Girl I want you like the new J's
You're sweeter than candy
Divine like wine, girl, you're one of a kind
So fine, I think about you all the time
You're always on my mind

You'll be my girlfriend
