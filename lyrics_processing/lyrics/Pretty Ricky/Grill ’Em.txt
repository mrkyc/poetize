I got a blue Impala on some blue rims
When I'm stompin' in New York, I wear my blue Tims
I'm a Bluestar, rapper not a singer
I got blue leather interior and blue Power Rangers
Blue diamonds in my grill, blue underwear
New blue socks, blue rocks in my watch
Blue Air Force Ones when I'm chillin' with Nelly
Got girls puttin' "I love you, Baby Blue" 'cross they belly
Baby Blue be the truth in that baby blue coupe with no roof gettin' these chickens loose
I back that Goose, Pretty Ricky and Pitbull runnin' Miami, what they do?
I'm a gangsta more OG than Cheerios spilled on Gucci seats
I run my turf like Nike cleats, Baby Blue, Pretty Ricky, man, that be me
You see, I see, you see, that I got blue ice in my teeth
And I see, you see, we be, cruisin' up the block in that blue Bentley
With no chauffeur, keepin' the toaster in a holster
You in your Testarossa, we cruisin' up in a coaster

Blue panties comin' off your dame, blue cards like a poker game
