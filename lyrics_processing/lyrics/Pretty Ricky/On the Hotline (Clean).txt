And I'm up talkin' dirty to you, you (Moan for me, moan for me)
And now I'm on the hotline
Over here, lustin' for you, you (Moan for me, moan for me)
Let's talk about sex, baby, let's talk about you and me
Let's talk about bubbles in the tub, let's talk about makin' love (Love)
Let's talk about cherries on top, girl, it's goin' down (Down)
Said I wanna talk dirty to you, baby, on the hotline (On the hotline)

The sun ain't up but, I had to call ya
'Cause I'm home alone lustin' for ya
I'm in my room, nothin' but a towel on
Take them granny panties off, put a thong on
I love it when I hear ya moan
You got that sexy tone that turns your boy on
You in a complete 'nother city on the fanline
With nothin' but a baby tee on
You the kinda girl that's sexy in some boxer shorts
I'm the kinda player to make you ride it like a Porsche
Yeah, I met you on MySpace
Now I'm 'bout to fly you out to my place, in the mornin'

It's 5:30 in the mornin' (Good mornin'), I'm yawnin' (I'm yawnin')
I'm lonely (I'm lonely, come on), I'm touchin' and rubbin'
Call me (Call me, yes), my darlin' (My darlin')
Called you seven times, baby girl, don't stall me (No)
I wanna kiss you from your temple to your feet
From the dimples in your cheek, the tattoo on your belly ring
Conversation underneath the sheet
You know me, Red Bull like a energy, I'm a freak (Yeah)

Girl, you know I put it down like a vet
Say the sound of my deep voice make her sweat
You call me, 5:00 a.m. on the dot
Now I'm thinkin' 'bout you from the bottom to the top
Picture this, you say you comin' over
Thirty minutes later you was parkin' the Rover
Jumped out the car and I met you at the door
Three seconds in the house and you're beggin' me for more
Kiss you in your mouth, lay your hands on my cheeks
Straight action on the carpet, rug burns on my knees
Overdose on this love, scratch marks on my chest
Satisfy guaranteed with the playboy Spec'
It's five in the mornin'
And I'm up talkin' dirty to you, you (Moan for me, moan for me)
And now I'm on the hotline
