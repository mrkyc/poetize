It's four o'clock in the mornin'
And she ain't feelin' right
I'm on a first class trip
Through this place called life
I don't know what to do
'Cause my body's still shakin'
I know it's time to man up
And start my education
I need someone to call on
So I called on my best friend
I said, "Bro, I can't take it"
He said, "Boy, stop trippin'"
So I hung up the phone
Packed my shit and got right
I know what I gotta do now
Be a man and face life

Maybe we could work it out
'Cause you know I can't live without you
And every time I think about it
I know a nigga can't live without you
Ain't no need to cry about it
'Cause you know I can't live without you (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
I even wrote a song about it
'Cause you know I can't live without you
See Pretty Ricky LiveGet tickets as low as $180You might also like
At the beginnin' you was gone, I was stayin' with my mama (Mama, damn)
I stayed gettin' in trouble, man, straight damn drama (Straight damn drama)
I started dancin' so I stay outta trouble (Trouble)
'Cause I stayed in school, sellin' candy so my money doubled (Let's get this money)
But then you told me, "man, dancin' was for punks"
Then you told me come and stay and you ain't care what I want (You ain't care what I want, bet that up)
You told me come and dance and rap with my brothers (For sure)
You taught me how to love and how to care for my brothers (I love y'all boys)
And then you taught me all your hustlin' skills (Hustlin' skills)
Just in case I get alone, I know how to pay bills (We millionaires)
You told me I was straight, regardless of a deal
And I love you, man, for that cause you always kept it real (Always kept it real, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)

Maybe we could work it out
'Cause you know I can't live without you
And every time I think about it
I know a nigga can't live without you (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Ain't no need to cry about it
'Cause you know I can't live without you (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
I even wrote a song about it (Yeah, I wrote a song about it)
'Cause you know I can't live without you (I'm finna make you cry right now, I can't live without you)

Now that I made it, it feel real good (Real good), take you out the hood
Put you on billionaire block in the middle of the woods (In the middle of the woods)
And as hard as it seemed, you was there for me
One bedroom apartment on six-oh and fourteen, them efficiencies down in Cloverly
(Told you I had a dream) And even though I like to cheat
I'm gonna love my Georgia peach and that's a promise I'm gon' keep her
To the end, never gon' bend and I can hear you tellin' your friends
And I can't see you on the bus, start flossin' with your brand new Benz (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
In the world, baby, it's yours, I'd give you the world
'Cause you not no ordinary girl (Girl), I'm your son and you my ol' girl (Girl)
My momma, we share for 19 years
And from the bottom of my foundation, I'm tellin' you how I feel, and I love ya (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Maybe we could work it out
'Cause you know I can't live without you
And every time I think about it
I know a nigga can't live without you (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Ain't no need to cry about it
'Cause you know I can't live without you (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
I even wrote a song about it
'Cause you know I can't live without you (I can't live without you)

See, I fell in love with ya (In love with ya), wanna raise my kids with ya (My kids with ya)
But you left me all along with tears drippin' down the picture
I remember the day like yesterday, May 9th to be exact
I'd do anything to get you back, even though I know you ain't coming back
I'm serious as a heart attack, could we get it back the way it was?
'Cause I know you had some outside influences that pulled the plug
The reality, Junebug, girl, I know we'll always be together
I got you locked away deep in my heart, always here forever (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)

Maybe we could work it out
'Cause you know I can't live without you
And every time I think about it
I know a nigga can't live without you (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Ain't no need to cry about it
'Cause you know I can't live without you (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
I even wrote a song about it
