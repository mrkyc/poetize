Verse 1 (Diamond Blue)
Can't holla at a chick if she don't blow up
Now let your boy smash micro blast
Jazmine Sullivan bust my windows out
Cause I didn't call her back
Told her I love her just so I could smash that
Now that's cold-blooded but I admit that
Now she all mad oops my bad
I'm sorry I love you take your boy back
Now that other dude wack
Running game like dick tack
I keep it real with you straight like that

Her body full of goosebumps but the doors closed

I make the whole bed shake like an earthquake
I bang up like a birthday cake
