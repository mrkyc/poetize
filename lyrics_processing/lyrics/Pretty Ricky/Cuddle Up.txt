Ooooh, let's not make love
Let's just cuddle up
Take me in your arms
And squeeze me tighter

I love it when you next to me
Got me numb like butter from your body heat
Spectac got the recipe, how I make you moan girl with the best of me
You're special, one of a kind
Hit the light switch and know that ass mines
When I'm with you, my phone on mute
When we spendin' QT, girl it's all about you
Ain't no limit to the foreplay
How I make you feel good in the right way
Get nasty, buck as a icee
I'm a do it slow, make you feel nicely
In my arms, cuddled up
Sex so good got you folded up
Pretty Ricky, the kings of romance
We ain't gon' stop so cancel your plans, Spectac

Ooooh, let's not make love
Let's just cuddle up
Take me in your arms
And squeeze me tighter

Yeah, my baby don't wanna creep with me
'Cause she wanna sleep
I hit the club on the late night creep
Where the ballas deep
Come to my house or just follow me to the hotel suite
Just chill, and relax
And we ain't really really gotta have sex
Let a Blue Star hold ya girl
I got a lot of nice things I wanna show ya girl
Rican, puerto rican
That's twenty four hours of me and you just freakin
I came to chill with my cutie
My cutie is my duty
Just chill, and relax
Relax, relax, relax, relax, come on girl

Ooooh, let's not make love
Let's just cuddle up
Take me in your arms
And squeeze me tighter
All I need is love
All I want is love
I don't need the big wedding or the wedding ring
Boy, I'll take the castle made of sand if you love me unconditionally
Whoa, we ain't gotta make love tonight
Let's just (cuddle up baby, cuddle up baby)
Yeah, hold ya tight in my arms then let's (cuddle up baby, cuddle up baby)
Yeah, whoa, you make me feel so warm when we (cuddle up baby, cuddle up baby)
