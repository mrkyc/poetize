Yeah, haha
It'll make you mad
Comin' live from the 305, woo
It's what they do, baby
This song goes out to all my dope riders
My Chevy riders on them 24's with the spinnin' hubcaps, baby
Y'all know what time it is

26's on my Chevy (My Chevy), chrome on my Chevy (My Chevy)
Candy on my Chevy (My Chevy), blades on my Chevy
Dudes on my Chevy (My Chevy), girls in my Chevy (My Chevy)
Screens in my Chevy (My Chevy), shove in my Chevy

I'm so high
I'm so high (Did I stutter? Yeah, I'm a Chevy boy, yeah, uh)

Man, I ride so high like my rims smoke a pound of dro, when I'm sittin' on 24's
Matter fact that was a year ago, now I'm ridin' on 26's, your boy, yeah, Kelly Rowland
In the back of my seats, man, six-four when I'm hittin' them switches
Seven-trey sittin' on deep dishes, S500 with the LG kit, mane
I'm doin' numbers so don't try to screw me, track already screwed and I'm eatin' like Snoopy
I got a pocket full of bread, my girl givin' me head in the back row at the movies
Interior Gucci, please don't stank my seat with your coochie, excuse me
I smell pussy
I never deal with a ho who smell like sushi, I know you gotta go, trick, introduce me
(Now Blue, you know you wrong for that) Slick, hol' up

You could call me Bigfoot when I'm in my donk
'72 Chevy with the shove in the trunk
Suede on the seats with the suicide doors
Neon light to make the dashboard glow
Paint swirled up like apple pie
Sayin', "Hi," 'cause super-sized all the time
Two seconds will get me from zero to sixty
I ain't pullin' over, you better come get me
Girls go wild when I'm on the scene
My seat belt buckle got TV screens
Bluestar stuck all 'cross the glass
And you could hear them pipes when I hit the gas

26's on my Chevy (My Chevy), chrome on my Chevy (My Chevy)
Candy on my Chevy (My Chevy), blades on my Chevy
Dudes on my Chevy (My Chevy), girls in my Chevy (My Chevy)
Screens in my Chevy (My Chevy), shove in my Chevy

Now what ya hatin' for? (What ya hatin' for?) Is it the '75? (Is it the '75?)
On them glass rims (On them glass rims), with the chrome trim (With the chrome trim)
The way I roll up (Roll up), calm and laid back (Laid back)
Just hit a button, drop the top, I know they hate that
Keep smell of fear, let's make it clear, these players ain't real, they counterfeit
Needs some Lysol 'cause Pretty Ricky, Ricky, Ricky, Ricky is the shh, yeah
Cutlass skatin', vibratin', got the street shakin'
"Slick, what that is?" Nothin' but them 12s quakin', player

26's on my Chevy (My Chevy), chrome on my Chevy (My Chevy)
Candy on my Chevy (My Chevy), blades on my Chevy
Dudes on my Chevy (My Chevy), girls in my Chevy (My Chevy)
Screens in my Chevy (My Chevy), shove in my Chevy

I'm so high
