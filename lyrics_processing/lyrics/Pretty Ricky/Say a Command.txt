I can't believe i got my self in this situation
That computer love got my heart speed racing
I like to get you hot hotter than a oven
I know what turn you on like a power button
When i plug you up it in a socket
Hit you with that hard drive make you yell stop it
Keep you up graded get you new cords
Got so tight i went to meet them other boys
Baby girl i love you and can't nobody tell me that it ain't true
If i lose you its like cuttin a orderly
The love of my life you will always be apart me
