Yeah
Come on
Let's Ride
Me and You
And you and me
Y'all riding on some 22s and 23s
We riding on some 24s down on the beach
No one flosses better
Mavericks...Prettie Rick

Got my wicks shaking in the wind
Chromed out whip wit the fins
Seen a fine chick let her in
She don't like me she like my homeboy benz
Riding in a four dot range
Sitting on Patrick Surtain's (23's)
Range Rover on D's
They call me honey cause I got B's

Now gone wit yo bad self
Damn it ain't no gas left
You know I got to float up the block
Ride real slow but don't stop
It's ninety degrees so it ain't no top
It's Prettie Rick world so it ain't no cops
I can do whatever I want
It's three in the morning we beating the funk

Y'all riding on some 22s and 23s
We riding on some 24s down on the beach
No one flosses better
Me and You
And you and me
Y'all riding on some 22s and 23s
We riding on some 24s down on the beach
We flossin forever

Flossing
Rims stay Glossing
Bluestars stay Bossing
Throw them bows get off me
Girlfriend my name Spectacular
Jump in my ride and be my passenger
Hit you from the front and the back of ya
And I'll flip that thang like a spatula (like a spatula)

Bluestars
Babyblue whoa
Droptop riding on chrome
Got the car that came with the phone
Got the girl that came with the dome
Now behind the wheel I'm a drone
See me speed up like vrooome
I let the putt putt pass put my foot on the gas
Then vroom vroom I'm gone
