Uh, yeah, yes, sir

I got new shoes on my ride (Uh, yes, sir)
Rollin' down 95 (Uh, yeah, yes, sir)
And you can see in my eyes (Yes, sir)
That I'm lookin' for a cutie pie (Yes, sir)
And we ain't gotta make love (Yes, sir)
And we can just cuddle up (Yes, sir)
But if she want me to beat it up (Yes, sir)
Then damn it, I'll beat it up (Yes, sir)

My body, your body (Is burnin' up)
My body, your body (Is burnin' up)
My body, your body (Is burnin' up)

I don't know why, but the ladies call me Baby Blue then stick 'em
They take me and rape me and make me their victim
I lick 'em and freak 'em, if they married, I sneak 'em
If they look like wifey material, then I keep 'em
Stunnin' through the city tryna find a lady who's
Beautiful but she gotta have booty too
Baby Blue gon' let you do what you wanna do
You could feel on it if you really want to, ah-hoo-ah
Get a taste of this salami
Knock, knock, knock, knock you down like a tsunami, bustin' you like a tommy
I'm ahead of my class, gettin' head in the Jag
Look in the duffle bag, see Benjamin head on the cash
See Pretty Ricky LiveGet tickets as low as $180You might also like

Top down, Bluestar tag
Oak match the bear skin rugs in the jag
Spectac' with the bad chick in the back
Tryna beat it up like a Everlast punchin' bag
Hotter than a Bisquick biscuit out the oven
Your baby mama go on missions to get this lovin'
We kissin' and huggin', she never pick the phone up
You be lookin' for her while we be doing the grown up
She complain when she catch back spasms
But she loves when she get the back-to-back orgasms
Yes, sir, the game is automatic
Give it to them one time and they come back like addicts

Well let me step up in this thang right, lookin', smellin' good
Lookin' good, Spec' and Baby Blue and Pleasure, fool (That's all we got)
Let me drop my top, pull up in the parkin' lot
Grab a grape soda, bag of chips (That's all I got)
Park outside rims minglin' with my homeboys
Fake dap, fake hugs, leave me 'lone, boy
Plus the Caddy lookin' good enough to eat
You can tell by the way the girls actin' 'cross the street
But on the other hand, Alfalfa just hit me on my metro cell
Party in the Ball Hog, baby, let's go
The block was thick no questions asked
So I jumped out the white Jag smooth like Shaft, come here, girl
I got new shoes on my ride (Yes, sir)
Rollin' down 95 (Yes, sir)
And you can see in my eyes (Uh, yeah, yes, sir)
