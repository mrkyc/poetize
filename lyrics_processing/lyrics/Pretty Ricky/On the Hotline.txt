Call me (Call me, yes), you comin'? (You comin'?)
Called you seven times, baby girl, don't stall me
I wanna kiss you from your temple to your feet
To the dimples in your cheek, to the middle of your G-string
Conversation underneath the sheets

Baby girl said she love phone sex
Say the sound of my deep voice make her wet
You call me, 5:00 a.m. on the dot
Now I'm thinkin' 'bout you with panties no top
Picture this, you say you comin' over
Thirty minutes later you was parkin' the Rover
Jumped out the car and I met you at the door
Three seconds in the house and ya panties on the floor
Kiss you in ya mouth, lay ya hips on my cheeks
Straight action on the carpet, rug burns on my knees
Now you on the phone like, "Damn I made a mess"
