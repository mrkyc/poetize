See the lust in your eye, I know you can't hide it
In your walk, in your vibe, make me wanna try it
Like a 'Lac spinnin' rims, I love it when you ride it
You a stallion, baby, you know you got body

You workin' that thang, you twerkin' that thang
I love them G-strings, it's just a "G" thang
I'm murkin' that thang, I'm twerkin' that thang
Still strokin' that thang, it's just a "G" thang

Can you make it juicy for me?

Butt-naked in the classroom on the teacher's school desk (Desk)
Triple X rated, call me Slick'em Hound (Yeah, Slick'em Hound)
I get that body wet and then I lick 'em down (I lick 'em down)
I'm on point and best believe I ain't no teaser (I ain't no teaser, fool)
I wanna get deep and a little bit of deep and a little bit of deeper (Deeper, ha)
Sweepin' you off your feet, like a rake, talkin' 'bout, "Slick'em, wait" (Wait)
Nah, I ain't stoppin' 'til I feel the backboard break (Yeah)

Wanna press my body against yours, feel the sweat comin' from our pores
