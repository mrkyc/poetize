This ain't no game, we bring the pain
So don't you niggas trip
Fallin the club with all them thugs
And 'bout five extra clips
Deep always deep is how we come cause we ain't no joke
So when you hoes talk all this shit
We gonna cut ya throat
And let you choke right out the door, the Three 6 Mafia game
Now I was pullin a fucking gun
We out so throw them thangs
Don't hit that white
And wanna fight act like you crazy man
We know you niggas just some hoes
We let our nuts hang
You might also like
I wanna crack yo mind
I wanna get you hypnotized cause you this scarecrow
Keep a mystic type of visionary rhyme
You may not capture the essence
Cause we young, my time, my flex
It's a futuristic, anarchistic mega plisto plex
I rack up many shots cause on my run colegri pop
I make sure they get so wild, they bustin caps upon the spot
All around the planet rock, the ghetto blocks don't stop
My nigga gotta take a deep breath
And keep on blowin 'til they drop

I bet you won't
Hit a motherfucker, hit a motherfucker (Bitch)
Hit a motherfucker, hit a motherfucker
I bet you won't
Push a motherfucker, push a motherfucker (Ho)
Push a motherfucker, push a motherfucker
I bet you won't

We ain't going to stop until some damn fools die up in the audience
Word up, push them to the floor
Put yo foot in his guts; example, watch a fool get trampled
Shoot a pistol in the air make it so security can't handle
The crowd, the gotta bum rush before a few gonna get crushed
Crush crush, we got it buck buck (The Three 6)
And when the show's over I wanna see nothing but bodies
On the floor everybody know Three 6 rocks the parties
I heard through the streets that a nigga had said, something about that nigga
I think his name was Crunchy Black
But I walk up to his house, I knocked upon his door
When he came to the door, I hit him in the mouth
And I knocked him on the floor
Then I hit him and hit him some more
Then I told that fucking boy
Shouldn't of ran his mouth about the motherfucking prophet boys
Cause the prophet boys we hypnotizing all of y'all
Gonna tie a rope around yo throat and drag you like you want

I bet you won't
Hit a motherfucker, hit a motherfucker (Bitch)
Hit a motherfucker, hit a motherfucker
I bet you won't
Push a motherfucker, push a motherfucker (Ho)
Push a motherfucker, push a motherfucker
I bet you won't

Hittin you up hittin you down when I start to attack
Never can't be fade
Cause this lady roll with right clique
