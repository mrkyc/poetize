But now my niggas talkin' about robbin', well
J-Jump into the chevy, hit the dashboard, get the mask
But now my niggas talkin' about robbin', well
The Devil control me to a sweet robbery (robbery)

I cruise in my chevy, shakin' these late nights
And soon, the killa within me will come out again to take another life
I'm tired of hidin' from 5-0, 'cause these fools scope me nightly
I'm changin' my identity and playin' more roles than that nigga Spike Lee
This shit ain't fake, I gotta break
And get the fuck back from this murder case
So chill, this shit is cool to rap about
But see, to me it ain't so fun when it's real
Them cops can't roll to Triple Six, so no lord could save 'em
I tried to leave Satan after that, but now I ask him another favor
One of my homies died, two of my niggas in the JC
But now I ask of you, first power, bring 'em back to me
We ran a job off top, we had to pop some cops
Bust in some fools house, made him lead us to his stash p'izz'ot
Ski mask over my skull, papers in my mouth, 'cause I'm grilled
Bitch, it's a house call, Glock 9 with no love
Killas from the south gotta peel caps, and make the shells fall
But I'll be the only one still live large
Influence the beats, it's like a job to me to lay down
You niggas, you bitches, you snitches
Smoke swishers and plan my sweet robberies

This shit is on (Robbery)
I'm scopin' out this fool that I don't like
Who fucked me out some money
(I thought y'all squashed beef shit)
Wait 'til the night
I'm gonna touch him with a gauge, gotta touch him with a gauge
Nigga think he fucked me, gonna get his ass sprayed
First I hit the weed bomb, fifth full of red rum
Nigga better give me some, or I'll make your body numb
Bitch, I thought you knew it was on when you pulled that shit
Flodgin' ass nigga, prepare for the trigger, with no fuckin' heart
You gon' meet your Six killa, don't step
Better watch your back, better watch yourself
Watch out for the niggas you trust, or I'll take your last breath
When I put this tone up in your face
It's gonna be a case without no trace
The robber had a mask on, tryin' to get his blast on
No evidence, this shit will be erased
We're in Paul's chevy deep, with visions in your sleep
The Juice, Project Pat, Lil Glock & S.O.G
Lord Infamous and Crunchy Black got them gats to your back
Another sweet robbery, another mothafucka jacked
Aye, what's up fool? Drop that shit off
Yeah, nigga
Killa that muthafucka, killa that muthafucka, mane!
Give me that money, hoe ass boy
Triple Six, shoot that mothafucka
Ahhhh
It's like that, fool

But now my niggas talkin' about robbin', well
J-Jump into the chevy, hit the dashboard, get the mask
But now my niggas talkin' about robbin', well
The Devil control me to a sweet robbery (robbery)

The terror's in the air, yeah, never did they find your soul, hoe
Straight Buddha smoke
Sweet Robbery, hoe, 'cause a nigga no leavin', me givin' no sorrow
That's why I'll never know the secrets of the many double Quickness, you'll be givin' up the dividends
You get a ton of burn in the end
By the Koopsta Knicca, yo' deadly friendly
I'll take you for a ride, take you to the evil side
Bitch, the Koop would rather see you dead than alive
Misery, but I don't cry, fool, I'm that medical mystery kind
Cops caught the witness on me
And my niggas get bullets up in on them hoes
So you tr'izz'icks can witness the Triple Six
Kick for them souls, like robbery pro's
Kurt rolled the windows, so no slawness could get out of hand
Paul caught two bitches in the den, commitin' like ruff up that ten
Ten corpses that we tortured to the night into they grave
The pain didn't go away
So we buried them bitches on another day
No heaven sent, no evidence, man, you can't fuck with this
For you niggas who won't give up all of yo' shit
Then you gon' be a dead bitch
You hear him, and then a body droppin' in a ditch
They say I'm crazy, though, I really say I'm a lunatic
But now my niggas talkin' about robbin', well
J-Jump into the chevy, hit the dashboard, get the mask
But now my niggas talkin' about robbin', well
