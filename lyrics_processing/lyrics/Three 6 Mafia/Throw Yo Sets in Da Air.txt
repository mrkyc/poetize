If you niggas ain't scared, throw yo sets in da air
Throw yo sets in da air, throw yo sets in da air
If you niggas ain't scared, throw yo sets in da air
Throw yo sets in da air, throw yo sets in da air
Cause we some killa ass niggas and we don't give a fuck
We come to break some fuckin' laws and tear the fuckin' club up
Cause we some killa ass niggas and we don't give a fuck
We come to break some fuckin' laws and tear the fuckin' club up

I think I finally have located the gates of hell
Lie awake at night, to hatch my evil plots, I find myself
Stumblin' through the dark, up against the fuckin' verge of sins
Bodies in my yard, oh my god, them demons came again
People, don't you worry 'cause the Devil's Daughter got a plan
Ho, eternal burning you will have if you don't comprehend
Understand this shit a gansta bitch is sayin' to ya dome
Lock you in the trunk, mob through the night within the mist of fog
Never fear a nigga callin' himself a killa, what's up bitch
Boy you claim you so goddam buck wild with that weak ass shit
Chillin' at the hideout, smokin' out, not worried 'bout a thang
Ballin' through Black Haven, deep as hell in that suburban mane
Always watchin' my back cause niggas will jack you for your fuckin' shit
Female I am, but don't give a damn about splittin' some busta bitch's wig
Three 6 Mafia niggas includin' one female that's bumpin' so hard on you hoes
The only ones talkin' that shit is these jealous ass niggas and all playa hatas you know

Comin' from the darkness of the cut of North Memphis bitch
Killas from the evergreen gardens, we don't set trip
For my niggas doin' time in 201 for the crime
Let's get in the gangsta line and throw the Funkytown sign
I'm on that other level, a coffin and a shovel
Flat ground to put yo ass, before you meet the Devil, the metal
Penalties I pay by punk ass opponents, I practice pain
Juicemane no gang but I slang that thang, I keep it (?)

I'm steady scopin' out these
Nothins, that be actin like a bitch, that be actin like a ho
That be actin like a muthafucka busta that wants no more of the 3-6 Mafia
T-izz-ag wh-izz-ack niggas, come and feel these triggas, ya figure ya bad
Bellin' out Black Haven but I double dem bucks in yo ass, instead
Triple muthafuckin' 6, in the muthafuckin' pl-izz-ay for the n-izz-ine decade
Nigga didn't hear me do, but a muthafuckin' click in somebody's y-izz-ard he laid
Where the niggas in the club? Where the niggas in the streets ain't down with us?
Man, say a few prayers
G-Ds, V-Ls, cr-izz-ips, bl-izz-oods, all hoods throw yo sets in da air
If you niggas ain't scared, throw yo sets in da air
Throw yo sets in da air, throw yo sets in da air
If you niggas ain't scared, throw yo sets in da air
Throw yo sets in da air, throw yo sets in da air
Cause we some killa ass niggas and we don't give a fuck

When the biblical stories were written they left out the one they call Lord Infamous
Because the horror he possessed was one of a magnificence
He was said to be Lucifers only mortal kin
And he was sent to lead the world into unholy acts of sin
The architect of hell and inventor of the six
Interior decorator of chambers of eternal punishment
I'm the one that lit the furnace to the flame that burns forever
Supervisor of the torture, Lord have mercy? Not me, never
I'm clever with corruption of the Seven Seas and continents
Demonic shit, the blunt is lit, abolishment, astonishin'
Watch the world - I crumble it, watch heaven - I rumble it
God kicked Scarecrow out of heaven for he did the Devil bitch
Holdin' angels hostage in the basement of Hell's Chapel
The only nigga to ever set heaven up for a fucking gaffle
The Devil fever flowin' through the fire hemisphere
Evil niggas throw yo sets in da air, if you dare
Throw yo sets in da air, throw yo sets in da air
Throw yo sets in da air, throw yo sets in da air
Throw yo sets in da air, throw yo sets in da air
Throw yo sets in da air, throw yo sets in da air
Throw yo sets in da air, throw yo sets in da air
Throw yo sets in da air, throw yo sets in da air
Throw yo sets in da air, throw yo sets in da air
Throw yo sets in da air, throw yo sets in da air

Ah yeah, Three 6 Mafia runnin' this, ho playa hatin' just don't hear me though
Nigga got a muthafuckin' problem with the clan, step back into this muthafuckin' devil click if you can, nigga
Prophet Entertainment runnin' this shit for the 9-5 to the 9 triple 6
It's like that, yo Fuck you local ass bustas 'cause we got bigger blunts to smoke
