Now that- now that motherfuckers get the feelin' of this shit
This shit so funky cause we underneath the grounds of Triple 6
I'm smokin' out, I'm livin' large, I keep you hataz out my face
Yo life is over motherfucka, when I grab ahold that gauge
My niggas from the Three 6 click, they keep me hooked up on that game
I'm chargin' niggas daily maybe, lady is out to get paid
You hoes can't fuck wit me, I'm flowin', showin', hoes I ain't no hata
Comin' strictly from the South-side gettin' greater later
Everybody wanna gossip, he say, she say this and that
You suckas need to grow up out that kiddy shit, quit fakin' just cause da Three 6 Mafia coming nine-six to two G's bitch
Ms. Lady Gangsta on that weed, kickin' real shit
Just to let you know I barr no hoe, come on the scenery
Scenery, filled with red dots, infrared beams
Now where you gon' go? You can't hide, your life is over kid
It's time for the killin' cause you have fucked up with the wrong ass bitch

Mane this nigga killin' me, tellin' these people that he's about to go nationwide
When he gotta drop his tapes off hisself, plus he gotta call drunk to get a ride
I saw the motherfucka standin' out in front ah Best talkin' about, bout my tape
The nigga talk about the hard shit on that tape, knowin' he sweet as cake
The type ah nigga to tell these hoes that he's about to blow the fuck up
The only blowin' up bitch you doin' is when I stick the grenade in your butt
Since smokin' them mega blunts I can tell, fool, who's a liar
I saw you for real, hit that ill shit you Primo buyer
Juice Mane I know what you sayin', these hoes be killin' me ever so softly
But little do the bitch boy know I be sellin' his verses cassette or tape afterly
Don't forget about the day you were in rage after you got that page
From a doctor from the health department tellin' you you are infected wid AIDS
This homeboy only car was a Maverick that he bought 'fore that, too funny
That he got fucked signin' his contract - you bitch boy you's a fuckin' dummy
Let the nigga think he got big time cars, still put 'em on dem CD's
Dumb nigga you'll never sell more than the Three 6, bitch please

Infamous is comin' strapped like an Italian-Arabic-Iraqi-Iranian-South American-Cuban-Guerilla-Colombian-Muslim, a subgroup maniac
Comin' to rip your damn head off your neck, put your heart in a bag, then I sprinkle yo ash
Headin' straight to tha headquarter, chief on the blunt of the Indica down in my stash
I reside in the insane asylum, the bodies I pile 'em on Infamous Island
Where there is no smilin', the niggas buck-wildin', the weapons are silenced
There's nothing but violence!
Military barbarian, buck 'em and bury 'em
Fuck with the scarier insanitarium, pallbearer carry 'em
There's no merry love, only murder blood
Then I take something worse out of all of these hollow points burst and disperse
Going "boom", blastin' bone through the back of your shirt, you be burnt up and buried in dirt, that'll work
The Scarecrow be smokin' these niggas with shit they can't get with, these bitches they'll never compare
I'm comin' from the land of Triple 6, niggas still sufferin' every day man, I swear
I see them fuckin' pray so low they better lay
It happens everyday, don't make me grab the gauge
Dangerously I play, I blast out your rib cage
And put ya body in the back of the grey Chevrolet
