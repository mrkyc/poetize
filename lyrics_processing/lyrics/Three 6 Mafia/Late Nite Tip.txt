Let me just take you somewhere secret
Gonna cut all of the lights down dim, forget all - about your world
We gonna just flow with what we feel, let's share all
Your private thoughts, I'm not just - out for your sex
Let me simp-lify the things in life that
You find complex, forget what
You heard 'bout me, 'cause you're a
Scarecrow groupie, but there's no
Pressure on you, 'cause you know
What you must do, check this out
Let's have a drink, and I'll give
You time to think, let me puff
This Buddha blunt, and cut on
This porno bump, girl, come lounge
Here by my side, tonight you're
My Devil's bride, and there's a
Freak deep inside, have no shame
No need to hide, why do you
Keep on blushing, get it off
Like a slut, she-she must be
Kind of tipsy on this Chrystal like a gypsy
Now I got - her on all fours, 'bout to break
Down the head-board, crash this broad
On through the wall, now she howlin' like a dog
Sweat poured
We hit the floor, it don't quit
Another one ripped
It's just another victim of Lord Infamous

I done seen - some funny (Shh) since I got in this game
They wants my crib, they wants my kids, since I done gots my fame
I never recall ya askin' your last boyfriend for nathin'
But now the big 'Burban on golds got ya aggravated
I need a coach bag, I can't be even doin' it
I need my hair done, me too, I ain't got nothin' to do with it
I been through with it, you, and it since the first time ya asked
And might I add, playas like me can't be savin' you rats

I ain't with that nonsense or that lovey-dovey mess
Feelin' kinda horny and when I'm callin' all I want is sex
Slip on Victoria Secrets, hit the liquor store before it close
Call Chris so I can get somethin' white to go up in my nose
Now I'm feelin' fine, nothin' but sex is on my mind
If you cannot please me
Boy, then please don't waste all of my time
Got you caught up in the mix, mystic girl from Triple-Six

I can't understand why these broads be trippin'
Can't stand the heat? Get out of the kitchen
Ballin' in my Lex', dropped, legs to the ground
Just a young playa tryin' to put my bid in
Freaks want a trick that be constantly payin'
Not a ghetto thug that be constantly layin'
Rainbow Inn, or the Summer Motel
Oh well, that's where the Juicemane stayin'
Gotta have a lady that wanna do what I do
Like skippin' work, or love cuttin' high school
Servin' other playas in the Three 6 Mafia
Camcorder on, skinny dippin' in the swimmin' pool
Never try to argue, bother you, or fight
Keep a pack of jimmy-hats strapped on real tight
Fifth of Alize, or a tall can of Bud Light
Just for ya freaks, on the moon-light, late night
Tell me, Three 6
Who's that bumpin' that music?
Hypnotizing Koop, I tell you who
I'm 'bout to lose it
Could it be that laid night-groove type
Jazz inside thy body
Always kinda lonely
Someone want me, hold me
I said, come near, come near
Come here the Koopsta cryin' tears
I can't think positive, when no-one cares of how I feel
Realize my mind so tight, that I ain't even try to fight
I cannot lie, though, I can ride high, late night
