I fucks wit' that light green, I fucks wit' that drizz-o, hoe
I puts fire to the tail, I smokes till it is no mo'
I fucks wit' this hotel, I gots towels to the door
I fucks wit' this freaky ho that's down fo' the dicky-blow
I'm blazin' this sticky, but never mixing it with my coke
This one right here for the nose; this one right here for the smoke
This one right here roll them dollars; this one right here roll them blunt
I'm takin' sniffs from the Vicks
I'm wildin' like niggas stunt
This the biz

First, you get the Swishers (Swishers)
Second, buy the liquor (Liquor)
Third, find some of that sticky (Stick)
Most smokers call it sticker (Sticker)
Can't forget the Newports (Newports)

Gimme weed, gimme green, gimme somethin' with no seed
Gimme somethin' I can break down, with no sticks, you understand me?
It don't makes no D if it's crumbled or bud
Just gently give it to me and my hand will gently tug
In your hand, you will see, is a big face from me
Tell my nigga, "Pass me that Swisher, so I can roll up this weed"
Gently fill it up with weed, with the choice of that sweet
Then my nigga looked at me and we started to repeat

Yo, I be smokin' out daily
Maybe get up on some hazy
Get remote and faded, baby
'Cause you niggas drive me crazy
Still a lady when I'm escalated
Made it with my peeps
Bobby Brown-smokin' niggas
Know not to even step to me
When I'm high, I ain't gon' lie
I'm feelin' freaky up inside
You wanna keep it on the low
I put my truck on the other side
Nigga, nigga, what you mean?
Gangsta Boo be on that green
Lookin' good up on the scene
Posted up, know what I mean?
I'm so hi', all I smell like is smoke
Yeah, that motherfucking green; yeah, that goddamn dope
I'm so hi', all I smell like is smoke
Yeah, that motherfucking green; yeah, that goddamn dope

Yeah, that motherfucking green; yeah, that goddamn dope

Gone on the pills I p-pop, yes, I black out a lil' lot
Smoke too much hydro crop, I'm takin' it up a notch
W-H-I-T-E, it does stranger things to me
I'm paralyzed from the P, I'm tootin' up tons of D
Narcotics from coca plants, I sniffed up an avalanche
I'm going into a trance, the deadliest demon man
Scarecrow, Keyser Soze, yo, pass me that saucer tray
Or pass me a blunt of hay, I wanna just drift away, drift away

I be smokin' on motherfuckin weed and chiefin'
Y'all hear me sayin' Satanic prayers over dead bodies
This ganja got me crazy, this haze has got me doomed
Got to blaze a blunt into me, folk, just step into the chiefin' room
From the city with the chicken, chief the chicken, roll the chicken
Smoking got the chicken out there dirty with a lot of sticky
Hear me this sayin': I think I blowed a pound
Now I see me a little silhouetto of a man
Yeah that mothafucking green
Yeah that mothafucking green
Yeah that mothafucking green
