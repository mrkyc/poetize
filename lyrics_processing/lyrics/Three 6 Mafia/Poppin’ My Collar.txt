Now ever since I can remember, I been poppin' my collar
Poppin'-poppin' my collar
Poppin'-poppin' my collar
Now ever since I can remember, I been workin' these hoes
And they better put my money in my hand
Now ever since I can remember, I been poppin' my collar
Poppin'-poppin' my collar
Poppin'-poppin' my collar
Now ever since I can remember, I been workin' these hoes
And they better put my money in my hand

I know you sicker than sick-uh when you see the rims flick-uh
The paint drip-uh, ice in my rings glitt-uh
I straight flip-uh the cheese like pancake-uh
Fallin' from trees like the leaves in my hand rake-uh
Project Pat-uh attractin' dime piece-uh's
I'm dirty southern, french braids, gold teeth-uh's
I'm out here makin' cents, plus I'm out here makin' dollars
I keep a bad broad, dawg, and a popped collar

She just another ho that I met in the hood
I told her I was Crunchy Black and it was all good
She might as well gon' head and suck on my wood
And let me whisper somethin' in her ear if I could

Now when it comes to gettin' bread I got the keys to the bakery
A lot of dudes swear they playin', man they some fakery
Let me catch a girl up out some work and in my sight
And believe I'm gon be at ya in the daylight with a flashlight
I'm tryna get paid however money is made
A lot dudes like to pay ladies to get laid
But me, I ain't no pimp, I just love to borrow
Paper from a fat bitch, a ugly bitch, a model, for real

Well you know me by the Juice man hangin' out with Big Triece
Standin' on the porch, drinkin' liquor, drunk, smokin' weed
Tryna get a paycheck, but work, fur ain't came yet
Thats why I stay in a girl ear, to keep that pussy wet
So I could get paid and relax in the shade
And say fuck a nine to five cuz a nigga tired of slavin
It's never easy for a playa in tha hood on tha come up
If I meet a gal with three kids or more she get done up
Now ever since I can remember, I been poppin' my collar
