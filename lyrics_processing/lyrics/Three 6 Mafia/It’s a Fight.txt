(It's on!) See I'm the king of the ring ring
Ring the bell and I'm comin out swing swing
Swingin lefts, swingin rights 'til they ding ding
He hit the ground, bounced up like a spring spring
Hit him again now like a bird he start to sing sing
Bright lights, camera flashin like bling bling
He started seein things - now I got him
Hands and knees on the floor, crawlin to the corner cry-ing
(Sucka!) I-I-I-I'm the man, there's no de-fea-ting
And the-the-the the ground, you will be ea-ting
I wreck shop, non-stop, this is easy
Put him out the game like his name's Milli Vanilli

Hit you with that one hitta quitter, solid physics
Then we takin corners and we shuttin down your trap spot
Kickin down yo' do', and we stop you like the Juggernaut
Call the police, when you hear that we comin through
Eyes stay red from the liquor and them zu-zus
We'll beat you down, anybody wanna step up
