Please stay sleep, please stay sleep
Please stay sleep, you niggas stay sleep

Sippin' on six murdered ministers' sauce, salty blood from the cup that they call Holy Grail
Silenced for singin' so many sick songs of a place they call heaven, a skitzo from hell
Restin' upon my black throne n just spyin' on suspicious suspects while sittin' on souls
Sinister schemes I decipher the scribes of an ancient tools of past life voodoo and scrolls
Satanic insignia wrote on the scene it's so sacred created by Lucifer slaves
Silent, secluded in secret somewhere in the swamp in the land of old testament days
Infinite SIX, eternal the SIX, forever the SIX, I sits outta the flames
Sick minded soldiers are suffering, seekin' and searching to slay with severe forms of pain
Scarecrow was me, I was sent from the the stem to cause scorn with the thorn on my venomous tips
Such innocent antisocial, my there is no sun daily as the rain wipes from my lips
Indulge yourself with the poisons and noises, money and drugs, material goals
I tell you how it shall profit a man if he gains the whole world and loses his own soul

I click so quick, my spells are slick
I'm comin' again with much more
You niggas be jealous cuz my profit sellin'
Its fucking yo bitch but Nig-ga-roes
Just listen, I shouldn' have to mention
Yo ass is in the clique, you fell in the click
Cuz you run yo mouth around the wrong misses bitch
Yo peep this, my niggas be packin' artillery
Making yo ass whine
I'm packin' this bomb ass car
That's robbin yo ass blind all the time
You think I love you, never nigga I'm out to get my cheese
Like Roger Rabbit, who framed the nigga
That guy left on his knees?
Smokin' out, cuz I need to get high before I go on my mission
My profit soldiers call me all about this thing called pimpin'
So listen nigga before you think you got a convict (bitch)
You got a steaming matter lil' boy that want the lifestyle of rich

Hangin low and standin' high, stayin' high, on the mutha fuckin' street
Should I let a nigga live?
Should I let a nigga die?
I should watch a nigga cry
While I sing dem lullaby

And Raven Red and heavens door

Make sure at night you shut it tight so the killer won't split ya brain
Don't make a move in ya room, you better believe it's a big surprise
Nuttin but them two like a Glock or a set infrared between ya eyes
Tie that bitch up
With the gray tape, rest of the body wrap it up with a belt
Chop, chop, chop
Cut the dead body up til ya know there's nothing left
Please stay sleep!
