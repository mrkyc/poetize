The Indo's creating illusions
The substance infesting my brain cells is causing confusion
I picture Teflon in slow motion
It's piercing through flesh, and continues to cruising
Wait, think straight, don't haste, pace, penetrate
Face, ace, sake, place, base, damn, I think I'm crazed
Terrors the error, no errors within my terror
Are you scared of the 6-double-X-6
Demonically elegant elements?
A manic, depressive aggressiveness, stress me, bitch
And you will feel the strength of my weapons kit
Trickory, hickory, dickory dock
I smoke top notch bud crop, drop
The D, the O, the P, the E
I need the B, the L, the U-N-T
Because that green power flower got much love
I tell you don't fuck with the Triple 6, mane
'Cause you know that we on them drugs
Damn, I'm going off with this blunt, outer space rock
Lord Infamous, I keep clouds of smoke flyin' out my mouth

Who's that bustin' up in my door?
Was way too slow, I hit the floor
They shot up all my niggas in the kitchen flippin' dominoes
Blood all on my leg, I wipe that shit up to my fuckin' head
Caught them trizzicks slippin'
Buck them busta bitches dead
Peace out to my niggas Tim and Killa, they're my roadies
My momma said it be days like this
But my daddy never told me
And that's why I'm a hard lead, twistin' on my dreads
I'm scared, a nigga dead, it's in my fuckin' head
Thinkin' I would hesitate and wait to buck yo' bitch ass down
Read up all my ideas, nig, 'cause I ain't no damn hologram
But I'm clickin' with that quickness
Like the sickness from that Triple 6
Drop you winnin' a splander cut you up like Jeffrey Dahmers bitch
Really I could care less 'bout a nigga tryin' to flex against
The mothafuckin' Tech
You get some *gunshot* up in your neck
And when you see the Koopsta Knicca, it's a fuckin' redrum
Run, run, run 'fore I leave ya damn body numb
Yeah, it's Koopsta Knicca in this mothafucka
I'd like to send this one out to
The mothafuckin' niggas I kick it with over there in
North Memphis, South Memphis
To all my mothafuckin' niggas I kick it with at Northside
The real mothafuckas
