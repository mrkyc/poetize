This shit is beginnin' to come into focus
But no one can figure out Infamous murderous, dark psychosis
Trippin', I'm runnin' the darkness
I'm loadin' berettas, I'm jackin' yo' hoe shit
A posse of satanic mobbers
We comin' to smuggle and leave 'em in puddles of plasma
I'm comin' for stashes, for cash, then blast
Until everyone in here passed out
My fellow man, you cannot comprehend strength of the Devil military killers
Execution to death, you be sentenced
I pop Nina into your head through the pillow
The Tre-6 nigga, comin' to injure you at nightfall
Give it up or this desert eagle shall make death fall up on you all

Ran through the backyard
Jumped the gate to the corner of the back street
Hopped into the steamer, tossed the fuckin' stash behind the seat
I'm comin' to rush 'em son, crush 'em son, buck my gun

I got a problem, money dividends, gotta solve them
The only thing goin' through my head is "murder and rob them"
I heard they got cash, I gotta touch they ass
Quick, fast, in a hurry, get away with a fuckin' dash
Every night I sit and think on why these hoes keep playin' with me
They gonna make me click up, clique up quick
And they don't wanna see my bad side
P, they gonna make me transform to another man
And make they mothafuckin' ass do the Devil dance
Crunchy Black, bitch, comin' at you, hoe
Easy come, easy go, easily we kick in doors
I gotta touch 'em
In my fuckin' head, I vision bloody red
As I chopped off his fuckin' head, left him dead for them bitches
A psycho at large, dumb bitch, don't step to this armored squad
I'm harder, I go and I rip you apart
Like a prey that wants the predator
Gon' need for them paramedics
See wait for the Koopsta scared 'em
Sc-scared a bitch, and left 'em sittin' in hectic
Now wait for that Armageddon, bitch

I gotta touch 'em, I gotta touch 'em
Psycho in the, psycho in the, psycho in the cut
With the mask and the pistol grip
I know he's bailed
I gotta touch 'em, I gotta touch 'em
Psycho in the, psycho in the, psycho in the, psycho in the
Psycho in the cut with the mask and the pistol grip

Psycho in the, psycho in the, psycho in the, psycho in the
Psycho in the cut with the mask and the pistol grip

I hooked up with a few down niggas from the M-Town
Then we started robbin' outta town, makin' 'em lay it down
Touchin' crackers with a 12 gauge to they fuckin' back
Stickin' up liquor stores, robbin' banks, plenty car-jacks
Snatchin' old ladies purse, knockin' niggas to the dirt
My nine gon' make yo' body hurt
I'll put your body in a hearse
Call me a playa hater, traitor, what you want, bitch
Strapped with them thangs on your ass, hear them guns click
Inside job, strictly robbin', so you better beware
Of the nigga with a gat and mask, raise 'em in the air

Now life was up and down for the Killaman as a youngster
Stickin' these tricks up daily, you trippin', I'm still a hustler
Cuttin' class, don't make my snaps behind the barrel shootin' craps
I hit it up in a honeycomb, and smoke a fuckin' pamper house
Hollerin' at my brother Phil D., I gotta get straight
No thang, mane, he got me straight
That thang, fool, be boomin' weight
Hoppin' on my scooter with my ski mask and my Deuce Deuce
All blue joggin' suit, tube socks, and Cool J troops
But now I'm getting older, comin' clean is what I'm hopin'
And now that I got boulder, dope boys are what I'm scopin'
