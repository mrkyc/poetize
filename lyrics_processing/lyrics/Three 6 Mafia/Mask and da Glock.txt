Let's put him in the trunk of the car
And drive him off the pier
Fuck you, man
Come on, papi, man, It ain't that far
Down the block, man
Come on, just like the old days, papi, be calm, be calm
Here comes the pain!

Break out the mask and the Glock, and get rid of you
Pop-pop, 'til you drop, bre-break, bre-break
Break-break-break out the mask and the Glock, and get rid of you
Pop-pop, 'til you drop, body full of bullet holes
Break out the mask and the Glock, and get rid of you
Pop-pop, 'til you drop, bre-break, bre-break
Break-break-break out the mask and the Glock, and get rid of you
Pop-pop, 'til you drop, body full of bullet holes

Hangin' out the window, holdin' tight to my murder weapon
Hit the lights, creep up slow, bullet lead catchin' yo' ass slippin'
Glock poppin', bustas droppin', niggas duckin' from this shit
Mask on my face, no description of who made this hit
Bitches thynkin' "who was it?", bitch, it was Triple Six
Devil thoughts, evil thoughts, tr'izz'ick b'izz'es I just cl'izz'ick
Plenty of blood, no suspects, only victims layin' dead
Shells layin' in their body's, it's the fuckin' bullet lead
Now niggas in the morgue, and I could give a fuck less
Keep my business quiet, it's kept mothers in their black dress
Headed back to my fuckin' hood, project born, ridge grove
Hustler raised, gangsta raised, business up in dirty coast
Now sorry, you're the one got me reachin' for my hip
No friends in the game in the spot, victim of my clip
Fuck all you bustas! step, and you're gonna die
Comin' at yo' ass, victim of a fuckin' drive-by

Straight from the North, bitch, ridge grove is my stompin' ground
You niggas don't make a move, you bitches don't make a sound
Sawed-off gangsta and nigga Glock, back in for the '94
Tellin' all you punk bustas, mane, bring that shit to the door
I'm able, unfadable, no nigga can fuck with this
You talk all that bullshit, to yo' mouth goes my fuckin' fist
I'm jackin' 5000, bitch, so go home and get yo' gat
You better take cover, ho, 'cause this shit is on like that
Squeezin' my fuckin' trigger, blastin' to take yo' life
Your niggas done got all down, so you have to pay the price
Jumped in the fuckin' ride loced up, mane, from head to toe
I pulled out a sack of ink, rolled up as we start to blow
My gat gets tight in my hand, it's too late to break and run
My bullets ejected, bitch, got shot down by teflons
On a spree, killin' see, welcome to the evil side
It's too late to run, bitch, victim of a drive-by
Break out the mask and the Glock, and get rid of you
Pop-pop, 'til you drop, bre-break, bre-break
Break-break-break out the mask and the Glock, and get rid of you
Pop-pop, 'til you drop, body full of bullet holes
Break out the mask and the Glock, and get rid of you
Pop-pop, 'til you drop, bre-break, bre-break
Break-break-break out the mask and the Glock, and get rid of you
