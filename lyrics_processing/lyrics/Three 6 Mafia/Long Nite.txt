I got a plan in command on your ass, bitch
The little short young niggas is with caskets
You bein' front, black nigga rolled up, layed up on your ass, ho
Peter-rolled by Koopsta, Crunchy, Juice, Paul, Boo, and Scarecrow
Ho, it's a whole lotta demons in my world today
Which means you run into a nigga like Koop, a nutcase
And I can tell by the day, it's gonna be a long night
When I take a swipe for yo' life, my big black butcher knife
Now while I'm kickin', niggas fiendin' just to kill 'em, though
Before I go and chief them Swishers with them Navajos
I'm from the mighty Mississippi, now can I fuckin' kick it?
You better answer quick before I hit you for your riches
For them riches

Punk-ass niggas wanna really try to jump up
But they know they gonna catch a couple
Of my sub-machine gun fire to they jaws
I kick shit flyin' through the air
You wanna dare to test me
But I am the Infamous nightmare, I wanna break some laws
I practice secret forms of voodoo culture
Dead flesh sculpture for my pet vultures
Sleepin' in the death defying beyond human measurements
Into my private temple in the middle of Mount Everest
Smoking pine as I sky dive off of mountains
In my mind, blood squirting high out of fountains
Countin' corpses in my black fortress
In the hallway, painting Satanic portraits

See, it was me, Lil' Buck, and my nigga Lil' Knife
And some thug-ass fool I never seen in my life
We roll in Bobby's 'Lac, with the gold bones and vogues
Full grain, cloth top, sturdy pullin' them hoes
The nigga that I didn't know said he had some on the weed
And stoppin' by the crib so he can get up on some cheese
I've smelled shit in the game as soon as he opened his mouth
We dropped him off, the fool went behind the fuckin' house
I didn't think shit about it, but some minutes had to pass
Make me really not trust his busta ass
I looked around and somethin' just made my eye's switch
Twenty more niggas dressed just like a bitch
Not takin' no chances, I'm knowin' this a stick up
But when we tried to bail, we got blocked by a pickup
Droppin' fools, tryin' to test my pimpin' to see what I'm all about
But speakin' too soon, I got blast
And when I stepped up out the  Cadillac
Vision blurry, I see a 9-9
Or was I on my back, seein' a 6-6 up on a street sign?
Lil' Buck slammed right into them durves
Made a U, and scooped me as I crawled straight to the curb
My nigga Lil' Knife let the Tech start rippin' me
From the last hoes who still stood on they feet
Now we gettin' the fuck up out of a hood
That was all wrong, but takin some lifes made it right
It was a long night
It was a long night - when I was locked down in 201
Back Against Da Wall, smokin' a square, cuz, it ain't no fun
Watchin' niggas fight over phone calls, gettin' buck
Knowin' when they get they life sentence, mane, they ass stuck
Niggas always nervous, 'cause they servin' bustas with them swords
For the real killas, GD's, Crips and Vice Lords
Lower level ain't a joke, a nigga got his neck broke
Thrown to the ground like a bitch pickin' up the soap
But I wasn't goin', 'cause a nigga like me kept a shank
If a fool stepped to me, his face'll be in the paint
Waitin' for a guard talkin' smart, it'll be a fight
In 201, locked down, it was a long-ass night

We crawl up the Devil's Basement
I walked down the hallway
Where tha walls are lined with candle lights
Sacrificin' doom when you enter the Triple 6 gun room
Soon I will choose the weapon I find most appropriate
For ruthlessness, I take the Smith & Wesson and a Mac 10
Paul walked in, he grabbed a street sweeper, Grim Reaper and a Glock 19
Crunchy Black he took the goddamn M-16
Buck called up Koopsta
Told him to get the shovel ready for burial of the bodies
Lets put 'em on Unsolved Mysteries
Ease, please creep up in the trees with the night scope
Inhalin' on a blunt of Cambodian red dope
Them niggas died in the blast, we start to gassin'
