How can you have faith in a God
That cannot even control creation
How can he lead you to salvation
There is no hope in chaos - only
Welcome to the other side of reality
And this is your eternity
Eternity

The end of the world, I can see it comin'
So I pack my nine millimeters and I start huntin'
For these niggas that talk shit
Mane, these hoes'll never quit
Until you leave 'em hangin' from a tree or thrown in a ditch
Which one of you niggas think you really got them guts
To walk up to his house, knock on his door
Let 'em feel the buck shots of a twelve gauge
Backed up by an A-K
'Fore you go to bed at night, you bitches better kneel and pray
'Cause when it's business, we takin' care of business
I'm clappin' on any punk witness, or any fool wanna get in it
Mane, this shit is real, not them stories you put in your raps
Not even that bullshit you talk behind a nigga back
Let me make it simple and plain; run up and you'll get your brains
Blown to the side of the curb with that plastic thang-thang
Meanin' Glock nineteen with a twenty clip
You don't wanna fuck with this
You don't wanna fuck with this

Therefore all you cliques, and you clans, and you crews
Fuckin' - fuckin' with this clique, and we gon' bring it to yo' ass!

Man, for a petty crime, I swear I'll die before I do some time
Bitch, the Koopsta massive when I'm
Buckin' with the mothafuckin' plastic nine
Corpses that we tortured in the shed
Their voices won't let me rest
Could this be the end yet
Or a message sent from Satan?
Nigga omens
They open the gates of horror for them overlords
We tortured the cases who arrested the faces of
Triple 6 Devil Shit sorcerers
Kill that bitch, chop that bitch
Or you might just call it a crucifix
Sick of that burnin' inside of my cradle
I'm wishin' that he could just come
Yet, this nina gots no trigger
So I'm clickin' real quick like a serial killa
I'm straight from the South for real-uh
I'll buck you dead, my nigga
And it's a shame when I dropped 'em off the Blacklane
In return I got no thangs, y'all went in dark room
Fool, Koop be jackin' for their thang
Every time I see you slipping, I go and go load my Mac-10 (Mac-10)
Victims of my Devil's playground, come burn with me until the end
Therefore all you cliques, and you clans, and you crews
Fuckin' - fuckin' with this clique, and we gon' bring it to yo' ass!

Totin' the dead body over my shoulder
Into the graveyard with my shovel and pitchfork
Lookin' for a nice spot to dig up, then I toss in the body
And get 'em more muddy as bank o' the shore
Three separate bodies hacked up with a axe
And I think a big sack had been chewed up by rats
I'm just writing these poems they bring to renown
'Cause I drove a steak knife through their skull
Split wrists with needles in my fists
And amidst', thy cliques of tricks
No, I'm not a Christian
But I'm mentally ill
And I don't understand all the reasons why I think it's killin' season
And neither does my schizophrenic friends
So therefore, nigga, due to my mental difficulty
Scarecrow is only entertained by helping enemies bleed
Let all the bodies soak in all the blood
It's the smoke that they chase for no pity
I bloody cut chop up they chest
It's the 20 gauge fire, they dyin' like I was Frank Nitti
I'm havin' no thoughts of the lives I've done lost
When I'm blazin' that stupid gauge fire
'Cause I'm havin' a Halloween slaughter in town
Mothafucka just like Michael Myers
There were mutilations, paralyzations, got no patience
When I'm chasin' down a patient, tryin' to thwart assassination
Therefore all you cliques, and you clans, and you crews
Fuckin' - fuckin' with this clique, and we gon' bring it to yo' ass!
Therefore all you cliques, and you clans, and you crews

I'm on a cross, Lucifer, please cut me free (cut me free)
I'll draw your portrait if you pull these nails out of my feet
(Nails out of my feet)
My cross turns upside down and finally I'm loose
I flip the land and released the others who sin;
The Scarecrow and the Juice
I look to the sky and all I could say was "Finally, it's on again"
No Lord could stop us now, 'cause the demons reborn again
My praise, the first power found me so I could never cower
Without a mind for murder
But the Bible couldn't tell ya half about this antichrist
Look into my eyes, tell me what you see
The demonic man of massacrism, saints, can you feel me?
I traveled years and years, sinkin' this one day of depression
Stormy weather and church bells ringin' to the election
Of a new follower, follow me into the trees
Watch me rob Adam and watch me rape Eve
In this eve of destruction, bustas will probably wonder
With DJ Paul, the Triple Six clique
And Hell take them under
Ahahahaha
Bitch
Now never
