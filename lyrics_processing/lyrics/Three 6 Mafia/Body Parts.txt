Ho, I gotta my Prophet Posse right behind me
Throw a jump and run a man through da crowd man you know gimme sumthin - brrrap, bap
My niggas don't stoppin' with da K-Rock rockin', don't fuck with dis shit
Say if you with me, say if you with me, mon
We buck 'em down, we buck 'em down, only one
Comin' up out that back door
Slangin' my yayo, roll on them po-po's
Jump in that Viper, smokin' that indo
Makin' that bankroll, stupid ass bitches don't you know
Killa Klan Kaze playas gon' make them goddamn profits, ho

Chillin' down on lower level, waitin' for my time to come
With this fool a million styles or maybe I just might make bond
Releasin' me on my own  back on the streets with no employment
Without no cheese up in my pocket, tell me how can I have enjoyment?
Throughout my life, say mo shit, knowin' MC Mack don't love no bitch
Because if I loved them I can't trust em, breakin' these broads gonna make me rich
The Kaze, my Klan is my click, must buck cuz there's no testin' us
Pop 'em and drop 'em, lock 'em and top 'em all up in my trunk

Dynamite I'm tossin', haters crossin', it's the end bitch
You run into bullet proof, ho we still da Triple 6
Prophet to da P, erasin' niggas that wanna splurge
With flows of horror I'm droppin like Steven Spielberg
Deep into da mound ain't nothin' but killas up in da dark
I'm creepin with the hatchet with slicin' bodyparts in da park
Moon full of blood - could it be another Jeffrey Dahmer?
I'm sneakin' and creepin' and blowin' up shit like da Una Bomber
BITCH

Rollin' wit da devil on dat level, dig yo ditch, bitch

Hickory Dickory Dock as I pull out my Glock and I'm ready to pop on the bitch
Sissy muthafucka for bringin' da ruckus, I'm bringing my niggas because we gon' stop this shit
Yeah, da Triple 6 brang it real
Real, a mothafucka gonna pack the steel
Still I fuck a Fly, I pack a real
Real on da mic like Evander Holyfield

There's no Christ in my life, there's no game that I would play
Some people say that if you play a game then mane you get 'em played
Back on you, I thought you knew you should have never dissed this click
The Three 6 Mafia, we poppin' slugs and got you bitches sick

I'll never be barred, me Koopsta stands out from them niggas who thinkin' they hard
Till I flow up to da star, bust in like you da boss
Kaze got my back, wow watch how quickly I react
With that boom-boom-boom nigga, rat-tat-tat-tat-tat
Juicy, Paul and Scarecrow are rollin' in that bucket low
Then they cause some static so they reached and grabbed them 44's
Fuckin' with my nigga Black, he's stackin' plus he pimpin'
Got deals on dat P, hoes gonna feel me
Shut the fuck up bitch, it's Infamous, your ass better not scream
Don't make me have to wipe your muthafuckin brains off my sheets
I'm gonna burn you, watch you burning, nightmare, bad dreams
Give you to da beast in the pit of Hades
Thunder roar, stormy black clouds
I stole the seventh seal then angel cried out
"Scarecrow, I love you, I wanna be with you forever
You too evil though - we gonna give you to the devil!"

Whats up, do you wanna come against me?
Do you wanna get your ass erased off the m-a-p?
Devil Daughter's comin' out, nigga better watch out
Because you got the queen of sins, nigga I'ma turn it out
Comin' to you mean because it's in me to fuck you up
Listen here dude, it's a ride, so just buckle up
Smokin' on a fuckin' blunts till my minds about to blow
Motherfuck the universe because we brought you da end, ho

First I want to grab a nigga by his neck
Drag 'em to my fuckin' set
Take the nigga blow and his cheese
And them cigarettes
Put my gun up to his nose
Tie him up from head to toe
Take the bitch to EverGreen
Throw him in da bayou
Call my niggas D and Blue
Project Pat - y'all know what to do
Creep through the streets with them thangs
Blast on any fool!
Triple 6 killas in this motherfucker, runnin' shit
If you wanna playa hate the click then you done with
Gotta keep my head up, no need for me to stop and get stuck
So ruck wit luck as to rollin' because Gangsta Blac can't get fucked
 creepin' on kin but Martin Luther ain't with me
Ain't nothin' but Prophet and thugs and S-P-V's all up in me
Remy sippin' while trippin' while rippin' corners wit Juice
Women rippin' while dippin' and ain't no stoppin this dude
So if yo bank ain't on swole ain't no stoppin the Prophet
That's who was straight for the eight and look who in it and out it, nigga!

Look in the eyes of a mad man, shoot 'em in the head man
Loco on that coca plant, snort a ball and call da Killa Man
Fill a man with slugs when I'm full of drugs, trust I'm on ya fool
Drug 'em and fuck 'em up face down in the first round fool
Down and what you learned to do but you ain't got the right tools
Clowin' on your new CD now ho tell me what that proved?
I ain't seen shit new, shakin' put your body out of fear
Of the Prophet Posse, let ya live, we'll kill ya next year

Killed him and robbed him and beat him and dumped all his body parts into my trunk
