This for all the playa haters who be talkin' that shit
The Three 6 show no love, we quick to murder a trick
You could be a friend or foe, kinda down or not
I'm rollin' with that fool Crunchy and we got them Glocks
Backed up by the .45 and a .38
You wanna take this clique to war? Fool, it'll be a mistake
Chris, bring the Mossberg with the slugs and shit
We got some graves for ya body already dug and shit
Infamous, grab the Cali with a 100 rounds
Koopsta, load the Tec, and blow them bastards down
Juice with the two 9's like the nigga name Shae
On the move, we shoot 'em up so slow they feel the pain
I thought you knew that I'm from Memphis where the shit is so thick
When at the club, we get so buck, we try to tear up some shit
Gangsta Boo, the gangsta bitch with the .357
Our main goal in life is a opposite heaven
Triple 6, bitch!

Deadly
We should begin to come closer to killa dimensions
Niggas getting lynchin's from the Triple 6 anti-christians
May I mention, the sl'izz'ugs that I blaze, Scarecrow's unmerciful
Bullets are bombin' the  enemy, nigga, see death is unreversable
Hardness is your fantasy, death is not fictional, you bitches
Fuck around and find yo' wannabe gangsta ass with the mortician
Executioner style, buck in yo' head, while ya beg on yo' knees, uh
Plenty of bustas been put in the morgue and they chilly down in the cold freezers
Teflon penetratin' and the penalty is deadly punishment
Then me and my Triple 6, we go and blow an ounce of blue hair trick
I could give a fuck less, bitch, I'm glad that you dead and gone
Three 6 Mafia, sign our names on niggas fuckin' tombstones
Memphis is the fuckin' city where Lord Infamous loves to bail
And just like I said before, bitch, come with me to Hell
Everybody in this house, you niggas know what's up
Lemme see, can all you mothafuckas tear this club up
Tear da club up, nigga, tear da club up
Tear da club up, nigga, tear da club up

All these playa hatas in the club got us fucked up
Yes, I'm the nigga with them two 9's ready to blast
When I pull 'em out, you mothafuckas better haul ass
Paul thowin' chairs in the air, Koopsta loccin' up
Fly take the cash from yo' ass - Mr. Stick 'Em Up
Fuck da damn security, fuck a mothafuckin' cop
If they kick me out the club, I'll buck 'em in the parkin' lot
Grab the club owner, put the rich bitch in the trunk
Take 'em out and take his money, then I spit on the punk
Now I'm crunk, breakin' bottles up against the fuckin' wall
Shootin' tones at them fools, 'til them jealous bustas fall
For these niggas testin' pimpin': we gon' bury all you hoes
Slicin' bitches right in half, stompin' 'em straight through the floor
Niggas talkin' plenty shit, but they ain't buck enough
We gon' get some dynamite and blow this mothafucka up
Tear da club up, nigga, tear da club up
