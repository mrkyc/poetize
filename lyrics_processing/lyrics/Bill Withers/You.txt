You want to take me to a doctor
To talk to me about my mind
To try to give directions to some places
That I don't really want to find
Trouble in me is not related
To things that I might say or do
I'm really not that complicated
Your good doctor friend, he oughta talk to you
I notice that he can't remember
Things that he never should forget
And why does he spend his evenings smoking
Them funny-smelling cigarettes?
I have a friend that knows your best friend
He goes some places where she goes
He said he saw y'all at a party
Sniffing white powder up your nose
You got the nerve to call me narrow-minded
'Cause I'm not loose and indiscreet
People lying down always get blinded
By people standing on their own two feet
Life is just a shadow
That I just can't seem to find sometimes
Oh Lordy, sometimes
But I guess I'll make it
'Cause I found out that it's really in my mind
Really all in my mind
You shouldn't take it too seriously
'Cause it really ain't gon' last too long
Really ain't gon' last too long
You really only got two choices
You can lay down and be weak
Or you can stand up where you're at and still be strong
Stand up and still be strong
Hey, tomorrow depends too much on today
And yesterday - all that gentleman is to you is gone
All he is is gone
All you find out looking back
Is the fact that both of us was wrong
Both of us was wrong
Hey, now you're talking right to me
But you really ain't saying a thang
You're pouring muddy water on me
Trying to convince me it's rain
Now you're talking to me crazy
But you're trying to make me feel insane
Oh Lordy, feel insane
You're like a Sunday family
Digging animals in a zoo
But while you're looking at monkeys
Monkey's looking dead at you
Two people getting done
Trying to figure out who's doing who
If you're throwing dirt at people
You got to get some dirt on you
I got to take a ton of lies
Just to get an ounce of truth from you
You're like a man loving Jesus
That says he can't stand a Jew
Well, I get on down and play the dozens
Talk about your folks
From your mama to your cousins
You head down there
Now you know what I'm talking 'bout
You might also like
Get on down and play the dozens
Talk about your folks
From your mama to your cousins
You head down there
