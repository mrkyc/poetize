I love the story in your love song
Building them castles in your mind
You come down here looking for a feeling
Someday I know you're gonna find
I wanna lay down now beside you
But first we ought to take some time

Before I make love to your body
I wanna make love to your mind

I wanna feel good just like you do (Feel good)
I haven't loved in quite some time (Feel good)
I have some phases that I've been through
Where I've just loved and left behind
I'm just too tired of feeling guilty
I don't wanna be unkind

But before I make love to your body
I wanna make love to your mind
I wanna make love to your mind
I wanna make love to your mind
Before I make love to your body
I wanna make love to your mind
You might also like
I wanna feel good just like you do (Feel good)
I haven't loved in quite some time (Feel good)
Know I had some funny phases that I've been through
Where I've just loved and left behind
I'm just too tired of feeling guilty
I don't really wanna be unkind

But before I make love to your body
I wanna make love to your mind (To your mind)

To your mind
To your mind
To your mind
To your mind

I love the story in your love song, little girl
Building them castles in your mind, mmm
You come down here from somewhere looking for a feeling
Someday I know you're gonna find
See, I wanna lay down now beside you, oh oh (Lay down)
But first we ought to take some time (Time)
But before I make love to your body
I wanna make love to your mind

(To your mind)
I wanna make love to your mind (To your mind)
I wanna make love to your mind (To your mind)
I wanna make love to your mind
To your mind, ooh yeah
To your mind
