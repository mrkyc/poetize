I get a warm, warm summer feeling
Walking through the snow
Even chilly darkness has the brightest glow

And I just love you so, mmm
Sometimes I just don't know, know, know
I just don't know
I just don't know
I just don't know

I say that time just seems
To help this wondrous feeling grow
Maybe I might wake up early one morning
And find it isn't so

But I just love you so, mmm
Sometimes I just don't know
I just don't know
I just don't know
I just don't know

You got me feeling just like a rich man
Haven't got a dime
Feeling like a young man
But I'm old as father time
You might also like
And I just love you so, mmm
Sometimes I just don't know
I just don't know
I just don't know
I just don't know
I just don't know
I just don't know
I just don't know
