City of the angels, spread your wings for me
I've been other places looking for my dream
Eastern cities move too fast
Southern ones too slow
I can't go back to my past
And I need someplace to grow
City of the Angels
Clear your cloudy skies for me
I heard you got some places that I oughta see
Heard you got a Disneyland not too far away
When it rains I understand the skies are clear all day

L.A., L.A., find a place for me
In your spacious wings is where I wanna be

City of the angels, spread your wings for me
I've been other places looking around for my dream
Eastern cities move too fast
And Southern ones too slow
I can't go back to my past
And I need someplace to grow
You might also like
L.A., L.A., find a place for me
In your spacious wings is where I wanna be


City of the Angels, spread your wings for me
I heard you got some places an old man like me should see
Heard about your Disneyland not too far away from town
When it rains I understand the skies are clear all day

L.A., oh, L.A., find a place for me
In your spacious wings is where I want to be

City of the Angels, spread your wings for me
I've been other places looking for my dreams
Eastern cities move too fast
Southern ones too slow
And I can't go back to my past
And I need someplace to grow
City of the Angels, clear your skies for me
I heard you got some places that I oughta see
I heard you got a Disneyland not too far away
And when it rains I understand the skies are clear all day
L.A., L.A., find a place for me
