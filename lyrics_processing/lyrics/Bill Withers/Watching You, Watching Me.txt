Watching you watching me
It's so easy to see
That it's my loving you
That puts the starlight in your eyes
Watching me watching you
It's so obviously true
That it's your loving me
That makes my life a paradise

When lovers meet
And light a spark
Their eyes give the game away
Somehow it's a feeling you can never hide
No matter how hard you try
When lovers speak
It's from the heart
And all of the things they say
Are part of the magic and the mystery
You hear in a gentle sigh

Watching you watching me
Girl, ain't it easy to see
That it's my loving you
That puts the starlight in your eyes
Watching me watching you
Girl, I believe that it's true
That it's your loving me
That makes my life a paradise
You might also like
The times we had
The fun and games
The things that I can't forget
We share in those very special memories
All lovers can smile about
I'm so glad you feel the same
There's nothing to regret
It's great what a simple love affair can do
To bring all the feelings out

Watching you watching me
Girl, ain't it easy to see
That it's my loving you
That puts the starlight in your eyes
Watching me watching you
Girl, I believe that it's true
That it's your loving me
That makes my life a paradise

There's a languages spoken only by lovers
Words and phrases that they make with their eyes
You might try it but you never can change things
Love will compromise, don't make do it
Let's celebrate what life's about
Let's sing out the melody
The words and the music to our song of love
Are sweeter than anything
'Cause if we wait we might lose out
On things that were meant to be
With all of the secrets that the heart can hold
Left dangling on a string

Oh, watching you watching me
Girl, ain't it easy to see
That it's my loving you
That puts the starlight in your eyes
Oh, watching me watching you
I believe you know that it's true
Oh, sweet girl, I love you
You make my life a paradise

Watching you watching me
It's so easy to see
That it's my loving you
That puts the starlight in your eyes
Watching me watching you (Watching me watching you)
It's so obviously true (I believe)
That's it's your loving me (I love you)
That makes my life a paradise
Watching you watching me
It's so easy to see
That it's my loving you (I love you)
That puts the starlight in your eyes
Watching me watching you
It's so obviously true
That's it's your loving me
