Broken

Why you always gotta be so stubborn?
Stopping in the headlights like you're choking
Want to be right, but you got problems
Yeah, we all got problems
I'm not here to solve them
Tell me why you gotta be so stubborn
Using up my time with all that moping
Thought I gave a fuck, gotta be joking
Looking for some wings, you better keep hoping

It's like you're puppets on a string
One jerk to send you dancing
While I'm standing over here saying

I won't dance 'cause you tell me to
Never find me jumping through hoops
See the cracks fixed with superglue
It's alright 'cause I'm not broken
I won't dance 'cause you tell me to
Never find me jumping through hoops
See the cracks fixed with superglue
It's alright 'cause I'm not broken

Why you always looking for a way out?
Scared of every mirror in your glass house
Looking for the light like you were promised
I'm not here to solve this
I'm just being honest
Why you always looking for a way out?
You can eat your words out in the playground
I'll be out of sight, nothing to say now
Look where you are
Uh-huh, I bet you're real proud

It's like you're puppets on a string
One jerk to send you dancing
While I'm standing over here saying

I won't dance 'cause you tell me to
Never find me jumping through hoops
See the cracks fixed with superglue
It's alright 'cause I'm not broken
I won't dance 'cause you tell me to
Never find me jumping through hoops
See the cracks fixed with superglue
It's alright 'cause I'm not broken
It's like you're puppets on a string
One jerk to send you dancing
While I'm over here saying (Broken)
