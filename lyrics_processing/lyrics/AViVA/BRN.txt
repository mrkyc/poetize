I cannot understand the lies you're spreadin'
'Cause to my face, you say "Baby, I'm hurting"
You say I'm your weakness but you is just greedy
You want to be free but you wanna complete me
I shoulda listened to my intuition
Right from the start, it seemed like you were trippin'
Your eyes are empty like you found my heart
Now we are here again, back again at the start

I will not apologise
I will not walk away
I will not compromise
You'll find I'm here to stay

'Cause I'm a fighter, a tiger, see me walk through fire
Try chain me up but I'll burst through, I'll defy ya
Set me on fire, watch them conspire
I will defy ya, I'll set them on fire
'Cause I'm a fighter, a tiger, see me walk through fire
Try chain me up but I'll burst through, I'll defy ya
Set me on fire, watch you conspire
I will defy ya, I'll set you on fire

It seems I'm losing myself like a victim
But I'll never let myself lose position
I want to work you deep into my system
Somehow, I know it will not come to fruition
Now here's my secret and don't you forget it
My heart is empty, the way that I kept it
There's no point in telling me that they won't listen
I know that they want to keep me in their prison

I will not apologise
I will not walk away
I will not compromise
You'll find I'm here to stay

'Cause I'm a fighter, a tiger, see me walk through fire
Try chain me up but I'll burst through, I'll defy ya
Set me on fire, watch them conspire
I will defy ya, I'll set them on fire
'Cause I'm a fighter, a tiger, see me walk through fire
Try chain me up but I'll burst through, I'll defy ya
Set me on fire, watch you conspire
I will defy ya, I'll set you on fire
Da da da da da-da da da
Burn, burn, burn, burn in the fire
Da da da da da-da da da
Burn, burn, burn, burn in the fire

'Cause I'm a fighter, a tiger, see me walk through fire
Try chain me up but I'll burst through, I'll defy ya
I will not apologise, I will not walk away
'Cause I'm a fighter, a tiger, see me walk through fire
Try chain me up but I'll burst through, I'll defy ya
I will not compromise, you'll find I'm here to stay

Da da da da da-da da da
Burn, burn, burn, burn in the fire
Da da da da da-da da da
Burn, burn, burn, burn in the fire
Set me on fire, watch you conspire
I will defy ya, I'll set you on fire
Set me on fire, watch you conspire
