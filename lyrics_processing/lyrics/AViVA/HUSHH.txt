Hush now, darling, don't say a word
Demons calling, they'll eat your soul
I'm not sorry for what will come
What you don't know

Hold your breath, dim the lights
I won't say you're safe this time
Here and now, you're mine tonight

Hush, hush
Keep your pretty mouth shut
Hush, hush
Lose your inhibition
I'll let you in on my dark side
Show you what Hell really feels like
I can keep a secret if you hush, hush

La, la, la, la, la, la, la
No one has to know
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
No one has to know
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
No one has to know
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
No one has to know

Hush now, darling, I won't let go
Just keep moving, moving through the smoke
Hold me closer, we step across
Now you know

Hold your breath, dim the lights
I won't say you're safe this time
Here and now, you're mine tonight

Hush, hush
Keep your pretty mouth shut
Hush, hush
Lose your inhibition
I'll let you in on my dark side
Show you what Hell really feels like
I can keep a secret if you hush, hush

La, la, la, la, la, la, la
No one has to know
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
No one has to know
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
No one has to know
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
No one has to know
Hush, little darling, don't say a word
Mama's gonna buy you a mockingbird
And if that mockingbird don't sing
Mama's gonna buy you a diamond ring

Hush, hush
Keep your pretty mouth shut
Hush, hush
Lose your inhibition
I'll let you in on my dark side
Show you what Hell really feels like
I can keep a secret if you hush, hush

Please come on inside
You're begging to know
Bring me to life
Just give me your hush, hush
Please come on inside
You're begging to know
Bring me to life
