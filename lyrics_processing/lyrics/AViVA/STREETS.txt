Lying awake, awake in my bed
Blood on my hands, blood in my bed
You've left me undone, left my head
Thinking of things, things that you said
Last night I was there, wringing my hands
You were holding your head
Making like lighting, I cannot stop fighting
I think you're behind me, my mind keeps rewinding
I want to forget it, don't want to regret letting you back
Again and again
Like the ghost on my shoulder, I'll keep getting older
But I can't forget the damage you controlled
Yeah, I'll freak if you win her, I'd eat her for dinner
I'd worry if you were not scared

Oh, oh, woah, woah, woah

Don't ever walk alone, boy, alone, boy, alone, boy
Now you are on your own, boy, your own, boy, your own, boy
I know where you will be hiding, there's nowhere to go
Yeah, I know where you will be hiding
Don't ever walk alone, boy, alone, boy, alone, boy
-Lone, boy, -lone, boy
You might also like
Trying to fake, fake that I cared
You made your choice, missing the point
Ending up broken and scared
You think that I'll break, that I'm underprepared
End of the line, you're out of time
Thought you would know I don't share
You think you're the winner, don't care I'm a sinner
Remember I told you I'd eat you for dinner
So don't be a liar, I know how to find you
Said "I am not here to be friends"
There's nothing you show me that I see as holy
Those spirits can't blind me, I dare them to find me
You know I'm not shying from what I've decided
I've said it, won't say it again

Oh, oh, woah, woah, woah

Don't ever walk alone, boy, alone, boy, alone, boy
Now you are on your own, boy, your own, boy, your own, boy
I know where you will be hiding, there's nowhere to go
Yeah, I know where you will be hiding
Don't ever walk alone, boy, alone, boy, alone, boy
-Lone, boy, -lone, boy
Oh, oh, woah, woah, woah
Oh, oh, woah, woah, woah
Don't ever walk alone, boy, alone, boy, alone, boy
Now you are on your own, boy, your own, boy, your own, boy

Don't ever walk alone, boy, alone, boy, alone, boy
Now you are on your own, boy, your own, boy, your own, boy
I know where you will be hiding, there's nowhere to go
Yeah, I know where you will be hiding
Don't ever walk alone, boy, alone, boy, alone, boy
-Lone, boy, -lone, boy
