Here we go, at the start
We're not friends, never were
What you want, I will not give you
Listen to me, stay in your lane
All of your talking drive me insane
Nails on a chalkboard, nails down your face
You make me want to

Voices in my head telling me not to confess
But I'm running out of time
And they think they know what's best
Voices in my head telling me not to confess
'Cause everybody knows that it's a

Wicked world for this wicked girl
Watch me dance around possessed
With your noose around my neck
It's a wicked world for this wicked girl
Watch me dance around possessed
With your noose around my neck, neck

Na, na, na-na-na-na-na
Na, na, na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na
Na, na, na, na-na-na-na-na
Na, na, na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na
