Home in bed or out at night
Don't think twice, just don't think twice
Make a choice, one you won't regret
This is your life, this is still your life
Never gon' get away, never gon' get away
Never gon' break the chains
Watching me patiently, watching me patiently
Watching me take the blame
Never gon' get away, never gon' get away
Never gon' break the chains
I'm running out of options and they know

Whoa, oh
I'm tired of holding on
Whoa, oh
Hear me when I say

Don't blame it on the kids
Don't blame it on the kids, kids
Don't blame it on the kids
Don't blame it on the kids, kids

Say their names, we won't forget
This is not your fight, not your fight
You played games but we can forgive
Put down the knife, put down the knife
Never gon' get away, never gon' get away
Never gon' break the chains
Watching me patiently, watching me patiently
Watching me take the blame
Never gon' get away, never gon' get away
Never gon' break the chains
I'm running out of options and they know
You might also like
Whoa, oh
I'm tired of holding on
Whoa, oh
Hear me when I say

Don't blame it on the kids
Don't blame it on the kids, kids
Don't blame it on the kids
Don't blame it on the kids, kids
Don't blame it on the kids
Don't blame it on the kids, kids
Don't blame it on the kids
Don't blame it on the kids, kids
Come out, where your pretty faces hiding?
Come out, I don't see no point in lying
No doubt, you have questions I can answer
But first, come out with your hands up
Come out, where your pretty faces hiding?
Come out, I don't see no point in lying
No doubt, you have questions I can answer
But first, come out with your hands up
Don't blame it on the kids
Don't blame it on the kids, kids
Don't blame it on the kids
Don't blame it on the kids, kids
Don't blame it on the kids
Don't blame it on the kids, kids
Don't blame it on the kids
