Fake faces hiding everywhere
Made up, make-up, made up stares
To hide their stolen air
Don't look too close, don't you dare
Stupid seems to be in the air, in my air, everywhere
Blameless, I'll shatter through the glare
Make it, take it, they won't share

I can't fake it, I'll just make it on my own (On my own)
I can't blame them, I'll just maim them on my throne (On my throne)
I can't fake it, I'll just make it on my own (On my own)
I can't blame them, I've just got to get to my throne (On my throne)

I am the latest colors, I sing the newest songs
I read all the lyrics so I can sing along
I am the latest colors, I stand above my throne
Waiting for an invite to never come along
I am the latest colors, I sing the newest songs
I read all the lyrics so I can sing along
I am the latest colors, I hate the newest songs
I can't stand the lyrics, I'd never sing along

I'll never sing along
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
I'll never sing along
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
I'll never sing along

Trade places, staggered truth or dare
Only ask it if you care
Trace back to all the millionaires
Snake oil traders, no one shares
Soulless and stealing what they dare
Hold your deck to your chest
Faceless, nobody is your friend
Make it, take it, they won't share

I can't fake it, I'll just make it on my own (On my own)
I can't blame them, I'll just maim them on my throne (On my throne)
I can't fake it, I'll just make it on my own (On my own)
I can't blame them, I've just got to get to my throne (On my throne)
I am the latest colors, I sing the newest songs
I read all the lyrics so I can sing along
I am the latest colors, I hate the newest songs
I can't stand the lyrics, I'd never sing along

I'll never sing along
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
I'll never sing along
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
I'll never sing along
I'll never sing along, I'll never sing along
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la, on my own
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la, on my throne
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la, on my own
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la, get to my throne

I am the latest colors, I sing the newest songs
I read all the lyrics so I can sing along
I am the latest colors, I stand above my throne
Waiting for an invite to never come along
I am the latest colors, I sing the newest songs
I read all the lyrics so I can sing along
I am the latest colors, I hate the newest songs
I can't stand the lyrics, I'd never sing along

I'll never sing along
I can't fake it, I'll just make it on my own
I'll never sing along
I can't blame them, I'll just maim them on my throne
I'll never sing along
I can't fake it, I'll just make it on my own
I'll never sing along
