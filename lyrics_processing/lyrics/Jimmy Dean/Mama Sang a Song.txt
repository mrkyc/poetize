I get to thinkin' lotta times about when I was a lad
Of the old homeplace where I grew up of the days both good and bad
My overalls were hand-me-downs shoes full of holes
I used to walk four miles to school every day through the rain the sleet and the cold
I've seen the nights when my daddy would cry
For the things that his family would need
But all he ever got was a badland farm and seven hungry mouths to feed
And yet and somehow our homefire never flickered once
Cause when all the things went wrong
Mama took the hymn book down and mama sang a song
(What a friend we have in Jesus)
I've been rocked to sleep many a night to the tune of What a Friend
Morning come Rock of Ages it gently wake me once again
Then daddy'd reach up and take the Bible down and he'd read it
Read it loud and strong
And I always felt that maybe our home was blessed
When daddy'd say mama sing a song
Sister left home first I guess then Bob and Tommy and Dan
By then dad's hair was turning grey and I had to be mama's little man
But it seemed that when dad grew weak mom's faith grew strong
And I think those were the greatest days of all when mama sang a song
(Rock of ages cleft for me let me hide myself in Thee)
I guess the old house is still standin' I don't go back much anymore
No voice is left to fill those halls no steps to grace the floor
For you see mama sings in heaven now round God's golden throne
But I'll always believe that this old world is a whole lot better place
