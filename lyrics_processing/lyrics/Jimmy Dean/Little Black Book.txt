Said she didn't wanna see me no more
Told me not to call her on the telephone
And never come a-knockin' on her door
Well, I fumed and I fussed, and I might have cried a little
My head went a-spinnin' around
But with a little bit of luck, and my little black book
I'll have another'n before the sun goes down
What my baby didn't know was the same thing happened
Not once, but a half a dozen times
And she didn't realize that with a telephone call
I'd have another fickle chicken on the line
But every time I leave I do my best to play the part
Of the lovesick, heartbroke clown
But with a little bit of luck, and my little black book
I'll have another'n before the sun goes down
Now I haven't got a thing against a pretty little woman
Like her walk and her talk and her smile
I've been likin' pretty girls since I found they wasn't boys
And let me tell ya buddy, that's been quite a while
I like the huggin' and the squeezin' and the kissin' and the teasin'
But don't you let 'em push me around
'Cause with a little bit of luck, and my little black book
I'll have another'n before the sun goes down

How she made a big fool out of me
But while I'm out tonight a-rompin' and a-stompin'
She'll be watchin' Dr. Casey on TV
So girls, let me tell ya, better do a little thinkin'
'Fore you tell your lovin' man to leave town
'Cause with a little bit of luck, and a little black book
He'll get another'n before the sun goes down
'Cause with a little bit of luck, and a little black book
