A kind of a guy that wouldn't even harm a flea
But if me and a certain character met - The guy that invented the cigarette
I'd murder that son of a gun in the first degree
2. It ain't that I don't smoke myself - And I don't reckon they'll hinder your health
I've smoked them all my life and I ain't dead yet
But nicotine slaves are all the same - At a pettin' party or a poker game
Everythin's gotta stop while you have that cigarette
Smoke smoke smoke that cigarette puff puff puff and if you smoke yourself to death
Tell St Peter at the Golden Gate that you hate to make him wait
But you just gotta have another cigarette
3. Now at a game of chance the other night - Ol' Dame Fortune was a doin' me right
The kings and queens just kept on comin' round
And I got a full and I bettet high - But my bluff didn't work on a certain guy
He just kept a risin' and layin' his money down
4. He'd raise me and I'd raise him - And I sweated blood you gotta sink or swim
He finally called and he couldn't raise the bet
I said "aces full pal how about you" - He said "I'll tell you in a minute or two
But right now I just gotta have another cigarette"
Smoke smoke smoke...

One of them highbred up-town fancy little dames
She said she loved me and it seemed to me - That things were just about like they oughta be
So hand in hand we strolled down Lover's Lane
6. She was oh so far from a chunk of ice - And our smoochin' party was a goin' real nice
So help me Hannah and I think I'd of been there yet
I give her a kiss and a little squeeze - And she said "would you excuse me please
But I just gotta have another cigarette"
Smoke smoke smoke... X 2
