I was born one mornin'
Rain was pourin' down
I heard my mammy say to my pappy
"Let's call him John Henry Brown"
Walk on, boy
(Walk, walk, walk)
Walk on down the road
Ain't nobody in the whole wide world
Gonna help you carry your load
Walk on, boy
(Walk, walk, walk)
Well, I left home one evenin'
Just about the age of ten
Got me a job way down on the levee
Totin' water to the hardworkin' men
Walk on, boy
(Walk, walk, walk)
Walk on down the road
Ain't nobody in the whole wide world
Gonna help you carry your load
Walk on, boy
(Walk, walk, walk)

The poor man does all the work
While the rich man's livin' mighty high on a horse
Well, the poor boys are livin' on dirt
Walk on, boy
(Walk, walk, walk)
Walk on down the road
Ain't nobody in the whole wide world
Gonna help you carry your load
Walk on, boy
(Walk, walk, walk, walk, walk, walk)
My old pappy told me just one thing to do
You gotta find a good woman, be good to her
And she gonna be good to you
Walk on, boy
(Walk, walk, walk)
Walk on down the road
Ain't nobody in the whole wide world
Gonna help you carry your load
Walk on, boy
(Walk, walk, walk)
I know y'all heard the story
'Bout the hammer that weighed nine pound
Well, the man that swung that hammer on the mountain
Was a fella named John Henry Brown
Walk on, boy
(Walk, walk, walk)
Walk on down the road
Ain't nobody in the whole wide world
Gonna help you carry your load
Walk on, boy
(Walk, walk, walk)
Just keep on walkin'
(Walk, walk, walk, walk, walk, walk)
Feet draggin', back achin'
(Walk, walk, walk)
