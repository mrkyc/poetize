Oh, it's springtime in the mountains
And I'm full of mountain dew
Can't even read my catalog
Like I used to do
I'm a-settin' in that little shed
That's right back of the house
Here comes old Jake with all the hounds
But he's gonna hear me shout

Oh, I won't go huntin' with you, Jake
But I'll go chasin' women
So put them hounds back in the pens
And quit your silly grinnin'
Well, the moon is bright, and I'm half tight
My life is just beginnin'
I won't go huntin' with you, Jake
But I'll go chasin' women

Let's go down to the meetin' house
And wait 'til they start home
Them gals that live on Possum Creek
We'll always leave alone
We'll run them down the corn rows
Them sassy little misses
We'll scare them pretty gals to death
We'll stop and throw 'em kisses
You might also like
Well, I won't go huntin' with you, Jake
But I'll go chasin' women
So put them hounds back in the pens
And quit your silly grinnin'
Well, the moon is bright, and I'm half tight
My life is just beginnin'
I won't go huntin' with you, Jake
But I'll go chasin' women

Now, go wash your face and comb your hair
'Cause it's durn near time to start
But let me tell you 'fore you go
There's one that's got my heart
Don't chase that gal with the yellow hair
And wears a dress of green
For that little gal belongs to me
I know she's past sixteen

Oh, I won't go huntin' with you, Jake
But I'll go chasin' women
So put them hounds back in the pens
And quit your silly grinnin'
Well, the moon is bright, and I'm half tight
My life is just beginnin'
I won't go huntin' with you, Jake
But I'll go chasin' women
Now, I was headed for the general store
When a silly thing I seen
They make 'em in the city
It's called a magazine
I turned to page thirty-two
And look at what I found
Them gals wear clothes that we ain't seen
Beneath them gingham gowns

Oh, I won't go huntin' with you, Jake
But I'll go chasin' women
So put them hounds back in the pens
And quit your silly grinnin'
Well, the moon is bright, and I'm half tight
My life is just beginnin'
I won't go huntin' with you, Jake
