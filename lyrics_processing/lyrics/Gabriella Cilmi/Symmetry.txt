Oh, tell me something that I don't know
Is there a truth you try to hide
You can't let follow you home?
Do you hold on tightly
Or just let it go?
Would you sell a moments breath
To pay for what you owe?

My conscience is broken
This black hole is open
It's pulling me past the point of no return
Tell me I'm not the only one
Feeling this lonely now
Lord I need to know...

Does your heart bleed like mine?
With each beat pumping at a time
Yeah, somethings burning deep down inside
Can't fight the fire, we can't undo
The symmetry of me and you

When you look me in the eyes
Do you see a stranger smile
Or a face that you recognize?
And does your body feel out of place?
And all these thoughts you can't control
And you know that you can't explain
You might also like
My conscience is broken
This black hole is open
It's pulling me past the point of no return
Tell me I'm not the only one
Feeling this lonely now
Lord I need to know...

Does your heart bleed like mine?
With each beat pumping at a time
Yeah, somethings burning deep down inside
Can't fight the fire, we can't undo
The symmetry of me and you

Only you and me, never can we break free
You now where I'll be... close to you
Only you and me, never can we break free
You now where I'll be... close to you
Close to you

Lord I need to know...

Does your heart bleed like mine?
With each beat pumping at a time
Yeah, somethings burning deep down inside
Can't fight the fire, we can't undo
The symmetry of me and you
Only you and me, never can we break free
You now where I'll be... close to you
Only you and me, never can we break free
You now where I'll be... close to you
