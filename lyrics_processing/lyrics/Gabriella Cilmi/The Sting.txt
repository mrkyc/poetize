All of my life
I've been running from the sting
Stole the honey from the hive
And the bee's still following me

Lend some sugar to your neighbor
Do a girl a favor
I might return it later
I'm salt
It's really not my fault
My heart's on my t-shirt
Maybe you could keep it

If the devil were a woman
I wouldn't have to run away
If the devil were a woman
Maybe she'd understand me

All of my life
I've been running from the sting
Stole the honey from the hive
And the bee's still following me
All of my life
I've been running from the sting
Stole the honey from the hive
And the bee's still following me

One, open your heart fly
Two, never retreat see
Three, go miss a long time
Four, I will be dreaming

I, I just wanted something sweet
And nothing in my kitchen
So I had to look for something
So I took the road less traveled in
A world so appetizing
I had to lick the icing

If the devil were a woman
I wouldn't have to run away
If the devil were a woman
Maybe she'd understand me

All of my life
I've been running from the sting
Stole the honey from the hive
And the bee's still following me
All of my life
I've been running from the sting
Stole the honey from the hive
And the bee's still following me
Why do good things happen to bad bad people?
Why do bad things happen to good good people?
Why do good things happen to bad bad people?
Why do bad things happen to good good people?

If the devil were a woman
I wouldn't have to run away
If the devil were a woman
Maybe she'd understand me
If the devil were a woman
I wouldn't have to run away
If the devil were a woman
Maybe she'd understand me

All of my life
I've been running from the sting
Stole the honey from the hive
And the bee's still following me
All of my life
I've been running from the sting
Stole the honey from the hive
And the bee's still following me
All of my life
I've been running, I've been running
The bee's still following me
(All of my life
I've been running)
And the bee's still following me
