It's tough for me to make a move
And I know what I gotta do
'Cause I got everything to prove
I got a plan I'm sticking to
The word is that I'm over doubt
But I don't let it get me down
I ain't nobody's push around
If they could only see me now

There's only one thing on my mind
And I am running out of time
I'm coming through, so get out of the way

I am a woman on a mission, whoa
Nothing can stop me, I'm stronger than ever
I'm gonna see this through
I am a woman on a mission whoa
Whatever it takes I will do what I gotta do

I'm gonna lay it on the line
I won't give up without a fight
'Cause I can see the finish line
Won't stop until I think your mine
So read the writing on the wall
I'm ready and I'm standing tall
Some people think they know it all
I guess I'll have to show 'em all

There's only one thing on my mind
And I am running out of time
I'm coming through, so get out of the way

I am a woman on a mission, whoa
Nothing can stop me, I'm stronger than ever
I'm gonna see this through
I am a woman on a mission whoa
Whatever it takes I will do what I gotta do

Stand aside 'cause I'm on a mission
I'm on fire, there's no competition
You can't blame me, I got intuition
And I never miss a trick just like a magician
You don't need cash, you don't need permission
If you think I'm scared, you must be tripping
Foot on gas, key in ignition
Can't stop now 'cause I'm on a mission

I am a woman on a mission, whoa
Nothing can stop me, I'm stronger than ever
I'm gonna see this through
I am a woman on a mission whoa
Whatever it takes I will do what I gotta do
I never give up, I never give up, I never give up
I'm on a mission
I never give up, I never give up
I'm gonna see this through
I never give up, I never give up, I never give up
I'm on a mission
