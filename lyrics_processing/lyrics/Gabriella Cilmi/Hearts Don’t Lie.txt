Tell me that you really want me
I need a b-b-baby tonight
Been thinking about it, baby, all night
Boy, you know you're in for a ride
Tell me that you really want me
I need a b-b-baby tonight
Been thinking about it, baby, all night
Boy, you know you're in for a ride

So don't move real quick
I'll get your mind
On your feelings send
Ya reeling head to toe
So give in tonight
Don't try to fight it
What your body doesn't know I know

Our hearts don't lie (The feelings)
We just can't hide (When it's right)
So don't waste my time (Boy, believe me)
Our hearts don't lie (Oh, oh)

My heartbeat's ticking, my heartbeat's ticking, my heartbeat's ticking
When you're not around
I'm tripping, I need you, baby, now
My heartbeat's ticking, my heartbeat's ticking, my heartbeat's ticking
When you're not around
I'm tripping, I need you, baby, now
