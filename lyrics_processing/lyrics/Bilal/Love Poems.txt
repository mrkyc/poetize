Yo, I been meaning to tell you something
I guess I was just waiting for the right time, ya know?
So why don't you sit down?

As we stare from across the room
Starting to ponder what we've been going through
What does my kiss mean to you?
Are we just friends or is this more to you?

But if we label this, just picture what we might lose, yes
That unexpected kiss, the whole feeling that brought me to you
Meanwhile, my feelings grow, grow

Grow, grow
Grow, grow
Grow, grow

But if we label this, just picture what we might lose
That unexpected kiss, the feeling that brought me to you, yes
You might also like
Why rush? Why choose?
Why rush this thing and ruin me and you?
I want the lover and keep the friend
I wanna be near you and not pretend

But if we label this, just picture what we might lose
That unexpected kiss, the whole feeling that brought me to you
The whole thing's got me searching

I find myself searching for love poems
Don't know your soul, yet your presence on my brain
Causes my pen to go insane and I wrote these poems
Your sight is few and far between, bringing my soul alive
I find myself hoping for lovemakers
Love songs, the love of the universe, and my soul
Damn, what's up with my soul?
Empty like theaters after encores
Lonely like single mothers on a stoop
I am lonely and I find myself searching for love poems

Grow, grow
Grow, grow (I like you and all, I do, but, you see)
Grow, grow (Please don't go, I need you in my life)
Grow, grow (Too young, too young, got to be young, baby)
Grow, grow (Oh, won't mine realize, realize)
Grow, grow (We can be friends and do our thing)
Grow, grow (Oh, can't you hear me out and just explain this whole thing?)
Grow, grow (I'm trying to explain this whole thing, believe me)
That if we label this, just picture what we might lose
That unexpected kiss, the whole feeling that brought me to you
