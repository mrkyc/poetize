As a matter of fact, we the dopest niggas you ever wanted to fuck with
We got our peeps up in here too
And they'll roll up in ya if they need to
Like I'd do
It would be better if I do

Now, can I be true?
And you be the ear that I talk to?
And you be the one that I walk to?
You be the woman that I'm feeling even when I ain't got time to?
You understand in me
In a world so obsessed with beauty and ugliness (Ugliness)
God chose you (Baby)
And baby
For you

For you, I
I'd rob and steal
For you, I
For you
For you, I
Blast the nine
For you, for you, I'd
Ride or die
For you, I
For you
For you, I
Please believe it
For you

The only separating me from you
Is a mobile phone away
And a trip you could make in a day
Baby, trust in me, I'll handle it
Now, this may sound like some pimp shit to you, but I ain't pimpin'
Please forgive me if I appear to (Appear to)
I'm just a nigga that says what he means
So, baby it's yours if you want to
Yours if you need to
Yours, even if I have
Just as long as you're here and you're comfortable
I got some pillows in the back If you need to lay it on my shoulder
While I drive you back to my house
Though everybody knows for you

For you, I
I'd rob and steal
For you, I
For you
For you, I
Blast the nine
For you, for you, I'd
Ride or die, for you, I
For you, for you, I
Please believe it
Please believe it
Come to the light (Please believe)
'Cause you could be a star (Hey)
Come to the light
'Cause you could be a star (Please believe it, please believe it)

For you, I
I'd rob and steal
For you, I
For you
For you, I
Blast the nine
For you, I'd
Ride or die for you, I
For you, for you, I
Please believe it
I'd ride or die (For you, I)
I'd rob and steal (For you, I)
For you (For you, I)
Ooh, baby, baby, please believe it when I tell you (For you, I)
I'd ride (For you, I, for you, I)
