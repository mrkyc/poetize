Sometimes
Sometimes
I wish I wasn't me sometimes
I wish I was drug free sometimes
Wish I saw the exit sign first sometimes
Wish I knew the truth without search sometimes
I wish I could
Go where I never been
See what I never saw, do what I never did
Or walk before I could crawl sometimes
I wish my eyes wasn't so red sometimes
I wish I had breakfast in bed sometimes
I mean, it's worth it since I did all the work last night
Sometimes, you ain't good to me, yes
I am good to you (I am good to you, baby)
And you don't see my attention (And you don't see my attention)
The way that I do sometimes
Hey Slim, you should be nicer than you are sometimes
You take that complaining shit way too far
I mean, I thought it was cute in the beginning but now
I think you only do it 'cause you know I hate it sometimes
You got me wishing I didn't have home training sometimes
Then it wouldn't hurt me so bad (So bad)
With dreams of knocking you in your head (Your head)
Then it wouldn't hurt me so bad (So bad)
When I envision my foot up your ass sometimes
You might also likeWish I knew life with no pain, yeah
Wish I held the keys to this game sometimes
I pretend 'cause I'm afraid to be, 'fraid to be sometimes
I hope I live to see twenty-five sometimes
I wish I could be like Moses, round up my people
Move out the ghetto
And live a better life sometimes
I wish I didn't try so hard, sometimes
Who knows truth anyway?
They don't know nothing
Who needs that approval?
The sun is in your hands, player
Move at your own pace, listen to your own mind
Do your own thing, yeah, yeah
I'm saying it because I love ya
And I wanna grow with you, yeah, yeah
But you wanna run in the other direction
So I got to stay on my path until I win, I win, I win, I win
I wanna win, I wanna win
I wanna win, I wanna win
Sometimes, sing it with me, I wish
I wish in love and I wish, oh, I wish
I wish in peace, oh, sometimes
I wish in hope, I wish hope
I wish true, I wish true
I wish clearly, hey, I wish so clearly sometimes
Wish with no fear, I wish with no fear
I have no fear, I have no fear
Have no doubt, I have no doubt
I don't doubt, I don't doubt
Have no doubt, I don't doubt
Have no doubt, I wish love
I wish love, hey, hey
Oh, sometimes
Oh, sometimes
Oh, some
