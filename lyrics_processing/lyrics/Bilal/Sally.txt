Sally scammed me right out the condo
(How quick) How quick the mind goes
Game meets game, that's just how the life goes
Stripped a boy down to his house coat
High
High up in those skies
Cold as ice
Tell no lie, Sally
Sally scammed me right out the condo
(How quick) How quick the mind goes
Games meets game, now look at the outcome
Stripped a boy down to his house coat
High

Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-day

Knew she had a plan on the first day that I met her
Burnin' up the track from Cincinnati all the way to Kakalak
Unleash that fire
Let pimps decide
All that time it turned trick
What was runnin' through her head was "Get the licks, Sally"

Stripped me, hit me
Never shoulda fucked with me
It got twisted up when she told me that she loved me
Damn, I shoulda known
We had joint accounts but she did my banking for me
And now all that shit is gone, so gone
Sally wasn't nothin' but I treated her like somethin' (So gone, so gone)
Low down dirty and I never saw it comin'
