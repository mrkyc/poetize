Baby, you say you don't mean to hurt me but you do (Mmhmm)
And I hate you for it
But I always seem to find myself (Mmhmm, yeah)
In bed with you
The more you push me away (Yeah)
The more I want to be with you
(Like that? You like that?
Uh huh, so good
Throw it back, throw it back
Throw it back, throw it back
Yeah, ooh, so good
Good, throw it back, you like that?
Yeah, throw it back, throw it back
Throw it back, throw it back
Throw it back, throw it back, throw it back)
Hello?

Get out of my hair, girl
You can't stay here no more
Think you better get your shit and find the door
Get out of my hair, girl
Told you girl once before, I'm not having it so just get out my sight
You might also like
Come home from a hard day's work
Thinking I'm going get me some
But you're nagging 'bout my baby's momma's
And it's been a while since I made an oops, girl
Loving was good
What is really going on?
You hair and nails stay done
I didn't sign up for this

Get out of my hair, girl
You can't stay here no more
Think you better get your shit and find the door
Get out of my hair, girl
Told you girl once before, I'm not having it so just get out my sight

Why your girlfriend always over here
Say she don't like me, but she works to me off?
Always got your hand out
Asking me for money
So you can pay your momma's bill
Now, ain't that funny?
Now, I'm the man, I pay the rent, I keep the lights on
For ya
Your cell phone
Baby, don't I let you spend?
You don't work for nothing
But you always want something
We can't even be friends

Get out of my hair, girl
You can't stay here no more
Think you better get your shit and find the door
Get out of my hair, girl
Told you girl once before, I'm not having it so just get out my sight
Get out of my hair, girl
You can't stay here no more
Think you better get your shit and find the door
Get out of my hair, girl
