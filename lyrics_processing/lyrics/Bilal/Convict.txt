Yeah now I'm facing life
This is the prison life
Sleepless nights
Prison fights
I miss my family
Shit ain't going right
Living on the edge
You won't survive
If you're scared of heights
I can't take the pressure
Now I'm feeling ruthless
I bust him in the mouth
Call the motherfucker toothless
Yeah its shit if you don't prove it
So how the fuck can you play me
I'm about to loose it
Me and my life i'm moving
You can try movement
Face of a silent case shit
I'm feeling looted
They trust me
They don't even know me
It feels like the pressure
Of the whole world is leaning on me
Sleeping on the same room that I shit in
Like skinny legged jeans
I dont fit in
My life a no-thru road
Just a dead end
God forgives
But theres people that are forgive-in
You might also like
(Chorus)
Hey tell them I'm a convict
Tell them
I was living in the projects
Tell them
I'm living in hell
I need heaven
Tell me what the fuck is the point
Of this living
I can't take all this pain
All this hurt in my heart
He ain't fucking with me
Imma tear him apart
I can tell you to live
Fuck this pain from the dark
And you can find me in the team
Bitch, swimming with sharks

(Verse 2)
They say you live and learn
But I just learn and live
I've got nothing to loose
I got nothing to give
Life was hard growing up and I was just a kid
I was born and god said
Welcome to the life of sin
Its hard being Arab
They just point the finger
They make us look bad on TV
But this ain't Jerry Springer
Don't get me started I miss my girl
And my broken hearted moment
Dragged and fuck this life
I sold my soul for the price
For the price of sheep
And the devil bought me
My friends are horny
Doing these illegal things I can't affordi
The pain you can't ignore me
The devil's here
My life is haunted
I put my life on the line
But nobody's calling _
Over here you know the rain is pouring
No second chances and no warnings
Wake up to the drama
Nearly every morning
Tell me
What would you do
Put yourself in my shoes
Thats life everyday
I've got nothing to loose
(Chorus)
Hey tell them I'm a convict
Tell them
I was living in the projects
Tell them
I'm living in hell
I need heaven
Tell me what the fuck is the point
Of this living
I can't take all this pain
All this hurt in my heart
He ain't fucking with me
Imma tear him apart
I can tell you to live
Fuck this pain from the dark
And you can find me in the team
Bitch, swimming with sharks

(Outro)
Tell them I'm a convict x4
Tell 'em
Tell them I'm a convict x4
Tell 'em
(Chorus)
Hey tell them I'm a convict
Tell them
I was living in the projects
Tell them
I'm living in hell
I need heaven
Tell me what the fuck is the point
Of this living
I can't take all this pain
All this hurt in my heart
He ain't fucking with me
Imma tear him apart
I can tell you to live
Fuck this pain from the dark
And you can find me in the team
