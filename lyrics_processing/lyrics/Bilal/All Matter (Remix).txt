And all so very different
Divine by design
It all intertwines
Ain't nothin' new
But it's always changin'
Movin' still waters
Soft yet so hard
So what is love?
(What is it?)
What is love?
(What is it?)
Cool on the outside
Hot in the middle
Cool on the outside
Hot in the middle but
You ain't even gotta try
All you gotta do is realize
You ain't even gotta try
All you gotta do is realize
(It's all matter)

Like pollen in the spring breeze
A speck of dust
In this vast universe
It's just like a raindrop
In the sea of consciousness
Oh, it's all matter

So what is love?

What is love?

It's everything it ought to be
It's everything it needs to be, okay
Don't stand in the way
You'll only make it hard
Just keep it flowing
Flow with the ocean
And you'll be
Just where you should be
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Keep going, just keep going
Keep going, just keep going so
So what is love?
