Who said he was a Virgo?
He walked around doin every little thing
He thought a Virgo does
Until he read in the paper
That he might be a Leo
So he started actin out on every little thing
He thought a leo should
Til somebody hit 'em upside his head with a bottle
Now he's out there brawling in the street like a warrior
Fighting for his life
Yes he was fighting for his life. (Who are you)
Ever told you bout the girl
Who thought she was a Christian?
So she walked around tryin to save everyone
Just like the Christ had done
Until she heard from the Sun
That she was really an Egyptian
And the Pope just stole all of his concepts
Straight from the pyramid walls
Now she's searchin through her heart tryin to find the answers
To this life
This heaven, this hell
This heaven, this hell

When the band stops playin and the lights go down and
The pusher man's gone and your friends ain't around
Time to go home but it's early in the morning
And your thoughts won't stop but it's too late to get away
Do you think about the good times?
Or do you think about the bad?
Do you let them tee you off? Can you just let it go?
Tell me can you let it go?
(who are you.....who are you.....who are you)
