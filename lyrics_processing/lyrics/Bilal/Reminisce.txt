Yo
Just when I think that I forgot you
I hear that dub that we used to rock to
Just when I think I'm gettin' on without you
Somebody passed and asked me about you
Was in the back of a cab the other day
Swear to God I saw you walking past the other way (Wait a minute)
My heart rushed (Damn), my face flushed (Good God)
Tell the driver hit the brakes, slow the pace up
Wait up, It wasn't you
Realized it's a mirage I was running to
Damn, can the effects of love and time
Cause the mind to trick the eye?
I wonder how you're gettin' by
And all the stars still in your eye
But you still just get the vibe
You break the bank to spend the time
I reminisce of shifting time to when you was mine

Years ago, in the midst
Of hallways and sliding doors
Missing links are very very obscure
Vision of you shines
But only for a short time
My mistake I didn't pick up on it 'til years down the line
You might also like
Here now as I (Reminisce) reminisce
Will I ever see your face again? (Infection)
Baby, as I lay back (Reminisce)
Will I ever see your face again? (Infection)
As I reminisce (Infection)
As I reminisce (Infection)

Hold still (Uh)
The divine has placed us
In a small world (In a small world, yes)
And thankfully so (Thank God)
Our paths cross once more
And to whose surprise but mine
West 14th and 6th was the place where we combined once more
There at the front door of the corner store you stood

(Reminisce)
I reminisce infection (Infection)
As I think back (Reminisce)
Will I ever see her face again? (Infection)
As I reminisce (Infection)
As I reminisce (Infection)
A happy story always ends as it starts
But with few exceptions involved
We became an item (Me for you)
Me for you and (You for me) you for me
(Through good times and bad times) Good times
(Sickness and health)
In sickness and health (Brokeness and richness)
Brokeness and richness, baby, we made it work

Yes sir
Yo, I reminisce over this chick
Colder than a soda
Princess a soldier
Raised in Islamic culture
Sexy as the girl on the Jamaica poster (Reminisce)
Met her overseas where it really don't be no sistas
Brought her on stage as Bilal sang "Soul Sista"
In body parts the blood was thicker
Sweet only tryna make sure it ain't the liquor
She was with a nigga come to find out
She and sista backstage, conversation kissed her
Made me forget to remember that I'd pimp or die
Put the pimpin' aside, I see Kenya in her eye
Our connection lies in a life before
For us to meet again was divine law
So I can't describe how deep I dug her
Now only in memory can I hug her
I reminisce, y'all
