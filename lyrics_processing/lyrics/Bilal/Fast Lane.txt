Hey, livin' in the fast lane
Drivin' fast broads
With them fast chains
When you pimpin' through life
See some people get caught up
And some charges brought up
With some people they shot up
Hey, livin' in the fast lane
Drivin' fast broads
Makin' fast change
When you pimpin' through life
See some people get caught up
And some charges brought up
With some people they shot up

Hey, there it goes again
Different face to the same old tragic end
Who's to blame if he never saw it comin'?
Yet he heard the bullet hummin'
And he never thought of runnin'
It's too late for him now layin' out on the ground
So cold, so cold
Nothin' much to live up to, damn
It's so far gone, so gone
You might also like
Livin' in the fast lane
Drivin' fast broads
With your fast chains
When you pimpin' through life
See some people get caught up
With some charges brought up
From some people they shot up

Hey, tell me when will it end?
When the baby pays for its mother's sinnin'
Trapped inside the four walls of a penty
Way too strong, way too strong
Now she's out in the cold, dying slow and the spoon still warm

Yeah, uh, yo, ayo
It started when they birthed him
Running 'round stuck in the projects, now he can't wait 'til the first come
Little older now, he can't wait 'til the dope come
Sleep all these years and nobody awoke him
Gettin' it so he could cover the whole border (Uh-huh)
Question is how many of us could hold water
It seemed like tellin' is in, niggas assigned states
Get an order of protection and tell him again
I'm a left lane nigga
My life is much faster than yours
I'm with a chick then it's attached to a bra
Got the Air Ones matchin' the car (Uh-huh)
All white, my niggas slingin' all night so we rapidly spar
That's what they wanna clap at me for
Understand that the flow is like the coke that he naturally raw
So I'ma get my cash on and my mash on
And get my ass up out of the fast lane, it don't last long
Livin' in the fast lane
Drivin' fast broads
With your fast chains
When you're pimpin' through life
Caught up
And some charges brought up
From some people they shot up
Hey
