Hey sis, sista

It's all in her eyes, you and me
Words just disguise all the things that you be
What is deep? Steeper than steep
Soul only knows, this type of vibe gets stronger in time

Won't go on unnoticed, so concrete can't hold this
Hearts filled righteously
Whatever it is, I know that it's real
Long as you know, no complaints, you're all that I feel

Sista soul (You must be my soul sista, soul sista)
Sista soul (Hey sis, you must be my soul sista, soul sista)
Sista soul (Hey sis, you must be my soul sista)
Sista soul

You are so fine
Like spaces that fall in my soul, see, baby, that has no rhyme
Do you like how it feels when I smoke you out head down to your toes?
Making you, making you scream and shout
You might also like
You must be my soul sista, soul sista, you my (Sista soul)
You must be my soul sista, soul sista, you my (Sista soul)
You must be my soul sista, soul sista, you my (Sista soul)
You must be my soul sista, soul sista, hey (Sista soul)
Sista soul (Yeah, uh)
You must be my soul sista (Sista soul), sista, sista, sista soul

Sista soul, sista soul, sista soul, hey, baby
Can I love you in the right way, please?
Soul, hold, baby, I want to love
You know, baby, I want to love in the right way
Hold you 'cause you're my soul sista, baby, you are my sista
All I wanna do is love you in the right way
Hold you on, 'cause baby, you are my soul sista
Soul, love you in the right way, you're my, hey, hey, hey
You're my soul sista, you're my, hey, hey, hey, hey (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Soul sista, hey, my soul sista, soul
You're my soul sista, hey, yeah, yeah
I wanna love you in the right way
Hold you, don't you know what I say?
Told you, baby, don't you know?
You're my soul sista, hey
You're gonna really know it
You're, baby, I want it, I want it
Oh, gimme, gimme
