Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh

When I look at you, what I see is my future wife-to-be
Only God Himself more important in this life to me
You've been there for me, nurtured and cared for me
Never left my side, in you I can confide

Love it (I love it), love it, love it (Hey, everything about you)
Love it (Love it), love it, love it (Hey, good and the bad)
You know I love it (I love it), love it (Can't imagine life without you)
Love it (Oh), love it, love it

Give me peace of mind, conversations be so soothing
Disagree sometimes, but it only shows we're human
'Cause I'll take one for you like you were the president (Hey)
The love I have for you, one couldn't even measure it

Love it, love it, love it (Hoo, I love it)
Love it, love it, love it (Everything about you)
You know I love it, love it (Can't imagine life without you)
Love it, love it, love it (Ho, I love it)
Love it, love it, love it (Everything about you)
Love it, love it, love it (Love could end the pain)
You know I love it, love it (Hey, I love it)
Love it, love it, love it (I love it)

You and your love make this life worth livin'
You give so much of yourself and you keep on givin'

Baby, what more (Baby, what more) can I ask for?

Love it, love it, love it (Baby, and I love it)
Love it, love it, love it (Good and the bad)
You know I love it (Woah-oh), love it (Baby, I love it)
Love it, love it, love it (Everything about you and I love it)
Love it, love it, love it (Baby)
Love it, love it, love it (Woah-ho, hey, yeah)
You know I love it, love it (I love it, I love it)
Love it (I love it), love it (Love it), love it (I love it, love it)
Love it (Love it), love it (Love it), love it (Love it, love it)
Love it, love it, love it (Love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love)
You know I love it (I love it), love it (Everything about you)
Love it (I love it), love it, love it (Hey, hey, yeah)
