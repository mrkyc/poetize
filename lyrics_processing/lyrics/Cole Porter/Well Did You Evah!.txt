I have heard among this clan
You are called the forgotten man

Is that what they're saying? Well, did you ever
What a swell party this is

And have you heard the story of
A boy, a girl, unrequited love

Sounds like pure soap opera

I may cry

Tune in tomorrow
What a swell party this is
What frills, what frocks

What broads!
You might also like
What furs, what rocks!

They're beautiful

Why, I've never seen such gaity

Neither have I

Its all just too, too exquis, really

This french champagne

Domestic

So good for the brain

That's what I was going to say
You know you're a brilliant fellow?

Why, thank you

Drink up, chap
And please don't eat that glass, my friend
Have you heard about dear Blanche?
Got run down by an avalanche

No!

Oh, don't worry, she's a game girl, you know
Got up and finished 4th

This kid's got guts

Having a nice time? Grab a line

Have you heard that Mimsie Starr
Oh, what now?

She got pinched in the Astor bar

Sauced again, eh?

She was stoned

Well, did you ever?

Never!

What a swell party this is!

It's great

Ah, it's great

It's grand

So grand

It's wonderland!
La da da da...

We sing

Oh, we sing

So rare

So rare

Like old Camembert
Like Baba au Rhum!

Bababababum

Don't dig that kind of crooning, chum!

Have you heard, it's in the stars
Next July we collide with Mars?
Well, did you ever?
What a swell party, a swell party
A swellegant, elegant party this is!

I drink to your health

Nah, lets drink to your wealth

You're my bon ami

Hey, that's french

Liberty

Fraternity
Have you heard, it's in the stars
Next July we collide with Mars?
Well, did you ever?
What a swell party, swell party
