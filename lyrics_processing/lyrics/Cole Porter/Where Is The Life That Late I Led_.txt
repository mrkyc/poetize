Since I reached the charming age of puberty
And began to think of feminine curls
Like a show that's typically Shuberty
I have always had a multitude of girls
But now that a married man at last am I
How aware of my dear departed past am I
(Chorus 1)
Where is the life that late I led?
Where is it now? Totally dead!
Where is the fun I used to find?
Where has it gone? Gone with the wind!
A married life may all be well
But raising an heir
Could never compare
With raising a bit of hell
So I repeat what first I said
Where is the life that late I...
(Bridge 1)
In dear Milano, where are you Momo?
Still selling those pictures
Of the Scriptures
In the Duomo?
And Carolina, where are you, 'lina?
Still peddling your pizza
In the streets-a
Taormina?
And in Firenze, where are you Alice?
Still there in your pretty
Itty-bitty pity
Palace?
And sweet Lucretia, so young and gay
What scandalous doings
In the ruins
Of Pompeii
You might also like(Chorus 2)
Where is the life that late I led?
Where is it now? Totally dead!
Where is the fun I used to find?
Where has it gone? Gone with the wind!
The marriage game is quite all right
Yes during the day
It's easy to play
But oh what a bore at night
So I repeat what first I said
Where is the life that late I...
(Bridge 2)
Where is Rebecca? My Becky-wecky-oh
Could still she be cruising
That amusing
Ponte Vecchio?
Where is Fedora, the wild virago?
It's lucky I missed her
Gangster sister
From Chicago
Where is Venetia, who loved to chat so?
Could still she be drinking
In her stinking
Pink palazzo?
And lovely Lisa, where are you Lisa?
You gave a new meaning
To the Leaning
Tower of Pisa
(Chorus 3)
Where is the life that late I led?
Where is it now? Totally dead!
Where is the fun I used to find?
Where has it gone? Gone with the wind!
I've oft been told of nuptial bliss
But what do you do
At quarter to two
With only a shrew to kiss?
So I repeat what first I said
