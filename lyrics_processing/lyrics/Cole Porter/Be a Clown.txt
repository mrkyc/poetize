I remember forever
When I was three
Mama, who was clever
Remarking to me
"Son, when you're grown up
And you want everything nice
I've got your future sewn up
If you'll take this advice."
(Chorus 1)
Be a clown
Be a clown
All the world
Loves a clown
Be a fool
Play the calf
And you'll always have the last laugh
Wear the cap
And the bells
And you'll rate with all the great swells
If you become a doctor, folks'll face you with dread
If you become a dentist, they'll be glad when you're dead
You'll get a bigger hand if you can stand on your head
Be a clown, be a clown, be a clown
You might also like(instrumental break)
(Chorus 2)
Be a clown
Be a clown
All the world
Loves a clown

Show them tricks

Tell 'em jokes

And you'll only stop with top folks
Wear some huge
Baggy pants
And you'll ride the road to romance

A butcher or a baker ladies never embrace

A barber at a ball would be a social disgrace
They all will come to call if you can fall on your face
Be a clown, be a clown, be a clown
(Chorus 3)
Be a clown
Be a clown
All the world
Loves a clown

Be a grande buffoon

And the demoiselles'll all swoon

Be a crack Jackanapes
And they'll imitate you like apes

Why be a great composer with your rent in arrears?

Why be a major poet and you'll owe it for years
When crowds'll pay to giggle if you wiggle your ears?
Be a clown, be a clown, be a clown
(Chorus 4)
Be a clown
Be a clown
All the world
Loves a clown

Be the poor, silly ass

And you'll always travel first class

Give 'em quips, give 'em fun
And they'll happy to say you're A-1

If you become a farmer, you've the weather to buck

If you become a gambler, then you're stuck with your luck

But Jack, you'll never lack if you can quack like a duck
Be a clown, be a clown, be a clown
