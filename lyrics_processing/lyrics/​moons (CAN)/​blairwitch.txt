Rotten in the broken shack
Try to fight it, bones will crack
Trapped inside my woods
You bitch, you bitch, you never make it back
It don't even matter
There's no trace of you within past
Only remnants of your body
Is the tape on play-back
Hunnid years back in the past
Holding out them blood pacts
Next fucking winter
There gon' be another blood bath
Take it as you want it
But your vision is just simply black
Face the facts
'Cause I know your family jus' ain't doin'  that

Blair Witch shit
Never fucking let 'em off
What's ya' sin?
Shoulda' never let the devil's in
Blair Witch shit
Never fucking let 'em off
What's ya' sin?

You a tourist? You can walk into my forest
Ya sister went missing 'cause I ate her fuckin' organs
Into witchcraft, so I turned her into porridge
Break a stick, I'll hear you walk, I'll find you in the morning
When its midnight, I'll fuckin' slump you while recording
Take you where your friends are motherfuckin' stored in
Inside a box, inside my freezer
This is murder, this ain't a misdemeanor
In my own realm, cause I fuckin' bend reality
Switch through dimensions when I'm tearing through your gravity
Anatomy, take ya fuckin' mouth out if you laugh at me
I turn you into void because I fuckin' snap trees
At your spine, I turn you into dust
I kill a generation and I don't really give a fuck
Black energy wanna run me up, like huh?
Everything getting blurry, can't you see me bruh?

I'm the Blair fuckin' Witch, I could turn your life around
Keep you in my forest and I'll keep you on the ground
You are nothing but my slave, to my black fuckin' energy
I have the control because I'll erase your fuckin' memory
I'm the Blair fuckin' Witch, I could turn your life around
Keep you in my forest and I'll keep you on the ground
You are nothing but my slave, to my black fuckin' energy
I have the control because I'll erase your fuckin' memory
I'm the Blair fuckin' Witch, I could turn your life around
Keep you in my forest and I'll keep you on the ground
You are nothing but my slave, to my black fuckin' energy
I have the control because I'll erase your fuckin' memory
I'm the Blair fuckin' Witch, I could turn your life around
Keep you in my forest and I'll keep you on the ground
You are nothing but my slave, to my black fuckin' energy
