Just had a new addition to the family
Thankful for his sanity
Ten fingers ten toes everywhere they said it be
Im just here workin' everywhere i said I be
Everywhere the cheddar be from Largo to Kettering
Cap Heights Seat Pleasant Landover Settlin'
No time to worry bout a hater Tryna better me
Back in eighth grade in a gang called felony
Never went to jail but I still repped it heavily
Talent show heavenly
Canibus let em' see Beast from the East from the Lost Boyz LP
No Doubt
Only song rest of the school ever heard about was Second Round Knockout
But being that my Plainfield roots
Introduced me to the hip-hop truth
Still spit a nigga lines like its mine but its fine
Im a student of the game and Ima' grind till its time
Aye thats real shit
That was Lowe's Grove Middle School man Durham North Carolina
And I was fresh from mother fuckin' Plainfield New Jersey ya dig
But Im a Largo nigga forever DMV feel me Terp Town
Hey that was Bull City Nine Seven Nine Eight
Now I got my own pen bout to make my own plate
And Im bout to make my own way
Cuz sky's the limit you live it like the song say
One hundred percent real this is all day
Straight drop in the pot like its raw ye
Use to move pounds of green in broad day
Park bench where the kids play was our way
Look hey I ain't glorifyin' my past
But in the ninth grade I was hustlin' for cash
Make your request known Id steal it in a flash
Just run up in Target like Damon I'd dash
Tryna be cool sell it to you in class
Cuz Largo High School was a fool gotta laugh
My girl think she know but she don't know the half
If it wasn't for my coach I probably wouldn't of passed
Thats real shit
You know when your an athlete you get special privileges
But you know that shit kinda crippled a nigga when he hit real life
You feel me but its cool nigga went back to school and shit
Swallowed my pride at twenty five
Look I still maneuver round the opposition
Like a ball player but on another mission
I hear you sneak dissin'
I leave you slumped in your sleep for all that weak spittin'
Call me Rico
You know Paid in Full made a move
Cuz I swear I gotta come up or everybody a plate of food
Cuz when you broke you Bojangles you play the fool
Wise words to the kids
Stay in school
Know the rules to the game before you play it
Cuz you can get shot not living what you sayin'
Aye hell is hot I feel the fire so Im prayin'
Im finna start a riot Revolution Revelation
Masters Degree got my college education
But still hood tatted from my foot to my face and
Face it the game need changin'
And Im that nigga thats gon' change it
