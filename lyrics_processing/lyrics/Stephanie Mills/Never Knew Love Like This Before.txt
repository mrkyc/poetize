I never knew love like this before
Now I'm lonely never more
Since you came into my life

You are my lovelight this I know
And I'll never let you go
You're my all, you're part of me

Once I was lost and now I'm found
Then you turned my world around
When I need I call your name

Cause I never knew love like this before
Opened my eyes
Cause I never knew love like this before
What a surprise
Cause I never knew love like this before

This feeling's so deep inside of me
Such a tender fantasy
You're the one I'm living for

And time could never change
What we share forevermore

I never knew love like this before
Now I'm lonely never more
Since you came into my life

Cause I never knew love like this before
Opened my eyes
Cause I never knew love like this before
What a surprise
Cause I never knew love like this before

You are my lovelight this I know
And I'll never let you go
You're my all, you're part of me

Once I was lost and now I'm found
Then you turned my world around
When I need I call your name
Cause I never knew love like this before
Opened my eyes
Cause I never knew love like this before
What a surprise
Cause I never knew love like this before
Inside of me
Never knew love like this before
Opened my eyes
