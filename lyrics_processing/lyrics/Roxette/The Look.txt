(One, two, three, four)

Walking like a man, hitting like a hammer
She's a juvenile scam
Never was a quitter, tasted like a raindrop
She's got the look

Heavenly bound, 'cause heaven's got her number
When she's spinnin' me around
Kissin' is a color, her lovin' is a wild dog
She's got the look

She's got the look (She's got the look!)
She's got the look (She's got the look!)
What in the world can make a brown-eyed girl turn blue?
When everything I'll ever do, I'll do for you
And I go la-la-la-la-la
She's got the look!

Fire in the ice, naked to the T-bone
Is a lover's disguise
Bangin' on the head drum, shakin' like a mad bull
She's got the look
See Roxette LiveGet tickets as low as $76You might also like
Swayin' to the band, movin' like a hammer
She's a miracle man
Lovin' is the ocean, and kissin' is the wet sand
She's got the look

She's got the look (She's got the look!)
She's got the look (She's got the look!)
What in the world can make a brown-eyed girl turn blue?
When everything I'll ever do, I'll do for you
And I go la-la-la-la-la
She's got the look!
(Ow!)


Walkin' like a man, hitting like a hammer
She's a juvenile scam
Never was a quitter, tasted like a raindrop
She's got the look

And she goes

What in the world can make a brown-eyed girl turn blue?
When everything I'll ever do, I'll do for you
And I go la-la-la-la-la
She's got the look!
What in the world can make you so blue?
When everything I'll ever do, I'll do for you
And I go la-la-la-la-la
