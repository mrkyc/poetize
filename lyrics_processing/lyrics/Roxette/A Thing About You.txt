I pick up the phone
I'm dialing your number
While I pray you're at home
At home and alone
Cause I can't function on my own
And I'll never stop believing

The reaping is done
You are the one
The radio is on
But the sound is all gone
And I wanna walk out in the sun
But lately
That's been very hard to do

I've got a thing about you
And I don't really know what to do
Cause I've got a thing about you
Hey, you

I pick up the phone
I'm dialing that number
And my heart, like a stone
Waits for the tone
Oh, I can't make it on my own
And I'll never stop believing

I know what is right
And this is so wrong
Alone in my bed, better off on my own
The tv is on but the colors are gone
And lately
You've been painting my world blue

I've got a thing about you (I've got a thing about you)
And I don't really care what you do
I've got a thing about you (I've got a thing about you)
Yeah, you

I've got a thing about you
I've got a thing about you
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Lately
You've been painting my world blue

I've got a thing about you (I've got a thing about you, I've got a thing about you)
And I don't really know what to do
I've got a thing about you (I've got a thing about you, I've got a thing about you)
Hoping this story cuts through (This story cuts through)
Yeah, I've got a thing about you (I've got a thing about you, I've got a thing about you)
A thing about you
I've got a thing about you
I've got a thing about you
And I don't really know what to do
I've got a thing about you
I've got a thing about you
I've got a thing about you
