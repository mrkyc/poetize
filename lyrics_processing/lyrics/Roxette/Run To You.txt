Driving while I'm closing my eyes
Movin' in and out of hiding
Trying to catch some truth in my life
Watching your stars and your moonlight
Come tumbling down from the sky
Take it now!
I'm gonna run to you
I'm gonna come to you
I wanna find you in everything that I do
I gonna run to you
I'm gonna count on you
I'm gonna follow
Baby, what else can I do?
Sunday morning my town is sleeping (sleeping)
Lying all alone in my bed
There's not a sound I can't help but listening
Wishing I was somewhere else instead
But sometimes they're too hard to handle
Those voices inside my head
Listen now!
I'm gonna run to you
I'm gonna come to you
I wanna find you in everything that I do
(Everything that I do for you)
I'm gonna run to you
I'm gonna count on you
I'm gonna follow
Baby, what else can I do?

All the people come and go and come and go
I'm gonna run to you
I'm gonna come to you
Do it now!
I'm gonna run to you
I'm gonna count on you
I'm gonna follow, oh oh

I'm gonna come to you
I wanna find you in everything that I do
