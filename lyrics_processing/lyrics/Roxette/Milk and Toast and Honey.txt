Milk and toast and honey
Make it sunny on a rainy Saturday, he-he-hey
Milk and toast, some coffee
Take the stuffiness out of days you hate
You really hate

Slow morning news pass me by
I try not to analyze
But didn't he blow my mind this time?
Didn't he blow my mind?

(Here he comes)
To bring a little lovin', honey
(Here he comes)
To take away the hurt inside
(Here he comes)
Is everything that matters to me
(Here he comes)
Is everything I want in life

Milk and toast and honey
Ain't it funny how things sometimes look so clear
And feel so near
The dreams I dream, my favorite wishful thinkin'
Oh he's bookmarked everywhere, everywhere
See Roxette LiveGet tickets as low as $76You might also like
True love might fall from the sky
Oh, you never know what to find
But didn't he blow my mind this time?
Didn't he blow my mind?

(Here he comes)
To bring a little lovin', honey
(Here he comes)
To take away the pain inside
(Here he comes)
Is everything that matters to me
(Here he comes)
Is everything I want from life

(Here he comes)
Oh lay a little lovin', honey
(Here he comes)
To feel you're gettin' close to me
(Here he comes)
Is everything that matters to me
(Here he comes)
Is everywhere I want to be
Na na na na na na

(Here he comes)
Oh, to bring a little lovin', honey
(Here he comes)
To take away the pain inside
(Here he comes)
Is everything that matters to me
(Here he comes)
Is everything I want from life

(Here he comes)
Oh lay a little lovin', baby, baby
(Here he comes)
You're gettin' close to me
(Here he comes)
Is everything that matters to me
(Here he comes)
Is everywhere I want to be

To bring a little lovin' is everything I want
To lay a little lovin' is everything I want
Oh, here he comes
