What am I gonna do when I get a little excited
And a little in pain, tell me
What am I gonna say when I find
The centre of my heart is a suburb to the brain?

You wear them so well, those innocent eyes
You're puttin' on a wonderful disguise
I want you so bad
I'm pushing my luck
It feels like being hit by a truck

This is no place special
Don't know why I came
If someone has a minute
Won't you explain

What am I gonna do when I get a little excited
And a little in pain, tell me
What am I gonna say when I find
The centre of my heart is a suburb to the brain?

Sing na nana nana na
Na nana nana na

Being with you, dealing with fire
Oh won't you come around (come out)
Come out (today) and play
(I want you so bad)
Answer my calls
Let's spend the night within these walls

This is no place special
Nothing for the sane (nothing for the sane)
If someone's got a minute
Do please explain

What am I gonna do when I get a little excited
And a little in pain, tell me
What am I gonna say when I find
The centre of my heart is a suburb to the brain?

Sing na nana nana na
Na nana nana na

What am I gonna do when I get a little excited
And a little in pain, tell me
What am I gonna say when I find
The centre of my heart is a suburb to the brain?
Sing na nana nana na
Na nana nana na

(What am I gonna to do)
What am I gonna do when I get a little excited, a little in pain?
(The centre of my heart
Yeah, yeah, yeah)
What am I gonna say when I find the centre of my heart is a suburb to the brain?
(Come on, come on, come on, come on
What am I gonna do now?)
