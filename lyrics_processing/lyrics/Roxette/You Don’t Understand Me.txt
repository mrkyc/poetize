I've been up all night
You've been putting up a fight
Seems like nothing I say gets through
How did this old bed fit a world between me and you?
We said "Goodnight," but the silence was so thick
You could cut it with a knife
We've hit the wall again, and there's nothing I can do
You're the one
Yeah, I've put all my trust in your hands
Come on and look in my eyes
Here I am, here I am

You don't understand me, my baby
You don't seem to know that I need you so much
You don't understand me, my feelings
The reason I'm breathing, my love

The morning comes and you're reaching out for me
Just like everything's the same
And I let myself believe things are gonna change
When you kiss my mouth and you hold my body close
Do you wonder who's inside?
Maybe there's no way we could feel each other's pain
Tell me why it gets harder to know where I stand
I guess loneliness found a new friend, here I am

'Cause you don't understand me, my baby
You don't seem to know that I need you so much
'Cause you don't understand me, my feelings
The reason I'm breathing, my love
Oh, you don't seem to get me, my baby
'Cause you don't really see that I live for your touch
You don't understand me
My dreams or the things I believe in, my love

You don't understand me
'Cause you don't understand me
No, no
