(Ooh, just a little bit dangerous)

You pack your bag, you take control
You're movin' into my heart, and into my soul
Get out of my way, get out of my sight
I won't be walking on thin ice to get through the night

Hey where's your work? What's your game?
I know your business, don't know your name

Hold on tight, you know she's a little bit dangerous
She's got what it takes to make ends meet
The eyes of a lover that hit like heat
You know she's a little bit dangerous

You turn around, so hot and dry
You're hidin' under a halo, your mouth is alive
Get out of my way, get out of my sight
I'm not attracted to go-go, deeper tonight

Hey, what's your work? What's your game?
I know your business, but I don't know your name

The eyes of a lover that hit like heat
You know she's a little bit dangerous
