Have you cried yourself to sleep?
Have you felt this incomplete?
Have you ever cut yourself so deep
To see if you still bleed?
Do you ever feel wanted?
Do you ever feel needed?
Do you ever feel happy?
Or are you just like me?

I'm hanging by a thread, a rope
The noose around my neck, I choke
'Cause every time I fall in
Love falls out of me
I'm hardened like a rock, a stone
The brick inside my chest, alone
'Cause every time I fall in
Love falls out of me
Love falls out of me

Have you ever wished for death?
And prayed all night for your last breath?
Have you ever wanted to forget
The failure of your dreams?
Because I've never felt wanted
And I've never felt needed
And I'll never be happy
But I guess that's just me
You might also like
I'm hanging by a thread, a rope
The noose around my neck, I choke
'Cause every time I fall in
Love falls out of me
I'm hardened like a rock, a stone
The brick inside my chest, alone
'Cause every time I fall in
Love falls out of me

I'll never forget the day I died
The memory's frozen and denied
Flower of my heart withered and dried

I'm hanging by a thread, a rope
The noose around my neck, I choke
'Cause every time I fall in
Love falls out of me
I'm hardened like a rock, a stone
The brick inside my chest, alone
'Cause every time I fall in
Love falls out of me

I'm hanging by a thread, a rope
The noose around my neck, I choke
'Cause every time I fall in
Love falls out of me
'Cause every time I fall in
Love falls out of me
