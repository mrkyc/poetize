We are... DMFs
Breaking you down, jumping you in
Down motherfuckers!
We live by a code: to live in the pit
DMFs branding the rules
We'll step on your neck
Down motherfuckers!
We're lighting a fuse, coming to wreck
We are DMF!

Feels like it was just yesterday
That we started this family
I had to facilitate a new order
The height of honesty, built on integrity
This society, few are worthy
This passion can't be stripped away from me
Like every other fucking thing
Fused together, we press on
No one can break this bond

Strength so strong
We own as one

DMFs breaking you down
Jumping you in
Down motherfuckers!
We live by a code: to live in the pit
DMFs branding the rules
We'll step on your neck
Down motherfuckers!
We're lighting a fuse, coming to wreck
We are DMF

It's more than just a little flame
That burns inside of me
I had to instigate, initiate
A new level of loyalty
The highest priority
The standard of trust in me
My call to duty

All for one and one for all
We are the alpha dogs
We're put together, all together
And the pieces fit
Strength so strong
We own as one

DMFs breaking you down
Jumping you in
Down motherfuckers!
We live by a code: to live in the pit
DMFs branding the rules
We'll step on your neck
Down motherfuckers!
We're lighting a fuse, coming to wreck
We are DMF
We are DMF

You people are all the fucking same
I'm changing the rules, and raising the bar
This ain't no fucking game
We are one, one, so put your horns up (One, one)
We are one, one, so put your fists up (One, one)
We are one, one, so put your horns up (One, one)
We are DMF, so get the fuck up!

Strength so strong
We own as one
DMFs breaking you down
Jumping you in
Down motherfuckers!
We live by a code: to live in the pit
DMFs branding the rules
We'll step on your neck
Down motherfuckers!
We're lighting a fuse, coming to wreck
We are DMF
