Yeah!

Fuck the norm, I can't understand
Live my life by the rules of no one
I am me; that can't be wrong
I do what I do when I do; that's how I like it
Conformity, amputate my soul
Made of stone, smashed the mold
Indifferent, so fuck you, all that
Whine, bitch, nag, complain, cry

If ya don't give a shit, ya getcha Hellyeah
Throwin' fists in the pit, ya getcha Hellyeah
Think you're fuckin' with this, well, hell, no
Balls, volume, strength, getcha, come on
Drinking beer, smoking weed, ya getcha' Hellyeah
Got a bruised attitude, ya getcha Hellyeah
Think you're fuckin' with this, well, hell, no
Balls, volume, strength, getcha, come on

Fuck you all, that won't understand
Be a man, no more and no less
I'm just me, no matter what you say
I am who I am, what I am; that's how I like it
Typical, fucking lifeless clones
My attitude: embrace my own
I don't care, so just walk away and live your
Dull, dead, bland, boring life
You might also like
If ya don't give a shit, ya getcha Hellyeah
Throwin' fists in the pit, ya getcha Hellyeah
Think you're fuckin' with this, well, hell, no
Balls, volume, strength, getcha, come on
Drinking beer, smoking weed, ya getcha' Hellyeah
Got a bruised attitude, ya getcha Hellyeah
Think you're fuckin' with this, well, hell, no
Balls, volume, strength, getcha, come on

Don't give a fuck and don't think I ever will
For the prim and the proper, it's a shallow, jagged pill
Don't really care if you like me
I just hold up my drink and get my Hellyeah!
So, point your fingers and throw your stones
I'll be smokin' and drinkin' and breaking fucking bones
To all you fuckin' people thinkin' you're better than me
I hold up my middle finger and give my Hellyeah!

If ya don't give a shit, ya getcha Hellyeah
Throwin' fists in the pit, ya getcha Hellyeah
Think you're fuckin' with this, well, hell, no
Balls, volume, strength, getcha, come on
Drinking beer, smoking weed, ya getcha' Hellyeah
Got a bruised attitude, ya getcha Hellyeah
Think you're fuckin' with this, well, hell, no
Balls, volume, strength, getcha, come on
Hellyeah!
Got your whiskey and weed
Hellyeah!
Come on
Hellyeah!
Balls, volume, and strength

Hellyeah!
Hellyeah!
Hellyeah!
Hellyeah!
