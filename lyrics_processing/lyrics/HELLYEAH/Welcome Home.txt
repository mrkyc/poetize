Far off in the distance, the storm's closing in
The pressure collapsing, bright skies become dim
This scent all around me, give memories new life
Knots that I've loosened still tangled inside
Ominous clouds, no sun in the sky
Is this a metaphor for my tragic demise?
The colors are gray on my canvas of life
The picture's complete, but the paint just won't dry

The smell of rain in the sky
The tears are gone, the well is dry
Why is my feeling of loss like a welcome home?
So welcome home
All the light fades to dark
All that's good gets torn apart
Why is this feeling of loss like a welcome home?
So welcome home

And those dirty little whispers, demon's voice in my head
Angel over my shoulder, evil needs to be fed
Hot flashes turn cold as day turns to night
My head starts to ache because something's not right
Pour salt in my wounds, I'm cut deep inside
Battered and bruised, bones breaking, teeth bite
Tattered and torn, pour gas on my life
You can burn up the book, but the pages survive
You might also like
The smell of rain in the sky
The tears are gone, the well is dry
Why is my feeling of loss like a welcome home?
So welcome home
All the light fades to dark
All that's good gets torn apart
Why is this feeling of loss like a welcome home?
So welcome home, so welcome home

So welcome home
So welcome home
So welcome home
So welcome

The sky is falling, the sky is falling down
The ocean's flooding, the oceans are swelling everywhere all around
The fire's burning, fire burns me to the ground
What the fuck was I waiting for?
All you fucking little pigs, I'll blow you down

The smell of rain in the sky
The tears are gone, the well is dry
Why is my feeling of loss like a welcome home?
So welcome home
All the light fades to dark
All that's good gets torn apart
Why is this feeling of loss like a welcome home?
So welcome home, so welcome home
So welcome home
So welcome home
