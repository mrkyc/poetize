S-T-A-R-T A R-I-O-T

You can cut me, knife me, shoot me
Jab me, carve me up, and stab me
But you'll never defeat me
You can shoot me, blast me, gun me down
Try to put me underground
You'll never defeat me
I've got an army on my back
And if we're under attack
You better be fucking ready
Undeniable unity
In the metal community
And we're coming to bury

Tooth and nail, we fight
Riot!
Firebomb at my side
Riot!
Fight fire with fire
Riot!
Swarm like buzzsaws and
Riot!

Fuck peace and quiet
Let's start a riot
Psycho or psychotic
Let's start a riot
Fuck peace, be violent
Let's start a riot
Psycho or psychotic
Get nuts and start a riot

S-T-A-R-T A R-I-O-T

You can abuse and bruise
Insult, refuse, I'll never lose
You lit my fuse
And you'll never break me
You can start a war
Fuck me around, destroy my life
And tear me down
But you'll never break me
You can bust me
Jump me, punch and pound
Left me dead, tied up and bound
But I fuckin' broke through
You can disrespect
Till I erupt you piss me off and
I'll fuck you up
And I'll fuckin' break you
Tooth and nail, we fight
Riot!
Firebomb at my side
Riot!
Fight fire with fire
Riot!
Swarm like buzzsaws and
Riot!

Fuck peace and quiet
Let's start a riot
Psycho or psychotic
Let's start a riot
Fuck peace, be violent
Let's start a riot
Psycho or psychotic
Get nuts and start a riot
