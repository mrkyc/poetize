You're as perfect as an apple with a worm and a bruise
You're as perfect as a song out of key, out of tune

You're as perfect as a dream that will never come true
You're as perfect as a sky that will never be blue
Just another bottom-feeder selling pigs in a poke
So go be perfectly imperfect and just leave me alone

Live to fight (Fight) another day (Another day)
So I'll meet you at the gallows so I can watch you swing
Live to fight (Fight) another day (Another day)
I can't wait to pull the plug and watch you circle 'round and 'round and down the drain

You're as perfect as a rose that's all thorns and won't bloom
You're as perfect as a photo out of focus with no view

You're as perfect as a promise that's been broken in two
You're as perfect as a bomb with no light for the fuse
You just are who you are, you think I like you, I don't
So just do us all a favor, take your ball and go home

Gonna bring the pain, gonna fan the flame
Gonna burn you up and watch you circle down the drain

I live to fight another day
So I'll meet you at the gallows so I can watch you swing

I can't wait to pull the plug and watch you circle 'round the drain
