I took out the stitches, but my scars will always bleed
So dark inside, I'm a hard story to read
I'll probably never feel better, but I can always dream
All my life riddled with pain
You're staring through a hallow man
Persecution, the retribution
For whatever it was I did
To find my pride, my will, my love
My self respect has come undone
Close to losing life by my own hand
Dig deep inside to find my worth
To instigate my own rebirth
At death's door but there's been a change of plan
Life, death, it's my call
Hopeless, I was taught to be this
Want it, take it, my law
You can call it arrogance, but I just call it like I see it
When I think, it's not as bad as it seems
My cold dead tainted heart always reminds me
All my life consumed with hate
It's the disease my head creates
Motivation through determination
Find happiness that I've displaced
I'm letting go of everything
Of everyone that's in my way
Of all the things in life that keep me down
Claim the space that's my domain
Scream fuck you all and scrap plate
Past is in the trash and I am done
You might also likeLife, death, it's my call
Hopeless, I was taught to be this
Want it, take it, my law
You can call it arrogance but I just call it like I see it
I call it, call it like I see it
Call it
Call it, call it like I see it
Life, death, it's my call
Hopeless, I was taught to be this
Want it, take it, my law
You can call me arrogant but I just call it like I see it
Life, death, my call
Hardness, I've grown up to be this
Ruin, destroy me, fuck you all
