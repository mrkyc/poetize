I don't know where I'm at, but it's time to go
I've got bats in my head
Pressure building up slow
So, don't even bother to say hello
Lights may be on
But there's nobody at home
I'm idling on empty in my world alone
My fortune of misfortune got me ready to blow
Mushroom cloud in my head
And I'm taking a stand
I've got a pocket full of bullets
And there's two guns in my hand

Can I get a victim?
I can be the victim?

I took a chance on a leap of faith
But the net gave way
On cold, hard ground below, I bleed
I took a chance on a leap of faith
Now there's no escaping
The only gift God granted me
Is this curse that I carry on
You might also like
I live inside a storm with no calm in the eye
I'm under the gun, or I'm under the knife
Inside of my head, there's a panic ensuing
I've tied myself in knots
And there's no one to undo them
I'm praying for peace up in a clocktower shooting
My left half doesn't know
What my right half is doing
Anxiety is building up inside my mind
The bags are stacking up
And I'm just waiting here to die

Can I get a victim?
I wanna be the victim!

I took a chance on a leap of faith
But the net gave way
On cold, hard ground below, I bleed
I took a chance on a leap of faith
Now there's no escaping
The only gift God granted me
Is this curse that I carry on

The sun fades to black
And the hope's becoming dimmer
There's a chill in my bones
Like the dead cold of winter
Confused when confronted
By the man in the mirror
A sinner? A saint?
A savior? Or a killer?!

I took a chance on a leap of faith
But the net gave way
On cold, hard ground below, I bleed
I took a chance on a leap of faith
Now there's no escaping
The only gift God granted me

On cold, hard ground below, I bleed
The only gift God granted me
