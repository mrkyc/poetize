It's just the good ol' boy in me
I got my friends, I got the recipe
For one hell of a life
I got my girl, got my family
Got my booze, and that's all I need
For a hell of a time

Yeah, come Monday morning
My head is stormin'
Gotta get it right
I've got my boss
And I've got my bills
But I'm toeing the line
So sick of that man
On my case all day long
Another day in the trenches
These son of a bitches
Well, it don't seem right
They keep me poor
While I keep 'em rich
But I got my eye on the prize
Gotta get to the weekend
Gotta make it to Friday night

Hell of a time!

Six o'clock in the mornin'
My head is spinnin'
Here we go again
I'm walking the line
One day at a time
For that goddamn man
Can't wait till they bury him
Six feet down
I've got my pride
And I've got my will
I ain't fucking around
I was born to lose
But I'm built for booze
Can't wait to knock 'em down
Gotta get to the weekend
Gotta make it to Friday night
Friday night, yeah

It's just the good ol' boy in me
I got my friends, I got the recipe
For one hell of a life
I got my girl, got my family
Got my booze, and that's all I need
For a hell of a time

Gonna take the red-eye
To come home Sunday night, yeah
I got everything I need
Just as long as I can stay high, yeah
Come on!
