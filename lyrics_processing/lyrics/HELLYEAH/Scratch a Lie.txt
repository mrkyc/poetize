Dead in a ditch
Is where I dumped that little bitch
That'll teach a motherfucker
To double-cross me again
Your last mistake
Was that you thought we were friends
Then I wrapped you up in plastic
And I taped up the ends
Who I am in the dark's
Who I am in the light
Who I am in the day's
Who I am in the night
Now the rat is in the bag
And the bag is in the river
Forgot about you already
But at least I got a picture

I gave you what you got
And you got what you deserved
I gave you what you got
And you got what you deserved
I gave you what you got
And you got what you deserved
You deserve what you get
And you get what you deserve

Scratch a lie, scratch a lie, find a thief
I'll always find a way to get my relief
Scratch a lie, scratch a lie, find a thief
I'm always gonna try to betray and deceive
Scratch a lie, scratch a lie, find a thief
I'll always find a way to get my relief
Scratch a lie, I'm a lie, I'm a thief
My violence and vices are my own disease

Dead in the ditch
Is where I left that little monkey
My faults and corruption
And addiction so ugly
Thought I broke the bottle
But the bottle broke me
I was locked up and loaded
And they threw away the key
Who you are in the dark's
Who you are in the light
Who you are in the day's
Who you are in the night
Now the monkey's on my back
But the bag's in the river
So, here I go again
I'm a repeat offender!
I gave you what you got
And you got what you deserved
I gave you what you got
And you got what you deserved
I gave you what you got
And you got what you deserved
You deserve what you get
And you get what you deserve

Scratch a lie, scratch a lie, find a thief
I'll always find a way to get my relief
Scratch a lie, scratch a lie, find a thief
I'm always gonna try to betray and deceive
Scratch a lie, scratch a lie, find a thief
I'll always find a way to get my relief
Scratch a lie, I'm a lie, I'm a thief
My violence and vices are my own disease


Scratch a lie
Scratch a lie
Scratch a lie
Scratch a lie
Scratch a lie, scratch a lie, find a thief
I'll always find a way to get my relief
Scratch a lie, scratch a lie, find a thief
I'm always gonna try to betray and deceive
Scratch a lie, scratch a lie, find a thief
I'll always find a way to get my relief
Scratch a lie, I'm a lie, I'm a thief
My violence and vices are my own disease
Scratch a lie, scratch a lie, find a thief
I'll always find a way to get my relief
Scratch a lie, behind the veil, I'm the thief
I'm always gonna try to betray and deceive
Scratch a lie, scratch a lie, find a thief
I'll always find a way to get my relief
Scratch a lie, behind the veil, I'm the thief
My violence and vices are my own disease

Scratch a lie
Scratch a lie
