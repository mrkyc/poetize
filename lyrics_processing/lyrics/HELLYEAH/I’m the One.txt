(I'm the one, I'm the one, I'm the one)
(I'm the one, I'm the one)

Stumbling, I fall
Bloody hands and knees, I crawl
When there's no one left to fault
I'm the one, I'm the one
Still searching for a smile
Been tormented my whole life
I'm condemned until I die
'Til I'm done, 'til I'm done

I'm the one
If you just wanna lie, steal, and cheat
I'm the one
If you wanna destroy and defeat
I'm the one
If you need a public enemy
I'm the one (I'm the one)
I'm the one (I'm the one)
I'm the one

(I'm the one, I'm the one, I'm the one)
(I'm the one, I'm the one)

Sacrificed my soul
Going down the rabbit hole
On this hopeless, dead-end road
For so long, for so long
Condemn me and kick me out
Punish me and push me down
I've been broken since the dawn
Life goes on, life goes on

I'm the one
If you just wanna lie, steal and cheat
I'm the one
If you wanna destroy and defeat
I'm the one
If you wanna see somebody bleed
I'm the one (I'm the one)
I'm the one (I'm the one)
I'm the one
If you need to hurt, rage, or release
I'm the one
If you're looking for tragedy
I'm the one
If you need a public enemy
I'm the one (I'm the one)
I'm the one (I'm the one)
I'm the one
I'm the one

Kept me in the dark
Cut me and left a scar
But if you need my heart
I'm the one, I'm the one

I'm the one
If you just wanna lie, steal, and cheat
I'm the one
If you wanna destroy and defeat
I'm the one
If you wanna see somebody bleed
I'm the one (I'm the one)
I'm the one (I'm the one)
I'm the one
If you need to hurt, rage, or release
I'm the one
If you're looking for tragedy
I'm the one
If you wanna see insanity
I'm the one (I'm the one)
I'm the one (I'm the one)
I'm the one
I'm the one, I'm the one
I'm the one, I'm the one
