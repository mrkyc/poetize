Yeah!

Ya see I left my soul
By the side of the road
Somewhere down in Texas
Where the minister spoke
Said, "Boy, ya better find God
'Cause you're destined for sin"
So I did a shot and smiled
With a black-tooth grin

Whatever you say
Whatever you think
Cowboy, hillbilly, whatever you say
We love 'em and leave 'em
It's just a cowboy's way
Outlaw or redneck, whatever you think
What's mine is mine, what's yours is mine
It's just a cowboy's way

Yeah!

Ya see I sold my soul
At the cross in the road
Somewhere down in Texas
Where the devil had spoke
Said, "Boy, you wanna be somebody
Sign on the line"
I said, "I gotta raise some hell
So I ain't got the time"

Whatever you say
Whatever you think
Cowboy, hillbilly, whatever you say
We love 'em and leave 'em
It's just a cowboy's way
Outlaw or redneck, whatever you think
What's mine is mine, what's yours is mine
It's just a cowboy's way

Yeah!

It's just a cowboy's
It's just a cowboy's
It's just a cowboy's way
Reckless and worthless
Ya can't understand
Ain't got no reason to give a fuck
Just don't give a damn, no


It's just a cowboy's
It's just a cowboy's
It's just a cowboy's way

Cowboy, hillbilly, whatever you say
We love 'em and leave 'em
It's just a cowboy's way
Outlaw or redneck, whatever you think
What's mine is mine, what's yours is mine
Just a cowboy's way
