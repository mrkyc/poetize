It's always been as good as gone
It never had a chance, not even right from the start
Even if it had a shot in the dark
It was still just a fireplug without a spark
I think it's had about all it can take
They'll make goddamn sure of it, so make no mistake
Just put another stitch in the scar
It's just another broken dream from a burnt-out star

It's you, it's me
Fuck it, fuck me!

Hard-rockin', 12-gauge
Charge, punch, full of rage
Pay back, it owes pain
Bruise, scar, maul, maim
For all the hell it's been through
This is a gift for all of you
Hard as nails, fight, thrash
Slam, brawl, skulls collapse
Broken soul, this is the end
So, fuck it all, it's over it
For all the hell you put it through
This is a gift to all of you
You might also like
So tired, so sick of it all
It tried to break free, but then they put up a wall
It was too washed up, too fat and too old
It had a hard existence, and it's taken its toll
Tried to make a difference, but the destiny failed
It climbed the stairway to heaven just to end up in hell
You can't see the light when you live in the dark
Another broken-winged angel with a broken heart

It's you, it's me
Fuck it, fuck me!

Hard-rockin', 12-gauge
Charge, punch, full of rage
Pay back, it owes pain
Bruise, scar, maul, maim
For all the hell it's been through
This is a gift for all of you
Hard as nails, fight, thrash
Slam, brawl, skulls collapse
Broken soul, this is the end
So, fuck it all, it's over it
For all the hell you put it through
This is a gift to all of you
Square peg, round hole
Don't matter if you fit
Your life is what you make it
Split lip, black eye
Don't matter how it looks
It just matters how you wear it!


It's you, it's me
Fuck it, fuck me!
