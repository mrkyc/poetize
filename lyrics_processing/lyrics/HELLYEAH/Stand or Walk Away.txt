I was told that life is beautiful
Well, I'm not looking through those eyes
Wished upon a star and watched it fall away
Well, that's just one more thing
That could never be forever
Everything I touch turns to the opposite of gold
It could be shit, it could be coal
That's just the way it goes
Do I lead them astray?
Do I push them all away?
I feel so cold
From the exit of my soul, oh

Don't know whether I should kill or cry
Don't know if I should live or die
Should I stand or walk away?
Don't know whether I should be myself or change
Hold my ground or rearrange
Should I stand or walk away?

I've been told that we live and learn
As I look through tear-soaked eyes
I'm full of scars, but I'm not made of stone
And my heart's exposed
My transparent life of terror
A sacred promise that's sealed by a ring of gold
It can't be bought, it can't be sold
But you have to keep a hold
Did I throw it away
Because of my ways?
It feels so cold
Now that I have lost my soul
You might also like
Don't know whether I should kill or cry
Don't know if I should live or die
Should I stand or walk away?
Don't know whether I should be myself or change
Hold my ground or rearrange
Should I stand or walk away?

My stomach aches as I feel the sting
That runs through me
Lay my head into my hands
Falling to the ground
I look up to the sky
Please help me find my way back home
