Be undeniable
Be undeniable

Nobody else can do it
Like a hellion can do it
I make it a point to exclaim
And I'm here to prove it
Straight out of a gutter
Broken, poor, and abused
I'm a son-of-a-bitchin' mess
But I ain't gonna lose

Go ahead and call me insane
Never ever crossed my mind
To be conventional
Don't know why I'm built this way
I'm a little bit of a mess
But I've never been a criminal

Pushed out, pushed down, pushed around
I'm in, I'm ready to fight
Stand up, stand out, stand my ground
I'm out, I'm dropping the mic
You might also like
Be undeniable
Middle fingers are up because I got 'em
If you're tired of being denied
Be undeniable and dot your eyes on the bottom!
Be undeniable
I'm coming in hot and full throttle
When you're tired of being denied
Be undeniable and dot your eyes on the bottom!

Be undeniable

I'm outta my fucking mind
And that's all there is to it
You better get me on a stage
Because I'm about to lose it
Pressure's building up
Like a blast from a gun
You can stick a fork in me
Because I'm over it, done

Gonna live my life way
It's just who I am
It's how I'm gonna do what I do
I'll go ahead and take the blame
I've got a bad attitude
And I'm thinkin' I got a screw loose
Pushed out, pushed down, pushed around
I'm in, I'm ready to fight
Stand up, stand out, stand my ground
I'm out, I'm dropping the mic

Be undeniable
Middle fingers are up because I got 'em
If you're tired of being denied
Be undeniable and dot your eyes on the bottom!
Be undeniable
I'm coming in hot and full throttle
When you're tired of being denied
Be undeniable and dot your eyes on the bottom!
Be undeniable

You don't want it, ya just take it
You gotta want it, you've gotta just
Be undeniable
You don't want it, ya just take it
You gotta want it, you've gotta just
Be undeniable
You don't want it, ya just take it
You gotta want it, you've gotta just
Be undeniable
You don't want it, ya just take it
You gotta want it, you've gotta just
Be undeniable
I'll dot your eyes, I've got a problem
Middle fingers are up because I got 'em
If you're tired of being denied
Be undeniable and dot your eyes on the bottom
Be undeniable
I'm coming in hot and full throttle
When you're tired of being denied
Be undeniable and dot your eyes on the bottom
When you're tired of being denied
Be undeniable and dot your eyes on the bottom

You want it? You want it? You take it!
You want it? You want it? You want it?
You take it!
