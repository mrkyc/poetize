Sangre por sangre, blood for blood
Sangre por sangre, blood for blood
Sangre por sangre, blood for blood
Sangre por sangre, blood for blood

Betraying a trust is a must in your mind
The agenda is just business as usual
Remember the embers from the fires they light
Cities smolder with the innocent victims
Democracy is hypocrisy; dictatorship is what we need
Because, really, what's the fucking difference?
So, come on in and take a seat
And listen to the lies they love to preach
Because the truth would just be fucking senseless

Eye for an eye
And blood for blood
Ya better get your guns (Blood for blood)
For every action, reaction
And death is a business
Eye for an eye
And blood for blood
You better grab your guns (Blood for blood)
Can't take it back
What's done is done
I want blood for blood
You might also like
Ashes to ashes and dust to the death of
What we were to what we've become
I'll put my faith into our heroes
That fight for our lives until the war is won
Dishonesty is giving me anxiety; it's my disease
But the privileged, they've got it made
So, raise your glass to the one percent
That have it all, keep me in the shit
And send me into screaming fits of fucking rage

Eye for an eye
And blood for blood
Ya better get your guns (Blood for blood)
For every action, reaction
And death is a business
Eye for an eye
And blood for blood
You better grab your guns (Blood for blood)
Can't take it back
What's done is done
I want blood for blood

Quarter oppressors
It's too late for surrender
It's time to pay your penance
All together, forever
This spinning web of deception
Lies begin to constrict
The walls of fate
Suffocate and seal around you
Brick by brick

Eye for an eye
And blood for blood
Ya better get your guns (Blood for blood)
For every action, reaction
And death is a business
Eye for an eye
And blood for blood
You better grab your guns (Blood for blood)
Can't take it back
What's done is done
I want blood for blood

Sangre por sangre!
Blood for blood!
Sangre por sangre!
