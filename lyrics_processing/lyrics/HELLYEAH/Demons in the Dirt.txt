I'm pro-pain and I'm pro-rage
So, fuck everything when I'm on the stage
I live to be pro-everything that you're against
I drink like I bleed, I smoke the weed
I partied like a pro since I was a seed
Fuck the normalcy; I'll do it till I'm dead
If I'm in a rut, down on my luck
Punch you in the face, take your money away
Because I'm insane, and I just couldn't give a fuck!
Break all your shit and laugh in your face
When you're in a place and you need my aid
So selfish that I'll kill myself for fun

Put my demons in the dirt (Down, done)
In the dirt dead
Demons in the dirt (Down, done)
Fucking buried
Demons in the dirt (Down, done)
In the dirt dead
When I'm dead and done (In the dirt)
Fucking buried

You can be pro-life, but I'm pro-death
And I'll be that way till my last breath
Wasn't who I was, but it's just who I've become
I just grit my teeth as I start to seethe
All the motherfucking people that I can't believe
I don't feel complete unless I'm spilling blood
You might also likeIt's just a game that I love to play
When you make a mistake and miscalculate
Then you break your leg
I gotta laugh; I'm fucking nuts
I've got no respect for a world that's wrecked
And I won't accept all its defect
It's all over, finished, ruined, fucking done!

Put my demons in the dirt (Down, done)
In the dirt dead
Demons in the dirt (Down, done)
Fucking buried
Demons in the dirt (Down, done)
In the dirt dead
When I'm dead and done (In the dirt)
Fucking buried

Demons in the dirt
When I'm dead and buried
Put my demons in the dirt
When I'm done
The demons in the dirt
When I'm dead and gone
Put my demons in the dirt
I'm pro-rage!
I love to hate
I've got no respect
Fuck my fate
I've got no regrets
There's no remorse
For my recourse
When the world's in my way
I feel the weight and bring the hate


Put my demons in the dirt (Down, done)
In the dirt dead
Demons in the dirt (Down, done)
Fucking buried
Demons in the dirt (Down, done)
In the dirt dead
When I'm dead and done (In the dirt)
Fucking buried
Demons in the dirt
When I'm dead and buried
Put my demons in the dirt (Down, done)
When I'm done
The demons in the dirt
When I'm dead and gone
Put my demons in the dirt (Down, done)
I'm pro-rage!
When I'm dead and done in the dirt
Fucking buried
The demons in the dirt
