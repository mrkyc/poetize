I just wanted to write this note
To all my opposition
To say thank you from the pit of my soul
For your caustic inspiration
My methods may mean nothing to you
As you question my dedication
But to wear my life upon my sleeve
Is the source of my salvation

Hostility, brutality
Is building up inside of me
I'm raging like a fire as I burn
I give myself to all of you
No matter what you say or do
But I'm expecting nothing in return
Disgrace me or embrace me
You can choose to love or hate me
Better fucking know I've got something to say
You masticate and spit me out
You pick me up and knock me down
No matter what, I'll always be the prey

I'm exposed
X, X
Heart open wide
X, X
So, mark the "X" on me
Stab thorns into my eyes
You might also likeBare my soul
X, X
Transparent life
X, X
So, mark the "X" on me
Stab spears into my side

I just wanna say these words
To those who give respect:
Let's lose our minds
Tear the walls down
And break some fucking necks!

I've fought the fight every day
I won a few and gave some away
But still, I'm gonna spill my share of blood
This little game's a little old
A little late, I've sold my soul
A martyr, but I'm not the only one
Family don't mean shit to me
The wind has blown away the seed
Got a father, but I've never been a son
We live to die, all for one
Lean on each other, carry on
My metal family till the day I'm done
I'm exposed
X, X
Heart open wide
X, X
So, mark the "X" on me
Stab thorns into my eyes
Bare my soul
X, X
Transparent life
X, X
So, mark the "X" on me
Stab spears into my side


Say what you want
Write what you want
But we stand proud on this stage
We're built to mosh
We're built to slam
We're built to fucking rage
Born and bred a metalhead
And that's the end of this
And if you've got a problem
Sorry, but I don't give a shit
I'm exposed
X, X
Heart open wide
X, X
So, mark the "X" on me
Stab thorns into my eyes
Bare my soul
X, X
Transparent life
X, X
So, mark the "X" on me
Stab spears into my side

Mark the "X"
Mark the "X"
Mark the "X"
Mark the "X"

Stab your spear into my side!
X, X
Stab your spear into my side!
X, X
Stab your spear
X, X
Into my side!
