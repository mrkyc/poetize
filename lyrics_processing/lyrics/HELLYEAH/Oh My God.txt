The little boy in me that was wild with fright
Nobody came to my rescue when I called out that night
So many times, so many tries, so many cries for help in life
But it's too late now

Oh my God
I made a deal with the Devil, now the Devil's in my blood
I'm the bullet, he's the gun
Now the target's on your back, and here I come
I'm the bullet, he's the gun
I made a deal with the Devil, now the Devil's in my blood
I'm the bullet, he's the gun
Now the target's on your back, and you're so fucked
'Cause I'm the bullet, and he's the gun

The struggle is real (It's so real)
My condition's critical in life, was I born to suffer 'til I die?
Darkness consumes me (It consumes me)
Draw the shades and stitch my eyes, watch my sanity unwind

I've been drained of compassion
My finger's up, fuck the masses

Oh my God

I'm the bullet, he's the gun
Now the target's on your back, and here I come
I'm the bullet, he's the gun
I made a deal with the Devil, now the Devil's in my blood
I'm the bullet, he's the gun
Now the target's on your back, and you're so fucked
'Cause I'm the bullet, and he's the gun

My hands off the wheel (Hands off the wheel)
Your process is complete, destroyed what matters most to me
The burden holds me (Holds on to me)
I'm just a product of my past, I'm like a book with one last match

I've been drained of compassion
My finger's up, fuck the masses

Oh my God
I made a deal with the Devil, now the Devil's in my blood
I'm the bullet, he's the gun

I've been drained of compassion
My finger's up, fuck the masses

Oh my God
I made a deal with the Devil, now the Devil's in my blood
I'm the bullet, he's the gun
Now the target's on your back, and here I come
I'm the bullet, he's the gun

I'm the bullet, he's the gun
Now the target's on your back, and you're so fucked
