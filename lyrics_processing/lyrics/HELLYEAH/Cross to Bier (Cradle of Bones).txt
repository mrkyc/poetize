I'm suicidal and maniacal
To make it this far's a miracle
I wouldn't wish upon my worst enemy
From the succubus to the incubus
From the nonbelievers to the bottom-feeders
Their crosshairs focused tightly on me

They all want a little piece of me
A little tiny piece of me
Just take it all and leave me alone
Just throw me on the pyre
Gas it up and light that shit on fire
And let me burn inside of my hallowed soul

So lyrical it's criminal
So criminal I'm institutional
So institutional that I'll never escape
So, I pray the Lord my soul to keep

(Tear me off)
Tear me off my cross to bier
In my coffin so cold
(Take me off)
Take me from this cross I bear
In my cradle of bones
You might also like
I'm irrational and piratical
Got no patience for satirical
Fucking idiots that always strap me
I've got no trust, I'm here to bust
All the deceivers and the fucking cheaters
My sympathy tank: bone-dry, on empty

They'll take what they can get
They'll take every little bit
Everything that I hold dear to me
So, fuck 'em all, the liars
String 'em up and light that shit on fire
Then we cut 'em down and bury 'em deep

So lyrical it's criminal
So criminal I'm institutional
So institutional that I swallowed the key
And I pray the Lord my soul to keep

(Tear me off)
Tear me off my cross to bier
In my coffin so cold
(Take me off)
Take me from this cross I bear
In my cradle of bones
I'm always the one
High in the treetop
Life's hurricanes blow
But my will is a rock
So, when the bough breaks
And it all falls apart
Just carve your initials
In my blackened heart


Carve your initials
In my blackened heart

So lyrical it's criminal
So criminal I'm institutional
So institutional that I'll never escape
So let me go for Jesus' sake

(Tear me off)
Tear me off my cross to bier
In my coffin so cold
Take me from this cross I bear
In my cradle of bones
(Take me off)
Rip me off my cross to bear
Buried in a shallow hole
(Take me off)
Take me from this cross I bear
