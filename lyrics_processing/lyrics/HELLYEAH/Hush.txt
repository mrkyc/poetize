You pray for quiet
But inside your head
The screams won't silence
I remember those days
The terror that's the home
The fear that's in your bones
It just won't go away, no

The strangleholds
The insulting names
The wound-up shirt around his fist
The nose-to-nose, beer-stinking breath
Thrown down onto the floor
So battered, bruised, and sore
Choked down onto the bed
And thrash until you break your neck

Hell's where I was born
Hell's where I was raised
This hell is where I'm from
And this hell is where I'll stay
The hush is all I need
To hush the misery
The hush that belongs to me
Like the hush inside a dream
Just be still and pray
And let the noise just fade away
You might also like
Retain the violence
Locks up your heart like a secret closet
So no one can penetrate
Just can't stand the touch
Affection weighs too much
You push everyone away
From...

The reckoning
The venom stings
Whipped so bad I pissed myself
Still wear the beatings from that belt
If this reminds you of home
You better know you're not alone
Hold a gun up to my head
And I'll pull the trigger on myself

Hell's where I was born
Hell's where I was raised
This hell is where I'm from
And this hell is where I'll stay
The hush is all I need
To hush the misery
The hush that belongs to me
Like the hush inside a dream
Just be still and pray
These are the memories in me
You didn't wanna know
You didn't wanna know
These are the memories we keep
We don't wanna show
We don't wanna show
But now at least you know...
You're not alone!

Hush is all I need
To hush the misery
The hush belongs to me
Like the hush inside a dream

Hell's where I was born
Hell's where I was raised
This hell is where I'm from
And this hell is where I'll stay
The hush is all I need
To hush the misery
The hush that belongs to me
Like the hush inside a dream
Just be still and pray
