Dear black December
I'm writing you this eulogy
I don't want to remember
All I wanna do is forget
'Tis the season of giving
But you harvest souls from me
No reason for living
Because your curse ain't over yet

If I had a dime
For every tear I've cried

All you've ever done is
Take my muse, take my dreams
All you ever do is
Tear me up, break my wings
I offer my surrender
Cold, cruel December
Just keeps on keeping on
I'm on the dark side of the dawn
Just waiting for the end
Of black December

Coal-black December

Dear black December
Your cold is strangling me
Stockings stuffed with cinders
So, you can add to my distress
'Tis the season of darkness
So, you can keep everything
Your super sales and the silly trees
For the fa-la-la-la idiots

If I had a dime
For every tear I've cried

All you've ever done is
Take my muse, take my dreams
All you ever do is
Tear me up, break my wings
I offer my surrender
Cold, cruel December
Just keeps on keeping on
I'm on the dark side of the dawn
Just waiting for the end
Of black December
Coal-black December
Coal-black December
Black December

Oh, please help me
Please help me get away
Oh, please help me
Through these black December days

There is no light
Inside the black
Forge ahead
No turning back (December...)
December's teeth
December's mad
December's cruel
December's black

All you've ever done is
Take my muse, take my dreams
All you ever do is
Tear me up, break my wings
I offer my surrender
Cold, cruel December
Just keeps on keeping on
I'm on the dark side of the dawn
Just waiting for the end
Of black December
Coal-black December

All you ever do is
