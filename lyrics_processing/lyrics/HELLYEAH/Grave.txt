It's just another day
In a mind of the insane
Death is creeping in again
Storms of hail and rain
Can I hold on another day
In the mind that's full of rage?
Feels like I'm losing grip
On the existence that is my bane

My reality is slipping
My hand's on the gun and gripping
Depression blankets me
Entombs and threatens my existence
So many times, I've lost my mind
Held on too much, but not this time
My selfishness embracing
So, I let go of resistance

Fuck you all that try to talk
Your sense to me, I don't belong
Just leave me be
This dead man's on the ledge
Your sympathy don't mean shit to me
So, fuck this life; I'm sharpening
The blade that is
The conduit to my end
You might also like
One foot in the gutter
One foot in grave
One foot for revenge
And one for being betrayed
One foot for denial
One foot for lost faith
One foot in the gutter
One foot in the grave

The rope around my neck is gripping
The stool under feet is slipping
To purge me of the pressure
And the hell that's been my life
Too many times, I lost my sight
I've chose this battle but refuse to fight
Today's my day of reckoning
So, let the fuse ignite

Fuck you all that try to talk
Your sense to me, I don't belong
Just leave me be
This dead man's on the ledge
Your sympathy don't mean shit to me
So, fuck this life; I'm sharpening
The blade that is
The conduit to my end
One foot in the gutter
One foot in grave
One foot for revenge
And one for being betrayed
One foot for denial
One foot for lost faith
One foot in the gutter
One foot in the grave

I took that final step
At last, without regret
This gift I wouldn't sell
My heaven is your hell
Everything is dark
Everything is light
Angels fly to heaven
As demons fall to night
This darkness I caress
Blows warm air upon my neck
As I embrace my death
No more panic, no distress
This life cannot be saved
This life I lost today
I had one foot in the gutter
Now both are in the grave
