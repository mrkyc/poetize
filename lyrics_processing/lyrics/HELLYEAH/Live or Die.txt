Honesty or a lie
Violence or reason
Do we live life or die?
Love or hate
Worship or deny
Pleasure or pain
Do we live life or die?

It's time for a decision
And you have to make a choice
You can take a vow of silence
Or raise your fucking voice
A warrior or a coward
That's on you as a man
I choose to fight and riot
I'm a lion, not a lamb!

Get up, lay down or fight!
Stand up, live life or die!

Honesty or a lie
Violence or reason

Significant or indifferent
Companion or a pest
Or contemplate for eternity
Inside your loneliness
I choose to be extreme
But that's just who I am
Fuck the choice to play it safe
I live my life all in!

Get up, lay down or fight!
Stand up, live life or die!

Die, die, die, die?

Outlaw, old school
I stand here on this stage
True grit, no bullshit
Say it to your face
The new way, bedroom
Fearless and two-faced
Pseudo-backbone
But you've got nothing to say
Get up, lay down or fight!
Stand up, live life or die!
