I've been cast out, sequestered
Pushed the fuck around
Blindsided, beaten
Locked up and bound
Always thought I was human
But maybe I was wrong
I've been treated like an animal
Since the day I was born

The wounds that I wear
Are like the crown upon a king
So heavy they lie
With all the pain that they bring
My life is full of longing
But for what, I'll never know
I've been drawn into the fire
As you reap what I sow

Like a moth to a flame
My wings burn away
When things are too beautiful
I smash them to pieces
The more that you love me
Insecurity releases
I'll be the one that's to blame
So, I'll sell my soul to a blaze
You might also like
Like a moth to a flame
Like a moth to a flame

The ruler of the kingdom
That ends up the pawn
So tired of thinking of
Where it all went wrong
Friendships, they come and go
And sometimes, they end
Wouldn't dream in a million years
That this would be one of them

Faith in the life
Belief to the end
Failure's not an option
But the options exist
I gave up my everything
I give till I bleed
Take it all, take everything
Just take it from me

Like a moth to a flame
My wings burn away
When things are too beautiful
I smash them to pieces
The more that you love me
Insecurity releases
I'll be the one that's to blame
So, I'll sell my soul to a blaze
You're pushing me, I'm pushing back
Falling down, my heart attacks
Compassion is lost
No more hope, no more trust
I tore it down and burnt it up
All faith is gone

Respect, devotion, dead!
Disgust, hate, lies!


I'm not a hero or a villain
Not a god, I'm just a man
Staring through the hourglass
At the footprints in the sand
I'm stripping off my armor
My battles here are done
Wave my white flag to surrender
And fly into the sun

Like a moth to a flame
My wings burn away
When things are too beautiful
I smash them to pieces
The more that you love me
Insecurity releases
I'll be the one that's to blame
So, I'll sell my soul to a blaze
Like a moth to a flame
Moth to a flame
Moth to a flame
