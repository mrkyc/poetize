You put the, you put the, you put the, you put the
You put the boy in the box, motherfucker
Then you nailed down the top and you locked it
You threw away the key like you threw away me
Confined to a life with no others
You put the boy in the box, motherfucker
It said "handle with care" but you dropped it
Isolation therapy, that's what created me
Locked in, left out and broke my mother

Beat him until he bleeds, beat him until he pleads
Beat him until his bones break, then we'll give him one more
Get him outta the way, get him outta our sight
Get him outta our life, just keep him in the junk drawer
Preying upon his mind, just a matter of time
Making his head a mess, that's how we're gonna do it
Keep him locked up, keep him fucked up
Gonna make for damn sure he'll never get through it

You put the, you put the, you put the
You put the boy in the box, motherfucker
Then you nailed down the top and you locked it
You threw away the key like you threw away me
Confined to a life with no others
You put the boy in the box, motherfucker
It said "handle with care" but you dropped it
Isolation therapy, that's what created me
Locked in, left out and broke my mother
You might also like
Trapped inside my life, praying that I could die
Digging out my eyes and I couldn't get a witness
How can you be inspired? A crime against your child
Throw you in the fire and cleanse you of your sickness
Making a fucking stand, you got to be a man
Gotta believe you can and now it's time to prove it
Taking it back now, taking it right now
Be an animal, just take the pain and use it

You put the, you put the, you put the, you put the
You put the boy in the box, motherfucker
Then you nailed down the top and you locked it
You threw away the key like you threw away me
Confined to a life with no others
You put the boy in the box, motherfucker
It said "handle with care" but you dropped it
Isolation therapy, that's what created me
Locked in, left out and broke my mother

You can't keep me locked up
You can't keep me fucked up
You can't keep me cuffed up
'Cause I'm the boy in the box
You can't keep me locked up
You can't keep me fucked up
You can't keep me cuffed up
'Cause I'm the boy in the box
You can't keep me locked up
You can't keep me fucked up
You can't keep me cuffed up
'Cause I'm the boy in the box
You can't keep me locked up
You can't keep me fucked up
You can't keep me cuffed up
'Cause I'm the boy in the box
You put the, you put the, you put the
You put the boy in the box, motherfucker
Then you nailed down the top and you locked it
You threw away the key like you threw away me
Confined to a life with no others
You put the boy in the box, motherfucker
It said "handle with care" but you dropped it
Isolation therapy, that's what created me
Locked in, left out and broke my mother

You put the, you put the
