It was a one-in-a-million chance, the way that we met
Now I can't seem to get his smile out of my head
All that tall, dark and handsome African-ess
This morning, I caught myself wondering
If he was too tall for my bed

Oh, now you've got me talking on the phone
Oh, now you've got me writing new songs
What the hell's going on?
I'm doing way too much, that's how I know

I'm in good, good trouble with you
I'm in good, good trouble with you
Just when the winter started getting cold
You came along and you warmed up my bones
I'm in good, good trouble with you

I love to leave my lipstick all over your face
I love to sit around and talk to you
About music all day and every day
Oh, your kiss is the cure to a thousand lonely nights
This morning, I caught myself wondering
How your hands would fit on my thighs
You might also like
Oh, now you've got me talking on the phone
You've got me writing new songs
What the hell's going on?
I'm doing way too much, that's how I know

I'm in good, good trouble with you, yeah
I'm in good, good trouble with you
Just when the winter started getting cold
You came along and you warmed up my bones
I'm in good, good trouble with you

I could feel it the moment we met
And it gets better and better for real
I could feel it the moment we touched
That's how I know this is the real deal
And what if this goes alright?
I know it's kind of crazy to say
But now, you got me thinking that way
What if this goes our way?
I'm doing way too much
I'm doing way too much

I'm in good trouble with you
I'm in good trouble with you
This morning, I caught myself wondering
What it would it be like if we shared a place
I'm doing way too much
We have only known each other for seven days

I'm in good trouble with you
