Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Oh...

I got the call today, I didn't wanna hear
But I knew that it would come
An old true friend of ours was talkin' on the phone
She said you found someone
And I thought of all the bad luck
And all the struggles we went through
How I lost me and you lost you
What are all these voices outside love's open door?
Make us throw off our contentment
And beg for something more

I've been learning to live without you now
But I miss you sometimes
The more I know, the less I understand
All the things I thought I knew, I'm learning them again

I've been tryin' to get down to the heart of the matter
But my will gets weak
And my thoughts seem to scatter
But I think it's about forgiveness, forgiveness
Even if, even if you don't love me anymore
You might also like
These times are so uncertain
There's a yearning undefined
And people filled with rage
We all need a little tenderness
How can love survive in such a graceless age?
And the trust and self-assurance that lead to happiness
Are the very things we kill, I guess
Pride and competition cannot fill these empty arms
And the wall they put between us
You know it doesn't keep us warm

I've been trying to live without you now
But I miss you, baby
The more I know, the less I understand
And all the things I thought I'd figured out, I have to learn again

I've been tryin' to get down to the heart of the matter
But my will gets weak
And my heart is so shattered
But I think it's about forgiveness, forgiveness
Even if, even if you don't love me anymore

Oh, there are people in your life who've come and gone
They let you down (Oh), you know they hurt your pride (Oh)
Gotta put it all behind you, 'cause life goes on (Oh)
You can't carry that anger, it'll eat you up inside
I want a happily ever after
And my heart is so shattered
But I know it's about forgiveness, forgiveness
Even if, even if you don't love me
I've been tryin' to get down to the heart of the matter
Because the flesh gets weak
And the ashes will scatter
So I'm thinkin' about forgiveness, forgiveness
Even if you don't love me anymore
