When you talk to her talk to her
Like you want somebody to talk to your mama
Don't get smart with her have a heart to heart with her
Just like you would with your daughter
'Cause everything you do or say
You gotta live with it everyday
She's somebody's baby
She's somebody's sister
She's somebody's mama

Now when you go to her, speak truthfully
Be honest as you can be, from your heart
You're in a situation, where you're losing patience
Take your time and look her in the eye
When you just can't find the words you want
And it's hard to reach a point
Where you both can understand
Don't just tell the truth, but tell the whole truth
It'll make a better man outta you

When you talk to her talk to her
Like you want somebody to talk to your mama
Don't get smart with her have a heart to heart with her
Just like you would with your daughter
'Cause everything you do or say
You gotta live with it everyday
She's somebody's baby
She's somebody's sister
She's somebody's mama

It doesn't matter if she's wearing
A mini skirt or a business suit
Whether she's 25 or 99
Treat her the way your mama taught you to
She could be the Queen of Sheba
She could be a school teacher
A home maker or a lawyer
I think it's good for your Karma
If...

When you talk to her talk to her
Like you want somebody to talk to your mama
Don't get smart with her have a heart to heart with her
Just like you would with your daughter
'Cause everything you do or say
You gotta live with it everyday
She's somebody's baby
She's somebody's sister
She's somebody's mama

Now let's keep it real
Nothing in this world could ever exist
Without it's opposite
There has to be a sun and moon
A man and a woman
And that's just the way it is
Humanity's lopsided
And everyone's fighting
How do we restore the peace?
Mother earth is hurtin'
'Cause everyone is searchin'
For the feminine energy
You got to talk to her...
When you talk to her talk to her
Like you want somebody to talk to your mama
Don't get smart with her have a heart to heart with her
Just like you would with your daughter
'Cause everything you do or say
You gotta live with it everyday
She's somebody's baby
She's somebody's sister
She's somebody's mama

When you talk to her talk to her
Like you want somebody to talk to your mama
Just like you fight for your sister
If you knew that somebody dissed her
How you gonna care for your daughter
Turn around and talk bad about her mama?
Same way you listen to your auntie
Never interrupt while she speaks
Make your words sweet like candy
As if you were talking to your granny yeah
