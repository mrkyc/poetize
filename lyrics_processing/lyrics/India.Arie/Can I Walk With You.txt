I woke up this morning you were the first thing on my mind
I don't know where it came from all I know is I need you in my life
You make me feel like I can be a better woman
If you just say you wanna take this friendship to another place

Can I walk with you through your life?
Can I lay with you as your wife?
Can I be your friend till the end?
Can I walk with you through your life?

You've got me wondering if you know that I am wondering about you
The feeling is so strong that I can't imagine you're not feeling it too
You've known me long enough to trust that I want what's best for you
If you wanna be happy then I am the one that you should give your heart to

Can I walk with you through your life?
Can I lay with you as your wife?
Can I be your friend till the end?
Can I walk with you through your life?

Now everyday ain't gonna be, like the summer's day
Being in love for real it ain't like a movie screen
But I can tell you all the drama aside you and I can find what the worlds been
Looking for forever friendship and love together

Can I lay with you as your wife?
Can I be your friend till the end?
Can I walk with you through your life?

Can I walk with you through your life till the day that the world stops turning
Can I walk with you till the day that my heart stops beating
Can I walk with you through your life
Can I walk with you till the end that the birds no longer take flight till the moon is underwater
Can I walk with you?
Can I walk with you?
This is the moment I've been waiting for
Can I walk with you?
Can I walk with you?
Can I walk with you?
You are everything I've been looking for
Can I walk with you
Creative intellectual too
Can I walk with you? through your life..
