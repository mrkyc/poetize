Ahem
Here we go
Oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh

Inside my head, there lives a dream
That I wanna see in the sun
Behind my eyes, there lives a me
That I've been hiding for much too long
'Cause I've been too afraid to let it show
'Cause I'm scared of the judgment that may follow
Always putting off my living for tomorrow

It's time to step out on faith
I've gotta show my face
It's been elusive for so long
But freedom is mine today
I've gotta step out on faith
It's time to show my face
Procrastination had me down
Look what I have found, I found
You might also like
Strength, courage, and wisdom
It's been inside of me all along
Strength, courage, and wisdom
Inside of me

Behind my pride, there lives a me
That knows humility
Inside my voice, there is a soul
And in my soul, there is a voice
But I've been too afraid to make a choice
'Cause I'm scared of the things that I might be missing
Running too fast to stop to listen

It's time to step out on faith
I've gotta show my face
It's been elusive for so long
Freedom is mine today
Step out on faith
It's time to show my face
Procrastination had me down
Look what I have found, I found

Strength, courage, and wisdom
It's been inside of me all along
Strength, courage, and wisdom
Inside of me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh-oh, oh-oh

I close my eyes and I think of all the things
That I wanna see
'Cause I know now that I've opened up my heart, I know that
Anything I want can be
So let it be (So let it be)
So let it be (So let it be)
So let it be (So let it be)
So let it be (So let it be)

Strength, courage, and wisdom
It's been inside of me all along
Strength, courage, and wisdom
It's been inside of me all along, now every day I'm praying for
Strength, courage, and wisdom
To find, yeah, yeah, oh-oh
Strength, courage, and wisdom
Inside of me

Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I found it in me and I found it finally (And I found it)
And I'm sure to keep it 'cause I like it, so I say thank you
I found it, oh, oh
I found it, hey, hey
