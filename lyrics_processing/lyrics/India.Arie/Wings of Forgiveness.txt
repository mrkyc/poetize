I just want you to know
After everything that we've been through
I just want you to know
That I still love you
That I still love you:

Had to go across the water
Just to find what was here in my heart all along
Spend so much time trying to be right
That I was dead wrong
If Nelson Mandela can forgive his oppressor
Surely I can forgive you for your passion

You're only human
Let's shake free this gravity of resentment
And fly high, and fly high
You're only human
Let's shake free this gravity of judgment
And fly high on the wings of forgiveness

Had to run to the arms of curiosity
Just to find what was here in my life all along
I had found that the art of simplicity
Simply means making peace of your complexity
If Gandhi can forgive persecution
Surely you can forgive me for being so petty
You might also like
I'm only human
Let's shake free this gravity of resentment
And fly high, and fly high
You're only human
Let's shake free this gravity of judgment
And fly high on the wings of forgiveness

I've searched for romance, flowers and affection
What I found is a lesson of what love really is
Found the game of love is about how much you can take
That authentic love is about how much you can give

After everything that we've been through
I just want you to know
That I still love you
I want you to know
That I forgive you
(thank you for teaching how to give)
And I wanna let you know how much you changed my life
I wanna let you know you taught me how to fly
And I wrote this song to tell you this
I'm better cuz you taught me how to give
I took a swim in the sea of guilt and misery
To find myself in an island
In the middle of nowhere
In my solitude I asked to know the highest truth
And what I was told Is to let own self be true
If Jesus can forgive crucifixion
Surely we can survive and find resolution

Let's keep it moving
Let's shake free this gravity of resentment
And fly high, and fly high
You're only human
Let's shake free this gravity of judgment
And fly high, and fly high
Let's keep it moving
Let's shake free this gravity of commitment
And fly high on the wings of forgiveness

After everything that we've been through
I just want you to know
That I still love you
I want you to know
That I still love you
And I wanna let you know how much you changed my life
I wanna let you know you taught me how to fly
And I wrote this song to tell you this
I'm better 'cos you taught me how to give
I still love you
I want you to know
I still love you
Want you to know
I still love you
(And I always will love you)
And I wanna let you know
I forgive you
I wanna let you know
That I still love you
Want you to know
I still love you
I just want you to know
I still love you
Want you to know
I still love you
Want you to know
I still love you
And I wanna let you know
I forgive you
I wanna let you know
