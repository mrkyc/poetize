Oh, oh, yeah

She is, 25
Spent over half of her life
So afraid to speak her mind
It's such a shame, 'cause oh, what a brilliant mind

She has, and now that she's been introduced to confidence
She doesn't see, that she is bordering on arrogance
When will she learn, to come back to the middle?
Oh

He is, a young black man
Grew up without his father
And now it falls into his hands
To protect his mother
'Cause if he doesn't, well then who will?
His older brother, he lives in fear
Of everything, especially
Tryna fill his father's shoes

Respectively, they go to extremes, of masculine and feminine
Chasing dreams, but they keep on falling, 'cause they don't know no balance
When will they learn, to come back to the middle?

You gotta take the good with the bad, and you might hit the wall
Sometimes you'll fly and sometimes you will fall
There ain't no way to avoid the pain
But it's getting burned, that's how you will learn
To come back to the middle
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Come back to the middle, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

Needing to protect yourself, now that is just a part of life
If you let your fears keep you from flying, you will never reach your height
To get to the top you must come back to the middle (Oh, oh, oh)
When will we learn, to come back to the middle?
When will we learn? Oh, oh, oh
Come back to the middle (Come back)
Come back to the middle (Come back)
Come back to the middle, yeah, yeah (Come back to the middle)
Don't make no mind about falling down
'Cause it's when you're in that valley
You can see both sides more clearly
Back to the middle (Come back)
Back to the middle (Come back)
Back to the middle (Come back to the middle)
Come back to the middle, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
(Come back to the middle) Yeah, yeah, yeah
(Come back) Yeah, yeah
(Come back) Yeah, yeah
