You're like a cool breeze, on a summer's day
You're always in my head, ooh
You're always in my head

You're like a cool breeze, on a summer's day
You are a river running through the desert plain
You are my shelter from the pouring rain
You were my comfort, even before the pain

I can hear the sound of five drummers in the wind
The leaves blowing in the breeze, ring out like guitars
A tin can rolls across the gravel like a tambourine
I am but a vessel, and so I sing because you are

In my head, you're always in my head
In my dreams, you're always in my head
In my pain, you're always in my head
In my peace, you're always in my head

A rainbow of a rhythm stretches across the sky
An airplane in the distance plays a beautiful cello line
It's no coincidence it's in tune with the music in my ears
If you were a shoulder, you're where I would rest, but I am your vessel so I hear you, you
You might also like
In my head, you're always in my head
In my fears, you're always in my head, ooh
In my joy, you're always in my head
In my tears, you're always in my head
You're always in my head

You're like a cool breeze, on a summer's day
You are a river running through the desert plain
You been my shelter from the pouring rain
You were my comfort, even before the pain
'Cause I hear you

In my head, you're always in my head
In my dreams, you're always in my head
In my pain, you're always in my head
In my peace, you're always in my head
You're always in my head, in my head, oh yeah
You're always in my head
In my fears, you're always in my head (Always in my head)
In my joy, you're always in my head
In my tears, you're always in my head, ooh (Always in my head)

How could I live a day without music?
How could I live one day without you?
How can I live a day without music?
You're always in my head
Oh, oh, oh
You are, you are love
You are, you are light
You are, you are joy
You are peace, you are peace
Now, you are me
