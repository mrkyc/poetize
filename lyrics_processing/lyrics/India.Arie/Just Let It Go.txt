You've been through so much
So many ups and downs
You've given your love
But never liked the way it turned out
You closed off your heart
And you carried the weight
Like a million rocks on your shoulders
But you don't have to wait for an apology
Or for someone else to make amends
When you can remember
That your healing is in your hands

Just let it go, inch by inch
Just let it go, and do it again
Just let it go, one day you'll see
Just let it go, you set yourself free

You've been used
You've been abused
Someone came along
Who didn't value you
You carried the weight
Of your heart
Like a million rocks on your shoulders
But life isn't meant to be perfect
And we won't always win
But can you remember
That your healing is in your hands?
You might also like
Just let it go, inch by inch
Just let it go, and do it again
Just let it go, one day you'll see
Just let it go, you set yourself free
Just let it go

Gave it your all
You put your blinders on
When you looked around
All of your friends were gone
You took the fall
And you carried the weight
Like a million rocks on your shoulders

Just let it go, inch by inch
Just let it go, and do it again
Just let it go, one day you'll see
Just let it go, you've set yourself free
Just let it go, and set yourself free
Just let it go, and set yourself free
Just let it go, and set yourself free
Let it go
Just let it go, and set yourself free
Your healing is in your hands
Just let it go, and it's all just so simple
Your healing is in your hands
Just let it go, and it's all just so simple
Your healing is in your hands
Just let it go, and it's all just so simple
Your healing is in your hands
