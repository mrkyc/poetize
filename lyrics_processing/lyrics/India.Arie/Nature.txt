I know, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Ooh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, yeah

Hey baby, why you rushing?
Let's sit back and watch the flowers grow
Why you want to swim against the tide?
Let's lay and watch the river flow
Here in God's creation
There is always a reason
I know, that love is there for us, yeah

Where we'll go, baby, I don't know
Maybe we should just let nature run the show
Where we'll go, baby, I don't know
Maybe we should just let nature run the show

I don't wanna watch no movie
Let's sit and watch the stars put on a show
If you wanna win my favor
Be creative, and show me your flavor
'Cause here in God's creation
For everything there is a season
Let go, let life, let love, let God

Where we'll go, baby, I don't know
Maybe we should just let nature run the show
Where we'll go, baby, I don't know
Maybe we should just let nature run the show

Like the sun shines and the wind blows
Like the birds fly and the moon glows
If I am meant for you and you are meant for me then
We will flow together everlastly

Where we'll go, baby, I don't know
Maybe we should just let nature run the show
Where we'll go, baby, I don't know (Oh, oh, oh)
Maybe we should just let nature run the show

Baby, we should sit, watch the flowers grow
Baby, we should sit, back and watch the moon glow
Baby, we should feel the wind blow
Maybe, maybe, maybe, yeah
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
First you plant a seed and then it grows and
Then it blooms, then it dies, that's the cycle of life
Same goes for you and I
Maybe this time we'll get it right, get it right (Go with the flow)
Go with the flow
Go with the flow
Go with the flow (Maybe we'll get it right, yeah)
Go with the flow
Go with the flow (Maybe we'll get it right, yeah)
Go with the flow
Go with the flow
Go with the flow
Oh, oh, oh
Go with the flow
Go with the flow
Go with the flow
Go with the flow
Go with the flow
Go with the flow
