Can you be a part of my life? (Hey, oh)
Can you be a part of my life? (Ooh)

Oh, it's easy to find someone to play with
And almost anyone will do to fill your idle time
But that very special someone you can share all your dreams with
Is so hard to find
But it used to be like me to settle for the physical
But these days it ain't too easy to make up my mind
'Cause apparently your body is just too temporary
To take up my precious time, but oh

See I've got to know that
That I can be free with you and
You've got to show that
That you're worthy of my time
Can you stimulate my mind?

And I know that it looks good
But can you be a part of my life?
And I'm sure that it feels good
But can you be a part of my life?
And it probably even tastes good
But can you be a part of my life?
I've got to know (I've got to know, oh)
You might also like
I still appreciate the beauty of a man
But there's more than what I need now than to meets the eye
And if beauty's only skin deep
Then your pretty skin won't send me to my highest high, oh
It's been a long time coming for maturity
And I believe that it's truly what it has to be
'Cause as much as I admire you
My sexual desire ain't controlling me, hey

See I've got to know that
That I can be free with you and
And you've got to show that
That you're worthy of my time
Can you stimulate my mind?

And I know that it looks good
But can you be a part of my life?
And I'm sure that it feels good
But can you be a part of my life?
And it probably even tastes good
But can you be a part of my life?
I've got to know (I've got to know, oh)
And I know that it looks good
But can you be a part of my life?
And I'm sure that it feels good
But can you be a part of my life?
And it probably even tastes good
But can you be a part of my life?
