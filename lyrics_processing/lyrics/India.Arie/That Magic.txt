He's got that magic
The way he touches me is so spiritual
He's so everything
He's a miracle

I've been searching all my life for someone like him
And all this time I thought that he was just a friend
But not just anybody can touch my body
And then he came along and he showed me
Pleasure like I've never known

He's got that magic (Ooh-ooh)
He's got that magic (Ooh-ooh)
He's got that magic
The way he touches me is so spiritual
He's so everything, he's a miracle, yeah
He's got that magic (Ooh-ooh)
He's got that magic (Ooh-ooh)
He's got that magic
The way he touches me is so spiritual
He's so everything, he's a miracle, yeah

Just a look at his face you would never know that he's the one
But after one conversation, you will see where I am coming from
His words are so gifted, his humor is so wicked
And he's a brainiac and he makes me laugh like an aphrodisiac

I never thought that I would find a man to open all my doors
In the instant he touched me, I knew what I'd been waiting for
It's like his hands and my body been friends before
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Every other man next to him is so mundane
In a world of cocaine, he's like fine champagne
And he's all so odd and so unique
Everything about this man is made especially for me
Yeah
