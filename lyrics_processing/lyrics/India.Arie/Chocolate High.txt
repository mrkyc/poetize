Ohhh, Ohhhh...
If we make each other happy then we just can't lose
I don't mean to be decadent
I might sound like a hedonist
But the simplest way I can put it
You've become a habit
The more I consume the more I gotta have it
Ain't no such thing as too much
If you gave me everything it'd never be enough, yeah
My black coffee with sugar no cream
In the morning you're my super caffeine dream, yeah
Musiq Soulchild:
Your precious darkness got me so strung out
The way that you got me so wide open my baby love
Jonesin' and fiendin' under my skin
My nerves are screamin' when you're not here
See, baby I need ya. Sugar you're so delicious
