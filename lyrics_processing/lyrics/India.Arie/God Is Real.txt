The largest planet to the smallest atom
Snowflakes and the bird kingdom
Smaller THAN the eye can see bigger than the mind can conceive
Heard a man on the radio today
(Spoken)I mean I'm not going to believe in anything that I can't see and I've
Been through a lot of hardships in my life ya know ya know in my life
Must confess I disagreed with what he had to say
How can he not believe that God is real
I don't understand how
He could feel that way
When there's earth, air, water, and fire
So many different flowers
Sunshine and rain showers
So many different crystals
ANT hills and volcanoes
Chorus
That's how I know that God is real
All of this is not by chance
That's how I know that God is real
All of this is not by chance
That's how I know that God is real
I know this is not by chance
That's how I know that God is real
That's how I know that God is real

(Spoken)It was like I was seeing it for the first time. It literally changed
My life
For the first time I understood its power
As I swam I was cleansed
If I had any doubts
This experience cleared them
Now I know for sure that GOd is real
I know that it's the truth
By the way it feels
Cause I saw starfish and sponges
Fish shaped like trumpets
So many different colors
I stayed out there for hours and I only saw a fraction of a fraction of the
Deepest of the deep of the great blue wide
It brought a tear to my eye
Chorus
That's how I know that God is real
All of this is not by chance
That's how I know that God is real
All of this is not by chance
That's how I know that God is real
I know this is not by chance
That's how I know that God is real
We're made of the same stuff
As the moon and the stars
The oceans saltwater just like my tears are
You feel me
The sunrises and sets everyday without fail
Chorus
That's how I know that God is real
All of this is not by chance
That's how I know that God is real
All of this is not by chance
That's how I know that God is real
I know this is not by chance
