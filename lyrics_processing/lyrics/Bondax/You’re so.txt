I'm the one that doesn't know anything
Like a magpie and a ring
I am always going to be looking right to you
Oh, you capture my attention
Carefully listening
Don't wanna miss a thing
Keeping my eyes on you
Got me on my toes
If I were to hideout on the sea
You'd be whispering from the westerlies
And any book I'll ever read
You'd be the line that sticks out to me
Out to me
Oh, you capture my attention
Carefully listening
Don't wanna miss a thing
Keeping my eyes on you
Oh, you capture my attention
I'm anticipating
I'm watching, I'm waiting
For you to make your move

For you to make your move
