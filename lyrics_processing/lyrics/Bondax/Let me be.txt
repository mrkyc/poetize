She wants me to stay
She's got to make up her mind
She's starting to wake
She's starting to break
Hope she'll be alright this time
But before you let down take your mind
But you know what I told you all this time
In darkness I'll be your moonlight
If there's anything I could do
Make it feel alright for you
Let me be your gentleman
Let me be your gentleman
You know I'm gonna make it all come true
Just one thing I ask from you
Let me be your gentleman
Let me be your gentleman
So she doesn't taste
Won't try play games
She ain't gonna set up a nest this time
Wants to own things
So I got a brain
And it's all and everything

But you know what I told you all this time

If there's anything I could do
Make it feel alright for you
Let me be your gentleman
Let me be your gentleman
You know I'm gonna make it all come true
Just one thing I ask from you
Let me be your gentleman
Let me be your gentleman
Let me be
Let me be your gentleman
Let me be
Let me be your gentleman
I promise you it will be just fine
'cos daddy taught to treat my woman right
If I ever cross the line it will be the gentle, be the gentle reasons you like
I promise you it will be just fine
'cos daddy taught to treat my woman right
If I ever cross the line it will be the gentle, be the gentle reasons you like
If there's anything I could do
