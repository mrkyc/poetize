But I know that I don't ever wanna leave
I feel the aura and I feel the atmosphere
The bass in pumping and now I believe
The light is my bass and I feel the attack now
Then I'll have a taste now, there's no turning back
We are moving as one
We're aligned with the stars
I know nothing can tear us apart
There's something ticky over my heart
The night is coming out of the dark
It's like there's no one else in the room
'Cause baby all I see is, all I see is you
Put my hands up to the sky
Let the music take me
(All I see)
All my senses come alive
Let the music take me
(All I see is you)
Put my hands up to the sky
Let the music take me
(All I see)
All my senses come alive
So happy, I could die!
Have we raise our body lose it all control
Baby, you keep my feet on the floor
You take over the rhythm, you take over my soul
You'd be dancing, leave me asking you for more
The light is my bass and I feel the attack now
Then I'll have a taste now, there's no turning back
We are moving as one
We're aligned with the stars
I know nothing can tear us apart!
There's something ticky over my heart
The night is coming out of the dark
It's like there's no one else in the room
'Cause baby all I see is, all I see is you!
Put my hands up to the sky
Let the music take me
(All I see)
All my senses come alive
Let the music take me
(All I see is you)
Put my hands up to the sky
Let the music take me
(All I see)
All my senses come alive
So happy, I could die!
(All I see is you)
Don't tell me I don't know youuu
I don't know youuu
Remember what I told you through these blind eyes?!
There's something ticky over my heart
The night is coming out of the dark
It's like there's no one else in the room
'Cause baby all I see is, all I see is you!
Put my hands up to the sky
Let the music take me
(All I see)
All my senses come alive
Let the music take me
(All I see is you)
Put my hands up to the sky
Let the music take me
(All I see)
All my senses come alive
