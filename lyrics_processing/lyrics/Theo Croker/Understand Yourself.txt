The systems are afraid of us
Organize and centralize
Only the strong will be Westernized
I don't wanna blend in (Oh no)
This is my roots and culture
And I don't wanna spend all
My life in the land of vultures
I know we all can follow, I don't mind
Take me to Africa and I'll be fine
Hey, up you mighty people
Accomplish what you will
Say you must be free so
How come you're sleeping still?
Up you mighty people
Accomplish what you will
Say you must be free
How come you're sleeping still?
Up you mighty people
Accomplish what you will
Say you must be free
How come you're sleeping still?
Up you mighty people
Accomplish what you will

Love and overstanding, every day
Love and overstanding now
The brightest light is within you
Overstand yourself and let your light shine bright, baby, oh
For that I know the brightest light shines deep within you
You got to overstand yourself and let your light shine bright
Overstand this is the words of a Rastaman
Go on and let your light shine
Go on and let your light shine, bright
