They said that we were worthless
They said that we were young
And they said that we should take our place
And learn to bite a tongue
They said that we were dangerous
Yeah, they said that we were told
And they said that we would break our necks
If we yell to sing another song

So come on
If you're sick of being told you were wrong
Then with everything inside you sing along

We were young and we were dangerous
Never cared of what they thought of us
We were dreaming of the days that would come
We were young and we were dangerous
Never living in the past of us
We were screaming at the top of our lungs
When we were young

They said that we were hopeless
Yeah, they said that we were young
And they said that we should take our place
Until our time had come
But I say we are dangerous
Yeah, I say that we are one
And I say that with each dying breath
We will never call to give it up

So come on
If you're sick of being told you were wrong
Then with everything inside you sing along

We were young and we were dangerous
Never cared of what they thought of us
We were dreaming of the days that would come
We were young and we were dangerous
Never living in the past of us
We were screaming at the top of our lungs
When we were young

When we were young
When we were young
When we were young

They said that we were dangerous
Yeah, they said that we were done
And they said that we would break our necks
If we yell to sing another song
So sing it
We were young and we were dangerous
Never care of what they thought of us
We were screaming of the days that will come
We were young and we were dangerous
Never living in the past of us
We were screaming at the top of our lungs
