YEEEEEEAAAAAHHHHHH!
We're all caught in a dream at different speeds
Chasing the highs that keep us high
But nothing will do, no, nothing is new
So I keep a close eye on you
I want more, give me more, I want more
Not America
Not the place I love
Not a mountaintop
Not a setting sun
I find no comfort here for my soul
The terrible tones we never expose
Carry the weight we love the most
The second of things were never to be
The first of our hopes, first of our dreams
I want more, give me more, I want more
Not America
Not the place I love
Not a mountaintop
Not a setting sun
I find no comfort here
Not America
Not the place I love
Not a thousand peaks
Not a thousand stars
I find no comfort here for my soul
You might also likeMy soul
Yeah, come on
All right
Woo
Not America
Not the place I love
Not a mountaintop
Not a setting sun
I find no comfort here
Not America
Not the place I love
Not a thousand peaks
Not a thousand stars
I find no comfort here for my soul
All my life I have tasted of the earth
Prone to try and secure the lesser worth
But every day the sun arrives and the moon when day is done
Still my heart it beats inside my chest, they're obeying only one
Not a politic, not a scientist, not a currency, not a lover's kiss
Not a selfish aid, not a clean escape, not the prayerful plan of a prideful man
Not a rush of fame
Not a critic's claim
Not America
Not the place I love
Not a mountaintop
Not a setting sun
I find no comfort here
In America
Not the place I love
Not a thousand peaks
Or a thousand stars
