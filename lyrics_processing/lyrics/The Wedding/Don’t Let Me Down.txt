Tell me your story like you would not have said it before
I've been dying
Here with your heart, all your fears, and while they are yours
I've been trying
To keep all the weight off, you and I both know
You're just fighting
This time just stay where you are and let me be yours

So just say what you wanted to say
But just don't hold back

Don't let me down, I've fallen away in all the shame that I feel
Don't let me down, I'm lost and awake
I need you now, I need you here

I know what you wanted, but safety was never a cure
I know you're dying
To break through the surface and find out what it was all for
I've been trying
To tell you that I'm not a ghost that comes and goes
I'm not fighting
The settle and the scores, I'm caught redeeming yours
You might also like
So just say what you wanted to say
But just don't hold back

Don't let me down, I've fallen away in all the shame that I feel
Don't let me down, I'm lost and awake
I need you now, I need you here
Don't let me down, I've fallen away in all the shame that I feel
Don't let me down, I'm lost and awake
I need you now, I need you

All of the cameras lie up in the shelf
I'll be caught in the wave
Come what may

So I'll say what I wanted to say
But I won't hold back

Don't let me down, I've fallen away in all the shame that I feel
Don't let me down, I'm lost and awake
I need you now, I need you here
Don't let me down, I've fallen away in all the shame that I feel
Don't let me down, I'm lost and awake
