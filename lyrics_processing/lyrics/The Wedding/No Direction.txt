I've spent too much time and action
On this static gold
Oh, it's all just static, don't lie
I've been working on a destination
Cross town cross state cross the nation
I just wanna go
Where you wanna go now
Who you gonna be now, who you gonna be?
Who you gonna be now, who you gonna be?
I've got no direction
I said I've got no direction
Who you gonna be now, who you gonna be?
Who you gonna be now, who you gonna be?
I've got no direction
I said I've got no direction
I look out but the stars are caving in
It's not like I'm the only one who's
Honest with themselves
But honest men, they don't lie
I've been running from the same offenses
Jumped line, jumped track, jumped defenses
I just wanna go
Where you wanna go now
You might also likeWho you gonna be now, who you gonna be?
Who you gonna be now, who you gonna be?
I've got no direction
I said I've got no direction
Who you gonna be now, who you gonna be?
Who you gonna be now, who you gonna be?
I've got no direction
I said I've got no direction
For years I've had my reservation
I got lost in a constellation
I got you with no direction
I got you with no direction!
I just wanna go
Where you wanna go now
Who you gonna be now, who you gonna be?
Who you gonna be now, who you gonna be?
I've got no direction
I said I've got no direction
Who you gonna be now, who you gonna be?
(I cut ties, batten down the hatches)
Who you gonna be now, who you gonna be?
(I've spent too much time and action)
I've got no direction
I said I've got no direction
(Oh it's all just static gold)
I've got no direction
I said I've got no direction
I've got no direction
