Ah, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh

Your suitcase is gone, with all of your things
Our old picture frames are empty
I burned all your letters, I took off your ring
But what can I do with these memories
Keeping me up 'til the dawn, hanging on like you're coming back
But you ain't coming back

So tell me why, baby, why, baby
Why, baby, why won't you let me let go?
Oh, I try, baby, try, baby, try
But your love just won't leave me alone
I can't stop the hurt, numb the pain
Cool the burn, kill the ache
No matter how hard that I
Cry, baby, cry
Why, baby, why?

I close my eyes when I kiss his lips
Praying this time I will see you
I'm real good at lying to everyone else
But I just can't lie to myself
When the truth is a shadow that follows me
Haunting me just like a ghost, if you're just a ghost

Tell me why, baby, why, baby
Why, baby, why won't you let me let go?
Oh, I try, baby, try, baby, try
But your love just won't leave me alone
I can't stop the hurt, numb the pain
Cool the burn, kill the ache
No matter how hard that I
Cry, baby, cry
Why, baby, why?

I saw your taillights fade into the dark
And my head knows, but there's no convincing my heart
Ah-ooh, ooh

Oh, why, baby, why, baby
Why, baby, why won't you let me let go?
Oh, I try, baby, try, baby, try
But your love just won't leave me alone
I can't stop the hurt, numb the pain
Cool the burn, kill the ache
No matter how hard that I
Cry, baby, cry
You know that I cry
Why, baby, why?
Why, baby, why?
