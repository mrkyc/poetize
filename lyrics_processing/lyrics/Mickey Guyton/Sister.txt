I know it's hard being strong
And not getting lost in a man's world
It's gonna try to break you down
But you gotta not give a damn, girl
Yeah, it makes you jaded
Yeah, it makes you tough
When it knocks us down
We gotta pick each other up

Sister, I got your back on the long drunk stumble home
Sister, I'll be your "Hell yeah!" when all you ever heard was "No"
I'm your speed-dial call, I'm your late-night cry
I'm your shotgun seat, yeah, I'm your ride or die
Sister, you're gonna hurt but you ain't gotta hurt alone

You gotta lot of dirt on me
You know every sin, every secret
Tell me the cold hard truth
A little white lie when I need it (Lie when I need it)
Yeah, sometimes we fight, call each other out
It don't matter 'cause we know that's what it's all about

Sister, I got your back on the long drunk stumble home
Sister, I'll be your "Hell yeah!" when all you ever heard was "No"
I'm your speed-dial call, I'm your late-night cry
I'm your shotgun seat, yeah, I'm your ride or die
Sister, you're gonna hurt but you ain't gotta hurt alone

You're my "Where you at?" text
When I run into my ex
I'm your drink-pouring shrink
Shake it off, ain't no thing
You're my thick, you're my thin
Through it all 'til the end

Yeah, you're my sister
I got your back on the long drunk stumble home
Sister, I'll be your "Hell yeah!" when all you ever heard was "No"
I'm your speed-dial call, I'm your late-night cry
I'm your shotgun seat, yeah, I'm your ride or die
