Club lights, we fight every night (Every night)
Baby, I don't wanna do that (I don't wanna do that)
Your type, jeans tight, Dirty Sprite (Dirty Sprite)
She like, "How the fuck you do that?" (How the fuck you do that?)
I can't be there all the time (All the time)
But you know I gotta prove that (Know I gotta prove that)
I can't leave here anytime soon (Nah)
I got somethin' to do, yeah

Walk away as the door slams (Door slams)
You got blood on your poor hands (Poor hands)
I just wanted to help, now I'm goin' to hell
Walk away as the door slams

I know you wanna FaceTime, baby, I have Samsung
When I met your mom, she told me I was handsome
You told me I'm sexy, do you still think that?
You told me you loved me, do you still think that?
3 AM, climbin' through your window
Ounce of the kush, blowin' smoke out your window
You're a thousand miles away, I snort a thousand lines
Step inside the club, cameras flashin' in my eyes
3 AM, climbin' through your window
