(Cowabunga, dude!)

I love you to the summer and back, it's not the winter
But you've frozen my heart, and got me warmin' up my liver
I would never put a knife in your back, the love I give her
Is kinda creepy, but fuck it, she orders and I deliver
I could never leave you alone, my little mama
Is mad at me at the moment, know she's such a prima donna
Wherever you are is my home, you know I mean it
They say home is where the heart is, you're the reason mine is beatin'

I will always be here for you, and when I'm dyin'
I pray to a higher power, next to you is where I'm lyin'
Would you fuck me right on the floor? I'm feelin' naughty
I wish to explore your features, secrets hidden in your body
I been feelin' like I don't have a choice, my only option
Watchin' me through the window as I whip up this concoction
Don't you ever take your life out of mine, I'll fuckin' kill you
Take you out to the bayou in the cabin with the mildew
And I'll leave you there for someone to find, my little angel
In your deepest darkest corners and I'm lovin' every angle
Baby, you got nowhere to hide, I'm comin' for you
Your parents could never fathom the levels to I adore you
It's like Palestine up inside my mind, a deadly war zone
Quakin' inside my boots as you waken my every hormone
I'll give you everything I've got till I'm gone, and that's a promise
Unless you didn't want it, then for you I'd be dishonest

I could never leave you alone, my little mama
Is mad at me at the moment, know she's such a prima donna
