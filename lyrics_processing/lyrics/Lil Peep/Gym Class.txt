Huh

Whip it like a Nascar, I can see the time pass
Feel like I'm in high school, fuckin' me in gym class
Shawty, I remember that, I know you remember that
You was fuckin' with me way before I even wrote raps
Now I'm seein' cash flow, I can be an asshole, yeah, I know
But it's all good 'cause I let her spend my money, though
Playboy bunny, though, shawty look like a pornstar
I know she love me 'cause she fuck me in her sports car
I pull up on her, tell her that we finna go far
Drop top, smokin' thrax, lookin' at the stars
Gettin' high, takin' bars 'til we on Mars
I can make the ground move like I'm Avatar
Now I'm faded on my own in my bedroom
Now I'm lookin' at my phone, should I text you?
I just wanna sex you, I just wanna bless you
Baby, I'm a priest in the underworld, guess who
Lil Bo Peep with a brand new flow, too
Lookin' at my teeth like you never seen a gold tooth
Never in the streets, 'cause I never leave my home
If you wanna live a dream I ain't comin', bitch, I told you
