Nah

You know it's fucked when the pain feel nice
Cheap liquor on ice (Yeah), nice
I'm tryna get you out my head tonight (Tonight)
I'm tryna get you out my fuckin' life (Fuckin' life, right)
Then we fucked, then she sucked me off twice
Then I left that bitch alone like I was right, fuckin' right (Wrong)
In your thong, smokin' strong outta bong
What the fuck, and I'm tryna make this song (Hey, uh, hey)
Young white prick, I get a kick out hittin' licks
Watch how I kick out yo bitch, just so I could cut my wrist
Bitch, I'm tatted out my shirt, so I can't work, I make it flip
Pour my 40 in the dirt, then light my dutch and take a sip
I hear voices in my head, they tellin' me to call it quits
I found some Xanax in my bed, I took that shit, went back to sleep
They gon' miss me when I'm dead, I lay my head and rest in peace
I'm prayin' to the sky, I don't even know why, ayy

Oh, I don't think I can take this anymore
No, washin' the blood from my wrist on the floor
Oh, fuck, what you talkin' 'bout? My shit is dope
Play this shit when they put me in a hole
For eternity, so they can reap what they sow (Shit)
Oh, I don't think I can do nothin' but flow
No, I don't know what she be fuckin' me for
Oh, I don't know why you in love with me, ho
I keep them felonies up in my coat
Up in the zone, I'm all on my own
