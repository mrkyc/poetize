Talkin' to the walls, think' 'bout callin' you
But I can't go back, cause it don't come so easily
I pack my bags and I'm free
Oh darlin
I, I'm runnin' away from the thought of you
I'm tellin' myself that's what I should do
But darlin', it just won't work out
I, I'm makin' believe that's the way to go
I'll pack up and leave you before you know
Oh baby, it just won't work out
Waitin' on a backstreet with my thumb up in the air
I'm burnin' up the concrete, and it don't matter where
But I can't go back 'cause it don't come so easily
I pack my bags and I'm free, whoo-whooo
I, I'm runnin' away from the thought of you
I'm tellin' myself that's what I should do
But darlin', it just won't work out
I, I'm makin' believe that's the way to go
I'll pack up and leave you before you know
'cause darlin, it just won't work out
Girl it's true
There is no one else but you
But this happens every time
I get scared
And I run for the open air
Just when everything is goin' so fine
You might also likeI'm stoppin' at a phone booth, I wonder if you're home
Stuffin' in the quarters, I'm feelin so alone
But it just rings on it's rainin' where I'm callin' from
I grab my bag and I'm gone - woah ho ho ho
I, I'm runnin' away from the thought of you
Tellin' myself that's what I should do
Oh darlin', it just won't work out
I, I'm makin' believe that's the way to go
I'll pack up and leave you before you know
'cause darlin, it just won't work out
I, I'm runnin' away from the thought of you
Tellin' myself that's what I should do
Oh darlin', it just won't work out
I, I'm makin' believe that's the way to go
