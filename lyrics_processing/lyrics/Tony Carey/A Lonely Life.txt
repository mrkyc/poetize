He does a bang up business
In the middle of the night
And he sits by the radio
Ain't givin nothin' away, oh no
And the calls come in on the cb
And little John, he's gonna send you what you need
Send you a little somethin'
To get you through the day
Ooh to get you through the day
Little Maria's in deep, can't stop
She been savin up her money for a beauty shop
She been countin' the days and the years
With a mark on the wall, oh yeah
And she came out here all fresh and young
Said she'd get out of the game before the damage got done
And little John he just laughed, now he's heard it all
Yes he's really heard it all
It's a lonely life
Wrapped up in the fingers of the night
Snapped up in the net so tight
You're wonderin' why you came
Why you came
Yes it's a lonely life
All alone on the derelict streets
You crawl home
When you're dead on your feet
You'll never leave the game
No, you'll never get out of the game
Oh no no
You might also likeIt's a lonely life
Wrapped up in the fingers of the night
Snapped up in the net so tight
You're wonderin' why you came
Why you came
Yes it's a lonely life
All alone on the derelict streets
You crawl home
When you're dead on your feet
You'll never leave the game
No, you'll never get out of the game
Oh no no
And there ain't no road in sight that's goin' home
You got little John with his bike
And girl you're all his own
And you think you're marking
Time 'til something comes along
But you're not the first little princess baby
To find that you were wrong
And it's a lonely life
Wrapped up in the fingers of the night
Snapped up in the net so tight
You're wonderin' why you came
Why you came
Yes it's a lonely life
All alone on the derelict streets
You crawl home when you're dead on your feet
You'll never leave the game
No, you'll never get out of the game
Baby it's lonely life
It's such a lonely life
And you'll never get out
