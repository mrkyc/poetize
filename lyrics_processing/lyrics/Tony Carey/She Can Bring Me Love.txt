And it's carried on the wind
In the alley's and the vacant lots
I hear it over and over again
And when the whistle blows at 4:30
And the second shift comes on
She'll be waitin' there on the corner
When the others have long gone
And we're a pair of young lovers
With nothin to our names
We've only got each other
That's enough, all the same
And when I know she's waiting there
I can tell you what I'm thinking of
I'm thinkin' she can bring me
She can bring me love
My baby brings me love
She brings me love
In this tight and lonely city
If a man moves out for himself
What my baby brings to me
I can't get from no one else
You might also likeAnd the whole world walks all over you
Pass you by without lookin back
When my baby comes home to me
I don't think about that
And we're a pair of young lovers
With nothin to our names
We've only got each other
That's enough, all the same
And when I know she's waiting there
I can tell you what I'm thinking of
I'm thinkin' she can bring me
She can bring me love
And she's right there when
I need her,I need her
And she's still there
When I'm all alone, all alone
And she comes to me
When I'm lost in my everyday
And she builds me up
And she makes me strong
She brings me her love
In her own special way
She brings me love
Ooh, my baby brings me love
My baby brings me love
My baby brings me love
Uh-huh
And we're a pair of young lovers
With nothin to our names
We've only got each other
That's enough, all the same
And when I know she's waiting there
I can tell you what I'm thinking of
I'm thinkin' she can bring me
She can bring me love
My baby brings me love
