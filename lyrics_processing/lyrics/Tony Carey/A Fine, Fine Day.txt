Said "I'll just go for a ride
And have a look 'round."
And he took off his fedora
And stuck his fingers in the crown
And he pulled out twenty dollars
And he laid that money down
And he called out to a taxi cab
"Take me down to Central Park
And keep that meter runnin'
To the twenty dollar mark."
And he kept his eyes turned forward
And he sat up straight and tall
And no one even noticed him
No one cared at all
It's a fine, fine day
For a reunion
It's a fine, fine day
For comin' home
You did your sittin'
You did hard time
But you ain't gonna sit no more
They can't keep you there no more
It's a fine, fine day
And nothin's gonna take you
Nothin's gonna take you away
It's a fine, fine day, oh yeah
You might also likeFirst time I saw Sonny
I was just about this tall
And he always made my momma
Kinda crazy when he'd call
Him and my old man
Would stand and whisper in the hall
Then they'd disappear
And maybe not come home at all
Then one day Sonny stopped comin' round
Heard he'd gotten himself into
A little trouble out in town
Sometime after that
He finally disappeared for good
Then he pulled that ol' Houdini
Like we always knew he would!
It's a fine, fine day
For a reunion
It's a fine, fine day
For comin' home
You did your sittin'
You did hard time
But you ain't gonna sit no more
They can't keep you there no more
It's a fine, fine day, oh yeah
And nothin's gonna drag you
Nothin's gonna drag you away
Oh yeah, it's a fine, fine day
Fine day
"I see you made it back alright, alright
I see you're none the worse for wear
It's been a long time comin'
Nothin's gonna drag you away from here!"
A fine, fine day
And nothin's gonna drag you
Nothin's gonna drag you away
Oh yeah
A fine, fine day, a fine day
And nothin's gonna drag you
