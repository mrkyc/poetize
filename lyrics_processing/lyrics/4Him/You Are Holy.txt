I've come to worship You
And worship You alone
Here within my soul
A song begins to rise
Until it to overflows
You are holy, You are holy
I will lift my voice to You
And sing it with the angels
You are holy, You are holy
We will offer You our praise
In a mighty chorus
You are holy, You are holy
Wonderful in all Your ways
Holy, You are Holy Lord
When your love breaks through
And I am swept away
By just a glimpse of You
Then You make me new
'Til I'm nothing less
Than what I find in You
You are holy, You are holy
I will lift my voice to You
And sing it with the angels
You might also likeYou are holy, You are holy
We will offer You our praise
In a mighty chorus
You are holy, You are holy
You're wonderful in all Your ways
Holy, You are Holy Lord
Unto the One
Who sits on the Throne
Unto the Lamb
Be all the blessing and honor
Glory and Power and Praise
Whoa-whoa...
Unto the One
Who sits on the Throne
Unto the Lamb
Be all the blessing and honor
Glory and Power and Praise
All creation sing
And then heaven and earth
We make known
You are holy, You are holy
We will offer You our praise
In a mighty chorus
You are holy, You are holy
Wonderful in all Your ways
Holy, You are Holy Lord
You are holy, You are holy
We will offer You our praise
In a mighty chorus
You are holy, You are holy
Wonderful in all Your ways
Holy, You are
You are holy, You are holy
We will offer You our praise
In a mighty chorus
You are holy, You are holy
Wonderful in all Your ways
