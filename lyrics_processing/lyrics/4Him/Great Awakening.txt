We search for wonders, for miracles and signs
Something to satisfy the hunger in us all
A human rage from deep within the soul
Like a machine in pursuit
On the horizon like a raging fire we move
Driven by questions in
That endless search for truth
There is a stirring in us
A great awakening begins
I believe there's a mighty power
I believe it's a latter rain
I believe there's a move of God
Calling us all higher
Oh, I believe these are the days
Of the great awakening, yeah
The days of the great awakening, yeah
More than our hearts can contain
It is an overflow of God's amazing grace
Coming to reconcile a world that's lost its way
Oh, all consuming fire
Come purify us once again

This great move of restoration
There's no chains, no walls
No boundaries, no lines

If we'll just get down on our knees
That rain is gonna fall
It's just matter of time
