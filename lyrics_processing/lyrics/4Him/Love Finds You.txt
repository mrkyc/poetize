My mind recalls a picture
Of a place that I call home
You are there in my memory
A scene that's so familiar
That it chills me to the bone
But I'll stay out here where I belong
For the call is telling me to carry on
And while I'm away I can dream
And suddenly you're there
Love finds you, love brings you to me
And once again we walk together
Love finds you, love brings you to me
And binds the hands of time forever
We may be worlds apart
But you are never too far
From where I need you to be
Love finds you, love brings you to me
It was not what we planned to be
We all would change the ending
If the choice was ours to make
For you left us so suddenly
But it's only the beginning
For eternity awaits
And I'll never forget you, my friend
For the brotherhood between us has no end
And while you're away I can dream
And suddenly you're there
You might also likeLove finds you, love brings you to me
And once again we walk together
Love finds you, love brings you to me
And binds the hands of time forever
We may be worlds apart
But you are never too far
From where I need you to be
Love finds you, love brings you to me
Through the fire of the journey
Through the good and through the bad
You are not alone
And through each and every turn of life
Through the seasons of your path
I want you to know wherever you go
Love finds you, love brings you to me
And once again we walk together
Love finds you, love brings you to me
And binds the hands
Binds the hand of time forever
Love finds you, love brings you to me
And once again we walk together
Love finds you, love brings you to me
And binds the hands of time forever
We may be worlds apart
But you are never too far
From where I need you to be
Love finds you, love brings you to me
