Entering earth through your precious womb
My child, oh, My mother of earth
Give Me the gift of birth
Sleep Joseph sleep may you dream of love
And peace to the earth
Through your newborn Son
Oh, raise Me with honor and pride
I will stand by your side
And I'll be in your care
Safely harbored there
My heavenly host will follow Me close
But always remember, please be aware
That I will be in your care
Now Israel, oh, My chosen one
The prophets foretold
That this day would come
I pray you will know I'm your King
Salvation is what I bring
And I'll be in your care
Safely harbored there
My heavenly host will follow Me close
But always remember, please be aware
That I will be in your...
You might also likeCare for Me and shelter Me in childhood
Knowing that someday I'll have to go
And though it may seem hopeless
When I'm hanging on the tree
You can know for certain I'll return
But, until then oh...
You'll be in My care
Safely harbored there
My heavenly host will follow you close
But always remember, please be aware
You will be in My care
You'll be in My care
You will be, you'll be in, you'll be in My care
Yes, you will, you will be
You will be, you'll be in, you'll be in My care
You'll be in My care
You will be, you'll be in, you'll be in My care
You'll be in My care
You will be, you'll be in, you'll be in My care
You'll be in My care
You will be, you'll be in, you'll be in My care
Be in My care, be in My care
You will be, you'll be in, you'll be in My care
