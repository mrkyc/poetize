Outside on a cold and lonely street
A homeless woman sleeps this Christmas
And tonight, there's a child that dreams of home
In an orphanage alone
This Christmas, let's show them we care
For all they really need is a helping hand
From you and me
The season of love
I really believe that this world
Would be much better
And people would come together
If we share the reason for the season of love
The spirit of Christmas
It can change this world forever
If we all will play our part
Just by giving from the heart, I know
Christmas will really become
The season of love
Somewhere, underneath a Christmas tree
Is a simple manger scene this Christmas
And there lying on a bed of straw
Is the greatest gift of all
This Christmas, let's let the world know
For all they really need is the love of God
To set them free

I really believe that this world
Would be much better
And people would come together
If we share the reason for the season of love
The spirit of Christmas
Can change this world forever
If we all will play our part
Just by giving from the heart, I know
Christmas will really become
The season of love
Though the holiday passes away
And the lights begin to fade
The spirit of Christmas will remain
I really believe that this world
Would be much better
And people would come together
If we share the reason for the season of love
The spirit of Christmas
Can change this world forever
If we all will play our part
By giving, whoa, I know
Christmas will really become
The season of love
The season of love
(The spirit of Christmas)
(I really believe)
I really, I really believe it
Oh, yeah, yeah
(The spirit of Christmas)
The season of love
(I really believe)
