For a new day has dawned
And we've rearranged
What is right and what's wrong
Somehow we've drifted so far from the truth
That we can't get back home
And where are the virtues
That once gave us light
And where are the morals
That governed our lives
Someday we all will awake and look back
Just to find what we've lost
We need to get back to the basics of life
A heart that is pure and a love that is blind
A faith that is fervently grounded in Christ
The hope that endures for all times
These are the basics
We need to get back to the basics of life
The newest rage is to reason it out
Just meditate and you can overcome every doubt
After all man is a God
They say God is no longer alive
But I still believe in the old rugged cross
Whoa, I still believe there is hope for the lost
And I know the rock of all ages will stand
Through the changes of time
Through the changes of time

The hope that endures for all times
These are the basics
We need to get back to the basics of life
We've let the darkness invade us too long
We've got to turn the tide
Oh, and we need the passion that burned long ago
To come and open our eyes
There's no room for compromise
We need to get back to the basics of life
A heart that is pure and a love that is blind
We need to get back to the basics of life
A heart that is pure and a love that is blind
A faith that is fervently grounded in Christ
The hope that endures for all times
These are the basics
We need to get back to the basics of life
We need to get back to the basics of life
A heart that is pure and a love that is blind
(We gotta have a faith)
A faith that is fervently grounded in Christ
The hope that endures for all times
These are the basics
We need to get back to the basics of life
Whoa...
The basics of life
The basics of life
The basics of life
(We'll be together)
