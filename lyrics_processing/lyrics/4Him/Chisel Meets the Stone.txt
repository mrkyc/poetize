Who wants to have his way
And I cannot comply
I relinquish this heart of mine
Lord, I am desperate for Your handiwork
I'm ready for the change
And I can't wait to see
What You can do with me
It was for my joy
You endured the cross
And I am overwhelmed
I want my wheels to turn for You
Not for myself
Let my eyes be fixed
On the hope that cannot fail
May my life be set
Where the hammer meets the nail
Place my feet
Where the rubber meets the road
Shape my heart
To please Your eyes alone
That I may live my life
Where the chisel meets the stone
You might also likeFill my mind with images
Of what You want of me
The path that I must take
Lest I lose my way
For my home is in Your sovereignty
My destiny to be
Faithful before Your face
To serve at the throne of grace
And as evil comes to cloud my sight
And lure me away
I will not be distracted from this holy place
Let my eyes be fixed
On the hope that cannot fail
May my life be set
Where the hammer meets the nail
Place my feet
Where the rubber meets the road
Shape my heart
To please Your eyes alone
That I may live my life
Where the chisel meets the stone
Chip away what tries to hide the truth
Until there is a remarkable
Resemblance of You
Let my eyes be fixed
On the hope that cannot fail
May my life be set
Where the hammer meets the nail
Place my feet
Where the rubber meets the road
Shape my heart
To please Your eyes alone
That I may live my life
Where the chisel meets the stone
