They are everywhere
All that we hear about
Is the gloom and despair
Too many would be prophets saying
"It's the end of it all"
'Cause mother earth can't take much more
The hammer's gonna fall
So nature has its needs
That's a lesson learned
But it appears to me
There are greater concerns
'Cause we can save the planet
Thinkin' we will somehow survive
But father time is calling us
To save somebody's life
So I won't bend and I won't break
And I won't water down my faith
I won't compromise in a world of desperation
What has been I cannot change
But for tomorrow and today
I must be a light for future generations
If we could find a way
To preserve our faith
So those who follow us
See the price that was paid
Then maybe when they question
What it's gonna take to survive
They'll find the strength to carry on
In what we leave behind

And I won't water down my faith
I won't compromise in a world of desperation
What has been I cannot change
But for tomorrow and today
I must be a light for future generations
Lookin' in the eyes of the children
Knowing that tomorrow is at stake
When the choice is up to them
Will they have the strength to say
We won't bend and we won't break
(We won't bend or break)
We won't water down our faith
We won't compromise in a world of desperation
What has been we cannot change
But for tomorrow and today
We must be a light for future generations
(For future generations, yeah, yeah)
We won't bend and we won't break
We won't water down our faith
We won't compromise in a world of desperation
What has been we cannot change
But for tomorrow and today
We must be a light for future generations
We must be a light for future generations
Yes, we must be a light for future generations
We must be a light for future generations
