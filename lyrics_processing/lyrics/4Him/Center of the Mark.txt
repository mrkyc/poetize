Oh, that's the center of
That's the center of the mark
In this life
Some things are bound to change
But one thing remains the same
We all need love
Time goes by
It moves like a hurricane
And through all the wind and rain
We all need love
As this world just keeps on turnin'
Round and round
There are treasures to be found
If we just let compassion lead the way
Draw back your bow, let love go
Shoot straight for the heart
With all of your might, set your sight
Take aim from the start
To love God, love people
That's the center of the mark, oh...
Ooh, every day
Through what is and is to come
When all has been said and done
We all need love
So Jesus came
A gift from the heart of God
He gave us His life because
We all need love
And the love that death
Could not keep in the grave
Is alive in us today
So we must live to show the world the way
You might also likeDraw back your bow, let love go
Shoot straight for the heart
With all of your might, set your sight
Take aim from the start
To love God, love people
That's the center of the mark
For the world is the target
And the arrow is the cross
As we set out on this journey
Let's obey the call from the heart of God
Let us Love at any cost
Draw back you bow, let love go
Draw back your bow, let love go
Shoot straight for the heart
With all of your might, set your sight
Take aim from the start
Oh, to love God, love people
That's the center of the mark
Draw back your bow, let love go
Oh, shoot straight, straight for the heart
With all of your might, set your sight
Oh, take aim from the start
To love God, love people
That's the center of the mark
To love God, love people
