When You made my life complete
Everything was pure and simple then
It was only You and me
I remember times together
When the fellowship was sweet
But it seems at times so far away
It's become a memory
I got to have You close to me
Oh, I wanna hear You call my name
Make it like it used to be
Lord, I'm asking You today

The place where I first met You
When the presence of Your love
Was so brand new
So take me to the place
The place where You first held me
Oh, when the treasure
Of my heart's desire was You
After all the years have vanished
And my life begins to fade
Lord, I pray that You will shelter me
In the warmth of Your embrace
For I long to keep the vision
Of my childhood memories
So that I will have a tender heart
Even when I'm old and grey

Forevermore that I will be
In the shadow of Your care
So take me to the place
The place where I first met You
Oh, when the presence of Your love
Was so brand new
So take me to the place
The place where You first held me
Oh, when the treasure
Of my heart's desire was You
So never go away from me
Oh, this will always be my prayer
Forevermore that I will be
In the shadow of Your care, yeah
So take me to the place
The place where I first met You
Oh, when the presence of Your love
Was so brand new
So take me to the place
The place where You first held me
Oh, when the treasure
