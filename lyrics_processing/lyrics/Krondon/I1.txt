Guarantee to get up off the ground.. without using kick start
Nothing wrong with that, actually it is smart
Hold your rash would rather gather with you be smart
Liberate the nation let the kids watch
Male got persuading at the big shark
Glorify young diesoline playing his part
I see the lion still tryna find his heart
Listen to the sound.. you can tell he never shipped a pound
Take a trip around the globe until the steady getting down
Niggas sitting down the game got no kids up in the house
It's the first and righteous out
Niggas screaming sharp and action being tough as mighty mouse
Feeling fly me South, wondering when life what's right about
Will he strap it out, slapping niggas like you in the mouth

Ultimate, every word I heard is to alto
The paradise of where I'm some
Sunk in pain some suffer, will the weak wilt and muster
I mustn't forget, I don't remember shit
Stunting, mix up my Sprite with a lil tussin
The temperature of malfunction is dangerous
Death to the fake shit, no discussion
Just make sure my duck is coming and stop fronting nigga

You couldn't classify my category to fly the smoke with anybody
You'll survive that's another story
Bad enough your raps on me
Get the bad news and watch 'em over, you're joe torey
I joke somebody this park is spot robbery
I park the spot bam I got 'em
His rap's so sloppy to me is just a hobby
That became a way I live I calmly
Lit the J lay back and play the eyes lids
Like Juicy J you stay and trip it nightly
Used to play excite bite that old Atari
The pipe and black tar scarred me
Motivated by the money get Marley more medicine
One day I will be a cold reverent
Cones roll, cars stole before us so it's a closed session
Swag soaking from the most freshest
Finesse with little effort and knock 'em the time I count my blessings
Don't count 'em up my boy my progression
By any means my enemies will see me fierce
I play these niggas with me never have to see police
I've been lab between world peace who what will be
The disorderly knock you out your feet
What the quarter be jealous cordially according to thy
Niggas getting money on the street
They know I won nigga
They know I won nigga (Smoke it)
You know I won nigga
You know I won nigga
