My sweet sensation ,sweet leaf
My favorite feature presentation
I need these
Dominant earth with no seed tree
Rounding terf of the quarter pea
You fat ye, you fat ye
How you fit up in that sack ye
Purple and them black hairs
Orange lips and them green eyes
All the hoes know I'm gonna leave
Because you're the ones keeping me high
I'm straight fucking
I don't really love
But I'm holding on you my only friend
I only want to love my one
But we never break that up
It takes more than mack to make it
You on China stunt, you deserve you a diamond dump
Two many times my granny has smelled your perfume in my cup
Shook her head , then marvy this here bitch won't get you far
Flyest thing that I found
I ain't trying to put you down
But you better put your clip on pounds, and come back around
To a nigga like, I really like it put you out I treat you right
Every night I always hit , matter of fact fuck this
Roll up
You might also like(Hook)
I don't drink I might sip and let the pink in that purple
And raise the purple and pass it all in the circle ,with my niggers
She's my number 1 , I made a friend, my bestie to the end
I won't stop I won't pretend it, despite again rolled up
(Verse)
I see your sensitivity's starting to show
But I only hit it once and wanna let it go
Took several months for us to live and grow
The shit taught a nigga everything I know
Fuck her take a nap, power plant so professional
She likes to ride with my eyes low
From the time zone with my mind's gone
Mine high but them nines gone
Can't compare 'cause our tie strong
She like to sit on my bong
And asking me to hold on
Freaky bitch, R James had her first
She ain't love him either, now she doin me worse
Letting little niggers getting a piece of her purse
Platinum MC's burned up dirt
And I don't mess with them dirty hoes
Them dirty hoes I know I work
I rather hit it while I'm doing my work and I can't lie
I'ma hit it once I finish with church and it's all right
I really like it put you out I treat you right
Every night I always hit , matter of fact fuck this
Roll up
(Hook)
I don't drink I might sip and let the pink in that purple
And raise the purple and pass it all in the circle ,with my niggers
She's my number 1 , I made a friend, my bestie to the end
