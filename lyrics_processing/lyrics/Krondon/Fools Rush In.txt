Life with me just black and blue
Black boy and his eyes are blue
His hair's is blond but his life is true
Got a couple zits and this Louie Vuitton
And his news shoes way beyond
He ain't new schooled or home schooled
Can't achieve it if I showed you
And believe it if I told you
It's so sociable, totally global
The light of the Lord do vocals
All aboard if you can't afford
Don't worry I flow with you
Just smoke you fool
Nigga be broke with no tools
Selling dough so they don't lose
Getting high they ain't shit to do
But stay low avoid pistols
Sniff blow avoid issues
Had on, went town looking for my home boy
Whole lot of niggas went and employ
Sip a little service to enjoy
Maybe pop a pill for the copperfield
All day slipping for the proper meal
Walk around head down with nothing left
Looked up in the sky need no one else
Got my wealth cause I got my health
Nigga know they can't save myself
As I always felt
I always felt

5 feets fast cars mean draws take it out
Take it out, take it out
Hoes, walls, mean stars ,single boys take it out
Take it out, take it out
I'm high as fuck
Take take take, take it out
I gave up
Take take take, take it out

Backed up again against a brick wall
Up the bat, face is loaded
Y'all niggers swinging for a hit
My niggers swinging for defense
Don't make dollars niggers senseless
Too scared to bare witness
Unprepared for the wetty
Everybody feels tension ,it gets tension
Both heads don't hear or listen
To the voice in size conviction
So I drink and drive while I'm getting high
Who am I be to be quick
Who am I bullshiting
Who'll sell their soul for position
Kiss and tell while I wish them well
Teach a hungry nigga how to go fishing
And make key out a log see through the falls
Stick to the house
Brick on the bone won't leave or fall
Like I'm out of your mind
So true black and blue
Niggas don't fly they laugh at you
Can't understand they mad at you
Step to the plan do gradual
Young dizzle used to carry a dumb pistol
Better hope I don't fuck with you
(If I do I'm gonna come with you)
And pray the angels up in heaven even have the time to up lift you
Everything's nothing
5 feets fast cars mean draws take it out
Take it out, take it out
Hoes, walls, mean stars ,single boys take it out
Take it out, take it out
I'm high as fuck
Take take take, take it out
