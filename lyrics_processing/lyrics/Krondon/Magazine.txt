I'm irritated, actually understand it
Elated you would not think it would happen
Holograms of hot times come
Hit the club for the eight time
Never tell a man that it ain't mine
Go ahead camel backpack go diamond
While them niggers hating on me won't change the channel
Genuine article niggers out rap you
No need to ever attack , let my man clap you
Funny how the fight turn, beats to the white chump
Niggas behave so irrational
It don't matter though
Thick catalogue and consistently classical
Hit the back door, forces of horses will speed pass you
Lego conffeti falling snap back at you
That commemorated undisputed champion
Effort executed under one team it's just one dream

I was 14, wanted to be in a magazine
End up carrying an M16 magazine
Kicking high most of my days
I made some change of all the paper I made
You never made it , ok
Now I am seen in a magazine
Some days I wish I had an M16 magazine
Me and you are hardly the same
You want the fame, I want to break for the pay
So get the fuck out my way
You might also like
Gone, leave the circles no clowns allowed
It ain't where you're from it's where you're found nigga
You in the rang with the untangled gorilla this
Insane , continue with the propane agenda
Should've been born in December I'm like God's gift
Not much a remember it was a long spliff
Arrangement of an orchestra magnificent
Matter of fact the matter enough of mad clip
My man less made more acquainted crip thrill training
Praying till they seeing his reign
In the rain that gray goose it's hardly a plain
All drink the half of chicken and it conducting a train
Old trolley appears swallow top loving my chain I swear she never
Fuck a nigga every semester, and I let her
Alot of me crying my shoulder, just be sucker free
Look at me I'm something to see


Train hard trip to the train traveller
Fast track the frame I may fast fall the pain scars
Young niggers neglected now their ways gone
It's the tragic trademark the trail apart
Try to start over in Noah's ark
You both scrub for parts in an ocean with hungry sharks
Shallow hearts
Hold your cards real they get large
Trying to avoid a larsony charge warn with the song
Hide in el the barge your predictor
Restore and there could be no cause
Sinking garages, gauge less gauges
Either against or fucking for it's toward for y'all
Reinvent my intent for she cost us gauges
Take your pick more or less
Entirely my intellect looking like the rest
Gone run a lap, break a sweat
Better yet run it back nigga break yourself
