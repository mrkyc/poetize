Make everything better, make everything better girl
Make everything bad, get on your knees when you get wetter
Make everything better, make everything better girl

Grinding on that shit, back on this bitch
You know that home girl don't hit, she know your shit ain't close to this
I crystalize my grinding, her booty's big bionic
She can always be my parley, fly girl come ride it
Yeah I'm ultraviolet, translation, I'm shining
That nigga get the gas face and keep wide at the gas station I'm wide
We ain't leave fire that, main bitch, fire that
Leave a nigga sick, sitting on ricks gonna mess how it with my tires at
Your bitch's ass is tight and flat, my bitch's ass got the hour fit
Like the hourglass, nigga so hard in the shower she can use it
As a towel rack... I'm proud of that, hearts are break, love lies
We smoking better and eating better, getting wetter on the aisle 5
Never said I was the best nigga, your bitch said it, I just agreed
Got things to bang and I got a gang but a gang to hang is just me
Trust me I'm too unique, my style alone is too freak
Her smile alone is too sweet, guaranteed I'm gon' be eventually I'm gon' be


She is my girl, doing everything that I can't before, making everything
What I lay thing hard, put a lot of ham cause you came this far
Fuck a lot of niggas I'm afraid to stop, you buy the car, I drive the shit
She buy the weed I light the shit, I like the shit, she's the type I might like to hit
Want some fun and I call again, pretty big titties that she toll it then
It's all a saying she swallow him, you'll swallow him, you'll swallow him
Cypher Ciroc I fall to ten, make a poor guy rich get all to spend
Make a rich nigga spend it all to win and they get up in you know get in
Said the same, serenade a bitch with a little bit of bad and some venge grain
It's all a dream, it's all a dream in Brooklyn my brazilian queen
In new queen, tight jeans, right to clean and picked to fuck can suck the D
Type as a nigga can't stand let 'em treat me like a Cali king
It's nine fourteen, straight flight, I can't relate it's in a day right
We could be great if you just act right, don't play fierce and don't play dike
You stay right, get the fuck out my way and we'll be alright
We about the chips, Frito Lay, and I keep you close like this ghetto K, push it
