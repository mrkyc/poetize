HEY what's happening homeboy
Here's a little remix for you to bump
With my homeboy Spanish fly
And my homeboy Mr.Sancho
As if you didn't know this is Lil' Rob
Putting it down, Low profile style
Thats right
Yeah Check this out
Lil'Rob kicking back with my homeboy Maniac getting all maac
Tell me where the ladies at,anywhere the lil'rob and maniac be at
Plus i got the yerba,the yesca or whatever you wanna call it
Can't get enough of the stuff,lil'rob be a marijuanaholic
Causing trouble everywhere we go, dont wanna stare then we go
Hynas like to follow mi carro, cali baby i'll take you home tomorrow
I promise i'm honest,poke you like nopales
Dont act like you dont know porque baby tu sabes
I'd rather smoke a joint then to spend a half a night with time to prove my point rather go get wasted,then sit back and have my time wasted if you didn't know now you know just how we do it, its lil' rob and maniac popping off like a bullet
Time after time place after place
All the pedos that i found myself enbraced
Got into discussion, got out a concussion
Now its time to see my reprocussion
Up in this vida smoking cannibus sativa
With this beatiful morenita now vente sientate arriva
Chikita que bonita estas dejame verte por atras
Te abrazo de los lados te agarro con las manos porque sabes quiero mas volteate agachate abre la boca y agarrate ,yo termino diparandote y luego terminas limpiandote,un tragito de pisto chiquito me quiero enborachar pokito,agarro un pokito pisto estoy listo para tomar contigo,estuve en la nuve y sabes que supe que estaba con lupe y ganas le puse pero no me gusto so i won't go back for more
Swig and take a sip,never slip always tripping and dipping always smoking and chokin and loc'ing and poking your girl then twirl around and roll another joint and put it up so what the fuck we here for whats the beer for , its a 2-triple-0 so low profile is here, oh no watch when i come , duck when i buck i dont give a fuck ill keep you in a truck
Keep on rollin down the stream till your body bloating and floating in a creek
Never will the cops see, who was he ,just another victim of society
