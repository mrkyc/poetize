I wanna be
I wanna...
I wanna be stuck with you
I wanna be
I wanna...
Hook: Fingazz
I do it, I do it for you
Cause I wanna be stuck with you
I do it, I do it for you
Cause I wanna be stuck with you

(Verse 1)
I could all day watching you
Girl, I'm just a man, I'm not stalking you
I've had many conversations with many women
But, for some reason, I can't talk to you (No)
You don't wanna hear them lies
I'm sure it happens a lot, you probably hear 'em all the time (Yeah)
But I bull you not
I like you a lot
And I just wanna be on your mind
Maybe I can head to your spot
And pick you up around seven o'clock
And we can do, whatever you want
However you like
And we don't ever have to stop
Your smile brightens up a room
And I don't think I'd ever get enough of you (No)
Girl, I just really wanna  with you
And I really wouldn't mind being stuck with you

So what you say, girl
Just tell me what to do
I need to know what it takes
To get you stuck on me too
Repeat Hook
Chorus: Lil' Rob (Fingazz)
I wouldn't mind being stuck with you (Stuck with you)
Girl, I can't get enough of you (Girl)
And there ain't nothing that I won't do (No)
Will do the good and the rough with you (Yeah)
I wouldn't mind being stuck with you (Stuck with you)
Girl, I can't get enough of you (Girl)
And there ain't nothing that I won't do (No)
I do anything you ask me to (Yeah)
(Verse 2)
And I don't wanna too fast
 around, fall in love and crash
But anytime with you would be worth it
A lifetime with you would be perfect
You're beautiful and intelligent too
The last thing you need is an arrogant fool
Who don't know how to treat someone like you
It's lucky for you that I do (I do)
Hey, don't let no one get you down
Not even me, but I won't let you down
Smiles on my face when you come around
But, when you leave, it turns upside down (Why)
You can read my professions to my expressions
My expressions will answer any questions
I only have eyes for you
I only want you
And I won't accept no exceptions
Repeat Pre-Hook, Hook & Chorus
(Verse 3)
And there ain't nothing that I won't do
I'll pull a star from the sky for you
If you ask me to
I want to be more than just a friend
I'll only stop to start again
If I could talk to you, what would you say
What are the chances you'll feel the same way
Would you say you're in love with me
And that you want nothing more than to be stuck with me (Girl, just let know)
Repeat Pre-Hook
Repeat Hook Twice
Repeat Pre-Hook

I do it, I do it for you
