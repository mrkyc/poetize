Yeah I'm Lil Rob and I'm slim in size
A T-shirt levis is my only disguise
Built like a tank  Yet hard to hit
Lil Rob in the house
Cold running shit
Aye What the fuck do I do?
I fuckin rap fool
So I got some rapping to do
People say Rob what the fuck happen to you?
Man you gotta take it back
And put some Zapp in the tune
40oz in my lap and it's freezing my balls
Got the bass crank'd high putting cracks in the walls
My phones blowin up but I ain't taking no calls
And I got the kind of homeboys the be breakin; the law

Good game peeps all game
Who lasts the longest? Who's the strongest?
Good game peeps all game
If you don't like it I suggest you break wide
Good game peeps all game
Who last the longest? Who's the strongest?
While they're slippin back My feet are planted on the pavement
You might also like
Yeah I'm a hip hop Junkie
A lot of people bump me
Sippin brass monkey
That funky monkey
Pull up in the cadi
I'm scraping the floor
You might have a lot of bounce
I got much more
And theres more where that came from
Yeah I got more in store
Yeah I got more tricks up my sleeves
Way more than I need
I remember way back when
When I would kick my volume
Way pass ten
My beats are tuff
Bumpin' out the trunk
Ese Lil Rob never fake the funk
Can't believe they did it man
Homie what the fuck?
Discontinued my Cortez now I'm laced up in Chucks

While they're slippin back My feet are planted on the pavement
Always calm under pressure
No need to act ill
Listen when I tell ya boy
You gots to chill
I am so swift and that's a natural fact
I'm kick back cause like that
Is wiggity wiggity wiggity wack
I keep on rappin' till I can't speak
Or I can't breathe
Which ever one happens first
But I still gots to make it worse
And do it like I do it
I been bustin raps since I was sixteen with a bullet
And I don't quit and I don't stop
Moox make the floor drop
More bounce to the once bumpin out the Beat Box
Remain to make the streets rock
R-O-B R.I.P. Quick to make them streets talk
