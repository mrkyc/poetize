As I look around at all these smiling faces
I don't trust them, I've got no one to depend on

Ain't got nobody to depend on, no tengo nade
Don't need nobody but myself, can't trust nobody
Cuz everybody that I've trusted has done me wrong
No tengo nade, ain't got nobody to depend on

Some people make up lies staring you down and shed your name
Smiling faces all in my face but all this time wanna take my place
Give me the pat on the back then the stab in the back
Trying to hold me back now I'm back
All these fools talking smack, figure that
It's been this way since Junior High, everybody whispering shit
But like I said before jealous was never cool not even a little bit
I know you're phony, but who's the one who hit the scene when I was 16 with the bullet
I came this close to do it but I blew it, I was foolish
Kicking back on the corner smoking a j everyday
Some things never change, I'm still that way infact today
I got so blazed, it was so magnificent
First you saw it then you did it
Disappear like a magic trick with my magic sticks
Then I disappear in the smoke as you soak in your lies
Lil' Rob lighting up the sky like Fourth Of July
I can't believe myself, how I could subdue and just deceive myself

Mistakes, I know I made a few
But I'm only human, you made mistakes too
I crease my Levis one leg at a time just like you
But you wanna keep talking shit telling stories that are not true
Let's get it on, like a possom you try and cover your tracks
Cuz you'll be a rat like Donnie Brasco
Now and then I lose my way, feeling like I never knew my way
Thinking all those times that blew away, opportunities that I threw away
If I had wings I'd fly away, and I would do this night and day
Oh by the way I like to play from Saturday to Saturday
It doesn't matter ay, what you say
I was told don't let no one get you down and turn that frown upside down
See you can depend on me but I could never seem to depend on you
I try and look you in the face but then again I can't see two
What do I do? I'm so confused, someone's got to lose, I'd hate to be in your shoes
I'd probably be dressed in the county blues singing the blue to the things that I choose
Didn't I blow your mind this time? It was probably already blown
Ain't got no one to depend on homey
Lil' Rob, what am I on?


Everybody is somebody's fool, there's no exception to the rule
There's no guarantee that the one you love is gonna love you
But I refuse to be like I used to be, everybody using me
Watching over and schooling me, I know what they want to do to me
Only out to make a fool of me
Don't try to be schooling me please cuz I don't need to retire
Throwing dust in my eyes  and make me feel like everyone's dealing
I'm peeling too many cuz I'm the one that rocks steady
If you're not ready, get ready, fool this is it I've got plenty
And I won't stop, til I see that pretty penny, that's heavy
Just like a Chevy on twenties hitting switches
I'm hitting thirty nine inches and leaving you bitches in twitches
While all you snitches be snitching and wanna be burning down riches
I got you twisted like robes while I'm breaking down on your hoes
You make me laugh just like jokes, I fade away just like Ghost
You wanna turn you back on me pero, es tave
I got no one to depend on homey, no tengo nade
