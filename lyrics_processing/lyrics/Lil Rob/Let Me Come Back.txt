Let me come back (Come back...)
Bridge:
 I want you (Back)
I need you (Back)
I love you (Girl)
  Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
 I love you (Girl)
I want you (Back)
I need you (Back)
  Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh (Let me come back)
 I need you (Back)
I love you (Girl)
I want you (Back)
  Girl, let me come back
 I just can't (Can't)
Go on (Go on)
Without you (Girl)
  Just let me come back

(Verse 1)
Got kicked out of my girl's pad, it's too bad I deserved that
But I did
I popped off at the mouth like a kid
And I'd not think about the consequences of how it would make her feel
And why I made her feel like that, when she loves me for real
For real, that's the right deal
I love her, too
But you could probably never tell
By the way she was spoken to
And the way that I treated her
She don't need that
Especially
When she takes care of me
When I'm needing her
I need her now, she ain't around, I'm feeling down
And I feel like I'm losing my mind
We're together
All the time, I can't stand the separation
Why would I wanna cause her all this aggrevation
It's a frantic situation
Now I'm waitin' and I'm wishin'
Hopin' that she'd give me a call
I keep on thinking that my phone is ringing, who am I kidding
It isn't ringing at all
Yeah {Just let me come back...}

Baby, I'm sorry
Didn't mean to hurt you
It'll never happen again (No)
I know I said the same thing last time
But now I'm askin', "Will you give me one last try"
Let me come back now
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
Girl, let me come back now
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
Just let me come back (Come back...)
(Verse 2)
She told me that I broke her heart, I know I said some things
Lo siento
I said a lot of things I didn't mean
I was mean and cold hearted
My heart's been broken since we parted
She set me straight on April 14, 2008
And I'm a fly straight...
Like an arrow
Because I love you, mija
Yo te quiero...
You're my chica
Let me come back now
I need to be, back in your life
Like
Right now
I'm really feelin' the pain, this loneliness is a
Bitch
It's driving me insane (Insane)
What did I do (What did I do)
Look what I've done
How could I do this to you, when you're the one
I realized and I apologized, hey baby
I just really wanna come back
I love you so much
Yeah
Just tell me you still love me back
Take me back {Just let me come back...}
Repeat Chorus
Repeat Bridge with variations

Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh ("Fi-fi-fi-Fingazz on the track")
Just let me come back (Come back...)
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
Just let me come back (Come back...)
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
Just let me come back (Come back...)
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
Just let me come back (Come back...)
Just let me come back (Come back...)
