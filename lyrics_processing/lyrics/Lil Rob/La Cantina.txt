Hey, what's up man
Ha ha
Nah, last night was the bomb, homie
Got fucked up, ey
But I woke up with this biggest fuckin' headache
Heh
Hungover like a fucking bitch
I'm never drinking again, homeboy
Ha
Yeah right
(Verse 1)
I usually wait til Sunday, to have my menudo
But it's
Saturday, and I woke up all crudo
I think I had one too many shots of tequila
Mira
I heard I made a toast to mi vida
Left a big tip
Mariachis took my grip
And the sad thing about it is I don't remember shit
Wait a minute
Bartender, can you pass me a limon
And a nice cold Tecate? Thank you
Simon
Anyways, yesterday was the bomb all night long
Getting drunk
Off my ass
Bottoms up
On the glass
Presidente
And Coke
1800's no joke
Had me feeling like I never felt before, so pour some more
Til I hit the floor or stumble out the door
And when the bar closes, it's time to hit
The liquor store
Drinking Tecates
Or de verdes mas fina
Taking shots of tequila
While I'm in la cantina

Let me get a round for everyone

(Verse 2)
I said I wouldn't drink no more, but this
Can't be true
Cause it's not, even noon and I already had two
One with my menudo
And one during the break
You want me to promise that I won't drink, but that's a promise I can't make
Still sufferin', hungover from the night before
But the only way to fix it is to drink some more
So did I?...
But of course, what you think;
I'm sittin' at the bar in front of beers and I won't drink?
You gotta be kidding me, the buzz is hitting me
Gots me feeling light-headed
I'm headed to the park, where the homies spark
But they had some pisto there tambien
A couple twelve-packs that they jacked
I'm feeling like there ain't no end
Cause everywhere I go, there's alcohol til I fall
It's seven o'clock
But will I make it to last call
Hey homie, you vatos gonna be here for a while?
If so, I'll see ya
But if not, you know where I'll be homie
The cantina
Chorus: Lil' Rob
Sitting in the cantina

Let me get a round for everyone
Jose Cuervo, 1800, til the bottle's done x2
(Verse 3)
Back in the cantina
Sippin' my cerveza
It's gonna be the same way as last night holmes, I bet ya
Primos and friends, from one end to the other end
The wicked, wicked wino
Is getting drunk again
Stumblin'
I'm wasted
And it shows
It wouldn't be suprised if later on, I'm throwin' blows
Cause that's the way it goes
And everybody knows
But I'll just relax
And go with the flow
Bartender, I'm ready for another shot and won't stop
Until I drop
Or until somebody calls the cops
My primo picked me up off the floor
And said, "I think
You've had a little bit too much to drink, I don't think you should drink anymore"
Dragging my body up the hill to mi canton
The bar's five minutes away, but it took me an hour to get home
I've learned my lesson
Rule number one of the cantina
Don't mix cerveza
With tequila
Chorus: Lil' Rob
Sitting in the cantina
A Latino
Con ojos como un chino
Downing the tequila
Mira bartender
Let me get a round for everyone
Jose Cuervo, 1800, til the bottle's done x2

You know every weekend, I say "I'm never gonna drink again"
But I'm always going back to the cantina
With mi familia
Ha ha
I've got somethin' to tell all of you
Never mix cerveza, with tequila
I'm warning you
