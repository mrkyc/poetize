I'm feelin' good (Feelin' alright tonight)
I'm feelin' good now (Yeah)
It's all good in the neighborhood, holmes, haha, yeah
Lil Rob
I feel good, I feel alright
Cruisin' through my neighborhood on a warm summer night
I feel good, that's right
I feel good now (Somethin' about these summer nights)

(Woah) Summer days just sittin' around
But when the sun goes down
I'll be ready to party (Woah, hey)
Ain't nothin' like them summer nights
Keep the top on drop, all the girls lookin' hot
Hit the bolo and we just don't stop
Party until the mornin' light (Woah)
Ain't nothin' like them summer nights

I just kicked it at home, I polished up the chrome
Called the ruca on the phone, let her know I'm home alone
It's 7:30 and the sun's goin' down
It's a summer night and the fun's goin' down
I pick her up and she looks all dolled up (She look good)
Sittin' passenger in my rag Impala (Yeah)
I let her know that she looks beautiful to me
The world's an ugly place, but she is such a sight to see
The kind of woman that would put up a fight for me
The kind that wants to spend her summer nights with me
The temp was eighty and I'm cruisin' with my lady
Playin' some Ralfi Pagan, ooh, baby, baby
I see my homeboys and they're cruisin' in their ride (Hey, wassup holmes?)
With their ladies sittin' by their side
People think we look crazy, but I think we look classy
But then again, that's only if you ask me
You might also like
(Woah) Summer days just sittin' around
But when the sun goes down
I'll be ready to party (Woah, hey)
Ain't nothin' like them summer nights
Keep the top on drop, all the girls lookin' hot
Hit the bolo and we just don't stop
Party until the mornin' light (Woah)
Ain't nothin' like them summer nights

My homeboys throwin' a backyard boogie, so everybody
Gets together to unwind, relax and have a fun time
The DJ's spinnin', so I grab the mic and be like
"Ain't nothin' like them summer nights"
The party's packed with beautiful women
And the gang of the homies that wanna get with 'em
And they'll say anything just to hit 'em
And it's usually a nice summer night when they did 'em
I don't know, it must be something in the air
Can't help but have a good time because the feelin' is there
To some people, the feelin' is rare
They're at the pad sayin', "God damn, I wish I was there"
To have a drink, have a toke and hook up
With someone fine, but the kind that looks up
Gotta keep some pisto in the cup
Party until the sun comes up or we give up
(Woah) Summer days just sittin' around
But when the sun goes down
I'll be ready to party (Woah, hey)
Ain't nothin' like them summer nights
Keep the top on drop, all the girls lookin' hot
Hit the bolo and we just don't stop
Party until the mornin' light (Woah)
Ain't nothin' like them summer nights

Them summer nights can keep a smile on your face
Gotta try to have a good time with this life, otherwise it's just a waste
Either way, I'm gonna party just in case
Like Prince partied like it was '99 in '87, '88
I couldn't ask for no better weather
I'm right next to the Pacific, to be specific
The candy paint job glows under the moonlight
As I close out my summer night and say goodnight
It's time to put the top up and park it
Drop it, unplug the ground, roll up the windows and lock it
Walk in the pad and fall into bed
As she lays on my chest to rest her sleepy head
And we do this all night long, from dusk 'til dawn
But it's not quite the same when summer nights are gone
But even when they're gone, it won't be long
Eight more months, then once again it's on
(Woah) Summer days just sittin' around
But when the sun goes down
I'll be ready to party (Woah, hey)
Ain't nothin' like them summer nights
Keep the top on drop, all the girls lookin' hot
Hit the bolo and we just don't stop
Party until the mornin' light (Woah)
Ain't nothin' like them summer nights
