Things use to knock me down
But now I got the strength
And not from just liftin' weights
From having way to much food upon my plate
And going through the bull shit
I thought I couldn't escape
Thinkin' to myself how much more can I take
Before I take this 38' and blow out my brains
So I no longer feel the pain
Or maybe overdosing injecting somethin' in my veins
Damn it's kinda crazy right?
The things we think about
Coming from this crazy life
I went through things, and it hurt
But I bounced back and got back to work

Now every time I fall down imma just get up
Imma do it real big, imma do it tough
Cause I got a second chance to do it all again, 
When ever I fell, imma just brush it off
Get some fresh air
It ain't really nothin' lost
Cause I got a chance to do it all again, 
You might also like
I still got quite the journey
Everything I've learned
A lot of ups and downs. And just as many turns
But I like being on this earth
So imma live my life and what it's worth
Some thing you just gotta brush off
And get the bad people out your life and tell em fuck off
And not to come back
Cause we don't need that
We're on a different path and people just don't see that
It's beyond the comprehension I'm guessin'
Till that day comes that they learn their lesson
I been through things and it hurt
But I bounced back and got back to work

Now every time I fall down Imma just get up
Imma do it real big, Imma do it real tough
Cause I got a second chance to do it all again, 
Whenever I fell Imma just brush  off
Get some fresh air
It ain't nothin' lost
Cause I got a second chance to do it all again 

Sometimes things, aren't always what they seem
You needa keep on chasing your dreams
You never know what tomorrow may bring 
But I do know I'm not a quitter
And I'm far from a beginner
I'm not a loser so I strive to be a winner
Do what it takes to get through where I get to
You can try to knock me down but I won't let you
Do what it takes to get through where I get to
Imma hold my ground and this I bet you
I been through things and it hurt
But I bounced back and got back to work

Every time I fall down imma just get up
Imma do it real big imma do it real tough
Cause I got a second chance to do it all again, 
Whenever I fell Imma just brush it off
Get some fresh air
It ain't really nothin' lost
Cause I got a second chance to do it all again,
