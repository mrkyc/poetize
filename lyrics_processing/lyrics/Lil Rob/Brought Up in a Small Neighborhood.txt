Hey what's happenin'?
It's your homeboy Lil Rob
Back with some more shit
You know I cruise my low riders
But I just can't find nothing to cruise to you know?
What happen to the good music?
All that oldies shit
Well this ones going out to everybody low riding
And need something to cruise to wacha

All you vatos take note, Lil' Rob ain't no joke
So wacha, Jump in my six-three Impala
Put down the top as I pull to the stop
Drop, roll, never can be too low
Simon I got low riders, hundred spoke wires
White wall tires four pumps jumps it higher
Than anything you've ever seen
Fucking mean fucking clean
Can't drive too fast or swerving
Slipping and dipping, that's what we call it
That's what you do when you've got Hydraulics
I sea-saw it front back side to side pancake it
We don't fake it ese we just take it
Don't try to jack it bullet holes in your jacket
From my semi-automatic
What you thought ese we ain't got no pride?
Get ready to learn how we ride on the Southside

Got a Bombita, 4'9 Troqita
C-H-E-V-R-O-L-E-T- you don't know?
Forty-five player for all my oldies
Forty-five double M for all them phonies
Gots corner windows and the three fifty
Pedal to the metal I can take off like quickly
Shit I could smoke 'em like my pistola
Like a Lil' Rob Rola my Troqa's the bomba
Naw it ain't painted, homes it's just primer
Black with some thirteens and a sun visor
It still looks mean though, it still looks clean though
See it on the website I'm drinking with my primo
W-w-w dot Lil' Rob dot com, I can cruise all day
And cruise all night long, from sun down til sun up
I'll cruise my troqa, I'm a lowrider, I told ya, I told ya

Simon!

Got a big body, F-L-double E-T double U
Double O D 1993 caddy
Extended A-Arms cause homes I play hard
Hop my carucha hopping down the boulevard
Bumping some zapp jams, oldies or rap jams
Ralphy Pagan, S.O.S. or some yap bands
I'm the outstanding that's why they can't stand me
Three wheel standing hopping with smooth landings
Four racks a four-ton the more bounce the more fun
Keeping drinks in my ride if you bring em in guaranteed to spill some
I won't stop til I catch my trunk up on fire
Keep on hopping till I pop a tire
Pass the wire, and let it be known
I'll pay the chrome bill before I pay the phone
And that's when you know, that you're a lowrider
Got pride in my ride everybody else just admires
