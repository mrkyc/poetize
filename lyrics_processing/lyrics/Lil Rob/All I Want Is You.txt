Hey where do I begin
At a loss for words
With so much to say it happened
Never imagined
That I could feel this way
I can't wait to kiss your lips today
I wanna get lost in your eyes
Like I did yesterday
And I don't know what it is
But I love what you're doing to me
You do it good baby obviously
You're so real baby
You're so deep
I love the way you think
I respect the way you speak
I respect the way you carry yourself
I love the way you look
And how you take care of yourself
You're flawless from head to toe
And the best part about is
You act like you don't even know
You're just my style
You make me smile
Make me wanna live
To see tomorrow wow
You make me better
Now I'm better than ever
There ain't nothing like the times
When we're together
We can do whatever
You might also like
Baby I've been acting crazy
And haven't been myself lately
But this I want you to know

I wrote this song
The one I'm thinking of
I wanna use our body's
To let our minds make love
You're like a drug
And baby I've been fiening for you
Been thinking of you
And all the things that we do
Been dreaming of you
I love the way that you are
Believe in all you say
And do i know you're gonna go far
And I'm proud of you too
I know that I've been a fool now
I surrender to you
Like to be together with you
Do whatevers clever with you
Life is too short
Forever I can spend it with you
I wanna get to know your body
Your heart and your soul
Like i know my own
Knowing all there is to know
Baby you're so captivating

If you like not only physical
But mental love making
Baby I've been acting crazy
And haven't been myself lately
But this I want you to know
