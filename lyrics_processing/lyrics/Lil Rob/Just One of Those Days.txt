Yeah
It's just one of those
Days
Where everything's all good in the neighborhood, man
Know what I'm talkin' about
(Verse 1)
It's just one of those
Days, I'd say about
Seventy-eight degrees (Yeah, it's a nice day, man)
You can feel and see the breeze
Rough, the lenght of the trees
I hold the Pacific
I feel and look terrific
Hittin' switches, in a classic Chevy Impala, watch me tip it (It's just one of those days...)
The sun is shinin'
And it couldn't be brighter
I'm rollin' down valley in Cali
In a candy lowrider (In the candy lowrider)
Little kids on bicicletas
Lickin' on paletas
That they got
From the ice cream man, the summertime connecta (It's just one of those days...)
On the way to the parke, where my homeboys kick it {*whistling*}
I seen them juras drive by, but they ain't trippin'
It's all good in my neighborhood and it feels good to be alive
It's just
One of those days that makes you wanna die
You might also likeChorus: Lil Rob
It's just one of those days
It makes me wanna just get up and go
Get, pressed, fresh, dressed and I'm out the door (It's just one of those days...)
Jump in my 6-3, hit the juice on my ride
Sportin' white, Cortezes, with the swish on the side
It makes me wanna just get up and go
Get, pressed, fresh, dressed and I'm out the door
The sun is shinin'
And I love it that way
I can't help, but feel good, it's just one of those days (It's just one of those days...)
(Verse 2)
Those
Days, (???) hangin' off the telephone wires
Chavalitos, on the swing sets, seeing who could swing higher (Yeah)
And there's a smile, on everybody's face
There's nobody diein' (Nobody diein')
So nobody's cryin' (Nobody's cryin')
Cause the tears, no, not a single trace (It's just one of those days...)
The girls are groovin', prettied up with a smile
Ain't no other man like the shit, I'm likin' the style (Hell yeah)
The sun's out
And I'm out and about
Lovin' the weather
It couldn't be better (Hell naw)
And that's
Without a doubt (It's just one of those days...)
We can cruise
And find a place to chill and relax
And tilt some cold ones back seat, I like shit like that (I like shit like that)
Shit
I wouldn't have it any other way
Homies bumpin' that south in the back and relax in this kind of day
Repeat Chorus
(Verse 3)
Backyard boogies and barbecues
Packed with a lot of fools (Yeah)
A lot of heinas too (Hell yeah)
A lot of food and a lot of booze (Mm hmm)
It's just somethin' we do
On a day like this one
Old school music bumpin', thumpin' out the system (Yeah)
Beautiful women
Line 'em up and I'll pick one
Probably
Go get a quick one, come back and we'll twist one
I can't change my evil ways, but (Change my evil ways)
What can I say
I likes to play, I can't help it, it's just one of those days
