I Do It For Me I Do It For You
I Wanna Buy You A Range I Wanna Buy You Too
I Wanna Buy Us A Pad With A Front And A Backyard
So Im Taking These Beats, And Im Spitting Them Hard
I Know That I've Been Away But Im Rappin Away
And I'm Doing Things The Way I Did Back In the Day
No Way I'd Do It For Us
Cuz Us Is A Must
And I Always Think About Us Every Time That I Bust
People Will Talk Like They Always Do
But They Have No Clue How I Feel When I'm Wit You
No Need To Call Me A Sin
Cuz A Sin For Your Not
I'll Just Take Care Of Her Smile And Simply Love What I Got
