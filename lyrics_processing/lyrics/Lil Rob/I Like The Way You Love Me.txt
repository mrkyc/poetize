I saw you kicking back down the block, you stole my breath
I couldn't talk, couldn't walk, couldn't breathe
Please don't leave, you might be the one I need
Hopefully we'll talk eventually
Do you mention me when you talk to your friends?
Oh, how I hope you do
I wanna get close to you, do notice me?
Notice you, love everything you do
I don't even know you, but I want to
Do you want me? 'Cause I want you
And I'll do what I got to
Every time I dream, it's about you

Whether you thrill me to my soul
And I Like it, I Like it oh so
