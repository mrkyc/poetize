What's up mija
I was wondering if maybe I could stop by
And pick you up tonight

Shine up the wingtips throw on the Zoot Suit
Jump in the Bomba complete with the moonroof
Pick up my lady and kick it with her all night
We look up and we could see the rain fall right
Down on the glass, we can't see the splash
We're cruising slow forget fast
You see a vato like me takes my time
I'm dressed to impress and my hyna's lookin fine
She loves me, I love her and everything is right
It's the Pachuco's night
I got the 45 player under the dash
In the ashtray I got some marijuana ash
I got the .45's in the glove
She throws on "Natural High" and says it's time to make love
I said damn mija yo te quiero mucho con todo mi corazon
She said mijo I'm glad that we're alone
Because it's time I confess how i feel
She said mijo I love you and I said baby I'm for real
It's the Pachucos night
It's the Pachucos night
You might also like
You know mija there ain't nothin I'd rather do
Than to spend a little time with you
'Cause you're my lady and I love you
{Chorus:}
Stay right here baby (stay right here baby)
I'm not ready to let you go, ahha yeah
Stay right here baby, ahha yeah
So I could love you and love you forever

I'm kicking back with my lady
But still some vatos rolled up
Where you from holmes?
I'm thinking to myself don't act dumb holmes
Could pull the cuete cause I never leave home without it
But would that prove anything? ey, holmes I doubt it
Vatos actin up I didn't say nothing but I stared
They call me a chavala but hey I didn't care
Time to go on roll on catch em on the rebound
Some may call me a wrecker
Some might say that proves I'm down
Or got respect for the woman that I'm with
Cause if she wasn't with me you know I'd do it with the quickness
You see I handle things in the right way
It's me and my ruca, no need to pull out the fusca
Can't let them ruin my night so I drive off in the rain
She said mijo you're the best and so I told her the same
I grab her leg and tickle it as she laughs and yells stop
When I only stop to start all over again
You must've put a spell on my mind
You're my genie and my lover
And i wish that you would make our time stand still
Chills and thrills is what you give me
Everytime that I'm next to you
I'm so glad I found the best with you
A dream come true is me and you
A Pachuco's night doing what lovers like to do
And mija you're the only woman that can drive me crazy
A Pachucos night just me and my lady
{Chorus}
Stay right here baby (stay right here baby)
I'm not ready to let you go, ahha yeah
Stay right here baby, ahha yeah
So i could love you and love you forever

I've got to, got to let you know who you are
I wanna take you home with me
And you will see that you love me and I love you
Lucky cause it's no fun being lonely
But with me you'll never have to be the lonely one
Cause you're my hyna
And you best believe the only one
She whispered in my ear come here
You're the only man I'll ever need
Because you've always been right there for me
Two hearts joined as one
Having fun on what I call my Pachucos night
My night ain't done
Until you come on and go with me
Over to my place and make love between the sheets
That's where our bodies meet
Te gusto mucho this Pachuco's gonna love ya
Because I can't seem to get enough of ya
Because mija you're the one that's droppin spells
It's me and my lady and the Sharilles
*{This is dedicated to the one I love}*
Let me lay you down
Let me make you feel just like you should
In other words mija let me make you feel real good
She's lookin firme so her body I caress
She said "desvistame" and so I help her undress
And it's like I love need and want you baby
It's time to get crazy
{Chorus}
Stay right here baby (stay right here baby)
I'm not ready to let you go, ahha yeah
Stay right here baby, ahha yeah
So i could love you and love you forever
Stay right here baby, ahha yeah
Stay right here baby, ahha yeah
Stay right here baby, ahha yeah
Stay right here baby, ahha yeah
