{*inhale*}
{*coughing*}

What's up?
Lil' Rob
Back on my own
The way it should be
The only way that it can be
Let's take to the sky (Let's take to the sky...)
(Verse 1)
Pack my pipa full of grifa
Just like my woman
I could never leave her, cheat her, need her
So I take a puff {*inhale*}
And another puff {*inhale*}
Exhale, then I take a breather {*exhale*}
Cause I'll take my time and do it right
I know where I'll be tonight
Cloud number nine in my mind
Feelin' fine
This is mine
You wanna get high, well come back another time
When you really wanna fly
Cause I plan to take it to the point
Where I don't know my name
Won't even know where I'm at, but want to come back
To this place
Where I sit
I rather get lit til I take a hit
Prepare for lift
In the pipe
Or a spliff, I hit it swiff, God's gift
To this world, got me in a twirl, in a whirl
Everything I see is plural
I'm just blazin'
Hallucinatin'
And I can't
Lie, smokin' crepe au chocolate tye
Lemon teardrops fallin' from my eye
Take to the sky, on my natural high
Til the day I die

Take to the sky on a natural high
Loving you more til the day I die
Take to the sky on a natural high
Loving you more
(Verse 2)
I can smoke it on my own
Leva, leave me alone
I'm in my zone
Stoned to the bone
Me
In the dark
Sittin' in the park
Forgettin' everything that hurts my heart
So I spark another joint, what's the point?
Escape
From reality
Into a fantasy
That sensuality
Feel the passion
When the smoke is passin'
Everlastin' type of bud
When I smoke my buds
Takes me to a place
Smile upon my face
Cause she sets me free
From the things I see
Let me be somebody, hear my plea, it's only me
I'd rather be lonely
Roll it on my own
Cause I hold my own
Toke it on my own
Used to think of dyin', now I think of flyin', like I've never flown
Spread my wings and fly, why lie, it's
Something that I can't deny
Take to the sky, on my natural high
Til the day I die
Chorus: Vocal Bizz
Take to the sky on a natural high
Loving you more til the day I die
Take to the sky on a natural high
Loving you more
(Verse 3)
Life is like a maze
Gots me in a craze
So I hide away in marijuana's maze
Change my evil ways, stayin' half a day
Captured in the rapture, love the way she plays
Gots me feelin' weariness, dizziness
Love it when I feel like this, I'm real like this
Smokin' all this flavored shit
It's time to call it quits
But once again, my lighter flicks
And I take another puff {*inhale*}
Just can't get enough
Of this happiness
Smoking canibus
Devotion to my potent potions' what I've chosen {*exhale*}
Love it when my time is frozen
Gots me in that motion like I'm close to floatin'
Takin' to the sky
When I want to fly
And I'm
Sittin' on My Cloud like Joe Bataan
Don't stop now, like Ralfi Pagan
And I'm gone
It's the wicked, slick and sly, type of guy, with
Somethin' that you can't deny
Take to the sky, on your natural high
Til the day you die
Chorus: Vocal Bizz
Take to the sky on a natural high
Loving you more til the day I die
Take to the sky on a natural high
Loving you more

Oh, oh
Lil' Rob
Roll me another
Mmm
Feels so good up in my chest
No stress
When I'm smokin' on Mary Jane
Oooh, she's calling my name
Ain't no doubt about it
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Take to the sky
Chorus: Vocal Bizz
Take to the sky on a natural high
Loving you more til the day I die
Take to the sky on a natural high
Loving you more

Take
To the sky
