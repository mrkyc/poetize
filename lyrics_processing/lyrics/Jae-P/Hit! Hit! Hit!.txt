Down on my dick
Ain't have shit
Ain't give me a inch
Had a lil swag
But ain't have no bag
Ain't even have a bitch
But I don't need no hoe
Need me a lick
Pull up on Slugg
He got the clips
I got the drums
Let's make a
HIT HIT HIT
Now I think about Cap
And I thumb through it quick
Keep me a natural nasty as it get
Pull up disaster
I'm dumping the stick
Empty his bladder
But I be the shit
I'm from Atlanta
Where everybody rich
Everything slime
So watch who you with
Get left behind
And found in a ditch
So if you're on my side make it permanent
Call up Lil Took Took
He a fool with 40 like surgery
Gone and cut off your ears you ain't heard of me
Young nigga balling done fucked up the league
Young boy be rapping like Christmas Eve
Somewhere relaxed under Mullah Trees
So if you want smoke
I can get you beef
Remember when we ain't have nun to eat
You might also likeI was out bad
Down on my dick
Ain't have shit
Ain't give me a inch
Had a lil swag
But ain't have no bag
Ain't even have a bitch
But I don't need no hoe
Need me a lick
Pull up on Slugg
He got the clips
I got the drums
Let's make them
HIT HIT HIT
Gone and pull on P
It's a movie
Go bananas I keep a lil uzi
Where's my manners
Treat her like a groupie
Trap her out
Now she whipping up Susie
Beat her back
Send her right back to dude
Im a savage
But ain't nothing new
Im a stepper
Way bigger than you
I'm a winner
Everything to lose
Call up Lil Took Took
He super cool with taking all your shit
That boy artist with the four fifth
Push up to the party
Leave your potna lit
Sorry I ain't sorry
But a lunatic
Still a hot boxing in a brand new whip
Got you bitch sliding on me
In my brand new drip
Know I'm Top 5
Better not let me live
Cause I was out bad
Down on my dick
Ain't have shit
Ain't give me a inch
Had a lil heart
But that don't pay rent
It ain't bout your start
But how you end
Just play your part in this game you gone win
Real big dreams when your chance so slim
Now here we are put a seven in the wind
When you this high you got to reminisce
I was out bad
Down on my dick
Ain't have shit
Ain't give me a inch
Had a lil swag
But ain't have no bag
Ain't even have a bitch
But I don't need no hoe
Need me a lick
Pull up on Slugg
He got the clips
I got the drums
