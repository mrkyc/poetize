I keep a bad bitch around me
She say I'm so lucky that you found me
I step into your ocean, I'm not waving, im drowning
Nigga tryna P90X, boy you better walk it off, go jogging with yo bitch
She chose my dick over a relationship
You let her roll the weed nigga, I let her roll 'round in the bed
Hot sugar, cold shoulder, I walk past ya, hot, cold, Punk Hazard
Ay what it's hidden for sucker, slow talking
Parents home had to fuck in the trap, soft ghetto
Watch yo ass fizzle out, fuck with young lil fizz
High talking to ya 'bout death the kid lil bitch
I hate that you always moving ahead but i love the way you make it stand still

Baby girl don't act like you just met me, you must be tryna forget me
Who else will get you wet off of DM, I know that's sex to ya memory
Feeling like i got world against me, laying with the wrong girl up against me
Pull up hear my music out front, tell mama you'll be back
I hit it from the front then i hit it from the so

Take it back ho
Take it back ho
Take it back ho
Take it back ho
Now run it back bitch
Run it back bitch
Run it back bitch

Girl stop playing why you keep touchin on me
My side bitch used to live in the bay, right around the corner from the k
You super save a ho you need a cape
I got real Bruce Wayne with yo ho in D.C
Two phone coach carter, put ya bitch on my team
Marinate salt water twist the sprite with Alpharma
Remember who let you deflowered I'm Kurama
Ain't I, ain't I, ain't I right?
Even when my eyes redder than this late ass flight
Touch down look around the city ain't nothing changed
From the look you always gave me til the way that you came
I did ya wrong , you're all that i want
Couldn't grant my wish, I'm beefing with Shenron
You called it off but i know what you're on
Cause the dick long, it's Robb Bank$ song
