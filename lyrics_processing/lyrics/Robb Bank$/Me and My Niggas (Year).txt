My niggas go to sleep on Tuesday, wake up on Sunday
My hoes sing the Weeknd in the shower
After they take dick on Hump Day
I got money in my pocket, lacing that swisher
Sipping on tussin, regretting my high
What a looker in that see through lace
Won't take her shades off
But if she did I bet she'd give me that eye
Bought us tickets to fly to Cairo
Now I'm swerving through the potholes
Pillow talk secrets with tricks
All because they was all models
And I love how your complexion turn gold in the light
But her white girls fun
All because they all swallow
Racial profiling, I love where this talk's going
So keep boring me until I let you know
The Champagne's unfrozen
And she ain't got no Three 6 in her Herbie so to pass the time
Best believe I'll be counting the freckles on this Lohan
Die slow fuck boy, it's like that
My nigga say throw some nugs in it
While I freak, the black
And if you close your eyes it makes the experience sweeter
Purposely roll up a blunt she starts playing Khalifa
You might also like
If you and your bitches wanna ride with my niggas
Get high with my niggas, puff loud with my niggas
Me and my niggas you know we smoking that Haze
Me and my niggas wanna slide with your bitches
Wanna vibe with your bitches, wanna ride with your bitches
You and your bitches, you know that you bout getting slayed
(Watch your bitch, I'mma scoop that up)

Set up at that 27 Club
So I stay getting so fucked up and you watching me
I got one life to live full of self-fulfilling prophecies
Chasing my high
I think they call that irrational, there's no stopping me
Obviously I'mma do my thing, acting so obnoxiously
I got your girl sitting pretty in an Aston Martin
On our way to Baskin Robins, In Autumn mid August, riding through Gotham
Hoping that this weed gonna' solve all our problems
Cause dawg, I got no solution
And I don't think it comes from these drugs I'm using
Abusing, and I don't even know what I'm doing
I'm Warhol, he's Basquiat
Make your girl say that's the spot
When she grab my brush, and she paint that box
Got a little smudge up on her smock
I only bring hoes to the finest, 5-star
Everything hotels, dining, day spas
I don't rock Play Clothes, I rock FourStar
I don't go to Dayglow, take your girl to Cape Cod
Like ight' then, peace, one, bye!
Woke up on Tuesday went to sleep on a Sunday
Fuck a Monday we call that bunday funday
We live our lives one day and that be straight high
Just wrote a screenplay the dialogue's in our mind
And I don't want the check
I just want the fame and I don't need these hoes
I just want them to know my name

Yeah grew up so fast, never seen our lives change
