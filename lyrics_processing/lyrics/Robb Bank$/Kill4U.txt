Uh, uh, uh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You make me feel so good
Fuck me
Sure

Suck that dick, I ain't playin'
Walk into your house with the pistol in my pants
Me and yo' neighbor got into it way in the past
I still risked it all just to lay up again
Whoa, ho, toe she rollin' up the ice off the panties
(I think I might be happy)
You can be the ocean that a nigga come and splash in
That bitch, you must be approached
Shawty let me lick you slow, girl take it to the floor
Yeah, you know ya man a ho, so
Girl, we could keep all this shit low
Just look me in the eyes when I take yo' soul
And you got a couple things that you can't let go
Bitch, you don't even know what you came here for
Just know, you on go, take all that nigga poison
You could be everything that a nigga wanted
Bitch, I'ma be there whenever yo' ass call
I'll still kill for you, yeah, shawty, you should know this
You might also like
Yeah, girl, I know you know it

Put the spirit gun back in the holster
You can let that go, you know only
Only, only
Told you, going forward, know I keep it close
It ain't know trust with you, bitch, look you right in the face
Stay in yo' place, got decisions to make

I take a fuck nigga and sacrifice him (Sure)
16 wit' a Tumblr model drinking out the baby bottle
In the pussy where you would of found me (Be happy)
Savage know I got the racks, not a one man band
Name hands on like a fuckin' cast
Mark yo' bitch with my brain, gave some dick to a fan
And I sucked on the titties and smeared my autograph
Might fuck yo' bitch, all the muscle
Conceived on Tumblr and survived abortion
Dark skin Marilyn Manson, light skin prince of darkness
These hoes called me daddy since I was an orphan
And I still run the same course as the poison
Fuck the conforming, been this way since I was born
Doing 150, I magneto the Porsche
I push the album back, what's wrong with the force?

Do you think about me?
Do you think about me?
All the nights with the Xan with the lean
Do you think about me?
All the nights with the Xan with the lean
Do you think about me?
Do you think about me?
All the nights with the Xan with the lean
Xan with the lean, do you think about me?
Bitch, I know

I know, I know, I know it
I know, I know, I know it
