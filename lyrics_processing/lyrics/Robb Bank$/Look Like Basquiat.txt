Lil' bitch

My bathtub lift up, my walls do a 360
And you owe me 4 for that whole thang, that's 36 deep
I got yo bitch tryna spoon, I paint a picture with her hymen
She dress up like Sailor Moon for my excitement
Said "Wipe Me Down", I got a lot of money now, bitch
Said "Wipe Me Down", I got a lot of money now, bitch!
Nigga, get yo mind right, still got work on deck
Put you down with my connect if yo stocks right
Get tangible with that tangerine, break it down
So I can smoke it in the limelight, and I got a new bitch
We looking up at the stars, no ceiling like I'm tryna shoplift
In a candy-coated Van Gogh painted Lexus
Art school bitch love when I scoop her in that shit
When I talk, know that that's pimp shit mane
Blow sick smoke, smell like incense mane
Just bought a 5 and it grip my Hanes
And I put that on my momma like she Lisa Ann
It was flown overseas just to get sent to me
Hands stuck to my bitch tanlines while we at the beach
And I jumped yo homeboy, well sorry, bitch, I was on a bean
I got my bud and my woodgrain steering wheel
All from the Giving Tree, my nigga, fuck with me!
Well I got yo bitch, rubbing all on her clit in that oh-10
I recline my seat and pull out my shit
Shoot one on her hood like I'm Zimmerman
A handful of real niggas and I'm rolling with 'em bitch
Young nigga only growin' pains I got is in my dick
In the set with a redhead, battle to the death
Look like First Form Cell all the freckles on her chest
And I lay it all out, show 'em straight money so they know it's real
Robb Bank$ to the public, but to my Zo's I'm Jean-Michel
You might also like
I look like Basquiat, Basquiat
Bitch, I look like Basquiat, Basquiat
Basquiat, bitch, I look like Basquiat, Basquiat
These hoes on my dick, so I'm going hard in the paint
Me and Madonna got married and that heroin in my veins
And I whip my hair back and forth, go ask ya man if he straight
Just know I'm fresh off the Xan, tell that nigga
Give me something to paint, give me something to paint
Give me something to paint, lil bitch, give me something to paint
Give me something to paint

And I got bitches mixing my paint
And getting high off of the fumes
I'm taking bitches out on dates
And take them right back to my room
Room 69 at the Fountainebleau
Right before I smang me and her make a toast
Fucking bitches on my pottery wheel
Same skin tone as a motherfucking ghost
And I mix lemonade with that dirty
And I take one sip and I'm higher than a bitch
Pull out my dick and these hoes run
And get paper towels for they head like Jadakiss
Suck my dick, I'm out here nigga yelling "Suck my dick!"
Lohan told them niggas "Suck my dick!"
Mill told them fuck niggas "Suck my dick"
And I bet your bitch gonna wanna take a pic
When I throw on all of these diamonds
You see the accents when I'm shining
Like Keith Haring a set full of riders
And I'm riding through my city painting
On a pill painting all my sights in acrylics
Got a AR that play dubstep if you try to come for my skrilla
And I ain't tryna have no fuck niggas up in my region
My bitch and I made a smokescreen
And I'm coughing, and she wheezing
I look like Basquiat, Basquiat
Bitch, I look like Basquiat, Basquiat
Basquiat, bitch, I look like Basquiat, Basquiat
These hoes on my dick, so I'm going hard in the paint
Me and Madonna got married and that heroin in my veins
And I whip my hair back and forth, go ask ya man if he straight
Just know I'm fresh off the Xan, tell that nigga
Give me something to paint, give me something to paint
Give me something to paint, lil bitch, give me something to paint
Give me something to paint, lil bitch

Money
Hoes
Money
Hoes

And now I don't count no money, and I don't fuck no hoes
'Cause now I got an accountant, I'm never in town
So these bitches just gon' send nudes to my phone
And I'm out in the Bahamas, smoking wine milds in the grapevine
Paid off that villa, but I'm only there up in the daytime
And that's love to all of my Spring bitches
Kisses to my Margate hoes
Colgate for my incisors, platinum for my canines
And you bi niggas dressing in furs, like what the fuck?
Gotta rose gold wedding band, and she still wanna fuck
I could run a hot wheel down her curves
Still wanna fuck even though my bathroom is his and hers
My main bitch, she just got a new whip
Got her a baby Glock that tote right above her clit
Queen of my Sparta in them gladiator flats
Motherfucking real bitch, man, she keep it 300
But no sweet shit, don't dap me, I ain't Freddy
Straight like that, nigga, straight like that
WOBO hit it 'til I get to the plastic on the black boy
And all you niggas is tatted for no reason
Take it if you want it as a diss
You doing cover-ups, bitch
And I'm doing the same thing with my dermatologist
And if your lips touch my dick
Make sure that they filled with collagen
That's barbie, bitch, hit me if yo' ass want to menage again
And a bottle of that white Remy, got my words all slurred
And my hair getting longer, I'm Super Saiyan 3
Nigga, that's my word
My niggas, that's my word, nigga, that's my word
You niggas think you really fucking with me?
