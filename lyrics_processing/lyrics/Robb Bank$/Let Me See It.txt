Now let me see it, let me see it
Let me see it, let me see it
Let me see, let me see it
Bend over let me see it
Let me see it, let me see it
Let me see it, let me see it
Let me see, let me see it
Bend over let me see it

Girl talk to me, Baby tell me what you want from me
Before you put that pussy on me, girl do that little walk for me
We just fucking, fuck your assumptions
Say you done with me, I seen that coming
You don't text or call me, don't check on me
Don't flex on me, you don't love nothing
But do you know who give that good dick, that's right
Southern H.P. Sword Art Online
Pussy nigga why are you talking to me
Know your bitch been fucking with me, know your lame ass 
Momma fix her hair in the mirror
All this skill with no deal, I'm the fucking black reaper
Girl let it go, so sexual
Kiss you from neck to the breast, attached to your torso
Stroke game so feng shui, HBO softcore
Never had good dick, let me enlighten you for sure
And girl it must be meant to be, the way you keep running into me
You love that fairy tale shit, so strip before we go to eat
And now your friend ain't invited, don't bring that bitch around me
Cuz you gon' get her fucked, I told you bout the company you keep
You might also like

Thought I told you, I thought I told Y'all
Real nigga, bitch you know what it is
You don't want no pressure, boy your ass look scared
Pussy ass nigga, let your bitches play all in my hair
Oh she gookin, girl you're gookin, Cuz there's so much more to you
But you rather be on Tumblr doing fucking hair tutorials
Fuck your first and fuck your last, don't tell me you love your man
Don't pretend you was no fan, know I had you sleep off he Zan
While your fucking with that lame ass nigga 2 phone, 2 wicked
Boy my bitch think she is one fourth wicked
POVed with her, made a Blaire Witch Project
Word to broom, like the help I fucked the whole convent
Let me hear it, Lil bitch

If you know like I know you'd get down on the floor
I keep a magnum full of dank, I keep a swisha full of dro
We could get down for my diamond, or we could fuck on the low
And if you didn't want a pimp, then what you fucking me for
Every lady ain't a ho, and every ho ain't my bitch
It take a real savage nigga to recognize that type of shit
Every girl around me is legit, I don't fuck around with no punk
Ride wit me, she holdin' a pistol while she whipin', and poppin' the trunk
Always like you grown, girl you know your momma home
Hit my phone, hunter hunter, fuck your bitch then I'm gone
Still a pro on the dick, stop playing with a nigga
Cuz you know where I'm livin' and this codeine no chill liquor
Let me see it, let me see it
Let me see it, let me see it
Bend over let me it, let me see it
Bitch let me see it, let me see it
Let me see it, let me see it
Bitch let me see it, lil bitch let me see it
