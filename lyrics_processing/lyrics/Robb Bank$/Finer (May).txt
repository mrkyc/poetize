Pretty young nigga and I'm fresh out a relationship
Fresh off of vacation and I got bad girls trying to play with it
Once these hoes see what I'm about they say they love me
Dry martinis with the olives
Olive work pants with the rugby
Fresh jive swim trunks, my nigga Lansky taught me
Pam Grier look alike sipping on a chill coffee
And that violence state my thread count
TTS taking head count
That 6 day a week life
Seven head shots leave them red now
It's the antichrist
When I'm talking to your bitch I'm Dr. Dolittle
At the casino, table five, betting bills on games of Yu-Gi-Oh!
Got a milf in a midlife crisis down for what you want
I kill her daughter in my sheets Casey Anthony in my trunk
My nigga, I don't do no drugs, I just feed them to these women
Not slowing down they way of living, but passing out on the floor of my
Kitchen
And once we see that we twit picin'
Lighting sage, playing Sade
Record 'till Thursday get becky from Rebecca Black on Friday

Skinny young nigga and I'm finer than my bitch
All my niggas want the finer things, so that's how we gon' live
Uh, we doin' things you niggas probably only hear about
I bet yo' bitch tryna' slide once I let my hair down
Skinny young nigga and I'm finer than my bitch
All my niggas want the finer things, so that's how we gon' live
Uh, we doin' things you niggas probably only hear about
I bet yo' bitch tryna' slide once I let my hair down

We paid in full like Rakim and Allah though
Cop the jaguar in the middle of the car show
And I make all these new hoes tell you niggas how they done with yall'
My exes call me asshole my hoes call me Tumblr god
I post a pic of yo bitch and the last time we was out
So what if you got the weed you still can't weed us out
It's Orville Bank$ till I reside in that sarcophagus
Until then I'm pouring drink into my esophagus
No replacements but you niggas can't see that
Everything we say true, but you probably won't believe that
I can't smoke now, but my bitch finished the whole weed bag
While I'm sipping out the straw that you get with the tree wrap
I stay indifferent when these hoes say I'm on that different shit
Cause you niggas can't read me nor get past my penmanship
I'm with a shone you probably only seen on your dashboard, man
Bumpin Fat Pat pass the weed
And Houston's for the dinner date
Every time I bring you up she say stop it
She got her fingers through my plugs, and I got mine by her socket like

Skinny young nigga and I'm finer than my bitch
All my niggas want the finer things, so that's how we gon' live
Uh, we doin' things you niggas probably only hear about
I bet yo' bitch tryna' slide once I let my hair down
Skinny young nigga and I'm finer than my bitch

Ugh
What you thought you little bitch?
Tuesday through Sunday
Same shit
Still fuckin yo bitch ho
Stunt, stunt mhm
