Who got that lean
Who got that Xan
Who got that perc
Who got that gas
Who got that bean
Right on the strap
Who wanna aim
Right at they back
Who got all that
Who in the trap

Who can fuck you and go fuck your friend
You fuck it up again and again lil' bitch

I told yo bitch I want head first vibe ho please don't be bitter
Boy all these niggas looking bitter I pull up and I apply the pressure

Bitch I'm a beast, bitch I'm the goat
Got a zero, seen the C-Note
You not in my class, boy I'm self-taught
Come to Fo Block, you getting dropped off
Young Femto fucked these hoes like I'm in love
Still Klitschko, I can't hit without a glove
Laugh when I shoot
Hundreds they blew
Late night with that drum like the mofuckin Roots
And you know the phone
Know Babybone
Know Indigo
You know Kie Mo
You know Kiron
You know Iceman
You know Juiceman
Free Bam till I'm gone
And you know spread on em like baguette with the dough
Run up you get stomped, take your ass back to the post
(Boy check ya pulse)
I used to be standing on the streets with the nicks, slay a Princess off the armor
Invested so much into Fanta, I fucked the Fantana bitch outta commercials
Inside Sasuke, the outside Naruto, a nigga chakra flow Orochimaru
Hiraikotsu with the karma
Who the fuck want it with Madara, bitch

All these niggas just trying to get money when you catch 'em in person
Ran up my sack for the purge
