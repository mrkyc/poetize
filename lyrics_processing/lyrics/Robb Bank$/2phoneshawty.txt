Ayy, and you might catch me laughing
Spent summer with Nuri recording Year Of The Savage in a mansion
I stunt like my daddy, two hundred dollar Fanta
Y'all bitch made, I spit game, PaRappa the Rapper
You going backwards, I don't get it
Can't remember the last time I didn't get mentioned
Y'all know who it is and I'm on bond, bitch
Im like that ugly ass joint in my whip, sick and I'm twisted
That's expected from the contender
I'm the three time champ, still competing against myself
Aye these niggas get upset, talk amongst theyselves
Forget we started at the same time but I ain't never ask for help
Not to mention, yo' bitch keep textin'
Keep covering your nipples in these pictures
We cannot further this friendship
Black twitter veteran, bleeding hearts club membership
New prejudice, y'all confederate, yachts like a slave ship
No need for emancipation
And that pussy so good deserve a letter of recommendation
What you sayin' I never been the one to play with
I still shoot the shit like meaningless conversation
Me and the actress who do the voice of Sakura started dating
And Sam from Totally Spies became my booking agent
Satan do my PR, my manager is God
I'm hittin' J's in the elevator like Solange
I come from a time, where the wave that washed ya'll niggas up
In this bitch first, made the water ripple, I become one with nature
I'll align the stars, just to make sure that I get the pussy from her
Boy, and none of my niggas feel you, plain and simple
If I say kill em, someone gonna kill em
Indigo kill em, Pou kill em, Neil gone kill em
Two M's next to 6 like Margiela
I had a prom where we were supposed to feel ya, bitch
I'm still a wobo nigga, 44s in a motherfuckin' four door nigga
Dertbag polo nigga, in the city dolo nigga
A few crumbs try to act like the whole slice
I could smell the yeast on ya clit nigga
When you see that lex pull up to the farm store, shit
You know exactly who the fuck it is nigga

Ice cold baby, let me rub a cube on ya
I run it, the track can feel like Colombine high school
I poured a pint In a tub, breathtaking, bruh
Put a out of town bitch on oxygen that's bad girls club
And they watch me they love me, keep up with my moves
Follow what I do, but who the fuck is you
Can't remember the last time a bitch asked for my name
I listened to ya mixtape and felt like I was gettin' pranked, ayy
Swear I done fucked bitches realer than these niggas
You bought a gun to take pictures, I hold a tommy, Didi pickles
And we wit' it, why you think we flow too much, chakra
I look 'round Broward, I ain't even know I made these clones
Bitch I'm war ready like I got on my old clothes
I was just on yo' front porch when I dropped off yo ho
Yo new girl she so-so, I don't bunk with the piper
Get snatched, bars, for these pussies, orange is the new black

Let me stab it on the plastic like Dexter
Fucking on ya grand-mama couch, yeah I can work the camera
High school, I used to do the morning announcements
And I already done the counting, fuck you talkin' 'bout bitch
Flexing in that pussy while I pan it to the left
I'm a movie buff, boy, you too nuff, call 911
Foreign bitch call 119, boy, I make Molly call 365
Ten five percent, swing the bottle with your ex
Eyes on everybody else paper like a test
Only Skin Head with a fucking re-twist
