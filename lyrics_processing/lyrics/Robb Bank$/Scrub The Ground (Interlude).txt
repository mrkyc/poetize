Oh yeah
God I hope she suck my dick tonight
Oh yeah

We got all the time in the world
But bad bitches don't break curfew
You see her in that Panamera pumpkin
Louboutin glass slippers for my Cinderella
Dirty girl clean up so good
Dirty girl clean up so good
Dirty girl clean up so good
Cinderella clean up so good that I say-

Scrub the ground
Scrub the ground
Let me hear you say
Scrub the ground
Scrub the ground
Let me hear you say
Scrub the ground
Scrub the ground
Let me hear you say
Scrub the ground
Scrub the ground
Let me hear you say

Aye bruh, too man too be pussy
Aye bruh, too high too paint; these niggas ain't funny
Aye bruh it's fifty dollars a zip, bet yo fly down
Need a Red Bull with wings on yo jeans to buy designer drugs from me
Aye Karo, Karo, cut it, cut it, Karo
Couldn't keep babying me in my white tee
I'm the Frenchies, I made you lean
Like you gon' go out next week
"Fuck tonight, ho" like you left your wallet at home
You buy tomorrow
Majin Buu'd up pop trunks like I'm Future Trunks
Blue-haired bitches still with the capsules so
Pen over the sword, ain't that right dawg?
Could still do my signature with my left
Like my nigga Future Gohan
And she still ain't move on
Yo bitch in love with love
So stop thinking 'bout why
She chose to lie
When she lies, know that bitch lyin'
So get them forever thoughts out your damn mind
At least you got laid
Poison-dipped arrow aimed, cupid precision
Niggas in my line of fire
And all y'all look like Valentines
Never throw hands over no ho
I know better than any broken-hearted pussy nigga though
Fuck is you talkin' bout?
In the moment, all you wanted was the sex
So I don't need you in my ear 'bout "text me"
We got all the time in the world
But bad bitches don't break curfew
You see her in that Panamera pumpkin
Louboutin glass slippers for my Cinderella
Dirty girl clean up so good
Dirty girl clean up so good
Dirty girl clean up so good
Cinderella clean up so good that I say-

Scrub the ground
Scrub the ground
Let me hear you say
Scrub the ground
Scrub the ground
Let me hear you say
Scrub, scrub, scrub
Scrub, scrub
The ground
Scrub the ground
Scrub the ground
Scrub the ground
Scrub the ground
Scrub the ground
Scrub the ground
Scrub the ground
