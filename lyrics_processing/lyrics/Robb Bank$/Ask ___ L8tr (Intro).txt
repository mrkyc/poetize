Rich Gang
Boy, you ain't a boss
You just a worker, nigga

Know I'm just splurging, nigga
What the fuck he got on?
We never heard of you nigga
We got a word for niggas
Rich Gang

You the gun, I'm the clip
I'm the mask, you the lick
You the fan and I'm lit

Fuck 'em, put 'em on some X, I
Line 'em up like, "Who's next?" Me and

Bitch, I might propose
To her best friend
Keep it G, that's all I ask from these niggas
Know you pussy, so don't act like a nigga
Signed a deal, it shouldn't matter to you niggas
Love to hate, you little broke mad nigga
Yes she bad, but she about it?

Only, gang is with me, they solid
Give her my name, it come back solid
I'm still the one nigga you ain't topping
Girl, you done struck gold when you found me
Cum taste like heaven, God got me
Walk in with the racks, got shells in my pocket
Uh, wrist solid gold
Neck solid gold
Bitch solid gold
Dick solid gold
Bitch on the pole
Trick on the low
Lurking on my page, give her dick on the low
Princess diamonds, I cut it, cut it
Qualiteck lines, I cut it, cut it
Double phone, know my name buzzing
Had a bit of money if the bitch ain't fucking
