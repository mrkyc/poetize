Lil' Bitch

Count it up, count it up, count it up
I close my eyes when I count the money
Got it up, run it up, pick it up, hang it up
Fuck nigga can't tell me nothing
Yea boy, i got money, drop money, pop money, yots money
Pro, number one with tha' stuntin'
Yea boy, 200, 300, 400, 500
Buku tha' hoes and the money

Aye

I bet that I get you hit
Don't make me run through the check
Don't make me throw up the stick
Tell yo hoe stop gettin' wet

And you give me yo' face, I'll give you this nut
And I swear that the underground do not deserve me
Go mainstream leave my fans disappointed
Count it up, count it up, count it up

Got it up, run it up, pick it up, hang it up
Fuck nigga can't tell me nothing

Got it up, run it up, pick it up, hang it up
