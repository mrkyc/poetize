SSET, SSET, SSET
Yeah, it's lit in this bitch, motherfucker
I think I might be happy
I got your ho sucking my motherfucking dick
Off the GHB and the adderall and the percocet
She might just vomit on my shit
My shit ten inches long down her throat
Ay, ay, SSET

Fuck with me, tell em niggas stop fuckin'
Cloverfield, hope you run out of luck with me
I'm at the void, feeding models with xans
Keep that shit low I ain't tell 'em they're pressed
I done had sex scandals in the press
I heard your mixtape, it was sweat
All of your chains look like fucking scraps
I was in Rolling Loud with the strap

But it wasn't me, it wasn't me, it wasn't me
It wasn't me, it wasn't me, it wasn't me
Hit 35, I'm for the P
It wasn't me, it wasn't me, it wasn't me
It wasn't me, it wasn't me, it wasn't me
I can get 35 for the P, lil birch

Right over left for my stones
Puppet nigga, hands full
These niggas hating cause they poor
Might get 'em booked for a show
Marsha heart still broke
Seen that cute little post
Hoe, you work at whole foods on the low
But that pussy still got GMO
Boy ,we never was broke, for that we did that song
Ain't no pressure lil nigga, no respect for you though
Boy, I'm stoned to the bone, never once wifed a hoe
Ashley couldn't get me, so she went, got a clone
I been waiting all summer, been biting my tongue
Licked these niggas, Haunter fresh out the ball
Hennessy too and blew up on my phones
Deidara on these clones

But it wasn't me, it wasn't me, it wasn't me
It wasn't me, it wasn't me, it wasn't me
Hit 35, I'm for the P
It wasn't me, it wasn't me, it wasn't me
It wasn't me, it wasn't me, it wasn't me
I can get 35 for the P
Bitch, bastic, boy don't, get yo ass kicked
Walked inside the door, shawty caught me red handed
I take molly, I get spastic, percocet like asprin
Pussy acting hard, I give him everything he asking
Bitch

How you let Shaggy's son rip you?
How you let Shaggy's son get you?
You let Shaggy's son get the pistol
Shaggy's son tired of the bitching
Shaggy's son with two foreign women
Shaggy's son just might run up and hit you
Shaggy's son couldn't fuck with you niggas
Shaggy's son was the one, didn't I tell you
Nigga, I chopped the top, go outer space, I smoke to the face
Broke show, can't get a taste
When I look at you, I see the hate
Put you in your place
I finally came out the plate
Boy I put a pistol to your face
Nigga I'm Banks, swear that I feel like 10k
And I'm feelin like 09' Wayne, I bet you feel like SGP

But it wasn't me, it wasn't me, it wasn't me
It wasn't me, it wasn't me, it wasn't me
Hit 35, I'm for the P
It wasn't me, it wasn't me, it wasn't me
It wasn't me, it wasn't me, it wasn't me
I can get 35 for the P
Boombastic, boy don't, get yo ass kicked
Walked inside the door, shawty caught me red handed
I take molly, I get spastic, percocet like asprin
Pussy acting hard, I give him everything he asking
Bitch

She even caught me on camera
