Way down, way way down
Way way down deep
You've got me way down, way way down
Way way down deep
You've got me way down, way down deep
I wander with you in my sleep
I'm way down, way way down
Way way down deep

It came to me this morning
I was walking down the street
Was like my soul could taste you
And God, you tasted sweet
Finally I can breathe again
Finally I can speak
I've got you in the glory place
I've got you way down deep

I've got you way down, way way down
Way way down deep
You've got me way down, way way down
Way way down deep
You've got me way down, way down deep
I wander with you in my sleep
I'm way down, way way down
Way way down deep
You might also like
Mmm, it's a funny feeling
But I cannot say I mind
(Cannot say I mind)
I know that I'm dealing with
A love that's far from blind
I see every single angle
I look before I leap
And how else can I put it
When you've got me way down deep
(Ah, you've got me way down)

You've got me way down, way way down
Way way down deep (Way down)
You've got me way down, way way down
Way way down deep (Way down deep)
You've got me way down, way down deep
I wander with you in my sleep
I'm way down, way way down
Way way down deep

Don't matter what we gave away
Was nothing we could keep
Don't matter what we didn't say
You know that talk was cheap
(Talk, talk, talk, talk)
Forgive me if I hate you
You're a liar and a thief
But I've got you in the glory place
I got you way down deep
You've got me way down, way way down (Way down)
Way way down deep (Way down deep)
You've got me way down, way way down
Way way down deep (Way down deep)
You've got me way down, way down deep
I wander with you in my sleep
I'm way down, way way down
Way way down deep

Don't matter if the road is long
Don't matter if it's steep
Don't matter if the moon goes out
And darkness is complete
Don't matter if we lose our way
I know we're gonna meet
I've got you in the glory place
I've got to have it good

You've got me way down, way way down (Way down)
Way way down deep (Way down)
You've got me way down, way way down (Way down)
Way way down deep
You've got me way down, way down deep
I wander with you in my sleep
I'm way down, way way down
Way way down deep
Way down, way way down
Way way down deep
Way down, way way down
Way way down deep


Way down, way way down
Way way down deep
You've got me way down, way way down
Way way down deep
You've got me way down, way down deep
I wander with you in my sleep
I'm way down, way way down
Way way down deep

Oh, way down, way way down
Way way down deep
Way down, way way down
