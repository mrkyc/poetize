I'll be your number one fan, you're the only one I stan
Got me screaming in the front row
I'll be there anytime I can with a ticket in my hand
Play together 'til the credits roll

Oh, look in your eyes like
Woah, they always shine bright
I see the limelight, I can't describe that glow

I wanna put you in the spotlight
Turn off the cameras, now you're all mine
Make you a superstar in my mind, my mind
'Cause it's your show
I wanna put you in the spotlight
We close the curtains, now it's our time
'Cause you're a shooting star in my sky, my sky
And you should know

Red carpet rolling down the road
That's why you're the leading role
Windows tinted, so they can't see
I'll follow, anywhere you go
Watch the door when you get home
Yelling, "No paparazzi"
You might also like
Oh, look in your eyes like
Ohh, they always shine bright
I see the limelight, I can't describe that glow

I wanna put you in the spotlight
Turn off the cameras, now you're all mine
Make you a superstar in my mind, my mind
'Cause it's your show
I wanna put you in the spotlight
We close the curtains, now it's our time
'Cause you're a shooting star in my sky, my sky
And you should know

A celebrity in my head (My head)
A superstar in my bed (My bed)
Make a scene, it's your set (Your set)
So remember me, when I say

I wanna put you in the spotlight (Spotlight)
Turn off the cameras, now you're all mine (All mine)
Make you a superstar in my mind (My mind), my mind (My mind)
'Cause it's your show
I wanna put you in the spotlight (Spotlight)
We close the curtains, now it's our time (Our time)
'Cause you're a shooting star in my sky (My sky), my sky (My sky)
