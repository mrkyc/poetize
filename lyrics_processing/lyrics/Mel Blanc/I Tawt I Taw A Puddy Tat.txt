Mel Blanc
Note: This is ANOTHER song I taped off the radio but missed
The first line!
Note: Tweety's voice is T, Sylvester's voice is S and both is B
T:--------------------------------------------------------------
I live inside my birdcage a hanging way up high
I like to swing upon my perch and sing my little song
But there's a cat that's after me and won't let me alone
I tawt I taw a puddy tat a creeping up on me
I did I taw a puddy tat as plain as he could be
S:I am that great big bad old cat Sylvester is my name
I only have one aim in life and that is very plain
I want to catch that little bird and eat him right away
But every time that I get close to him this is what he'll say
I tawt I taw a puddy tat a creeping up on me
You bet he saw a puddy tat that puddy tat was me
T:That puddy tat is very bad he sneaks up from behind
I don't think I would like it if I knew what's on his mind
I have a strong suspision that his plans for me aren't good
I am inclined to think that he would eat me if he could
INSTRUMENTAL INTERLUDE
S:I'd like to eat that Tweety Pie when he leaves his cage
But I cannot get close to him it throws me in a rage
You bet I'd eat that little bird if I could just get near
But everytime that I approach this is all I hear
T:I tawt I taw a puddy tat a creeping up on me
I did I taw a puddy tat as plain as he could be
And when I sing that little song my mistress knows he's back
She grabs a broom and brings it down upon Sylvester's back
So listen you bad puddy tat let's both be friends you see
My mistress will not chase you if you sing this song for me
Come on now like a good cat
S:Oh alright...sufferin' sucotash!
B:I tawt i taw a puddy tat a creeping up on me
