As I walked through the door and my eyes fit the darkness
I saw him alone at the bar
I went over to him said you may not know me
But I sure do know who you are
Don't worry my anger was spent long ago
And only the memory remains
But lord how I suffered, sometimes I still wonder
And maybe now you can explain

Tell me how could I love her so much
And then lose her so quickly to someone like you
How did you know how to hold her and please her
How did you know what to do
After all of the time I spent learning to love her
And be what she needed me to
Tell me how could I love her so much
And then lose her so quickly to someone like you

He said friend let me buy you a drink
And I'll tell you a story that's sad but it's true
How I loved her and held her 'til some drifter stole her
From me like I stole her from you
I guess no one can own her, her heart's like a soldier of fortune
Her love's like the wind
Still all I can think of is finding her new love
And asking this question of him
You might also like
How could I love her so much
And then lose her so quickly to someone like you
How did you know how to hold her and please her
How did you know what to do
After all of the time I spent learning to love her
And be what she needed me to
Tell me how could I love her so much
And then lose her so quickly to someone like you
How could I love her so much
And then lose her so quickly to someone like you
