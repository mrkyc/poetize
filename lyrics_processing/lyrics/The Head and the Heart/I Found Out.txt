It's not the love that's in your mind
It's the love that you might find
That's gonna save our lives
I found out
It's not the love that's in your mind
It's the love that you might find
That's gonna save our lives

I gave my trust
To the wrong man again, the wrong man again
Well, it happens all the time, it happens all the time
I was born on a good day
I've seen the world through children's eyes
My, how those years go by, mmm, those years go by

If you don't know where you're going
Don't you wish that on me
So you don't know where you're going
Don't you wish that on me
Quit wasting my time telling me what you think is right
You could spend your life going on and on
With what you call news

I woke up on a good day, looking into children's eyes
I see those years fly by
You know those years just fly

If you don't know where you're going
Don't you wish that on me
So you don't know where you're going
Don't you wish that on me

I found out
It's not the love that's in your mind
It's the love that you might find
That's gonna save our lives
I found out
It's not the love that's in your mind

That's gonna save our lives

It's just a single day, I never found my way
I know you'll never care
But I just can't believe in everything
I hope that you can see what I can see
I found out
It's not the love that's in your mind
It's the love that you might find
That's gonna save our lives
I found out
It's not the love that's in your mind
It's the love that you might find
That's gonna save our lives (Go)

Don't you wish that on me, babe

It's not the love that's in your mind
It's the love that you might find
That's gonna save our lives
