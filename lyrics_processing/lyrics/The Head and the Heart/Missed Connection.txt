If I never come through
Yes, it haunts me
Sunny days, I'd miss you
Yes, it haunts me
First you see it, then you feel it, now I'm caught
And we're making our own thing
Now I'm following you out to the coast
If I never come through
If I never come through

Don't tell me I lost a step
Criss-crossed in the wrong direction
Found myself in a conversation
From a missed connection
Standing there in a purple dress
Point my eyes in the right direction
Find myself in a conversation
From a missed connection

La-la-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la
From a missed connection

I lost myself in this maze (La-la-la-la)
Yes, it haunts me (La-la-la)
Felt it slipping sideways (La-la-la-la-la)
Yes, it haunts me (La-la-la-la)
But I see it and I feel it in my soul
Is there something I'm missing?
Should I follow this wherever it goes?
I will always come through
I will always come through

Don't tell me I lost a step
Criss-crossed in the wrong direction
Found myself in a conversation
From a missed connection
Standing there in a purple dress
Point my eyes in the right direction
Find myself in a conversation
From a missed connection

Only as alone as I want to be
Passing all the people standing on the street
The fallen fruit of a family tree
A crystal ball and the odyssey
Did you find whatever you were looking for?
Had to open every single door
I get the feeling you've been here before
From a missed connection
Don't tell me I lost a step
Criss-crossed in the wrong direction
Found myself in a conversation
From a missed connection
Standing there in a purple dress
Point my eyes in the right direction
Find myself in a conversation
From a missed connection

La-la-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la

(La-la-la-la, la-la-la)
And they're falling to see it
(La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la)
We'd be fools to waste it, but we can
(La-la-la-la, la-la-la)
Falling to feel the heat again
(La-la-la-la-la)
