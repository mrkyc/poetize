Virginia don't sound like she used to
Walking home late
Smoke in my lungs and whiskey burning
In my veins
December won't be so forgiving
I'm haunted by a ghost
Of you and my past colliding
I can never go home

Wind in the night
Wind in the night
Thought that I heard you laughing
Wasn't that you, my darling?

Virginia don't sound like she used to
Virginia don't feel like she used to
But I can feel a heart beating for me, baby
I know her heart's beating for me, baby
Virginia don't sound like she used to
Virginia don't feel like she used to
But I can feel a heart beating for me, baby
I know her heart's beating for me, yeah
