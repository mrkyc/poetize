You can look all your life for someone
You can tell yourself again that something was off
You can spend your life alone, oh, oh

When asked if we should stay or go
Your back is up against the wall
The clock's the only sound you hear
We've all been down this road before

Feeling like you're so alone
And there's no way, no way out
Feeling like you're so alone
And there's no way, no way out
I know, I know, I know
Right when you think you have it
You fall into the static
Slipping into slow-mo
I know, I know, I know
It's almost automatic
You fall into the static
Slipping into slow-mo

Take a step back, wait just a minute there
Isn't living all about embracing the real?
You don't have to waste your life alone, alone

When asked if we should stay or go
Your back is up against the wall
There's nothing left to keep you here
We've all been down this road before

Feeling like you're so alone
And there's no way, no way out
Feeling like you're so alone
And there's no way, no way out
I know, I know, I know
Right when you think you have it
You fall into the static
Slipping into slow-mo
I know, I know, I know
It's almost automatic
You fall into the static
Slipping into slow-mo

I heard you're feeling, feeling so lonely
What did you hear? You hear it only
And now it's weird, feeling like you're so alone
Now that you're feeling, feeling so lonely
What did you hear? (Find your way back, way back)
You hear it only
And now it's real, even if you feel alone
I'll help you find your way back
And there's no way, no way out
And there's no way, no way out
I know, I know, I know
Right when you think you have it
You fall into the static
Slipping into slow-mo
I know, I know, I know
It's almost automatic
You fall into the static
