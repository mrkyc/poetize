Pick yourself up, kid
Pick yourself up, kid

Pick yourself up, kid
I can't bear the weight
Pick your mood up, friend
We don't have the time
When you find someone
We don't run away
Pick yourself up, kid

All those books in your head
Is that all this really was?
Just a role you play
That you could hide behind
Is it what you want?
To bury yourself away
Before your time goes

I don't want a love that holds us back
I don't want a life that I can't have

So pick yourself up, kid
I can't bear the weight
Let the light back in

Now it's all on you
Don't you let it fade
Before your time goes

I don't want a love that holds us back
I don't want a life that I can't have

'Cause people need a melody to open their eyes

Holding onto everything, you're stuck in the past
Boy, when you gonna learn the world moves fast?
The world moves
It's been a little while since we've been together
It's been a long time since we were young and wild, remember?
When we were friends, remember?
When we were lovers
It's not too late, it was never too late

People need a melody to open their eyes
To a memory frozen in time
