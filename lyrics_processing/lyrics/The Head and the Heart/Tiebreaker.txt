Hit me with your eyes and we'll compromise, and
We've been trying to fix two people who don't need fixing
It's a tiebreaker, hands are tied, baby
Throwing up just like the fourth of July, baby
And the longer we go, the better
The chances we'll lose forever
It's a tiebreaker, hands are tied, baby
Rather keep you in my life as you are, baby
I'm letting go of the reasons
History keeps repeating
Took me so long to see it
I know you know I'm trying

I can't believe I almost went my whole life
Without you in it, without you in it
And you're missing out, you're missing out
I can't believe I almost went my whole life
Without you in it, without you in it
And you're missing out, you're missing out
And you're missing out, you're missing out

You've unleashed a part of me, that thought ain't lost on me
I wouldn't be here without you, honestly
Then when I'm singing I just disco the weekend
Don't need to panic, I won't let go, you need it
Trust and follow me, put it all on me
I'll take you places if you just learn to follow me
And when you're dancing, you see stars on the ceiling
Nothing can turn down all those feelings you're feeling

The story that you keep dying
Can't blame myself for breaking
These cracks, we'll let the light in

I can't believe I almost went my whole life
Without you in it, without you in it
And you're missing out, you're missing out
I can't believe I almost went my whole life
Without you in it, without you in it
And you're missing out, you're missing out

Lean into the light, come out of the dark
Your last night over, keep starting
Lean into the light, come out of the dark
Lean into the light, come out of the dark
Forget what they say, it's all in your heart
Lean into the light, come out of the dark

I can't believe I almost went my whole life
Without you in it, without you in it
And you're missing out, you're missing out
I can't believe I almost went my whole life
Without you in it, without you in it
