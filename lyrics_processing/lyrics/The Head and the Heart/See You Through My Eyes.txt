Oh, oh
Oh, oh

A heart-shaped tree standing in between
Human nature, and the nature we see
Wouldn't you know it now?
Life's got a funny way of showing us how
I see you standing there, listening in the leaves
Looking down, shining on me
Trying to show me how, just takes a while
You should know this by now

Until you learn to love yourself
The door is locked to someone else
I'm just as damaged as you are
Scattered to pieces with you gone
Without the dark, there is no light
But don't give the ghost an inch tonight
I saw the signs you were leaving
But I didn't wanna believe it

This could be so easy
If you could see you through my eyes
I tell myself not to let it go
Hold on to something so beautiful
This could be so easy
If you could see you through my eyes
I tell myself not to let it go
Hold on to something so beautiful

It's been a few years since I watched you leave
And there's still so much of you left in me
But as time would show us
No one ever stops the wind from blowing
I was waiting on you
You were waiting on me to
Change into something, baby
Change is a beautiful thing

Until you learn to love yourself
The door is locked to someone else
I'm just as damaged as you are
Scattered to pieces with you gone
Without the dark, there is no light
But don't give the ghost an inch tonight
I saw the signs you were leaving
But I didn't wanna believe it

This could be so easy
If you could see you through my eyes
I tell myself not to let it go
Hold on to something so beautiful
This could be so easy
If you could see you through my eyes
I tell myself not to let it go
Hold on to something so beautiful
If you find some place to rest, then you should take it
Somewhere to replace the time that we have wasted
You should take it, take it

Until you learn to love yourself
The door is locked to someone else
I saw the signs you were leaving
But I didn't wanna believe it

This could be so easy
If you could see you through my eyes
I tell myself not to let it go
Hold on to something so beautiful
This could be so easy
If you could see you through my eyes
I tell myself not to let it go
Hold on to something so beautiful

Oh, oh
Your magic does something to me
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
