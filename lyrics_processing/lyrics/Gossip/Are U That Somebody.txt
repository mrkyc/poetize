East coast feel me
West Coast feel me x2
Boy, I been watchin you like a hawk in the sky at night
Cause you are my prey (my prey)
Boy, I promise you if we keep bumpin heads
I know that one of these days (days)
We gon hook it up while we talk on the phone
But see, I don't know if that's good
I been holdin back this secret from you
I probably shouldn't tell it but
CHORUS:
If I, If I let you know you can't tell nobody
I'm talkin bout nobody
Are you responsible
Boy I gotta watch my back
Cause I'm not just anybody
Is it my go, is it your go
Sometimes I'm goody-goody
Right now I'm naughty-naughty
Say yes or say no
Cause I really need somebody
Tell me your that somebody
Boy, won't you pick me up at the park right now
Up the block while everyone sleeps (sleeps sleeps)
I'll be waitin there with my tucks, my loads, my hat
Just so I'm low key
If you tell the world (don't sleep, you know that we'll be weak)
Oh boy, see I'm trusting you with my heart, my soul
I probably shouldn't let ya but if I
Chorus
Baby girl
I'm the man from the big VA
Won't you come play round my way
And listen to what I gotta say
Timbaland don't you know I'm the man
Rock shows here to Japan
Have people shaking-shaking my hand
Baby girl, better known as Aaliyah
Give me hives, corns, and high fevers
Make the playa haters believe
Don't cha know gotta tell somebody cause
Cause I really need somebody
Tell me your that somebody
Chorus
You can't tell nobody
I'm talking about nobody
I hope your responsible
Boy I gotta watch my back
Cause I'm not just anybody
Is it my go is it your go
Sometimes I'm goody-goody
Right now I'm naughty-naughty
Say yes or say no
Cause I really need somebody
Tell me your that somebody
Is it my go is it your go
Sometimes I'm goody-goody
Right now I'm naughty-naughty
Cause I really need somebody
