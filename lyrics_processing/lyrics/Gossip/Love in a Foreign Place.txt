I put my makeup on and
Head for the other side of town
In my dress from the night before
Fearing the comedown
Outside a sea of people forming
Walking off to work this morning
They look right through me as I'm passing by
Not even so much as an evil eye

The city speaks to you (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
So much to live for, so much to lose (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
The end is coming, beginning is near (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Anything you look for, you'll find it here (Ooh-ooh-ooh)

I fell in love in a foreign place
I could stay forever
It's my time
It's now or never

I've been so many places
Nowhere could ever tie me down
All I ever wanted was so much more
Than life in a small town
I find it hard to hide my feelings
Looking up to ancient buildings
Looking down on me, towering above
Time was standing still as we fell in love
You might also like
The city speaks to you (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
So much to live for, so much to lose (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
The end is coming, beginning is near (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Anything you look for, you'll find it here (Ooh-ooh-ooh)

I fell in love in a foreign place
I could stay forever
It's my time
It's now or never
I fall in love as the world was ending
Not getting any younger
I feel life taking over

So much to live for
So much to lose
So much to live for
So much to lose
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)

I've been so many places
Nowhere could ever tie me down
All I ever wanted was so much more
Than life in a small town (Small town)
I fell in love in a foreign place (Ooh)
I could stay forever (Ooh)
It's my time
It's now or never (Ooh)
I fall in love as the world was ending (Ooh)
Not getting any younger
