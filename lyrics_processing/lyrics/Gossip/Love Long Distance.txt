Calling yourself a romantic, let me explain
Been across the whole Atlantic and back again
I had it with your antics, your childish games
Baby
I called your number twice, but it rang and rang
Against my best friend's advice, I should be ashamed
You did it to me once, you'll do it again
So she says

Love long distance is testing me, trying my patience
I need more of your assistance now
Love long distance is testing me, trying my patience
I need more of your assistance now

I heard it through the bass line
Not much longer, would you be my baby?
You work yourself into a panic, bent outta shape
And then take me for granted like nothing's changed
All my friends are asking why you're that way
But I can't explain
Why I call your number twice, but it rang and rang
Against my best friend's advice, I should be ashamed
You did it to me once, you'll do it again
She promises
You might also like
Love long distance is testing me, trying my patience
I need more of your assistance now
You're making me crazy
The way that you've been acting lately
I need more of your assistance now

Breaking up or breaking down
When I need you, you can't be found
I want someone who's around for me
Does it have to be so complicated?
Either way, I'm devastated
I could use a little comforting

Love long distance is testing me, trying my patience
I need more of your assistance now
Love long distance is testing me, trying my patience
I need more of your assistance now

Love, love
Love, love
I need some assistance now
And I will thank you for your cooperation
And I will thank you for your cooperation
And I will thank you for your cooperation
