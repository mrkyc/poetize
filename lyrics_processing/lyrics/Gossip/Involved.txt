I'm beginning to wonder what you look like
As days go by, I hardly recognize
Too tired to leave, too tired to fight
But sometimes it's alright
I'm fooling myself or seemingly so
You were fool of yourself, assuming and cold
But sooner or later that story gets old
Too old, it's been told

I'm not in love
Who did you think I was?
I'm not above the rest of us
And just because I tremble when we touch
I'm not in love with you
I'm just involved, I'm just involved with you

I like it so much, I turned a blind eye
You were on my mind ninety percent of the time
The laws of attraction can be unkind
Or too kind, a fine line
I was spending my days forgetting the nights
You were M-I-A and out of sight
A bad mistake and that's putting it nice
It's true, right? (It's true, right? It's true, right?)
You might also like
I'm not in love
Who did you think I was?
I'm not above the rest of us
And just because I tremble when we touch
I'm not in love with you
I'm just involved, I'm just involved with you

All of my life I worked for what was mine
All of the nights I sat at home and cried
Could have been right?
But you took more than you gave
Take my advice and hear me when I say

I'm not in love
Who did you think I was?
Oh, I'm not above the rest of us
And just because I tremble when we touch
I'm not in love with you
I'm just involved
I'm not in love
Who did you think I was?
I'm not above the rest of us
And just because I tremble when we touch
I'm not in love with you
