I'd love to stay and party
But I gotta go to work
I'd love to stay and party
But I gotta go to work
I'd love to stay and party
But I gotta go to work
Work, work, work, work, work
Work, wo-work, work, work, work
Work, work, work, work, work
Work, wo-work, work, work, work

I hear you laughing but I don't think it's funny
What good can happen spending other people's money but
You better get a job
It was adorable when you were in your twenties
Not so cute anymore now that you're pushing thirty
You better get a job

But you never know how it's gonna go
How it's all gonna end up tomorrow
You gotta try, try, try
I know it's hard but
You never know how it's gonna go end up tomorrow
You gotta try, try, try
You might also like
Girl, you better get a job
Oh, girl, you need to work real hard

Just had your hair done
But when I ask you for the rent
Poor little rich girl
You don't know where the money went
You need to get a job
What kind of life is it when every day's a weekend
How quickly we forget
When I'm at work, you're sleeping in
You need to get a job

But you never know how it's gonna go
How it's all gonna end up tomorrow
You gotta try, try, try
I know it's hard but
You never know how it's gonna go end up tomorrow
You gotta try, try, try

Girl, you better get a job
Oh, girl, you need to work real hard
I'd love to stay and party
But I gotta go to work
I'd love to stay and party
But I gotta go to work
I'd love to stay and party
But I gotta go to work
Work, work, work, work, work
Work, wo-work, work, work, work

Who's gonna hire you with your lack of experience?
Who's gonna wire you the last of your inheritance?

Girl, you better get a job
Oh, girl, you need to work real hard
Girl, you better get a job
Oh, girl, you need to work real hard

But you never know how it's gonna go
How it's all gonna end up tomorrow
You gotta try, try, try
I know it's hard but
You never know how it's gonna go end up tomorrow
