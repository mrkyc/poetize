But you're so far away
I can hear your voice across the way
I can tell you now and I will promise you
That I will be here night and day
Through wasted years, I've lived with undecided love
Now suddenly I'm walking through the fear
The many ways I tried now
Am I good enough?
And I will be right here
And I will be right here
I don't want to be the one to let you go
Is it too late to change your mind
And I hope that you'll surely find your way
Look no further
Does it mean that much to you?
Does it mean that much?
Does it mean that much?
Does it mean that much to you?
Does it mean that much?
Does it mean that much to you?
And I will go on living
Such a grateful man
I just want to learn to try
And I know that there's an answer deep inside of me
'cause we both see eye to eye

I don't want to be the one to let you go
Is it too late to change your mind?
And I hope that you'll surely find your way
I just want to be the one to let you know
Is it too late to tell you why?
And I hope that you'll surely find real love
Look no further
Does it mean that much to you?
Does it mean that much?
Does it mean that much?
Does it mean that much to you?
Does it mean that much?
Does it mean that much to you?
And I will sacrifice all of my life just for you
