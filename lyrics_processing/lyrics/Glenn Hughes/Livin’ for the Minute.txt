There was a time when the day turned into night
And I was barely just alive
And I remember walkin' in the light
Just tryin' to reach the other side
I want to tell you what is on my mind
No need to suffer, no need to worry
All is forgiven and I hope you'll find
That's the way life's supposed to be
You better listen
You know where I've been
I've been livin' for the minute
Livin' for the minute
I need a vision, I won't live in sin
I've been livin' for the minute
Livin' for the minute
You better listen
You know where I've been
I've been livin' for the minute
Livin' for the minute
And you don't know me, know me at all
You don't know the man behind the face
You might also likeAnd now you call me, call me for advice
But you don't hear a single thing
And now you wonder and I know you realize
But you won't stop, and you won't give in
I want to tell you what is on my mind
No need to suffer, no need to worry
All is forgiven and I hope you'll find
That's the way life's supposed to be
I'm livin'
You better listen
You know where I've been
I've been livin' for the minute
Livin' for the minute
I need a vision, I won't live in sin
I've been livin' for the minute
Livin' for the minute
This time
And you don't know me, know me at all
You don't know the man behind the face
And now you call me, call me for advice
But you don't hear a single thing
And now you wonder and I know you realize
But you won't stop, and you won't give in
All is forgiven and I hope you'll find
That's the way life's supposed to be
You better listen
You know where I've been
I've been livin' for the minute
Livin' for the minute
I need a vision, I won't live in sin
I've been livin' for the minute
