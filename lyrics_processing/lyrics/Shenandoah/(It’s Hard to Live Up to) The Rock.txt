He was the captain of the team in forty-two
A favorite of the fans and the ladies too
I still love the stories about The Rock
He fought for his country in Normandy
And drove the Germans back to Germany
Captain's right-hand-man was a Rock

And to me he looked tall as a tree
At times I thought he never noticed me
Standing in the shadow of The Rock
I tried to make him proud of me
But my mistakes was all he'd see
It always seemed so hard to please The Rock

And he'll never know how hard I try
To be the man I thought that I should be in his eyes
And I gave my all to be strong and stand tall, to be The Rock
Oh Lord, it's hard to live up to The Rock

He came to visit me the other day
I couldn't believe how much he'd aged
But in my eyes he'll always be The Rock
He said, "Son, ain't it funny how the years roll by"
As he turned his head, I saw him rub his eyes
I never had felt closer to The Rock

He said, "Son, you made my life complete"
The only man I tried to be
I never thought I'd hear from The Rock
And I was almost overcome
When he said, "It's an honor to call you son
And I'm proud to say you're a chip off the old block"

"And you'll never know how hard I try
To be the man I thought that I should be in your eyes
And I gave my all to be strong and stand tall
To be your Rock

Oh Lord, it's hard to live up to The Rock
