Well I gotta have a talk with my baby
Well I gotta make her understand
'Cause we had a lover's quarrel
And it got a little outta hand
Well, now usually we kiss and make up
But it's never been like this before
And I got a funny feelin' that she won't be back
If I let her walk out the door

She's talkin' about walkin' out
Ain't no doubt about it
Gotta talk her outta walkin' out
Before it's all over but the shoutin'
Gotta talk her outta leavin'
And believin' in me again
Yeah, we had a big fight last night
No I gotta make it right
Before she hits the door
And there ain't nothing more that I can do about it
She's talkin' about walkin' out
Ain't no doubt about it
Gotta talk her outta walkin' out
Before it's all over but the shoutin'
See Shenandoah LiveGet tickets as low as $64You might also like
From a teeny tiny little spat
But it blew up all outta proportion
'Til we're fightin' like a dog and a cat
Yeah, I gotta make it all blow over
This shot had better be my best
I gotta do some fancy dancin' now
To try and wiggle outta this mess

She's talkin' about walkin' out
Ain't no doubt about it
Gotta talk her outta walkin' out
Before it's all over but the shoutin'
Gotta talk her outta leavin'
And believin' in me again
Yeah, we had a big fight last night
No I gotta make it right
Before she hits the door
And there ain't nothing more that I can do about it
She's talkin' about walkin' out
Ain't no doubt about it
Gotta talk her outta walkin' out
Before it's all over but the shoutin'

She's talkin' about walkin' out
Ain't no doubt about it
