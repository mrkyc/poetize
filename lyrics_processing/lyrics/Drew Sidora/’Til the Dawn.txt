Oh Oh
Oh Oh
Oh Oh
Ohhhhhhh
Oh no no no
Out on the weekend
Out on the weekend
Out on the weekend
Out on the weekend

Let them in, get the lights, let party begin
Mix a little love, get the mood jumpin'
From New York to Miami by ten
I think I'm ready to go
High, every time that we hit up our spot
See everyone in line, and they payin' a lot
'Cept their payin' for the night
'Cause the drinks are fixed
But the music is free
You want it, you got it
You need it, but you know you gotta have it, boy
The music is free
(Out on the weekend, out on the weekend, weekend)

I'm feelin' you like you's family
And everybody down from LA to DC
Rockin' to the same old school beats
This is for the kids in the clubs and the street
Talkin' 'bout you work three deity
Get on the dance floor where the music is free
Slip, gone until the dawn's gone with me
Gone until the dawn's gone with me
Where the music is free
Slip, gone until the dawn's gone with me
(Out on the weekend, on the weekend, weekend)
Now all my ladies
Move it to the front
Show 'em what you got
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh, oh ooh
Oh, oh ooh
Fellas?
Oh, like that

And all my ladies say
And all the fellas say
Everybody say
Come dance with me, ohh
And they say we all
Dance like this, we have the men in bed and off
'Til there mornin', there we go lettin' off
Tyler's droppin' onto the table top
Once again, you can shake your thang and there ain't no cops
This is for the girls comin' from NYC
I'm feelin' you like you's family
And everybody down from LA to DC
Rockin' to the same old school beats
This is for the kids in the clubs and the street
Talkin' 'bout you work three diety
Get on the dance floor where the music is free
Slip, gone until the dawn's gone with me
This is for the girls comin' from NYC
I'm feelin' you like you's family
And everybody down from LA to DC
Rockin' to the same old school beats
This is for the kids in the clubs and the street
Talkin' 'bout you work three deity
Get on the dance floor where the music is free
Slip, gone until the dawn's gone with me
Gone until the dawn's gone with me
Where the music is free
Slip, gone until the dawn's gone with me
