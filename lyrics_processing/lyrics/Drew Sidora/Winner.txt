Lemme tell you 'bout it

You thought you had the best of me (Yeah)
Said that this would be the end of me (Ooh ah)
I admit you had me down for a while (Yes, you did)
But I know, I'm the shit, so you can watch me take my bow
(Watch me take my bow, yeah)

With my back against the wall, I stood up strong
Refused to foregate my swing and with my all
It was time I learned my worth
Prayed to god, I went to church
Pulled the faith up out the dirt, he heard my call

If you're lookin' for a winner
You ain't gotta look no further than me
If you're lookin' for a winner
It's guaranteed, put your money on me
And I ain't talkin' no beginner
I been schooled by the best in these streets
If you're lookin' for a winner
You ain't gotta look no further than me

But you keep fuckin' up, fuckin' up, fuckin' up
Fuckin' with my life

With my back against the wall, I stood up strong
Refused to foregate my swing and with my all
