Every time I think about how my life was incomplete
Every day I struggle to breathe, to laugh, my heart skipped a beat
From now on, you're the only thing I see
My best and my worst, to you, it don't matter
You can see through my flaws and keep lovin' me, me, me
Each day we spend together gets better
With you, I can do anything
And I share it with you
From now on, everything that I have is yours
For the love of you
From now on, everything that you need is yours
For the love of you
Do you remember the night we stood out in the rain?
Soaking wet, those three words I could not say
I love you
Now there's three things I need to do
I'll tie you down then lead you
Tomorrow, take you through all night long
It's only you I give my heart to
Now, baby, I can say these words
I want you, I miss you, I need you
It's only you I give my heart to
So kiss me on my lips, boy, I love you
You open my heart, now it's yours
Anything you want and more

For the love of you
From now on, everything that you need is yours
For the love of you
Let me know, let me know
Everything that I have is yours
This is what I'm saying
For the love of you
From now on
Anything that you need is yours
For the love of you
For the love of you, girl
You know you've got me, girl
You know you've got me, baby
Yes, I love you, babe
Got nothing, but because
Boy, you got me crazy
Never let you down
We've got nothing to lose, baby
I'll be knocking at your door
I'll be ringing at your door
From now on
Everything that I have is yours
For the love of you
From now on
Everything that you need is yours
For the love of you
Yeah, just me and you, baby, from now on
Anything you ever need, you ever want
Consider it done
