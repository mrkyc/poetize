Don't need beaches of white sand
I don't need the rows of palm trees, decorating strips of land
I don't want what's viewed as heaven
I don't need the sights and sounds
And it took me years of searching
But I've finally figured out
That I've wasted so much time, keeping company with strife
Trying to find a place that's mine. 
And my heart runs to that place, every time it rains
I close my eyes and I imagine that I'm there
I've never felt more at peace
Than when I walk these ancient streets
And I know I need to be breathing in that English air
We can make our way down these cobblestone streets
Our hearts keeping time with the sound of our feet
We can drive through the country of hills so green
And get lost in its history
Cause we get so little time, to reach contentment in our lives
I know where I found mine. 
And my heart runs to that place, every time it rains
I close my eyes and I imagine that I'm there
I've never felt more at peace
Than when I walk these ancient streets
And I know I need to be breathing in that English air

Cause this place calls out my name
Traveled all over the world
And nowhere else feels quite the same
Give me English air to fill my lungs
So I can breathe again
Cause I've always been a wandering soul
But Heaven knows I think it's time that I came home
And my heart runs to that place, every time it rains
I close my eyes and I imagine that I'm there
I've never felt more at peace
Than when I walk these ancient streets
And I know I need to be breathing in that English air
