Let me tell you now
Ohh oh
When i had you to myself i didn't want you around
Those pretty faces always made you stand out in a crowd
But someone picked you from the bunch
One glance was all it took
Now it's much too late for me to take a second look
Oh baby give me one more chance
Won't you please let me
Back in your heart
Oh darlin' i was blind to let you go
But now since i see you in his arms
I want you back
Yes i do now
I want you back
Ooh ooh baby
I want you back
Ya ya ya ya
I want you back
Na na na na
Tryin' to live without your love
Is one long sleepless night
Let me show you girl
That i know wrong from right
Every street you walk on
I leave tear stains on the ground
Following the girl
I didn't even want around
Let me tell you now
You might also likeOh baby give me one more chance
