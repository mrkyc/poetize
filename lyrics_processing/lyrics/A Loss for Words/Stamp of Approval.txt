You'll never know her true intentions
Of all the fear that lies inside you
Thrown headfirst into submission
Let's go!
Pray for the day that you can save your place in line
Trade in your faith, your beliefs
Trade everything to see your name in lights
She sold her soul to the state of California
It's no surprise she thinks she's calling the shots
She sold her soul to the state of California
They'll take you and make you into everything you said you're not
You got to stand up for yourself, fight for what you believe
They'll leave you bloodied, bruised and broken
Before you even know they're through
They feed you lines like
"Girl you are one of a kind. Some day the seas will part for you."
But I've seen so many other girls
Who all dress and drink and screw the way you do
She sold her soul to the state of California
It's no surprise she thinks she's calling the shots
She sold her soul to the state of California
They'll take you and make you into everything you said you're not

Will your name be proudly on display?
They make, they break people like us
Another soul lost in the haze
Another story for the back page
They make, they break people like us
I'm just a casualty of fair play
Will the west coast be enough?
Will it ever be enough?
(Will the west coast be enough?)
(Will it ever be enough?)
She sold her soul to the state of California
It's no surprise she thinks she's calling the shots
She sold her soul to the state of California
Anything that makes her think she's going to the stars
She sold her soul to the state of California
It's no surprise she thinks she's calling the shots
