Well, he's daddy's little boy, he plays with his toys
He holds on to his daddy's hand
His daddy says "Sonny you're a big, strong boy
You're gonna be a big, strong man"
And they go play catch, they go play ball
They go take a walk along the sand
Big, strong daddy and a big, strong boy
Living in a big, strong land

Daddy, is he a goodie or a baddie?
Daddy can I have a dinosaur?
Once upon a time there were cannibals
Now there are no cannibals anymore

Way down in Louisiana there's a hurricane coming
The little boy climbs the stairs
And all along the levee all the people come running
And the little boy's saying his prayers
And a sleepy little laddie smiles up at his daddy
And he's asking for his G.I. Joe
And daddy tucks him in with a kiss upon the chin
And says "My little one I love you so"

Leave a light outside your door
Once upon a time there were cannibals
Now there are no cannibals anymore

Well, lay down your head, now don't get out of bed
Don't you let the bedbugs bite
It's time to sleep now, not another peep
And I'll see you in the morning light
And then the radio was playing and the weatherman was saying
The hurricane had blown away
And daddy's little boy was jumping up for joy
And he was singing at the break of the day

Daddy, is he a goodie or a baddie?
Daddy can I be a warrior?
Once upon a time there were cannibals
Now there are no cannibals anymore
Yeah, daddy, is he a goodie or a baddie?
Daddy, why do people go to war?
Once upon a time there were cannibals
