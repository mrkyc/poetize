Don't often open up this floor
Since I handed in my gun
What all these keys are for
Now my tour of duty's done
You got to know the switches
Now you got your turn
Watch and learn, junior
Watch and learn

Now you will get your trouble spots
Here's one from down voodoo way
Bragged he had me by the you-know-what's
Very funny, you don't say
The big Enchilada
Stealin' elections
Had to go down their
Trash collection

Got his cojones on my desk and they're
Made into a souvenir
Set of cufflinks, nice pair
The rest of him's someplace up here
Sometimes you got to put a shoulder to the door
Not so fast, junior, listen to your pa
You might also like
Here, son
I'm handin' over to you
Don't crash the ambulance
Whatever you do

What we have here's a dung hole place
Thought it was fly shit on the map
Fat bastard, ugly face
Oh, and the personal crap
You can't move the barriers
You can't mess with oil and gas
Had to go down there, stick a couple
Aircraft carriers in his ass

Fancy dress, medals chest
It's all in here, for all the gigs
Gas mask, bulletproof vest
All the usual rigs
There'll be things they missed, they didn't mention
You've even got a whistle in there for attracting attention

Well I think you're gonna be okay, son
You've had the tour, I guess
These two buttons, by the way
This one I hope you never press
Some holy fool, just watch
Who's not like you or me
That one's the whole shootin' match right there
It's the whole shitaree
We don't forget who put us here, Jack
That's page one
We talk soft, carry a big stick
Pack the biggest gun
We don't like accidents, major or minor
You don't want yourself an incident, don't ever invade China

Here, son
I'm handin' over to you
Don't crash the ambulance
Ohh, here son
I'm handin' over to you
Don't crash the ambulance
