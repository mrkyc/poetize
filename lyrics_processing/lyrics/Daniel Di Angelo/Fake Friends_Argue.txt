" Fake friends are enemies " I can't hear that enough
Ain't want to talk to you, I just wanted to fuck
My brain is negative, without saying too much
I want to tell her that she's the bang for my buck
Now we unite, in a second you fall in love
First for my natural, then it's all in the cuff
See our discussions are never to be discussed
If you disgust me I'll leave you here in disgust
" Fake friends are enemies " I can't hear that enough
Ain't want to talk to you, I just wanted to fuck
My brain is negative, without saying too much

Verse 1:
Now you and I are from the city of all the buzz
The music's low and the breeze is taking you off
You might be falling but really for me it's lust
You said you're so wet that your panties keep slipping off
Fallin' fallin' fallin' for my.. I don't really care
You're just like my barbie doll, undress you everywhere
" Sorry sorry sorry " is my never say it prayer
I ain't giving up my cut just cause you're up in my hair
I'm sick, my brain is a medication for cough
You told me " Take it off ", I told you " Take it off "
Baby it's not my problem, baby it's not my fault if you finish before I..

Verse 2:
She thinks it's the same shit, every night
And I don't never argue
Nobody else can do it like we used to, that's every night
And even on them rainy days, we'd take flight
You make me feel like I'm just a little boy
I want to tell you, " mama give me my toys "
I think I found the spot that makes you make noise
So I'ma hit that sweet love, like Commodores
Chorus 2:
Said we don't ever argue the same day
If she don't want to come through, it's okay
But she always see's me from Monday through Sunday
She thinks I'm the messiah, like " Ole', Ole' "
Said we don't ever argue the same day
If she don't want to come through, it's okay
But she always see's me from Monday through Sunday
