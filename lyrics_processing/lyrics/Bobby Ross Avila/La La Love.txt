Takes so long for
The day to go by
Whenever you're away
Can't hardly wait
Till I see you tonight
Let's watch this clock
Speed up the hand of time
Baby, maybe
Some things will change
But this one remains the same
And I know it will cause it's
The way I feel about you

Every time I think a happy thought
I think of you and your la la love
It's because I'm in love with you
Anytime I want the best in love
I think of sharing your la la love
It's because I'm in love with you

Things ain't quite the same
Without the sparkle of your eyes
Tonight, a lonely night
I promise you that we'll be together
Girl, believe in me
I would never let you down
