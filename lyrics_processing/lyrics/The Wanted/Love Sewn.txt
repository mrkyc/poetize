Yeah, we fell, we fell so hard
We sold out
Yeah, we fray and fade away
We never cut loose
There's nobody but you
Nobody else (Nobody else)

Yeah, we feel, we feel
All of the same things
You find, you find
All of my secrets
Locked up deep inside of me
I know you're always right, always right

So save your words
I'm bleeding inside
You say you're hurt
Got nowhere left to hide
And all these times
You're slipping away from me
Bring me to my knees

Now I'm lying on the floor
With no one else to blame
Torn apart, I know that I messed it up again
Now I don't recognize just what we used to be
And I can see us tearing at the seams
We cover up the scars and never let them go
Stitch up our broken hearts
This love is sewn (This love is sewn)
You might also like
Yeah, we try, we try
To leave them behind
All our mistakes
We stumble through a million fights
Every time we twist the knife we forgive, never forget
Never forget

So save your words
I'm bleeding inside
You say you're hurt
Got nowhere left to hide
And all this time
You're slipping away from me
Bring me to my knees

Now I'm lying on the floor
With no one else to blame
Torn apart, I know that I messed it up again
Now I don't recognize just what we used to be
And I can see us tearing at the seams
We cover up the scars and never let them go
Stitch up our broken hearts
This love is sewn (Sewn)
This love is sewn (Sewn)
This love is sewn (Sewn)
This love is sewn (Sewn)
This love is sewn
Yea we fell, we fell so hard
We sold out
Yea, we fray and fade away
We never cut loose
There's nobody but you
Nobody else

Now I'm lying on the floor
With no one else to blame
Torn apart, I know that I messed it up again
Now I don't recognize what what we used to be
And I can see us tearing at the seams
We cover up the scars and never let them go
Stitch up our broken hearts
This love is sewn (This love is sewn)
This love is sewn, this love is sewn
This love is sewn, this love is sewn
This love is sewn, this love is sewn
