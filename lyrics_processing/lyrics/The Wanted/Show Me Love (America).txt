You should've known I love you
Though I'll never say it too much
Maybe you didn't get me
Maybe I'll never know what I'd done

Now I'm lost in the distance
You look at me like a stranger
'Cause how it looks right now to me
Is you were scared of the danger

I could've shown you America
All the bright lights of the universe
We could've reached the highest heights
A different place, a different life
Remember that night underneath the stars?
For a minute, I thought the world was ours
All you had to do was show me love

Yeah, it's true, you know I'm not perfect
There's a fire inside of me
It means I'll fight for the things that are worth it
If it makes me feel complete
'Cause I'm hitting rocks, and I'm taking shots
I'm prepared to lose everything I've got
You might also like
Now I'm lost in the distance
You look at me like a stranger
'Cause how it looks right now to me
Nothing can save us

I could've shown you America
All the bright lights of the universe
We could've reached the highest heights
A different place, a different life
Remember that night underneath the stars?
For a minute, I thought the world was ours
All you had to do was show me love

Show me love, love (Show me love)
Show me love, love (Hey)
Show me love, love
(Show me, show me love)
(Show me, show me love)
Show me love, love
(Show me, show me love)
Love, love (Ooh-hoo)
Love, love (Show me love, yeah)
I could've shown you America
All the bright lights of the universe (Universe)
We could've reached the highest heights (Yeah)
A different place, a different life (Ooh)
Remember that night underneath the stars?
For a minute, I thought the world was ours
All you had to do was show me love
