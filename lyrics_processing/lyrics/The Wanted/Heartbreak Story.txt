She was staring out the window
And the snow, it was falling
Seemed like everything I used to know
Mm, it was crumbling
She cannot cope and it hurts inside her mind
Couldn't let it go, let it go
Couldn't bear to ever be alone
She wondered how this had happened

He gave you up and then he let you down
And all the trust is broken now
You can't remember how it used to be
Doesn't have to be a heartbreak story
Just say you'll let me in your heart
I should've been there from the start
I promise you as long as you're with me
There'll never be a heartbreak story

Girl, there is no need to hide away
What's done is done now
Tangled up, you and I lay
Here together as one now
I'll surround you and keep you safe
Everyday, everyday
I know you never like to be alone
And now you don't have to
You might also like
He gave you up and then he let you down
And all the trust is broken now
Can't remember how it used to be
Doesn't have to be a heartbreak story
Just say you'll let me in your heart
I should've been there from the start
I promise you as long as you're with me
There'll never be a heartbreak story

Oh, there'll never be a heartbreak story, yeah

He gave you up and then he let you down
And all the trust is broken now
You can't remember how it used to be
Doesn't have to be a heartbreak story
Just say you'll let me in your heart
I should've been there from the start
I promise you as long as you're with me
There'll never be a heartbreak story
I promise you as long as you're with me
