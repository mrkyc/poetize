You're in control, pressing pause on my heartbeat
Someone stole all the air so I can't speak now
I know the chase is on
I feel as though my time has come
How many times do I fly through your head space?
Now it's speeding away from the safe place

Yeah, your skin
The touch, the kiss
The rush too much
And here it comes

When your lips touch mine
It's the kiss of life
I know, I know that it's a little bit frightening
We might as well be playing with lightning
We touch like, like it's our first time
I know that it's a little bit frightening
We might as well be playing with lightning now

Just you and me and the coats in the back room
Learning things they don't teach in the classroom
Now, you're here
I feel the fear
But everything is, oh, so clear
I've been addicted to you
Since the first hit
Out of control like a surge of electric
You might also like
Yeah, your skin
The touch, the kiss
The rush too much
And here it comes

When your lips touch mine
It's the kiss of life
I know, I know that it's a little bit frightening
We might as well be playing with lightning
We touch like, like it's our first time
I know that it's a little bit frightening
We might as well be playing with lightning now

Your skin, the touch
The kiss, too much
Your skin, the touch
The kiss, the rush
Your skin, the touch
The kiss, too much
The rush, the rush
The rush, the rush

When your lips touch mine
It's the kiss of life
I know, I know that it's a little bit frightening
We might as well be playing with lightning
We touch like, like it's our first time
I know that it's a little bit frightening
