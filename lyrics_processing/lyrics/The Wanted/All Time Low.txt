Praying won't do it, hating won't do it
Drinking won't do it, fighting won't knock you out
Of my head
Hiding won't hide it, smiling won't hide it
Like I ain't tried it, everyone's tried it now
And failed somehow

So when you gonna let me?
When you gonna let me out, out?

And if you know
How do you get up from an all time low?
I'm in pieces, it seems like peace is
The only thing I'll never know
How do you get up, get up?

'Cause driving won't do it, flying won't do it
Denying won't do it, crying won't drown it out
What you said
When I'm standing on the yellow line
Waiting at the station
Or I'm late for work, a vital presentation
If you call me now girl without reservation
I would try to break through

And if you know
How do you get up from an all time low?
I'm in pieces, it seems like peace is
The only thing I'll never know
How do you get up from an all time low?
I can't even find a place to start
How do I choose between my head and heart?
'Til it ceases, I'll never know, know, know, know
How do you get up from an all time low?

A low, a low, a low, a low, a low, a low, a low
Can you hear me?
A low, a low, a low, a low, a low, a low, a low
Can't you hear me?
A low, a low, a low, a low, a low, a low, a low
Can you hear me?
A low, a low, a low, a low, a low, a low, a low

And if you know
How do you get up from an all time low?
I'm in pieces, it seems like peace is
The only thing I'll never know
How do you get up from an all time low?
I can't even find a place to start
How do I choose between my head and heart?
'Til it ceases, I'll never know
How do you get up from an all time low?
I can't even find a place to start
How do I choose between my head and heart?
'Til it ceases, I'll never know
