She wants me to come over, I can tell her eyes don't lie
She's calling me in the dark
She moves, I swear the room around her lights up like the sky
Confidence like a rockstar

I wanna put my hands on her hands, feel the heat from her skin
Get reckless in the starlight
I'm moving to the beat of her heart, I was so lost until tonight Tonight

I found you in the darkest hour
I found you in the pouring rain
I found you when I was on my knees
And your light brought me back again
Found you in a river of pure emotion
I found you, my only truth
I found you and the music played
I was lost

'Til I found you, you, you
'Til I found you, you, you

The night is getting older and I can't come off this high
I don't want this here to end
I know she feels the same 'cause I can see it in her eyes
She says, "Can we start again?"
You might also like
I wanna put my hands on her hands, feel the heat from her skin
Get reckless in the starlight
She's moving to the beat of my heart, we were so lost until tonight
Tonight

I found you in the darkest hour
I found you in the pouring rain
I found you when I was on my knees
And your light brought me back again
Found you in a river of pure emotion
I found you, my only truth
I found you and the music played
I was lost

'Til I found you, you, you
'Til I found you, you, you

I said, "People
We're all looking for love tonight
But sometimes we can't see it
We're all blinded by the light"
And we all get low, all get low
Searching for that peace of mind
Just when I'd given up
Looking for some kind of sign
That's when I found you, you, you
I found you, you, you
I found you, you, you
I found you, you, you
I found you in my darkest hour
I found you in the pouring rain
I found you when I was on my knees
And your light brought me back again
Found you in a river of gold emotion
I found you, my only truth
I found you in the music playing
I was lost
