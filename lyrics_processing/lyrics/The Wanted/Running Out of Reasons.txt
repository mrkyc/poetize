Oh, woah, you're running out of reasons

Shut it out
What you heard about, what you heard about me
They say I'm rough, raw, loud
But they don't know nothing, not a thing about me

So tear up that list of things you wrote down, wrote down
Why you can never be with me now, not now
I know where you wanna be

You wanna say "No, no, it ain't gon' work" (Oh)
But then you fumble your words (Oh)
Oh, woah, you're running out of reasons
No, no, tell all your lies (Oh)
But why are your lips on mine? (Oh)
Oh, woah, you're running out of reasons

Just let the fire burn, burn, girl
Some things you can't unlearn, learn, so
Fall, fall, let it all go (Oh)
'Fess up, you already know that
Oh, woah, you're running out of reasons
You might also like
Stand right there, you'll never get nowhere
When you run like you do, like you do
It's no, no fair, I'm sure, that your secret's out
Everyone sees right through you

So tear up that list of things you wrote down, wrote down
Why you can never be with me now, not now
I know where you wanna be, yeah

You wanna say "No, no, it ain't gon' work" (Oh)
But then you fumble your words (Oh)
Oh, woah, you're running out of reasons
No, no, tell all your lies (Oh)
But why are your lips on mine? (Oh)
Oh, woah, you're running out of reasons

Just let the fire burn, burn, girl
Some things you can't unlearn, learn, so
Fall, fall, let it all go (Oh)
'Fess up, you already know that
Oh, woah, you're running out of reasons
There never was, never was a bad time to
Love somebody, so love me, baby, yeah
Never was, never was a better feeling
Than just saying, "Yeah," yeah (Oh, woah)

You wanna say "No, no, it ain't gon' work" (Oh)
But then you fumble your words (Oh)
Oh, woah, you're running out of reasons
No, no, tell all your lies (Oh)
But why are your lips on mine? (Oh)
Oh, woah, you're running out of reasons

Just let the fire burn, burn, girl
Some things you can't unlearn, learn so
Fall, fall, let it all go
'Fess up, you already know that
