Hey, I see a secret in your face
Did someone steal you away?
Is there someone else in my place?
I don't like this game
I, I can see the dirt in your hands
'Cause I know the way that you dance
Don't cover up cause it shows, mm
I wish you would

Stop right now what you're doing, I know
I got a needle in my brain and a nick in my bones
I cannot do a damn thing 'cause nobody's home
And it's hell, oh, yeah, now I say

All my life, I played like a winner
Now all I see looking back in the mirror
Demons in my head, the demons in my head, oh, oh
All this time, the saint was a sinner
The joke's on me, a stone cold killer
Demons in my head, the demons in my head, oh oh

You have a natural sway
And you know how sweet you taste
But I can't take your flame
Like a bullet through my veins
As you scratch beneath my skin
My resistance crumbling
I cover up but it shows
But I guess you know again
You might also like
Stop right now what you're doing, I know
I got a needle in my brain and a nick in my bones
I cannot do a damn thing 'cause nobody's home
And it's hell, oh, yeah, now I say

All my life, I played like a winner
Now all I see looking back in the mirror
Demons in my head, the demons in my head, oh, oh
All this time, the saint was a sinner
The joke's on me, a stone cold killer
Demons in my head, the demons in my head, oh, oh

All this time, I said all this time
All this time, all this time
All this time, I said all this time (Oh)
All this time, all this time

All my life, I played like a winner
Now all I see looking back in the mirror
Demons in my head (Demons in my head)
The demons in my head, oh, oh (The demons in my head)
All this time, the saint was a sinner
The joke's on me, a stone cold killer
Demons in my head, the demons in my head, oh, oh (Oh)
All my life, I played like a winner
Now all I see looking back in the mirror
Demons in my head, the demons in my head, oh, oh (All this time)
All this time, the saint was a sinner
The joke's on me, a stone cold killer
Demons in my head, the demons in my head, oh, oh
