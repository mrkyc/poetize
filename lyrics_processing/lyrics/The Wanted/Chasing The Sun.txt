I'm better, so much better now
I see the light, touch the light, we're together now
I'm better, so much better now
Look to the skies, gives me life, we're together now

We've only just begun, hypnotised by drums
Until forever comes, you'll find us chasing the sun
They said this day wouldn't come, we refused to run
We've only just begun, you'll find us chasing the sun

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, you'll find us chasing the sun
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, you'll find us chasing the sun

And when the daylight's fadin'
We're gonna play in the dark till it's golden again
And now it feels so amazing
Can't see it coming, I will never grow old again
You'll find us chasing the sun

I'm never, I'm never down
Lying here, staring up, and you're looking down
I'm never, I'm never down
Live forever, forever with you around
You might also like
We've only just begun, hypnotised by drums
Until forever comes, you'll find us chasing the sun
They said this day wouldn't come, we refused to run
We've only just begun, you'll find us chasing the sun
The sun, the sun, the sun, the sun, the sun
You'll find us chasing the sun

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, you'll find us chasing the sun
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, you'll find us chasing the sun

And when daylight's fadin'
We're gonna play in the dark till it's golden again
And now it feels so amazing
Can't see it coming, I will never grow old again
You'll find us chasing the sun

Chasing the sun
Chasing the sun
You'll find us chasing the sun
You'll find us chasing the sun
And when the daylight's fadin'
We're gonna play in the dark till it's golden again
And now it feels so amazing
Can't see it coming, I will never grow old again
You'll find us chasing the sun
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, you'll find us chasing the sun
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
