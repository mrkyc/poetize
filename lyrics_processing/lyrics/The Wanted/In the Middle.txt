When I was young, I read stories where princes won
As I grew up, I thought the stories were wrong
But to you girl, I am faithful
I've fallen so hard that it's painful
And when it hurts, I know the feelings are real

I'll let nothing in the middle, nothing in the middle
Of me and you, of me and you
Nothing in the middle, in the middle of us
I love the way we fight and stay up all night
And the way you look in the morning light
I'll let nothing in the middle, in the middle of us

I don't know, how the story of us unfolds
Or if when we're old, we'll still be together at all

But to you girl, I am faithful, I've fallen so hard that
It's painful
And when it hurts I know the feelings are real

I'll let nothing in the middle, nothing in the middle
Of me and you, of me and you
Nothing in the middle, in the middle of us
I love the way we fight and stay up all night
And the way you look in the morning light
I'll let nothing in the middle, in the middle of us
You might also like
When I feel you breathe in my arms at night
When I feel you breathe as I hold you tight
I believe we are meant to be, meant to be
We are meant to be

When I was young, I read stories where princes won
As I grew up, I thought the stories were wrong

I'll let nothing in the middle, nothing in the middle
Of me and you, of me and you
Nothing in the middle, in the middle of us
I love the way we fight and stay up all night
And the way you look in the morning light
I'll let nothing in the middle, in the middle of us
