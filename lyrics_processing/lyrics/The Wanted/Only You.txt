How can I hold a mirror up to your eyes?
Speak the way you can understand what's inside?
You've been broken down in a thousand different ways
I've been looking over pictures and you hardly look the same
I can see it from a mile that the way you smile has changed
But you don't know

It's hard for me to sit and watch you getting sick
When all I wanna do is try

Only you can dig yourself out
Just before you break down, yeah
Only you can lift yourself up
Just before you get stuck, yeah
All of this pain spread all over your face
All I wanna do is help you out of this place
Only you
So hurry up now just before you run out of time
Before you run out of time

Beautiful, that's the only way I see you
Nobody else can love you in the way that I do
Sometimes I get worried that you've taken on too much
And this crazy world we live in doesn't really give a fuck
If only we could pedal to a place where it was just you and I
