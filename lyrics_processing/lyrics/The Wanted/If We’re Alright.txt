I know you can't be sleeping
'Cus you're not anywhere near me
All the way on the other side
Wish that I could read your mind
(Verse)
I'm kissing on your shoulder
But you don't wanna turn over
You know I'd rather have another fight
Than be a victim of a silent night
(Chorus)
You can scream and let it out
I will fix it, tell me how
You can say the words
And I'll be wrong as long as we're alright
Call me names, I'll take them all
This time I'll take the fall
And I'll be wrong as long as we're alright
(Verse)
Did I hurt your feelings?
You should know I don't mean it
Don't disguise it, let it all out
Takes my fault whatever you like now
You might also like(Verse)
Used to talk, used to talk
We could talk about everything
So what's wrong? Let me know
'Cause I can do anything
I'm no good if your heart breaks
So I'll do whatever it takes
(Chorus)
You can scream and let it out
I will fix it, tell me how
You can say the words
And I'll be wrong as long as we're alright
Call me names, I'll take them all
This time I'll take the fall
And I'll be wrong as long as we're alright
(Bridge)
Tick, tock, looking at the clock
If we take a minute we can make it all stop
Tick, tock, when we're gonna talk?
Get it out your head, baby give me all you got tonight
Let me make it better
(Chorus x2)
You can scream and let it out
I will fix it, tell me how
You can say the words
And I'll be wrong as long as we're alright
Call me names, I'll take them all
This time I'll take the fall
And I'll be wrong as long as we're alright
And I'll be wrong as long as we're alright
