I see you walk away, walk away
So why you looking back at me like that like that?
If you're not messing with, messing with me
Then why you go on and kiss me like that? (Like that?)

My head is killing me, killing me girl
Are you telling me stay or go?

If I can't have you, why won't you let me go?
If you don't want me, say it on the radio
So go on, go on, go on, just play it
Come on, come on, come on, you'll never say it
That you don't want me, cause you can't let me go, me go

Monday and you're all over me
Now it's Friday and you're MIA
And if you're letting go, letting go of me
Then why you go on and hold me that way that way?

The chase is killing me, killing me girl
Now I'm telling you stay or go
You might also like
If I can't have you, why won't you let me go?
If you don't want me, say it on the radio
So go on, go on, go on, just play it
Come on, come on, come on, you'll never say it
That you don't want me, cause you can't let me go, me go

Now I've gone and said it all
Now I'm here out in the open
Don't say another time, another place, another face

If I can't have you, why won't you let me go?
If you don't want me, say it on the radio
So go on, go on, go on, just play it
Come on, come on, come on, you'll never say it
That you don't want me
Cause you can't let me go, me go

Cause you can't let me go, me go
(So go on, go on, go on)
