May our hearts be full like our drinks tonight
May we sing and dance till we lose our minds
We are only young if we seize the night
Tonight we own the night
Tonight we own the night

La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la

When my time is over, lying in my grave
Written on my tombstone, I want it to say
"This man was a legend, a legend of his time
When he was at a party, the party never died"

Hey, everybody's got a dream
So what do you say, are we making history?

May our hearts be full like our drinks tonight
May we sing and dance till we lose our minds
We are only young if we seize the night
Tonight we own the night (Tonight we own the night)
Tonight we own the night (Tonight we own)

La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la

For tonight I'm famous, for tonight I'm king
And I will be remembered for centuries, they'll say
"This man was a hero, a hero of the night
When he was at a party, the party never died"

Hey, I'm a little drunk
But I got something to say (Hold your jars)

May our hearts be full like our drinks tonight
May we sing and dance till we lose our minds
We are only young if we seize the night
Tonight we own the night
And let us wake up inside a stranger's bed
Let us drink until there is nothing left
And this night, my friends, we will not forget
Tonight we own the night (Tonight we own the night)
Tonight we own the night (Tonight we own)
May our hearts be full like our drinks tonight
May we sing and dance till we lose our minds
We are only young if we seize the night
Tonight we own the night
