Mhm, mhm

Baby, come over here
I just gotta tell you something, something
There's nothing left to fear
There's nothing that can hurt you, nothing
We could take on the bodies of angels
Away from everyone
Touch as we circle the world
You and me, on the run

So put your hands up to the sky
Yeah, put 'em up
Follow me if you wanna fly
I'll show you love
Put your hands up to the sky, inside of mine
When we touch, we get so high

Like a satellite
I don't wanna come down, I just want your love now
Like a satellite
I don't wanna come down, I just want your love now
Baby, hold on tight

Look at the stars above
We're the only thing that's brighter, brighter
Tonight you can feel the love
The way I feel around you, lighter
We could take on the bodies of angels
Away from everyone
Touch as we circle the world
You and me, on the run

So put your hands up to the sky
Yeah, put 'em up
Follow me if you wanna fly
I'll show you love
Put your hands up to the sky, inside of mine
When we touch, we get so high

Like a satellite
I don't wanna come down, I just want your love now
Like a satellite
I don't wanna come down, I just want your love now
Baby, hold on tight

The way I feel around you, lighter
The way I feel around you
Baby, hold on tight
Baby, hold on tight
Like a satellite
I don't wanna come down, I just want your love now
Like a satellite
I don't wanna come down, I just want your love now
Baby, hold on tight
I don't wanna come down, I just want your love now
A satellite
I don't wanna come down, I just want your love now
