I'm pretty sure you've heard of me
I'm a local celebrity
But not the kind you look to Hollywood for
No flashing lights or autographs
In fact, people avoid me if they can
I got no fans hanging right outside of my door
And I hear them whispering when I pass
Saying to each other "Is that the man?"
With a broken heart
Cause you tore it apart

Now everybody knows my name
Everybody feels my pain
But you don't even care
You're so unaware
I'm left to deal with the shame
Now everybody knows that I'm
Just a bum without you by my side
Welcome to the show
Everybody knows
Everyone but you
Everyone but you

I've got a thousand friends that follow me
Just to read about my misery
I'm popular for reasons that I ha-a-ate
And I, I strike up the conversation
Most time with total strangers
Anyone who will listen to my fate
But they shake their heads and they walk away
And all I'm left with is this fame
And a broken heart
Cause you tore it apart
You might also like
And now everybody knows my name
Everybody feels my pain
But you don't even a care
Yes, you're unaware
I'm left to deal with the shame
Now everybody knows that I'm
Just a bum without you by my side
Welcome to the show
Everybody knows
Everyone but you
Everyone but you
Everyone but you...

Now if I die today would you even come?
Written on my grave would say
"Here, lies someone with a broken heart
'Cause she tore it apart"

Everybody knows my name
Everybody feels my pain
But you don't even care
You're so unaware
And I'm left to deal with the shame
Everybody knows that I'm
Just a bum without you by my side
Welcome to the show
Everybody knows
Everyone but you
Everyone but you
Everyone but you...
I'm pretty sure you've heard of me
I'm a local celebrity
