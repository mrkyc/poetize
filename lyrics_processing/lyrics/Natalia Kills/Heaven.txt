Yesterday you were in front of me
Woke up this morning
All of a sudden you're a memory
Oh, if life is as short as they say it is
I guess we'll meet again sooner than we think we will
And they say a picture says a thousand words
But I would trade a thousand pictures to hear one of yours
And I've been saying prayers, like I was writing you letters
'Cause if heaven's far like I think it is, you wouldn't get 'em

I know heaven must be beautiful right now
Since they got you, babe
Since they got you, babe
I know heaven must be beautiful right now
Since they got you, babe
Since they took you, babe

They say that God is full of mysteries
Sometimes I wonder if you tell him that you're missing me
'Cause I miss you every day, like they took summer away
Like they took color away
And this grey needs to get the hell away from me
And I'm jealous of the angels, 'cause they see you every day
And I see you when I'm dreaming, but it doesn't feel the same
I know my heart is broken, you can have it anyway
If I could only see you again, again
You might also like
I know heaven must be beautiful right now
Since they got you, babe
Since they got you, babe
I know heaven must be beautiful right now
Since they got you, babe
Since they took you, babe

Give my life for one last time with you, with you
Give my life for one last time with you, with you

Got my space suit on, gonna blast off
Take a vacation to where you are
Hoping heaven ain't all that far
You passed me by on a shooting star
'Cause I wish so bad, one last chance
Take me back to the photograph
I close my eyes and I feel your laughter
But all I got is a frame and a glasses
Is it selfishness?
Should've made a room for the both of us
Loneliness
I'm not lost but I've got no direction
Parachute gone and I'm falling fast
My heart stopped but I'm still breathing
So numb but still I'm feeling
The less I look, the more I'm seeing
I just lost my hero
I know heaven must be beautiful right now
Since they got you, babe
Since they got you, babe
I know heaven must be beautiful right now
Since they got you, babe
