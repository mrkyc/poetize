Chivalry is dead
But I am not ready to let it go, let it go
Chivalry is dead, but boy believe it that I need it so
I need it so
I need a gentle, gentle, gentle oh
Gentle, gentle, gentleman
I need a man
I need a gentle, gentle, gentle oh
Gentle, gentle, gentleman
Chivalry is dead but I am not ready to let it go

I want a man to bring home to mama
Got his game tight and there ain't no drama
Calls in the night
Ring, ring baby mama
Cheque comes, no, he ain't forgot that wallet
Rich man, poor man, hustler, whatever
Tough guys tough, but they never been clever
Don't be the butler, just have manners
Better put 'em on display or it ain't gon' happen
Boy, your jeans so baggy, baggy
You don't got to dress like Donald Trump
But your eligibleness
Could be the difference
Between a kiss
Or being invited up
I gotta have a gentleman
Open up the door and he holds my hand
I could have a thug, but it ain't no match
'Cause a thug can do what a gentleman can
You might also like
I'll teach you some manners, manners
I see you can manage, manage
Soften up the thuggish, thuggish
Polish up the rugged, rugged
I'll teach you some manners, manners
I see you can manage, manage
Soften up the thuggish, thuggish
Polish up the rugged, rugged

Chivalry is dead
But I am not ready to let it go, let it go
Chivalry is dead, but boy believe it that I need it so
I need it so
I need a gentle, gentle, gentle oh
Gentle, gentle, gentleman
I need a man
I need a gentle, gentle, gentle oh
Gentle, gentle, gentleman
Chivalry is dead but I am not ready to let it go

Call my name
Don't call me babygirl
Girl? I thought I was your lady?
He should be sophisticated
Buy a magazine
Girl, read me Shakesphere
To be or not to be?
So manly, but curteously
These feminists got me doin' everything
Now we must be the alpha females
I want my apron back
I'll rub your back late, late at night
So baby just treat, treat me nice
You ain't polite?
You ain't my type!
Oh, I gotta have a gentleman
Open up the door and he holds my hand
I could have a thug, but it ain't no match
'Cause a thug can do what a gentleman can
I'll teach you some manners, manners
I see you can manage, manage
Soften up the thuggish, thuggish
Polish up the rugged, rugged
I'll teach you some manners, manners
I see you can manage, manage
Soften up the thuggish, thuggish
Polish up the rugged, rugged

Chivalry is dead
But I am not ready to let it go, let it go
Chivalry is dead, but boy believe it that I need it so
I need it so
I need a gentle, gentle, gentle oh
Gentle, gentle, gentleman
I need a man
I need a gentle, gentle, gentle oh
Gentle, gentle, gentleman
Chivalry is dead but I am not ready to let it go

Broken hearts, loneliness
Feminist, empowerment
Fatherless, abandonment
Ch-ch-chivalry is dead
Pump, pump
Quick, revive it!
Stop! It's flatlining!
Ch-ch-chivalry is dead
Long live the gentleman
Chivalry is dead
But I am not ready to let it go, let it go
Chivalry is dead, but boy believe it that I need it so
I need it so
I need a gentle, gentle, gentle oh
Gentle, gentle, gentleman
I need a man
I need a gentle, gentle, gentle oh
Gentle, gentle, gentleman
