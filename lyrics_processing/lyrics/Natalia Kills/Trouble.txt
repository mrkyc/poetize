Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I'm trouble, I'm trouble
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I'm trouble, I'm trouble

Hey lover, come and be my alibi
I'm gonna burn down the house tonight
Ride with me, I know your friends say that I'm trouble
Hold me down in the siren lights
Love me even when my lies ain't white
Light the fuse on the dynamite, I'm trouble

And oh, oh, oh
It's the only way I know, oh, oh
My daddy taught me so, oh, oh
When he said to me
"Don't look back when you walk away
I'm the best mistake you'll ever make"

I'm trouble, I'm trouble
Oh, whoa, oh, oh, oh
Oh, whoa, oh, oh, oh
Oh, whoa, oh, oh, oh
I'm trouble, I'm trouble

Learn your lines, get your story straight
Broken bottles gonna seal your fate
Happiness is just a glass away, I'm trouble
Breath me in, like the summer nights
It's only a mistake if we don't survive
Kids grown up, but we're not alright, we're trouble

And oh, oh, oh
It's the only way I know, oh, oh
My daddy taught me so, oh, oh
When he said to me
"Don't look back when you walk away
I'm the best mistake you'll ever make"
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I'm trouble, I'm trouble
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I'm trouble, I'm trouble

One, two for your bad tattoos and
Three, four, sneaking in through my window
Boy, we grew up bad
But we never had nothing but each other
Save your innocence for the next life
Never let them make you think twice
When the wreckage flies
'Cause this life don't last forever, babe

And oh, oh, oh
It's the only way I know, oh, oh
My daddy taught me so, oh, oh
When he said to me
"Don't look back when you walk away
I'm the best mistake you'll ever make"
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I'm trouble, I'm trouble
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I'm trouble, I'm trouble

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
