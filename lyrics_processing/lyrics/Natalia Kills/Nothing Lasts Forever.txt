You got a face like a doll
Will it last forever? no
I just want you beautiful
(you don't need to think about it)
Tell me things I wanna hear
Take the truth, I'll take the dare
Feed me lies and eat my fear
(cut the chase and get right to it)

We might never meet again
(this might be the last time)
Kiss me like the world will end
(press your lips right up my spine)
Pull that shirt, I'll pull the shade
(dirty secrets, dirty lies)
You can be my last regret
My last regret

You're beautiful, don't know your name
It's all the same
Nothing lasts forever, babe
You take it off, I throw it all away
I gave it to you first
Nothing lasts forever, babe
You might also like
(Cash, cars, girls, boys)
Nothing lasts forever, babe
(Hot nights, bright lights)
Nothing lasts forever, babe
(True love, first touch)
Nothing lasts forever
Nothing lasts forever
Nothing lasts forever, babe

You taste like I like it, raw
Acid mixed with alcohol
Set me up to take the fall
(nothing I can do about it)
Hey, don't take it personal
Work the pain, I'm versatile
Quick, before they nuke it all
(no one gives a fuck about it)

We might never meet again
(this might be the last time)
Kiss me like the world will end
(press your lips right up my spine)
Pull that shirt, I'll pull the shade
(dirty secrets, dirty lies)
You can be my last regret
My last regret
You're beautiful, don't know your name
It's all the same
Nothing lasts forever, babe
You take it off, I throw it all away
I gave it to you first
Nothing lasts forever, babe

(Cash, cars, girls, boys)
Nothing lasts forever, babe
(Hot nights, bright lights)
Nothing lasts forever, babe
(True love, first touch)
Nothing lasts forever
Nothing lasts forever
Nothing lasts forever, babe

You're beautiful (cash)
Don't know your name (whores)
Nothing lasts forever, baby (bright lights)
You take it off (love)
Throw it all away (first touch)
But nothing lasts forever, baby
No, nothing lasts forever, baby
Nothing lasts for ever, baby
Nothing lasts forever
Nothing lasts forever
Nothing lasts forever, babe
(Cash, cars, girls, boys)
Nothing lasts forever, babe
(Hot nights, bright lights)
Nothing lasts forever, babe
(True love, first touch)
Nothing lasts forever
Nothing lasts forever
