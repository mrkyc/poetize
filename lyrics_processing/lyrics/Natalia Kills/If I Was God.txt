Would you love me if you found out I never had no clothes, cars, money?
No clothes, cars, money
Would you still want me if I told ya I was not a somebody (somebody)?
Nothing special (nobody)
Yeah, I've been lying, fantasizing that I had it all
I want to give you more than just the person that I was

I wish I was strong
I wish I was everything I'm feeling inside my head
Don't let me wake up
The truth is my enemy
Just tell me you're still here ...

If I was God, what would I change?
(Love, War, Lies, Money)
(Love, War, Lies, Money)
Should we keep on or should we throw me away?

I hate to tell ya, but it's all an illusion from the hair, lashes, nails, body
Hair, lashes, nails, body
I'm scared to disappoint ya, all I really got is just a heartbeat, soul, honest
Heartbeat, soul, honest
It's a secret me I never showed nobody, no
That everything I want is in the pathological

I wish it was real
I wish I had everything I dream of while I'm in bed
Don't let me wake up
The fear of emptiness
Just let me believe it
