Come on, everyone on the dancefloor
What we're gonna do is we're gonna play the music
And you're gonna dance
When the music stops you've got to freeze
Anybody here moves when the music stops
You're out

I just wanna feel myself
I-I just wanna feel myself
I just wanna feel myself
I just, I just wanna feel myself, yeah
I just wanna feel myself
I-I just wanna feel myself
I just wanna feel myself
I just, I just wanna feel myself, yeah

Rich boy manners
Champagne glasses
8-ball habits
18 karats
Check book, cash it
Poodles, lavish
Broke ass bitches
I just wanna feel myself for a minute
I want a guy I can climb like Everest
Got etiquette, real thoroughbred
He don't gotta be the cleverest
Hips and lips and ah, intelligent

First class, fancy
Monogram, matching
Suit up, got a crew cut
Light the room up, Gatsby
I want a guy with rich boy standards
Hamptons, handsome, want it, have it
Pick me up at 8 with 18 flowers
Bulgari box back home at the manor
Love me more than your 8-ball habit
Foreclose the pussy when you close that wallet
Penthouse, pavement, poor girl panic
(Ahhhh! What do you mean there's no more diamonds?)
Love me more than your 8-ball habit

Telling me I dress too loud

Okay, this is the bit where I talk about myself, right?
So after my daddy had got uhm, you know, lost everything and got locked up for a while
I was fourteen and I decided, you know, I was gonna leave home and be a, a somebody or whatever
And uhm, like, numerous failed attempts, bad tv shows, bad record deal, bad everything
And I had moved to Hollywood to be a big star, and ended up living in these motels (I just wanna feel myself) on uh Sunset Boulevard, you know thirty dollars a night, really run-down
And I would go to these clothing stores at the weekends and try on these beautiful clothes
Wearing things that I couldn't ever afford, practicing for when I was gonna be rich
You know, bad boyfriend, no money, no life and suddenly it hit me, what the fuck am I doing with my life?
I just wanna feel myself
I-I just wanna feel myself
I just wanna feel myself
I just, I just wanna feel myself, yeah
I just wanna feel myself
I-I just wanna feel myself
I just wanna feel myself
I just, I just wanna feel myself, yeah

I just wanna feel myself
I-I just wanna feel myself
I just wanna feel myself
I just, I just wanna feel myself, yeah
I just wanna feel myself
I-I just wanna feel myself
I just wanna feel myself
