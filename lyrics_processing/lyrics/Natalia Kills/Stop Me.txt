Father, father
What have you done done, done, done?
You've made a monster
And now I gotta run, run, run, run
Darling, darling
You know I never meant to drag you down
Standing at the bar with your scars and your lonely heart
So let's leave this dead end town

If I, if I run away with you tonight, tonight
We could make the wrongs feel right, so right
We could do some damage
Fuck me in the Paris lights

I put my high heels on so I'm closer to God
I put my high heels on so I'm closer to God
Tonight we're gonna dance to the Devil's drum
And I need someone, need someone
To stop me, stop me
Stop me, stop me
Stop me, stop me
You can't stop me, stop me
Stop me

Baby, baby
I never looked so gorgeous on your arm
Wearing last night's dress like a hot hot mess
All our money's gone gone gone
And maybe, maybe
We're gonna be rich like them someday
Let my lost girl eyes and your guilty mind
Wash clean with the free champagne

If I, if I run away with you tonight, tonight
We could make the wrongs feel right, so right
We could do some damage
Fuck me in the Paris lights

I put my high heels on so I'm closer to God
I put my high heels on so I'm closer to God
Tonight we're gonna dance to the Devil's drum
And I need someone, need someone
To stop me, stop me
Stop me, stop me
Stop me, stop me
You can't stop me, stop me
Stop me
When the night is young
And we look 25 but we're sweet 16
Can I be the one to turn your nightmare into a dream?
When the night is young
And we look 25 but we're sweet 16
Can I be the one to turn your nightmare into a dream?

I put my high heels on so I'm closer to God
I put my high heels on so I'm closer to God
Tonight we're gonna dance to the Devil's drum
And I need someone, need someone
To stop me, stop me
Stop me, stop me
Stop me, stop me
You can't stop me, stop me
