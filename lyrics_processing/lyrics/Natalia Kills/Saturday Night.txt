Mama, you're beautiful tonight
Movie star hair and that black eye
I can't even notice it when you smile so hard through a heartfelt lie
Go kiss the liquor off his laugh
Another suitcase full of cash
Shiny apologies in a velvet box, what a real good man

We drive brand new cars
And we light fine cigars
We shine like small town stars
Through the best days of our lives

We would walk right down the pavement
And know we're gonna be just fine
And I'd put on my dancing shoes real tight
'Cause it's just another Saturday night

Ooh-oh-oh, ooh-oh-oh, ooh-oh-oh
Just another Saturday night
Ooh-oh-oh, ooh-oh-oh

Another fist, another wall
We lose ourselves, we lose it all
I wrote him a hundred times
Can you hear my heart through the prison bars?
The boys I kiss don't know my name
The tears I cry all taste of blame
Bad luck and dirty cops
I'm a fucking teenage tragedy
You might also like
I walk lonely streets
And I talk big time dreams
So hold on before you see
That you're better off without me

'Cause when I look up from the pavement
I know I'm gonna be just fine
And I put on my dancing shoes real tight
'Cause it's just another Saturday night

Ooh-oh-oh, ooh-oh-oh, ooh-oh-oh
Just another Saturday night
Ooh-oh-oh, ooh-oh-oh

There's a rainbow on the bathroom door again
Where the lipstick slides and the pearls all fly, oh
I'm gone and I ain't coming back this time
I'm gonna find my home underneath the city lights, oh

Pills fall like diamonds from my purse
Right out the hole in my fur coat
Straight down the gutter goes my antidote to a broken girl
I promise I'll be the one you want
Don't tell me I'm unfixable
You don't know what it's like to be seventeen with no place to go
But give me just one night
And I'll be almost fine
Remind me one more time
It's the best days of my life

'Cause when I look up from the pavement
I know I'm gonna be just fine
And I'll put on my dancing shoes real tight
'Cause it's just another Saturday night

Ooh-oh-oh, ooh-oh-oh, ooh-oh-oh
Just another Saturday night
Ooh-oh-oh, ooh-oh-oh
'Cause it's just another Saturday night
Ooh-oh-oh, ooh-oh-oh, ooh-oh-oh
Just another Saturday night
Ooh-oh-oh, ooh-oh-oh, ooh-oh-oh
'Cause it's just another Saturday night

(Oh) 'Cause it's just another Saturday night
(Oh) 'Cause it's just another Saturday night
(Oh) 'Cause it's just another Saturday night
