Yeah
I'ma take you back to school
Listen

You about a five, I'm a nine, do the math, baby
Double, you ain't half of my twenty-four carat, baby
You say we have chemistry, I say it's biology
That don't change the fact that we ain't got the numerology

I want a top hat, and you a Benny Boy
Fly chick like me can have any boy
You rock Trapstar? I got twenty, boy
Car five star, yeah I get plenty more
I'm She-Ra, I need a He-Man
Me off my feet, he'll be sweeping
I need a super, not a Jimmy Neutron
Baby, the only thing you're saving is coupons
Got a car like a can of SpaghettiOs
Got the rims looking like they're aluminum
I got a chain with the custom cubicon
Sittin' on a plane to Japan you ain't getting on
You with your best friend, your game console at your's mom home
In the dark, at the living room
I'm with my best friend, we ain't impressed, man
You have four, three, two, one

You about a five, I'm a nine, do the math, baby
Double, you ain't half of my twenty-four carat, baby
You say we have chemistry, I say it's biology
That don't change the fact that we ain't got the numerology

You gettin' looks, think you got the tactics
Lick your lips for the sixth time you walk past me
Ladies laughing like "He's so tragic"
Romancin' the mirror 'cause you got to practice
You remind me of the movie Home Alone (Why?)
'Cause you always home alone (Why?)
Every minute gotta check your phone (Why?)
Ain't the girl from last night call? (Why?)
She lost your number again
Blocked you from her MySpace messages
Made a new e-mail, told all her friends
That if they see you in the streets, just pretend she dead
Yeah, you can call me Ms. Cappuccini
First name basis is not a freebie
You can have my number but the minute you try
You 'bout to hear this (Access denied)

You about a five, I'm a nine, do the math, baby

X equals Y, it don't equal you and I
The most basic of equations
Boy, you really ain't my type, no
