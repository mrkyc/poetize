Oh woah oh
I'm trouble
I'm trouble

Hey lover come and be my alibi
I'm gonna burn down the house tonight...
Ride with me even though your friends say that I'm trouble
Hold me down in the siren lights
Love me even when my lies ain't white
Light the fuse on the dynamite...
I'm trouble

And oh oh oh
It's the only way I know oh oh
My daddy taught me so oh oh
When he said to me
"Don't look back
When you walk away..."
I'm the best mistake you'll ever make

Oh woah oh
I'm trouble
I'm trouble
Oh woah oh
I'm trouble
I'm trouble
You might also like
Learn your lines, get your story straight
Broken bottles gonna seal your fate
Happiness is just a glass away
I'm trouble
Breath me in, like the summer nights
It's only a mistake if we don't survive
Kids grown up, but we're not alright
We're trouble

And oh oh oh
It's the only way I know oh oh
My daddy taught me so oh oh
When he said to me
"Don't look back
When you walk away..."
I'm the best mistake you'll ever make

Uh oh, trouble
I'm not subtle
Wanna be your 
I hate to burst your bubble
But I see a moose knuckle
Loosen that buckle
Forward space, Hubble
Show me how you suckle
Do you have a double
Better yet, a quintuple
You feel suple
Let's get stoned, Barney Rubble
Oh woah oh
I'm trouble
I'm trouble
Oh woah oh
I'm trouble
I'm trouble

One, two, for your bad tattoos and
Three, four, sneaking in through my window
Boy we grew up bad
But we never had nothing but each other
Save your innocence for the next life
Never let them make you think twice
When the wreckage flies
Cause this life don't last forever babe...

And oh oh oh
It's the only way I know oh oh
My daddy taught me so oh oh
When he said to me
"Don't look back
When you walk away..."
I'm the best mistake you'll ever make
Oh woah oh
I'm trouble
I'm trouble
Oh woah oh
I'm trouble
