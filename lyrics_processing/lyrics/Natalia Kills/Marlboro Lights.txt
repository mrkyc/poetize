Say you don't love me
Say you don't want me anymore
Tell me it's over, "It's over"
I'll open my bottle
No, I ain't opening this door
Bath water gets colder
So just say it's over

'Cause my pocket's broke, my soul is stone
I ruined you again
And a lonely bridge, a roof top ledge
Could just fix everything

But when I'm alone on the longest nights
I think of you and your Marlboro Lights and I
I get a bit better
And I lay here on the bedroom floor
Where your feet walked out and your daggers fall and I
I get a little bit better

Say you'll forget me
Say you'll erase me from your mind
Right from the day of our doomed beauty
I saw my future in your eyes
Save the words you rehearsed
We both know I won't be fine
You know that fate don't take my bribes
And I only want what's never mine
You might also like
So you break the door, you break my heart
You ruined me again
And the passing truck, and loaded guns
Never could fix anything

But when I'm alone on the longest nights
I think of you and your Marlboro Lights and I
I get a bit better
And I lay here on the bedroom floor
Where your feet walked out and your daggers fall and I...
I get a little bit better

When love is made so renegade
You know you're going down in flames
And if our hearts must share a grave
At least can't we be friends?
You shoots your words, they knock me down
Like rubber bullets raining out
They bounce right off and I get up again

But if no one understands me
At least you could pretend
I never knew when love was true
But I know it's the end
But I'll be here 'til chaos calls
And God ain't listening anymore, 'cause I
I know that we could be better
I'll stay here to defy our fears
Even though I know it'll end in tears, 'cause I
I know that we could be better
When I'm alone on the longest nights
I think of you and your Marlboro Lights and I
