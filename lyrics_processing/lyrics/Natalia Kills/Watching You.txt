I'm standing outside on your momma's lawn
And it's 5a.m.m got your curtains drawn
Been 25 times that I called, but I know that you love me
Now I'm all dressed up and I know that you're here
Boy, it's just a little rain, no, these ain't no tears
Every moment passed is a thousand years since you loved me

And out of all the stupid boys I knew
I had to fall for you
And out of all the pretty lies you told
Can't one of them be true?

When you wake up, I'll still believe you're mine
Oh, whoa, I'm watching you
Sleep all night with a stranger on my side
Oh, whoa, I'm watching you
No, no, no, this was not the plan
If I can't have you, then no one can
When you wake up, I'll still be here outside
Oh, whoa, I'm watching you

Happy Hour ain't so happy when you got no friends
And who knew I'd find an angel at the gates of Hell?
Your glass was always empty but your bed was full
When you loved me
You gave me back my key, but you still have my heart
Are all the dreams of you and me in broken frames in your garbage?
The other guys with their honest eyes
Just can't love me
You might also like
And out of all the stupid boys I knew
I had to fall for you
And out of all the pretty lies you told
Can't one of them be true?

When you wake up, I'll still believe you're mine
Oh, whoa, I'm watching you
Sleep all night with a stranger on my side
Oh, whoa, I'm watching you
No, no, no, this was not the plan
If I can't have you, then no one can
When you wake up, I'll still be here outside
Oh, whoa, I'm watching you

Loving you is like a chainsaw to my heart
But we're more beautiful with every single scar
The words you promised
Laying in the backseat in your car
But like a bad, bad dream, you leave me in the dark

When you wake up, I'll still believe you're mine
Oh, whoa, I'm watching you
Sleep all night with a stranger on my side
Oh, whoa, I'm watching you
No, no, no, this was not the plan
If I can't have you, then no one can
When you wake up, I'll still be here outside
