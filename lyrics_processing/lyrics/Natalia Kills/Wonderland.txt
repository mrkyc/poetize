I'm not Snow White, but I'm lost inside this forest
I'm not Red Riding Hood, but I think the wolves have got me
Don't watch the stilettos
I'm not, not Cinderella
I don't need a knight, so baby, take off all your armor
You be the Beast, and I'll be the Beauty, Beauty
Who needs true love as long as you love me truly?
I want it all, but I want you more
Will you wake me up, boy, if I bite your poison apple?

I don't believe in fairytales (No, no, no)
I don't believe in fairytales (No, no, no)
I don't believe in fairytales
But I believe in you and me

Take me to Wonderland
Take me to, take me to, take me to Wonderland
Take me to, take me to, take me to Wonderland
Take me to, take me to, take me to Wonderland
Wonderland, Wonderland

When I lay my head down to go to sleep at night
My dreams consist of things that'll make you wanna hide
Don't lock me in your tower
Show me your magic powers
I'm not afraid to face a little bit of danger, danger
I want the love, the money, and the perfect ending
You want the same as I, I, so stop pretending
I wanna show you how good we could be together
I wanna love you through the night, we'll be a sweet disaster

I don't believe in fairytales (No, no, no)
I don't believe in fairytales (No, no, no)
I don't believe in fairytales
But I believe in you and me

Take me to Wonderland
Take me to, take me to, take me to Wonderland
Take me to, take me to, take me to Wonderland
Take me to, take me to, take me to Wonderland
Wonderland, Wonderland

Wonderland, woah-oh-oh
Ho-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh
I believe in you and me

I don't believe in fairytales (No, no, no)
I don't believe in fairytales (No, no, no)
I don't believe in fairytales
But I believe in you and me

Take me to Wonderland
Take me to, take me to, take me to Wonderland
Take me to, take me to, take me to Wonderland
Take me to, take me to, take me to
I believe in you and me, Wonderland
Take me to, take me to, take me to Wonderland
Take me to, take me to, take me to Wonderland
Take me to, take me to, take me to Wonderland
