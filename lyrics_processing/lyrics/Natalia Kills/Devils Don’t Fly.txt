I heard the angels call again
I threw myself a party
Chardonnay and oxy
I stopped the screams inside my head
I remember when you had me
Floating high like Sid and Nancy

They say it's not the answer but I can't carry on
Cause I got nowhere, no one, without you boy I'm done
And when I'm gone, remember you're the one
And just because I fight don't mean that I never learned how to love

You know devils don't fly (fly, fly)
So don't expect me not to fall
Devils don't fly (fly, fly)
But God we almost had it all
But I got chains and you got wings
You know that life ain't fair sometimes
Devils don't fly (fly, fly)
But I try

What's a girl to do when she's not strong?
When everyone that holds my hand
Gets cut from all the thorns?
I used to put my ear against the wall
To hear the screams, to hear the fall
More reasons to escape it all
You might also like
And it's not the answer but I can't carry on
I give my best smile, my last dime
But I always get it wrong
It's not cause I'm young or from a broken home
Maybe I just fight cause I don't know where I belong

You know devils don't fly (fly, fly)
So don't expect me not to fall
Devils don't fly (fly, fly)
But God we almost had it all
But I got chains and you got wings
You know that life ain't fair sometimes
Devils don't fly (fly, fly)
But I try

Angels were never meant to fall
And you were the loveliest of all
If I thought God could fix it
I'd pray for your forgiveness
But I've been cast down, thrown out
When I crossed to the other side
No devils don't fly
You know devils don't fly (fly, fly)
So don't expect me not to fall
Devils don't fly (fly, fly)
But God we almost had it all
But I got chains and you got wings
You know that life ain't fair sometimes
Devils don't fly (fly, fly)
But I try
