I'm about to break you

This is not a love song
Honey, if you want one, better turn it off
Everything was working
Honey, when we kissed and never spoke at all
Slamming doors and breaking plates
Something else I'd rather break
Johnny boy, it's time to take it like a man

Kiss the boys and make 'em cry
Make 'em cry, make 'em cry
Don't need your heart, 'cause I've got mine
I got mine, I got mine

Take my love before I go
'Cause you should know I'm about to break you hard
Take my love before I go
'Cause you should know I'm about to break you hard
Break you hard, break you hard
I'm about to break you hard
Break you hard, break you hard
I'm about to break you
You might also like
Boom boom smash, boom boom crash
Boom boom smash, boom boom crash

Drama, drama, call your momma
Take the caddy keys and go
Feels like we are stuck here in a badly written TV show
Slamming doors and breaking plates
Something else I'd rather break
Johnny boy, it's time to take it like a man

Kiss the boys and make 'em cry
Make 'em cry, make 'em cry
Don't need your heart cause I've got mine
I got mine, I got mine

Take my love before I go
'Cause you should know I'm about to break you hard
Take my love before I go
'Cause you should know I'm about to break you hard
Break you hard, break you hard
I'm about to break you hard
Break you hard, break you hard
I'm about to break you
Lipstick, lies, tears, tragedy
Lipstick, lies, tears, tragedy
Lipstick, lies, tears, tragedy
(Shh, darling hold still)
Lipstick, lies, tears, tragedy
Lipstick, lies, tears, tragedy
(It'll only hurt for a moment)
Lipstick, lies, tears, tragedy
(And before you can open your eyes)
Lipstick, lies, tears, tragedy
(I'ma break you hard)
Lipstick, lies, tears, tragedy
(I'll be gone)

Take my love before I go
'Cause you should know I'm about to break you hard
Take my love before I go
'Cause you should know I'm about to break you hard
Break you hard, break you hard
I'm about to break you hard
Break you hard, break you hard
