Oh, the whippoorwill roosts on the telephone pole
And the Georgia sun goes down
Well, it's been a long, long time but I'm glad that I'm
Goin' back to my home town
Goin' down to the Greyhound station
Gonna buy me a one-way fare
And if the good Lord's willin' and the creeks don't rise
By tomorrow, ah, I'm gonna be there
Don't it make you want to go home?
Don't it make you want to go home?
All God's children get weary when they roam
Don't it make you want to go home?
There's a six-lane highway down by the creek
Where I went skinny-dippin' as a child
And a drive-in show where the meadows used to grow
And the strawberries used to grow wild
You might also likeThere's a drag strip down by the riverside
Where my grandma's cow used to graze
Now the grass don't grow and the river don't flow
Like it did in my childhood days
(Don't it make you wanna go home?)
(Don't it make you wanna go home?)
All God's children get weary when they roam
(Don't it make you) wanna, wanna go home?
Background singers sing "It's different, it's different, it's different, so
Different now " while Brook scats with variations on "Don't it make you wanna go home? "
And then "But all God's children get weary when they roam, and don't it make you wanna go
Home? "
"Don't it make you wanna to go home don't it make you
Wanna go home And now-ah, don't it make you wanna go home, don't it make you
Wanna go home? "
All of God's children get weary when they roam
(Don't it make you) spoken: "And" (want to go home?)
Spoken: I'm goin' home
Whistling plus a series of (Don't it make you want to go home?) to end
