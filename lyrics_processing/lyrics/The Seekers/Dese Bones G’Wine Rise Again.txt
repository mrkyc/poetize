Dese bones are gonna rise again
Made them out of mud and a little bit of sand
Dese bones are gonna rise again
Lord I knew it didn't I know it?
Dese bones are gonna rise again
Lord I knew it didn't I know it?
Dese bones are gonna rise again
The Lord He thought he'd make a woman too
Dese bones are gonna rise again
But He didn't know exactly what to do
Dese bones are gonna rise again
So He took a rib from Adam's side
Dese bones are gonna rise again
And He made Miss Eve for to be his bride
Dese bones are gonna rise again
Lord I knew it didn't I know it?
Dese bones are gonna rise again
Lord I knew it didn't I know it?
Dese bones are gonna rise again
Put 'em in the garden fine and fair
Dese bones are gonna rise again
He said You eat whatever is there
Dese bones are gonna rise again
You might also likeBut there's one tree you must not touch
Dese bones are gonna rise again
'Cause I want them apples for my lunch
Dese bones are gonna rise again
Lord I knew it didn't I know it?
Dese bones are gonna rise again
Lord I knew it didn't I know it?
Dese bones are gonna rise again
Eve she took a little pull
Dese bones are gonna rise again
And then she filled her apron full
Dese bones are gonna rise again
And Adam took a little slice
Dese bones are gonna rise again
He smacked his lips and said It's nice
Dese bones are gonna rise again
Lord I knew it didn't I know it?
Dese bones are gonna rise again
Lord I knew it didn't I know it?
Dese bones are gonna rise again
The Lord He came a-snoopin' round
Dese bones are gonna rise again
And He saw the apple core on the ground
Dese bones are gonna rise again
And the Lord He spoke in a monstrous voice
Dese bones are gonna rise again
And He shook this world to its very joints
Dese bones are gonna rise again
Oh Adam Adam where art thou?
Dese bones are gonna rise again
O'er here Massa Lord I'se comin' now
Dese bones are gonna rise again
Lord I knew it didn't I know it?
Dese bones are gonna rise again
Lord I knew it didn't I know it?
Dese bones are gonna rise again
Well stole my apples I believe
Dese bones are gonna rise again
Oh no Massa Lord I 'spect was Eve
Dese bones are gonna rise again
Well out of this garden you must get
Dese bones are gonna rise again
When you're livin' by your sweat
Dese bones are gonna rise again
And He put an Angel at the door
Dese bones are gonna rise again
And He said You never come back no more
Dese bones are gonna rise again
Well all this song there ain't no more
Dese bones are gonna rise again
Oh Eve ate the apple and Adam ate the core
Dese bones are gonna rise again
Lord I knew it didn't I know it?
Dese bones are gonna rise again
Lord I knew it didn't I know it?
Dese bones are gonna rise
Lord I knew it didn't I know it?
Dese bones are gonna rise again
Lord I knew it didn't I know it?
