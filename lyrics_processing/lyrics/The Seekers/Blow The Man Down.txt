To me weigh hey blow the man down
And pray pay attention and listen to me
Give me some time to blow the man down
I'm a deep water sailor just in from Hong Kong
To me weigh hey blow the man down
If you'll give me some rum I'll sing you a song
Give me some time to blow the man down
T'was on a Black Baller I first spent my time
To me weigh hey blow the man down
And on that Black Baller I wasted my prime
Give me some time to blow the man down
T'is when a Black Baller's preparing for sea
To me weigh hey blow the man down
You'd split your sides laughing at the sights that you see
Give me some time to blow the man down
With the tinkers and tailors and soldiers and all
To me weigh hey blow the man down
That ship for prime seamen onboard a Black Ball
Give me some time to blow the man down
T'is when a Black Baller is clear of the land
To me weigh hey blow the man down
Our boatswain then gives us the word of command
Give me some time to blow the man down
You might also likeLay aft is the cry to the break of the poop
To me weigh hey blow the man down
Or I'll help you along with the toe of my boot
Give me some time to blow the man down
T'is larboard and starboard on the deck you will sprawl
To me weigh hey blow the man down
For Kicking Jack Williams commands the Black Ball
Give me some time to blow the man down
Aye first it's a fist and then it's a pall
To me weigh hey blow the man down
When you ship as a sailor aboard the Black Ball
Give me some time to blow the man down
Blow the man down blow the man down
