As I went a-walkin' on Kilgarra Mountain
I spied Colonel Pepper, and his money he was countin'
I rattled out my pistols, and I drew forth my saber
Cryin', "Stand and deliver for I am a bold deceiver"

Musha ringum durn da
Whack fol the daddy o
Whack fol the daddy o
There's whisky in the jar

The gold and silver coins, they looked so bright and shiny
Oh, I took them home straightway, and I gave 'em to my Molly
She vowed, and she promised that she never would deceive me
But the devil's in the women, oh, you never can believe 'em

Musha ringum durn da
Whack fol the daddy o
Whack fol the daddy o
There's whisky in the jar

But when I awoke between six and seven
The guards were all around me in numbers odd and even
I reached for my pistols, but alas, I was mistaken
My pistols had been fired, and a prisoner I was taken

Whack fol the daddy o
Whack fol the daddy o
There's whisky in the jar

They put me in the jail without judge or writin'
For robbin' Colonel Pepper, oh, on Kilgaray Mountain
But they didn't take my fists, so I knocked the sentry down
And bade farewell to the jail in Sligo town

Musha ringum durn da, whoa
Whack fol the daddy o
Whack fol the daddy o
There's whisky in the jar

Some people take delight in fishin' and in bowlin'
Oh, others take delight in their carriages a-rollin'
But I take delight in the juice of the barley
And courtin' pretty girls 'til the mornin' so early

Musha ringum durn da, whoa
Whack fol the daddy o
Whack fol the daddy o
There's whisky in the jar
Musha ringum durn da, hey
Whack fol the daddy o
Whack fol the daddy o
