I know that's just the way it goes
And you ain't right, for sure
You turned your back on love
For the last time

It won't take much longer now
Time makes me stronger
Well, there's nothing more to say

One day in your life
Said love will remind you
How could you leave it all behind?
One day in your life it's gonna find you
With the tears you let me cry
And baby, I'm stronger than before
You've gotta lay it on the line
Maybe one day in your life

My love, did you think I'd break down and cry?
This thing we had, it meant the world to me
Guess I was blind

You call me in the midnight hour
With your velvet lines
So many sleepless nights
I wonder, is it time to say goodbye?

One day in your life
Said love will remind you
Baby, how could you leave it all behind? (Could you leave it all behind?)
One day in your life it's gonna find you

Said love will remind you, yeah, yeah, yeah
How could you leave it all behind? (How could you leave it all behind?)
Oh, oh, oh, yeah
