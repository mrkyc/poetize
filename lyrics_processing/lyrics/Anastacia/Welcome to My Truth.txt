Sentimental days in a misty clouded haze
Of a memory that now feels untrue
I used to feel disguised
Now I leave the mask behind
Paintin' pictures that aren't so blue

The pages I've turned are the lessons I've learned

Somebody bring up the lights, I want you to see (Don't you feel sorry for me)
My life turned around, but I'm still livin' my dreams (Yes, it's true that I've been)
Through it all, I've hit about a million walls
Welcome to my truth, I still love
Welcome to my truth, I still love

Tangled in a web with a pain hard to forget
That was a time that I've now put to rest

Oh, the pages I've turned are the lessons I've learned

Somebody bring up the lights, I want you to see (Don't you feel sorry for me)
My life turned around, but I'm still livin' my dreams (Yes, it's true that I've been)
Through it all, I've hit about a million walls
Welcome to my truth, I still love
Welcome to my truth, I still love

Sentimental days in a misty clouded haze
Of a memory that now feels untrue

So somebody bring up the lights, I want you to see (Don't you feel sorry for me)
Oh, my life turned around, but I'm still livin' my dreams (Yes, it's true that I've been)
Through it all, I've hit about a million walls
Welcome to my truth, I still love
Oh, somebody bring up the lights, I want you to see (Don't you feel sorry for me)
