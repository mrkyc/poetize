You're like spring turned into winter
With you there's no in-between
Some things won't be meant to last
Too much of a good thing...
Peaceful I stepped into your water
Swam until I almost drowned
Now I'm down to one more breath
Hmm, I'm too deep to get out
Love so unkind
Once the sun light hits your eyes
I used to think that

You could be the one, be the one
But loving you is just like staring at the sun, at the sun
If you look too long it'll leave you blind
Baby, so cry just a little, cry just a little for me
Hate to say we're done, say we're done
But loving you is just like staring at the sun, at the sun
And that's why I'm leaving you behind
Baby, so cry just a little, cry just a little for me

Faded pictures
Painted like a photograph from yesterday
How could time change us so fast?
Hmm, a memory now past
Love so unkind
Once the sun light hits your eyes
I used to think that

You could be the one, be the one
But loving you is just like staring at the sun, at the sun
If you look too long it'll leave you blind
Baby, so cry just a little, cry just a little for me
Hate to say we're done, say we're done
But loving you is just like staring at the sun, at the sun
And that's why I'm leaving you behind
Baby, so cry just a little, cry just a little for me

Nightmare dreamer, weary lover
Used to crave it, now please change it
Only pain heals this condition now
I used to think that

You could be the one, be the one
But loving you is just like staring at the sun, at the sun
If you look too long it'll leave you blind
Baby, so cry just a little, cry just a little for me
Hate to say we're done, say we're done
But loving you is just like staring at the sun, at the sun
And that's why I'm leaving you behind
Baby, so cry just a little, cry just a little for me
Oh, a little for me
