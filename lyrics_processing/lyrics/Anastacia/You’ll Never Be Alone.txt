The world is changing
And time is spinning fast
It's so amazing how you came into my life
I know it seems all hope is gone
I know you feel you can't be strong
And once again the story ends with you and I

And anytime you feel like you just can't go on
Just hold on to my love
And you'll never be alone

Hold on, we can make it through the fire
And my love, I'm forever by your side
And you know, if you should ever call my name
I'll be right there, you'll never be alone

Hopeless to describe
The way I feel for you
No matter how I try
Words would never do
I looked into your eyes to find
As long as love is alive
There ain't nothing we can't make it through

Don't worry, make a wish

Hold on, we can make it through the fire
And my love, I'm forever by your side
And you know, if you should ever call my name
I'll be right there, you'll never be alone

I will be there for you, so don't you worry
