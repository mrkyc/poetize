I am not afraid to let go
Of what I have become
And everything that I knew before
Is setting with the sun
And now it's not that hard to say goodbye
And now I know that it's okay to cry
If you're my melody, I'll harmonize
The songs we never sung, oh

I never thought in a million years
That I could watch while I disappear
All of a sudden I see it clear
What to do

I'm gonna take this chance and do something I never tried
I'm gonna make this moment matter 'til the end of time
And I made mistakes through all my life
And on the same place every time
I'm gonna take this chance and do something I never tried

Now it's time to face the unknown
My arms are open wide
It took a lot of hard rain to grow
This kind of strength inside
So open up the cage and set me free
I'm becoming who I'm meant to be
Taller than the tallest of the trees
All will be alright

I'm tired of trying to take control
Finally wanting and letting go
All of a sudden I see it clear
What to do

I'm gonna take this chance and do something I never tried
I'm gonna make this moment matter 'til the end of time
And I made mistakes through all my life
And on the same place everytime
I'm gonna take this chance and do something I never tried

(I feel the sun on my skin) I feel the sun on my skin
(I'm gonna let life in) I'm gonna let life in
(I wanna trust who I am) Who I am

I'm gonna take this chance and do something I never tried
I'm gonna make this moment matter 'til the end of time
And I made mistakes through all my life
And on the same place everytime
I better take this chance and do something I never tried

What to do?
Something I never tried
What to do?
Something I never tried
And I made mistakes through all my life
And on the same place everytime
I better take this chance and do something I never tried
What to do?
Something I never tried
What to do?
