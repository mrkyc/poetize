Some day I'll find my love
Some day some day
I say some day my prince will come
Some day some day
Some day my prince will come
Some day I'll find my love
And how thrilling that moment will be
When the prince of my dreams comes to me
He'll whisper "I love you"
And steal a kiss or two
Though he's far away
I'll find my love some day
Some day when my dreams come true, come true
Some day
Some day my prince will come
Some day some day
Some day I'll find my love
Someone to call my own
And I'll know him the moment we meet, moment we meet
For my heart will be skipping a beat
