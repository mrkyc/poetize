My love is on the line, my love is on the line
My love is on the line, my love is on the line
(Dil Laa liya be-parwa de naal)
My love is on the line
(Dil Laa liya be-parwa de naal)
My love is on the line

A little late for all the things you didn't say
I'm not sad for you
But I'm sad for all the time I had to waste
'Cause I learned the truth

Your heart is in a place I no longer wanna be
I knew there'd come a day I'd set you free
'Cause I'm sick and tired of always being sick and tired
(Dil Laa liya be-parwa de naal)
(Dil Laa liya be-parwa de naal)

Your love isn't fair
You live in a world where you didn't listen
And you didn't care
So I'm floating, I'm floating on air

No warning of such a sad song
Of broken hearts
My dreams of fairytales and fantasies, o
Were torn apart, oh-ooh

I lost my peace of mind somewhere along the way
I knew there come a time you'd hear me say
I'm sick and tired of always being sick and tired
(Dil Laa liya be-parwa de naal)

Your love isn't fair
You live in a world where you didn't listen

Your love isn't fair (I said)
You live in a world where you didn't listen
And you didn't care (Care)
So I'm floating, I'm floating on air (On air, oh, I'm, I'm on air)
Your love isn't fair (Oh)
You live in a world where you didn't listen
And you didn't care
