My love is on the line
Dil laa liya be-parwa de naal
My love is on the line
My love is on the line
Left broken empty in despair
Wanna breathe can't find air
Thought you were sent from up above
But you and me never had love
So much more I have to say
Help me find a way
And I wonder if you know
How it really feels
To be left outside alone
When it's cold out here
Well maybe you should know
Just how it feels
To be left outside alone
To be left outside alone
I'll tell you
All my life I've been waiting
For you to bring a fairy tale my way
Believing in a fantasy without meaning
It's not okay I don't feel safe
I need to pray

My love is on the line
My love is on the line
My love is on the line
A little late for all the things you didn't say
I'm not sad for you
But I'm sad for all the time I had to waste
Cause I learned the truth
Your heart is in a place I no longer wanna be
I knew there'd come a day I'd set you free
Cause I'm sick and tired
Of always being sick and tired
Your love isn't fair
You live in a world where you didn't listen
And you didn't care
So I'm floating
Floating on air
Dil laa liya be-
Dil laa liya be-
Dil laa liya be-parwa de naal

My love is on the line
Me now I paid my dues
Me now I paid my dues
Now I'm still tested every day
And people try to mess with Anastacia
I'm no let you know I don't give a damn about who's around
Til now
So I...
Knew I
Well I made I
That's just the way
Yeah
That's just the way
I paid my dues
I paid my dues
I'm not that kind
I said I'll love you 'til the 12th of never
But I won't run far ahead
Leaving you behind
You know I'm not that kind... Now what I say to you
I would say to no other
I've got my friends
I won't look for another in you
So what you gonna do?
Cause I'm not that kind of girl
And it's not my kind of world
No it's not for me
Not where I wanna be
Help me out
Tell me what you're thinking
If I rush, slow me down
You can take your time
You know I'm not that kind... If you leave
I believe life will go on
The wind will blow
Water flow
And the sun will shine (yeah it will)
You know I'm not that kind..Cause I'm not that kind of girl
And it's not my kind of world
No it's not for me
Not where I wanna be
How could you leave it all behind one day in your life
With the tears that left me cry one day in your live
Said love would remind you
How could you leave it all behind
One day in your life
It's gonna find you
With the tears that left me cry
And baby I'm stronger then before
You gotta play it on the line
Maybe one day in your life
One day in your life how could you leave it alone day in your life
How could you leave it all
With the tears that left me cry you called me in the midnight hour
With your ... lights
So many sleepless nights, I wonder
Just show me the may
Now baby come on
Don't claim that love you never let me feel
I should've known
Cause you've brought nothing real
Come on be a man about it
You won't die
I ain't got no more tears to cry
And I can't take this no more
You know I gotta let it go
And you know I'm outta love
Set me free
And let me out this misery
Just show me the way
To get my life again
Cause you can't handle me
I'm outta love
Can't you see
Baby that you've gotta set me free
I'm outta
Let me get over you
The way you've gotten over me too, yeah
Seems like my time has come
And now I'm moving on
