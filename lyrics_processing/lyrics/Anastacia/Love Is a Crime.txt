If love is a crime, baby
I'd do my time whether
It's wrong or right
You can sentence me to life
If love is a crime, baby
I'd do my time whether
It's wrong or right
You can sentence me
Sentence me to life

Some might say I'm guilty of love in the first degree
If the jury wants to lock me up and throw away the key
There's no greater punishment than what I face inside
Won't tamper with the evidence 'cause there's nothing to hide

What's inside my heart
I'm admitting to (I'm admitting to)
You wouldn't have a clue
Unless you felt it too

Better tell the truth, just let me plead my case
The thief who stole my heart from me I couldn't let escape
He's my only alibi, but I won't drop a dime
So how can I give up to you my partner in crime?

What's inside my heart (My heart)
I'm admitting to (Oh yeah, yeah)
You wouldn't have a clue
Unless you felt it too

You can take away my freedom
But you can't take my love from me
I won't die a lonely prisoner
'Cause my heart will set me free, oh yeah
