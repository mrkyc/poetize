I've been standing where you left me
Praying that you'd come and get me
But now I've found my second wind
Now I've found my second skin
Well I know what you were thinking
You thought you'd watch me fade away
When you broke me into pieces
But I gave each piece a name

One of me is wiser
One of me is stronger
One of me's a fighter
And there's a thousand faces of me
And we're gonna rise up
Yeah we're gonna rise up
For every time you wronged me
Well you're gonna face an army
An army of me

Welcome to the revolution
All your walls are breaking down
It's time you had a taste of losing
Time the tables turned around
I see a glimpse of recognition
But it's too little it's too late
And what you thought was your best decision
Just became your worst mistake

So how does it feel
To know that I beat you
I can defeat you
How does it feel
Because it sure feels sweeter
It sure feels sweeter to me

Now that I'm wiser
Now that I'm stronger
Now that I'm a fighter
And there's a thousand faces of me
I'm gonna rise up
Yeah I'm gonna rise up
For every time you wronged me
Now you're going to face an army

An army of me (rise up)
An army of me (rise up)
For every time you wronged me
Now you're going to face an army
