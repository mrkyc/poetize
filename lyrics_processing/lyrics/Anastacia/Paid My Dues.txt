You can say what you want about me
Try to do what you want to me
But you cannot stop me

I've been knocked down, it's a crazy town
Even got punched in the face in L.A
Ain't nothing in the world
That you keep me from doing what I wanna do
'Cause I'm too proud, I'm too strong
Live by the code that you gotta move on
Feeling sorry for yourself ain't got nobody nowhere so I...

Held my head high
(I knew) knew I'd survive
(Well, I made it) I made it
(Don't hate it) Don't hate it
That's just the way it goes

I done made it through
Stand on my own too
I paid my dues, yeah
Tried to hold me down
You can't stop me now
I paid my dues

So, like I told you
You cannot stop me
I paid my dues

Now I'm still tested every day
And people try to mess with Anastacia
Got another thing coming, 'cause I handle mine
And I thought I better let you know
I'm no punk I can get down
I don't give a damn about who's around
That worked just fine 'til now so I...

Held my head high
(I knew) knew I'd survive
(Well, I made it) I made it
(Don't hate it) Don't hate it
That's just the way it goes

I done made it through
Stand on my own too
I paid my dues
Tried to hold me down
You can't stop me now
I paid my dues, yeah
Took so long to get me here
But I won't live in fear
Are you trying to steal my shine?
But first they want to build you up
Then they tear you down
It's a struggle, you try to bubble so I...

Held my head high
(I knew) knew I'd survive
(Well, I made it) I made it
(Don't hate it) Don't hate it
That's just the way it goes

I done made it through
Stand on my own too
I paid my dues
Tried to hold me down
You can't stop me now
I paid my dues, yeah
I done made it through
Stand on my own too
I paid my dues
Tried to hold me down
You can't stop me now
