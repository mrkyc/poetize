I saw a great big wooden box a-floatin' in the bay
I pulled it in and opened it up and much to my surprise
Ooh, I discovered a (*boom-boom-boom*) right before my eyes
Ooh, I discovered a (*boom-boom-boom*) right before my eyes
I picked it up and ran to town as happy as a king
I took it to a guy I knew who'd buy most any thing
But this is what he hollered at me as I walked in his shop
Ooh, get outta here with that (*boom-boom-boom*) before I call a cop
Ooh, get outta here with that (*boom-boom-boom*) before I call a cop
I turned around and got right out, a-runnin' for my life
And than I took it home with me to give it to my wife
But this is what she hollered at me as I walked in the door
Oh, get outta here with that (*boom-boom-boom*) and don't come back no more
Oh, get outta here with that (*boom-boom-boom*) and don't come back no more
I wandered all around the town until I chanced to meet
A hobo who was looking for a handout on the street
He said he'd take most any old thing, he was a desperate man
But when I showed him the (*boom-boom-boom*), he turned around and ran
Oh, when I showed him the (*boom-boom-boom*), he turned around and ran
I wandered on for many years, a victim of my fate
Until one day I came upon St. Peter at the gate
And when I tried to take it inside, he told me where to go
Get outta here with that (*boom-boom-boom*) and take it down below
Oh, get outta here with that (*boom-boom-boom*) and take it down below

And you should see a great big box and it's within your reach
Don't ever stop and open it up, that's my advice to you
'Cause you'll never get rid of the (*boom-boom-boom*), no matter what you do
Oh, you'll never get rid of the (*boom-boom-boom*), no matter what you do
