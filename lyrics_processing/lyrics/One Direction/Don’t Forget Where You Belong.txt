Been a lot of places, I've been all around the world
Seen a lot of faces, never knowing where I was
On the horizon, hmm, but I know, I know, I know, I know
The sun will be rising back home
Living out of cases, and packing up and taking off
Made a lot of changes, but not forgetting who I was
On the horizon, ooh, well, I know, I know, I know, I know
The moon will be rising back home

Don't forget where you belong, home
Don't forget where you belong, home
If you ever feel alone, don't
You were never on your own
And the proof is in this song

I've been away for ages, but I got everything I need
I'm flicking through the pages I've written in my memory
I feel like I'm dreaming, oh, so I know, I know, I know, I know
That I'm never leaving, no, I won't go

Don't forget where you belong, home
Don't forget where you belong, home
If you ever feel alone, don't
You were never on your own
And the proof is in this song
You might also like
Lights off when they should be on
Even stars in the skies, they're wrong
Short days, when the nights are long
When I think of the things I've done
Don't matter how far I've gone
I'm always free to run home

Don't forget where you belong, home
Don't forget where you belong (Don't forget it), home
If you ever feel alone, don't
You were never on your own
Never, never, never, home

Don't forget where you belong, home
Don't forget where you belong (Don't forget it), home
If you ever feel alone, don't (Yeah)
You were never on your own (You were never)
And the proof is in this song

Home
Don't forget it
Home
If you ever feel alone, don't
You were never on your own (You were never)
And the proof is in this song
Never forget it, this song (Don't forget it)
