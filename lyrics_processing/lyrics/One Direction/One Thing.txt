I've tried playin' it cool
But when I'm lookin' at you
I can't ever be brave
'Cause you make my heart race
Shot me out of the sky
You're my kryptonite
You keep makin' me weak
Yeah, frozen and can't breathe

Something's gotta give now
'Cause I'm dyin' just to make you see
That I need you here with me now
'Cause you've got that one thing

So get out, get out, get out of my head
And fall into my arms instead
I don't, I don't, don't know what it is
But I need that one thing
And you've got that one thing

Now I'm climbing the walls
But you don't notice at all
That I'm goin' out of my mind
All day and all night
You might also like
Something's gotta give now
'Cause I'm dyin' just to know your name
And I need you here with me now
'Cause you've got that one thing

So get out, get out, get out of my head
And fall into my arms instead
I don't, I don't, don't know what it is
But I need that one thing
So get out, get out, get out of my mind
And come on, come into my life
I don't, I don't, don't know what it is
But I need that one thing
And you've got that one thing

(Woah, woah, woah)
You've got that one thing

Get out, get out, get out of my head
And fall into my arms instead

So get out, get out, get out of my head (Get out, get out, get out of my head, yeah)
And fall into my arms instead (Instead)
I don't, I don't, don't know what it is
But I need that one thing (I need that one thing)
So get out, get out, get out of my mind (Out of my mind)
And come on, come into my life
I don't, I don't, don't know what it is
But I need that one thing
