I told her that I loved her, was not sure if she heard
The roof was pretty windy and she didn't say a word
Party dying downstairs, had nothing left to do
Just me, her and the moon

I said, "You're on fire, babe"
Then down came the lightning on me
Love can be frightening for sure

All I know at the end of the day
Is you want what you want and you say what you say
And you follow your heart even though it'll break sometimes
All I know at the end of the day
Is you love who you love, there ain't no other way
If there's something I've learned from a million mistakes
You're the one that I want at the end of the day

(Oh, oh)
At the end of the day
(Oh, I, I, I)
You're the one that I want at the end of the day
You might also like
She said the night was over, I said it's forever
Twenty minutes later, wound up in the hospital
The priest thinks it's the devil, my mum thinks it's the flu
But, girl, it's only you

I said, "You're on fire, babe"
Then down came the lightning on me
Love can be frightening for sure

All I know at the end of the day
Is you want what you want and you say what you say
And you follow your heart even though it'll break sometimes
All I know at the end of the day (All I know)
Is you love who you love, there ain't no other way
If there's something I've learned from a million mistakes
You're the one that I want at the end of the day (At the end of the day)

When the sun goes down
I know that you and me and everything will be alright
And when the city's sleeping
You and I can stay awake, can keep on dreaming
You and I can stay awake, can keep on dreaming
All I know at the end of the day
Is you want what you want and you say what you say
And you follow your heart even though it'll break sometimes
All I know at the end of the day (All I know at the end of the day)
Is you love who you love, there ain't no other way
If there's something I've learned from a million mistakes
You're the one that I want at the end of the day (At the end of the day, yeah)

(Oh, oh)
At the end of the day
(Oh, I, I, I)
You're the one that I want at the end of the day (At the end of the day)
(Oh, oh)
(Oh, I, I, I)
