Forty-three
And then?
And then you've gotta play the opposite part which means you, you rest for four bars
Right, so we stop there?
Right

Remember the day we were giving up
When you told me I didn't give you enough
And all of your friends were saying I'd be leaving ya?
She's lyin' in bed with my t-shirt on
Just thinking how I went about it wrong
This isn't the stain of a red wine, I'm bleeding love

Please, believe me, don't you see the things you mean to me?
Oh, I love you, I love you, I love, I love, I love Olivia

I live for you, I long for you, Olivia (Ayy, ayy)
I've been idolizing the light in your eyes, Olivia (Ayy, ayy)
I live for you, I long for you, Olivia
Don't let me go, don't let me go

Say what you're feelin' and say it now
'Cause I got the feelin' you're walkin' out
And time is irrelevant when I've not been seeing ya
The consequences of falling out
Are something I'm having nightmares about
And these are the reasons I'm cryin' out to be with ya

Please, believe me, don't you see the things you mean to me?
Oh, I love you, I love you, I love, I love, I love Olivia

I live for you, I long for you, Olivia (Ayy, ayy)
I've been idolizing the light in your eyes, Olivia (Ayy, ayy)
I live for you, I long for you, Olivia
Don't let me go, (Don't) don't let me go (Go)

When you go and I'm alone
You live in my imagination
The summertime and butterflies
All belong to your creation
I love you, it's all I do, I love you

I live for you, I long for you, Olivia (Ayy, ayy)
I've been idolizing the light in your eyes, Olivia (Ayy, ayy)
I live for you, I long for you, Olivia
Don't let me go (Don't), don't let me go (Go)
Don't let me go, Olivia

No way
