I got a heart and I got a soul
Believe me, I will use them both
We made a start, be it a false one, I know
Baby, I don't want to feel alone

So kiss me where I lay down
My hands pressed to your cheeks
A long way from the playground

I have loved you since we were eighteen
Long before we both thought the same thing
To be loved and to be in love
All I can do is say that these arms were made for holdin' you, oh
I wanna love like you made me feel
When we were eighteen

We took a chance, God knows we've tried
Yet all along, I knew we'd be fine
So pour me a drink, oh, love
And let's split the night wide open
And we'll see everything we can
Living love in slow motion, motion, motion
You might also like
So kiss me where I lay down (Ooh-ooh)
My hands pressed to your cheeks (Ooh-ooh)
A long way from the playground (Ooh-ooh)

I have loved you since we were eighteen
Long before we both thought the same thing
To be loved and to be in love
And all I can do is say that these arms were made for holdin' you, oh
And I wanna love like you made me feel
When we were eighteen

When we were eighteen
Oh, lord
When we were eighteen

Kiss me where I lay down
My hands pressed to your cheeks
A long way from the playground

I have loved you since we were eighteen
Long before we both thought the same thing
To be loved and to be in love
And all I can do is say that these arms were made for holdin' you, oh
And I wanna love like you made me feel
When we were eighteen (Eighteen)

I wanna love like you made me feel
When we were eighteen (Eighteen, yeah)
I wanna love like you made me feel
