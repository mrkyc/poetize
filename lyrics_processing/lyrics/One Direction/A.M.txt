Won't you stay till the A.M.?
All my favourite conversations
Always made in the A.M
Yeah, yeah

Feels like this could be forever tonight
Break these clocks, forget about time
There could be a World War III goin' on outside
You and me were raised in the same part of town
Got these scars on the same ground
Remember how we used to kick around just wastin' time?

Won't you stay till the A.M.?
All my favourite conversations
Always made in the A.M
'Cause we don't know what we're sayin'
We're just swimmin' 'round in our glasses
And talkin' out of our asses
Like we're all gonna make it, yeah, yeah

Feels like this could be forever right now
Don't wanna sleep 'cause we're dreamin' out loud
Trying to behave, but you know that we never learnt how
You and me were raised in the same part of town
Got these scars on the same ground
Remember how we used to kick around just wasting time?
