Goin' out tonight, changes into something red
Her mother doesn't like that kind of dress
Everything she never had, she's showing off
Driving too fast, moon is breaking through her hair
She's heading for something that she won't forget
Having no regrets is all that she really wants

(Ooh) We're only getting older, baby
(Ooh) And I've been thinking about it lately
(Ooh) Does it ever drive you crazy
(Ah-ah-ah) Just how fast the night changes?
(Ooh) Everything that you've ever dreamed of
(Ooh) Disappearing when you wake up
(Ooh) But there's nothing to be afraid of
(Ah-ah-ah) Even when the night changes
(Ooh) It will never change me and you

Chasing her tonight, doubts are running 'round her head
He's waiting, hides behind a cigarette
Heart is beating loud and she doesn't want it to stop
Moving too fast, moon is lightin' up her skin
She's falling, doesn't even know it yet
Having no regrets is all that she really wants
You might also like
(Ooh) We're only getting older, baby
(Ooh) And I've been thinking about it lately
(Ooh) Does it ever drive you crazy
(Ah-ah-ah) Just how fast the night changes?
(Ooh) Everything that you've ever dreamed of
(Ooh) Disappearing when you wake up
(Ooh) But there's nothing to be afraid of
(Ah-ah-ah) Even when the night changes
(Ooh) It will never change me and you

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh

Goin' out tonight, changes into something red
Her mother doesn't like that kind of dress
Reminds her of the missing piece of innocence she lost

(Ooh) We're only getting older, baby
(Ooh) And I've been thinking about it lately
(Ooh) Does it ever drive you crazy
(Ah-ah-ah) Just how fast the night changes?
(Ooh) Everything that you've ever dreamed of
(Ooh) Disappearing when you wake up
(Ooh) But there's nothing to be afraid of
(Ah-ah-ah) Even when the night changes
(Ooh) It will never change, baby
(Ooh) It will never change, baby
