Hey angel
Do you know the reasons why
We look up to the sky?
Hey angel
Do you look at us and laugh
When we hold on to the past?
Hey angel

Oh, I wish I could be more like you (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Do you wish you could be more like me? (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Oh, I wish I could be more like you (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Do you wish you could be more like me? (Ooh, ooh, ooh)

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

Hey angel
Tell me, do you ever try
To come to the other side?
Hey angel
Tell me, do you ever cry
When we waste away our lives?

Yeah, I see you at the bar, at the edge of my bed
Backseat of my car, in the back of my head
I come alive when I hear your voice
It's a beautiful sound, it's a beautiful noise
I see you at the bar, at the edge of my bed
Backseat of my car, in the back of my head
I come alive when I hear your voice
It's a beautiful sound, it's a beautiful noise
