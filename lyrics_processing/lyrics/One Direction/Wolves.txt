I hear them calling for you
(Ooh, ooh) I hear them calling for you

I feel the waves getting started
It's a rush inside I can't control
Your eyes keep pulling me in
And I know, I know, I know
Your friends all talking 'bout me
They say I got no chance at all
But your fire is burning deep
In my soul, my soul, my soul

I ain't up for debating
Ain't in it for the taking
You got the whole world shaking

In the middle of the night when the wolves come out
Headed straight for your heart like a bullet in the dark
One by one, I try to take them down
We can run and hide, ain't going down without a fight
(Ooh) I hear them calling for you
(Ooh) I hear them callin'
In the middle of the night when the wolves come out
Headed straight for your heart, they come straight for your heart
You might also like
(Ooh, ooh) I hear them calling for you
(Ooh, ooh) I hear them calling for you

I keep on holding tight now
'Cause your body's telling me "Don't let go"
We're gonna be starting up trouble
I know, I know, I know
Just bringing my demons out
More than ever now
Your beauty could start a war
As you walk in the door

I ain't up for debating
Ain't in it for the taking
We got the whole world shaking

In the middle of the night when the wolves come out
Headed straight for your heart like a bullet in the dark
One by one, I try to take them down
We can run and hide, ain't going down without a fight
(Ooh) I hear them calling for you
(Ooh) I hear them callin'
In the middle of the night when the wolves come out
Headed straight for your heart, they come straight for your heart
(Ooh, ooh) I hear them calling for you
(Ooh, ooh) I hear them calling for you

I wish it wasn't true
But the whole world's tryna get a piece of you
And my heart keeps fightin' in this battle of fools
Gotta make it through, gotta make it through

In the middle of the night when the wolves come out
Headed straight for your heart like a bullet in the dark
One by one, I try to take them down
We can run and hide, ain't going down without a fight
(Ooh) I hear them calling for you
(Ooh) I hear them callin'
In the middle of the night when the wolves come out
Headed straight for your heart, they come straight for your heart

(Ooh, ooh) I hear them calling for you
