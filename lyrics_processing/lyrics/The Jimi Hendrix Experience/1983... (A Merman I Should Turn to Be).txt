Hooray, I awake from yesterday
Alive, but the war is here to stay
So my love, Catherina and me
Decide to take our last walk through the noise to the sea
Not to die, but to be reborn
Away from lands so battered and torn
Forever
Forever

Oh, say can you see, it's really such a mess
Every inch of Earth is a fighting nest
Giant pencil and lipstick tube-shaped things
Continue to rain and cause screaming pain
And the Arctic stains from silver blue to bloody red
As our feet find the sand and the sea
Is straight ahead
Straight up ahead

Well, it's too bad, that our friends can't be with us today
Well, it's too bad
"The machine that we built would never save us"
That's what they say
That's why they ain't coming with us today
And they also said
"It's impossible for man to live and breathe underwater forever"
Was their main complaint, yeah
And they also threw this in my face, they said
"Anyway, you know good and well
It would be beyond the will of God
And the grace of the King"
Grace of the King, yeah, yeah

So my darling and I make love in the sand
To salute the last moment ever on dry land
Our machine has done its work, played its part well
Without a scratch on our bodies and we bid it farewell
Starfish and giant foams greet us with a smile
Before our heads go under, we take a last look at the killing noise
Of the out-of-style
The out-of-style, out-of-style, ooh-ooh-ooh


So down and down and down and down
And down and down we go
Hurry, my darling, we mustn't be late
For the show
Neptune champion games to an aqua
World is so very dear
"Right this way," smiles a mermaid
I can hear Atlantis full of cheer

Atlantis full of cheer
I can hear Atlantis full of cheer
