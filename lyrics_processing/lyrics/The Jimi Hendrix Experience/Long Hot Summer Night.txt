Sure was a long, long, long, hot summer night
As far as my eyes could see (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
But my heart was way down in a
Cold, cold winter storm
Well, my darling, where can you be?
Where can you be, baby?
Where can you be?

There were three sugar walls and-a two candy cane windows
But the serious moon melted all those in sight (All those in sight)
Everybody's on fire but I'm a-snowing in a cold blizzard
Where are you on this-a hot cold summer?
Where are you on this-a hot cold summer?
Where are you on this-a hot cold summer night?

Around about this time the telephone blew its horn across the room
Scared little Annie clean out of her mind, clean out of her mind
Roman the Candle, he peeps out of his peekaboo hide and seek
And grabbed little Annie from the ceiling just in time
And the telephone keeps on screaming
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

"Hello," says my shaky voice, "Well, how are you doing?"
I start to stutter
Ah, can't you tell I'm doing fine? (Can't you tell I'm doing fine?)
It was my baby talking, she's way down across the border
She says "I'm gonna hurry to you, I've been a fool
And I'm tired of crying, so tired"

Yeah, it's a long, long, long, hot summer night
As far as my eyes could see (As far, as far as I could see)
But I can feel the heat coming on as my baby's getting closer
I'm so glad that my baby's coming to rescue me (Glad that my baby's coming to rescue)
I said so glad that my baby's coming to rescue me (Oh yeah, glad that my baby's coming to rescue)
So glad my baby's coming to rescue me
Glad that my baby's coming to rescue, rescue, rescue, rescue, rescue
Rescue, rescue, what'd I say
Rescue me, rescue me
