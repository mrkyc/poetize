C'mon.. that right.. yea.. uhh
Hail Mary full of grace
Forgive me for my sins
Never often with the losses
We be chockin up the wins
89-90 in Detroit is where you find me
In the boat passed the island I can see the sun smilin
I rock the Cartier shades to block the rays for the sunny days
While you smokin loosies doin world plays in mummie stays
Coughin.. let it sink, when theres a will theres a way ni**a jadapink
*All eyes on me man I think they wanna ride on me (tupac)*
Im doin 40 on the lodge drop the top and praisin God
If he made me in his image then he did an amazing job
My styles like wow life from shitting on sight
Icepic kicked the beat I whipped the writ on sight
Me and my Ni**as goin back like LeBron line
And I ain't stoppin till I sign the same deal LeBron signed

Sittin in the coupe blowin funky
Seats slides back while my bitch thumbin hundreds
Got a record deal but im still servin junkies
Play me on some cheese get blew like a trumpet
I don't fuck with nobody I ain't got no humbles
So if you see him with me then he fam dont fuck with him
Icy white sticks so you never seen me tuckin em
Ni**a try to snatch steez then he gone get a slug-in-em
Man I swear i'm tryna get off the street shit
But Ni**as play tuff and I'm the wrong one to beef with
Catch you and that lil hoe walkin to ya whip
Then smack you right there in ya mother fuckin lip
Like watch what you say when you talkin bout a king pin
Bitch I'm the chief you a motha fuckin Indian
Hoe ni**a better be lucky I'm a Christian
Cuz a couple years ago boy I woulda did you in

I be gettin Money and I be the plug
I got a dope house now they think I sell the drugs
I got a couple shooters and they shootin on the love
When I saw my first twenty thats the day I fell in love
Yesterday I took a L but today I bounced back
Quote I am the shit in quote all caps
And the whole team ballin we ain't gotta shoot for caps
And they want me up in apple cuz they know that I trap
Yup.. and I be movin like a star get my two shirts in the L
Ni**a I be livin large got a light skin whip lookin like El Debarge
With a light skin bitch lookin like her name is Marge
Yea you a simp-sons and that in my plans
We use to ride deep as hell in that 4-door sedan
But then I cut some ni**as off and so I went and got the coupe
Cuz I ain't got no time for ni**as

BYLUG
Sippin henny early with my ni**a Earlly Mac
I fucked this bitch quick so she can hurry back
My chain and watch together costs me 30 stacks
When you iced up you won't believe how girlies act
Cuz that bitch come from Saks, ice come from nary
I be stuntin I got diamonds flooded in my carties
If I see a hater when I walk inside a party
I throw some money at his ass and don't feel sorry
I feel like I'm in a safari when I wear my fur
Don't nobody talk more shit then me on this earth
My bitch purse cost me 22 hundred
She caught me cheatin so I had to buy her somethin
I had these hoes blushin every time they hear me rap
Not a goon but if you try me ni**a its a wrap
I put the hood on the map and they love me for it
Just went from drivin ni**a you cannot afford it
These louboutin sneakers cost your granny mortgage
20 thousand in my pocket there ain't no pay for shortage
I'm not the poorest or the richest but I'm gettin cake
