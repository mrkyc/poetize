Wanna be me, wanna beat me
My fault I made it look easy
My nigga ain't a trick but he treat me
Gucci frames on my face just to please me
Give me what I want so I'm yours now
Stingy, I ain't got enough to go round
Bentley  open up the door now
Switch up the lane while I switch up the flow now

Uh uh, gold in the safe
Got gold on my face, got gold on my wrist (wrist, wrist)
If I ain't paid and if I ain't great  then baby what's this?
Simon said I have somewhere to get
Ran the play, then I caught the assist
God's plan, he take credit for this
He been molding me for it, I'm ready for this
Ripped CD to MP3
Every boy want to be in PC
I don't love him right now no Kiki
Gotta call three times just to reach me
If he with me then he need me
If he with me then he freaky
Now his friends know my thang real leaky
Now my name is  shit creepy
He a big boy
I'm a big toy
That's nerf gun
Body hits boy
Might hurt some
If he throw a little cash might twerk some
Watch this boy
Might put in online DVD
XXX keep mine on repeat
When you really want to stunt come see me
Put the queen in the front when you greet me bitch

Want to get change, gotta make change
Got a code word, got a nickname
It's a cold world cuz of cocaine

Wanna be the best, gotta beat the best
Take a plane from the Porsche when you leave the nest
Niggas need a Plan b hit a CVS
Niggas said follow back, where you leading us?
I'm talking mil a check like Belichick
Make it a rain, shootas waiting on a FEMA check
Few days she was waiting on a stimulus
She don't need no nigga, she a feminist
She ain't did shit wrong, she was innocent
She a hundred thirty pounds too militant
Ain't no password for you for the internet
Ain't nobody in your life when your enter this
I'm a big boy (bitch), you a sick boy (sick)
Tech wrist throw Ds like rich boy
Get ghost playing with me that was his choice
Put one on all of y'all like Hitboy
I'm a real one, and I'm still one
Feel good to be big for the little one
Niggas think too small need a bail bond
Hotheads need chill for the children
She a big girl, I'm a big fan
That's big fun at Six Flags
One Louis, one Gucci that's mismatch
One left in the head that's get back
A hundred sets in the summer that's six pack
One mil right here one big stack
And my bank for sure like shit 
AR one five no kick back bitch
Oooh Ahhh Ooh Ahhh
