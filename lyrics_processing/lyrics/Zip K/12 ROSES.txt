We can't let these hoes get up under your skin
None of these hoes friends bad as none of your friends
My shit be one ten when you hit your poses
Hoes all in your business and they stick they nose in
But can't no bitches hit without you getting yours in
You ain't gotta ask you're already chosen
If you're that bad deserve your finger frozen
And she want a bag not a dozen roses
And she want a bag not a dozen roses
And she want a bag not a dozen roses
And she want a bag not a dozen roses
And you know you need a whole category by yourself
You in good health
Your body tell the story by itself
And I know you well
And I know you like Chanel
Slip your foot in heels
Foot the gas
I foot the bill
And you juggle classes at your university
Wanna drive your ass around the universe with me
I can show you things that your professor failed to teach
Cut off my own arm before I ever ever reach

Rub you where you want when you
Coconut oil up can I rub it in
