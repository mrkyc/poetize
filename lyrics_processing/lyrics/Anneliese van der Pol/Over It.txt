That behind my eyes a sad girl cried
And how could you know
That I hurt so much inside
How could you know
That I'm not the average girl
I'm carrying the wait of the world (Yeah..)
So can you get me out of here
Take me away
Hop in the car
Drive till the gas runs out
And then walk so far
And we can't see this place anymore
Take a day off
Give it a rest
So I can forget about this mess
If I lighten up a little bit I will be
Over it
I'm playing the role of the happy girl but no one knows
Inside I'm alone but I will never let it show
I dread everyday
Too much work and not enough play
Over and over its always the same (Yeah..)
But you can make everything okay

We'll jump in the car
Drive till the gas runs out and I walk so far
And we can't...see...this place anymore
Take a day off
Give it a rest
So I can forget about this mess
If I lighten up a little bit
Then I will be
Over it
(Over it)
And when the world is closing in
I can leave it all and just walk away
I can always start all over again
I am closer to a better day
Take me Away
Jump in the car
Drive till the gas runs out and I walk so far
And we can't see this place anymore
Take a day off
Give it a rest
So I can forget about this mess
If I lighten up a little bit
Then I will be

Then I will be
