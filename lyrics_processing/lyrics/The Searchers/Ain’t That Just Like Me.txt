Its fleece was white as snow
And everywhere that Mary went
The lamb was sure to go
Now ain't that just like me?
(What you say baby?)
Following you around
You know that I love you
(Yeah)
I love you
(Come on baby)
I just can't put you down
Don't tell anybody, honey
Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall
Humpty Dumpty had a great fall
All the King's horses and all the King's men
They couldn't put him back again
Now ain't that just like me?
(What you say baby?)
Crackin' up over you
You know that I love you
(Yeah)
I love you
(Come on baby)
Nothin' else I can do
Well, shake it up now

Now the cow jumped over the moon
The little dog came out the best of all
And the dish ran away with the spoon
Now ain't that just like me
(What you say baby?)
Tryin' to run away with you
You know that I love you
(Yeah)
I love you
(Come on baby)
