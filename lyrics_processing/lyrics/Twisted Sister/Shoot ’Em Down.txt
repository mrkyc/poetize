Ow
She looks so fine like champagne or wine
No one ever gets her
Oh, ain't she cool, plays us for fools
If we wanna let her
Across the room she's sees some buffoon
Blown away by her style
She goes out of her way so that she can play
And make him beg for a little while
Shoot 'em down, shoot 'em down
Shoot 'em down, shoot 'em down
Shoot 'em down, shoot 'em down
Shoot 'em down to the ground
Like caviar or a fine foreign car
He's a motivator
Dressed to the T's, they're down on their knees
He's a master baiter
He'll make 'em crawl for the hell of it all
He likes to see 'em cry
And then just for fun, he'll say she's the one
And then he'll make her die
You might also likeHe's gotta shoot 'em down, shoot 'em down
Shoot 'em down, shoot 'em down
Shoot 'em down, shoot 'em down
Shoot 'em down to the ground
They don't care about feelings
They were meant to be stepped on
And while one is healing
They go and step on another one
Now, these people prey on us everyday
Some are bad, some badder
They think we're fools, so they make their own rules
It only gets us madder
Well, they think they're hot
Well, I say they're not
They shoot us down for fun
If they wanna play, let's make 'em pay
Shoot them down with a fucking gun
Shoot 'em down, shoot 'em down
Shoot 'em down, shoot 'em down
Shoot 'em down, shoot 'em down
Shoot 'em down to the ground, come on now
Shoot 'em down, shoot 'em down
Shoot 'em down, shoot 'em down
Shoot 'em down, shoot 'em down
Shoot 'em down to the ground
Shoot 'em down, shoot 'em down
Shoot 'em down, shoot 'em down
Shoot 'em down, shoot 'em down
Shoot them down, come on honey
Shoot them down
