Oh, it's so nice to see you all inside my dreamy little world
And it's so nice to be with all you lovely little boys and girls
Make yourselves comfortable, my place is so divine
Don't you think I'm wonderful? Say yes! You're on my time
Stay away
From Captain Howdy
Stay away
From Captain Howdy
Don't try to leave, the doors are locked and only I have got the key
Forget the windows, they're nailed shut and boarded up so you can't see
You'll love the light show, oh, I'm sure you'll think it's swell
When they go off, you're welcome to my living hell
Stay away
From Captain Howdy
Stay away
From Captain Howdy

Come here, my sweet
Let me help you with that
There, that's better
You might also likeI'm overjoyed at all the games I'm playing here with you today
But I'm so sad the party's over and we can no longer play
You think you're going home to your own little bed
But that's impossible, you can't sleep when you're dead
Stay away
From Captain Howdy
Stay away
From Captain Howdy

It happened in the broad daylight
So unexpected came the knife
A child's scream sliced through the air
But no one came or seemed to care, no
The man's description did little good
A local stranger from the neighborhood
Those little kids, oh, he left behind
With their mangled lives and their tortured minds
Since he didn't seem to care, then don't you think it's only fair
Call for street justice
Let no mercy show
Call for street justice
Don't let him go
The man was caught and brought before a judge
Who had just returned from a three drink lunch
His lawyer screamed "you must set him free"
And off he went on a technicality
Since the law don't seem to care, then don't you think it's only fair
Call for street justice
Why should parents cry?
Call for street justice
How many have to die?

The mob assembled, smoke filled the air
And marched in anger to do what's fair
To bring to justice this soulless thing
And show the others what evil brings
Now before you shake your head, think if it was your child instead
Call for street justice, tell me what you'd do
Call for street justice, pray this isn't true
Call for street justice, why should parents cry
Call for street justice, how many have to die
Call for street justice, when slime escapes the law
Call for street justice, we'll even up the score
Call for street justice, let no mercy show
Call for street justice, please don't let him go
