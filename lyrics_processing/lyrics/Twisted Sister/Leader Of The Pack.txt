"Hey, is he really goin' out with her?"
"There he is, let's ask him"
"Hey man, is that your ring she's wearin'?"
"Uh, huh"
"Man, it must be great ridin' with her"
"Are you pickin' her up after school today?"
"Uh uh"
"By the way where'd you meet her?"
I met her at the candy store
She turned around and smiled at me
You get the picture?
Yeah, we see
That's when she fell for
The leader of the pack

Her folks were always putting me down (down, down)
They said I came from the wrong side of town
They said I came from the wrong side of town
They told her that I was bad
But she knew I was sad
That's why she fell for
The leader of the pack
You might also like
One day her dad said find someone new (new, new)
She had to tell me that we were through
(What you mean when you say
That you better go find somebody new?)
I stood there and asked her why
But all she could do was cry
"I'm sorry I hurt you
The leader of the pack"

She was so small
As she kissed me goodbye
Her tears were beginning to show
And as she drove away on that rainy night
I begged her to go slow
If she heard, I'll never know
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
(Look out, look out, look out, look out)

I felt so helpless what could I do?
Remembering all the things we'd been through
The gang, they all stop and stare
I can't hide my tears, but I don't care
I'll never forget her
The leader of the pack
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Leader of the Pack, and now she's gone
(Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone)
Leader of the Pack, and now she's gone
(Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone)
Leader of the Pack, and now she's gone
(Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone)
Leader of the Pack, and now she's gone
(Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone)
Leader of the Pack, and now she's gone
(Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone)
Leader of the Pack, and now she's gone
(Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone)
Leader of the Pack, and now she's gone
(Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone)
Leader of the Pack, and now she's gone
(Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone)
Leader of the Pack, and now she's gone
(Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone)
