Thousands of faces wanting me
How can I lead? How can I rule?
When I'm the king of the fools
What kind of kingdom has no throne?
No crown or castle do I own
I don't have silver gold or jewels
Yet I'm the king, king of the fools
And I can't help believing the world is on my side
No I can't help believing in my heart
But I can't stop this feeling that I should run and hide
So before I die I sit and wonder why, oh I wonder why
King of the fools
Who will face the world defiantly
King of the fools
Understanding less than me
King of the fools
Oh I'm the king, king of the fools
The outside world can't understand
Just who we are and who I am
Well we don't want there life with rules
I'll be the king, king of the fools
You might also likeKing of the fools
I proudly rule for all to see
King of the fools
Theres nothing else I'd rather be
King of the fools
Yes I'm the king, king of the fools
King of the fools
King of the fools
And I can't help believing the world is on my side
No I can't help believing in my heart
But I can't stop this feeling that I should run and hide
So before I die I sit and wonder why oh I wonder why
King of the fools
I hear them laugh and shout at me
King of the fools
They shake their heads in disbelief
King of the fools
Oh I'm the king, king of the fools
King of the fools
Who are these people to cast stones
King of the fools
Better a fool than just a clone
King of the fools
Yes I'm the king, king of the fools
