Shut up, just shut up, shut up
Shut up, just shut up, shut up

Shut up, just shut up, shut up
Shut it up, just shut up, shut up

We try to take it slow, but we're still losin' control
And we try to make it work
But it still ends up the worst and I'm crazy
For tryna be your lady
I think I'm goin' crazy

Girl, me and you were just fine, you know
We wined and dined, did them things
That couples do when in love, you know
Walks on the beach and stuff, you know
Things that lovers say and do
"I love you, boo", "I love you too"
"I miss you a lot", "I miss you even more"
That's why I flew you out when we was on tour
But then something got outta hand
You started yellin' why I would break plans (What did you say to me?)
Even though I had legitimate reasons (Bullshit)
You know I had to make them dividends (Bullshit)
How could you trust your private eyes, girl?
That's why you don't believe my lies and quick to say

But we're still losin' control
And we try to make it work
But it still ends up the worst and I'm crazy
For tryna be your lady
I think I'm goin' crazy (Why, why, why)

Why does emotion gotta move so fast?
Love is progress if you could make it last
Why is it that you just lose control
Every time you agree on takin' it slow?
So why has it got to be so damn tough?
'Cause fools in lust could never get enough
Of love; showin' him the love that you be givin'
Changin' up your livin' for a lovin' transition (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Girl, it's a mission tryin' to get you to listen
Screamin' at each other has become our tradition
You yell, I yell, everybody yells
Got neighbors across the street sayin', "Who the hell?!"
Who the hell? What the hell's goin' down?
Too much of the bickering, kill it with the sound and
Shut up, just shut up, shut up

I think I'm goin' crazy (Uh, uh), woah-oh

Girl, our love is dyin'
Why did you stop tryin'?
I never been a quitta, but I do deserve betta
Believe me, I will do bad
Let's forget the past and start this new plan
Why? 'Cause it's the same old routine
And then next week I hear them scream
Girl, I know you're tired of the things they say
You're damn right
'Cause I heard them lame damn excuses just yesterday
That was a different thing
(No, it ain't)
That was a different thing
(No, it ain't)
That was a different thing
It was the same damn thing, same ass excuses
Boy, you're useless, woah, oh!
