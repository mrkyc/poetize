Lapit mga kaibigan at makinig kayo (Listen up y'all)
Ako'y may dala-dalang balita galing sa bayan ko (Listen closely, y'all)
Nais kong ipamahagi ang mga kuwento
Ang mga pangyayaring nagaganap sa lupang pinangako

Yo, every place got a ghetto
This is my version of it, check it out

Listen closely yo, I got a story to tell
A version of my ghetto where life felt for real
Some would call it hell but to me, it was heaven
God gave me the grace, amazing ways of living
How would you feel if you had to catch your meal
Build a hut to live and to eat and chill in?
Having to pump the water outta the ground (Outta the ground)
The way we put it down, utilizing what is around
Like land for farming, river for fishing
Everyone helping each other whenever they can
We making it happen, from nothing to something
That's how we be surviving back in my homeland

Yo, it's been a while, but
I've been back home to my homeland (Check it out)
To see what's going on

Man, it feels good to be back at home
And it's been a decade, on the journey all alone
I was fourteen when I first left Philippines
I've been away half my life, but it felt like a day
To be next to my mom with her home-cooked meal
Man I felt complete, my emotions I feel
Now life has changed for me in the US
But back at home, man, life was a mess
I guess sometimes life's stresses gets you down
On your knees, oh brother I wish I could have helped you out
