I drive these brothers crazy, I do it on the daily
They treat me really nicely, they buy me all these iceys
Dolce & Gabbana, Fendi and then Donna
Karan, they be sharing all their money
Got me wearin' fly, but I ain't asking
They say they love my ass in Seven Jeans, True Religion
I say, "No," but they keep giving
So I keep on taking, and no, I ain't taken
We can keep on dating, I keep on demonstrating my love (Love)
My love, my love, my love (Love)
You love my lady lumps (Love)
My hump, my hump, my hump (Love)

She's got me spending (Ooh)

I met a girl down at the disco
She said, "Hey, hey, hey, yeah, let's go
I could be your baby, you can be my honey
Let's spend time, not money
And mix your milk with my Coco Puffs
Milky, milky coco
Mix your milk with my Coco Puffs
Milky, milky, right"

They say I'm really sexy
The boys, they wanna sex me
They always standing next to me
Always dancing next to me
Tryna feel my hump, hump
Looking at my lump, lump
You can look, but you can't touch it
If you touch it, I'ma start some drama
You don't want no drama
No, no drama, no, no, no, no drama
So don't pull on my hand, boy
