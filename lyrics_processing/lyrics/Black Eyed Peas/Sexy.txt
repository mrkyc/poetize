I took your picture, with one particular reason
And it's to capture your character
I like to sit and stare at 'cha
Ain't nothing wrong with starin' at 'cha
Girl, don't get scared that I envision us getting married
And I ain't tryin' to rush nuttin'
'Cause I ain't rushin'
It'll take a time like
"What's them things that move slow you know them...
Damn..I can't think 'cause you on my mind..."
And when you on my mind
Can't find anything to rhyme with rhyme
I'll gotta rhyme rhyme with mixture
And speakin' of mixture
With you, I wanna get mixed up
I'm like a record and you're like a record
So let's let the DJ mix us
You're like an elixir
That's got me tipsy
This is just like Ripley's
Believe it or not girl, but I love you...

Girl, you really got me goin'
(Outta control)
I don't know what I'm doin'
Let's let it go
And do what we do best
(Take off our clothes)
We look better undressed

You take me to ecstasy
Without takin' ecstasy
Its exactly like ectasy
When you layin' right next to me
I'm sexin' you, sexin' you
You sexin' me, sexin' me
