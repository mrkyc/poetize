Party all the time, party all the time
Party all the time, party all the time

If-if-if we could party all night and sleep all day
And throw all of my problems away
My life would be easy, my life would be easy

I would drink and go out-out with my crew
Party-party all the time, yep, that's what I'd do
Mack models, pop bottles, live life like the Sheik
(Party) Monday through Sunday every day of the week

Hot octane light in the fast lane zoom
And the joint don't pop, till I walk in the room
And the DJ's rocking my favorite tune
And they're shaking up the speaker like boom, boom, boom

If we could party all night and sleep all day
And throw all of my problems away
My life would be easy, my life would be easy
If we could party all night and sleep all day
And throw all of my problems away
It'd would be easy, our lives would be easy
