I feel like I wanna smack somebody
Turn around and bitch slap somebody
But I ain't goin' out bro (no, no, no)
I ain't givin' into it (no, no, no)
Anxieties bash my mind in
Terrorizing my soul like Bin Laden
But I ain't fallin' down bro (no, no, no)
I won't lose control bro (no, no, no)
Shackled and chained
My soul feels stained
I can't explain got an itch on my brain
Lately my whole aim is to maintain
And regain control of my mainframe
My bloods boiling its beatin' out propane
My train of thoughts more like a runaway train
I'm in a fast car drivin' in a fast lane
In the rain and I might just hydroplane

I don't fear none of my enemies
And I don't fear bullets from Uzi's
I've been dealing with something that's worse than these
That'll make you fall to your knees and that's

The anxiety
The sane and the insane rivalry
Paranoia's brought me to my knees
Lord, please, please, please
Take away my anxiety
The sane and the insane rivalry
Paranoia's brought me to my knees
Lord, please, please, please
Take away my anxiety

My head keeps running away, my brother
The only thing making me stay, my brother
But I won't give into it, bro (no, no, no)
Gotta get myself back now
God, I can't let my mind be
Tell my enemy is my own
Gots to find my inner wealth
Gots to hold up my thoughts
I can't get caught (no, no, no)
I can't give into it now (no, no, no)
Emotions are trapped set on lock
Got my brain stuck goin through the motions
Only I know what's up
I'm filled up with pain
Tryin' to gain my sanity
Everywhere I turn, it's a dead end in front of me
With nowhere to go, gotta shake this anxiety
Got me feelin' strange, paranoia took over me
And its weighin' me down
And I can't run any longer, yo
Knees to the ground

I don't fear none of my enemies
And I don't fear bullets from Uzi's
I've been dealing with something that's worse than these
That'll make you fall to your knees and that's
My anxiety
The sane and the insane rivalry
Paranoia's brought me to my knees
Lord, please, please, please
Take away my anxiety
The sane and the insane rivalry
Paranoia's brought me to my knees
Lord, please, please, please
