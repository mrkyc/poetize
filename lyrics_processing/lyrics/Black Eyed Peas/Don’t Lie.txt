Yeah, uh-uh
La, da, da, da, da-da
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry

Hey baby, my nose is gettin' big
I noticed it be growin' when I be tellin' them fibs, now
You say your trust's gettin' weaker
Probably 'cause my lies just started gettin' deeper
And the reason for my confession is that I learned my lesson
And I really think you ought to know the truth
Because I lied and I cheated and I lied a little more
But after I did it, I don't know what I did it for
I admit that I've been a little immature
With your heart like I was the predator
In my book of lies, I was the editor
And the author, I forged my signature
And now I apologize for what I did to ya
'Cause what you did to me I did to you

No, no, no, no, baby, no, no, no, no, don't lie
'Cause you know, know, know, know
Yeah, you know, know, know, know, you gotta try
What you gonna do when it all comes out
When I really see you, what you're all about?
No, no, no, no, baby, no, no, no, no, don't lie
'Cause you know, you know, you know, you know
You know you gotta try (Stop, st-stop, stop, st-stop stop lying)

She said, "I'm leaving"
'Cause she can't take the pain
It's hard to continue this love, it ain't the same
Can't forget the things that I've done inside her brain
Too many lies committed, too many games
She feelin' like a fool gettin' on the last train
Tryna maintain, but the feeling won't change
I'm sorry for the things that I've done and what I became
Caught up in living my life in the fast lane
Blinded by lights, cameras, you know the fame
I don't know the reason why I did these things

Oh, and I lie and I lie and I lie and I lie
And now our emotions are drained
'Cause I lie and I lie and a little lie, lie
And now your emotions are drained

No, no, no, no, baby, no, no, no, no, don't lie (Don't, don't you lie)
'Cause you know, know, know, know
Yeah, you know, know, know, know, you gotta try (Got to, got to try)
What you gonna do when it all comes out (What you gonna do, baby?)
When I really see you, what you're all about?
No, no, no, no, baby, no, no, no, no, don't lie
Because you know, you know, you know, you know
You know you gotta try

Hmm, yo, I'm lyin' to my girl
Even though I love her and she all in my world
I give her all my attention and diamonds and pearls
She the one that make me feel on top of the world
Still I'm lyin' to my girl, I do it

Oh, and I lie and I lie and I lie and then I lie
'Til there's not turning back
I don't know why I lie and I lie
'Til I don't know who I am
But then I tell myself

No, no, no, no, baby, no, no, no, no, don't lie (Don't you lie)
'Cause you know, know, know, know
Yeah, you know, know, know, know, you gotta try (You know, you know you gotta)
What you gonna do when it all comes out
When I really see you, what you're all about?
No, no, no, no, baby, no, no, no, no, don't lie
No, no, no, no, baby, no, no, no, no
