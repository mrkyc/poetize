A day in a life of a kid in America
Everyone's a critic, watch them criticize your character
Everybody watching ya
People love to stare at ya
Everybody's greedy ain't nobody tryna share with ya
Our leaders are embarrassing
I think they need some parenting
Tell me why they playing with the fire and the kerosene?
Kids on the Percocet, trippin' on the medicine
Call it like I see ya we some drugged up Americans
Everybody's following
Ain't nobody leading
People lovin' guns more than kids is the season
And they say the reason is to protect their freedom
But we don't believe 'em

'Cause all that we are
All that we're made of
Is big, big love
Big, big love
And all that we have
All that we're made of
Is big, big love
Big, big love
That's all that we are
That's all that we are
That's all that we are
Is big, big love
Is big, big love

When I was a young boy
Used to hear the people say
Power to the people but we them people nowadays
We ain't never giving up
Now we got our hands up
We can't breathe, cause their hearts ain't big enough
All we need is just us, hate got ya guessing
War is the answer but really, what's the question?
Money got 'em stressin'
Fear got 'em flexin'
Phones got us zoned out
Now we lose connection, please stand by
It takes you and I to keep the hope alive
'Cause we're living in a time where you're fighting to survive
And all we need is love

All that we are
All that we're made of
Is big, big love
Big, big love
All that we have
All that we're made of
Is big, big love
Big, big love
That's all that we are
That's all that we are
That's all that we are
Is big, big love
Is big, big love
Life is a blessing
Knowledge is a weapon
You should choose love instead of being reckless
Candle in the darkness, hope changes the heartless
Here's love to guide you, I'll be there regardless
Situation global, we're like in a rowboat
Swimming up the river, so I can deliver
Messages to masses, no matter your status
Nothing's ever over, we believe in second chances
Many people dying, governments are lying
Stand for our rights and please no more violence
Talk with the kindness, together we're united
When we are one
Nothing can divide us

All that we are
All that we're made of
Is big, big love
Big, big love
All that we have, all that we're made of
Is big, big love
Big, big love
All that we are
All that we're made of
Is big, big love
Big, big love
All that we have, all that we're made of
Is big, big love
Big, big love
That's all that we are
That's all that we are
That's all that we are
Is big, big love
