Tonight's the night, let's live it up
I got my money, let's spend it up (I feel)
Go out and smash it, like, "Oh my God!"
Jump off that sofa, let's kick it off (I feel)

I know that we'll have a ball
If we get down and go out and just lose it all
I feel stressed out, I wanna let it go
Let's go way out, spaced out, and losin' all control (I feel)
