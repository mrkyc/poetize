I sit across the room
It's half filled with light
The jade reflective kind
The vase is half filled with time
Wanting to spend it, I find
It's only in my mind
Yeah, I know you won't wait
Can't stop you taking trips out of state
I find me half empty
With the memory of your face
And still, we're causalities
Of summer nights and intuitions
I talk to Cash and tell her all my hopes and wishes
She says I need a man with morals and ambition
Still shudder at that idea of that old tradition
Like that, 'cept for the fact that I get super bored
Fast, won't you come back
Take your sweater up and drop it to the ground
You know I love the sound
Won't you tell me to my face?
Champagne glass shattering
Emotions in this space
Gas peddles to the floor
Everything you can't afford
Is right here, hands up
You know what I'm searching for
I can be your bad girl
But only half the time
You think you're going to pass it up
You've got delusions in your mind
First you'll find I'm crazy
Then you'll find that I was right
And it's your choice to fight or fly
You might also like
I know I said I wouldn't get caught up
In who you are
Don't act like you won't too

Your finger tips are never cool
I'm water for your wine
In the place where they won't find

And still, (still)
I think I dream in turquoise, turquoise
Hopeless inhibitions
And your voice
Still I hear you screaming turquoise
Turquoise, turquoise
Turquoise girl
Still I'm dreaming (Still I'm dreaming)
Still I'm dreaming (Still I'm dreaming)
Still I'm dreaming (Still I'm dreaming)
Still I'm dreaming (Still I'm dreaming)
Still I'm dreaming (Still I'm dreaming)
Dreaming (dreaming)
Dreaming (dreaming)
