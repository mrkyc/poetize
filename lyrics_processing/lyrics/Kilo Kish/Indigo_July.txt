I spent three hours on the phone
Talking to my girl tryna let her know
I told you what we do when we're all alone
Laughing over music while the liquor flows
She try to act like she don't care
She got her own man but there's nothing there
I bet she's jealous on the low
Tattle tale secrets but no one knows
I got my toes done the other day
In Brooklyn cause it's cheaper and around the way
I stopped at a grocery and got some wine
I'm not sure yet but I think it's time to take the shit to the second floor
I get in the cab and I'm at your door
I knock once, I knock twice, I rang the bell
Looked up in the sky then I heard her yell

Sorry baby girl I don't think that no one's home
I'm scratching my head wondering where you've gone to
I easily make believe that all the things you do
Aren't full of shit but they are
And now I'm so confused
Sorry baby girl I don't think that no one's home
I'm scratching my head wondering where you've gone to
I easily make believe that all the things you do
Aren't full of shit but they are
And now I'm so confused

No ones ever home
You ain't never home
No ones ever home
You ain't never home
Part II: "July"

Sunglasses on deck
And cut up shorts are matching boy you know what comes next
Let's chill out and have a beer outside
Because you know there's nothing better in the summertime
At the park, on the street, in the house, on the beach
You make my day brighter like all the time
I'm happy when I'm with you cause I know you're mine
Let's climb on the roof, sleep on the floor, look up at the sky and there's nothing more
Then I'm wanting when I'm with you to never fade away
Like the sun that goes behind the clouds on rainy days
It's just amazing to me
The heat against the city all it's energy
And none of that compares to either you or me
All I need is you and good company
The sun is shining, I'm on my way
Boy you're the best thing about Saturdays
The sun is shining, I'm on my way
You're the best thing about Saturdays
Sunday too, and Monday too, and Tuesday too, It's just me and you
Let's chill out and have a beer outside
Because you know there's nothing better in the summertime
