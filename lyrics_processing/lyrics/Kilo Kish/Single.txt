Okay, I think I'm ready this time
Kilo Kish, Lets Go

Innocent, maybe not
Yeah, you should take a second thought
Cause this might not be very smart
I don't practice what I been taught
Take your shoes off at the door
Yeah, tip toe on my bedroom floor
Boy you gotta keep quiet
Cause I like things to start off quiet
You ain't got to lie Craig
When there's nothing to hide babe
I know that you have someone else
But I could use a little help
Hold up wait a minute
She might just let you roll up in it
But this is on some other shit
And that's why she's the one you're with

And I'm single
I'm hotter than your girl
So I don't care if she know
I ain't trippin' on nothin'
I'm breakin' up somethin'
And my homegirl said she got my back if you roll up
And I'm single, tonight I'm single
Yeah I'm single, tonight I'm single
And I ain't trippin' on nothin'
I'm breakin' up somethin'
And my homegirl said she got my back if you roll up, tonight
You might also like
I might take your man too
Ha, fuck around and watch me do it
Your boyfriend says she's so bad
I don't even feel bad
Whisper here, whisper there
Can't wait to run his fingers through my hair
Bitch you really got it bad
I think the phrase was You Mad
I didn't plan for you to know
You think it's me but you don't feel me though
He doesn't care anyway
He's always begging me to stay
Go ahead and cry your eyes
When he leaves here, I'll tell him go apologize
I kick him out every night
Cause you can do that when you single right
