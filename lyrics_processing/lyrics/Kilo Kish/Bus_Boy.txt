On the bus wanna know what's up
I'm drifting in and out, sippin' my styrofoam cup
I finally decided I should make the first cut
Starting with you, you only bring me bad luck
San Fran I ran, nigga, god damn
Love doesn't mean nothing if it doesn't have plans
The blind can see into eternity
If I describe to them what you mean to me
Back and forth, back and forth, what's worse?
Doing the same shit again is when you get your chest murked
As far as I'm concerned you only dig me more dirt
I mean my own grave, what the fuck am I saying?
I used to be smart when I did well in school
But now I feel lucky cause I'm handcuffed to you
I'm finally free, said the greyhound to duke
Until I find where I'm going, man at least I'm brand new
No, that's good?
Part II: "Boy"

Take a seat, sit down and relax
Boy, boy, boy
I'ma, I'mma put you on..
To some facts
Boy, boy, boy
Take a, take-a take-a seat
Sit down and relax
Boy, boy, boy
I'ma, I'mma put you, I'ma, I'mma put you on
Boy, boy, boy

Girls don't call back at 4 am
Cause booty-calls ain't cool with them
Girls don't like sports on the low
Girls pretend to laugh at jokes
Girls just want something they can feel
Tangible, shit becomes real

Take a seat, sit down and relax
Boy, boy, boy
I'ma, I'mma put you
I'ma, I'mma to some shit
Boy, boy, boy
Take a, take-a take-a
Take a, take a, take a seat
Boy, boy, boy
I'ma, I'mma put you
I'ma, I'mma put you on
Boy, boy, boy
