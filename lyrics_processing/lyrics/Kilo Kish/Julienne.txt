Tore me to pieces
When I heard the news
You know you could have just said
That you wanted something new
All right, all right
Sitting outside your house
Flowers in your hand
And you're stepping out

Why do you know where I live?
Why are you following me?

I'm not! I just--I just--I just wanna see you

That's not okay. No. No. That's not okay

Walking down Lafayette
And it's 10 am
You're at La Colombe
With your new best friend
You might also like
It's 10 am. I mean, there's nothing wrong with talking to colleagues
Maybe I just wanted to get a cup of coffee

But baby, I--I just...

You what?

Yeah, it's all making sense
She's a pretty girl
But did you let her know
I was from your world?

Why is that her business?
I... don't remember that
I--I don't think I should tell her
When did that happen?

I saw you! I saw you with her

She's not that attractive. She's not that attractive
Did you? Okay
Took her to dinner too
You're bold and she's brand-new
I cannot believe
Half of this shit from you

It was a business dinner. She paid

Oh, yeah the fuck right

We had--we had--we had coupons
It's not that she's brand new.. it's that you're just finding out

Oh my God

Julienne from work
She was just a friend
But now you picked her up
And you're holding hands

Actually, we shared a car
I know you're office-mates, but...
You know what? This is, like, complete bullshit

I'm trying to keep it... all in the office

I'm your girlfriend!

I'm pacing 'round and 'round
And I'm breaking down
A few shots of Jack
And I'm stepping out

You have a problem
You have a drinking problem. You have a drinking problem
You need to get that checked out
Maybe that's why it's not working out between us
Jack Daniels is very cheap
Whiskey?

I let myself right in
With your extra key
I bet it slipped your mind
You'd given it to me

I did not give you a key

Yeah you did, babe
You took it. You took it
That's called stealing
That's called theft

Don't you remember? That time that you went--

I--I--I waited in your room
Just to see your face
Then I cut it off
I guess we both replace

I needed that
That really fucking hurts
I think--can you put the knife down for a second?
I needed that a lot, and...
Baby, it's not... it's not that serious
Please don't do that

So, I--I--tore you to pieces
When I heard the news
You know you could have just said
That you wanted something new

I clearly said that
I let you under... you didn't understand
You would not listen
English. Are you foreign?
I'm sorry. You're laughing but I thought you were sad

I--I--I--tore you to pieces
When I heard the news
You know you could have just said
That you wanted something new

You really planned this shit out, didn't you?
I need to call the cops, I think
You--you--you crazy?
I think I'm bleeding
It's... don't laugh at me
