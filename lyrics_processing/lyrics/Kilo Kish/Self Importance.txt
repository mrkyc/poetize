yeah, I caught you, I caught you.
ignoring my presence
You know that I can get aggressive
(I can get aggressive, I can get aggressive, I can get aggressive, I can get a- I can get a-)
you know it only takes a second
to like, to like me
I am for sale, in the moment,
there's no reason for proof
can't you tell that I'm open?
won't let me ignore this?
calling my conscious like...

you've just dialed in to the operator
when you hear the *beep* you can leave a message
right now, your call can not be completed
do try again at your own convenience
dashing around, like a mad man
to alerts and vibrations under the table
or some other surface
soothin' my need to be feeling...
lonely
they're all turning the pages
without me
shit, let them.
you know what haven't learned my lesson.
(haven't learned a lesson, haven't learned a lesson, haven't learned like nothing)
and you know that I can be concerned if
it's not about me
fit in the box
and the circles
package myself up f
or imminent disposal
what's my sum?
what's my total?
draining battery life...

you've just dialed in to the operator
when you hear the *beep* you can leave a message
right now, your call can not be completed
do try again at your own convenience
she's taking flicks
of the sunset
there's only one, only one sun since I last checked
somehow his got more respect
i watch them hold phones up to mirrors
can't see myself through them,
i don't know about the future
if we are included
you've just dialed in to the operator
(operator, operator)
when you hear the,
you can leave a message
(hello, hello)
right now your call can not be completed
do try again at your own convenience
Its important
call me x4
