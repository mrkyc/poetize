Meditate, I took a moment to mediate
No dilation, nigga stayin' straight
Realizing people around me just people, and people will come and go
Whether you take a hoe
Will you feel the most
Will you feel the most
Uptight when the sun down shine?
Uptight when the sun down shine

Uptight when the sun down shine
I've been on a steady decline
Hopin' that I can turn water to wine
But revelation will not stop me
The complications will not stop me
Tellin' myself to not drop me
Don't drop me (medi-)
Don't drop me (medi-)
Don't drop me (meditate, meditate, meditate, meditate, meditate)
