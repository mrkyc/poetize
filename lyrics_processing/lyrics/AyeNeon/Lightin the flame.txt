She lightin' the flame
I done stayed in my lane for the last time
Yeah

Ahh, she callin' my name
She lightin' the flame
Dog, she flew in from Spain
I stayed in my lane
Fog, I wrote through the rain
And jotted the pain
Search for these words
But I'm not tryna name drop
Stop, go insane
That's the feeling when your brain pop
Beast to a tame
Or you chillin' in that lame spot
No, you a lame we ain't mixing in the same pot
Laughin' to the bank, got a brain clot

I'm from the 585 that counters 212
I put the khanda in I
That's the zu to the lu
I'm on the journey of I
Headaches that'll make you cry
Stratosphere to the sky
Molten Morals of lies (yeah, hm)
Swallow pain through the fire
Strecthin' further than time
I'm on a infinite climb
Thugger, Thugger in my slime
Swallow pain through the fire
Strecthin' further than time
I'm on a infinite climb
Thugger, Thugger in my slime

Maybe there are reasons for the things I do not know
Maybe I could find them but it's just so far to go
