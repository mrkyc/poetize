Talk about how I feel
Vinyl

I pollen the ears, so good, so good
We movin' like silk through the river of gold
I pollen the ears, so good, so good
We movin' like silk through the river of gold
I pollen the ears, so good, so good (Hey)
We movin' like silk through the river of gold (Gold)
I pollen the ears, so good, so good (So good)
We movin' like silk through the river of gold

It's awesome
Maybe talk about just how you feel
Maybe talk about just how I feel (How I feel, how I feel, how I feel, feel, baby)
It's awesome
Maybe talk about just how you feel
Maybe talk about just how I feel (How I feel, how I feel, how I feel, ayy, ayy, ayo STRIPE how you feel?!)

They like, "STRIPE, how is you feelin' lately?", I'm feelin' great
And I'm schemin' on the future so I can keep my brothers straight
My haters over jealous, they're driven from all they jealousy
That jealousy they feelin' is corruption to they energy
Corruption to my energy, corruption to the entities
This LSD is sendin' me to whole new planes, new dimensions
What's on my brain? That's ascension
I'm just tryna make connections
I'ma do me and you gon' do you
'Cause I ain't got the time to be feelin' blue
Feelin' down, feelin' sad, feelin' bad 'bout some shit that
I don't even care about a little bit
Take a hit, take a toke, feel the smoke in my lung
Feelin' good, feelin' lit and honestly, it's awesome
Let me talk about just how I feel, yeah
How I feel, it's awesome

We've been sitting here all day long
Talking about how well we were getting along
I'm starting to like your vibe, yeah
Like your style, I like your smile
Cannot be living this new lifestyle
I'm hoping you'd stay a while
There's one more thing that I might wish
Before you run off, take your mask off
If you talk about just how you feel
Then I'll let you in 'bout how I feel
How I feel, woah
I pollen the ears, so good, so good (Hey)
We movin' like silk through the river of gold (Gold)
