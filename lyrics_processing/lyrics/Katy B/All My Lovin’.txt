I sit by the window, in the shadow
Waiting for your headlights, come on, hurry now
Heart is beating so fast, walking to your car
Looking at your profile, I'm so nervous now

I can't describe the butterflies
That are forming inside of me
I'm back for more, come get me high
And I'll give you

All my lovin', lovin', lovin'
And it shows, don't it, don't it, don't it, don't it?
All my lovin', lovin', lovin'
And it shows, don't it, don't it, don't it, don't it?
I ain't bluffin', bluffin', bluffin'
Boy, you own it, own it, own it, own it (Yeah)
Like ecstasy, what you did to me
And I wanna take you there
I wanna take you there

Can you see my cheeks red?
As my palms sweat, tou can cut the tension
Come on, cut it, please
Speeding 'round the back roads, you're so in control
Tell me what to do now, I'm at your mercy

All my lovin', lovin', lovin'

I ain't bluffin', bluffin', bluffin'
Boy, you own it, own it, own it, own it (Yeah)
Like ecstasy, what you did to me
And I wanna take you there
I wanna take you there

If you want it, if you need it
You can have it, come and let me know
If you want it, if you need it
