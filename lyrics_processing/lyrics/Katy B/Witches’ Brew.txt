I open this book and blow the dust
From these pages of desire and lust
I'll search for a spell perfect for you
'Cause I need to get you enchanted with me too

Oh, oh, oh, come see what I got for you
All the others got me misunderstood
Come with me, I'll make you feel so good
Come with me, I'll make you feel so good
Oh, oh, oh, I need you to feel it too
All the others got me misunderstood
Come with me, I'll make you feel so good
Come with me, I'll make you feel so good

Rosemary, thyme, rose petals go into my brew
Stirring it slowly, around, I go, thinking of you
And how sweet life will be when you are finally mine
And we can live life how I've longed for all this time

Oh, oh, oh, come see what I got for you
All the others got me misunderstood
Come with me, I'll make you feel so good
Come with me, I'll make you feel so good
Oh, oh, oh, I need you to feel it too
All the others got me misunderstood
Come with me, I'll make you feel so good
Come with me, I'll make you feel so good

Open up your eyes now
Now your love belongs to me
Open up your eyes now
Now there's no escaping me
Open up your eyes now
Now your love belongs to me
Open up your eyes now
Now there's no escaping me

Oh, oh, oh, come see what I got for you
All the others got me misunderstood
Come with me, I'll make you feel so good
Come with me, I'll make you feel so good
Oh, oh, oh, I need you to feel it too
All the others got me misunderstood
Come with me, I'll make you feel so good
