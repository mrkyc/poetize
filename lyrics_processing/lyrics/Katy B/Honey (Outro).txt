Never used to have a lot
Made the most of what I got
Empty to shows to studios
To clubs to pirate radio
Queues to raise the bar, the crowd
Just to hear the music loud
Feel it penetrate my soul
Feel it taking all control
In love with life I try and stay
A promise that I made today
No matter how the others sway
Know I'll always be okay
Locked away within my hive
I will never cease to strive
Make the good shit gold and sweet
Make them hear it from the street
Every day I wake, I rise
Knowing that I have to try
Try create the life I want
Try be kind and confident
You might also likeLife that's full of people who
Care about the things they do
I need dreamers, thinkers, freaks
Stick around when shit gets peak
When shit gets real and hits the fan
All I have is who I am
All I have is London streets
All I have is rhymes and beats
All the rest I cannot feel
All the rest to me ain't real
Shallow world we live in now
Watch me try and work it out
At least I have these songs to sing
They might not seem like anything
But to me they are my truth
Lessons learned throughoutmy youth
Fables on white label's flow
When my spirit's diapped down low
And when my days feel free and fast
I pray for all those times I last
So I can keep them in my songs
Stories of my rights my wrongs
Lay it bare what's on my chest
But I know where to say it best
So I made the honey
So I made the honey for you
Now I feel just fine

My only escape is my headphone ting
Everyone talking but I'm not hearing
Zoning on my own ting
Music takes me away from caring
Old faces keep reappearing
But I still got my headphones in
And I ain't got much but the songs I sing
Keep me sane and away from pain
These songs are all that I have
And I'm still myself and that makes me glad
I can only be who I am
That's when I got my headphones in
And my world has ups and downs
But when the music's loud
It takes me away and if I can give suttin' back to the world
I hope that I make it proud
So I made the honey
So I made the honey for you
