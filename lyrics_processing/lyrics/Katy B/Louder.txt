Always, always
Always, always
Always, always
Always, always running late
I know I should procrastinate
I should be all hard rock I play
But sometimes hard work has to wait
There's always somewhere new to go
And I can never say no
(Say no, say no)
I have been awake for a day now
Twenty-four hours yet still I want it louder
Darkness can't get me to sleep yet
I'm not that weak yet
I just want it louder
Louder, louder, louder, louder
Louder, louder, louder, louder
Louder, louder, louder, louder
Louder, louder, louder, louder
Always, always running late
I know I should procrastinate
I should be all hard rock I play
But sometimes hard work has to wait
There's always somewhere new to go
And I can never say no
(Say no, say no)
I have been awake for a day now
Twenty four hours, yet still I want it louder
Darkness can't get me to sleep yet
I'm not that weak yet
I just want it louder
Louder, louder
Louder, louder
Louder, louder
Louder, louder
As I buy another round
With my final twenty pounds
Seems as if my money's spent
How am I gonna pay the rent
There's always somewhere new to go
There's always somewhere new to go
And I can never say no
(Say no, say no)
I have been awake for a day now
Twenty four hours, yet still I want it louder
Darkness can't get me to sleep yet
I'm not that weak yet
I just want it louder
Louder, louder
Louder, louder
Louder, louder
Louder, louder
There's always somewhere new to go
And I can never say, no
(Say no, say no)
There's always somewhere new to go
And I can never say, no
(Say no, say no)
I want it louder
I want it louder
