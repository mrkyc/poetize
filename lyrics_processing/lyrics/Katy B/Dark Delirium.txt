You hide away from it all
I lay my cards on the table
I think I'm feeling the fall
Mind's gone crazy
I run whenever you call
Try stopping now, I'm not able
I think I'm feeling the fall
You can save me

Now it's taken hold
Why you blowing so hot then cold
Deeper down we roll
Oh feeling like my soul has been sold

Need someone to take me from
All of this, what I've become
I've no sense of right nor wrong
Need someone to take me from
This dark delirium
But you take me deeper
This dark delirium
But you take me deeper
This dark delirium
But you take me deeper
This dark delirium
But you take me deeper
You might also like
Act out the day like I'm fine
Inside I'm crumbling, I'm fading
Are you just wasting my time
Stop playing
You draw the perfect design, no way of ever escaping
I'm 'bout to cross the border line
Who knows now what's awaiting

Now it's taken hold
Why you blowing so hot then cold
Deeper down we roll
Oh feeling like my soul has been sold

Need someone to take me from
All of this, what I've become
I've no sense of right nor wrong
Need someone to take me from
This dark delirium
But you take me deeper
This dark delirium
But you take me deeper
This dark delirium
But you take me deeper
This dark delirium
But you take me deeper

Need someone to take me from
All of this, what I've become
I've no sense of right nor wrong
Need someone to take me from
This dark delirium
But you take me deeper
This dark delirium
But you take me deeper
This dark delirium
But you take me deeper
This dark delirium
