Used to cover me in kisses
I felt your love three sixty degrees
Used to tell me all your secrets
Cause you know that I would keep them with ease
Now I'm feeling all alone, your touch is ice cold babe
You're in the bedroom on your phone, so why's it all changed babe

Got your little red light on
Flashing like a warning sign
I don't wanna be no fool, boy
Or is it all in my mind?
Got your little red light on
Flashing like a warning sign
I don't wanna be no fool, boy
Or is it all in my mind?

I hear the water from the shower
And I see it right there on the side
Would it really be that bad if I just had a look inside
If I could figure out your code
(Tryin' and tryin' again)
What I see is somethin' I don't wanna know
(And then I just have to pretend)
When I'm reading your expression
A little smile when you look at the screen
Sends my heart to my heels baby
Turns my eyes a bright shade of green
But I can't prove anything at all
(See there's something missing here)
You're acting so unnatural
(But you got that indeed)
You might also like
Got your little red light on (got your light on)
Flashing like a warning sign
I don't wanna be no fool, boy
Or is it all in my mind?
Got your little red light on (got your light on)
Flashing like a warning sign
I don't wanna be no fool, boy
Or is it all in my mind?

Who knew that a little red light
Could keep me wide awake at night
Who knew that a little red light
In the dark could seem so bright
Who knew that a little red light
Could keep me wide awake at night
Who knew that a little red light
In the dark could seem so bright

Got your little red light on (got your light on)
Flashing like a warning sign (I see it)
I don't wanna be no fool, boy
Or is it all in my mind?
Got your little red light on (got your light on)
Flashing like a warning sign
I don't wanna be no fool, boy
