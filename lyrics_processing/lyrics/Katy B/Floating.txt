Sorry that I let you in
To only go and let you down, down
Glided like a feather, we
Craved the ground
An angel came and told me to
Put salt upon this stubborn wound, yeah
She said I need to let this heal
It's over now, mmm

We deserve much better than this
Than all this nastiness
Can't master it like two passing ships
Sailing right beside
Hiding from the light but
I'm afraid, my friend, we're outta time
We're outta time

So now I'm floating
 out to sea here in the open
In these cold waters, overboard
Just come and carry me home
Carry me home

As the night fades out the clouds
Deepest thought keep falling down, down
Heavy as the air we breathe
That chokes my words
But at least we know the night (We know the night will come)
Rises like it has to do, yeah
Still, it doesn't make it right
Or all seem true, oh

We deserve much better than this
Than all this nastiness
Can't master it like two passing ships
Sailing right beside
Hiding from the light but
I'm afraid, my friend, we're outta time
Sure outta time

So now I'm floating
 out to sea here in the open
In these cold waters, overboard
Just come and carry me home
Carry me home
Letting go
Drifting with the waves
'Cause I don't know
What to say to save it all
As it washes over me
We set it free

So now I'm floating (Floating)
 out to sea here in the open (Open)
In these cold waters, overboard (In these cold waters, oh)
Just come and carry me home (Carry me home)
Carry me home
So now I'm floating (Floating)
 out to sea here in the open (To sea)
In these cold waters, overboard
Just come and carry me home (In these cold waters)
