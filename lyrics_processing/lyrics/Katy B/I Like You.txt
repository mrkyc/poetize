Too many nights I stayed awake until the dawn
Since I've always got my mind and my heart torn
I touch a rose woke up myself up on the floor
But there's something I can feel when I'm with you
I recognise it, it's something so brand new
I can't help it, hope that you're feeling it too

I like you a little bit, yeah
I like you a little bit, more than I should
I like you a little bit, yeah
I like you a little bit, more than I should
I like you a little bit, yeah
I like you a little bit, more than I should
I like you a little bit, yeah
I like you a little bit, more than I should

You think I learned from all those times my heart was crushed
Paid a victim of that appetite, that lust
'Cause I want that feeling loving is that rush
Now I know why I really shouldn't play with fire
But with true love I should be so tired
But the way you move just fills me with desire
You might also like
I like you a little bit, yeah
I like you a little bit, more than I should
I like you a little bit, yeah
I like you a little bit, more than I should
I like you a little bit, yeah
I like you a little bit, more than I should
I like you a little bit, yeah
I like you a little bit, more than I should

I can't help it
Now you got a hold on me
I can't help it
You're taking control of me
I can't help it
Now you got a hold on me
I can't help it
You're taking control of me

I like you a little bit, yeah
I like you a little bit, more than I should
I like you a little bit, yeah
I like you a little bit, more than I should
I like you a little bit, yeah
I like you a little bit, more than I should
I like you a little bit, yeah
