When are we ever going to calm down
Know I should do, but I love the sound
All I really wanna do is dance
My lover, keeps asking when I'm gonna leave here get home
Now I'm far too caught up in the zone
All I really wanna do is dance

There's this thing that I feel called  joy when I free myself
Why would I want to toy with my soul, my wealth
Leave me alone now boy, by now can't you tell
All I really wanna do is (yeah)

Get down down, down down, down down, down down
Down down, down down, down down, down down
Down down, down down, down down, down down
Down down, down down, down down, down down

When are we ever going to calm down
Know I should do, but I love the sound
Higher than a bird of prey, I fly
See my lover's gon' be mad with me in the morning
See the day already dawning
Watch the colour's seep into the sky (sky)

Get down down, down down, down down, down down
Down down, down down, down down, down down
Down down, down down, down down, down down
Down down, down down, down down, down down

It's too late, it's taken all control now
(Taken all control of me)
It's too late, it's burrowed in my soul now
(Deep down, deep down)
Fills this space, without it I'm so hollow
(I'm so empty)
It's too late for thinking 'bout tomorrow
Ooh ooh ooh ooh

So keep calm (down down, down down, down down, down down)
So keep calm (down down, down down, down down, down down)
So keep calm (down down, down down, down down, down down)
So keep calm (down down, down down, down down, down down)
So keep calm (down down, down down, down down, down down)
So keep calm (down down, down down, down down, down down)
So keep calm (down down, down down, down down, down down)
So keep calm (down down, down down, down down, down down)
So keep calm (down down, down down, down down, down down)
So keep calm (down down, down down, down down, down down)
So keep calm (down down, down down, down down, down down)
