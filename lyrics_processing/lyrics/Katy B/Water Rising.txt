Is this here the moment, is this for the day
We lay it on the table, we're done, walk away
I can see the words there
Clinging to your tongue
Who's gon' say it first
Our world's no longer one
Feel a tug at my chest
No one said it would be easy saying goodbye
When you still know me best
So I just can't let you see me cry

Feel the water rising
I close my eyes and
Hold it back, better hold it down
Or the dam's gonna hit the ground
Oh, feel the water rising
I close my eyes and
Hold it back, better hold it down
Or the dam's gonna hit the ground
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Can't believe the time it took to realise
You're the cloud that darkened my halcyon skies
I used to be patient, I used to be kind
Now I'm just so empty, trying my best to find
How I was here before, when I had that naive faith in you, my friend
Now it's so past a cure, I can't let you see me weak again
You might also like
Feel the water rising
I close my eyes and
Hold it back, better hold it down
Or the dam's gonna hit the ground
Oh, feel the water rising
I close my eyes and
Hold it back, better hold it down
Or the dam's gonna hit the ground
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
You cut my wings so I can't fly
You saw my pain but walked on by
Till that last light in me died
Had me wishing on stars
You pulled my strings to get your way
But in the end pushed me away
So now we live in yesterday
Cause it all went too far

Feel the water rising
I close my eyes and
Hold it back, better hold it down
Or the dam's gonna hit the ground
Oh, feel the water rising
I close my eyes and
Hold it back, better hold it down
Or the dam's gonna hit the ground
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
