Something 'bout your vibe
I know I can trust you somehow
Dreaming's got me wild
High on thoughts of you, won't come down
When you ask my name
Every word was gentle had me
Down to play your game
Down to give my soul so gladly

What is on your mind?
Now you've got me here, make your move
Please, don't take your time (please, don't take your time)
All that talk, it's now time to prove
Darling, just lean in
I am sure you'll want to taste this
Honey on my skin (honey on my skin)
I'm sure you won't want to waste it

Taste it baby, taste it baby, oh oh
Taste it baby, taste it baby, oh oh
Kiss it baby, kiss it baby, oh oh
Kiss it baby, kiss it baby, oh oh
You might also like
I can see your truth
I can see the life reflecting
This is overdue
Only cause you keep respecting
Everything I do
But to keep it real I'm ready
I'm ready for you
Take me to that state so heady

What is on your mind?
Now you've got me here, make your move
Please, don't take your time (please, don't take your time)
All that talk, it's now time to prove
Darling, just lean in
I am sure you'll want to taste this
Honey on my skin (honey on my skin)
I'm sure you won't want to waste it

Taste it baby, taste it baby, oh oh
Taste it baby, taste it baby, oh oh
Kiss it baby, kiss it baby, oh oh
Kiss it baby, kiss it baby, oh oh
Waiting for your kiss, red veinous lips
I bought this colour for you
On my lunch today I heard her say
Girl he'd be crazy not to
Maybe you're too shy, I wonder why
The air feels so suspended
I move closer in, let us begin
Or we will sure regret it

What is on your mind? (what is on your mind?)
Now you've got me here, make your move
(now you've got me here, make your move)
Please, don't take your time (please, don't take your time)
All that talk, it's now time to prove
Darling just lean in (darling just lean in)
I am sure you'll want to taste this (you'll want to taste this baby)
Honey on my skin (honey on my skin, honey yeah)
I'm sure you won't want to waste it (you won't want to waste it)

Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Yeah yeah yeah
Oh baby
Oh waiting for you to, to be here
Taste it, taste the honey baby
