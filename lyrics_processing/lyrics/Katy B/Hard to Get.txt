Why you playin' hard to get
Or do you know me inside out
No challenge, I haven't won yet see
Keep playin' in vain but I'll figure you out
It won't be long till I've got you in my grasp

Fear is what this must be, I won't hurt you, no, no
Just trust me and I'll be here for you

Why don't you open up
Come a bit closer to me
I wanna show you exactly what we could be
Why don't you open up
Come a bit closer to me
I wanna show you exactly what we could be
Why don't you open up to me, baby
I want to show you exactly what we could be
Why don't you open up to me, baby
See, I want to show you exactly what we could be

Don't know what it is about you
That makes me focussed
I need to get my way so don't obstruct it
Now why you're being difficult
Don't think I can't read you
I see the way you think and I like it
You might also like
Fear is what this must be, I won't hurt you, no, no
Just trust me and I'll be here for you

Why don't you open up
Come a bit closer to me
I wanna show you exactly what we could be
Why don't you open up
Come a bit closer to me
I wanna show you exactly what we could be

Oh, darling, why won't you come closer, come closer?
I wanna show you, I wanna show you
Why don't you open up to, open up to me?
I want to show you, I want to show you
Please, oh, baby, please
Oh baby, why you playin' hard to get with me?
I will keep on waitin' till you don't
I want to show you

Now, let me introduce you to all the people who made this possible
First of all, big up my mum, my dad, my brother, and my Auntie Glo for always supporting me and pushing me to do what I love in life and be happy
Second of all, big up to G and Sarah for believing in me and taking a big gamble on having next-level ideas and a ridiculous passion for real music
Also, big up Zinc, Geeneus, Benga, Skream, Artwork, and Benny Ill for all your bad boy productions and also Ms. Dynamite for blessing Lights On
Much love to Rekta, Jamie, Jade, and Scratcha and all at Rinse
Big up Rinse FM (Rinse FM) and all other pirate radio stations
Also every DJ who played my tunes, especially the ones back in the day
And much, much love to all my friends who I've been raving with for the past four years, I love you
And finally, thank you to everyone who's listening to this album right now, joining me on my mission
