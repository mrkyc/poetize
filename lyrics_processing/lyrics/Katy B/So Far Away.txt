You, you give me such a good feeling
You, you give me just what I'm needing
I, I get this crazy sensation
When, it's just you and I, it's just you

We're so far away from
Everything and everyone, baby
We're so far away from
All the stresses of the world now
We're so far away from
Everything and everyone, baby
We're so far away, so
Don't you go stoppin' your love now

We're so
We're so far away
We're so
We're so far away
We're so
We're so far away
We're so

I, I used to keep my heart guarded
We, don't know now just what we've started
You, you push me high to the heavens
When, it's just you and I, it's just you
You might also like
We're so far away from
Everything and everyone, baby
We're so far away from
All the stresses of the world now
We're so far away from
Everything and everyone, baby
We're so far away, so
Don't you go stoppin' your love now

We're so
We're so far away
We're so
We're so far away
We're so
We're so far away
We're so

So hold me, feel me, touch me, keep me warm
Tonight, something within me is reborn
Hold me, feel me, touch me, keep me warm
It's just you and I, it's just you
Hold me, feel me, touch me, keep me warm
Tonight, something within me is reborn
Hold me, feel me, touch me, keep me warm
It's just you and I, it's just you
From all the madness
From all the sadness
From all our troubles
We're so far away
We're so far away
We're so far away
We're so far away
So pull me closer
We're so far away
So far away

We're so far away from
Everything and everyone, baby
We're so far away from
All the stresses of the world now
We're so far away from
Everything and everyone, baby
We're so far away, so
Don't you go stoppin' your love now

We're so
We're so far away
We're so
We're so far away
We're so
We're so far away
