Cause we're hot like fire
And we're cool like rain
It can't get much higher
You need to feel the same

Cause I'm chasing the first things you gave to me
Can't quit, even if, if I wanted to (no)
Even if I wanted to (no)
Even if I wanted to (no)
Even if I wanted to (no)
Even if I wanted to (no)
Even if I wanted to (no)

Cause we're hot like fire
And we're cool like rain
It can't get much higher
You need to feel the same
Cause we're hot like fire
I can't say goodbye
Even if I wanted to (no)
Even if I wanted to

I'm feeling a fever
And it feels so good
What I gotta do to make you stay?
Oh how I wish that you had
You might also like
Cause I'm chasing the first time you supplied that
Good shit, can't quit, even if I wanted to (no)
Even if I wanted to (no)
Even if I wanted to (no)
Even if I wanted to (no)
Even if I wanted to (no)
Even if I wanted to (no)

Cause we're hot like fire
And we're cool like rain
It can't get much higher
You need to feel the same
Cause we're hot like fire
I can't say goodbye
Even if I wanted to (no)
Even if I wanted to
Even if I wanted to (no)
Even if I wanted to
Even if I wanted to (no)
Even if I wanted to

See it glow, our love in the night
See it burn, burning so bright
See the flame, only you can get burned
But you burn, we'll be burning so bright
See it glow, our love in the night
See it burn, burning so bright
See the flame, only you can get burned
But you burn, we'll be burning so bright
Cause we're hot like fire
Watch me burn, oh baby
Cause we're hot like fire
