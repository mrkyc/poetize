Come out, Virginia, don't let me wait
You Catholic girls start much too late
Aww, but sooner or later, it comes down to fate
I might as well be the one
Well, they showed you a statue, told you to pray
They built you a temple and locked you away
Aww, but they never told you the price that you pay
For things that you might have done

Well, only the good die young
That's what I said
Only the good die young
Only the good die young

You mighta heard I run with a dangerous crowd
We ain't too pretty, we ain't too proud
We might be laughing a bit too loud
Aww, but that never hurt no one
So come on, Virginia, show me a sign
Send up a signal, I'll throw you the line
The stained glass curtain you're hidin' behind
Never lets in the sun
Darlin', only the good die young
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah
I tell ya, only the good die young
Only the good die young

You got a nice white dress and a party on your confirmation
You got a brand new soul
Mmm, and a cross of gold
But Virginia, they didn't give you quite enough information
You didn't count on me
When you were counting on your rosary
Oh woah woah

And they say there's a heaven for those who will wait
And some say it's better, but I say it ain't
I'd rather laugh with the sinners than cry with the saints
The sinners are much more fun

You know that only the good die young
Oh-oh-ho, baby
I tell ya, only the good die young
Only the good die young

You said your mother told you, "All that I could give you was a reputation"
Aww, she never cared for me
But did she ever say a prayer for me?
Oh woah woah

Well, come out, come out, come out, Virginia, don't let me wait
You Catholic girls start much too late
But sooner or later, it comes down to fate
I might as well be the one

You know that only the good die young
Tell you, baby
You know that only the good die young
Only the good die young
Only the good
Only the good die young

Ooh-ooh-hoo, ooh-hoo
Ooh-ooh-hoo, hoo, ooh-hoo
Ooh-ooh-hoo, ooh-ooh-hoo
Ooh-ooh-hoo, hoo, ooh-hoo
Ooh-ooh-hoo, ooh-hoo
Ooh-ooh-hoo, hoo, ooh-hoo
Only the good die young
