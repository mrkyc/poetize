In my mind, I always thought I was a different kind
'Cause back in time I used to think that everyone was blind
They always call me as a loser - zero
When I look into the mirror there's a superhero
People thought that I would never amount to anything
Dream away the thing my thoughts were different then
Never could express myself to differ words right
But I'm a different man when day turns to night

You think I'm crazy, that I've lost my senses
The world finally will finally learn the truth

You, you wouldn't understand
'Cause you don't know who I am
I'm the wonderman
I'm gonna prove them wrong
I'm gonna take a stand
I'm the wonderman

Kind of shy, kind of timid, not a go-getter
Every night I roam the streets try to make it better
Hate slow me up I never was bitter
Always fighting for what's right, but I'm not a quitter
When you step into my world you might not understand
Everybody's acting crazy, getting out of hand
I might bend the law a bit, but I will not break it
Just make it easy for the underdogs that take it
You might also like
You think I'm crazy, that I've lost my senses
The world finally will finally learn the truth

You, you wouldn't understand
'Cause you don't know who I am
I'm the wonderman
I'm gonna prove them wrong
I'm gonna take a stand
I'm the wonderman

This my, my story, I'm not out of glory
This my, my story, I'm not out of glory
This my, my story, I'm not out of glory
This my, my story, I'm not out of glory
This my, my story, I'm not out of glory
This my, my story, I'm not out of glory

You, you wouldn't understand
'Cause you don't know who I am
I'm the wonderman
I'm gonna prove them wrong
I'm gonna take a stand
