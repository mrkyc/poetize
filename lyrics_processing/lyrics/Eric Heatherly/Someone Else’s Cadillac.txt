To win her love is nothing I wouldn't do
Talking to her all would seem would give her a thrill
Fleet woods, Eldorado's and Coop-Davilles
Well, I might have stretched the truth just a tiny bit
When I told her that I had one with a Continental Kit
Yeah, well I don't steal but I've been known to borrow
Yeah, tonight we've been rolling like there's no tomorrow
She's cuddling up close rubbing my back
Doing a little this doing a little that
I'm sure gonna hate to sneak it back
But we've been riding 'round in someone else's Cadillac
I got my uncle Willys watch and my daddies money clip
My cousin Bubbas black boots with a golden silver tips
Yeah, she's purring like a kitten I'm the cats meow
I'm gonna trade a weeks pay for a night on the town
Well, how could I tell her what she don't know
When she's sitting here thinking I'm a king of the road
Yeah, well I don't steal but I've been know to borrow
Yeah, tonight we've been rolling like there's no tomorrow
She's cuddling up close rubbing my back
Doing a little this, doing a little that
I'm sure gonna hate to have to sneak it back
But we've been riding 'round in someone else's Cadillac
You might also likeCome on, baby
We were in the back seat parked under the stars
When I saw the blue lights of that police car
Yeah, well officer know I don't steal but I've been known to borrow
Yeah, tonight we've been rolling like there's no tomorrow
Now can you find it in your heart to cut me some slack
I admit it ain't mine sir, that's a fact
But I was gonna take her home and then sneak it on back
