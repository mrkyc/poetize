Hollywood whore, passed out on the floor
I'm sorry, but the party's over

Cocaine nose and trendy clothes
Gotta send her to rehab
She found out she's got no soul
But it really doesn't bother her
White trash queen, American dream
Oh, what a role model
Throwing a fit, making a scene
Like no tomorrow

Hollywood whore, passed out on the floor
Can't take it no more
I'm sorry, but the party's over
The talk of the town is she's goin' down
I'm sorry, but the party's over now

Awake by noon, drunk by 4:00
Sucked up in the showbiz
You're so lame, you're such a bore
I wanna kick your teeth in
Plastic smile to match your style
We can tell ya got a facelift
You're so vain, oh-so vile
You're a number one hit

Hollywood whore, passed out on the floor
Can't take it no more
I'm sorry, but the party's over
The talk of the town is she's goin' down
I'm sorry, but the party's over now

The cameras are gone, and nobody screams
She couldn't survive her 15 minutes of fame
Her friends are all gone; she's going insane
She'll never survive without the money and fame
It's all going down the drain
(Down the drain, down the drain, down the drain...)

Hollywood whore, passed out on the floor
Can't take it no more
I'm sorry, but the party's over
The talk of the town is she's goin' down
I'm sorry, but the party's over now
Hollywood whore, passed out on the floor
Can't take it no more
I'm sorry, but the party's over
The talk of the town is she's goin' down
I'm sorry, but the party's over now
Wake up, the party's over
Wake up, the party's over
Wake up, the party's over
Wake up, the party's over
Don't let the door hit ya
