When I see her eyes
Look into my eyes
Then I realize that
She could see inside my head
So I close my eyes
Thinking that I could hide
Disassociate so I don't have to lose my head
This situation leads to agitation
Will she cut me off?
Will this be an amputation?

I don't know if I care
I'm the jerk
Life's not fair
Fighting all the time
This is out of line
She loves me not
Loves me not
Do you realize I won't compromise
She loves me not
Loves me not

Over the past five years
I have shed my tears
I have drank my beers and watched my fears fly away
And until this day
She still swings my way
But it's sad to say sometimes
She says she loves me not
But I hesitate
To tell her I hate
This relationship
I want out today
This is over

I don't know if I care
I'm the jerk
Life's not fair
Fighting all the time
This is out of line
She loves me not
Loves me not
Do you realize I won't compromise
She loves me not
Loves me not
Life's not fair
I'm the jerk

Line for line
Rhyme for rhyme
Sometimes we be fighting all the goddamn time -it's making me sick
Relationship is getting ill
Piss drunk stupid
Mad
On the real
Could you feel what I feel
What's the deal girl?
Tearing up each other's world
We should be in harmony
Boy and girl
That is the promise we made
Back in the day
We told each other things wouldn't be this way
I think we should work this out
It's all right baby we can scream and shout
I don't know if I care
I'm the jerk
Life's not fair
Fighting all the time
This is out of line
She loves me not
Loves me not
Do you realize I won't compromise
She loves me not
Loves me not
Life's not fair
Life's not fair
Life's not fair
I'm the jerk
Life's not fair

She loves me not
