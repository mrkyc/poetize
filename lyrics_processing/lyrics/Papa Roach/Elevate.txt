Whoa, lift me higher
Whoa, when I get down
Whoa, lift me higher
Whoa

I swear to God that it might just be the death of me
Just count the reasons why I'm crazy, yeah, it's stressing me
I'm burning pictures of myself like it could set me free
But I can't stop because I gotta reach my destiny, like hey, whoa
I was dead, now I'm living because I made my decision
No, I will not be a victim, and I'm like "Hey, whoa"
No, I don't need permission to elevate with precision
I'm 'bout to break through the ceiling

'Cause I need something to lift me up when I'm down
I get lost in my head for so long, I can't get out
When I'm feeling like I'm crawling in my skin and sinking down
I need something to lift me up

I wanna elevate
Elevate
Watch me elevate
Whoa, lift me higher
Whoa, when I get down
Whoa, lift me higher
Whoa, watch me elevate

I know they say that the best is always yet to come
But nothing happens, I can't sit and wait until I'm numb
I get that feeling in my soul, then I cut and run
'Cause I can't take another second, watch me elevate, like hey, whoa
Yeah, I'm taking this vision, my God, body has risen
No, I can't stop with this rhythm, and I'm like "Hey, whoa"
No, my mind ain't a prison, I won't succumb to these villains
They keep attacking my feelings

I need something to lift me up when I'm down
I get lost in my head for so long, I can't get out
When I'm feeling like I'm crawling in my skin and sinking down
I need something to lift me up

I wanna elevate
Elevate
Watch me elevate like hey, whoa
Whoa, lift me higher
Whoa, when I get down, elevate
Whoa, lift me higher
