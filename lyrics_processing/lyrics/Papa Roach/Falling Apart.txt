I'll follow you out of the dark
I tried it my way, but I keep fallin' apart

All that I see
Is the wickedness around me
I refuse to believe
The apocalypse inside of me
I can't even trust myself
I'm burning in my skin
Standing at the gates of hell
But nobody will let me in

I'll follow you out of the dark
I tried it my way, but I keep fallin' apart
I'll follow you with all of my heart
I'm tired of my ways 'cause I keep fallin'
I'm fallin' apart

I stand here again
Forsaken in a place that feels like
I can never win
I'm reaching for a saving grace
I can't even trust no one
I need to rise above
I don't think I'm good enough
To feel your perfect love

I'll follow you out of the dark
I tried it my way, but I keep fallin' apart
I'll follow you with all of my heart
I'm tired of my ways 'cause I keep fallin'
I'm fallin' apart

I'm fallin', I'm fallin' apart
I'm fallin', I'm fallin' apart
I'm fallin' apart

Your love's a fire
It's alive, and I'm burning in it
I'm in the ashes of mercy
I'm covered in it
I fall hard, and you carry me
I fall apart so you can set me free
Your love's a fire
It's alive, and I'm burning in it
I'm in the ashes of mercy
I'm covered in it
I fall hard, and you carry me
I fall apart so you can set me free
I'll follow you out of the dark
I tried it my way, but I keep fallin' apart
I'll follow you with all of my heart
I'm tired of my ways 'cause I keep fallin'
I'm fallin' apart

I'm fallin', I'm fallin' apart
Without you, I'm fallin', I'm fallin' apart
