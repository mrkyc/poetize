I was screwed up
I was angry at the world
I felt like I was a loser
I had a chip on my shoulder then
In a low place
Wishing I was anywhere else but there
On a California highway
I was broke, but I always had time to spare

You know, hard times always come easy
But they never last long
If you feel alone when you're down, just know
You're not the only one
You know, hard times always come easy
But they never last long
If you feel alone when you're down, just know
You're not the only one

You're not the only one
You're not the only one
Uh, I used to wanna run away, back when I was young
Couldn't wait to go a couple times around the sun
Now I wish that I could take it back
When the only thing we cared about was nothing, and I'm not the only one

Yeah, I got demons
But so does everybody else
When it's cold, we turn the heat up
Just to feel what it's like in hell
Tired of everybody preaching
That ain't doing shit for themselves
Talking to me like I need it
Maybe 'cause I said that I needed help

You know, hard times always come easy
But they never last long
If you feel alone when you're down, just know
You're not the only one
You know, hard times always come easy
But they never last long
If you feel alone when you're down, just know
You're not the only one

You're not the only one
You're not the only one
Uh, I used to wanna run away, back when I was young
Couldn't wait to go a couple times around the sun
Now I wish that I could take it back
When the only thing we cared about was nothing, and I'm not the only one
Not the only one
Not the only one
Not the only one
Oh, you're not the

You're not the only one
You're not the only one
You're not the
You're not the only one (You're not the)
You're not the only one (You're not the)
