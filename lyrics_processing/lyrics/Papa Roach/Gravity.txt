I was there on
The day truth died
Blood on my hands
Throw 'em up in the sky
I was the
Number one sinner, no less
My life was a lie
And my wish was a death
I fell in love
With the ways of the world
Money and the fame
The booze and the girls
But I couldn't stay
Faithful if I tried
I'd turn in to a devil
You could see it in my eyes
I blacked out
Told you everything I ever did
I couldn't take
All the lies I was living with
I broke your heart
Broke up the next day
My bags outside
Yelling, "Get the hell away

Not a father, just a pig
And you can't never change
Al the things that you did"
That's when I knew it
It wouldn't last
You'll never get away
When you're running from the past

And we fly...
Fly into outer space
We'll float away...
I float away, but you're my gravity
And we die...
Die to love another day
We rise again...
We rise again and lose our gravity

I'm a broken man
I'm full of sin
I'm sick of all this hell
That I'm livin' in
And I can't escape it
This is how it feels
When you try to numb the pain
With a thousand pills
You tore me down
And wished that I was dead
Said, "You wanna sleep alone
In another bed"
But when I push away
You only pull me closer
It's only over
When we both wanna say it's over
I gotta change
This is not who I am
I wanna start over
Wanna try this again
You're everything I need
Everything I'm not
So, pull the trigger
Give me one more shot
And we fly...
Fly into outer space
We'll float away...
I float away, but you're my gravity
And we die...
Die to love another day
We rise again...
We rise again and lose our gravity

You love me, you hate me
You kiss me, you break me
You lifted me up
Just to watch as you broke me
You promised me
Looked me straight in the eyes
No matter what you say
I don't know truth from the lies
I held you up
Like I always do
I forgave you for your sins
And I carried you through
No matter how hard we fall
We always knew
You will bleed for me
And I will bleed for you
We fly into outer space
I float away, but you're my gravity (Maybe we can float away)
Die to love another day (We can rise again)
We rise again and lose our gravity

And we fly...
Fly into outer space
We'll float away...
I float away, but you're my gravity
And we die...
Die to love another day
We rise again...
We rise again and lose our gravity
Fly!
Fly into outer space
We'll float away...
I float away, but you're my gravity
And we die...
Die to love another day
We rise again...
We rise again and lose our gravity
