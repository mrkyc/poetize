Sick and tired of the bottom, need a better view
Got me looking 'round my circle, is it bulletproof?
Sometimes I think until I go insane
Can I even trust somebody with the same last name? Uh
Times are crazy, people running from the light, ah
Bad decisions, they can come around and bite ya
Wish I could worry just a little less
Wish I could quiet all the noise up inside my head

When it's over, it's over, it's over
It's over

I'm watching all the moves you make
Can't turn back now, it's too late
Checkmate, there's no defending
This is the start of the ending
I'm counting all of your mistakes
Caught up in a crossfire hurricane
Checkmate, there's no defending
This is the start of the ending
This is the start of the ending

I admit it took a second, but I realized
I been looking for a reason just to sever ties
Only seeing what I wanna see
Got me questioning the things that I started to believe
Paranoid from the trauma in my life, uh
Trust issues make it hard to sleep at night, uh
Wish I could worry just a little less
Wish I could quiet all the noise up inside my head
