I push you away until you beg me to stay
Just for the thrill of the chase, you got me
Fucked in the head from all the things that we did
But I will never forget I need you, my medication

Have you ever had enough of it?
Straight over it, sick of it, can't get ahold of it?
Like a drug I need another fix
I'm a moth to a flame and I'll burn for the hell of it
Battle scar 'cause I lost the fight
Every time I take a breath it's like I'm losin' my life
Fuck it, why am I so dysfunctional? So irrational?
I don't know what to do

So I push you away until you beg me to stay
Just for the thrill of the chase, you got me intoxicated
Fucked in the head from all the things that we did
But I will never forget I need you, my medication

Are you living with the enemy?
Are you affected by the devils that are tryna be a friend to me?
I'm in a place that I don't wanna be
But if I find a way to turn it all around would you follow me?
I'm alive but I lost the fight
It's like the better half of me is on the edge of the knife
Cut it, why am I so emotional? Uncontrollable?
I don't know what to do
