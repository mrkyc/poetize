I got my back to the wall and now I'm slippin'
Been tryna deal with the thoughts and my condition
And still I try to hang on to what I'm missing
But something's settin' me off, somebody listen
I been runnin' from fate without a lifeline
But now I'm in the wrong place at the wrong time
Tryna find an escape, lookin' to get by
From never gettin' a break, cuttin' the brake line

I've been hangin' by a thread
With my feet over the edge
Got my back against the wall
Will this nightmare ever end?
Will I break before I bend?
If I slip and lose it all, nothing's gonna break the fall
If I lose it all, nothing's gonna break the fall

I got my head in the game I'm on a mission
But every day is the same, a demolition
We are the marginalized but not the victims
Fighting the fight of our lives to make you listen
You got me losin' my breath it's been a long run
I'm tryin' hard to forget, but I know the outcome
I got a thousand regrets, and now I'm on one
I might be losing my head before the song's done

I've been hangin' by a thread
With my feet over the edge
Got my back against the wall
Will this nightmare ever end?
Will I break before I bend?
If I slip and lose it all, nothing's gonna break the fall

Gotta get my head together, my head together
I been tryna keep my head together
Beat down
Gotta get my head together, my head together
I been tryna keep my head together
A beat down
Gotta get my head together, my head together
I been tryna keep my head together
A beat down
Gotta get my head together, my head together
I been tryna keep my head together
A beat down

I've been hangin' by a thread
With my feet over the edge
Got my back against the wall
Will this nightmare ever end?
Will I break before I bend?
If I slip and lose it all, nothing's gonna break the fall
Break the fall
