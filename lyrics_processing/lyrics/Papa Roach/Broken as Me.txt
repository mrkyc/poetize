You're just as broken as me

Shut your mouth
'Cause I can see through the lies
We're only getting sicker
From the secrets we hide
Disaster is our master
As we lie here burning in bed
But something tells me
I cannot give up on you yet

I will not give up on you today

I will forgive and forget
'Cause I know that it will set me free
But all that's left
Is the emptiness inside of me
You murdered my heart
Broke my trust and watched me fade away
Now I see, now I see
That you're just as broken as me

You're just as broken as me

You always play the victim
And you just can't decide
If the vicious way we loved each other
Fucked up our lives
When we're standing in the aftermath
Our emptiness is what's left
And if you really loved me
Will you love me to death?

I will love you until the end

I will forgive and forget
'Cause I know that it will set me free
But all that's left is
The emptiness inside of me
You murdered my heart
Broke my trust and watched me fade away
Now I see, now I see
That you're just as broken as me
You're just as broken as me!
I've been a slave
You've been a slave
I've been a slave
To the hatred in you, in me
I see you're just as broken as me

I will forgive and forget
'Cause I know that it will set me free
But all that's left is
The emptiness inside of me
You murdered my heart
Broke my trust and watched me fade away
Now I see, now I see
That you're just as broken as me
You're just as broken as me

You're just as broken as me...
