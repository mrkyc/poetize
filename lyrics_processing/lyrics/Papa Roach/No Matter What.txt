I need you right here, by my side
You are everything I am not in my life
We are indestructible, we are untouchable
Nothing can take us down tonight
You are so beautiful, it should be criminal
That you could be mine

And we will make it out alive
I will promise you this love will never die!

No matter what, I got your back
I will take a bullet for you if it comes to that
I swear to god, that in the bitter end
We are going to be the last ones standing

So believe me when I say, you are the one
They will never forgive us for the things we have done

And we will make it out alive
I will promise you this love will never die!

No matter what, I got your back
I will take a bullet for you if it comes to that
I swear to God that in the bitter end
We are going to be the last ones standing

We will never fall, we will never fade
I will promise you forever and my soul today
No matter what until the bitter end
We are going to be the last ones standing

And everybody said that we would never last
And if they saw us now I bet they would take it back
It does not matter what we do or what we say
Cause nothing matters anyway!

No matter what, I got your back
I will take a bullet for you if it comes to that
I swear to God that in the bitter end
We are going to be the last ones standing
We will never fall (We will never fall)
We will never fade (We will never fade)
No matter what until the bitter end
