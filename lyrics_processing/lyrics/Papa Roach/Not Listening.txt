I'm not listening, not anymore
The more I learn, the more I ignore
I'm not listening, not anymore
The more I hear, the more I ignore
I'm not listening anymore, no

'Cause you got to be bigger, be faster, be stronger
If you're gonna survive any longer
In this lifetime, it better be the right time
The first time might be your last time
Am I a failure if I got nothing to lose?
No, I'm not a failure, I got something to prove!

I'm not listening, not anymore
The more I learn, the more I ignore
I'm not listening, not anymore
The more I hear, the more I ignore
The more I ignore

'Cause I've lost my innocence
And I'm a stranger, a life changer
I'm a man that's not afraid of danger
I walk my own path and blaze my own trail
'Cause I'm not afraid to derail
I won't get in line or be a middleman
So fuck you, I'll make my own plan
And I got respect and I don't neglect
The people that I really care to protect
Am I a failure if I got nothing to lose?
No, I'm not a failure, I got something to prove
