There's no money, there's no possessions, only obsession
I don't need that shit
Take my money, take my obsession

I just wanna be heard, loud and clear are my words
Comin' from within, man, tell 'em what you heard
It's about a revolution
In your heart and in your mind, you can find the conclusion
Lifestyle and obsession
Diamond rings get you nothin' but a lifelong lesson
And your pocketbook stressin'
You're a slave to the system, workin' jobs that you hate
For that shit you don't need
It's too bad the world is based on greed
Step back and see
Stop thinkin' 'bout yourself, start thinkin' 'bout

There's no money, there's no possession, only obsession
I don't need that shit
Take my money, take my possession, take my obsession
I don't need that shit

'Cause everything is nothing, and emptiness is in everything
This reality is really just a fucked up dream
With the flesh and the blood that you call your soul
Flip it inside out, it's a big black hole
Take your money, burn it up like an asteroid
Possessions, they are never gonna fill the void
Take it away and learn the best lesson
The heart, the soul, the life, the passion

There's no money, there's no possession, only obsession
I don't need that shit
Take my money, take my possession, take my obsession
I don't need that shit

Money, possession, obsession

Present yourself, press your clothes
Comb your hair, clock in
You just can't win, just can't win
And the things you own, own you
No!

Take my money, take my possession, take my obsession
I don't need that shit
Fuck your money, fuck your possession, fuck your obsession
I don't need that shit

Money, possession, obsession
