All the walls coming down around me

I know that I'm fucked up and infected
I've been hiding in the fear, rejected
Thank God that you finally found me
'Cause you gotta get me outta here
I've been sick and disconnected
I've been loving like I've been neglected
All the walls coming down around me
And you gotta get me outta here

I can't take any more...

I don't wanna breathe
I don't wanna die
I can't feel; I'm paralyzed
I'm not taking this tonight
Give me back my life
I can't breathe; I can't fight
I wanna feel like I'm alive
I'm not taking this tonight
Give me back my life

I know I'm a walking contradiction
I'm the truth that you wish was fiction
And this heart isn't known to hate me
I just want to disappear
I've been on a self-inflicted mission
To destroy everything I'm given
Thank God that you finally found me
'Cause you got to get me out of here

I can't take any more...

I don't wanna breathe
I don't wanna die
I can't feel; I'm paralyzed
I'm not taking this tonight
Give me back my life
I can't breathe; I can't fight
I wanna feel like I'm alive
I'm not taking this tonight
Give me back my life

You took my pride
You took control
There's nothing sacred anymore
Give back what's mine
Give back my soul
I don't wanna breathe
But I don't wanna die

I don't wanna breathe
I don't wanna die
I can't feel; I'm paralyzed
I'm not taking this tonight
Give me back my life
I can't breathe; I can't fight
I wanna feel like I'm alive
I'm not taking this tonight
Give me back my
I don't wanna breathe
I don't wanna die
I can't feel; I'm paralyzed
I'm not taking this tonight
Give me back my life
I can't breathe; I can't fight
I wanna feel like I'm alive
I'm not taking this tonight
