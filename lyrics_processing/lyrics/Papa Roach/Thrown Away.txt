I am a mess
I've made a huge mess
I can't control myself

I kill the rhyme again, I'm coming sick and on time again
Words manifest from deep inside where people hide within
It's chemical imbalance on the triple beam, what?
Fuck what ya heard, It's about what I seen
I seen it happen, back hand brand to face smacking
Definite disorder, now his mindset is blackened
The doctors say, "he's got the brain of a murderer"
This rugged style steals your brain

My heart is bleeding and this pain, it will not pass
It's not receding and my body's going numb
A bad trip child, rolling stoned, keeping high
He don't know what he's doing, he just keeps getting by

Thrown away
I want to be
Thrown away

He's born sick, nothing in his hands but his dick
He couldn't handle pressure, he couldn't handle shit
For the life he was leading lead him down the wrong path
Where guns blast, don't give a shit about the God's wrath
Don't want to talk to the counselor, doctor
Tell them what's real, to tell them what's proper
Situation unclear, I pray, and I know it gets worse everyday

My heart is bleeding and this pain, it will not pass
It's not receding and my body's going numb
A bad trip child, rolling stoned, keeping high
He don't know what he's doing, he just keeps getting by, away

Thrown away
I want to be
Thrown away

I am a mess
I've made a huge mess
I can't control myself
I'm losing it
I've lost it
I've spilled all my marbles
'Cause I see you inside of me
Sometimes I want to be thrown away
'Cause I see you inside of me
Sometimes I want to be thrown away
A hyper spaz, and that is me
Sometimes I want to be thrown away

Thrown away
Thrown away
Thrown away
Thrown away
Thrown away
Thrown away
Thrown away
Thrown away
(Voices in my head)
(Voices in my head)
Don't tell me
To do it, 'cause I will (Voices in my head)
Now
(Voices in my head)
Don't tell me
To do it, 'cause I will (Voices in my head)
Now
(Voices in my head)
They're screaming
They're screaming
