And we couldn't get along so it got in the way
I'll give you the spin and you couldn't even talk
But you never give in
Yeah I can fight with the best of them
And we've gone a few rounds and I shed a new light
And I counted to ten but it didn't seem to matter
You just wanted to win
I won't let you drag me in
I know you enjoy the pain
Oh you won't feel anything
Well I don't play that way
It's a sure bet
The last thing you're ever gonna to hear from me
Are my footsteps as I walk away (I walk away)
Oh you've tried everything
To keep me coming back
Oh but I'm spent as I walk away (I walk away)
One thing's for sure last thing you're
Ever gonna hear from me
Are my footsteps as I walk away
You love to fight and I couldn't get through
And your blood is running hot makes you feel alive
In everything you do and you want it that way
I can't abide by you
Look at the time I guess it went to waste
But I'm good to go I gotta toe the line
I'll make mistakes but I still got a chance
I'm gonna take
You might also likeEverything you said
Is like a kick in the head
Don't count me out just yet
Place your money here instead
It's a sure bet
The last thing you're ever gonna to hear from me
Are my footsteps as I walk away (I walk away)
Oh you've tried everything
To keep me coming back
Oh but I'm spent as I walk away (I walk away)
One thing's for sure last thing you're
Ever gonna hear from me
Are my footsteps as I walk away
Can't even tell me that you want me
But this time it's just all right
Something that you'll face in the morning
But baby if you want when I close this door
I'll leave on the light
It's a sure bet
The last thing you're ever gonna to hear from me
Are my footsteps as I walk away (I walk away)
Oh you've tried everything
To keep me coming back
Oh but I'm spent as I walk away (I walk away)
I walk away, yeah yeah
I walk away, yeah, yeah, yeah
