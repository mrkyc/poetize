Out the door, you got no time for coffee
And I'm standing here remembering when my kisses made you late
Gonna take a minute for my morning meditation
But I'm on the phone call waiting click some under an invasion
And I feel like I'm a spinning ball in a lottery cage
If we aren't making love how can we be lovers?
Gonna post a vacancy sign under the covers
Before it gets too late
I'm gonna say
Ooh, stop what you're doing and love me now
Ooh, I'm making my move, come on and love me now
I come home so tired just wanna put my feet up
You watch Letterman and eat something old I heat up
Then we both fall asleep before the rooster starts to crow
No time to fight we pretend love is so sweet
When all we're missing is what's between the sheets
We used to find an hour between start and go
Whatever happened to staying up all night?
When the bed became our island and it was just you and I
Our troubles would slip away when we said
You might also likeOoh, stop what you're doing and love me now
Ooh, I'm making my move, come on and love me now
Time, time
Time, time, time
Are we meating the time?
Just you and I, magic ride
Yeah
Yeah
If we aren't making love how can we be lovers?
Gonna post a vacancy sign under the covers
Before it gets too late
Hmm, I'm gonna say
Ooh, stop what you're doing and love me now
Ooh, I'm making my move, come on and love me now
Ooh, stop what you're doing and love me now
Ooh, I'm making my move, come on and love me now
Ooh, stop what you're doing and love me now
