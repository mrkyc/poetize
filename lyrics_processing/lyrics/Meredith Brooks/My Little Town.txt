All the sirens scream
I don't drive my car
Insurance is too high
I live here in the city
My hometown's far away
I workout with concrete
I don't drive my car
The stars come out at night
You see them on the strip
Everybody arms themselves
There's no other place like this
I'll never leave this
Small town girl behind
The place where I come from
Is with me all the time
Oh, you could walk the streets
When the sun goes down
In my little town
You don't need defenses
When the sun goes down
In my little town
You might also likeBack home on the street
After 10 at night
Mrs. Avery walks her dog
Checks to see what's going on
She doesn't lock the door
She lives here in good health
You don't hear the horn
When Mrs. Avery walks her dog
All I ever wanted
Was a view of city lights
Break away from here
Leave behind the quiet nights
Spend half your life
Trying to make a change
Then the other half
Trying to get back again
Oh, you could walk the streets
When the sun goes down
In my little town
You don't need defenses
When the sun goes down
In my little town
Look down the road
Look at the highway
Look past the fences
Look at the faces
What do you have on the other side?
Oh, you could walk the streets
When the sun goes down
In my little town
You don't need defenses
When the sun goes down
In my my town
You could walk the streets
When the sun goes down
In my little town
You don't need defenses
In my little town where I come from
In my little town you don't need a gun
In my little town where I come from
