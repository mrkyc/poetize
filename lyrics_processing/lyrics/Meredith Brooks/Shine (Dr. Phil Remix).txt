You gotta hang around me some more
Cause I'll remind you
I'll be around
While you're waging your war
With yourself and I
See it clearer than you can see it
You gotta get out of your head to believe it
Oh, I know something about you
You don't know
That's where you shine
When you're sinking you swim
You can see your way out instead of in
That's where you shine
Like a diamond in the rough
You're always so resilient
That's where you shine
When you're walking the edge
No one's ever gonna catch you stumbling
That's where you shine (shine)
Remember when told me
To get up and dust your self off
It wasn't easy
Everything can change and it usually does
It does, you said
Shake it off like it ain't no big thing
Won't be the last time we're sinking
Oh, I know something about you
You don't know

When you've think you had enough
Just a matter of time before you fade
That's where you shine
Like a clear in the bush
Like a headlight breaking through the haze
That's where you shine
When there's nothing but no
And there's no where to go you find away
That's where you shine, shine
Sometimes you need someone to see yourself clearer
There's no reflection when it's you inside the mirror
I know, something about you
You don't know
That's where you shine
When you're sinking you swim
You can see your way out instead of in
That's where you shine
Like a diamond in the rough
You're always so resilient
That's where you shine
When you're walking the edge
No one's ever gonna catch you stumbling
That's where you shine, shine
That's where you shine
When you've think you had enough
Just a matter of time before you fade
That's where you shine
Like a clear in the bush
Like a headlight breaking through the haze
That's where you shine
When there's nothing but no
And there's no where to go you find away
That's where you shine
Yes, shine
Shine, shine
