Lay down lay down
Lay it all down
Let your white birds smile up
On the ones who stand and frown
Lay down lay down
Lay it all down
Let your white birds smile up
On the ones who stand and frown

We were so close there was no room
We bled inside each others' wounds
We all had caught the same disease
And we all sang the songs of peace

Lay down lay down (Come on)
Lay it all down
Let your white birds smile up
On the ones who stand and frown (Bring it on, bring it on)
Lay down lay down (Yeah)
Lay it all down
Let your white birds smile up
On the ones who stand and frown
You might also like
What if I told you were stupid, destructive, soulless
Callous, murderous, malignant, belligerent, ignorant
Would you believe me would you like that
Or would you prove me wrong and fight back
I'd like to take the sunshine right from the sky
And let it shine on you through my eyes
You see we all in the same boat trying to float
So everybody grab a oar, we can make it to shore

Lay down lay down
Lay it all down
Let your white birds smile up
On the ones who stand and frown
Lay down lay down
Lay it all down
Let your white birds smile up
On the ones who stand and frown


Come on, come on

We were so close there was no room
We bled inside each others' wounds
We all had caught the same disease
And we all sang the songs of peace (What you need, what you need)
Some came to sing
Some came to pray
Some came to keep the dark away (What, baby?)
(Raise it up, raise it up)
So raise the candles high
'Cause if you don't we could stay
Black against the night (Light it up)
So raise them higher again
And if you do we could stay dry against the rain

Lay down lay down
Lay it all down
Let your white birds smile up
On the ones who stand and frown
You got to lay down lay down
Lay it all down
Let your white birds smile up
