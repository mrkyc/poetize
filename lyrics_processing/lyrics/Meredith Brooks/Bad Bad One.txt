I can't expect you to keep the door unlocked for me
I'm happy that you waited
Cause I know it's complicated keeping up with me
Oh no, it's almost that time again
For me to go round and round
In my head today
I get so bored when I stay
Oh, it could have been a good thing
But I-I'm the bad bad one
I know how hard you try for me
But I'm immature I run away for fun
I guess I'm not ready for a good love
And I-I'm the bad bad one
I'm the bad bad one
I wouldn't blame you if you tried to hang me
I keep you running around the same old tree
I wouldn't be the same if I didn't get away
With acting out for free, oh no
You seem to like it better when I'm mean
And here comes the fight again
About our cloudy fate
Well it looks like rain
I know it should have been a good thing
You might also likeBut I-I'm the bad bad one
I know how hard you try for me
But I'm immature I run away for fun
I guess I'm not ready for a good love
And I-I'm the bad bad one
I'm the bad bad one
I know you could be the one
I would let you give me good love

I-I'm the bad bad one
I know you try for me
I'm the bad bad one
I run away for fun
I guess I'm not ready for a good love
I'm the bad bad one
I run away for fun
I guess I'm not ready for a good love
I guess I'm not ready for a good love
I run away for fun
I guess I'm not ready for a good love
I know you try for me
I run away for fun
I guess I'm not ready for a good love
I'm not, ready, I'm just not ready for a good love
I run away for fun
I guess I'm not ready for a good love
I run away for fun
I guess I'm not ready for a good love
I run away for fun
