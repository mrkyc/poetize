I don't remember if I smiled
I don't think we talked
But you always hung around a while
And I don't know your name
Yeah I think that you were tall
I don't remember if I was ever nice to you at all
Suddenly you come undone
You tell me I'm the only one
You hold my head up with a gun
And tell me that we are in love
You touch me and you want the same
I close my eyes and start to pray
And tell you I will be the way
You want if you will only say your name
You wrote me everyday
I never knew that it was you
I just threw it all away
I didn't know what else to do
Jesus told you to find me
And never ever let me go
And we would be so happy
He promised you that I would know
You might also likeSuddenly you come undone
You tell me I'm the only one
You hold my head up with a gun
And tell me that we are in love
You touch me and you want the same
I close my eyes and start to pray
And tell you I will be the way
You want if you will only say your name
Your name
I am so sorry
So sorry, oh
I am so sorry
Jesus forgot to tell me
I see that you are crying
I know you only meant to be with me
But maybe I was hasty
I should have listened more carefully
Please tell me it's not too late
Your decision has been made
Before you pull the trigger
Please won't you tell me your, your name?
Suddenly you come undone
You tell me I'm the only one
You hold my head up with a gun
And tell me that we are in love
You touch me and you want the same
I close my eyes and start to pray
And tell you I will be the way
