Those high heels with that sun dress
Turquoise heart hanging 'round your neck
Red lips like wine, wanna to drink 'em up
And keep on drinking 'til you make me drunk
Tied-up hair, wanna let it down
And just let the rest fall to the ground
You take beautiful to the max
Can't help myself when you look like that

Come a little closer, come a little closer
Come a little closer, girl, the way you look tonight
My eyes are the only thing I don't wanna take off of you
Come a little closer, come a little closer
Come a little closer, love the way you look tonight
My eyes are the only thing I don't wanna take off of you

There's a million stars dancing in the sky
A picture-perfect moon so bright
But I don't care, I'm looking at you
From where I stand, you can't beat the view

Come a little closer, come a little closer
Come a little closer, girl, the way you look tonight
My eyes are the only thing I don't wanna take off of you
Come a little closer, come a little closer
Come a little closer, love the way you look tonight
My eyes are the only thing I don't wanna take off of you

My eyes have seen
Some amazing things
But, girl, my eyes ain't seen
Nothing quite like you, hey, baby

Come a little closer, come a little closer
Come a little closer, girl, the way you look tonight
My eyes are the only thing I don't wanna take off of you
Come a little closer, come a little closer
Come a little closer, love the way you look tonight
My eyes are the only thing I don't wanna take off of you
Come a little closer, come a little closer
Come a little closer, love the way you look tonight
