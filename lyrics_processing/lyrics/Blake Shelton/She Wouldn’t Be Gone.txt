Red roadside wildflower if I'd only picked you
Took you home set you on the counter
Oh, at least a time or two
Maybe she'd thought it through
Yellow sunset slowly dippin' down in the rearview
Oh, how she'd love to sit and watch you
I could have done that a whole lot more
If I hadn't been so stubborn, been so selfish
Thought about her more, thought about me less
Joked and make her laugh, held her when she cried
A little more that, maybe I

Wouldn't be drivin' like hell flyin' like crazy down the highway
Callin' everyone we know stoppin' any place she might be
Goin' any place she might go beatin' on the dash
Screamin' out her name at the windshield tears soaking up my face
If I had loved her this much all along, maybe, maybe, yeah, maybe
She wouldn't be gone
She wouldn't be gone

She warned me it was comin' said if I didn't change
She was leavin'
I just didn't believe she would ever really walk out
God, I believe her now
Called her mamma, cried like a baby to her best friend
If they've seen her, they ain't sayin', they ain't sayin'
Now, I'm cursin' like a fool, prayin' it ain't too late
All I wanna do is fix my mistakes
Find her beg her for one more try until then damn it I'll
