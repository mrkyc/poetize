Don't need no tab, don't need no VISA
No bouncer looking like a wannabe Vin Diesel
Don't need your friends all getting jealous
Watching you walk in looking so good that you could sell it

Uh-uh, not again
Girl, let's get this party started
Where the party always ends

Got a yellow backdoor porch party light
Got a speaker in the window playing Barry White
You and me out here swaying, stargazing
Gonna bring it back in, break the candles out
Get the mood turned on and the lights out
Lose a little something black and lacy in the couch
At the house

At the house
Yeah, that's what it's all about

Don't need no plans (nope), no reservations (uh-uh)
Nobody calling me up saying, "Where you at, man? We waiting"
We can keep it on chill (oh, yeah), or get a little obnoxious (uh-huh)
Go ahead and get your freak on, ain't nobody gonna stop us
