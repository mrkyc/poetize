Writin' rubber rent checks, livin' on Ramen
Chappin' our ass 'cause we can't afford Charmin
Rockin' that one-ply, one-ply
Shakin' down the couch, find a buffalo nickel
Medium guitar pick, Burger King pickle
Ohh, it's kinda petrified, petrified

Dollar's worth of gas didn't even move the needle
Livin' this leave-a-penny, take-a-penny life
Door's unlocked 'cause there's nothin' left to steal
Aw baby doll, that's alright

Hey girl, got that million dollar kiss
Know just what to do with it
Get me feelin' filthy rich
Hey girl, put that body all on me
Like I hit the lottery
Everything you do to me, honey
That's money
Money, money, money, money
Money, money, money, money

Girl, I sure can tell you've been workin' your butt off
The way you're rockin' them secondhand cut-offs
Hmm, can I talk ya into takin' 'em off?
Score a little discount six-pack Keystone
Use the paper sack, twist a little homegrown
Go on and get a Friday night on
See Blake Shelton LiveGet tickets as low as $87You might also like
Girl, one of these days, gonna look back laughin'
Sippin' pomegranate sake at Nobu
But baby, 'til then I'm a have-not havin'
Everything I have's got with you

Hey girl, got that million dollar kiss
Know just what to do with it
Get me feelin' filthy rich
Hey girl, put that body all on me
Like I hit the lottery
Everything you do to me, honey
That's money
Money, money, money, money
Money, money, money, money

Dollar's worth of gas didn't even move the needle
Livin' this leave-a-penny, take-a-penny life
Door's unlocked 'cause there's nothin' left to steal
Aw baby doll, that's alright

Hey girl, got that million dollar kiss
Know just what to do with it
Get me feelin' filthy rich
Hey girl, put that body all on me
Like I hit the lottery
Everything you do to me, honey
That's money
Money, money, money, money
Money, money, money, money
