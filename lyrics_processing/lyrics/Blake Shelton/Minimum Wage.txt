Yeah, I met you 'fore anyone knew my name
Playin' for pennies on the dive bar stage
Split an all-star special on our first date
In a Waffle House booth
Your daddy was cryin' when he gave you away
'Cause all those country songs I played
They didn't come with a 401k
But hey, I had you

You can make a six-pack on the carpet
Taste like a million-dollar bill
You can make a one-bedroom apartment
Feel like a house up on the hill
You can make my truck out in the driveway
Roll like a cleaned up Cadillac
Girl, lookin' at you lookin' at me that way
Can make a man feel rich on minimum wage

Girl, your love is money, your love is money
Yeah, your love can make a man feel rich on minimum wage
Girl, your love is money, your love is money
Yeah, your love can make a man feel rich on minimum wage

You can give me a tab that's always open
Or give me a yacht parked out in the ocean
But all that keepin' up with the Jones'
It just ain't my style
Just give me some lights strung out in the yard
Give me a lawn chair under the stars
The top of the world's right where you are
'Cause every time you smile

You can make a six-pack on the carpet
Taste like a million-dollar bill
You can make a one-bedroom apartment
Feel like a house up on the hill
You can make my truck out in the driveway
Roll like a cleaned up Cadillac
Girl, lookin' at you lookin' at me that way
Can make a man feel rich on minimum wage

Girl, your love is money, your love is money
Yeah, your love can make a man feel rich on minimum wage
Girl, your love is money, your love is money
Yeah, your love can make a man feel rich on minimum wage

You can make a six-pack on the carpet
Taste like a million-dollar bill
You can make a one-bedroom apartment
