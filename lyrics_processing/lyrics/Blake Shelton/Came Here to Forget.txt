Girl, you're getting over him and I'm getting over her
The eyes have it made, ain't gotta say a word
Misery loves company, that's why it's you and me
Buying each other drinks
Back at the bar, as thick as thieves
Stealing these little sips
Doing our best to make the best of the worst of it

Keep playing them songs, keep singing along
Keep leaning it on in closer
Keep salting the rim, getting even with her and with him before the night is over
That first kiss was like a Colorado hit
We better keep on keeping it lit
'Til we can't remember, can't remember
What we came here to forget

Go ahead and check your phone, like I've been checking mine
Nobody's ex is texting for a rewind
Looks like it's just me and you
Falling in love just enough to get us through
What we're get'in through

Keep playing them songs, keep singing along
Keep leaning it on in closer
Keep salting the rim, getting even with her and with him before the night is over
That first kiss was like a Colorado hit
We better keep on keeping it lit
'Til we can't remember, can't remember
What we came here to forget (yeah)
Just what we came here to forget
