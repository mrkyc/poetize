I'm a rebel
I been known to dance with the devil
So how'd I get up on your level?
You're an angel sent from heaven down to me
I'm rough around the edges
You're a snapshot of perfection
I was headed in the wrong direction
I was reckless
Now I've just got one question

Why me, out of everybody, baby?
Why me? You could have picked anybody
Why me? When I see you looking at me
I gotta ask, what did I do
To get to be the one you gave your heart to?
Walk up in a party on my arm
Who would've thought you would wanna wake up
Every day beside me
Baby, why me?

I remember night one
Looking around for the right one
Saw you sitting there, said "Well, I'm done"
And I walked over
Even though you were outta my league
You were diamonds in the sky
I was dirt on a plow
You're all-American pretty
I'm a one-horse town
First smile you gave me
I was thinking it then
And I'm still thinking it now

Why me? What did I do right?
Why me, kissing you goodnight?
You say you'll never let me go
Oh, it's crazy girl, I guess I'll never know

Why me, out of everybody, baby?
