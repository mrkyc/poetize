She wanna kick it in my pimped out Chevrolet
On 28's with the kandy paint
Steady clippin' while I'm dippin' on the interstates
Yeah she can't wait
My top back with my beat down low
Running round the city I don't know where to go
I guess I pull up on strip and turn a couple heads
A couple heads, turn a couple heads

I'm in a 6 9 Chevy-verk tudahuk dunk
