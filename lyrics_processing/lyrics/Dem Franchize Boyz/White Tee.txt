Hello, five for ten?
Jim? Great news great news great news, I just saved a bunch of money on wardrobe by switching to White Tee's
Yep in my white tee, yup in my white tee

I slang in my white tee, I bang in my white tee
All in the club spittin game in my white tee
I bling in my white tee, serve fiends in my white tee
Fuck a throwback I look clean in my white tee
I slang in my white tee, I bang in my white tee
All in the club spittin game in my white tee
I bling in my white tee, serve fiends in my white tee
Fuck a throwback I look clean in my white tee

Step on the scene with some green and some hard white work
Real clean fresh jeans and a all white shirt
We all get money and we all smoke purp'
Hit the dirt, one squirt'll leave all ya'll murk
Cause I'm fresh in my white tee, they glance at my white tee
And I got that hat that match my pants and my white tee
Whoever that you might see, I know they got a white tee
Homeboy, brother, sister, mother, daddy or your wifey
Hanes or Fruit of Loom be the name of my white tee
