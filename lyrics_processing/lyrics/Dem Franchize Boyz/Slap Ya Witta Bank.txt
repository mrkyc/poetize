Fuck around and get slapped with a bank roll (Keep playin')
Fuck around and get slapped with a bank roll (Keep playin')
Fuck around and get slapped with a bank roll (Keep playin')
I don't carry bills unless they end with a zero (Keep playin')
All of my bills got a zero at the end
100's and 50's and twenty twin twins
If it's less than a dub then I don't carry them
You put change in your piggy bank, I put 1's, 5's, and 10's
Yeah my pockets is bulging, it ain't nothing but my cash
Since I had on a throwback, they thought I had 
And since I'm a baller, lil partner
Yeah I'm going to throw up some money
Ain't talking about 5, 10, dubs; I'm talking about 50's and 100's
So fuck a briefcase, we get our money is caseloads
So tell me how it feels to get slapped with a bankroll
Now case closed, 'cuz I'm always going to make bread
I'm always going to get to the money 'cuz I'm from Bankhead
So break bread, be like me, and blow dough
I'm a say it one time, I won't say it no mo'

What you pulling out your money for? , come on now
I'm my own accountant, big cheese, so put your 1's down
Niggas see numbers, I spit wide  like bitches
I slap a nigga's ass with about $12,000 in crispies
50's, 20's, and 100's that's all I fuck with
With my clique, gon' hit the mall
And we all leave with enough shit
I see a dime (wait up miss)...well go bitch
