Verse 1
I ain't no bitch we dont play tricks
If you do something wrong leave you laying in a ditch
We ain't gon snitch cause you might get rich
I dont care what you got you ain't selling shit
We on that dank drank till we faint
We ain't shootin nothin but k's a leave you stank
Sell dope he can't sell weed you ain't
And i dont give a motherfuck what yall think
We ride them chevy's 23's wit the pipes
Yall got that yella yella cornbread we got that white
We rock them 1's them all white tee's
We ride nuthin but flats we dont ride no d's
We stay strapped workin in traps
Can't fuck wit the middle man cause a nigga be tryin 2 cap
And niggas bleedin its robbin season
So you betta keep cool don't give me no reason
Chorus(2x)
Verse 2
Im from the A westside Allen Temple where i stay
Niggas talkin all that chatter i break em up like B2K
Where im from im the gym stay ballin like MJ
Im a scarface nigga so i stay blastin the K
I be stackin in the winter bring them trays i dun made
Yea we stay rollin swishers cause we do it all day
Nigga trappin on the hill standin in my hallway
Where im from i bake them cookies chip ahoy is what they call me
Stay drunk what they all be know you never saw me
Cause im low key like a spot on the wall be
Niggas round hea scared takin lessons for karate
Yea i came up rich off a motherfuckin hobby
Niggas where im from yea we keep them nigga shoppin
Its gold diggas so them ho's steady plottin
Look into the money so my niggas always poppin
Fuck a red light franchize ain't stoppin
Chorus(2x)
Verse 3
We ride in trucks on big boy rims
I keep mo action than directors off in flims
We twist up hay stay servin Jays
Cautier shades chop around for days
Sending counts a glace i gotta stay
On my block 100 stacks it been made
If you want us on the stage upfront you gotta pay
We ain't no game so you know we can't be played
We dont play fuck what you say
Yall tote gats we tote choppas and AK's
You disobay and you gon lay
Off in the woods youll be missin for some days
We leave messes with Mac 11's
But they dont fuck wit me they know that number 7
We shoot off backs we shoot off legs
Westside, zone 1, bankhead
