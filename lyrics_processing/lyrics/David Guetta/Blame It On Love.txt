Blocked your number then let you come and spend the night
Couple animals, all we do is fuck and fight, ooh
No apologies but we got the best excuses
Making promises, even when we do, it's useless, useless

'Cause when we say it's over

We do it again on nights we're alone
Say that we won't be more than just friends
I know that you're home, so pick up the phone
'Cause I wanna be where you are
So let's just blame it on love
When the rules fall apart
Let's just blame it on love, blame it on love (blame it on love)
Let's just blame it on love, blame it on love (blame it on love)
Let's just blame it on love

Dropping bottles that we finished from the night before, hey yeah, yeah
First we're throwing knives, then we on the kitchen floor, uuh
No apologies but we have the best excuses, no
We can lie about it, baby, but we know what the truth is, the truth is

Baby, you can hold it against me
Long as you keep holding me against you
'Cause we get so high on the chemistry
Every time you leave

We do it again on nights we're alone
Say that we won't be more than just friends
I know that you're home, so pick up the phone
'Cause I wanna be where you are
So let's just blame it on love
