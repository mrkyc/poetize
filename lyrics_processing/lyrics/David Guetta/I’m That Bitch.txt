Icy, Icy, Icy, Icy

I pull up, bet you see them faces shift
Bust in looking like a couple GIF
Brrt, brrt, kill a scene, I make it quick
Brrt, brrt, hustle back, take a pic
Lookin' in your eyes, I see your fear
But you can't see me, though, I'm in the air
Boss bitch, y'all should call me Jefe
I'm known from Miami back to L.A

I'm that bitch, I'm that bitch

I'm that bi-bi-bi-bitch
