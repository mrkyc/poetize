You take me down, spin me around
You got me runnin' all the lights
Don't make a sound, talk to me now
Let me inside your mind

I don't know what you're thinkin', sugar, ooh
But I just got that feelin', sugar, ooh
And I can hear the sirens burnin', red lights turnin', I can't turn back now
So hold on tight

I don't know where the lights are takin' us
But somethin' in the night is dangerous
And nothing's holdin' back the two of us
Baby, this is gettin' serious
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
