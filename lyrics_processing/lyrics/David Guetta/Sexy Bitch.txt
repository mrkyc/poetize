Yes, I can see her
'Cause every girl in here wanna be her
Oh, she's a diva
I feel the same and I wanna meet her
They say she low down
It's just a rumor and I don't believe 'em
They say she needs to slow down
The baddest thing around town

She's nothin' like a girl you've ever seen before
Nothin' you can compare to your neighborhood ho
I'm tryna find the words to describe this girl
Without bein' disrespectful
The way that booty movin', I can't take no more
Had to stop what I'm doin' so I can pull her close
I'm tryna find the words to describe this girl
Without bein' disrespectful
Damn, girl

Damn, you's a sexy bitch, a sexy bitch
Damn, you's a sexy bitch
Damn, girl
Damn, you's a sexy bitch, a sexy bitch
Damn, you's a sexy bitch
Damn, girl
