There's only one thing you can't forget
You've got only one life
This is one night
And you'll never see her again

What time is it?
Do you know what time it is?
You ain't gotta be a scientist
For you to know that I'm down with it
Stop willin'
Hurry up 'cause I'm firin'
Do you wanna be divin' in
You just gotta come 'round with it

It's 12:45
Got your body on my mind
And in fifteen minutes
You might be the one
For the night
But my number you can call
And the writing's on the wall
Yeah, yeah
When we get, when we get, get, get together
Ooh

So smooth, make it feel like butter
Take me all the way tonight
Oh, take me all the way tonight
Can see that you seem like trouble
Too hot, make it feel like summer
Take me all the way tonight

When we get, when we get, get, get together
Ooh
You make me lose my mind
My heartbeat's out of time
When we get, when we get, get, get together
Ooh
It's time I close my eyes
I see your skin on mine
When we get, get, get together
