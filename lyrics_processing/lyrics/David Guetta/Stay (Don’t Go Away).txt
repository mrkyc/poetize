I got a place for two
Don't go away, don't go away

You don't even have to try
No other lips can make me cry
But there is something 'bout the way you look
Something from my heart you took tonight
And I don't mind (Stay)

And I want this, tell me if you want this
Baby, do you want this? Uh-huh

Love me in a tank top
I can make it topless, uh-huh
And you wanna try me
Baby, will you try me if you wanna cop this? Uh-huh
Don't go away, don't go away (Don't go away, stay)
