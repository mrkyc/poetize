Feel the adrenaline movin' under my skin
It's an addiction, such an eruption
Sound is my remedy, feedin' me energy
Music is all I need

I don't really care
I just wanna dance
I don't really care, care, care
(You can feel it in the air, yeah)

She's been a crazy Dita
Disco diva and you wonder
Who's that chick? Who's that chick?
Too cold for you to keep her
Too hot for you to leave her
Who's that chick? Who's that chick?
Who's that chick? Who's that chick?
Who's that chick? Who's that chick?

Back on the dance floor, bad enough to take me home
Bass kicking so hard, blazin' through my beating heart
French kissin' on the floor, heart is beating hardcore
Heard everybody is gettin' a little sexy off the Crazy Juice
This will end up on the news
