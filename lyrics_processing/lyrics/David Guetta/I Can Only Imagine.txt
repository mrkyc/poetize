Where you been? Where you been all my life?
Baby, this a sin, the way you look in the light
It's obvious that I want somethin' from you
And you know what, what I wanna do, do, do

If we touched, it would bring me to life
I could only imagine, only imagine what it'd be like
Oh, every time, it would bring me to life
I could only imagine, only imagine
What it'd be like, what it'd be like
What it'd be like, like, like
What it'd be like, like, like, like, like, like

Saw you, saw you, saw you from afar, thought I'd say, "Wassup"
You can tell me your name when we wakin' up
They, they, they call me Tunechi, I'm good, I'm Gucci
Now you can kiss your old dude goodbye, smooches
You're a beast, yo-you're a beauty
Man, I think somebody done gave Cupid a Uzi
Sh-Shoot me, you're a firework, brighter in the dark
So let's turn off the lights and give me that spark

If we touched, it would bring me to life
I could only imagine, only imagine what it'd be like
Oh, every time, it would bring me to life
I could only imagine, only imagine
What it'd be like, what it'd be like
What it'd be like, like, like
What it'd be like, like, like, like

I want your love to touch me, one touch will feel free

I want to feel free, so I can finally be (If you kiss me)
So I can finally be (Girl), so I can finally be (Kiss me now)
So I can finally see, so I can finally see (Kiss me now)
What, what, what

Saw you, saw you, saw you, saw you from afar, thought I'd say, "Wassup"
