Oh my mother was frightened by a shotgun, they say
That's why I'm such a wonderful shot
I'd be out in the cactus and I'd practice all day
But now tell me what have I got?
I'm quick on the trigger with targets not much bigger
Than a pinpoint, I'm number one
But my score with a feller is lower than a cellar
Oh, you can't get a man with a gun
When I'm with a pistol
I sparkle like a crystal
Yes, I shine like the morning sun
But I lose all my luster
When with a bronco buster
Oh you can't get a man with a gun
With a gun, with a gun
No, you can't get a man with a gun
If I went to battle
With someone's herd of cattle
You'd have steak when the job was done
But if shot the herder
They'd lock me up for murder
'Cause you can't shoot a male
In the tail like a quail
Oh you can't get a man with a gun
You might also likeIf I shot a rabbit some furrier would grab it
For a coat that would warm someone
But you can't shoot a lover
And use him for a cover
Oh, you can't get a man with a gun
The gals with umbrellas are always out with fellers
In the rain or the blazin' sun
But a man never trifles with gals who carry rifles
Oh, you can't get a man with a gun
With a gun, with a gun
No, you can't get a man with a gun
A Tom, Dick, or Harry
Will build a house for Carrie
When the preacher has made them one
But he can't build you houses
With buckshot in his trousers
'Cause a man may be hot
But he's not when he's shot
