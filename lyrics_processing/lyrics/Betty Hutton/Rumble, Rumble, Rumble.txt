That's what I tell my landlord, "Landlord, I gotta move"
'Cause there's a man, lives right upstairs from me
Making a nightmare of some melody
This is a situation not likely to improve
He goes-a rumble, rumble, rumble on the left hand
He goes-a tinkle, tinkle, tinkle on the right
Rumble, rumble, rumble, tinkle, tinkle, tinkle
Plays piano all night
He goes-a rumble, rumble, rumble on the bottom
He goes-a tinkle, tinkle, tinkle on the top
Rumble, rumble, rumble, tinkle, tinkle, tinkle
Positively won't stop
I tried-a knock-a, knock-a, knocking on the ceiling
I tried-a knock-a, knock-a, knocking on the wall
He takes a breather, no, he doesn't either
Just when I figure that's all
He goes-a rumble, rumble, rumble on the black keys
He goes-a tinkle, tinkle, tinkle on the white
Rumble, rumble, rumble, tinkle, tinkle, tinkle
Plays piano all right but he plays piano all night
Instead of cooking himself a quiet kettle of tea up there
Or maybe getting himself a girl and taking her out somewhere
Instead of sitting around, reading the jokes
Washing his socks, writing his folks
Taking a pill, sleeping the night through
What does he do? What does he do?
He goes-a rumble, rumble, rumble
Look at the whole building crumble
Tinkle, tinkle, tinkle, look at the wallpaper wrinkle
Rumble, rumble, rumble, tinkle, tinkle, tinkle
He could give insomnia to Rip Van Winkle
With that rumble, rumble, rumble
I've got a good right to grumble
Tinkle, tinkle, tinkle
I'm gonna raise quite a stomping
When you rumble, tinkle
Please somebody break his lease
I tried to hammer, hammer, hammer on the steam pipe
I tried to holler, holler, holler down the hall
I've got a feeling, he'll come through the ceiling
Big foot, piano and all
He goes-a fumbling, fumbling, fumbling with his left hand
He goes-a grope, grope, groping with his right
Fumble and grope, fumble and grope
The fumbly fool fumbles 'till he gets it right
