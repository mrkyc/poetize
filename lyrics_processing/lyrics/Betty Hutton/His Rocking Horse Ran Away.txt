Willie's been fed and I've tucked him in bed, thank goodness the darling's asleep
He's a wonderful boy and a joy and a boon
SPOKEN: Ahh, gee, you should have seen him this afternoon
Bang went the bridge lamp, down went the table, crash went the china tray
But he said "I couldn't help it, my rocking horse ran away!"
Rip rip went the curtain, wham went the window, crunch went the new buffet
And I heard him tell his daddy "My rocking horse ran away"
Somehow Indians got into our front room
Our cowboy grabbed for his gun and went boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
Slam went the screen door, smash went the mirror, looks like I'll soon be gray
But he smiles and what's the difference and maybe some Mother's Day
I'll remember when his rocking horse ran away
Got up early this morning, wore a flimsy negligee
Had to hurry to fix the breakfast and get daddy on his way
Figured I could get the paper, so the neighbors wouldn't see
So I sneaked out on the porch, very, very quietly
Wham went the dish pan, then came a holler, up went the neighbor's shade
It was Mother's little darling, out on a commando raid
Came home late from a picture. I was tired, my shoes were tight
Took off my stockings, dropped my girdle
Got undressed and pulled the light. boy!
Slipped into my night gown, then tiptoed across the floor
Better have a look at Junior, so I peeked into his door
Clang, clang, clang went a cowbell, whee went a whistle, I nearly had a stroke
It was mother's precious baby, just havin' his little joke
Always just when I'm breathin' a peaceful sigh
There's G-Men, coppers and robbers and hi-yo silver!
Bam went the book case, boot went the fruit bowl, boom went the glass bouquet
But he smiles and what's the difference and maybe some mother's day
I'll remember when, bang went the lamp, down went the table
Crash went the tray, rip rip went the curtain, wham went a window
Clang went a bell, whee went a whistle, bam went a pan, slam went a door
