I'm a lady
She's a lady
I'm a lady
She's as quiet as a mouse
Why, she would never ever raise her voice to a shout
Not unless somebody else is drownin' me out
Yes, she's a lady
I'm a lady
High falootin'
You're darn tootin'
And her manners are superb
Yesterday I wore a gown of satin an' lace
You took me out dinin' to the ritziest place
And when they brought the finger bowl
Why you washed your face
Ah I'm a lady
She's a lady
Oh yes
He's a lover
I'm a lover
He's big hearted
Once I've started
Nothin' is too good for you
Say, how do you mean that?
I bought you a golden necklace fit for a queen
If that's a golden necklace, why's my neck turnin' green?

He's the shy type
Yes, it's my type
He's the kind that girls can't trust
Some guys take a girl out ridin' an' when they do
She may have to walk home, that don't happen to you

You're what "class" is
You need glasses
You know just how things are done
In a crowded bus, you find a guy with a seat
Then you drop your hanky so it lands at his feet
When he stands up to get it, that's when I grab his seat
Yes, she's a lady
Oh I'm a lady

He's a singer
I'm a singer
Like Caruso
Learned to do so
In a barber-shop quartet
I once gave a haircut to a fellow one day
I started singing "Mammy" an' kept cutting away
Yeah, now they call him "baldy" an' he wears a toupee
You're a lady
You're a barber
You're a highbrow
You're a singer

Ha ha ha ha
She's a lady
Ah he's a singer
