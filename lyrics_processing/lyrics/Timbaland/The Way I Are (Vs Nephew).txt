I ain't got no money
I ain't got no car to take you on a date (Aha)
I can't even buy you flowers
But together we could be the perfect soulmates (Aha)
Talk to me girl

Oh, baby, it's alright now, you ain't gotta flaunt for me
If we go Dutch you can still touch, my love is free
We can work without the perks just you and me
Thug it out 'til we get it right

Baby if you strip, you can get a tip
'Cause I like you just the way you are
I'm Scandinavian, everything is what it is
I don't need the G's or the car keys
Boy I like you just the way you are
I'm Scandinavian everything is free

I ain't got no Visa
I ain't got no Red American Express (Aha)
We can't go nowhere exotic
It don't matter 'cause I'm the one that loves you best (Aha)
Talk to me girl
