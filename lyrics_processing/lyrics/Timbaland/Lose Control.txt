You know my girl get the keys with the M's on it
She have the Range night, then a Benz mornin'
Bought plenty of ice for them shinin' on your friends moments
I'll give her anything she want if it look good on her
And we be chillin' like a bottle sittin' on the rocks
Shoppin' bags full of Cartier forget-me-nots
But money can't buy you love, baby that's a fact
But you can rent some love, with a couple stacks
Man I ain't gotta lease nothin I own one
And every time I hit she say it's a home run
When asked how can we be serious at so young?
I just say I'm in it for the long run
