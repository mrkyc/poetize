Get out, you can't be in here, you have to get out
I implore you
Please, please
You're all going to die down here...

It's life or death, either one
The king is back, take heed and run
I piss and take a shit on your beats for fun
I killed the Game, I ain't even use a gun
Who better than me? Don't make me laugh
I run this shit, haters chase my ass
I ain't talkin' shit, nigga, just tellin' the facts
I think all the tracks I'm hearin' from niggas is whack
I be hearin' these niggas, what they say in their rhymes
I took my spot, nobody gave me mine
I make the beats that "Boom Boom Boom" in they trunks
You disagree, homie, then go on and jump
You can bump your gums, you can say what you want
That's all you gon' do, 'cause you niggas is punks
I'm number one, you ain't nuttin' but shit
When they need a hit, I'm who they come to get
Talk to me

If you got love for me, I got love for you
If you won't fuck with me, I won't fuck with you
We can do it however you wanna do
Nigga, if you won't fuck with me, I won't fuck with you
Go 'head

Kill yourself, kill yourself, kill yourself
Go kill yourself, kill yourself, kill yourself
(If I was you, I wouldn't feel myself)
Go kill yourself, kill yourself, kill yourself
Go kill yourself, kill yourself, kill yourself
(If I was you, I wouldn't feel myself)

Yo
Hey
I'm tired of niggas, niggas is tired
You ain't a G, I see bitch in your eyes
If you're close to me, you're supposed to be
But most you rap niggas is hoes to me
Wherever you from, the question I ask
Is do you think I give a fuck, riddle me that
'Cause in my hood, you done been to hell and back
This sinister shit, to hell with that
I seen them come, I seen them go
I doubt if you can show me something I ain't seen before
Who's supposed to be in charge, I need to know
When I shake your hand, I'mma step on your toe
Go get your gun, go get your clique
I'mma be right here chillin' with your bitch
You mad at me, 'cause I'm getting' rich?
Well, put the pistol to your head and empty the clip
Fuck nigga!
If you got love for me, I got love for you
If you won't fuck with me, I won't fuck with you
We can do it however you wanna do
Nigga, if you won't fuck with me, I won't fuck with you
Go 'head

Kill yourself, kill yourself, kill yourself
Go kill yourself, kill yourself, kill yourself
(If I was you, I wouldn't feel myself)
Go kill yourself, kill yourself, kill yourself
Go kill yourself, kill yourself, kill yourself
(If I was you, I wouldn't feel myself)

See my heart, feel my pain
Some is stars, some is lames
How they follow little trends to get they fame?
I ain't snap my damn fingers to get in the game
You claim you rich, show me, son
If you got so many dollars, then loan me one
Fools think they're killers, they own a gun
When you know you 'bout as sweet as a honey bun
Trashy broads, behind the bar
Like you that dude, you're frontin' hard
VIP bands don't make you a star
Like we really still don't know who the fuck you are
Don't talk behind my back, just call me, nigga
Move my heart to the side, make room to forgive ya
If you still wanna hang, we'll come to get ya
Put the rope around your neck, jump, my nigga
You're all going to die down here
Get out, get out
You can't be in here
