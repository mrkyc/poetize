(Timbaland x3)
Hit the dance floor and pick it up
Baby, put it down and pick it up

We used listen to cover girls (wasn't in it)
And now I mess with cover girls
Magazines, you can catch me on the cover, girl
I created my own planet
I hover the Earth, and cover the world
I spit so thick, imma call it a pearl
I see you tryna claim her, now I play with her pearls
Try to come at me, with all of my 
Life's a bitch, but I made her my girl
Now she does what I say, does what I please
? she lives on her knees
Jack and Jill went up the hill
Each with a buck and a quarter
Jill came back with $2.50
What a working girl, now work it, girl! Like..

I love when I see your pretty ass on the floor
I love when I see you break it down like you in control
(Pitbull)
I got a cup to my right, and a girl to my left
And I'm stumbling when I'm out of breath
Like g-g-g-g-g-g-go
Like g-g-g-g-g-g-go
I got girls on my right, I got girls on my left
The one in the middle and I'm feeling on her breath
Like g-g-g-g-g-g-go
Like g-g-g-g-g-g-go

I love when you, making me
Oh pass at me, oh pass at me
I love when you, making me
Oh pass at me, oh pass at me
I love when you, making me
Oh pass at me, oh pass at me
I love when you, making me
Oh pass at me, oh pass at me
I love-love-love-love-love-love
Love-love-love-love-love-love
Love-love-love-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e
(Beat breaks)
Pass at me, pass at me, pass at me
Pass at me, pass at me, pass at me
Pass at me, pass at me!
Pass at me, pass at me, pass at me
Pass at me, pass at, pass at me!
