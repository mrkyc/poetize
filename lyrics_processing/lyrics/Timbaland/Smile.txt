Through the rain or shine, I'll be there when you call me
(There when you call me)
You're my favorite song that I sing in the morning
You're the cream to my coffee
You're the sound of my heart beat
Baby you're that winner, can't lose cause I got that winner
Can't lose if I got you here
Oh, I would climb or move any day that you ask me (ask me)
Need no parachute, cause your loves gonna catch me
If you're there then I'm happy
If you're not then I'm crappy
You make everything better
When it pours baby you're my umbrella
Even on my worst day

I know that we gon' make it when I see you smile
See you smile
Yeah, I know that we gon' make it when I see you smile
So let me turn that frown upside down
Let's just toast to love that we found, yeah
'Cause I know that we gon' make it when I see you smile
See you smile

Oh, when the chips are down, I'd bid you all that I got (all that I got)
With your poker face, we can still hit the jackpot
Then we ball 'til we cash out, then we ball 'til we cash out
I ain't leaving you never, I ain't lea-lea-leaving you never, never yeah
Oh when I need a lift baby, you never let me down
And when I fall off you put me right back together now
Put me right back together now, put me right back together now
I ain't leaving you never, I ain't lea-lea-leaving you never
Even on my worst day
