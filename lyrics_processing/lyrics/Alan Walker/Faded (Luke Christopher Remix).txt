Where are you now? Atlantis
Under the sea, under the sea
Where are you now? Another dream
The monster's running wild inside of me
I'm faded

(Yeah) Honestly, you probably shouldn't listen to a word I say
'Cause girl, I feel like I've been dizzy for days
Would you do it if I asked you to stay
Or would you tell me it's a little too late?
'Cause if it is I'd be happy to fade
Said I'd pick a better time and a place, yeah
But if it's not and you still got monsters
My demons would be happy to play
Just look at everyone's faces, you know that they faded
Always escaping, I did too much taking
Now when you say shit, it feels it's nothin' like
When I had you, girl, at least I had somethin' right
Deep like the ocean, seizing the moment
My cards are showing

Where are you now? Atlantis
Under the sea, under the sea
Where are you now? Another dream
The monster's running wild inside of me
I'm faded, I'm faded
So lost, I'm faded, I'm faded
So lost, I'm faded

And I don't mean to put on the pressure
But if you ever wanna do it to me again
I probably would let ya
And I know it's a little bit extra
To say that I'm messed up's an understatement
It's time that I let go, I'm done with hatin'
I hear music having me blasting
Life is steadily passing, baby, I'm not exaggeratin'
So I'ma keep deep diving
Just to see you, where you hidin'?
And if you aren't in the sea
I just wait until I dream just to see if I can find you

Where are you now? Atlantis
Under the sea, under the sea
Where are you now? Another dream
The monster's running wild inside of me
I'm faded, I'm faded
So lost, I'm faded, I'm faded
