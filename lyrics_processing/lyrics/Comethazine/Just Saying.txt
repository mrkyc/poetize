If you ain't got no diamonds on your neck, then how you drippin' then?

If you ain't got no diamonds on your neck, then how you drippin' then?
And if you ain't pourin' up and sippin' Tech, then what you sippin' on?
If you ain't got a chopper or a TEC, then what you grippin' on?
If you ain't smokin' grandma cookie thrax, then what you trippin' on?
If you not really 'bout to throw it back, then why you strippin' then?
If you ain't pull up in this white Hellcat, then what you dippin' in?
And if you're not gon' contribute to my money, mind your business then
And if he knows where and when and what I did, I kill the witness then

Just like a Bic lighter, lit him like a cig, then I finished him
Pull out, shoot a nut to her wig, then dismiss the ho
Had to locate, find out where he live, then get rid of him
Shoot her in her face with my kids, show her to the door
Bitch, I live by the gun, ducking pigs, I can never go
Semi, semi automatic, long dick, drop him to the floor
Johnny Dang diamonds sit right by my lip, this a twenty piece
