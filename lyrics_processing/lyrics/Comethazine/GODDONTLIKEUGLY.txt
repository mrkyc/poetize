God don't like ugly and neither do I
God don't like ugly and neither do I
Fuck a bad bitch and I nut on her eye
Fuck a bad bitch and I nut on her eye

God don't like ugly and neither do I
Fuck a bad bitch and I nut on her eye
Ride with the fire, I'm not ready to die
Pass him a, pass him a tissue, he ready to cry
When I up the nine, I'ma shoot 'til he dies
Yes, I'm rollin' up dope, but I'm already high
When I up the nine, I'ma shoot 'til he dies
Yes, I'm rollin' up dope, but I'm already high
God don't like ugly and neither do I
Fuck a bad bitch and I nut on her eye
Ride with the fire, I'm not ready to die
Pass him a, pass him a tissue, he ready to cry
When I up the nine, I'ma shoot 'til he dies
Yes, I'm rollin' up dope, but I'm already high
When I up the nine, I'ma shoot 'til he dies
Yes, I'm rollin' up dope, but I'm already high

Sike, bitch, I'ma stay rich (Believe it)
Fuck on that bih', make her dip like a chip (Bye)
Shoot the stick, he pop like a zit
Package en route, delivered it quick
He five minutes out, just give him a bit
He brought the gas, he brought the shit
He brought the flavors, I'm ready to pick
He brought the cookies, now where is the milk?
I want some food, now I got the munchies
Make that boy jump then I cut off his bungee
This is a stickup, this not a drill
Blow off his foot just to show him it's real
I don't like the label but couldn't beat the deal
Throw me a hundred, turned that to a mil'
I bought my first crib 'fore I knew how to live
And it's on a hill, I'm ballin' for real (For real)
