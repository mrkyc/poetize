(Div, Div, Div)
(D-D-D-Div, don't do it to 'em)

I got my gun, so please spin back, mmm, mmm, please spin back
I had my gun when they tried to attack, please spin back
Don't hit and run, just please spin back, please spin back
We are not done, so please spin back, please spin back

We do this for fun, bet he ain't know that
Know we out here lookin' for a toe tag
They was four deep, but I had one gat
Went and got more heat, so please come back
Please spin back, wanna know what you meant by that
Oh, I know, you must have thought I was a ho
Spin back now and get a tag for your toe
Trap don't stop, get a bag for the low
Might go shop and cop a bag for my ho
Gave her good pipe, had her askin' for more
If you see me, just know I might be grabbin' my pole (Woo)
Vintage-ass drip, yeah, the fashion is old
Re-rock block, no need for the stove
Her body rock, unbelievable ho
Fiends hit the block when they need 'em some more
Four against one, add four to the score
Four lines enough, but I'm pourin' up more
Four pound tucked everywhere that I go
It be with me at the store, it be with me with the ho
