You're living in darkness
You've got to come to know the truth
You're living in darkness
You've got to come to see the light
Attention! Attention! My name is Albatjov
Mi come for tell you 'bout a thing called "One Love"
We have a lot of jealousy, so you see
Today's friends are tomorrow's enemy
A lot of them are sleep a mi say lot of them are work
Jah know Jah know Jah know you have to reap what you sow
We used to be friends but now we go apart
We used to be cool but now we don't talk
Ask me why boy, I don't know
Maybe's jealousy between me and you
Maybe it's my progress nor is it my dollarsis
I've always been thinking that you are the chosen one
But your attitude problems I can't explain
I keep wondering how you can go so far
One day you might end up being having no friends
Count me out 'cause Jah Jah says so

You're loving money more than people
You'd be loving people more than money
If it's one God, one aim, one destiny
For the better in the world
For you and for me
You're living in darkness
You should be living in the light
Think if love was a thing money could buy
The rich would a live and the poor would a die
But since it's not it, and what is it
One love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love
You're living in darkness
You've got to come to know the truth
You're living in darkness
You've got to make a sacrifice
You're living in darkness
You've got to come to know the truth
You're living in darkness
You should be living in the light
