Dis say Dr. Alban tellin' everybody

2 o'clock on a Friday mornin'
Come a gun man, come a knife man
Knife of a bouncer mash of the cars
On the run come a Kings Street
There he was arrested and tested
And the drugs he had in him, he confessed it
Mi callin' on the youth in this country
Whole heap of boys and whole heap of girls
Drug abuse is a dangerous thing
Stay out of drugs and stop the violence
Inna dis hard time you have abuse the drugs
Listen what 'ya say and hear my point of view
Too much drugs you can go mental
Dis say Dr. Alban tellin' everybody
We no want no coke, no heroin
No hasch-hasch, no amphetamine

Cocaine will blow your brain
And ecstasy will mush your life!
Cocaine will blow your brain
And ecstasy will mush your life!

Drug pushing is a serious thing
One time, two time they make a million
Take all the money a run a foreign country
Build a big house, buy a big limousine
Das why I man come so you for do the right thing
Das why Jah Jah send me to tell them the truth
Cause is a disgrace to the human race
Some are flyin' very high and some are flyin' very low
Could not differentiate what is right from wrong
We no want no coke, no heroin
No hasch-hasch, no amphetamine
No marijuana planted inna mi yard

Cocaine will blow your brain
And ecstasy will mush your life!
Cocaine will blow your brain
And ecstasy will mush your life!
Mi have one friend, them a call him Denniz Pop
Him have a little son, them a call him Daniel
He live a two room inna Stockholm City
One colour TV, two stereo
He's DJ producer of higher quality
He no deal with booze and abuse of drug
That's why mi give him thanks
And praise Jah Jah know
We play a heavy riddim inna dancehall style

Why crack in the mornin', crack in the evening
Crack in the night and crack non stop
We don't want no coke, no heroin

Cocaine will blow your brain
And ecstasy will mush your life!
Cocaine will blow your brain
And ecstasy will mush your life!
