Oh whoa, oh whoa, oh oh oh...

Waking up here to another day
Seems like the drama never goes away
I'ma take it, I'ma face this
'Cause ain't nobody that could handle my own business
I don't give a damn what they gonna do (Naw)
To me 'cause I'ma keep it true
You don't like me, that don't phase me
You can try, but you ain't never gonna change me

This goes out to all the fly girls (Fly girls)
Don't let this bullshit rock your world (Your world)
Don't get caught up, let your hair down
Oh baby, dance (Oh)
Dance (Oh), dance the night away
You gotta work (Work), work (Work)
Work that thing on me
'Cause we can't waste no time (No time) livin life that way
So baby, move (Oh), move (Oh)
Keep it hood and let it go

Oh whoa, oh whoa, oh oh oh...

If you're gonna get better, just work it
These phonies judging you, can't fit in one of your shoes
Don't be stressing, no more playing
Show them how you're gonna shake off what they say and

No matter what they do, it's gonna be alright
Put on your pair of shoes and just dance tonight
Let it flow, let 'em know, let it go
No matter what they do, I'ma keep it tight
I dunno 'bout, but baby, it's my night
Let it flow, let 'em know, let it go
