Damn, I never thought I'd say what I'm about to say
Didn't want anyone
But I met you and the whole thing changed (Yeah)
All the things you said had me hopin' that your game was true (Yeah)
Got too comfortable
Didn't see the real side of you

And I was sorriest
Even with your best
This is ain't gonna work no more
What was I waiting for?

I'm so done
And there's nothing you can do
I'm better off without you
There will be no second chances
Taking you back, 'cause I'm over that
So done
Nothing you say can change my mind
Don't even waste your time
Truth is - you took me for granted
You know I really had it
I'm so done
You might also like
Now don't come around
With promises that don't exist
'Cause heard it all before
And your sorries ain't fixing this (No)
Held on for so long 'cause I didn't want to let you go
Thinking you really cared (You really cared)
And that time would let it show

And I was sorriest
Even with your best
This is ain't gonna work no more
What was I waiting for?

I'm so done
And there's nothing you can do
I'm better off without you
There will be no second chances
Taking you back, 'cause I'm over that
So done
Nothing you say can change my mind
Don't even waste your time
Truth is - you took me for granted
You know I really had it
I'm so done
Maybe I was stupid, thinking you could handle this
I was dead wrong
Counted on you for my happiness (Yeah)
I had to realize
I didn't see it until now
Been a fool needing you
But now I'm breaking out
So I'm gonna keep pressin' on
I'm so done
Now it's obvious
Even with your best, this ain't gonna work no more
What was I waiting for?

So done
And there's nothing you can do
I'm better off without you
There will be no second chances
Taking you back
'Cause I'm over that
So done
Nothing you say can change my mind
Don't even waste your time
Truth is - you took me for granted
You know I really had it
I'm so done
And there's nothing you can do (Nothing you can do)
I'm better off without you
There will be no second chances
Taking you back
'Cause I'm over that
So done
Nothing you say can change my mind
Don't even waste your time
Truth is: You took me for granted
You know I really had it
