Live it, live it
Can't believe, made it through another day
Who woulda' thought that my life could take a turn this way
Sitting here, thinking what I'm gonna do
Do I give up? Oh, not with everything I'm going through
But I won't 'cuz it isn't worth the time
Just standing still when without this I'll be doing fine
I must see past and remember it'll get better
Look up higher and just do my best
Not today, not now
I won't fall
So if you're feeling down
Why keep pressing on?
Live it up, live it up, gotta live it up, live it up
'Cuz it isn't worth your cries
Live it up, live it up, gotta live it up, live it up
'Cuz the sun's gonna shine
Live it up, live it up, gotta live it up, live it up
Just let loose tonight
Live it up, live it up, gotta live it up, live it up
Let's make the best of life

The worst is done, so just let it free
Sing to your song and just feel the beat
Don't ever feel that it's wrong to dream
Just live it up, make it your party
Grab your friends, do the most that's right
Don't look back 'cuz you'll lose the fight
Shake it off if you feel the vibe
Do what you do and let go tonight
Not today, not now
You won't fall
So why the feeling down, why?
Keep pressing on
Live it up, live it up, gotta live it up, live it up

That you're meant to be happy
