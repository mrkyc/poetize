Ooh, ooh, ooh

Post it up on a weekend trip
All my peeps
Heading out, feeling finger licking
All freshed up, ready for touching
I'm your little chula, straight out of Brooklyn
What's the play? Ain't smoking some days
We had a lot of fun
Last time we paralyed
Check it
Swoop through, so I can see you
Check the back, lift the mat
No clue what I'ma do to you

(Can you) Can you come see me tonight? (Why?)
'Cause I've been thinking about you all day
My parents are gone and I'm all alone
So won't you swing my way
(Can you) Can you come see me tonight? (Why?)
'Cause I've been thinking about you all day
My parents are gone and I'm all alone
So won't you come swing my way?
You might also like
Dim the lights
Light the candles, relaxing smell real good
Ready for maxing
If the cards play right
Never know what could happen
Stay game tight
Got no time for slacking
Me and you, first time we're alone
And around our friends only talk on the phone
Come on through 'cause I like your stylo
I'm fit to tip
We'll do whatever you wanna do

(Can you) Can you come see me tonight? (Why?)
'Cause I've been thinking about you all day
My parents are gone and I'm all alone
So won't you swing my way
(Can you) Can you come see me tonight? (Why?)
'Cause I've been thinking about you all day
My parents are gone and I'm all alone
So won't you swing my way

No problem, mommacita
You want it - I'll come and 'G' ya
As soon as I move dis re-up
Da times free'ah ta see ya
Flyhood in ya neighborhood
Heavy Chevy rimmed up
Ears, neck, pinky
Heavy prezzle bezzie gem'd up
White on white air ones
All on ya momma'z lawn
Fitted bent low
No one knows who I'm creepin' on
What you seek, find in Quan, learn why they call me Don
While fiend'n for me to move forward like my name Lebron
And when it comes to cardz, playin' the hand ain't nothin'
I'm a dealer, most of deez otha dudez just frontin'
And you could learn something if we build together
And if you act right, I might sing a song to make ya feel better
(Can you) Can you come see me tonight? (Why?)
'Cause I've been thinking about you all day (All day)
My parents are gone and I'm all alone
So won't you swing my way
(Can you) Can you come see me tonight? (Why?)
'Cause I've been thinking about you all day
My parents are gone and I'm all alone
So won't you swing my way
(Can you) Can you come see me tonight? (Why?)
'Cause I've been thinking about you all day (All day)
My parents are gone and I'm all alone
So won't you swing my way
(Can you) Can you come see me tonight? (Why?)
'Cause I've been thinking about you all day (All day)
My parents are gone and I'm all alone
