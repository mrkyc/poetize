What i need
What i need

Why can't I just meet a total stranger
Fall in love, and live happily ever after?
At the perfect ending to my story
The kind you only see in movies
Things never happen that way, do they?
In my reality the love just won't stay
It hurts like hell what I'm feeling
Is that the way love's suppose to be

I've had enough, its like a drug
I can't give up, I'm feigning
I'm in his plans, my superman, my baby

All I want is someone
That could hold me down
That's gon' be around
When I need him
Giving me that real love
'Cause that's what he's about
Someone to ride with me
That's what I need

I need someone whose sensitive, but still thug
Someones who throws down, but still knows how to show love
A real man, understanding, but demanding
So fly, but faithful to me
I need to feel like there's someone I could run to
He gives me more of his time then he's got to
Gives me my space when I gotta go and do me
Supports whatever makes me happy

I've had enough, its like a drug
I can't give up, I'm feigning
I'm in his plans, my superman, my baby

All I want is someone
That could hold me down
That's gon' be around
When I need him
Giving me that real love
'Cause that's what he's about
Someone to ride with me
That's what I need

All I need
Is something real, to me
Baby, all i want is to be happy in love
(Oh, all I want is someone) Someone that could hold me down
(Hold me down) That's gon' be around (Be around)
(When I need him) ohh-ohh-ohh-ohh-ohh
(Giving me that real love) Giving me nothing but his love
('Cause that's what he's about) Ohh-ohh-ohh
(Someone to ride with me)
(That's what I need) That's what I need
(All I want is someone) What I want is someone
(That could hold me down) Hold me down
