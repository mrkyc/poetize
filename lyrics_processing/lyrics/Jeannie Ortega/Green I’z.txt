Jeannie, Jeannie, Jeannie, can't you see?
Your green eyes just hypnotize me
And I just love your flashy ways
Don't you know my love is here to stay?
Is here to stay, is here to stay, is here to stay, is here to stay

Listen
So innocent
So tempting
What to do (What to do)
Look into my eyes
They'll take over you (Take over you)
They'll draw your body close
They'll take control of you (Control of you)

Look through the windows of my soul
What makes your man wanna let go?
Makes your body hot, head to toe
These green eyes
Keep the contact, don't lose it
Make you wanna come pursue this
Don't you wanna come and be with these green eyes?
These green eyes
Whoa, whoa, oh, whoa, oh
These green eyes
You might also like
They'll make you do the dance
That you said you'd never do (Never do, never do)
This grown baby boy
Am I teasing you? (Teasing you)
On your mind all the time (You know I'm thinkin' 'bout you, baby)

Look through the windows of my soul
What makes your man wanna let go?
Makes your body hot, head to toe
These green eyes
Keep the contact, don't lose it
Make you wanna come pursue this
Don't you wanna come and be with these green eyes?
These green eyes
Oh, oh
These green eyes

Drop your things and head my way
Don't you want to come and play?
I don't want no place to get away
There's no words for what than eyes can say
Green eyes
Look through the windows of my soul
What makes your man wanna let go?
Makes your body hot head to toe
These green eyes
Green eyes
Keep the contact, don't lose it
Make you wanna come pursue this (Yeah, yeah)
Don't you wanna come and be with these green eyes?

Green eyes (Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, whoa)
These green eyes
Green eyes (Yeah, yeah)
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
These green eyes
