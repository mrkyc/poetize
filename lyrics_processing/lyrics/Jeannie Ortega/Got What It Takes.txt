No time to act polite its time to do it right
I'm just a baby I'm too young for lady's night
Don't need a pimp yea don't need the cash
Just wanna shake my beautiful ass
Just wanna feel the song sweat me all night long
I'm along way from 21 late night clubin'
V.I.P access only your heartbeat can relax this
I'm a show you shit I bet we into it
Lets get serious I ain't so freakin' innocent
I wanna elevate I need to concentrate
Like J.Lo I get down on the ass o tate
Get your back up off the wall
When your out with me turn up the degrees
2 turns rock your head to your feet
Cause I got what it takes to start the party
Turn it up make it juicy
All the freaks on the street want to ride with me
Step to me and you'll see
(I got what it takes to start the party)
You gotta move your hips take a hit of this
Just wanna shake it baby until you sit
Got no idea what the lady's like
But I know what the boys like
Bumpin' on the floor in my biggie draws
Dj blastin' like you asked for more
Watch I don't crush you when I land
Slidin' on this beat like an avalanche
Can't get rid of me cause I'm just what you need
You'll be spitin' my hooks like a wanna be
I'm a let you watch me incinerate I'm a blow you up
When I demonstrate
