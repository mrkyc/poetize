Looking at the reflections of myself
Without a mirror, I see someone else
You're laughing at me 'cause you don't see my soul
You think the smile I wear says I'm happy, but you don't really know

Everyday's a fight
Soon, I'll have no tears left here to cry
Jump to the words I speak
When will somebody hear me?

I'm talking, I'm pleading, I need you to understand me
I'm screaming at the top of my lungs
It's so hard (Can't you hear me?)
Hear my lonely cry (I need someone to love me)
Hear my lonely cry (Ooh)
Why Can't you hear me

I'm catching teardrops (Teardrops)
When I hear the phone ring
I wanna say so bad what's really wrong
What's hurting me
I'm lashing out, I'm breaking down
Feels like my life's crashing in around me
When I hear in the words, I speak
Can you help me?

Everyday's a fight
Soon, I'll have no tears left here to cry
Jump to the words I speak
When will somebody hear me? (Can you hear me?)

I'm talking, I'm pleading, I need you to understand me
I'm screaming at the top of my lungs
It's so hard (Can't you hear me?)
Hear my lonely cry (I need someone to love me)
Hear my lonely cry (Ooh)
Why Can't you hear me

Sometimes I wish I could sleep forever
'Cause when I sleep, my life is so much better
So busy trying to please
Be what you want me to be
I dream when someone is gonna take care of me

I'm talking, I'm pleading, I need you to understand me
I'm screaming at the top of my lungs, it's so hard (Can't you hear me?)
(I need someone to love me, ooh)
Why can't you hear me?
Tell me its gonna be alright
Ohh, hear my criess
