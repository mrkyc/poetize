Brooklyn, stand up
Get them hands up
Brooklyn, stand up
Get them hands up

Ain't no stoppin' me now, now
I'm ready to go, go
Ain't no stressing no more, more
They can't fade me
On the block, it stays hot, hot
With nowhere to go go
But I took control
So I made it

Yeah, sometimes it's hard, but I'll deal with it
Put my faith in God, and keep on living

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Just pay it
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Baby, no matter what, they gon' be hating
Flip that, shake it, keep on percolating
You might also like
I'm walking tall every day, day
Don't care what you say, say
Get out of my way, way
I'm not playing
You thought you could hold me down, down
Well, look at me now, now
I put on my smile smile
And I paid it

Yeah, they tried real hard, but I ain't seen it
Put my faith in God, and kept believing

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Just pay it
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Baby, no matter what, they gon' be hating
Flip that, shake it, keep on percolating

I ain't gonna' stop, Take it to the top
Cause see now, we makin' moves
And for those who kept it true
How could I eva forget you (Eva forget you)
So I'm keep it lock
Give thanks for what i got
Now all my people, take a stand
I don't regret a thing, not hurt, the pain
'cause it made me who i am
Shake them haters off, make them fakers leave
I'm tryin' to get this cheese, oh please believe
But some of these fools don't mind their p's
Tryin' to make this bread, why you all in my recipe?
Haters promote it, haters demote it
The only way you dope is if I wrote it
No matter how you act, you can't hold me back
Me and Jeannie on the track
What's messing with that?

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Just pay it
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Baby, no matter what, they gon' be hating
Flip that, shake it, keep on percolating

Brooklyn stand up
Get them hands up
Brooklyn stand up
Get them hands up

Boricua, oh
Morena, oh
Latino, oh
