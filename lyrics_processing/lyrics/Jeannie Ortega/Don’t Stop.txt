Still not old
Make that money
I'm in control
A mans cool if I'm in town
Don't need no one to hold me down
I keeps it moving
'cause that's just me
I'm complicated
Sleep don't come easy
And everything I got
Yea I worked for it
Nothing comes for free
Ladies if you understand just where I'm coming from
From the BK to Hollywood come on
If you doing you then ain't a damn thing wrong
Come on come on sing this song
Fella's if you hear me and you handling your biz
From your suit and tie
Down to your tims
Feel this - all my women sing this
Don't stop
Ladies - bringing the heat
You hot
Get up get on your feet
Won't stop
Being independent
If you feel me - ladies say 'yeah'
Don't stop
Fellas - bringing the heat
You hot
Single sexy and free
Won't stop
Being independent
Fellas - if you hear us say
You might also like
'Don't Stop'
Got no worries cause I'm blessed
And where I'm from I don't forget
Stay focused and I don't look back
Pay my dues and I earn respect
I been broken, I've been down
Yeah I'm from the hood but I made it out
I always knew at the end of the day
It be me myself and God!
From the BK to Hollywood come on
If you doing you then ain't a damn thing wrong
Come on come on sing this song
Fella's if you hear me and you handling your biz
From your suit and tie
Down to your tims
Feel this - all my women sing this
Don't stop
Ladies - bringing the heat
You hot
Get up get on your feet
Won't stop
Being independent
If you feel me - ladies say 'yeah'
Don't stop
Fellas - bringing the heat
You hot
Single sexy and free
