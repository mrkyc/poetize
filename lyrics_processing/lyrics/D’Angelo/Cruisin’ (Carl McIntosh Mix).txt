Baby, let's cruise away from here
Don't be confused, baby, the way is clear
And if you want it, you got it forever
Oh, this is not a one night stand, baby

Let the music take your mind
And just release and you will find, baby

We're going to fly away
Glad you're going my way
I love it when we're cruisin' together
Music was made for love
Cruisin' is made for love
I love it when we're cruisin' together

Baby, tonight belongs to us
Everything's right, do what you must, baby
And inch by inch we get closer and closer
Every little part of each other, ooh baby, baby

Let the music take your mind
Just release and you will find, baby
You might also like
We're going to fly away
Glad you're going my way
I love it when we're cruisin' together
Music was made for love
Cruisin' is made for love
I love it when we're cruisin' together
We're going to fly away
Glad you're going my way
I love it when we're cruisin' together
Music was made for love
Cruisin' is made for love
I love it when we're cruisin' together

Oh, ooh, cruise with me, baby
Oh, oh, baby, hey hey
Ooh, oh, oh, baby
Oh, baby, let's cruise
Let's float, let's glide
Ooh ooh, that's all for love, baby, and go inside, baby
And if you want it, you got it forever
Oh, I can just stay there inside you and love you, baby

Let the music take your mind
Just release and you will find, baby
We're going to fly away
Glad you're going my way, oh baby
I love it when we're cruisin' together
Music was made for love
Cruisin' is made for love
