Had a girl one time finer than all outdoors
She were nice but every last single one of her friends were hoes
I love the girl man, forget your friends
Said will be with me 'til the end I give you anything
And when you need your weed to be smoked, fuckin' go broke
Get your nails done every week if you want you can do ya feet
Fuck a receipt, I ain't gon' check up on you
See I trust you to the fullest for you, I'd take a bullet
Said it meant the world, thought I had found the perfect woman
'Cause she kept me coming 24/7
Swear it was like heaven when we made love
Thank the Lord above, you all mine at all time
Believe you got that sunshine
Her heart and mind is open just as much as my nose is
You said you wanted one kid I told you three or four of 'em
Maybe a couple more of 'em, add to the collection
Real big ol' house on the hill honey girl we want you
You might also like
If you tell me how you feel
Go and break up with your ex
I'll be more than happy to set up shop
Since we already had sex, might as well finish the rest
Yeah, I know you love what I'm tellin' ya
He don't spend time wit' ya, wine and dine wit' ya
He don't even go out in public wit' you, he fuckin' wit' you
You better see the light and come over here tonight
Turn you loose on some vodka and juice, a'ight?
The way I kick it see it's better than Bruce, a'ight?
And when I've finished we can grab us a deuce, aight?

You said now he ain't worth a shit, drink the liquor
Every time I call you on the phone with the nigga
Keep on playin' it off your heart's soft smile when you see him
Let him know you need him, you know you ain't gon' leave him
Try to reach him by beeping him but his pager be at home
'Cause he creepin' while you sleepin'
And that's the reason you weepin' and carryin' on
Herringbone he bought you he took it back
Gave it to some other little heffa that you ain't like but that's life
You ain't his wife yet still you wanna be
Going back to some waters when you need to be with me
See it's all about letting go of this ho, girl stop your crying
The easy way to do this, you knew this but see, you kept trying
Lying to yourself I ain't deaf, heard you wanted inside
I caught a vibe from the day you started hollerin' at Marl'
What's the problem? I can solve 'em if you're down
See I ain't no Brandy I come in handy when it's just a rebound
