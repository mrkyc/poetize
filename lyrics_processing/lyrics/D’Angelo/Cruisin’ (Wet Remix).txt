Baby, let's cruise away from here
Don't be confused, baby, the way is clear
And if you want it, you got it forever
Oh, this is not a one night stand, baby

Let the music take your mind
And just release and you will find, baby

We're going to fly away
Glad you're going my way
I love it when we're cruisin' together
Music was made for love
Cruisin' is made for love
I love it when we're cruisin' together

Baby, tonight belongs to us
Everything's right, do what you must baby
And inch by inch we get closer and closer
Every little part of each other, ooh baby, baby

Let the music take your mind
Just release and you will find, baby

Music was made for love
Ayy, oh, ooh baby
I love it, I love it
Oh yeah
Glad you're going my way
Hey hey
Oh oh oh, ayy
Made for love
Oh ooh, cruise with me, baby

Oh baby, let's cruise, let's float, let's glide
Let's open up and go inside
And if you want it you got it forever
I can just stay there inside you and love you, baby

Let the music take your mind
And just release and you will find, baby

We're going to fly away
Glad you're going my way
I love it when we're cruisin' together
Music was made for love
Cruisin' is made for love
I love it when we're cruisin' together
We're going to fly away
Glad you're going my way
I love it when we're cruisin' together
Music was made for love
Cruisin' is made for love
I love it when we're cruisin' together
Oh, we're gonna fly
Oh yeah, oh yeah, baby
I love, yeah
Music is made for love
Love it, love it when we cruise baby
Come on, baby
Music was made for love, hey baby
We're gonna fly away
Oh baby, come in, come on and cruise with me baby
When we cruise, hey baby
