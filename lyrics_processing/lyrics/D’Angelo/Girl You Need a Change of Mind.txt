Baby, (Let me tell you) girl you need a change of mind

Why march in picket lines? Ooh
Burn bras and carry signs? Ooh, oh, oh
Now, I'm for women's rights
I just want equal nights

Oh baby, (Yeah) girl, you need a change of mind
Oh, oh baby, girl, you need a change of mind

All men don't discriminate (Well, what you say?)
This man emancipates
And I won't chain you up
Just fill your loving cup
Oh, hey, hey, you need me

Nothing challenging
Hey, hey, I know you need me, I know you need me
