My father told me not to fight
But in my heart there is such a hurry for you girl
I feel the earth is moving, moving
I said
Get out the of the way
It's so hot tonight
When you're out of the way
It's gonna be all right
I feel the heat on my skin, it's crawling
Come over here and take me down
Don't try to tell me you don't love me anymore
(I don't love you anymore)
I feel the heart is beating, beating
I said
Get out the of the way
It's so hot tonight
When you're out of the way
Everything's gonna be alright
It's gonna be all right
