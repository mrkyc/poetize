If you want to make love to me
You've got to get down on your knees
I said, Baby, baby, please
You've got to give me some release
If you want to make love all night, well
That would be all right
I don't want to play hide and seek
You've got to get down on your knees
Sometimes when I want you
I really, really want you
I'd do anything
To get you on your knees
If you want to make love to me
You've got to get down on your knees
(I said)
Get on your knees and pray
True love is gonna come your way
If you want to make love outside
Oh, baby, that would be so nice
Baby, baby, please
You know you've got me on my knees
