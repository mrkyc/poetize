Lilli Rose eat your heart out
So Lilli Rose eat your heart out
Dirty jeans, dirtier mouth
Lilli Rose eat your heart out
At the speed of light
I don't wanna know where your heart goes
I don't wanna die out of your throes
I don't wanna know where the wind blows
I don't wanna know where your heart goes
I don't wanna lose you
So don't skip town
Don't wanna lose you
Won't you stay around
Don't wanna lose you
But I never really had you before
Lilli Rose eat your heart out
Lilli Rose eat your heart out
Oh Lilli Rose eat your heart out
Pretty dark and city bright
Lilli Rose eat your heart out
Creature of the night
I don't wanna know where your heart goes
I don't wanna know where the wind blows
I don't wanna lose you
So don't skip town
Don't wanna lose you
Won't you stay around
Don't wanna lose you
But I never really had you before
I don't wanna lose you
So don't skip town
Don't wanna lose you
Won't you stay around
Don't wanna lose you
But I never really had you before
Well I don't wanna know where your heart goes
I don't wanna know where the wind blows
I don't wanna die out of your throes
I don't wanna know where your heart goes
I don't wanna lose you
So don't skip town
Don't wanna lose you
Won't you stay around
Don't wanna lose you
But I never really had you before
I don't wanna lose you
So don't skip town
Don't wanna lose you
Won't you stay around
Don't wanna lose you
But I never really had you before
Oh Lilli Rose eat your heart out
Lilli Rose eat your heart out
Lilli Rose eat your heart out
