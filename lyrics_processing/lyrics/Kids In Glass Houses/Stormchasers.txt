That fit me like a second skin
I tried to run away from tomorrow
I can run away from tomorrow
And all your patience
All your wasted patience
As virtuous as you are blind
I tried to run away from tomorrow
I can run away from tomorrow
Share my silence
Share my awkward silence
There's comfort in an old routine
Tried to run away from tomorrow
I can run away from tomorrow
Beg forgiveness
Just another mistress
Waiting on a diamond ring
Tried to run away from tomorrow
I can run away from tomorrow
Now everybody's moving (on)
And everything I knew is (gone)
Oh, talk to the storms I've been chasing
Don't know which direction to face in
Now everybody's moving on
And everything I knew is gone
These hurricanes that I've swallowed
With nothing left for tomorrow
You might also likeWhat d'you think that you'd say?
I like it better this way
Don't you know some storms are worth the wait?
And I swear I'll change
I'm like the weather that way
Don't you know some storms are worth the rain?
The rain
Now everybody's moving (on)
And everything I knew is (gone)
Oh, talk to the storms I've been chasing
Don't know which direction to face in
Now everybody's moving on
And everything I knew is gone
These hurricanes that I've swallowed
With nothing left for tomorrow
(Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh.)
Now everybody's moving on
And everything I knew is gone
Oh, do you talk to the storms I've been chasing?
Never know which direction to face in
Now everybody's moving on
And everything I knew is gone
These hurricanes that I've swallowed
With nothing left for tomorrow
(Ooh, ooh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh.)
With nothing left for tomorrow (Ooh, ooh.)
Nothing in my way, nothing in my way
