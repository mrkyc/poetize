Found love I can't live without it
I just feel so good here in black and blue
I found love in a dirty bed
I found love, I'd be dumb to play it
I just can't go on with nothing to lose
I found love on a chewed up neck
I found love, I can't spit it out and
I just can't go on, all I taste is you
And if you wanna drive me out my mind
If you wanna see the things inside
Just say whenever, boy
Just say whenever, girl
And if you wanna drive me out my mind
Baby, come with me, let's go outside
Just say whenever, boy
Just say whenever, girl
I found love in a pretty face
I found love that I can't return
It's not something I'm proud of, call me a fool
They sell love in a neon maze
They sell love that you can't afford
It's not something you feel
It's something you do
All these things I know
And if you wanna drive me out my mind
If you wanna see the things inside
Just say whenever, boy
Just say whenever, girl
And if you wanna drive me out my mind
Baby, come with me, let's go outside
Just say whenever, boy
Just say whenever, girl
We want it now, we want it now, we want it now
We want it
We want it now, we want it now, we want it now
