'Cause I know that I'm the one to blame
(Shaking in the shadows, shaking in the shadows, shaking in the shadows, shaking in the shadows)
And we're so busy healing
That we don't even notice our new pain
(Shaking in the shadows, shaking in the shadows, shaking in the shadows, shaking in the shadows)
So one more time with feeling, one more time with feeling
(Shaking in the shadows, shaking in the shadows, shaking in the shadows, shaking in the shadows)
'Cause the things you said weren't much to speak of
But the way you said them was
We're singing peace in the valley and sex in my soul
Death to my body, bury me in rock and roll
Peace in the valley and sex in my soul
Death to my body, bury me in rock and roll
You say I drink away my feelings
As I watch all yours go up in flames
(Shaking in the shadows, shaking in the shadows, shaking in the shadows, shaking in the shadows)
You might also like'Cause we're so scared of sleepiing
'Cause we know were strangers when we wake
(Shaking in the shadows, shaking in the shadows, shaking in the shadows, shaking in the shadows)
Just one more night of dreaming
(Shaking in the shadows, shaking in the shadows, shaking in the shadows, shaking in the shadows)
We're singing peace in the valley and sex in my soul
Death to my body but we made it rock and roll
Peace in the valley and sex in my soul
Death to my body, bury me in rock and roll
(Shaking in the shadows, shaking in the shadows, shaking in the shadows, shaking in the shadows)
We're singing peace in the valley and sex in my soul
Death to my body, bury me in rock and roll
Peace in the valley and sex in my soul
Death to my body, bury me in rock and roll
Peace in the valley and sex in my soul
Death to my body, bury me in rock and roll
Peace in the valley and sex in my soul
Death to my body, bury me in rock and roll
