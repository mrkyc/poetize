The devil in your throat and in your thighs
A pocket full of notes, a head of lies
Is no good for you
Wrestle with the questions in your head
Fumble with the stranger in your bed
Condemn it to the great abyss instead
Whatever suits you
Cause in the dark we do our worst
Turn the lights out, turn the lights out
You'll be my last, I'll be your first
Turn the lights out, baby, turn the lights out
Lay down slowly
Don't you fool me
Cause I don't wanna be alone tonight
The best is yet to come
The best is yet to come
It finished with the stars in your eyes
Jesus on your breath and in your bite
Listen to the pleading and the cries
Make a chorus of you
Wrestle with the questions in your head
They interrupt your sleep and fill your bed
F*ck yourself into the record books instead
It's what you were born to do
Cause in the dark we do our worst
Turn the lights out, turn the lights out
You'll be my last, I'll be your first
Turn the lights out, baby, turn the lights out
Lay down slowly
Don't you fool me
Cause I don't wanna be alone tonight
The best is yet to come now baby
Don't be hasty
Cause I don't wanna be alone tonight
The best is yet to come
The best is yet to come
The promises, the promises we made
Another great, another great mistake
A little love, a little bit more hate
It's just about as much as I can take
The promises, the promises we made
Another great, another great mistake
A little love, a little bit more hate
It's just about as much as I can take
The promises, the promises we made
Another great, another great mistake
A little love, a little bit more hate
It's just about as much as I can take
Lay down slowly
Don't you fool me
Cause I don't wanna be alone tonight
The best is yet to come now baby
Don't be hasty
Cause I don't wanna be alone tonight
The best is yet to come
The best is yet to come
