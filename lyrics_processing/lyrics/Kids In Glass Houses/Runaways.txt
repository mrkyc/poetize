We'll be gone before you wake
Let all the stars beneath you shine
People call us the runaways
And we're gone before you wake (before you wake!)
Let all the stars beneath you shine
And all I wanna see is a world
Is a world that belongs to me
And all I wanna be is your world, is your world
Another runaway
Another runaway
Another runaway ay ay ay ay , another runaway
You can call us the runaways
We'll be gone before too long
Let all the stars beneath ignite
But I would never leave you
I could never leave you
I'm lying when I'm on my back
But I would never leave you
I could not deceive you
I'm lying when I'm on my back
And all I wanna see is a world
Is a world that belongs to me
And all I wanna be is your world, is your world
Another runaway
Another runaway
Another runaway ay ay ay ay
You can't stop us now 'cause we keep on running
Stop us now 'cause we keep on running
Stop us now 'cause we keep on running on
You can't stop us now 'cause we keep on running
Stop us now 'cause we keep on running
Stop us now 'cause we keep on running on
And all I wanna see is a world
Is a world that belongs to me
And all I wanna be is your world, is your world
Another runaway
Another runaway
Another runaway ay ay ay ay
You can't stop us now 'cause we keep on running
Stop us now 'cause we keep on running
Stop us now 'cause we keep on running on and on and on and on
You can't stop us now 'cause we keep on running
Stop us now 'cause we keep on running
