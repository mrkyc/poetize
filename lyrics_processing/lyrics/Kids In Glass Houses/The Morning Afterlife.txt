Or see the good in both of us
When we came with love and left with lust
When we came with lies we've learnt to trust
Give me good reason to believe in all I do and all I see
And all I see
We slip into something more comfortable
They like you best when you are vulnerable
Just when you thought the world was yours
When you thought you had it all
Just when you thought you'd done enough to get
You through the night
The night, night
Just when you thought the world was yours
When you thought you had it all
Just when you thought you'd done enough to get
You through the night
The night, night
The night, night
The night, night
Give me one good reason why I should trust
In all these things that turn to dust
When we beg we get down on our knees
When we're full we want to be empty
You loved the chase til it slowed down
You loved the hunt til it hit town
Til it hit town
Slip into something invincible
Just when you thought the world was yours
Just when you thought you had it all
Just when you thought you'd done enough to get
You through the night
The night, night
Just when you thought the world was yours
Just when you thought you had it all
Just when you thought you'd done enough to get
You through the night
The night, night
The night, night
The night, night
Who do you trust when all I know is at home in
All the wars?
And I've been somewhere, I've been somewhere
Who do you turn to when the best of everyone you
Knew has turned on you?
I've been somewhere, I've been somewhere
Just when you thought the world was yours
Just when you thought you had it all
Just when you thought you'd done enough to get
You through the night, night
Just when you thought the world was yours
Just when you thought you had it all
Just when you thought you'd done enough night, night
Just when you thought the world was yours
Just when you thought you had it all
Just when you thought you'd done enough to get
You through the night
The night, night
Just when you thought the world was yours
Just when you thought you had it all
Just when you thought you'd done enough night, night
Just when you thought the world was yours
Just when you thought you had it all
Just when you thought you'd done enough to get
You through the night
