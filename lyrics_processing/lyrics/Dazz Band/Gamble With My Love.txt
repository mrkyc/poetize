You never start to think
I could be lonely, all by myself
And though you say you care
You never start to share
Oh, one moment with me
I'm in so much misery
(Are you playing around?)
Don't ever take my love for granted
(Are you playing around?)
Don't pile your chips too high on me
(Are you playing around?)
You're almost sure to be a loser
Tired of being by myself
Guess I'll find me someone who won't
(Gamble) Gamble
(Gamble with my love) My love
(Never leave me lonely)
Hey baby, don't gamble with my love, yeah
(Don't, don't gamble) Don't
(Gamble with my love) My love
(Never leave me lonely) Lonely, hey
(Lonely) Don't gamble, baby
You might also likeGambling's not for me
I guess I cast my chips on the wrong love
Yeah, baby (Cast my chips on the wrong love)
If it's a crime to love you
I'd gladly do my time
Just to be with you
For the rest of my life
(Are you playing around?)
Don't ever take my love for granted
(Are you playing around?)
Don't pile your chips too high on me
(Are you playing around?)
You're almost sure to be a loser
Tired of being by myself
Guess I'll find me someone who won't
(Gamble) Gamble
(Gamble with my love) My love
(Never leave me lonely)
Hey lady, don't gamble with my love, yeah
(Don't, don't gamble) Don't
(Gamble with my love) My love
(Never leave me lonely)
Hey baby, I'll find me someone else to love
(Gamble) Don't
(Gamble with my love) With my love
(Never leave me lonely)
Don't gamble, baby, baby
(Don't, don't gamble) Don't
(Gamble with my love) My love
(Never leave me lonely)
I'm gonna find me someone else to love
(Cashing in my chips this time, gonna wait)
Girl, don't leave me sad and lonely
(Don't gamble)
You know you're my one and only
(Cashing in my chips this time, gonna wait)
Don't throw in my love and fold it
(Don't gamble)
After all it took to know me
(Don't, don't gamble) Don't
(Gamble with my love) With my love
(Never leave me lonely)
Hey lady, don't gamble with my love
(Gamble) Don't
(Gamble with my love) My love
(Never leave me lonely)
Don't gamble, gamble
(So) Don't
(Gamble with my love) My love
(Never leave me lonely)
