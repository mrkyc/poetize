When I need motivation
My one solution is my queen
Cause she stay strong (yeah, yeah)
She is always in my corner
Right there when I want her
All these other girls are tempting
But I'm empty when you're gone
And they say

Do you need me
Do you think I'm pretty
Do I make you feel like cheating?
And I'm like no, not really cause

Oh I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her
Oh I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her

She walks like a model
She grants my wishes like a genie in a bottle (say, yeah yeah)
Cause I'm the wizard of love
And I got the magic wand
All these other girls are tempting
But I'm empty when you're gone
