A million miles away and I'm still thinking 'bout my baby
Ain't misbehaving, no, you don't need to worry
I'm having a good time, oh oh
And I've had one too many, but you're the only one on my mind
Oh oh ah ah
3 am, my phone is dead, I'm acting like a dang fool
We're singing "We Found Love" and jumping into swimming pools
Yeah, I had a good time, oh oh
And I've had one too many, but you're the only one on my mind

Oh, but I, know that I
Can be wild sometimes
Oh, but I never lie
Cause I'm yours, you're mine
But I ain't misbehaving, no
I ain't misbehaving tonight

Everyone around me is just kissing on somebody
But I'm just dancing by myself around the lobby
I'm having a good time, oh oh
And I've had two too many, but I'm just doing this to pass the time

Oh, but I, know that I
Can be wild sometimes
Oh, but I never lie
Cause I'm yours, you're mine
But I ain't misbehaving, no
I ain't misbehaving tonight

But I wonder, are you out there thinking of me?
Is it stupid that I'm asking "Do you miss me?"
Are you behaving? Cause I'm saving all my love for you
And I'm having a good time, but I'd rather be with you
A million miles away but I'm still thinking 'bout my baby
Ain't misbehaving, no, you don't need to worry

Oh, but I, know that I
Can be wild sometimes
Oh, but I never lie
Cause I'm yours, you're mine
But I ain't misbehaving, no
I ain't misbehaving
Told you I ain't misbehaving, no
I ain't misbehaving
I've had way too many
