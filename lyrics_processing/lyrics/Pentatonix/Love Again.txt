Taste the pain right on my tongue
Novocaine to make me numb
Don't you worry 'cause the night is young
Dance until the morning sun
Morning sun
Morning sun
Morning morning morni-ni-ni-ni-ni-ning

I am at a loss for words
Can't believe I let you pull me down to this place
You stole my heart and soul
Just to think that I had dried those tears from your face
I played such a foolish game
Feelin' you were everything to me and more
I don't mean to point the blame
But, baby, you hurt me to my very core

You don't know why
You don't know how
You don't know when to love again
You let me in then shut me out
You'll have to learn to love again

Take me away from here (Take me away)
To a place where my feelings don't go to waste (From here)
We were in the atmosphere (We were here)
Flying high above the stars that shone in your face (The atmosphere)
So I'm running running baby from this hurting that you've given me (Runnin', runnin', I'm)
All through the night (Runnin' through the night)
Are we dancin' baby dancin' so your pretty face is hard to see (Dancin', dancin', babe)
Tonight, tonight, tonight (Dancin' through the night)

You don't know why
You don't know how
You don't know when to love again
You let me in then shut me out
You'll have to learn to love again

Taste the pain right on my tongue
