Telling me that you ain't fly
Unless you own a private jet
Telling me you ain't worth the time
If you ain't made a million yet
Fame, money and the finer things
Called you up a new following
Addicted to the quantity
Want that international love

Don't you know that everything you've ever wanted
Doesn't have a price tag on it?
Earn it first, don't have to flaunt it
What you've got is something flawless

Wait a minute (La la la la), first things first (La la la la)
Take a second (La la la la), first things first (La la la la)
Wait a minute (La la la la), first things first (La la la la)
Take a second (La la la la), first things first (La la la la)

Running and you don't know why (why)
Once you learn how to build your own track
It'll take you to the finish line
Fame, money and the VIP (VIP)
That don't mean nothing to me (nothing to me)
Not saying you should work for free
Just don't forget how to love

Don't you know that everything you've ever wanted
Doesn't have a price tag on it?
Earn it first, don't have to flaunt it
