Tell me, am I going crazy? (Uh huh)
Tell me, have I lost my mind? (Yeah)
Am I just afraid of loving? (Uh huh)
Or am I not the loving kind? (Yeah)

Kissing in the moonlight, movies on a late night
Getting old (Uh huh)
I've been there, done that
Supposed to be hot but it's just cold (yeah)
Somebody wake up my heart, light me up
Set fire to my soul, yeah (uh huh)
Cause I can't do it anymore (yeah)

Gimme that can't sleep love (Gimme that can't sleep)
I want that can't sleep love (Gimme that can't sleep)
The kind I dream about all day
The kind that keeps me up all night
Gimme that can't sleep love (Yeah)
