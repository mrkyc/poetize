Maybe I
Got just a little too much pride
To let you back into my life
You think I miss you
Not yet, not yet
Maybe you
Thought about what you put me through
A sorry is long overdue
You want it again
I bet, I, I, I bet

So cry, cry, baby, I already let you go
Bye bye, baby, I don't mess with you no mo'
Nah, nah, baby, just because I'm movin' on

Don't you 'member back in the day
When all you had to do was
Say yes
But you walked away
You made your bed, you know the rest
Now you want me to say yes
I did you right, but you went and left
You think this is a game
You ain't gon' win 'cause I'm the ref
