It's 10 past 2, still up thinking of you
If I showed you all I really want to
Would you stay, dare push me away
I just can't pretend anymore

Timid heart, hide my scars
Make me stronger (ooohhh)

I can't take this any longer (any longer)
I need, I need you like water (like water)
It's on the tip of my tongue ( tip of my tongue)
I'm not asking for much (ooohhh ooohhh)
Just your loving, not another (not another)
Cause your embrace keeps me warmer (keeps me warmer)
Could I tell you this time
How I wish you were mine
I wish you were mine

My voice cracks, I wait for it to pass
Heart beats fast with words I can't take back
And so I pray I don't drive you away
Cause I'm scared of what I have to tell you

I can't take this any longer (any longer)

Just your loving, not another (not another)
Cause your embrace keeps me warmer (keeps me warmer)
Could I tell you this time
How I wish you were mine

I'll take you higher, take you high
I can make you come alive
Open your eyes, change your mind
I'll take you higher, take you high
Ohhhhhh
