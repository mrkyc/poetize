Many I love yous I've wasted
Guess I didn't understand it well
It wasn't the truth but it felt right
All the tears that I have tasted
I knew they were not always justified
This weakness seem to serve me right
Many of us are pretending
To be the people that we aren't
Like a wolf in sheep's clothing
Left in the dark without a sight
Of anything but pieces of broken heart
Now we sleep with one open eye

Everybody wants the truth but no one wants to be honest
Everybody gets confused between the evil and righteous
Everybody wants the truth but no one wants to be honest
And we're all standing between the evil and righteous

If I told you that I'm sorry
Would you tell me that you understand
Or would you indulge in my own guilt?
'Cause we're sensitive 
There is no innocence told in this world
Paid for less than that I have learned
Many come to know the secret
Of the goodness and divine
Playing God and preaching mortals
And who knows where we go from here
If there is an afterlife for us
If there's hell, if there is heaven
You might also like
Everybody wants the truth but no one wants to be honest
Everybody gets confused between the evil and righteous
Everybody wants the truth but no one wants to be honest
And we're all standing between the evil and righteous

Thin lines between our heads and our hearts
There's more than just what's wrong or right
Why we need to redefine
The changes from your side of mind

Everybody wants the truth but no one wants to be honest
Everybody gets confused between the evil and righteous
Everybody wants the truth but no one wants to be honest
And we're all standing between the evil and righteous
