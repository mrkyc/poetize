It's all in your mind, in your mind

I don't want to believe
And I don't want to live
By the excuses of your weakness
'Cause a woman should do
What she wants to do
There is no reason
For your shallow aggravation

Nothing wrong with this dress I wear
Nothing wrong with this smile I dare
Nothing wrong with my long black hair
It's all in your mind, in your mind
Nothing wrong with this legs you see
Nothing wrong with this lean body
And nothing wrong with the woman in me
It's all in your mind, in your mind

I just want to be sure
Don't want anymore
You're calling out names
Oh, what a shame
Just open your mind
Then maybe you'll find
That there's no reason
For your shallow aggravation
You might also like
Nothing wrong with this dress I wear
Nothing wrong with this smile I dare
Nothing wrong with my long black hair
It's all in your mind, in your mind
Nothing wrong with this legs you see
Nothing wrong with this lean body
And nothing wrong with the woman in me
It's all in your mind, in your mind

Nothing wrong with this dress I wear
Or this smile I dare
It's all in your mind, in your mind
This legs you see, this lean body
It's only what you see in your mind
It's only what you see in your mind
It's only in your mind
This is the time to change your mind
There's still a chance to change your mind
It's plain to see from anywhere that
The only thing wrong is your irritating mind

Nothing wrong with this dress I wear
Nothing wrong with this smile I dare
Nothing wrong with my long black hair
It's all in your mind, in your mind
Nothing wrong with this legs you see
Nothing wrong with this lean body
Nothing wrong with the woman in me
It's all in your mind, in your mind
Nothing wrong with this dress I wear
Nothing wrong with this smile I dare
Nothing wrong with my long black hair
It's all in your mind, in your mind
Nothing wrong with this legs you see
Nothing wrong with this lean body
Nothing wrong with the woman in me
It's all in your mind, in your mind
Nothing wrong with this dress I wear
Nothing wrong with this smile I dare
Nothing wrong with my long black hair
It's all in your mind, in your mind
Nothing wrong with this legs you see
Nothing wrong with this lean body
Nothing wrong with the woman in me
