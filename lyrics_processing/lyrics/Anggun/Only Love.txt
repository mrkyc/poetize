Everyone playing roles each day and night
Searching for a missing piece
Time can always tell the truth
And mask the face of a lonely heart
Thinking eyes, wonder what they really see
Dreams of gold or glory?
Something out there to believe
To tell the tale through the night

All I'm looking for is only love
There is only love that I need
What I'm looking for is only love
There is only love that I see
Nothing is worth fighting, only love
There is only love that makes me bleed
Nothing is worth living, only love
There is only love that makes me breathe

Wondering and like everybody else
Visualizing a sign
Trials and errors still abide
Just hope that it won't hurt too bad
Wait and see, feed this patience on my mind
Leave it there until he comes
'Cause someone's out there, I believe
Has a missing piece of my heart

La la la la la, la la la
La la la la, la la la (it's only love)
La la la la la, la la la
La la la la, la la la, mmh....
La la la la, makes me bleed
Ah, sure, it's only love
Ooh, ooh ooh ooh
It's only love
La la la la la, la la la
La la la la, la la la (ooh)

There is only love that I see (it's only love)
Nothing is worth fighting, only love
There is only love that makes me bleed
