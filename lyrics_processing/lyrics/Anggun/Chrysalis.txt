Like a tiger
Know how to lure you with my feline touch
A trouble spider
Can make a trap to catch the one I want
But fine as a white dove
I'd do anything for the one I love
To get that one kiss
I'll wait patiently like a chrysalis

Just remember that I can be strong and tender
Just remember and beware

'Cause I know the way to break your heart
The way to tell a lie like you do
Oh, yes, I know the way to make you cry
The way to give you doubts like you do

Satisfy me (satisfy me)
Want you to treat me like I'm the queen bee
The woman in me (the woman in me)
Just like a wild horse, I need to run free
Like a butterfly (like a butterfly)
I can be sweet and very infantile
A viper (a viper), a cobra (a cobra)
I also can be viciously unkind
You might also like
Just remember that I can be strong and tender
Just remember and beware

'Cause I know the way to break your heart
The way to tell a lie like you do
Oh, yes, I know the way to make you cry
The way to give you doubts like you do
I know the way to break your heart
The way to tell a lie like you do
Oh, yes, I know the way to make you cry
The way to give you doubts like you do

I know
Just remember I can do what you do
I know
Just remember and beware

I know, I know the way to break your heart
The way to tell a lie like you do
'Cause I know the way to break your heart
The way to tell a lie like you do (like you do)
Oh, yes, I know the way to make you cry
The way to give you doubts like you do
I know the way to break your heart
The way to tell a lie like you do
Oh, yes, I know the way to make you cry
The way to give you doubts like you do
I know the way to break your heart
The way to tell a lie like you do
Oh, yes, I know the way to make you cry
The way to give you doubts like you do
I know the way to break your heart
The way to tell a lie like you do
Oh, yes, I know the way to make you cry
