Down came a blackbird
Set on a fence
Talking in riddles
Making no sense
Cause she's gone
You're baby's gone
Down came a blackbird
Perched on pole
Took out a mirror
And said, "Son, behold"
Cause she's gone
Your baby's gone

Gone like a dollar spent on a drink
Head hanging over the kitchen sink
Gone like the wind through a cabin door
Never gonna blow that way no more
Gone like the song of a mockingbird
Laughing at every little thing he heard
Gone like a dream in a puff of smoke
She ain't coming back
And it ain't no joke
She's gone
Your baby's gone
You might also like
Down came a blackbird
Set by the fire
Said the future's coming at you
Like a freight train
And you're walking a wire
Cause she's gone
You're baby's gone

Gone like a dollar spent on a drink
Head hanging over the kitchen sink
Gone like a dream in a puff of smoke
She ain't coming back
And it ain't no joke
She's gone
Your baby's gone

She says she doesn't want a man
Who hangs around the house
Who doesn't say a word
Unless he's shooting off his mouth
There's got to be a better way
To be a lovin' wife
If she stays here
She'll end up her waitress for life
Down came a blackbird
Set on a fence
Talking in riddles
And making absolutely perfect sense
Cause she's gone
Your baby's gone

Gone like a dollar spent on a drink
Head hanging over the kitchen sink
Gone like the wind through a cabin door
Never gonna blow that way no more
Gone like the song of a mockingbird
Laughing at every little thing he heard
Gone like a dream in a puff of smoke
She ain't coming back
And it ain't no joke
She's gone
Your baby's gone
Down came a blackbird
