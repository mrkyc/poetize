Ya think you got it all wrapped up
Lyin' in the shade of the sycamore tree
Sorry, but it just ain't enough
You gotta do better than talk a big talk
Or an occasional courtesy call
I ain't seen roses and I ain't seen a thing
Of what love's got to do with it all
If you wanna steal a kiss
Then you've gotta steal a piece of my heart
You're a pretty little boy, but a fumblin' fool
If you're goin' for a tumble in the dark
My oh my have you got a lot to learn
You've gotta wrap me up in romance
Before you crash and burn
And if you never call me to blow my heart away
Yippy ky yay
(Yippy yippy yippy yippy yippy ky yay
Yippy yippy yippy ky yo
You wanna dance to the rhythm of a country girl
Boy you gotta long way to go)
Would it hurt so much to open my door
Or send me a flower or two
'Cause I believe in love like a good book says
Not the gospel according to you
You might also likeYou can't two-step around step number one
And then skip down to three and four
You can't touch me with a ten-foot pole
'Till you back off a little bit more
If you wanna steal a kiss
Then you've gotta steal a piece of my heart
You're a pretty little boy, but a fumblin' fool
If you're goin' for a tumble in the dark
My oh my have you got a lot to learn
You've gotta wrap me up in romance
Before you crash and burn
And if you never call me to blow my heart away
Yippy ky yay
(Yippy yippy yippy yippy yippy ky yay
Yippy yippy yippy ky yo
You wanna dance to the rhythm of a country girl
Boy you gotta long way to go)
I know what you want
And there are times I want it too
But I'm lookin' for a gentleman
Who knows just what to do
And I can take the boots and jeans
And even your beat-up Cadillac
But when it comes to what a women needs
You ain't no Cary Grant
My oh my have you got a lot to learn
You've gotta wrap me up in romance
Before you crash and burn
And if you never call me to blow my heart away
Yippy ky yay
(Yippy yippy yippy yippy yippy ky yay
Yippy yippy yippy ky yo
You wanna dance to the rhythm of a country girl
