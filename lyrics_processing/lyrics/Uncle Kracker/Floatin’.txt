She got pieces of confetti from a show last Friday night
Takes her too long to get ready but it's worth it every time
Not a lot of clutter fluttering through her world or hanging on her walls

She loves Jesus 'cause he saved, George Stait 'cause he's the king
Her daddy 'cause he made her feel just like a queen

She's floatin', dreamin', bloomin' like a flower
She's dancin', smilin', yeah, the waves go right around her
She believes the unbelievable, to her life's like an ocean
While everybody's swimming she's just floatin'
(She's just floatin')

She's got a tattoo on a place let's say not everyone can see
Hall and Oates is screaming from the doors not on her Jeep
Not a lot of pictures mixing up emotions from her past

She loves Jesus 'cause he saved, George Stait 'cause he's the king
Her daddy 'cause he made her feel just like a queen

She's floatin', dreamin', bloomin' like a flower
She's dancin', smilin', yeah, the waves go right around her
She believes the unbelievable, to her life's like an ocean
While everybody's swimming she's just floatin'

Like a feather in the wind
Makes her feel the way she felt way back when she was ten
Rising like a single red balloon
High above the cloud, she ain't never comin' down

She loves Jesus 'cause he saved, George Stait 'cause he's the king
Her daddy 'cause he made her feel just like a queen

She's floatin', dreamin', bloomin' like a flower
She's dancin', smilin', yeah, the waves go right around her
She's floatin', dreamin', bloomin' like a flower
She's dancin', smilin', yeah, the waves go right around her
She believes the unbelievable, to her life's like an ocean
While everybody's swimming
Her life is like an ocean
