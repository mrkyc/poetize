Yo you dealin' with the X-Factor!
I got everything I ever wanted
And I'll never give that back
Well, I know you hate X-Factor, but you ain't gotta look at me like that
I said you ain't gotta look at me like that
What you lookin' at?
What you lookin' at?
What you lookin' at?
What you lookin' at?
You wanna rhyme pullin' stunts like that
See never in my life could I front like that
I ain't cut like that, I couldn't' run like that
I'ma keep it non-fiction and take my hat
Uhhh, Remember back when things looked grim
I spent a lot of money and time on whimps
I remember the crew, Remember the good times
Remember the orange and I'll remember the sunshine
It's all gone that's the thing of the past
The fact remains that it moves real fast
So while you sit around and hope things won't change
I'll be sittin' pretty singing Hey Pac Wait!

I'm apalled by the things you done
Left a trail of wrongs and can't account for one
I get done and I'm glad, but it's a shame you waste it
