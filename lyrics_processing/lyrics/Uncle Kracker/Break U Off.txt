I ain't looking for love, but I got plenty to give
You come around with a frown and you leave with a fat lip
I ain't shakin' but you can bet the heat's back
So keep that, keep that, believe that
No rights underneath my wrongs
I spend a lot of time where I don't belong
There to watch you fall, ain't a lot to ask
All I need is a match and a gallon of gas and I'm
I'll take you higher, baby
I'll take you higher, baby
I'm gonna set your lonely world
On fire, baby
