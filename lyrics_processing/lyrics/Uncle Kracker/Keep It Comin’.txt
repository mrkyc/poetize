Ain't it great to be alive
Ain't it great to breathe
Ain't it great to have hit songs hidden up my sleeve
I ain't silly and my songs ain't cute
I don't fly like a bird I just shine for loot... Uh!

You ain't supposed to run, you can tell them I said that
Quick from the get, you know my heart's where my head's at

Got em' all kinda hopin' I'll return their calls
And just when you thought that there was nothin' to see
You heard me comin' around the corner hummin' (Follow me)
And here I am, I'm live and direct
I'm makin' everybody wonder what I'm gonna do next
I don't flex because that's not my style
