I might walk a little funny, but my walk is me
I might stutter when I talk, but I say what I see
I don't agree with every other little thing that's proven
I do a lot of things that I shouldn't be doin'
I'll ruin everything you might have had in mind
I'm a consistent, belligerent, solidified find
Rhinestone freak, suburban star
I ain't got no money, and I got no car
I might make par if it don't take much
See I don't ride very far 'cause I ride on luck
I stay pretty stuck in a rut like I should
And I do it for the love of everything that's still good

I don't know why I come here
But I know I'll never leave
It's the only place I wanna be
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I don't know why I come here
But I know I'll never leave
It's the only place I wanna be
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I'm a long way gone, but I ain't short lived
I got deep, deep pockets that leak like a civ
I give 110 throughout the course of a night
And if I don't go home, then I did things right
I'd like to settle down, but I ain't that guy
'Cause everything I ever did I always did on the fly
I like to ride the wave, 'til the tide don't swell
I don't like cocaine, but I like the smell
I dwell in a place you might see unfit
But there ain't nothing you can ever say to make me give a shit
I stay pretty stuck in a rut like I should
And do it for the love of everything that's still good

I'd like to say that I don't do them bars
But my street called straight don't stretch too far uh huh
I'm on the move, goin' nowhere fast
And you can tell the whole world they can kiss my ass
I'll take a pass, be the last in line
And if it takes ten years, then I'mma be just fine
I saw the signs in the grass ain't green
I found love at the bottom of the bottle of Beam
See comin' clean just seemed so jaded
And bein' underrated is underrated
But I don't hate it, I stay stuck in a rut like I should
You know I do it for the love of everything that's still good

I don't know why I come here
But I know I'll never leave
