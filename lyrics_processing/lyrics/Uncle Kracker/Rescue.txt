Nothin' I could drink to help me drink you off my mind
And everywhere I looked
Oooooo I saw your face
And I wonder
And I wonder
If there still might be
A little space in your heart for me
'Cause I'm so cold
I'm so alone
And I miss you babe
(Chorus)
So won't you come to my rescue
Shake this pain from my soul
And take this fool back in your heart baby
I'll go crazy if you don't
'Cause I'm a mess here without you
Ain't no pill for this pain
So please, please come to my rescue baby
Make it right away
I was a fool to leave
Leave behind everything
That meant everything to me
Every day and night
Mmmmmm my heart pays the price

Stranded
Out here
On this lonely road
I'm so lost
Won't you lead me home
I need you back
Baby one more chance
And I miss you babe
(Chorus)
So won't you come to my rescue
Shake this pain from my soul
And take this fool back in your heart baby
I'll go crazy if you don't
'Cause I'm a mess here without you
Ain't no pill for this pain
So please, please come to my rescue baby
Make it right away
I'm drowning baby
I need you
To save me
I need you to save me, yeah
Don't leave me like this
Throw me a line, baby one more time
(Chorus)
So won't you come to my rescue
Shake this pain from my soul
And take this fool back in your heart baby
I'll go crazy if you don't
'Cause I'm a mess here without you
Ain't no pill for this pain
So please, please come to my rescue baby
Make it right away
Make it right away
