All those parties and games that all those people play
They tell me this is the place to be
All these beautiful people and nothing to see
Sometimes I feel like something is gone here
Something is wrong here, I don't belong here
Sometimes I feel like a stranger in town
And I've lost what I've found, it'll all turn around
In a little while I'll be thinking about you
In a little while I'll still be here without you
You never gave me a reason to doubt you
In a little while I'll be thinking about you baby
I'll be thinking about you baby
On the other side of a coin, there's a face
There's a memory somewhere that I can't erase
And there's a place that I'll find someday
But sometimes I feel like it's slipping away
Sometimes I feel like something is gone here
Something is wrong here, I don't belong here
Sometimes I feel like a stranger in town
And I've lost what I've found, it'll all turn around

In a little while I'll still be here without you
You never gave me a reason to doubt you
In a little while I'll be thinking about you
Some things are lost, some left behind
Some things are better left for someone else to find
Maybe in time, I can finally see
I just wonder, wonder if you think about me
Sometimes I feel like something is gone here
Something is wrong here, I don't belong here
Sometimes I feel like a stranger in town
And I've lost what I've found, It'll all turn around, yeah
In a little while, I'll be thinking about you
In a little while, I'll still be here without you
You never gave me a reason to doubt you
In a little while I'll be thinking about you baby
I'll be thinking about you baby
I'll be thinking about you baby
