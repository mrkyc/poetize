Shoobie-do wop
Bop Bop
Shoobie-do wop
Cigarettes and palm tree juice
In the middle of some place nice
Pop-up video greatest hits
Sippin' Miami Vice
A sunny day on MLK
In a Cadillac Coup Deville
You might not get down like that
But I know your sister will
She's talkin down 'n dirty
She's got an ass like Fergie
I know she's gonna hurt me
I do, I do
I celebrate when I'm up
I celebrate when I'm down
Not a care in this world
I'm celebratin' right now
NoI got nothin' to lose
I don't need no excuse
So anyway anyhow
I'm celebratin' right now
Bop Bop
Shoobie-do wop
Bop Bop
Shoobie-do wop
Tank top on a trampoline
Puts a tattoo on my heart
No stars in the limousine
Got 'em dancin' on the bar
Everywhere I go and show
An' they pat me on my back
Look me in the eye and say
Yo all your works kick like that
Don't stop like prohibition
My key's in your ignition
Don't mind my disposition
No, I, oh I
I celebrate when I'm up
I celebrate when I'm down
Not a care in the world
I'm celebratin' right now
No I got nothin' to lose
I don't need no excuse
So anyway anyhow
I'm celebratin' right now
Heyya
Oh AhhAhhh
Yeahhh
She's talkin down 'n dirty
She's got an ass like Fergie
I know she's gonna hurt me
I do, I do
I celebrate when I'm up
I celebrate when I'm down
Not a care in this world
I'm celebratin' right now
No I got nothin' to lose
I don't need no excuse
So anyway anyhow
I'm celebratin' right now
I celebrate when I'm up
I celebrate when I'm down
Not a care in this world
I'm celebratin' right now
No I got nothin' to lose
I don't need no excuse
So anyway anyhow
