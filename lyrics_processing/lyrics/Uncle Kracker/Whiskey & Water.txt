You put some whiskey in the water
Gonna run off with your daughter
And if I make it to the border
I'm gonna be alright
You put some whiskey in the water
Gonna run off with your daughter
And if I make it to the border
I'm gonna be alright
I'm on the run the devil's tryin' to get me
Says I met him at a pawn shop down in Mississippi
I was an angel lookin' for another face
I must a bumped my fuckin' head when I fell from grace
I found a place in the sun like Stevie
And now I gotta wonder cause the rain don't believe me
I need to breathe, take the money and run
I put my faith in one place and now I'm fuckin' done

You put some whiskey in the water
Gonna run off with your daughter
And if I make it to the border
I'm gonna be alright
You put some whiskey in the water
Gonna run off with your daughter
And if I make it to the border
I'm gonna be alright

I could a been a saint but I chose the wrong path
I ain't no dummy take the money and laugh
I got the cash, did the dash for the door
Now I'm sittin' on my stash and I'm feelin' like a whore
I'm torn but can't think, I blink so I miss
I move in strange ways, I move to dismiss
I'll leave this place and when I do that's it
I don't need to conclude so you can keep that shit

You put some whiskey in the water
Gonna run off with your daughter
And if I make it to the border
I'm gonna be alright
You put some whiskey in the water
Gonna run off with your daughter
And if I make it to the border
I'm gonna be alright

I'm headin' south on Old Whiskey Road
Livin' life like a story that doesn't need to be told
It's getting' old always runnin' from the past
I'm lookin' at myself in the bottom of a glass
I won't last, my lights too dim
I seen the future and it's lookin' pretty grim
I'm gonna win but not like that
So I'm takin' what I got and I ain't never comin' back
You put some whiskey in the water
Gonna run off with your daughter
And if I make it to the border
I'm gonna be alright
You put some whiskey in the water
Gonna run off with your daughter
And if I make it to the border
