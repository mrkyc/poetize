We've been lost in streets of neon and concrete-crete there
And somewhere up there is a sky full of stars, but we can't seem 'em enough, easy enough
Let's pack up and point this truck

Where the moon shines down on a little tin roof, two-room, cabin in the pines
And the only sound is just me and you settin' two hearts on fire
Let's move way out where the blacktop ends
Where it takes mud tires to get us into paradise
There's a little house and a better life, at the end of a four-wheel drive

We've been dreamin' of rollin' hills and front porch swingin'
And lazy days, where we can find a creek and dip our feet in slow, it's so cold
I can almost feel it girl, we gotta go

Where the moon shines down on a little tin roof, two-room, cabin in the pines
And the only sound is just me and you settin' two hearts on fire
Let's move way out where the blacktop ends
Where it takes mud tires to get us into paradise
There's a little house and a better life, at the end of a four-wheel drive

And in time, god-willin with a little bit of luck
We just might have some babies we can watch grow up
You might also like
Where the moon shines down on a little tin roof, two-room, cabin in the pines
And the only sound is just me and you settin' two hearts on fire
Let's move way out where the blacktop ends
Where it takes mud tires to get us into paradise
There's a little house and a better life, at the end of a four-wheel drive

Take me to the end of a four-wheel drive
Whoah, whoah, four-wheel drive
Whoah, whoah, at the end of a four-wheel drive
There's roaming hills and front-porch swinging
We'll find a creek where we can dip our feet in
Take me to the end of a four-wheel drive
