Cruising the outskirts of town
This old mustang is born to fly and never quit
So that's what i do with it
I'm thankful for days like today
Summer breeze takes my worries away
This days made to live it up and breathe it in
So that's what i do with it
I've been alone, been afraid
I've seen the dark
I've made it through I'm okay
I'm better for my scars
Life's a wheel let it roll
I want to know i survived for a chance
To swing for the fence
So when the pitch comes rolling in
That's what i do with it
There's a flag that i fly in my yard
I know the price paid for those stars
Its a flag made to fly high in the wind
Yea so that's what i do with it
Ive been alone, been afraid
Ive seen the dark
Ive made it through I'm okay
I'm better for my scars
Life's a wheel let it roll
I want to know i survived for a chance
To swing for the fence
So when the pitch comes rolling in
That's what i do with it

And sometimes they save us
So we can see how beautiful life is
Oh we can't forget
Ive been alone, been afraid
Ive seen the dark
Ive made it through I'm okay
I'm better for my scars
Life's a wheel let it roll
I want to know I survived for a chance
To swing for the fence
So when the pitch comes rolling in
That's what i do with it
That's what i do with it (2 times)
I've been alone, been afraid
I've seen the dark
I've made it through I'm okay (that's what I do with it)
Life's a wheel let it roll
I want to know (that's what I do with it)
Oh that's what i do with it
