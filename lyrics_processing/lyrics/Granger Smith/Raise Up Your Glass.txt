Could be a neon, its on, boys I got the first round
Could be a last second, Hail Mary, game-winning touchdown
Could be hittin' it off with the one that you're hittin' on
Turning the page, new day, finally moving on
Whatever it is, yeah whatever it is

Raise up your glass, and make a toast
To all of the times that mean the most
Go on and let your worries roll right off your back
Still got some memories left to make
A whole lotta shots left to take
So let's hold 'em high and live tonight like it's our last
Raise up your glass

Could be an old friend, where you been, tap a keg, let her pour
Could be a new job, new luck, new year's, pop a cork
Could be a buddy, deployed, last beer, 'fore you send him off
A bottle of Jack, tipped back, 'cause he's back home
Whatever it is, yeah whoever you're with

Raise up your glass, and make a toast
To all of the times that mean the most
Go on and let your worries roll right off your back
Still got some memories left to make
A whole lotta shots left to take
So let's hold 'em high and live tonight like it's our last
Raise up your glass
You might also like
Keep it up high, all night long
Drink it up 'till the last drop's gone
Turn it up, yeah crank that song, and sing along
Yeah

Raise up your glass, and make a toast
To all the times that mean the most
Go on and let your worries roll right off your back
We still got some memories left to make
A whole lotta shots left to take
So let's hold 'em high and live tonight like it's our last
Raise up your glass
