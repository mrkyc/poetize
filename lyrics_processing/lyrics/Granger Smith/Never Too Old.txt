You're never too old to find a two-lane road
See how fast that four by four can go
Burn the tread right off of them tires
You're never too old to turn the radio
Up so loud that the speakers blow
Let your neighbors know
That you're about to throw an all-nighter

Whoa, let's go
Tonight is the night
For the rest of our lives

Ain't ever too old to die young
Never too tall to grow up
Never too late to get to living
'Cause you're only given one
Never too good to be bad
Ain't ever too scared to be tough
Don't count them candles on the cake
Or the trip around the Sun

I ain't ever too old to die young, yeah
I ain't ever too old to die young, ooh, yeah
You might also like
Ain't ever too wise to get a little wild
Do something dumb, put some extra smile
That look on her face that you came by, it's money

Whoa, let's go
Tonight is the night
Yeah, for the rest of our lives

Ain't ever too old to die young
Never too tall to grow up
Never too late to get to living
'Cause you're only given one
Never too good to be bad
Ain't ever too scared to be tough
Don't count them candles on the cake
Or the trip around the Sun

I ain't ever too old to die young, mmm, yeah
I ain't ever too old to die young, mmm, yeah

Yeah, it could be tomorrow
Or the hundred years that follow
Who know when you're gonna go
I was right here tonight
We got nothing but time
It's living life, we're never too old
Whoa, whoa

Ain't ever too old to die young
Never too tall to grow up
No, you're never too late to get to living
'Cause you're only given one
Never too good to be bad
Ain't ever too scared to be tough
Don't count them candles on the cake
Or the trip around the Sun

Ain't ever too old to die young
Never too tall to grow up
No, you're never too late to get to living
'Cause you're only given one
Never too good to be bad
Ain't ever too scared to be tough
Don't count them candles on the cake
Or the trip around the Sun

I ain't ever too old to die young, whoa, whoa
I ain't ever too old to die young, whoa, yeah
Ain't ever too old to die young
