Hey DJ, hey sunset
Hey full moon creeping up over them pines in the distance
Hey summer breeze, hey two lane road
I got a girl that means the world to me and if you wanna help me let her know

Gimme something she can dance to
Throw up her hands to
Running through her hair falling down
Gimme something that'll take her breath away
And make her think that Heaven's right here right now
Something that'll get those eyes looking at me like
She's falling harder than the stars tonight
Anything to turn the space that's in between us into nothing
C'mon gimme something
Yeah

'Cause if it's the right song
In just the right light
That circle in the sky won't be the only thing getting high tonight
Nah
I don't need much
But I'm counting on you
To set the mood with a groove and a helluva view so I can make my move

Running through her hair falling down
Gimme something that'll take her breath away
And make her think that Heaven's right here right now
Something that'll get those eyes looking at me like
She's falling harder than the stars tonight
Anything to turn the space that's in between us into nothing
C'mon gimme something, yeah
Oh c'mon gimme something, yeah

I did the picking up, the driving out
The finding that spot nobody knows
So c'mon, c'mon, don't let me down
I don't wanna take her home

Gimme something she can dance to
Throw up her hands to
Running through her hair falling down
Gimme something that'll take her breath away
And make her think that Heaven's right here right now
Something that'll get those eyes looking at me like
She's falling harder than the stars tonight
Anything to turn the space that's in between us into nothing
C'mon gimme something, yeah
Oh c'mon gimme something, yeah
C'mon, gimme something
