Takes you couple more cranks these days, but it still hold up
Yeah, it still holds up
That 45, wax wailing song
Everytime it comes on, it might have a little crack, a little vinyl
But give it a little time and it will hit you down deep in the gut
It still holds up, still feels good
Still purring like a kitten, like a Detroit engine
Like a cold, glass bottle coke
And Mama cooking in the kitchen
Man, it never gets old
Like who I am, and where I'm from
Damn right, sure enough, it still holds up
Like Papa still looking at my Mama
Like he did back in '64
Even though he might be a little older
Every vow that he told her
It still holds up, still feels good
Still purring like a kitten, like a Detroit engine
Like a cold, glass bottle coke
And Mama cooking in the kitchen
Man, it never gets old
Like who I am, and where I'm from
Damn right, sure enough, it still holds up
Yeah, it still holds up
You might also likeSo I'm gonna keep on, holding that door
Holding her tight, treating her right
Gonna tell her that I love her, every day and night
Cause what we got
It still holds up, still feels good
Still purring like a kitten, like a Detroit engine
Like a cold, glass bottle coke
Like a wolf swinging from a live oak
It still holds up, still feels good
Still purring like a kitten, like a Detroit Agent
Like a code, glass bottle coke
And Mama cooking in the kitchen
Man, it never gets old
Like who I am, and where I'm from
Damn right, sure enough
It's like who I am, and where I'm from
It still holds up
