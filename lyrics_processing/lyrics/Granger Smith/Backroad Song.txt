Barbed-wire fence carving out a hillside
Cutting holes in the midday sun
Like a postcard framed in a windshield, covered in dust
I love the rhythm of an old grey blacktop
33's just whistling by
Steer the wheel, one-handed on a two-lane, hugging that line

I got the windows down
No one else around, singing

(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Freedom is the miles I'm rolling on
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Out here cruising to a backroad song
I feel the wheels like a melody
Like a radio dialing in strong
Come on, come on sing along, sing along
To my backroad song

(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)

I hit the brakes for an old New Holland
Hammer down and pass him on up
The breeze smells like a summertime hay field's just been cut

I got the windows down
Way out of town, singing

(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Freedom is the miles I'm rolling on
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Out here cruising to a backroad song
I feel the wheels like a melody
Like a radio dialing in strong
Come on, come on sing along, sing along
To my backroad song

(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)

The only way today could get better
Girl, what I'm thinking
Is I can pick you up, you slide in this truck
And I can hear you singing
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Let me hear you sing it
Ooh-ooh-ooh

(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Freedom is the miles I'm rolling on
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Out here cruising to a backroad song
I feel the wheels like a melody
Like a radio dialing in strong
Come on, come on sing along, sing along
To my backroad song
Come on, come on sing along, sing along
To my backroad song

This is my backroad song (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Feel the rhythm of it, feel the rhythm of it)
This is my backroad song (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Feel the rhythm of it, feel the rhythm of it)
Come on, come on, sing along (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Feel the rhythm of it, feel the rhythm of it)
To my backroad song (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
