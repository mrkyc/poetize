He's a greasy wrench turning on a big block Chevrolet
First in last out every day
He's a make a dollar, give a dollar, if you need me holler
Kinda good old boy
There's a single white trailer, couple acres on the edge of town
Front porch, sun going down
And that pretty thing swinging on the swing like a dream
Is wearing his ring

Don't you love it when the good guys win
Don't you love it when a ship comes in
Yeah man, every now and then
What goes around, comes around again
Don't you love a little long shot prayer
Underdog on a hell of a tear
He wants to kiss and she leans in
Don't you love it when the good guys win

She's a million dollar smile in a ten dollar kind of town
The kind that turns hard luck around
She's with him 'til the end, good or bad, thick or thin
Yeah, he's on a roll now

Don't you love it when a ship comes in
Yeah man, every now and then
What goes around, comes around again
Don't you love a little long shot prayer
Underdog on a hell of a tear
He wants to kiss and she leans in
Don't you love it when the good guys win
Yeah, when the good guys win

When the good guys win
Don't you love it when the good guys win
Don't you love it when the ship comes in
