I'm in the rut, baby, you're my doe in heat
Let's make a bet worth all these bags of feed
In the back of my truck
Yea I know just how to treat a girl
I can take you in the woods and sling shot squirrels
Take my old four wheeler for a whirl
Would you like that, baby?
If your can's running low on dip
Give me a kiss and I'll fill your lip
This country boy love is what you need
We can knock them boots and yell "yee yee"
All them city boys jealous of what they see
Cause they ain't loving like that, no
This country boy love is what you need
Like a 12 gauge pump can set you free
Once you taste these biscuits, that's so sweet
You ain't ever going back, no
We can battle for a buck on our first date
Get some mud on the truck or go hunt snakes
You'll get chiggers on your legs, but that's okay
I'll scratch 'em for you later
You might also likeI ain't got no candles or red wine
I got a beer and a catfish on the line
I pull him up, spill the guts and then
We'll fry him up for supper
After that, take my overalls off
But I'm leaving my boots on
This country boy love is what you need
We can knock them boots and yell "yee yee"
All them city boys jealous of what they see
Cause they ain't loving like that, no
This country boy love is what you need
Like a 12 gauge pump can set you free
Once you taste these biscuits, that's so sweet
You ain't ever going back, oh no
Yeah, two wheel drive or down four low
I can bump your back road

This country boy love is what you need
We can knock them boots and yell "yee yee"
All them city boys jealous of what they see
Cause they ain't loving like that, no
This country boy love is what you need
Like a 12 gauge pump can set you free
Once you taste these biscuits, that's so sweet
You ain't ever going back, no
That's a country boy love
