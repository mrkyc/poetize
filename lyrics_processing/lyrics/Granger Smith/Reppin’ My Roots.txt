I wore that red and white on a Friday night
When my hometown takes the field
I say "Yes sir, yes Ma'am, try to be the best man, that's how I feel"
No matter where my heart runs, I remember where I came from

Still got that raised up, ride that, small town, pride that
Black, red, white and blue
Got that trust from a handshake, dust from a long day's
Hard work on my boots
Those friends I still got with me
Its that town that made those memories
Still got a piece of me, yeah, got a piece of it too
And every thing I do, reppin' my roots
I'm reppin' my roots

That old single cap truck that my dad fixed up at 16, still running
And my grandpas last paw
Scratched in the wood, six string, still strumming
No matter where I go now, I show 'em off somehow

Still got that raised up, ride that, small town, pride that
Black, red, white and blue
Got that trust from a handshake, dust from a long day's
Hard work on my boots
Those friends I still got with me
Its that town that made those memories
Still got a piece of me, yeah, got a piece of it too
And every thing I do, reppin' my roots
