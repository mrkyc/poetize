A spirit ne'er be told
A little town on the Brazos
A little ring made of gold
I carry it with me, wherever I go
Just to remember the times
We learned some from books
And a whole lot from livin'
And we etched our names on the wood
At the Chicken
I still hear the sound of spurs on the concrete
And that ol' train whistel blowing through the trees
So put a penny on ol' Sully
And wish me some luck
And yell farmers fight
When our boys are backed up
Throw your arms around each other
And sing Hullabaloo
'Cause that's what we do when we bleed maroon
Midnight at Duncan
They still light the torches
And Reveille still barks at the Cav on their horses
I've seen 80,000 to the power of 12
It doesn't matter who comes to town
We still give them hell
And I was there at the stack on November 18th
With logs on the ground I fell down on my knees
But we would not forget the 12 that we lost
So we carved their names right there on the rock

And wish me some luck
And yell farmers fight
When our boys are backed up
Throw your arms around each other
And sing Hullabaloo
'Cause that's what we do when we bleed maroon
And there late at night if I listen real close
The spirit still whispers through the crooked live oaks
And I hear my father and his dad before
And all those brave Aggies that never came back from war
So put a penny on ol' Sully
And wish me some luck
And yell farmers fight
When our boys are backed up
Throw your arms around each other
And sing Hullabaloo
'Cause that's what we do when we bleed maroon
And say 'here' for me at muster when my time comes too
'cause that's what we do when we bleed maroon
