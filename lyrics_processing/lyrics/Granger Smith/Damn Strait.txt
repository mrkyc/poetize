It's hot and humid, you can tell summer is back in Texas. Hi guys it's the Ant Man hooking you up with a classic from George Strait on the ride home today. Nobody in his right mind would have left me

Damn Strait, I was pissed off peddle down, tearin' right out of the drive
Drove damn Strait, through a couple county reds my the way to this neon dive
And damn Strait, that's how I wanna take it, bartender keep 'em comin' all night

'Cause I'm droppin' these quarters in the jukebox non-stop
Playin' every King George song
Between the steel and the whiskey somethin' just hit me maybe I might of been wrong
I'm livin' every line, and nobody in his right mind prayin' that it ain't too late
Damn Strait

Damn Strait, why'd you have to sing that one about Amarillo?
Damn Strait, that's the one she tipped the band to play and we danced real close
Damn Strait, I was tryna get her gone but now you got me holdin' on

And I'm droppin' these quarters in the jukebox non-stop
Playin' every King George song
Between the steel and the whiskey somethin' just hit me maybe I might of been wrong
I'm livin' every line, and nobody in his right mind prayin' that it ain't too late
Damn Strait
You might also like
I know 'em all by heart
Heard 'em all my life
But they never hit me as hard
As they are in here tonight

Droppin' these quarters in the jukebox non-stop
Playin' every one of your songs
Between the steel and the whiskey somethin' just hit me maybe I might of been wrong
'Cause I'm livin' every line, and nobody in his right mind prayin' that it ain't too late
I never thought I'd say
Damn Strait
