We were here blowin' out birthday cakes
Ridin' our bikes, jumpin' in lakes
Feelin' butterflies on our first dates
And stealin' our old man's beer
We were here back home in the home of the brave
But the brave ain't home, they're an ocean away
Doin' their job and keepin' us safe
While we were here

They were there, fightin' back on the front lines
Strappin' up their boots before the sunrise
Keepin' their mamas up all night in fear
They were there in the name of a hometown
Of a last name that was passed down
Every day, every night, every moment we were here
They were there
They were there

We were here sayin' the Pledge of Allegiance
Repeatin' those words, not knowin' their meanin'
Takin' for granted all our freedoms
In the land of the free
We were here bitchin' bout minimum wage
Splittin' ourselves into red and blue states
And still sat down, hot food on the plate
Yeah, while we were here

They were there, fightin' back on the front lines
Strappin' up their boots before the sunrise
Keepin' their mamas up all night in fear
They were there in the name of a hometown
Of a last name that was passed down
Every day, every night, every moment we were here
They were there
They were there

They were there
Givin' everything they got
They were there
Some came home in a pinewood box
With those stars and stripes on top

They were there, fightin' back on the front lines
Strappin' up their boots before the sunrise
Keepin' their mamas up all night in fear
They were there in the name of a hometown
Of a last name that was passed down
Every day, every night, every moment we were here
They were there
They were there
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
