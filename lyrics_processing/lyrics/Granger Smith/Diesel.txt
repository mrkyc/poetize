I'm Earl Dibbles Jr, I'm a country boy
Sun's up and I'm workin'
Time to put my boots on
Time to strap on them overalls and put a good dip in
It's time to, you know, crank it up

Detroit Cummins Powerstrokin' Duramax
Turbo whirlin' burnin' coal up a hot stack
A pretty Prius from the city ain't got that
So why drive that? Huh, shoot
It's for the backwoods tractor pullin' country folk
You can't miss 'em, hear they whistle when they blowin' smoke
Haulin' everything from hay bales to bass boats
It ain't no joke, nope

Yeah, we love smokin' that diesel
It screams out freedom like a big bald eagle (Hey)
Like a rooster on a June bug beetle
Country boys are leadfoot lethal
Hallelujah, chrome stacks like a steeple
All my yee-yee people
Love smokin' that diesel
You might also like
You can pour it on some pine on a Saturday night
Crack a cold one, get it goin' with a match strike
Country girls look pretty in the firelight
Man, that's what I like, you know that's right

Yeah, we love smokin' that diesel
It screams out freedom like a big bald eagle (Hey)
Like a rooster on a June bug beetle
Country boys are leadfoot lethal
Hallelujah, chrome stacks like a steeple
All my yee-yee people (Yee-yee)
Love smokin' that diesel

Talkin' farmer tan, Skoal can
Bandit and the Snowman
Making them tree huggers choke
Loaded up rifle rack, black barbwire tat
That everybody knows goes
It goes all the way around of course
Yee yee

Yeah, we love smokin' that diesel
It screams out freedom like a big bald eagle (Hey)
Like a rooster on a June bug beetle
Country boys are leadfoot lethal
Hallelujah, chrome stacks like a steeple
All my yee-yee people
Love smokin' that diesel
Yeah, we love smokin' that diesel, yes we do
