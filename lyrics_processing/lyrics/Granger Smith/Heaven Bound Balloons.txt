I saw them sittin' with their legs crossed in the backyard
The kids had magic markers, writing on balloons
They let one go and watched it sail above the treetops
So I went outside to see what they were doin'
They said, "Daddy, we've been sendin' notes to grandpa"
I just smiled, sat down, and said, "Mind if I join y'all?

We wrote, "We miss you and we love you"
Told him, "Things are great down here"
We spelled it out and sent it up
And we watched it disappear
Sometimes I guess you gotta see it to believe it
'Cause right then, I knew those blue sky prayers were gettin' through
When we let go of those heaven-bound balloons

Before we knew, I swear we'd made at least a dozen
One for everyone we wished were here, but wasn't
There was a red one for our labrador named Rio
And a blue one to Miss Ruth who used to live just down the road

We wrote, "We miss you and we love you"
Told him, "Things are great down here"
We spelled it out and sent it up
And we watched it disappear
Sometimes I guess you gotta see it to believe it
'Cause right then, I knew those blue sky prayers were gettin' through
When we let go of those heaven-bound balloons
You might also like
Woah, woah
Woah, woah
Woah, woah

Yeah, I know that I'll be sittin' up there someday
Don't forget to send a couple of them my way

Say, "We miss you and we love you"
Tell me, "Things are great down here"
Just spell it out and send it up
And watch it disappear
Sometimes I guess you gotta see it to believe it
'Cause right then, I knew those blue sky prayers were gettin' through
When we let go of those heaven-bound balloons
Let go of those heaven-bound balloons
