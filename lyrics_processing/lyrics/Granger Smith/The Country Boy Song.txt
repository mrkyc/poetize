I wake up, put a dip in, crack a cold one
Put my boots and my overalls on
This is the country boy song
I like to gig frogs
Like to gut hogs
Like to swim in the creek with my bird dog, uh huh
This is the country boy song

Chew it up, spit it out
Crack a cold one and tilt it back
I'm tired of these city boys runnin' their mouths
If their truck gets stuck I ain't pullin' them out
If you got a dip in your lip help me sing along
This is the country boy song

I catch bass and cats
With a rod and reel
Kill bucks from atop of a windmill all day long
This is the country boy song
I fix the tree, widdle sticks
My barbwire tattoo gets me chicks, uh huh
Of course it goes all the way around
You might also like
I keep a twelve guage by my water bed
Cause the next trailer over lives a meth head, uh huh
And that ain't biscuits he's cookin'
Yeah, I'm a redneck, I'm white trash
Quarter Cherokee blood from my mom's half, uh huh
This is the country boy song

Chew it up, spit it out
Crack a cold one and tilt it back
I'm tired of these city boys runnin' their mouths
If their truck gets stuck I ain't pullin' them out
If you got a dip in your lip help me sing along
This is the country boy song
Dip

Gettin' country drunk in the back of my truck
The night is young imma gonna get messed up
Gettin' country drunk in the back of my truck
The night is young imma gonna get messed up
Gettin' country drunk in the back of my truck
The night is young imma gonna get messed up
Gettin' country drunk in the back of my truck
The night is young imma gonna get
Chew it up, spit it out
Crack a cold one and tilt it back
I'm tired of these city boys runnin' their mouths
If their truck gets stuck I ain't pullin' them out
If you got a dip in your lip help me sing along
This is the country boy song
Uh
Yeah
This is the country boy song
(Look at them running they're mouths)

Put a good dip in
