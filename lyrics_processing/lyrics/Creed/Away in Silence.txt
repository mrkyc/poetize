You walked away in silence
You walked away to breathe
Stopped and turned around to say goodbye to me
I'm pleading as you're leaving, I'm begging you stay
I'm not the man I used to be, I've changed
I'm not the man I used to be, I've changed

Don't give up on us, don't give up on love
Don't give up on us, don't give up on love
If my life is the price, then my life it will cost
Now that I'm picking up the pieces
See the pain that I have caused
It's hard to believe in someone you thought was lost
Don't give up on us, don't give up on love
Don't you walk away in silence

In tears you counted reasons
Tears covered you it seemed
Face down screaming "God help me please"
I'm pleading as you're leaving, I'm begging you to stay
I'm not the man I used to be, I've changed
I'm not the man I used to be, I've changed

If my life is the price, then my life it will cost

It's hard to believe in someone you thought was lost
Don't give up on us, don't give up on love
Don't you walk away in silence

Please come back to me
Don't you walk away in silence
I'm not the man I used to be

(Well I pray that tomorrow you'll be home)
We can rebuild and forever, we can go on, go on, and go on
We can go on
(Well I pray that tomorrow you'll be home)
Look at horizons and let the light bring you home
Bring you home

Don't give up on us, don't give up on love
Don't give up on us, don't give up on love
If my life is the price, then my life it will cost
Now that I'm picking up the pieces

Don't walk away in silence, please don't walk away
Don't walk away in silence
