No appeal on the docket today, just my own sin
The walls are cold and pale, the cage made of steel
Screams fill the room alone, I drop and kneel
Silence now the sound, my breath the only motion around
Demons cluttering around my face showing no emotion
Shackled by my sentence, expecting no return
Here there is no penance, my skin begins to burn
(And I said, oh)
So, I held my head up high hiding hate that burns inside
Which only fuels there selfish pride
(And I said, oh)
We're all held captive out from the sun
A sun that shines on only some
We the meek are all in one
I hear a thunder, in the distance see a vision of a cross
I feel the pain that was given on that sad day of loss
A lion roars in the darkness, only he holds the key
A light to free me from my burden and grant me life eternally
Should have been dead on a Sunday morning banging my head
No time for mourning, ain't got no time
Should have been dead on a Sunday morning banging my head
No time for mourning, ain't got no time
(And I said, oh)
So, I held my head up high hiding hate that burns inside
Which only fuels there selfish pride
(And I said, oh)
We're all held captive out from the sun
A sun that shines on only some
We the meek are all in one
I cry out to God seeking only his decision
Gabriel stands and confirms
I've created my own prison
I cry out to God seeking only his decision
Gabriel stands and confirms
I've created my own prison
(And I said, oh)
So, I held my head up high hiding hate that burns inside
Which only fuels there selfish pride
(And I said, oh)
We're all held captive out from the sun
A sun that shines on only some
We the meek are all in one
(And I said, oh)
So, I held my head up high hiding hate that burns inside
Which only fuels there selfish pride
(And I said, oh)
We're all held captive out from the sun
A sun that shines on only some
We the meek are all in one
Should have been dead on a Sunday morning banging my head
