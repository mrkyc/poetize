Walking around I hear the sounds of the earth seeking relief
I'm trying to find a reason to live
But the mindless clutter my path
Oh, these thorns in my side
Oh, these thorns in my side
I know I have something free
I have something so alive
But I think they shoot because they want
I think they shoot because they want
I think they shoot because they want me

I feel forces all around me
Come on raise your head
Those who hide behind the shadows
Live with all that's dead

Look at me, look at me, look at me, look at me
At least look at me when you shoot
A bullet through my head
Through my head, through my head

In my lifetime when I'm disgraced
Jealousy and lies
I laugh aloud because my life
Has gotten inside someone else's mind

Look at me, look at me, look at me, look at me
At least look at me when you shoot
A bullet through my head
Through my head, through my head

Hey, all I want is what's real
Something I touch and can feel
I'll hold it close and never let it go
Said why, why do we live this life
With all this hate inside?
I'll give it away
Because I don't want it no more
Please help me find a place
Somewhere far away
Yes, I'll go and you'll never see me again

Look at me, look at me
At least look at me when you shoot
A bullet through my head
Through my head, through my head

Look at me, look at me
At least look at me when you shoot
A bullet through my head
Through my head, through my head
Look at me
