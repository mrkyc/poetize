I can't explain
Can't quite put my finger on it
The difference that makes us so different
We've said everything
Our words only betrayed us
Nothing is left nothing was left unsaid

This time I have nothing left to lose
I'm stuck the second hand won't move
It's about time that I speak my mind
It's about time, about time to find
Pieces of me I have lost
Without any choice I move on
Hey time, you're no friend of mine
Hey time, you're no friend of mine

You cover yourself you cover your skin
You cover yourself like you cover your sins
Please untie my hands
I'm a sinner, I'm a man
I ask for one minute to make you understand

This time I have nothing left to lose
I'm stuck the second hand won't move
It's about time that I speak my mind
It's about time, about time to find
Pieces of me I have lost
Without any choice I move on
Hey time, you're no friend of mine
Hey time, you're no friend of mine

Will you be there
To catch me when I stumble when I fall
When I fall
It's so very clear
You left me when I had no one at all
No one at all
Who will be there
To catch me, to catch me when I stumble when I fall
When I fall
It's so very clear
You left me, you left me with no one at all
No one at all

This time I have nothing left to lose
I'm stuck the second hand won't move
It's about time that I speak my mind
It's about time, about time to find
Pieces of me I have lost
Without any choice I move on
Hey time, you're no friend of mine
Hey time, you're no friend of mine

No friend of mine
Time, you're no friend of mine
You're no friend of mine
Hey time, you're no friend of mine
Hey time, you're no friend of mine
The pieces of me I have lost
Without any choice I move on
