Here we go, here we go, here we go

This songs dedicated to the undiluted queen of rock and roll
She knows who she is

I left my home down in the heart of Georgia
And headed out to Hollywood
All I took with me was my healing music
I was preaching every step that I could
You ain't heard my rock and roll music
You ain't never seen nothing like me
'Cause I can wash dishes down in Macon, Georgia
And help a blind eye to see

I'm gonna sing a little song of love for you one more time
(Tutti frutti, the beauty's on duty)
Well I'm gonna a little this song of love for you one more time
(Tutti frutti, the beauty's on duty)
Lord, the beauty is on duty, you know we're gonna have a time, yeah
Move on up to heaven

Headin' up the highway, feelin all right today
All I got with me is my faith in Jesus
To show me every step of the way
Sticks can't burn me, fire can't turn me
Away from my rock and roll road
Gonna get a rainbow round my beautiful face
And I'm living in a pot of gold

I'm gonna sing a little song of love for you one more time
(Tutti frutti, the beauty's on duty)
Well I'm gonna gonna sing a little song of love for you one more time
(Tutti frutti, the beauty's on duty)
Lord, the beauty's on duty, honey you know we're gonna have a time
(You know we're gonna have)
(You know we're gonna have)

I'm gonna sing a little song of love for you one more time
(Tutti frutti, the beauty's on duty)
Yeah I'm gonna sing a little song of love for you one more time
(Tutti frutti, the beauty's on duty)
Wooh
(Woh, woh, woh, woh, woh...)
I'm gonna sing a little song of love for you one more time, wooh
(Tutti frutti, the beauty's on duty)
Well I'm gonna sing a little song of love for you one more time
(Tutti frutti, the beauty's on duty)
