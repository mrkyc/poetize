How many days has it been since I was born?
How many days until I die?
Do I know any ways that I can make you laugh
Or do I only know how to make you cry?

When the Baby looks around Him
It's such a sight to see
He shares a simple secret with a wise man

He's a stranger in a strange land
Just a stranger in a strange land
Tell me why he's a stranger in a strange land
Oh-oh-oh (A stranger in a strange land)

How many miles will it take to see the sun
And how many years 'til it's done?
Kiss my confusion away in the night
Lay by my side when the mornin' comes

And the Baby looks around Him
Shares His bed of hay
With the burro in the palace of the king
You might also like
He's a stranger in a strange land
Tell me why he's a stranger in a strange land, hoo
Just a stranger in a strange land
Just a stranger in a strange land

Well, I don't exactly know what's goin' on in the world today
I don't know what there is to say about the way the people are treating each other, not like brothers
Leaders take us far away from ecology with mythology and astrology
I've got some words to say about the way we live today
Why can't we learn to love each other?
It's time to learn a new face to the whole worldwide human race
Stop the money chase, lay back, relax and get back on the human track
Stop racing towards oblivion, oh, such a sad, sad state we're in
And that's the thing, do you recognize the bells of truth when you hear them ring?

Won't you stop and listen to the children sing?
(Stranger in a strange land)
Won't you sing it, children?
Won't you come on and sing it, children?
(Stranger in a strange land)
Woah-oh-oh sing it one more time, I didn't hear you
(Stranger in a strange land)
(Stranger in a strange land) Woah, woah, woah
(Stranger in a strange land) Woah, woah, woah
