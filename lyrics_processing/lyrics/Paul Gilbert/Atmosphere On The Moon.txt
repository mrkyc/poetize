I wanna pack my bags and leave
Leave the whole world behind
Ain't comin' back any time soon
But where am I supposed to go
When there ain't no air to breathe
And no one to talk to
On the moon?

So I'm asking all the children to quit wasting time
With music that's been so auto-tuned
And stand on the shoulders of Galilee
To learn how to fly up and fabricate
An atmosphere on the moon
Now you may wonder, you may ask
Why is it that I want to steal
All the fun away
From the younger generation
Well, you know I would do it all myself
'Cause it sounds like fun to me
But I just don't seem to have
The imagination

So I'm asking all the children to quit wasting time
With music that's been so auto-tuned
And stand on the shoulders of Galilee
To learn how to fly up and fabricate
An atmosphere on the moon

(With an atmosphere) sun on the bright side, dark side and there's snow
(With an atmosphere) so much of land, spreading far and wide
(With an atmosphere) we'll make an ocean, and the earth can bring the tide
Ha ha ha

So why go through the trouble
When we have everything we need right here
Why not just stop fighting each other
And live in peace
Well we've been tryin' and tryin' and tryin'
For so many thousands of years
But nothing seems to work, so I'm gonna live
On a big piece of cheese

So I'm asking all the children to quit wasting time
With music that's been so auto-tuned
And stand on the shoulders of Galilee
To learn how to fly up and fabricate
An atmosphere on the moon

So I'm asking all the children to quit wasting time
With music that's been so auto-tuned
And stand on the shoulders of Galilee
To learn how to fly up and fabricate
