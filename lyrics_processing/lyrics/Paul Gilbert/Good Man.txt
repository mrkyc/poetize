In those days it was ringing all the time
Calling you so I knew you were fine
And a good man I felt that I could be
I was strong, full of hope and dignity
But the break, that mistake came from me
I know you, you know me
Why we aren't together is a mystery
That only we know, we know
All I want to do is be together with you and let you know
I'll be a good man
All I want to do is be together with you and never go
I'll be a good man
Every night I can see you in my dreams
But my days are so empty and it seems
Being wrong takes so long to remedy
And I've tried taking everyone's advice
Just move on, get back in and roll the dice
But the song I sing in my head is "Wouldn't it be nice"
I know you, you know me
Why we aren't together is a mystery
That only we know, we know
All I want to do is be together with you and let you know
I'll be a good man
All I want to do is be together with you and never go
