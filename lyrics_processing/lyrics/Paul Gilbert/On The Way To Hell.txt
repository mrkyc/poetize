Today I woke up just a little late, she's gonna
Hold my hand and take me to the gate now
On the way to hell
I'm not a man, I'm just a skinny kid, I don't
Know what I want, maybe if I did I'd have a
Better chance not ending up like Sid now
On the way to hell
I'm on my way to hell
On my way to hell
I'm on my way
I'm only asking for a little more, I wanna
See a girl I never seen before, she's gonna
Show me something that I can't ignore now
On the way to hell
I'm gonna wrap her up in cellophane, and take her
Across the water in my aeroplane, I'm gonna
Play this guitar until we insane now
On the way to hell
It's just a city like L.A
They got a new Hard Rock Cafe
We'll buy a t-shirt on a holiday
Because your friends will wanna see it
Then I'm taking you across the stream
Not gonna stop until I hear you scream
Remember life is really but a dream
So you might as well dream it
Might as well dream it
You might also likeI'm only asking for a little more, I wanna
See a girl I never seen before, she's gonna
Show me something that I can't ignore now
On the way to hell
I'm not a man I'm just a skinny kid, I don't
Know what I want and maybe if I did I'd have a
Better chance not ending up like Sid now
On the way to hell
I'm on my way to hell
On my way to hell
I'm on my way
I'm on my way to hell
On my way to hell
I'm on my way
I'm on my way
