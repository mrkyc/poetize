Just waiting to go
Somebody beside me
That I don't want to know
I step on the pedal
When it's finally green
Doesn't matter how fast I go
Cause she's in here with me
First time I thought it
And the next time I oughta
It's the last time I ever wanna go
Cut all the ties with you
Don't want to be nice to you
And after I've thrown it all away
Well I
Well I cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut
Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut all the ties
Cut all the ties
She knew it was over
As I pulled to the side
I gave her 'bout half my keys
Then I told her to drive

Like I've done it before
I smile the further they get
Till I can't see 'em no more
First time I thought it
And the next time I oughta
It's the last time I'm ever gonna go
Cut all the ties with you
Don't want to be nice to you
And after I've thrown it all away
Well I
Well I cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut
Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut all the ties
Cut all the ties
Cut all the ties
Cut all the ties
Cut all the ties
I'm back at the red light
Don't think I'm amused
When she knocks on my window
Looking new and improved
Says everything's different
Maybe try it again
Says she really misses
Showing me off to her friends
First time I thought it
And the next time I oughta
It's the last time I'm never gonna go
Cut all the ties with you
Don't want to be nice to you
And after I've thrown it all away
Well I
Cut all the ties with you
Don't want to be nice to you
And after I've thrown it all away
Well I
Well I cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut
Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut
Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut all the ties
Cut all the ties
Cut all the ties
Cut all the ties
