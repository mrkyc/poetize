I can't see, cause all the grease in my hair
Is getting in my eyes and makes me look like I'm crying
I can't stay, already been here too long
I can't leave, don't want to leave you alone
Now I'm a big strong man so don't you think that I'm crying
No it's the rain outside getting on my face
Or the foam from a glass of beer
Or the water fountain was misplaced
It is anything but a tear
No I'm not crying, I'm not crying
I don't have time to spend on that
I've got to keep on trying
I'm not crying, I'm not crying
I only want you back
And so I really should be flying
To knock on your door, Mr. Spock is no more
I can't feel, because my heart is so strong
I can't go, I don't know where I belong
I keep on searching for a place, can't you see that I'm trying
I can't hide, because I'm six feet four
I don't fit, cause I'm too tall for the door
I hit my head if I forget and band aids I'm buying
