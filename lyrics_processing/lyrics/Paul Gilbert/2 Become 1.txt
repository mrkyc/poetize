A dream of me and you together
Say you believe it, say you believe it
Free your mind of doubt and danger
Be for real, don't be a stranger
We can achieve it, we can achieve it
Come a little bit closer, baby, get it on, get it on
'Cause tonight is the night that two become one
I need some love like I never needed love before
(Wanna make love to you, baby)
I had a little love, now I'm back for more
(Wanna make love to you, baby)
Set your spirit free, it's the only way to be
Silly games that you were playing
Empty words we both were saying
Let's work it out, girl, let's work it out, girl
Any deal that we endeavour
Boys and girls go good together
Take it or leave it, take it or leave it
Are you as good as I remember, baby, get it on, get it on
'Cause tonight is the night that two become one
I need some love like I never needed love before
(Wanna make love to you, baby)
I had a little love, now I'm back for more
(Wanna make love to you, baby)
Set your spirit free, it's the only way to be

'Cause tonight is the night that two become one
I need some love like I never needed love before
(Wanna make love to you, baby)
I had a little love, now I'm back for more
(Wanna make love to you, baby)
I need some love like I never needed love before
(Wanna make love to you, baby)
I had a little love, now I'm back for more
(Wanna make love to you, baby)
Set your spirit free, it's the only way to be
It's the only way to be
It's the only way to be
It's the only way to be
