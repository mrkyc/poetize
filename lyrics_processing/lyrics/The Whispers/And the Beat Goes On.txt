And the beat goes on
Just like my love, everlasting
And the beat goes on
Still moving strong, on and on

Do you ever wonder
That to win, somebody's got to lose
I might as well get over (The blues)
Just like fishing in the ocean
There'll always be someone new

(Who'll love you better)
You did me wrong
But I've been through stormy weather

And the beat goes on
Just like my love, everlasting
And the beat goes on (You'd better believe it)
Still moving strong, on and on

Don't stop for nobody
This time, I'll keep my feet on solid ground
Now I understand myself (When I'm down)
Like the sweet sound of hip music
There'll always be something new
You might also like
To keep the tables turning
Hate this simple song
But there'll never be an ending

And the beat goes on
Just like my love, everlasting
And the beat goes on
Still moving strong, on and on

The beat goes on (The beat goes on)
The beat goes on
The beat goes on (The beat goes on)
The beat goes on
Guitar playing that fill to show the beat is real
The beat goes on

(Do you ever wonder) Well
That to win, somebody's got to lose
I might as well get over (The blues)
Just like fishing in the ocean
There'll always be someone new
(Who'll love you better)
Girl, you did me wrong
But I've been through stormy weather

And the beat goes on (Yeah, yeah)
Just like my love, everlasting
And the beat goes on
Still moving strong, and I love it
And the beat goes on (Keep movin', keep movin' right on)
Just like my love, everlasting
And the beat goes on (Just like my love, baby)
Just like my love, my love, baby (On and on)

And the beat goes on
Don't stop the groovin'
Don't stop the groovin'

And the beat goes on (Woo)
Just like my love, everlasting
And the beat goes on (Got to make it last)
Still moving strong, and I love it (Better believe it, baby)
And the beat goes on (And the beat goes on and on and on)
Just like my love, everlasting (Everlasting, baby)
And the beat goes on
Still moving strong, and I love it
And the beat goes on (Just like my love, baby)
Just like my love, baby (Everlasting)
And the beat goes on
Still moving strong, and I love it

The beat goes on (The beat goes on)
The beat goes on
The beat goes on (The beat goes on)
The beat goes on
The beat goes on (The beat goes on)
The beat goes on
The beat goes on (The beat goes on)
The beat goes on

And the beat goes on
Just like my love, everlasting
And the beat goes on
Still moving strong
And the beat goes on
Just like my love, everlasting
And the beat goes on
Still moving strong, and I love it
And the beat goes on
Just like my love, everlasting
And the beat goes on
