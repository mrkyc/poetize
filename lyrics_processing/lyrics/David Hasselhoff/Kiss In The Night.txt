You feel like heaven to me
And darling you're gonna see
No-one could love you more
Now that I've found you
I won't let you go
I want the whole world to know
I wanna feel your kiss in the night
And hold you beside me
'cos I know I'll love you
For all my life
I wanna feel your kiss in the night
Come stay here forever
Let's get together my darling
I need your sweet lips tonight
I never dreamed this was how love would be
Don't think that I could exist
'cos it's your kiss that I'd miss
I need you close to me
I know for sure there's no way we will part
You've taken hold of my heart
I wanna feel your kiss in the night
And hold you beside me
'cos I know I'll love you
For all my life
I wanna feel your kiss in the night
Come stay here forever
Let's get together my darling
I need your sweet lips tonight

The things you do to me
I can't believe you're all mine
I need you oh so much
I need your tender touch
You're sweeter than the sweetest wine
I wanna feel your kiss in the night
And hold you beside me
'cos I know I'll love you
For all my life
I wanna feel your kiss in the night
Come stay here forever
Let's get together my darling
I need your sweet lips tonight
Let's get together my darling
