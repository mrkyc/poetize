Shave and get dressed
I've joined the rat race
Just like the rest
Horse back the highways
Rats fill the streets
Girl I get through it
I don't mind the fight
'Cause I know you're waitin' to love me at night
Darling I love you
I live for your touch
You feel so good and you give me so much
Darling I love you
The world can be cold
Who cares as long as I have you to hold
Life's full of hustle
Concrete and clay
I feel you in me
Want you all day
Letters and phone calls
Fill in my time
I count the minutes
Till I get through
Just when it's dark
I can make love to you
You might also likeDarling I love you
I live for your touch
You feel so good and you give me so much
Darling I love you
The world can be cold
Who cares as long as I have you to hold
Darling I love you
I live for your touch
You feel so good and you give me so much
Darling I love you
The world can be cold
Who cares as long as I have you to hold
What good is morning
I have to go
Noon time is lonely
It moves so slow
Dying to kiss you
Take care inside
I feel your body
When we're apart
Want to run home so the loving can start
Darling I love you
I live for your touch
You feel so good and you give me so much
Darling I love you
The world can be cold
Who cares as long as I have you to hold
Darling I love you
I live for your touch
You feel so good and you give me so much
Darling I love you
The world can be cold
Who cares as long as I have you to hold
Darling I love you
