Beach baby, beach baby, beach baby, beach baby oh oh oh
Do you remember back in old L.A
When everybody drove a Chevrolet
What ever happenned to the boy next door
The sun tanned crew cut all American male
Remember dancing at the high school hop
With everybody drinking soda pop
I didn't recognize the girl next door
With beat up sneakers and a pony tail
Beach baby beach baby give me your hand
Give me something than I can remember
Just like before we can walk by the shore in the moonlight
Beach baby beach baby there on the sand
Come to lie till the end of September
Surfing is fun we'll be out in the sun everyday
Beach baby, beach baby, beach baby, beach baby oh oh oh
Beach baby, beach baby, beach baby, beach baby oh oh oh
We couldn't wait for graduation day
We took the car and drove to San Jose
That's were you told me that you were my friend
I guess you don't remember anything
You might also likeBeach baby beach baby give me your hand
Give me something than I can remember
Just like before we can walk by the shore in the moonlight
Beach baby beach baby there on the sand
Come to lie till the end of September
Surfing is fun we'll be out in the sun everyday
Beach baby, beach baby, beach baby, beach baby oh oh oh
Beach baby, beach baby, beach baby, beach baby oh oh oh
I never thought that it would end - When I was everybody's friend
Long hot days - Cool sea haze
Juke bow plays - But now it's fading away
Beach baby beach baby give me your hand
Give me something than I can remember
Just like before we can walk by the shore in the moonlight
Beach baby beach baby there on the sand
Come to lie till the end of September
Surfing is fun we'll be out in the sun everyday
Beach baby, beach baby, beach baby, beach baby oh oh oh
