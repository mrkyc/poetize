I can taste your sins all over me)
(v.1)
I see broken angels
With splintered halos
I'm the serpent
Swallowed by the sun
My gentle obsession with
Corrupt nutrition
I can taste the madness
Dripping from your tongue
Between the spaces to
Scratch the itch
My sins of excess
Prove to me that i exist
My lip drip
Secrets of the flesh
You might also likeThey fold into a blade
And beg: "make me wet"
I can't help myself
SWEET TOOTH
Seduced by my obsession
I'll build my own religion
So i can taste the secret places
That set you on fire
(you are my favourite
Most dangerous
Fascination)
(v.2)
Tempt me devil
Teach me what you think i need
Her fingers are Caesar
Slowly conquering me
We move like Buddhas
Twisted in a silent scream
Our souls explode
& merge with the Shiva frequency
The meat is sweet
But is it love? or is it lies?
To burn in the heat
Of the fire in her eyes
My lips drip
A soft song of love & flesh
That folds into a blade
And beg: "make me wet"
I can't help myself
SWEET TOOTH
Seduced by my obsession
I'll build my own religion
So i can taste the secret places
That set you on fire
(v.3)
Tempt me
Teach me
Feed me
Heal me
I feel like being bad
The tyrant of my desire
A blushing rosebud begging to be plucked
I feel like being...
Inside of you, baby
It was an atomic testing site
Explosive, corrosive
But oh, what a delight
They say the body's a temple
& desires a sacrifice
Devils speak, angels weep
For my SACRED APPETITES
Seduced by my obsession
I'll build my own religion
So i can taste the secret places
That set you on fire
Explosive, corrosive
But oh, what a delight
Devils speak, angels weep
For my sweet tooth's sacrifice
...take my temperature baby
This is what you taste like
When our souls collide
I can conquer eveything
That defeats me in life
Feed me
Eat me
Drink me
Promise i'll never be bored
And i'll be yours tonight
This is what you taste like
This is what you taste like
