If you step into the ring be prepared to swing!! ...(WHUT??)
Me be the best to impress with dictation?
Too far fetched? beyond your imagination?
I'll rise to the occasion launching an invasion
-- enterin your mental like a viral infestation
Wurdz be abrasive -- joints eye be lacin
Sacrificin mics to ignite the celebration
Its just amazing, poetically we blazing
Xen & otep -- a volatile combination
Destroy your revelations
Styles be liquid and flow like irrigation
So make the preparation
Defeat is bittersweet, soon you'll be tastin
Sounding battle stations - my warface in place
Total annihilation - your existence has been erased
Its the renaissance - time to switch up and change
The path the paragraphs infiltrate your brain
T.R.I.C. (x4)
Risin from the ashes to lead the wretched masses
Back to the sufi shack - defyin all the fascists
Wurdz burn with passion -- mentally enhancin
I'm david to goliath or delilah to your samson
Kickin ass like cassius -- spreadin rhymes like rashes
The satellites in flight - how long before it crashes
Falling like avalanches - crumbled and crushed
My wild women get to sinning -- know the power of us
I'm callin your bluff -- is it freedom or death?
We're gettin it on in Babylon - chokin on gods breath
The infinite connects true soldiers alive
We'll survive when armageddon arrives

The revolution is coming
TAKE NO PRISONERS
The revolution is coming
COWARDS BEWARE (x4)
FUCK!
-- my war serpents rattle when its time to battle (mental midgets)
Eye got a fist full of shit for you flies to feast
You lost control of your soul cuz your minds deceased
Unfulfilled satisfactions & chemical reactions
Fate there's no escape -- life itself is the assassin
Eye'm blastin -- the worlds in ashes -- from the invasion
--- EVERY WORD'S ANNIHILATION!!
COME ON!!
T.R.I.C (x4)
