I've never seen a diamond in the flesh
(Diamond in the flesh, diamond in the flesh)
I cut my teeth on wedding rings (On wedding rings) in the movies (In the movies)
And I'm not proud of my address (Proud of my address)
In the torn-up town (Torn-up town)
No postcode envy

But every song's like gold teeth, Grey Goose
Tripping in the bathroom
Blood stains, ball gowns
Trashing the hotel room
We don't care
We're driving Cadillacs in our dreams
But everybody's like Cristal, Maybach
Diamonds on your timepiece
Jet planes, islands
Tigers on a gold leash
We don't care
We aren't caught up in your love affair

And we'll never be royals (Royals)
It don't run in our blood
That kind of lux just ain't for us
We crave a different kind of buzz
Let me be your ruler (Ruler)
You can call me Queen Bee
And I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule
Let me live that fantasy (Live that fantasy)
You might also like
My friends and I we've cracked the code
(We've cracked the code, we've cracked the code)
We count our dollars on the train (On the train) to the party (Party)
And everyone who knows us knows (Knows us knows, knows us knows)
That we're fine with this (We're fine with this)
We didn't come from money (Didn't come from money)

But every song's like gold teeth, Grey Goose
Tripping in the bathroom
Blood stains, ball gowns
Trashing the hotel room
We don't care
We're driving Cadillacs in our dreams
But everybody's like Cristal, Maybach
Diamonds on your timepiece
Jet planes, islands
Tigers on a gold leash
We don't care
We aren't caught up in your love affair

And we'll never be royals (Royals)
It don't run in our blood
That kind of lux just ain't for us
We crave a different kind of buzz
Let me be your ruler (Ruler)
You can call me Queen Bee
And I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule
Let me live that fantasy
We're bigger than we ever dreamed
And I'm in love with being queen
Life is great, without a care
We aren't caught up in your love affair

And we'll never be royals (Royals)
It don't run in our blood
That kind of lux just ain't for us
We crave a different kind of buzz
Let me be your ruler (Ruler)
You can call me Queen Bee
And I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule
