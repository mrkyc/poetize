THESE SCARS ARE MINE
MY PAIN, MY PRIDE
THESE SCARS ARE MINE
I will tell you a story
That's never been told
I will tell you a secret
5 lifetimes old ...
My life has been a prison
A labyrinth built beneath the mountain of Tragedy
I'm a stain on the cloth
I'm just an after-thought
But i
Would die
For this ....
But through the veins of decay
I'll remain to betray
To live like Caesar
To die like Jesus
You might also likeTo build my own religion
No gods, no laws
To celebrate pain
Forsaken & ashamed
To watch them all
Crawl beneath us ...
On this bed of nails & regret
Dying of fevers, betrayal, & sweat
I CRY ...
(chorus)
My organs are rotting
My enemies are plotting ...
I AM MADE OF PAGES
PARAGRAPHS & INSPIRATIONS
PAPER GIRL, BURN THE WORLD
I PASS THE FLAME TO YOU!!
MURDER
MAYHEM
HURT HER
HATE HIM
MURDER
MAYHEM
HURT HER
HATE HIM
MURDER MAYHEM
HURT HER HATE HIM
MURDER
MAYHEM
FUCK HER
SLAY THEM!!
(verse)
My pain, my pride
These scars are mine
My pain .....
MY MISERY HAS BEEN FORMULATED
INTO AN EQUATION OF NIEN
MY SANITY WROTE
A SUICIDE NOTE
BUT ONE OF US IS ILLITERATE
AND THE OTHER ... IS BLIND
MY 1st ACT OF TREASON
WAS PICKING UP A PEN
MY 1st ACT OF LOVE
WAS FINDING MYSELF AGAIN
THE HARDEST THING TO DO
WAS STANDING UP TO YOU
NOW I'M OFF MY KNEES
NOW YOU'RE BEGGING ME "PLEASE"
I'M THE WOUND & THE WEAPON
THE FRACTURE & THE FIST
(chorus)
My organs are rotting
My enemies are plotting ...
I AM MADE OF PAGES
PARAGRAPHS & INSPIRATIONS
PAPER GIRL, BURN THE WORLD
I PASS THE FLAME TO YOU!!
MURDER
MAYHEM
HURT HER
HATE HIM
MURDER
MAYHEM
HURT HER
HATE HIM
MURDER MAYHEM
HURT HER HATE HIM
MURDER
MAYHEM
FUCK HER
SLAY THEM!!
(outro)
THAT STABBING IN YOUR HEART
THAT BLACK HOLE IN YOUR SOUL
SLOWLY RIPPING YOU APART .... THAT'S ME!!!
THAT'S ME!!!
SO LET IT BE WRITTEN
SO LET IT BE DONE!
THE BRIGHTER THEY SHINE
THE DARKER WE BECOME!!
VAE VICTUS!
