Say what you need to save your soul
But don't fuck with me
I'm losin' control
I'm so tired of this, so sick of you
My tongue is battered and bruised from all these attitudes
Teach me the magic of your sacred poems
Conjuring a voice of signs and omens
Prophecies got debris
The syllables and symbols breathe
And as we climb, divine
To sacrifice our wounded minds
This awkward chance to seek, insanity
I can't save you, cause I hate me
The Lord is my weapon
And I see him shoot pawns
Woman is the devil
Your God is a fraud
Everyone you knew
Everything you've ever done
Suffer for your freedom
Die by the law
You might also likeThe Lord is my weapon
And I see him shoot pawns
Woman is the devil
Your God is a fraud
Everyone you knew
Everything you've ever done
Suffer for your freedom
Die by the law
Say what you need to save your soul
But leave your religion at the door
Smokin' all of Krishna's weed
I'm sick of these weak anarchy's
You see me as a place to make a bruise
But in my reality I'm a slave to the muse
Fuck these hypocrites, together we'll fight
Tyranny of squares, squiggles unite
The Lord is my weapon
And I see him shoot pawns
Woman is the devil
Your God is a fraud
Everyone you knew
Everything you've ever done
Suffer for your freedom
Die by the Law
The Lord is my weapon
And I see him shoot pawns
Woman is the devil
Your God is a fraud
Everyone you knew
Everything you've ever done
Suffer for your freedom
Die by the Law
All you sinners
Blasphemers
Burn in the pit
Burn
Burn
Burn
The Lord is my weapon
And I see him shoot pawns
Woman is the devil
Your God is a fraud
Everyone you knew
Everything you've ever done
Suffer for your freedom
Die by the Law
The Lord is my weapon
And I see him shoot pawns
Woman is the devil
Your God is a fraud
Everyone you knew
Everything you've ever done
Suffer for you freedom
Die by the Law
Save me
Save me
Save me
Save me
Save me
Save me
Save me
