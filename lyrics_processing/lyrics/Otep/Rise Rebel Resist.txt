It's family fun time, let's commit a hate crime
Perfect little spouses, in perfect little houses
It's family fun time, let's commit a hate crime
Perfect little spouses, in perfect little houses
It's family fun time...
LET'S COMMIT A HATE CRIME!
If I can't be loved, then I'll be hated!
I'm...disconected
I'm...uninspired
I'm...burning in water
I'm...drowning in fire
I'm trapped inside my mind
Beneath these piles of stinking lies
You use this abuse to keep me conquered
You're so absurdly common
Vacant faces
Brainless strangers
Sputtering stuttering insect language...
I'm the creature you created
Every day I grow jaded
Callous and exasperated
You might also likeIf I'll never be loved
Then I'll be hated
I'm one of the
Freaks, the faggots
The geeks, the savages
Rogues, rebels, dissident devils
Artists, martyrs, infidels...
Do we sit still, under attack?
Or do we start pushing back?
Never back up
Never back down
And FIGHT!
RISE, REBEL, RESIST!
RISE, REBEL, MAKE A FIST, RESIST!
RISE, REBEL, RESIST!
RISE, REBEL, MAKE A FIST, RESIST!
I'm human pollution
I covet retribution
I'm just a big mistake
A defect you can subjugate
Your ridicule is just typical antics:
Spineless, mindless, tragic, fanatic
Puritan, bigot
Lunatic, hypocrite
To save my soul from disaster
Self-destruction could be the answer
If I'll never be loved
Then I'll be hated
I'm one of the
Freaks, the faggots
The geeks, the savages
Rogues, rebels, dissident devils
Artists, martyrs, infidels...
Do we sit still, under attack?
Or do we start pushing back?
Never back up
Never back down
And FIGHT!
RISE, REBEL, RESIST!
RISE, REBEL, MAKE A FIST, RESIST!
RISE, REBEL, RESIST!
RISE, REBEL, MAKE A FIST, RESIST!
Masochistic
So sadistic
All they see is another statistic
Maybe I'm a misfit, maybe I'm different
It will never be an average existence
Masochistic
So sadistic
All they see is another statistic
If I can't be loved
Then I'll be a hated
It's family fun time
Let's commit a hate crime
