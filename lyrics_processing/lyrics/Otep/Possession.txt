Come, come
Sing to me my muses
Lost in hot cyclops anarchy
Possession
Invention
Blood, blood
Spirits, spirits
Sprits, spirits
Come, come
Where will these visions lead?
How far dare i go?
Where will this song take me?
Into the deep unknown
Spirits, spirits
Come, come
All the prophets and the gods came prepared for this
So we dined on the vine of the mind in pairs
Preaching werewolf prayers on our nightly flight
Gestating all we ate in the pale moonlight
Feel the urge of the power surge -- ignite the soul
Bringing kingdoms under siege with the words that i control
Got an arsenal, ganja blunts and such
Only love can set me free from this Patriarchal clutch
Speaking testaments in our secret dialogue
While the drones begin to feast on the feces of the hog
Take a walk in the wilderness of your mind
Before your soul decides to die and leaves infinity behind
You might also likePossession, invention
Invite discovery
Surrender to pleasure
Lost in ecstasy
Survive
Alive....you are my enemy
You die for lies, slaves to misery
Down on the battleground laying waste to competition
I'm collecting intellects and exhaling solar systems
I decree mutiny
It's revolution US against the patriarchy
The assembler of souls, full of knowledge untold
While i'm spinning webs of wisdom prophecies unfold
Into attack mode to decipher the code
Of Babylon's terror spawn - tyranny reloads
Into the mental stasis - apathy erases
Urgency of rage and it's fightening little places
Prepare for warfare
The afterbirth of knowledge is america's nightmare
Yeah
Possession, invention
Invite discovery
Surrender to pleasure
Lost in ecstasy
Survive
Alive, you are my enemy
You die for lies, slave to misery
Sometimes i sit and ask myself what have i become?
What have i become?
What... have i become?
What... have i become?
What... have i become?
What have i become?
Something's taking over me
Something's taking over me
Something's taking over me
Something's taking over me
Paint your face with the blood of the weak
Self sacrifice everyone you meet
Scream at demons in my veins
Voices of the dead nurturing my pain
I survive, i'm alive
I spread the fever to watch you burn
Killed your leaders to help you learn
