Say what you need to save your soul
But don't fuck with me
I'm losin' control
I'm so tired of this, so sick of you
My tongue is battered and bruised
From all these attitudes
Teach me the magic of your sacred poems
Conjuring a voice of signs and omens
Prophecies, got debris
The syllables, symbol's breath
And then as we climb, divine
To sacrifce our wounded minds
This awkward chance to seek insanity
I can't save you 'cause I hate me
The Lord is my weapon
And I see him shoot pawns
Woman is the Devil
God is a gun
Everyone you knew
Everything you've ever done
Suffer for your freedom
Or die by the law
You might also likeThe Lord is my weapon
And I see him shoot pawns
Woman is the Devil
God is a gun
Everyone you knew
Everything you've ever done
Suffer for your freedom
Or die by the law
Say what you need to save your soul
But leave your religion at the door
Smoking all of Krishna's weed
I'm sick of these weak anarchies
You see me as a place to make a bruise
But in my reality, I'm a slate of the muse
Fuck these hypocrites, together we'll fight
Tyranny of squares, squiggles unite
The Lord is my weapon
And I see him shoot pawns
Woman is the Devil
God is a fraud
Everyone you knew
Everything you've ever done
Suffer for your freedom
Or die by the law
The Lord is my weapon
And I see him shoot pawns
Woman is the Devil
God is a fraud
Everyone you knew
Everything you've ever done
Suffer for your freedom
Or die by the law
All you sinners
Blasphemers
Burn in the pit
The Lord is my weapon
And I see him shoot pawns
Woman is the Devil
God is a gun
Everyone you knew
Everything you've ever done
Suffer for your freedom
Or die by the law
The Lord is my weapon
And I see him shoot pawns
Woman is the Devil
God is a gun
Everyone you knew
Everything you've ever done
Suffer for your freedom
Or die by the law
Save me, save me, save me, save me
Save me, save me, save me, save me
