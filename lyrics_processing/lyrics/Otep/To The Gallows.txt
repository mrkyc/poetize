To resist the dictatorship
Come on!
While you're checking your timelines
I'm on the front lines
Commanding the dissidents
Subverting the paradigm
They used to shoot fascists
Like rabbits in baskets
Now the White House
Is infected with madness
So the battle goes
So we can overthrow
And so the battle goes
Come on!
Blood on your hands
Blood on your suit
Does your necktie
Feel like a noose
Blood on your hands
Blood on your suit
We'll walk you to the gallows
You can choke on the truth
Blood on your hands
Blood on your suit
Does your necktie
Feel like a noose

To resist the dictatorship
Come on!
He's just a morally corrupt
Demagogue
Who's in lust with his daughter
So he pays porn stars
To dress like her
But beware
You can piss in his mouth
You can piss anywhere but
"Watch my hair"
So the battle goes
So we can overthrow
And so the battle goes
Come on!
Blood on your hands
Blood on your suit
Does your necktie
Feel like a noose
Blood on your hands
Blood on your suit
We'll walk you to the gallows
You can choke on the truth
Blood on your hands
Blood on your suit
Does your necktie
Feel like a noose
Traitor!
Does your necktie
Feel like a noose
I told everyone but they wouldn't listen
Now there's orange fingerprints upon the ignition
On the verge of World War 3 and you pretend it isn't
I tried to warn y'all but you wouldn't listen
Now he's inciting riots with nazi terrorism
But we ain't afraid of his evangelism
The Kult of 45 is mentally deficient
Together we will send them back to perdition
Together we will send them back to perdition
(To the gallows)
You've mistaken the ravens
For heavenly angels
They've come to pick your bones
As you swing from the gallows
(To the gallows) 
It's time to pick a side
Who controls your mind?
Who controls you?
Who controls you?
Who controls you?
