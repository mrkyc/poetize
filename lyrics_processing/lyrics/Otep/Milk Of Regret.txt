Was I your revenge?
Was I just your surrogate?
Was I just revenge?
I... have... no regrets... yet
I... have... no regrets...
You'll wish we never took this ride...
You make me do this, you make me do this, you make me...
I wish I was afraid of suicide
Long ago before I died
We should never be this high
I wish I was afraid of suicide
Once was I... made of glass
Long ago, before I cracked...
Once was I... made of glass
Long ago... before I cracked...
You made me do THIS
I just can't forget
The blood
The stitches
The bite marks
The kisses
The glass memories reflecting back
The suffocating black
Ill milk of regret
Just smile and pretend
It never mattered it anyway
Smile and pretend
We never mattered anyway
You might also likeYou'll wish we never took this..
I'm starving
I'm starving...
I'm starving for affection
Your heart is made of ash
And you were just a face to me
A sacrificial lamb
Rejection, Revenge
Deception, Damaged
I might be going down in flames
But you will burn with me
You'll wish we never took this RIDE!
I just can't forget
The blood
The stitches
The bite marks
The kisses
The glass memories reflecting back
The suffocating black
Ill milk of regret
Just smile and pretend
We never mattered anyway
..no one will know
This is the perfect place
To hide the crime and burn the remains...
I was so naive
I refused to feed
Waiting for you to notice me
I was so naive
I refused to feed
Waiting for you...
LIKE A LOVESICK ANOREXIC
I just can't forget
The love you twisted
The lies you enlisted
To kill us quietly and beat me down
I hope you drown in this shit milk of regret
I WON'T F**KING FORGET
I'll hope you drown while you're world is burning down
I'll hope you drown while you're world is burning down
...the whole world is burning
...your whole world is burning
...your whole world is burning
