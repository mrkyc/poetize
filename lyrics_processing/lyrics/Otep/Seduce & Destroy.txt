And when the medicine ran out
And when we didn't speak for days
I could hide inside your smile
Fade
And curl up around the fang
Drained
Wasted away
I'll be your toy
To seduce & destroy
I'll be your toy
To seduce & destroy
(Open wide)
I'll kill
What's killing me!
I'll do what I have to
To kill
What's killing me!
No one is clean
Chemical bondage
Pale as parchment
I'll kill
What's killing me!
You might also likeAbuse me
You can use me
Better living through chemistry!
And when you fall asleep
And when you drop the key
I'll slide it inside your mouth
And say
"Do you wanna play?"
Bang
Blow you away
You'll by my toy
To seduce & destroy
You'll be my toy
To seduce & destroy
(Open wide)
I'll kill
What's killing me!
I'll do what I have to
To kill
What's killing me!
No one is clean
Chemical bondage
Pale as parchment
I'll kill
What's killing me!
Abuse me
You can use me
Better living through chemistry!
On your knees
Coughing up
Prayers made of
Money & Dust
Serrated blades of
Your bated breath
Have made a monster
In the house of death
Punctured, deflated
The snakes in your veins
Evacuated & slithered away
Are you sure you still want to play
This evil little game?
I'll kill
What's killing me!
I'll kill
What's killing me!
A devil made of crystal
Glistens like the sun
Fingers to the head
Pointed like a gun
A devil made of crystal
Glistens like the sun
Fingers to the head
Pointed like a gun
A devil made of crystal
Glistens like the sun
Fingers to the head
Pointed like a gun
A devil made of crystal
A devil made of crystal
A devil made of crystal
Glistens like the sun
Fingers to the head
Pointed like a gun
Pointed like a gun
Pointed like a gun
Pointed like a gun
Are you sure you still want to play
