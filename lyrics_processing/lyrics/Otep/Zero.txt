You taught me to fear
But all I learned was hate
You want me to disappear
But I won't go away
I won't go away
I won't fucking break
You want me to save your world
While your lungs get black
And the oceans boil
And you feed and breed
This kingdom of shit
Bulletproof from the truth
Amour-plated ignorance
I can't abide
Fakes and frauds infecting my life
I'm losing my mind
I'm losing my mind
But I don't give a fuck
I don't give a fuck
I don't give a fuck, fuck, fuck, zero fucks
I don't give a fuck

I don't care what it costs
I don't give a...
Your world is slowly dying
And all you is whine about
The things you can't buy
With money you don't have
So you sell your soul to get the latest fad
The virus of more
Poor little drama whore
You're fucked in the head
Enter glory hole infected with excess
You let the insects know you exist
You'll stab me in the back
And wipe the blade on my chest
I don't give a fuck
I don't give a fuck
The house is a disaster
The car won't start
I want to pick a fight
But it's just too hard
I've got no motivation
I should just give up
They say I'll burn in hell
But I still don't give a fuck
I don't give a fuck
I don't give a fuck
Judge me how I'm living
Zero fucks given
Judge me how I'm living
Zero fucks given
Judge me how I'm living
Zero fucks given
Judge me how I'm living
Zero fucks given
Zero fucks given
Zero fucks given
Judge me how I'm living
Zero fucks given
Fuck
I don't give a fuck, fuck, fuck, zero fucks
I don't give a fuck
I don't give a fuck, not a single fuck
I don't give a fuck
I don't give a fuck
I don't give a fuck
I don't give a fuck
I don't give a fuck
Not a single fuck
