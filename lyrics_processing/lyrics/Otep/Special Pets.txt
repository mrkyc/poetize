When you beg, I get all gooey inside
Tonight I take your eyes, mind and tongue
To spread the word and watch your kingdom come
Another night with you, another wound
You keep me in stitches, you tear me to pieces
I need new voices in my head to speak my secret evils with
I need new lovers in my bed to be my friends and special pets
I need your scent all over me
I need to taste your blasphemy
I need to know with certainty that the nectar was worth the squeeze
It's just the way that we are diseased
It's the blade that stains us
It's the sweetest disease
It's so contagious
It's just the way that we are diseased
I's the blade that stains us
It's the sweetest disease
It's so contagious
Once upon a time
I ripped the wings from my spine
But when I hide inside your eyes
I still pretend that I can fly
You might also likeTell me every secret
So you can fall in love
Then to fall to pieces
I need new voices in my head, a new disguse for me to hide
I need new lovers in my bed to feed my secret appetites
I need your sins all over me
I need to taste this tragedy
I need to know with ceritainty the nectar was worth the squeeze
It's just the way that we are diseased
It's the blade that stains us
It's the sweetest disease
It's so contagious
It's just the way that we are diseased
It's the blade that stains us
It's the sweetest disease
It's so contagious
I'm looking for a friend in my head
(It's just a game we play in the dark)
When you scream, it sounds like a lullaby
When you beg, I get all gooey inside
Tonight I take your eyes and tongue
To spread the word and watch you cum
You keep me in stitches, you tear me to pieces
It's just the way we are diseased
It's the blade that stains us
It's the sweetest disease
