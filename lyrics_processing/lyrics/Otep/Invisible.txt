Speak like we do
Think like we do
Obey
Beneath the cold sun
Watching you walk away
Where my terror runs
In rivers of decay
I am invisible
I'm in this room for days
Teeth on every wall
They never go away
I'm made of blades and flame
I'm sick and dangerous
You're still my favorite prey
'Cause I hurt the ones I love
You're so lovely when you cry
You're so perfect when you lie
You can be my crucifix
(You never saw it coming
You never knew what hit you!)
Hold me up to watch me die
You might also likeCan't you see?
Well, I'm invisible
(Lies, lies
Lies, lies
Lies, lies
Lies, lies)
Beneath the pagan moon
One more prey dies today
On sheets of flesh and doom
Shivering in endless shade
Like criminals
The stain still remains
And I promise you
It never goes away
You're so lovely when you cry
You're so perfect when you lie
You can be my crucifix
(You never saw it coming
You never knew what hit you!)
Hold me up to watch me die
Behold!
Feast your eyes
As the peripherals explode
Can you see me now?
Can you see me now?
The ugly will resign
When the young blood
Eats the light
And one day, this pain
Could save your life
You're so lovely when you cry
You're so perfect when you lie
You can be my crucifix
(You never saw it coming
You never knew what hit you!)
Hold me up to watch me die
(NOW THE BLIND CAN SEE. NOW THEY NOTICE ME)
Laying in the shelter
Laying here alive
We're painting submission across our shadowed skies
Fire on the side, burning bright as i rise lost in flight on you're golden molted wings
Now do you see?
Now do you see?
Now do you
