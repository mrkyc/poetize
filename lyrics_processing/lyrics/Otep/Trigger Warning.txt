They are the few
Our battle cry
Me too
She doesn't see him yet
But he's picked up her scent
Cause she was meant to serve
A trophy he has earned
With the devil in his eye
And violence on his mind
He charms his way inside
Now the spiders caught a fly
It's gnawing it's clawing
Trigger warning
It's gnawing it's clawing
Trigger warning
It's gnawing it's clawing
Trigger warning
It's gnawing it's clawing
He raped her cause the way that her
Dress shaped her while she fell asleep
But he opened her and said
"Bitch, you get what you deserve"

This isn't where the story ends
He didn't know she'd stolen the gun from her friends
And in the darkened room
(Take it off)
She'd ask him to remove
The cross from around his neck
That once belonged to her friend Beth
And he says "I'm really sorry"
(I'm sorry)
She says "Oh no, we're just getting started"
It's gnawing it's clawing
