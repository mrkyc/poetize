Now I'm the girl who became king
I'm not a boss bitch
I'm just a boss, bitch
I'm not a boss bitch
I'm just a boss, bitch
I'm not a boss bitch
I'm just a boss, bitch
I don't need testicles or Benjamins
To be the best there's ever been
It'd take the death of a thousand men
To obey me from my throne again
I'm hotter than cayenne
Ask your girl who the fuck I am
Clark Kent or Superman
Marvelous like Iron Man
Mark Twain with a  hand
Rubbing the parts that break the dam
Now scream my name like they do at my shows
"Otep, but you're a pussy"
Tell me something I don't know
She can keep the straps
She can keep the rope
I'm an alpha, baby
I got plenty of those
You might also likeI'm the girl who became king
I'm not a boss bitch
I'm just a boss, bitch
I'm not a boss bitch
I'm just a boss, bitch
I'm not a boss bitch
I'm just a boss, bitch
I've been fighting stereotypes since I burst on the scene
I've been breaking glass ceilings like iPhone screens
To the critics, the cynics, the drones and the clones
I kept my fist raised even when I was alone
Cause no one believed in me except me
They tried to stifle my fire with gasoline
I followed to verdict, I destroyed them with ease
And now my wolves be howling in the hungry 
I want you to forget everything you've been told
I want you to challenge gender roles
Loud and proud, and yes I'm blessed
But I earned this crown
I'm the girl who became king
I'm not a boss bitch
I'm just a boss, bitch
I'm not a boss bitch
I'm just a boss, bitch
I'm not a boss bitch
I'm just a boss, bitch
