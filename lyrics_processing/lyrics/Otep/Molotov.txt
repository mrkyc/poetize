If they become violent, don't expect us to remain silent
This goes out to all the tainted racists and nazi believers:
Why don't you go find a bunker
And follow your fucking leader!
Throw a molotov and let 'em play catch with it
Nazi scum! Watch 'em run!
Throw a molotov and let 'em play catch with it
Traitor Trump set us up, fuck 'em up
Throw a molotov and let 'em play catch With a fist to the face of the 'superior race'
Cause now there's consequences when you advocate hate
Stepping out of the shadows was your last mistake
If you want a war, you gonna limit your life span
Just like some nazis, the fascists, the ku klux klan
You don't belong on this land
If you're a true believer of the great deceiver
Then hunker down in your bunker, and follow your leader
Throw a molotov and let 'em play catch with it
Nazi scum! Watch 'em run!
Throw a molotov and let 'em play catch with it
Traitor Trump set us up, fuck 'em up
Throw a molotov and let 'em play catch With a fist to the face of the 'superior race'
Cause now there's consequences when you advocate hate
Stepping out of the shadows was your last mistake
You might also likeIt's a season of treason
Opportunists and demons
Morally suffocated
Mentally constipated
Are you a true believer of the great deceiver?
Then hunker down in your bunker, and follow your leader
Throw a molotov and let 'em play catch with it
Nazi scum! Watch 'em run!
Throw a molotov and let 'em play catch with it
Traitor Trump set us up, fuck 'em up
Throw a molotov and let 'em play catch
With a fist to the face of the 'superior race'
Cause now there's consequences when you advocate hate
Stepping out of the shadows was your last mistake
Come on!
Resistance rising!
Here we go!
Bars and stars, fuck your flag!
We ain't never going back!
Bars and stars, fuck your flag!
We ain't never going back!
Bars and stars, fuck your flag!
We ain't never going back!
So if you're a courageous racists and a nazi believer
Then why don't you hunker down in that bunker
