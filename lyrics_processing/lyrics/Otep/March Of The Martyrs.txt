You will know
I will suffer
So you won't
You will know
I will suffer
So you don't
(like a human sacrifice
We pay the price)
& it begins
Like this
Every time
V1
My heart starts reacting
My soul starts collapsing
I'm dancing in fire again
I'm burning & bleeding
The parasites are breeding
It's me versus me versus them
You might also likeI am whore, holy, loved, lonely
Murdering the others now and then
I am barren, fruitful, bored but rarely useful
A sinner seeking manic martyrdom
(chorus)
The devil may care but i don't
No masters, no gods, no laws, no soul
I'm insignificant, i'm shiny & unique
I'm a freak, i'm a f**k-up, i'm suffering
(tunnel)
Touch. taste. feel
Prick the skin
Push it in
Nothing will be wasted
All my hate
All my faith
The cloak becomes sacred
Prick the skin
Push it in
Nothing will be wasted
Touch
Taste
Feel
And you will see
And you will know
We will heal ...
Everything

My heart starts collapsing
My soul starts reacting
I'm back in the fire again
I'm burning & bleeding
The parasites are feeding
It's me versus me & all of them
I am whore, holy, loved, lonely
Murdering the others i have been
I am barren, fruitful, bored but really useful
A sinner seeking manic martyrdom
(chorus)
The devil may care but i don't
No masters, no gods, no laws, no soul
I'm insignificant, i'm shiny & unique
I'm a freak, i'm a f**k-up, i'm martyring
(tunnel)
Prick the skin
Push it in
Nothing will be wasted
All my hate
All my faith
The cloak becomes sacred
Touch
Taste
Feel
Prick the skin
Push it in
Nothing will be wasted
(bridge)
Bred for the slaughter
The march of the martyrs
Bred for the slaughter
The march of the martyrs
Bred for the slaughter
The march of the martyrs
Bred for the slaughter ..
(exodus)
You will know
I will suffer
So you don't
I will suffer
