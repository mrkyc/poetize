Sounds like...armageddon
Sounds like...cum & drink with me
....
Cum & drink with me
And I remember him fucking me
And I remember liking it
I didn't know any better
And I remember the smell, and the pain, & the shame
And I remember being afraid and thinking everyday---
Every single day that it was my fault...
Oh but what happened to that little girl
Who used to dream of one day ruling the world
Who used to draw pretty pictures
In my room---beneath the moon
Destroying to create
Softly praying to god
What do I do now?
What do I do now?
As I secretely masturbate...
But then I'd hear his hooves coming down the floor
With a bible in his hand...
You might also likeSoftly opening my door and he'd say...
DAUGHTER! the day of your atonement is due!
Well there's 3 million sinners out there...
And that includes YOU!
No daddy don't! (2x)
LEAVE ME ALOOOOONE! (3x)
NO I DON'T WANT TO BE FREE! (2x)
SO TAKE YOUR DICK OUT OF ME!
PLEASE TAKE YOUR DICK OUT OF ME! (3x)
I'm bleeding, it's not fair
You see there's this little place I like to go
I like to run and hide---deep inside
Where all the nightmares are real,and all the monsters come alive
Oh, but the things I've seen in soft, soft visions and terrifying prophecies
Like serpents on the take & gods coming in all sizes & shapes
Nothing seems fulfilling anymore
Well your temples are swollen in deceit & the body of your missionary
He's rotting...
Rotting in defeat mama?
MAMA!
Are the aliens coming to take us away? (mama?)
Is armageddon gonna happen again today?
LOOK WHAT HE DID TO ME!! WHY DID YOU DO IT TO ME?
HOW COULD YOU DO IT TO ME!! WHY DID YOU DO IT TO ME?
I WILL NOT CRY -- I WILL NOT CRY
I PREFER DIE!!! than live---this life--of LIES!!!
KILL WHAT U CAN ---- CHALLENGE EVERYTHING
Vengeance is mine
Hey...I'm sorry...baby...
Please come back inside...we can laugh a little...
& live & die
No wait. see, eye got this hot pot of jonestown tea &
Its been brewing for you & me
Oh, it only takes one sip
Come one baby
Surrender your lips
I can take u someplace nice
I can take u...someplace NICE
Breed my disease be my disease and vengeance will be mine
Its closer than u think...
So I entered his room at 32 past noon
With my little ritual knife...
I cut out his tounge
Liberated his wife
She loved me for it other world woman
Well, thats what she called me (destroyer) the one who sets yo free
(cum & drink with me)
We all die like cartoons, surrender your children
