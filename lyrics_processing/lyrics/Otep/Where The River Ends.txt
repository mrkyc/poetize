Come
With me
I will let you see with my words
I will let you burn & observe
But where i go
You can only follow
So close your eyes
Open your mind
......and see
(v.1)
Somewhere
Out in the dark
A car pulls up
& parks
& the passenger
Shifts nervously in her seat
& butterflies
Flutter in her belly
You might also like& the driver
Shuts off the engine
& moves a little close
She giggles a little
As he unbuttons her blouse
She pushes him away
& he whispers
"aw baby don't be that way
I took you out, i treated you tight
Now, don't put up a fight
Come on
I only want to put the tip in
Don't fight, don't fight, come on
This is all your fault you know
Just relax, let me do what i gotta do
& i'll let you go
Don't you love me?
Don't you love me?
Breathe in deep
A sea of desperate dreams
I have no mouth
& I must scream
Breathe in deep
A sea of desperate dreams
I have no mouth.....
(v.2)
And somewhere
In a normal neighborhood
In a normal house
A normal family
Is falling apart
And down the hall
The little ones hide
Frozen as fossils
As their mother cries
Listening
Now that the others have gone silent
The walls blister
As sister rises in defiance
Here
In the depths of the labyrinth
She will make her mark
She travels the cavern
Searching for the Minotaur
& she finds him
Asleep in the heat
Of his triumphs
A sparkle of flame
Flickers in her eye
She nudges him softly
And says "Daddy, wanna give me a try?"
And he rumbles & roar
"You must lick honey from a thorn
If you are to survive this night"
And she says, " no, i'd rather pick a fight."
And he reaches out and she's on the attack
And he's face down and she straddles his back
And as the moonlight fades from his eyes
She sighs
"come on, what's the matter?"
Don't you love me?
Don't YOU love me?
DON'T YOU LOVE ME?
Breathe in deep
A sea of desperate dreams
I have no mouth
& I must scream
Breathe in deep
A sea of desperate dreams
I have no mouth AND I MUST SCREAM!

What we are
You too will become
Liberated children
Of a bloody-hungry god
Sedition!
They used to HANG women like me
Strange fruit on the poplar tree!
They used to OWN women like me
Necessary accessories!
They used to BURN women like me
To quell the fires of liberty
In the blessed fertile crescent
THEY STILL STONE WOMEN LIKE ME!
And one day you will say
Just look at her now!
...and as everything fades to black
...and as the jackals laugh in the aftermath
