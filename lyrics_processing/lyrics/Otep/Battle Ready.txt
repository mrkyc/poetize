Simple souls overload as I explode data banks
'Cause the earth and space gave birth to this paleface
Supreme linguistic mental machine
My brain cells swell the intellect extreme
Fire fills my veins as I proclaim my resistance
To the mind-swapping parasites that feed off my existence
As I skin the burn to relearn the royal plan
Out beyond the edges in the depths of spirit land
Its authentic, apocalyptic destroyer
Damaging challengers resurrection, disorder
A monument of crisis I strike this - you're dead
Line my nest with your soul cleansed in bloodshed

Battle-ready
Poets gonna take control
Battle-ready
Souls violate parole
Battle-ready
Violently invade your home
Breaking the bones of those who pose

Commanding the mic striking up a verb-fest
Mass destruction is my function - time to put it to the test
In combat attacking since way back
In the days I drew praise for the way that I slayed facts
Formulating flows in revolutionary science
It's the catastrophic prophet from the anarchist alliance
Freaking techniques this creature of speech
We feel the fury of devastation 'cause we tasted defeat
I'm alone on my throne in this universe of fear
Royalty divides my soul in this role I'm revered
As the pinnacle lyrical master, queen of disaster
I ruin brain fluid the unknown is what I'm after

Shaking up the world just like the second coming of Christ
When I write thrice divine with this goddess sight
Words will flow wounds will grow
Ewe know bones will be exposed from the force that I unload
It's the soul eater, mic bleeder with the voice of chaos
I got the nectar of the gods flowing from my mental pod
Gather the flock alarm your block
Tell them the shepherds have come and got the keys to unlock
A holy war through your veins it courses
More lyrical artillery than the armed forces
Supernatural styles be volatile
Its the mind manipulator - the war child

Come!
Shadow soldiers!

We came to defy - living life as a lie
We embryonic satellites need our freedom to fly
To watch you die - agonizing cries are heard in stereo
I'm visualizing battlefield scenarios
In the line of fire watching, empires fall
Into attack position eliminate all
My species
