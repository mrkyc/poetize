Don't make a sound
Hush little baby
Don't make a move
This is gonna hurt
Me more than you
If I'm a danger
To myself
Just think what I
Could do to you
Twisting and turning
My insides are burning
Like larva feeding
From the kill
The pestilence of decadence
I worship my emptiness
I'm ravaged by the
Damages of this hell
Eat the children raw
Eat the children raw

As worms are asleep
Operators are standing by
Some Restrictions
May apply
Side effects could include
We'll steal the life
Right out of you
Descending, I'm mending
But still I'm pretending
I regress to become one of them
They gave me this friction
They yield to my diction
I can't repress myself
Eat the children raw

Feasting on bait
These worms are asleep

Just think what I
Could do to you
Role model #1
Taught you how to shave
Role model #2
Took you to the PTA
Tell us how to dress
And teach us to obey
But they never heard a word
That you had to say
For shame
For shame
'Cause I am vermin
I'm the anti-Christ
Just another lonely chapter
In the book of lies
Don't they know
That they are the prey
Don't they know
They are the prey
Don't they know
That they are the prey
Don't they know
I'm predator
Don't they know
They are the prey
Don't they know
I'm predator
Don't they know
I'm insane

Soul restrictions
May oblige
Follow this simple rule
Do unto them before
They do unto you
These wounds cut deep
