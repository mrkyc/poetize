Does the deer forgive the wolf ?
You've stolen my fascination
You've amothered my holy addiction
And now I'm soaked in you
Like fat white worms or sad haikus
I woke up
& the worldwas on the fire
I woke up
& the swine had conspired
To erase all the faith
That I have in the human race
I woke up
& the world was on fire
It's all in your head
It's all in your head
They said I need to flee
Are they shepherds ?
Or are they sheep ?
Are we the butchers ?
Or are we meat ?
You might also likeIn this nest of lies
Living a life under siege
We sink in the stink
& I need my disease
It's all in your head
They said I need to flee
This neverending ordinary monarchy
Beneath the toxic water
Where my secrets come to meet
In catacombs of shadow
& wet skies of mystery
I found a soggy savior
A painted lady made of eyes
She sings to me, my deceit
"your life is a lie"
I woke up
& the world was on fire
I woke up
& the swine had conspired
To erase all the faith
That I have in the human race
I woke up
& the world
Was
On
Fire
It's all in your head
It's all in your head
They said I need to flee
Are they shepherds ?
Or are they sheep ?
Are we the butchers ?
Or are we meat ?
In this nest of lies
Living a life under siege
We sink in the stink
& I need my disease
It's all in your head
They said I need to flee
This neverending ordinary monarchy
If we stand too still
They're gonna eat us alive !
Watch your tongue
Teach them young...
Medicate the mutiny
Better living through chemistry
Self destruction's patriotic
Money fixes everything
Wach your tongue
Teach them young...
We're taught
To love & hate
To fight & obey...
I've lost my mind
But I've found my way
(in this nest of lies
Every wall has eyes)
It's all in your head
It's all in your head
They said I need to flee
Are they shepherds ?
Or are they sheep ?
Are we the butchers ?
Or are we meat ?
In this nest of lies
Living a life under siege
We sink in the stink
& I need my disease
It's all in your head
They said I need to flee
