The dead have names like biblical verses
Matthew 19
Mark 21
John 33
Sent to war to fight for...
I don't think anyone knows anymore
The last breath before death
Before the invisible amputees of PTSD
And then slithering from its den
Came the snake
Trump!

"Let me kiss it I can fix it"
Said the snake
"Let me kiss it I can fix it"
Said the snake
"Let me kiss it I can fix it"
Said the snake
"Let me kiss it I can fix it"
Said the snake

His kiss gave a little pain
As the venom pumps through your veins
This was your mistake
You knew I was a fucking snake
This was your mistake
You knew I was a fucking snake

Send them like cattle to a foreign land"

"Let me kiss it I can fix it"
Said the snake
"Let me kiss it I can fix it"
Said the snake

"Trust me", he said from his den
"Trust me", with a vicious grin
"Trust me, simpletons"
I alone can save your soul
Just give me complete control

His kiss gave a little pain
As the venom pumps through your veins
This was your mistake
You knew I was a fucking snake
This was your mistake

"Let me kiss it I can fix it"
