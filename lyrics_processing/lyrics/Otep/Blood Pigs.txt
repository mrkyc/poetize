Blood pig

I'm sorry I'm ugly
All that I am and I can never live up
I'm failing, I'm angry
Afraid of the ways they pretend to be us
It's fucked up, I'm different
Words remain my only escape
Art saves all of me
Evolving

And now you're walking away!
I'm not afraid
Now you're walking away!
I'm not ashamed
Now you're walking away!

My mistake was trusting you
Blood pigs with creating my fate
With poetry and suffering
I cannibalized every ounce of my pain
I'm still afraid, everyday
These greedy worms, they devour my plagues
I'm not your slave, I'm conquering
You see me rise

And now you're walking away!
I'm not ashamed!
Now you're walking away!
I am not afraid!
Now you're walking away!

No!
You can't hurt me anymore!
You can't hurt me anymore!
Fed from the wound from which we were bled
Vomiting filth in our soft cave heads
Chewing on tissue, tendon and fat
Destroying the things they do not understand!
Tyrant!
Betrayer!
Parasite!
Traitor!

And still you feed them
And still you need them
I'm sorry, I'm ugly
Dangerous can't describe this enough
I'm failing, I'm angry
I use my fear to empower my hate
I'm fucked up, I'm different
Words remain my only escape
Art saves all of me
Evolving

And now you're walking away!
I'm not ashamed
And now you're walking away
I'm not afraid
Now you're walking away!
Now you're walking away!
Now you're walking away!
Yeah!
Map mange ou sans sel!

My mistake was trusting you!
Blood pigs, with creating my fate!
With poetry and suffering
I cannibalized every ounce of my pain
I'm still afraid every day
You still suckle my pain
I'm not your fucking slave
So why are you walking away?

Blood pig!
Why are you walking away?
(Blood pig, blood pig)
Blood pig!
Why are you walking away?
(Blood pig, blood pig)
