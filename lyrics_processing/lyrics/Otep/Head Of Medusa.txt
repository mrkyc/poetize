In that final look
Does the deer forgive the wolf?
You've stolen my fascination
You've smothered my holy addiction
And now i'm soaked in you
Like fat white worms or sad haiku
I woke up
& the world was on the fire
I woke up
& the swine had conspired
To erase all the faith
That i have in the human race
I woke up
& the world was on fire
It's all in your head
It's all in your head
They said i need to flee
You might also likeAre they shepherds?
Or are they sheep?
Are we the butchers?
Or are we meat?
In this nest of lies
Living life under siege
We sink in the stink
& i need my desease
It's all in your head
They said i need to flee
This neverending ordinary monarchy
(v.2)
Beneath the toxic water
Where my secrets come to meet
In catacombs of shadow
& wet skies of mystery
I found a soggy savior
A painted lady made of eyes
She sings to me, of my deceit
"your life is a lie"
I woke up
& the world was on the fire
I woke up
& the swine had conspired
To erase all the faith
That i have in the human race
I woke up
& the world was on fire
It's all in your head
It's all in your head
They said i need to flee
Are they shepherds?
Or are they sheep?
Are we the butchers?
Or are we meat?
In this nest of lies
Living life under siege
We sink in the stink
& i need my desease
It's all in your head
They said i need to flee
This neverending ordinary monarchy
(bridge)
If we stand too still
They're gonna eat us alive!
Watch your tongue
Teach them young...
Medicate the mutiny
Better living through chemistry
Self destruction's patriotic
Money fixes everything
Watch your tongue
Teach them young...
We're taught
To love & hate
To fight & obey...
I've lost my mind
But i've found my way
(in this nest of lies
Every wall has eyes)
It's all in your head
It's all in your head
They said i need to flee
Are they shepherds?
Or are they sheep?
Are we the butchers?
Or are we meat?
In this nest of lies
Living life under siege
We sink in the stink
& i need my desease
It's all in your head
They said i need to flee
