You have 7 more seconds to decipher your life
Before my tongue becomes a blade & your brain gets sliced
I warned you before, i'm addicted to war
I was praying for armageddon on the day i was born
(v.1)
Incite & ignite
Cried my muse
Elevating IQ's as i enter the room
It's elemental
Defying gravity with these
Lyrical miracles & street philosophies
It's the chosen child
Destroying idols like i'm Gideon
Manipulating matter
Transfer data like a pentium
Processor, throw these rocks atcha
I be the queen weaving dreams with supreme lectures
You might also likeInfect ya, lyrically dissect ya
I got control of your soul so no gods can protect ya
"you betcha"!
We can set ya free best believe that this tribe of mystery
Was born and bred to conceive
Brilliant galaxies of mind expanding poetry
Enemies know it's me, armed with mental weaponry
Ain't no testin' me, the tribe comes prepared to get live
You're just a drone to the hive, ain't no way you'll survive
Ravage
Vanquish
Mangle
Destroy
RUN FOR COVER
RUN FOR COVER
NO ONE GETS OUT ALIVE
RUN FOR COVER
RUN FOR COVER
NO ONE GETS OUT ALIVE
(v.2)
Ripped at the seams
I destroy galaxies
Word becomes flesh
I bring nations to its knees
So feel the blast as this broad casts
Out any doubt that real rhymes last
Its the voice of the apocalypse
The god of war
With Osiris' esophagus
An omnivore
Take you higher than the Krsna consciousness
From gotham to metropolis the lesser gods eradicates the obvious
We fight for all of us so get up off the ground
Weapon systems armed it's about to go down
IT'S FOR THE CROWN!
Ravage
Vanquish
Mangle
Destroy
RUN FOR COVER
RUN FOR COVER
NO ONE GETS OUT ALIVE
RUN FOR COVER
RUN FOR COVER
NO ONE GETS OUT ALIVE
(bridge)
Craven!
There will be blood
On my fists
On your face
On the ground around us
This is pain
Have a taste
I'm addicted to the rush
Of bruises & bloodstains
Dark god in my veins
I will hate it all away
No, nothing will remain
The enemy is me!
Your weak, ineffectual plebe!
Even jesus worships me
I bow down to none
Your little light is like a candle
Trying to outshine the sun
RUN FOR COVER
RUN FOR COVER
NO ONE GETS OUT ALIVE
Inside my mind
Where heaven & hell collide
You won't survive
Suck!
& swallow your pride
Suck!
& swallow your pride
No one gets out alive
The enemy is me
