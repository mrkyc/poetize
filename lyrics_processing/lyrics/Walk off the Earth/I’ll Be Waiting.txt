Life is hard and the living's rough
But, these are the times where you gotta stand up
Don't let them break you down or tear you up
These are the times when you gotta stand up

(Eh oh, eh oh oh, eh oh)
You can turn it around
(Eh oh, eh oh oh, eh oh)
You can turn it around

And I'll be waiting here for you
'Till the sun burns out and the stars fall out
I'll be waiting here for you
You know I will be, I'll be
I'll be waiting, waiting, waiting
'Till the sun burns out and the stars fall out
I'll be waiting here for you
You know I will be, I'll be waiting

Day by day might be hard to do
But, these are the times when you gotta push through
Can't let them break you down or bend the truth
These are the times when you gotta push through
You might also like
(Eh oh, eh oh oh, eh oh)
You can turn it around
(Eh oh, eh oh oh, eh oh)
You can turn it around

And I'll be waiting here for you
'Till the sun burns out and the stars fall out
I'll be waiting here for you
You know I will be, I'll be
I'll be waiting, waiting, waiting
'Till the sun burns out and the stars fall out
I'll be waiting here for you
You know I will be, I'll be waiting

Never let them see you break in the middle
Let your heart get too little
Or get lost in the riddle
(Never let them see you break in the middle
Let your heart get too little
Or get lost in the riddle)

And I'll be waiting here for you
'Till the sun burns out and the stars fall out
I'll be waiting here for you
You know I will be, I'll be
I'll be waiting, waiting, waiting
'Till the sun burns out and the stars fall out
I'll be waiting here for you
