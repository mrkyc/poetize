They go to sleep and dream like you and I
Billionaires behind their walls and soldiers in their trenches
We're all just looking for a reason why
To get out of bed in the morning
To fight off the urge to just go call it quits
'Cuz sometimes reality is boring
And it's a shame, but it's just how it is
Everybody's gotta live (yes, they do)
And everybody's gonna die (die die)
Everybody try to have a, a good time
I think you know the reason why
So pour a drink, or have a smoke, cuz we all got our vices
Just doing what we need to to get by
Wear a dress, your Sunday best, whatever you feel nice in
Cuz God knows we all need a reason why
To get out of bed in the morning
To fight off the urge to just go call it quits
'Cuz sometimes reality is boring
And it's a shame, but it's just how it is
Everybody's gotta live (yes, they do)
And everybody's gonna die (die die)
Everybody try to have a, a good time
I think you know the reason why
You might also likeTaxi cars and prison bars, and history repeating
We build our little boxes, you and I
So cross your heart or read your cards, whatever you believe in
'Cuz God knows we all need a reason why
To get out of bed in the morning
To fight off the urge to just go call it quits
'Cuz sometimes reality is boring
And it's a shame, but it's just how it is
Everybody's gotta live (yes, they do)
And everybody's gonna die (die die)
Everybody try to have a, a good time
I think you know the reason why
To get out of bed in the morning
To fight off the urge to just go call it quits
