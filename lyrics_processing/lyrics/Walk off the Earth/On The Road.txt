I don't need fixing 'cause I ain't broken
I'm not there yet but I'm on the road

I might not make it outta bed today
But that doesn't mean that I won't try
I might not say the things I need to say
But that doesn't mean I have to lie

'Cause I've been climbing up these mountains one by one
And always sure to leave a trail of crumbs
I'll brave the storm until I see the sun
And look to you when I don't feel so strong

I don't need fixing 'cause I ain't broken
I don't need saving, just someone to hold
'Cause I've been fighting for both of us
I'm not home yet but I'm on the road
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
I'm not there yet but I'm on the road

I never wanna fall and let you down
I'll do my best to keep feet on the ground
If I stumble, know that I'll come back around (Come back around)
The thought of you will carry me now

I'm coming home, I'm coming home
