Oh oh oh
Sing it all away, sing it all away my darlings

I know a place that will take you away
Your troubles no longer remain from the day
I found a love there, it's hard to escape
It cures me at night, but it hurts when I wake
There's no judge and the jury's at bay
Cause this is our house where the melodies play
If worries still linger, my friends and I say
"Top up your cup and let's sing it all away,"

Oh oh oh
Sing it all away, sing it all away, my darlings
Oh oh oh
Sing it all away, sing it all away and I'll carry you home
Oh oh oh...

Sometimes people say, "don't burn your life away"
But they don't hear this song, it's just a holiday
From the go go go go
I say no no no worries here, let's all just sway
Top up your cup, let's sing it all away
You might also like
Oh oh oh
Sing it all away, sing it all away my darlings
Oh oh oh
Sing it all away, sing it all away and I'll carry you home
Oh oh oh... carry you home
Oh oh oh...

The last call sounds, bartender says it loud
Just one more round before they kick us out
If you fall down I'll meet you on the ground
(No worries here, let's all just sway
Top up your cup, let's sing it all away)
Oh oh oh
Sing it all away, sing it all away my darlings

Oh oh oh
Sing it all away, sing it all away my darlings
Oh oh oh
Sing it all away, sing it all away and I'll carry you home
Oh oh oh...
I'll carry you home
Oh oh oh...
I'll carry you home
Oh oh oh...
I'll carry you home
Just one more round
I'll carry you home
If you fall down
When worries still linger my friends and I say
