So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
You come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop
Walk off the Earth on the jukebox
And then we start to dance
And now I'm singing like
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Eh oh eh oh eh oh eh ohhh
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you

We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty
So go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
And leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play
And I'm singing like
No, I don't want no scrub
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hanging out the passenger side
Of his best friend's ride
Trying to holler at
Boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Eh oh eh oh eh oh eh ohhh
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you
I like the way you work it
No diggity, you got to bag it up, bag it up
(Noooo)
No diggity
(Scrub)
No, no
I like the way you work it
No diggity, you got to bag it up, bag it up
Can't get her out of my mind
Well, I think about the girl all the time
(Trying to holler at me)
Eh oh eh oh eh oh eh ohhh
I'm in love with your body
Eh oh eh oh eh oh eh ohhh
You got to bag it, bag it up, baby
Eh oh eh oh eh oh eh ohhh
I'm in love with your body
