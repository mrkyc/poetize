Maybe it's 6:45
Maybe I'm barely alive
Maybe you've taken my shit for the last time, yeah
Maybe I know that I'm drunk
Maybe I know you're the one
Maybe I'm thinking it's better if you drive
Not too long ago, I was buskin' for dollars
Know it's really real if you hadn't met my mama
You don't want a girl like me, I'm too crazy
But every other girl you meet is fugazi
I'm sure them other girls were nice enough
But you need someone to spice it up
So if you wanna party, call me, call me
We can rev it up like a Harley, Harley
Why is the best fruit always forbidden?
I'm coming to you now doing twenty over the limit
The red light, red light, stop
I don't play when it comes to my heart, let's get it though
I don't really want a white horse and a carriage
I'm thinking more of white Porsches and karats
I need you right here 'cause every time you call
I play with this kitty like you play with your guitar

'Cause girls like you run 'round with guys like me
'Til sun down when I come through
I need a girl like you, yeah yeah
Girls like you love fun, and yeah, me too
