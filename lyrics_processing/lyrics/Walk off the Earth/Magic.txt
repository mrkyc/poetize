I got the magic in me
Every time I touch that track, it turns into gold
Everybody knows I've got the magic in me
When I hit the floor, the girls come snappin' at me
Now everybody wants some presto magic
Magic, magic, magic
Magic, magic, magic
Magic, magic, magic
Oooh, I got the magic in me

These tricks that I'll attempt will blow your mind
Pick a verse, any verse, I'll hypnotize with every line
I'll need a volunteer, how about you, girl, with the eyes?
Why don't you come on down to the front, and stand right here and don't be shy
I'll have you time travellin', have your mind b-b-babblin'
People tryna inherit the skill, so they askin' me
Even David Blaine had to go and take some classes in
I see Mindfreak like, "What's up man, what's happenin'?"
So come one, come all, and see the show tonight
Prepare to be astounded, no ghost or poltergeist
You know I'm no Pinocchio, but I've never told a lie
So call me Mr. Magic Man, I float on cloud nine

I got the magic in me (I got the magic, baby)
Every time I touch that track, it turns into gold (You know it turns to gold)
Everybody knows I've got the magic in me (I got the magic, baby)
When I hit the floor, the girls come snappin' at me (They be snappin', baby)
Now everybody wants some presto magic
Magic, magic, magic
Magic, magic, magic
Magic, magic, magic
Oooh, I got the magic in me

Take a journey into my mind
See why it's all venom I rhyme
Stay on the road, so I call my momsy when I got time
I hit the stage, go insane, and jump into that crowd
See, see, when I rhyme, I flow on the beat like pidda-dow-dow
See I deceive you with my intergalactic ether
I sing just like Aretha, so respect me like I'm Cesar
I kick it like Adidas, flowin' sticky like adhesive
Be cautious, 'cause what I be on, baby, leave you with amnesia, wha
Break all the rules like Evel Knievel
It's a spectacular show, 'cause my heart pumps diesel, ah
Whatever you saying, it don't entertain my ego
I do this every day, man, Hocus Pocus is my steelo

I got the magic in me (I got the magic, baby)
Every time I touch that track, it turns into gold (You know it turns to gold)
Everybody knows I've got the magic in me (Oh, I got the magic, baby)
When I hit the floor, the girls come snappin' at me (They be snappin', baby)
Now everybody wants some presto magic
Magic, magic, magic
Magic, magic, magic
Magic, magic, magic
Oooh, I got the magic in me
