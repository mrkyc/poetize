Half of my heart is in Havana, ooh na-na (hey, hey)
He took me back to East Atlanta, na-na-na (hey)
Half of my heart is in Havana
There's something 'bout his manners (uh huh)
Havana

He didn't walk up with that "how you doing?"
When he came in the room
He said there's a lot of girls I can do with
But I can't without you
I knew him forever in a minute
That summer night in June
And papa says he got malo in him
Got me feeling like

Oooh-oooh-aah, I knew it when I met him
I loved him when I left him
Got me feeling like
Oooh-oooh-aah, and then I had to tell him
I had to go, oh na-na-na-na-na

Havana, ooh na-na (hey)
Half of my heart is in Havana, ooh na-na (hey, hey)
He took me back to East Atlanta, na-na-na (hey)
Half of my heart is in Havana
There's something 'bout his manners
Havana, ooh na-na

That summer night in June
Gimme your heart, make it real
