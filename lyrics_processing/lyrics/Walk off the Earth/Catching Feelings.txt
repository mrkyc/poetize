Oh, oh-oh
Now I'm catching feelings
Don't know what to say or do
And I say

Up at night wondering why
Do I try so hard? I hate this part
In my mind, run a million miles and I
Just can't seem to stop
Told myself I'd be playing it cool
Keeping one foot in, one foot out the door
Every day, every moment apart
Only makes me want you more

So let's keep it light, the timing ain't right
You still call your ex for casual sex
I know you know that I do the same thing too
And we said
Let's keep it light when we spend the night
And see how it goes if nobody knows
Then down the road we got nothing real to lose

And I say, oh, oh-oh
Now I'm catching feelings
Don't know what to say or do
And I say, oh, oh-oh (Oh, oh-oh)
I stare at the ceiling
Are you catching feelings too?
You might also like
These feelings got me falling, got me falling into you
These feelings got me falling, got me falling into you
These feelings got me

Waking up, nothing from you
Yeah, we had no plans, I can't stand the place
That my mind already goes to
What am I gonna do with myself if I'm finding out
You're falling in love with somebody else?
Lied to myself and tried to get over you

And I say, oh, oh-oh
Now I'm catching feelings
Don't know what to say or do
And I say, oh, oh-oh (Oh, oh-oh)
I stare at the ceiling
Are you catching feelings too?

These feelings got me falling, got me falling into you
These feelings got me falling, got me falling into you

If I said
Let's make it last, we don't need the past
To see how it feels to do this for real
And one day become the one growing old with you
Then you said, oh, oh-oh
Now I'm catching feelings
Don't know what to say or do
And I say, oh, oh-oh (Oh, oh-oh)
I stare at the ceiling
Are you catching feelings too?

These feelings got me falling, got me falling into you
These feelings got me falling, got me falling into you
