I didn't mean to end his life, I know it wasn't right
I can't even sleep at night, can't get it off my mind
I need to get out of sight before I end up behind bars
What started out as a simple altercation
Turned into a real sticky situation
Me just thinking on the time that I'm facing
Makes me wanna cry

'Cause I didn't mean to hurt him
Coulda been somebody's son
And I took his heart when I pulled out that gun
Rum bum bum bum, rum bum bum bum, rum bum bum bum
Man Down!
Rum bum bum bum, rum bum bum bum, rum bum bum bum
Man Down!

Oh, mama, mama, mama, I just shot a man down
In central station, in front of a big ol' crowd
Oh, why? Oh, why?
Oh, mama, mama, mama, I just shot a man down

Never thought I'd do it
I never thought I'd do it
Never thought I'd do it
Oh gosh, what ever happened to me
Whatever happened to me
Whatever happened to me?
Why did I pull the trigger
Pull the trigger, pull the trigger? Boom!
And end a man, end a man life so soon?
When mi pull the trigger, pull the trigger, pull it pon' you
Somebody tell me what I'm gonna, what I'm gonna do

When mi went downtown
'Cause now I am a criminal, criminal, criminal
Oh lord of mercy, now I am a criminal
Man Down

Run out a town none a dem cah see me now, see me now

Oh, mama, mama, mama, I just shot a man down
In central station, in front of a big ol' crowd
Oh, why? Oh, why?
