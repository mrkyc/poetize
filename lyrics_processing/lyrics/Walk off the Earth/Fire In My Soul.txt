I got that fire in my soul

Locked and loaded, don't I know it
Oh the moment is right to ignite, let's get going
I'm not waiting, hesitating
So tonight we roll
I got that fire in my soul

Hey, no stop drop and roll
Let's let this mother burn out of control
Don't need no timber for stoking the coals
I'll get this fire higher
I got that fire in my soul

I'll get this fire higher
I got that fire in my soul
I'll get this fire higher
I got that fire in my soul
Fire!
I got that fire in my soul

Foolish devils, running rebels
Ain't no end to the night when it's going mental
Hot and hazy, got me crazy
So tonight we roll
I got that fire in my soul

Hey, no stop drop and roll
Let's let this mother burn out of control
Don't need no timber for stoking the coals
I'll get this fire higher
I got that fire in my soul

I'll get this fire higher
I got that fire in my soul
I'll get this fire higher
I got that fire in my soul
Fire!

Let's let this mother burn out of control
I'll get this fire higher
I got that f-f-fire
(I got that fire in my soul)
(I got that fire in my soul)
I'll get this fire higher
I got that (fire in my soul)
(I got that fire in my soul)
(I got that fire in my soul)
I'll get this fire higher
I got that fire in my soul
(I got that fire in my soul)
(I got that fire in my soul)
I'll get this fire higher
I got that fire in my soul
(I got that fire in my soul)
(I got that fire in my soul)
I'll get this fire higher
