I say I rule the world

Don't cloud my vision
I'm telling you not today
'Cause I'm seeing straight
Made my decision
Made it through the shades of grey
Made it my own way

I materialize the feeling
To carry on, to carry on
I know some will say I'm dreaming
But I carry on, I carry on

They say "No way"
Oh, I say "I rule the world"
Ain't afraid of the walls, I'mma break them down
They stay the same
Well, I'm feelin' high as a bird
Ain't afraid of the ground, I'mma stay up
I say "Yeah, yeah, yeah"
They say "No, no, no"
They say "Slow, slow, slow"
I say "Go, go, go"
They say "No way"
I say "I rule the world"
I say "I rule the world"

I chased illusion
Then I watched it fade to black
Throwing me off track
Found revolution
Found it in a simple fact
I ain't coming back

I materialize the feeling
To carry on, to carry on
I know some will say I'm dreaming
But I carry on, I carry on

They say "No way"
Oh, I say "I rule the world"
Ain't afraid of the walls, I'mma break them down
They stay the same
Well, I'm feelin' high as a bird
Ain't afraid of the ground, I'mma stay up
I say "Yeah, yeah, yeah"
They say "No, no, no"
They say "Slow, slow, slow"
I say "Go, go, go"
They said "No way"
I say "I rule the world"
I say "I rule the world"
I say "I rule the world"
They said "No way", oh, I say "I rule the world"
Ain't afraid of the walls, I'mma break them down
They stay the same, well, I'm feelin' high as a bird
Ain't afraid of the ground, I'mma stay up
I say "Yeah, yeah, yeah"
They say "No, no, no"
They say "Slow, slow, slow"
I say "Go, go, go"
They say "No way"
I say "I rule the world"
I say "I rule the world"
I say "I rule the world"
I say "I rule the world"
