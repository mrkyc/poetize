Saturday morning, jumped out of bed and put on my best suit
Got in my car and raced like a jet, all the way to you
Knocked on your door with heart in my hand to ask you a question
'Cause I know that you're an old-fashioned man

Can I have your daughter for the rest of my life?
Say yes, say yes
'Cause I need to know
You said I'll never get your blessing 'til the day I die
Tough luck, my friend, but the answer is no!

Why you gotta be so rude?
Don't you know I'm human too?
Why you gotta be so rude?
I'm gonna marry her anyway
Marry that girl
Marry her anyway
Marry that girl
No matter what you say
Marry that girl
We'll be a family

Why you gotta be so
Rude
Why you gotta be so
Rude
Rude!

I hate to do this, you leave no choice
Can't live without her
Love me or hate me, we will be boys
Standing at that altar
Or we will run away
To another galaxy, you know
You know she's in love with me
She will go anywhere I go

Can I have your daughter for the rest of my life?
Say yes, say yes, cause I need to know
You say I'll never get your blessing 'til the day I die
Tough luck, my friend, but the answe is no!

Why you gotta be so rude?
Don't you know I'm human too?
Why you gotta be so rude?
I'm gonna marry her anyway
Marry that girl
Marry her anyway
Marry that girl
No matter what you say
Marry that girl
We'll be a family
Why you gotta be so
Rude
Why you gotta be so
Rude
Rude!
