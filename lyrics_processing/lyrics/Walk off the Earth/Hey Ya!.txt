My baby don't mess around
Because he loves me so
And this I know for sure
But does he really want it
But can't stand to see me
Walking out that door?
Don't try to fight the feeling
'Cause the thought alone is killing me right now
Thank God for Mom and Dad
For sticking to together
'Cause we don't know how

Hey ya! Hey ya!
Hey ya! Hey ya!

Check it out! You think you got it
Oh, you think you got it
But "got it" just don't get it
When there's nothing at all
We've been together
Oh, we've been together
But separate's always better
When there's feelings involved
If what they say is "Nothing is forever"
Then what makes, then what makes, then what makes
Then what makes, what makes, what makes
What makes love the exception?
Oh why oh why oh, why oh why oh why oh
Are we so in denial
When we know we're not happy here?

Don't let me break this down for nothing
I want to see you on your baddest behavior
Lend me some sugar, 'cause I am your neighbor! Come on, come on now
