Don't you raise the sails anymore
It's for sure, I've spent my whole life at sea
And I'm pushin' age seventy three
Now there's only one place that was meant for me
Oh, to be home again
Down in Old Virginny
With my very best friend
They call him 'Ragtime Willie'
We're gonna soothe away the rest of our years
We're gonna put away all of our tears
That big rockin' chair won't go nowhere
Slow down, Willie boy
Your heart's gonna give right out on you
It's true, and I believe I know what we should do
Turn the stern and point to shore
The seven seas won't carry us no more
Oh, to be home again
Down in Old Virginny
With my very best friend
They call him 'Ragtime Willie'
I can't wait to sniff that air
Dip'n snuff, I won't have no care
That big rockin' chair won't go nowhere

The flyin' Dutchman's on the reef
It's my belief, we've used up all our time
This hill's too steep to climb
And the days that remain ain't worth a dime
Oh, to be home again
Down in Old Virginny
With my very best friend
They call him 'Ragtime Willie'
Would a been nice just to see the folks
Listen once again to the stale jokes
That big rockin' chair won't go nowhere
I can hear somethin' callin' on me
And you know where I want to be
Oh Willie don't you hear that sound
Oh to be home again down in Old Virginny
I just want to get my feet back on the ground
Oh to be home again down in Old Virginny
I'd love to see my very best friend
They call him 'Ragtime Willie'
I believe old rockin chair's got me
