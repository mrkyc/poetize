Don't you break my heart
Pleeeeease don't do it, don't you break my heart
I sacrificed to make you happy, kept nothing for myself
Now you wanna leave me for the love of someone else
My pride is all gone whether I'm right or wrong
I need you baby for to keep on keepin' on
You know I'm trying to do my best
Oh I'm trying to do my best
Don't do it, don't you break my heart
Pleeeeease don't do it, don't you break my heart
My biggest mistake was loving you too much and letting you know
Now you got me where you want me and you won't let me go
If my heart was made of glass well then you'd surely see
How much heartache and misery, girl, you've been causing me
While I've been trying to do my best
Well I've tried to do my best
Don't do it, don't you break my heart
Pleeeeease don't do it, don't you break my heart
Go down to the river and there I be
I'm gonna jump in girl, but you don't care bout me
Open up your eyes
Can't ya see I love ya?
Open up you heart, girl
Can't ya see I need ya?
