Shooting stars in midnight pastures
And hanging out on clouds beneath the moon
Hitching rides on magic carpets
It's a fairy tale to me but you're in tune
You're shattered by the final frame
Of the movie scene that generates your every aim
You ain't no bird and so for what it s worth
Gonna bring you straight back down down

Straight back down
Come back down
Straight back down
Straight back down to earth

In times when you're in need of assistance
You're looking for a lead and in the distance
You hear them calling come back down again
But you don't know how, you don't know where and don't know when
You're shattered by the final frame
Of the movie scene that generates your every aim
You ain't no bird and so for what it s worth
Gonna bring you straight back down to earth
You might also like
Straight back down
Come back down
Straight back down
Straight back down to earth

Don't wanna wanna be misled
Don't wanna fall on a razor's edge and
You feel at ease you're begging please don't take me down for nothing
Don't wanna wanna be misled
Don't wanna fall on a razor's edge and
You feel at ease you're begging please don't take me down for nothing
You're shattered by the vital pain
That is needed now to tell you not to go insane
You're tempted by, I say the cooling breeze
That will bring you down oh come back please!

Straight back down
Come back down
Straight back down
Straight back down to earth
Don't wanna wanna be misled
Don't wanna fall on a razor's edge and
You feel at ease you're begging please don't take me down for nothing
Don't wanna wanna be misled
Don't wanna fall on a razor's edge and
