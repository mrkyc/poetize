Just get on the case
Crazy sheep, you are the odd one out

Freak that's on the street
Well I can see the sorrow in your eyes
How long (How long)
How low (How low)
How high can you go (Can you go)
There'll be a bind for every kind
You'll see
Sensitive child, your threat is so mild
It worries me
Build yourself some protection to avoid the injection
Then you can be happy

Now crazy sheep, let them know what you're all about
