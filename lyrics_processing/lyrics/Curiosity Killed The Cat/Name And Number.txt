I sure wish you'd hurry home
I think I'm lost and I wanna be found
Feels like I'm wondering round nowhere land
All I'm after is to see your sunshine smile and laughter
I feel like calling you, feel like some contact
I feel like phonin', but I can't get through

I'm trapped in a timelock zone
Gonna have to face this on my own
Still gonna wonder round that nowhere land
And all I'm holding is one solid silver colour coin that is
Silver in appearance, yeah
But it's peanuts in value, I say
