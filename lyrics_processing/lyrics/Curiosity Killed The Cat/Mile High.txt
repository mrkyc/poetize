Earthly sounds from all around the DJ's going through a phase
Watching all the cars go by fascination entertains,  singing -
"I won't hurt you, I won't hurt you, I won't hurt you bad"
(I won't hurt ya, I won't hurt ya, I won't hurt ya...)
"I won't hurt you, I won't hurt you, I won't hurt you bad"
(I won't hurt ya, I won't hurt ya, I won't hurt ya...)
Chorus:
Neither friend or neither foe
Moving fast and moving slow
I ain't got that time
I'm walking on thin ice, Mile high
To get to your soul
Watching all those jailbirds cry "I'm innocent, I'm not to blame"
With earthly sounds from all around "I really can't take it no more!"
With black ice streets as cold as can be, the forecast seems to claim,  singing -
"I won't hurt you, I won't hurt you, I won't hurt you, no no I won't"
(I won't hurt ya, I won't hurt ya, I won't hurt ya...)
"I won't hurt you, I won't hurt you now, I won't hurt you bad"
(I won't hurt ya, I won't hurt ya, I won't hurt ya...)
