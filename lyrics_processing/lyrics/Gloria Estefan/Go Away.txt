Come on, come on, just go away now
Come on, come on, come on and go now, just go
Come on, come on, come on and go now
Come on, come on, just go away now
Come on, come on, come on and go now, just go
Go away, won't you just go away?
Go away, don't you come back one day
Take your stuff, take all of your precious things
Leave right now, who knows what tomorrow brings
Stay away, would you please stay away?
Live your life, but live it real far away
Save yourself, there's no way to get it all
Look around, the writing is on the wall
And when you go I won't miss you at all
And when you go I'll be havin' a ball
You will see
Thoughts of you won't ever cross my mind
It's the truth, don't mean to be unkind
But people have a right to party
And you won't let them have their fun
See ya wouldn't wanna be ya
Auf wiedersehen, au revoir, shalom

Go away, won't you please go away?
Go away, you're outta here, come what may
Hit the road, don't bother to say good-bye
Don't care how, don't even matter why
And when you go I won't miss you at all
And when you go I'll be havin' a ball
You will see
Thoughts of you won't ever cross my mind
It's the truth, don't mean to be unkind
Hey, Gloria! Hey, Gloria!
Hey, Gloria! Hey, Gloria!
