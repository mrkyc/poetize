There's no way to say forever
It may not realize your dreams
And love sometimes is like the blowing wind
It can take us to wherever
Sending us on silent wings
But I have broken all the rules of love
I never dreamed that I could come this far
And now I'm lost in my emotions
You're becoming my devotion
There's nothing I can do to stop this love for you
I was not supposed to fall in love with you
I have someone else and someone else is loving you
And I was not supposed to let this love get through
So let me say for real: Heaven's what I feel when I'm with you
This feeling is forever, it is forever
You make me feel like Heaven, I feel like Heaven
My love is true when I'm with you
How could I have known that in your eyes
I would find the deepest answers to the questions of my heart
And how could I have known that by your side
Was the light to fill the darkness in the shadows of my life
