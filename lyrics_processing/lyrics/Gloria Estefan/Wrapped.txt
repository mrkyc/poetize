Keep every tear like an ocean
For every day that my fortune
Kept me from being with you
I craddle your faith that reveals me
Grows like a flower, then heals me
Fills me with promise anew

I carry you on disillusion
When my pathetic confusion
Kept me from speaking the truth
I'm simply a coin in your fountain
Lost like the seconds I'm counting
'til I am closer to you

I cherish every morning that found us
With the night scattered around us
Faded and painting me blue
I carry your joy in my footsteps
Making my way to your harbour
Don't need to go any farther
You are my sun and my moon

Wrapped in your arms where it's peaceful
Back in your arms where I'm happy
I would do anything gladly
Only to see you again
Wrapped in your arms I can wander
Up to the heaven's above me
Hearing you say that you love me
Back in your arms where I'm free
You might also like
Keep every phrase barely spoken
Left from your lips they have broken
Free as you give me your love
My yearning is constant and steady
When I'm with you
I'm already
Everything I can become

I cherish every morning that found us
With the night scattered around us
Faded and painting me blue
I carry your joy in my footsteps
Making my way to your harbour
Don't need to go any farther
You are my sun and my moon

Wrapped in your arms where it's peaceful
Back in your arms where I'm happy
I would do anything gladly
Only to see you again
Wrapped in your arms I can wander
Up to the heaven's above me
Hearing you say that you love me
Back in your arms where I'm free
Wrapped in your arms where it's peaceful
Back in your arms where I'm happy
I would do anything gladly
Only to see you again
Wrapped in your arms I can wander
Up to the heaven's above me
Hearing you say that you love me
