I went away, just when you needed me so
Filled with regret, I come back begging you
Forgive forget, with a love we once knew

Open up your eyes, then you'll realize
Here I stand with my, everlasting love
Need you by my side, want to be your bride
You'll never be denied, everlasting love
From the very start, open up your heart
Be a lasting part of everlasting love
Real love to last forever
Real love to last forever
Where life's river flows, no one really knows
Till someone's there to show the way to lasting love
Like the sun that shines, endlessly it shines
You always will be mine. It's eternal love
Whenever love went wrong, ours would still be strong
We'd have our very own, everlasting love
Real love to last forever
Real love to last forever
