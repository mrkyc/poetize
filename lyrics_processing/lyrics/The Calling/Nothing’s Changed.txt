Oh, it was a day just like this
In a life of our times
Shrugging signs there's no chance for us
It's not mine to decide

You never listened to what I said
You never thought I'd succeed
And though I've given you all I can
You show no faith in me

And I remember, and I recall
And I can see that nothing's changed at all
Though we falter, we don't have to fall
And I can see that nothing's changed at all

Even when I was young, oh
And the pressure was on, yeah
You always told me to do my thing
So what the hell went wrong

And I remember, and I recall
And I can see that nothing's changed at all
Though we falter, we don't have to fall
And I can see that nothing's changed at all

An outcast coming home, opinions stay the same
They'll spit them out and spin me right back through the door
The louder that we scream, the more invisible we seem
Is it gonna last forever? Yeah

We don't have to fall
Nothing's changed at all
Is it gonna last forever, forever? Yeah

Oh, now I'm learning the lies, oh
From the skies where they reign
Can't find shelter for myself
And you're all to blame

And I remember, and I recall
And I can see that nothing's changed at all
Though we falter, we don't have to fall
And I can see that nothing's changed at all

(And I remember, and I recall)
Oh, And I can see that nothing's changed at all
(Though we falter, we don't have to fall)
And I can see that nothing's changed at all
(And I remember, and I recall)
And I can see that nothing's changed at all
Though we falter, we don't have to fall
