Heaven's in your eyes
And it's beggin' me to lie
Waiting for a little more of those words you wanna hear but
The silence weighs on me
And I think it's time to leave
Before I go, you gotta know why nothing's ever clear

Said, "I'm waiting for you, I'm waiting to know you"
But I don't even understand myself
So don't ask me why

You know I'll have to walk away
Don't you try to stop and save me
When it all falls down, when it all falls down
You know I've tried but I can't change
So go ahead and blame me
When it all falls down
'Cause it'll all fall down

In the spider web, I'm trapped by what I've said
'Cause you can see, I'll never be what you really want so
I'll just hide behind this attitude, dissolve my pride
It's made the choice to keep your voice from creeping to my inside
You might also like
Said, "I'm waiting for you, I'm waiting to know you"
Can't forgive if I won't let you help
What do you want from me?

You know I'll have to walk away
Don't you try to stop and save me
When it all falls down, when it all falls down
You know I've tried but I can't change
So go ahead and blame me
When it all falls down
'Cause it'll all fall down

Even if I tried
Even if I lied to you
It wouldn't make it any better
Well now, even if I lose
The one that I would choose would be you

Said, "I'm waiting for you, I'm waiting to know you"
But I don't even understand myself
So don't ask me why, don't ask me why
You know I'll have to walk away
Don't you try to stop and save me
When it all falls down, when it all falls down
You know I've tried but I can't change
So go ahead and blame me
When it all falls down
'Cause it'll all fall down

Oh, then oh, when it all falls down
When it all, when it all falls down
