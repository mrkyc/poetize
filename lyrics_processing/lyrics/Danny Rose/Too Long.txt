It's been too long, too long, too long
I don't care about who's right and who's wrong
Time to move on, move on, move on
I've been running down this road for too long
It's been too long, too long, too long
I don't care about who's right and who's wrong
Time to move on, move on, move on
I've been running down this road for too long

All these directions on a one way road
All these religions, all these unsaved souls
Maybe we can see it someday though
Left wing, right wing, same runway though
All these voices everyone stays drowned
Raining bullets when the flood came down
See shells on the bloodstained ground
In this war for the unclaimed crown

It's been too long, too long, too long
I don't care about who's right and who's wrong
Time to move on, move on, move on
I've been running down this road for too long
It's been too long, too long, too long
I don't care about who's right and who's wrong
Time to move on, move on, move on
I've been running down this road for too long

All these filters, are we perfect yet?
Zani molly and the percocet
It don't matter just how numb we grow
We all models with no runway though
Gotta pile up the cash real high
Throw it up into the ash-filled sky
Can't please them all so I don't bite my tongue
If I did, I spit and wipe my blood

It's been too long, too long, too long
I don't care about who's right and who's wrong
Time to move on, move on, move on
I've been running down this road for too long
It's been too long, too long, too long
I don't care about who's right and who's wrong
Time to move on, move on, move on
I've been running down this road for too long

Scattered roadside memorials, dirt meets the paved earth
The fog is dense, still we search for a savior
Fork in the road, any course that it goes
Look how warped that it grows, what's the source of it though?
Zig zag, switchbacks on the cliffside
Mainstream whiplash from the riptide
Trapping in the current while the ashes are burning
But we keep on throwing gas on this furnace
It's been too long, too long, too long
I don't care about who's right and who's wrong
Time to move on, move on, move on
I've been running down this road for too long
It's been too long, too long, too long
I don't care about who's right and who's wrong
Time to move on, move on, move on
I've been running down this road for too long

(Running down this road for too long!)
Too long, too long
(Don't give a fuck about who's right and who's wrong)
Move on, move on
(Too long, too long)
