The full moon
Is shining like a spotlight
I could just sit and listen to you talking all night
When you whisper
Yeah, baby, when you lean in
I get a crazy, crazy good kind of feeling

It's like an amen from the back of the choir
Sweet hum of freedom underneath the tires
Kick back, sitting by a crackling fire
Strumming them guitar strings
Like an old song on the radio
That you grew up to and everybody knows
Rushing of the water when the river rolls
Winding wild and free
Baby, you sound good to me
Baby, you sound so good to me
Mmmm, mmmm, mmmm, like a melody
Baby, you sound good to me

Tell me
All of your stories
And don't you leave nothing out
'Cause baby, I ain't in a hurry
Every little thing you say
Got a real nice ring to it
The way it rolls off your lips
Oh, when you give me that kiss
You might also like
It's like an amen from the back of the choir
Sweet hum of freedom underneath the tires
Kick back, sitting by a crackling fire
Strumming them guitar strings
Like an old song on the radio
That you grew up to and everybody knows
Rushing of the water when the river rolls
Winding wild and free
Baby, you sound good to me
Baby, you sound so good to me
Mmmm, mmmm, mmmm, like a melody
Baby, you sound good to me

Baby, you sound good to me
Baby, you sound so good to me
Mmmm, mmmm, mmmm, like a melody
Baby, mmmm, mmmm

Like an amen from the back of the choir
Sweet hum of freedom underneath the tires
Kick back, sitting by a crackling fire
Strumming them guitar strings
Like an old song on the radio
That you grew up to and everybody knows
Rushing of the water when the river rolls
Winding wild and free
Baby, you sound good to me
Baby, you sound so good to me
Mmmm, mmmm, mmmm, like a melody
Baby, you sound good (sound so good)
Baby, you sound good to me (sound so good)
Baby, you sound so good to me (sound so good)
Mmmm, mmmm, mmmm, like a melody
