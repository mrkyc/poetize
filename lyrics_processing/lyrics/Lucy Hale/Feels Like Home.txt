Ten years old, hair running wild
Dirt on my face and a naughty smile
I was so in love with the place
That I called home
Fourteen, growing up fast
Chasing boys and skipping class
Double daring on the kiss me back
Scared down to the bone

'Cause there's no one that I gotta be
It all comes down to the simple things
It feels like home and family
My feet in the red clay
My heart runs like the Mississippi
All the way back from the big city
When the sun goes down at the end of the day
Nowhere else can make me feel this way

It feels like home
It feels like home
It feels like home
It feels like home, feels like home

Sixteen on a jet plane
Yeah, nothing's ever gonna be the same
Way out here, it don't even rain
In the city of angels
Even though I like it here
I get scared that I'll disappear
So I close my eyes, start clicking my heels
I remember how it feels

Where there's no one that I gotta be
It all comes down to the simple things
It feels like home and family
My feet in the red clay
My heart runs like the Mississippi
All the way back from the big city
And when the sun goes down at the end of the day
Nowhere else can make me feel this way

It feels like home
It feels like home
It feels like home
It feels like home, feels like home
It's where I learned to drive back when I was thirteen
My dad gave me the wheel, then said, "Give it back to me"
Summer days down at Walnut Grove Lake
We were thinking we were cool like 96 in the shade
Telling secrets in the southern moonlight
The way my mom said it's all right
To roam
But this is home

No one that I gotta be
It all comes down to the simple things
It feels like home and family
My feet in the red clay
My heart runs like the Mississippi
All the way back from the big city
And when the sun goes down at the end of the day
Nowhere else can make me feel this way

It feels like home
It feels like home
It feels like home
