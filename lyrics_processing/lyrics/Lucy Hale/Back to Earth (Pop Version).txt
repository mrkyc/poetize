I found my voice now
Here I am
See it all from where I stand
See the stars ahead of me
Fire burning beautifully
Reaching up and reaching out
You held my hand
And together we run
Woah oh

You give me sun
Air in my lungs
Standing on my own
Finally I'm home

Won't let the gravity fall
And bring me (Woah oh oh)
Bring me back to Earth
(Woah oh oh)
Bring me, bring me, bring me
(Woah oh oh)
Won't let the gravity fall
And bring me (woah oh oh)
Bring me back to Earth
Bring me, bring me
Bring me back to Earth
You might also like

You give me sun
Air in my lungs
Standing on my own
Finally I'm home

Won't let the gravity fall
And bring me (Woah oh oh)
Bring me back to Earth
(Woah oh oh)
Bring me, bring me, bring me
(Woah oh oh)
Won't let the gravity fall
And bring me (woah oh oh)
Bring me back to Earth
Bring me, bring me
Bring me back to Earth
Pre-Chorus
You give me sun (sun)
Air in my lungs (lungs)
Standing on my own (my own)
Finally I'm home
This is the story of a dog, you know
My little homeboy, but we call him Trouble
From riches to rags, good to bad
Another dreamer, another stray
Strays can't find their way
From a pampered pet to a real D-O-G
Mrs. V., this is me
Snoop Dog, this is me
Dog park, dog park
With my friends, getting it in
On the double, let me hear everybody say
Go, Trouble! Go, Trouble!
You're no cold pizza crust
Dog pound, release the pups
Let us free, let us be
Hey, squirrels, come and dance with me
Diamonds on my collar
It makes me want to holler
It's not what you have but who you have
Zoe sing

Won't let the gravity fall
And bring me (Woah oh oh)
Bring me back to Earth
(Woah oh oh)
Bring me, bring me, bring me
(Woah oh oh)
Won't let the gravity fall
And bring me (woah oh oh)
Bring me back to Earth
Bring me, bring me
