Plug in the mic, open the curtain
Turn on the lights, I'm through rehearsing
The feeling ignites, I'm in control
The crowd's in the palm of my hands all my fans stand
What is the truth? What's an illusion?
You're searching for proof, but are you certain?
Whatever you see, is what you get
If words paint a picture then I betcha I can getcha yet

I'll make you believe in me
I can be what you want me to be
Tonight is the night
Where I make you see
That I can be anything, anything, anything
I'll make you believe in me
I can be what you want me to be
Tonight is the night (Night)
Where I make you see (See)
That I can be anything, anything, anything

I got nothing to lose, I've been exposed
I'm paying my dues, playing the role
I'm breaking the rules, flowing the flow
I got the whole world nodding yes like some bobble heads
You might also likeI'll break the sweat, if you wanna
Confess all your sins, you know you got 'em
The room's in a spin, the fever's pitched
I swear there's no doubt I'm legit, I'm no counterfeit

I'll make you believe in me
I can be what you want me to be
Tonight is the night (Night)
Where I make you see (See)
That I can be anything, anything, anything
I'll make you believe in me
I can be what you want me to be
Tonight is the night (Night)
Where I make you see (See)
That I can be anything, anything, anything you want from me

I'm not shy, boy, I can be what you want
Your bright shiny toy, you just have to respond
The clock never stops, but baby it's time
There's no doubt in my mind

I'll make you believe in me
I can be what you want me to be
Tonight is the night
Where I make you see
That I can be anything, anything, anything
I'll make you believe in me
I can be what you want me to be
Tonight is the night (Night)
Where I make you see (See)
That I can be anything, anything, anything
I'll make you believe in me
I can be what you want me to be
Tonight is the night (Night)
Where I make you see (See)
That I can be anything, anything, anything
I'll make you believe in me
I can be what you want me to be
Tonight is the night (Night)
Where I make you see (See)
