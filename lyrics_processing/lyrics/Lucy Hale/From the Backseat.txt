We were burning in a '94 Corolla
Three hours deep into South Dakota
I was working on a lukewarm Coca-Cola
In the dog days of July
My dad was a Superman stick-shift driver
Stay-at-home Lois Lane beside him
Kissing to the rhythm of the billboard signs
As they went blurring by
Even when he would stop to pull over
He never took his hand off of her shoulder

You can see for miles
You can reach the dials
Sit back and smile
From the front seat
You can chase the sun
You can feel the hum
Of the axles underneath your feet
When you're sitting shotgun
You're sitting pretty and free
But you learn to love from the backseat

So blink one day and I'm rolling along
With a part-time job and blue pompoms
Like everyday's a knock off Mellencamp song
With his hand right on my knee
We made the age old prom night promise
Put the corsage right where I wanted
We found a road with nobody on it
And we didn't stop to think
And I didn't care when he killed the motor
Shut off the lights and we climbed over
You might also like
You can see for miles
You can reach the dials
Sit back and smile
From the front seat
You can chase the sun
You can feel the hum
Of the axles underneath your feet
When you're sitting shotgun
You're sitting pretty and free
But you learn to love from the backseat

Up here I see it clear thru the rearview
It's good to take the backseat when you get to

You can see for miles
You can reach the dials
Sit back and smile
From the front seat
You can chase the sun
You can feel the hum
Of the axles underneath your feet
When you're sitting shotgun
You're sitting pretty and free
But you learn to love
You can see for miles
You can reach the dials
Sit back and smile
From the front seat
You can chase the sun
You can feel the hum
Of the axles underneath your feet
When you're sitting shotgun
You're sitting pretty and free
But you learn to love from the backseat
We were burning in a '94 Corolla
