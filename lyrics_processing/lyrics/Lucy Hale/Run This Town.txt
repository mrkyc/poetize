Hold on cause I'm letting go
I'm gonna lasso your heart like a rodeo
I'm gonna give you some till you want some more
Cause all I see is an open door
And I see where it's leading me
All of this energy been bottled up way too long
It's powerful, powerful
You see what I'm getting at
I'm ready for all of that
If I'm not a star, you're blind

I've got rings on my fingers
And glitter in my hair
I bought a one-way ticket
And I just got here
I'm gonna run this town
Run this town
I'm gonna run this town
Run this town

I've got high heel stilettos
And I'm kicking in doors
And kissing your ass ain't what my lipstick's for
I'm gonna run this town
Run this town
I'm gonna run this town
Run this town tonight
You might also like
I'm climbing high but there ain't no net
You'd like to see me jump, I bet
Well everyday's just like Russian Roulette
I'm gonna play, play, play with no regrets
Cause I'm tired of second best
Tired of sitting bitch
Tired of hypocrites
Twisted like licorice
I'm crushing them in my fist
Hushing their ignorance
You had your chance, now's mine

I've got rings on my fingers
And glitter in my hair
I bought a one-way ticket
And I just got here
I'm gonna run this town
Run this town
I'm gonna run this town
Run this town

I've got high heel stilettos
And I'm kicking in doors
And kissing your ass ain't what my lipstick's for
I'm gonna run this town
Run this town
I'm gonna run this town
Run this town
Tonight nothing's standing in my way
There's no obstacles anymore
In a minute I'll be on my way
To the moment I've been waiting for

I've got rings on my fingers
And glitter in my hair
Bought a one-way ticket
And I just got here
I'm gonna run this town
Run this town
I'm gonna run this town tonight
I've got rings on my fingers
And glitter in my hair
I bought a one-way ticket
And I just got here
I'm gonna run this town
Run this town
I'm gonna run this town
Run this town

I've got high heel stilettos
And I'm kicking in doors
And kissing your ass ain't what my lipstick's for
I'm gonna run this town
Run this town
I'm gonna run this town
Run this town
I'm gonna run, I'm gonna run, gonna run
Run this town
I'm gonna run, I'm gonna run, gonna run
Run this town tonight
Run this town, run this town tonight
I'm gonna run this town, run this town tonight
