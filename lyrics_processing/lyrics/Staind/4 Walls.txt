The thoughts from my mind
Command my lips, say, "I hate you"
The thoughts from my mind
Command my hands to cut your silken flesh
The thoughts from my mind
Command my feet to stomp your head
The thoughts from my mind have one question
When will this ever end?

Not much to the life I live
Same four walls
I have nothing left to give
Please take it all away
Same four walls

The thoughts from my mind
Feel the pain as rats claw at my flesh
The thoughts from my mind
Feels the joy as the needle hits my vein
The thoughts from my mind
Smell the stench as shit runs down my leg
The thoughts from my mind ask for sanity
Now for this I beg

Not much to this life I live
Same four walls
I have nothing left to give
Please take it all away
Same four walls
Same four walls

My mind is like today, damp dark dreary
As the rain falls outside beating
Though it hits the ground
I can feel it slipping away
Dying without decay
Dying like my soul
From the inside out
I can only pray
It won't be long
It won't be long now
It can't be long
It can't be long now, help me
(Where do I go from here?)

The thoughts from my mind
Command my lips, say, "I hate you"
The thoughts from my mind
Command my hands to cut your silken flesh
The thoughts from my mind
Command my feet to stomp your head
The thoughts from my mind have one question
When will I be dead?
This is the life I have to live
Same four walls
I have nothing left to give
Please take it all away
This is the life I have to live
Same four walls
I have nothing left to give
Please take it all away
Same four walls
Same four walls
Same four walls
Same four walls
