I know, that it never goes away
All I feel, everything I'm not today
So I try and I try to make everything right
I don't feel like I'm doing it, it affects me

You wouldn't listen even if I told you
Who the fuck am I to say?
You're too busy with the lies they sold you
Another cure to fix your day
Open wide for all the shit they feed you
While the TV defecates
And blindly walk wherever they will lead you
While the edges slowly fray

I know, that everything can change
What I need, is to open up again
So never again will I look back in vain
'Cause today's not the past, I don't need to relive it

You wouldn't listen even if I told you
Who the fuck am I to say?
You're too busy with the lies they sold you
Another cure to fix your day
Open wide for all the shit they feed you
While your TV defecates
And blindly walk wherever they will lead you
While the edges slowly fray

Are you satisfied?
I've given all I can
And are you pacified
Or do you want more from me?

You wouldn't listen even if I told you
Who the fuck am I to say?
You're too busy with the lies they sold you
Another cure to fix your day
Open wide for all the shit they feed you
While the TV defecates
And blindly walk wherever they will lead you
While the edges slowly fray

I've learned, that this life's not just a game
Just a line between the pleasures and the pain

You wouldn't listen even if I told you
Who the fuck am I to say?
And you're too busy with the lies they sold you
Another cure to fix your day
Open wide for all the shit they feed you
While the TV defecates
And blindly walk wherever they will lead you
