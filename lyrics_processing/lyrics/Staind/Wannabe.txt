I'm sellin' records, what is it that you do?
Sittin' in your momma's basement with a Shih Tzu
Peanut butter on your dick, right hand goin' click
With your left hand, givin' you a rimjob
So now you wanna talk about me?
Whose name is on the marquee?
You hate everything that you can't be
I've heard enough, man, fuck

You're just a solo, turncoat rockstar
Pussy, poser, popstar

Because you're nothin' but a wannabe
It's so easy when you're faceless
Why don't you focus on your misery
Instead of focusing on me?

So number two, that's right, what is it you're rollin'
Now that your momma's Ford Focus got stolen?
But it don't matter, cause you got nowhere ta go
So back to the hatin', frantic masturbatin'

Nothing but a wannabe (instead of focusing on me)
