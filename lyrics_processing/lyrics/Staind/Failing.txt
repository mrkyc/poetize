Yeah, like the threat of the darkest clouds rollin' in on a sunny day
Yeah, like a field that has no rain
Yeah, like a dog that wanders aimless, with no mane
Yeah, like a cut without the pain

Yeah, you couldn't feel this?
You couldn't take the pain?
Yeah, you couldn't live this?

And I'm just trying to get through to you
And I am failing
Lie like I'm not even here
My heart is breaking
Trying to see through your stare
It looks right through me
I smile and pretend I'm not there
To keep from going crazy

Yeah, like the day that your guardian angel decided to fly away
Yeah, like a bruise that doesn't fade
Yeah, like a memory that tortures your soul until your dying day
Yeah, like the life you couldn't save
