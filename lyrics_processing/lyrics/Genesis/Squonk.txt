Like father, like son
Not flesh, nor fish, nor bone
A red rag hangs from an open mouth
Alive at both ends
But a little dead in the middle
A-tumbling and a-bumbling he will go
All the King's horses and all the King's men
Could never put a smile on that face

He's a sly one, he's a shy one
Wouldn't you be too?
Scared to be left out on his own
He hasn't a, hasn't a friend to play with
The ugly duckling
The pressure on
The bubble will burst before our eyes
And all the while in perfect time
His tears are falling on the ground
But if you don't stand up
You don't stand a chance
You don't stand a chance

Go a little faster, now
You might get there in time
Mirror, mirror on the wall
His heart was broken long before
He ever came to you
Stop your tears from falling
The trail they leave is very clear
For all to see at night
All to see at night
They come at night
You might also like
In season, out of season
Oh, what's the difference
When you don't know the reason?
In one hand bread
The other a stone
The hunter enters the forest
All are not huntsmen
Who blow the huntsman's horn
And by the look of this one
You've not got much to fear

Here I am
I'm very fierce and frightening
Come to match my skill to yours
Now listen here, listen to me
Don't you run away now
I am a friend
I'd really like to play with you
Making noises my little furry friend would make
I'll trick him, then I'll kick him into my sack
You better watch out
You better watch out

I've got you, I've got you
You'll never get away
Walking home that night
The sack across my back
The sound of sobbing on my shoulder
When suddenly, it stopped
I opened up the sack, all that I had
A pool of bubbles and tears
Just a pool of tears
Just a pool of tears
All in all, you are a very dying race
Placing trust upon a cruel world
You never had the things
You thought you should've had
And you'll not get them now
And all the while in perfect time
