"Get 'em out by Friday
You don't get paid
Till the last one's well on his way
Get 'em out by Friday
It's important that we keep to schedule
There must be no delay"

"I represent a firm of gentlemen
Who recently purchased this house
And all the others in the road
In the interest of humanity
We've found a better place
For you to go-go-go"

"Oh no, this I can't believe
Oh Mary, they're asking us to leave"

"Get 'em out by Friday
I've told you before
It's good money gone if we let them stay
And if it isn't easy
You can squeeze a little grease
And our troubles will soon run away"

"After all this time, they ask us to leave
And I told them we could pay double the rent
I don't know why it seemed so funny
Seeing as how they'd take more money
The Winkler called again
He came here this morning
With four hundred pounds
And a photograph of the place he has found
A block of flats with central heating
I think we're going to find it hard"

"Now we've got them
I've always said that
Cash, cash, cash can do anything well
Work can be rewarding
When a flash of intuition is a gift
That helps you excel-sell-sell"

"Here we are in Harlow New Town
Did you recognize your block
Across the square, over there?
Sadly, since last time we spoke
We've found we've had
To raise the rent again, just a bit"
"Oh no, this I can't believe
Oh Mary, and we agreed to leave"


This is an announcement from Genetic Control
"It is my sad duty to inform you
Of a four-foot restriction on humanoid height"

"I hear the directors of Genetic Control
Have been buying all the properties
That have recently been sold
Taking risks, oh, so bold
It's said now that people will be shorter in height
They can fit twice as many in the same building site
They say it's alright
Beginning with the tenants of the town of Harlow
In the interest of humanity, they've been told they must go
Told they must go-go-go-go"

"I think I've fixed a new deal
A dozen properties
We'll buy at five and sell at thirty-four
Some are still inhabited
It's time to send the Winkler to see them
He'll have to work some more"
"With land in your hand you'll be happy on Earth
