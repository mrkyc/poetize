I see faces and traces of home
Back in New York City, huh

So you think I'm a tough kid?
Is that what you heard?
Yeah, well, I like to see some action
And it gets into my blood
They call me the trail blazer
Rael, electric razor
I'm the pitcher in a chain gang
We don't believe in pain
'Cause we're only as strong
Yes, we're only as strong
As the weakest link
In the chain
Let me out of Pontiac
When I was just seventeen
I had to get it out of me
If you know what I mean, what I mean

Ahhh! You say I must be crazy
'Cause I don't care who I hit, who I hit
But I know it's me that's hitting out
And I'm, I'm not full of shit
I don't care who I hurt
I don't care who I do wrong
This is your mess I'm stuck in
I really don't belong
When I take out my bottle
Filled up high with gasoline
You can tell by the night fires
Where Rael has been, has been
You might also like
As I cuddled the porcupine
He said I had none to blame but me
Held my heart deep in hair
Time to shave, shave it off, it off

No time for romantic escape (No time)
When your fluffy heart is ready for rape (No time, no!)
No time for romantic escape (No time)
When your fluffy heart is ready for rape (No time, no!)
No time for romantic escape (No time)
When your fluffy heart is ready for rape (No time, no!)

Off we go
Off we go
Off we go
Off we go

You're sitting in your comfort
You don't believe I'm real
You cannot buy protection
From the way that I feel
Your progressive hypocrites
Hand out their trash
But it was mine in the first place
So I'll burn it to ash
And I've tasted all the strongest meats
And laid them down in coloured sheets
Laid them down
In coloured sheets
Who needs illusion
Of love and affection
When you're out walking in the streets
With your mainline connection, connection?
As I cuddled the porcupine
He said I had none to blame but me
Held my heart deep in hair
Time to shave, shave it off, it off

No time for romantic escape (No time)
When your fluffy heart is ready for rape (No time, no!)
No time for romantic escape (No time)
When your fluffy heart is ready for rape (No time, no!)
No time for romantic escape (No time)
When your fluffy heart is ready for rape (No time)
