I'm tired, broken, innocence stolen
And I know I'm a different man
See life hits and life hurts
Think I've seen some of life's worsts
But You've been here so You understand
See I fell and I broke something
But I couldn't tell 'cause I kept running
Away from Your love and grace
So my trips and my pains
My failures, they only made me
Desperate to seek Your face

Yeah, the devil hoped this injury would make me stop and take defeat
But I know Jesus walks with me
So I'll just keep on walking with my limp, limp, limp, limp
Keep on walking with my limp, limp, limp, limp
Yeah, keep on walking with limp, limp, limp, limp
Yeah, just keep on walking with my limp, limp, limp, limp
(Break it down)

See, you don't have to prove your salvation to God
'Cause at the end of the day He already knows Your heart
And you don't have to prove it to nobody else
But you do have to prove it to yourself
See the Bible says confirm your calling and election
The Bible says make your salvation sure
'Cause if you know it, you will show it
If you know it, you will show it

That's why we gotta keep on doing better
We gotta keep on doing better
Yeah, we gotta keep on doing better
Yeah, we gotta keep on doing better
See Lord, we really gotta keep on doing better
(Everyday, wake up you gotta) Keep on doing better
(Hey, Lord) keep on doing better
(Hey, see Lord gotta keep me) Keep on doing better
So tomorrow just do better, better, better
(Come on) Tomorrow just do better, better, better
And keep on moving closer, closer, closer
Lord, you know that all is forgiven because He'll help you to do

Keep on doing better
Keep on doing better
(Come on, let me hear ya'll sing it)
(Oh Lord, we really) Keep on doing better (yeah)
