Who am I to have Your ear whenever I call Your name
And who am I to be forgiven? Certain things just don't change
And I haven't done a thing to deserve Your favor, Your grace
After all the hurt I've cause you, Lord, I must say you got me wondering
(Chorus)
Why, oh, why?
Why, oh, why?
Why, oh, why?
Why, oh, why?

Said You would save me, then I looked at You
And I laughed in Your face
Said You would heal me and than I turned away
And treated You like You were fake (fake)
In spite of me not being worthy, You still giving new mercy's
Day after day and chance after chance
You never throw me away so you got me wondering

Why, oh, why?
It's a question in my mind
Why, oh, why? (Why, Lord?)
Why is it me, Jesus, please tell me?
Why, oh, why?
(Singing) Why, oh, why?

I know the Word and the Word is love
And it's sent from up above, something I'm not worthy of
I now the who and the who is You
The Alpha and Omega, your Daddy and your Savior
I now the when and it's over and over again
You prove to be my friend from the morning 'til PM
And I don't have a spectacular bone in my body
But You love anyway, so Father I just want to say

Thank You
Thank You
Thank You
Thank You
Thank You
I just wanna say
Thank You
Thank You
I'd be remiss if I didn't say thank You (thank You)
(Thank You) For keeping me
(Thank You) For loving me
(Thank You) For saving me
(Thank You) Wrapping Your arms
All the way around me (thank You)
They keep me so safe (thank You)
Though I didn't (gotta say thank You)
Deserve it (thank You)
You saw fit to let me see (thank You)
Another day (thank You)
So I can say (thank You) thank You
Thank You (thank You)
Thank You, Lord (thank You)
Thank You (thank You)
Thank You (thank You, Lord)
Thank You
I gotta thank You, Jesus
