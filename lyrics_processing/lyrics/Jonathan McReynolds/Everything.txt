Life music
Here we go
Are you ready?
Life music
Nobody said this would be easy
So I've written this
Life music
And I mean every word
Life music
Comes from out of the heart
Life music
Full of issues
Life music

You've been so good to me, I must admit
When I think of Your goodness it gets hard to sit
In times like these some people just don't get
How I manage to smile, how the fire stays lit
And my mood doesn't go up and down with the world
And my life isn't based on money or girls
Economy's down, but I'm still livin' blessed
They don't understand how, so I try to tell them that
You might also like
It's 'cause You are my everything (You are)
You are my everything

A song has never failed me so if You would allow this
I wanna tell You, Father, 'bout Your love
There's nothing like it
Heart and soul, You somehow make me whole
I just wanna know how to get up in the flow
I'll take the risk of sounding a little cliche
But You're the peace in my night, the Joy in my day
You're the air that I breathe, the Song that I sing
You're all that I need, Jesus, basically, You are

You are my everything
(You are) You are my ever...

You're my love (I found it in You)
My peace (I found it in You)
My joy (I found it in You)
Everything I need (I found it in You)
You always find a way (I found it in You)
To put a smile on my face (I found it in You)
I couldn't make it without You
I'd be a fool to doubt You
And even though You already knew
You are
You are my everything
(Don't need no one else 'cause You are)
You are my everything
I just want to take the time to say that
