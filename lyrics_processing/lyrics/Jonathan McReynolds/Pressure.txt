I, I can't even turn on my phone
Without being reminded of the lie
That I am alone and broken, unsuccessful
And I, I can't always talk to my friends
'Cause they've got expectations
That I may or may not be living up to

I really need to rid myself
Of the pressure, pressure, pressure
To be someone else that the world has made
Jesus, take from me
All the pressure, pressure, pressure
To be someone that You did not create

Help me be me
And only see You
Let me decrease
And glorify You
Help me, God, help me

I, I thought my intentions were good
Just act like a Christian should
And hope that someone watching would approve and be inspired
But if You're not feeling my show
Then how far could I go
Before all of my accomplishments go down in fire
You might also like
Just 'cause all
Of the pressure, pressure, pressure
To be someone else that the Church has made
Jesus, take from me
All the pressure, pressure, pressure
To be someone that You did not create

Help me be me
And only see You
Let me decrease
And glorify You
Help me be me
And only see You
Let me decrease
And glorify You
Help me be me
And only see You
Let me decrease
And glorify You
Help me (be me) be me
(Just like you made me)
Only (only) see You
(And nobody else, God)
Let me (O Lord) decrease
And glorify You
I just wanna live
I just wanna live for You
Nobody else, but You
I just wanna live
I just wanna live for You
Nobody else, but You
I just wanna live
I just wanna live for You
Nobody else, but You
(I just wanna live)
I just wanna live
I just wanna live for You
Nobody else, but You
(I just wanna live)
I just wanna live
(I just wanna live)
I just wanna live for You (Jesus)
Nobody else, but You (Nobody else, but You, Lord)
I just wanna live
(No one else's)
I just wanna live for You
(Opinion matters)
Nobody else, but You
(I just wanna live)
Take away all the pressure, pressure, pressure
