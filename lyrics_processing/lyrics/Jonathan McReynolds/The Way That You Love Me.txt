I've seen rain, it's been dark
I've felt pain, got these scars
Sometimes it's all I can remember
Where's the sun? Give me light
Got to be more to this life
I can't lie, it's been colder than December

But when it comes to survival
There's only one friend that I know
That I can truly depend on, I know

The way that You love me
The way that You love me
Is everything I need, don't ever let me go
The way that You told me
That You would always be
Everything I need, don't ever let me go

Don't ever let me go (Don't ever, don't ever)
Don't ever let me go (Don't ever, don't ever)
The way that You love me
Don't ever let me go (Don't ever)
You might also like
Bound to break, lose my mind
Wanna scream, wanna cry
Help me, Father
Said I need You now more than ever, yeah
'Cause I'm contemplating turning back
I feel like saying it's a wrap
But I can't handle all of that
So I surrender, Lord

'Cause when it comes to survival
You're the one friend that I know
That I can truly depend on, I know, I know

And the way that You love me
The way that You love me
Is everything I need, don't ever let me go
The way that You told me
That You would always be
Everything I need, don't ever let me go

Don't ever let me go (Don't ever, don't ever)
Don't ever let me go (Don't ever, don't ever)
The way that You love me
Don't ever let me go (Don't ever)
See, if you've been through what I've been through
You know exactly what God can do
See, that's the reason I sing this tune
Don't ever let me go
See, if you've been through what I've been through
You know exactly what God can do
See, that's the reason I sing this tune
Don't ever let me go

The way that You love me
The way that You love me
Is everything I need, don't ever let me go
The way that You told me
That You would always be
Everything I need, don't ever let me go
No, no, no

Don't ever let me go (Don't ever, don't ever)
Don't ever let me go (Don't ever, don't ever)
The way that You love me
Don't ever let me go (Don't ever)
No, no
Don't ever let me go
Never let me go
I want You forever
I need You forever
Stay with me forever (Don't ever, don't ever, don't ever)
Truth is (Ooh, I really need You)
Every hour (So don't ever)
(Don't ever, don't ever, don't ever)
The way that You love me
