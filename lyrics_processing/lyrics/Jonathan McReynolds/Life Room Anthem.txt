We gon' have some fun tonight

We've been turning living rooms into life rooms
We've been giving God room with these life tunes
We just get too busy living than watching others live
That we forget the One who gave us life
So we've been turning living rooms into life rooms
We've been turning living rooms into life rooms
We've been giving God room with these life tunes
We just get too busy living than watching others live
That we forget the One who gave us life
So we've been turning living rooms into life rooms


See, we've been turning living rooms into life rooms
We've been turning living rooms into life rooms
We've been giving God room with these life tunes
We just get too busy living than watching others live
That we forget the One who gave us life
So we've been turning living rooms into life rooms

My self worth ain't determined by my net worth
'Cause God gave me a purpose on this earth
And if I don't sell a lot of records, I ain't stressin'
I'd much rather go platinum in Heaven
See life is full of distractions
And we've become addicted to their temporary satisfaction
But yo, this ain't the end
There's another life after
So I work like a slave but I serve the right Master
Faster, time's ticking everyday
I'm trying to right my wrongs and do what the pastor say
Man, I was reborn; Christ wiped my past away
When you goin' finally make a change, when you pass away?
Yo, it all starts off by knowing one thing
We were only born to bring glory to our King
I was like an all-star on the losing team
God signed me as a free agent and now I'm winning rings

We've been turning living rooms into life rooms
We've been giving God room with these life tunes
We just get too busy living than watching others live
That we forget the One who gave us life
