You can't catch a bird while it's flying in the air
No, you gotta wait 'til it comes to the ground
And you can't trap a saint while they're in full flight
No, the devil's gotta wait 'til we come down

So, I'll stay high
I ain't coming down for no reason, I'll be reading my Word
I ain't coming down for no satan, I'll be praying to my Lord
I ain't coming down for no sinning, while I'm living for my God
I ain't coming down for nobody, no I'll just stay high

High, high, high
So watch me fly
Fly, fly, fly

See, we've all got targets on our backs
'Cause all Heaven and Hell knows our worth
So, I'm standing guard 'cause life's coming hard
Soon as we walk out the church

So, I'll stay high
I ain't coming down for no reason, I'll be reading my Word
I ain't coming down for no satan, I'll be praying to my Lord
I ain't coming down for no sinning, while I'm living for my God
I ain't coming down for nobody, no I'll just stay high
You might also like
High, high, high
So watch me fly
Fly, fly, fly

No more devil
You won't catch me now
You can't trap me now
You won't keep me down

'Cause I stay high, high, high, high
So watch me fly, fly, fly, fly

Even when the service is over (just stay high)
And when your friends stay rolling in the dirt, no (just stay high)
When your family make you wanna curse, no (just stay high)
Someday, we all gotta learn to (just stay high)
Know you've got a purpose (just stay high)
God has a plan so (just stay high)
Mount up on wings like an eagle and (stay high)
