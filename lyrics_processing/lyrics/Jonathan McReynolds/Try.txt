I don't wanna live the crazy life
And I don't wanna pick a crazy wife
And I don't wanna be that crazy guy
Who lost what I had inside, mmh
And I don't want the sinners destiny
And I don't wanna miss what's best for me
So I'm gonna take what's left of me
Swallow pride, at least I...

I gotta make a sincere effort to be
All that You called me to be, God
I just don't wanna stay here, living beneath
I owe it to me to at least try

So I'm gonna try, try, try, try, try
See I'm gonna try
Try, try, try, try
A little harder this time, this time, this time
I'm gonna try, try, try, try, try

See Lord, I wanna know Your plan for me
And I gotta follow faithfully, yeah
So teach me to abandon all that
Makes me comfortable, so basically...

I gotta make a sincere effort to be
All that You called me to be (All that You called me to be)
I just don't wanna stay here, living beneath
I owe it to me to at least try (I owe it to me to at least try)

So I'm gonna try, try, try, try, try
See I'm gonna try, try, try, try, try
A little harder this time, this time, this time
I'm gonna try, try, try, try, try

Tell me what I need to do
So I can be close to You (Close to You)
I only wanna make You smile
This time's different
Tell Heaven to watch me

While I try, try, try, try, try
See I'm gonna try, try, try, try, try
A little harder this time, this time, this time
I'm gonna try, try, try, try, try
See I'm gonna try
Yeah sea I'm gonna try, try, try, try, try
I've gotta make a sincere effort to be
All that You want me to be, God
I just don't wanna stay here living beneath
I owe it to me to at least try
I owe it to me to at least try
I owe it to me to at least try

Mmh, 'cause if it's God that I'm after
Just can't serve two masters
Before something happens, I gotta turn it all around
'Cause I just can't have my cake and eat it too
'Cause it's real easy to stay on the fence and still do You
And it'd be cool if we can love the Lord and still go do our thing
But see it doesn't work like this
We gotta be white or black

I'm gonna try, try, try, try, try
See I gotta try, try, try, try, try
A little harder this time, this time, this time
