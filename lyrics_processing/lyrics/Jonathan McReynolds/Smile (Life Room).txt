Life doesn't always give you much reason to smile
And though life sometimes has an attitude, I won't change mine
Mmm, in all the love You've given
Mmm, in all the ways You made, hey
The fact that I'm still living
How dare I wear a frown on my face

I can't help but smile when I realize what You've done for me
All those battles You've won for me
And I know someday soon You'll come for me
I can't help but sing 'cause You already gave me the victory
And no pain and no hurt and no misery could take away my smile

Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah, yeah
You might also like
Funny how people always have something to say
But I find peace in knowing that You love me anyway
No matter how I'm feeling, ooh
You will never change
It ain't always easy-living
But now that I have a choice today

I can't help but smile 'cause I realize what You've done for me
All those battles You've won for me
And that someday soon You'll come for me
I can't help but sing 'cause You already gave me the victory
And no pain and no hurt and no misery could take away my smile

Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah

If the Lord made a way for you to see another day
Just smile
Regardless of what they and the others have to say
Just smile (just smile)
Take the good and be grateful and all the bad will be handled
And smile
It will all be okay, take the worry off your face
You look better anyway, give it to God
And just smile
Someday soon You'll come for me
I can't help but sing 'cause You already gave me the victory
And no pain and no hurt and no misery could take away my smile
See, I can't help but smile 'cause I realize what You've done for me
All those battles You've won for me
Someday soon You'll come for me
See, I can't help but sing 'cause You already gave me the victory
And no pain and no hurt and no misery could take away my smile

Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah, yeah

We've been turning living rooms into life rooms
We've been giving God room with these life tunes
We just get too busy livin' and watchin' others live
That we forget the One who gave us life
So we've been turning living rooms into life rooms
Hey, you can turn your living room into a life room
Feel free to give God room with these life tunes
Please, don't get too busy livin' and watchin' others live
That you forget the One who gave us life
You can turn your living room into a life room
