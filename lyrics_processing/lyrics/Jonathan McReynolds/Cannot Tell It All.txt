God's been so good to me
I cannot, I cannot tell it all
He's opened doors for me
I cannot, I cannot tell it all
He's made a way for me
I cannot, I cannot tell it all
He supplies my every need
I cannot, I cannot tell it all

Loose my shackles, set me free
You don't know like I know
What He's done for me
I cannot tell it all
I cannot tell it all

God's been so good to me
I cannot, I cannot tell it all
He's opened so many, many, many doors for me
I cannot, I cannot tell it all
He's made a way
Out of no way
No, I cannot, I cannot tell it all
He supplies my every need
I cannot, I cannot tell it all
You might also like
Loose my shackles, set me free
You don't know like I know
What He's done for me
I cannot tell it all
I cannot tell it all
