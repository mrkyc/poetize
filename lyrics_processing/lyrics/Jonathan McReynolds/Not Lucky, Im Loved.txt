Maybe I succeeded a little
I jumped up from the floor to the middle
You think I want the credit, I don't
'Cause the glory ain't made for me
But I know who sits on the throne
Who makes the stage and writes the songs
And I know I couldn't do this on my own
And as much as I complain, I've seen more sunshine than rain

And I could thank my lucky stars
But that's not where my blessings are
No, they come from the Father's heart
Not the sky, not chance
The truth is...

I'm not lucky, I'm loved
I'm not lucky, I'm loved
I'm not lucky, I'm loved
I'm not lucky, I'm loved

Today I'm in a happy place
And I know it didn't happen by mistake
I love how He wrote my life
And I love how He sees my heart
So I fall to me knees and I say that I'm grateful when every morning starts
So I don't thank my lucky stars
'Cause that's not where my blessings are
No, they come from the Father's heart
Not the sky, not chance
The truth is...

I'm not lucky, I'm loved
Yeah, I'm not lucky, I'm loved
I'm not lucky, I'm loved
I'm not lucky, I'm loved

From the very beginning, this life that I'm living
Was part of Your plan all along

So I don't thank my lucky stars
'Cause that's not where my blessings are
No, they come from the Father's heart
Not the sky, not chance
But truth is...

I'm not lucky, I'm loved
I'm not lucky, I'm loved
I'm not lucky, I'm loved
I'm not lucky, I'm loved
See, I'm not lucky, I'm loved
Yeah, I'm not lucky, I'm loved
I'm not lucky, I'm loved
I'm not lucky, I'm loved, yeah

I'm not lucky, I'm loved
I'm not lucky, I'm loved
I'm not lucky, I'm loved
I'm not lucky, I'm loved

'Cause that's not where my blessings are
No, they come from the Father's heart
Not the sky, not chance
