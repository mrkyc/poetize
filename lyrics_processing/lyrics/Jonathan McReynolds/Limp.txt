Hey now

I'm tired, broken, innocence stolen
And I know I'm a different man
See life hits and life hurts
Think I've seen some of life's worst
But You've been here so You understand
See I fell and I broke something
But I couldn't tell 'cause I kept running
Away from Your love and grace
So my trips and my pains, my failures
They only make me desperate to seek Your face
Yeah, the devil hoped this injury would make me stop and take defeat
But I know Jesus walks with me

So I'll just keep on walking with my limp, limp, limp, limp
Just keep on walking with my limp, limp, limp, limp
Just keep on walking with limp, limp, limp, limp
Just keep on walking with my limp, limp, limp, limp

I'm imperfect, so I slipped up
And I had my heart ripped up
But You're the lifter of my head (of my head)
So, please come and please heal
How I think and how I feel
And I'll live by what You said
And You said
You might also like[Pre-Chorus[
Heavy laden come to me
The sick, the flawed, the lame, the weak
And I'll be everything you need

So I'll just keep on walking with my limp, limp, limp, limp
Just keep on walking with my limp, limp, limp, limp
Just keep on walking with limp, limp, limp, limp
Just keep on walking with my limp, limp, limp, limp

Limps are every weakness
Limps are every flaw
That keeps us from having
An otherwise perfect walk
And we were born handicapped
But God gives us strength back
And all that you lack
If you just keep on walking with your limp

I'll pursue You, my victory
'Cause when they beat You
You look just like me
You were struggling with Your passion and Your love
It kept You walking with Your limp
Calvary walking with Your limp
No matter what they said, You kept walking with Your limp
Yeah, that's my Savior with His limp
Just so one day
I could walk with my limp, limp, limp, limp
And I could still be loved even with my limp, limp, limp, limp
And I could still be used even with my limp, limp, limp, limp
And I could still be saved even with my limp
