Now listen
This song goes out to everybody
Who is about 4 or 5 seconds from wilin
We just want to tell you to relax, God's got this

All things are working for my good
All things are working for me
It is well, it is well
With my soul (With my soul)
All things are working for my good
All things are working for me
It is well, it is well
With my soul

You keep me steady
When my world is shaken, shaken
And my heart is heavy
And I know You're making all things well

It is well
It is well
Oh, You make all things well
It is well
It is well
Oh, You make all things

All things are working for my good
All things are working for me
It is well, it is well
With my soul (With my soul)
All things are working for my good
All things are working me
Hallelujah, hallelujah in my soul

You keep me steady
(When my world) When my world is shaken, shaken
And my heart is heavy
(But I know) But I know You're making all things well

It is well
It is well
Oh, You make all things well
It is well

Oh, You make all things
Oh, oh, oh
It's working for me (working for me)
Oh, oh, oh

I won't worry (I won't worry) 'cause I know You're working for my good
Yes, you are, yes, you are
