I'm nowhere close to a perfect man
And it takes a supernatural love to even understand
That beyond the walls, behind the mask and confident smile
Was a broken man trying to grow up and make life worthwhile

And I know there were times that You probably shouldn't
But I thank You for always lovin' me
And I know anyone else they probably wouldn't
So I thank You for always lovin' me

Now, I know there were days I looked at myself
I felt like less of a person compared to everyone else
What about this flaw, too big, too small, can I exchange?
And trying to make-up for where I fell short, I let sense slip away

And when I look in the mirror and don't like what I see
Oh, I just thank You for always lovin' me
And I know I get bad, but You wait patiently
Oh, I just thank You for always lovin' me
Oh, I just thank You for always lovin' me
I want to thank You for always lovin' me
See, You just keep lovin' me (lovin' me)
You just keep lovin' me (lovin' me)
And You don't let go, You just keep lovin' me (lovin' me)
I just want to thank You for always lovin' me
You might also like
And though I know I don't have everything that it takes
You keep lovin' me (lovin' me)
And regardless of every mistake that I make, You keep lovin' me
And it probably don't matter what I do or say, You keep lovin' me
And even with the pimples on my face, you keep lovin' me

See, You just keep lovin' me (lovin' me)
Keep lovin' me (lovin' me)
Lovin' me (lovin' me)
Oh, I just want to thank You for always lovin' me
Thank You for always lovin' me
