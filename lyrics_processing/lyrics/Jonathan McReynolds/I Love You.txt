People don't understand
Why we lift our hands and sing praises
And people can't comprehend
That when we dance we're not crazy
See, maybe they don't realize that sitting high is the Father
And this is what we were created for
Nothing less or more but to worship You

And I just want to say that
Yours is the best love that I ever had
And I just want to say that
I think it's only fair that we give it back

I love You
I love You
Just as surely as I know my name
I know one thing that'll never change
I love You

No one else can compare
No one, nowhere to my Savior
I mean I gain new mercies everyday
And You still find room for more favor
I can't believe there ever was a time
That I tried to hide who You were to me
But those days are long over now
I'll show it proud for all to see
You might also like
I just want to say that
Yours is the best love that I ever had
I just want to say that
I think it's only fair that we give it back

I love You
I love You
Just as surely as I know my name
I know one thing that'll never change
I love You
I love You

All of You, all You do
All You say, All Your ways
Who You are
Lord, I really love You
See, here's my heart, I'll make room
As if we were the bride and the groom
I do, wanna take time just to give to You
Whats due, all of the glory and the honor

I love You
I love You
From the bottom of my heart I do
Just as surely as I know my name
I know one thing that'll never change
I love You
I love You (I love You, I love You)
I just wanna say that I love You
I love You
I love You
Just as surely as I know my name
(I know that You will always be my best friend)
I know one thing that'll never change
I love You
