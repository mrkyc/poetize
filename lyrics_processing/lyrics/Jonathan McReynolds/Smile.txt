Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Just smile
Just smile

Life doesn't always give you much reason to smile
And though life sometimes has an attitude, I won't change mine
And all the love You've given
And all the ways You've made
The fact that I'm still living
How dare I wear a frown on my face

I can't help but smile
'Cause I realize what You've done for me
All those battles You've won for me
And that someday soon You will come for me
I can't help but sing
'Cause You already gave me the victory
And no pain, and no hurt and no misery
Could take away my smile
Take away my smile (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

Funny how people always have something to say
But I find peace in knowing that You love me anyway
And no matter how I'm feeling
You will never change (no)
It ain't always easy living
But now that I have a choice today
You might also like
I can't help but smile
'Cause I realize what You've done for me
All those battles You've won for me
And that someday soon You will come for me
I can't help but sing
'Cause You already gave me the victory
And no pain, and no hurt and no misery
Can take away my smile
(Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Take away my smile

If the Lord's made a way for you to see another day
Just smile
Regardless of what they, what the others have to say
Just smile
Take the good and be grateful, know the bad will be handled
And smile
It will all be okay, take the worry off your face
'Cause you'll look better anyway, give it to God
And just smile

'Cause I realize what You've done for me
All the battles You've won for me
And that someday soon You will come for me (come for me)
I can't help but sing
'Cause you already gave me the victory
And no pain, and no hurt and no misery
Can take away my smile
(Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah)
The world didn't give it
And the world can't take it away
Yeah, the world doesn't get it
