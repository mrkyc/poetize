On my back, breathin' heavy, starin' at the light
Prayin' this ain't the end, but pretty sure it might be
On my back, got my heart beatin' out of my chest
I never thought, can't believe that I'd go out like this
(Go out like this, go out like this, go out like this, go out like this)
(Go out like this, go out like this, go out like this)

So these are the walls that have to hold this moment
I never expected to be here again
My vision is blurrin' as the light starts to fade
Please, pull me out from this

My ribs are breakin', I swear, I'm only 23
Crawlin', searchin' for a lifeline I just can't reach
Somebody, hear me; someone, open up the door
Get me up off of this floor and stop the shakin', the shakin'
The blood is boilin' in my veins, oh God, the pain, it's unrelentin'
I'm ready for the end if it means that all of this will end

So these are the walls that have to hold this moment
I never expected to be here again
My vision is blurrin' as the light starts to fade
Please, pull me out from this

Through the haze, I saw a face (Come to me)
A second chance, another life to live (Come to me)
How did you forgive me? (Come to me)
Held my head against your chest (Come to me)
Told me everything's alright, don't be afraid (Come to me)
Close your eyes and rest
Through the haze, I saw a face
A second chance, another life to live
How did you forgive me?
Held my head against your chest
Told me everything's alright, don't be afraid

So these are the walls that have to hold this moment
I never expected to be here again

Please, pull me out from this
