Even though I'm on my own
I know I'm not alone
Because I know there's someone, somewhere
Praying that I make it home
So here's one from the heart
My life right from the start
I need a home, sweet home
To call my own

It was you
That told me I could do this
You put the music in my heart
And how you sang with the band in Memphis
It's hard just to be strong
Not knowing if I've done you proud
I like to imagine
You smile when you hear my songs

Even though I'm on my own
I know I'm not alone
Because I know there's someone, somewhere
Praying that I make it home
So here's one from the heart
My life right from the start
I need a home, sweet home
To call my own

A letter home
And I know we don't speak much
And we both know I'm not keen to
But I think there's things I've left unsaid
I'm okay, don't worry
I wish I'd been a better kid
I'm trying to slow down
I'm sorry for letting you down

Even though I'm on my own
I know I'm not alone
Because I know there's someone, somewhere
Praying that I make it home
So here's one from the heart
My life right from the start
I need a home, sweet home
To call my own


You know it's just rock and roll
I know you're by my side through it all
My terror twin and I
Let's take over the world
Even though I'm on my own
I know I'm not alone
Because I know there's someone, somewhere
Praying that I make it home
So here's one from the heart
My life right from the start
I need a home, sweet home
To call my own
Even though I'm on my own
I know I'm not alone
Because I know there's someone, somewhere
Praying that I make it home
So here's one from the heart
My life right from the start
I need a home, sweet home
