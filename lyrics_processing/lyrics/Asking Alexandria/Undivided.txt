As the seconds turn into days
We will never be the same

I told you once and I won't say it again
You never meant a thing to me, a means to an end
If we can't change the past then why should we care?
I don't give a fuck if you're here or you're there
Your God damn beliefs have made you go blind
Your ego, your fame they have poisoned your mind

So take, take, take all your memories (Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!)
'Cause I don't want 'em, and I don't need 'em
So, stay, stay, stay the hell away from me
The truth is I'm moving on
So take, take, take all your memories (Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!)
'Cause I don't want 'em, and I don't need 'em
Stay, stay, stay, the hell away from me

So get the fuck out, fuck out
You'll take this to your fucking grave
Fuck off, fuck off
I thought you'd never make it out alive

You self-righteous, sacrilegious, fucking cunt
Your unintelligent, irrelevant ramblings are falling upon deaf ears
How can you be the voice of a generation
When the only voice you listen to is in your own fucking head?

So take, take, take all your memories (Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!)
'Cause I don't want 'em, and I don't need 'em
So, stay, stay, stay the hell away from me
The truth is I'm moving on
So take, take, take all your memories (Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!)
'Cause I don't want 'em, and I don't need 'em
Stay, stay, stay, the hell away from me

I'm moving on

Hell yeah, so we came here to stay
And none of you can fu-fu-fucking take this away
Fuck yeah, here's what I have to say
Goodbye and so long, it's the start of a new day

As the seconds turn into days (We stand together)
We will never be the same (We stand together)
As the seconds turn into days (We stand together)
We will never be the same (We stand together)
So take, take, take all your memories (Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!)
'Cause I don't want 'em, and I don't need 'em
So, stay, stay, stay the hell away from me
The truth is I'm moving on
So take, take, take all your memories (Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!)
'Cause I don't want 'em, and I don't need them
Stay, stay, stay, the hell away from me

(Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na)
As the seconds turn into days (We stand together)
(Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na)
We will never be the same (We stand together)
(Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na)
As the seconds turn into days (We stand together)
(Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na)
We will never be the same (We stand together)
(Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na)

Hell yeah, so we came here to stay
And none of you can fu-fu-fucking take this away
Fuck yeah, here's what I have to say
