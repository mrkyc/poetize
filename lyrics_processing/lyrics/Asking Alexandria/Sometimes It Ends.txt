I was fucking pissed off man that guy was my best friend and he just kinda turned his back on me, he fucking bailed
Denis actually sat down and said:
"You don't want this album to be about Danny. Danny's in the past now, you need to move on, you need to look forward to your future."
And I was like: "You're right, you're right." and um, I sat down, and, and, I rewrote most of, most of the record um, lyrically anyway with Denis

So here we fucking go
You're going down
You're on your own
And now you're on your own
This hate is endless
Tonight I think I'll cross the line
I'll cross the fucking line
This hate is relentless
Oh! Here we go
Down! This hole
I've lost control
Save me
Oh! Here we go
Down! This hole
I've lost control
Save me

Picking up, picking up another life
Waking up, waking up from all the lies
I feel so alone

Sometimes it ends
Sometimes you fall
Crossing out the man that I've become
I'm standing tall
Stronger than I ever did before
Against them all

I know that you have locked me in your eyes
And I can't resist it
The target on your chest is all that I can see
Fight me now
It's not over
No, no, no, it's not over
Pick me up off the ground just once more
So on I go, on I go
But never alone

Sometimes it ends
Sometimes you fall
Crossing out the man that I've become
I'm standing tall
Stronger than I ever did before
Against them all
Now it's my turn
To drag you through this hell
Through this hell
I, I won't forgive
I won't let go of what you've done

Woke up alone
So sick of this game
I've spent too many years in this house of pain
If you can't find the words, read between the lines
So take it or leave it to me
So take it or leave it to me from here this time

Ah, it was hard to sort of, switch off cause I was still angry inside, but I just...saying it now again it might be something about Danny obviously because being a musician and an artist, I write about what's fueling me, how I'm feeling at the time. But a lot of how I'm feeling is excitement and I am happy and I am extremely grateful to still be going. So I just have to concentrate more of that, sort of, like, for the new record
