Staring eyes wide open, gazin' into nothin', runnin' in place again
Going through the motions, in and out as the oceans, repeatin'
Numb to the silence, to the absence of emotion
The sum of the script, nothin' but a click in the rotation, yeah
Sick of the peace of mind that goes along with keepin' on, and I
Can't keep on keepin' on

Feels like I'm stuck here suspended, at best underwhelming
What's wrong with me? (With me)
My conscious is calling, but the world isn't all it's cracked up to be
I'm hopelessly hopeful (Hopeful, hopelessly hopeful)
That I'm not stuck here suspended
In a world I pretended was right for me (For me), for me

Woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh
What's wrong with me?
Woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh

Strung out on the same old, got an itch for somethin' painful
To feel somethin' real once, to remind myself it's not in my head
Sick of the calm coincidin' with stickin' in and with the line
Can't keep on keepin' on, it all just

Woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh
What's wrong with me?
Woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh
When I close my eyes
(Woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh)
When I leave the light
(Woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh)

Inside it feels like I'm stuck here suspended, at best underwhelming
