Yeah, and they tell me life is short
In the blink of an eye, we come and die, keep it in mind that life is war
Stay grinding, fly and soar, always know what you fighting for
Aging fast, gotta pave a path and go figure out what my life is for
Woo, quick-witted, and every day I gotta switch lanes
Fuck race, no pigment, I got thick skin, making big waves
Positive being positive is my legacy, pray for me or make way for me
'Cause I'm on the way to go change the Earth, and I just may
My life is what I call it, and I call it successful
Now everybody wanna eyeball it, like, "How the fuck he do that, though?"
Take pride in your every action, every day of my life is work
And they tell me that time is money, but only I know what that time is worth

Even if the sky was falling down, down, down, down
Well, even if the sky was falling, well, I'm not falling down
I stand tall through it all, I've risked too much to just give up now
I'm pushing on through, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Sure as the tide rolls in at night
I'll still be here at the end of days screaming at the sky
Let the fire consume and cleanse what's before me
Behold, I'll build my empire 'fore the ashes hit the ground

Life inside a piece of paper, live it through my pen and pad
Lead inside my pencil like the hammer on my pistol back (Rrah)
Ain't no hitting back; life, it ain't no tennis match
All over the net, but that ain't where I do business at, woo
Face to face with adversity and intimidation
This is real, this is raw, ain't no imitation
No limitations, ain't a ceiling in sight
There ain't no rules or regulations, either yield or you fight
Just take a look at where I been, that's some appealing advice
'Cause you can build until it falls or keep it real and you rise

Even if the sky was falling down, down, down, down
Well, even if the sky was falling, well, I'm not falling down
I stand tall through it all, I've risked too much to just give up now
I'm pushing on through, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Sure as the tide rolls in at night
I'll still be here at the end of days screamin' at the sky
Let the fire consume and cleanse what's before me
Behold, I'll build my empire 'fore the ashes hit the ground

Sure as the tides roll in at night
I'll still be here at the end of days screaming at the sky
Let the fires consume and cleanse what's before me
Behold, I'll build my empire 'fore the ashes hit the ground (Ashes hit the ground)
Ashes hit the ground
Sure as the tide rolls in at night
I'll still be here at the end of days screaming at the sky
Let the fire consume and cleanse what's before me
Behold, I'll build my empire 'fore the ashes hit the ground

I'll build my empire 'fore the ashes hit the ground
Even if the sky was falling down
