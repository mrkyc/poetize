You love me for all the wrong reasons
(All the wrong reasons, all the wrong reasons)
There's nothing but pain left here, I know
What's killing me is that I'm killing you

Three years of torment and torturous love
Stained with tears and mistrust, enough is enough
I can't hold you any longer in this hell I'm in
'Cause your heart is too weak for me to break it again
All the mistakes that I've made, you forgave
What the fuck? You shouldn't have stayed
You'd always said, "There's so much love in you"
I can't believe that you can't see that

You loved me for all the wrong reasons
I'm not the same as I used to be
There's nothing but pain left here, I know
What's killing me is that I'm killing you

Do you remember the beginning? Heartbeats one and the same?
Living's smitten in Texas, burning bright as a flame
So young and in love, no care what anyone said
Till my soul grew cold and my heart turned dead
What went so wrong with me? Why did I break this?
Why was I so blind and fucking dumb to see?
That we were perfect till I turned around and gave in to debauchery?
This is your chance to escape this, my goodbye with a last kiss
Yeah, and I know deep down you know that

You loved me for all the wrong reasons
I'm not the same as I used to be
There's nothing but pain left here, I know
What's killing me is that I'm killing you
You loved me for all the wrong reasons
I'm not the same as I used to be
There's nothing but pain left here, I know
What's killing me is that I'm killing you

What's killing me (It's killing me, it's killing me)
Is that I'm killing you
What's killing me (It's killing me, it's killing me)
