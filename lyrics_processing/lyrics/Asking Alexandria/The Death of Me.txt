Am I insane?
I ask myself over and over and over again
Trapped in my brain
Pull it out from the cracks in my skull
Am I alone?
Surrounded by shadows and I think I might just be suffocating
The devil came to take me to hell but I'm already there, yeah
Am I insane? Am I insane? Am I insane?
The devil came to take me to hell but I'm already there, yeah

I won't let you be the death of me
No, I refuse to let you bring me down, bring me down
I won't let you make me out to be
The one who's in the wrong and I've lost my mind before
But now I'm back and I'm better than ever

Am I insane?
I've rolled myself over and screamed till I spit up blood
Trapped in my brain
The itching is incomprehensible, and it won't stop
Am I alone?
The voices who lie, but they just won't fucking go away
The devil came to take me to hell but I'm already there, yeah
Am I insane? Am I insane? Am I insane?
Am I alone surrounded by death? I think this might just be the end
Am I insane? Am I insane? Am I insane?
The devil came to take me to hell but I'm already there, oh

You can't take this away from me
You can't relieve these demons
You can't make this okay for me
You're the one who caused these feelings
I apologise for what I'm about to do
I try to sympathise
But at the end of the day
You brought this on yourself

I won't let you be the death of me
No, I refuse to let you bring me down, bring me down
I won't let you make me out to be
The one who's in the wrong and I've lost my mind before
But now I'm back and I'm better than ever
Now I'm back and I'm better than ever

The tears have left a blur that I can't explain
The pain has left a hole in which my heart should've been
I'm blind with rage and I can't shake this feeling
Irrational, impetuous, intemperate
I'm blind with rage and I can't shake this feeling
Irrational, impetuous, intemperate
I won't let you be the death of me
I refuse to let you bring me down, bring me down
(Irrational, impetuous, intemperate)
I won't let you make me out to be
The one who's in the wrong and I lost my mind before
(Irrational, impetuous, intemperate)
