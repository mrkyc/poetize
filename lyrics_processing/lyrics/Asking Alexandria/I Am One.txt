I could hold you so close and never let you in
I could feel you in my bones and never really feel a thing
You can't climb inside my soul and hold on forever
I couldn't change if I tried, my mind's as the weather
Don't know what I believe in, who I believe in anymore
I know that I'm broken, it's the road that I've chosen to walk alone

I could hold you, I could hold you so close
I could hold you so close and never let you in

Alone among numbers, scream back at the thunder
I learned from the start that all I had was me
I am as one, the father and the son
I am one, I am one

You couldn't believe the fires that I've walked through
The shit that I've overcome, I've never needed you
Taught me from the beginning the only one to believe in
Is myself, so I left and became the wind
I can't be left if I'm alone
I can't be pulled down if I don't hold on

Alone among numbers, scream back at the thunder
I learned from the start that all I had was me
I am as one, the father and the son
I am one

I don't need your love, I don't want your love
I am one, I am one
Again and again, I repeat and explain, am I fucking insane? (Insane)
It's like the words coming out just don't seem to sink in
I am one

Alone among numbers, scream back at the thunder
I learned from the start that all I had was me
I am as one, the father and the son
I am one

I am one, I am one
I am one, I am one
I am one
