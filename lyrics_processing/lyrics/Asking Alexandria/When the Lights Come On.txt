There's a world past the curtains of eager excitement
A sea of impatience, awaitin' incitement
It's all so enticin', it's so mesmerizin'
It's so hypnotizin', the rhythmic beguilin'

Woah, oh, oh, bring the house down
Oh, oh, oh, breathe in, out
In, out, in, out

When the lights come on, when the crowd goes wild
Rip the roof up off of here, take it to the stratosphere, to the stratosphere
Stand up and scream it loud when the fire flies
Rip the roof up off of here, take it to the stratosphere, to the stratosphere

After sitting and waiting and anticipating
The energy through the walls reverberating
It's so captivatin', the buzz generated
It's invigoratin', I feel elevated
