Music is fucking dead
Thanks to you cunts
Stabbing it in the fucking chest
You, and all these fake
Righteous, undeserving bands
Fuck you!

Through sin and self-destruction
I stumble home, never alone
My only home is the bottom of a bottle
And a rolled-up bill and I'm ready to go
I live the same day in and out
And I don't care how long I last
All the girls and drink and drugs
But don't get me wrong
I'm having a fucking blast

I am rock and roll!
Living the life that you can only dream of
I am rock and roll!
At its fucking finest

Just like the cigarettes hurt
Just like the whiskey burns
Whoa, whoa
I guess I'm never going to learn
Just like the cigarettes hurt
Just like the whiskey burns
Whoa, whoa
I guess I'm never going to learn
See Asking Alexandria LiveGet tickets as low as $66You might also like
Not going to stop until my heart stops beating
Not going to stop until my last breath comes
I'm going to go until I hit the floor
And I can't find the way back to my feet (anymore)
Pass me a glass and let's destroy
Everything in this fucking place
Life at 300 miles an hour
You pussies can't keep up
With this fucking pace

I am rock and roll!
Living the life that you can only dream of
I am rock and roll!
At its fucking finest

Just like the cigarettes hurt
Just like the whiskey burns
Whoa, whoa
I guess I'm never going to learn
Just like the cigarettes hurt
Just like the whiskey burns
Whoa, whoa
I guess I'm never going to learn
I've spent the last two years tearing apart my soul
I'll put the next two in, and kick-start the good old days of rock and roll
Without a drink, without regret without a second thought
You hit the nail on the head with the back of your fucking throat

I am rock and roll!
Living the life that you can only dream of
I am rock and roll!
At it's fucking finest

Music is fucking dead
Thanks to you cunts
Stabbing it in the fucking chest
You, and all these fake
Righteous, undeserving bands
