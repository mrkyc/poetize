I am iniquity

You think everything is perfect, silly girl?
There's so much wonder here right in front of your eyes
What could it hurt? What's wrong with you?
Who the fuck is he? Why can't you know? Why can't you know?

And the walls came down, and the heavens opened
It's too late to claim your innocence once the trust is broken
It was just a little taste, it was so sweet
You couldn't imagine in your wildest dreams
You had to taste it, reach out and take it

For just a second, consider why a man who cares so much
Would keep something so simple from someone so innocent?
Maybe he wants it all for himself 'cause he thinks you don't deserve
To feel all the joys that he feels, that you'll never feel
Ask yourself, why does he give you less when he takes more?
Ask yourself, how being free is being locked inside these walls?
Maybe you're weak or a mistake or too emotional
Maybe you're not good enough for his world, maybe you never were

And the walls came down, and the heavens opened
It's too late to claim your innocence once the trust is broken
It was just a little taste, it was so sweet
You couldn't imagine in your wildest dreams
You had to taste it, reach out and take it

He'll never know, I'll never tell
You deserve, you deserve to be free
You have my word, damn me to Hell
You deserve to know, you deserve to be free

And the walls came down, and the heavens opened
It's too late to claim your innocence once the trust is broken
It was just a little taste, it was so sweet
You couldn't imagine in your wildest dreams
You had to taste it, reach out and take it

You had to taste it, reach out and take it
