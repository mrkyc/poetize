Morte et Dabo
Morte et Dabo

So he came forth and said unto me
"Son you are forsaken"
Condemned for the sins that you live
I offer you forgiveness
So he came forth and said unto me
"Son you are forsaken"
Condemned for the sins that you live
I offer you forgiveness

Bow down before me
Bow down before me

I'll never bow to he who claims to be divine
I'll tear down your gates with my bare fucking hands
And burn the world that you rule
Over
No matter how convinced you are you're
Not a God of mine
You're not a fucking God of mine

I never believed in you
From what I see it was justified
I never believed in you
In you

This power over the masses is a gift you don't deserve
When your blood spills, I'll drink from your skull
You can run but you can't hide
Bitch, I'll fucking find you
I'll tear your eyes right out of your self-righteous face
Lord, I'll fucking find you
I'll tear your tongue out of your rancid fucking mouth
Heaven will, burn to the fucking ground
Your world will crumble, and fall from the skies
Blood will spill, and rain upon the earth
Your reign is over, and I'll wear your crown

This is your demise
I know you can feel it in your chest
This is your demise
It's getting closer
This is your demise
I'm creeping from the depths of hell
This is your demise
I know where you sleep
I never believed in you
From what I see it was justified
I never believed in you
In you

Walk away to end the world
What a way to end the world
Walk away to end the world
With false hope in a false God
What a way to end the world
With false hope in you
Walk away to end the world
With false hope in a false God
Walk away to end the world
With false hope in you
Walk away to end the world
