I ain't complaining
But I'm tired, so I'm just saying
What I think
And if we're being honest
Than honestly I think I need a drink
My baby's growing up
She think's she's falling all in love
And that I hate her
At seventeen, she's just like me when I was seventeen
So I don't blame her

Do do do do
Do do do do
What are we going to do ?
Do do do do
Do do do do
What are we going to do ?

Remember when we use to be
Everything they ever need
We had them believing we were cool
It's like it happened over night
We're always wrong, their always right
We use to be the one's breaking the rules
Now we're just mothers, we're just fathers of
Teenage Daughters

She rolls her eyes when I'm funny
But she's sweet when she wants money and her freedom
Oh my god, she's got a car
Swears they won't go far
And I wish I believed 'em

Do do do do
Do do do do
What are we going to do ?

Remember when we use to be
Everything they ever need
We had them believing we were cool
It's like it happened over night
We're always wrong, their always right
We use to be the one's breaking the rules
Now we're just mothers, we're just fathers of
Teenage Daughters

Their beautiful, wild and free
Everything we wish we could be
But their still crazy
Oh you know, the make us crazy
Remember when we use to be
Everything they ever need
We had them believing we were cool
It's like it happened over night
We're always wrong, their always right
We use to be the one's breaking the rules
Now we're just mothers, we're just fathers of
Teenage Daughters

Yeah Teenage Daughters
I ain't complaining
But I'm just tired, so I'm saying
What I think
If we're being honest
