For squandering my second chances
For wrecking every dream
And breaking everything I ever had
Oh yeah
I'm reckless and senseless
I've jumped all the fences
Abandoned all the rules
And crashed like a fool
Out of control
So criminal
You could've let me drown
But you reached your hand out
You met me in the fire
You fanned the flames up higher
Could've left me for dead
But you pulled me from the edge
For loving me the way you do
I know I'm reckless
But you must be reckless, too
For trusting me when I wasn't worth it
Forgiving me when I didn't deserve it
For looking in my eyes and seeing the soul inside and
Crying, crying, crying

Out of control
So criminal
You could've let me drown
But you reached your hand out
You met me in the fire
You fanned the flames up higher
Could've left me for dead
But you pulled me from the edge
For loving me the way you do
I know I'm reckless
But you must be reckless, too
Anyone else would've run, run, run, run
Anyone else would've been done, done, done, done
Anyone else would've stepped on the gas and
Drove away so fast and put me in the past cause baby
I'm reckless and senseless
I've jumped all the fences
Abandoned all the rules
And crashed like a fool
Out of control
So criminal
You could've let me drown
But you reached your hand out
You met me in the fire
You fanned the flames up higher
