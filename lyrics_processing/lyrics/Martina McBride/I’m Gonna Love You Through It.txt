She dropped the phone and burst into tears
The doctor just confirmed her fears
Her husband held it in and held her tight
Cancer don't discriminate
Or care if you're just thirty-eight
With three kids who need you in their lives
He said, "I know that you're afraid and I am, too
But you'll never be alone, I promise you"

When you're weak, I'll be strong
When you let go, I'll hold on
And when you need to cry, I swear that I'll be there to dry your eyes
When you feel lost and scared to death
Like you can't take one more step
Just take my hand, together, we can do it
I'm gonna love you through it

She made it through the surgery fine
They said they caught it just in time
But they had to take more than they planned
And now it's forced smiles and baggy shirts
To hide what the cancer took from her
But she just wants to feel like a woman again
She said, "I don't think I can do this anymore"
He took her in his arms and said "That's what my love is for"

Oh, baby
Yeah, and when this road gets too long
I'll be the rock you lean on
Just take my hand, together we can do it
