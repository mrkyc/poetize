What is this place and why am I here?
I see myself and nothing feels real
I'm torn between this world and the next
Walking the line between life and death

I can see the other side
Ascent of the Blessed
Drawn by a blinding light
I can see the other side
Ascent of the Blessed
I die, die, die

I slowly fade into memory, memory
I slowly fade
Will you remember me!?
Remember me

Making peace with my demons
Now that I see them
I am finding my freedom, as I stop breathing
I'm sinking deeper, can't beat the reaper
All men are mortal, he will be there
I'm looking back full of regret
Not ready yet, I'm cheating death (I kill death)
This might be heaven, this might be hell
I accept both, so farewell
You might also like
I can see the other side
Ascent of the Blessed
Drawn by a blinding light
I can see the other side
Ascent of the Blessed
I die, die, die

I slowly fade into memory, memory
I slowly fade
Will you remember me!?
Remember me

(Will you remember me?)
(Remember me)
I'm torn between this world and the next
(Will you remember me?)
(Remember me)
I'm walking the line between life and death
I turn everything upside down
I kill death!
Time is ticking, ticking away
Will you remember me!?
Remember me
I kill death!
I'm falling through the circles of hell
I see my tired self
At the end of the road
There is no way to go
My heart skips a beat
Makes me forget how to breathe
A void so dark and deep
I'm about to fall into eternal sleep

I slowly fade into memory, memory
I slowly fade
Will you remember me!?
Remember me
I slowly fade into memory, memory
I slowly fade
Will you remember me!?
Remember me

I slowly fade
