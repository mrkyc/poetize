It's my life, it's my path get along or get lost
I don't care if you dare I won't be yours
I'm not here to make friends - I make enemies against the tide - will you follow me?
On a crusade to defend the innocent
This fucked up world will choke on ignorance
Call me freak, call me weird, call me what you want I am who I am until the end
One voice - one heart - we are who we are
One voice - one heart - we are who we are
If you feel like a stranger under your skin
You need to remember the voice deep within
I can't pretend - I know who I am, no stranger to failure
Why don't you understand who I am, a stranger like you are
FUCK!
I don't give a fuck!
No more fears, No regrets cause we know these hollow depth
It's in our heads and it's not over yet...
Can't forgive, won't forget, We pay back - tit for tat
Fuck that!
Fuck that!
Of course I know life's a mess, nothing more, nothing less but we take it like it is
We don't hide behind a mask like you do and always did a fucking puppet on a string trying to fit in - we won't fit in!

One voice - one heart - we are who we are
I can't pretend - I know who I am, no stranger to failure
Why don't you understand who I am, a stranger like you are
Be the voice - no echo - it's your choice
Be the voice - no echo - it's your choice
I can't pretend - I know who I am, no stranger to failure
Why don't you understand who I am a stranger like you are
