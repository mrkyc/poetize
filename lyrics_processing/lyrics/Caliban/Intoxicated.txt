Since I was born I always payed the price
You took everything from me, Everything that I had
I swallow all your rage to fill this hole in my chest
This atrocity, never trust in god
No trust in you, never trust at all
It's time to stay clear in the deepest storm
But one last time I try to move on
Kill the loneliness in me
Break the chains and set me free
I will never look back
Never look back and start again
Start again!
A broken heart, to broke at all
What is right, what is wrong?
Show me something to believe in
Somewhere I belong
But too weak to give up
Still searching for the answer
Alone in the dark!
This atrocity, never trust in god
No trust in you, never trust at all
It's time to stay clear in the deepest storm
But one last time I try to move on
You might also likeKill the loneliness in me
Break the chains and set me free
I will never look back
Never look back and start again
All these wounds will never heal
This could everything appeal?
I will never look back
Never look back and start again
Start again!
I'm sleepless, I'm restless, I'm lost in myself
I'm buried alive with the love turned to hate
When the loved turned to hate
I'm sleepless, I'm restless, I'm lost in myself
I'm buried alive with the love turned to hate
I'm sleepless, I'm restless, I'm lost in myself
I'm buried alive with the love turned to hate

(All the the love, in my life)
I want to feel this way again
(When I'm gone, When I'm gone)
Will you regret what you have done
(All the the love, in my life)
I want to feel this way again
(When I'm gone, When I'm gone)
To realize what I become
Kill the loneliness in me
Break the chains and set me free
I will never look back
Never look back and start again
All these wounds will never heal
This could everything appeal?
I will never look back
Never look back and start again
Start again!
With the love turned to hate
