I still wonder when the medicine will take its effect
And the injection they made, it's all just left me the same
It's hard to concentrate with echoes of your voice in my head
From all you said, I'm still paralyzed

But I'm almost out of breath from saying things that I'll regret, that I'll regret
My time is over
I can't do this alone
But I'm almost out of breath from saying things that I'll regret, that I'll regret
My time is over
I can't do this alone

I'm infected with you, pull the plug already
Tell me before I go that you're infected with me
I'm infected with you, pull the plug already
Tell me before I go that you're infected with me

I can't remember if I ever took a minute to say
That if it had to be now, I'm glad it had to be me
I can't recuperate, I'm never going to leave here alive
Just help me through this
Don't let me die here
You might also like
But I'm almost out of breath from saying things that I'll regret, that I'll regret
My time is over
I can't do this alone
But I'm almost out of breath from saying things that I'll regret, that I'll regret
My time is over
I can't do this alone

I'm infected with you, pull the plug already
Tell me before I go that you're infected with me
I'm infected with you, pull the plug already
Tell me before I go that you're infected with me

I'm killing time just trying to find the words that fall so short of you
I'm losing sleep, I can't compete, I'm giving up
I can't do this alone!
I can't do this alone!
I can't do this, alone!
I can't do this, alone!
