When we broke up
Found out that you were cheating on me
And when we broke up
I was happy to watch you leave
And find another lover
I thought I wouldn't care last that weekend when I saw you
I saw you standing there
:
And I thought that it was over, but it isn't
Just a little liqours cover got me wishing
Now my friends tell me I shouldn't know I drinking
But it's nothing I can do bout it now
:
Got a little drunk last night
And I don't know what I said to you
Got a little drunk last night
And 4 am I started texting you
All the shots I kept on drinking
And it really got me thinking
Thinking about you and I
So I got a little drunk last night
Got a little drunk last night
(short break)
All the shots I keep on drinking
And it really kept me thinking
Thinking about you and I
So I got a little drunk last night
A little drunk last night

Yeah, they told me 
Nothing that I can't deal with
I still recall the feeling my heart is used to be
I'm good in live and know you ain't
The one I supposed to be with
And one thing is the 
 had a couple drinks
Pull me into my feelings and spread out a couple things
Properly outta place
But at least I was fucking honest
Nothing more I related
Than to hear my brothers sing

I don't know what I said to you
When I know I meant it
No, I know that I said the truth
You know I meant it
Got a little drunk last night
