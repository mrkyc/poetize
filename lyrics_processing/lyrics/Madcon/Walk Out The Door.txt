Babygirl I'm a tell you what it is
I love you, but I can't keep going on like this
Can't live without you girl
You on top of my world
Shorty you gotta g-go make up your mind first
Cause I'm sorry for all the shit I've done
That I've done
But I've got a feeling, now tell me you're the one
That you're the one
So baby let me know
Or I'll walk out the door
And find another you and never ever call no more

If you want me to stay
If you want me to stay
If you want me to stay
You've gotta let me know
Or if you want me to go
If you want me to go
If you want me to go

I'll walk out the door (5x)

Ooh-ooh we're in a limbo
Now it's hard, back in the days was simple
We used to make it right on an impulse
And our strength was in everything we've been through
You're like ringo, shine like a star
I never wanted to change you, you're fine like you are
Tenfolds
Mama said there'd be days like this, but I guess we never knew what we was in for
I recall the first day
Like a birthday
And how my studdering talk was kinda nerdy
How you was looking at your friends for a verdict
And how they all Q&A'd like a survey
But me I only cared if you heard
Cause you never gave it away, I earned it
And I used to get around'til you turned me
But I never knew what fire was 'til you burned me


I keep
I keep
Coming in and out and in your door
I creep
I creep
Coming in and out and in your soul
I keep
I keep
Coming in and out
And in your door
I need
I need you more than even know
