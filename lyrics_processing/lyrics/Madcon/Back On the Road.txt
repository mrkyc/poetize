We don't know
Back on the road
Go baby go
Back on the road

My people know about it ('Bout it)
Livin' and strugglin' and strivin' (Strivin')
And the demon's born tonight
Tryna keep us in the blind
And we seek what is hard to find (Find)
In these ridiculous times
'Cause shit is intense
'Cause shit is immense (Uh)

Mom stayed up so I could be
The world before me so I could see
Seein' taught me the facts ain't sweet
Bein' taught me what that gon' need
So it, so it, so it got me going
Had to get back on the road
Got to tell lil' man "Rock the boat"
Got to show lost ones where to go
You might also like
Ayo, we ridin' but we don't know
Every moment but we try to get back on the road
I say we ridin' but don't know where to go (Go baby go)
Ain't it funny how we try to get back on the road?
Get back on the road

My people know about it ('Bout it)
Livin' and strugglin' and strivin' (Strivin')
And our worlds are all collidin'
Tryna keep up with the time
And we seek what is hard to find (Find)
In these ridiculous times
'Cause shit is intense (Yeah)
'Cause shit is immense (Hey yo)

Hey yo
Whenever they tell me, life is heavy
I tell 'em "Me? I do that already"
Too many dudes, and I do their creating
Usually humans are way too selfish
Confusin' our pride with reason
Usin' our minds but time will heal 'em
And though it's like hide and seek
Just follow the signs you read, fool
Ayo, we ridin' but we don't know
Every moment but we try to get back on the road
I say we ridin' but don't know where to go (Go baby go)
Ain't it funny how we try to get back on the road?
Ayo, we ridin' but we don't know
Every moment but we try to get back on the road
I say we ridin' but don't know where to go (Go baby go)
Ain't it funny how we try to get back on the road?
Get back on the road

If you don't know somebody
I guess we done lost your mind a bit
You livin' like you a survivor
I see you walkin' proud as shit
I feel your pain more than a little bit
We in the same pile of shit
Let's walk through the flames together
And see how it ends finally

Ayo, we ridin' but we don't know
Every moment but we try to get back on the road (No, no)
I say we ridin' but don't know where to go (Go baby go)
Ain't it funny how we try to get back on the road?
Get back on the road
This shit was intense, you know? (We don't know)
Wasn't intentional (Back on the road)
Shit was intense (Go baby go, ooh, Lord)
Just look at the state of things (Back on the road)
We don't know
Back on the road
Go baby go
