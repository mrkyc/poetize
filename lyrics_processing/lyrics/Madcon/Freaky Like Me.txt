Haha, it's Madcon
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Woah, oh, oh
Freaky like me, freaky like me
Freaky like me, me, me
Freaky like me, freaky like me
Freaky like me, me, me

It was early in the morning, I hear the shower runnin'
I almost can't remember who this girl might be
And then she came back and I couldn't believe my eyes
This pretty young thing with her eyes on me

I know you like it when I put my hands like that
Whisper in your ear, tell me how you like that
Gettin' freaky-eaky, that's what I do best
So come a little closer, come a little closer

No one's gonna do you as freaky like me
Freaky like me, freaky like
Freaky like me, freaky like me
Freaky like me-me-me, no one
No one's gonna do you as freaky like me
Freaky like me, freaky like
Freaky like me, freaky like me
Freaky like me-me-me, no one
You might also like
(As freaky, as freaky)
No one
(As freaky, as freaky)

I'm feeling up her thighs as I'm running down her curves
I hear my kitty purr as she lay it on me
We windin' and grindin', a part of me is rising
Baby, like a fire burnin' all around me

I know you like it when I put my hands like that
Whisper in your ear, tell me how you like that
Gettin' freaky-eaky, that's what I do best
So come a little closer, come a little closer

No one's gonna do you as freaky like me
Freaky like me, freaky like
Freaky like me, freaky like me
Freaky like me-me-me, no one
No one's gonna do you as freaky like me
Freaky like me, freaky like
Freaky like me, freaky like me
Freaky like me-me-me, no one
Shorty, no one never, ever, ever could do
Do you as good, as freaky as I do
Shorty, no one never, ever, ever could do
Do you as good, as freaky as I do

You got me going crazy when you turn me like that
Your freaky-eaky got me hooked, you're right on track
Every time you leave I wanna push right back
Turn back, I need that, no one can freak me like that

Ameerah, Madcon, ayy
No one can freak me like that, come on (Haha, woo)

No one's gonna do you as freaky like me (Woah, oh, oh)
Freaky like me, freaky like
Freaky like me, freaky like me
Freaky like me-me-me, no one
No one's gonna do you as freaky like me
Freaky like me, freaky like (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Freaky like me, freaky like me
Freaky like me-me-me, no one
And no one, and no one
It's freaky, freaky like (Me)
And no one, and no one
It's freaky, freaky like (Me)
Woah, oh, oh (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
Yeah
