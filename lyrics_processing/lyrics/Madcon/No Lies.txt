Times are getting colder
But I'm still waiting for you
Just be-because I need you more
Don't go, not over no (yeah)

June 15, first night we spent
I think I saw you naked
I've been lost since then
I'm scared it's just a lie (so scared)
The weather got us blind, and I'm lost in you, that's why

I wanna say this when I'm sober
No lie (no lies)
Even though the summer's over
Be mine (be mine, oh mine)
Just think about what I said
But don't over think it
Summer's over
But we're not

I wanna say this when I'm sober
No lies (no lies)
Even though the summer's over
Be mine (be mine, oh mine)
Just think about what I said
But don't over think it
Summer's over
But we're not, we're not
You might also like
Got down with a passion
Always love how you mix cute with the sassy
Unforgettable nights 'bout how we smashing
Always saw the answer in your eyes, never asked it
We was either laughing
Or busy being rivals and debating
And then go back blasting more
Don't even wanna pause
I wanna go again and do it all
I wanna be with my Cherie amor
Please be a dream and I wake up
No diabetes, get the sweets and let's cake up
You be on that jeeze with the feels that I make up
But know we got the keys, you the freeze I'm the Jacob
Yeah, this hall of fame of summer time
How we start with a spark and see you come alive
We could deeply connect and we could dumb it down
I'm staying sober
