If you came to party, I hope you got some shawties
Cause I'm feeling like ''yeah'' tonight

Everybody on the floor
Looks like an ocean and I'm riding away

So we stay fly, so high like we can take you away

Sleep in 'til whenever
Feel like I-I, feel like I-I
Feel I just had the worst day ever
Head out my-my, head out my-my
Checks make this a night to remember
Not only do I feel like I'm the shit, but it's so

We stunted hard on everyone in here, being bad and it shows
Flashing out the bar so hard you're gonna need a raincoat, oh, oh

And I'm not afraid to fail cause it's not gon' be
Dammit, I'm a lion
Body full of scars, but I'm hard so ain't got cold feet
Whatever, man, it's hot, don't sleep
If you're good with it everybody rock on three
