It's in effect but they ain't ready at all
It's unaccepted, but if it ain't calm
It's unfair, now they give another bomb
You know? Cyner-nigyzing from Madcon

I'm sayin', "Dance for me, let me feel the fire in you"
There ain't a chance motherfuckers gettin' tired of usin' it
Music manifest the fine grooves and that's (Right, right)
You can't deny this foolish (Yeah, live, live)
See how the Con be doin' it
We didn't rise in the snow, lettin' it show, he-he (Woah-woah)
I'm tellin' your soul, man (Mm-hmm)
Said, I told you so

I'm lookin' for a t-t-t-t-thing like this
All my (People) people get down and dance like this (Yeah, go)
You gettin' your stance, your man steady thinkin' (Thinkin')
"Damn, nigga, you're fucked, just pass that spliff" (Spliff)
Like you was liftin', you get that automatic feelin'
When it kicks like "Damn" when your shit spin
You feelin' big tens writin' the truth, but nah (Nah)
Lil' man, it's just the fire in you
