Ooh, put your loving hand out, baby
I'm beggin'

(Beggin') beggin' you
Put your lovin' hand out, baby
(Beggin') beggin' you
Put your lovin' hand out, darlin'

Ridin' high, when I was king
Played it hard and fast, 'cause I had everything
Walked away, wonderin' then
Would easy come, and easy go, and it would end?

So, why any time I leave, ya let me go?
Any time I reach, ya get me low?
Any time I seek, ya let me know?
But I planted that seed, just let me grow
I'm on my knees while I'm (Beggin')
'Cause I don't wanna lose (You)
I got my arms outspread
I hope that my heart gets fed
Matter of fact, girl, I'm beggin'
You might also like
(Beggin') beggin' you
Put your lovin' hand out, baby
(Beggin') beggin' you
Put your lovin' hand out, darlin'

I need you (Yeah) to understand (Woah)
Tried so hard (Hey) to be your man
The kind of man (Oh) you want in the end (Woah)
Only then can I begin to live again

An empty shell I used to be
Shadow of my life was hangin' over me
A broken man that I don't know
Won't even stand the Devil's chance to win my soul

What we doin'? What we chasin'?
Why the bottom? Why the basement?
Why we got good shit, don't embrace it?
Why the feel for the need to replace me?
You're on a runway track from the good
I want it painted, a picture tellin' where we could be at
Like the heart ain't attached where it should
You done gave it away, you had it 'til you took it back
But I keep walkin' on, keep open doors
Keep hopin' for, that the court is yours
Keep hoes on hold, 'cause I don't wanna live in a broken home
Girl, I'm beggin' (Beggin', beggin')
(Beggin') beggin' you
Put your lovin' hand out, baby
(Beggin') beggin' you
Put your lovin' hand out, darlin'

I'm fightin' hard (Yeah)
To hold my own (Hold my own)
Just can't make it all alone (All alone)
I'm holdin' on (Yeah)
Can't fall back (Now I'm fallin')
I'm just a con about to fade to black

And I can't come home, you call (Beggin')
And I can't come home, you call
Can't come home, you call (Beggin')
And I can't come home, you call
(Can't come home, you call
Can't come home, you call
Can't come home, you call)

(Beggin') beggin' you
Put your lovin' hand out, baby
(Beggin') beggin' you
Put your lovin' hand out, darlin'
(Beggin') beggin' you
Put your lovin' hand out, baby
(Beggin') beggin' you
