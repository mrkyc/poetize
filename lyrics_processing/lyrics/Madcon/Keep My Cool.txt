Girl
You know I've been around the world
But nothing can beat the view
Off you putting that thing to work, like a 9 to 5

You got them sun kissed thighs
Girl you're hotter than july
If I act a fool
It's because of you
You take me back in time
Feels like 1989
If I act a fool
It's because of you

How am I supposed to keep my cool
Ooh, ooh, oo-ooh
Ooh, ooh, oo-ooh
When I'm next to you
How am I supposed to keep my cool
Ooh, ooh, oo-ooh
Ooh, ooh, oo-ooh
Girl you're such a view
How am I supposed to keep my...
Cool
How am I supposed to keep my cool
Ooh, ooh, oo-ooh
Ooh, ooh, oo-ooh
When I'm next to you
How am I supposed to keep my

Mind on my money, and my money on my mind
When you keep dancing, the way you dancing
Beast mode, you own that shit
Don't you quit, no baby don't you quit

You got them sun kissed thighs
Girl you're hotter than july
If I act a fool
It's because of you
You take me back in time
Feels like 1989
If I act a fool
It's because of you

How am I supposed to keep my cool
Ooh, ooh, oo-ooh

When I'm next to you
How am I supposed to keep my cool
So fresh and so clean
Try and get a vibe, but keep it low key
I said don't worry them drinks is on me
But how to keep cool when this chick is so real
Damn, blown off the beat
I repeat to myself "keep cold when you meet her"
Don't need to get drunk to talk
But with that juice in your trunk

How am I supposed to keep my cool
Ooh, ooh, oo-ooh
Ooh, ooh, oo-ooh
When I'm next to you
How am I supposed to keep my cool
Ooh, ooh, oo-ooh
Ooh, ooh, oo-ooh
