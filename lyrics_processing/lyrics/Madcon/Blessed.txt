That feelin' I get from your eyes
That feelin' I get from your smile

Not many people have been this blessed  (Naw)
On the contrary most people live in endless stress
I'm hopin' to share a child with you when the time is due
Finally I get to live a life with you
Instead of talkin' for a while that we always do
Laughin', and sometimes I hear cryin' too, shit!
I know exactly what I'd rather do
Pamper you, wanted the half, come over gladly
And have your moms tell how you made a bad mistake
Fall in love with a man unfaithfull as a dragon
I can't understand it but lately I've been damned
You don't know what you got 'til it's gone and got again
I treasure you more than ever like you bought him a lens
Or better, I'm moldin', I'm in a ballin' bliss
Tellin' the world for all the witness on knees
Had to get it of my heart 'cause it's hard to breathe, I tell ya

I've been blessed, I've been blessed
That feelin' I get from your kiss (Your kiss)
That feelin' I get from your lips
I've been blessed, I've been blessed
That feelin' I get from your eyes (Your eyes)
That feelin' I get from your smile

Not too many people have been this blessed
I'm talkin' 'bout that lovin', give you that feelin' that make that stretch
When y'all playin' that part
So part I did and, ma, I gave you a heart with all that's left
'Cause I love all your talkin', feel your persona, could we
Double the force, I'm meanin' more drama
But, hold it, girl, I'ma major you honor
My heart's at stake so I'm playin' with karma, uh-uh
Laughin' on the phone or such
Mendin' pics from my trips on a coffee mug
I was sick when I lost you once
You the only on my heart you the only one, and, please, believe
The need to feel a real love, love
For me to feel as real of love
And when you told me you loved me I was numb in the chest
That's how I knew that I...

I've been blessed, I've been blessed
That feelin' I get from your kiss (Your kiss)
That feelin' I get from your lips
I've been blessed, I've been blessed
That feelin' I get from your eyes (Your eyes)
That feelin' I get from your smile
I remember the first time we ever met
You said you wasn't the best
And why is everybody talkin' 'bout a kid?
And, uh, a couple years went on and here we is
Talkin' about a future and sharin' a crib
Among other things, I miss you whenever you distant
It pisses me off I wasn't the first one here
To take your innocence away, that shit hurts me still
But I deserve it for hurtin' your feelings back then
Beneath I'm still tryna find my ways
And, man, if you know what I mean I ain't tryna blame it on names
In defense, I'm tryna talk to you or understand
I'm tryna say what I meant way back when the yesterday

I've been blessed, I've been blessed
That feelin' I get from your kiss (Your kiss)
That feelin' I get from your lips
I've been blessed, I've been blessed
That feelin' I get from your eyes (Your eyes)
