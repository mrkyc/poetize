I'm tryna talk to you
But you won't listen (There)

What it is (What it do)
Let me spit somethin' to you
What we had was a lot, and we knew it but we liked it
Besides it was bound to fall apart in time
So let it wither while we dyin' starin' into each other's eyes
Pretend, that's fine with me, no offense
But time will heal, let me a-trash on this
I'm on hands with this shit and your constant bitchin' give me migraines
I'm tryna get out of here but can't
Let another man get down with sweetness, nah
You too fine for that, yo
And you notice, I'm lookin' at her motherfuckin' golds
'Cause that body you get cast, homie, huh

You're so hard to read (Oh-woah)
Can't understand a word of what could mean (No, no)
You're so hard to read (To read) to me, can't understand a word you speak
You're so hard to read, baby

(No I) can't say the words I wanna hear
You make hurt inside that's why you got to leave
Don't want to waste my time and we can't seem to find a way out of this riddim
I tried but you didn't, hard to read
You might also like
I stepped up, not for you one to talk
So I wrote down these words, I'll tell 'em if you walk with me
I hate it when we part ways, somethin' like a dark age
I just want you to find a spark with me
Like, when I st-start to stutter, I'm lettin' down my guard
I'm hard, but I'm butter
Why won't you talk to a brother? Let go's
Like everytime you I'm givin' you my hand, you get cold
If I'm the car, you're petrol
But everytime we talk it's like I'm slippin' on wet floor
I'm tryna correct wrongs, girl you a part of me
You my heart why you so fuckin' hard to read?

You're so hard to read (Oh-woah)
Can't understand a word of what could mean (No, no)
You're so hard to read (To read) to me, can't understand a word you speak
You're so hard to read, baby

(Number one)
I can't say that we actually have fun
We never had a moment of clarity, we was that drunk (Two)
Whenever you started shit I had to laugh
'Cause ain't nobody talkin' to me, I'm out that door (Three)
You hard to read, and that's all
We never matched so ain't a damn thing we can do (Four)
It was in-fuckin'-evitable, but, uh, it was in-fuckin'-credible too (Anyway)
Baby, don't preach, but I confess to you in need (Anyway)
I had to leave, 'cause you weren't ready for me (Anyway)
I know we had a good run, love
And I hate it when the good get done, but, uh (Anyway)
I'm thinkin' it's best we part ways, I been tryna tell you, but

You're so hard to read (Oh-woah)
Can't understand a word of what could mean (No, no)
You're so hard to read (To read) to me, can't understand a word you speak
