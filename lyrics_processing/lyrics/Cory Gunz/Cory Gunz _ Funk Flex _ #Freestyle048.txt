Uh, ready for combat
Detonate as soon as they locate where the bomb's at
Clips long as legs, they don't know where your arms at
Niggas want smoke until they catch a contact
Try son a kid and you won't find where your mom's at
Bitch I'm the ripper, fuck around, get your car jacked
Prolly find 'em parked where it ain't no garage at
Close range, trinity, they never dodge that
Never gave a fuck about your crew, lay your squad flat
Only talk to few, put they chin up I nod back
Duckin' from the blues 'cause they tint up the Dodge black
Find me on a cruise somewhere send up the lodge at
You know the rules I bend, grimy ones move in sin
Moves extend with Tommy guns, tools to spend
Use the pins, bed pans scattered around
Rather have a cap in your gown or splatter the ground
On your back, flatten and drown from the 'matic or pound
Ain't even gotta initiate the static with sound
Practicing acrobatics with clowns
Abracadabra the MAC inaccurate the bastards at bat get a round
Laugh at it now and you cry when you die, I'ma do my
Thing singing outta two rides, lotta doodah
Heat steaming hot as Dubai, lotta hooblah
He screaming 'how could you why?' I don't reply
Pussies thinking y'all got new lives
Well I got 2 nines and use one to kill 'em two times to run my coupons
Niggas thinking shit is Poupon till they get poop on
Pull up in a group of Yukon's then nigga you gone
Ain't shit that you gon', come do my one-two too calm
It's one pew, you bomb
Train dance with Nina, Johnny and Peggy right in a leggy
Probably pocket leave you Betty Spaghetty, set if you ready
Cold block hot as a stove top
I'm from where the cookouts get turned into roadblocks, unload shots
Aim at his face with a nose dot
I'm from where they leave your body fresh and your clothes hot
Motherfucking...
Robbing niggas for pounds, they rob kids for stacks they grow up
Lay 'em down, I'm from the way it sound
Get out don't stand downs
No rules on my team, no doubt, playing foul
Not with the games, bounce
You 'bout to get flamed down
And jumped like Blade Brown
And covered like James Brown
Don't go against grains, I po' up
Get brains then roll up
Spliff stains then hold up
Lyft change then owe up
Flip change then roll up on this gain
All of you dicks shook, I call 'em piss stains
Welcome to the Terrordome
The danger zone, can't a stranger roam
Bang I'm blown, you set in stone leave my name alone
I live like I'm dead already
I think like I'm shot in the head already
For me is what y'all niggas never ready
Double grip on the Eagle make sure the Desert steady
I'm not just Ed nigga I'm Edd and Eddy
I'm a vet you probably said the shit I said already
For talking beef when you was petting you was never ready
Before you beef with me it's best to go to bed with Freddy
You tryna gamble with life until you get a deady
You know the shortie hold the 40 if the chick is wit' him
These niggas snaking they be shaking when they hit with venom
Stinking in the vacant baking when he shit his denim
And now he laking with the fishes wit' him
'Cause we in them dangerous grounds
Trey pound seven spin around for my bredrin, the clouds come down
War and peace, I take it to the street
Land sharp on my lawn, chop the thumbs off a thief
So run when I reach, you're young held accountable for gums that you preach tryna slum with the beast
Militia to the corpse
Round fully horsed power barrels like exhaust and I'm bound onto the cross
'Bout to go on a acid trip
And pull a rabbit trick that's harder than fucking a fat bitch with a flaccid dick
I'm living the life of a rabid pit
Getting habit kick doing gymnastic flips in a lit plastic splish
Favorite punchline, pass the grip
But I still slash and switch and eat a nigga quicker than an ass or clit
I grew around a lotta broken glass, plastic tips
The ghost of Christmas past the fence I was stashing gifts
I'm a massive risk
Get my hands dirty and on the stretcher like I got elastic fists, bitch
Beware I've awakened
Prepare to be shaken, you're fairly mistaken if a joke's what I'm here to be taken
Pardon to all my students for the hiatus today
I promise I was responsible for the Bronx Marble shootings
I'm Malcom and Martin Luther mixed with all three Michael's a part of Bruce
A spritz of Prince and a Martian molecule
Psychologically, biologically, diabolical down to the follicle
A bunch of other shit y'all confused
I say fuck a truce, handle shit how I choose
Me myself and I and the rest of me, I keep y'all to you
Everybody learning to rap, I'm trying to find the school that qualified the fools I'ma shit on and climb inside the stool
Recognize that I'm not the problem, they kinda blind to rules
They game's under global warming, I'm hot, your climate's cool
They think they could spit I'm dropping a vomit pool
I'm not enthused, my flow is watching a comet move
Think I'ma choose
Life or death, think I'ma lose?
Until you yabbadabbadoo out your designer shoes
Hopping out in a pair of Vans
Show you how to X games, make you 720 and clear the fans
I'm the ice man, in a tie-dye van
Watching Sinister with the Jigsaw and the Bye Bye Man
And, I'm the last nigga you wanna see attack
The difference is I be breathing but he ain't breathing back
I walk through any block like I don't even rap
Fuck stitches we dine snitches and make 'em eat a rat
See I was taught crime and I fought clean
Have 'em screaming 'What are those?' then let off steam
Find 'em impostors I bonded with mobsters
Deciding where bodies should drop over lasagna and lobster
They say I'm, cuckoo a little the two-two is little I'm brutal and civil
I got the M's, you do the skittles
Brutal and civil, eating Bugles for dinner
Now you name a rapper I snatch him for snacking his skinner
The butcher the bitches grew on to pushers and pitchers
Around the bushes and dishes get found like kush in the Swishers
Holy father my holy water's a dirty soda
I been riding dirty since diapers right in a dirty stroller
With a baby bottle, a Miller Lite is my only cola
So immune to the bullshit I probably could hold Ebola
Smack his Macaulay Culkin, I was a home-aloner
