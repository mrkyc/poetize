You're so motherfucking sexy, sexy baby
Could you imagine you and me making love like crazy?
On the bed, on the floor, on the way to the shower
We can do it, we can do it, we can do it for hours
You're so motherfucking sexy, sexy baby
Could you imagine you and me making love like crazy?
On the bed, on the floor, on the way to the shower
We can do it, we can do it, we can do it for hours

I wake up, stretch for the cieling
Recovering from last night's sexual healing
Lil mama double jointed, I'm stiffer than steal
Had a nigga bent, what a flexable feeling
I just need my baby girl to come over
Give ya boy something sweet to put his tongue over
One leg on my waist, one leg on my shoulder
And shawty we can do it like 
Smelling like money, I'm loving your oter
 ho
And I tell her that I love her 
Shit, shawty's a defenet dime
And your shine remind me of me when I'm rhyming
Keep it smooth

You're so motherfucking sexy, sexy baby
Could you imagine you and me making love like crazy?
On the bed, on the floor, on the way to the shower
We can do it, we can do it, we can do it for hours
You're so motherfucking sexy, sexy baby
Could you imagine you and me making love like crazy?
On the bed, on the floor, on the way to the shower
We can do it, we can do it, we can do it for hours

She keep it simple and plane
She always  complaining
One on one 
 know she did it for 
 red bottoms, that Luie Vaton perse
I can't do nothing for you I ain't did for  first
You know the flow fire, for a long verse
Before I was a jerk, I made your palms hurt
 cause so much confusion
 open as 
A lot of things change, I'm all about my music
With the  that I'm moving, I make a song 
Feel your hips while I play in your hair
Praying that you feel the same  looking straight in my stare
I could hold you right now, while I lick your body up
Do it like I never got enough
You're so motherfucking sexy, sexy baby
Could you imagine you and me making love like crazy?
On the bed, on the floor, on the way to the shower
We can do it, we can do it, we can do it for hours
You're so motherfucking sexy, sexy baby
Could you imagine you and me making love like crazy?
On the bed, on the floor, on the way to the shower
