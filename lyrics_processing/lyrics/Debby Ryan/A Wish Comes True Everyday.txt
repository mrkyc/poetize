If you've ever been afraid of anything
This song's for you, I know you're feelin' me
If you ever wanted to do something big
But then you stopped, just couldn't handle it
If you take a chance, then it'll be alright
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon
C'mon, you know it's time
Just pu-pu-push it down and then you'll win the fight
You're better than this, you're better than that
Come on, let's make it right

Nothing's getting in my way now (Oh-oh)
Nothing ever will again (Oh-oh)
And if you're with me, come on, say now (Oh-oh)
We're gonna make it, hey
We're gonna take what we can

Not gonna settle for nothin', no
Just find the courage, get up and go
Oh no, we're not gonna take it slow
You hear what I'm saying?
There's no time to wait
A wish comes true every day
You might also like
Today's the day, you know it is

You know you wanted to do somethin' big
Just take the plunge, yeah, you can handle it
If it can happen to me, it can happen to you
Go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on
Go make your wish come true
Don't miss the chance you've got to do what you want to
You're better than this, you're better than that
We're gonna make it through

Nothing's getting in my way now (Oh-oh)
Nothing ever will again (Oh-oh)
