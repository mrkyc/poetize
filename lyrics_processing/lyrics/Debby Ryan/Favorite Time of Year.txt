Gotta have a little mistletoe
Mix it with a little jingle bells
Need to have a bit of winter snow (Winter snow)
Yeah-eh
Come on over, celebrate with me
Hang us up on a Christmas tree
Tie it all up with a perfect bow

You and I (You and I)
Will be dreaming tonight
By the fire
Can't wait 'cause it's my

Favorite time of year
Yeah, it's almost here
Can you see it now?
It's comin' and comin' and comin' around
My favorite time of year
Feel it in the air
Can you feel it now?
It's comin' and comin' and comin' around
(Comin' and comin' and comin' around)

Going out to see the city lights
Walking with you on a Saturday night
We'll be singing everywhere we go (Where we go)
Yeah-eh
We'll be busy making memories
All the way up until New Year's Eve
We'll be dressing up in red and gold

You and I (You and I)
Will be dreaming tonight
