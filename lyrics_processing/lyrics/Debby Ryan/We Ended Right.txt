Whoa oh oh, whoa oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh, oh

I step back, take a look in your direction
Seeing the reflection, the same single man
That had taken you for granted
Like water in the desert, I didn't think it'd happen
But I guess it had to happen
Staring at the glass, eyes in a trance
As you walk through the grass
With my shadow in the past
And I know that this moment's gonna last my life
Why? 'Cause it happens all the time

I won't throw it all away with everything
Woah-oh, I want you back here
Can't you see?

Please refrain from opening skies
Your time came with the rain but now it's dry
Gonna take more than just time
We ended right as you cut the ties
With knives of lies
You might also like
Whoa oh oh, whoa oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh, oh

I know it doesn't matter everything I said and
I told you once again 'cause your mind is pretty set
Yeah, you noticed what I did, but do I deserve this?
Okay, maybe yes, so it's probably the end
But think about the truth, all I gave to you
Never once a lie, no, not a single time
Not until tonight, and that's where you are so right
To put up a fight and leave me all alone
With your goodbyes

I won't throw it all away with everything
Woah-oh, I want you back here
Can't you see?

Please refrain from opening skies
Your time came with the rain but now it's dry
Gonna take more than just time
We ended right as you cut the ties
With knives of lies
And I know I did you wrong
But now it's said and done
And I'm sorry, I am sorry
Yeah, I took and broke your heart
And your world was torn apart
But I'm sorry, I am sorry
Yeah, I know I did you wrong
But now it's said and done
And I'm sorry, I am sorry (Sorry)
Yeah, I took and broke your heart
And your world was torn apart
But I'm sorry, I am sorry

Whoa oh oh
Whoa oh oh
Woah-oh, woah
Woah oh oh

I need you so, you need to know
We ended right, but why?

Please refrain from opening skies
Your time came with the rain but now it's dry
Gonna take more than just time
We ended right (Right) as you cut the ties
Please refrain from opening skies
Your time came with the rain but now it's dry
Gonna take more than just time (Oh)
We ended right as you cut the ties
With knives of lies
I need you so, you need to know
