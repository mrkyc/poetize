I'm on the road to taking back my city now
Pressure on Me man I couldn't wait
Everybody wanna talk now
Don't make me say something I shouldn't say
Prays only for the daily pay
Up and grinding I don't hesitate
U real and it's something you can relate to
Money talking I'm the conversation
Come to my city I'm ballin
I'm feeling like Kenneth Kaunda
Come to my city I'm chosen
I'm feeling like Kenneth Kaunda
Come to your city I'm taking over man
I'm feeling like Kenneth Kaunda
Independent presidential nigga
Got me feeling like Kenneth Kaunda
I'm feeling like Kenneth Kaunda
I'm feeling like Kenneth Kaunda
Kenneth Kaunda Kenneth Kaunda

Never took a chance to admit it
The best no God damn gimmick
I just wish mama was here
Just I did it yeah mama I did it
Now I get it how I'm living this way more than just a image
Started and I'm gonna finish
Started up out of the trenches
Now nights is so restless I gotta hit them with a vengeance
For all the times they no
Now everything I say go
They said wait a minute wait a minute
Nuh Me no wanna watch time go
Slow flow game cold tote smoke rake dough
Fifty g'z on a video
Tell a hater cheerio I'm on a whole another level

You don't even know what I've been through
Cutting niggas up like a ginsu
To kicking it like jiu-jitsu
Red dot to your head like a Hindu
Got a Thot over there wearing see through
I'm no recruit I be recruiting them niggas
Trynna get figures like jigga's
Bursting with flavour
Drinking it straight with no chaser
Nothing make me move but paper
Cause most of these niggas is fakers
So I don't do favour for favour
The blaze be burning out the vape
It's c.o.d no PayPal
I ain't the one who gon' save her
Your circle be full of them squares
You need shape up or meet your maker
I'm on the road to taking back my city now
Pressure on Me man I couldn't wait
Everybody wanna talk now
Don't make me say something I shouldn't say
Prays only for the daily pay
