Move away
Move away
Spirit changed the conversation
Stepping stones across the land
I never wanted to be a hero
I never wanted to be a man
I hurt you, darling
I made you cry
I hurt you, darling
Don't ask me why
Move, move, move away from me, darling
I never said I'd hold your hand
Move, move, move away from me, darling
I never said I'd understand
But if I could say this was judgment day
You know I'd be a millionaire
I'm prepared to wear my sorrow
Everywhere we go in town
Ain't no need to beg or borrow
While you're there to drag me down
You might also likeI hurt you, darling
I made you cry
I hurt you, darling
Don't ask me why, oh, yeah
Move, move, move away from me, darling
I never said I'd hold your hand
Move, move, move away from me, darling
I never said I'd understand
But if I could say this was judgment day
You know I'd be a millionaire, yeah, yeah
Just tonight
(Move away)
I need you so
I can't let go
I hurt you, darling
I made you cry
I hurt you, darling
Don't ask me why, oh, why
Move, move, move away from me, darling
I never said I'd hold your hand
Move, move, move away from me, darling
I never said I'd understand
(Moving, moving)
Move, move, move away from me, darling
I never said I'd hold your hand
But if I could say this was judgment day
I'd be a millionaire, oh, yeah
Ooh, yeah
(Moving, moving, move away)
I never said that I'd hold your hand
(Move, move, move, away)
(Why don't you move?)
I never said I'd understand
(Moving, moving, move away)
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh, yeah
(Move, move, move, away)
(Why don't you move?)
Why don't you move away?
(Moving, moving, move away)
