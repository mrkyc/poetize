There is nothing that can stop my eyes
From crying, crying
Nobody likes to be alone
When you put the pressure down on me
'Cause I don't quite fit your imagery
I'm trying, trying
Baby, I'm no Superman
Baby, I'm no Superman
Eyes like a deep blue sea
Yes, to dive in
Dive in
Love that you give to me
We're surviving
Surviving
When love is gone
I can't carry on
When you know that love is on my mind
When you know that love is on my mind
It's a perfect chance to be unkind
You do it, do it
Within the realms of misery
Being sly, you take a chance on crime
But the master has a new design
On loving, living

Out and in the enemy
Eyes like a deep blue sea
Yes, to dive in
Dive in
Love that you give to me
We're surviving
Surviving
When love is gone
I can't carry on
Eyes that open wide
Do you do
The love you give the child
Do you do
Why do you do that to me
Oh yeah
When I wake up feeling victimized
There is nothing that can stop my eyes
From crying, crying
Nobody likes to be alone
When you put the pressure down on me
'Cause I don't quite fit your imagery
I'm trying, trying
Baby, I'm no Superman
Hey baby, I'm no Superman
