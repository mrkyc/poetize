There is only one path, and one path only: It is the path of relentless struggle!

Hey, my name is Montsho Eshe, and I'm the one to bust this funky step with Arrested Development! Hey! Y'all know my family, so check it out:
Say "Power to the people!"
(Power to the people!)
Say "Power to the people!"
(Power to the people!)
Say "People!"(People!)
Say "People!"(People!)
Say "People!"(People!)
So let the brothers and sisters check it out:

United minds of America
Make your vocal chords reach the clouds and
Touch the crowd of folks that overstand there's no jokes
We must network together as one and
Tell the oppressor we'll take no less than
Total justice a social setting, yo I'm betting
We can stop New World Order
Start serving liberty, may I take your order
Free political prisoners without no question
Let's give props where due
If it was you wouldn't you want to know
That someone cares for what you do so let's show
Political prisoners, homeless humans, organizations, various movements
That the people in America have some discipline
To act on their belief therefore stress activism
Although you are only one person
If for truth you still thirst, well thirst then
Make the difference by joining some organization or some movement
Let me explain the powers that be, are families of power with old money
Unfortunately on their souls hangs a sold sign and in righteous sight they are so blind
Infatuated with their power and their greed, they don't see that God is the answer
Greed has planted a seed within the souls of the thirteen families
Drug dealers and hustlers
All my brothers and sisters that are hustlers
Sellin' crack cocaine to your followers, to me you're a sell out an Uncle Tom
In the tom tom club droppin bombs
Causin' confusion shootin' and killin'
You're playin' the role putting fear in populations
Making us allow the system to protect us
Allowing the chicken snake to protect the chickens
Police brutality claiming victims
The powers that be may come with their solutions
But trust me their trees bear No fruits no
I guess that's why I get spiritual
Spirituality supports reality no not Catholic no not Baptist
No not passive
Very active
You might also likeUnited minds of the Americas, minds of Africa and the Caribbean
And the Europeans and the Asians and Australians
It's not just race we're all in this together
Lets play a game of jeopardy what's the question
Social Medicines the answer
I try to eat healthy to avoid the cancer
One ounce of prevention beats 100 pounds of cure
Pure ways of living is not hippish
It's not white not black it's just conscious
Conscious of your health, conscious of your soul
Instead of being so damn conscious of your wealth
Or lack of so
Do you know about the Panthers
The MOVE organization, Kwame
Nkrumah, the Zulu nation or just Nikes and Pumas
Or your fascination with the so-called B-Boy fashion nation
If you can please recycle
Even the people in the hood please recycle
I know it wasn't our fault that they went psycho
They meaning industry exec's who flex for profit
Traditional societies and islanders
Please retain your culture and don't give up
Don't you understand we must understand this
