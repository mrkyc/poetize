Mix the sunshine add some rain
A pinch of loving sow a seed and
The grass can be greener on the other side
The grass can be greener on the other side
And the people go
Ah-ay, Ah-ay, Ah-ay, Ah-ay
Ah-ay, Ah-ay, Ah-ay, Ah-ay

Friends of mine worry about they welfare
They're not really doing well they're just doing fare
Without medical healthcare pockets bare
Hiding their car far from repo man
Checking caller ID before they answer they phone
Bill collectors call round the clock at their home
But they still wanna gone & replace their light bulbs
Blacks want to be green, we wanna recycle
Many of us poor so we take the mass transport
Walk streets, bump beats, that's what the headphones are for
No SUV's steady spilling mad smoke
All the baller images is just us in the video
Most people that I know is on foot
Living green naturally it's all good
I -Recycle cans and paper goods in my hood, son
No trash mouth 'cause trash is better in a dump

I stopped to get gas at the Citgo
I saw a brother passing by throwing trash out his window
I walked over and I picked it up
It was a Styrofoam cup filled with cigarette butts
What the (uh), he was thug and a litterbug
I'm just trying to be a man that recycling
See we support waste management
And their efforts to prevent waste from piling up on each continent
We separate the paper and elastic
Then do the same with cardboard and plastic
We take glass and bulbs filled with halogen
And put aluminum and tin in a separate bin
My next of kin yeah we heard about it
But we've been letting  friends worry about it
See where were from smog is hovering
So I'm dedicating this verse to helping mother earth to recover
Organically we grow our trees
Flowers blooming, attracting birds and bees
Teach our kids how to plant seeds
And nurture harvest until the season comes
Soil we feed
Soil we feed
Mix the sunshine add some rain
A pinch of loving sow a seed and
The grass can be greener on the other side
The grass can be greener on the other side
And the people go
Ah-ay, Ah-ay, Ah-ay, Ah-ay
Ah-ay, Ah-ay, Ah-ay, Ah-ay

Life is filled with challenges
My boy's kidneys failed man he's on dialysis
3 hours to filter his blood every day
We trying to learn more about the herbal remedies
Get back to the way God meant for it to be
Hanging with my peeps on the stoop being free
Should've listened to the Indians and not the Pilgrims
The world warming up, there's much less chillin'
And yet where I'm from there 's still some convincing
Older folks don't trust the White's intentions
Some think natural living is hocus pocus
But with record high heat waves they taking notice
Mix the sunshine add some rain
A pinch of loving sow a seed and
The grass can be greener on the other side
The grass can be greener on the other side
And the people go
Ah-ay, Ah-ay, Ah-ay, Ah-ay
