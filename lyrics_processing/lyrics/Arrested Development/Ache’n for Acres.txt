Yes, indedy sho-nuff needy
I got the feeling to stretch on out
My children are cryin', my elders are dyin'
And me I'm relyin' on a check for rent
If I gotta be broke then it ain't no joke
I'm moving to the country and buying some land
And I'll be alright if I can rest at night
Knowin' my children got land to stand on
Ache'n for acres plenty of acres
Money spent in rent ain't earning me cent
Ain't gettin no caddy, no Benz, no jeep
Until I got some $ for some land to keep
No more children crying instead they'll be running
Running free and wild in the heat of the sun
Cause once I'm gone I wanna feel strong
That my children will go on, family land and all sayin'

I got some land to stand on no more ache'n for acres
No beggin for leftovers got some space of my own
I got grounds to raise on no more ache'n for acres
No more giving to takers got some land to leave on

No more elders passin' without my kids askin'
Papa who's tombstones are those in the yard
Family gotta stay close all of us gotta stay close
Ache'n for acres for buildin' a nation
Ain't about dependin' on government spendin'
Especially when the government's got a plan of their own
Separate from me, separate from you
Separate from most, in-sync with a few
Ache'n for acres, plenty of acres
My grandpa had 'em all but he lost 'em & he sold 'em
The cities were a growin' and grandpa's getting older
Little did he know that his land was valuable
Got land to stand on then you can stand up
Stand up for your rights as a woman, as a man
Man'o man my choices expand
Ain't got me no money but I got me some land
