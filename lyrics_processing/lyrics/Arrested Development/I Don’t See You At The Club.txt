Yo, are y'all even still doing anything, cause I don't hear y'all, see y'all in these streets
We're always up in the streets. That's where we be at. We be in the streets
Nah, nah, I mean like, is anybody feeling y'all?
I think so. If they're smart
I don't even know what to say to y'all. I don't-- I don't-- you know--

Got the pear trees faking like a dogwood
And thunderstorms in the springtime, it's all good
And rappers killing it in the club, but can we brag now?
Now Black lives just had to die to get a flag down
And my rap is up the map in southside Atlanta
Was just a cell  50 years march in Alabama
Was just at Columbus, Ohio teaching little kids
South ? southwest are teaching sampling
Now gynecologists will do a lot of interviews
And are making some nice figures like a gym will do
And like Sandra Bland, my band be changing lanes
Without a signal at all, now you want us to hang?
You know some things are substantial whether or not financial
And playing us with the other stuff way up on the mantle
So don't try to adjust your radio, don't change your channel
We're taking down the glittering lights and just light a candle

I mean is anybody checking for Arrested Development?

Yeah, I'm seeing marriages dying just like miscarriages
We've been at it 2-0 years changing the narrative
Fathered 2 by 2 kids, plus to add to my parody
We took on a teen in a desperate need of a family
He was jacking cars and some other type of insanity
Playing the role like media says, "This is humanity"
Blacks is getting smoked with police taking the toke
They hate it when we do stand up, and yet they like a joke
The people losing hope to where most of them don't vote
And rap has turned into trap, and dope really means dope
I try not to be someone I don't know
Look into a mirror, is it friend or is it foe?
Or is it both? Should I swim or should I float?
Should I blend in within the scene that fits me most?
Should I live life, try to fight for what I know?
What I know is that my real life starts after the show

Let me live, let me breathe, let me be me
Let me live, let me breathe, let me be me
Let me live, let me breathe, let me be me

Finally consoling from years of mine that was stolen
A sea of creativity coming just like an ocean
I'm falling in love with music as if I drank a potion
My rhyming and my producing has never been more potent
I've overcome my challenge and life has been more in balance
And people want to judge me on everything but my talent
They're saying that I'm old like it's something I can't control
Aging is part of the package deal of having a soul
And what do we know? All you gots to do is play the role
Of living life and just breathing, lines start to recede n'
Things you start to believe in,  that you seeing
Regardless of your hue, it's just common to human beings
You tell me that using strength is wasted on the young
And that everything that you have been in has been wasted on some fun
But I believe that I can have fun until I'm deceased
Just please play this song in the clubs and in the streets
I'm out
He said, "I don't see you at the club"
I said, "I don't see you at the bank"
People gotta live their life and do their thing
Let me live, let me breathe, let me be me
He said, "I don't see you at the club"
I said, "I don't see you at the bank"
People gotta live their life and do their thing
Let me live, let me breathe, let me be me
Let me live, let me breathe, let me be me
Let me live, let me breathe, let me be me
