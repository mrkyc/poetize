Always stopped by the police
Treated like a foreign enemy
Invisible barriers, segregated areas
Deep seeded anger, spoon-fed hatred
Walking time bombs up in my slums
No respect is given so dude is taking some
Four hundred years of we shall overcome
And still not one in that many brothers haven't overcame
Peace,  in the streets
Police turning up major heat
Deferred riches  with no assistance
Girls become women and women become bitches
Look, man, the young boy fixes
Become independent, wanna  the system
At least one hundred and fifty revolves square
Or get squashed by some black snitches

Trauma, trauma, trauma
Living everyday with trauma, trauma, trauma, trauma
Whatever you say to me (You don't know, you don't know)
Whatever you talking about me (You don't know, you don't know)
Whatever they say in the papers (You don't know, you don't know)
And whatever they say is really true (You don't know, you don't know)

America, home of the free
Except that didn't include me
Exceptionalism to describe this system
Truly exceptional that I was resistant
 passage, millions transition
Those that arrive wish they had died swimming
To survive, Africans kept the pride within em
Now they wanna ask where is our pride?
Trauma, how can I begin to describe?
What it feels like to be dead and alive
They never tried, we strived and we still strive
Self-sufficiency for us is to 
Black Wallstreet, Rosewood, huh
Bill Cosby and Michael Jackson, huh
Cops buy burgers for white mass murderers
No protection for us, no one is serving us

Trauma, trauma, trauma
Living everyday with trauma, trauma, trauma, trauma
Whatever you say to me (You don't know, you don't know)
Whatever you talking about me (You don't know, you don't know)
Whatever they say in the papers (You don't know, you don't know)
And whatever they say is really true (You don't know, you don't know)
Trauma, trauma, trauma

I was born on the wrong side of justice
Imitate this but you can't judge this
Like  if you're famous and make mistakes
When you're black and your people feel the same pain
Setback 'cause of one at the top
Black on black crime, when will it ever stop?
Kinda odd putting the blame on the police
When we're killing more of us than the police

Trauma, trauma, trauma
