Mr. Landlord I understand
You have a right to check out yo land cuz it's "yo land"
My family told me you've been peekin in windos
Forcing themto be a little scared keeping curtains closed
I protect my house but on tour
I try to find a home where my people are secure
Your racist views are the views of your own
But please don't let it enter my family zone
Just lettin' you know, I'm not a lil ole' colored boy
That steps off the curb when you walk your walk
So please don't mistake my kindness for blindness
I've known yo game since Columbus came
And if I woulda known how your neck was burnin' red
In your complex I wouldn't of been caught dead
So here's my message from me to you
My space is off limits until we move!
You understand that!
Mr. Landlord step of my yard
Mr. Landlord I have to question
Do you expect me to chill while ou're bumrushin
You thought we were the passive kind well yo're mistakin'
You outta give nuff respect like I'm Jamaican
The point is I feel you endanger my pride
Your racist comments, yhour racist approach I ain't with...
It's bad enough there's kids in there that are strugglin
Finding themselves with out you bringin' racism!
Just to bring peace do I have to get a piece?
And in the break of dawn I guess I'll pray 2 the east
Cuz I'm not the one to get slapped on the cheek
Without my fist curling up to hit you back in yo teeth! Yo

Is what we want not a fight
Waving Confederate flags & gun toting' is your type
You ever heard of Ogune, well soon his spell
Will clear my brain while he clears where I dwell
I call on the natural forces that be..
To help to free me, to free me!
