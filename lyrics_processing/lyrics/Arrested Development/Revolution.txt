(Revolution) (revolution).....

Brothers and sisters
Let me share with you some news
As I sit on my plush couch
Watching the news
There has been a rude awakening
That I have marched until my feet have bled
And I have rioted until they called the feds
What's left
My conscience said
What's left
My conscience said

As I look out my window
I see the little ones
Playing amongst each other
With their waterguns
In pure poverty
Generations of good people
In cycles of poverty
It bothers me, so I ask myself
You might also likeI say, "Are you doing as much as you can for the struggle?" (no)
"Am I doing as much as I can for the struggle? (no)
Then why do I cry when
My people are in trouble (yo)
My ancestors slapped me
In the face and said (go)
Harriet Tubman
Told me to get on up
Marcus Garvey said the negro
You get on up
My brother Malcolm X...
Need I name more?
It ain't like we never
Seen blood before
Come on, let's talk
Revolution, now (revolution)
All my people say (revolution)
All my brothers say (revolution)
All my sisters say (revolution)
All my people say (revolution)
Hey (revolution)
All my people say (revolution)
All my people say (revolution)
I see blood on one
Malcolm as one shot em
I see tears cause now it
Seems that we forgot him
I seen years of people
Searching for solutions
Restitution, excuses
No more, no more confusion!
Come on, come on
Let's talk right, let's talk right
Talk up, talk up, but
Don't talk up all night!
There's got to be action
If you want satisfaction
If not for yourself
For the young ones
(The children)
The U.N., The U.S
We can't allow you
To tell us a kid in the ghetto
Is not as important as
A kid in Bosnia
I ain't with it (uh huh)
Just forget it (no)
You can't even debate
If you don't understand
Our situation (come on)
You don't want us to go
Get a gun now, do you?
You don't like to see
People running around now
Yet and still you wanna
Live like 9-Oh-2-1-Oh
While we scream out
(Yo) freedom
Five grandmothers ago
They erased it
We must acquire a taste for
Something we've never tasted
So, people, let us
Wet our palates (word)
It's either the bullet or the ballot
Come now (whoo)
Revolution now (revolution)
All my people say (revolution)
All my brothers say (revolution)
All my sisters say (revolution)
Hey (revolution)
All my people say (revolution)
Let's talk about a Revolution
All my people say (revolution)
All my people say
Let's talk about a revolution
Hey (revolution)
(Revolution) (revolution)
(Revolution) (revolution)......

Now, see, I understand
What my people have said
They tell me to fight
Fight for the ancestors
Who are dead
