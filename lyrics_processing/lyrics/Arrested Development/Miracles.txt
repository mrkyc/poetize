With a style that was universal
Real and commercial
Heal and immerse you in the waters
Tired of seeing lost black sons and daughters
But in '94 we slipped a notch, no juice over the years
Couldn't piss the pot
Hip hop went insane but ten years later, back in the game
C'mon, push up the faders 'cause we believe in miracles
I believe in miracles, yeah yeah
I believe in you
And Harriet Tubman would tell us
Don't stop, y'all get down, just rock, y'all get down
We're made of more than this
Don't let 'em define us
Don't let 'em confine us
We're warriors
From the underground railroads we sneaked through swamps
To sit VIP in a restaurant
Hill Side projects, get down
North Side project, get down
They give us platinum medallions to cover our hearts
Keep us far away from the most powerful parts of us
'Cause if they keep us looking outside
Then we won't bother looking inside
I'm too old a dude to be scared of flopping
We're from the old school, this is real hip hopping
And we talk about what we see, won't dumb it down
'Cause I ain't around dumb company
We smarter than this
And we can come harder than this
And do a brag rap on the next song on the disc
'Cause right now you know you're all in the midst of miracles
You might also likeI believe in miracles, yeah yeah
I believe in you
B-boy, Filipinos, Asians, Latinos, you feel me as I kick this stee-lo?
Cyphers 'round the world got a knife around the neck of the world
But only demanding respect and girls
What a waste of power, hip hop in the most powerful hour
Like Babel we're building our tower
But we got a chance, while the whole world's under our trance
Who's gonna use it so the folks can advance
'Cause we believe in miracles
I believe, I believe in you, take me higher
I believe in miracles, yeah yeah
