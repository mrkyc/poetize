I performing for a crowd who be dating me as they jam
And rate me for who I was and not rate me for who I am
The last hits that we had was like 20 years in the past
And  they thinking that was our best and our success was just a fad
3 hits 'bout all we had
Despite it, we don't get mad and instead we just change the stats
Every show, every CD making the dollars think again
Hurricane when we came in, living like sink or swim
We swimming since the beginning, the coverage is all on them
But we kept stroking our own way, not lovers of every trend
So we, live stronger; healthier, live longer
Went against the grain just like people that's low carbon
So we doing it, live and direct, you feel how true we is
Eye-witnesses to the beauty of life music, it's
Arrested Development, powerful we influencing
Music and revolution until we see more solutions
Hey, everybody shake your head, shake out the Devil now
Lazarus raising the dead, come out the tombs, child
We're alive now
We're alive now
We're alive now
Living

Every day I rise on a mission
Please forgive me if I mess up
I'm improving, living living
Honey, baby, I'm just human
If the sun shines down on me today
I would try to live in a better way
Please forgive me when I'm 
That's a part of living

The  talks about dying and crack cocaine and the violence
And station saturated with the more music be thriving
People compare and contrast, whatever our beat lacks
Is made up by the mere fact where the only other option
 like I'm an alien 40-plus years and up
Fortifies that something real is the presents that they don't want
But the present don't really get my presence and all my points
Now I think, work, play it and live it with aching joints
They acting like I'm dumb, including my only son
He's 16 acting like that he's doing a 61
It's like as if height equals might in wisdom
He smirks like he knows what I'ma say before I'm done
He just wants to have fun, wanna eat, wanna lay, wanna shop
Wanna look a certain way, wanna chill, he wanna stop
That craziness,  this generation
Is raised with pure laziness; am I further dating us?
I know it, they wanna put in their headphones, escape in a world
They want to get up on their cellphones and be late with little girls
I continue to amount 5 feet 11 inches
It's the last inch is where my digging stops, I don't 
I won't put you to death, I brought you life
Through my sperm and my music, yeah, I brought it twice
So we doing it, live and direct, you feel how true we is
Eye-witnesses to the beauty of life music, it's
Arrested Development, powerful we influencing
Music and revolution until we see more solutions
Everybody hear me out
We are in the here and the now
Living
