What have you been up to?
It's been so long since we heard you on wax
Since the last time, since the last time

It's been 10 years since we rocked stages together
We covered bases together and whether we all agreed or not
20/20 vision is hindsight
And now we got that so we done got back
Some of our soldiers have fallen, so many years of toiling, touring
Tears falling, naw pouring
Jaded from the industries jabs
A little slower like Muhammad Ali but still we able to last
So we go in the studio, it felt new
But yet in a good way, it felt old
Routines we did came back so lucid
We was boosted, we juiced it and came up with some tracks that's stupid
And people responded to 'em
Heads on the blocks ith locks and baggie jeans, the whole scene was fond to 'em
And how we got the labels kissing our hind parts
We desired art and never sold out for the high chart positions

I have been a thousand places
Seen a million faces since the last time
(Since the last time)
I have been a thousand places
Seen a million faces since the last time
(Since the last time)

Many rap groups attempt to latch to
The popular cultures statutes
And thus they detach their roots from the soil that kept them loose
And made what they delivered so true
There's a desert waste land of past artists that's so cruel
Feeling thrown out like Woody in Toy Story 2
And yo we felt that but let me tell you Satan, he dealt that
I think it's time to give him his deck back, come on now

I have been a thousand places
Seen a million faces since the last time
(Since the last time)
I have been a thousand places
Seen a million faces since the last time
(Since the last time)
