What can he do that I can't?
You tell me he sees the good in the world
And I bury my head in my hands
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
What can I do to prepare?
You tell me to brace for the hurricane
'Cause the end of a good thing is here
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Tell me something new

Do you think for yourself or is this your friends
That are doing away with me?
I'll surrender my love for you
It's all I got, but I'll let it go
Try to put my faith in you
And you fucked it all up
Can't seem to tell the truth
But I see right through

Well, you fucked me up, too
You might also like
I see what a thief you've become
You covered your tracks
But the lies resonate through these halls
I'm so alone now
But I'll get by somehow

Tell me something new
So tell me

Do you think for yourself or is this your friends
That are doing away with me?
I'll surrender my love for you
It's all I got, but I'll let it go
Try to put my faith in you
And you fucked it all up
Can't seem to tell the truth
But I see right through

Hoping you'll stay here
Please turn him away, dear
I'll give you my all
I'll pay the consequences
Hoping you'll stay here
Please turn him away, dear
I'll give you my all
I'll pay the consequences
Do you think for yourself or is this your friends
That are doing away with me?
I'll surrender my love for you
It's all I got, but I'll let it go
Try to put my faith in you
And you fucked it all up
Can't seem to tell the truth
But I see right through
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
