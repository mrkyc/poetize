I'm at a war with myself
Stuck between loving you and leaving you like you always do
You know it's true
The cap twists off again
Here we go again
Another night alone
Waiting by the phone
Please come home
Come home
Follow through

Walk away
Swear to God, I'll find a way to hate you
Your mistakes cast you away with all the love I gave you
Save your breath
'Cause there's nothing you can say to me
So walk away
Hope to God, you don't find a way to break me
Someone save me

Are you bored with yourself?
Drunk
And I promise you I'll be leaving you and your pride will too
You know I'm through
The cap twists off again
(Fuck)
Here we go again
Another night alone
Waiting by the phone
Don't come home
Come home
Follow through

Walk away
Swear to God, I'll find a way to hate you
Your mistakes cast you away with all the love I gave you
Save your breath
'Cause there's nothing you can say to me
So walk away
Hope to God you don't find a way to break me
(I just want to forget you)
Someone save me

When you chose to abandon home
And tore apart a family that loved you
We made a promise that I'd let you go
In due time maybe I can forgive you
I just want to forget you

Walk away
Swear to God, I'll find a way to hate you
Your mistakes cast you away with all the love I gave you
Save your breath
'Cause there's nothing you can say to me
So walk away
Hope to God, you don't find a way to break me
(I just want to forget you)
Someone save me
(I just want to forget you)
