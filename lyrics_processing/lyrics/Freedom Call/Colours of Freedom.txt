Keep the faith, keep the flame
Although dark horizons come to bring us pain
Feel the air, feel the breeze
It's just a matter of time, a matter of trust we believe

See a land far beyond
Under darkened skies, lost in foreign hands
We never forget, we never regret
We never complained whatever we had
Open your eyes, no reason to cry
We'll find our way, to find our way of life

Under the colours of freedom
Break the seal of our sins
We never forget, we never regret
And the journey begins
Under the flag of our kingdom
In the garden of endless time
We never will leave, we always believe
In this glorious sign

Mysterious lights, victorious signs
Are spinning around, are dazing our paralyzed minds
Turning the tide, turning the time
Out of the dark right into the light
Open your mind, no reason to cry
To find your way, to find your way of life
You might also like
Under the colours of freedom
Break the seal of our sins
We never forget, we never regret
And the journey begins
Under the flag of our kingdom
In the garden of endless time
We never will leave, we always believe
In the almighty sign

It's just a matter of time (oh)
Or just a matter of faith (oh)
We never forget, we never regret
Raise the flag of the light, the colours of freedom you'll get

We'll never forget, we'll never regret
And the journey begins
Under the flag of our kingdom
In the garden of endless time
We never will leave, we'll always believe
In this glorious sign

Under the colours of freedom
Break the seal of our sins
We never forget, we never regret
And the journey begins
Under the flag of our kingdom
In the garden of endless time
We never will leave, we always believe
