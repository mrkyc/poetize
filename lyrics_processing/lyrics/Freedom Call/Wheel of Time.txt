Lost with fear in the darkness
Out in the cold and the rain
Through thunder, storm and fire
We are one, and one for all
Tearing down the walls inside
A rebellion starts to rise
In times of war, a rebel yell
It's a cry, stand up and fight

Ride out in the silence
In despair of these godless lands
Let us hope and pray for freedom
In the land of the light

Turn up the wheel of our time
The circle of life
Turn it on, turn it on, we are flying
At the speed of light
Turn up the wheel of our time
With power inside
Get it on, get it on, we are rising
To the top of heavens high
You might also like
If you're diving down in your torment
A lake of fallen tears
If the crown of the king is tumbling down
It's time, stand up and fight

Reach out of darkness
To the land of the glorious light
Let us pray for hope and freedom
For a kingdom in the skies

Turn up the wheel of our time
The circle of life
Turn it on, turn it on, we are flying
At the speed of light
Turn up the wheel of our time
With power inside
Get it on, get it on, we are rising
To the top of heavens high

Turn up the wheel of time
The circle of life
Turn up the wheel of time
The circle of life
Turn up the wheel of time
The power inside
Turn up the wheel of time
Turn up the wheel of our time
The circle of life
Turn it on, turn it on, we are flying
At the speed of light
Turn up the wheel of our time
With power inside
Get it on, get it on, we are rising
