Oh Spiritus, oh Sanctus
Adoramus Domine
Te Deum laudamus
Memoriam, gloriam, gloriam
Warriors, immortal knights, we walk our way alone
Eternally, we're born to write the sign of victory
Remember the sign, the sign of our lives (raise the sign)
Return to the sign, the sign on our mind, forever riding free

And the day has come, time to die
Somewhere far beyond
On the stairway to the sky, on the rainbow soaring high
We are born from the sun

In our hands we hold the future, as we live so we will die
Carry on to save mankind
Back to back we stand as one, till the last crusade is done
We are leaving from the night

Call for vengeance, raise your steel
We are the knights on our glory ride
Law defenders, raise your swords
Freedom for us all

Heading for eternal life
