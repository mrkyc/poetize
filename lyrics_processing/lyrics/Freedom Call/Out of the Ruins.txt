No one's got the power to defy the tyranny
One by one they all were gone
Far too many heroes came and went but never won
Everyone has lost his soul forever

They've opened a door
And whispered the spell that was written in stone
They've broken the seal
The word wasn't spoken, since 2.000 years

All heroes lost, the kingdom's gone
I feel the end, it must be done
Courageous, I'm standing tall

Out of the ruins, we rise forever
Into the battle we march together
We are the ones, never lost our faith and our pride
Out of the ruins, we rise forever
Into the battle we march together
It's written in stone, a new king will be born

And out of the shades
A creature is rising to engage the throne
The light disappeared
A warrior is screaming while fighting the demon
You might also like
All heroes lost, the kingdom's gone
I feel the end, it must be done
Courageous, I'm standing tall

Out of the ruins, we rise forever
Into the battle we march together
We are the ones, never lost our faith and our pride
Out of the ruins, we rise forever
Into the battle we march together
It's written in stone, a new king will be born

I feel the end (I feel the end)
Down on my knees (down on my knees)
I pray to God (I pray to God)
Give me the will to carry on
I hear them come (I hear them come)
The battle's near (the battle's near)
I'm gonna die (I'm gonna die)
Is it all real or fantasy? (It it all real or fantasy?)


We're a legion of defenders
Brave at heart and strong
And the flame of hope is with us
We will carry on
All heroes lost, the kingdom's gone
I feel the end, it must be done
Courageous, I'm standing tall

Out of the ruins, we rise forever
Into the battle we march together
We are the ones, never lost our faith and our pride
Out of the ruins, we rise forever
Into the battle we march together
It's written in stone, a new king will be born

Out of the ruins, we rise forever
Into the battle we march together
