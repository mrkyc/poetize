From fear I deny what I've seen in the night
Darkness around me
A Grimm's tale of the truth without fail
A phobia is rising now
All singing, oh, oh
No more we fight, no more we die

I stare in the eye of a storm that is near
Enclosing darkness
An unseen wall, a dungeon of soul
Arising out of silence now
(Demons riding the storm of evil
A world at war, the devil's home)

Ablaze in the distance, a magical sign
In flames arising
Masters of light, heroes of might
The march of giants has begun
(Forces unite, fighting the evil
Masters of light, tear down the wall)

Freedom for all
Here we are, the masters of the light
Darkness will fall
Here we are (hey), here we are (hey)
All singing
You might also like
Oh, A hymn for revolution
Oh, the tunes of war are calling
Master! Master!
(Masters of the light
Masters of the light
Masters of the light)

A lake full of lies under blood-red skies
A war that leads to nowhere
The spirit of hope is reigning the land
The march of giants has begun
(Forces unite, fighting the evil
Masters of light, tear down the wall)

Freedom for all
Here we are, the masters of the light
Darkness will fall
Here we are (hey)
All singing

Oh, A hymn for revolution
Oh, the tunes of war are calling
No more we fight
No more we die
Here we are, the masters of light

Oh, A hymn for revolution
Oh, the tunes of war are calling
No more we fight
No more we die
Here we are, the masters of light
Oh, A hymn for revolution
Oh, the tunes of war are calling
Oh, A hymn for revolution
Oh, the tunes of war are calling

No more we fight...
