Where is the hand that leads us, passing the darkness by?
Who is the one who shows the dragon child to fly?
Where can we find the land where the rainbow can touch the sky?
Who is the one who knows what's right and what's wrong?
Who knows... who knows... time will tell

Beyond
Beyond
Beyond, the world in your mind
Beyond, in the land with the eyes of the world

Long forgotten, all alone, the beauty of this land unknown
Wait for the time to come, enlighten our minds
Fighting for the inner flame, searching for you, called your name
Know how to use the key, my mind can reach the sky

Out of time and out of space, we can find our home
We are living in another world for glory, glory
We turn around and face our destiny

Beyond, the glory of mind
Beyond, the land with the eyes of the world
Beyond, the sign of our time
Beyond, the land with the eyes of the world
You might also like
An ancient wisdom from inside, turning out, shining bright
Shows your Elysium right before your eyes
A castle built by rays of sun, a million minds, but always one
There's no more loneliness, no more fear inside

Creating life has always been a story of two sides
To live your life just to survive, for glory, glory
We turn around and change our destiny

Beyond, the glory of mind
Beyond, the land with the eyes of the world
Beyond, the sign of our time
Beyond, the land with the eyes of the world

In silence, we were waiting, until the wall was fallen
From darkness, into the light
A union to follow, the light replaces shadow
Salvation for our kind
From now until eternity, the world is safe from pain
To free your mind is our destiny

Beyond, the glory of mind
Beyond, the land with the eyes of the world
Beyond, the sign of our time
Beyond
So take the hand that guides you, passing the darkness by
It is the hand that shows the dragon child to fly
Then you will see the land where the rainbow can touch the sky
And now you finally know what's right and what's wrong
Who knows if we'll keep our light
Who knows if we'll keep out the night


Beyond, the glory of mind
Beyond, the land with the eyes of the world
Beyond, the sign of our time
Beyond, the land with the eyes of the world
Beyond, the glory of mind
Beyond, the land with the eyes of the world
Beyond, the sign of our time
