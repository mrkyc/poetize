I wanna be a rockstar
I put my black leather tights on
Up for a motorbike ride
(Motor, motorbike ride, motorcycle ride tonight, oh)
I'm gonna be a rebel
Born to be in the spotlight
Hooked on a six string fight
(Six, six string fight, in a guitar hero night, oh)

Ooh, I'm hanging in a dream of illusions
Ooh, filled with emotions of fame

Here come the rockstars, the night crawlers
Loaded with steel (woah)
The riders, the fighters
The renegades on wheels
Here come the rockstars, the night crawlers
Loaded with steel (woah)
The riders, the fighters
The renegades on wheels

In the rhythm of a back beat
I shred my crazy guitar
Like a heavy metal star
(Heavy, heavy metal star, like a heavy metal star, oh)
My eyes are getting bloodshot
By the battle of the rock gods
I'm a guitar hero nerd
(Guitar, guitar hero nerd, but the best you've ever heard, oh)
You might also like
Caught in a dream of illusions
Welcome in the hall of fame

Here come the rockstars, the night crawlers
Loaded with steel (woah)
The riders, the fighters
The renegades on wheels
Here come the rockstars, the night crawlers
Loaded with steel (woah)
The riders, the fighters
The renegades on wheels

Give all your power and hold on tight
There is no silence on the way
Together riding to an endless time
Forever flying to the sky

To be a rockstar, in a freak show
Loaded with steel
Be a rider, a fighter
Like a wannabe V.I.P
We are rockstars in a freak show
Loaded with steel
We are riders, fighters
We are wannabe V.I.P.'s
Here come the rockstars, the night crawlers
Loaded with steel (woah)
The riders, the fighters
The renegades on wheels
Here come the rockstars, the night crawlers
Loaded with steel (woah)
The riders, the fighters
