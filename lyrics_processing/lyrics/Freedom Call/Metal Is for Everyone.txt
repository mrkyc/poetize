A band of steel eternally, a union of the strong

Bound for pride and victory, the law of right and wrong

Welcome to a metal wonderland, where all is one, unite
Here, vikings, dragons, wise men say, "Raise your hands up high!"
Return to the valley of kings and dragons, hear the warriors calling
Open the gate to a magic dreamland, follow the sign
Follow the flame of victory

Metal is for everyone, stronger than the law
A band of steel eternally, a union of the strong
Metal is for everyone, the sound is made from steel
Bound for pride and victory, the law of right and wrong
'Cause metal is for everyone

All for one and one for all, words of fame and glory
A heavy metal history, the holy book of power
Dive into a world of queens and heroes at the end of the rainbow
Regain the spell of the magic starlight, follow the sign
