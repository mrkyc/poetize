Welcome to a land of time and space, welcome to a world beyond
From where do you come and where do you go, your heart will lead you home
Welcome to a land of time and space, welcome to a world beyond
From where do you come and where do you go, you'll never walk alone

An alliance of stout warriors (glorious, notorious)
Men of honor defend the light (back to back and sanctified)
At midnight, we can hear the call (on the stroke, we stand up tall)
Over the hills you hear from far away (a hymn declares it's judgement day)

Heed the sound of revolution
It guides us home to paradise

Welcome to a land of time and space, welcome to a world beyond
From where do you come and where do you go, you'll never walk alone
Welcome to all and anyone, together we are one
From where do you come, where do you go, your heart will lead you home

For all the ones who crave the promised land (their souls get out of devil's hand)
On wings of angels fly along (find your place in the world beyond)
You might also like
Heed the sound of revolution
It guides us home to paradise

Welcome to a land of time and space, welcome to a world beyond
From where do you come and where do you go, you'll never walk alone
Welcome to all and anyone, together we are one
From where do you come, where do you go, your heart will lead you home


Come and follow us, we enter the gate
Your mind is the golden key
Ride with us on wings of fate
On the wind of empathy
Follow us to the garden of eternal light
The harvest of light has come tonight


Oh, never walk alone (you'll never walk alone)
Oh, to a world beyond
Welcome to a land of time and space, welcome to a world beyond
From where do you come and where do you go, you'll never walk alone
Welcome to all and anyone, together we are one
From where do you come, where do you go, your heart will lead you home
Welcome to a land of time and space, welcome to a world beyond
From where do you come and where do you go, you'll never walk alone
Welcome to all and anyone, together we are one
From where do you come, where do you go, your heart will lead you home

Oh, never walk alone
Oh, to a world beyond (you'll never walk alone)
Oh, we will lead you home (together we are one)
Oh, to a world beyond (From where do you come, where do you go)
Oh, never walk alone
