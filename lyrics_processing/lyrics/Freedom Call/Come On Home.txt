When the night comes up in town
You don't know you're up or down
Oh, no hysteria
Get up, have a perfect time
Let's sing a metal song (metal song)
Let's scream for heavy sound (heavy sound)
Oh, with euphoria
Get up, have a glorious night

And we'll dance
Bang your head or die

Coming home, come on home
Open up your mind, you'll never walk alone
Coming home, come on home
To the place we are longing for
Until the end of time
And we'll dance

Shout out for friends and buddies
Let swing all ladies goodies
Oh, no hysteria
Get up, have a hellish night
Let's play a metal song (metal song)
Let's shout for heavy sound (heavy sound)
Oh, with euphoria
Take off for a crazy flight
You might also like
And we'll dance
Bang your head or die

Coming home, come on home
Open up your mind, you'll never walk alone
Coming home, come on home
To the place we are longing for
Until the end of time

Coming home (come on home)
Oh, coming home, oh
Coming home (come on home)
Coming home (come on home)
Coming home

Coming home, come on home
Open up your mind, you'll never walk alone
Coming home, come on home
To the place we are longing for
Until the end of time
Coming home, come on home
Open up your mind, you'll never walk alone
Coming home, come on home
To the place we are longing for
Until the end of time
And we'll dance
To the place we are longing for
Until the end of time
Coming home, come on home
Open up your mind, you'll never walk alone
Coming home, come on home
To the place we are longing for
Until the end of time
Coming home, come on home
Open up your mind, you'll never walk alone
