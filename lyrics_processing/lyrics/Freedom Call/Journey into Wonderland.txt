As a child you were born, safe from despair
A guardian angel will lead you to care
Return to the light, the innocent world
Salvation is near, for freedom we call

As a trooper you fight, as a hero you'll die
For an army for freedom, courageous in mind
When forces of evil and darkness collide
Give us hope, give us the pride

Bring us back to the light
Where the spirit is high
It's our journey into wonderland
Over and over again

We'll never stop, we all run (oh)
Far away, not alone (oh)
To the place where the eagles fly, on wings we're riding high
Until the time will come (oh)
Anywhere, anyone (oh)
Where the rays of eternal life are shining to the sun
You might also like
See the smile of the devil, the grimace of hell
His finger of evil is leading the spell
Hear the voice of an angel, it's calling for you
Away from the darkness, it's blazing in your soul

Where the spirit is high
Forever and ever again

We'll never stop, we all run (oh)
Far away, not alone (oh)
To the place where the eagles fly, on wings we're riding high
Until the time will come (oh)
Anywhere, anyone (oh)
Where the rays of eternal life are shining to the sun

Bring us back to the light (any time)
Where the spirit is high (so divine)
It's our journey into wonderland
Forever and ever again

We'll never, stop we all run (oh)
Far away, not alone (oh)
To the place where the eagles fly, on wings we're riding high
Until the time will come (oh)
Anywhere, anyone (oh)
Where the rays of eternal life are shining to the sun

Until the time will come (oh)
Anywhere, anyone (oh)
Where the rays of eternal life are shining to the sun
