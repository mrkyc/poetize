Jump and carry on
Ride on for a union of the strong
Raise your hands, hail for everyone
Jump and carry on
Raise your hands, hail for everyone
Jump and carry on

You're gonna be the master of the night
You're gonna be the last one who will die before
The time will change for everyone
It's time for us to fly away
Far to Heaven's gate
And a shining starlight leads our way
Saves us from despair

The kingdom come (oh)
Raise the crown (oh)
Come with us

Jump and carry on
Ride on for a union of the strong
Raise your hands, hail for everyone
Jump and carry on

Calling for the master of our fate
Calling his number or create a sign
Which leads us to eternity
It's time for us to ride away
High up to Heaven's gate
And a shining starlight leads our way
Saves us from despair

The kingdom come (oh)
Raise the crown (oh)
Come with us

Jump and carry on
Ride on for a union of the strong
Raise your hands, hail for everyone
Jump and carry on
For a union of the strong
Raise your hands, hail for everyone
Raise your hands, hail for everyone


For a union, for a union
Raise your hands
For a union, for a union
Hail for everyone
For a union, for a union
Raise your hands
Raise the crown for everyone

Jump and carry on
