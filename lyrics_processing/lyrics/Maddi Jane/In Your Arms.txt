They gonna remember me
I think I know I can
Who says it's hard to | reach
Who's gonna stop me on
The road to succes
I don't know
They tried to break me down
But I'm still on my feet
This city's full of life
So why is it hard to | breathe
Oh why did god create this
World so unfair
I don't know
Sometimes I feel I like I can't
Run, I can't crawl
And sometimes I feel like I
Ain't nothing at all
Life is a journey and fall
You stumble and fall
But I'm okay
When I lie down in your | arms
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
When I lie down in your | arms
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
When I lie down in your | arms
You might also likeI feel like moving back
Sometimes it's hard to | Dream
The life I close is past
It's moving without me
Who doesn't want a
Machine so they can go
Back in time
I don't know
My time went by too fast
There's no one left but me
I've got a nine to five
And it gets the best of me
This is the life I'm gonna
Live to the end
But I'm okay
When I lie down in your | arms
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
When I lie down in your | arms
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
When I lie down in your | arms
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
When I lie down in your | arms
Sometimes I feel I like I can't
Run, I can't crawl
And sometimes I feel like I
Ain't nothing at all
Life is a journey and fall
You stumble and fall
But I'm okay
When I lie down in your | arms
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
When I lie down in your | arms
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
When I lie down in your | arms
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
When I lie down in your | arms
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
