I'm still alive, but I'm barely breathing
Just prayin' to a God, that I don't believe in
Cause I got time, while he got freedom
Cause when a heart breaks, no it don't break even
His best days, were some of my worst
He finally met a girl, who's gonna put him first
While I'm wide awake, he's no trouble sleepin'
Cause when a heart breaks, no it don't break even
What am I gonna do
When the best part of me, was always you
And what am I supposed to say
When I'm all choked up, and you're okay
I'm falling to pieces
I'm falling to pieces
They say bad things happen for a reason
But no wise words gonna stop the bleedin'
Cause he's moved on, while I'm still grieving
Cause when a heart breaks, no it don't break even
What am I gonna do
When the best part of me, was always you
And what am I supposed to say
When I'm all choked up, and you're okay
I'm falling to pieces
I'm falling to pieces
I'm falling to pieces
I'm falling to pieces
You got his heart and my heart and none of the pain
You took your suitcase, and I took the blame
Now I'm tryin' to make sense of what little remains, oh
Cause you left me with no love
And no love to my name
I'm still alive, but I'm barely breathing
Just praying to a God that I don't believe in
Cause I got time, while he got freedom
Cause when a heart breaks, no it don't break even
No it don't break even no
And what am I gonna do
When the best part of me, was always you
And what am I supposed to say
When I'm all choked up, and you're okay
I'm falling to pieces
I'm falling to pieces, yeah yeah yeah
I'm falling to pieces, oh I'm falling to pieces
