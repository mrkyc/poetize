Sit in a cell 24 hrs shit a drive you crazy
Sat my milk carton in toilet cold can drink it later
Still got some mother fuckas owe me I just want the paper
Ain't on me now so don't be in me later
I had enough of the fakers haters an participators
Had to go get me a way up I seen some shit in my way but
I can't say much
Just stay up what they had told me like they wanted better for me
Never knowing where I'm going passing all of those before heem
I could never go with the flow
It's like I'm tryna go up stream  rowing in a boat
More feins morphine clinics an fentanyl
The More shit that you moving nigga the less you talk
Graduated from the streets I done learned a lesson gotta watch out for these devil's tryna rip me of my blessings
Roll up one this just another session
An I can never tell it if they commin asking questions
I was raised in a broken home
I will tell you on a basis if you need to know
Had a rough paper route it wasn't easy for me
Alarm clock right now case you was sleep-in on me
An when it come to my doe it has a greeting for me
I dog hoes but I still know how to treat a woman
Til then I'm searching I'm in need of somethin
Don't want the women in my family ever needing nothing
I'm so close I can hear it sound like it's screamin fo me
You look at me while I'm eating you can see I'm hungry
They see what's real
I thought you never notice
If I really sell it I can say I sold it
That shit ain't new no more it's from the day before
Look in the future what today may hold Lord save our souls
Prolly influenced by every rapper that ever rapped I put my pride aside to tell em that
I had to cut it twice to sell em that I had to cut my vices just to better stack
Can't be a ninja turtle I can't kick it with a rat
An when i hit it from the back girl I love to hear it clap
Some time I feel like ima bear when tryna make it out the trap
If they commin for the pack you had to take em round the back like a crossover
I get the picture never lost focus
Sat in prison I done loss moments
Chose a path an ima walk on it
Speak for myself I don't need nobody to talk of me

Ain't Even Gotta Tell Em That
Imagine That Tho
Can't Even Dwell In The Pass
Teachers Told Me I Wouldn't Sell Track

They  On What I Did For A Passion
Asking These Questions Tryna Cause A Distraction
Some Hard Times , Niggahs Had To Cross Lines
Still Take My Time To See It Thru
From Me To You , You See The Proof
It Ain't No Time To Reminisce ..

But My Mind Still In The Gutta Like Im Thinkin Nasty
Peeping Past Niggahs Getting Faker By The Handshake
I Can't Wait To See Yo Damn Face
All In That Mud Like Im Landscaping

But I Never Waited , Never Graduated
I Was Fascinated , Know My Path Is Greatness
Sad To Say Niggahs Don't Pass Away Where Im From
Its Just Yellow Tapes , & Ya Never Safe
And At An Early Age , Niggahs Had Pistols
Was Down To Send Niggahs To Them Pearly Gates
