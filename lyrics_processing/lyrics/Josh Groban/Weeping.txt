I knew a man who lived in fear
It was huge, it was angry, it was drawing near
Behind his house, a secret place
Was the shadow of the demon he could never face

He built a wall of steel and flame
And men with guns to keep it tame
Then standing back, he made it plain
That the nightmare would never ever rise again
But the fear and the fire and the guns remain

It doesn't matter now, it's over anyhow
He tells the world that it's sleeping
But as the night came round
I heard it slowly sound
It wasn't roaring, it was weeping (It wasn't roaring, it was weeping)
It wasn't roaring, it was weeping

And then one day the neighbors came
They were curious to know about the smoke and flame
They stood around outside the wall
But of course there was nothing to be heard at all
You might also like
"My friends," he said, "We've reached our goal
The threat is under firm control
As long as peace and order reign
I'll be damned, if I can see a reason to explain
Why the fear, and the fire and the guns remain?"

It doesn't matter now, it's over anyhow
He tells the world that it's sleeping
But as the night came round
I heard it slowly sound
It wasn't roaring, it was weeping
It wasn't roaring, it was weeping

Say ah, say ah, say ah! (Say ah!)
Say ah, say ah, say ah!

It doesn't matter now, it's over anyhow
It doesn't matter now, it's over anyhow

It doesn't matter now, it's over anyhow
He tells the world that it's sleeping, oh
But as the night came round
I heard it slowly sound
It wasn't roaring, it was weeping
It wasn't roaring, it was weeping
Say ah, say ah, say ah!
Say ah, say ah, say ah!
Say ah, say ah, say ah! (Ooh, ooh)
