Hello from my hotel room
A thousand miles away and I am missing you
It's late at night, afraid that I
I might let you down
I'm staring at an empty page
Trying to write the things I didn't say to you
And we move so fast, the words get lost
But I hope that you know that

You deserve a symphony
Soaring strings and tympani
But all I have's this melody
Written from my heart
It's a simple song and the words don't rhyme
No poetry between the lines
Our symphony will come in time
But all I need to know tonight
Is that you're still mine

Another sun another moon
Can't look you in the eye and say I'll be home soon
You've been so good and strong for me
Standing by my side
You might also likeI'm out here chasing the dream
Living up to all that I'm supposed to be
Missing out on the one
Who means the most to me 'cause

You deserve a symphony
Soaring strings and tympani
But all I have's this melody
Written from my heart
It's a simple song and the words don't rhyme
No poetry between the lines
Our symphony will come in time
But all I need to know tonight

Is that you feel me with you
Even while I'm gone
And that you're holding on
'Cause you and I belong
If I could send you all the love I have inside
It's in every note I sing
It's in every word I write

'Cause you deserve a symphony
Soaring strings and tympani
But all I have's this melody
That's written from my heart
It's a simple song and the words don't rhyme
No poetry between the lines
Our symphony will come in time
But all I need to know tonight
Is you're still mine
