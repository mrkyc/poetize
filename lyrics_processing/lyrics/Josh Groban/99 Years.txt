Boy meets girl and the world stops turning
She makes him forget all the rules he was learning
They give a toast to the ones who never stop hoping
With not much to lean on and eyes wide open
And they look up high and wonder what the future's gonna hold

Will we look back down on 99 years of a wonderful life?
Where we laughed till we cried and our love grew stronger with every fight
There'll be a thousand moments for you to say "I told you"
And a million more for us to say "I love you"
So let's look forward to you and I looking back
At 99 years like that, at 99 years like that

They build a house of love in the face of worry
But life has a way of rewriting the story
There were times when it looked like nothing could save them
And there were times when it looked like nothing could break them
They keep promising each other what the future's gonna hold

Will we look back down on 99 years of a wonderful life?
Where we laughed and we cried and our love grew stronger with every fight
There'll be a thousand moments for you to say "I told you"
And a million more for us to say "I love you"
So let's look forward to you and I looking back
To 99 years
You might also like
Of nothing unspoken
Live every day hoping
That when we feel broken
Our scars make us golden
Still choose you and I

Will we look back down on 99 years of a wonderful life?
Where we laughed till we cried and our love was stronger with every fight
There'll be a thousand moments for you to say "I told you"
And a million more for us to say "I love you"
So let's look forward to you and I looking back
At 99 years like that
Oh, at 99 years like that
