If it happened it was meant to be
Offer me a free lobotomy
Got to be sedated to be seen
On the cover of your magazine
(Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
If it happened it was meant to be
Got me a lobotomy for free
Now, I'm so sedated and serene
On the cover of your magazine
(Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)

Oh, and I suppose I brought it all upon myself
Starting with the question no one wants to ask themselves
Naked in the movie, make me the director's pet
Everybody told me 'take whatever you can get'
Everybody told me 'take whatever you can get'

Holding off your freedom of speech
Rage against the dying of the light
Why you never say what you mean?
Rage against the dying of the light
Baby, you'll be safe with me
Rage against the dying of the light
Holding up a tattered dream
Rage against the dying, rage against the dying of the light

Oh, and I suppose I brought it all upon myself
Knowing all the questions no one wants to ask themselves
Naked in the movie, make her the director's pet
Your mother and your father wanna see you on the TV set
Everybody told her 'take whatever you can get'
