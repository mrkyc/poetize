Grrt, boy
Boy
Yo

So lil' boy tell me where ya shooters at
Shoot then when shoot it back
Literally do the maths
I was outside wit my handy
Parked by Tangee
Me or Spangy the opps can't stand me
Cos I make corn run through his flats
Corn jus blew his hat
Bros tryna kill ****
And make alla them yutes want **** back
016 that was me wit my truey hat
Lil' bro why you go do him that
We had the dots in the garden parked off, Klap jus barked off
Opps come Nizz sent them back out the Farm blocks, ring like alarm clocks
Suttin got hit by the, he was shocked wen the car stopped
Bucked into AB, Bands went crazy
He's driving, I know that his heart stopped
Cali not Stardawg, strapped in the car wash
Bands in a Bentley truck and the cars off
Yo, say the wrong word I'll shoot or cheff him up
Corn garn him up, blood gon mess him up, doctors dress him up
We put ya mans in the air go get him blud
So when you chill over there, expect to run, lil' bros extra dumb
Yardie dance got one in the head catch one in your head so don't forget your gun
Bring a extra one, hollows bless the punk
Yo, .32s, .38s I got ten in my gun
Get me mad and I rise up my Makarov
Jump out, slap it off, have man dashing off
Run with his vest, headshot I'll pack him off
Brodie was wanted murder, gripped on his burna, went TP started slapping off
How many guns have we had? We had a lot
Still got pistols to lurk pon a back a block
Yo, Said she love gunmen so hide all our gunsdem
Mask on my face when I walk in the function
Feeling like Markie, back in 09, ting on my waist tryna Clapham no Junction
Cause destruction for alla dese punksdem
Civi got his cos he cause he caused obstruction
(Tell my young boy's going straight to back to induction
Told him hit Bradz he followed instructions)
Ramz just left man miserable
S on his pinnacle, anti and digital
Broadwater gang-way, Nizzy original
Izzy gets busy
Try blend in your car you're still visible
Gunsmoke typical
F wit the boy, my boy he's wit it all
Shawtay you need to leave him cah your wit a fool
Need a Rayzer not my darg from Liverpool

Potta done marvin, had gang laughing
Had to wet him up cos the dots weren't barkin'

Bug shot a man couldn't dare drive past him
For anyone asking, we the ones pulling up, blacked out hoodies up
Firearms over there dischargin'
Akz won't miss he'll blast him
Better do high knees and be on fast ting
Pretty bitch, wet pussy, she bad ahlie
Let man analyse, blow her back tonight
Waps I fantasise, get man mad and I
Will step round there and tan a guy
React quick like Dan and Kaz
How you the man and brass? You need to maximise
Cos if your bad on Snap, you better back your chat
Cos if I back my wap, I need some alibis
Put her in the  we ain't going to eat
I'm taking her straight to the Nizz
Say "Hello" to the gang

Twenty gyal on the Nizz
They love gang 'cah we're caking it in
I still roll wit a, taking a risk
I ain't taking a diss are you silly?
