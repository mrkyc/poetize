M1 on the beat
Bandz (brr)
Yo, one two five no three-oh
In July make it fry no Leo
With the glee make it sign like Ne-Yo (neoh, neoh)
Yo, one two five no three-oh

My bro said he's gonna hit this lick
And then fly out to DXB (DXB)
And put his phone on DND
Half of these niggas wanna be like me
Big man ting, that's BMT
My lil bro has been in the fields like Blacka
He wanna shoot guns like BMB
She wanna come to the crib
Take her to the BNB
Handgun I ain't doing no fighting
I ain't on that TNT
I see man posted with his missus
Til I come and TMG
Had light in the dark
Why you think i was giving out three-on-threes
Bad breed from young
I was just trynna be like Ingz and Kermit
Opp boys can't cut through, heard it
Can't park here you ain't got no permit
They run from the kid like they're all allergic on purpose (on purpose)
I'm sick in my head (i know)
My opps dripping in red (i know)
She wanna come to my show (i know)
She wanna sit front row (i know)
Most my opps ain't on smoke
Most of them got smoked
This ain't no joke (i know)
I got to driving a boat
You wanna dance with the pole
Bro let it go you know (i know)
Moncler with no fur
But I got myself the goose with the fur
-  got dropped,but i can't say his name so i blurred
Bro's looking at me, should he clart it
Got me looking at bro like durr (obviously)
Catch you with your miss, I'm not going to lie
Im doing up you and her
My old days with my rambo
Nowadays mans stay with my new tool
Opps come through and get shot
My bro let it pop, they cut as usual
My block ain't safe
They know we dont play
U can see it on google
I'm with  in a , we got the same opps
So i guess we are mutual
RS4 with the roof down (roof, roof)
My young g trying to move like he's ready
I tell him he ain't ready for no shoot out
 back with the dotz
AKZ in the car with the mop
Spinners and locks
I'm sick in my head (i know)
My opps dripping in red (i know)
She wanna come to my show (i know)
She wanna sit front row (i know)
Most my opps ain't on smoke
Most of them got smoked
This ain't no joke (i know)
I got to driving a boat
You wanna dance with the pole
