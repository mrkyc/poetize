Gang shit, OFB, come on, free SJ man, you know how it gets
Come on man
Gang shit
Temporary lock down
Truss me
Come on, free my nigga
Coming back to shut tings down, truss me
Gang shit
Bando, yo
Add a K to the O get blammed
Yo, listen up

Barbies wanna wine and dine
I'm telling them no from time to time
SJ, that's gang, my slime
We was fourteen, throwing up gang signs
Boogie B, I ain't seen him in time
No, my fam told me I should stay from crime
More time I gotta stand on the line for the grind
Got a mash filled up with bine
My aunties still ask if I'm fine
A lot's on my mind but trust me, I'm fine
We hopped out, told Lerkz he's mine
But he got there first so I caught up behind
I'm not a man for Thorpe Park rides
But ask in the ends, man's going on glides
Yo, she wanna do Bonnie and Clyde
Hop off the moped, show man about glides

Who's that brown skin cutie? Yo
Look at her nails on fleek, yo
Slim fit ting drip head to her toe

Baking off with this brown skin hottie
But I might slap it off if I see them
Riding out in this stolen BM
Lz showed you it's the shotgun season
OFB ride out for no reason
Bro splashed him, the guys screaming "leave him"
More time we do drills in the evening
Broad day, I do it anywhere man see them
Bandokay, I'm a boss on my block
Call shots, ring shots at opps
This PR gets wrapped in socks
And the shotty so tall so we chopped it off
We got blessed with a brand new dots
Now I'm prayin' that we find a new link for Glocks
Red light, foot down, don't stop
Keep my foot on the gas, lay low from cops
I'm in Enfield town, back windows down
'Scuse me Miss, she leng and brown
Skeng on me when I'm rolling 'round
Cah I don't wanna end up dead in the ground
The wheels on the dings go 'round and 'round
Your whole estate gon' hear this sound
Bow, man got corn for clowns
You can call me too if he's there about
