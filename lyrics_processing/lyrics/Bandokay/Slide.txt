He ain't making it out
One shot, two shot
(H, beat it up) Bow
(DT5 on the beat)
Bando

Bro put him in the air like he's taking a flight (Ah, god)
He ain't making it right
One shot, two shot, had him saving his life
Always had my rambo when I was raving at night
Caught Dukes slipping, he weren't skating on ice (Slippin', slippin')
Got caught off guard tryna straighten his eyes
Got his head back, yep, boy come back here (Buss it)
When they was here first weren't claiming them guys (Dickheads, dickheads)
Aye, gyal, arch up your back
Gyal, arch up your back, let me slide inside (Ay, ay)
Her ting soaking when I slide inside
Got her leg shaking it's a water slide (Slippin', slippin')
Everyone knows Broadwater slides
Says she loves bad man, tell your daughter hide

I'm running man down, why's he looking like that?
Try to get so far so we took him right back
I never knew broski was gonna juk him like that (Splash)

3238 so we shook him like that
2 eyes open keep looking and clap
Like my bro Mad Max, he love jugging and trap
Shawty bend over, gwarn gooders (Woi)
He's in the air for screaming out Wooders
You ain't even stepped out at opp block purging
Gang lurking tryna junction jookers
Ride all night like the fourseat hookers
Wet, bang let it hot like cookers (Hot)
My broski ain't into the talking
He loves boring he should've worked at the butcher's

Bro put him in the air like he's taking a flight (Dead boy)

I told my friends in jail keep your heads up high (Free 'em)
He got shot now his head's up high (Ha)
She got chat now her chest up high
When I hit it from the side put her legs up high
You know 16 two peds up knives
And know 16, bro cheffed it twice (Ching, ching)
Broadwater Farm some reckless guys
Who use dukies on reckless fights
B put him in the air like he's taking holiday
Sorry, mate, I just made a hundred quid
I'm getting fan love from hundred kids
Show them boy there what hundred is
I'm loyal to Farm, I'm a humble kid
Bring it out, I'll show you this jungle stick (Dutty gun)
Don't stumble, prick, when Freddy Krueger gets the dumpin' quick
This 44 Magnum holds 6 rounds
Drink magnum, now I'm giving her six rounds
Grab her frontal and tell her to switch 'round
I make her buss quick like the glizz when the sticks out (Grr)

Bro put him in the air like he's taking a flight

Caught Dukes slipping, he weren't skating on ice
Got caught off guard tryna straighten his eyes (Woi)
Got his head back, yep, boy come back here
When they was here first weren't claiming them guys (Leg one, leg one)
Aye, gyal, arch up your back
Gyal, arch up your back, let me slide inside
Her ting soaking when I slide inside
Got her leg shakin', it's a water slide (Slippin', slippin')
