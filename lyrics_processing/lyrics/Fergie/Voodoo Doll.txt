I don't have arms
I don't have legs
I don't have any human qualities
(Ooh-ooh, whoa, ooh-ooh, whoa)
(Ooh-ooh, whoa, ooh-ooh, whoa)

The devil comes and I, I try to stall, and I
Soon my subconscious and conscious might start to brawl
And I put up my walls, and I, they begin to fall, as I
This cunning demon takes me as it's voodoo doll, and I

Darkness sets in as the horns start to grow
Suddenly I become somebody I don't know

Whoa, what do I do? (Ooh-ooh, whoa)
This body's a temple of doom
Whoa, what can I say?
To, oh, make all of this go away

I got many different names, but to you, it's all the same
I be the crawling in your skin, I be the reason for your sin
I be the cunning in your charm and I be the needle in your arm
Call me once, might let you go (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
But call me twice and then I'm gonna get ya
You might also like
Mind playing tricks on me
I'm paranoid, homie
Nobody know swhat I'm going through
God, I'm so lonely
I know I'm losin' it
I'm hearin', whisperin'
Somebody's watchin' me, clockin' me
Hear my heart ticking

Worshiping two Gods can get you in deep
Crystal ball show you things you're not supposed to see

Whoa, what do I do? (Do, ooh-ooh, whoa)
This body's a temple of doom
Whoa, what can I say? (I'm so nervous)
To, ooh-ooh, whoa, make all of this go away

You know I'm coming for ya, you see I'm comin' for ya
You know I'm gonna get ya, I said, "I'm gonna get ya"
You know I'm coming for ya, you see, I'm comin' for ya
You know I'm gonna get ya, I said, "I'm gonna get ya"
You know I'm coming for ya, you see, I'm comin' for ya
You know I'm gonna get ya, I said, "I'm gonna get ya"
You know I'm coming for ya, you see, I'm comin' for ya
You know I'm gonna get ya, I said, "I'm gonna get ya"
You know I'm coming for ya, you see, I'm comin' for ya
