The time is 8:03 PM
Don't know what day it is
(The time is)
What's going on?
(The time is)
Mmm
(The time is)
Is this real?
(The, the, the, the time)
(The time is)
No-no
No-no-no-no
Ah-ah

I woke up short of breath
But still, I've got a long day ahead of me
I don't know what day it is
But tell me, 'cause I gotta know who to be
Is that me up in the mirror?
'Cause I thought it was somebody else
Well, it's a, a realization when you find out
You don't even wanna look at yourself

Where do I go?
What do I do?
Who do I turn to?
I'm losing my ground
Who am I now?
Where does it end?
How did it all begin?
I'm losing my ground

Ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, oh, yeah

Well, I'm on my feet
It's time to hit the streets
And get my life back together again
Well, this place is all a masquerade
So tell me, where in line can I cut in?
Downtown wandering aimlessly around
Still don't know what I'm trying to find
Well, you could flash all the pretty lights in front of me
I still wouldn't see the sign

Where do I go?
What do I do?
Who do I turn to?
I'm losing my ground
Who am I now?
Where does it end?
How did it all begin?
I'm losing my ground
Ground
I'm losing my, I'm losing my
I'm losing my ground, ooh

Ba-da-da-da-da-da
Ba-da-da-da-da-da
Ba-da-da-da-da-da
Ba-da-da-da-da-da (Losing my ground)
Ba-da-da-da-da-da (Losing my ground)
Ba-da-da-da-da-da (Losing my ground)

Oh
Ooh, whoa
Hoo-whoa
Hoo-whoa, oh

Where do I go? (Why do I do this to myself?)
I'm losing my
What do I do?
What do I do?
What do I do?
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
(Don't wanna go back there) Where do I go?
(Don't wanna go back there) What do I do?
(I hear it coming, hear it coming, hear it coming, hear it coming)
Who do I turn to? (And I don't wanna go back)
I'm losing my ground (Don't wanna go back there)
Who am I now? (Don't wanna go back there)
Where does it end?
(I hear it coming, hear it coming, hear it coming, hear it coming) How did it all begin?
(And I don't wanna go back) I'm losing my ground

Ground
I'm losing my, I'm losing my
I'm losing my ground
Ooh!
