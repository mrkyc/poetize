If you're asking me, what's my destiny
Baby, play this record 'cause I want you to see
See all my hopes and dreams when I'll be dancin'
When I'm by myself, with no one else
I play this record and jump out of my shell
And live my hopes and dreams when I'll be dancin'

Nobody's got the perfect rhymes
The perfect step, the perfect lines
So what? We keep it rocking, eh
Nobody's stopping for this
You take a bow, the final show
You leave 'em clapping when you go, through that
Whatever happens, eh
It doesn't matter for shit, no, yo

'Cause nobody knows where we're gonna go
Long as they play the music I, I keep on dancin' to this
Yeah, check it
With a drink in my hand, a drink in my hand
I'm doin' my dance, I'm doin' my dance
The beat in my hair
I'm doin' my step
And I'm dreamin', dreamin', dreamin'

If you're asking me, what's my destiny
Baby, play this record 'cause I want you to see
See all my hopes and dreams when I'll be dancin'
When I'm by myself, with no one else
I play this record and jump out of my shell
And live my hopes and dreams when I'll be dancin'

They tell you lies, a losing game
A dead-end road with nothing to gain, fuck that!
Long as we're ticking
Might as well go out with a bang, bang, bang

'Cause nobody knows where we're gonna go
Long as they play the music I, I keep on dancin' to this
Yeah, check it
With a drink in my hand, a drink in my hand
A drink in my hand, a drink in my hand
The beat in my hair
I'm doin' my step
And I'm drinkin', drinkin', drinkin'

If you're asking me, what's my destiny
Baby, play this record 'cause I want you to see
See all my hopes and dreams when I'll be dancin'
When I'm by myself, with no one else
I play this record and jump out of my shell
And live my hopes and dreams when I'll be dancin'
