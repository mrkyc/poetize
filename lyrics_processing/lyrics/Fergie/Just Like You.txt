I ain't sayin' it ain't beautiful, but it used to be
Who is this right here? She don't look like me
I was sleepin' with a demon every night in my bedroom
I guess you are who you keep, a reflection of me
That I don't wanna be, no

Oops, look what you made me do
I'm crazy just like you, I'm tainted just like you
Table set for two, look what you made me prove
I'm crazy just like you, I'm tainted just like you
Just like you
Just like you, ooh

I don't know if you remember what you did to me, uh
'Cause I can't forget, I see it in my dreams
I been livin' in a nightmare, all the shit you put me through, yeah
Tried to break me to pieces, a piece of my life that I don't really need, no

Oops, look what you made me do
I'm crazy just like you, I'm tainted just like you
Table set for two, look what you made me prove
I'm crazy just like you, I'm tainted just like you
Just like you
Ooh
You might also like
Lone girl, I don't ever wanna go back
Thought it was forever, you should know that
Haunted 'til I finally figured out your game, eh
Take a picture in your mind, it's a throwback
Done twisted up my life, you should bow that
Don't be trippin' on my shadow as I walk away, eh

Oops, look what you made me do
I'm crazy just like you, I'm tainted just like you
Table set for two, look what you made me bruise
I'm crazy just like you, I'm tainted just like you
Just like you
Just like you, ooh
