Da da da da, da da da da
Your pedestal is falling down, falling down, falling down
Your pedestal is falling down
Da da da da da, da da da da da (Ooh, ooh)

Record sales are on the mark
'Cause that's about the time the rumors start
Where all the people talkin' out of they ass
Well, someone's gotta school ya, 'cause ya got no class
Well, I've paid my dues, I'm a seasoned dame
So why you gotta throw salt in my game?
You hide behind the computer screen so that you don't have to be seen
How could a person be so mean?

Who are you, and what do you do?
That makes you think you're above me
But have you walked in my shoes?
The pedestal you put yourself on
Well, since I'm breaking it down now
It's gonna collapse and be gone, gone
(Gone, gone, gone)
(Gone, gone, gone, gone)

Probably one of them tag a longs
Down for the free t-shirt 'cause you're a hanger on
You think you got me figured out
Never met me, have no clue what I'm about
Maybe I got things you wish you had
You need to stop the hating, get a pen and pad
I work around the clock, so fill your mouth up with a sock
And get you head up off your jock

Tell me who you are and what your background is
Tell me how you're feeling when you listen to this (Ooh-ooh)

Who are you, and what do you do?
That makes you think you're above me
But have you walked in my shoes?
The pedestal you put yourself on
Well, since I'm breaking it down now
It's gonna collapse and be gone, gone

Your pedestal is falling down, falling down, falling down
Your pedestal is falling down
Dum dum, dum dum
Your pedestal is falling down, falling down, falling down
Your pedestal is falling down
Da da da da da, da da da da da
Tell me who you are and what your background is
Tell me how you're feeling when you listen to this
You think I don't see you on the internet
I read it, don't think I won't forget (Ooh, ooh)

Who are you, and what do you do?
That makes you think you're above me
But have you walked in my shoes?
The pedestal you put yourself on
Well, since I'm breaking it down now
It's gonna collapse and be gone, gone
Who are you, and what do you do?
That makes you think you're above me
But have you walked in my shoes?
The pedestal you put yourself on
Well, since I'm breaking it down now
