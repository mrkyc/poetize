Big Girls Don't Cry

Ring, ring, who's callin'? That's my baby girl on the phone (Girl on the phone)
She says she needs some space and she wanna leave me alone
(Leave me alone)
But I ain't trippin' 'cause she say that ain't in the wrong
That's just the way life goes (Let's go)
Yeah, me know, big girls don't cry, but please let me explain (Let me explain)
Let's sit down, work things out, before you go on your ways (Go on your ways)
See, I got a lot of things on my mind and I know you're feelin' the same
'Cause the situation's out of control, yeah

I hope you know, I hope you know
That this has nothing to do with you
I'm feelin' blue, let's work things out
'Cause I don't know what to do
And I'm gonna miss you like a child misses their blanket
But I've got to get a move on with my life
That's just the way it has to go
Big girls don't cry
Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry
One, two, three, four
You might also like
The smell of your skin lingers (Lingers) on me now
You're probably on your flight back to your hometown (Hometown)
I need some shelter of my own protection, baby (Baby, come on)
Be with myself and center clarity, peace, serenity

I hope you know, I hope you know
That this has nothing to do with you
I'm feelin' blue, let's work things out
'Cause I don't know what to do
And I'm gonna miss you like a child misses their blanket
But I've got to get a move on with my life
That's just the way it has to go
And big girls don't cry

What should I do? I'm missin' you and I feel so down
Now that you're gone, I can't go on, this must be the end

I hope you know, I hope you know
That this has nothing to do with you
I'm feelin' blue, let's work things out
'Cause I don't know what to do
And I'm gonna miss you like a child misses their blanket
But I've got to get a move on with my life
That's just the way it has to go
And big girls don't cry
