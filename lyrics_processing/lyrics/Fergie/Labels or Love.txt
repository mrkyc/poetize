Shopping for labels, shopping for love
Manolo and Louis, it's all I'm thinking of
Shopping for labels, shopping for love (One, two)
Manolo and Louis, it's all I'm thinking of (One, two, three, turn the lights on)

I already know what my addiction is (Addiction is)
I be looking for labels, I ain't looking for love
I shop for purses while love walks out the door (Out the door)
Don't cry, buy a bag and get over it
And I'm not concerned with all the politics (Politics)
It's a lot of men, I know I could find another
All I know is that I'm always happy when I walk out the store
(Store, store)

I guess I'm Supercalifragi-sexy
Nothing to be playing with
I love him, hate him, kiss him, diss him
Try to walk a mile in my kicks

Love's like a runway, but which one do I love more?
No emotional baggage, just big bags filled with Dior (Oh)
Love's like a runway, so what's all the fussing for?
Let's stop chasing those boys and shop some more
One, two, one, two, three, turn the lights on
You might also like
I know I might come off as negative (Negative)
I be looking for labels, I ain't looking for love
But relationships are often so hard to tame (So hard to tame)
A Prada dress has never broke my heart before
And ballin's something that I'm fed up with
I'ma do the damn thing, watch me do the damn thing
'Cause I know (Know) that my credit card will help me put out the flames
(Flames, flames)

I guess I'm Supercalifragi-sexy
Nothing to be playing with
I love him, hate him, kiss him, diss him
Try to walk a mile in my kicks

Love's like a runway, but which one do I love more?
No emotional baggage, just big bags filled with Dior (Oh)
Love's like a runway, so what's all the fussing for?
Let's stop chasing those boys and shop some more
One, two, one, two, three, turn the lights on

Gucci, Fendi, Prada purses, purchasing them finer things
Men, they come a dime a dozen, just give me them diamond rings
I'm into a lot of bling, Cadillac, Chanel and Coach
Fellas boast, but they can't really handle my female approach
Buying things is hard to say, rocking Christian Audigier
Manolo or Polo, taking photos in my Cartier
So we can go all the way, I know you might hate it, but
I'ma shop for labels while them ladies lay and wait for love, oh
Love's like a runway, but which one do I love more?
No emotional baggage, just big bags filled with Dior (Oh)
Love's like a runway, so what's all the fussing for?
Let's stop chasing those boys and shop some more
One, two, one, two, three, turn the lights on

Shopping for labels, shopping for love
Manolo and Louis, it's all I'm thinking of
Shopping for labels, shopping for love (One, two)
