You know you've been on my mind (Yeah)
It's like I can't stop thinking about you
You know, whenever I'm around you, I get clumsy, that's right
But right about now, I wanna get rough

First time that I saw your eyes
Boy, you looked right through me, mm-mm
Played it cool, but I knew you knew
That cupid hit me, mm-mm

You got me trippin' (Oh), stumblin' (Oh), flippin' (Oh), fumblin'
So clumsy 'cause I'm fallin' in love (In - in, love - love)
You got me slippin' (Oh), tumblin' (Oh), sinkin' (Oh), crumblin'
So clumsy 'cause I'm fallin' in love (In - in, love - love)
So in love with you
Oh, baby (Oh, baby)
Oh, no (Oh, baby)
No how (Oh, baby)
