Yeah, yeah
I know, I know (Yeah), it's true, it's true

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, it's true
My, my, my, my, my love is true
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, it's true
My, my, my, my, my love is true
Huh-huh-huh, hu-uh, I know this much is true
Huh-huh-huh, hu-uh, I know this much is true

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, it's true
My, my, my, my, my love is true
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, it's true

So true, funny how it seems
Always in time, but never in line for dreams
Head over heels when toe to toe
This is the sound of my soul, this is the sound

I know you love the way my love is soundin'
From over there, you could feel my heart poundin'
Let me swim in you, I don't mind drownin'
Forever I'll be upside down frownin'
I love you uptown, love you downtownin'
You could be my woman, and I could be your main man (Uh-huh)
And that's why I sat down and wrote this poem
'Cause I want the truth to be told
You might also like
Boy, you know I know that is true
Huh-huh-huh, hu-uh, I know this much is true
Huh-huh-huh, hu-uh, I know this much is true

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, it's true
My, my, my, my, my love is true
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, it's true

With a thrill in my head and a pill on my tongue
Dissolve the nerves that just begun
Listening to Marvin (All night long)
This is the sound of my soul, this is the sound (Yo)

I like the way your soul sounds to me
Ain't nobody doing me the way you do me (Uh-uh)
I got the stamina for L-O-V-E
Whip out the camera, let's make a movie
In the future, we could look back at what we done did
We'll be makin' love 'til we like a hundred
And that's why I had to remix this song
'Cause I want the truth to be told
Boy, you know I know that is true
Huh-huh-huh, hu-uh, I know this much is true (Is true, is true)
Huh-huh-huh, hu-uh, I know this much is true (I know, I know, it's true, it's true)

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, it's true
My, my, my, my, my love is true

You know it's true
You know it's true
You know I love you, girl (You know it's true)
I know, I know, I know this much is true
You know it's true
You know it's true
I know you love me, girl
You know it's true
I know, I know, I know this much is true
You know it's true (Yeah)
You know it's true
This much is true
This much is true
You know I love you, girl
I know you love me, girl
You know it's true
