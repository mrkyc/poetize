Mmm
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da

Every day when I wake up
Tryna read my fortune on the bottom of my coffee cup
But it seems like I never finish
It's always half full (Or is it half empty?)
Maybe it's my own superstition or a kind of self protection
If it all looks bad, why would I wanna look ahead?
Oh, oh, oh, still sittin' here
Just watching the sun go down (Down), down (Down), down

Life goes on with or without you
It's up to you what you gonna do
You could go or you could stay
Who cares anyway?
Life goes on with or without you
Damn it, baby, what you gonna do?
You could go or you could stay
But who cares anyway?
(Haha, yeah, who really cares?)

Every conversation gets me high on motivation
Gets me craving of your own familiar situation (Yeah)
Reach the unreachable, achieve the unbelievable
In the midst of all the madness (Remember life's beautiful)
Still, I'm feeling restless, thinking I should rest less
Work more, play hard, ready for the encore
Is this the kinda life I really wanna live for? (Two times)
In my heart I know, less is more (More)
More (More), more, more, more

But who cares anyway?

Starting to think it's out of my hands
Is it all gonna be worth it in the end?
'Cause it's safe here in my comfort zone
Never stray too far from home (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
But then again, this way I'll never know, never know
Maybe I should go

Go crazy, go insane, go for everything
Get the money, dollar bills in your wallet, say ka-ching
Sign the dealy, make a mili, sound famili?, uh
The urgency is sounding the drilly for the ma-milli, uh
And then they really talk in Braille, actin' chilly
They got me feelin' like an achilles, silly, silly, I mean, really?
Really, really? Really, really though?
Really, really, really though?
Feel the vibration of the higher ground
Love always leads to the highest sound
Many conversations, people makin' speculations
As to my procrastination due to my revelations
And then they get fugazi
You call yourself a rider
You need to speed your loyalty up like Bugatti
Baby, don't underestimate my underdog mentality
We 'bout to race ahead, ambition on Ferrari
Life goes on with or without you
It's up to you what you're gonna do
You could go or you could stay
Who cares anyway?
Life goes on with or without you
Damn it, baby, what you gonna do?
You could go or you could stay
But who cares anyway?
Who cares anyway?

You could go or you could stay
Mmm, mmm
You could go, you could stay
