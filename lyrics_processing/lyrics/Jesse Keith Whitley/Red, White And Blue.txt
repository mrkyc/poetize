We don't have no plastic L.A. friends
Ain't on the edge of no popular trend
Ain't never seen the inside of that magazine GQ
We don't care if you're a lawyer, or a Texas oil man
Or some waitress busting ass in some liquor stand
If you got soul, we hang out with people just like you

My hair's turnin' white, my neck's always been red, my collar's still blue
We've always been here just tryna sing the truth to you
Yea, you could say that we've always been, red, white, and blue

Ride our own bikes to Sturgis, we pay our own dues
Smokin' Camels and drinkin' domestic brews
If you wanna know where I've been, just look at my hands
I've driven by the White House and spent some time in jail
Momma cried but she still wouldn't pay my bail
I ain't been no angel, but even God, He understands

Well my hair's turnin' white, my neck's always been red, my collar's still blue
We've always been here just tryna sing the truth to you
Yea, you could say that we've always been, red, white, and blue
Yeah, that's right

My daddy worked hard, and so have I
We paid our taxes and gave our lives
To serve this great country
What are they complainin' about?
Yeah, we love our families, we love our kids
You know it's love that makes us all so rich
That's where we're at, if they don't like it they can just
Get the hell out

Well my hair's turnin' white, my neck's always been red, my collar's still blue
We've always been here just tryna sing the truth to you
Woah, yeah
Well my hair's turnin' white, my neck's always been red, my collar's still blue
We've always been here just tryna sing the truth to you
Yea, you could say (You can say) that we've always been, red, white, and blue
