Hey, boy, I really love the way that you move
You wind me up, up, up on you
You know I'm down, diggy, diggy down, diggy, diggy down
Down, diggy, diggy down, diggy, diggy down, down, down

Slow down, aye, what you hidin'? Am I invited?
I wanna know, wanna know, wanna know, wanna know
Headlights, you wanna night drive? I got my skin tight
You wanna go, wanna go, wanna go, wanna go

No one has to know
It can just be you and me alone
Get yourself a ticket to the show
And I let ya, let ya

Hey, boy, I really love the way that you move
You wind me up, up, up on you
You know I'm down, diggy, diggy down, diggy, diggy down
Down, diggy, diggy down, diggy, diggy down
Hey, boy, I really love the way that you move
You wind me up, up, up on you
You know I'm down, diggy, diggy down, diggy, diggy down
Down, diggy, diggy down, diggy, diggy down, down, down

Closer, I wanna know ya, you'll be my soldier
You wanna try, wanna try, wanna try, wanna try
Lights out, we gotta slow down, you wanna know how
We come alive, come alive, come alive, come alive

No one has to know
It can just be you and me alone
Get yourself a ticket to the show
And I let ya, let ya

Hey, boy, I really love the way that you move
You wind me up, up, up on you
You know I'm down, diggy, diggy down, diggy, diggy down
Down, diggy, diggy down, diggy, diggy down
Hey, boy, I really love the way that you move
You wind me up, up, up on you
You know I'm down, diggy, diggy down, diggy, diggy down
