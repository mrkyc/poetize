Sun goes up, everybody move your body
Sun goes up, everybody at the party
Sun goes up, everybody move your body
Sun goes up, come light

Four o'clock in the mornin', time to party
Time to let it out
Wanna dance to the sunlight and I know you
Join me tonight
I wanna feel it, I wanna feel it tonight
I wanna feel it, I wanna feel it so tight

Tell me what a party, tell me where it went
Just wanna keep it goin' 'till four AM
And we are gonna do it, gonna do it all again
Oh, when the sun goes up
Move a little closer, tell me what you like
And come and give it to me, 'cause it feels so right
I gotta do it, gotta do it all again

Sun goes up, everybody move your body
Sun goes up, everybody at the party
Sun goes up, everybody move your body
Sun goes up, come light

I wake up in hazy, it's so crazy
Do it all again
Wanna dance 'till it's over and I need you
Join me tonight
I wanna feel it, I wanna feel it tonight
I wanna feel it, I wanna feel it so tight

Tell me what a party, tell me where it went
Just wanna keep it goin' 'till four AM
And we are gonna do it, gonna do it all again
Oh, when the sun goes up
Move a little closer, tell me what you like
And come and give it to me, 'cause it feels so right
I gotta do it, gotta do it all again

Sun goes up, everybody move your body
Sun goes up, everybody at the party
Sun goes up, everybody move your body
Sun goes up, come light

Tell me what a party, tell me where it went
Just wanna keep it goin' 'till four AM
And we are gonna do it, gonna do it all again
Oh, when the sun goes up
Move a little closer, tell me what you like
And come and give it to me, 'cause it feels so right
I gotta do it, gotta do it all again
Sun goes up, everybody move your body
Sun goes up, everybody at the party
