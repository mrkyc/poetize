What we do? We never tell
My body is going crazy, wild thing
Riding like a carousel
I let your body see it with a bang bang

Step by step, I got you breakin'
Walls up high but Imma pull 'em down
Take that heart and make it vacant, baby
Gotta surrender yourself to the bounce

Hands up, ready for the boom
Never mind the rocket launcher talking 'bout the tune
You can hear us coming with the zoom
Listen to the boom boom, we are breaking through
Hands up, ready for the boom
Never mind the rocket launcher talking 'bout the tune
You can hear us coming with the zoom
Listen to the boom boom, we are breaking through

I know the places where you hide
No matter where you go, boy, you'll be mine
'Cause I believe in you and I
I let your body see with the bang bang
You might also like
Step by step, I got you breakin'
Walls up high but Imma pull 'em down
Take that heart and make it vacant, baby
Gotta surrender yourself to the bounce

Hands up, ready for the boom
Never mind the rocket launcher talking 'bout the tune
You can hear us coming with the zoom
Listen to the boom boom, we are breaking through
Hands up, ready for the boom
Never mind the rocket launcher talking 'bout the tune
You can hear us coming with the zoom
Listen to the boom boom, we are breaking through

No, we don't settle
We're raising the level up higher
No it ain't over
We're giving it all to the fire

Step by step, I got you breakin'
Walls up high but Imma pull 'em down
Take that heart and make it vacant, baby
Gotta surrender yourself to the bounce
Hands up, ready for the boom
Never mind the rocket launcher talking 'bout the tune
You can hear us coming with the zoom
Listen to the boom boom, we are breaking through
Hands up, ready for the boom
Never mind the rocket launcher talking 'bout the tune
You can hear us coming with the zoom
