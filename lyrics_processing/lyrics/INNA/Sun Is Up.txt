All the people tonight
Put your hands in the sky
Come on boy, come and get in the rhythm
Music will take you high
One more feeling about you
I love you, don't know why
Everybody come and get in the rhythm
Music will take you high

Sun is up, move your body
I got moves and all the night I will not sit, yeah
I came up for this party
I will stop when Mr. DJ stops the beat, yeah

Sun is up (Whoa-oh, whoa-oh-oh)
