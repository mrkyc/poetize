(Here come the beat drop)
(Here come the beat...)

All I wanna do is feel your vibe
Keep my body shakin' through the night
When the morning comes, press rewind
Wanna feel that heart drop one more time!

Let me inside and I'll show you all my love
I'll show you all my love, I'll show you all my love
Open your eyes baby, I could be the one
Baby, I could be the one
(Here come the beat drop)

Baby, baby, the bass is like your heartbeat
I can feel it, just look into my eyes
And I'll boom boom bo-roo boom boom
Boom boom bo-roo boom boom
Boom boom bo-roo boom boom
Boom boom bo-roo boom, we go!

(Here come the beat drop)
(Here come the beat...)

Got me feelin' crazy here tonight
Playing hard to get but I don't mind
Searchin' up my beat deep inside
Boy you put my heart on double time

Let me inside and I'll show you all my love
I'll show you all my love, I'll show you all my love
Open your eyes baby, I could be the one
Baby, I could be the one
(Here come the beat drop)

Baby, baby, the bass is like your heartbeat
I can feel it, just look into my eyes
And I'll boom boom bo-roo boom boom
Boom boom bo-roo boom boom
Boom boom bo-roo boom boom
Boom boom bo-roo boom, we go!

(Here come the beat drop)
We go!
(Here come the beat...)
Baby, baby, the bass is like your heartbeat
I can feel it, just look into my eyes
And I'll boom boom bo-roo boom boom
Boom boom bo-roo boom boom
Boom boom bo-roo boom boom
Boom boom bo-roo boom, we go!

(Here come the beat...)
We go!
