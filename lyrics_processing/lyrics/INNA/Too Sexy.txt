This dance floor is a jungle, we're 'bout to go bananas
Me and my chiquitas, me and my chiquitas
Don't tell me about your helicopter, I don't need your bank roll
We got margaritas, we got margaritas

You ain't sayin' nothing, we can do this any time
And we don't need your money 'cause I'm good at spendin' mine
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up, let's begin, all my girls go

I'm too sexy for your love
Too sexy for your love
Too sexy for your
Too sexy

We set it in the fire, but we don't need no agua
This is pura vida, this is pura vida
Baby I'm just a party rocker, this is my anthem
They call me bonita, they call me bonita

You ain't sayin' nothing, we can do this any time
And we don't need your money 'cause I'm good at spendin' mine
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up, let's begin, all my girls go

I'm too sexy for your love
Too sexy for your love
Too sexy for your
