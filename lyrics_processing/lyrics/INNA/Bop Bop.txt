(Let's go)

Woke up Mexico
Tan lines, here we go
Gin fizz in my glass
Shake, shake, shaky, shake the shack
We meet all the cats
New scene fade to black
Bop bop, bop, b-bop
Bop bop, bop, b-bop

Milkshakes on the rack
They're dancing in the street
Hands up holler back
And come on dance with me
Hot hands on your hips
And work it baby please
One kiss on the lips
It's summer by the sea
By the sea, by the sea, by the sea

Wake up, it's time to blend
Everything throw the juices in
Mix it up till it's bubblin'
Now your trippin' of the good
Get you rockin' like an animal
Always ready baby, locked and loaded
Bop bop, bop, b-bop
Bop bop, bop, b-bop

Hands against the wall
Mr. Officer, I don't know nothing
That is the truth
(So how you gonna move?)
Like 1950
(That's cool if that's true)
