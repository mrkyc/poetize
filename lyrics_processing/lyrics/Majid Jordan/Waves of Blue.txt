I wanna hold you close
Don't wanna let you go
Be with you night and day
'Cause I've been feeling so low
Don't have to ask me twice
You really take me there
I wanna touch your light
I wanna breathe in your air

I'll be holding you tight
When the night is through

We'll be riding the tide in the sky, so alive
On waves of blue (Waves of blue)
I'm in love with the thought of being in love, in love with you (Love with you)
You can bring me along for the rest of your life if you wanted to (Wanted to)
We'll be riding the tide in the sky, so alive
On waves of blue (Waves of blue)
I'm in love with the thought of being in love, in love with you (Love with you)
Being in love with you (Love with you)
Being in love with you (Love with you)
On waves of blue (Waves of blue)
You might also like
When the night is young
Tell me something so sweet
Wanna hear your song
Wanna dance to your heartbeat
Don't have to ask me twice
You really take me there
I wanna touch your light
I wanna breathe in your air

I'll be holding you tight
When the night is through

We'll be riding the tide in the sky, so alive
On waves of blue (Waves of blue)
I'm in love with the thought of being in love, in love with you (Love with you)
You can bring me along for the rest of your life if you wanted to (Wanted to)
We'll be riding the tide in the sky, so alive
On waves of blue (Waves of blue)
I'm in love with the thought of being in love, in love with you (Love with you)
Being in love with you (Love with you)
Being in love with you (Love with you)
On waves of blue (Waves of blue)
Being in love with you (Love with you)
Being in love with you (Love with you)
Being in love with you
On waves of blue (Waves of blue)

You're no good for me, you got what I need
I just wanna be with you
I just wanna be with you, be with you
You're no good for me, you got what I need
I just wanna be with you
I just wanna be with you, be with you (Uh)

I'll be holding you tight
I'll wait this through
Yeah

We'll be riding the tide in the sky, so alive
