Bop ba-da da-da-da da da da-da-da
Ridin', with you
Your body, your body
Your body, your body

Now the times are changing fast
This summer's different than the last
Happiness was all we had
But now the happiness is past
Now the happiness is past
With the only piece of you
It was the only piece I had, babe
So tell me what to do
Tell me what to do

I can't help myself
I can't help myself
I spend the afternoons
Thinking about you
Honey I'm twisted
I got a question
Do you think about me too?
Tell me if you do
You might also like
Oh, start running around thinkin' bout you
Oh, I've been runnin' around thinkin' bout you
Oooh woah, start runnin' around thinkin' bout you
Oh, ridin', ridin'

City in the back, in my lap, got a fat one
Livin' lavish, movin' faster, miss your laughter (babe)
Pocket full of cash, but I can't buy the past time
Wish I had ya, love and leave me
Guess you have to babe

Nothin' left to do, I wish I could ride to you babe
Instead, I'm ridin' round thinkin' bout you
Oooh woah, ridin', ridin'

Oh, there's nothing left to do
Where you wanna take me? 'Cause I will go
Anywhere
As long as you follow me we will be there
Oh, there's nothing left to do (there's nothing left to do)
Where you wanna take me? 'Cause I will go
Anywhere (anywhere)
As long as you follow me we will be there
Oh, start running around thinkin' bout you
Oh, I've been runnin' around thinkin' bout you
Oooh woah
Nothing left to do, I wish I could ride to you babe
Oh, ridin', ridin'

City in the back, in my lap, got a fat one
Living lavish, moving faster, miss your laughter (babe)
Pocket full of cash, but I can't buy the past time
Wish I had ya, love and leave me
Guess you have to babe

Oh, start ridin' round thinking about you
Oh, I've been runnin' round thinkin' bout you

City in the back, in my lap, got a fat one
Livin' lavish, movin' faster, miss your laughter (babe)
Pocket full of cash, but I can't buy the past time
Wish I had ya, love and leave me
Guess you have to babe

If my whole life is like a gutter in the matrix
Cut the basics
Life is good and I wanna taste it (babe)
I know it's been a while but I still think about you naked
Especially when I'm wasted
I just wanna taste your body babe
Your body, your body
Your body, your body
