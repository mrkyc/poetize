Get the Louis from the Louis store straight
Packin' it up, sendin' it to your place
Callin' you up just so I can touch base
I hate how you're so far away
Nobody's perfect, I've made my mistakes
Nobody's perfect, I learned the hard way
I wish you could be here, I miss your embrace
Can't wait to hold you this time
Can't wait, I told you I can't wait
You make me feel like I can't lose
Yeah, that's right I wanna get to you
You're all I believe in
I wanna show you everything
You're my strength, not my weakness
Yeah, your secrets are safe
Just like your heart is
But I'm caught up in L.A. like a movie
Stuck here on replay, want you on repeat
