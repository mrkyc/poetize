Diamonds 'round her neck and she's driving me mad
I would take her out if I got the chance
All night long, I think of what to say
I really think she needs someone like me

To take her out for a quick two-step
Something that she ain't seen yet
I really wanna be her man
Someone who understands, someone who understands
I-I-I'm letting loose, I can't wait to see you...

Shake, shake, shake, shake
Shake, shake, shake, shake
Move, move, move, move
Move, move, move, move
Wait, wait, wait, wait
Wait, wait, we've got nothing to lose
Shake, shake, shake, shake
Shake, shake, shake, shake
Move, move, move, move
Move, move, move, move
Wait, wait, wait, wait
Wait, wait, we've got nothing to lose

Diamonds 'round her neck and she's here at last
I need to make a move, I'm taking my chance
All night long, I thought of what to say
I really think she needs someone like me

To take her out for a quick two-step

Listen up, it's my confession, life is never worth stressing
If you have a chance to make it better
Then you've got to take it
And shake, move, yeah, you've got those moves
You got those moves that make me say, "I love you"
I can't wait, I'm coming through, I'm going...
