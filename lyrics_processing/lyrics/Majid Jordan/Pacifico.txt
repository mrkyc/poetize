Speakers in the ceiling (Speakers in the ceiling)
Marble on the floor (Marble on the floor)
Yeah, half of me is happy (Half of me is good)
But half of me wants more (Half of me wants more)
Half of me wants more

So I leave my keys on the counter
And I take the long way home (Take the long way home)
If love is like a sunset (If love goes down)
Then it's been dark for so long
It's been dark here for so long

Pa-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
For so long
Pa-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
For so long
Pa-da-da-da-da-da-da-da

Shadows in the ceiling, mmm
Chasing me all night (Chasing me)
Half of me is ready
Half of me needs time

So I leave my keys on the counter
And I take the long way home (Take the long way home)
Take the long way home
If love is like a sunset (If love goes down)
Then it's been dark for so long
It's been dark here for so long

In another life, in another dream
You're my baby, with you right here
In another love, in another world
It would be the two of us, move now girl
You know, that's how it goes
It's been dark here for so long
