Yeah-yeah, yeah yeah yeah
I love it
I got you, yeah

I got you in my zone baby
I feel you from a mile away-ay
I never was the type to rush
But the difference, it was night and day-ay
And my heart doesn't need too much
And I never speak my mind enough
But I want you to come my way-ay
And I won't let this moment go to waste

Handle with care, never thought I'd see the day
I want you right here, feel my lovin' everywhere, I
Handle with care, never thought I'd see the day
I want you right here, feel my lovin'

All over you (All over you)

Now put your hands around my neck
And I'll show you what I want to say-ay
My heart really needs this love

And I love when you come my way-ay
Yeah I won't let this moment go to waste
