Shots to the chest
No rest
I'm done keeping her up all night
Best of the best
No less
She needs someone who's on her side
Life's going on, no fun
I'm done, acting like you mine
You know I'm not the only one
Second to none, you gone, it's done
I'm acting like it's fine
You know I'm not the only one
Eh, eh, eh
Too far, too far
Oh, oh, oh

Eh, eh, eh
Too far, too far
Oh, oh, oh
Too many times
Eh, eh, eh
Too far, too far
Oh, oh, oh
Too many times
Eh, eh, eh
Too far, too far
Oh, oh, oh
Too many times

Why'd
Why'd you wanna be my
Why'd you wanna be my love?
Why'd you wanna be my
Why'd you wanna be my love?

Why'd you wanna be my
Why'd you wanna be my love?
Why'd you wanna be my
Why'd you wanna be my love?




You call, you say "just let it be"
I can't, I say "you mean too much to me"
It's real, there's no one else I found
I feel, we really need to figure this out
Just you and I
I only wanna find
Whatever makes you smile
I only wanna find
I wanna hear you sing, now
Only wanna make you smile
I only wanna live forever
I only wanna keep things quiet
I only wanna be together
I only wanna make you smile
I only wanna live forever
I only wanna keep things quiet
I only wanna be together

I only wanna be together

I only wanna be together

I only wanna be together

I only wanna be together
