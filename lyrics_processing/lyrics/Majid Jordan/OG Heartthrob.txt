Oh right, I'm thinking it's getting late
I'm running on an hour sleep
I'm 'bout to hit Marina Bay
Someone call the valet
I've got a classic case of OG heartache
And I don't like to wait
Don't make me wait on you, you
Let's get this started
See you changed my life and I won't ever forget it
I'm telling you, you
They all had me wrong except for you, you
I won't let you go

Original heartthrob
Giving me heart problems
I can't take making love to anyone but you
Original heartthrob
You make my body rock
I can't take waking up to anyone but you
Don't make me wait on you, you
Don't make me wait on you, you

At night your aura turns to blue
Your kisses paint me rouge
You got me wide awake riding on your body wave
Lemme know the time and place
Baby I just want a taste
And I don't like to wait
Come with me, we can party in the city
When nobody else is up
'Cause whenever you're with me, there's nobody catching up
No they won't, I won't let you go, I won't let you go
No I won't, they've all got me wrong, they've all got me wrong

I can't take waking up to anyone but you
Don't make me wait on you
Don't make me wait on you

I'm leaving from the commodore
Headed to your front door
Open up and let me in
Have my heart, it's yours
I'm feeling like I'm 25
Girl you got me on a ride
I'm glad that you're on my side

Original heartthrob
Giving me heart problems
I can't take making love to anyone but you
Original heartthrob
You make my body rock
I can't take waking up to anyone but you
I'm in love, I'm in love
