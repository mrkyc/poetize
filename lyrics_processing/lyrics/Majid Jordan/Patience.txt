Ooh yeah
I wanna try, wanna try yeah

It's not your love
It's not for us
It's not our time to give
So I'm not gonna give it up
It's not your trust
It's not for us
It's not our time we give
So I'm not gonna give it up
Oh


It's not your love
It's not for us
It's not our time to give
So I'm not gonna give it up
It's not your love
It's not for us
It's not our time we give
So I'm not gonna give it up
You might also like
You can try to make me believe
But oh, just turn the cheek
Like you did to me

It's not your love
It's not for us
It's not our time to give
'Cause I'm not gonna give it up


Waiting for you
Felt like it would be easy
But it's so hard, oh
Feeling like I would be there
And now I just don't even care
It's so hard, it's so hard

It's not your love
It's not for us
It's not our time to give
'Cause I'm not gonna give it up
I can't go to sleep at night, sleep at night
I can't go to sleep at night, sleep at night
Without you it just ain't right, just ain't right
Without you it just ain't right, just ain't right
I can't go to sleep at night, sleep at night
I can't go to sleep at night, sleep at night
Without you it just ain't right, just ain't right
Without you it just ain't right, just ain't right
I can't go to sleep at night, sleep at night (I'm so tired with it all)
I can't go to sleep at night, sleep at night (I'm so tired with it all)
Without you it just ain't right, just ain't right
Without you it just ain't right, just ain't right
I can't go to sleep at night, sleep at night
I can't go to sleep at night, sleep at night
Without you it just ain't right, just ain't right
Without you it just ain't right, just ain't right

Loving you, loving.....
It's easy, so easy
Loving you, loving.....
It's easy, so easy
Loving you, loving.....
It's easy, so easy
It's not your love
