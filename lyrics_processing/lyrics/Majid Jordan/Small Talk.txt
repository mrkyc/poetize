I gotta talk to you
I gotta talk to you
I gotta talk to you
I gotta talk to you
I got things to say
I got things to say

I've already said too much
And I don't wanna rush right now
But I feel so far away
I don't want to rush right now
I gotta talk to you
Am I making a mistake?
Tell me...

If you would take this chance
Then I'll take it too
I have these thoughts I keep
I wanna share with you
And when I'm out of luck
I always favor you
To bring me back to life
You always make me feel good
