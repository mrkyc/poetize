Shots to the chest
No Less
I'm done keeping her up all night
Best of the best
No less
She needs someone who's on her side
Lost on the run
No fun, I'm done
Acting like you mine
You know I'm not the only one
Second to none
You're gone, it's done
I'm acting like it's fine
You know I'm not the only one

Too far, too far

Why'd you wanna be my love?
Why'd you wanna be my love?
Why'd you wanna be my love?
Why'd you wanna be my love?
Why'd you wanna be my love?
Why'd you wanna be my love?
Why'd you wanna be my love?
Why'd you wanna be my love?

You called
You say just let it be (let it be)
I can't
I say you mean too much to me
It's real
Theres no one else I found
I feel
Really need to figure this out
Just you and I
I only wanna provide
Whatever makes you smile
I only wanna provide
I wanna hear you say you mine
Only wanna bathe in silence
Only wanna live forever
Only wanna keep things quiet
Only wanna be together
Only wanna bathe in silence
Only wanna live forever
Only wanna keep things quiet
Only wanna be together
Only wanna be together
Only wanna be together
Only wanna be together
Only wanna be together
