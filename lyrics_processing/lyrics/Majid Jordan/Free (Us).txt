I took the car last night, I swear I drove it coast to coast
Went looking for your love but didn't get much luck you know
My mind is racing and I'm thinking I should take it slow
Sometimes I feel like maybe I was wrong, yeah

You, you were the one for me, yeah
You, you made me wanna start a family
You, you were my fantasy

You, you set me free
You set me free
And now I'm gone
And I'll leave you alone
You set me free
And now I'm gone
(Set me free)
Set me free, you set me free

Your love makes sense to me
But my life gets in the way
I'm not nearly strong enough
To take care of the both of us
Your love makes sense to me
But my life gets in the way
I'm not nearly strong enough
To take care of the both of us

It's pretty late at night, I doubt that you will ever know
I'm doing ninety on the 10 in my Pacifico
My heart is racing 'cause you send it into overdrive
Sometimes I tell myself you were the one

You, you were the one for me, yeah
You, you made me wanna start a family
You, you were my fantasy
