Close to the heart, that's where you are
Don't lose your way
Time has been set, I'll miss you bad
And I don't wanna lose you yet

Give me your heart, give me your hand
I'll show you that love is always there
I'll show you that love is always there
I'll show you that love is always there
So let me love you, baby
Let me love you, baby
Love you all the way
Love you all the way

You're just like a spark, but lost in the dark
You're gone so soon
Just like the air, gone with the wind
Yeah you're lost too soon
It's true, it's true
I'm better cause of you
I wanted to tell you
I'm better than the first night that we got together
You, you better know me too
You know you love me too
You might also like
Give me your heart, give me your hand
I'll show you that love is always there
I'll show you that love is always there
I'll show you that love is always there
So let me love you, baby
Let me love you, baby
Love you all the way
Let me love you, baby
Let me love you, baby
Let me love you, baby
Love you all the way

Give me your heart, give me your hand
Sometimes love is all we have
Right at the start, ride to the end
I hope that love is always there

Give me your heart, give me your hand
I'll show you that love is always there
I'll show you that love is always there
I'll show you that love is always there
Give me your heart, give me your hand
I'll show you that love is always there
I'll show you that love is always there
