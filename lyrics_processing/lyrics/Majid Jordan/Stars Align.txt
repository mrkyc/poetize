I know you been searchin' for someone
To make you happy and get the job done
You said you needed a man with money
But I can't be there, so will you still care?

Freaky girl, Aries sign
I'm gonna try and get it right this time
I just really need a place and time
I was just starin' at your face online
I wanna rock right now if it's time
I just did a double and it tasted fine
Can't afford no more wasted time
I'm tryna show you bein' patient is not my vibe, not my vibe
I'm tryna link on some ASAP vibes
I never really had a patient side
I'm tryna rock right now if the time is right, time is right
To make you and I the thing that last through the night

I know how you get when the stars align
I know how you get when the full moon shine
I know how you need space and your time, space and time
I'm tryna rock right now if it's time
Know about your sign 'cause it's close to mine
I know we can be the same sometimes
I know you need healin'
Know you rollin' off of the real thing
Know you passed down with these other things
Know that you didn't mean to ruin my week
Know what you meant when you said those things
Know you mean well when you say your piece
Know you even though you don't know me
Know you already
