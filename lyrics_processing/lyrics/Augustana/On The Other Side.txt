Can you read the signs?
I'll never lose you
I couldn't choose to if I tried
Put your faith in me
What will be will be
Some things I know
And I know that you were meant for me
I don't know where the ocean meets the sky
I don't know why the world keeps spinning by
Don't know why the hours move so slow
Babe when I'm with you, I don't wanna know
I wanna feel your feet lifting off the ground
I wanna feel you love me at the speed of sound
And babe, it could end tonight, know it would be alright
Cause I'm gonna love you, somewhere on the other side
It's written on your face
Just like a twist of fate
I can't erase it
Some things you know we can't escape
I don't know where the ocean meets the sky
I don't know why the world keeps spinning by
Don't know why the hours move so slow
But when I'm with you, I don't wanna know

And I will be there for you
Be there to shelter you
Anywhere you go, you know I will be
And I'm gonna be the one
Be like the rising sun
Never hurt you
I don't know why the stars fall from the sky
I don't know why the Heaven's open wide
Don't know where the winds of change will blow
But when I'm with you, I don't need to know
I wanna feel your feet lifting off the ground
Wanna feel you love me at the speed of sound
