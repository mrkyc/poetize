Underline on my diary
Used to write it when I feel lonely
Yeah, "Boy, don't cry, it's alright"
Now I'm grown up much as Andy
Want this story happy ending
Though it's not a fairy tale

I dreamed the dream
That I would be rockstar on the show (Ooh-ooh)
Thought all my dreams would have come true at this age
But maybe it's not too late
So don't hold back
It's your time, yeah, I'm still going on

So I will tell the world it's alright
Do boy, it's the time
Hey, don't look back 'cause we don't have to
La-di-da-di-da
And I'll sing thank you, all my love
You were whole my world
Wish you all the best
Goodbye my youth
You might also like
It'll be better than yesterday
Good enough I can sing this way (Ooh-ooh)
Unexpected journey of my twenties
My twenty, twenty

Still bad at playing the guitar
Head with the thoughts, and it's locked
Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
But now I'm who I've got to be
Don't waste it, I'll taste it

So I will tell the world it's alright
Do boy, it's the time
Hey, don't look back 'cause we don't have to
La-di-da-di-da
And I'll sing thank you, all my love
You were whole my world
Wish you all the best
Goodbye my youth

(Ooh-ooh)
Unexpected journey of my twenties
My twenty, twenty
My memories will carry on
(Carry on, carry on)
Bad or good, it's life and beyond
(And beyond and beyond)
Gravity don't mean too much to me
Learned how I got better place to be
It's not yet to your best (Best)

So I will tell the world it's alright
Do boy, it's the time
Hey, don't look back 'cause we don't have to
La-di-da-di-da
And I'll sing thank you, all my love
You were whole my world
Wish you all the best
Goodbye my youth

It'll be better than yesterday
Good enough I can sing this way (Ooh-ooh)
Unexpected journey of my twenties
