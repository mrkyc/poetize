Yo, lets get it going like this
Foreign Exchange style
Just some little something for y'all to vibe to
A little something to bounce to, rock to, whatever
You know, gotta talk about it
Gotta let y'all know what's going on in my life
Lotta people go questions
Just wanted to let you know what's going on in the world around me
This is how I see it, yo

We got single moms that can't afford to feed children
World War III got planes flying into buildings
Corrupt cops and robbers, thieves and politicians
They just keeping taking as the world keeps spinning
Just take a look around now
A long way from your MTV cribs with the Bose speaker surround sound
Get ready for countdown
Just to get some benefits, my girl lied to them people down town
It's funny how we start out cool, but get corroded
By our quest for power and the people that behold it
We up one minute then down before you know it
With no preliminary warning or advanced notice
I guess that's the reason why our eyes can't focus
Can't afford to raise kids 'cause we gotta raise soldiers
And satellites looking at my pad when I wrote this
A Brave New World, y'all better know it
Yo, y'all better know it

Yo, y'all better know it

Been a lot of long days, lot of nights travelling
Lot of niggas asking what record's 9th's sampling
Lot of nights on stage, we forgetting the timing
A lot of in-stores, sore throats, and poster signings
A lot of cats after mines
But that ain't even what keeps me motivated half the time
I think of open mic nights when I would ask to rhyme
When I had something to prove and an axe to grind
Now we travel world wide, full throttle
Scared to catch SARS so we cancelled all the shows in Toronto
This rap shit ain't all about hoes and supermodels
It's more about me making this money to pay my car note
So our families can feed each other, these days
My ends are perfect strangers who'll never meet each other
Strong pounds and bear hugs when we greet each other
'Cause in this new world I know we gonna need each other like that
Check it out
Check it
One, two
For you
'Cause it's a Brave New World
Y'all better know it
Check it out
For you and yours
'Cause it's a Brave New World
Y'all better know it
Yo, y'all better know it
