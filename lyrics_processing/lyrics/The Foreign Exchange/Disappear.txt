You know that I'ma put it down
You know that I'ma do you right
You know that I'ma hold it down
And we can work it all night
You know that I'ma put it down
You know that I'ma do you right
You know that I'ma hold it down

Hold on tight, don't let it go
But be careful if you do
Cause you can squeeze all the life from what you love
Out of fear that you might lose
(Don't do it)

I need you, I need to
Believe you'll stay right here
Completely, you keep me
You treat me so sincere
Beside me, you guide me
You wipe away my tears
So why won't you, why don't you
Say you won't disappear
You might also like
You know that I'ma put it down
You know that I'ma do you right
You know that I'ma hold it down
And you can work it all night
You know that I'ma put it down
You know that I'ma do you right
You know that I'ma hold it down
(Even if you won't just say you will)

Maybe my flaw is I can't let go of love
And maybe my all for you is a little too much
Catch 22 I keep falling for your touch
And I don't wanna give it up, don't wanna give it up

I need you, I need to
Believe you'll stay right here
Completely, you keep me
You treat me so sincere
Beside me, you guide me
You wipe away my tears
So why won't you, why don't you
Say you won't disappear
If you'll be my baby, I'll stay by your side
And if you'll be my lover, we could see the light
Ain't no need in waiting, there's no way we can survive
Or maybe we can start again
Maybe you can hear me now
Maybe you can hear me now
Maybe you can hear me now
Maybe you can hear me now
Cause I can see so clearly now
Cause I can see so clearly now
Maybe you can hear me now
Maybe you can hear me now
Cause I can see so clearly now
Cause I can see so clearly now

I need you, I need to
Believe you'll stay right here
Completely, you keep me
You treat me so sincere
Beside me, you guide me
You wipe away my tears
So why won't you, why don't you
