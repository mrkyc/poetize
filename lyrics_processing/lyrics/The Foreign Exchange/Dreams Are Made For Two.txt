What am I waiting for?
So many places I could see
But who wants to do it alone?

I don't wanna ask for too much
All I know is dreams are made for two, babe
Dreams are made for two, babe
Without your smile and your touch what's it mean?
Cause dreams are made for two, babe
Dreams are made for two, baby

I'm laying on the shore
It's so amazing by the sea
But who wants to view it alone?
And if you've come this far
Then it might as well be
Be with someone you love

And when the lights go down I pray we never change
Cause girl I adore it
Lay with me and everyday I'll do the same
I hope that we endure it
You might also like
I don't wanna ask for too much
All I know is dreams are made for two, babe
Dreams are made for two, babe
Without your smile and your touch what's it mean?
Cause dreams are made for two, babe
Dreams are made for two, baby

Somebody ring the alarm
Gots to face it
I've embraced it
Life's the bracelet baby you're the charm
Something more than looking good on my arm
Don't need a costume
Girl, I got you that's the gospel
Turn to the book of Psalms
Buy a beach or buy a farm
It ain't a dream if my dream can't come along

And when the lights go down I pray we never change
Cause girl I do adore it
Lay with me and everyday I'll do the same
I hope that you enjoy it
I don't wanna ask for too much
All I know is dreams are made for two, babe
Dreams are made for two, babe
Without your smile and your touch what's it mean?
Cause dreams are made for two, babe
