Something in the need is physical
Always on your knees you beg for more
Caught between the feeling, the free, and the storm, on
I cannot replace this chemical
Trapped inside a maze, you never should go
Dancing in the rain, but you don't see the storm

Don't look for pity, cause it's not fair
Don't look for logic, cause it's not there
I just can't shake it, why must it be so cynical
Hiding for days and alone in the night
Know that you're wrong, but it feels so right
For you to make it, it's going to take a miracle

She on me, yeah she on me
I thought it was over, I thought the shit was beyond me
I feel like a monster, in search of the constant high
Feel like I want to die, feel like a zombie
Cause she so charming, she so charming
Baby take my hand, the effect is disarming
Her beauty's alarming, man I need a sponsor
And another sponsor, fuck it I need an army
Cause she's still on me, she stay on me
And if I walk away, I can still hear her calling
Still hear her balling, I thought you were mine
Babe I know that you're mine, why are you not responding
Did I say the wrong thing, are we corresponding
Don't you ever run away, babe are you absconding
They say you are addicted, but fuck an addiction
What they call addiction, is what we call bonding
So maybe I messed up, I shouldn't have stressed her
I made her a princess, and she made her jester
And we having court so gon' send in them clowns
Every one of them clowns, yeah nigga you next up
Took me for a ride, on your rocket now it's time for the dropoff
30 seconds, we go from zero to Mach 4
And it feels like I'm going through hell
But if you're going through hell, what the fuck you wanna stop for?
