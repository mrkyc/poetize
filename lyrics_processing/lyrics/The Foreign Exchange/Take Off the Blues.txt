(Mmmmmmm, haaah-hahh-hahhh...)
You might
You might, you might, you might as well...
(Mmmmmmm, haaah-hahh-hahhh, haaah-haah...)

After all is said and done, you're next to me
And when the sun goes down, you're feeling things you've never felt before
Nothing left to say to ease your fears
But I know just what to do
Let me take good care of yooo-oohhh-ooou

Kick off your shoes
Take off the blues and come to me
So much to do, so much is meant for you to see
You might as well
Come a little closer
Girl, don't make me wait too long for you

After all is said and done (Said and done)
And there's nothing left to share (Left to share)
It's the morning after, I watch you lying there (just wanna watch you lying there)
Always told that you should not give in to love (LOVE)
But saying no is so hard to do (So hard...)
Cause when the feeling's right, you might as well, yeah
You might also like
Kick off your shoes
Take off the blues and come to me
So much to do, so much is meant for you to see
You might as well
Come a little closer
Girl, don't make me wait too long for you

Just, want your attention
Ex-cuse my intentions
Keep your feelings intact
Don't wanna hurt nobody, let me say it again
There's, no need to mention
For, this I've been wishing
There's no turning back
Lady, please take my hand
Let's dance...


Kick off your shoes
Take off the blues and come to me (And come to me)
So much to do, so much is meant for you to see
(So much to see)
You might as well (You might as well)
Come a little closer
Girl, don't make me wait too long for you
Kick off your shoes
Take off the blues and come to me
So much to do, so much is meant for you to see
(So much to see)
You might as well (Might as well)
Come a little closer
Girl, don't make me wait too long for you
Come closer, babe
Come closer, babe
Come closer, babe
Come closer, babe
Come closer, babe
Come closer, babe
Come closer, babe
Come closer, babe
