It's hard,but it's real
Y'know what I'm sayin'?
It's har- it's hard but it's real (hahaha)
Hey

Been thinkin' baby
I finally took the time
The wound is healing now
And now I realize

Nothing you can say
That could ever make me stay
Let me tell ya
Nothing you can do
Cause when it comes to me and you
She's just better
(Bring it back (yeah)
Bring it back (yeah)
Bring it back (yeah)
Bring it back)

You might also like
In every way (every way)
And everyday I'm (everyday I'm)
Surely thankful for her (thankful for)
Such a feelin' inside


So I don't ever have to run away
And I don't ever wanna try to leave
A soft kiss on a summer day
It's the feeling that you giving me yeah

She's always a friend of mine
And it came to me right on time
No tears left for me to cry
Cause it was you not you and I

Hol' up

If you know it sing along with me
I used to feel like something was wrong with me
Big man, pimp hand strong with me
And maybe love really ain't belong with me
Slowed it down, took a vow of matrimony
Who woulda guessed it all ended in acrimony
Our eyes down, heads bowed like we in service
Cause you believe a man is to be your servant
Steady telling yourself that he deserve it
Then wonder why a nigga broke out like he allergic
But I ain't talking 'bout a hive
I'm talking 'bout the lives of those who can reach us
Turn your world around and then teach us
Soup for the soul and it feeds us
So light a candle
I'm feeling brand new fully loaded with features
A love that frees us, Jesus!
She's just better
She's just better
She's just better
