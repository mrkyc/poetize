I'm gonna need you to sing this one in a minute...
You ready
Uh, sing to me
Yeah, sing to me
Y'all know that feeling of love that just make you feel so warm inside
I swear there ain't nothing' like it y'all...ain't in beautiful

Love this feeling
So reminiscent of feelings before
So glad to see there's more
With you days are easier
And more alive and real
Your heart is what I'm here for

I want to call you everyday
When I ain't got shit to say
This must be love (be love...yeah)
Bring you some wings on your lunch break
Like, 'baby how's your day'?
Twelve piece, fried hard...it's all for you
 (Munsinah)
It's just something inside us
Something that guides us closer to truth
This is something to behold, ooh
It feels so new loving again
You might also like
I like the place you take me
A place of love & safety
Your love's all I wanna know
Darling you're such a blessing (such a blessing)
A love refreshing (So refreshing)
You're the one I've waited for (I've waited for)

I want to call you everyday
When I ain't got shit to say
This must be love (be love...yeah)
Bring you some wings on your lunch break
Like, 'baby how's your day'?
Twelve piece, fried hard...it's all for you

It's just something inside us
Something that guides us closer to truth
This is something to behold, ooh
It feels so new loving again (One more time, baby I don't think they heard you)

It's just something inside us
Something that guides us closer to truth
This is something to behold, ooh
It feels so new loving again
Uh, Uh, Uh, Uh...
So hot you're melting
When you fall down I'll lend a helping
Hand to measure
Cause I'm your pleasure
Principle like Mr. Belding
When the bell rings
We change classes
From welter to heavyweight upgrade passes
Weekends where we resort
To all your favorite resorts
Have a couple drinks go out dancing
On the dance floor, doin' our two step
People they wonder, wanna know who the eff
Is this dude, he
Acts so cooley
I just school these niggas like UNICEF
You can do the rest
I see through your dress
Make a nigga weak in the knees
The birds & bees and the dos & don'ts
Something to behold
I know what you want...I know what you want

It's just something inside us
Something that guides us closer to truth
This is something to behold, ooh
It feels so new loving again
