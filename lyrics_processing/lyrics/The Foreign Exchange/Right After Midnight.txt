We've got a thing
And everybody knows
But the night is young and pretty girl I'm ready to go
So ride out, hey

Don't wanna play cool
And don't wanna play shy
Don't wanna break rules
And don't wanna waste time
Maybe I could be yours
And you could be mine
If we're behind closed doors
Right after midnight

Pretending I don't see you
While we're on the floor
Wishing I could lead you
Into something more
Your eyes are feeding my curiosity
Why is this happening?
I say baby
You looking good but I can't play this game all night
And if you want me to sing it again then I'll say baby
I like the way you move and girl you're just my type
Just my type, lover
So ride out, hey
You might also like
Don't wanna play cool
And don't wanna play shy
Don't wanna break rules
And don't wanna waste time
Maybe I could be yours
And you could be mine
If we're behind closed doors
Right after midnight

We've got a thing
And everybody knows
But the night is young
And we're dancing close
And I've been waiting
And Imagining
All the love we're making
Maaaan, look
So I say baby
You looking good but don't just take this as a sign
And if you want me to sing it again then I say baby
Just wanna know what can I do to make you mine, lover
Make you mine, lover
So ride out, hey
Don't wanna play cool
And don't wanna play shy
Don't wanna break rules
And don't wanna waste time
Maybe I could be yours
And you could be mine
If we're behind closed doors
Right after midnight
Don't wanna play cool
And don't wanna play shy
Don't wanna break rules
And don't wanna waste time
Maybe I could be yours
And you could be mine
If we're behind closed doors
Right after midnight
