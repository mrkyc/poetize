Ooh, I got some things on my mind
Would you mind?
Ooh, don't worry I'm feeling fine
Feeling fine
Hey, to lay with you is simply divine
So divine
Oh yeah, think I got lucky this time
This time

Now here's a thought
We're unprepared
For love so filthy
No I don't want it
Don't even care
Of that I'm guilty
No doubt about it
We're nearly there
And on the inside good God almighty
I'm really scared
It's not what I've known

So what about the real possibility
Perfection only lives in your mind
And what if we both have the ability
To be each other's lucky find?

On a day, on a day like today
Gonna change my point of view
On a day, on a day like today
Gonna try me something new
On a day, on a day like today
My grey skies turn to blue
On a day, on a day like today
I'll find my way to you

Now look inside
What do you see?
The opportunity for all you wanted
How it should be
A life without love so cold and broken
No not for me
You let your guard down and all I'm hoping
That you would see
Just how much we've grown

So what about the real possibility
Perfection only lives in your mind
And what if we both have the ability
To be the one that we hoped to find?
Get out the way of your happiness
Let go of all you know that's not true
Why should we call for a better day
When now's the time to see it through?
On a day, on a day like today
Gonna change my point of view
On a day, on a day like today
Gonna try me something new
On a day, on a day like today
My grey skies turn to blue
On a day, on a day like today
