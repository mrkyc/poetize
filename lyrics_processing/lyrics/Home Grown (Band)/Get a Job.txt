Woo!
Hey hey hey!
Go!

I've been wastin' my life
For nineteen years
I'm tired of sittin' around
Watchin' football and drinkin' beer

I don't wanna go to work
Pushed around by a fuckin' jerk
I don't wanna do anything
But my life is in a rut
An education I gave up
I don't wanna do anything
Oh yeah

I'm goin' out to get a job
Gonna rise up to the top
Gonna make a million dollars
I'm goin' out to get a job
Gonna rise up to the top
Gonna make a million dollars
Oh yeah

A couple years have gone by
I feel I'm getting old
Nothin' to do with my life
I'm just a loser with nowhere to go

'Cause I don't wanna go to work
Pushed around by a fuckin' jerk
I don't wanna do anything
But my life is in a rut
An education I gave up
I don't wanna do anything
Oh yeah

I'm goin' out to get a job
Gonna rise up to the top
Gonna make a million dollars
I'm goin' out to get a job
Gonna rise up to the top
Gonna make a million dollars
I'm goin' out to get a job
Gonna rise up to the top
Gonna make a million dollars
I'm goin' out to get a job
Gonna rise up to the top
Gonna make a million dollars
Oh yeah
I'm goin' out to get a job
Gonna rise up to the top
Gonna make a million dollars
I'm goin' out to get a job
Gonna rise up to the top
Gonna make a million dollars
I'm goin' out to get a job
Gonna rise up to the top
Gonna make a million dollars
I'm goin' out to get a job
Gonna rise up to the top
Gonna make a million dollars
Oh yeah
