I try so hard just to fit in
I'll walk around with a cup of beer in my hand
And smoke a cigarette
I want to be like everyone else
If i was a rock star, they would notice me
And they would want my autograph
I'll have a video on MTV
And I'll be signed on Epitaph
I'm just another face in the crowd, not gonna let it bring me down
Because I know someday, I'll break away
I'm just another face in the crowd, gonna break away somehow
Before my mind goes insane
Everyday I think about my future
I don't know what I want to be
It always feels like I'm stagnating...
Uh whoa uh whoa uh oh oh...oh!
Seperated from society
If I was an actor like Keanu Reeves
Then all the girls would scream and shout
I'll be rich and famous from the movie screen
And by this time we'll be sold out
I'm just another face in the crowd, not gonna let it bring me down
Because I know someday, I'll break away
I'm just another face in the crowd, gonna break away somehow
Before my mind goes insane
You might also likeI'm gonna start today
I'm gonna make a change
I'm gonna be ok
I'm gonna start today
Start today
If i was a rock star, they would notice me
And they would want my autograph
I'll have a video on MTV
And I'll be signed on Epitaph
I'm just another face in the crowd, not gonna let it bring me down
Because I know someday, I'll break away
I'm just another face in the crowd, gonna break away somehow
Before my mind goes insane
I'm just another face in the crowd, not gonna let it bring me down
Because I know someday, I'll break away
I'm just another face in the crowd, gonna break away somehow
Before my mind goes insane
