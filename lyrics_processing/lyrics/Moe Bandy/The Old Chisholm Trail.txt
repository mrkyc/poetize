I'll tell you of my troubles on the old Chisholm trail
Come a ti yi yippee, come a ti yi yea
Come a ti yi yippee, come a ti yi yea
Oh, a ten-dollar hoss and a forty-dollar saddle
And I'm goin' to punchin' Texas cattle
Come a ti yi yippee, come a ti yi yea
Come a ti yi yippee, come a ti yi yea
I wake in the mornin' afore daylight
And afore I sleep the moon shines bright
Come a ti yi yippee, come a ti yi yea
Come a ti yi yippee, come a ti yi yea
It's cloudy in the west, a-lookin' like rain
And my durned old slicker's in the wagon again
Come a ti yi yippee, come a ti yi yea
Come a ti yi yippee, come a ti yi yea
No chaps, no slicker, and it's pourin' down rain
And I swear, by gosh, I'll never night-herd again
You might also likeCome a ti yi yippee, come a ti yi yea
Come a ti yi yippee, come a ti yi yea
Feet in the stirrups and seat in the saddle
I hung and rattled with them long-horn cattle
Come a ti yi yippee, come a ti yi yea
Come a ti yi yippee, come a ti yi yea
The wind commenced to blow, and the rain began to fall
Hit looked, by grab, like we was goin' to lose 'em all
Come a ti yi yippee, come a ti yi yea
Come a ti yi yippee, come a ti yi yea
I don't give a darn if they never do stop;
I'll ride as long as an eight-day clock
Come a ti yi yippee, come a ti yi yea
Come a ti yi yippee, come a ti yi yea
We rounded 'em up and put 'em on the cars
And that was the last of the old Two Bars
Come a ti yi yippee, come a ti yi yea
Come a ti yi yippee, come a ti yi yea
Oh, it's bacon and beans most every day
I'd as soon be a-eatin' prairie hay
Come a ti yi yippee, come a ti yi yea
Come a ti yi yippee, come a ti yi yea
I went to the boss to draw my roll
He had it figgered out I was nine dollars in the hole
Come a ti yi yippee, come a ti yi yea
Come a ti yi yippee, come a ti yi yea
Goin' back to town to draw my money
Goin' back home to see my honey
Come a ti yi yippee, come a ti yi yea
Come a ti yi yippee, come a ti yi yea
With my knees in the saddle and my seat in the sky
I'll quit punchin' cows in the sweet by and by
Come a ti yi yippee, come a ti yi yea
