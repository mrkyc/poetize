And they've really got a lot of charm
But I must admit I wouldn't mind it a bit
To be laying in their loving arms
But down in my heart I know we're worlds apart
I would never be satisfied
Cause the woman for me
She's gonna have to be just a little on the country side
I took a chance on a little romance
On a fella who was city slick
I felt like a queen in his black limousine
But it really didn't do the trick
And when I got up to go
He said that he didn't know
Why the feeling inside of me died
I said I needed a man who had some dirt on his hands
And just a little on the country side
Country side, country side
It's the finest side of life
I'm gonna get my hand to a country man
I'm gonna take a country wife
And we'll save up for a big dumb truck
And take us for a country ride
We'll spend our days where the cattle graze
In a cottage by the country side
You might also likeThe music they play in this city cafe
Sounds good to them I guess
But I don't slap my knees
And I don't tap my feet
So it really doesn't past the test
I want to hear some steel to a country feel
I wanna hear that six string style
So take that disc and flip your wrist
And let me hear the country side
Country side, country side
It's the place where I was born
I want to hide away in a pile of hay
I want to plow a field of corn
I love the southern states
And the buckwheat cakes
I like my chicken fried
I'm gonna spend my days where the cattle graze
