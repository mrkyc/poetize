And Basin Street is the street
Where all the boys and the boot folks meet
Down in New Orleans, in that land of dreams
And you never know how nice it seems
And not so much it really means
La-la-loo-loo

You're dear to me, yes siree
Dear to me, yes siree
Can't you see, baby?
I can't lose
Lose good old Basin Street blues

Never know how nice it seems
Just how much it really means
And I'll see the moon and the moon is pale
And it'll look like they're taking some cat to jail
No, it's the moon that's pale in the sun
And then the sun is gone
And the steam wants to come in
And it splashes on the good, whoo-whoo
And ba-ba-soo-doo

And the pale moon shining on the fields below
Folks are singing songs soft and low
You needn't tell me, boy, 'cause I know
Sleepy time down south

Soft wind blowing through the pinewood trees
And the folks down there live a life of ease
When old mammy falls upon her knees
It's sleepy time down south

Steamboats on the river
Coming and going
Splashing the night time
Eh ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba
Banjos ringing, everybody singing
They dance till the break of day

Dear old southland and his dreamy songs
And it takes me back there where I belong
Oh, how I'd love to be in my mammy's arms
When it's sleepy time down south
That's that boy!
Let go! Let go!

Steamboats on the river
And they're coming and going
And they're splashing the night time
Eh ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba
And they've banjos ringing, everybody singing
They dance till the break of day

Dear old southland and his dreamy songs
And it takes me back there where I belong
Oh, how I'd love to be in my mammy's arms
