And everywhere I go
People know the part I'm playing
Paid for every dance
Selling each romance
Oh, what they're saying
There will come a day
When youth will pass away
What will they say about me
When the end comes I know
They'll say "just a gigolo"
As life goes on without me
I'm just a gigolo
Everywhere I go
People know the part I'm playing
Paid for every dance
Selling each romance
Oh, what they're saying
And there will come a day
Youth will pass away
What will they say about me

'Cause I ain't got nobody
Oh, and just nobody cares for me
There's nobody cares for me
I'm so sad and lonely
Sad and lonely, sad and lonely
Won't some sweet mama
Come take a chance with me
'Cause I ain't so bad
And I sing a sweet love song
All of the time
She will only be, oh-oh-only be
Bop dee bozee bop zitty bop

Nobody cares for me
Nobody cares for me
Nobody cares for me

And I sing a sweet love song
All of the time
She will only be, only, only, only, only, only be
Baby, mama, sugar, darling
