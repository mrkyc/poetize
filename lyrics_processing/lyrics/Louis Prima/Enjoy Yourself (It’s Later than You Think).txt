Enjoy yourself, it's later than you think
Enjoy yourself, while you're still in the pink
The years go by as quickly as a wink
Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself
It's later than you think
Keely: Look honey at that beautiful funeral. I've never seen so many flowers
Louis: Yeah, he was a nice man too, but never had any fun. Didn't have time. Just worked and made money. He didn't even have time to enjoy himself
Keely: Poor man

You're gonna take that two week trip
No matter, come what may
But every year you put it off
You just can't get away
Next year, for sure, you'll hit the road
You'll really get around
But how far can you travel
When you're six feet underground?

Enjoy yourself, it's later than you think
Enjoy yourself, while you're still in the pink
The years go by as quickly as a wink
Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself
It's later than you think
You might also like
You never go to nightclubs, and
You just don't care to dance
You don't have time for silly things
Like moonlight and romance
You only think of dollar bills
Tied neatly in a stack
But when you kiss a dollar bill
It doesn't kiss you back

Enjoy yourself, it's later than you think
Enjoy yourself, while you're still in the pink
The years go by as quickly as a wink
Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself
It's later than you think

Now you love lasagna very much
You like to eat and eat
You won't eat cucuzza
You're afraid it'll break your teeth
You always think you may bite off
More than you can chew
Don't be afraid you won't have teeth
When you reach ninety-two
Oh, enjoy yourself, it's later than you think
Enjoy yourself, while you're still in the pink
The years go by as quickly as a wink
Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself
It's later than you think

Enjoy yourself
