Tay600 speakin'
You are now listenin' to the L'A Nation General, nigga
All you lil niggas, man, you niggas is not L'A'd up, man
Who put you in? Not me

Look, I was raised in the heart of the jungle
Any nigga try to pull my card we gon' rumble
.45 get to ripping parts 'til he crumble
Hating ass niggas try to make me fall, I ain't stumble
Choppa shells make a big tall nigga tumble
My money talk, y'all shit just mumble
Remember Coach told me get the ball, I ain't fumble
And I still answer when he call 'cause I'm humble
He talking beef shit, boy we got guns too
Youngins slide through, get to blowing out the sunroof
Put the beam on him, where the fuck he gonna run to?
TEC with the scope, what the fuck you niggas wan' do?
We got MACs, semis, we got drums too
Posted up, Smith and Wesson, you can come through
Send a couple young bulls, to go hunt you
And they coming quick fast nigga one, two
You the type to sneak diss over shit
I'm the youngin with the gunplay from the six
Broke ass nigga, y'all boys need a fix
Pass that MAC to A.B.E, call that a assist
Hollow tips get to coming fast like a pitch
Bunch of wild niggas on your ass like a bitch
See a opp lacking, catch his ass with a bitch
Now his ass laying in the grass or a ditch
Jewelry on me, got these bitches wanna cuff me
F&N on me, dare a nigga try to touch me
Sneak dissing like the pussy nigga want beef
Say he want war, slide up on him, now we up three
Yeah, that's what I call a real war, nigga
Got them sticks with us, all up on tour, nigga
I'll leave yo ass wet like a shore
We them killers, where you sleep, where your door nigga?

I tried telling these niggas, man
You niggas is not fucking, fucking with me, man
You niggas is lil niggas, man
Stay in y'all motherfuckin' lane, man
Let big dogs do what big dogs do, you hear me?

Niggas rapping about streets but ain't in it
Ask about us, L'A gang, bitch, we winning
Running round in stolen whips, and they tinted
Run into him at the light, now he finished
Foreign bitch just gave me top, think she British
.40 Glock make him flip like a gymnast
Got some niggas whipping work like a chemist
100 round just hit him, put him in Guinness
I can never show a nigga no mercy
If I spot you then I'm gon' do you dirty
Heard the nigga talkin', like he gon' hurt me
Put shots up in him, right out the .30
All up in his back, they calling him Curry
Paramedics pick him up in a hurry
Say what you gon' do, I don't got no worries
If a nigga try to play he get buried

Let a nigga try to play, he gon' get buried, man
That's word to L's, word to L'A, word to all my motherfuckin' dead homies
Let a nigga try to play
Leave a nigga right where he staying, you hear me?
Coming where I'm from, it's hella homicides
If you run up on me, let the Ruger ride
A lot of niggas they be haters in disguise
I can see it, I just look up in they eyes
Pussy talking shit like, I'm gon' let it slide
Pussy talking shit like, I'm gon' let it slide, nigga
Choppas sic up on him, now they sleeping on him
If I got it on me put the feet up on him
Leaking in the street then put them sheet up on him
.40 clips up on him, 30 sticks up on him
I thought yo ass weren't lacking, how they get up on you?
Talking like you 'bout it, better keep it on you
Nickel get to clapping, now they creeping on you
Niggas think they Cappin, Cap don't even know you

Niggas think they Cappin, Cap don't even know you, hahaha
