Niggas say they out here but these niggas look like ghosts to me
You ain't kill nobody but keep talkin like you smokin me
Known around my city from 290 back to over east
LA died his ashes round my neck just like a rosary
Kill any nigga that try to get over me
That's how it's posed to be
Glock 50 round with a beam I'ma hit any nigga that try to get close to me
You know I'm clutchin I'm ready to catch me a body watch how you approachin me
He lookin for me he know where I'm at you would see me whereever them smokers be
Get in my bed with a 30 it's 1 in the head nigga that's how you posed to sleep
Up in his yard in all black well I'm here then come out nigga that's how you posed to creep
Everybody say they get money I look at they pictures you niggas is broke to me
Niggas start shootin at niggas in 2018 nigga that shit is old to me
Boy I been that nigga since them niggas was home
You ain't start being official til everybody was gone
You gon need a couple bands for me to get on a song
Old friends steady throwing shade but if I kill em I'm wrong
He say it's beef gotta chopper I'm gone
I wanna fuck I won't talk on the phone
I see a opp I'ma chalk em alone
I done shot so many opps in the dome
He wanna tweak on the net better leave me alone before I hit top with the chrome
I just might buy me a mid and then go and drill as soon as I pop it it's on
You might also likeNiggas talkin like they with it but they not around
Left him stankin in the ditches body wasn't found
Give him face shots with the tec and leave him outta bounds
Why you rappin like you drillin you stay outta town
When I wake up it's time to go drill as soon as I get me a ride
Slide through the opps anybody I spot then you know I'ma kill every nigga outside
I caught him lackin he runnin and jumpin fences I guess he was tryna survive
I hit em up in the face in the neck in the chest bitch you better be glad you alive
He wanna kill me then tell him to slide I'm smokin on him and his guys
I heard that you put a bag on my head tell ya killers come win em a prize
Everybody say that they want you to win but them niggas be fake in disguise
They tellin me I been quiet for a minute but fuck all them niggas I'm tired
I ain't never duck no beef you know where I'm from bitch I'm from King Drive
I was that one posted up on the map nigga I ain't never play both sides
I'ma tell you like LA say "lil lame ass nigga be quiet"
Screamin "fuck ya homie he dead" opp niggas get deep fried uhh
I'm on the block with the mac .45
I see a opp hit his face both eyes
Just hit the bitch I don't want no ties
My niggas up we don't play broke guys
You see me out better blow gotta k with a scope and all my niggas don't hide
I get the call it's a go and we comin fasho cuz all my niggas gon slide
Pour a four I'm sippin act I'm movin like a snail
Hit his bm from the back that pussy got no smell
Get on any nigga beat and eat it like rotell
