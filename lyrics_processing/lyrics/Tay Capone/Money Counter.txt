We getting closer to the top, you see no ones around me
We fucking hoes and doing shows
You see the money piling
And I ain't worried 'bout the opps, we make a syrup out em
Got so much money in my pockets, need a money counter
Need a money counter, i need a money counter
Got so much money in my pockets, need a money counter
Need a money counter, i need a money counter
I got all these knots, up in my racks
I need a money counter

I need a money counter, I got my gun around me
I catch a opp, up in these streets, he better run from 'round me
And they're ain't no punks around me
They leave you slumped around me
Yo bitch she like how my squad rocks, she says it's fun around me
Ain't goin lie
Im so fly
These niggas sweet, like sweet potato pie
I be so high
I reach to the sky
I don't like bitches, unless they Bi
Shit so easy, I don't even gotta try
Team straight drummin, make a nigga wanna cry
Shells so hot, gotta nigga finna to die
Shells so hot, gotta nigga feeling fried
And Ima chase this bank, all by myself
Getting paid like everyday, till i get a lot of wealth
And if a nigga try to take it, shoot his face, he needs some help
And I be out here doing me, i ain't thinking 'bout no one else
I lost a couple niggas, in this shit
So i'm finna kill some opps, then we finna go get rich
We be posted on the blocks, with them 40s or them nicks
And just because i'm getting guap, that don't mean that ima liveeeeeeee
