Mmm
Man, I just be thinkin' like, "These niggas can't be L'A'd up, man
These niggas ain't L'A'd up, man"
I'm tired of hearin' that shit, y'know?
These niggas wasn't on shit when we was out here
But me, I'm L'A'd up for real

I remember when them surgeons came out and said L'A ain't make it
Swear I couldn't believe that shit, but, man, I had to face it
I went from with my bro, fuckin' hoes up in that basement
To sayin' long live my brother, so I had to chase it
After that night, for some weeks, I cried myself to sleep
I'm traumatized, shit was deep, I never felt so weak
I cannot lack up in these streets, they wanna catch me sleep
They wanna catch me sleep
Got that call from G. Gotti, like, "L'A was hit!"
I'm like, "Hell nah, can't be bro, not on no day like this"
Check my Twitter, couple bitches sayin' the same shit
Tweeted Durk, I'm like, "We gone, I'm 'bout to change whips"
Then I picked up Durk, now we up in traffic, skrt
I was on the lurk, up at the hospital first
Then I seen his mama, in the eyes, she lookin' hurt
I'm thinkin' like if he gone, I'm puttin' one on a shirt
We was just talking 'bout gettin' on
Now, they said he gone
Now, I'm out here on my own, M'Thang, he ain't home
Every night I got that chrome, tryna send one home
And my nigga with the stars, right where he belong
I went from doin' shit that's basic to goin' on vacations
I got potential, I could make it, so niggas, they hated
My mama told me to be patient, so happy, I waited
Another way, my brother paved it, L'A, that's the nation
We used to sleep up on them vacants on blocks that was bakin'
We got dreads just like Jamaicans, so hoes, we was Haitian
But whole time, we just playin'
(But whole time, we just playin')
Look at my lil' sister, I swear I see my brother in her
L'A Capone, can't compare him to no other nigga
Sometime I cry to myself 'cause, man, I love you, nigga
Between you and M'Thang, no one above you niggas
Took my right hand off the block when he was 17
So when I went and got that Glock, bitch, I had 17
I swore that if I seen a opp that I'ma let it ring
I had to get off that hot shit and onto better things
He disrespect, then we makin' a scene
We pullin' up with them TEC's and them beams
They hoppin' out with them vests and machines
Hollow tips hit him, I bet he'll sing
Stop all that bluffin', ain't scarin' a thing
Shells hit his neck and they come out his spleen
I'm chasin' a dream
I was born to go get it, that's by any means
I'm gettin' this green
All these fuck niggas mad they can't get in between
I'm doin' big things
I been turned since a youngin' and I'm still a teen...
... And I'm still a teen

Aye, you heard? I say, on that new shit, I say: "If he can't break bread, he fake
I had one mo' buck on my plate
It was me and bro, we was in the sto'
