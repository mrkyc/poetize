Yeah
Yeah
Yeah

In this life, they gon' judge you
Make a move, we gon' bless you
I'm just counting my blessings
Stacking money like Tetris
Streets, they taught me a lesson
Mamma giving me lectures
Feeling like I got the world on my shoulder, but I can't fold under pressure
I can't fold under the pressure
I can't fold under the pressure, I can't fold under the pressure
I can't fold under the pressure
I can't fold under the pressure, I can't fold under the pressure

I can't fold under the pressure
They say I told under pressure
These niggas hoes, I'ma test 'em
I just came home, I'm a felon
I make one call, they gon' nail 'em
Them killers do what I tell 'em
Big bankroll on me, no wallet
Balenci shoes with the Robin, I gotta eat, I was starving
Man, I'm so high, I'm a martian
You niggas better be cautious before you end up a target
Say that you savage, I'm savager, I be with killers and animals
He made a tweet, I'ma damage him
Ain't no I.D., bitch, I'm whacking him
Catch him in traffic, we light him up
They gon' kill him and his passenger
No, I don't do shit for free, you talking business just hit up my manager

Where you at? I ain't tryna talk
Fuck the internet, I ain't tryna talk
Interviews, I ain't tryna talk
Nigga check the news, bitch, it's white chalk

In this life, they gon' judge you
Make a move, we gon' bless you
I'm just counting my blessings
Stacking money like Tetris
Streets, they taught me a lesson
Mamma giving me lectures
Feeling like I got the world on my shoulder, but I can't fold under pressure
I can't fold under the pressure
I can't fold under the pressure, I can't fold under the pressure
I can't fold under the pressure
I can't fold under the pressure, I can't fold under the pressure

I can't fold under pressure
Bitch, I still tote that Beretta, and that bitch got a compressor
Glock 30 long like a letter
I know you can't do it better, bitch, I be fly like a feather
You cuffing her, she a eater
Cut that bitch off, I don't need her, cause she won't give me a breather
Young nigga came from the ether
Yeah, bitch, I'm hot like a heater, just made 2K on a feature, yeah!
I can't believe that these niggas keep talking to me
If you want me on a beat, then I charge 'em a fee, I don't talk for the free
I made 10K in a week, I know that shit ain't nothin', but it's something to me
Niggas, they say they want beef 'til you pop out the cut with the gun to his teeth
I be in my own lane
Goofy nigga, worry 'bout the wrong thing
50 shot TEC, I don't aim
I'ma show you that you said the wrong name
In this life, they gon' judge you
Make a move, we gon' bless you
I'm just counting my blessings
Stacking money like Tetris
Streets, they taught me a lesson
Mamma giving me lectures
Feeling like I got the world on my shoulder, but I can't fold under pressure
I can't fold under the pressure
I can't fold under the pressure, I can't fold under the pressure
I can't fold under the pressure
