Fuck that twitter beef bitch we leave it in the streets
You sneak diss but when you see me you won't speak
I get you hit i'll leave you bleeding with this heat
And we won't miss i'll leave you leaking in these streets

Fuck that Twitter beef i'll come and clap you in your hood
Tote 30's with a beam better stop lacking in your hood
We come trough make a scene better be packing in your hood
We taking niggas down can't come to taxing in your hood
I'm coolin' with Jojizzle and we're leaning of a 4
Send Bite Down on a hit I bet he'll come back with a score
Your chick be on my dick she sucked my shit like she a pro
He say he getting money but i know it's from his loan
But i'm coolin' right now with the MAC or the 8
The 40 and MAC put him right on his place
And if i ride down bullets flying his way
It's gonna be man down bet lacking ain't safe
I'm smoking on dope and i'm bussin' off pills
They took bro L'A so you know it's a drill
Slide on a Brick and fo sho' imma kill
No lackin' in these streets fo sho' it's a drill
