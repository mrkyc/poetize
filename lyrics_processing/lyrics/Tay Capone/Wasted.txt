I don't get wasted
Pour me a 4 and I taste it
Roll up and pop me a perc and get faded
For all of my niggas that's gone that couldn't make it, mama I made it
I used to sleep in the basement,  I gotta bring back a ring for the nation
I'm countin' too many faces, gotta keep L'A with me cuz he sacred
Keep your composure, know I'm a soldier, i'm never sober, loud be the odor
I got a wood it so big I can't fold it, any nigga diss up and hocus-pocus
I know some niggas that switched and they bogus, but it just made me get focused
I got a heart and they thought they had broke it, I knew the rules to this life when I chose it
Since I been in the game I been balling so hard so the ref started givin' me Filaggrins
As a kid you supposed to go play at the park I was up in the cuffs at the station
I had to really sit down to remember them times when I slept in the vacant
And it just made me think back and reflect about all of the time that I wasted

I got a son, I need a M right before he turn one
I keep a gun, and I don't tell bout the shit that I done
Fuck niggas always mad bout some, slide thru the opps I was mad out huntin'
Slid on the block all night it's fun, Glock 21 I don't fight I don't run
Get off my dick, I ain't had shit, I cannot quit, till I get rich
I was out stuck on the bricks with the sticks
You was somewhere tryna get in the mix
Remember these bitches won't fuck cuz I wasn't on they list, now the hoe tryna take a flick
So many labels wanna sign me I probably could pick, young nigga straight from the 6
I made a way from nothin', so when I die bury me with the G's
I keep the killers around me, I had them goons like Jeannette with sneeze
Yeah I was raised in the jungle, I was out there I'm the man of the trees
