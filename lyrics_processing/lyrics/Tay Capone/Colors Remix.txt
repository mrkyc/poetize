Tote that stick while I get high
From the six, I ain't never had to dick ride
A lot of shootouts on the drive better pick sides
Ain't no changing on yo' gang, you can't switch sides
I'm a BD, I fuck with gangsters
Get out of line, and I'ma hang ya
Ain't no rap shit, bitch we gang bangers
Know some real Rough City niggas that'll paint ya
:
Remember I couldn't even drive now I got the keys
Posted on the drive, rip my nigga Steve
Tell that bitch if she ain't fuckin' then she gotta leave
Throwin' up them "b's", and I rep them "c's"
I knew Blood, I knew Cap
Shoot them slugs where you nap
Don't want smoke then get back
In the club with them straps
Ask about the gang, we ain't for nun don't get clapped
Catch you in the streets don't try to run, it's a rap
I was really posted on that corner, me and D Thang
Now that LA dead, I wear his ashes on a key-chain
I can't pop no "x" it make me tweak, I think I see things
Go and ask the opps they ass was hiding when Odee came
Fuck niggas know how we came
Shoot with the stick like D-Gainz
Bitch I ball like Dwayne
Slide with the tec, Ion't need aim
Pull up with the stick, and I won't miss now he in deep pain
Soon as I get that Rollie I'ma flood it, I can't be plain ayee

You can catch me at mandrake fuckin' with DC
I might pull up on Lil' Sam, and fuck with BVC
And I know a couple killers from the Buff Dog
But I got a lot of killers that's from AMG
Hitters with me when I move just from "a" to "b"
They gon' get up on yo' ass if you play with me
If a nigga want to tweak, I got that "k" with me
This gon' make a nigga think what he gon' say to me
Bitch I'm out here on that grind, like ya'll ain't ate in weeks
I just mixed that xanny with that drank, I'm going straight to sleep
Teacher told me I'd be dead, ain't have no faith in me
Now that bitch she want to fuck, and go on dates with me
Raised up in the six, but where I was born I come from the low-end
I been earned my stripes, you know I'm good I'm posted on both ends
I can't fuck with snakes, once you cross the line you know that it's yo' end
Just don't let me catch you stealing shit, we cuttin' off yo' hands
Family full of dealers, since I was young I've been around "low hand"
Pull up on a opp I'm aimin' my gun, I'm shootin' with both hands
Remember I was broke, now everyday I walk with like four bands
Can't say you a snitch with no paperwork, 'cause it won't stand
Bitch I put in work like I got four hands
Since I was thirteen had my forty tight
Hands, and Kiddo posted they on 49th
Say he want some smoke well tell him blow his pipe
Gang-bang in the day, so on them drills I used to go at night
Don't care 'bout what he say he gon' do, bitch I'm the show me type
Big bro told me when you shoot that gun make sure you hold it right
Ride up on them with them New York killers, make them "zo" ya life

Raised up in the jungle bring the zoo out
Pull up on yo' block you gon' lose out
