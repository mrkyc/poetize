I had to stack it and wait I was broke everyday but now I'm on the road to riches
Told me they got me today but they cancelled me out you know you was wrong admit it
I can't go back in that cell unless they put through hell or they give me a longer sentence
I been supposed to take off swear to god I was lost up the road I was gone to prison
Now I be fly like a pigeon
Now I can stop all that hoping and wishing
And I ain't gotta look out cause I'm winning
I wasn't supposed to be here but I'm in it
I been around in this shit for so long everything you that you  done I done did it
I took a break from the game and they say miss me they say I was gone for a minute

I been so stuck tryna beef I wasn't rapping I ain't made a song in a minute
Hanging and banging that street shit coo but you just gotta know when you finished
I can't be fucking with groupie ass niggas cause that's not apart of my image
You better watch how you speaking to me cause you will get popped like a blemish
I am not fucking with people that's new only going with niggas that's been around
Bumping yo new shit you been a clown
Tucking yo bitch i'ma dick her down
That's yo lil bitch but she get around
If you run up .40 sit 'em down
I hit the hoe in a minute now
I'm up next imma get 'em now
Most of these niggas they not really with me they just wanna get what they need from me
I drive the Benz like a speed dummy
New AMG me & CMoney
Someone right there all they see is money
YG he make this shit easy for me
Since a young nigga it's just me and AB he touching the bags and the heaters coming

I got the top from yo thot in the car tell her I ain't have time for a quickie
That bitch sucking my dick for so long I thought she had gave me a hickey
Slide on the opps with the Glock and the pump better not try to run like he Ricky
I'm only fucking the baddest of bitches my niggas they know that I'm picky
I can't be dealing with niggas and bitches that's iffy
Tryna get bread like it's jiffy
I'm tryna ball with my people and run up a milli
Gotta get rich 'for they kill me
I used shoot at niggas and making 'em feel me
Now the whole world gotta hear me
You say you got it but what is you holding really
LongLiveL'A miss him dearly
Look at my diamonds they shining so clearly
You say you love me well mean it sincerely
I'm in yo city don't need no security
Everything water just look at the clarity
