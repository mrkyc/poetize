Ayy, bitch I'm fresh off the block
And I'm fresh out the spot
Pockets fresh out the box
Folks just bought a brand new coupe and that bitch fresh off the lot
And ain't no niggas out here like me they done ran at a stop
And bitch I'm balling, just like Spaulding
And I'm balling, win the ballgame
Bitch I'm saucing, in these Balmains
We do our thing, and let y'all hate

On his ass, on his ass, on his ass
My shorty walk right up on his ass
I'm .223 and they smoke his ass
We could've been get that goofy in traffic but trust me my hitters gon' run his ass
Boy I don't gotta go get it I got it you flexing my youngin' go poke his ass
Hop in the straight and I do the dash
We shoot your window until you crash
Talk like you first but you knew you last
Kick that bitch out ain't no kissing that
Better get low when that blicka blast
Stick on my lap ain't no in the stash
Ain't got no wifey I hit and pass
Nigga you covered just get her bags
Slide up on him with a stick out
Catch his ass with his dick out
TEC came with a beam on it
For a nigga with a big mouth
Don't hide at your bitch house
We gon' make you get kicked out
Come to go and shoot shit down
Fuck nigga better switch routes
Ayy, I remember he went out
Ayy, I'mma buy momma a big house
Ayy, goofy bitch better sit down
Ayy, ask around I'm the shit now

They used to warn me I flex on that bitch now she all on my dick like a pest in this bitch
A nigga ain't give me a dime but they all tryna hate cause I run up a check in this bitch
I come to your party with Lucci and 30's and .50s so cleanup and left in this bitch
We bossed up, approach with caution
Money on your head, call it a auction
And this a foreign, ain't got no aux chord
A nigga boring, she say I'm sauced up
I used to post right up on the block
Big .223 like it's fuck a Glock
And my niggas know I don't fuck with cops
Your man's in my wood bitch it's fuck a opp
These niggas don't know when to fucking stop til I come through let it rock at your fucking top
Your bitch at my crib blowing heat she just blew out my brains cause your bitch is a fucking thot and
Ayy, I be on Morse with the 'Sanes we be on it
Gang, if you ride down my block then my clip is unloading
Ayy, if you ain't DOA then the clip is reloading
Gang, I got 30+ shots I'mma let your ass hold it
