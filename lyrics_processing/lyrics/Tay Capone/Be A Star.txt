One day ima be a star
For the star

One day ima be a star
And be ridin' fast in them cars
And everybody know who we are and where we are
One day ima be a star
When the hunnid bands without charge
And my bank account become large and i'm on top
One day ima be a star
One day ima be a star
I said one day ima be a star
And my bank account become large
When the hunnid bands without charge and i'm on top
One day ima be a star

One day ima ball just like i hit the lottery
And pull up in them cars where I ain't got no key
We got on ice and we ain't gotta do a robbery
Yeah that's my dream, so ain't nobody stoppin' me
Well I ain't gotta worry everything I got is paid for
Cash out nonstop all day i'll be countin' them peso's
And I go out all night you could say that I look like yayo
Buy the dope by the pound fuck an ounce I need about a case load
Hell yeah, I wanna ball out with my niggas
Let's go and buy the mall out with my niggas
We walk on the scene
All the hoes wanna take our picture
And fuck all we see
Cause you know i'll be countin' them figures
I think about this shit like every day
When around and I was starvin'
You can't eat whats on my plate
Ima do this for L'A
And makin' sure my family straight
Still be screamin' fuck the jakes
No I can't wait

One day ima go on the lot and buy that 'rari
All foreign and it's all white look some like Gotti
But i'm still keep 33 i'm some like Scotti
I never be a lame, get changed, you think you finna rob me
And if you get smoked, tryna tweak, no I ain't sorry
Anybody get smoked especially when i'm off that molly
And if I heard that he sneak dissin' ima get him finally
Shots knock his head off, get offed up in the party
Gettin' risks, can't love a bitch, that's how i'm comin'
I've count so many checks i'm tired of thumbin'
And I do this for my team I mean 600
And free the ones thats locked down in that dungeon
I need that bag but first though I can't wait
And if an opp get in my lane i'll send em to a better place
Gettin' money make me smile, but you know these niggas love to hate
Bitch ima be on my way, no I can't wait
