I lost a lot
Diamonds like the sea, they came straight off the dock
Raised up in these streets, I came right off the block
Talkin' through your teeth, my shorty off your top, yeah
I lost a lot
Niggas watching me, you better watch a clock
Youngins shoot for free, they poppin' out with Glocks
Hitters off the leash, I got this shit on lock, yeah

Yeah, I lost a lot
Nigga, I'm not industry, I'm in the streets
I like getting money, I'm not into beef
I remember when the judge had sentenced me
They finished me, that hollow tip gon' change his memory
I'm still a G, them pussy niggas gon' remember me
Ain't lit as me, Tay did 500 thousand in a week
No chemistry, known in Virginia, back to Tennessee, yeah
Bitch ass, when I came back home, I said it's my year
Fake shit, they don't wanna see me at that top tier
Tough talk, I ain't scared of no many, only God fear
Long live L'A, live for my brother, so it's our year, yeah

I lost a lot
Diamonds like the sea, they came straight off the dock
