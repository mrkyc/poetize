C-Sick
They got Wooski on the mix

So much questions for the Lord, keep on asking "God, why?"
Tell them the story of my life that shit might make a nigga cry
Homies left me outta' nowhere I ain't get to say goodbye
Plan on grinding till I'm standing at that gate up in the sky
Cause I told Timtim I'm gone make it I couldn't lie
Really gifted with this music that some shit you can't deny
Can't let my foot up off they necks 'cause it's more pressure to apply
Ain't no love where I'm from, it's so much hate up in the Chi
Bodies dropping on the daily niggas scoring like A.I
Heard you plotting, pussy nigga, I can't wait for you to try
Show no mercy, I'm gone blast 'em in his face until he die
Whack a nigga, police searching now I'm way up in Dubai

Ayy
Look up in the sky
He steady tweaking he say that it's beef then I'm lurkin' on him like a spy
Pop me a perky and pour up the lean, everyday cause I gotta get high
I been a demon she swallow my semen then get around, you act shy, he can get shot in his eye
Thinkin' bout them times I seen them opps and damn near died
It's so many times I could've stopped but never tried
You ain't chasin' money then you might get left behind
See the hate don't work them niggas start to tellin' lies
I wish a nigga get fried cause he was playing with mines
She calling me, I'm pressing decline, I ain't even got the time
So many nights I been in the stu but I'm on the block with .9s
Get on the beats, I'm speakin the truth that shit so hard to find

Couldn't afford a lawyer in the county, fighting felonies
But since I came home it's like God keep on blessing me
Got it out the mud whole hood got respect for me
Back when I was young I used to care if they accepted me
Now all of they bitches look at me like a celebrity
They say "congratulations" but I still peep the jealousy
I been on my shit, I just been adding to my legacy
Watch it grow, I snorted them blows that shit affected me
Said I gotta make it I won't let this get the best of me
Bitch, where I was raised having Glocks is a necessity
Where shorties reckless, sparking they can't even aim it steadily
And hit the innocence might take a life or end a pregnancy

Youngins wildin' hanging in the streets just like it's sesame
I just mixed the codeine with the sprite like it's a recipe
All I tote is Glocks the only things that's in my weaponry
I seen my brother die my momma thought I needed therapy
People steady testing me
"Tay, you gotta chill" is what they tellin' me
I was on the blocks and shootin' opps ain't trynna' let it be
You gon' catch a bullet if you ever think you checkin' me
Even when you see my by myself I got that TEC with me
Step to me, drills and killin' opps is in my pedigree
Even when I'm chillin' tote a chopper, that .270
I just got the top from a new bop her name was Ebony
