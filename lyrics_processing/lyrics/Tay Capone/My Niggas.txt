I'm tryna sign with my niggas
Be on the grind with my niggas
Know I'ma ride for my niggas
Not wasting time with my niggas
I'm tryna eat with my niggas
Never compete with my niggas
Out on the streets with my niggas
Toting that heat for my niggas

I lost a couple niggas shit won't
Never be the same mane I'm still
Hurt but ill never let them see
The pain and I'm still out here
On stevedrive I mean how could I
Change my momma always told me
Never go against the grain 6hunna
So if you ain't from where I'm from
Please stay in yo lane we some real
Niggas so we gone do shit just for
The fame I know these niggas hate
Because we flyer than some planes
But if he ain't to much he get wet
Up just like the rain we need to
Eat so I got bros that's selling
I know they want me gone so I rock
With that felon we ride up on that
Man 6hunna what we yelling fuck hoes
Then kick em out we don't care about

Own ain't nobody help me smoking
So much strong i know a nigga smell
Me and i rock with that hammer so
