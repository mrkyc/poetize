Look...
Yeah, yeah

I'm a youngin', but I'm the man now
Ain't no .380's, and semi Glock's, and FN's now
The nation up in the building, so tell 'em stand down
He get to tweaking, that chopper gon' leave a man down
Remember nights, it was all-black from the head down
But now it's all white like I run with the Klan now
Most of them niggas I started with really fans now
They holding nuts, and they riding dicks for the cam now
I was really out there in the glacier
Steady catching cases cause I'm posed with the baker
Then I started rapping, I was tryna get my cake up
See me three years later, now I'm balling like the Lakers
Used to want a body, now I want a hundred acres
Buying everything, I used to have to pull them capers
Calling me a rat and never seen me in them papers
But them hoes that told, you niggas fucked 'em and embraced them
We did crime, talk about tine, I did mine
And you still lying, so you get hit with the steel nine
And that's real rhyme, it's going up like a hill climb
On my chill time, I'm pouring Act like I feel fine, and...
I'ma show you niggas y'all fucked up, you got the wrong one
Mamma told me, "Wait and just be patient, and it's gon' come!"
I remember days when I was broke and I ain't own nothing
It's fuck any nigga steady talking like I told something
No tit-for-tat, my niggas take your chain, and you can't get it back
And if he lack, we come through with them glizzies with the stick attached
I'm sipping Act, I got it in the bottle like it's Similac
Fuck chitter-chat, them youngings get to bussing at his fitted cap
Walk up on a nigga, do him dirty, I'm gon' finish that
Anyone who seen it, get him gone cause they can't witness that
Bitches on my dick, they wanna fuck cause my team getting sack
But when I was locked, I'm thinkin': "Damn, like, where my visit at?"
These bitches crazy, that's why I don't trust no woman, but the one that made me
Made it through the struggle, man, I swear she still amaze me
Talking all that shit, we pulling up just like the navy
Hit him with the MAC, and I got crack just like the '80's
Brought up in them trenches, been a savage since a baby
They say I'm conceited, I won't fuck unless she pay me
I'm too busy smoking blunts and leaning off the lazy

I do this for my family, they support me
My daddy had a M, I was shorty, and now he almost 40
I told him that I got him, so don't worry
I know he want the Beamer with the Forgi's, and the mansion with some stories
I gotta eat, this shit is mandatory
Fuck bitches and the fame, now that's a orgy
They used to treat me poorly
I told 'em, "I'ma ball like Robert Horry!"
I gotta charge a fee if you record me cause that's what it is
I used to pray for better days when I was a kid
And I still rap about them drills cause that's what I did
And you can catch me in the field cause that's where I live
They catch you lacking, you get killed out there where I live
I know you niggas wanna see me down
But it's the same niggas really wanna be me now
They used to see me in them cuffs, I'm on the TV now
That got a lot of leaching niggas wanna be around

Yeah, yeah
Lot of leaching niggas
I always keep it real, man
You know?
