I do this everyday for my brothers
And I will never change on my brothers
It wouldn't be the same without my brothers
And long live L'A, that was my brother
For my brothers, for my brothers
And I will never change on my brothers
It wouldn't be the same without my brothers
And long live L'A, that was my brother
For my brothers

L'A was my brother
That boy, you can't compare, he like no other
They took my brother and left me to suffer
But I'mma sing it right before the summer
For my brothers
Free all of my day ones
If I get caught, I won't say nothin'
Never change, I'm the same one
I guess it's cause where I came from
We tote shit, don't play or nothin'
Cuz we wackin' shit where I came from
See the cops and I play dumb
And I move around if they say "run"
R.I.P. some of my brothers
It's good to see some of my brothers
Can't mistreat none of my brothers
Cause everybody gon' leave one day or another

Steve Drive, them my brothers
Can't find you, just say goodbye to your mother
My brothers told me don't trust all these others
Those other niggas could be undercovers
I love my brothers
Say you real, then I need proof
Ruger on point when I say "Shoot"
Don't ever let goofies play you
Cause they gonna do what I say do
Goofies stunt and I play it cool
And they ain't gon' move when I say move
Shooters, no NBA hoop
But I'm ballin' like a 2K dude
I gotta take care of my brothers
I gotta be there for my brothers
Hell yeah, I'mma share with my brothers
Cuz ain't nobody gon' have your back like your brothers
