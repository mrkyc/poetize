And on that TEC it got a scope, so now you know it hit 'em
And yeah, there's hollows in them mops, so it's gon' fucking split him
And we got 50 round clip in them Glocks, that's for whoever with them
And I don't need nobody 'cause I'm savage
He talking shit, I go and catch his ass in traffic
I come up breaking backs no we ain't average
These niggas mad 'cause we balling like the Mavericks
Just don't approach me or we shooting like a basket
And now he gone and got no face, it's closed casket
These niggas think shit sweet but I ain't laughing
And yeah, them shells that knock down bricks, bitch, that's the FN
Boy, I still keep that Ruger close, bitch, that's my best friend
And on my block we got big guns like some off Tekken
By time we finish with that boy, he'll need a reverend
That 40 Smith & Wesson that's that lethal weapon
He said he caught me loafing, he ain't shoot
I told that boy you a fool
You should have stuck to the rules
'Cause if I see you, boom, on the news
Catch one body in the morning, 2 by noon
It's another man down coming soon
Bitch, I'm D'Thang with that tool
Hit him by surprise, he had no clue
I blow them racks and get it back that's for my jewels
Bitch, I'm EBK like Juvie Ju
You should have never wifed that bitch 'cause she gon' choose
I'm doing so much winning, I can't lose
And on my block we really fucking banging, nigga
