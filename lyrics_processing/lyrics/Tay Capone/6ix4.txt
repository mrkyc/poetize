She say I'm a silly muhfucka
Nigga I'm not fight, I tote 50's muhfucka
Faceshot, murder team, rest in peace to gang nigga
Folks gon' catch a opp and blow his brains nigga
Aye, cuz we had to
I wasn't in the classroom
Gettin' top in the bathroom
1 o'clock niggas be hearing them shots and bout 1:45 they be shootin again
Fuck niggas try to put dirt on my name but I never will stop cuz I knew I would win
I'm never slackin' I stay with my ratchet went down for a gun I won't do it again
Opp niggas lackin' we catch him in traffic but 2 in his face and put 2 in his friend
I did it once I'ma do it again
I'ma come thru start shootin' again
What should I drive in the Coupe or the Benz
Glock .22 I got 2 and they twins
Hop out I'm doing my thang, 50 shot thirty no aim
Slidin I'm lettin' it bang, do a fuck nigga like Cain
Most of these rappers is lame, pull up I'm takin' your chain (Gimme dat)
I was in them trenches, you was on the benches
Slide on a opp nigga solo, I be so dolo, mac on a string like a yoyo
I keep a stick like a pogo, ridin' in the low-low, it ain't a place that I won't go
Throw up a L for the logo, givin' him promo, feds steady tryna take photos
Ridin' in the cat it's a 4-door and it'don't go slow, doin the dash on the popo
He say he want it then fuck it we on it I'm givin' it out for a nigga that want smoke
My bitch ain't average I'm totin' that ratchet you know that I'm slingin' that gadget like GoGo
I'm by my lonely she tryna diss on me but I can not let the bitch fuck up my mojo
You lookin' for me you think I'm traffic I slide thru your hood on the bike like I'm JoJo
These niggas know that I'm straight from the go I pull up on your block I ain't doin' no drive-by
Tec with the beam and we up to no good you see me in your hood better duck when I slide by
I been a savage I'm not with the actin' the streets know wassup you not with it so why lie
I got a temper I be with the members the gang they all throwin' 3 bars like it's WiFi
Raised in the six, watchin' them flies
Stretchin' the opps, give em a high five
Red on his shirt, look like it's tie dye
Slide on a one, gettin' that die Y
And it's just me and the guys
Nigga don't look surprised
I see the look in your eyes
