I want you to love me like the first time, yeah
I want you to love me like the sun shines, yeah-heah
Girl, Imma make you feel good
Love you like a red blooded man should
Girl, I wanna love you like the first time

Listen I just wanna tell ya
You got the kiss that I wanna taste
And when we walk by the people all say
How lucky can a man get?
I wanna rock, I wanna roll
God help me, yeah, you save my soul
When you touch me I go losin' control
How lucky can a man get?
Straight to the top
Pot full of gold
Like honey dripping nice and slow
Sweet sugar she's my miracle
How lucky can a man get?

I want you to love me like the first time, yeah
Really keep me guessin' till I, till I cross the line
I take you back to my roots
Kiss you while I'm singin' "Blue Suede Shoes"
Girl, I wanna love you like the first time, oh!
