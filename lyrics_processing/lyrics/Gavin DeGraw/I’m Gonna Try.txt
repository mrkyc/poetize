I'm gonna try
Try like a mother, I'll make this one come around
Sing all through the night
Shaking the shutters, I know she'll be coming down
Hear the neighbors calling out names, well, I can't put up with that
So I'm gonna try
Try 'til I get it back

You don't know what she means to me
My reality and my fantasy
On the wave of confidence and gin

'Cause I just took a flight
To make it here tonight to say that I

I'm gonna try
Try like a mother, I'll make this one come around
Sing all through the night
Shaking the shutters, I know she'll be coming down
Hear the neighbors calling out names, well, I can't put up with that
So I'm gonna try
Try 'til I get it back

Sing all through the night
Shaking the shutters, I know she'll be coming down
Hear the neighbors calling out names, well, I can't put up with that

Try 'til I get it back

If she placed a bet on all
The chances that you'll waste and until then
Would you be standing?

I'm gonna try
Try like a mother, I'll make this one come around
Sing all through the night
Shaking the shutters, I know she'll be coming down
I'm gonna try
Try like a mother, I'll make this one come around
