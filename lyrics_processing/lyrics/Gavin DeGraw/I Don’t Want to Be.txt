I don't need to be anything other
Than a prison guard's son
I don't need to be anything other
Than a specialist's son
I don't have to be anyone other
Than a birth of two souls in one

Part of where I'm going
Is knowing where I'm coming from

I don't wanna be
Anything other than what I've been tryna be lately
All I have to do is think of me, and I have peace of mind
I'm tired of looking 'round rooms
Wondering what I've gotta do
Or who I'm supposed to be
I don't wanna be anything other than me

I'm surrounded by liars
Everywhere I turn
I'm surrounded by imposters
Everywhere I turn
I'm surrounded by identity crisis
Everywhere I turn

Am I the only one who noticed?
I can't be the only one who's learned

I don't wanna be
Anything other than what I've been tryna be lately
All I have to do is think of me, and I have peace of mind
I'm tired of looking 'round rooms
Wondering what I've gotta do
Or who I'm supposed to be
I don't wanna be anything other than me, ah

Can I have everyone's attention please?
If you're not like this and that
You're gonna have to leave
I came from the mountain
The crust of creation
My whole situation made from clay to stone
And now I'm telling everybody

I don't wanna be
Anything other than what I've been tryna be lately
All I have to do is think of me, and I have peace of mind
I'm tired of looking 'round rooms
Wondering what I've gotta do
Or who I'm supposed to be
I don't wanna be anything other than me
I don't wanna be, hey, yeah, hey, yeah
I don't wanna be, oh-oh
I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be anything
Anything other than me
(Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah) I don't wanna be (Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah) I don't wanna be (Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah)  I don't wanna be (Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah)
