Tryin', tired, but I'm tryin'
This hill I've been climbin'
No, I can't see the top
Old man, can he help me understand
Why I'm on this planet?
How do you know when to stop?

Workin' for a dollar
Well, that's how you make a man feel broke
Workin' for a dollar
That's the only thing I know

Just drive an old Ford
Count blessings and praise the Lord
Have less, make you feel like more
Leave work at the front door
Work hard and you get paid
Don't give 'em your best days
Only so many left to save
Some of 'em up for the ones worth savin' 'em for

La-la, la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la

Patience, I've run out of patience
I need a vacation, I need out of this shift
Skydive, maybe see how fast I can drive
Too young to not feel alive, and I'm caught in a ditch

Passin' me a bottle
Old man starts rollin' his own smoke
Says he lost me a dollar
Here's the only thing I know

Just drive an old Ford
Count blessings and praise the Lord
Have less, make you feel like more
Leave work at the front door
Work hard and you get paid
Don't give 'em your best days
Only so many left to save
Some of 'em up for the ones worth savin' 'em for

Once you found your love, you hold them close and say your name
No amount of money's gonna make you feel the same
Can't you see? Can't you see?
Just drive an old Ford
Count blessings and praise the Lord
Have less, make you feel like more
Leave work at the front door
Work hard and you get paid
Don't give 'em your best days
Only so many left to save
Some of 'em up for the ones worth savin' 'em for

La-la, la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la, la-la-la-la-la
