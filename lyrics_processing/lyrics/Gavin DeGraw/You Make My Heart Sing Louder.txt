I can hear it coming, feel it inside my bones
Oh, take me now, to the lake of fire
All of the hearts I have broken, hard as a rolling stone
Oh, it comes around, when you're out of time

This town I left for dead
Heart stopped, I had reached the end
That's when you raised my head and led me into the light
Walked me to the waterfall, slowly you removed it all
Set free my well and wall, you brought me back to life

'Cause you make my heart sing louder
High as the Eiffel Tower
And in the midnight hour
You give my love that power

When you would take me over, show me I'm not alone
You say you needing help, don't mean you not strong
Soon as the sky is falling and all that I had is gone
Oh, I fear no hell since you came along

This town I left for dead
Heart stopped, I had reached the end
That's when you raised my head and led me into the light
Walked me to the waterfall, slowly you removed it all
Set free my well and wall, you brought me back to life

'Cause you make my heart sing louder
High as the Eiffel Tower
And in the midnight hour
You give my love that power

You're lifting me up and setting me free
Showing me something I could believe
Giving me hope you know that I need
And I am blinded, by it
Open my heart I gave you my soul
Gave you permission, gave you control
Show me the world that I didn't know
Let me inside it, inside it

'Cause you make my heart sing louder
High as the Eiffel Tower
And in the midnight hour
You give my love that power
