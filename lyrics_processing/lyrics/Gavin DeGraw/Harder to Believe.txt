Back of your house, back of your neck
Goodbye to the innocence
I said, "Goodbye, I have no regrets
We're just living on a dream,"
Headstrong and a sugars tough
I got beat down and I drank too much
Got run over at the 911, but I, I'm still alive

To tell you the truth, I can't remember all the details
The hell I walked through, left me shirtless in the night

You only see what I reveal
My clothes, my phone, my home, my automobile
Just take my word, you wouldn't think
But there's more to my story, that you can't dream
I could let the words just fall out while you're listening to me
But the truth just makes it harder to believe

Letting me in, leading me on
Who knows where it's coming from
One go and it's just begun, but I, I'm closing in

To tell you the truth, I can't remember all the details
The hell I walked through, left me shirtless in the night

You only see what I reveal
My clothes, my phone, my home, my automobile
Just take my word, you wouldn't think
But there's more to my story, that you can't dream
I could let the words just fall out while you're listening to me
But the truth just makes it harder to believe

I wanted it so bad, more than I could really say
Nothing got in my way, oh woah, oh woah
But only you get there, you're waiting for the shoe to drop
All I'm saying is I just couldn't stop

Let it fall out
You only see what I reveal
My clothes, my phone, my home, my automobile, yeah
Just take my word, you wouldn't think
But there's more to my story, that you can't dream
I could let the words just fall out while you're listening to me
Said I'll let the words just fall out, while you're listening to me
