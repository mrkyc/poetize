I don't wanna get too close
I don't wanna get too close
See this isn't where my head is
If you knew me, I'm not like this

But I just found someone special
And that's really something special if you knew me
Nice to meet you anyway

I believe you're very fine
Still, I haven't got the time

'Cause I just found someone special
And that's really something special if you knew me
Nice to meet you anyway

And the sky opened up
With the soil of the sun
Dreaming of my true love

I don't mean to be so strange
But my life just took a change

'Cause I just found someone special
And that's really something special if you knew me
Nice to meet you anyway

And the sky opened up
With the soil of the sun
Dreaming of my true love

So before this goes too far
Let me tell you what you are
You're amazing, I'm attracted
But I'm terribly distracted
And I'm trying to be verbal
And I'm back into this circle

'Cause I just found someone special
And that's really something special if you knew me
Nice to meet you

Nice to meet you
Nice to meet you anyway
Nice to meet you anyway
Nice to meet you anyway
Nice to meet you anyway
And even if you want me to stay here
(Nice to meet you, nice to meet you anyway)
I'm telling you right now I should leave
(Nice to meet you, nice to meet you anyway)
Before I get to changing my mind, dear
(Nice to meet you, nice to meet you anyway)
I hope you understand what I mean
I hope you understand what I mean
I hope you understand what I mean
