Whenever I see you, I need more
And I want you to stay 'til the end
One look at that smile and I'm all yours
Will you just smile at me again?

I have you to thank for making me so
So hard to please because you treated me so
Good that no one else could hold your make-up
Because of you, girl, I never wanna break up

The difference I'm feeling in my heart
Is the difference of loving or not
And under the stars and moon and sun
Is the perfect becoming of one

I have you to thank for making me so
So hard to please because you treated me so
Good that no one else could hold your make-up
Because of you, girl, I never wanna break up

If I told you that I loved like an ace
Then I'd be lying 'cause I've made some mistakes
But I'm trying with perfect faith
When I let you in
I began to win
And now I'm just all gold
After all I've done
And the road I've run
I wanna thank you
I wanna thank you
