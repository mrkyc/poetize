Some girls want bright diamonds
Some girls wanna stick like glue
Not her, no, she's a little different
She ain't into things everybody seems to lose
This girl's got her own reputation
Everybody's got somethin' to prove
She said "Don't you know what I'm thinkin'?
A little bit of me and a whole lot of you"

So free, you know what I mean
Somethings you just can't keep

She might take her coat off
Tell you that she's gonna stay, yeah
Lay you down and float off
She's a kite like girl, you gotta let her fly away, hey
Let her fly away
She's a kite like girl, you gotta let her fly away, hey

She's as light as a feather
But she'll kick off of her cloud
Got nothin' to do with the weather
When you're wakin' up alone and she's nowhere to be found
We all wanna live in the moment
Always talkin' 'bout the here and the now
New bucks sellin' old religion
She's still the only one knowin' what I talk about

Let her fly away
She's a kite like girl, you gotta let her fly away, hey

And if she takes you to the top, don't look down
This girl is not that innocent
And if she's lettin' you drop, there'll be no sound
She'll be playin' your heart, are you listenin'?

She might take her coat off
