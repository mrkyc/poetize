Dancing around
Knocking back
Knocking down you go all night
All night
Blow 'em away
Pourin' it on
Laugh at the jokes
Sing a few songs you know all right
All right
Gettin' all, gettin' all, gettin' all their attention
Now you're takin' 'em, takin' 'em, takin' 'em for a ride
All right
Oh Annalee, Annalee
Don't you know I'm on to you?
Your eyes are bright as chandeliers
But I see the truth
Your mystery, Annalee
Got them falling from the roof
Hypnotized and paralyzed but
That's nothing new
Annalee, you know that
I'm onto you
See Gavin DeGraw LiveGet tickets as low as $35You might also likeFresh out of jail
Left Santa Fe
Making your rounds out in LA, look at you now, oh wow
They're buying you rings
Giving you cars
It's never enough, you turn their hearts all inside out, side out
Gettin' all, gettin' all, gettin' all their attention
Takin' 'em, takin' 'em, takin' 'em for a ride
Every time
Oh Annalee, Annalee
Don't you know I'm on to you?
Your eyes are bright as chandeliers
But I see the truth
Your mystery, Annalee
Got them falling from the roof
Hypnotized and paralyzed but
That's nothing new
Annalee, you know that
I'm onto you
It started with a white lie
You thought it was a good time
Now they got the fever
Oh be bop a lula
Now everybody wants you
But I'm looking right through
And I want to tell you
Get yourself together girl 'cause nothing lasts forever
Oh Annalee, Annalee
Don't you know I'm on to you?
Your eyes are bright as chandeliers
But I see the truth
Your mystery, Annalee
Got them falling from the roof
Hypnotized and paralyzed but
That's nothing new
Annalee, Annalee
La-da, la-da-da-da-da
La-da-da-da-da-da, da-na-na-na-na
Annalee, you know that
