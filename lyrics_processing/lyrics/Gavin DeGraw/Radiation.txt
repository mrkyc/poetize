I'll lay it down one time, gather 'round
Though this is a chore
So rich with lies I prefer poor advice
And showed her the door
This is your goodbye and kiss opportunity
Thought you were burning me down
But I'm finally free, yeah

If you miss me, don't
If I never wanna see you again, I won't
If you get an invitation, I'm probably drunk
You're just as hot as radiation
But I'll mend this situation

Oh, the sun came up
Tell me where'd I park
We did it again
We had some fun did some things we got dumb
But I want it to end
'Cause I only give in when I get the need
I'm only coming around 'cause I get to leave

If you miss me, don't
If I never wanna see you again, I won't
If you get an invitation, I'm probably drunk
You're just as hot as radiation
But I'll mend this situation

Can't breathe, I can't sleep
Thinking 'bout the best of you and
Some things I couldn't see
What about the rest of you?
Well, you're under my skin
But I can't let you win
Though you don't see scars
That's exactly what they are, baby

Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
Ooh, oh (Na na na na na na)
Baby, baby, baby
You're never gonna hurt me

If you miss me don't
If I never wanna see you again, I won't
If you get an invitation, I'm probably drunk
You're just as hot as radiation
But I'm in this situation
If you miss me, don't
If I never wanna see you again, I won't
If you get an invitation
I'm probably drunk
You're just as hot as radiation
But I'm in this situation
Na na na na na na na na
Yes I am
Na na na na na na na na
I gotta get out
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
If you miss me (Na na na na na na na na)
If you miss me, if you miss me (Ooh, oh)
Na na na na na na na na
