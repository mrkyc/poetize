I tried giving up
Walked through quite enough
Had to call it a day
From an ex who showed up falling to
Grand piano falling on the edge of the parkway
Got no good advice
Hotline called me twice
Said, "I went through the wall
Do you have a quote to lend me
Or a friend to send me?"
But I got no help at all

So I loosened my lips
And let a little prayer I memorized
Do what I just wished
And suddenly, to my surprise

Oh, DJ, when you play my song
Make me feel bigger than an old King Kong
At the risk of this coming out wrong
Feel like making love with the radio on
Oh, every time I hear that jam
Grabbed my baby right by her hand
Even if my day was going all wrong
Feel like making love with the radio on

You're my medicine
Light it like Edison
Turned it right up to the sky
You're my absolutely fictional
Pure perfection
My Venetian boat ride
Blown out speakers
And worn out tweeters
And still I get the effect
If you got my go-to living
It'll get me in the spirit
Even if I'm a complete wreck

Don't you call it a flaw
Everybody needs some a peace of mind
It should be the law
To take a little private time

Oh, DJ, when you play my song
Make me feel bigger than an old King Kong
At the risk of this coming out wrong
Feel like making love with the radio on
Oh, every time I hear that jam
Grabbed my baby right by her hand
Even if my day was going all wrong
Feel like making love with the radio on
I want to feel like this, so hold me forever
Emotions are real like this and flow like a river
And you are the only one

Oh, DJ, when you play my song
Make me feel bigger than an old King Kong
At the risk of this coming out wrong
Feel like making love with the radio on

Oh, every time I hear that sound
Engine running and I'm homeward bound
Even if my day was going all wrong
Feel like making love with the radio on

With the radio, with the radio
Feel like making love with the radio on
With the radio, with the radio
Feel like making love with the radio on
With the radio, with the radio
With the radio on
