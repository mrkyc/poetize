Want someone else in the moment
Speed in the Jeep and a Rover
Downgrade my Bentley to a Skoda
Smashing my XBox controller
Get my energy from solar
Harsh condition in the polar
Felt lonely so I called her
What a full on mistake
Shouldn't have done that
Get ready to break at the fall and attack
When she threatening me when she's pissed on crack
She never loved me, the hurtful fact
I'm alone, solo in the game
Always fucked off so I guess that's a shame
Point for the kill gotta go for the brain
Die with the sight and focus with the aim
Guess we're to be with the three and four
Who the fuck's spinning with the ligament torn
Just like my heart and I had it before
With many girls that showed me fake love
And the fake love never gets enough
First heard of and my feelings are up
Couldn't love you any fucking more
Left me paralysed and my heart is up
You might also likeI am up
Not a single flaw
But still endure
All the pain and more
And it's sad to see, not you and me
You're only down the street and I choose to flee
And I don't wanna know, where you go
For the third time I need to be alone
And you spent one hundred on a new whip
And I wanna be living my life in it
Believe me I did hear what you said
But fucked around and wound up dead
Down in a ditch with three bullets in my head
Rock to a skull, it cracked like a neck
So down, fragile in the sad songs
Boo-hoo stories and you're starting to sob
And my heart for stopped beating
And my brain is gone
Tell a story that you once heard of
Don't wanna live this life alone
Want someone else in the moment
Speed in the Jeep and a Rover
Downgrade my Bentley to a Skoda
Smashing my XBox controller
Get my energy from solar
Harsh condition in the polar
Felt lonely so I called her
What a full on mistake
Shouldn't have done that
Get ready to break at the fall and attack
When she threatening me when she's pissed on crack
She never loved me, the hurtful fact
I'm alone, solo in the game
Always fucked off so I guess that's a shame
Point for the kill gotta go for the brain
Die with the sight and focus with the aim
Guess we're to be with the three and four
Who the fuck's spinning with the ligament torn
Just like my heart and I had it before
With many girls that showed me fake love
And the fake love never gets enough
First heard of and my feelings are up
Couldn't love you any fucking more
