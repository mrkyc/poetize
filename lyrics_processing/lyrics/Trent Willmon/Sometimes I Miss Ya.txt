With a cold one in my hand
It's eighty-eight in the shade;
I got the bait in an old tin can
An' ol' Blue's been a barkin'
At the bobber on the end of my pole
Yeah, sometimes I miss you, baby:
Most the time, I don't
Sundown, I go down
Shoot the bull at Ernie's bar
An' the boys in the band'll let me stand in
An' play guitar
The bar-keep'll let me camp out in the corner
If I can't can't make it home
Yeah, sometimes I miss you, baby:
Most the time, I don't
Yeah, sometimes I miss your big city lovin'
An' the way you sparkle like Hollywood
You can't blame a country boy for tryin'
An' I, I did the best I could;
I did the best I could
I sold all the cows an' put it down
On a house you just had to have
You changed your mind, but that's all right:
We only lost about nine or ten grand
An' by the time your new boyfriend - slash - lawyer
Came to pick you up in his shiny new Jaguar, I was flat broke
Sometimes I miss you, baby:
But most the time, I don't
You might also likeYeah, sometimes I miss your sweet lovin'
An' your high heels, you look so good
But nothin's worse than an unhappy woman
An' I, I did the best I could;
I did the best I could
I take your photograph to my dart board
An' I take careful aim at your picture;
An' sometimes, sometimes
Sometimes, I miss ya
Sometimes I miss your lovin'
An' your high heels, you look so good
You can't blame a country boy for tryin'
An' I, I did the best I could;
I did the best I could
I did the best I could
Now, I'm laid up on a creek-bank
