So it seems to me it shouldn't be a crime
But there's a way of thinking around here
That astounds me
You can work all day in the summer sweat
And go down to the store to get your vessel wet
But a Dr. Pepper's all you're gonna get
Sorry, it's a dry county
But if you take a right off the 35
Just across the county line
There's a neon sign and a cute little waitress
Smiling at me
If I stay and hang around here
Keep begging my buddies for bootleg beer
My dreams might wither up and die around me
It's a dry county
It ain't rained around here in so damn long
You can see it when an old timer tells a joke
You don't smile, you just keep playing dominoes
And drink your coffee
30 miles to the east it's a lot more green
And they got more green for the football team
Around here we ain't seen a winning streak since the 80s
It's a dry county

Just across that county line
There's a neon sign and a cute little waitress
Smiling at me
If I stay and hang around here
Keep begging my buddies for bootleg beer
My dreams might wither up and die around me
It's a dry county
Last time I took Betty to the drive-in
I couldn't even talk her into a little kiss
You couldn't loosen her up
With a whole can of WD40
But if you take a right off the 35
Just across that county line
And there's a neon sign and a cute little waitress
Smiling at me
I can't stay and hang around here
Waste away the best of my years
So goodbye all, promise I'll call
I had about all of this dry county
