Around around the sun, the earth just keeps revolving
And the rosebuds know to bloom in early May
Just as hate knows love's the cure
You can rest your mind assure
That I'll be loving you always
Now can reveal the mysteries of tomorrow
But in passing, will grow older every day
Just as all is born is new
Do know what I say is true
That I'll be loving you always

Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky (Always)
Until the ocean covers every mountain high (Always)
Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea (Always)
Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream

Did you know it's true love asks for nothing?
Her and second G's'll waive the pay
Did you know that life has given love a guarantee
To last to forever, another day?
Just as time knows to move on since the beginning
And the season know exactly when to change
Just as kindness knows no shame
Know through all your joy and pain
That I'll be loving you always
As today, I know I'm living, but tomorrow
Would make me the past, but that, I mustn't fear
For I'll know deep in my mind
The love of me I left behind
'Cause I'll be loving you always

Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky (Always)
Until the ocean covers every mountain high (Always)
Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea (Always)
Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream

Did you know it's true love asks for nothing?
Her and second G's'll waive the pay
Did you know that life has given love a guarantee
To last to forever, another day?
As today, I know I'm living, but tomorrow
Would make me the past, but that, I mustn't fear
For I'll know deep in my mind
The love of me I left behind
'Cause I'll be loving you always

Until the day is night and night becomes the day (Always)
Until the trees and seas just up and fly away (Always)
Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four (Always)
Until the day that is the day that are no more (To be loved by somebody)
Until the day the earth starts turning right to left (To be loved by somebody, yeah)
Until the earth just for the sun denies itself (Always)
Until dear Mother Nature says her work is through (Always)
Until the day that you are me and I am you (Always)
Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky
Until the ocean covers every mountain high (Always)
