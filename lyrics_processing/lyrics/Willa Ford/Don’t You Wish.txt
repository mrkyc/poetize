Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Ah-ah)

Da-da, da-da, da-da, da-da
Da-da, da-da, da-da, da-da (Ah-ah)
Da-da, da-da, da-da, da-da
Da-da, da-da, da-da, da-da

Wake up, it's 4 A.M
Looked up at my clock, started dreaming of you again
All the time, you act so blind
I know you see a girl in heat, feeling and reading your body
Damn, you're such a nice hottie, well-built body
I got a ploy, how 'bout a boytoy
She doesn't need to know about us
And it wouldn't change a thing, I know

You're looking for the stable-not-going-anywhere-type
Don't stay out all night
And, I don't care 'bout that much, no
I just wanna be your wish

Don't you wish if only for a night or two
All the things I'd love to do
New temptations calling you
Don't I wish that you will leave your woman's arms
Capture you with all my charms
Just to have my way with you

Da-da, da-da, da-da, da-da (Da, da-da-da-da)
Da-da, da-da, da-da, da-da (Ah-ah, da-da-da-da)
Da-da, da-da, da-da, da-da
Da-da, da-da, da-da, da-da

Dear God
I'm never ever gonna be her, no way
A guy can't hold me down
Gotta do my things (Got to do my thing)
I wanna be bad with you
I, I, I, I
That's all, can't you see?
Understand, be my man
Just one night, hold me tight
Hold me tighter and tighter
Til' I tell you to stop
No, I didn't mean stop
I meant go, go
Come to me

You're looking for the stable-not-going-anywhere-type
Don't stay out all night
And I don't care 'bout that much, no
All I want is just one wish
Don't you wish
If only for a night or two (If only for a night or two)
All the things I'd love to do (I'd love to do)
New temptations calling you (It's calling you)
Don't I wish
That you will leave your woman's arms (Leave your woman's arms)
Capture you with all my charms
Just to have my way with you (Oh, hey)

I'd love to do, I'd love to do, I'd love to do to you

You (You)
Boy, all the funny things you do (You do)
They make me wanna get with you (Get with you)
Ooh, ooh (Ooh)
I'd love to be with (I, I)
Get close
To feel it all up in my soul (In my soul)
You say you're gonna take me home with you
I don't know what to do
What the hell I'm gon' do?

Da-da, da-da, da-da, da-da
