You want the truth?
Here it is

Manufactured is this hot pop industry
I know 'cause they tried to do it to me
Don't you let them (No) take away your eyes
Be who you are and stop the sweet talkin' lies

And you're never gonna see me lip-synch
And you're never gonna see me try to cheat
'Cause I'm not the one who won't break it down
Follow me and you'll see
That I'm gonna blow the roof off of this town

Tired of the clones that look like me
Tired of you people saying "Britney"
I'm tired of the pop that should flop that should never be on TV
And in your teen magazines
I'm tired of the crap I take each day
Trying to do my songs
Trying to do it my way
I'm tired of the pop that should flop that should never be on TV
And in your teen magazines, yeah
Tired of the pop

Shame
It's the game you play for fame
But give it some time
You won't remember their names
Some you will, some you won't
It's those one-hit wonder melodies who cannot sing a note

And you're never gonna see me lip-synch
And you're never gonna see me try to cheat
'Cause I'm not the one who won't break it down
Follow me, and you'll see
That I'm gonna blow the roof off of this town

Tired of you people saying "Britney" (No, no, no)
I'm tired of the pop that should flop that should never be on TV
And in your teen magazines

Trying to do my songs (Just trying to do my thing)
Trying to do it my way
I'm tired of the pop that should flop that should never be on TV
And in your teen magazines, yeah
Tired of the clones that look like me (Like me)
Tired of you people saying "Britney"
