Ah-ah, ah-ya
Ah

Please, baby boy, don't you know what I need?
Not your blame, not your cheese
Got my face on magazines
Spent like an elder, I been around this game
I don't have my fame, claim to my name
It's your body that I'm after
Like to eat you off a plate or a platter
Jump up on your head, show you why I'm the master
This button you eatin' sayin'
"Daddy, do it faster"

All I wanna do is scream
Boy, you make me wanna moan
Can you tell I'd like to hide?
Like to scream, like to
Ah, ah, ah

Talk about a girl who can please, boy, I got it
On my knees, doin' what you need, boy, I got it
Talk about the arch in my back, boy, I got it
Now you know about it
Time to get goddamn erotic
Talk about your needs, boy, I got it
On my knees, doin' what you please, boy, I got it
Talk about the arch in my back, boy, I got it
Now you know about it
Time to get goddamn erotic
