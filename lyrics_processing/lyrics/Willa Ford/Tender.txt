Hey
Can I talk to you for a minute?
You see, it's not you
It's just, well
I've been in love before
And I've had my heart broken
I can't go through that again, ya know?

If I let you in my world completely
Would you let me down
And break my heart?
'Cause sometimes love can come and go
And I don't want to cry no more
So tell me, boy

If I showed you how you control my mind
Would you hold it against me
And take advantage of me?
And if I showed you love
From within my soul
Don't take advantage of me
Because my heart is tender
You might also like
So tell me, how are you feeling now?
Just let me know
Will you stick around forever? Oh
We're in too deep to turn away
From what's meant to be
Let's let our love shine
Just be careful with my heart, no

If I showed you how (Oh-oh, no) you control my mind
Would you hold it against me (Don't you hold it against me)
And take advantage of me?
And if I showed you love
From within my soul
Don't take advantage of me
Because my heart is tender (Tender, tender)
Hey, oh-oh

Boy, you got me (Boy, you got me)
So, be careful with me (So, be careful)
I'm so tender, that's me (Tender, that's me)
It's for you only (For you only)
So please don't hurt me
Baby, give me love
If I showed you how you control my mind (Oh)
Would you hold it against me (Would you hold me?)
And take advantage of me? (Take advantage of me)
And if I showed you love (Oh-oh)
From within my soul (You know)
Don't take advantage of me (Oh, no)
Because my heart is tender (Tender)
If I showed you how (No, no, no, no)
You control my mind
Would you hold it against me?
(If I give you my heart, will you always be there?)
And take advantage of me?
And if I showed you love
From within my soul
Don't take advantage of me
Because my heart is tender
If I showed you how (Showed you, showed you)
You control my mind
Would you hold it against me (Give me your heart, boy)
And take advantage of me?
