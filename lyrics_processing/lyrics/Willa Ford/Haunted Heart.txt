Ooh-ooh
Hey, hey
Ooh-ooh

The candle, pictures of you
The things I, I plan to do to
You won't see until I'm done
My potion has just begun

Now you feel obsessed for me
You're wanting more, you're needing me
In sleep, you dream and think of us
And when you wake, you're still in love
I change your thoughts, your mind's not clear
Except for what I make you feel
I know my magic's taking hold
You're losing all your self-control

Once I make a spell, I'll haunt you
You're haunted (You're haunted)
You know you are (You know you are)
There's no way you can get away from (Ooh, baby)
You're haunted (You're haunted)
You're haunted heart (Hey, yeah)
You might also like
My wish is your command
I've got you in the palm of my hand
With one touch, you're mine for good (Mine for good)
It's working just the way I planned it would

Now you feel obsessed for me
You're wanting more, you're needing me (Oh-oh)
In sleep, you dream and think of us
And when you wake you're still in love
(You're still in love with me)
I change your thoughts, your mind's not clear
Except for what I make you feel
I know my magic's taking hold
You're losing all your self-control

Once I make a spell, I'll haunt you (Oh yeah)
You're haunted (Hey)
You know you are (You know you are)
There's no way you can get away from (Oh-oh, yeah)
Your haunted
Your haunted heart (Your haunted heart)
Once I make a spell, I'll haunt you (Hey, yeah)
You're haunted (You're obsessed with me)
You know you are (Now I want you, baby)
There's no way you can get away from (There's no way)
Your haunted
Your haunted heart
I came to you in the mist last night
(Through the window, I crept by your side)
You want me, and I want you, oh
But now I can see
You cast your spell on me too

Once I make a spell, I'll haunt you (Haunted)
You're haunted (Haunted)
You know you are
Once I make a spell
With one touch, you're mine for good
Haunted
Your haunted heart
Oh no, no, no
Once I make a spell, I'll haunt you (Oh-oh-oh)
You're haunted (You know, know, know)
You know you are (You know you are)
There's no way you can get away from (You, you)
Your haunted (Your haunted)
Your haunted heart
(Oh-oh-oh)
Once I make a spell
I'll haunt you
Your haunted
You know you are (You know you are)
There's no way you can get away from (You're haunted, you're haunted)
Your haunted
Your haunted heart (Your haunted heart)
Once I make a spell
I'll haunt you
You're haunted
You know you are
There's no way you can get away from
Your haunted
Your haunted heart
Once I make a spell
I'll haunt you
You're haunted
You know you are
There's no way you can get away from
Your haunted
Your haunted heart
Once I make a spell
I'll haunt you
You're haunted
