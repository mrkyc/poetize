Nasty lady
Mmm, mmm

What do they see
Looking at you?
Could they see a dare?
(Could they see a dare? Show them that you care)
Gazing eyes and wandering minds
Are coming after you (Coming after you, this is what to do)

As you're standing there
As he steps your way
Steps across the floor
Coming on to you
Here is what you do
Do exactly what I say

Nasty ladies
Show them what they really want (Watch and follow me)
Say what they really want
Nasty nasty nasty nasty
And what they really need (Nasty, nasty, nasty, nasty)
Now listen to me sing (Nasty, nasty, nasty, nasty)
Now sing it back to me (Nasty, nasty, nasty, nasty)
(Oh)
You might also like
Listen up, boys
You should know
I taught the ladies (I taught them very well)
Show them you can tell
Out to own you
They'll control your thoughts
And haunt your dreams

As you're standing there
As he steps your way
Cross the floor, woo
Coming on to you
Here is what you do
Do exactly what I say

Nasty lady, show them what they really want
(Watch and follow me)
And follow me, my baby
Say what they really want (Nasty, nasty, nasty, nasty)
And what they really need (Nasty, nasty, nasty, nasty)
Now listen to me sing (Nasty, nasty, nasty, nasty)
Now sing it back to me (Nasty, nasty, nasty, nasty)
(Oh)
And it feels so good, you can't let go
Your body goes in overload
You cannot hide the way you feel
It makes you feel, It feels so real
Oh-ohh

Say what they really want (Nasty, nasty, nasty, nasty)
And what they really need (Nasty, nasty, nasty, nasty)
Now listen to me sing (Nasty, nasty, nasty, nasty)
(Oh)
Nasty ladies
Show them what they really want (Watch and follow me)
And follow me, my baby
Nasty ladies (Nasty lady)
Show them what they really want (Nasty lady)
Watch and follow me (Nasty lady, oh)
Nasty ladies (Nasty lady)
Show them what they really want (Nasty lady)
Watch and follow me (Oh)

Bring it on, come to me
If you're really nasty (Nasty)
Let me know, we can go
If you want (Nasty)
Nasty, c'mon
I said, nasty, ooh
Nasty, c'mon
