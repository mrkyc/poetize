Prince Charming, can you rescue me?
Are you real?
Can you make me feel, feel unreal?
Prince Charming
Oh yeah, oh-oh
Prince Charming

Rides a great white horse
Not a Greyhound bus
He's a gentleman
Not a hip-hop thug
See him in my dreams
Hate when I wake up
Standing, holding on
People think I'm nuts

But soon he'll come and call for me
And take me from reality

Prince Charming, can you rescue me?
Are you real?
Can you make me feel, feel unreal?
Prince Charming, I believe in you
Fairy tales can come true
So I will wait for you

Prince Charming
Oh yeah, oh-oh

Tell me how I'll know
Does he wear a crown?
Haven't found him yet
Must be out of town
Heart made of gold
Body like a rock
Likes to serenade
Maybe even smart

And I will wait with just one kiss (Just one kiss)
The poison soon wiped from my lips

Prince Charming, can you rescue me?
Are you real?
Can you make me feel, feel unreal?
Prince Charming, I believe in you
Fairy tales can come true
So I will wait for
Prince Charming, can you rescue me? (Prince Charming, oh-oh)

Oh-oh

Oh-oh-oh
