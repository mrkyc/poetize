Girls, I'd like to make a toast on the behalf of men
Here's to the men we love
Here's to the men who love us
Here's to the men we love who dont love us
F**k the men, let's drink to us!
Here's to the men we love to love
Here's to the men in love with us
Here's to the men who pass on us
Ah ah
Ooh
(WILLA)
Thats right boys!
(LADY MAY (rap))
There was this tatoo artist partied for hours
Huge in the pants loved to screw in the shower
Bitch done keyed up his new Eddie Bauer
I shulda dumped him but I was too coward
Til I met this school-boy that studied at Howard
Nerdy but he calls and be sendin' me flowers
I'm feelin him, but had to get rid of him
Nerd boy turned out to be a minute-man
(CHORUS)
Here's to the men we love to love
Here's to the men in love with us
Here's to the men who pass on us
F**k the men, Let's drink to us y'all
Here's to the men we love to love
Here's to the men in love with us
Here's to the men who pass on us
F**k the men, Let's drink to us y'all
(LADY MAY (rap))
I've been with boys with baldies, boys with hair curly
Boy's in their 30's, boys that ain't worthy
Boys I fell for, slept with too early
Boys with dicks straight, Boys with dicks curvy
Boys locked up in the bing
I f**ked boys in hotels, motels, Holiday Inns
All this talk men is ridiculous
F**k the men, let's drink to us!

Willa has something to say
(WILLA)
Thanks Lady May
Take it on now girls give the eyes what they want to see
Take it on now girls be whatever you want to be
Crazy ladies, tight-ass bodies
Let'em know we come to party
Live it up now boys got your eyes on that lady
Live it up now 'cause she won't be your baby
Go home lonely, leave you horny, it's a girls night after party
F**k'em all 'cause men don't have nothing but dicks on us
F**k'em all 'cause they soft then beg us to strap on us
Get your big "O"., no love making
Let him know his bitch was fakin'
Here's to the men we love to love
(Hmm I wonder who that could be?)
Here's to the men in love with us
Here's to the men who pass on us
F**k the men, Let's drink to us y'all
Here's to the men we love to love
Here's to the men in love with us
Here's to the men who pass on us
F**k the men, Let's drink to us
Here's to the men we love to love
Here's to the men in love with us
Here's to the men who pass on us
F**k the men, Let's drink to us
Ooh Ooh!
Oh my God - did I just say that?
That's right girls - There's a sorority anthem for ya!
