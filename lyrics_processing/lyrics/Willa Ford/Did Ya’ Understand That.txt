Ooh, hey, da da da
(Bop bop, da da da da)
(Bop bop, da da da da)
(Bop bop, da da da da)
Ohh-oh
(Bop bop, da da da da)
(Bop bop, da da da da)

Sometimes I wish that I could be the person that you are
Just for a minute
Long enough that I can break your heart
Can you even comprehend?
Or did you even understand a single word that I said?

I wonder why you do the things that, boy, you do to me
I can't imagine why you treated me so horribly
Are you listening to me?
Are you trying to ignore me?
Do I stutter when I speak?

What you gonna do, baby?
What you gonna say?
I'm cutting you loose 'cause I've got no time for you
Who you gonna run to?
Who you gonna blame?
It's a matter of fact
I won't look back
You might also like
I don't want you, I don't need you
So let me tell you where it's at
I'm through with you
Did ya' understand that?
I don't want you, I don't love you
Hit the road, Jack
'Cause I'm through with you
Did ya' understand that?
(Bop a bop) Oh

Sometimes I wish that you could be the person that I am
So you can feel inside exactly what I'm feeling (yYah)
Maybe then you'd understand (Understand)
How to treat a lady
How to be a real man
You can't imagine what I think of when I think of you (Think of you)
I see a sucker
Not the person that I though I knew
Will you ever comprehend? (Comprehend)
Maybe you can keep it going, but I can't pretend

What you gonna do, baby?
What you gonna say?
I'm cutting you loose 'cause I've got no time for you
Who you gonna run to?
Who you gonna blame?
It's a matter of fact
I won't look back
I don't want you, I don't need you
(Oh-oh, don't need you)
So let me tell you where it's at (Where it's at)
I'm through with you
Can you understand that?
I don't want you, I don't love you
Hit the road, Jack
'Cause I'm through with you
Did ya' understand that?
(Bop a bop)

I used to be the only girl (I used to be)
That you lived for (That you lived for)
You didn't need nothing more (You didn't need nothing more)
Jaded eyes (Jaded eyes)
So I'm confused when I'm around you (When I'm around you)
What is this girl to do? Oh-oh

What you gonna do, baby?
What you gonna say?
I'm cutting you loose 'cause I've got no time for you
Who you gonna run to?
Who you gonna blame?
It's a matter of fact
I won't look back
I don't want you, I don't need you
So let me tell you where it's at (Let me tell you)
I'm through with you (I'm through with you)
Did ya' understand that?
I don't want you, I don't love you
So hit the road, Jack (Oh my god)
I'm through with you (I won't look back)
Did ya' understand that?
I don't want you, I don't need you
So let me tell you where it's at
I'm through with you
Did ya' understand that? (Jaded eyes)
I don't want you, I don't love you
So hit the road, Jack
I'm through with you (I won't)
