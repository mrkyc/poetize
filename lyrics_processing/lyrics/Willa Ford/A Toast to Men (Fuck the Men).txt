Girls, I'd like to make a toast on the behalf of men
Here's to the men we love
Here's to the men who love us
Here's to the men we love who don't love us
Fuck the men, let's drink to us!

Here's to the men we love to love
Here's to the men in love with us
Here's to the men who pass on us (Ah, ah)

Ooh
That's right, boys
Oh, let's get
Ah, naughty

There was this tattoo artist, partied for hours (What?)
Huge in the pants, loved to screw in the shower
Bitch done keyed up his new Eddie Bauer (Uh-uh)
I shoulda dumped him but I was too coward
Till I met this schoolboy that studied at Howard (Mhm)
Nerdy, but he calls and be sending me flowers
I'm feeling him but had to get rid of him
Nerd boy turned out to be a minute-man

I've been with boys with baldies
Boys with hair curly, boys in their 30s
Boys that ain't worthy
Boys I fell for, slept with too early (Mhm)
Boys with dicks straight (Ooh)
Boys with dicks curvy (Oh, shit)
Boys locked up in the bing
I fucked boys in hotels, motels, Holiday Inns (Uh-huh)
