Once there was love
And I was a fool
Once there was us
But it was all about you
I was too blind to see it
Then I woke up
Then I came down
It was only a dream
'Cause you were not around

Oh, you're not around, not around
You had me feeling I was crazy
Ooh, without a doubt, baby

Every time you told me one of your lies
And every time you could not look in my eyes
You told me what I knew, oh baby
'Cause every time you thought I would be true
And every time you played around, I did too
Well, baby, now I guess the jokes on you

Once there was trust
Now there's no more
Enough is enough
I am walking out the door
Don't try to stop me, baby
It could've been good
It could've been right
I could've been me
Always by your side
You might also like
Oh, right by your side, right by your side
But now you'll never have this, baby, I
I'm feeling sorry for you
Baby, yeah

Every time you told me one of your lies
And every time you could not look in my eyes (Yeah, yeah)
You told me what I knew, oh baby
(You told me what I knew, oh baby)
'Cause every time you thought I would be true
And every time you played around, I did too
Well, baby, now I guess the joke's on you

You, that's all I need to know
You couldn't give enough
No way, no
Time for you to watch the show on you
How's it feeling knowing I did you wrong?

Every time you told me (Oh baby) one of your lies
And every time you could not (Baby, baby, baby) look in my eyes
You told me what I knew, oh baby
(You told me what I knew, baby)
'Cause every time you thought I would be true
And every time you played around, I did too
