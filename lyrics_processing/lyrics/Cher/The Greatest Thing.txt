I don't know why you hurt inside,
Or what was said to make you cry
I hope that you can see you are the greatest thing to me

I don't wa-wanna waste another day
Without telling you
That, baby, you're great
And I can see it written on your face
G-R-E-A-T is something you can't fake

'Cause when I'm with you, I fall apart (fall apart)
To heal your permanently broken heart (broken heart)
Baby, you're the greatest to me
No, no matter what, what, what

I don't know why you hurt inside
Or what was said to make you cry
I hope that you can see you are the greatest thing to me
And when you're feeling like you're not enough
I'll give you wings, I'll lift you up
I hope that you can see you are the greatest, greatest thing to me
When all your thoughts are dark and insecure
I'll build you a light
'Cause baby, I'm sure that loving you has made me better
I'll take all your shadows and make sure that you shine

'Cause when I'm with you, I fall apart (fall apart)
To heal your permanently broken heart (broken heart)
Baby, you're the greatest to me
No, no matter what, what, what

I don't know why you hurt inside
Or what was said to make you cry
I hope that you can see you are the greatest thing to me
And when you're feeling like you're not enough
I'll give you wings, I'll lift you up
I hope that you can see you are the greatest, greatest thing to me

The greatest thing, greatest thing, greatest thing to me
I will repeat myself so I know that you're li-listening
The greatest thing, greatest thing, greatest thing to me
I will repeat myself so I know that you're li-listening
'Cause when I'm with you, I fall apart (fall apart)
To heal your permanently broken heart (broken heart)
Baby, you're the greatest to me
No, no matter what, what, what

I don't know why you hurt inside
Or what was said to make you cry
I hope that you can see you are the greatest thing to me
And when you're feeling like you're not enough
I'll give you wings, I'll lift you up
