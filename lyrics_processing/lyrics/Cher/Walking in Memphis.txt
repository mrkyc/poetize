Put on my blue suede shoes
And I boarded the plane
Touched down in the land of the Delta Blues
In the middle of the pouring rain
W.C. Handy, won't you look down over me?
Yeah, I got a first class ticket
But I'm as blue as a girl can be

Then I'm walking in Memphis
I was walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale
Walking in Memphis
But do I really feel the way I feel?

Saw the ghost of Elvis on Union Avenue
Followed him up to the gates of Graceland
Then I watched him walk right through
Now security, they did not see him
They just hovered around his tomb
But there's a pretty little thing
Waiting for the King
Down in the Jungle Room

When I was walking in Memphis
I was walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale
Walking in Memphis
But do I really feel the way I feel?
Walking in Memphis
I was walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale
Walking in Memphis
But do I really feel the way I feel?

They've got catfish on the table (Ooh)
They've got gospel in the air (Ah)
And Reverend Green will be glad to see you
When you haven't got a prayer
But boy, you've got a prayer in Memphis
Now Gabriel plays piano every Friday at the Hollywood
And they brought me down to see him
And they asked me if I would do a little number
And I sang with all my might
And he said "Tell me, are you a Christian, child?"
And I said "Man, I am tonight!"

Walking in Memphis (Walking in Memphis)
I was walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale (Oh)
Walking in Memphis (Walking in Memphis)
But do I really feel the way I feel?
Walking in Memphis (Walking in Memphis)
I was walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale (Oh)
Walking in Memphis (Walking in Memphis)
But do I really feel the way I feel?
