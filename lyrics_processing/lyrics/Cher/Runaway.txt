Nobody said it would be easy
Nobody gives you guarantees
'Cause a heart can always be broken
And there can be no loving without tears

Runaway, to a place where nobody knows
Runaway, gotta let this feeling go
Runaway, if I can't find love
I gotta runaway

Running away, I'm running faster
Running away, I'm running from you
Running away, I'm running faster
Running away, I'm running from you

Nobody's looking for perfection
How could they give it in return?
But I told my heart to believe you
And you just gave your love to anyone

Runaway, to a place where nobody knows
Runaway, gotta let these feelings go
Runaway, 'cause I don't wanna hurt anymore
Though my heart is always searching
If I can't find love, I gotta runaway

Running away, I'm running from you (Runaway)
Running away, I'm running faster (Runaway)
Running away, I'm running from you
Running away, I'm running faster
Running away, I'm running from you

If I can't find love
If I can't find love
'Cause a heart can always be broken
And there can be no loving without tears

Runaway, to a place where nobody knows
Runaway, gotta let these feelings go
Runaway, and I don't wanna hurt anymore
Though my heart is always searching
If I can't find love
I gotta runaway, runaway, runaway
If I can't find love
I gotta runaway, runaway, runaway
I've gotta run, I've gotta runaway

Running away, I'm running faster (If I can't find love)
Running away, I'm running from you
Running away, I'm running faster (If I can't find love)
Running away, I'm running from you
Running away, I'm running faster (If I can't find love)
Running away, I'm running from you
Running away, I'm running faster (If I can't find love)
