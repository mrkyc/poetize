I'm dancing solo
In the dark on the club floor
I need to let it go
Shake it off, stop thinking about you

I lose myself in the beat of the drum
Try, try, try to forget what you've done, done
But honey, this is a battle that you haven't won

Torn up, busted, taken apart
I've been broken down, left with a broken heart
But I'm stronger, strong enough to rise above
This is a woman's world
This is a woman's world

Tell the truth
This is a woman's world
Tell the truth
This is a woman's world
Said I'm stronger, strong enough to rise above
This is a woman's world, this is a woman's world
You might also like
Your love hurts
Your lies, they cut me
But now your words don't mean a thing
And I don't give a damn if you ever loved me

'Cause it don't matter, I'm movin' on
Gon-gonna lose myself in the beat of the drum
'Cause, honey, this is a battle that you haven't won

Torn up, busted, taken apart
I've been broken down, left with a broken heart
But I'm stronger, strong enough to rise above
This is a woman's world, this is a woman's world

Tell the truth
This is a woman's world
Tell the truth
This is a woman's world
Said I'm stronger, strong enough to rise above
This is a woman's world, this is a woman's world
Tell the truth
This is a woman's world
Tell the truth
This is a woman's world
Said I'm stronger, strong enough to rise above
This is a woman's world, this is a woman's world
All the women in the world, stand up, come together now
This is a woman's world
Everybody in the club, stand up, come together now
This is a woman's world
All the women in the world, stand up, come together now
This is a woman's world
Everybody in the club, stand up, come together now
This is a woman's world

Tell the truth
This is a woman's world
Tell the truth
This is a woman's world
Said I'm stronger, strong enough to rise above
This is a woman's world, this is a woman's world
Tell the truth
This is a woman's world
Tell the truth
This is a woman's world
Said I'm stronger, strong enough to rise above
This is a woman's world, this is a woman's world
Tell the truth
This is a woman's world
Tell the truth
This is a woman's world
Said I'm stronger, strong enough to rise above
