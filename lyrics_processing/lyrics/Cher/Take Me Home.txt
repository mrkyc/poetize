Take me home, take me home
Want to feel you close to me
Take me home, take me home
With you is where I wanna be
Wrapped in your arms tonight
Just making love
Music and candlelight
Stars up above

Take me home (Take me home)
Take me home (Take me home)
Oh, can't you see I want you near?
(Can't you see I want you?)
Take me home (Take me home)
Take me home (Take me home)
Ooh baby, let's get out of here

I'd follow you anywhere, your place or mine
Just a one-night affair would be so fine

I'm in heaven (Heaven)
Seems like heaven (Heaven)
So much in heaven (Heaven)
(Take me home)
(Take me home)
You might also like
One night with you lying here next to me
It's the right thing to do, it would be ecstasy

I'm in heaven (Heaven)
Seems like heaven (Heaven)
So much in heaven (Heaven)
Take me home

Ooh, baby, take me home
(Take me home)
Oh, now, c'mon and make me, baby
C'mon and take me, take me home
(Take me home)
(Take me home)
(Take me home)

(Music, candlelight, so right)
(Take me home)
(In your arms tonight hold me tight)
(Take me home)
(Just me and you, forever)
(Take me home, home with you)
(You and me, together)
(Take me home, home with you)
(Take me home)
Oh, will you have me forever? (With you)
With you, I'd be walking right out that door (Right out that door)
One night with you lying here next to me
It's the right thing to do, it would be ecstasy

I'm in heaven (Heaven)
Seems like heaven (Heaven)
So much in heaven (Heaven)
Take me home (Take me home)

Take me home (Take me home)
I wanna feel you close to me (I wanna feel you close)
Take me home (Take me home)
With you is where I wanna be
Wrapped in your arms tonight (With you)
Just makin' love
Music and candlelight (With you)
Stars up above
