Does he love me?
I wanna know
How can I tell if he loves me so?

(Is it in his eyes?) Oh, no, you'll be deceived
(Is it in his sighs?) Oh, no, he'll make believe
If you wanna know if he loves you so
It's in his kiss (That's where it is, oh, yeah)
(Or is it in his face?) Oh, no, it's just his charms
(In his warm embrace?) Oh, no, that's just his arms
If you want to know if he loves you so
It's in his kiss (That's where it is)
Oho, it's in his kiss (That's where it is)

Oh-oho, hug him, squeeze him tight
Find out what you wanna know
If it's love, if it really is
It's there in his kiss

(How about the way he acts?)
Oh, no, that's not the way
You're not list'nin' to all I say
If you wanna know if he loves you so
It's in his kiss (That's where it is)
Oho, it's in his kiss (That's where it is)
