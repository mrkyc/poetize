I heard you wanna be somebody
But you are already shining on me
She tried to make you feel so lonely
But you can be my one and only love
My love
My love
You can be my love
My love
My love

You have got the dreams to go on
Take a step and look towards the sun
It doesn't matter where you've come from
Here is where you'll always be the one I love, my love

You are not alone
'Cause I've found a place where
You can belong
Somewhere you know you can run to
So if you need me to hold you
You can be my love

If you could only see what I see
I'm dazzled by the beauty in front of me
So if you wanna know how I feel
I feel like you were meant to be my love
My love
My love
You might also like
You are not alone
'Cause I've found a place where
You can belong
Somewhere you know you can run to
So if you need me to hold you
You can be my love

You can be my love
You can be my love
You can be my love
You can be my love
You can be my love
You can be my love
You can be my love
You can be my love

Somewhere you know you can run to
So if you need me to hold you
You can be my love
Somewhere you know you can run to
So if you need me to hold you
You can be my love
I know you wanna be somebody
You can take your time, you're with me
I can feel your heart beating through me
Feel like we were meant to be
My love
My love
My love
You can be my love
My love
