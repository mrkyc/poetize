Check out the one
Whose tongue is on the run
Bet they've been jawin' since the day begun
Havin' a ball
That fly up on the wall
Learns every secret and destroys 'em all

You hear that voice 'round the bend
Out there rappin' again
No there ain't no doubt
That's a motor mouth
(Never seems to run out of breath)
That's a motor mouth
(Come what may, they'll talk you to death)

Head full o' news
Can't wait to let it loose
Just starts to pour that gossip over you
Words never stop
When that's all that you got
Who cares if it's a lie or it's the truth?

You hear that voice 'round the bend
Out there rappin' again
No there ain't no doubt
That's a motor mouth
(Never seems to run out of breath)
That's a motor mouth
(Come what may, they'll talk you to death)
