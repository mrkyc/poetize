I was a sailor, I was lost at sea
Under the waves before love rescued me
I was a fighter, I could turn on a thread
Now I stand accused of the things I've said

When love comes to town I'm gonna jump that train
When love comes to town I'm gonna catch that flame
Maybe I was wrong to ever let you down
But I did what I did before love came to town

Used to find love under a red sunset
I was making promises I was soon to forget
I was as pale as the lace of my wedding gown
But I left him standing before love came to town

I ran into a juke joint when I heard the guitar scream
The notes were turning blue, I was dazing in a dream
As the music played I saw my life turn around
That was the day before love came to town

When love comes to town I'm gonna jump that train
When love comes to town I'm gonna catch that flame
Well, maybe I was wrong to ever let you down
But I did what I did before love came to town

I was there when they crucified my Lord, ooh
I held the scabbard when the soldier drew his sword
I threw the dice when they pierced his side
But I've seen love conquer the great divide

When love comes to town (Baby, when love comes to town)
I'm gonna (Baby, when love, baby) catch that train
When love comes to town (Comes to town, baby)
I'm gonna catch that flame (Catch it, baby)
Maybe I was wrong (Maybe you were wrong)
To ever let you down
But I did what I did (But I did what I did, baby)
