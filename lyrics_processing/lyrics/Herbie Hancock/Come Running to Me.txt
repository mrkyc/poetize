Tears at night 'cause you're scared
Little girl all afraid
Stuck between night and day
Baby fell down, lost her way

But now we're here all alone
Look and see
Oh, running to me
Just come running to me

Running to me
Baby, come running to me
Running to me
Come running
Running to me
Come running
Running to me

Without the songs, you never heard of love
Without the books, you never learned enough

Just come running to me
Just come running to me
Just come running to me
Just come running to me

Just come running to me
Just come running to me
(You don't have to be afraid, not anymore)
Just come running to me
Just come running to me
Come running to me
(I'll be there with you, baby, I'm yours, I'm yours)

Without the songs, you never heard of love
Without the books, you never learned enough
