Looking at you sitting there
Your mind a million miles away
Might as well be talking to the walls
Maybe they'll hear, what I've got to say

It's the same old story
About somebody with a dream
Looking for the glory
No matter how far the future seems

You've got stars in your eyes
There's a whole world out there for you
You've got stars in your eyes
But it ain't gonna do
You've got stars in your eyes
There's a whole world out there for you
Yeah, babe... yeah, babe

So much inside, you can't hold it all there
You've got to express your feelings
Maybe one day the whole world will know
Put a sail on your dreams and go sailing

Oh, can't you see, yeah
That you're so much a part of me
I could never ever lead you wrong
With my arms wide open

Baby, I'll give you all I've got to give
And if you'll just open up your heart, and live

And the whole world is waiting for you
