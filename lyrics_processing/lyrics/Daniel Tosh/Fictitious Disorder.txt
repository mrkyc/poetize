Oh thank you. Thank you! AH THE O.C! WOO! NICE! Where everyone's rich and white the way god intended. Feels good.
Don't you love living in southern California? And people from Omaha come here and they say things like "Ah this place is great but uh... I like seasons. I-I- I couldn't live there, I love seasons too much." So do I. That's why I live in a place that skips the shitty ones. Your city BLOWS.
Ha ha ha. Life is what you make it make it good I have a good life, my friends think it's so much better than it really is. Why? Because I make it better. Wanna know where I'm working next week? Hm? Hawaii. How's that feel Irvine? Enjoy your mall. I'm not in Hawaii next week. I'm in Milwaukee. But in my mind I'm going to Hawaii. Life is what you make it. Anytime your going someplace in your life you don't wanna go pretend your going to Hawaii. It's a lot cheaper. Put on your flowered shirt, run in there be like "Aloha everybody I'm here" they're gonna think you need a helmet. Who cares? You're in the Aloha state. Number 50, that's why it bounced off our flag, that's why we took it!
I even took my girlfriend last week to Rome. Yeah. The whole time she was like "this looks like Birmingham, Alabama". I'm like "Shut up,   Anna Kournikova" She's like "Quit calling me Anna Kournikova!" I'm like "No one talks to The Rock like that BITCH!" Which is funny because I don't even have a girlfriend. Ha! That was just some lady on the bus she didn't smell what I was cooking. Now she has a knot on the forehead by the people's elbow. You get the joke Carnegie Hall?
