My friends, they know I won't pick up if they call me
One day a year
And that one day is here
My tears just like a summer rain are falling
It's just what they do
When I start missing you

Why'd you have to go? Why'd I have to stay?
When's it gonna get easier to make it through the day?

I go out walking, I ain't much for talking
Just thinking and crying, and praying and trying
To make sense of what don't make sense in this life
Like, "Why you're up there and not here by my side?"
They say it's gonna get easier, and I wanna believe that's true
It's just harder on the seventh of June

Hmm

I've been singing songs ever since the day you left me
Crazy how my life has changed
Every night, a different stage
And sometimes it feels like you and God are watching
Are you looking down on me?
I wonder if you're proud of me

Oh, I go out walking, I ain't much for talking
Just thinking and crying, and praying and trying
To make sense of what don't make sense in this life
Like, "Why you're up there and not here by my side?"
They say it's gonna get easier, and I wanna believe that's true
It's just harder on the seventh of June

Oh, I miss you
Yeah, I miss you
Hmm

I go out walking, I ain't much for talking
Just thinking and crying, and praying and trying
To make sense of what don't make sense in this life
Like, "Why you're up there and not here by my side?"
They say it's gonna get easier, and I wanna believe that's true
It's just harder, oh, it's just harder
On the seventh of June

Oh-woah, oh

My friends, they know I won't pick up if they call me
On the seventh of June
