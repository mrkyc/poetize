(Hey, girl)
There in my reflection
Man, this world's been messing
It's been messing with your mind
(Hey, girl)
Someone stole your smile now
It's been a little while now
Happiness is hard to find

Letting everybody and their mother try to tell you what you're worth
What you're worth
When did you forget that the One who made you told you what you're worth?
Repeat after me

I'm a blood-bought, battle-fought, all my shame long gone
Made-new child of the King
I'm an amen, testify, holy water baptized
Went down and came up clean
I'm a soul been saved by that amazing grace
And now there ain't no way, girl
Can't take that away, girl
Don't forget you're free
It's who you're made to be

Don't you know you're beautiful
Crazy kind of wonderful
And there's no one like you?
(Hey, girl)
You don't need to measure up
You are the treasure of
The God who loves you

No more letting everybody and their mother try to tell you what you're worth
What you're worth
And if you should forget, let the One who made you tell you what you're worth
And repeat after me

I'm a blood-bought, battle-fought, all my shame long gone
Made-new child of the King
I'm an amen, testify, holy water baptized
Went down and came up clean
I'm a soul been saved by that amazing grace
And now there ain't no way, girl
Can't take that away, girl
Don't forget you're free
It's who you're made to be
Hey, girl, oh, yeah
(Hey, girl)
(Hey, girl)
I'm glad we had this talk now
Think we said it all now
But here's a little last advice
Live free, walk in victory
And repeat after me

I'm a blood-bought, battle-fought, all my shame long gone
Made-new child of the King
I'm an amen, testify, holy water baptized
Went down and came up clean
I'm a soul been saved by that amazing grace
And now there ain't no way, girl
Can't take that away, girl
Don't forget you're free
It's who you're made to be
Hey, girl, oh
Hey, girl
