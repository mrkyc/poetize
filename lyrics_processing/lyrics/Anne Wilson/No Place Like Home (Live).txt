You picked me up, we were gone again
Truck tires on a dirt road
Kentucky hills out the window
Didn't stop till we got to Wilson Farm
We were kings and queens, the world was ours
Running wild through the wheat fields
Thinking this is how free feels
Laughing as we go
There's no place like home
Up to high point mountain we would climb
You'd tell me your dreams, I'd tell you mine
Wonder if you ever knew
How much I was looking up to you
You played me all your favorite songs
Why you let your little sister tag along
I'll never know but I'm glad you did
I wish we were still those kids
Laughing as we go
There's no place like home
The trouble with time is it won't slow down
How I wish it would
The trouble with Earth is I can't bring you back
God, I wish I could
But I look up at the stars
When I'm missing you the most
And this aching in my heart is what reminds me
There's no place like home

Pretend you're right there by my side
And climb high point mountain without you
But it ain't the same without you
Preacher talks about a better place
Where all our tears will be wiped away
A healing for this brokenness
No more longing for the ones we miss
But you already know
There's no place like home
The trouble with time is it won't slow down
How I wish it would
The trouble with Earth is I can't bring you back
God, I wish I could
But I look up at the stars
When I'm missing you the most
And this aching in my heart is what reminds me
There's no place like home
Oh, there's no place like home
I stopped by to talk to you today
And touch the stone where you were laid
Right next to grandpa's barn
But I know that's not where you are
It fills my heart with hope
There's no place like home
Oh, there's no place like home
