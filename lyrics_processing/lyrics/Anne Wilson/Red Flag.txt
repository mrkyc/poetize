Don't sell yourself short, girl
He's gotta love you but he's gotta love Jesus just a little more, girl
It's worth waitin' for, girl
Where'd he come from?
Is he big city pretty or sweatin' for a dollar till the day's done?
Is hard work what he runs from?

At the end of the day my mama said some flags are green and some flags are red

He's a no go if he don't go to church
Better slow down if he ain't down to earth
If he don't go huntin' and don't go fishin', you might as well throw him back
If he don't R-E-S-P-E-C-T
The stars and the stripes in the land of the free
Better run away fast 'cause a boy like that
Is a walkin', talkin', wavin' red flag

A red flag
Oh, he's a red flag
A red flag

Does it make sense, girl?
Do you see him jumpin' off a fence and buyin' you a white picked fence world?
Or just got you for rent, girl?

Some red flags don't know the golden rule
Some red flags don't own a pair of boots

He's a no go if he don't go to church
Better slow down (Better slow down) if he ain't down to earth
If he don't go huntin' and don't go fishin', you might as well throw him back
If he don't R-E-S-P-E-C-T
The stars and the stripes in the land of the free
Better run away fast 'cause a boy like that
Is a walkin', talkin', wavin' red flag
A red flag (Stay away from a)
A red flag (Mama warned you)
A red flag
