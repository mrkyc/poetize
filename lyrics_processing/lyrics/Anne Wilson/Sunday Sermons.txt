Seven years old, third row pew
John 3:16, something changed in me
Red letters coming off the page
Flooding my heart with amazing grace
I knew then I believed
And those roots run deep

Oh, I've been through some faith-shaking hard times, yeah
But nothing's gonna make me forget

Every one of those Sunday sermons, every time that choir would sing
I could hear my Savior calling, telling me how much He loves me
No matter what the world throws at me, I know His word is true
It all started with a heart-stirring, spirit-moving Sunday sermons

The devil gonna try and take me out of that church
But you can't take the church out of me
The devil gonna try and take me out of that church
But you can't take the church out of me

Gonna have my worries, well, that's part of life
But then I think of those stories, 'bout what my God can do
He's still moving like He did back then
Born again people, can I get an "Amen"? (Amen)
We've all seen the proof
He makes all things new
