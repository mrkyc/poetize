Dear Jesus
It's been a minute since I called, guess You already know the reasons
I've got a list a mile long of gone wrongs, goin' off the deep end
I've been slippin' up sideways
Runnin' off the rails like a runaway freight train
All I know is my way has left me cryin' in the driveway

I can't do this on my own, God knows how much I've tried
I'm on my knees, just hopin' these words make it past the sky
Do You hear me? Do You know me?
Can broken still be holy?
I'm tryin' to get a message to the man upstairs
Every saint started with a sinner's prayer
Every saint started with a sinner's prayer

I'm sorry
Two words You ain't heard that much out of me these days
You forgive and I forget how beautiful it is us talkin' like this (Talkin' like this)
Oh, I miss us talkin' like this

I can't do this on my own, God knows how much I've tried
I'm on my knees, just hopin' these words make it past the sky
Do You hear me? Do You know me?
Can broken still be holy?
I'm tryin' to get a message to the man upstairs
Every saint started with a sinner's prayer
Every saint started with a sinner's prayer

Dear Jesus
I'm glad You haven't left and I didn't waste my breath
I know that You know, I meant every single word I said
