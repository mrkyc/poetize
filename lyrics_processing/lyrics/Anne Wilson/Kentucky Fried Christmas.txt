It's a Kentucky fried Christmas, come on down
Where the lights stay up on the porch year-round
It's a John Deere tractor sleigh bell ride
And there's no such thing as a silent night
In the Bluegrass State, it's a state of mind
And we like our Christmas Kentucky-fried

From Louisville to Harlan, it's time to deck the halls
With Charlie Brown and Jesus, front yard inflatables
Get a turkey from the Walmarts, last-minute presents and cards
We do things different 'round here

It's a Kentucky fried Christmas, come on down
Where the lights stay up on the porch year-round
It's a John Deere tractor sleigh bell ride
And there's no such thing as a silent night
In the Bluegrass State, it's a state of mind
And we like our Christmas Kentucky-fried

Loretta, Lynn, and Ricky spinning on the vinyl
Daddy reading stories from the family Bible
See the stars and the moon shine on a cold December night
We do things different 'round here

It's a Kentucky fried Christmas, come on down
Where the lights stay up on the porch year round
It's a John Deere tractor sleigh bell ride
And there's no such thing as a silent night
In the Bluegrass State, it's a state of mind
And we like our Christmas Kentucky fried

(Hey, hey)

Jingle bells, Colonel Claus, homegrown all the way
Oh, what fun it is to eat Hot Browns on Christmas Day
Bells on wild cats ring, eating Pecan pie
Oh, what fun it is to add some slide

It's a Kentucky fried Christmas, come on down
Where the lights stay up on the porch year-round
It's a John Deere tractor sleigh bell ride
And there's no such thing as a silent night
In the Bluegrass State, it's a state of mind
