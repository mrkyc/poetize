Devil thought he had won the final round
The devil thought he could keep you six feet down
You could hear hell singing that victory song
But a funny thing happened, the devil thought wrong
The devil thought wrong, thought wrong

You came rising right out of that grave
My sin went running and my soul got saved
Son of God's always been a bit of a rebel
You brought life to me and death to the devil
Holy Ghost has got a hold on me
I was blind but now I can see
Freedom gone got me on another level
You brought life to me and death to the devil

Devil still lying and accusing me
Trying to drag down what has been redeemed
But I'll stand my ground, stare into his face
And fight back with the power in Jesus' name, Jesus' name

You came rising right out of that grave
My sin went running and my soul got saved
Son of God's always been a bit of a rebel
You brought life to me and death to the devil
Holy Ghost has got a hold on me
I was blind but now I can see
Freedom gone got me on another level
You brought life to me and death to the devil

Devil thought he had won the final round
Devil got scared when he found out

You came rising right out of that grave
My sin went running and my soul got saved
Son of God's always been a bit of a rebel
You brought life to me and death to the devil
Holy Ghost has got a hold on me
I was blind but now I can see
Freedom gone got me on another level
You brought life to me and death to the devil
You brought life to me and death to the devil
