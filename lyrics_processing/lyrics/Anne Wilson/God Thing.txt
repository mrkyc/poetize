I've seen a bad man change his ways
Seen a woman get some healing on her dying day
Had no money in my pocket, found a hundred in my wallet
Just in time for me to get the bills paid

Some things you can't explain (Explain, explain, explain)
Even though they happen every day

Don't say it ain't a God thing
Don't say it ain't a miracle
It's so obvious when He does His stuff
It's not anyone else but Him
When you see a life change
It's something supernatural
Anytime a sinner becomes a saint
Yeah, it's a God thing

I hate drawing that short straw, it don't feel fair
And I get to wondering if He is even there
But then He does something that I never saw coming
Kinda funny how we think it's so rare (It's so rare)
