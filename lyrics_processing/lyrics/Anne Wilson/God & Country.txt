Mama put a Bible in my hands
And Daddy put my hands in the dirt
I grew up in the heart of the heartland
With a vintage Johnny Cash on my shirt
I learned the truth from Grandad's vinyl
And a preacher down on river road
If you care to know anything about me
I'll tell you everything you need to know

I'm hallelujah hands high and friends in low places
Red, white, and blue, and red-letter pages
Back-row pew and front-seat Ford
New King James and old King George
I'm washed in the water and mud on the tires
I'm Friday night lights and Sunday morning choir
I'm prayers up to Heaven, roots down in Kentucky
Made by God and country

God and country

Always been and will be my true north
When it feels like the world's going south
It is well with my soul where the green grass grows
On some hometown holy ground

I'm grace-given free and a hard-earned dollar
Child of the King and a coal miner's daughter
I'm prayers up to Heaven, roots down in Kentucky, oh yeah
I got a good life down here and a better one waitin' up above me
Made by God and country
