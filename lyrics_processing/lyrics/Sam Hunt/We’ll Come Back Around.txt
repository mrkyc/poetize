Put your fist to the wall
Say you through it all
Baby, I'm through too
Just throw a log on the fire of the heat of the moment
Put your key in the car
Jerk it right outta park
Flip a big air fume
Spin your tires on the gravel and throw it, 'cause

I know you love me, when you hate me
Baby, I ain't gonna let it faze me
Right now we're just a circus leaving town
We'll come back around

This ain't the worst we've seen
Ain't the first bad dream
Ain't the third world war
Every once in a while, we just gotta get our fight on
You say you won't come back
I say amen to that, then I lock that door
But I know you got the key and I'm gonna leave the light on

Know I love you, when I hate you
You show up, girl, you know I'm gonna take it
Baby, even the moon and the sun got their ups and downs
We'll come back around

When the winds and the rain are gone
Both be sorry even if it don't get sick
No matter how old and we are
We never get too far from right back in this bed

Know you love me, when you hate me
Baby, I ain't gonna let it faze me
Right now we're a pair of hearts and the chips are down
We'll come back around
Know I love you, when I hate you
You show up girl you know I'm gonna take it
We're just a couple of kids on a merry go 'round
We'll come back around
