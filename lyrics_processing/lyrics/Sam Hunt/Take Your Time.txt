I don't know if you were looking at me or not
You probably smile like that all the time
I don't mean to bother you but
I couldn't just walk by
And not say, "Hi"
And I know your name
'Cause everybody in here knows your name
You're not looking for anything right now
So, I don't wanna come on strong
Don't get me wrong
Your eyes are so intimidating
My heart is pounding but
It's just a conversation
No girl, I'm not wasted
You don't know me
I don't know you
But I want to

And I don't wanna steal your freedom
I don't wanna change your mind
I don't have to make you love me
I just wanna take your time
I don't wanna wreck your Friday
I ain't gonna waste my lines
I don't have to take your heart
I just wanna take your time

And I know it starts with "Hello"
The next thing you know you try to be nice
And some guys gettin' too close
Trying to pick you up
Trying to get you drunk
And I'm sure one of your friends is about to come over here
'Cause she's supposed to save you from random guys that talk too much
And wanna stay too long
It's the same old song
And dance, but I think you know it well
You could've rolled your eyes, told me to go to hell
Could've walked away, but you're still here
And I'm still here
Come on, let's see where it goes

I don't wanna steal your freedom
I don't wanna change your mind
I don't have to make you love me
I just wanna take your time
I don't have to meet your mother
We don't have to cross that line
I don't wanna steal your covers
I just wanna take your time
Woah
I don't wanna go home with you
Woah
I just wanna be alone with you

I don't wanna steal your freedom (Freedom)
I don't wanna change your mind
I don't have to make you love me (You love me)
I just wanna take your time
I don't wanna blow your phone up
I just wanna blow your mind
I don't have to take your heart
I just wanna take your time
No, I ain't gotta call you "Baby"
And I ain't gotta call you mine
I don't have to take your heart
I just wanna take your time
