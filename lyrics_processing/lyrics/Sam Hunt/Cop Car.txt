We drove right past
That no trespassing sign
We sat on the tailgate
And watched the planes take off
We thought we had all night
There was no need to rush
That's when those cops
Came pulling up
And I thought
Man, ain't this some shhhh

Your daddy's gonna kill me
But if I survive tonight
I wouldn't change one thing
Baby, yeah
I know it sounds crazy

But there was somethin' 'bout the way
The blue lights were shinin'
Bringing out the freedom in your eyes
I was too busy watching you going wild child
To be worried about going to jail
You were thinking that running for it
Would make a good story
I was thinking you were crazy as hell
You were so innocent
But you were stealing my heart
I fell in love in the back of a cop car

Man, they weren't playin'
They sure put those cuffs on quick
You tried to sweet talk 'em
They didn't fall for it, but I did
You were on the left, I was on the right
I knew you didn't smoke
When you asked him for a light
And I laughed
He got mad and slammed the door

I swear your daddy's gonna kill me
But if I survive tonight
I wouldn't change one thing
Baby, yeah
I know it sounds crazy

But there was somethin' 'bout the way
The blue lights were shinin'
Bringing out the freedom in your eyes
I was too busy watching you going wild child
To be worried about going to jail
You were thinking that running for it
Would make a good story
I was thinking you were crazy as hell
You were so innocent
But you were stealing my heart
I fell in love in the back of a cop car
And you were like (oh woah oh)
Side by side
And locked in tight
They were taking their time
But we didn't mind
We talked and we laughed
We sat real close
By the time they let us go
I was already gone

Cause there was somethin' 'bout the way
The blue lights were shinin'
Bringing out the freedom in your eyes
I was too busy watching you going wild child
To be worried about going to jail
You were thinking that running for it
Would make a good story
I was thinking you were crazy as hell
But you were so innocent
But you were stealing my heart
I fell in love in the back the back the cop car
