Y'all know this one?
Sing it with me, if you would

Got a girl from the south side, got braids in her hair
First time I seen her walk by, hoo, man, I 'bout fell off my chair
Had to get her number, it took me like six weeks
Now me and her go way back like Cadillac seats

Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin' 15 in a 30, I ain't in no hurry
I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can

The way she fit in them blue jeans, she don't need no belt
But I can turn them inside out, I don't need no help
Got hips like honey, so thick and so sweet
It ain't no curves like hers on them downtown streets

Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin' 15 in a 30, I ain't in no hurry
I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can

Out here in the boondocks with the breeze and the birds
Tangled up in the tall grass with my lips on hers
On a highway to Heaven, headed south of her smile
Get there when we get there, every inch is a mile

Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin' 15 in a 30, I ain't in no hurry
I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can
I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can
Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand

Alright, can we have a little Chicago sing-along real fast?
We gon' lead from the back to the front
Everybody still good up there, up top, ?
I can't see ya, but I can hear ya
I want y'all to lead us on this one
I want everybody singing loud and proud, one more time
Bring us back, here we go!

Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin' 15 in a 30, I ain't in no hurry
I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can
Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin' 15 in a 30, I ain't in no hurry
I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can
I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can
Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
