You hear a new song, and it's your favorite
But pretty soon you'll be changin' the station
And all your old shoes are lookin' brand new
They wanna be worn but they never get the chance to
Heavy into everything, ready for the next thing
To catch your eye for a while, then you're over it
You change your mind on it
Soon as the shine's gone
Like you always do, but you don't know it yet, but

Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa
I ain't gonna be that easy to leave
Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa

Girl, I'm gonna make you miss me
Make you wish that you were sleepin' in my shirt
Lie about my jacket and tell everyone it's yours
When your phone rings after midnight and you're thinkin' maybe it's me
I'm gonna make you miss me

You're cold and hot
You burn out like a match
Keep the slip knot in the strings you attach
You think it's easy, but that's a lie
The only reason that you're good at goodbye is
Every boy you ever met, was too easy to forget
Well, I ain't goin' out like that

I ain't gonna be that easy to leave
Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa

Girl, I'm gonna make you miss me
Make you wish that you were sleepin' in my shirt
Lie about my jacket and tell everyone it's yours
When your phone rings after midnight and you're thinkin' maybe it's me
I'm gonna make you miss me (Yeah)

Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa
I ain't gonna be that easy to leave
Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa
Girl, I'm gonna make you miss me

Writing letters that you're never gonna mail
Stay up and paint my favorite shade of red on your nails
'Cause you can't fall asleep and you're wishin' you were with me
I'm gonna make you miss me
Make you miss me
Make you miss the way my hand fit in your hand
When you're dialin' my number, listening to my favorite bands
I'll say, "Hey baby, you know you can stay, just come and get me."
I'm gonna make you miss me (Miss me)
I'm gonna make you miss me
Whoa, oh-oh-oh
