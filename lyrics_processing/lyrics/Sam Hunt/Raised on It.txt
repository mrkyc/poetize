Snapbacks and Levi jeans
PBR and burnt CDs
Running for the grass on the hot concrete
We're still working on our summer feet
Cheap gas and Reddy ice
Trunk music and headlight fights
Dodging the smoke from a riverbank fire
A pretty girl and a pickup line like
"Hey what's your name, you know smoke follows beauty, baby"

We stayed up all night long, made our drinks too strong
Feeling ten feet tall
Ropes swinging into the water in the middle of the night
Like oh-oh-oh oh oh
Breaking our boots in, stompin' on the ground we grew up on
Yeah, we were raised on it (raised on it)
Worked hard and played on it
We had it made on it
We were born and raised on it

Car wash at the custom tent
Sticky quarters and pine tree scent
The only sign that we ever got stuck
Is the muddy chain in the back of the truck
5-1's with a 20 on top
Three guard at the barber shop
Duckin' from your ex at the 4-way stop
Turn the music down when you're passing the cops

Yeah, we were raised on it (raised on it)
Worked hard and played on it
We had it made on it
We were born and raised on it

Mama's prayers and daddy's speech
Front porch philosophies
A little too young and dumb to see
Just what it all meant to me

We stayed up all night long, made our drinks too strong
Feeling ten feet tall
Ropes swinging into the water in the middle of the night
Like oh-oh-oh oh oh
Breaking our boots in, stompin' on the ground we grew up on
Yeah, we were raised on it (raised on it)
Worked hard and played on it
We had it made on it
We were born and raised on it
Mmm yeah
When that sun starts sinking
When they turn those open signs around
We thought we ran this town
Running around just
Breaking hearts and curfew
Out in the yard with no shoes
Staying cool in a Nylon pool
Foul ball headed for the parking lot
And those Saturday mornings we sleep late
ATVs and fire breaks
Worn out jeans, black eyed peas, backroads and blue skies
I was born and raised on it
Might have misbehaved on it
Worked hard and played on it
