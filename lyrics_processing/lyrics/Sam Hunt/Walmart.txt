(Your little girl)

We parted ways in the summer, you told me goodbye through your tears
I used to run into you over Christmas but I hadn't seen you in years
I used to think that I messed up, wonder if I should've stayed
I thought I'd always regret lettin' you go but all that regret went away

I saw your momma at Walmart with your little girl
She had your eyes and your smile, she had your nose and your lips
Somewhere in our little small town, small-talk girl
Lost in the grocery aisle, holdin' a bag of some chips
I realized that everything happens for a reason
Losin' your love ain't the end of the world
I saw your momma at Walmart with your little girl
Your little girl, your little girl

She asked me how I was doin' and I didn't know what to say
I kept replayin' how you used to say that you wanted a family someday
But someday was just an illusion when this town was all that we knew
You told me you'd never get over me, honestly, part of me hoped it was true

I saw your momma at Walmart with your little girl
She had your eyes and your smile, she had your nose and your lips
Somewhere in our little small town, small-talk girl
Lost in the grocery aisle, holdin' a bag of some chips
I realized that everything happens for a reason
Losin' your love ain't the end of the world
I saw your momma at Walmart with your little girl
Your little girl, your little girl
