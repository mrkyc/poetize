Lipstick graffiti on the bathroom mirror
What happened to me still ain't clear
You came and went like a thief in the night
Left your mark on everything in sight
Well I got some earring evidence
The eye liner notes you went and hid
I know exactly who let you in
And right where I could find your fingerprints

Girl, I guess I should have known
You look like a little hoodlumwith my hoodie on
Dancing on my bed to a Fugee song
Just killing me softly

Girl, you're a vandalizer, little hypnotizer
You left me laying here with my eyes closed
Stole my heart with a kiss right under my nose
Little love crook, don't know how much you took
But you ransacked my drawers, cluttered up my floors
And made a mess of me, you made a mess of me

Now before you showed up, I had it all together
Now I'm picking up and putting back all of my records
This dull razor won't shave my face
There's bobby pins all over the place
Well the smell of your hair put a spell on me
Tangled up in a chair, I could feel you breath
Now thinking about it's all I could do
I can't wait to get my hands on you

You're a vandalizer, hypnotizer
You left me laying here with my eyes closed
Stole my heart with a kiss right under my nose
You're a love crook, I don't know how much you took
But you ransacked my drawers, cluttered up my floors
And made a mess of me, you made a mess of me

Come on back
Come on back
Girl, come on back
Ohhhh Ohh Ohhhh

Girl, I guess I should have known
You look like a little hoodlum with my hoodie on
Dancing on my bed to a Fugee song
