Well, there ain't enough smoke in my eyes
To hide the kind of games you're tryna play
(Games you're tryna play)
Honey, don't you act so surprised
You know exactly what I'm 'bout to say
(What I'm 'bout to say)
You kiss my lips like you mean it, but you ain't that slick

Everywhere we go, you keep lookin' around
Fixing your make-up like it's about to go down
And he walks in, it all makes sense
Suddenly you're climbing all up next to me, next to me
I ain't no fool, you rascal, you
You don't want me, you just want your ex to see, ex to see

Whoa, whoa, whoa
Ooh, whoa, whoa
Ooh, whoa, whoa, ooh

So that's why when I pick you up
You always want me to drive your car
So I can leave mine at your house
And he can wonder where you are
Well, you're right here, looking sexy, whispering in my ear
