You're on the couch, blowin' up my phone
You don't wanna come out, but you don't wanna be alone
It don't take but two to have a little soiree
If you're in the mood, sit tight right where you are, babe

'Cause I'll be at your door in ten minutes
Whatever you got on, girl, stay in it
You ain't gotta leave the house to have a good time
I'ma bring the good time home to you

We'll have a house party, we don't need nobody
Turn your TV off, break that boombox out
We'll wake up all the neighbors 'til the whole block hates us
And the cops show up and try to shut us down

If you're gonna be a homebody
We're gonna have a house party
If you wanna be a homebody
We're gonna have a house party

Throw a neon t-shirt over the lamp shade
I'll take the furniture, slide it out of the way
Shakin' the floor, rattlin' the roof
We'll go to town right there in your living room
