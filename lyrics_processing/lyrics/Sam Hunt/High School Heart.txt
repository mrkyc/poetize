I wanna wrap you up in summertime and innocence
Like a curfew kiss goodnight
And go and make you wanna sneak off and get away with me
Like a stolen Marlboro Light
Pick you up and drive you around
Give you my jacket when the sun goes down
And I'll fight for you in the parking lot
Tattoo your lips across my arm
And we can drift off in a glory daydream

'Cause, baby
Here in the real world, it's so hard to believe in love
Jaded hopes and faded dreams ain't part of growing up
Life will try to make you think you're older than you are
I wanna make you feel like you got a high school heart

Don't get tired
High school heart
Edge of desire
High school heart
So on fire

I'll make you skid like second gear in a rearview 28
A quarter mile run
Jumping fences, dodging headlights, watching airplanes
Chest beating like a marching band drum
I'll be everything your daddy wants
And ill be a few things that he don't
We'll rise up full of calls, jump in the railroad track we crawled
Reach up and paint our names across the room

High school heart
Wanna stay up late
High school heart
