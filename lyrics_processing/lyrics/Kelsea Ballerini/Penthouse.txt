We moved to a place with a view off of Eighth Avenue after we said "I do"
And we watched cars of bachelorettes, two A.M. cigarettes, and traffic headed downtown
And the interstate was so loud, there was a lot it had to drown out

We played the part five nights, but we were never there on the weekends, baby
We got along real nice, but when I left town, did you hate me?
One day, the curtain started coming down
I changed the second we were moving out

When you're playing home in a penthouse, baby

I bought the house with a fence, enough room for some kids, a backyard for Dibs
And I thought that would make it all better, and maybe forever wouldn't feel like the walls closing in
'Cause how does that even make sense?
Now that I think about it, it never did

We played the part five nights, but we were never there on the weekends, baby
We got along real nice, but when I left town, did you hate me?
One day, the curtain started coming down
You changed the second we were moving out
I guess wrong can look alright
When you're playing home in a penthouse, baby
'Cause we were playing home in a penthouse, baby

I kissed someone new last night

We got along real nice, until I wanted out, now I know you hate me
One day, the curtain started coming down
We changed the second we were moving out
I guess wrong can look alright
When you're playing home in a penthouse, baby
Oh, we were playing home in a penthouse, baby, hmm

I just bought the house that we saw
You said it was wrong
