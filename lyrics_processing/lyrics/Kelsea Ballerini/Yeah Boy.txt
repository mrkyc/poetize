Captured my attention, make my heart stop and listen
When you look my way
Blue jeans and a ball cap, thinking that you're all that
And I'm thinking the same
You got that something in your eyes, I think about it all the time
If you ever wonder if I wanna make you mine

Yeah, boy
I'm digging what you're doing
Yeah, boy
I'm trying to keep it cool
But you're making it hard, I'm wishing your arms
Were wrapping me up tight
Yeah, boy
You shine and you can't even help it
Yeah, boy
Your eyes could make the moon jealous
And if you wanna know if I wanna be your girl tonight
Yeah, boy

Every song that's playing gets me thinking about you, baby
And the way you roll
So let's put down the drop top, burn a little blacktop
Off of that road
Baby, what we waiting on?
The stars are out, the night is young
If you wanna know if I wanna go and get gone
