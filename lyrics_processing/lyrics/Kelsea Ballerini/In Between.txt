In-between just a fling and a ring
In-between an apartment and a front porch swing
In-between cheap and fancy, a guitar and a Grammy
In-between reckless and responsibility

Sometimes I'm my mother's daughter, sometimes I'm her friend
Sometimes I play grown up and sometimes I play pretend
Sometimes I'm a princess dress, all ribbons and all curls
And sometimes I just wanna scream "I'm not a little girl"
Dumb enough to think I know it all
Smart enough to know I don't
Young enough to think I'll live forever
Old enough to know I won't

(In-between)

In-between beer and a basement and a Napa Valley vacation
In-between hometown and a neon city
In-between underestimated and over-expectated
Who I was and who I'm gonna be

Sometimes I'm my mother's daughter, sometimes I'm her friend
Sometimes I play grown up and sometimes I play pretend
Sometimes I'm a princess dress, all ribbons and all curls
And sometimes I just wanna scream "I'm not a little girl"
Dumb enough to think I know it all
Smart enough to know I don't
Young enough to think I'll live forever
Old enough to know I won't

I know I won't

I'm half head up in the clouds
Half feet down on the ground
'Cause it ain't as simple
As a number sittin' on a page
When they say "act your age"
But you're stuck there in the middle

Sometimes I'm my mother's daughter, sometimes I'm her friend (Sometimes I'm her friend)
Sometimes I play grown up and sometimes I play pretend (Sometimes I play pretend)
Sometimes I'm a princess dress, all ribbons and all curls
And sometimes I just wanna scream "I'm not a little girl"
Dumb enough to think I know it all
Smart enough to know I don't
Young enough to think I'll live forever
Old enough to know I won't

(Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah) In the in-between
(Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah) Yeah, in the in-between

Hey, sweet pea, it's Mama (Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I just wanna let you know that I love you
Thinkin' about you, missin' you while you're on the road
