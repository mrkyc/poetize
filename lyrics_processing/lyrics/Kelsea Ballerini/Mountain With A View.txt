It's 7 AM and I'm on a mountain with a view
I'm the only one alone at a table meant for two
Big Sur looks beautiful this mornin'
And I should be missin' you, I should be missin' you

You're across the pond at a show, I think, in Amsterdam
And the pictures look pretty, at least they do on your Instagram
We say good mornin', then goodnight
I wonder if you even know where I am, where I am

I'm wearin' the ring still, but I think I'm lyin'
Sometimes you forget yours, I think we're done tryin'
I realize you loved me much more at twenty-three
I think that this is when it's over for me

Ah
Ah

I can't believe I'm a few months out from twenty-nine
I can't handle another year of you and I just bein' fine
I've shared all my secrets and I've paid for all my crimes
And our stars ain't fallin' back into line

I'm wearin' the ring still, but I think I'm lyin'
Sometimes you forget yours, I think we're done tryin'
I realize you loved me much more at twenty-three
I think that this is when it's over for me

I think that this is when I cut the tie loose
I think that is when I set myself free
One day you'll ask, "When was it over for you?"

I'm takin' the ring off, I'm finally cryin'
Don't try to find yours, no reason to fight it
You'll say I'm crazy for bein' the one to leave
Scream I'm just like my parents and givin' up easy
But you never took that last flight to see me
Looks like our endin' ain't endin' happily
I think that this is when it's over for me

Me, me
I think that this is when it's over for me
Me, me, ah

It's 7 AM and I'm on a mountain with a view
