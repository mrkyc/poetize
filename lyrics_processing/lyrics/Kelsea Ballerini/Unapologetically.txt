They're gonna say I fell too fast
They're gonna say it's never gonna last and
Before it's too late, I should just back away
Yeah, they're gonna say that
He ain't the kind to hold my hand
He ain't gonna try to understand
Nothing under the surface
He's just looking for a pretty face

But they got it all wrong
I got it all right
They say they just don't see it
But I saw it at first sight

And I'm unapologetically in love
And that's unapologetically enough
No matter where it takes me
Even if it breaks me
I'm unapologetically all in
From the second that I started falling
And it don't even faze me
When they call me crazy
I'm unapologetically in love
I'm unapologetically in love, mmm, mmm

So, I could care less if I'm being careless
Might wreck me to be reckless
But I'd rather fall apart than love half-hearted
Yeah, maybe it's true that you know when you know
And then again, maybe you don't
But when you find a diamond, you can't keep it from shining

And I'm unapologetically in love
And that's unapologetically enough
No matter where it takes me
Even if it breaks me
I'm unapologetically all in
From the second that I started falling
And it don't even faze me
When they call me crazy
I'm unapologetically in love
I'm unapologetically in love, mmm, mmm

The life of my party
He keeps my eyes starry
So, I'm so sorry for not being sorry
I'm unapologetically in love
I'm unapologetically in love, mmm, yeah
I'm unapologetically in love
And that's unapologetically enough
No matter where it takes me
Even if it breaks me
I'm unapologetically all in
From the second that I started falling
And it don't even faze me
When they call me crazy
I'm unapologetically in love
I'm unapologetically in love, mmm, mmm

They're gonna say I fell too fast
Yeah, they're gonna say it's never gonna last
