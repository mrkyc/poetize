I put on my make up
Spray my perfume
Sat on the front porch, waitin' on you
Said we would catch up because it had been awhile
I hate to admit it
But my hands are shaking
Barely breathin'
Heart is racin'
Looks like feelings don't always change their minds

But you never called, never showed up
Guess some things never change
And just like living in a flashback
You let me down again

And that's why the past should be the past
Far behind, back of mind, out of the way
Let the memories burn and crash
'Cause sittin' here lookin' at the driveway
Is just tearin' my heart back in half
Like nothing's changed, except the time that's passed
And that's why goodbye should mean goodbye
The first time

I should know better
I hate that I still cry
Lookin' like a fool here watchin' for headlights
And kickin' myself for believin' in you again
I bet you're out drinkin' with a new blonde and
Telling her whatever's playin' is her song
Yeah, and helping her up into your Chevy instead

Even when you don't have me
You can still be the one to hurt me
It must feel good to know
That I'm still holdin' on to letting go

And that's why the past should be the past
Far behind, back of mind, out of the way
Let the memories burn and crash
'Cause sittin' here lookin' at the driveway
Is just tearin' my heart back in half
Like nothing's changed, except the time that's passed
And that's why goodbye should mean goodbye
The first time

Yeah, that's why the past should be the past
Far behind, back of mind, out of the way
Let the memories burn and crash
'Cause sittin' here looking at this driveway
Is just tearin' my heart back in half
Like nothing's changed except the time that's passed
And that's why goodbye should mean goodbye
So now I'm letting you go just like I shoulda tried
The first time
The first time, oh yeah
Yeah, that's why the past should be the past, oh
The first time
