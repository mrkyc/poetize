I pushed and pulled it
I let you do it too
Like it was metal
Like it was bulletproof
I forgot to cry when I was sad
I forgot to fight when I was mad
I made the moves that others would approve

But it ain't calculated
It ain't by the rules
And you can hate it, baby
But it's gonna do what it's gonna do, yeah

I don't have a machine heart
Can't tell it to stop, no button to push to start
You'll see it break, you'll see it fall apart
'Cause I don't have, I don't have
A machine heart, no
A machine heart

I kept it quiet
But now you'll hear it scream
'Cause good or bad or right or wrong
It's finally found its beat

It ain't by the rules
And you can hate it, baby
But it's gonna do what it's gonna do, yeah

I don't have a machine heart
Can't tell it to stop, no button to push to start
You'll see it break, you'll see it fall apart
'Cause I don't have, I don't have
A machine heart (A machine heart)
A machine heart (A machine heart)
A machine heart (A machine heart)
A machine heart (A machine heart)

I won't always get it right
But, hey, ain't that just life?
At least you're gettin' somethin' real
I won't always get it right
But, hey, ain't that just life?
I want it bad, wanna feel

No, 'cause I don't have a machine heart
Can't tell it to stop, no button to push to start
You'll see it break, you'll see it fall apart
'Cause I don't have, I don't have
A machine heart (A machine heart)
A machine heart (A machine heart)
I pushed and pulled it (I won't always get it right)
I let you do it too (But, hey, ain't that just life?)
I let you do it too (At least you're gettin' somethin' real)
Yeah, I pushed and pulled it (I won't always get it right)
I let you do it too (But, hey, ain't that just life?)
I let you do it too (I want it bad, wanna feel)
