I don't wanna be another skeleton in your closet
Another rose that you throw, 'cause you know that it ain't okay
Just a name on a stone in a row down the road forgotten
'Cause I was falling fast, now I'm just a dash between two dates

And I don't wanna be another heart in your graveyard
In the cold, hard dirt that you throw down
I don't wanna watch you drive away in a black car to a new bar
So you can find another
Hopeless, broken girl in a little black dress
And you take her, break her, lay her heart to rest in peace
Right here next to me

Maybe I was naive to believe you would never hurt me
But now I know why you hide in your darkest suit and shades
You put on a show, so nobody knows
Your hands and your shoes are dirty
I guess you don't need a shovel to dig a grave

And I don't wanna be another heart in your graveyard
In the cold, hard dirt that you throw down
I don't wanna watch you drive away in a black car to a new bar
So you can find another
Hopeless, broken girl in a little black dress
And you take her, break her, lay her heart to rest in peace
Right here next to me, yeah

You gonna go out one night when you see me out
'Cause the ghost of a broken heart don't stay six feet down
Yeah, you gonna go out one night when you see me out
'Cause the ghost of a broken heart don't stay six feet down

I don't wanna be another heart in your graveyard
In the cold, hard dirt that you throw down
I don't wanna watch you drive away in a black car to a new bar
So you can find another
Hopeless, broken girl in a little black dress
And you take her, break her, lay her heart to rest in peace
Right here next to me
Hopeless, broken girl
And you just take her, break her heart
Let her rest in peace
Right here next to me

I don't wanna be another heart
I don't wanna be another heart
In your graveyard, babe
