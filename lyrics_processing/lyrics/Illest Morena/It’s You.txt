Dito sa'king isipan, yeah dalas mapanaginipan, ahh
Andito ka rin noong nakaraan
Sa t'wing naaalala ka, ngiti sa'king mga mata
But life just ain't the same no more
You got her and I got bored
And if we talk I won't have shit to say
(Imma say 'fuck you' one time)
And they say there's a better way
I won't forget you either way
Forgiving wouldn't help me ease the pain

I know that it's not me, not me
It's you, it has always been you (it has always been you)
I got shit better to do than to be fucking with you
I got shit better to do than to be fucking with you
I know that it's not me, not me
It's you, it has always been you (it has always been you)
I got shit better to do than to be fucking with you
I got shit better to do than to be fucking with you

Sinagad, sinaid mo ang pasensya
'Yoko nang meron pang kakumpetensya
'Di ko kailangang paglaban pag-ibig mo
Kung sa'kin 'yan, 'yokong merong ka-share pa

But life just ain't the same no more
You got her and I got bored
And if we talk I won't have shit to say
(Bitch, fuck you!)
And they say there's a better way
I won't forget you either way
Forgiving wouldn't help me ease the pain

I know that it's not me, not me
It's you, it has always been you (it has always been you)
