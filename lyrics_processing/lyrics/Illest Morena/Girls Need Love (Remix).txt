You know, who fuck it is? Right?
It's Illest, baby (Rrr)

Baby, you're so fine, can't lie
'Pag nagkatitigan, hindi ako mapalagay
Gusto ko ng doja, gusto ko ng wine
Hindi ka sasakyan pero gusto kong sumakay
Yeah, gusto ko ng halik, pababa mula leeg
Nahuhuli mo kulit pati mga kiliti
Nanghihina mga tuhod ko pagka ngumingiti
Nangangalay na binti, puso ko namimintig
So I pick my phone, hello, lemme swallow you whole
It's cold, I'm bored, painitin natin ang 'yong home
You could come to me when you want that
'Di na 'ko magpapakipot pa, I'm real bad
Hit it from the front, from the side, from the back
Maybe you could make my lil' booty get fat

Girls can't never say they want it
Girls can't never say how
Girls can't never say they need it
Girls can't never say now
Gusto ko lang naman umibig
'Yoko lang maging uhaw
Andito ako when you need it
Please let me know when you down, oh, down
You might also like
I'ma need you to be honest, I'm honest
Pussy so good like it from another planet
I'm a busy girl, we gon' hit it, we gotta plan it
Tuesday night, I don't got a lotta classes
Baby, all hands on deck
Pockets so fat that it got me wet
'Kaw lang nakilala ko na napakalupit
'La kang ka-pareha, baby, baby, you the best
It's been one year since you been on my hit list
Got a question when you gonna hit this
'Yan ang aking tipo, mga medyo mala-misfit
Wifed up but I'll fuck you like a mistress

Girls can't never say they want it
Girls can't never say how
I'm a real bitch and I need it
You gon' have to put it down, oh, down
Girls need love, too
Girls, girls need love, too
Girl need love, too
You know that I'm here love, too
Girl need love, too
Girl need love, too
You know that I'm here love, too
