Yeah, I never do this
But I saw you from across the room
I had to talk to you
And I kick myself
For not introducing myself
Yeah you were lookin' cool in a red camero
Shootin' me looks like whiskey arrows
One kiss, one touch
Is something I'd do when it does

And just run with it
Where you wanna go?
Don't matter to me
As long as we put a little sun in it, ridin' away
This first time rush was made for us
To be young in it
Don't wanna waste one minute
Might just fall in love
Get drunk in it
Never know if we don't run with it

Well you got a toothbrush on my sink
And a tattoo only I've seen
Roll around in my head
In the other side of my bed
Yeah, we were spendin' time together
Let's be honest, we haven't even put a label on it
Might be too soon, too much
But if it walks like love and talks like love
You might also like
Well just run with it
Where you wanna go?
Don't matter to me
As long as we put a little sun in it, ridin' away
This first time rush was made for us
To be young in it
Don't wanna waste one minute
Might just fall in love
Get drunk in it
Never know if we don't run with it

So let's just run with it, yeah
Think of what we could've been missin'
If we didn't run with it
It's a hell of a life we're livin'

So let's run with it
Where you wanna go?
Don't matter to me
As long as we put a little sun in it, ridin' away
This first time rush was made for us
To be young in it
Don't wanna waste one minute
Might just fall in love
Get drunk in it, drunk in it
We'll never know if we don't run with it
So baby, let's run with it
