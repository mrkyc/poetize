Was it the moment
I wasn't holdin' nothin' back
Yeah, when I leaned in
Kissed you slow like that
Is it the way I make you laugh
Or the way I want you bad
Or the way I broke down your walls
Yeah, tell me
Tell me what made you fall

Baby, where did I go right
How'd I get so lucky
To get you to love me
And never in a million years
Did I think I'd find you
It's almost like God knew
That you were just what I needed
And I can't believe it
That I'm holdin' you tonight
Where did I go right
(Where did I go
Baby, where did I go right)

Is it magic
Is there something in the air
And this must be heaven
The way you take me there
Was it somethin' I did
Nothin' I wouldn't do
Tell me how'd I get you
You might also like
Baby, where did I go right
How'd I get so lucky
To get you to love me
And never in a million years
Did I think I'd find you
It's almost like God knew
That you were just what I needed
And I can't believe it
That I'm holdin' you tonight
Where did I go right
(Where did I go
Baby, where did I go right)

Where did I go right
(Where did I go
Baby, where did I go right)

Baby, where did I go right
How'd I get so lucky
To get you to love me
And never in a million years
Did I think I'd find you
It's almost like God knew
That you were just what I needed
And I can't believe it
That I'm holdin' you tonight
Where did I go right
(Where did I go
Baby, where did I go right)
