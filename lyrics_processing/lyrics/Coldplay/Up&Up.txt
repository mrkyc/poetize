Fixin' up a car, drivin' it again
Searchin' for the water, hopin' for the rain
Up and up, up and up
Down upon the canvas, workin' meal to meal
Waitin' for a chance to pick your orange field
Up and up, up and up
See a pearl form, a diamond in the rough
See a bird soaring high above the flood
It's in your blood, It's in your blood
Underneath the storm an umbrella is saying
Sitting with the poison takes away the pain
Up and up, up and up
(Oh, oh) It's saying

We're gonna get it, get it together right now
(Oh, oh) Gonna get it, get it together somehow
Gonna get it, get it together and flower
Woah, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
We're gonna get it, get it together I know
(Oh, oh) Gonna get it, get it together and flow
Gonna get it, get it together and go
Up, and up, and up

Lying in the gutter, aiming for the moon
Trying to empty out the ocean with a spoon
Up and up, up and up
How come people suffer? How come people part?
How come people struggle? How come people break your heart
Break your heart?
Oh, yes, I wanna grow, yes, I want to feel
Yes, I wanna know, show me how to heal it up
Heal it up
Oh, see the forest there in every seed
Angels in the marble waiting to be freed
Just need love, just need love
(Oh, oh) When the going is rough, saying
See Coldplay LiveGet tickets as low as $64You might also like
We're gonna get it, get it together right now
(Oh, oh) Gonna get it, get it together somehow
Gonna get it, get it together and flower
Woah, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
We're gonna get it, get it together I know
(Oh, oh) Gonna get it, get it together and flow
Gonna get it, get it together and go (Oh, oh)

And you can say what is, or fight for it
Close your mind or take a risk
You can say it's mine and clench your fist
Or see each sunrise as a gift


We're gonna get it, get it together right now
(Oh, oh) Gonna get it, get it together somehow
Gonna get it, get it together and flower
Woah, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
We're gonna get it, get it together I know
(Oh, oh) Gonna get it, get it together and flow
Gonna get it, get it together and go (Oh, yeah)
Up, and up, and up
We're gonna get it, get it together right now
(Oh, oh) Gonna get it, get it together somehow
Gonna get it, get it together and flower (Wooh!)
Woah, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
We're gonna get it, get it together I know
(Oh, oh) Gonna get it, get it together and flow (Ooh)
Gonna get it, get it together and go (Oh, yeah)
Up, and up, and up

Everyone, now, ey, ey
Oh-oh-oh
(Oh, oh) Oh-oh-oh, oh (Oh-oh-oh)
(Oh, oh) Oh-oh-oh (Oh-oh-oh)
(Oh, oh) Oh-oh-oh, oh (Oh-oh-oh)
(Oh, oh)

Fixin' up a car to drive in it again
When you're in pain, when you think you've had enough
Don't ever give up
Don't ever give up
