Like it's always gonna rain
They say it's gettin' harder
When's it ever gonna change?
Should take a look at
All the flowers in the field
For none was stressed like this
You got to believe in something
You got to believe in something
You got to believe
All things work together for the good
No matter what the cost
No matter all things lost
You got to believe
You got to believe
So much anger and confusion
Can make you lose your way
Forget the world around you
Make stronger faith and pray
Look at the birds up in the sky
No, they don't read, no
But soon they'll find a way to feed
