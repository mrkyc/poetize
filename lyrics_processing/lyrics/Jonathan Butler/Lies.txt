(Lies) Ooh
(Lies) Ooh, baby
(Lies) Well, well
We took a vow to be ever true
I lived up to mine, tell me, did you?
Someone saw you with your old lover
Hand in hand, I don't understand
You said it ended so long ago
You had me believing while
While you were deceiving me with lies (Lies)
Wish I could have seen it in your eyes (Lies)
But I never did (No, I never did)
Baby, lies (lies)
Thought I read the message in your eyes
But I was too caught up in your web of lies
Someone calls at the strangest of times
And I swear I hear a man's voice on the other side
You give me the same old story
It's just a friend
That's who it is, girl
I hate to say it
But my faith in you is shaking
Don't say you love me
When It's my heart you're breaking

Girl, you had me believing while

Baby, lies
Took so long for me to realize
Oh, but I was too blind to see, girl

Oh, baby
With a white lie
A wicked lie
Oh, baby
You cheated on me, you cheated on me
With a white lie, with a wicked lie
When I loved you, loved you
You cheated on me, you cheated on me
With a white lie, oh, with a wicked lie
But I loved you, baby, loved you, baby
