I've been waiting oh-so long, oh girl
(All over you)
Yeah, I'm so glad you're coming home, baby

Lying awake and I just can't shake
This incredible feeling inside me
Still on my mind after all this time
Memories of you still excite me

So glad you called to say you're coming home
So tonight is one night I won't be spending alone

I'm gonna be all over you
I'm gonna make up for the times we've been apart (Been apart)
I'm gonna be all over you
I'll be so good to you
You're so good to me, baby
Oh, darling

Got so much catching up to do
I can't wait 'cause I've been missing you (Missing you)
I'm gonna be ready, just wait and see
This time you're gonna get the best out of me
