Could you be the one I've been waitin' for?
The love of my life I've been lookin' for
Only wantin' you more and more
Could you be?
Is this a dream or is it real?
Something 'bout the way that it makes me feel
Calling through the endless space of time
Could you be?
Maybe it's factual
But then again maybe it's actual, oh
Could you be the face that I always see
Starin' in the mirror back at me?
Livin' in the garden of my mind
Could you be?
Could you be the voice whispering in my ear
Soft and gentle words that I love to hear?
How can I be sure when it fades away?
Could you be? Oh
Maybe it's factual
(Maybe, maybe just)
But then again maybe it's actual
(Actual but then again)
