(Ooh, darling)

In the middle of the night the doorbell rings
My baby's come to call
She wants to make love and I don't mind at all
No, baby
'Cause nobody loves me the way she does
She's got that special touch
It's just too much, the way she makes me climb the walls
Ooh, baby

When she reaches for me, sure ecstasy
Is just a kiss away
There's a passion inside that only she satisfies
When we go all the way

So, give me some love songs, candlelight and you
It's the perfect situation
Love songs, ooh, candlelight makes dreams come true
And all I wanna do is be with you

(Ooh, darling) Oh, darling

Turn down the lights, pull the shades
Have another glass of wine
Come a little closer, 'cause you know what's on my mind
Yes, you do
Baby, whisper in my ear (I love you)
Those words of love that I love to hear
No need to worry (Don't you worry)
'Cause we'll be here all night, yes we will

At your command, I'll do anything you say (Ooh-ooh)
When it comes to make love, we've mastered the game
And I'm ready, baby, to play

So, give me some love songs, ooh, candlelight and you
It's the perfect situation
Love songs, candlelight makes dreams come true
And all I wanna do is be with you

So, hold on tight
Through the night
Let me love you over (Over)
And over (Over)
And over again
(Love songs)
(Candlelight) Oh, oh, oh
(And you) Oh, baby, what a perfect situation
(Love songs) Sweet love
(Candlelight) Sweet love
(Dreams come true) Just you and me tonight
Makes everything so right
(Love songs) Touch me, baby
(Candlelight) Hold me, darling
(And you) Come a little closer
Let me love you, let me love you, let me love you again
(Love songs) And again and again!
(Candlelight) Oh!
(Dreams come true) You are the lady of, you're the lady of my life
(Sweet, sweet love) Sweet, sweet love
