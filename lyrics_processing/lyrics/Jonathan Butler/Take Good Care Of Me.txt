I've found the nerve to try again
Some broken hearts, given time will mend
Will you be gentle, if I surrender all to you, to you?
Please understand that I've got to be sure
The lessons I've learned, I can't ignore
Will you be gentle (You be gentle)
If I surrender all to you, to you?

Take good care of me
'Cause my heart's a tender thing, oh yeah
Take good care of me
'Cause this heart has known much pain
And could never handle hurting again
So, take good care of me, of me

Don't get me wrong, 'cause I really care
But a shadow of doubt has always been there
Please reassure me (Reassure me)
Hold me and kiss my fears away, my fears away (Fears away)
Something tells me it's right this time
It took a little while, but I made up my mind
Please reassure me (Reassure me)
That we'll be together come what may, come what may

I know forever's never promised to anyone
