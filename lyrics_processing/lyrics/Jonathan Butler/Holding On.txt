Nights, nights can be so cold
Without someone to hold
Man was never meant to be alone
And days, days can be so long
How can I go on
Without you? Ooh

I'm haunted by those memories
Everywhere I turn, I see your face, baby
I thought forgetting would be easy to do
But I realize that you just can not be replaced

I'm holding on
Loving in the past
I'm holding on
Don't know how long I'm gonna last
Oh, I'm holding on
Since you've been gone
I keep holding on (Holding on)
Holding on (Holding on)
Ooh, baby

Dreams I have come to fear
Seeing you appear
'Cause when I wake to find that you're not there
Maybe tomorrow
Will bring an end to the sorrow I feel (I feel)
I feel, girl

Lovers come and go
But you know it's a shame
When I'm making love to someone else
And calling out your name

(Holding on) Holding on, on and on and on
(Holding on) Holding on

I'm holding on
Loving in, loving in the past, oh baby
Don't know how long I'm gonna last, oh-oh-oh
Since you've been gone
I keep holding on (Holding on)
Loving in, loving in the past
(Don't know how long I'm gonna last) Yeah, baby
(Since you've been gone)
(I keep holding on, holding on)
Loving in, loving in the past
(Don't know how long I'm gonna last) Yeah, yeah
(Since you've been gone)
