My ambitionz of a ryda-da
Put her in a YSL and that Prada-da
Keep the pistol on the side-ide-ide
In the Lamborghini smokin on that la-la-la
She got her hair in the wind, eyebrows on fleek
'1-5 Bonnie & Clyde, Nicki and Meek
I gave her keys to the condo, keys to the Jeep
Say "You jigglin, baby", gave her the whole damn fleet
I'll always ride for you baby
And if shit get hard, you know I pull right on the side of you, baby
Yeah, I met him in the dope gang, he had no name
Back when you could get a half or a whole thang
Back when we all ever needed was the cocaine
Bricks in the 600 why they call me Rogaine
40 in the sti-dash, fuck around and be roadkill
With the top down, feelin like

No whip, now we in the Wraith, road rage
Keep it gangsta, probably sent one of them cold things
With ya, nah, I ain't mad at ya
Get out of line, probably throw a couple jabs at him
Hit Rodeo, probably throw a couple bags at ya
In my 2Pac voice - I ain't mad at ya
Take the wheel, see if you can drive while I eat it
My fitted flew off, but I don't need it, tell me what I need
You need a bitch that's gon' blast, spend cash with ya
Same time fuck good, drive fast for you
Yeah, I ride it like rah-da-da-rah
He eat the pussy like la-la-la-la
Why you gotta tell a nigga bid'ness?
Fine nigga Friday, you know a nigga live this
Hit you with the helicopter tongue
Then fuck you 'til the helicopter come

Hittin' corners in my Impala (My ambitionz of a ryda)
Slidin down that pole for a dollar
Nada, tell that girl holla (My ambitionz of a ryda)
I done brought the thug life out her
Got her stuffin bricks in that Prada (My ambitionz of a ryda)
And she love when I'm inside her
And can't nobody divide us
