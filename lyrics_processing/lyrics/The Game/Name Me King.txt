Open the pearly gates, bright white lights Madonna
Angels lined up in my honour, your honour
Name me king
Name me king
I took the crown, infiltrated they fortress
Kidnap the queen, rode away on white horses
Name me king
Name me king

Brick by brick I built my fortress
My queen beautiful, Lamborghini is gorgeous
Phantom in the courtyard, 400 horses
Growl make the towers fall, 911 Porsches
Number 9 Jordans pause the Air Forces
Kush clouds, blunts lit by Olympic torches
Gold bars melted and what returned? Rolexes
Niggas got Breitlings to burn
Loyalty to earn
Royalty to who it may concern this a Los Angeles King Snapback
Sippin' 'tron out the Stanley cup, I don't give a fuck
Drown them in the moat and let the bridge up
My son, my heir in Nike Airs, name my little nigga King
Meaning you should bow at his feet 'fore God intervene
Even when I was in front of triple beams
Stack paper to the ceiling, to the fiends I was king

Raise your glass for the last of the kingpins
The crown in the Maserati grill is minglin'
Rollies cross oceans like Frank out in England
The Gay Pride bezel rainbow like it's spring again
Haah! Crack rock, crack rock nigga
My SC430 was a drop nigga
Go figure, this nigga play Go Fish
My only pet was fish scale not a goldfish
My young baby sitter now my old bitch
Blowjobs cause what I sold made her nose itch
(Eughk!) It's the king being crowned
Watch my predecessor fall like the sun goin' down (God!)
It's sunset, this is Sun Tzu (War!)
He paved the way I brought a ton through (Whooo!)
Been on his heels like a gum shoe (Eughk!)
He took the throne so I could run through
Open the pearly gates, bright white lights Madonna
Angels lined up in my honour, your honour
Name me king

I took the crown, infiltrated they fortress
Kidnap the queen, rode away on white horses

Rose petals at my feet when I'm steppin' out the Rolls
The royal penis is clean, Versace belt gold
Sweatin' like a slave where them pies get sold
Accompanied by fourteen karats stold
Adjust the temperature, let the heat rise up
Like Jesus Shuttlesworth in that glass jar
Blue flame glowing like a Avatar
Five more minutes says the silent gold hand goin' 'round on my Audemar
Angels in the wing, ass naked, do your thing
Show me what that baking soda bring, do it for your king
Every time I look up, they cook up
I be the master of them P's I got the hook up
From New Orleans to Virginia
I told her stuff them pies in her Virginia
Never been caught, can't be bought, she's a winner
Fly 'em south for the winter make it back home for dinner
Open the pearly gates, bright white lights Madonna
Angels lined up in my honour, your honour
Name me king
Name me king
I took the crown, infiltrated they fortress
Kidnap the queen, rode away on white horses
Name me king
