Everybody's talkin' 'bout the super model world
Cindy, Naomi and that whole bunch of girls
Redheads and brunettes and blondes with blue eyes
They come in every shape, yea they come
In every size
You know I love everything they do
I check 'em out on every Pay-Per-View
Oh, but honey that was way before I met you
And then

You walked in with legs up to your neck
You walked in I'm a physical wreck
You walked in I've lost my cool babe
But what'd you expect
When you walk in baby love begins
When you walk by baby ooh my my
When you come around my jaw hits the ground
When you shake your thing I jump outta my skin
When you cross the floor I scream
"more baby more"
When you flash your smile you drive me wild
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Everyone's checkin' out the glossy magazines
Madonna, Diana, you know the whole scene
The cover girls, the centerfolds and every movie star
And all those pretty ladies down there
At the local bar
I couldn't think of nothing better to do
Than checkin' out a little wiggle or two
Oh, but honey that was way before I met you
And then
