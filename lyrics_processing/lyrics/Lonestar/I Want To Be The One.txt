I see those other guys
I hear them tell you lies
That same old song they sing
They only want one thing
I know you're searching for
Something that's so much more
And I wanna give it to ya

I wanna be the one
The one who makes you feel something real
The one and only one
The one who gets down deep and plays for keeps
I wanna be the one
The one who talks it through - listens to you
Please let me be the one
The one who truly knows you - just let me show you

I wanna make you see
The possibilities
Of all that we could be
Through all eternity
And when you fall in love
Yeah really fall in love
I wanna be the one
