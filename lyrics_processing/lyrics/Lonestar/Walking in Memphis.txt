Put on my blue suede shoes and I boarded the plane
Touched down in the land of the Delta Blues
In the middle of the pouring rain
W.C. Handy - won't you look down over me
'Cause I got a first-class ticket
And I'm blue as a boy can be

Walking in Memphis
Walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale
Walking in Memphis
But do I really feel the way I feel?

Saw the ghost of Elvis
Down on Union Avenue
Followed him up to the gates of Graceland
And watched him walk right through
Now security they did not see him
They just hovered 'round his tomb
There's a pretty little thing
Waitin' on "The King"
Down in the Jungle Room

Walking in Memphis
Walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale
Walking in Memphis
But do I really feel the way I feel?
See Lonestar LiveGet tickets as low as $73You might also like
They've got catfish on the table
They've got gospel in the air
And Reverend Green be glad to see you
When you haven't got a prayer
You got a prayer in Memphis

Now Muriel plays the piano
Every Friday at the Hollywood
And they brought me down to see her
And they asked me if I would
Do a little number
And I sang with all my might
She said
"Tell me are you a Christian"
And I said "Ma'am I am tonight"

Walking in Memphis
Walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale
Walking in Memphis
But do I really feel the way I feel?
Walking in Memphis
Walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale

Walking in Memphis
Walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale
