Lucinda Jones workin' at the IHOP
Ten years worth of bacon, eggs an' tears
She's waited on every creed an' color
While waitin' on this day to get here
Graveyard shifts, two big tips
Makin' every quarter count
Was worth it all to see her son
In that cap an' gown

There are times in life when you gotta crawl
Lose your grip, trip an' fall
When you can't lean on no-one else
That's when you find yourself
I've been around an' I've noticed that
Walkin's easy when the road is flat
Them danged ol' hills'll get you every time
Yeah, the good Lord gave us mountains
So we could learn how to climb

Bobby, Bobby Dunn came back from the war
Lost his leg but they couldn't take his will
Hell bent to run in that local marathon
He trained through the endless pain an' pills
It hurt so bad that sometimes
He just had to cry
He didn't stop until he crossed
That finish line

This world ain't fair
It can knock you on your butt
You can just lie there
Or you can get back up
You gotta get back up

There are times in life when you gotta crawl

When you can't lean on no-one else
