Don't let's talk about Lisa
Don't let's even start
Let's leave Lisa out of this one
Lisa broke my heart

Gwendolyn was splendid, but her tendency to spending
Spun a little out of control
Two nights on the town and
My poor bank account was crawling around on the floor

And pretty young Alicia, she could take a piece of your heart
And lead you to the light
Lucy, Melinda, Loretta and Lucinda
We could go on all night but

Don't let's talk about Lisa
Don't let's even start
Let's leave Lisa out of this one
Lisa broke my heart

Priscilla was a killer, meaner than Godzilla
But oh what a pretty girl and
Dawn in the dawn with her pom-poms on
She could twirl like a tilt-a-whirl
See Lonestar LiveGet tickets as low as $73You might also like
There's wonderful women all over the world
I've said it again and again
But she whose name must not be spoken
Has it all over all of them so

Don't let's talk about Lisa
Don't let's even start
Let's leave Lisa out of this one
Lisa broke my heart

You can talk about the weather
Cotton or leather
And do you think the Beatles
Shoulda really gotten back together
Talk about the truth
Mantle or Ruth
Fabio, DiMaggio or John Wilkes Boothe

Don't let's talk about Lisa
Don't let's even start no, no
Don't let's talk about Lisa please sir
Lisa broke my heart
Oh Lisa she's off limits man
Lisa broke my heart

You can talk about Hanson, Marilyn Manson
And do you think they'll ever have a show down in Branson
Talk about desire, Sosa or McGwire
And is we in the fryin' pan or is we in the fire
Talk about what's real and what you really feel
And how's about those mini skirts on Ally McBeal
Talk about the X-Files, Macaroons and mistrails
