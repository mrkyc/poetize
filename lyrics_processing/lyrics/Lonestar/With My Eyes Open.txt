Do you know what I see
In those eyes looking back at me?
Every safe road that ever brings me home
Every place I wanna be
Every secret I'll never keep
Every last kiss every night before I go to sleep
Every thing I have, everything I'll ever want

I'm so in love
When I look in those eyes I can't look deep enough
Into you
The further I fall the further I want to
I look at you I see the man I want to be
My whole life planned out in front of me
God only knows how far this dream is going
'Cause that's just with my eyes open

Do you know what it's like
Lying here in your arms tonight?
Your soft breath falling on my skin
We're almost surrendering
But wait for one more kiss
Baby your too beautiful
