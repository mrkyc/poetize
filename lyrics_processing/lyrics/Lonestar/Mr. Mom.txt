Oh, yeah

Lost my job, came home mad
Got a hug and a kiss and "that's too bad"
She said, "I can go to work until you find another job"
I thought, I like the sound of that
Watch TV and take long naps
Go from a hard working dad to being Mr. Mom

Well
Pampers melt in a Maytag dryer
Crayons go up one drawer higher
Rewind Barney for the fifteenth time
Breakfast six, naps at nine
There's bubble gum in the baby's hair
Sweet potatoes in my lazy chair
Been crazy all day long
And it's only Monday Mr. Mom

Football, soccer, and ballet
Squeeze in Scouts and PTA
And there's that shopping list she left that's seven pages long
How much smoke can one stove make?
The kids won't eat my charcoal cake
It's more than any man can take
Being Mr. Mom

There's bubble gum in the baby's hair
Sweet potatoes in my lazy chair
Been crazy all day long
And it's only Monday Mr. Mom

Before I fall in bed tonight
If the dog didn't eat the classifieds
I'm gonna look just one more time

'Cause
Pampers melt in a Maytag dryer
Crayons go up one drawer higher
Rewind Barney for the eighteenth time
Breakfast six, naps at nine
There's bubble gum in the baby's hair
Sweet potatoes in my lazy chair
Been crazy all day long
Oh, been crazy all day long
And it's only Monday Mr. Mom
Oh, Mr. Mom
Balancin' checkbooks, juggling bills
Thought there was nothing to it
Baby, now I know how you feel
What I don't know is how you do it
Oh
