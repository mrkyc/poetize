It's that man comin' up from the land of the CPT
"What's my motherfuckin' name?" Eazy-E
Comin' through with a big lick for '94
Showin' all of y'all them true-ass gangsta flows
So bow-down, bow-wow, the big dog's in town
And them guts is the only thing a nigga pound
Laid back as I blow a fat sack
Hittin' switches for them bitches, bendin' corners in a Cadillac
So take a ride on the Ruthless side
With the E to the A-Z-Y
That nigga makin' more off your hits than you do
You fools need to recognize this crew when I roll through
Tryin' to speak up on the OG, nigga, you don't know me
Raise up off these nuts, lil' wanna-be
'Cause I peel caps if need be
And ain't nothin' you gon' bring gon' see me, just to let you know

It's the E comin' up from the gank
So, nigga, let me ride all the way to the bank
'Cause ain't nothin' on my mind but them chips
Gotta have a grip when a nigga dip
Back to the path on them Compton streets
Where the niggas get beat when us gangstas meet
And fools gettin' mad 'cause they can't ride like I ride
Front and back, dippin' side to side
And it's been like that since I was a BG
"It's the E," that's what they scream when they see me
Mama said it'd be days like this
Fools screamin' that I put 'em in a twist
Thought you had it bad, is it really all good
If the homies only knew in the hood
That you was gettin' done like a two dollar ho?
It's just a lil' something from the E to let you know
One more time for the rhyme again (Eazy)
Comin' from the C-O-M-P-T-O-N (E)
Just to let you know (Eazy)

It's still the CPT, nothin' more, nothin' less
On a quest to put that bomb in my chest
'Cause them busta-ass niggas can't see what I'm sayin'
They think the E be playin' (What?)
But I ain't givin' up nothin' but this Glock in your mouth
So recognize that or get your punk ass knocked out
So if you wanna ride, nigga, jump on in
Sip a cup of gin, ain't no friends when it come to ends
So no hard feelings when you niggas be dealin'
With the original Compton criminal
'Cause the only thing poppin' is the snaps
And ain't no fun when a nigga be tapped, perhaps
But a nigga like the E ain't trippin', though
I'm just here to let you niggas know

You have your own freedom of choice
So you do what the fuck you feel like doin'
