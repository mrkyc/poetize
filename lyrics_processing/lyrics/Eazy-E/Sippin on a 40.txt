But buy you a couple of extra one's for the neighborhood rats

Trick yo the home girl
But sit you like a loose goose

Well, bring B.G. Knocc Out back a motherfuckin' 40o'

Back in the '4 to another store

Pass across the light
Now, here's what you gotta do
Get in ya left lane and make a motherfuckin' U

Let's get at least 10 40's and at least 10 22's
That should be enough for the whole motherfuckin' crew
Plus they got endo a nigga's gonna be double blitz

Oh, give me some Zig-Zags and two packs of Doublemint


Yo Dresta

What's up

Did you bring back some gum?
Hell yeah

Good, now a nigga breath won't be yo hum
Now pass me a stick
So I can spit game at this trick
Cause beer breath and tricks don't mix

Y'all don't give a fuck what a punk bitch think
Cause my breath always stank every time I take a drink
40's I be downin', I'm drownin' myself
Let me hit the joint and I'll be clownin' everybody else

You won't be clownin' me, cause I got jokes for your trick ass
Oh bitch you tryin' tah bag, I got jokes for your bitch ass
Well, let me hit the joint once again and we can go, G
But, oh, let me take another sip off the O.E
