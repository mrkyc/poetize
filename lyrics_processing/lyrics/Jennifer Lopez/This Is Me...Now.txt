I watched my mother miss out on her life
All those could-have-beens became her sacrifice
But here in the darkness, it's not the future nor the past
And 'cause it's meant to be with you, boy, it will last
You met me halfway

Growin' pains, broke some chains in every chapter
Now we know what it takes for our ever after
Took some lefts, now we're right here where we are
And I sing

This is me now
This is me now
And I took my time, lot of winters, summers, baby
And I healed my heart, but I love who I am lately
This is me now

When I was a girl they'd ask me what I'd be (What you gon' be?)
A woman in love is what I grew up wantin' to be (In love's what I wanted to be)
It's my melody, the symphony I sing (Sing)
And your every word gave me strength to follow my dreams (Yes, you did)
You met me halfway
You might also like
Face to face, tell the truth, no holdin' back (No holdin' back)
We put in work, overcame all the disasters (All the disasters)
Time apart brought us right right here's where we are (Where we're meant to be)
And I sing (And I sing)

This is me now (Love me as I am)
This is me now (This is me now)
And I took my time (And I took my time)
Lot of winters, summers, baby (Baby)
And I healed my heart (My heart)
But I love who I am lately (And I do it for myself)
This is me now
(Had a lot to learn, had to learn to grow, how to find my way, yeah)

Take me as I am (Can you?)
And I'll take you as you are (And I will)
And we'll build this life together
I found my shootin' star
The double the shine, the greener the diamond
One of a kind, the clearer the timing
Ain't nothin' change, you know paps goin' crazy
Beep-beep, pull up in a black Bugazzi
Baby, got a love that'll last forever
Old things, new things, it's a new level
All gas, no brakes, you could come rev it
Baby, you know when you want me
I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready
This is me now
