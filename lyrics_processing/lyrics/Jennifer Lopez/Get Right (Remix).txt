I ain't Mr. Right, I'm Mr. Right Now (Oh)
I keep women in thongs coming along (Oh)
Invisibly set stones, some of them prone (Woo)
I can tell you that you never had someone this long
One night, have them bumpin' my song like mmm, mmm, girl
You ain't know I was coming this strong
Now you know not to come at me wrong
I get right, uh

You're looking just a little too hard at me
Standing just a little too close to me
You're saying not quite enough to me
You're sipping just a little too slow for me
No doubt you play it real cool, homie
Got me thinking what is it you do for me?
Tripping (Tripping) a little more than I should be
So let yourself go and get right with me

Your lips talking 'bout I, "Play too much"
Can't a woman take advantage of what she wants?
My hips moving, oh, so slow (So slow)
Bar tab looking like a car note (Car note)
All I need is you here right by my side (Woo)
Take whatever you want, baby, let's ride (Oh)

Rock up wrist watch, six inch Timbs
Button-up shirt cuffed with the French trim
So you can tell a man get to the right (Oh)

And this is just to get to the flight (Oh)
I like the way it fit to you tight
So I'ma show you the world in a day
'Fore it even get to the night
