I put it down for a brother like you
Give it to you right in the car, that's you
We can first give you some of this, that's you
And you're all out loving that JLove, true

Hold up, I can get you run up
Pull your trigger, go and get your gun up
I'ma tie my hair up top
Put a pin in it, now I'm ready, let it rock
Keep it number one, that's easy mathematics
Keep it number one, baby, ain't no static
Got that hourglass for you, baby, look at these legs
No brakes, go green, no red
If you wanna kill the body, gotta start with the head
Put it on you, I'ma need about four, five beds
'Cause I love my papi

I didn't see it, but I see it now
Think I love you and I need you now
Ain't had none like you in a while

I luh ya papi, I luh ya papi
I luh ya, luh ya, luh ya papi

I luh ya papi

All day, twenty-four hour
Feeling like I want one when it's crowded
If you wanna hear your name, I shout it
Boy, you the shit, go and take a power shower
And I'm feeling like it's me and you, I don't doubt it
You can drive it how you want, I ain't tryna count mileage (Count mileage)
I'm loving me some you
Started from the bottom, baby, then we went roof
'Cause I love my papi

I didn't see it, but I see it now
Think I love you and I need you now
Ain't had none like you in a while

Baby, you the shit, I-I love you, mami (Haan)
Sh-sh-shorty got me catching feelings (Haan)
In that Wraith drop, reaching for the ceiling
South Bronx, Teterboro just overseas
Take the pins out her hair, drop to her knees (Whoop)
Oh my, I'm a don like Omar (Omar)
Speed it up slow, ma, throw it back, toma (Haa)
Rock-rock Gators like my Detroit players
You can hate to love us, you can love to hate us (Haan, whoop)
From the bottom, it been real
And from the bottom, shorty been trill (Ha)
And even though we made it to the top (Top)
Still JLo from the-the the block
And I love you, mami, I-I love you, mami
Baby, you the shit, I-I love you, mami

I think I love just who you are
We haven't grown apart, this is just the start
Where life begin, all the way to the end
And we started as friends, boy, I do love

I luh ya papi (Haan), I luh ya papi (Montana from the block)
I luh ya, luh ya, luh ya papi
I luh ya papi (J-JLo from the block, haan)
