Different roads, two lost souls
Never thought we'd find our way back
Could've lost what matters most
How could I live with that?
Missing your body climbing on top of me, slippin' inside of me
Way that I ride it, bodies aligning, look at our timing
Forget about the world when we're alone
Only thing that ever felt, felt like home

Twenty years ago, feels like time has froze
We're living in the greatest love story ever told
We never let it go and never told a soul
We could've been the greatest love story never told

You take a little right down the middle, so close, they can't divide
It's destiny how we found each other twice in one lifetime
I tried life without ya, been thinkin' 'bout ya, you don't know how long
And we got so much time left, this time, we won't let go

Twenty years ago, feels like time has froze
We're living in the greatest love story ever told
We never let it go and never told a soul
We could've been the greatest love story never told
You might also like
Then I wrote the love we spoke
The story goes
Ever after, every chapter
Now I see, you're part of me
I'll always sing
Ever after, another chapter

Twenty years ago, feels like time has froze (Time froze)
We're living in the greatest love story ever told
We never let it go and never told a soul (All this time, never told a soul)
We could've been the greatest love story never told (We could be, I know)
Twenty years ago, feels like time has froze
We're living in the greatest love story ever told (And you know this is love, baby)
We never let it go and never told a soul (I never let it go, we never told a soul)
We could've been the greatest love story never told (We knew we had it all)

The greatest love I've ever known, I've ever known
And now I know I never got to be alone
The greatest love I've ever known, I've ever known
