Wasted on your love
Wasted on the things you don't remember about yourself
The way you turn me on
It's easy to forget all of the ways you scare me, too, yeah
You come for all my words
Lovingly examining the angles of my point of view
You hand me only parts
But I can see the facets of your love that you don't want me to

All of my love
Swing and a miss every time that we talk
And now all I got is pieces of us
Oh, how my luck goes down when we talk
And now all I got is pieces of us

Well, I'm the second one
He was first, and now I'm here without a clue of what to do
I take it personal
Constantly comparing all my actions to the ones you knew

All of my love
Swing and a miss every time that we talk
And now all I got is pieces of us
Oh, how my luck goes down when we talk
And now all I got is pieces of us

Our love, our trust
No matter which way you cut it
There's pieces of us
Our love, our trust
No matter which way you cut it
There's pieces of us

Our love, our trust
No matter which way you cut it
(There's pieces of us)
Our love, our trust
No matter which way you cut it
(There's pieces of us)
Our love, our trust

All of my love
Swing and a miss every time that we talk
And now all I got is pieces of us
Oh, how my luck goes down when we talk
And now all I got is pieces of us

Our love, our trust
No matter which way you cut it
There's pieces of us
Our love, our trust
No matter which way you cut it
