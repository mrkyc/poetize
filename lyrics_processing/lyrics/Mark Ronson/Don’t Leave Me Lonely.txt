Tell me, baby, what's on your heart?
'Cause I've been wandering around in your dark, yeah
I've got way too many questions, always learning lessons
Loving too hard
Give me just a second to breathe
'Cause you've been turning all the tables on me, yeah
Whenever you would get up in your feelings, I would always listen
Now you turn around and leave

Oh, if we fall apart, let's do it in the dark
Hit me in the heart this time

Don't you leave me lonely tonight
'Cause I won't forgive you (Won't forgive you)
Don't you leave me lonely tonight
'Cause I can't forget you (Can't forget you)
I toss and turn alone in my bed
When you should be laying here beside me instead
Oh, don't you leave me lonely tonight
'Cause I won't forgive you, forgive you, forgive you this time

Tell me if this love is a lie
'Cause the ticking time is passing me by, babe
I'm waiting, but the second hand is turning
Burning all the circles in my mind, eh
Anticipating 'cause you know I'm never satisfied
And I don't want to hear the reasons why, why, why we fight, eh
You might also like
Oh, if we fall apart, let's do it in the dark
Hit me in the heart this time

Don't you leave me lonely tonight
'Cause I won't forgive you (Won't forgive you)
Don't you leave me lonely tonight
'Cause I can't forget you (Can't forget you)
I toss and turn alone in my bed
When you should be laying here beside me instead
Oh, don't you leave me lonely tonight
'Cause I won't forgive you, forgive you, forgive you this time

Don't you leave me lonely tonight
'Cause I won't forgive you
Oh, don't you leave me lonely tonight
'Cause I won't forget you
Oh, I toss and turn alone in my bed
When you should be laying here beside me instead
Oh, don't you leave me lonely
