Stop me, oh, oh, oh, stop me
Stop me if you think that you've heard this one before
Stop me, oh, oh, oh, stop me
Stop me if you think that you've heard this one before
'Cause nothing's changed, I still love you
Oh, I still love you
But only slightly, only slightly less
Than I used to, my love

I was delayed, I was waylaid
An emergency stop, I saw the last ten seconds of life
I crashed down on the crossbar, yeah
And the pain was enough to make a shy, bald Buddhist reflect
And plan a mass murder, yeah
Who said I lied to her?
Who said I lied? 'Cause I never, never
Who said I lied? Because I never, yeah

I was detained, I was restrained
I broke my knee, I broke my spleen and then he really laid into me (Yeah)
Friday night in outpatients
Who said I lied to her?
Who said I lied? 'Cause I never, never
Who said I lied to her?
So I drank one, it became four
And when I fell on the floor, I drank more

Stop me, oh, oh, oh, stop me
Stop me if you think that you've heard this one before
Stop me, oh, I said stop me
Stop me if you think that you've heard this one before
'Cause nothing's changed, I still love you
Oh, I still love you
But only slightly, only slightly less
Than I used to, my love, yeah, yeah
Set free me, why don't you? Yeah
Get out my life, why don't you? Yeah
'Cause you don't really love me, no
You just keep me hangin' on, yeah, yeah
Set me free, why don't you, girl?
Get out my life, why don't you, baby?
'Cause you don't really love me, no, no, no
