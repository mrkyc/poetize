I like to wait to see how things turn out
If you apply some pressure
I like to wait to see how things turn out
If you apply some pressure

You know that I would love to see you next year
I hope that I am still alive next year
You magnify the way I think about myself
Before you came I rarely thought about myself
Behind your veil I found the body underneath
Inside your head were things I'd never thought about
You know that I would love to see you next year
I hope that I am still alive next year
What's my view? Well, how am I supposed to know?
Write a review? Well, how objective can I be?
