Damn, we got a little bit crazy
Wasn't expectin' you, baby
Lock my heart, with a key
Had to take some time for just me
Worryin' about my safety
Thinkin' about you daily
Are you more than a tease?
Got me swingin' from a trapeze

And not just anybody made feel like that
Not just anybody sets me on fire
Gotta be the one to take a risk
Ain't nobody else on my list, just you
So don't go and let me down like that
I don't wanna be the one alone
I never mess around like you, my love

Why must we hide?
Oh, I feel it so, so deep inside
Promise you're trying
And look at me in the eye

You're acting just a little bit shady
Feeling cut off from you lately
Oh, won't you call me back, please?
Need to know you're falling as deep
Please, don't leave me lonely
Please, don't let me down
Will I wake up alone this time?
You might also like
Promise me heaven
I'll wait until you lay me down
I wanna be near you, wanna be near you
Promise me heaven
I'll wait until you lay me down
I wanna be near you
Every night, I'm thinkin' 'bout you

Why must we hide?
Oh, I feel it so, so deep inside
Promise you're trying
And look at me in the eyes

But you don't let it show
You don't say how you feel, how you feel
You don't say what you want
You don't say how you feel, it's no good
Yeah, you don't let it show
You don't say how you feel, I can feel
It's real, it's not even real
You don't say what you want
You don't say how you feel, it's no good
Could be good, it could be so good, yeah, yeah
Why must we hide?
Oh, I feel it so, so deep inside
Promise you're trying
And look at me in the eye

Tell me, tell me, tell me if you feel this feeling real
Or I'll let you go, let you go
Tell me, tell me, tell me if you feel this feeling real
And I'll let you know, I'll let you know
I don't wanna let you go, you go
