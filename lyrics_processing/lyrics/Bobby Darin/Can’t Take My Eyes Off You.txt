Give it to the band, woo, uh-huh

You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off you
You'd be like heaven to touch
Oh, I wanna touch you so much
At long last love has arrived
And I thank God I'm alive
You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off you

Pardon the way that I stare
But nobody else can compare
The sight of you makes me weak
There are no words I can speak
And if you feel as I feel
Oh, let me know that it's real
You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off you

Give it back to the band now
Woo
Right now, do it to it, woo
Put it right back on the money
You might also like
I love you, baby (Baby)
And if it is quite alright
I need you, baby (Baby)
To warm up my winter nights
I love you, baby (Baby)
So trust in me when I say (When I say)
When I say (When I say)
Oh, pretty baby (Baby)
Don't let me down, I pray
Pretty, pretty baby (Baby)
Now that I have found you'll stay
And let me love you, baby (Baby)
Come let me love you

You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off you
You'd be like heaven to touch, mama
I wanna touch you so much
At long last love has arrived
And how I thank God I'm alive
You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off you

Oh, you're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off you
You're just too good to be true
Cannot take my eyes off you
You're much too much to be true
Won't take my eyes off you
You're just too, too, too
Can't take my eyes off you
Ain't you too good to be true
