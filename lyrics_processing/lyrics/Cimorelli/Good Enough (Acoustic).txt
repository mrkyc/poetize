I don't know why he left but he's been gone for seven months
There's a tension in the air that's not so fun
Mom's been losing weight
I can tell she's not okay
I wonder if it's my fault he went away

I feel like I'm drowning
I feel like I'm broken
I've been ripped down the middle
I am ripped down the middle
My house is a warzone
My life is a battle
And I'm stuck in the middle
I am stuck in the middle

Whatever I did I would take it all back
I'd circle the world the world to get back what we had
Tell me what must I do to deserve your love
Is there anyway I'll ever be good enough
Is there anyway I'll be good enough

I don't know why he left but I don't think he's coming back
Relationships don't come easy to me
I never learned how to love or how to stay when things get rough
How can you know something you've never seen?

I feel like a hurricane my heart is breaking
I've been ripped down the middle I am ripped down the middle
I feel like a lost cause
All I ever do is screw up
Ever since I was little
I've been ripped down the middle

Whatever I did I would take it all back
I'd circle the world the world to get back what we had
Tell me what must I do to deserve your love
Is there anyway I'll ever be good enough
Is there anyway I'll be good enough

I've spent my life
Trying to hide
All of my weakness from everyone

I've tried so hard
To play the part
Cover all my scars
But it's never enough
No it's never enough
Whatever I did I would take it all back
I'd circle the world for you Mom and Dad
Tell me what must I do to deserve your love
Is there anyway I'll ever be good enough
Is there anyway I'll ever be good enough
Is there anything in this world that I could do
Is there anyway I'll ever be
Maybe I'm already
