Drowning, out in the sea praying for waves
To carry me till the day breaks
I wanna wake up on the shore
Falling, stars raining fire around me
Backs to the wall and I can't breathe
Don't think I can take any more

I need a sign, to get me through the night
I need someone to fight, to bring me back to life
There's a voice, that's calling through the storm
I know there's something more, I know there's something more

And I will still hope for it
I will still hope for it
No matter what comes, fire or flood
I will hold on, you are still good
And I will still hope for it

Demons, twisting the thoughts in my head
Speaking to me in my own voice
Telling me I should give up
You might also like
There's a light, that's tearing through the dark
The maker of the stars is fighting for my heart
There's a voice, that's calling out my name
Reaching through the pain, healing every scar

I will still hope for it
I will still hope for it
No matter what comes, fire or flood
I will hold on, you are still good
And I will still hope for it

You're with me in the fight, with me in the war
You're the one who lifts me when my knees hit the floor
You're with me in the light, with me in the dark
And when I can't see I know you're with me in my heart
You're with me in the fight, with me in the war
You're the one who lifts me when my knees hit the floor
You're with me in the light, with me in the dark
And when I can't see I know you're with me in my heart

And I will still hope for it
I will still hope for it
No matter what comes, fire or flood
I will hold on, you are still good
No matter what comes, fire or flood
I will hold on, you are still good
I will still hope for it
You're with me in the fight, with me in the war
You're the one who lifts me when my knees hit the floor
You're with me in the light, with me in the dark
And when I can't see I know you're with me in my heart
You're with me in the fight, with me in the war
You're the one who lifts me when my knees hit the floor
You're with me in the light, with me in the dark
