That night, in the parking lot
It was late and we talked for hours
You walked me to my car
And I held my breath as you reached out
And put your arms around me

That night, at the airport
You told me all about the planes
We talked about our dreams
Fears and insecurities
And that was the night I started falling for you
I'll never forget when you read my letter
You looked up with tears in your eyes
And I kept quiet but my heart spoke out in my chest

She said
Please stay
Don't leave
Just stay
Don't you remember what you said to me

You said you'd always be here, but now you're gone
You said it was forever, but I guess forever's not so long
And I know people change their minds
But when it comes to you
I don't think I'll ever change mine
You might also like
You touch my hands as you lean in my window
And said be careful as I drove away
Did it scare you how much I cared
Is that the reason that you couldn't stay
And I don't like sports but I know all his teams
And lately, everything's reminding me of him

And now yesterday was your birthday
And we barely talked
This is the part where I'm supposed to move on
So I'll stay up late, try to distract myself
So I don't fall asleep thinking of you

You stopped calling me sweet
You stopped calling at all
And I got tired of fighting for you
To stay
Cause you leave
That's what you do
So why would you say all these things to me

You said you'd always be here, but now you're gone
You said it was forever, but I guess forever's not so long
And I know people change their minds
But when it comes to you
I don't think I'll ever change mine
I'll go on long walks
And work on keeping my mouth shut
'Cause heaven forbid
I slip up and say I miss you
And ruin everything
Cause we both know
That I'm too much for you

And some nights I'll cry so hard
And wonder if you can feel it all the way across town
I hope you can
You told me I was special
And I thought you really meant it
But I was dead wrong

You said you'll always be here but now you're gone
Now you're gone, oh you're gone
All gone

The worst part is knowing that you're out there
But you don't think about me
You don't miss me
Like you used to
And I hope that you know
This isn't what I wanted
I just wanted you
The worst part is knowing that you're out there
But you don't want me
You don't need me
Like you used to
I miss the old days
I miss your accent
I miss hearing you talk about your family
