I've been his queen
Since we're sixteen
We want the same things
We dream the same dreams
Alright

I got it all
Cause he is the one
My mom call him love
My dad calls him son
Alright
Alright

I know, I know, I know for sure

Everybody want to steal my boy
Everybody wanna take his heart away
Couple billion in the whole wide world
Find another one cause he belongs to me
Everybody want to steal my boy
Everybody wanna take his heart away
Couple billion in the whole wide world
Find another one cause he belongs to me
Na na na na na na 
Na na na na na na 
Na na na na na na
Na na
He belongs to me

Kisses like cream
His walk is so mean
And everything stops
When he's holding me
Alright
Alright

I don't exist
If I don't have him
The sun doesn't shine
The world doesn't spin
Alright
Alright

But I know, I know I know for sure

Everybody want to steal my boy
Everybody wanna take his heart away
Couple billion in the whole wide world
Find another one cause he belongs to me

Everybody want to steal my boy
Everybody wanna take his heart away
Couple billion in the whole wide world
Find another one cause he belongs to me

That I never let him down before
He knows, he knows
That i'm never gonna let another take his love from me now

Everybody want to steal my boy
Everybody wanna take his heart away
Couple billion in the whole wide world
Find another one cause he belongs to me
