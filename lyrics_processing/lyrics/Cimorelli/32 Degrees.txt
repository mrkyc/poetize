I'm on the edge (On the edge)
You got me thinking way too hard  (Way too hard)
You got me playing all my cards (All my cards)
You know you're tearing me apart

Baby, you're it (Baby, you're it)
It's like you're moving in slow motion (Slow motion)
You know you're getting in my head (in my head)
And I can't pretend

Scale 1-10
Now we're at 11
Stop keeping me guessin'
'Cause I'm holdin' in how I'm really feelin'
But you got me stressin'

Maybe you're way too cool for me
Could someone please turn up the heat?
When you look at me I freeze
32 degrees
32 degrees
Now the temp is heating up
But I'm barely keeping up
When you look at me I freeze
32 degrees
32 degrees

Would you come figure me out?
Be outside my house
Midnight, throwing rocks tryna get me out
Boy, just take me out
Boy, just take me
Boy, just take me
Boy, just take me out

I don't know what you're thinking of me
When you're looking at me, giving me anxiety
And there's just one thing I need
Can you promise me?
Can you promise me, please?

Don't put me in the friend zone
