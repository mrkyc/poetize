It started just like a movie
He was the leading man
I told my friends it was nothing
This was never in my plans

And now he's writing songs about me
Sending letters to me
Stopping by to see my face
I see you in my dreams now
They're telling me to slow down
But we're just picking up the pace

I got you where I want you
There's nothing left now in my way
And lately all I wanna do
Is hear all of the crazy things you say
And now we'll always be together
You and me forever
Never wanna lose you, babe
'Cause you're my superstar now
I'm never gonna let you get away

Days rushing by like a river
Now I'm your woman, you're my man
And we're only getting closer
This was never in my plans
You might also like
And now he's singing songs about me
Hanging with my family
Painting pictures of my face
I see you in my dreams now
You're the one I need now
Baby come and take me away

I got you where I want you
There's nothing left now in my way
And lately all I wanna do
Is hear all the crazy things you say
And now we'll always be together
You and me forever
Never wanna lose you, babe
'Cause you're my superstar now
I'm never gonna let you get away

You're my superstar
You're my superstar
You're my superstar
You're my superstar
You're my superstar
You're my superstar
(yeah!)
I got you where I want you
There's nothing left now in my way
And lately all I wanna do
Is hear all the crazy things you say
And now we'll always be together
You and me forever
Never wanna lose you, babe
'Cause you're my superstar now
I'm never gonna let you get away

You're my superstar
You're my superstar
