And I know I should walk away
But I'll follow you down to the grave
I don't know how many times
I can fall onto your knife
But if I leave you, it kills me just the same
It kills me just the same

Tell me you're happy, but I know that it's not true
I close my eyes 'cause it's just too hard to watch you

Choke on the words you're saying
We both know they have no meaning
Never long before you leave me again

And I know I should walk away
But I'll follow you down to the grave
I don't know how many times
I can fall onto your knife
But if I leave you, it kills me just the same
It kills me just the same

All this can't last because I know this is not you (Know this is not you)
Erase the past but I still know that it haunts you (Know that it haunts you)
You might also like
The wounds you left, yeah, they're still stinging
The lies I tell myself convince me
To stay on this ship that's sinking, yeah

And I know I should walk away
But I'll follow you down to the grave
I don't know how many times
I can fall onto your knife
But if I leave you, it kills me just the same
It kills me just the same

And we go down the same road every time
But I keep on putting this car in drive
And I'm holding onto the edge of your rope
And it's slipping through my fingertips
And I'm losing grip
But I can't let you go

And I know I should walk away (I should walk away)
But I'll follow you down to the grave (You down to the grave)
I don't know how many times (I don't know how many times)
I can fall onto your knife (I can fall onto your knife)
But if I leave you, it kills me just the same (*But if I leave you*)
It kills me just the same (Kills me just the same)
And I know I should walk away (*I should walk away*)
But I'll follow you down to the grave (You down to the grave)
I don't know how many times (Yeah)
I can fall onto your knife (Onto your knife)
But if I leave you, it kills me just the same (*It kills me, it kills me*)
