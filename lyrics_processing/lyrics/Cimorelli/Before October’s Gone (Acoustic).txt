Our phone calls got shorter
And the nights, they got longer
You stopped replying
And I saw you with her
You tell me you miss me
I feel special for a second
But then you turn around and show me
That you didn't mean it

I listen to your voicemail
From last September
And I bet that you don't remember
Leaving it, but it's all I got
My last piece of you

Maybe sometimes things just have to end
Maybe sometimes there's just no explaining it
But you could have let me know
You'd be moving on before October's gone

I heard all the rumors
I didn't want to believe it
You barely mentioned her once
I didn't think anything of it
Sitting there on my driveway
Said you could listen to me all night
Now you're the boy who never meant it
And I'm just the girl 'who took it all the wrong way'
You might also like
Now I'm lost here
It's mid-December
And you made it official with her
I was naive
You never wanted me
Tell me why'd you do this to me?

Maybe sometimes things just have to end
Maybe sometimes there's just no explaining it
But you could have let me know
You'd be moving on before October's gone

On that October night
When I let you go
You didn't even try to make me stay, no
I didn't know that you could be so cold
Like the Minnesota snow

Somehow I always knew we'd end up this way
And I hope you feel
Happy someday
I just wanted you to open up to me
Now that's on the list of things you never did
Maybe sometimes things just have to end
Maybe sometimes there's just no explaining it
But you could've let me know
You'd be moving on, you'd be moving on
