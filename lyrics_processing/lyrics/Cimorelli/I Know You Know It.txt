I know you know just how I turn away
I stutter on my words
Baby you're so intimidating
Don't want my friends to know
Cause I know what they'll say
Maybe your not the best idea but I'm here anyway

Cause this feeling's got me
I don't know how to stop it
I don't know what to do
I put my hands in my pockets
You're something else entirely
And I'm at a loss for words
A loss for words

It's just you and me and this night air
Hoping I look cute I  try to fix my hair
I'm just two feet from the edge
And falling fast
You're the kind of exciting I know
Can't last, can't last
You got me feeling like I'm losing my mind here
And I'm just tryna figure out where I left it
I'm so caught up in this and baby I know it
Baby I know it, you know it
I, I, I know you know it
You might also like
Oh no!

That smile is brutal
Wh-why can't you look away
I know you know I'm lost on every single word you say
You make me want to see you every single day
But I gotta make you think I'm chill so
I'll pretend that I'm busy

You say you're loving all these deep conversations
And I'm losing ground and losing all of my reservations
Yeah boy you make it hard to have any hesitations
I'm pacing heart racing
I'm quickly fading

It's just you and me and this night air
Hoping I look cute I try to fix my hair
I'm just two feet from the edge
And falling fast
You're the kind of exciting I know
Can't last, can't last
You got me feeling like I'm losing my mind here
And I'm just tryna figure out where I left it
I'm so caught up in this and baby I know it
Baby, I know it, you know it
I, I, I know you know it
 
I know you know it, I know you know it

I dance in the middle of the street
You tell me I got way too much energy
But you like to watch even though I can be a lot
Sometimes
Make it so you can't get me out of
Your mind
(Almost no cars on the road
Only trees above us now
Just how caught up in the moment
I am
You are
We are)

It's just you and me and this night air
Hoping I look cute I try to fix my hair
I'm just two feet from the edge
And falling fast
You're the kind of exciting I know
Can't last, can't last
You got me feeling like I'm losing my mind here
And I'm just tryna figure out where I left it
I'm so caught up in this and baby I know it
Baby, I know it, you know it
