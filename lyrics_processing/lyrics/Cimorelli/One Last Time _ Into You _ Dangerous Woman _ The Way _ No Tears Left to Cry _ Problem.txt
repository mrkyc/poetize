Smart money betting on me better off without you
In no time I'll be forgetting all about you
You're saying that you know, but I really, really doubt you
Understand my life is easy when I ain't around you

Iggy, Iggy, to biggie to be here stressing
I'm thinking I love the thought of you more than I love your presence
And the best thing now, probably for you exit
I let you go, let you back
Finally learned my lesson
**Into You**
I'm so into
I can barely breath
And all I wanna do
Is to fall in deep
And close ain't close enough till I make mine
So name a game to play
An we'll roll the dice
**Problem**
Head in the clouds
Got no weight on my shoulders
You might also like
I should be wiser
And realize that I've got
**Dangerous Woman**
You make me feel like a dangerous women
Something 'bout, something 'bout, something 'bout you
Makes me wanna do things that I couldn't
Something 'bout, something 'bout, something 'bout you
**The Way**
I love the way
I love the way
Oooh, I love the way

You give me the kind of something
Want it all the time, need it every day
On a scale of 1 to 10, I'm at 100
Never get enough, I can't stay away

If you want it, I got it, I got it every day
You can get whatever you need from me
Stay by your side (I'll never leave ya)
And I ain't going nowhere cause you're a keeper
So don't you worry, baby you got me
**One Last Time**
I don't deserve it
I know I don't deserve
But stay with me a minute
I swear I'll make it worth it

Can't you forgive me?
At least just temporarily
I know that this is my fault
I should have been more careful

And I know, and I know, and I know, she gives you everything
But boy I couldn't give it to you
And I know, and I know, and I know that you've got everything
But I've got nothing here without you
**The Way**
I love the way
I love the way
Baby, I love the way
Oooh, I love the way
I love the way
I love the way
Said baby, I love the way
Oooh, I love the way
**No Tears Left to Cry**
Right now I'm in a state of mind
I wanna be in like all the time
Ain't got no tears left to cry
So I'm pickin' it up, pickin' it up
I'm lovin', I'm livin', I'm pickin' it up
**One Last Time**
Oh, one last time
I need to be the one that takes you heart (takes your heart)

One more time
I promise after that
I'll let you go

Baby, I don't care if you got her in your heart, babe
All I really care is you'll stay here in my arms
(One last time)
