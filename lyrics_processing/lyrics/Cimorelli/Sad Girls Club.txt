Hey everyone!
Let's go around and introduce ourselves

Uh, hey, I'm Christina

I'm Katherine

I'm Lisa, honestly I don't know why I'm here

I'm Amy, I'm so excited to meet you all
I can't believe we're all from the same -
Oh sorry

I'm Lauren, does love even exist?

And I'm, Dani. Thanks, everybody!
Welcome to the sad girls club

Last night I went to see this boy
Who's been talking to me
I knew it was a bad idea
But I went anyway
'Cause I wanted to see
You might also like
If he liked me
I just wanted to be seen
But I got lost on the way
And it was getting late
And when I got there
All his friends were just like

Who is she?
He doesn't care about me

And as I was driving home
I almost cried but I told myself
My tears are not for

Stupid guys
I try to push it aside

I couldn't hold it in
Now I feel so dumb
And I'm here at
The sad girls club
We all have so many emotions
We're all so lovesick
We don't know what we are doin'
But well all it's ok to cry sometimes
Because the sad girls are the ones
Who feel alive

He has no feelings
He loves when I cry

He says that I'm crazy
But that's mostly a lie

He's completely out of his mind

But I think about him all the time

I love to chase him and he loves to run

He says that he'll text me
But he never does
And I love a challenge
I think that it's fun

But I just want to be in love

We all have so many emotions
We're all so lovesick
We don't know what we are doin'
But we all it's ok to cry sometimes
Because the sad girls are the ones
Who feel alive

Okay everybody
Get out of your seats
Raise your right hand up
And repeat after me

We C-R-Y
We don't keep it inside
We might get it wrong
But at least we tried
We're smart girls, strong girls
One of a kind
We're sad girls, mad girls
We are alive
We get knocked down
But we get back up
Our hearts get broken
But we never give up
The number one rule of the sad girls club
Is to never ever give up on love

We all have so many emotions
We're all so lovesick
We don't know what we are doin'

But we all it's ok to cry sometimes
Because the sad girls are the ones
Who feel alive

We are lost
But we are alive
Beautifully flawed
Dramatic, obsessive
But we always know
That we're doing our best
Even when life's a mess
Get knocked down
Get back up again
We will never ever give up on love
Beautifully flawed
Dramatic, obsessive
But we always know
That we're doing our best
Even when life's a mess
Get knocked down
Get back up again
