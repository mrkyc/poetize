Ooh, Whoa
You know I'm only lonely for you

Like my bedroom door, fall through the floor (oh whoa)
I've been here too many times before (oh whoa)
It's always the same, hang up the phone and I realize, you don't care
I'm just there when you decide you want me
But this time around something broke inside (oh whoa)

"Just one more time", I tell myself
But one more time is not enough

Cause I'm no good at being lonely (ay)
No, I'm no good at being lonely (ay)
Don't wanna say that I need you, but I think that I do
I keep trying, but nothing can distract me from you
Cause I'm no good at being lonely (ay)
And you know I'm only lonely for you

Another night just lying here awake (oh whoa)
No matter what I do it always stays the same (oh whoa)
I'm on the edge, wondering "why do I even try?"
This is ridiculous, you always gotta play it like this
Guess I'll just sit back and watch it die (oh whoa)
You might also like
Just one more try to save this love
But one more try is not enough

Cause I'm no good at being lonely (ay)
No, I'm no good at being lonely (ay)
Don't wanna say that I need you, but I think that I do
I keep trying, but nothing can distract me from you
Cause I'm no good at being lonely (ay)
And you know I'm only lonely for you

In the middle of the night, I'll think about the times
I'll redraw every picture of your life
I'm no good at moving on
I'll miss you every night, I'll write a thousand songs
Cause I'm no good at being lonely
No, I'm no good at being lonely

Cause I'm no good at being lonely
No, I'm no good at being lonely
Don't wanna say that I need you, but I think that I do
I keep trying, but nothing can distract me from you
Cause I'm no good at being lonely
