You are not your makeup, not your clothes
An anonymous face that no one knows
You're not a skin color, a pretty face
The number of inches around your waist
There's so much that you've been through that nobody knows
So many things you never show

You're more than labels
More than pain
Baby, you're more than your mistakes
And you've got something to say
Oh, woah

When will you realize?
Baby, you're worth it
You don't have to do anything to earn it
Baby, you're perfect
You deserve it
When will you see what I see
And realize you're worth it?

You are not a burden, not a waste
You are not a copy, can't be replaced
You're not your pain, you're not your past
Your scars will never hold you back
There's so much that you've been through that nobody knows
So many things you never show
You might also like
You're more than labels
More than pain
Baby, you're more than your mistakes
And you've got something to say
Oh, woah

When will you realize?
Baby, you're worth it
You don't have to do anything to earn it
Baby, you're perfect
You deserve it
When will you see what I see
And realize you're worth it?

You're worth it, baby, you're worth it
You're worth it, baby, you're worth it
You're worth it, baby, you're worth it
You're worth it, baby, you're worth it
You're worth it, baby, you're worth it (Ah, ah-ah-ah)
You're worth it, baby, you're worth it (Ah-ah-ah, oh)
You're worth it, baby, you're worth it
You're worth it
You're more than labels, more than pain
Baby, you're more than your mistakes
And you've got something to say
Oh, woah

When will you realize?
Baby, you're worth it
You don't have to do anything to earn it
Baby, you're perfect
You deserve it
When will you see what I see
And realize you're worth it?

You're worth it, baby, you're worth it
You're worth it, baby, you're worth it
You're worth it, baby, you're worth it
You're worth it, baby, you're worth it
You're worth it, baby, you're worth it
You're worth it, baby, you're worth it
You're worth it, baby, you're worth it
