Why's there just one grocery store in this town?
I was only tryna get some milk
Last thing on my list was to see you around
Kinda awkward cause we never talk but still

When I saw your black Chevy
It hit me
My heart was pounding
Though I hate it
You still get me
When you come around

I fall back
Wish we had it all back
Said I was done with you
But I just can't run from you
Baby now it's all bad
You won't even call back
But every time I catch you looking at me like that
I, I fall back
I, I fall back

It's Friday night at the homecoming game
I didn't even know you came to these
Sittin' on these bleachers and I heard your name
Look to my right and I couldn't believe
You might also like
You're in that brown tee and those jeans
My heart is pounding
Tryna hide it with some other guy
But I miss you and I wish that we could

Fall back
Wish we had it all back
Said I was done with you
But I just can't run from you
Baby now it's all bad
You won't even call back
But every time I catch you looking at me like that
I, I fall back
I, I fall back

Yeah (I, I fall back)

You'll just go and walk away with all your friends
Will you just leave without saying goodbye again?
Wish we had it all back
I wish you would come back
I fall back
Wish we had it all back
Said I was done with you
But I just can't run from you
Baby now it's all bad
You won't even call back
But every time I catch you looking at me like that
I, I fall back
