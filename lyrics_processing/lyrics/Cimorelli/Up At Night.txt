I put on my jeans with
The holes in the front
I'm tryna pick out just the right outfit to get your attention
You in that plaid shirt
Could give me a heart attack
Thinking to myself "This could be trouble" but sometimes I like that
I can see my breath
In this cold night air
You put your hood up, you look so good that you know I can't help but stare...
Yeah, you got a hold on me

I danced across the parking lot
So nervous, but I laughed it off
Now I can't stop looking at my phone
Just wanna see your name!

When I close my eyes, all I see is me right there
In his front seat
His headlights pouring down my street
I try to forget, but I can't lie
His words keep me up at night!
If it's 4:30, and I can't sleep
You don't have to guess
You might also like
What's keeping me up at night
What's keeping me up at night

Sittin' on the tailgate
Head on your shoulder
I love that you drove all the way out here just to get closer
Last night our phone call
Lasted for hours
I was in my bed whispering trying not to wake up my sister
Outside my front door
When you drop me off
Before I go in take a second just to breath in this moment
{sigh}
Reality sets in

Maybe I don't like your shoes
And you might think sometimes I'm rude
Well that's true
But still, you find a way to never let me sleep!

When I close my eyes, all I see is me right there
In his front seat
His headlights pouring down my street
I try to forget, but I can't lie
His words keep me up at night!
If it's 4:30, and I can't sleep
You don't have to guess
What's keeping me up at night
What's keeping me up at night

I couldn't stop
This if I tried
When all the streets whisper your name when I go by
I'm making wishes 'bout you
Heading to my car
Running through the summer rain
Screamin' at the stars

When I close my eyes, all I see is me right there
In his front seat
His headlights pouring down my street
I try to forget, but I can't lie
His words keep me up at night!
If it's 4:30, and I can't sleep
You don't have to guess

What's keeping me up at night
What's keeping me up at night
You're keeping me up at night
You're keeping me up at night
