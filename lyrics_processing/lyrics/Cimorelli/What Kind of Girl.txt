Your friend told me you're cool with being a thing or whatever
But baby you are gonna have to do much better
Cause I'm not like these other girls that you won't remember
I'm not gonna wait here forever

Cause I aim for the bullseye and I don't miss
I blew out the candles and I got my wish
But I, I didn't think you'd turn out like this
You say that you like me, you think I'm so fine
But if you want me you're gonna have to try
Cause I'm getting so bored
(Like what kind of girl do you take me for?)

I've been wanting you since way before this summer
Let's get this straight, I'm not a game, I'm not a number
And if you can't step up, you can't get yourself together
Then you can find yourself a different lover

Cause I aim for the bullseye and I don't miss
I blew out the candles and I got my wish
But I, I didn't think you'd turn out like this
You say that you like me, you think I'm so fine
But if you want me you're gonna have to try
Cause I'm getting so bored
Like what kind of girl do you take me for?

If you want me, show me, love me, know me
Don't just think I'll keep this going
I'm sweet like sugar but I'm cold as ice
I'll be gone like the summertime, you better think twice
If you want me, show me, love me, know me
Don't just think I'll keep this going
I'm sweet like sugar but I'm cold as ice
I'll be gone like the summertime, you better think twice

Oh my gosh, are you serious?

Cause I aim for the bullseye and I don't miss
I blew out the candles and I got my wish
But I, I didn't think you'd turn out like this
You say that you like me, you think I'm so fine
But if you want me you're gonna have to try
Cause I'm getting so bored
