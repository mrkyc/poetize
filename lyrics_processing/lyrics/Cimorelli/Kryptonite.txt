I can do so many things most people are scared but I can't do this
(Right, right)

He doesn't try too hard
It's catching me off guard
He backs into every spot
In the parking lot
He's got the nicest eyes
And I think I'm going blind
Cause he gets me every time
And I just can't let him in
(At least I think)

He makes me want him so bad
I just want to be good
Wanna be good
And now I know we're past the point of no return
No return

I think this guy is my kryptonite
He got inside my mind
He's taking my heart tonight
I think he's hanging me out to dry
I'm tryna put out the fire
But it never felt this right

He's kryptonite
He's kryptonite

My heart is on my sleeve
It makes it hard to breath
I'm falling honestly
This is born into me
Burrow your sister's truck
Just come and pick me up
I love the innocence
In this California love

He makes me want him so bad
That I just want to be good
Wanna be good
And now I know we're past the point of no return
No return

I think this guy is my kryptonite
He got inside my mind
He's taking my heart tonight
I think he's hanging me out to dry
I'm tryna put out the fire
But it never felt this right
He's kryptonite
He's kryptonite

We'll listen to music that I hate
You know I'll miss it when you're not around
And get me in your shotgun seat
'Cause I'm the only one allowed
This is more then I can take
Come on baby come and save me
Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh

I think this guy is my kryptonite
He got inside my mind
He's taking my heart tonight
I think he's hanging me out to dry
Tryna put out the fire
But it never felt this right

He's kryptonite
He's kryptonite
He's kryptonite
