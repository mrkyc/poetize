Wide awake while the world is sound asleepin'
Too afraid of what might show up while you're dreamin'
Nobody, nobody, nobody sees you
Nobody, nobody would believe you
Every day you try to pick up all the pieces
All the memories, they somehow never leave you
Nobody, nobody, nobody sees you
Nobody, nobody would believe you

God only knows what you've been through
God only knows what they say about you
God only knows how it's killing you
But there's a kind of love that God only knows
God only knows what you've been through
God only knows what they say about you
But God only knows the real you
There's a kind of love that God only knows

There's a kind of love that
There's a kind of love
There's a kind of love that
There's a kind of love
You might also like
You keep a cover over every single secret
So afraid if someone saw them, they would leave
But somebody, somebody, somebody sees you
Somebody, somebody will never leave you

God only knows what you've been through
God only knows what they say about you
God only knows how it's killing you
But there's a kind of love that God only knows
God only knows what you've been through
God only knows what they say about you
But God only knows the real you
There's a kind of love that God only knows

There's a kind of love that
There's a kind of love (God only knows)
There's a kind of love that
There's a kind of love

For the lonely, for the ashamed
The misunderstood, and the ones to blame
What if we could start over?
We could start over, we could start over
Oh, for the lonely, for the ashamed
The misunderstood, and the ones to blame
What if we could start over?
We could start over, we could start over
'Cause there's a kind of love that God only knows
God only knows what you've been through
God only knows what they say about you
God only knows the real you
And there's a kind of love that God only knows
God only knows what you've been through
God only knows what they say about you
But God only how it's killing you
There's a kind of love that God only knows

There's a kind of love that
There's a kind of love (God only knows)
There's a kind of love that
There's a kind of love (God only knows)

God only knows where to find you
God only knows how to break through
God only knows the real you
