There's more to you than the fact that you're dark inside
There's more to you than the pain that you're trying to hide
You say you like to party, that's your choice
But there's a lot more you can say with your voice

You think it's all about what it looks like
You want the world to know what you look like
But what your life is, that's what really counts
It's okay if they find out

You're not okay
You've lost your way
You've got bills to pay
You've had a long hard day
You don't feel right
In this pointless fight
So give it up
This is your life

There's more to you than the fact that you think you're tough
There's more to you on the days when you've had enough
I know you wanna push everyone away
But that's only gonna cause you more pain
You might also like
'Cause you don't have to do everything on your own
You've been going through a lot, all alone
You don't have to feel this forever
You've gotta tell them the truth

You're not okay
You've lost your way
You've got bills to pay
You've had a long hard day
You don't feel right
In this pointless fight
So give it up
This is your life

You're beautiful in more ways than you think
Even when your lips aren't a pretty pink
You're special
You matter
People care that you're not okay

You deserve the love you've been searching for
Lying hopeless on your bedroom floor
Open up that beautiful heart
Let the sun at your face
You'll be okay
You'll find your way
These things will change
You'll have your day

You'll be alright
You'll win this fight
Give up the game
Take back your life

You're beautiful in more ways than you think
Even when your lips aren't a pretty pink
You're special
You matter
People care that you're not okay
You deserve the love you've been searching for
Lying hopeless on your bedroom floor
Open up that beautiful heart
