I been on the low
I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine

I don't wanna be alive
I don't wanna be alive
I just wanna die today
I just wanna die

All these other things I'm talkin' 'bout they think they know it
I've been praying for somebody to save me, no one's heroic
And my life don't even matter
I know it I know it I know I'm hurting deep down but can't show it
I never had a place to call my own
I never had a home
Ain't nobody callin' my phone
Where you been? Where you at? What's on your mind?
They say every life precious but nobody care about mine

I been on the low
I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine
You might also like
But I want you to be alive
I want you to be alive
You don't gotta die today
You don't gotta die

It's the very first breath
When your head's been drowning underwater
And it's the lightness in the air
When you're there
Face to face with the lover
It's holding on, though the road's long
And seeing light in the darkest things
And when you stare at your reflection
Finally knowing who it is
I know that you'll thank God you did

I been on the low
I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine

I want you to be alive
I want you to be alive
You ain't gotta die today
You ain't gotta die
Pain don't hurt the same, I know
The road I travel feels alone
But I'm moving 'til my legs give out
And I see my tears melt in the snow
But I don't wanna cry
I don't wanna cry anymore
I wanna feel alive
I don't even wanna die anymore

I been on the low
I been taking my time

I feel like I'm out of my mind

I feel like my life ain't mine

Who can relate?

I want you to be alive
I finally wanna be alive

I don't wanna die anymore
