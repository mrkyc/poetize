I'm just a new kid here
I don't know what I'm doing here
They're going to college next year
But I'll still be here
Says he wants to show me around
I've known him for a few weeks now
But I'm still waiting for us to hang out
For real

And I wouldn't really call them my friends
Go for a run just to clear my head
What did he say
Did he mean what he said
It's all coming back again

This time of night
It feels like
Last summer
What are you doing now
Have you got things figured out
I wonder
Do you think of me
Someone significant
Or just another
Messing with each other's heads
Making and losing friends
Chasing happiness
I was such a mess
You might also like
Last summer
(Oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh)

Now I'm waking up
Feeling like throwing up
And it's all because of him
But still, I go out
Meet them all downtown
Still trying to figure out what to think
She says he wants to see me again
But I think I maybe just wanna be friends
Trying to calm down
Stop freaking out
But with him, It never ends

His fingers interlaced with mine
I think about it all the time
I freaked out when I drove home
Really need to be alone
So scared but I don't want to let him know
Maybe I should really learn how to just stay home
This time of night
It feels like
Last summer

What are you doing now
Have you got things figured out
I wonder (I wonder)

Do you think of me
Someone significant
Or just another

Messing with each other's heads
Making and losing friends
Chasing happiness
I was such a mess

Last summer
Oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh
Last summer
My bare feet, your streets
Sweatin' in the summer heat
Handshake, hearts break
I think I made a big mistake
Your face, your place
Telling me it's okay
Late fights, late nights
Good nights or goodbyes
Sunsets, read texts
What do we do next
Blurred lines, stop signs
First times, pretty eyes
Girls chasing all the guys

This time of night
It feels like
Last summer
This time of night
It feels like
Last summer, oh

Last summer
(Oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh)
Last summer
(Yeah, yeah)
