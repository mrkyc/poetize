It's like your light went out
You keep your head down
You say "Please don't see me
Now, no not this way"
You never wanted this
You just can't seem to catch a break
You say "Please don't see me drown
Now, no not this way"
And you say...

Don't tell me this is just a moment
This will all get better in the end
But you know that this is just not like you
And you were not always this way

Whoever told you that you weren't enough?
Who was it that made you feel small?
I wished I could go back and rewind it all
Replace it with the words that are true
You have more than enough in you
You have more then enough, it's true
You might also like
You've lost your faith in you
Don't wanna see this through
You looked to other people
For what you should do
And you don't want to hear it
But I know that this will make you stronger
You think you can't make it any longer
But that's not the truth

When you look you'll only see your flaws
You forget all the things that make you strong
But you never will be too far gone
You're never a lost cause, no you're not

Whoever told you that you weren't enough?
Who was it that made you feel small?
I wished I could go back and rewind it all
Replace it with the words that are true
You have more than enough in you
You have more then enough, it's true
You're not broken
You're not wrong
And even when you start to fall
You will rise and carry on

You're not broken
You're not wrong
You are standing
You are strong
And even when you start to fall
You will rise and carry on

You are strong

Don't let them tell you that you're not enough
Never let them make you feel small

I know that we can't go back and rewind it all
So let's replace it with the words that are true
You have more than enough in you
You have more then enough, it's true
There is nothing that you have to prove
