He is love, he is a light
He is the sounds, and thoughts, and words that keep you up at night
He is warmth, but it makes you shiver
He is beauty, he is kind, he is a giver
He is magic in the dark, he is the ticking time
He is energy in the stars, truth and a white lie
He broke down my walls with the light in his eyes
And brick by brick he took over my mind
I fell for him fast and unknowingly
He is the kind of earthquake that you don't see
I thought I was safe cause there was no evidence of destruction
But, before I knew it, I was in it, I loved him
The heat of the summer, the moon in the sky
Nothing could compare to the look in his eyes
Corn fields, truck beds, parking lot lights
The connection was instant, everything was right
But seasons change, leaves turn brown
Lakes dry up, what goes up comes down
I don't know what changed, or why he fell out of love
But I've come to realize, it's simply what he does
He loves, and he loves, and he loves
Then he runs, and he runs, and he runs
He won't stay, even if he wants to
His demons are stronger than the feelings that he has for you
Nobody leaves him because he does it first
He breaks his own heart, and loves you less than he loves to hurt
If I could speak to the one he has now
I would tell her to prepare for the rain that will come down
You might also likeHe will tear you up, and pour gasoline on the shreds
You will feel insane, you won't get him out of your head
His jacket, his face, his words won't leave your memory
He won't care when you face him saying, "Look what you've done to me"
Remember these words next time your hand is in his
Because you will become another casualty on the list
You can try to get out, but you're already in
