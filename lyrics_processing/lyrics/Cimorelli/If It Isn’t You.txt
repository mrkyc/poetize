I am reckless
With my heart
With my words
I never really cared about
The ones who didn't stick around
Yeah, I cry about it
I get attached
I feel so dumb
But I did it to myself
Always knew that they would let me down

But ever since you left, baby
I've been a mess
The stars in the sky don't shine as brightly
So tell me would it be so bad if you came back
Don't you remember how right it feels
'Cause I do
And if you asked me to

I'd come back to you
Back to you
I'd come back to you
To you
You know it's only you
Only you
I don't want nobody
If it isn't you
If it isn't you
If it isn't you
You might also like
Do you think about me
Do you miss the nights
When we would hang out
And just drive around
Do you think about it now
I ask all my friends about you
And it hurts a little
When they say you're happy
'Cause a part of me, it still wishes
You smile because of me

It's been a long time
I've written so many songs
And I bet all my friends
Are tired of hearing your name
I sound a little insane
But it's hard to move on
When there's nobody like you
You're so special
And I don't wanna spend another day without you

Baby it doesn't matter
Where this takes me
It could hurt me
But I miss you
And I need you
I don't want to
But everybody knows
That if you asked me to
Yeah if you asked me to

I'd come back to you
Back to you
I'd come back to you
To you
You know it's only you
Only you
I don't want nobody
If it isn't you
If it isn't you
If it isn't you

I don't know what it is
I know he's not that special
I mean, at least everyone
Keeps telling me that
But it feels like I'm never going to move on
Like, for real, I'm so obsessed with him
Like, Justin Bieber could ask me on a date
And I'd be like
"No, sorry, you're not J.."
Oops, I almost said his name!
Anyway, the moral of the story is
It's over, he probably hates me
And I should just move on
Right?
I'd come back to you
Back to you
I'd come back to you
To you
'Cause it's only you
Only you
I don't want nobody
If it isn't you
If it isn't you
If it isn't you

If it isn't you
If it isn't you
If it isn't you

If it isn't you
If it isn't you
If it isn't you
