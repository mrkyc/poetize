Girls like me
Girls like me

I just wanna see you around
But you don't live in this small town
I remember the night we met
No one had looked at me like that
You walked through the door and I knew you were special
Maybe you'll be the one I was looking for

Now I'll start to call because I'm feeling desperate
You won't answer and I'll leave no message
I'll wear my crown as the queen of ambiguity
Cause you know I never say what I mean

So don't you dare tell me I'm incredible
When I know that my phone ain't gonna ring
And don't you dare tell me that I'm special
When you know that you don't wanna be with me
Cause guys like you
Like girls like her
And girls like me
We don't get guys like you
No, I don't get you
You might also like
Now I'll sit in my car all alone
I wish you were there in my front seat
I'll try not to stare at my phone
Man, I really wish I had somewhere to be
Why am I always there when you're not there for me
I really need to learn how to let people go

And I'll run away but I'll come running back
I'll say I'm done but you know that I don't mean it
You'll start to see her and I'll wonder why
She gets to be the one that's on your mind

So don't you dare tell me I'm incredible
When I know that my phone ain't gonna ring
And don't you dare tell me that I'm special
When you know that you don't wanna be with me
Cause guys like you
Like girls like her
And girls like me
We don't get guys like you
No, I don't get you
I'll try to listen to sad songs
But I'll just feel insane
'Cause I know that we were never that deep anyway
Now you're more distant than the stars
I just wanna be where you are
They say you can't lose something you never had
I guess that you were never mine

So don't you dare tell me that I'm incredible
When I know that my phone ain't gonna ring
And don't you dare tell me I'm special
When you know that you don't wanna be with me
And girls like me
Want guys like you
And maybe girls like me
Don't need guys like you
