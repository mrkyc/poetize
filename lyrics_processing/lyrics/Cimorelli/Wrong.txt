I wait before I call you
I don't text back right away
I try to look like I have got a life
I make sure I look perfect
I make sure that you see
I'm just trying to be something you like
I don't always want to smile
I don't always want to pout
I'd love someone to come figure me out

But I sit here by the sidelines
And they always turn me down
So I change myself and go another round

I'm just trying to be something that makes you happy
I'm just trying to be something you want
I just want to feel your eyes looking at me
I'm just tired of always being wrong
Ooooh, oooh

I rearrange my schedule
I make sure that I'm free
If I don't try, we'll never hang out
I'm sure there are people who would like to catch me
But I'm too busy chasing to turn around
You might also likeI know I can't be perfect
But one day I'll be close
And that's when someone will love me the most

So I'll just keep on trying
I'll do the best I can
I can't compete just being who I am

I'm just trying to be something that makes you happy
I'm just trying to be something you want
I just want to feel your eyes looking at me
I'm just tired of always being wrong
Ooooh, oooh

I try so hard
I change so much
I put on a mask
I hide all of my feelings so well
I put on a mask
I hide all of my feelings so well
But every time they fall for it, it's all just a lie
'Cause I know that I'm not being myself
I'm just trying to be something that makes you happy
I'm just trying to be something you want
I just want to feel your eyes looking at me
I'm just tired of always being wrong
Ooooh, oooh, oooh
