Blue, the color of your eyes and all I see
When I look up at the skies
I think of you
Driving me in your car
It's been so long
It's been so long

You said "don't wait up for me baby"
But you know I'll wait forever
Nobody else makes me crazy
You know there's no one better

Baby, I adore you
Like the sand loves the sea
Cause compared to everyone before you
They're the stars but you're the galaxy
Baby, you're my galaxy

Cold, the air that first night we snuck out and saw
Those constellations
Beautiful as you
I didn't think I'd fall so hard so fast
I thought it wouldn't last
You might also likeSo tell me do you think of me
When it's late at night and you can't sleep
Do you know it gives me anxiety
When you're gone it feels like I can't breathe

You said "don't wait up for me baby"
But you know I'll wait forever
Nobody else makes me crazy
You know there's no one better

Baby, I adore you
Like the sand loves the sea
Cause compared to everyone before you
They're the stars but you're the galaxy
Baby, you're my galaxy

I know there are billions of stars in the universe
And those stars make galaxies
So much bigger than us
The past is gone and the days are long
And you and I won't last
And I should face the fact
That you're just a boy and I'm just a girl
But somehow you became my whole world
So don't wait up for me baby
You don't have to wait forever
I'm yours, I know that I'm crazy
But I know there's no one better

Baby, I adore you
Like the sand loves the sea
'Cause compared to everyone before you
They're the stars but you're the galaxy
Ooooh
Baby, you're my galaxy
Ooooh
Baby, you're my galaxy
