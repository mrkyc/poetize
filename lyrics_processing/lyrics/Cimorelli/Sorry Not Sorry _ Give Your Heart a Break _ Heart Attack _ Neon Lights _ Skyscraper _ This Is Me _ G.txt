Don't wanna break your heart
Wanna give your heart a break
I know you're scared it's wrong
Like you might make a mistake

There's just one life to live
And there's no time to wait, to wait
So let me give your heart a break
**Get Back**
Don't walk away like you always do this time
Baby, you're the only thing that's been on my mind

Ever since you left, I've been a mess
You won't answer your phone
I'll say it once, then I'll leave you alone
But I gotta let you know
**Heart Attack**
You make me glow
But I cover up, won't let it show
You might also like
So I'm putting my defenses up
'Cause I don't wanna fall in love
If I ever did that, I think I'd have a heart attack
**Neon Lights**
Be still, my heart, 'cause it's freakin' out
It's freakin' out right now
Shining like stars 'cause we're beautiful
We're beautiful, right now
**Sorry Not Sorry**
Now payback is a bad chick

And baby, I'm the baddest

You're messin' with a savage

Can't have this
Can't have this, ohhh
And it'd be nice of me to take it easy on ya
But nah

Baby, I'm sorry

I'm not sorry

Baby, I'm sorry

I'm not sorry

Being so bad got me feelin' so good
Showing you up like I knew that I would

Baby, I'm sorry

I'm not sorry
Baby, I'm sorry

I'm not sorry

Feelin' inspired cause the tables have turned
Yeah, I'm on fire and I know that it burns
**Get Back**
I wanna get back to old days
When my phone would ring and I knew it was you

Don't wanna talk back and get yelled
Fight for nothing, like we used to

Oh, kiss me like you mean it, like you miss me
'Cause I know that you do

I wanna get back, get back

I wanna get back, get back

I wanna get back, get back

I wanna get back

I wanna get back

I wanna get back

Ooohhh
What? I wanted a note
**Give Your Heart A Break**
Don't wanna break your heart
Wanna give your heart a break
I know you're scared it's wrong
Like you might make a mistake

There's just one life to live
And there's no time to wait, to wait
So let me give your heart a break
**Neon Lights**
Baby, when they look up at the sky
We'll be shootin' stars just passing by
You'll be goin' home with me tonight
And we'll be burnin' up like neon lights

Like neon lights, yeah
**This is Me**
You're the voice I hear inside my head
The reason that I'm singing
I need to find, I gotta find you

This is real, this is me
I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be now
Gonna let the light shine on me

Now I've found who I am
There's no way to hold it in
No more hiding who I wanna be
This is me
This is me
**Skyscraper**
Go on and try to tear me down
I will be rising from the ground

Like a skyscraper

Like a skyscraper

Like a skyscraper
Like a skyscraper
