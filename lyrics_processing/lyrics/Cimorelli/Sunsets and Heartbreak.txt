The streetlights were gold
You were standing by my car
I jumped and you caught me
I'm hanging on your every word
And I can barely breathe
And your so tall when I'm next to you
I look up at you and try to hide a smile
You walk me to my door
I pictured this a million times before

I'm sitting on these stairs
Staring at the wall
The light shining
But I can't see at all
Just tryna connect things in my mind
Wish I could have this my way
But I know you can't stay

You stand there in my driveway
You're a red light on a highway
And I'm drowning in the sound of your name
Between late nights and mistakes
I can't stand in this earthquake
I look up at the sky, the lights starting to fade
Here comes sunsets and heartbreak
You might also like
I'm going down
I'm going down
I'm going down
Sunsets and heartbreak

Sitting in my car today
It's like nothing even happened yesterday
If you were here right next to me
I swear I could replay it all day long
When I sing that song
Looked over at you
Saw your smile
And I was gone
This little town is magic
It's making me feel things
I never thought I would
My name's in your phone every night
You tell me 'bout your sister and your family
Gave myself away, now you know I'm in love with your laugh
Cause I can't even hold it back

Wish we could just stay here
But I know it's not real
You stand there in my driveway
You're a red light on a highway
And I'm drowning in the sound of your name
Between late nights and mistakes
I can't stand in this earthquake
I look up at the sky, the lights starting to fade
Here comes sunsets and heartbreak

I'm going down
I'm going down
I'm going down

I don't wanna say goodbye
I don't wanna say goodbye
I don't wanna say goodbye
Maybe if I close my eyes
Maybe if I hold real tight
I won't have to say goodbye
Goodbye

You stand there in my driveway
You're a red light on a highway
Between late nights and mistakes
I can't stand in this earthquake
I look up at the sky, the lights starting to fade
Here come sunsets and heartbreak
Sunsets and heartbreak
Late nights and mistakes
Sunsets and heartbreak
