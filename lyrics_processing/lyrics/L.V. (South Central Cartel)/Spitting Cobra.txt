Here's my BBM Pin, Tell me what's happening
She's like "I'm on WhatsApp...
What's up? What's happening?"
We goin' dancing, that's what's happenin'
Pick her up in Sandton
In a last taxi
Then she started acting
Looking like an Ice Cream
Spazzin', We laughing
Sniping, Touching
Backseat something
Nothing in traffic
On our own island
Iris to iris
Type of skin is crisp
Fuck, high risk
Told her I'm a Leo
She said she was a lioness
Jokes, Ha!

Nah
A libra
Whatever
I kept her
Then I got over

I told her it was kosher
As soon as she got over

Linger in tropic
Met up with a cobra
