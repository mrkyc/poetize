On your doorstep
I open the door
You haven't been home yet
Walk in the hallway it feels like its lonely
Its feels like its holding on to something ugly
Where is your stuff
And where is your car
I know you never stay away this long
We're in the city
But where is your heart
Cause I've been searching for a while and I think we've grown apart
Tell me all the things that you heard about me
Tell me all the things that you wanna know
Tell me all the things know that you know about me
And tell me all that feelings that you never show
If I let my heart out to you boy
Will you tell you friends that you're not alone
Or are you gonna leave after the first story
If that's the case you can just get up and go
You might also likeI've never really meant what I said I mean
I meant a little bit
But I didn't mean to scare you away I'm sorry
But you're not like anybody
No you're not like anybody

No you're not like anybody I've ever met
Where are you
Where are we
Can you handle the fire
Or are you gonna give up on your knees

Why did you leave
Why did you go
Was it too much was  it too fast
For me to show

Tell me all the things that you heard about me
Tell me all the things that you wanna know
Tell me all the things that you know about me
And tell me all that feelings that you never show
If I let my heart out to you boy
Will you tell you friends that you're not alone
Or are you gonna leave after the first story
If that's the case you can just get up and go
I've never really meant what I said I mean
I meant a little bit
But I didn't mean to scare you away I'm sorry
But you're not like anybody
No you're not like anybody
No you're not like anybody I've ever met

Close the blinds
Close the windows
And close your mind
Wherever you are
How close and how and how far
I'm sorry I fucked up
My truth is so raw
There's so much you need to know
But its not fair
To ball it up inside
And never ever share
You were never here
Your not like anybody
I thought you would listen
But your just like everybody
Your just like everybody
