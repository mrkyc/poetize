Guess no one thought to tell me you were back in town again
Everyone remembers how you shut me down
And let me tell you jaws were dropping
Left and right when we walked out
Its so good to see you now
Its as though you were never gone
Even after all this time
And I want you more than ever
And I know you can never be mine
You dont have to stay forever
You dont have to stay forever
You dont have to stay forever
Maybe you could stay tonight
Arm in arm out strolling down on Riverside
Two broken hearts beating fast and right in time
I got nothing to loose I might as well lay it on the line
And I dont want to be alone so won't you stay with me tonight
Its so good to see you now
Its as though you were never gone
Even after all this time
And I want you more than ever
And I know you can never be mine
But you dont have to stay forever
You dont have to stay forever
You dont have to stay forever
You dont have to stay forever
Maybe you could stay tonight

Feels so right just to be with you again
Im still not over the first time you let me go
But I dont hold that against you
And I wanted you to know
Its so good to see you now
Its as though you were never gone
Even after all this time
And I want you more than ever
And I know you can never be mine
You dont have to stay forever
You dont have to stay forever
You dont have to stay forever
