I put the rubber on the road
I left it all behind
And now paved with memories
And those streets are long since gone
Rubber on the road and the blood inside
And I've been around this land of opportunity
The road is hard and it don't offer up immunity
I've rode this country hard, from sea to shining sea
I've shared a dance with Lady Liberty
I broke down despite my prayers
Full tilt and half the way
The rubber on the road and the blood inside
But I ain't got far to go
I'll leave her where she lay
Keep the rubber on the road and the blood inside
'Cause wealth of matter has never made much sense to me
And It's bought a lot of souls and never has it set one free
I shed a couple tears but never did I grieve
I walked away and left the keys
And I'll catch me the midnight ghost
We'll roll down that western coast
Fields of green, valleys of wine
Saint Theresa, don't you worry
We'll make it on time

Just watch this Grey Ghost go
Steel on the tracks and the hammer down
Things used to move so slow
These days it's roll, man, roll
Steel on the tracks and the hammer down
And it's bound to take its toll out runnin' wild and livin' free
And I've done some growing up but I never lost the child in me
We're tossin' dice at things that might not ever be
All just to see what I can see, yeah
And I'll catch me the midnight ghost
We'll roll down that western coast
Fields of green, valleys of wine
Saint Theresa, don't you worry
We'll make it on time
Well, I know that it can't last
Someday this ride will stall
Rubber on the road and the blood inside
'Cause even mighty mountains
Someday might crumble and fall
Keep the rubber on the road and the blood inside
Finding out the hard way don't leave school with much validity
And livin' hand to mouth don't leave room for much nobility
We know the end is near but not when it will be
Or is it close enough to see? Yeah
And I'll catch me the midnight ghost
We'll roll down that western coast
Fields of green, carmel wine
Saint Theresa, don't you worry
Saint Theresa, don't you worry
Saint Theresa, don't you worry
