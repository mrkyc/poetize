Well, says Red Molly to James, "That's a fine motorbike
And a girl could feel special on any such like"
Says James to Red Molly, "My hat's off to you
That's a Vincent Black Lightning, 1952
And I've seen you at the corners and cafes it seems
Red hair and black leather, my favorite color scheme"
And he pulled her on behind and down to the Box Hill they did ride

Says James to Red Molly, "Here's a ring for your right hand
But I tell you in earnest I'm a dangerous man
For I've fought with the law since I was seventeen
And I robbed many a man to get my Vincent machine
Now I'm twenty-one, I might not make twenty-two
But I don't mind dying, but for the love of you
And if fate should break my stride
Then I'll give you my Vincent to ride"

"Come down, come down, Red Molly," called Sergeant McRae
"For they've taken young James Adie for armed robbery
Shotgun blast hit his chest, left nothing inside
Oh, come down, Red Molly to his dying bedside"
She came to the hospital, there wasn't much left
He was running out of road, he was running out of breath
But he smiled to see her cry
He said, "I'll give you my Vincent to ride"

Well, says young James, "In my opinion, there is nothing in this world
Beats a '52 Vincent and a red-headed girl
Oh, now Nortons and Indians and Greeveses won't do
Well, they don't have a soul like a Vincent '52"
Well, he reached for her hand and he slipped her the keys
Said, "I got no further use for these
I see angels on Ariels in leathers and chrome
Swooping down from heaven to carry me home"
And he gave her one last kiss and died
