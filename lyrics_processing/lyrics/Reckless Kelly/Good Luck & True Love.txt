She was striking like a Viking in the night
Held herself together in the heat of the fight
Took me prisoner, captive till the morning light
When I woke she was nowhere in sight
But it's not good luck (I don't believe in good luck)
And I ain't no miracle
And it's not true love (I don't believe in true love)
Maybe it was just my time
Maybe she was sent from up above
Maybe it was just one night of good luck and true love
Good luck and true love
She was smoking like the barrel of a well-known gun
Any he hope that she could hit him dead, red on the run
Had 'em on the edge of their seats every night
Now I'm the only cowboy locked in her sight
But it's not good luck (I don't believe in good luck)
And I ain't no miracle
And it's not true love (I don't believe in true love)
Maybe it was just my time
Maybe she was sent from up above
Maybe it was just one night of good luck and true love
Good luck and true love

Trying to comment, there was no time to react
Broke her flyin', I was quick and skilled with the blade
Train whistle blowing as I pulled her away
But it's not good luck (I don't believe in good luck)
And I ain't no miracle
And it's not true love (I don't believe in true love)
Maybe it was just my time
Maybe she was sent from up above
Maybe it was just one night of good luck and true love
Good luck and true love
Good luck and true love
