So why do I call when it's five in the morning?
I swear that we've already been through enough

You laid it all out before the coffee got cold
I gave you the world, I guess you needed more
I turn to the bottle like I always do
Hate being sober on my own yeah without you

'Cause you know if we were a story
Yeah we'd be a short one
And you know if we were a movie
Yeah we'd be a sad one
'Cause I'm in my head
I'm overthinking it all
Every word you said
But it's over

So why do I call when it's five in the morning?
I swear that we've already been through enough
I'm chasing the past and it stops me from falling
Into a love that I've already lost

You might also like
Missing the late nights and driving you home
But you know I'm no good at letting go
Cross your heart, then you changed your mind
You're still that feeling I can't leave behind

'Cause you know if we were a story
Yeah we'd be a short one
And you know if we were a movie
Yeah we'd be a sad one

I'm overthinking it all
