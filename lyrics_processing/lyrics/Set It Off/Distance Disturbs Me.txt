I wish I never saw your face
Then I wouldn't need a place to frame you in my mind
Hanging on the wall, my memories and all, but you're not tangible
Stuck on sentimental, the history we never had
Almost accidental, the way you live inside my head

I would kill to be a mile away
Or feel the breath you'll take
But fate won't let me

Distance disturbs me
Now I wish we never met
I wish I could forget who you are
Distance disturbs me
Cause we just can't connect
I found my one regret and it was you
Distance disturbs me

Separated by a screen
It's just a bitter sweet success with a dash of failure
I'm hanging by a thread, intentions cut to shreds
I'm starting to lose my grip
So someone please distract me, I need a new obsession
Am I just going crazy?
I'll never learn my lesson because

I would kill to be a mile away

Distance disturbs me
Now I wish we never met
I wish I could forget who you are
Distance disturbs me
Cause we just can't connect
I found my one regret and it was you
Distance disturbs me

Throw it all away for just one rainy day
Throw it all away for just one rainy day with you
With you

I would kill to be a mile away
Or feel the breath you'll take
But fate won't let me

Distance disturbs me
Now I wish we never met
I wish I could forget who you are, who you are
Distance disturbs me
Cause we just can't connect (We just can't connect)
I found my one regret and it was you
I found my one regret and it was you
