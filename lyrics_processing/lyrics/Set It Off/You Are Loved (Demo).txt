I never felt so broken-down
Never felt so alone until I hit the ground
We all have our ups, our downs
Our stories that we hold that go untold
And so we just lay down, knocked out
Waiting for the cure
You're not alone

When you look down, does it seem so far away?
Are the names so hard to take? Great escape
We are not so different, I can tell
'Cause I've stood right where you're standing
Bruised, battered, beaten, broken-down
Wore the frown
But I'm here to tell you that you are loved
You are loved
That you are loved
You are loved

Happiness can seem to be so distant
While tissues fill the trash
People put you down, but they're not worth it
Don't be deceived again
They play with feelings like they're meaningless to you
Check my pulse, now let us review

When you look down, does it seem so far away?
Are the names so hard to take? Great escape
We are not so different, I can tell
'Cause I've stood right where you're standing
Bruised, battered, beaten, broken-down
Wore the frown
But I'm here to tell you that you are loved
You are loved
That you are loved
You are loved

It's a permanent solution to a temporary problem
We all have issues not knowing how to solve them
And when you feel you're at your worst
Remember all these words

When you look down, does it seem so far away?
Are the names so hard to take? Great escape
We are not so different, I can tell
'Cause I've stood right where you're standing
Bruised, battered, beaten, broken-down
Wore the frown
But I'm here to tell you that you are loved
You are loved
That you are loved
You are loved
