"Come on in, boy," said the skeletons sitting by her closet door
Dirty secrets, empty memories, and broken hearts across the floor
I was knocked out, heels over head
So you dragged me by my feet to a ghost town, where you buried me
No wonder no one heard my screams
Love's so alive, but it died in its sleep
And now that it's dead, I live in your head and I will haunt your fucking dreams

No one will love you like I did, will treat you like I did
So go on, wear that scarlet letter
No one will love you like I did, will touch you like I did
So good luck finding something better

Run away, boy, if you couldn't tell, baby's got a thirst for blood
A subtle system, wicked melodies, craving bullets from her gun
So entranced they, follow every word, little spirals in their eyes
Catch a lover, turn an enemy just to watch them burn alive

No one will love you like I did, will treat you like I did
So go on, wear that scarlet letter
No one will love you like I did, will touch you like I did
So good luck finding something better

Someday you may find that picture perfect guy
And I'll chase my words with poison
Until that day arrives, and swine take to the sky
Fill your void with open thighs so

No one will love you like I did, will treat you like I did
So go on, wear that scarlet letter
No one will love you like I did, will touch you like I did
So good luck finding something better
No one will love you like I did, will treat you like I did
So go on, wear that scarlet letter
No one will love you like I did, will fuck you like I did
