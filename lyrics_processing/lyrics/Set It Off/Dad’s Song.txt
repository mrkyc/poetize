Do you believe in happy endings?
Or the mendings of human hearts?
Oh I believe in both, I'm certain
Because these curtains are state of the art
If you'd occasionally happen to spy on me
You'd think I'm having one sided conversations
But I hear him talking back
You'd think I may even lack some sanity
But maybe I can't let go
And so I'll say

I finally wrote your song at last
Sorry that this one came out so sad
Every tear I had was shed for the man
That gave me a better sense of life and meaning
To motivate, there's no short-cuts to success
I'll wait for his guiding hands
My guardian angel until the very end

I see a cold seat on the couch where I remember
That just four years ago around December
You sat me down and held me next to you, so close
How I long for things to be restored
To back when times weren't quite this hard
In the car that song you sang to me
Never rang so loud before

Oh, what I'd give for just another hug from you
You may be gone, but love will never die
And so I'll say

I finally wrote your song at last
Sorry that this one came out so sad
Every tear I had was shed for the man
That gave me a better sense of life and meaning
To motivate, there's no short-cuts to success
I'll wait for his guiding hands
My guardian angel until the very end

Tears can't run dry when I start to cry
When I hear people speak of how you'd be so proud of me
And how I hope this song will reach your ears
I battled all my darkest fears
I once was blind, but now it's clear
Wherever I go I know that you'll be near

I finally wrote your song at last
Sorry that this one came out so sad
Any tear I had was shed for the man
That gave me a better sense of life and meaning
To motivate, there's no short-cuts to success
I'll wait for his guiding hands
My guardian angel until the very end
Until the very end
