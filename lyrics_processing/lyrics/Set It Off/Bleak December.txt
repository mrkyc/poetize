Give me, give me, give me the truth now
I promise I can handle it if you can
Cause you've been running from yourself for way too long
So give me any reason not to cut you out
You're far too gone, yeah
Watch you pretend, you know it all
Shift any blame aside
Vending the victim when it sells
How do you even sleep at night?
As I drive and drive

In that bleak December, you're just too cold
But I need the answer, before you'd fold
You would hold your cards inside your chest
I think I drove too far for that bleak December
And how full of shit you are, how full of shit you are

I really, really, really wanna know you
And not all the fifty fucking personalities inside your skull
If you'd stop trying to steal the spotlight and steal the show
Then maybe you would have a better chance at not dying alone
So I hit the road

In that bleak December, you're just too cold
But I need the answer, before you'd fold
You would hold your cards inside your chest
I think I drove too far for that bleak December
And how full of shit you are

Now what are you to me
But a fly inside a web of lies you weave
You're not fooling anyone, not you, not me
So I wonder how you stay alive
When all I do is freeze

In that bleak December, you're just too cold
But I need the answer, before you'd fold
You would hold your cards inside your chest
I think I drove too far for that bleak December
In that bleak December, you're just too cold
But I need the answer, before you'd fold
You would hold your cards inside your chest
I think I drove too far for that bleak December
