Fresh out the box, shiny and new
Played it so much 'til it went out of tune
I tightened the peg 'til the tension erupts
Didn't think that I could give up
The record I spun when I was young
Spoke to my heart and fit just like a glove
But now that it's played out, the needle is worn
Didn't think that I could give up

What changed? What changed?
It's more than just our age
Or how the music tastes and I'm askin'
What changed? What changed?

'Cause now we're singing different songs
Forgetting how to sing along together
When every note comes out so wrong
It keeps on getting harder to remember
The melodies or what the lyrics mean
'Cause now we're singing different songs
Forgetting how to sing along together

We once called it love, devolved into lust
Jealousy speaks out to silence the trust
We temper our words 'cause we're scared of the truth
Humming tunes that we can't get through
When I hear your voice, I hear someone else
The stress on my heart's getting bad for my health
So should we admit that we've both had enough?
Didn't think that we could give up

It's more than just our age
Or how the music tastes and I'm askin'

'Cause now we're singing different songs
Forgetting how to sing along together
When every note comes out so wrong
It keeps on getting harder to remember
The melodies or what the lyrics mean
'Cause now we're singing different songs
Forgetting how to sing along together

Oh, oh-oh-oh (Oh, oh-oh-oh)
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh (Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
Oh, oh-oh-oh (Oh, oh-oh-oh)
Can't sing along together

Face to face, so far apart
We're worlds away from what we were before
Before, before we started singing
Different songs (Singing different songs)
Forgetting how to sing along together
When every note comes out so wrong
It keeps on getting harder to remember
The melodies or what the lyrics mean
'Cause now we're singing different songs
Forgetting how to sing along together, no, no

Oh, oh-oh-oh (Oh, oh-oh-oh)
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh (Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
Oh, oh-oh-oh (Oh, oh-oh-oh)
