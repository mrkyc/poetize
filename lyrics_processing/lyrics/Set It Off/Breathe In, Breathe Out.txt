(Breathe in, breathe out)
(Breathe in, breathe out)

Board up your windows but I'm telling you
That it's not gonna do a thing
It always finds you, but it all depends
On how you battle with the pressure
You take a left and it's standing in the way
You try to shake it off, but it seems to wanna stay
Your poker face could make them melt
Just sit back and deal with the hand you're dealt

Face facts, it won't be easy this time
Sticks like a tack in the back of my mind
Hurts so deep when I think too much
And breathing gets harder

Take a look at me
From one side I seem to be
So calm, so cool, collected
And on the other side, I'm melting down

Stop and think about it, you only have one life
So why mistake it, as something negative?
I am my own worst enemy
Paranoid, can't avoid this killing spree
I am a victim, but I choose to be
My favorite weapon, lies behind my teeth
I strive to solve myself
So chin up and deal with the hand you're dealt

Face facts, it won't be easy this time
Sticks like a tack in the back of my mind
Hurts so deep when I think too much
And breathing gets harder

Take a look at me
From one side I seem to be
So calm, so cool, collected
And on the other side I'm melting down
Until then, I will choose to display
All these feelings that I hate
You think you know me but you don't
So look who's laughing now
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls
Lend me your eyes and ears
I have something to tell you
Please listen up, right now

Don't you dare close it off, I can never get enough
When they close cold eyes, is when I will give it up
Don't you dare close it off, I can never get enough (woah)
Don't you dare close it off, I can never get enough
When they close cold eyes, is when I will give it up
Don't you dare close it off, I can never get enough, get enough

Take a look at me
From one side I seem to be
So calm, so cool, collected
And on the other side I'm melting down
Until then, I will choose to display
All these feelings that I hate
You think you know me but you don't
Take a look at me
From one side I seem to be
So calm, so cool, collected
And on the other side I'm melting down
Until then, I will choose to display
All these feelings that I hate
You think you know me but you don't
