So, here I stare
At an empty bottle full of confidence
Fuzzy faded with the poison in my hand
It's an empty flask philosophy
I can't help it, I can't stop
Dead, I'm a zombie with no notion of regret
Grab a bucket and a mop cause I'm a mess
Full of sexual ferocity
I can't help it, I can't stop it

I'm living fast until I'm dead
And it's in my head singing

I'm on a permanent vacation
We're young, we're young
We're dumb and we don't care, no
And I don't owe an explanation
We're young, we're young
We're dumb and we don't care, no

Forever stuck in our youth
Forever stuck in our youth
See Set It Off LiveGet tickets as low as $36You might also like
My liver hates my guts
Because I'm stuck living in a daze
Bottom shelf tequila coursing through my veins
Giddy, greedy, grin upon my face
I can't help it, I can't stop
And so I drank
My cells away until I'm in one and I think
About how no one would believe it so I sing
A song about my rowdy rebel ways
I can't help it, I can't stop

We're young, we're dumb, and having fun
We're young, we're dumb, just turn it up
We're young, we're dumb, and having fun
Don't make me tell you twice

Because I'm on a permanent vacation
We're young, we're young
We're dumb and we don't care, no
And I don't owe an explanation
We're young, we're young
We're dumb and we don't care, no
Forever stuck in our youth
Forever stuck in our youth
I do what I do, what I do and now
We're young, we're dumb
And having fun, we're young
We're dumb just turn it up
We're young, we're dumb and having fun
And we'll be forever stuck in youth
Forever stuck in our youth

I'm on a permanent vacation
We're young, we're young
We're dumb and we don't care, no
And I don't owe an explanation
We're young, we're young
We're dumb and we don't care

Forever stuck in our youth
