When pretending lends a helping hand
We hold it close, so close, and never let it go
Then the pen begins to write a story
With an end that bends right out of our control

How did we get so jaded? I don't know
Was it the white lies feeding our egos?
I never valued minutes I burned through
Is that just how it goes?
Seconds I wasted, I was fixated
You're devastated, sorry to say
I can't fix it, is this where I give in?

I'm falling through the hourglass
And I don't think I'll ever make it back
So I throw stones at walls I'll never climb
Victim to the sands of time
Falling through the hourglass
The hourglass

Time (Time) is strange (Is strange), it's ever-flowing
Never going back (Back), it moves (Moves), but only in one way
Turn the page, look back at what you wrote
Do you still feel (Feel) the same (The same)?
I'll bet your mind has changed

How did it get so scary? I don't know
Was it the hard life starving our egos?
I never valued minutes I burned through
Is that just how it goes?
Seconds I wasted, I was fixated
You're devastated, sorry to say
I can't fix it, is this where I give in?
(Let's go)

I'm falling through the hourglass
And I don't think I'll ever make it back
So I throw stones at walls I'll never climb
Victim to the sands of time
Falling through the hourglass
The hourglass

'Cause that's just how it goes
'Cause that's just how it goes
'Cause that's just how it goes

Falling through the hourglass
And I don't think I'll ever make it back
So I throw stones at walls I'll never climb
Victim to the sands of time
Falling through the hourglass (Through the hourglass)
I'm falling through the hourglass (I'm falling through the hourglass)
And I don't think I'll ever make it back (Make it back)
So I throw stones at walls I'll never climb
Victim to the sands of time
Falling through the hourglass
