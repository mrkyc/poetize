For you forever, for you forever, no
For you forever, for you forever

Nothing left to learn on the shoulder of the road
Colors in the blur, she's there to fight the highway
Digging into turns, was digging out her soul
But now the pavement burns
And these signs don't point the right way

In the desert, a mirage of ecstasy
Falling for the pleasure
Sick of painting every nightmare as a dream
Wide awake and she said

I won't wait for you forever, for you forever
So, don't you say it's for the better, it's for the better
'Cause I can't take later than never, later than never
No, I won't wait for you forever
Forever
No, forever

Holding out for hope was a losing hand to play
Somewhere in the fold, got sucked into the long game

This casino, a mirage of ecstasy
Falling for the pleasure
Sick of painting every nightmare as a dream
Wide awake and she said

I won't wait for you forever, for you forever
So, don't you say it's for the better, it's for the better
'Cause I can't take later than never, later than never
No, I won't wait for you forever
Forever
No, forever
No, no, no, no, no, yeah

Gotta give it up, 'fore he gives you up
Baby, trust your gut
'Cause you know, you know
Does he give a fuck, like you give a fuck?
Baby, trust your gut
'Cause you know, you know
Say, I won't wait for you forever, for you forever
So, I won't wait for you forever

No, I won't wait for you forever, for you forever
So, don't you say it's for the better, it's for the better
'Cause I can't take later than never, later than never
No, I won't wait for you forever
Forever
Forever, forever, forever
No, forever
Woo!
Won't wait for you forever
No, no, no
