You reside in grand disguises
Just to get, get away from it all
Falsify the life you're hiding
Just to get, get away from it all

But the truth we pursue as we all beg you to

Kill the lights, kill the actor, kill the actress
I'm afraid that the spotlight dried you up, whoa, whoa-oh

Shut your mouth, you make me sick with
All the lies, all the lies that you spill
Slip and fall, I'll watch you drown in
All the lies, all the lies that you spill
As you're tongue-tied, did you believe it?
False pride never existed
Now I am cutting ties clean off
And I can breathe at last

So we all stand enthralled by this bland curtain call
And the truth we pursue as we all, we all beg you to

Kill the lights, kill the actor, kill the actress
I'm afraid that the spotlight dried you up, whoa, whoa-oh
Don't even think about it
Don't even think about it, no
We're begging you
To kill the lights, kill the actor, kill the actress
Or kill us all

Stop there and peer inside of me
You'll find a man once lost at sea
But all the while, I would think to myself
It's not the end, it's not the end at all
So sick of nothing going right
Sail on along into the night
Not even death could stand in the way
You never even tried in the first place

Kill the lights, kill the actor, kill the actress
I'm afraid that the spotlight dried you up, whoa, whoa-oh
Don't even think about it
Don't even think about it, no
We're begging you
To kill the lights, kill the actor, kill the actress
Or kill us all
Or kill us all
