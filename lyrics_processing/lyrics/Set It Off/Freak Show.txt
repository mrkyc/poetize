I am a circus freak
Caught in a cage, caught in a cage
Staring without a blink
Swallow me whole, swallow me whole

I am a circus freak
Cut out my heart, cut out my heart
Loveless and watch me bleed
Tear me apart, tear me apart
Yeah

I've lost myself in make-believe
(I don't wanna go, I don't want to go, make me)
Over and over I've deceived
(I don't wanna go, I don't want to go)
You want reform? I can't conform
Cause I can't take anymore of your tainted bliss, cause
I've lost myself in make believe
You can't break me

I am a circus freak
So many scars, so many scars
I'm just the common creep
Something to watch, something to watch
Oh, you know you can't break me

(I don't wanna go, I don't want to go, make me)
Over and over I've deceived
(I don't wanna go, I don't want to go)
You want reform? I can't conform
Cause I can't take anymore of your tainted bliss, cause
I've lost myself in make-believe
You can't break me

"Come one, come all
Step right up for the one, the lonely
Circus freak!"

You'll never break me
You'll never change me, no
La-da-da-da-da
La-da-da-da
You'll never break me
You'll never change me, no
La-da-da-da-da

I've waited ten long years just to look in the mirror
And to find just what I'm staring at
I've waited ten long years just to tell you I'm fearless
You don't understand, I've become who I am
Oh, you know you can't break me
I've lost myself in make-believe
(I don't wanna go, I don't want to go, make me)
Over and over I've deceived
(I don't wanna go, I don't want to go)
You want reform? I can't conform
Cause I can't take anymore of your tainted bliss, cause
I've lost myself in make-believe
