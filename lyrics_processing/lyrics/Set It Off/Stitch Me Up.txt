No, it's no wonder I feel broken
Are you the one to fix me up, patching up the work they've done?
Try and sew me
So thread the needle, tie it off, teach me how to trust someone

Really hopin' that you stay
That you never walk away
Every word I shouldn't say
I shouldn't say, I shouldn't say it
Don't you feel the stress in me
Steady bursting at the seams?
You're the only one I need to make me complete, yeah

Stitch me up, stitch me up, don't tear me apart
I've been stuck in a rut, patched up in the dark
Stitch me up, stitch me up, there's pins in my heart
Oh, pardon all my precious scars

No, it's no wonder you've been feeling
Like a doll in lost and found, soul mistreated, thrown around
Who you kidding?
Every flaw and every fray, that's what makes you sexy to me

Really hopin' that I stay
I could never walk away
Every word we shouldn't say
We shouldn't say, we shouldn't say it
Don't you feel the stress in me
Steady bursting at the seams?
You're the only one I need to make me complete, yeah

Stitch me up, stitch me up, don't tear me apart
I've been stuck in a rut, patched up in the dark
Stitch me up, stitch me up, there's pins in my heart
Oh, pardon all my precious scars

Elegant and broken
Tasteful tattered clothing
I guess we've been caught in the middle of love
Motive through emotion
Damaged, but we're golden
I guess we've been caught in the middle of love
Elegant and broken
Tasteful tattered clothing
I guess we've been caught in the middle of love
Motive through emotion
Damaged, but we're golden
I guess we've been caught in the middle of love
Stitch me up, stitch me up, don't tear me apart

Stitch me up, stitch me up, there's pins in my heart
Oh, pardon all my precious scars

(Really hoping that you stay, that you never walk away)
Pardon all my precious scars
Stitch me up, stitch me up, there's pins in my heart
