Watch your step around these words, 'cause
They're gonna get you, they're gonna get you in the end
I swear it's not a disease, it's just a game of pretend
A game of pretend
Why is it me they're after, couldn't they pick another one?
Someday I'll spit their laughter and bite their tongue

Horrible kids, would you look what you did
It was your ignorance that formed a beast with your wit

Horrible Kids, horrible kids, horrible kids
Look what you did

What makes this target crawl?
Is it when his feelings show?
Hold a gun to his head and you'll know
You've pushed him down as low as he can
Go, get away from me
Leave me be, I beg you please
I'm on the floor, on bended-knee
And maybe then I'll keep my sanity
And I can't stand this pain they cause me
This puzzle will solve itself
And maybe I just can't seem to put this together yet

Picture this he was just a kid
Not knowing where to begin
He wore all the wrong clothes
Followed all the wrong trends
Persecuted for the things he did
Picture this he was all alone
Without a friend to call his own
So he sat on his bed
With the thought in his head
With wishes that they all were dead
But then he saw the light
Gained the will to fight
Saw that victory was in sight
But soon they all will see
Horrible kids, would you look what you did
It was your ignorance that formed a beast with your wit
Horrible kids, would you look what you did
It was your ignorance that formed a beast with your wit

Horrible Kids, horrible kids, horrible kids
Look what we did
Horrible Kids, horrible kids, horrible kids
