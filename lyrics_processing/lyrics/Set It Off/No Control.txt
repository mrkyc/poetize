It's like watching a rose just wither away
When beauty crumbles and decays
It's like having a voice, with no chance to speak
It's something that you hold, and hold to keep

Fall to my knees, god, I beg you please
Show me just a little mercy
Help me, help me; I'm doing all I can
Pretend I'm unaffected, but their pain became my burden

Swear this isn't what I wanted
God, this house is haunted
The way that this could be, if things would remedy
And after all of this we've been through
I wish that we could switch shoes
This life ain't fair for us all

My ears resound with the sound of broken dreams
I had where you would breathe exist eternally
Tell them to leave, you're coming home with me
Remove that damn IV
I wish my words could cure illness

It's like running a race with no legs or
Swimming a lap with no arms
The door may have slammed in my face but
The windows will heal my scars

Swear this isn't what I wanted
God, this house is haunted
The way that this could be if things would remedy
And after all of this we've been through
I wish that we could switch shoes
This life ain't fair for us all

My walls are built and on display
I drown in guilt due to dismay
Maybe someday I can see how this has shaped me
Bite my tongue, with swelling lungs
I gasp for air and let this go

Swear this isn't what I wanted
God, this house is haunted
The way that this could be if things would remedy
And after all this shit we've been through
I wish that we could switch shoes
