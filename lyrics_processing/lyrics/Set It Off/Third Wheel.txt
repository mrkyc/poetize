I've been thinking for a while now
And no, I don't doubt
That he's ever gonna give it a rest
The conversation didn't take place
I'll need a neck brace
To give him if he tries to see her face

This gnat lurks around and never obeys
Another mental breakdown saves the day
While you cry I'll try my best to convey
In every way, I adore to say

Yeah, I think that I'm falling for you
And now I'm not sure what he's going to do
And so he's begging me, begging me to just stay away
Because I'm gonna get my baby
I'm gonna get my baby tonight

Third wheel, try and deal your best hand
You bet I can't stand every little thing you stand for
A salesman waiting at the door like a filthy whore
I'll leave you lonely and abandoned, and-

This gnat lurks around and never obeys
Another mental breakdown saves the day
While you cry I'll try my best to convey
In every way, I adore to say

Yeah, I think that I'm falling for you
And now I'm not sure what he's going to do
And so he's begging me, begging me to just stay away
Because I'm gonna get my baby
I'm gonna get my baby tonight

You think you're in like sin
But you're way too far behind
You excel in sabotage, this dark collage
Of everything you've tried to destroy
Keep trying, keep lying
You'll never find your way to her heart (heart)

I think that I'm falling for you
And now I'm not sure what he's going to do
And so he's begging me, begging me to just stay away
Because I'm gonna get my baby
I'm gonna get my baby tonight (Yeah, yeah)
I'm gonna get my baby tonight (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm gonna get my baby
I think that I'm falling for you
And now I'm not sure what he's going to do
And so he's begging me, begging me to just stay away
Because I'm gonna get my baby
