Thanks for treating me like every boy you meet
So please come in and take a seat
Here's the part when I learn, and you will teach
On how to treat people like a piece of meat
I want a genuine, not a replica
Lethal medicine, a pin to the cornea
A sight for sore eyes
While other guys consume the lie, I'll run and hide

No doors exist on my fortress
The only entrance is the one I bear
You're nothing more than a temptress
I fell victim to a heartless snare

Burn the bitch down
I never will cross that bridge again
I cannot trust you easily
Or think that I am the only one
I never let people in and I have you to remind me why
So, baby, burn the bitch down
I never will cross that bridge again
I'd rather drown

I'm the master of construction
Because I'm building walls like it's my occupation
If you portray a liar, I'll shut you out without hesitation
It's an art form of consummate skill
Oh, how she plays them like the pawn
Making boys drool at her will
Like Pavlov to the dogs

No doors exist on my fortress
The only entrance is the one I bear
You're nothing more than a temptress
I fell victim to a heartless snare

Burn the bitch down
I never will cross that bridge again
I cannot trust you easily
Or think that I am the only one
I never let people in and I have you to remind me why
So, baby, burn the bitch down
I never will cross that bridge again
I'd rather, I'd rather, I'd rather-

Drown me, slit my throat so lightly
Pick me up and drop me right into my grave
And now I wonder, sit alone and ponder
Should I even bother, when I see your face?
The itch I couldn't scratch
Thought I'd come crawling back, but no
I'd much rather, rather, rather, rather, rather, rather
Sing it, boys
I'd rather burn the bitch down
I never will cross that bridge again
I cannot trust you easily
Or think that I am the only one
I never let people in and I have you to remind me why
So, baby, burn the bitch down
I never will cross that bridge again
Go ahead and burn the bridge right down it's what she wanted
(Burn the bridge right down
I am not the only one, the only one)
So, baby, burn the bitch down
I never will cross that bridge again
