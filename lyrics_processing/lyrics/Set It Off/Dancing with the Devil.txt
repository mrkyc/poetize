Life's too short to be dancing with the Devil
Life's too short to be dancing with the Devil
You best sleep with a blanket and a shovel
'Cause life's too short to be dancing with the Devil

Where am I? My hands are tied
Turn on the lights and I see you standing
Over me, it's hard to breathe
I can't believe that you'd do this to me

Years of us building the trust up
No love was ever enough
I'm foolish to think we were friends
It's funny how it ends

You know, when times get tough, you always give up
I know your smoking gun's the tip of your tongue
You take your aim to point the blame, it's time we let it go
So save your lies, behind those eyes, you're a devil in disguise

Life's too short to be dancing with the Devil
Life's too short to be dancing with the Devil
You best sleep with a blanket and a shovel
'Cause life's too short to be dancing with the Devil
See Set It Off LiveGet tickets as low as $36You might also like
Now it's time to pay the price
No playing nice when you live so selfish
Have a drink and make a scene
Embarrass me 'cause you're lost and hopeless

Years of us building the trust up
No love was ever enough
I'm foolish to think we were friends
It's funny how it ends

And you know, when times get tough, you always give up
I know your smoking gun's the tip of your tongue
You take your aim to point the blame, it's time we let it go
So save your lies, behind those eyes, you're a devil in disguise

Life's too short to be dancing with the Devil (Yeah)
Life's too short to be dancing with the Devil (Yeah)
You best sleep with a blanket and a shovel
'Cause life's too short to be dancing with the Devil

You try to act as if you're saving me
But you wouldn't cut the rope if it was hanging me
I'm sick of people saying what you sow, you reap
'Cause I've been counting down the minutes of that, so to speak
Think of all the hours and hours of grind
That would turn it into sour findings
As I wonder if our resigning is becoming the silver lining
But I'm not a coward, I'm fighting
'Cause if they're the meat, then I'm biting
Go ahead ignoring and smiling
'Cause I'm climbing 'til I let
You know, when times get tough, you always give up
I know your smoking gun's the tip of your tongue
You take your aim to point the blame, it's time we let it go
So save your lies, behind those eyes (Yeah, yeah)
You know, when times get tough, you always give up
I know your smoking gun's the tip of your tongue
You take your aim to point the blame, it's time we let it go
So save your lies, behind those eyes, you're a devil in disguise

Life's too short to be dancing with the Devil (Yeah)
Life's too short to be dancing with the Devil (Yeah)
You best sleep with a blanket and a shovel (Uh-huh)
