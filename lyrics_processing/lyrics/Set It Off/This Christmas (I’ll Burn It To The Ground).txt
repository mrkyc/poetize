Fa la la la la, la la la la
Tis the season to be jolly
Fa la la la la, la la la la...
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!
Oh my God, it's here, this awful time of year
How I hate the snow is falling
Wealthy neighbors bragging about the gifts they're getting
Hey Jack! They say, let me take a guess now! You're getting K-Mart clothes again!
And then, I had a revelation!
This is my chance to sew their lips clean shut with fear
Because...
This Christmas, I'll burn it to the ground!
This Christmas, Santa's skipping town!
This Christmas, everything will change, when they see the flames
This Christmas day!
Christmas lights alive, lighting up the night
Meanwhile I'm inside my room, conniving though the cheer and laughter that resumes
Tonights the night, I have to do it right now!
So, I will strike when all's asleep
And creep, sneaking through your chimney!
Saint Nic is gone for now

Kiss your Christmas tree goodbye!
Because...
This Christmas, I'll burn it to the ground!
This Christmas, Santa's skipping town!
This Christmas, everything will change, when they see the flames
This Christmas day!
Oh, make fun of me, will you?!
Well I'll show you what true misery feels like!
You see, as my idol once said
Everything burns!
Hey everyone! Look outside your window! I have a surprise for you!
Imagine this
One thousand gifts, and sixteen trees all lay in a heap in a cul-de-sac
I strike my match, and I blaze the trail of gasoline
This Christmas
I'm ending the game
This Christmas
What a bright shame
This Christmas
Because...
This Christmas, I'll burn it to the ground!
This Christmas, Santa skipping town!
This Christmas, everything will change, when they see the flames
