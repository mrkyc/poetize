(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

What a wild, wild world we live in (Ooh, ooh)
Where money talks and trouble sells (Ooh, ooh)
Where if we strive to find the heavens (No, no)
Then we got to walk through hell (Ooh, ooh)

Well, if we crave a change
Why not start today?
And sing it out loud

We're not going crazy
We're learning to fly
We're looking for answers
With both of our eyes
Well, maybe it's time to tame the monster inside
Of this wild, wild world we live in (Ooh, ooh)
Wild world we live in

(Let's go)
There's a million pieces missin' (Ooh, ooh)
And seven worlds to fall apart (Like that)
Well, how can one man make a difference? (How?)
Maybe love is where it starts (Ooh, ooh)

Destroy and rebuild, it's kill or be killed
But we can change, we can change everything
A little love never hurt anything
