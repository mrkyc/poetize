When's the last time I felt this low? (Low)
I dug myself a canyon to hide my woes
Lost myself somewhere in the deep, mm
Down where silver linings are hard to see

The only way to feel this sad's if I felt something before
Higher moods and better days and not so insecure
I keep forgetting what I've had and craving so much more
But lost in a familiar place, these words will bring me home

It's okay, you're not crazy
Gotta taste the salt to love the sweet
Let it out and scream
I'm okay, I'm not crazy
'Cause the tears remind me I'm alive
It's fine to not be happy all the time

Sometimes, living feels like a chore (Chore)
Picking your emotions up off the floor
When hope feels like a four-letter word (Word)
Ooh, that's when you say "fuck it" and live uncensored
