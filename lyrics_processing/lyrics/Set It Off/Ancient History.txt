No, there's no denying chemistry this strong
Yes, pretend it's right but we both know it's wrong
Thinking about the storm advancing
Thinking about the lightning dancing
In your eyes
But I can't shake these memories that rain inside

Tension builds
I think we're under-thinking part time thrills
I know, I know how to drive you wild
You know, you know how to make me smile
But I need you to be
My ancient history

Damn, pick up the phone, uh-oh, I'm drunk again
And you know my intentions 'cause it's 2AM
It's fun and games until we both get hurt
We play with fire 'cause we like the way it burns
No use in patching up a sinking ship
This is the last time we do this, baby
This is the last time you taste my lips

Got you running through my head
When I know I should be sleeping
But I can't escape
You're addicted to the lust
The imaginary trust
That you're begging for me, screaming for it
Here we go, now it's time to cut the cord
And abandon all support
We're through

I know, I know how to drive you wild
You know, you know how to make me smile
But I need you to be
My ancient history
I know, I know who you really are
You know, you know how to break my heart
But I need you to be
My ancient history
I know, I know
You know, you know
(No baby don't come back, don't come back)
But I need you to be
