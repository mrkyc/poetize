You don't even bother anymore
You cut to the bone, pick up the phone
To hear my swan song

I'll admit I'm impressed by your vanishing act
Place your bets on your best guess of when you're coming back
Draw the curtains, take the stage
Smoke and mirrors underway
Hold your breath, here comes the turn
This is where we all got burned

Promises are broken, tell me, are you happy now?
Drowning in the hourglass, I guess our time ran out

You don't even bother anymore
You cut to the bone, pick up the phone
To hear my swan song
You don't even bother anymore
You left me alone, I'm on my own
Tell me where we went wrong

Should I turn on the floodlights to shine in your eyes
Just to get you to speak and explain why you let it die
This new chapter in your life, read it over once or twice
Burn the pages not the bridge
Sew your wounds without a stitch

Promises are broken, tell me, are you happy now?
Drowning in the hourglass, I guess our time ran out
I hope you're listening

You don't even bother anymore
You cut to the bone, pick up the phone
To hear my swan song
You don't even bother anymore
You left me alone, I'm on my own
Tell me where we went wrong

Tell me where we all went wrong
Tell me where, tell me where
Tell me where

Oh, abandon the people who shaped who you are
Selfish and thoughtless, you drown in the dark
I hope that you realize the damage you've done
You could not see light even staring at the sun, sun

Promises are broken, tell me, are you happy now?
Drowning in the hourglass, I guess our time ran out
You don't even bother anymore
You cut to the bone, pick up the phone
To hear my swan song
You don't even bother anymore
You left me alone, I'm on my own
Tell me where we went wrong
Tell me where we went wrong
Tell me where we went wrong
