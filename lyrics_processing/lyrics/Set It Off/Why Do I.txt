Sometimes, I write you letters that you'll never read
When I get to drinkin', I get to thinkin'
I wish you were thinkin' about me (Why do I?)
Sometimes, I look for girls that look the way you do
So fucking stupid, started to do it
When I saw you with someone new (Why do I?)

It's been ten months and twenty days
I'm the last thing that's on your brain

So why do I still wake up, two in the morning
Cold sweats screamin' your name?
Why do I get drunk and look at your pictures?
Why do I feel this way?
Why do I do this to myself?
And why do I even try?
You don't, you don't
So baby, why do I?
(Why do I? Why do I? Oh, oh, uh)

Some nights, I think about the last time that we talked
Back in November, maybe December
All I remember's that you called me a piece of shit
Said you never wanna see my face again
You regret everything we ever did
You're obviously over it, so over it

So why do I still wake up, two in the morning

And why do I even try?
You don't, you don't
So baby, why do I?
(Why do I? Why do I? Hey-ay, yeah)

It's been ten months and twenty days
I've been wonderin' the same damn things

So why do I still wake up, two in the morning
Cold sweats screamin' your name? (Woo)
Why do I get drunk and look at your pictures?
Why do I feel this way?
Why do I do this to myself? (Why?)
And why do I even try?
You don't, you don't
So baby, why do I?
(Oh yeah)
(You don't, you don't)
(Why do I? Why do I?)
(You don't, you don't)
(So baby, why do I?)
(You don't, you don't)
(Why do I? Why do I?)
(You don't, you don't)
