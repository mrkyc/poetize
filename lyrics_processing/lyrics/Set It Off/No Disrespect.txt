So there you go again
You wanna play pretend, well, I can't
To try to reminisce
Go running back to him like you planned
You're stepping on the gas
To run right over him where he stands
Can't be a part of this
Girl, why you trifling on your man?

I'm sorry, but I would not invite a thief
To watch my house or hold my things
I'm sayin' if you were walkin' in these shoes
You would trip over the truth

I wish I could forget, 'get, 'get, 'get
Forget we ever met, met, met, met
You know we hit a dead end, dead end
So turn around, reroute, reset, no disrespect
No disrespect, no disrespect
So turn around, reroute, reset, no disrespect

So here I go again
Back in the lion's den, here's your chance
To right the wrongs you've made
You took another swing and a miss
Next time you're both in bed
And he's inside his head, answer this
What will you say to him
To build the confidence that you killed?

'Cause I don't see you the way you want to
Forget your rescue, you're dreaming, dreaming, dreaming
We had our good times, but time has passed by
Begin your new life, I'm reaching, pleading, screaming

I wish I could forget, 'get, 'get, 'get
Forget we ever met, met, met, met
You know we hit a dead end, dead end
So turn around, reroute, reset
I wish I could forget, 'get, 'get, 'get (I wish I could forget)
Forget we ever met, met, met, met (Forget we ever met)
You know we hit a dead end, dead end (You know we hit a dead end)
So turn around, reroute, reset, no disrespect ('Get, 'get, 'get, 'get)
No disrespect (Met, met, met, met)
No disrespect (Dead end, dead end)
