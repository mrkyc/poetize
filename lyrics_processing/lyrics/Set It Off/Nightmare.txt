They're coming, creeping from the corner
And all I know is that I don't feel safe
I feel the tapping on my shoulder
I turn around in an alarming state
But am I losing my mind? I really think so
Not a creature in sight
But, what you don't know

Is that my breathing gets faster and so does my heartbeat
I wish this was over, I wish that this was a dream but

I created a monster, a hell within my head
With nowhere to go, I'm out on my own
Oh, I'm so scared
I created a monster, a beast inside my brain
With nowhere to go, I'm out on my own
My mind impaired
Awake me from my nightmare

Wait, something doesn't feel right (feel right)
No, something seems wrong (wrong)
And I've been feeling this way (oh that's too bad)
For far too long
As my vision gets blurred, my skin's getting colder
Appearing young, while I'm growing older
I collapse to the floor and scream:
"Can anybody save me from myself?"

I created a monster, a hell within my head
With nowhere to go, I'm out on my own
Oh, I'm so scared
I created a monster, a beast inside my brain
With nowhere to go, I'm out on my own
My mind impaired
Awake me from my nightmare

Walking to the ledge, I find myself looking down
Frozen still with fear, now I'm plunging to the ground
If only I knew how to fly
Then I could convince myself this isn't my time to die
Instead I'm rocketing faster and faster
I dive-bomb to the floor
And when my body crashes to the pavement
I'm right back where I was before

I created a monster, a hell within my head
With nowhere to go, I'm out on my own
Oh, I'm so scared
I created a monster, a hell within my head
With nowhere to go, I'm out on my own
Oh, I'm so scared, no, whoa
I created a monster, a beast inside my brain
With nowhere to go, I'm out on my own
My mind impaired
Awake me from my nightmare (I'm so scared)
Awake me from my nightmare (I'm so scared)
Awake me from my nightmare (I'm so scared)
Awake me from my nightmare (I'm so scared)
