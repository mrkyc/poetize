Rack 'em up and stack 'em, stack 'em while I got 'em
Knock 'em back and drag 'em; look at me, I stole 'em
(Look at me, I stole 'em, look at me, I stole 'em)
(Look at me, I stole 'em, look at me, I stole 'em)
Body made of platinum, rope full let me at 'em
Cause I'm on top, oh, buffalo stancin'
(Body made of platinum, body made of platinum)
(Body made of platinum, buffalo stancin')

I remember the time, remember the time
Pirate on the waves from the get go
But I put in the time, I put in the time
I never was afraid, never let go
I remember the time, remember the time
Pirate on the waves from the get go
But I put in the time, I put in the time
I never was afraid, never let go

Big drippy I'm a grab it
Zooming through a sea plastic
