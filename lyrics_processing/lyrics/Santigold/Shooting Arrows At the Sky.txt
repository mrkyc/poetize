What's the story now? All this talk, it's in the way
She got an opinion, like the devil's in me's how they say
Not like the others, I got a genie on my own
Watch you fumble not another
And waste it like the ones before

I never wait
You miss with your magic
I never wait to see
You miss with your magic
I never wait to see
You miss with your magic
Will find you when it fall back
You're shooting arrows at the sky

Did you hear the warning? You didn't recognize the call
I don't believe it, you'll write the ending for us all
Think you're above it, you count your wins for numbers sold
So I build me a bubble, then build a world I know will hold

I never wait
You miss with your magic
I never wait to see
You miss with your magic
I never wait to see
You miss with your magic
Will find you when it fall back
You're shooting arrows at the sky

Oh no, they're taking me on, I'm no hero
Oh no, they're taking me on away from home
I know they're thinking that there's no way I could
But you hold me down, and I'll aim for you

I never wait
You miss with your magic
I never wait to see
You miss with your magic
I never wait to see
You miss with your magic
Will find you when it fall back
You're shooting arrows at the sky
You're shooting arrows at the sky

I never wait
You miss with your magic
I never wait to see
You miss with your magic
I never wait to see
You miss with your magic
Will find you when it fall back
