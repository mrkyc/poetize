This one goes out to all of you around the world who know what you want and go get it

I had to swerve on little mama 'cause she out here with that llama
Alpaca on my arm, I'm stayin' warm in any storm
A super chef with the snow captain
Out here, move it, make it happen
Drop the top on 'em like, "Oh goddamn, what happened?"
Hair be goin', curls be blowin', girls be goin' crazy, hon
See me in your city playin' shows at the stadium
Songs be goin' up and down and turnin' smiles from your frown
I just wanna get you now, (Now) now

Talkin' 'bout it, what we had, I been turned off

Got no time to hear you out, my shit takin' off

Back home say I always seemed wild
Got my name in lights so bright now

In this here world I'm a jetsetter...
