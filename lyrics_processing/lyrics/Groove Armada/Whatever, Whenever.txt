I'm digitally black that's fat now feel the function
Rise to the rhyme line you and I waiting to jump
And now we get forced to the forefront
I'm used to the Armada kicking karma to capitals
The small tribes world wide who vibe with the rapping too
We take it to the clubs rub a dubs on the radio
And whack it to the maximum at home on your stereo
My microphone presents a little love in the area, won't ya
Turn up the temperature and move with the messenger
It's easy on the ride this is harmony made
We can rewind come again with the blend and sway
Whatever, whenever, however ya like
This is rude this is good this is nice and tight, alright
Now step into the musical
Miracle miraculously free, feeling physically spiritual
The seven sounds surround the mind in the middle
Reverberate your state, create the chemical
To culminate the taste, the touch just imagine
The panoramic view and you can make it happen
The beauty of the beat is that its there with you
All the time materially struggle but we're rich with the inner rhyme
The frequency I'm feeling gets me up in another way
This melody I'm hearing I can listen to anyway
My music is a meditation new technique
No need to speak just let the rhythm reach and reach
There's nothing more sometimes to do
That than keep continuously true and do the best for you
You might also likeWhatever, whenever, however you like
'Cause this is good this is cool this is nice and tight
I mean like it when the vibes make my stress fall free
And keep me calm and on me center like a sanctuary
Hey, whatever, the pressure permeates the place
I'm operating on the bass and navigating the chase
To embrace, I'm merging with the sound's intent
Communicating on a level the moment invents; intense
I'm definitely easy and smooth
You and that sound boy groove
Yeah, my MC move
In tune, in time, intoxicating the swing
We take it proper to the top with this feeling we bring
Hey, whatever, whenever, however you like
'Cause this is good this is cool this is nice and tight
I mean like it when the vibes make my stress fall free
