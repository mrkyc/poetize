'Cause you're too far down
You know you can't get up
When you can't get down
You know you can't get up
'Cause you're too far down, song on
Okay, this what I'm on
Kick it to the club with the sound in the song
Freein' my mind from all that's goin' on
Tryin' to be right but it feels so wrong
Goddamn it, I'm drunk
Don't turn the lights on
I don't need y'all to tell me when to go home
2, 3, 4 in the morn'
It's a free world I can do what I want
DJ, raise it back up
Who got that weed, we can blaze it back up
Look at that girl, she can't make it back up
We was just crankin' up, hey, y'all leavin' for what?
Man, I thought it was a party y'all
We can all get it crackin' like Mardi Gras
You can take your beads off, pull off your bra
But if you try to stand me up I'm a probably fall
You might also likeSo I might have to be the one
To turn the world around
Put love where they had hate
And make the world get down
And you might have to be the one
To change it with me too
And if they try to stop us
We'll say funk you too
Yeah, yeah, and all the girls say
(Aah)
Love, y'all
Goddamn it, I mean it man
I bought the band, don't lean and stand
It's the last chance throw up your hands
Whatcha standin' 'round for, move around and dance
Now hit the flo' hit the flo'
When you see a girl get the ho, get the ho
Get her to the bar get the mo, get the mo
And when you get her drunk gotta go, gotta go
Gone, batta bing a bong
See my tires smoke like cheech and chong
We ain't on the roof but I see her thong
Got me beatin' on my chest like king or kong
Pullin' on your hair 'til the weave is gone
Early in the mornin' when you're breathin' wrong
Even when I hear you breathin' on the phone
Just pull out the tape and rewind the song
So I might have to be the one
To turn the world around
Put love where they had hate
And make the world get down
And you might have to be the one
To change it with me too
And if they try to stop us
We'll say funk you too
Yeah, yeah, and all the girls say
(Aah)
