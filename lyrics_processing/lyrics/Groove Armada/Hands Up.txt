It ain't a black thing, or a white thing
Get high, get drunk all night
It's a chill, hangout make sure you're all right
When they play this song, they start dancin'
If they can't get in they throw a tantrum
When the girls see me they say I'm handsome
DJ, play this, my anthem
If you feel good, put your hands up
I'ma get the party people what they payin' for
Don't be Hollywood
Put your hands, put your hands
Put your hands up
If you feel good, put your hands up
I'ma get the party people what they payin' for
Don't be Hollywood
Put your hands, put your hands
Put your hands up
Groove!
You gotta boogie on
To the dance floor, let your hands go
I'ma get the party people what they payin' for
And now when I go out to the club
I'm trying dance and cut a rug
I'm a get a few drinks in my system, system
And holla at a freak in my distance

She see my goatee and said, 'I like your style'
Got some weed, a girl, a bottle of Patron
