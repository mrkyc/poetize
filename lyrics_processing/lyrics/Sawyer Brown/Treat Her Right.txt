A lot of people breakin' hearts these days
Givin' up and just walkin' away
Forever's just another word
That you hear young lovers say
I know it may be old fashioned, but I still believe
Love stays when the strong winds blow
Even when it hurts, don't let go

You've got to treat her right, understand
That she's your woman and you're her man
And tell her that you need her
Like the desert needs the rain
And if you treat her right and show her you care
When you need her, she'll be there
Like an island in the storm, a beacon in the night
And if you love her, treat her right

A good woman ain't easy to find
The faithful and the lovin' kind
And if you don't hold her tight
She'll slip right through your hands
Love gives more than it takes
So be willin' for her sake
Stand by her when the strong winds blow
Even when it hurts, don't let go
