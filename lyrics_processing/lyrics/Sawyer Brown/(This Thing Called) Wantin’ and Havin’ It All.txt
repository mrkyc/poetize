Now he's sitting at the table with his lawyer
Goin' over his will 'cause he's ill
The kids don't call, they're waitin' for the man to die
He's gonna leave 'em all a little somethin'
But they're gonna be real surprised
There's a poor man livin' on a budget at the bottom of the hill
With a wife and two kids and a worried mind
About how he's gonna pay the bills
Well, only the rich man knows see
That's where a lot of his money goes
To the man that brought wood in the winter
To take a little weight off his shoulders
There's this thing called wantin' and havin' it all
If you're gonna get there you're gonna have to walk
But first you'll have to crawl
And you know you've gotta do it step by step
Miss one and you'll fall into this well
Called wantin' and havin' it all
Poor man has everything that the rich man don't
He's got love in his life and his heart
He's got a house he calls home
The rich man owns everything from miles around
But what he needs can't be bought, it has to be found

Called wantin' and havin' it all
See life's full of changes
And wantin' right now what you only see in your dreams
I know you don't like it
And think it's the strangest thing you've ever seen
Well, there ain't nothin' you can do about it
There's this thing called wantin' and havin' it all
If you're gonna get there you're gonna have to walk
