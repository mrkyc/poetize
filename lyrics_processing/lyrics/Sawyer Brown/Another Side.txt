And they put us on the line
You could smell the powder burnin'
And man, it hurt my eyes
They knew them boys were tired and weak-
We were fresh and we were strong
We could not wait to blast away
And make our presence known
But every time I took my aim
And got one in my sight
In my heart I knew the way
And this way was not right
Oh, I guess my daddy would be proud
But my momma, she's ashamed
And I know deep down we need a change
Them Northern boys are friends of mine
But I've got my Southern pride
I'm standin' here a-fightin'
Wishin' there
Was another side
We burned each other's crops and fields
And took the very best
We fought our way back and forth
Then they put us to the test
I know that some things are wrong
But what gave them the right
To point their righteous fingers
And expect us not to fight?
We all cried on the night they burned Atlanta down
How much more can we take and still stand our ground?

I'm standin' here a-fightin'
Wishin' there
Was another side
In four years the smoke had cleared
And I went back to the farm
Little brother met me at the bridge
And he held out his arms
He was thin and weak and wounded
And dressed in Yankee blue
Well, I cried and I held him
And together we both knew
If it could be done over
There would be a better way
Still one family, and one nation
Oh, but what a price we paid
I guess my daddy would be proud
But my momma, she's ashamed
And I know deep down we need a change
Now, some of them boys were friends of mine
But dang this Southern pride
I'm standin' here a-cryin'
Wishin' there
Was another side
I'm wishin' there was another side
