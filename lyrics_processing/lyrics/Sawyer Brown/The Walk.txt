Down our long dusty driveway, I didn't wanna go
But I set out with tears in my eyes a-wonderin'
Daddy took me by the hand
Looked out at the school bus and his little man and said
"Don't worry, boy, it'll be alright"

'Cause I took this walk you're walkin' now
Boy, I've been in your shoes
Well, you can't hold back the hands of time
It's just somethin' you've got to do
So dry your eyes, I understand
Just what you're goin' through
'Cause I took this same walk with my old man
Boy, I've been in your shoes

Down our long dusty driveway, I set my mind to go
Well, I was eighteen and wild and free and a-wonderin'
Daddy took me by the hand
Looked out at the world and at his grown man and said
"Don't worry, boy, it'll be alright"

'Cause I took this walk you're walkin' now
Boy, I've been in your shoes
Well, you can't hold back the hands of time
It's just somethin' you've got to do
So dry your eyes, I understand
Just what you're goin' through
'Cause I took this same walk with my old man
Boy, I've been in your shoes

Don't worry, boy, it'll be alright"

'Cause I took this walk you're walkin' now
