Her kids yelling kicking up a fuss
Everbodys staring not knowing what shes going through
Somebody said dont you even care
Or do u let them do that everywhere
The woman turned around looked up and said
She said please forgive them they've been up all night
Their father struggled and he finally lost his fight
He went to heaven in the middle of the night
So please forgive my children
They dont understand
Everybodys busy with their own situation
Everybodys lost in their own little world
Bottled up hurried up trying to make a dream come true
They dont understand
Everybodys living like there ain't no tommorow
Maybe we should stop and take a little time
Because you never really know what your neighbors going through
Try to understand
A man driving down the interstate
Slowing down traffic making everybody wait
Everybodys staring not knowing what he's going through
Somebody said man I don't have the time
I'm running late now im stuck in line
Old man turned around and caught his eye
He said please forgive me it's been a long hard life
My wifes in a nursing home and my kids don't have the time
I've been left all alone and its getting hard to drive
So please forgive me children i hope you understand
