Yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
Oh oh
Whoa, yeah

I never knew real love, real love
'Til you were mine
And I, and I never knew each touch
Between us would feel like the first time
The very first time, well
See, I remember the days of hurt and pain
Just wouldn't let go, oh-oh-oh oh oh oh
And now every night shines so brightly
And I know, I know I'm not alone
Not alone no more, no

I can't let go
I can't let go
I can't let go, let go (I can't, let go, let go)
All I know
All I know, all I know
I know, I know
Is I can't
I can't let go
You might also like
So much of you, your love
Your love inside my heart
Words can't really explain
Explain, and I
I just don't believe, I don't believe
That I can go on
If I ever let it slip away, slip away

All I want to do is love you (All I want)
Every day, every day (Every day)
From now until forever, baby love
Your heart belongs to me
And that's just the way it's suppose to be
'Cause I won't let you go

I can't let go
I can't let go
I can't let go, let go (Let you go)
All I know
All I know, all I know (You make me feel so real)
I know, I know
Is I can't (Yeah)
I can't let go
I can't let go (I can't let you go)
I can't let go (Or your lovin')
I can't let go, let go
All I know (All I know)
All I know, all I know
I know, I know
Is I can't (Can't let go)
I can't let go
Oh, oh, oh
Yeah, yeah
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Now ever since we first met
I knew that you were the one for me, for me
And I, I promised myself that I would never let you leave
No, no, no, no, no, no

Never lettin' you leave
Never lettin' you go
Never lettin' you be
Not ever until I know
That you (You belong to me)
Never lettin' you leave
Never lettin' you go
Never lettin' you be
Not ever until I know
That you (You belong to me, baby)
Never lettin' you leave
Never lettin' you go
Never lettin' you be
Not ever until I know
That you (You belong, you belong to me)
Never lettin' you leave
Never lettin' you go
Never lettin' you be
Not ever until I know
That you (You belong to me)
Never lettin' you leave
Never lettin' you go
Never lettin' you be
Not ever until I know
That you...
Never lettin' you leave
Never lettin' you go
Never lettin' you be
Not ever until I know
