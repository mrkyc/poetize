You're so sexy
Heaven help me please
I need to get my mind right
And it's so hard because
You're so incredible
Those lips of yours, so luscious
I just wanna bite
And I could do that all night

(Sexy gloss, matte or frost)
Don't matter 'cause it's coming off
You're so sexy, I can't help myself
(Ruby Red, Pink Champagne)
Don't matter 'cause it ends the same
Never lasting when I get to you

Crazy, crazy wonderful
Can you really feel it? Uh-oh-oh
I wanna be your cherry kiss
You can put your lips like this
Crazy, crazy wonderful
Can you really feel it? Uh-oh-oh
I wanna kiss you all the time
That's how I go through lipstick

I can't get used to how you make me feel
I just wanna eat you up
Unequivocal, the way they move
So wet and smooth
I keep coming back
I can't get enough, no

Don't matter 'cause it's coming off
You're so sexy, I can't help myself

My lipstick always ends the same
Never lasting when I get to you
