Nah nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah nah

When you and I first met
We were so inseparable (So inseparable)
And on that last day I left
Thinkin' we'd need a miracle (Need a miracle)
'Cause every little word that you said to me
Became the biggest pain in my heart
And all my pride making me pretend
To be so happy that we're apart
You just don't understand

You just don't understand
You've got to be there for me
You hold my heart in your hand
You've got to be there for me
You just don't understand
Nah nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah
You might also like
So far down this road
I'm not sure we can repair (Sure we can repair)
And each and every time we be on the phone
We both actin' like we don't care (Actin' like we don't care)
It would be so sad to me
To be the one that got away (One that got away)
And it hurts just as much to see
To see the feelings we have decay
Decay in front of our eyes

You just don't understand
You've got to be there for me (You)
You hold my heart in your hand
You've got to be there for me (You just don't understand)
You just don't understand (Oh, no no)
You just don't understand
You've got to be there for me (You got to be there, yeah)
You hold my heart in your hand
You've got to be there for me

You're all that I have
You don't understand
Nah nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah (Just can't)
Nah nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah

Be there
Be there
Be there
Be there
Be there
You've got to be there for me (No no no no no no)
Be there
Be there
Be there
Be there
Be there (You)
You've got to be there for me (You oh)
You've got to be there for me (Oh, you got to be)
You've got to be there for me (Be there, oh)
You've got to be there for me (Oh oh)
You've got to be there for me
