Funny how it's hard to find the words sometimes, you know?
Wishin' we could read minds, don't wanna let our feelings show
So even if you say you don't understand
I'm willing to give as much time as I can
'Cause every time our eyes meet

Every time our eyes meet
It be talkin', talkin', talkin', talkin' to me (Talkin' to me)
Talkin', talkin', talkin', talkin' to me (Uh)
Just ain't no need for words to speak
'Cause every touch
Be talkin', talkin', talkin', talkin' to me
Between us
Be talkin', talkin', talkin' to me (Talkin' to me)

You're always actin' so composed and cool
Never got too many words for me (Too many words)
Then turn your head to make sure I see (Just to make sure)
Baby, ain't nothin' wrong with the love
That you and I dream of, so sweet
Your actions say more than your lips can speak (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
My friends say that they just can't see (They just can't see)
How a love unspoken can be so deep (Can be so deep)
And every time that you look my way
I see what your heart wants to say to me
You might also like
Every time our eyes meet (Ooh, yeah)
It be talkin', talkin', talkin', talkin' to me (Ooh, talkin' to me, yeah, yeah)
Talkin', talkin', talkin', talkin' to me
Just ain't no need for words to speak (Oh, ain't no need for words)
'Cause every touch
Be talkin', talkin', talkin', talkin' to me (No, no, no, no, no)
Between us
Be talkin', talkin', talkin' to me (My eyes meet yours)

Every time our eyes meet (Meet yours)
It be talkin', talkin', talkin', talkin' to me
Talkin', talkin', talkin', talkin' to me (To me)
Just ain't no need for words to speak
'Cause every touch (Every touch you give is like you're talkin' to me)
Be talkin', talkin', talkin', talkin' to me
Between us
Be talkin', talkin', talkin' to me

Every time our eyes meet (Oh, yeah)
It be talkin', talkin', talkin', talkin' to me (Oh, yeah)
