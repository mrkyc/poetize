Can't breathe, can't think
Been through enough
My friends on the streets stopped so abrupt
"What's wrong?," they demand, "Tell us what's up?"
No need, one look and they all shut up
See, it's written all over, anyone could see
No matter how my daily attitude seems
And I'm tired of missin' what I can replace
So I'm tired of the world knowin' your mistakes
And the tears keep rolling down my face

Rolling down my face
Rolling down my face
Tears keep rolling down my face
Rolling down my face (Oh-oh)
Tears keep rolling down my face
Rolling down my face
They keep rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling
They keep rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling (Ayy)
They keep rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling

Please take this phone, I don't wanna talk
'Cause my makeup's constantly runnin' off
My body's so quick to follow suit
'Cause I run from every memory of you
And every attempt to just to let it go
Just keeps a knot caught in my throat
But it's one thing I figured out
The last thing that I want is you around
But the tears keep rolling down
You might also like
Rolling down my face
Rolling down my face (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Tears keep rolling down my face
Rolling down my face (Ah baby)
Tears keep rolling down my face (Ah baby)
Rolling down my face (Oh-oh)
They keep rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling
(No matter what I)
They keep rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling
(No matter what I)
They keep rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling (Oh)
They keep rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling (Ayy)
They keep rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling (Yeah)

Hey, oh
You see, it's better to love and lost
Than never love before
But I don't wanna hear no more
A thousand times I close my eyes (I close my eyes)
Wishing I could turn back
The hands of time
I tried to tell myself I never loved you
I lied (Lied, lied)
But the tears keep rolling down

Rolling down my face
Rolling down my face
(Hey! Yeah, yeah, hey, hey now)
Tears keep rolling down my face
Rolling down my face
(Oh, they keep rolling)
Tears keep rolling down my face (Ah baby)
Rolling down my face (Ah baby)
They keep rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling (Oh)
They keep rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling (Oh)
They keep rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling
(I don't know what to do)
(They keep asking me, I don't know what to do)
They keep rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling
(I don't know what to do)
They keep rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling
(Don't know what to do)
They keep rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling
(They keep asking me, oh no, ayy)
They keep rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling
(I don't know what to do)
They keep rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling
(I don't know what to do)
