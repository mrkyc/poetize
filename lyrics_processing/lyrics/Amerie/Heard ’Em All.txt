A-Amerie (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
Sing it!
It's Amerie, I took a little time out
Took a vacation but boys, I'm back
Pardon the interruption but we got a news flash
Someone in the buildin' said Amerie's back
Sing it!

But ain't never had nobody put it on me, hey!

Keep doin' what you're doin' 'cause it ain't been done to me

First you gotta be my drummer, don't move fast
You can pop tags on the Louis bags
But it won't get you under my covers
