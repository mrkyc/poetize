Oh yeah
Yeah, mmm

We were never supposed to go this far, for real
And now I see it all so clear
How holding back from you
Just making me want you with me
And now
Now were getting, oh, so close
And wantin' every day a little more
Of each other's touch
What're we waiting for?
See, whenever I lie down to sleep
Thoughts are swimmin' constantly
And I can't deny
The love for you I feel
And whenever I tell you I gotta go
My heart starts to feel the pain
Wondering when will I see you again
I can't pretend
I'm feeling like letting you

Feeling like letting you love me (Love me)
Feel like giving you my heart
Show me all the love that you're feelin'
I'll show you all the love that I'm feelin' (Give me your love)
The love that I'm feelin'
Feeling like letting you love me
Feel like giving you my heart (Yeah, yeah)
Show me all the love that you're feelin'
I'll show you all the love that I'm feelin'
The love that I'm feeling, love

I'm tryna think of one good reason for me to stay away
Thinking of the times I spend with you on my mind
It's so hard to be afraid
And whenever I tell you I gotta go
My heart starts to feel the pain, oh
And I wonder when will I
I need to see you again, yeah

Feeling like letting you love me (Oh)
