C'mon, I can feel it now

I said, hey, I know it's been a minute
Since it's been good, baby, I ain't lyin'
You know a lil' somethin' missin'
Let me give you a piece of my mind

Maybe I need a little attention
Maybe I need a little more time
Maybe I need a little affection
Baby, I need you to just tell me

I'm gonna make you love me
I'm gonna make you love me
I'm gonna give you what you never had
'Til you're always thinkin' of me
I'm gonna make you love me
I'm gonna make you love me
I got what you need and you gon' see
Baby, I'm gonna make you love me
So just tell me you love me
You might also like
I know I ain't the one to play
But I'ma tell you my love don't come cheap
You act like you don't want it
But I'll make you, I'ma make you see

Maybe I need a little attention
Maybe I need a little more time
Maybe I need a little affection
Baby, I need you to just tell me

I'm gonna make you love me
I'm gonna make you love me
I'm gonna give you what you never had
'Til you're always thinkin' of me
I'm gonna make you love me
I'm gonna make you love me
I got what you need and you gon' see
Baby, I'm gonna make you love me
So just tell me you love me
Tell me you love me
Tell me you love me
Just tell me you love me
Ladies, if you love him and your lovin' so good
But he don't love you like you know he should
Say hey, hey, hey, hey, say hey, hey, hey, hey
Though he ain't tryin' to hear nothin' you say
But you know he'll love at the end of the day
Say hey, hey, hey, hey, say hey, hey, hey, hey
