Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh (I can't help it, it's just something)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh (It's just, I don't know)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh (This thing)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh (I don't wanna fight it)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Uh
(Yeah, uh-huh, uh-huh)
Rich crap
(Whassup?)

Yo, you was the last dude, I thought I'd be attached to
Caught me off guard, started feelin' on my tattoo (Oh)
Blow my back, then you would spit in my ear
I don't want to scare you, but I think that we should disappear
Hold up homie, we ain't known each other very long
Now you trying to lock me in the room, tryin' to turn me on
Any other time, I could resist, now my will is gone
Getting weak, that ain't E-V-E, hell, is going on (Woo!)
You might also like
Oh, been trying to let it go
Trying to keep my eyes closed
Trying to keep it just like before
The times we never even thought to speak
Don't wanna tell you what it is
Ooh-wee, it felt so serious
Got me thinking just too much
I wanna set it off, but

It's this one thing that got me trippin'
It's this one thing that got me trippin' (You did)
This one thing, your soul made me feelin'
It's this one thing you did, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
It's this one thing that caught me slippin'
It's this one thing, I want to admit it (You did)
This one thing and I was so with it
It's this one thing you did, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Hey, we don't know each other well
So why I keep picking up my cell?
Memories just keep ringing bells
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Hear voices I don't want to understand
My car keys are jingling in my hand
My high heels are clicking towards your door
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
It's this one thing that got me trippin' (Ooh)
It's this one thing that got me trippin' (You did)
This one thing, your soul made me feelin' (Yeah)
It's this one thing you did, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
It's this one thing that caught me slippin' (Oh-oh)
It's this one thing, I want to admit it (You did) (Oh, oh)
This one thing and I was so with it (Yeah)
It's this one thing you did, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

And maybe I just can't believe it
It's this one thing you did, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I can't deny, tired of trying
Nothing left to do but to keep on seeing you
I'm hoping you can keep a secret
For me, for me, for me
But what you did, yeah

It's this one thing that got me trippin'
It's this one thing that got me trippin' (You did) (Oh, no)
This one thing, your soul made me feelin' (Oh)
It's this one thing you did, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
It's this one thing that caught me slippin' (Caught me slippin')
It's this one thing, I want to admit it (You did) (No)
This one thing and I was so with it (Hey)
It's this one thing you did, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh (I can't help it, it's just something)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh (It's just, I don't know)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh (This thing)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh (I don't wanna fight it)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Na-na-na-na-na, oh

Yeah, uh-huh
Slipped up, let you in my space, got a chick stuck
Close my eyes, see your face, that's a bit much
I ain't the type to get strung all out
Now when I sit and dial your number, got my tongue all out
Wouldn't never tell you though, emotions I would never show
Gotta keep it to myself, gotta keep it low
You got me trippin', who you thought it would be? (Oh-ooh)
Keep it knockin' with E-V-E and Amerie, c'mon (Don't know what it is, hey)

It's this one thing that got me trippin'
It's this one thing that got me trippin' (You did)
This one thing, your soul made me feelin'
It's this one thing you did, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
It's this one thing that caught me slippin' (Oh)
It's this one thing, I want to admit it (You did)
This one thing and I was so with it (Hey, hey)
It's this one thing you did, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

It's this one thing that got me trippin' (This just one thing you did)
It's this one thing that got me trippin' (You did) (Hey, no)
This one thing, your soul made me feelin'
It's this one thing you did, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (Uh, oh, oh, oh)
It's this one thing that caught me slippin'
It's this one thing, I want to admit it (You did)
This one thing and I was so with it
It's this one thing you did, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
