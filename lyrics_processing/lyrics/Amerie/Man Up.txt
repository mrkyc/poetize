Nas, Amerie, get 'em, little sis
It's over, it's over, it's over

What the hell do you want from me
Why don't you leave me alone
Its been a done deal with you for a minute
So you need to get along
What's the problem?
Why is it so difficult for you to see
That I don't want you no more?
If I was you I'd be embarrassed
For the way you carry on

You's a grown ass man, dawg
You can't even stand on your own two feet
Now you're lookin' my way
It's too late 'cause you messed it up with me
You needa change your tone
Get your swagger goin', you gotta hold your own
So don't call my phone
'Cause you ain't gotta home with me no more

Get it out your head, baby
It's over, yes, it's the end (It's the end)
No matter what you try to do
We will never be again
I try to be patient but I can't take it
Get a hold of yourself (Get a hold of yourself)
It will never be you again
Understand it'll be someone else
You might also like
You's a grown ass man, dawg
You can't even stand on your own two feet
Now you're lookin' my way
It's too late 'cause you messed it up with me
You needa change your tone
Get your swagger goin', you gotta hold your own
So don't call my phone
'Cause you ain't gotta home with me no more

This is the last time for this conversation
(Can't do it)
Your excuses are so amazing
(Get through it)
I know you're trying to change my mind
But you know you're only wasting my time
Why do we got to go through this?
I'm sick of the B.S., I'm done
So you'll never get this again

Ayo, Ame-Ame-Amerie, ain't no need for anger
He a lil' boy, just give him the middle finger
Call your big brother, fifth slugger, wig plugger
He gonna get enough for dialin' up your number
Coward, this homie got a twat pushed outward
Chicks with dicks don't belong in your mix
Long as you straight, layin' back in the quarter Apes
Steppin' in zeppies, reppin' D.C., your state
NYC my place, Nas relate, fly estates
Fine wines and diamonds, crembole on the plate
And y'all girls relate so put your hands up
And what, tell that mu'fucka to man up
You's a grown ass man, dawg
You can't even stand on your own two feet
(Hey, stand on your own two)
Now you're lookin' my way
It's too late 'cause you messed it up with me
(Now it's just too late)
You needa change your tone
Get your swagger goin', you gotta hold your own
So don't call my phone
'Cause you ain't gotta home with me no more
(Just leave me alone)
You's a grown ass man, dawg
You can't even stand on your own two feet
(No matter what you do)
Now you're lookin' my way
It's too late 'cause you messed it up with me
(I won't be with you)
You needa change your tone
Get your swagger goin', you gotta hold your own
(Keep it movin')
So don't call my phone
'Cause you ain't gotta home with me no more
(No no no)
