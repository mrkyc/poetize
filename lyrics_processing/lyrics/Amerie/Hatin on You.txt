When I, oh
When I, oh
When I
Oh, yeah

Oh, it's been on my mind, on my mind
It's just a matter of time, 'cause, uh
No matter how hard
How hard I try to hide
I still be wanting you
Inside, inside my arms
And even if you said you would leave
'Cause I ain't ready, ready
Would just give me the need
Whatever meanings to me
And my heart would belong to you
Before I would even know
Damned if you stay
Damned if you don't
'Cause, baby I

Oh oh (Yeah)
I'll be hatin' on you
Hatin', hatin' on you, you, you
Every time it feels so right
All the things that you do, do, do (Oh)
I'll be hatin' on you, hatin'
Hatin' on you, you, you, you
Hating on you, oh, you, you, you
Hatin' on you
You might also like
And I
I don't wanna believe
That we could live the life I'm dreaming of
'Cause I don't wanna be in love
So I'm fightin' all the tenderness
And the moment that I can't forget
Ooh, it's irrelevant
'Cause it's just a matter of time
So baby I

Ooh ooh (Oh, oh)
I'll be hatin' on you
Hatin', hatin' on you (On you, ah ah), you, you
Every time it feels so right
All the things that you do, do, do
(Every little thing that you do)
I'll be hatin' on you, hatin'
Hatin' on you, you, you, you (Yeah, you, you)
Hatin' on you, oh, you, you, you
Hatin' on you (Oh)

I be hatin' on you
I can't get away from you
I can't get away
Every little thing that you do
Every little thing that you do
You make me wanna be so close so you
Hating on you (Oh, oh)
Hating on you (Yeah yeah)
Why do I feel this way?
Why do I feel this way?
It's more than I can take
It's more than I can take
But I ain't ready for this love
No, no
But you're all I'm thinking of
And I
I'm just tryna live, live every day
Like everything's so cool
But I ain't a fool
'Cause it really don't take too much
One look, one touch
And baby I'm through, I'm through
I'm hating on you

Ooh ooh, I'll be hatin' on you (Yeah yeah)
Hatin', hatin' on you, you, you (Oh)
Every time it feels so right (You make me)
All the things that you do, do, do (You make me)
I'll be hatin' on you, hatin'
Hatin' on you, you, you, you
Hating on you, oh, you, you, you (I be hating on you)
Hatin' on you
Ooh ooh, I'll be hatin' on you
Hatin', hatin' on you, you, you
Every time it feels so right
All the things that you do, do, do
I'll be hatin' on you, hatin'
Hatin' on you, you, you, you
Hatin' on you, oh, you, you, you
Hatin' on you
Ooh ooh, I'll be hatin' on you
Hatin', hatin' on you, you, you
Every time it feels so right
All the things that you do, do, do
I'll be hatin' on you, hatin'
Hatin' on you, you, you, you
Hatin' on you, oh, you, you, you
