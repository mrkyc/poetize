Why can't you
Just tell the truth (Why?)
Why is it
So hard for you?
Tell me what you think
When you mess around
Do you see my face
(Do you see me?)
When she's goin' down?

If you really knew (Really knew)
What I know about you
You'd be surprised
Couldn't look me in my eyes (Hey)
Sittin' home alone
Waitin' by the phone
Oh no, not me
You're not the only one creepin'
You might also like
You're not the only one
(Ha, ha, ha, ha)
Don't know why I'm messin' wit'cha
(Ha, ha, ha, ha)
That's why I do the things you do
(Ha, ha, ha, ha)
But I can't help it, I love ya
(Ha, ha, ha, ha)
I don't know why I'm messin' with you

Why can't you
Look me in my face (Why?)
Why can't you say
That you been at her place?
You hurry wash your clothes
The scent of her perfume
I already know
(I know what you're doin')
'Cause I do it too

If you really knew (Oh)
What I know about you
You'd be surprised
Couldn't look me in my eyes
Sittin' home alone
Waitin' by the phone
Oh no, not me
You're not the only one creepin'
You're not the only one
(Ha, ha, ha, ha)
Don't know why I'm messin' wit'cha
(Ha, ha, ha, ha)
That's why I do the things you do (You do)
(Ha, ha, ha, ha)
But I can't help it, I love ya
(Ha, ha, ha, ha)
I don't know why I'm messin' with you
(Still I do it to you)

You

You say that you love me
But you're lyin' to me

You know that I love you
But you're sharing me, too

Don't know why I'm messin' wit'cha

That's why I do the things you do
(Ha, ha, ha, ha)
But I can't help it, I love ya
