Let me just clarify
Pretending my heart ain't breaks
And as soon as you and I separated
Tonight is just my time to get it
Gonna ride it, drive until the flames get low
The moonlight across my, my lips taste so good at
Flashing lights, color this burning
My body can't hide, my hips just realized

Oh, oh, peoples of gold, flicker all over
The building explodes, passing us closer
(We not falling uh)
(Going 'til early morning we not falling uh)
We're not falling
(Going 'til early morning we not falling uh)
Uh!
(Going 'til early morning we not falling uh)
No, no

Let me just clarify
Feel my whole body bouncing, shouting
Pronouncing every word slow
The car is my  affliction
Gonna ride it, drive until the flames get low
Hold back 'til all my rating birthed on, tonight
With every drop I sip from this glass
So what's up with that rave
Feeling, see how long we last

Oh, oh, peoples of gold, flicker all over
The building explodes, passing us closer

We're not falling
