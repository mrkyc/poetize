Look, you don't have to take this
You can come with me
Na-na-na, na-na-na, oh, yeah
Na-na-na, na-na-na-na, ooh, ha

So hard to believe she left you alone all alone
I know, babe, you can come with me, though
So hard to be strong 'cause she left you alone, all alone
I know, babe, you can come with me, though (I know)
I know you're alone, you can come with me, though (I know)
I know you feel pain, you can come with me, though (I know)
I know you feel hurt, you can come with me, though (I know)
It wouldn't be the same if you come with me, though

I just couldn't believe, believe it, babe
That she would go and treat you that way
Especially after all the craziness you took
It just ain't necessary
I can feel the tears that you cry at night
'Cause I know what love supposed to be like
Every little kiss and hug that she put aside
Baby, if you want to I can make it right
You might also like
So hard to believe she left you alone, all alone
I know, babe, you can come with me, though
(You can come with me)
So hard to be strong 'cause she left you alone, all alone
I know, babe, you can come with me, though (I know)
I know you're alone, you can come with me, though (I know)
I know you feel pain, you can come with me, though (I know)
I know you feel hurt, you can come with me, though (I know)
It wouldn't be the same if you come with me, though

Na-na-na, na-na-na
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, huh

Never could ever find the words to tell you, babe
How I felt so deep inside
Didn't wanna be too bold, didn't want to hate on your girl but now I
Can let you know it's wrong what you're going through
You deserve the same love I see in you
Give it back a hundred fold, baby, I would do
Show you love you've never seen, you never knew
So hard to believe she left you alone, all alone
(It's so hard)
I know, babe, you can come with me, though
So hard to be strong 'cause she left you alone, all alone
I know, babe, you can come with me, though (I know)
I know you're alone, you can come with me, though (I know)
I know you feel pain, you can come with me, though (I know)
I know you feel hurt, you can come with me, though (I know)
It wouldn't be the same if you come with me, though
(How does she do you the way)

It won't be the same if you come with me
If you come with me, if you come with me, if you come with me
You won't feel no pain
If you come with me
(I wouldn't leave you all alone, babe)
If you come with me, if you come with me, if you come with me

So hard to believe she left you alone, all alone
I know, babe, you can come with me, though
So hard to be strong 'cause she left you alone, all alone
I know, babe, you can come with me, though (I know)
I know you're alone, you can come with me, though (I know)
I know you feel pain, you can come with me, though (I know)
I know you feel hurt, you can come with me, though (I know)
It wouldn't be the same if you come with me, though (Oh yeah)
So hard to believe she left you alone, all alone
I know, babe, you can come with me, though
So hard to be strong 'cause she left you alone, all alone
I know, babe, you can come with me, though (I know)
I know you're alone, you can come with me, though (I know)
I know you feel pain, you can come with me, though (I know)
I know you feel hurt, you can come with me, though (I know)
It wouldn't be the same if you come with me, though (Yeah, yeah)
So hard to believe she left you alone, all alone
I know, babe, you can come with me, though (Ah baby)
So hard to be strong 'cause she left you alone, all alone (Ooh baby, yeah, yeah)
I know, babe, you can come with me, though (I know)
(Said I couldn't believe it)
I know you're alone, you can come with me, though (I know)
(Said I can't believe it, babe)
I know you feel pain, you can come with me, though (I know)
I know you feel hurt, you can come with me, though (I know)
