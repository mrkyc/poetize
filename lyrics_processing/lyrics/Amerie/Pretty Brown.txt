Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, whoa
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, whoa

Is it a crime to want that old thing back?
Can it be wrong to miss the way you used to kiss me?
(Back) Back in the day
(Back) Back to the way you used to love me (You used to love me)
Now you've got me ready to break the law again
'Cause I made a vow to rock with you 'til the end
So, tell me why lately you ain't been the same?
'Cause I remember when you said

Right from the door, said, "can we talk?"
You had me caught, got to admit it love
Let's cut straight to the point
You know with me is where you belong
Now here we are, how did we grow so much apart?
So far from the start
Let's cut straight to the point
Baby, you know with me is where you belong

Pretty brown eyes, you know, I need you
That's why I keep holding on, I can't let go
I hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
I keep holding on after all your rejection
'Cause I don't wanna let go, but you should know
I'll move on, I'll move on, I'll move on
Pretty brown eyes

So let's go, let me know
You know where you belong
What's the hold?
Baby, you know with me is where you belong (Where you belong)
It's like one minute you're warm
And then the next you're so cold

What can I do to make it feel better? (Better)
And what about the feeling that there's someone on the side? (No)
