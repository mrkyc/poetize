I can't explain it (Whoa)
The way you make me feel (Waiting)
The way you hold me (Oh)
The way you kiss me (Yeah)
(Yeah, whoa, yeah, whoa)

Why?
Why did I even dial your line?
Quietly I smile at your sweet reply
And as my eyes close
The ground beneath disappears
And all over again I feel a love
I know is real, so real

So high I can't look below
When you say my name, there's no control
And I start to float
Ooh, I float
And I never want this feeling to go
I touch the sky and realize
One look in your eyes, I float

And I'm wonderin' if maybe you feel the same
Or am I all alone?
'Cause I'll pay almost any price
For the way you bring my heart to life, no lie
I'm flying, I'm flying, I'm flying
Finally could it be the one (Finally)
Specially made for me (Specially made for me, yeah oh)
You see, there's no one else
Who makes me feel the way you do
And I'm just ready (Ready)
Ready and waiting (Waiting)
Waiting for you
You might also like
So high I can't look below
When you say my name, there's no control
(Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)
And I start to float
Ooh, I float (Oh)
And I never want this feeling to go
(Oh no, I never felt this way before)
I touch the sky and realize (Yeah yeah)
One look in your eyes (Don't leave me, baby, no no no no no no no)
I float
So high I can't look below (Yeah)
When you say my name, there's no control (Oh)
And I start to float
Ooh, I float (And everything you do)
And I never want this feeling to go
I touch the sky and realize (You make me feel so good hey)
One look in your eyes (Yeah)
I float

Huh huh hey, yeah
Huh hey hey hey
Huh yeah hey, stop
Yeah yeah, come here
Come a little bit closer
Yes, right there
For real
I know you feel the same way
I see the way you look at me
Uh-huh, yeah
Never want this feeling to go away
So high I can't look below
When you say my name, there's no control
And I start to float
Ooh, I float
And I never want this feeling to go (You got me)
I touch the sky and realize (Said you got me where you want me, baby)
One look in your eyes, I float
So high I can't look below (You know I'd do anything for you)
When you say my name, there's no control
And I start to float
Ooh, I float (Just ask me what you want me to do)
And I never want this feeling to go
I touch the sky and realize (And I, and I give, my best to you)
One look in your eyes (Yeah yeah yeah yeah)
I float
So high I can't look below
When you say my name, there's no control
And I start to float
