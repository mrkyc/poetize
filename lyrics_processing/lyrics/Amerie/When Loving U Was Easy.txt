Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh

I can see it in your eyes, you don't love me
And though you tried to hide, hide it from me
I know I can see the truth
So easy to love you in the beginning
And so easy to play the fool, 'cause I was willing
But it's over now

When loving you was easy
When loving you was easy
Tried to make it hard for me
Still I stuck around, I was set on loving you
And no matter what you did, I stuck through it
(No, no no no no no)
When loving you was easy
Why'd you make it harder?
Why'd you make it hard for me?
When I stuck around, wishing that you'd would come around
Oh, you made it easy for me to leave you
(No, no no no no no)

It could have been so easy 'cause my heart was easy to give ya
Like second nature, lovin' you was systematic, like I was an addict
It hurt me but I couldn't get enough
It's like you hated me around, but when I left you couldn't stand it
And you needed me around
But I can't take the ups and downs
It's one thing that I found
I gotta get over you, oh yeah

When loving you was easy
When loving you was easy
Tried to make it hard for me
When I stuck around, hopin' that you'd come around
And no matter what you did, I stuck through it
(No, no no no no no)
When loving you was easy
So why'd you make it harder?
Why'd you make it hard for me?
When I stuck around, wishing that you'd come around
'Cause now you made it easy for me to leave you
(No, no no no no no)

I gave you everything I had
Didn't ask you for anything that I didn't give you myself (Hey!)
If you didn't want to say (Hey!)
That was all you had to say (Oh!)
'Cause although I used to love you (Love you)
And need you (Need you)
You knew that I knew we couldn't last for long
And I didn't mean to bring the choir to let you know you were wrong
When loving you was easy
When loving you was easy
Ya tried to make it hard for me
When I stuck around, hopin' that you'd come around
And no matter what you did, I stuck through it all
(No, no no no no no)
When loving you was easy
Why'd you make it harder?
Why'd you make it hard for me?
And I stuck around, wishing that you'd come around (But I'm tired now, and that's why I'm leavin' you)
(No, no no no no no)

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (I'm leavin' you)
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (I'm leavin' you)
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh (Woo!)
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
