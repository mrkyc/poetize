I've given up on love
But I gave up on the chance
That I'd ever fall
Head over heels, yeah
And all the stars
I wished upon
I never thought
That one would fall down on me
Ooh, it's good to know

There's somebody, somebody who feels like me
(Ooh, it's good to know)
There's somebody, somebody who loves like me
(I waited all my life)
For somebody, for somebody who can do it like me
(And ooh, it's good to know)
Found somebody, found somebody who's just like me
Somebody who's just like me

Now here we are
And I wanna make the most of it
Wanna hold you and get close to it
Baby, let me love you, don't let go
And promise that you won't forget
I want you for myself
Better know I'm not gonna share
I wanna feel you deep inside of me
I'm so happy that you came to me
And ooh, I can't believe
You might also like
There's somebody, somebody who feels like me
(Whoa, that there's somebody who can do it like me)
There's somebody, somebody who loves like me
(I've been waiting all of my life)
For somebody, for somebody who can do it like me
(Who can do it like me)
Found somebody, found somebody who's just like me
Somebody who's just like me

Every time I look into your eyes
(When I look in your eyes I)
I just think of
How you changed my life
Every kiss (Kiss), every touch (Touch)
Even scent of you all over me when you leave
(When you leave, I can't sleep)
'Til you're back in my arms
(And I need you)
Can't you see before you, babe, I wasn't living
But now

There's somebody,somebody who feels like Me
(There's somebody like me)
There's somebody, somebody who loves like me
(Said you know, didn't know somebody)
For somebody, for somebody who can do it like me
(Waited all my life)
Found somebody, found somebody who's just like me
Somebody who's just like me
There's somebody, somebody who feels like me
There's somebody, somebody who loves like me
For somebody, for somebody who can do it like me
Found somebody, found somebody who's just like me
