Why are you the one?
I can't lose

What's the reason that I'm here again? It's crazy
I keep waitin' but I'm foolish 'cause you'll never change
Wasted all my time and here I am still cryin' over you
Over you

Hey, loving you was so hard, but I keep tryin', baby
I just end of with scars, 'cause I keep fightin', baby
Loving you is like a battle that I can't afford to lose, I can't lose
But I'm asking you

Why are you the only thing that I care about?
Why are you the only thing that I care about?
Why are you the only thing I think about? (Think about)
Why are you the only one?
(Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh) Baby, you're no good for me, no
You can be, you can be, you can, you can be the only one
You can be, you can be, you can, you can be the only one

And though I hate it, hate it that I can't forget you
I try my best but I'm a mess 'cause I can't shake you
Wanna call you but my pride won't let it get the best of me
The best of me, no

Loving you was so hard, but I keep tryin', baby
I just end up with scars, 'cause I keep fightin', baby
Loving you is like a battle that I can't afford to lose, I can't lose
But I'm asking you

Why are you the only thing that I care about?
Why are you the only thing that I care about?
Why are you the only thing I think about? (Hey!)
Why are you the only one?
(Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh) Baby, you're no good for me, no (You're no good)
You can be, you can be, you can, you can be the only one
You can be, you can be, you can, you can be the only one

No, can't believe that I'm still cryin'
And no, it ain't because I ain't been tryin'
Losin' sleep 'cause I can't help but think about the past
And how we didn't last, how we didn't last
(Hey, hey, hey hey, yeah!)

Why are you the only thing that I care about?
Why are you the only thing that I care about? (Why)
Why are you the only thing I think about? (Are you...)
Why are you the only one?
(Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh) Baby, you're no good for me, no (You're no good for me)
You can be, you can be, you can, you can be the only one (Uh)
You can be, you can be, you can, you can be the only one (You're no good)
Why are you the only thing that I care about? (Oh you're not good)
Why are you the only thing that I care about?
Why are you the only thing I think about?
Why are you the only one?
(Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh) Baby, you're no good for me, no (Ooh baby)
You can be, you can be, you can, you can be the only one
