Sometimes it's gonna be days like this
Sometimes it's gonna be rain like this
Sometimes you're gonna feel pain like this
Sometimes you gotta work hard for it
'Cause when you're feeling low
And you can't get no lower
That's when you know you're close
Sometimes you gotta work hard for it

I woke up in the morning
It's another cloudy day but
That never mattered too much to me, hey!
'Cause it's still a new beginning
And I know I got it in me
Had my share of ups and downs
But now I know that I can do anything

Sometimes it's gonna be days like this
Sometimes it's gonna be rain like this
Sometimes you're gonna feel pain like this (Uh, no)
Sometimes you gotta work hard for it (Hey!)
'Cause when you're feeling low (Feeling low)
And you can't get no lower (Oh)
That's when you know you're close (Uh)
Sometimes you gotta work hard for it
You might also like
Uh, give it to me

Some people think I'm aggressive
'Cause I know what I want, but
That never mattered too much to me, hey!
Show me somebody without a goal
I'll show ya somebody with no control
'Cause life's for livin', so go and get it
But when times get rough
Remember nothing's for free

Sometimes it's gonna be days like this
Sometimes it's gonna be rain like this (Sometimes)
Sometimes you're gonna feel pain like this (Oh)
Sometimes you gotta work hard for it (Gotta work, work hard for it)
'Cause when you're feeling low (Feeling low)
And you can't get no lower (Can't get no lower)
That's when you know you're close (Know you're close, yeah)
Sometimes you gotta work hard for it (Hey, hey!)

Oh, I gotta get it
Na na, ah, ah oh
Hey hey hey hey hey!
Sometimes the road may seem too hard
You never really know for sure (Ooh)
If you're ever gonna make it, yeah, yeah
Sometimes the end may seem so far
You never really know for sure
If you've got the strength to make it
But you got to remember

Sometimes it's gonna be days like this (Hey!)
Sometimes it's gonna be rain like this (But you gotta remember)
Sometimes you're gonna feel pain like this
Sometimes you gotta work hard for it (Oh, but you gotta work hard for it)
'Cause when you're feeling low (So hard for it)
And you can't get no lower (Hey!)
That's when you know you're close (Hey!)
Sometimes you gotta work hard for it

Days like this (Days like this)
Rain like this (Rain like this)
Oh oh oh oh oh (Feel pain like this)
Gotta work hard for it
Gotta work hard for it
Hey! Hahaha
