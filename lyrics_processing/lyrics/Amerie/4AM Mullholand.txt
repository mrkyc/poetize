Cruisin' down Mullholand
Lookin' for an answer
To something I don't know yet
Jumped in the car I gotta let it go I
One Eye got me on that
I think I'm catchin' blowback
Nothin' but the night and everything is right now
Late night city all we got is now
It's 4 in the mornin'
I know I'm gettin' started
You asked me where I'm going
I tell you I don't know yet, no
I been tryin' my whole life to make the stars align
Tryin' to make it over but first I gotta touch the sky
Sometimes I wanna be livin' it up, be livin' it up, be livin' it up, livin' it up yeah
I try to forget, try to lose I'd
Livin' it up, drinkin' it up, be servin' it up, be livin' it up yeah
