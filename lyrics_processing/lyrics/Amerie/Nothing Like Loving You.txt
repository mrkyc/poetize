Trying to be
To be so strong
I look into your eyes and say "Hello"
So hopelessly
I wait for your reply
When suddenly you grab me close
And press your lips to mine
You read my mind

Every memory
Every embrace
Every time my lips touch your face
There's nothing like loving you (Nothing like loving you)
There's nothing like loving you (Nothing like loving you)
Every single touch
Forever be on my mind
Cross my heart
Don't know why
There's nothing like loving you
There's nothing like loving you
Loving you

And hopin' I'll be
That I'll be strong
I look into your eyes and say "Goodbye" (Alright then)
And as I step away
The pain's too much
And I turn my face to see your open arms
And I run to you, to you

Every memory (Oh)
Every embrace (Oh yeah)
Every time my lips touch your face (Yeah)
There's nothing like loving you (Nothing like loving you)
There's nothing like loving you (Nothing like loving you)
(Oh no)
Every single touch
Forever be on my mind (My mind)
Cross my heart
Don't know why
There's nothing like loving you (Like loving you)
There's nothing like loving you
Loving you (Oh, oh, oh, woo)

Oh la da da
La da da da da
La da da da da da da da
Oh la oh
Whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa
Every memory

Every embrace
Every time my lips touch your face (yeah)
There's nothing like loving you (Nothing like lovin)
(Nothing like loving you)
There's nothing like loving you (Aye, aye)

Every single touch
Forever be on my mind
Cross my heart
Don't know why (Don't know why)
