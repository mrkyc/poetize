Can I give you my trust?
I'm falling
Can I give you my love?
I'm falling
If I give them to you
I'm falling
Will you know what to do?
I'm falling

Hey, understand I'm not used to letting go
Once in my past, I told myself I'll never lose control
But you're not to blame, so please don't ever change
And forgive me if I, I hesitate

Over and over and over again
I'm scared to lose
Over and over and over again
That's why I'm asking you

Can I give you my trust?
I'm falling
Can I give you my love?
I'm falling
If I give them to you
I'm falling
Will you know what to do?
I'm falling
You might also like
Now I know that you say you'll never do me wrong
And I do believe, right here's where I belong
But I'm scared to move
(I don't know, don't know, don't know)
Said I don't know what to do
(I don't know, don't know, don't know)

Over and over and over again
Hey, see, I'm so scared to lose
Over and over and over again
That's why I'm asking you, babe

Can I give you my trust?
I'm falling
Can I give you my love?
I'm falling
If I give them to you
I'm falling
Will you know what to do?
I'm falling

(Everything that you said) Like how your life has changed
(Everything that you do) You didn't think you had in you
Three years ago, we didn't think this could be true
Now my heart, my love, my everything is you
Can I give you my trust?
I'm falling
Can I give you my love?
I'm falling
If I give them to you
I'm falling
Will you know what to do?
I'm falling
Can I give you my trust?
I'm falling
Can I give you my love?
I'm falling
If I give them to you
I'm falling
Will you know what to do?
I'm falling

I don't know, don't know, don't know
I'm falling
I don't know, don't know
I'm falling
I don't know, don't know, don't know
I'm falling
I don't know, don't know
I'm falling
I don't know, don't know, don't know
I'm falling
I don't know, don't know
I'm falling
I don't know, don't know, don't know
I'm falling
I don't know, don't know
I'm falling
I don't know, don't know, don't know
