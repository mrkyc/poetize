I feel so unsure
Trembling, you open your door
Your eyes glistening
Silly me, I'm already missing you

And this is all I have (All I have)
All I have to give
All I have to give
This one last kiss
I know it's not enough
Thought our love would never end (No)
One more touch
Is all I have
All I have

You said that we'd forever be in love
And you'd show me life like I never knew
Things I never even dreamed of
But your smile just don't seem the same
And when you tell me you feel it too
I'm not sure who's to blame
'Cause I gave everything
You might also like
And this is all I have (All I have)
All I have to give (To give)
All I have to give (To give you)
This one last kiss (This one last kiss)
I know it's not enough (Ooh, Ooh)
Though our love would never end (Yeah, hey)
One more touch (Whoa)
Is all I have
All I have

I can't believe
I can't believe (I can't believe)
This love is leaving me (Yeah)
Love is leaving me (No, no, no)
And I can't believe (I can't believe)
What we've come to be (What we've come to be, baby)
What we've come to be (Whoa)

And I wish I can make it like it used to be
Can't believe I'm through loving you
And Your through loving me, you
And in the middle of my final tears
You call out my name, my name
You cry out my name
But it can never be the same
'Cause this is all I have
And this is all I have (Oh, whoa)
All I have to give
All I have to give
This one last kiss (Your smile don't seem the same)
I know it's not enough (Ooh)
Though our love would never end (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
One more touch (Hey)
Is all I have
All I have (Why you lookin' at me?)
And this is all I have (Why you lookin' at me?)
All I have to give (I don't know)
All I have to give (I don't know who's to blame)
This one last kiss (In this situation baby, hey)
I know it's not enough (Oh)
Though our love would never end (Oh no)
One more touch (No no)
Is all I have
All I have
And this is all I have
All I have to give
All I have to give
This one last kiss (No, no)
I know it's not enough (I know, I know it's not enough)
Though our love would never end
(Thought our love would never end)
One more touch (Never end)
Is all I have
All I have
And this is all I have
All I have to give
All I have to give
This one last kiss (One last kiss)
I know it's not enough (Give me one more chance)
Though our love would never end
One more touch
Is all I have
