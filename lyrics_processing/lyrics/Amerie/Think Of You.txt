I kno the reason is that our love was meant forever
But now my life is shared with someone other than you
But life is worthless if right beside me there is no you
Everday (yea yea yea) alone I think (i think of you) of you your not my man (im with somebody else)
All I want (all I want yea) to kno is can I be (can I be whoa whoa) with you tonight (because baby)
I've never stopped lovin your kissin and huggin
I still think of us when im all alone
Its hard for me to forget wishin your the one that im with
Now im so full of regrets
What do I do when I think of you
Do you remember the day when you first said I love you
I can remember cause through me all my dreams had come true
Now I dont kno why Im with him when love just ain't true
But now I do know why im always wishing that it was you
Everyday alone (whoo whoo whoo) I think of you (think of you)
Your (you) not my man (im with somebody else eh)
All I want (yea) to know (oh oh) is can I be (can I be) with you tonight
(because baby)
I've never stopped lovin your kissin and huggin (your kissin and huggin)
I still think of us when im all alone (i still I still do)
Its hard for me to forget (hard for me) wishin your the one (wishin your the one) that im with
Now im so full of regrets (so what do)
What do I do (what do I do) when I think of you
You might also like(Hoping Hoping Praying) you understand how I love you

Your kissin and huggin (your kissing and your huggin)
I still think of us when Im all alone (I still think of you) (whoa)
