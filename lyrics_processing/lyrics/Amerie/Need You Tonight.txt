I mean
I ain't gon' lie to you
See, you can have me
If you wanna do something

I can't say
I'll always be there for you
And I can't say
That you're the only one
See, all I know
Is whatever I'm feelin' for you
Seems to be so deep
Deep in my soul
And I, and I
Might be a fool to want you, babe
But I ain't gon' lie
It's all about me tonight
Don't wanna think about tomorrow
See, I'm not sure what it is
But the only thing on my mind
Is your kiss
Your kiss, baby, 'cause I

I, I, I need you
Tonight, 'night, tonight
To see you
If its alright, 'right, alright
Just me and you
Need you tonight
Baby, come on
I, I ain't never felt this way
And tomorrow is just too late
Take my hand, baby
Baby, tonight
