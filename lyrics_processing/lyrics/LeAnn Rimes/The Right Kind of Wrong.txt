Know all about, yeah, 'bout your reputation
And now it's bound to be a heartbreak situation
But I can't help it if I'm helpless
Every time that I'm where you are
You walk in and my strength walks out the door
Say my name and I can't fight it anymore
Oh, I know I should go
But I need your touch just too damn much

Loving you, that isn't really something I should do
Shouldn't wanna spend my time with you, yeah
Well, I should try to be strong
But baby, you're the right kind of wrong
Yeah, baby, you're the right kind of wrong

Might be a mistake - a mistake I'm makin'
But what you're givin' I am happy to be takin'
'Cause no one's ever made me feel the way I feel when I'm in
Your arms

They say you're something I should do without
They don't know what goes on when the lights go out
There's no way to explain
All the pleasure is worth all the pain
