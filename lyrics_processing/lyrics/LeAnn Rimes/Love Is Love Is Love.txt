I don't mean to start an argument
Yeah I'm just trying to spark a conversation
Like a love can make a tyrant on ya
Time to open up the floodgate
Eradicate the sanity
My unoriginal epiphany

So let me shout it for the whole world
Oh love is love is love is love is love is love
Let me shout it for the whole world
Love is love is love is love is love
Oh let's start a revolution
Oh love is love is love is love is love

These politics and religion
Every day they're starting wars
And we believe we're not the hateful, no more
When we can dance with the worst of them
When we can sing with our enemies
Then we will know that times are changing
Won't we?

So let me shout it for the whole world
Oh love is love is love is love is love is love
Let me shout it for the whole world
Love is love is love is love is love
Oh let's start a revolution
Oh love is love is love is love is love
