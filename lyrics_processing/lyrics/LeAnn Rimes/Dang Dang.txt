Whatever gets you off on life
Whatever gets you off on life
No judgement wrong or right
Yeah yeah, you made a believer out of me
Come on and lay your hands on me
Come on and lay your hands on me
Praise the Lord in all his might
Oh, you made a believer out of me

Dang dang, you sure like to bang a lot
Dang dang, you sure like to bang, bang
Dang dang, you sure like to bang a lot
Dang dang, a bang bang, a dang dang

Late in the morning
In the early of the night
Ring-a-ting-ting-a-ling
You shake-shook me alright
Licker flickers liqueur's quicker
Effen sweat and starry eyed
Thought I was psycho bad
But you're morphine injectified

Resurrect me from sweet cherry suicide
If that's the way we go, then what a way to die
Coochie hootchie chitchie hitchie wick a lily ding dang dong
I'm flying high with angels, screaming sha-la-kah in tongues
Whatever gets you off on life
