Life goes on
Life goes on
Life goes on

You sucked me in and played my mind
Just like a toy, you would crank and wind
Baby, I would give 'til you wore it out
You left me lyin' in a pool of doubt
And you're still thinkin' you're the Daddy Mac
You shoulda known better, but you didn't and I can't go back

Oh, life goes on
And it's only gonna make me strong
It's a fact, once you get on board
Say goodbye 'cause you can't go back
Oh, it's a fight
And I really wanna get it right
Where I'm at is my life before me
And this feelin' that I can't go back

Life goes on
Life goes on (Got a feelin' that I can't go back)
Life goes on

I shoulda known better, but I didn't and I can't go back

Oh, life goes on
And it's only gonna make me strong
It's a fact, once you get on board
Say goodbye 'cause you can't go back
