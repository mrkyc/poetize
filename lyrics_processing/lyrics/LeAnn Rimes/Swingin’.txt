His name is Charlie Johnson, and he's really looking good
I had to go and see him, so I called him on the phone
I walked over to his house, and this was going on
His brother was on the sofa, eating chocolate pie
His mama was in the kitchen, cutting chicken up to fry
His daddy was in the backyard, rolling up a garden hose
And I was on the porch with Charlie, feeling love down to my toes
And we were swingin'
Aw yeah, now, we were swingin'
Little Charlie, he's as pretty as the angels when they sing
I can't believe I'm out here on his front porch in this swing
Just a-swingin'
Now little Charlie, he's my darling, he's the apple of my eye
And when I'm on the swing with him, it makes me almost high
And Charlie, he's my lover and he has been since the spring
I just can't believe it started on his front porch in this swing
Just a-swingin'
Aw yeah now, baby, swingin'
Oh little Charlie, he's as pretty as the angels when they sing
I can't believe I'm out here on this front porch in this swing
Just a-swingin'
