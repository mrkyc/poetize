Standing on the border
Looking out into the great unknown
I can feel my heart beatin' faster as I step out on my own
There's a new horizon
And the promise of favorable wind
I'm headin' out tonight, travelin' light
I'm gonna start all over again

And buy a one-way ticket on a westbound train
See how far I can go (Because I can)
I'm gonna go out dancin' in the pourin' rain
And talk to someone I don't know (Because I can)
I will face the world around me
Knowing that I'm strong enough to let you go
And I will fall in love again because I can

Gonna climb the mountain
And look the eagle in the eye
I won't let fear clip my wings and tell me how high I can fly
How could I have ever believed
That love had to be so blind?
When freedom was waiting down at the station
All I had to do was make up my mind

See how far I can go (Because I can)

And talk to someone I don't know (Because I can)
I will face the world around me
Knowing that I'm strong enough to let you go
And I will fall in love again because I can

I have walked through the fire and crawled on my knees
Through the valley of the shadow of doubt
Then the truth came shining like a light on me
And now I can see my way out

I'm gonna buy a one-way ticket on a westbound train
See how far I can go (Because I can)
I'm gonna go out dancing in the pourin' rain
And talk to someone I don't know
I'm gonna buy a one-way ticket on a westbound train
Gonna have my breakfast with some pink champagne
I'm gonna sail the ocean, gonna spread my wings
