I was tired of choking
So I took your noose off my neck
I got bored of lying face down
So I wouldn't have to see you
I got sick of crawling
So you could be a big man
I got tired of my balls being cut off
'Cause you didn't have none
You had a good run yeah, didn't ya babe?
Now it's ashes to ashes and dust to dust

So long live love
I ain't ever given up on it
Long live love
Won't be long until I rise up
Long live love
I ain't ever given up on it
Long live love
Won't be long until I rise up
And I'll rise up
So long live love

Love, long live
Love long live, long live, long live
