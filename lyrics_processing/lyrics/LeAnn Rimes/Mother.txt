You know I want the best for you
As you've always wanted for me
You know our eyes may look alike but
They don't see the same things
Hurt made a great divide
I added to the pain
My way to survive was shutting you out
Oh, I was just a child, I no longer recognize
And now I'm seein' you
Maybe the first time

And mother, you did the best you could, the best you can
Yeah, I know you did the best you could, the best you can
Do you know you did the best you could, the best you can?
Forgive me now
Oh, I understand

They say we turn into our parents
I guess we know now what they mean
We may be made of broken pieces
But that's not who we have to be
Your mother's mother taught her only how to love
From an empty fearful broken place
Oh, you were just child, taught to shoulder the blame
But you're a woman now
You can lift your face

Yeah, I know you did the best you could, the best you can
Do you know you did the best you could, the best you can?
Forgive me now
Oh, I understand

Ooh, oh-oh
Ooh, oh-oh

Mother, you did the best you could, the best you can
Yeah, I know you did the best you could, the best you can
Do you know you did the best you could, the best you can?
Mother, mother, mother, mother, mother
You did the best you could, the best you can
Yeah, I know you did the best you could, with what you had
Do you know you did the best you could, the best you can?

Forgive me now
