I wanna dedicate this song, Gone 'Til November, to all you ladies out there, crying all alone in your room
And all you fellas
Going down south
Not making it back
May the Lord bless your soul
I love you girl

Every time I make a run
Girl you turn around and cry
I aks myself, why oh why?
See you must understand
I can't work a nine to five
So I'll be gone 'til November
Said I'll be gone 'til November, I'll be gone 'til November
Yo, tell my girl yo I'll be gone 'til November
I'll be gone 'til November, I'll be gone 'til November
Yo, tell my girl yo I'll be gone 'til November
January, February, March, April, May
I see you crying, but girl I can't stay
I'll be gone 'til November, I'll be gone 'til November
And give a kiss to my mother

Girl I gotta leave, please don't cry
When I come back, you know the limit's the sky
I'll take you out to dinner, to your favorite spot
Feed you an aphrodisiac just to get you hot
Drive-by movies, by a cemetery
If my corpse could talk then I would tell you I was sorry
Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous
Some die with a name, some die nameless
You might also like
Every time I make a run
Girl you turn around and cry
I aks myself, why oh why?
See you must understand
I can't work a nine to five
So I'll be gone 'til November
Said I'll be gone 'til November, I'll be gone 'til November
Yo, tell my girl yo I'll be gone 'til November
I'll be gone 'til November, I'll be gone 'til November
Yo, tell my girl yo I'll be gone 'til November
January, February, March, April, May
I see you crying, but girl I can't stay
I'll be gone 'til November, I'll be gone 'til November
Yo, give a kiss to my mother

We had nothin'
I had to do something
So I'm knocking on heaven's door like I'm Bob Dylan
Ever contemplating, the charges I'm facing
My new-born son, I hope I see his graduation
Take him to the movies, by the cemetery
If my corpse could talk then I would tell him, I was sorry
Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous
Some die with a name, some die nameless
Every time I make a run
Girl you turn around and cry
I aks myself, why oh why?
See you must understand
I can't work a nine to five
So I'll be gone 'til November
Said I'll be gone 'til November, I'll be gone 'til November
Yo, tell my girl yo I'll be gone 'til November
I'll be gone 'til November, I'll be gone 'til November
Yo, tell my girl yo I'll be gone 'til November
January, February, March, April, May
I see you crying, but girl I can't stay
I'll be gone 'til November, I'll be gone 'til November
