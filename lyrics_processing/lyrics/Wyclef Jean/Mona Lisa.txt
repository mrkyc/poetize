Yo Mona Lisa, could I get a date on Friday?
And if you're busy, I wouldn't mind taking Saturday, ayy, ayy
Right about now, if you are in your jeep, please turn up your radio
If you don't have a Jeep, and you have a little hooptie, I still want you to crank up your volume
We want all the ladies to sit back, relax, let your hair out
Wyclef presents The Neville Brothers in the house tonight

I know a girl, she ruled my world
Whatever I need, she supplied
Living in paradise
She ruled my heart, 'til death do us part (Her love was like ecstasy)

At least that's how I thought it would be
(So Neville brothers what you telling me)
At least that how I thought it would be
(One question, what was her name?)
Mona Lisa, you called my name (Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh)
Laid it apart but I did not respond (Mona Lisa)
And you ask me what I'm thinking of
In the morning I'll be gone, no more loving after dawn
No longer can we share the love that was never there
When the moon has lost its light
And the stars are no longer bright, yeah
No longer can we share, the love that was never there
(Ain't no need to cry, girl, it's gonna be alright)
You might also like
Girl, don't you cry (Girl, don't you cry)
Please dry your eyes
All you ever been was faithful in my life, so I apologize (I hope my eyes right about now)
I hope the future brings us back together
At least that's how I thought it would be (Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh)
At least that's how I thought it would be (Yo, Neville Brothers, what was her name?)

Mona Lisa, you called my name (Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh)
Laid it apart but I did not respond (Mona Lisa)
And you ask me what I am thinking of
In the morning I'll be gone, no more loving after dawn (After dawn)
No longer can we share the love that was never there
When the moon has lost its light (Lost its light)
And the stars no longer bright, yeah
No longer can we share, the love that was never there

Right about now if you are in dance, I want you to hold your girl real tight
We got The Neville Brothers in the house tonight, alongside Wyclef
You know how we do
I wanna apologize to you
I never wrote a love song, this one my first one
A love that was never, ever there
Bye-bye, baby
