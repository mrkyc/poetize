I asked my mother, "Why do you cry?"
She said, "Your brother, he just died"
Well, I told him not to go outside
He said he had to fight for his country's rights
But don't you know that mo-mother

Don't you know that we can't stop the violence? No
Because the war is not over
Until you can feel love, peace, and hear silence
But I smell gunpowder (Pow)

My brother's been dead ever since
I didn't believe it, but when I saw him I was convinced
Two shots to the head, he was already dead, Lord
I headed for revenge in the city of Port-au-Prince
Screaming bro-brother

Don't you know that we can't stop the violence? No
Because the war is not over
Until you can feel love, peace, and hear silence
But I smell gunpowder (Pow)

I wanna know why Christians pray for a new day
We don't need no, we don't need no, we don't need no
But it's still the same way
I wanna know why ghetto people pray for a new day, hey, hey, hey
And it's still the same way
But the preacher man told me
Good things come to those who wait
Do good things come to those who wait?
I wanna know, tell me
Good things come to those who wait
Do good things come to those who wait?
We wanna know, we wanna know, we wanna know
Pe-people

Don't you know that we can't stop the violence? No
Because the war is not over
Until you can feel love, peace, and hear silence
But I smell gunpowder (Gunpowder)
