Kiss you love you hold you tight
The way my heart beats for you, mentioning your name
One touch never enough, you're driving me insane
Sweetly, take me back, who am I to blame but myself
Need you in my life, it's simple and plain
Crazy nights, arguments, running towards the door
Lying to myself, not wanting you no more
No matter what we've been through, you're the man that I adore
You're the only one I need in this world
See, people used to tell me I was crazy
Told me not to give in
Told me that you'll never love me
All of it is pretend
I told 'em mind their business
'Cause they're not in my position
When I said that I was in love
They said that I was tripping
I cut the haters off and got into my man
'Cause I take him for all he is
And he takes me as I am
The way I feel about it
It was God's perfect plan
The only one I need, I'm his girl
So let me hear you say
Ever since you came back around the way
I ain't trynna be a player
So many things that I wanna say
You know I got a little wiser
I don't wanna lose your love tonight
I don't wanna lose your love tonight

Come on

L-O-V-E Y-O-U
I ain't tryna lose your love tonight
I just wanna make you feel alright
L-O-V-E Y-O-U
I do hope you can stay the night
Kiss you, love you, hold you tight
