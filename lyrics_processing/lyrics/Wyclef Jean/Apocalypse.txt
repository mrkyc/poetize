Yeah, I was looking out my window, man
When I heard the sirens
Looked up into the sky
Saw the moon turn to blood
Looked at my little brother
Said, "You high as hell, man"

Apocalypse
One, two, the headline news just broke through
Apocalypse
Three, four, soldier, a hundred horsemen at your door
Apocalypse
Five, six, you wanted dead or alive, hit or miss
Oui, oui, y'all (Oui), oui, oui, y'all (Oui)
Oui, oui, y'all (Oui), oui, oui, y'all (Oui)

Arrival of the carnival, new beats, I never recycle
While you're looking for samples, you might get trampled
Surprise, hey, I'm back with lightning and thunder
I heard you over saying I'm a one-hit wonder
You dumb or somethin'? Went to refugees 'til infinity
When I'm done, collect royalty from record companies
Clouds getting darker, sun's getting nearer
I'll turn an atheist to a God-fearing believer
The back of a building, your body's found by children
Playin' hide go seek, what we found was your skeleton
In the back of a car, you sparred with the wrong guard
You know my empire strikes back hard
Missiles launch, "War!" it's the day after ashes
Project cannons being launched at the palace
Vision, revelation, sky rode apocalypse
Enemy pilots kamikaze into the abyss

Back on earth the party's at the tunnel
On the west side of the river with mad quiver
Rats get fed to the alligator
Gun blast equivalent to the bombs in Pearl Harbor
Rescue choppers, Brooklyn turned to Hiroshima
I'm driving to Jersey to escape the terror
I was on the highway pushing a black Viper
A car pulls up, is he a jacker or a sniper? (Sniper)
A blue Range Rover, he says, "Pull over!"
I didn't know he was a DT undercover
I screamed out my lungs, "This is discrimination!
What's the charge?" He said, "You just robbed a gas station"
"Who me? Not me, It couldn't be
I was at the Grammys with Brandy, didn't you see me on TV?"
"Bullshit, y'all all in the same gang!"
He tried to run me off the road like he was Rosco P. Coltrane
I stayed calm, gave him a hell of a show
'Cause if it's ever time to go, all I gotta press is turbo
Heard him on his walkie, road block on 280 West
Things got serious, that's when I bust a left
U-Turn, my tires burned, my concern was a truck coming
Head-on collision within a second changed position
Close one, I almost went up in a blaze
Running from what appeared to be a masquerade
At least that's what I thought, it was all in my mind
Reality stuck when I got to the borderline
The headline reads every ghetto sad story
A rookie shoots a boy over mistaken identity (Crash)
Apocalypse
Oui, oui, y'all (Oui), oui, oui, y'all (Oui)
Oui, oui, y'all (Oui), oui, oui, y'all (Oui)
Apocalypse

The Carnival, nobody's protected, anything can happen
