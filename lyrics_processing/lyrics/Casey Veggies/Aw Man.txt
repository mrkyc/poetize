I'm just tryna find the perfect wave
To say, you know what I'm sayin'?
To you

You know and I know that I don't know where to begin
All these things we been through, I can't pretend
You always on my mind, me and you are much more than friends
I'm addicted to it, I don't ever want it to end
Young black boy with a bunch of stamps on my passport
I had a dream and I took that, I ain't ask for it
I prayed about it, I hit my knees and I asked Lord
Live inside the dirt, put us over in the grass more
I'm lyrical and spiritual, I live and grow
Got so big that now you just tryna let me go
Shit was all good just a week ago
Then you sent me that nine page letter
Like I don't think we should speak no more

Aw, aw, man
Aw, aw, man
Aw, aw, man
Aw, aw, man
You might also like
Got me thinkin' like what I choose is bad for me
She playin' games, think I ain't tryna slow down for her
I prayed on it, I hit my knees and I asked Lord
He responded to me, he like, "Ain't this what you asked for?"
Like, aw, man, like, "Ain't this what you asked for?"
She left me, she came back, I don't need nobody to feel bad for me
I packed my bags like what I'm doin' in class for?
I'm livin' fast like, "Ain't this what you asked for?"

From the belly of the beast but I made it to a beach all the way in the middle in the ocean
Not a person in sight, it's the middle of the night and your body just start floatin'
I understand that you're outspoken
But some things you gotta let soak in
She from the hood but she hang in a different world
She got all types in her, that's my type of girl
She a freak in the sheets but a lady in the streets
Baby, you could have a baby in the lease
She pull up in sea that's detailed, they can tell that's Veggies' lady in the streets
Spent like eighty on a Jeep, she like minks so I buy her that Chanel
She told me that she wanna do her hair and nails
I told her that ain't nothin' and I yelled
I'm that nigga, I'm that nigga
He ain't it, girl, you might as well go pop that nigga
What's a queen with no king? You messin' with a pawn ass nigga
Checkmate, I'm bossed up, I'll sign that nigga
Aw, aw, man
Aw, aw, man
Aw, aw, man
Aw, aw, man

Got me thinkin' like what I choose is bad for me
She playin' games, think I ain't tryna slow down for her
I prayed on it, I hit my knees and I asked Lord
He responded to me, he like, "Ain't this what you asked for?"
Like, aw, man, like, "Ain't this what you asked for?"
She left me, she came back, I don't need nobody to feel bad for me
I packed my bags like what I'm doin' in class for?
I'm livin' fast like, "Ain't this what you asked for?"

At times like this, I don't know where to begin
This shit so real, there's no way I can pretend
You said you would hold me down until the end
I love life but they say the end is near (It's too late)
The preacher asked me like what you choose this path for
No demons formed against me shall prosper
She yellin' at me, I'm like, "What you gettin' mad for?"
Bad shit tryna outweigh all the good things glad for
I'm in H-Town, D.C, first class course
I'm swagged up, Lil B, Task Force
We dunkin' on 'em, no we ain't touchin' no backboard
I wasn't gettin' to know her, I was gettin' to know this cash more
Aw, aw, man
Aw, aw, man
Aw, aw, man
