Customized Greatly
And we customized greatly
Yeah, and they customized greatly
Now everybody customized greatly
Feel good to be back man
Feel real good to be back
I'mma start if off like this

I'm leaving school early, I got a stack to make
In school don't teach me no swag so I guess that can wait
To chase the dream, you know how long that can take
But you better off being quiet if that's all you gon' say
Look it in the eyes, sometimes you gotta realize
The way you feel tries to stop you from your real grind
I know niggas who would die for a real mind
But I got it, so it's that "let's go and make a mil" time
Life changing, rearranging, different stages
Different stages in different cities, man, shit is crazy
Who would have thought I'd come and kill it, promoter paid me
Come back home, they run into him like "That's the same Casey!"
A grown man, them same problems don't remain to phase me
Still shining, still growing, still Customized Greatly
On the grind, they wasn't knowing now they gotta face it
Girl, you still on my mind and I ain't trying to erase it
Face my problems like a scholar reading through some pages
Speaking to God, swear I'm working on my patience
What's having a bunch of fans when you my favorite?
But I got a bunch of plans, I'm running to the pavement
The streets of L.A. where I lay my pavement
Words spread so fast, a nigga out in Asia
Yeah, be discreet with your wishes, you'll probably get 'em all
The future is odd, I think it's time to kill them all
As-salamu alaykum to all the flakers and the constant haters
Who contradict themselves, and in person take the time to face us
To all the pretty girls who would probably take the time to date us
Attitude like a possum but her face like 
This the definition of Customized Greatly
All intertwined in these rhymes is all the shit that made me
Shout out to my pops, kept me from going crazy
Without that don't know where I would be this where I'm goin lately
This that ill shit, yeah you like that real shit
That 18 out of high school on tour without a deal shit
That girl frontin' but swear imma make her feel this
And if not then then I hit the kill switch, nigga I'm on
