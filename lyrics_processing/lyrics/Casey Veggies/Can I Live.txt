Yeah, yeah
Yo

The kid ridin' no insurance like whatever though
Say you got a bad chick, mines look better though
Got her on lock, but I swear we ain't together though
She's just gonna ride with a nigga 'til I let her go
Rappin' what I'm livin', man, the shit I spit is medical
Soothin' to the mind like Cali green, that's medical
Young boy flyer than that time I ate a edible
Keep goin' up like a kite when you let it go
I be on some new shit, new chick from Mexico
Tryin' to have kids, I told her I wasn't ready though
Yeah, they ain't know me like shawty know
Me, Anwar and Joshton, they ain't no better than Shawty Lo
You niggas be playin' so I had to hit the audible
Touchdown pass, sold crack, goin' Roddy though
Rockin' that shit, got me lookin' like a pot of gold
Hit the jackpot, now we poppin', it's the party ho

I just want it all, so I can have enough to give
No more worryin' at all, baby, I just wanna live
We can go to the mall, then we back to the crib
Then you can tell your friends that you relaxed with the kid
(Lay back, get it big, can I live?)

Live flyer than I've ever been, you just mad you never been
Bitches at the tele gettin' freaky like they lesbian
And they noticed everything I kick incredible
Mac Miller here with the homie Mr. Vegetables
Most Dope general, I know you see us on tour
Do a thirty minute set, the people want more
And that's an encore
The show run late
Bitches give me head tryin' to find out how my cum taste
I ain't talkin' about the jeweler, sayin', "Fuck Jake"
IPhone on me for my SportsCenter updates (Updates)
Oh, the Steelers won again
And groupies rollin' through, I tell 'em, "Bring a hundred friends"
It's good, we out in Cali, and Casey, that's my homie
We cooler than Moe Dee, it's easy macaroni
Shawty wanna ride that pony, tell her, "Give me brain, no teeth"
Boy, we party all night and we don't sleep

I just want it all, so I can have enough to give
No more worryin' at all, baby, I just wanna live
We can go to the mall, then we back to the crib
Then you can tell your friends that you relaxed with the kid
(Lay back, get it big, can I live?)
He ain't got up his endurance 'bout his cheddar though
Got the chick in her bare ass, uh, Plaxico
Rappers off that cheap gas, got that shit from Texaco
Rappin' 'til you thirty, don't really know how to let it go
Yeah, my father had to let me know
Everything he did were situations to help me grow
As a young kid, little shit make you miserable
Now I'm grown up, told that man that I'm about to blow
Once I get goin', there's no stoppin'
They roarin', we show-stoppin'
They wasn't even aware that my flow proper, but it is for sure
Once you make up your mind, man, you can get the dough
Just split up your time and clock in, you'll grow
I talk about upliftin' shit, plus all the chicks I hit
Plus the one girl I love, she know exactly who she is
Sincerely, rap's hope, hope you're hearin' me
My future's so bright that it's scarin' me

I just want it all, so I can have enough to give
No more worryin' at all, baby, I just wanna live
We can go to the mall, then we back to the crib
Then you can tell your friends (Yes), that you relaxed with the kid
(Lay back, get it big, can I live?)

Aw man
Yeah, yeah, aw man
Uh-uh, uh, uh
