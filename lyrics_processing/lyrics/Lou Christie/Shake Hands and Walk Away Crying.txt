Ain't a girl alive with the suffering I feel inside
Mine's not a peppering fool
And when you go with me, you play by my rules
If that's the way she wants to play, then I'll forget her
She's thinking how she'll beat me to the punch but I won't let her
Shake hands and walk away
(And look at him crying)
Come on, come on, come on, come on
I'm gonna shake hands and walk away
(And look at him crying)
Come on, come on, come on, come on now
I'll never say to you, breaking up is hard to do
'Cause I've got my pride, a big man never cries
There's much of life in you and you'd better run too
Knowing it's our last goodbye, it's hard to face you
Don't expect me back for more, I'll just erase you
Shake hands and walk away
(And look at him crying)
Come on, come on, come on, come on
I'm gonna shake hands and walk away
(And look at him crying)
Come on, come on, come on, come on now
You might also likeShake hands and walk away
(And look at him crying)
Come on, come on, come on, come on
I'm gonna shake hands and walk away
(And look at him crying)
Come on, come on, come on, come on now
Shake hands and walk away
(Ring of echo chamber)
There's much of life in you
And you'd better run too
Shake hands and walk away
(And look at him crying)
Come on, come on, come on, come on
I'm gonna shake hands and walk away
(And look at him crying)
Come on, come on, come on, come on now
Shake hands and walk away
(And look at him crying)
Come on, come on, come on, come on
I'm gonna shake hands and walk away
(And look at him crying)
