Whatever happened to the past
I don't really know
So don't ask me
All I can remember
Is you walking off past me
Tried to get you back
But you said I was too late
You're on another Team
And its time for you to play
Words Hurt
Girl I hope you know they cut deep
Knowing I could've had you
Make its worse
Now the cuts leak
Damn I miss your smile
Now you're miles beyond miles
If I had spoke my mind
You would've loved me
But I was lost up in another world
Couldn't speak to you
But I could talk to other girls
Cause I would get tongue-tied
Wide-Eyed like a Deer
Slurred up words
Like I was drunk off of Beer
You might also likeAnd you was caught up in another world
Had A Man, Though he was worried
Bout them other girls
Cause he'd get wide-eye'd
Everytime that he'd see her
I would've stepped to you
But I won't tryna interfere
(No Sir)


Tell me, Do you remember that night
Sippin' Crystal light
I spilled my emotions
Swear it was the first time
I was lookin' Tight
But trust me you was lookin' Fine
That look in your eyes
Swear it still crosses my mind
And we were with your sister
She was hella cool
That was my Ace
Man, I miss her
But I guess
I should leave the past in the past
Thats the saying
But what if theres a chance
That you still feel the same
Oh Damn, this bugs me
Got to roll the dice
But I keep coming up unlucky
But whos to say this next roll
Won't be the hit
Might as well take the roll
Whats the worst that it could get
Whats the worst that it could get
And I keep replaying these scenes
Just you and me
Tryna read in between
Was there something I missed
Was there something I didn't read
Or was it all just that
I didn't tell you something
