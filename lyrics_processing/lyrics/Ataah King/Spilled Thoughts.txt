And I'm not trynna sound ungrateful
I just thought that I should thank you
Cause you taught me a great lesson
Yeah, you taught me to be faithful
How to hold on to an Angel
With the Devil at your ankles, Oh lord

Bars for the realest
Clocks still ticking
So my thoughts are all spilling

I guess that I'm a criminal
If you play this thing backwards
Its subliminal, flip it yo
Rhyming all night
Nothing much to do
Just tryna catch the limelight
Cause the broads
All frauds
Looking for a Like Mike
Gotta to be Mad tight
Just To ride their high tide
You might also like

What's this about commitment
Gotta be the realest in it
Just to make it to the finish
Lord know I want it
Don't see no need to fake it
No doubt that I'm gonna make it
Either that or I'mma take it
So far I've been very patient
But listen don't test my patience
Or soon you'll all be patients


How far will I take it
I said it once before
Man its nothing to be famous
I'm aiming for the greatness
Was aiming for the A-list
Just to quickly realize
Most of em are chasing pavement
Most of em are chasing payments
Figures why the greatest
Is still vacant

Man this is so ironic
Class mates
Don't pass me
Without telling me that I'm on it
Dropped a mix tape
They telling me that they want it
Just last week
Man its funny
Cause I won't wanted
Started Praying for Reign
The Reign
Already done it
Addicted to this game
The race
Already won it


Bars for the illest
I'm out for making change
So cashiers can even feel it
Bars for the realest
Clocks still ticking
So my thoughts all spilling
