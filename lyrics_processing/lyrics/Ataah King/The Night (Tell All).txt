Reflection
Then baby you must be an angel
Cause when the light, hits you just right
One could mistake you for a star
That is exactly what you are...

Hey, Hey
My old girl
Asked "You Feeling Ol Girl"
I said, "Not really
But she's looking real thorough"
I thought I'd keep it real
I thought I was forreal
I thought I didn't care
But deep down it would kill
A few weeks later
When she hooked up with my homeboy
Damn, I was mad when they was alone, boy
Thinking in my head
He's in my spot
And he don't know boy
Shoot, But we won't cool like that
Exchanged a few words
Kept it few like that
But little did I know
We would feud like that
And it was all good
Until that one night
We was sipping crystal light
And I was smooth like that
Had it all planned
Made some moves like that
Spittin' metaphors
Kinda cool like rap
Like girl, Metaphorically speaking
If his team wasn't winning
Would you switch to my team, like that?
You might also like
This is my tell all track
So I thought that I should bring 'all' back

My old girl
Said "You feeling Ol Girl
I know this time
Cause she told me bout it
I know we're history
But you don't know what you meant to me
Made her a song
But you ain't never make a hit for me
Never take a lick for me
What we had was it real
You never ever sent for me
I was mad
Keep it real
Here you are rapping
I just hope you never get a deal
Lose all your attention
I just hope you never make a Mil
But you be claiming that you keep it real
You're a fraud
Chasing drawers
You was never trill
Played a good game
I applaud
Your creative skill
But I hope that you never make it still
You're nothing but a broke J. Cole
Listen up you ain't nothing but a wanna be
Honestly
I know you're kind of good
But Varsity
Ain't the place for you
Better luck at the minor leagues"
(Hey, Jezebel, Hey)

I told my old girl
Forget about ol' girl
This is bout us
But I ain't thought about it
Yea I, Made her a track
And I had put it on the mixtape
But keep it real
Why we talking bout it
If you, had let it go
Would've forgot about it
And this scenario
Would've been out and boutin'
But still
Let me once again keep it real
She is Jezebel
And I'm still shoutin' about it, Hey
And this flame you keep pissin in
Keeps me asking
Are you listening
Can you hear me
Do you see where I'm coming from
This is stressing
Can you see why I'm on the run
On the run from oneself
Is like gunning oneself
Back against the wall
Lost control of oneself
Hey, Just don't start cutting oneself
(Haan, Haan)

And if you wasn't mentioned
That says a lot about you
That means you either missing
Or I just forgot about you

(All of the good times)
A glimpse from the mirror
To tell me you're just fine, alright
But then the night takes over
And there is no one else around
Your face in broken pieces
