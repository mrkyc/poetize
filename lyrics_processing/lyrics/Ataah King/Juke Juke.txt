Yeah, Yeah, Yeah

Now everybody tryna roll up
And I'm just tryna kick my feet up
Standing in this line I'm tryna find my way to free lunch
Probably sit by Freeda cause them Fritos I could eat em
I could reload, Pass to Cee-Lo
Grab the blunt then come and meet ya
Pass the blunt nah, (Juke Juke)
Grab a broad and (Juke Juke)
What the hell did You Do
Now she on that VooDoo
Keep it clean, nah keep it Kosher
9 up on that Vulture, 9 to 5 or 5 to 9
I keep it live like I'm suppose to
Child up on that Poster, loud inside my couster
Never was this dude but Senior Year my mind had opened
I just hope that I'm still graduating
Cause y'all know I stay procastinating
Mind up on that ass n' cake and
Tryna get to math class took a lil ride
Slept all through my last class
Z's weighing my mind
So I'm tryna find my way back
To lay back the time
Bumping Maybach and A$AP to Relax my mind
Chano, checking out his Channel
Bumping Acid Rap and laughing back, I understand em
Who would've ever known that I would go and see the globe
See different homes like Different Strokes
Then stroke my bone inside her dome
And now she calls me Larry Holmes
Because I beat it up, Su Casa, You're my corazon
You record the show then play it back when I be gone
And now it's on and on and on
They got me playing old songs like
You might also like
(ohhhh, ohhh baby)
X4
Yeah, Old Songs like
Senioritis, Old Songs Like
Yeah, Old songs like, Old Songs like
Old songs like, Old songs like, Old Songs like

Now everybody screaming Hold Up
This ain't Kendrick Lamar
Man where is my money
I'm just tryna see a star
I'm just tryna hear some bars
From the greatest in the game
I said you seen him when you came
You know his name is Ataah King
Haha, And now they staring at me
The hell is on his mind
Besides some hair and acne
I'm just tryna show you something
That you'd probably skip through
This is probably hip too
If you part in Gin-Ju
I'm just kinda crazy, Minds all twisted
Rhymes all wicked, Lets get lifted
Time for a party, If you party come too
If you're partly confused
Know the loud will come through
I quit though, but I'll hit though
Just take a couple hits to make the beat increase the tempo
Girls grabbing they friend though, watch their rear ends low
Kind of perverted, Kind of off weirdo, Kind of uncertain
The room got a spin flow, These broads getting in though
They brown skinned like Winslow, waist thin as pencil
But thicker than her, Kind of Beyonce, I give you my word
And now they call me Larry Holmes
Because I beat it up, Su Casa, You're my corazon
You record the show
Then play it back when I be gone
And now it's on and on and on
You got me playing old songs like
