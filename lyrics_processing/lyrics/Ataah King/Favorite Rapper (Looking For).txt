I'm probably not the one you're looking for
And I just thought I'd let you know this so I could keep my focus
On hooks and verses, books and hoes
They say you have to keep your balance
Be You and find your talent
Cause everybody tryna do the same thing
Claiming that they're real, but they're just copying for safety
I could drop a mil and cop a feel, adopt a will, like Poppa Phil
The ambience, up on a hill, we hit the rocks, then let it spill

And that was for my homies, they never catch a high
Because they lay 6ft below me
Atleast in my mind as I sit back and I rewind
The old times and the old twines
That was broken by cold lies

And I am not your favorite rapper
But I could switch it up and have you go bananananas
Now you're sitting in your basement
And you're jammer-jammer jamming
Then pass it to the hoes, it went from Amber, Cather, Jasmine
Now it's Amber capping Jasmine, no pistol just some slamming
Reminds me of the time when I was sitting back in class and
These hoes was wildin', acting out, swore it was a riot
I was rollin', I was backing out, damn that day was fire
You might also like
And that was for the old me
He just was getting by music had been his one and only
Atleast in my mind as I sit back and I rewind
The old times and the old twines that was broken by cold lies

It makes me wonder where we're heading
You think we'll make it out, you think we'll ever find the heaven
The thing that we've been looking for
(Dreams) Dreams we'll never find
From time to time you've crossed my mind
I've come around to realize that you're perfect
And I know it all seems worthless
A rapper nonetheless, but nothing more unless we're working
Yeah I know I don't deserve it, Cee-Lo, bumping got me hurting
Now I'm squirming, steady lurking, prolly not your favorite person

(and, and, and)
And that was to the old we
We would've made it out if I won't out here catching cold feet
Doubts up on my mind, from time to time I still rewind
I wonder if we would've made it, If we could've made it

Zero-Nine-Two-Two, It still crosses my mind
I still wonder if you and I can sit and talk to father time
And make a deal, make dues with all this hurting
Prolly not your favorite rapper, prolly not your favorite person
Now I'm sitting in my room and blowing O's
Never was that dude but senioritis has its flows
It has its flaws, I'm with my bros
We catching lift, we calling broads
Then hit the road, may lord forgive our common flaws
(and, and, and)
And I am not your favorite rapper
But I can switch it up and have you go bananananas
Now you're sitting in your basement
And you're jammer-jammer jamming
Then you pass it to the bros, it went from him, to Ant, to Brandon
 (X2)


I'm probably not the one you're looking for
(X4)

Yeah, Zero-Nine-Two-Two, it still crosses my mind
I still, wonder from time to time if we could talk to father time
And make a deal, make dues with all the hurting
Prolly not your favorite rapper, prolly not your favorite person
I been, out working on the Eastside, tryna be the nigga
You can stop it with the peace sign, I'm just tryna reach to you
I'm just tryna rewind, I wish I could give it to you
I wish I could, I wish I could be the nigga that you fell for
Be the nigga that you one day felt for
Be the nigga that you're in with
