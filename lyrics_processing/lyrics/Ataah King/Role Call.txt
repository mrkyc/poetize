Don't skip fastforward
Don't skip class boy
(Hey,  Hey)
VERSE:
See this is not the Roll Call
But don't skip fast forward
Thoughts on my mind
Tryna skip class boredom
Pissed Postpartum
How did I write this
Doodles in my journal
How did I become a white kid
BRIDGE I:
Hey, delete that
Racism in the sheets
Better skeet that
Let it all out
When you creep
If you wreak that
They might lay you out
In the streets
Where them fiends at
(fiends at)
You might also likeVERSE:
And I'm lil not normal
Rhyme all night
Just a tad nocturnal
Turnal I get it
Just let me rewrite this
You with it
I'm kidding
It's called senioritis
I'm on
Hey but then I'm off
Life full of tales
I'm just tryna live them all
Life lived well
Well without the wishing well
Living ill
Only wished now that I did em all
HOOK:
Got a girl on my right side
Got another on the left
Which way should I go
Should I blow
Should I dodge
Should I
Lead her in to depth
But if I do though
She'll cut a brother off like pluto
She'll run into my arms like it's cool though
Just Turn around and kick a brother
Like judo, judo
VERSE:
And I'm a lil not normal
And she's a lil insane
But some how we're in sync
On brink, impeached
I speak in vain
Love you now
I speak your name
Love you how
I freak your brain
Ataah King
Ataah King
Love you how
You scream my name
BRIDGE II:
And that's awkward, awkward
Tryna ask a girl to the oscars, oscars
Is it real, can you trust
It's for real, it's for us
Damn what are all these
Problems, Problems
BRIDGE I:
Hey, delete that
Racism in the sheets
Better skeet that
Let it all out
When you creep
If you wreak that
They might lay you out
In the street
Where them fiends at
(fiends at)
HOOK:
Got a girl on my right side
Anothers on the left
Which way should I go
Should I blow
Should I dodge
Should I
Lead her in to depth
And if it's right though
She'll cut a brother off like lipo
She'll tell you this is it
Like Michael
Just to turn around and through some hits
Like Michael, Michael
And it's so oh oh
It's our song oh
It's so oh oh
Just let go
Break it down
Break it down down down
(Repeat)
OUTRO:
See this is not a role call
But don't skip fast forward
Thoughts on my mind
Tryna skip class boredom
Pissed Postpartum
How did I write this
Doodles in my journal
How did I become a white kid

Don't skip class boy
And don't skip fastforward
