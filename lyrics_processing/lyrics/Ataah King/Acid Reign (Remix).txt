Na nana na na na (2X)
One take, One take, One take (2X)

Hey, Let's drop the Ambiens
For all y'all that been sleeping on me
You know this game
I'm slowly creeping on it
People on me, asking when I'm gonna make it to the big screen
In my mind already made it
Now my life is but a dream
Now these broads are everything
Anything I ever need
I used to think the secret
To success was in their jeans
So I, Yeah, you understand
I used to think to get it
Meant that I would be the man
Now I'm standing on this stage
And they throwing up their hands
Screaming "Ataah King, Ataah King"
I'm trying to understand
Who they thinking that I am
Cause it can't be me, it can't be me
But either way I'm flabbergasted
Dropped Ambition, then Ambition
And I started last year
Who would think
That I would make it this far
Only been a couple months
I'm on the verge of Lift-Off
Man that's word to Chris Bosh
You can stop the Pish-Posh
Cause I'm getting pissed off
Do not make me Rick Ross
Either way they'll double cross you
If you make it they'll be hating
Steady praying that you fall through
Stacking pieces like they Lego's
Life is not a game
But this is feeling like it's halo
You must defend your name
Or else you'll leggo of that Eggo
Got you laid low on that yayo
Sell you for a couple pesos
See that's just how my day gos
Writing rhymes
Looking for some catchy say-sos
Praying that a broad
Will hear my songs
Then get ye low
Praying inner-mind
She looks something like J-Lo
Cliche Replayed it (Replayed it)
Cliche's repainted (Repainted)
Please excuse my manners
I'm feeling a lil jaded
Picassos on my wall
And They looking a lil faded
Ambition
You might also like
Kicked off my shoes, tripped acid in the rain
Wore my jacket as a cape, and my umbrella as a cane
The richest man rocks the snatch-less necklace
Spineless bitches in backless dresses
Wore my feelings on my sleeveless
My weed seedless, my trees leafless
I miss my diagonal grilled cheeses
And back when Mike Jackson was still Jesus
Before I believed in not believing in
Yeah, I inhaled, who believed in me not breathing in
Cigarette stained smile all covered in sin
My big homie died young; just turned older than him
I seen it happen, I seen it happen, I see it always
He still be screaming, I see his demons in empty hallways
I trip to make the fall shorter
Fall quarter was just a tall order
And I'm hungry, I'm just not that thirsty
As of late, all my verses seem not so verse-y
And all my words just mean controversy
Took the team up off my back, like "That's not your jersey?"
Stressin', pullin' my hair out, hoping I don't get picked
All this medicine in me hoping I don't get sick
Making all of this money hoping I don't get rich
Cause niggas still getting bodied for foams
Sometimes the truth don't rhyme
Sometime the lies get millions of views
Funerals for little girls, is that appealing to you?
From your cubicle desktop, what a beautiful view
I think love is beautiful, too
Building forts from broken dams, what a hoover could do
For future hoopers dead from Rugers shooting through the empty alley
Could've threw him an alley-oop, helping him do good in school
Damn that acid burn when it clean ya
I still miss being a senior
And performing at all those open mic events
Eyes closed, eyes closed seeing arenas
And I still get jealous of Vic
And Vic's still jealous of me
But if you touch my brother
All that anti-violence shit goes out the window along with you
And the rest of your team
Smoking cigarettes to look cooler
I only stop by to look through ya
And I'm only getting greedier
And I'm still Mr. Youmedia
And I still can't find Talent
And I'm still choosing classmates that wouldn't fuck
Mom still thinks I should go back to school
And Justin still thinks I'm good enough
And Mama Jan still don't take her meds
And I still be asking God to show his face
And I still be asking God to show his face
I am a new man, I am sanctified
Oh I am holy, I have been baptized
I have been born again, I am the White Light
