Na nana na na na (2X)
One take, One take, One take (2X)

Hey, Let's drop the Ambiens
For all y'all that been sleeping on me
You know this game
I'm slowly creeping on it
People on me, asking when I'm gonna make it to the big screen
In my mind already made it
Now my life is but a dream
Now these broads are everything
Anything I ever need
I used to think the secret
To success was in their jeans
So I, Yeah, you understand
I used to think to get it
Meant that I would be the man
Now I'm standing on this stage
And they throwing up their hands
Screaming "Ataah King, Ataah King"
I'm trying to understand
Who they thinking that I am
Cause it can't be me, it can't be me
But either way I'm flabbergasted
Dropped Ambition, then Ambition
And I started last year
Who would think
That I would make it this far
Only been a couple months
I'm on the verge of Lift-Off
Man that's word to Chris Bosh
You can stop the Pish-Posh
Cause I'm getting pissed off
Do not make me Rick Ross
Either way they'll double cross you
If you make it they'll be hating
Steady praying that you fall through
Stacking pieces like they Lego's
Life is not a game
But this is feeling like it's halo
You must defend your name
Or else you'll leggo of that Eggo
Got you laid low on that yayo
Sell you for a couple pesos
You might also like
See that's just how my day gos
Writing rhymes
Looking for some catchy say-sos
Praying that a broad
Will hear my songs
Then get ye low
Praying inner-mind
She looks something like J-Lo
Cliche Replayed it
Cliche's repainted
Please excuse my manners
I'm feeling a lil jaded
Picassos on my wall
And They looking a lil faded
Ambition


Mbaacha in the booth
Know I'm spitting proof
Spitting image of the truth
Got 'em in cahoots
Got a couple broads in a group
Put 'em in the hoop
Got a couple drawers in a scoop
Drop 'em out the roof
Hey when I splurge though
These broads looking at me like a weirdo
Cause I keep my verbs so
Crisp, Keep em fertile
Get you through the highs
And the lows like a hurdle
And that's beat
You looking for the illest
You can stop
Cause that's me
I might just be the GOAT
Be the almighty
I'm quoting my own quotes
And Signing my own Tee's
Acid Rain
Bring the pain for you
If you staying
Marvin Gaye for you
Ambition IV
Through your corridors
You can't say
I never came for you
Hey
And that's beat
And that's me
