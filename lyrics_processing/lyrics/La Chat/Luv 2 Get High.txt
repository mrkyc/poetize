I chief-ah a swish-ah, my lungs is full of buddah

I'm high-yah can't lie yall, man this shits some fire
Covasier, that good hay and weed bong, got damn yall
I lit it, lit it, lit it, and then I hit it, hit it
I'm smokin' like a dope fiend, I need to quit it, quit it, quit it
Take a pull inhale, still waitin' to exhale
Eyes got bloody red cells and I'm sippin' on some Martel
It's a party goin' on inside my fuckin' body
And it's too wild, I can't hang and can't nobody stop it
I smoke that green dope, that high I'm on cloud 9 dro yah
I don't fuck with seeds, you keep your weed I got my own hoe
Shit, you wonder why La Chat don't speak when bitches pass me by
Nine times outta ten when I'm in the wind, I'm either drunk or high
And to you smokers holla at me I'm gon' smoke some witcha
But if you don't smoke wit' me, we can smoke, take a pull for me my nigga

I keep that chronic in mind, I try my best to stay high
I smoke an ounce of that pure, man fuck some nickels and dimes
I get to thinkin' 'bout shit, my nigga fuckin this bitch
My thoughts get outta control, I'm finna cut off his dick
Blow me a gun to my nose, my throat is hung up wit' smoke
I don't fuck wit' you on that dope, if it's not makin' me choke
I roll up in them sweets, who got that shit in the streets
I smoke until I'm asleep, it's just the thuggin' in me
I hope you already know, you gotta give me some dro
The way you smoke wit' yo niggas, that's how we smokin' lil' bro
My nig will get a hoe high, but he won't get high wit' me
But I ain't fucked up 'bout that, it's niggas givin' me weed
I'd go to all neighborhoods and smoke you out if I could
A smokin' session on me, I'd charge it all to the good
Mane I'm gon' ride and get high, until the day that I die
I know my lungs ain't 'bout shit, 'cause dog I keep me some fire
