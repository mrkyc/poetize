Mane it be these broads that's always tryin' to down the mack
All the time it be these chickens wishin' they could be La' Chat
Ain't no way that you can be me, I got thuggin' in my blood
Cookin' pork chops and that rice, makin' scrubs fall in love
Know you wish that you can ride my ride, and stay up in my crib
Makin' cheese, cashin' checks, yeah you know that's how I live
Hope that you can be like me? Freak, I'm just like Pimpin Ken
Checkin traps for a sugar daddy, take him and his friend
Everythang you wanna do is all the things that I done did
Drank a twelve case of beer, rollin', chockin' with my nig
Ridin' twankies, shining pinkie, independent on you haters
And you dudes tryin' to choose, ya'll can holla at me later
Talkin' bad about La' Chat, but you know you lovin' that
'Cause between these legs is fa-fa-fa-fa-fat
Ain't no messin' with yo kind, 'cause yo kind ain't on my level
Say you takin' care of me, boy please, whatever

She's a peanut butter, muthafucka, nappy weave bitch (yeen know)
