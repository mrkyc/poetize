AUUUUUU!! Wolfpack, get down bitch
Get on the mothafucking ground hoe
Hypnotize got damn posse in yo house bitch
Gangsta Boo, Crunchy Black, Lord Infamous, DJ Paul, Juicy J, La Chat
And my new nigga Frayser Boy

Hypnotize Camp bitch, step into this mask
Get yo ass fucked up bitch, 44 blast
And u lemons lookin' at me hard
Gangsta B. assassin gonna catch a fuckin murder charge
Fuckin wit' you niggas
Mutha fuckas wit that hoe shit
Circulatin' gossip 'bout the lady, what's the business bitch
If u really got a problem then let my niggas know
How you gonna handle that? The wrath of a killer hoe

Make the wrong move and bodies get bruised
Talk too much fool, then I duct-tape you
Act a damn fool and get treated like a fool
What did I do to get stuck in these shoes
Ooooh the fuck? oooh!!! when you see me come thru
Lock and fuckin' load, when I pop at you
Do the damn thing, nigga do what you do
Ain't no attitude, I'm just being like you
You might also like
I'm knockin' down you niggas doors, fuckin all you niggas hoes
Get out the way I'm throwin' bows, a nigga hurt, don't stop no show
Straight out the Bay a nigga real, don't try to fake the fuckin deal
All my dogs I know is trill, I'm out here tryna get a meal
Fuckin wit that Hypnotize, I can see it in yo eyes
Frayser Boy it ain't no lie, you can kiss yo ass goodbye
I been branded as HCP niggas don't u fuck wit me
Just like the Sun bringin' heat run up nigga u gone see bitch

Lords the horrid; very morbid
Chainsaw roaring, niggas blood is pouring
Arts of War - I invented the torment
44 gat, all the slugs are soaring
You're the target, hope you can absorb it
My mortuaries got plenty of storage
I got some shit that launch yo ass into orbit
Close the casket, obituary poetry

Now I'mma break it down for ya since you bitches don't know
Just because u signed wit' select-o, you ain't a CEO
Ya gotta sell some records first, that's part of the plan
Let's try to see if you can get more than 20,000 on sound scan
You wack ass bitches what ya playin' wit' this cheese
Ya need to get up on 80 G's and holla at me
Thats the discounted price for a Hypnotize beat
On my wall I got some Golds and I got some PTs
I bet u knew dat Bitch
I'm from the hood, I ain't no good
Wit' 20 niggas deep we rollin' lac wood
You can't faze me, you do amaze me
You say u on top, so why u hate me
You muggin', you starin', but I ain't carin'
Or is it my watch, the platinum the carats
But why u wanna do, what grown folks do
Like go to house of dubbs and purchase 22's

I'm puttin' the city on lock, I'm finna load up them Glocks
I'm gonna blow up ya spot, when ya run ya get popped
Loaded strapped up wit' gats, but you can't kill of a mack
You done fucked up ya know that, I hope you watchin' yo back
I gave you props a great bitch, them killers give me yo shit
La Chat gone blow off yo wig, why you keep crossin' yo nig
I hope you ready for war, I ain't got no time for ya boys
Mayn I got somethin' in store, ya need to play wit ya whore
I get together the tone, pull up in front of ya home
You betta know that it's on, that woman shoot up ya dome
Since ya wanna be a killer, here's ya chance ya nigga
Let's see do u got the liver, to pull ya gun and the trigga
A lot of bitches hate Chat, but I ain't fucked up 'bout dat
Ya wanna get off some anna, shit, ya know where I'm at
But then ya know how I roll, ya bitches know what I'm 'bout
