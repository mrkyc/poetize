Yeah, you niggas about to witness somethin' you have witnessed before, you know what I'm sayin'?
All that good shit, yeah

All I wanna do is just smoke witcha, smoke witcha
Break down the weed, smoke dope witcha, dope witcha
All I wanna do is just drank witcha, drank witcha
Get drunk, pass out, and faint witcha, faint witcha
All I wanna do is just smoke witcha, smoke witcha
Break down the weed, smoke dope witcha, dope witcha
All I wanna do is just drank witcha, drank witcha
Get drunk, pass out, and faint witcha, faint witcha

It's been a long night, I ain't got a appetite
So full and gone off dem muthafuckin' Bud Lights
Can't even lie, I be drunk (shit) full of dem beers
Get yo ass on nuthin' but drankers kick it over here
Come and join, gimme some, mayne, it's goin' down
My head is spinnin' super fast, ain't no stoppin' now
At the level now, I'm searchin' for the marijuana
Can't find no dro', now I'm sick on grandma's last Corona
Heineken be my friend mixed wit' juice n' gin
The way I drink it let me know it is my favorite sin
That Icehouse (oo) I'm strung out on da couch
Before I leave, I'm guaranteed to take a nigga mouth
And what you know about that Red Dog? Fuck y'all
That shit don't play, it have you runnin' up da fuckin' wall
I drank until the circum up who the fuck is able
Step up, I jump yo' ass under da fuckin' table

I'm hollerin' at a dude say "Roll up some mo' to smoke"
Tryin' to keep my cool, but "Damn, this some good dope"
"Wanna roll a joint?", "Naw dog, rollin' optimo"
"Well wanna go smoke?", "I ain't smokin' unless it's dro'"
Love to get high when I'm flexin' in my ride
I keep my mean mug for the haters outside
You wanna get up wit' me, all you gotta do is hit me
I keep my two-way jumpin', gotta keep my pimpin'
I'm full of that pure, mayne, we gone off that ganja
Drunk off that beer, system full of marijuana
Tryin' to hit my weed, but La Chat ain't got nuttin' for ya'
Can't smoke for free, so I'm gonna holla at ya
I'm creepin' through the hood, niggas try to flag me down
I throw the W, 'cause I'm Westwood bound
I'm feelin' good as hell, mayne, this dro' has got me high
My daily routine is to smoke and ride
All I wanna do is just smoke witcha, smoke witcha
Break down the weed, smoke dope witcha, dope witcha
All I wanna do is just drank witcha, drank witcha
Get drunk, pass out, and faint witcha, faint witcha
All I wanna do is just smoke witcha, smoke witcha
Break down the weed, smoke dope witcha, dope witcha
All I wanna do is just drank witcha, drank witcha
