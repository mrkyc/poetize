Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Enemy fire

Who's a friend? Who's an enemy?
'Cause sometimes they look the same to me
But looks can be pleasing
Yet so deceiving
Sweet words from a serpent's tongue
It's like playin' with a loaded gun
Who knows what truth is?
How do you prove it?
I swear I see you watchin' me, well

(Oh-oh-oh) Come a little closer
(Oh-oh-oh) You can be my soldier
(Oh-oh-oh) Keepin' me safe from all who conspire
Enemy fire
(Oh-oh-oh) I'm lookin' for some shelter
(Oh-oh-oh) From the Helter Skelter
(Oh-oh-oh) Just keep me away from all who conspire
Enemy fire

Oh-oh-oh (Oh, oh-oh)
Oh-oh-oh (Oh, oh-oh)
Enemy fire, enemy fire

Burn a hole through the plastic crowd
Because I've been tryna find the way out
It's so confusing
But never amusing
Sweet smiles in the aftermath
Turn to whisperin' behind my back
I need an ally
To guard the nighttime
Someone to keep me from these crazies

(Oh-oh-oh) Come a little closer
(Oh-oh-oh) You can be my soldier
(Oh-oh-oh) Keepin' me safe from all who conspire
Enemy fire
(Oh-oh-oh) I'm lookin' for some shelter
(Oh-oh-oh) From the Helter Skelter
(Oh-oh-oh) Just keep me away from all who conspire
Enemy fire
Oh-oh-oh (Oh, oh-oh)
Oh-oh-oh (Oh, oh-oh)
Oh-oh-oh (Oh, oh-oh)
Enemy fire, enemy fire

All around me, I hear cries
And bombs are fallin' from the skies
Can't you help me save my life?
(Oh-oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh)
Enemy fire

(Oh-oh-oh) Come a little closer
(Oh-oh-oh) You can be my soldier
(Oh-oh-oh) Keepin' me safe from all who conspire
Enemy fire
(Oh-oh-oh) I'm lookin' for some shelter
(Oh-oh-oh) From the Helter Skelter
(Oh-oh-oh) Just keep me away from all who conspire
Enemy fire

Oh-oh-oh (Oh, oh-oh)
Oh-oh-oh (Oh, oh-oh)
Oh-oh-oh (Oh, oh-oh)
Enemy fire, enemy fire
Oh-oh-oh (Oh, oh-oh)
Oh-oh-oh (Oh, oh-oh)
Oh-oh-oh (Oh, oh-oh)
