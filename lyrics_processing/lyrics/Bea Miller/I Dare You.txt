I can remember a time when I was so afraid
When even my shadow wouldn't follow me

So I, I, I'm picking up my sword
To shatter all the pieces that I was before
Cause I, I, I'm worth fighting for
For, for, for

So put me in a cage, lock me in a room
Throw away the key, I dare you
I'll break down the walls, a high heel wrecking ball
And I won't let you tear me down, no
Oh, oh, throw away the key, I dare you
Oh, oh and I won't let you tear me down, no

I had an opinion, but I never spoke my mind
And I wouldn't argue, even when I knew I was right

But I'm not that girl anymore
Yeah, I lost the battle but I won the war
Cause I, I, I'm worth fighting for
For, for, for
You might also like
So put me in a cage, lock me in a room
Throw away the key, I dare you
I'll break down the walls, a high heel wrecking ball
And I won't let you tear me down, no
Oh, oh, throw away the key, I dare you
Oh, oh and I won't let you tear me down, no

I just kept on running, running, running
Trying to find out who I was
I would go the distance but it wasn't far enough
But now I'm standing straight and know exactly who I am
Yeah, yeah
I can remember a time when I was so afraid

Put me in a cage, lock me in a room
Throw away the key, I dare you
I'll break down the walls, a high heel wrecking ball
And I won't let you tear me down, no
Oh, oh, throw away the key, I dare you
Oh, oh and I won't let you tear me down, no
I won't let you tear me down, no
I won't let you tear me down, no
