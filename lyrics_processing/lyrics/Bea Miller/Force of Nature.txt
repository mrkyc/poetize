I don't know why, but my hands are shakin'
I can see you comin' and I stand here waitin'
Yeah I get tongue-tied in the conversation
It's an F'd up F6 situation

I tried to tie my heart down
Board up all the windows
Oh, but it's too late now
I let you get too close
I know I should take cover
Hide inside these four walls
But, baby, I surrender it all

'Cause you're a force of nature
Look at what you've done
I can taste the danger
But I don't wanna run
So pull me to the ground
And I won't put up a fight
I'm a caution taker
But, baby, you're a force of nature

Baby, you're a force of nature
You might also like
I feel your lips move in and they take me under
You know just what to do, how to make me want ya
And I know I'll be broken when it's over
Oh, but I can't help but pull you closer

I tried to tie my heart down
Board up all the windows
Oh, but it's too late now
I let you get too close

'Cause you're a force of nature
Look at what you've done
I can taste the danger
But I don't wanna run
So pull me to the ground
And I won't put up a fight
I'm a caution taker
But, baby, you're a force of nature

(Ooh)
(Ooh)
I'll be here 'til we collide
I don't care if I survive
So crash into me one more time
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh

'Cause you're a force of nature
Look at what you've done
I can taste the danger
But I don't wanna run
So pull me to the ground
And I won't put up a fight
I'm a caution taker
But, baby, you're a force of nature

(Ooh)
Baby, you're a force of nature (Ooh)
(Ooh)
Baby, you're a force of nature (Ooh)
