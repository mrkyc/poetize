I've been lonely, missing your body
You've been out of touch, you're so far away
Wishing you would tell me you're sorry
And you know you made a big mistake

Close my eyes and try to forget you
Every time I do, I just see your face
After all this shit that we've been through
Why you so willing to walk away?

(Ooh ooh ooh, ooh)
I don't know why I stick around to
Watch you burn our bridges down
I can't help it that I need ya (Need ya)
I can't help it that I need ya (Need ya)
(Ooh ooh ooh, ooh)
Now I'm drowning underneath the
Water that was under me
I'm still screaming that I need ya (Need ya)
(I can't help it that I need you)

Burn the bridges, burn them down
Down, down, down, down
Burn the bridges, burn them down
Down, down, down, down, down (Down)
You might also like
You left me with a craving I can't fill
It got me wondering what I had yesterday
Tell everyone I'm fine, but I'm still
Sitting here, choking on the aftertaste

(Ooh, ooh ooh)
Can't stay away from you, I've tried, I tried
(Ooh, ooh ooh)
But you got a grip on my mind

(Ooh ooh ooh, ooh)
I don't know why I stick around to
Watch you burn our bridges down
I can't help it that I need ya (need ya)
I can't help it that I need ya (need ya)
(Ooh ooh ooh, ooh)
Now I'm drowning underneath the
Water that was under me
I'm still screaming that I need ya (need ya)
(I can't help it that I need you)

Burn the bridges, burn them down
Down, down, down, down
Burn the bridges, burn them down
Down, down, down, down, down (Down)
(Ooh, ooh ooh)
Can't stay away from you, I've tried, I tried
(Ooh, ooh ooh)
But you got a grip on my mind

Now I'm drowning underneath the
Water that was under me
I'm still screaming that I need ya (Need ya)
(I can't help it that I need you)

(Burn the bridges, burn them down)
(Burn the bridges, burn them down)
Burn the bridges, burn them down
Down, down, down, down
Burn the bridges, burn them down
