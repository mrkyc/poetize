We could be lyin' next to each other
And I'll tell you what
'Cause even the silence is perfect between us
Or so I heard

But I guess forever's as long as this driveway

You said you would love me 'til the day you die
Well, how are you still alive?
And you said if we ended it would stop your heart
Well, you must need CPR
Guess you found somebody else that you need to survive, oh woah
You said you would love me 'til the day you die
Well, how are you still alive?

Still alive, still alive, still alive?
Still alive, still alive, still alive?

Do you remember the letters you wrote me?
Just because
Tellin' me "we're gonna grow old together"
The two of us
You might also like
But I guess forever's as short as our last kiss

You said you would love me 'til the day you die
Well, how are you still alive?
And you said if we ended it would stop your heart
Well, you must need CPR
Guess you found somebody else that you need to survive, oh woah
You said you would love me 'til the day you die
Well, how are you still alive?

Still alive, still alive, still alive?
Still alive, still alive, still alive?
Still alive, still alive, still alive?
Still alive, still alive, still alive?

You said you would love me 'til the day you die
Well, how are you still alive?
And you said if we ended it would stop your heart
Well, you must need CPR
Guess you found somebody else that you need to survive, oh woah
You said you would love me 'til the day you die (die)
Well, how are you still alive?
Still alive, still alive, still alive?
Still alive, still alive, still alive?
Still alive, still alive, still alive?
