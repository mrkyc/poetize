I've never been the type
Who needs someone to blow their mind
To climb my tower
To bring me flowers
But if you wanna wake me up
With some coffee in a cup
And talk for hours
I'd like the sound of that

But you don't satisfy the hunger in my mind
'Cause our bodies are predictable

I know I'm gonna call you on my phone
Know I'm gonna ask when you get home
I already know what's next
I end up in your bed
Then you're gonna put back on your clothes
And I'm gonna wish I was alone
But we never change a step
Then do it all again
I'm bored

I just want some company
When I'm not between your sheets
But I'm not dramatic
So I pick my battles, yeah
No, I'm not saying we don't do it good
Don't think I'd trade it if I could
It don't matter, though
It don't matter, no
You might also like
But you don't satisfy the hunger in my mind
'Cause our bodies are predictable

I know I'm gonna call you on my phone
Know I'm gonna ask when you get home
I already know what's next
I end up in your bed
Then you're gonna put back on your clothes
And I'm gonna wish I was alone
But we never change a step
Then do it all again
I'm bored

Not saying we don't do it good
(Not saying, not saying, not saying)
Don't think I'd trade it if I could
(Not saying, not saying, not saying)
Not saying we don't do it good
(Not saying, not saying, not saying)
Don't think I'd trade it if I could
It don't matter, no

I know I'm gonna call you on my phone
Know I'm gonna ask when you get home
I already know what's next
I end up in your bed
Then you're gonna put back on your clothes
And I'm gonna wish I was alone
But we never change a step
Then do it all again
I'm bored
You don't satisfy the hunger in my mind
'Cause our bodies are predictable
I'm bored
You don't satisfy the hunger in my mind
'Cause our bodies are predictable
