When they come to take you down
When they bring that wagon 'round
When they come to call on you
And drag your poor body down

Just one thing I ask of you, is just one thing for me
Please forget you know my name, my darling Sugaree

Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me

You thought you was the cool fool
And never could do no wrong
You had everything sewed up tight
How come you lay awake all night long?

Just one thing I ask of you, is just one thing for me
Please forget you know my name, my darling Sugaree
You might also like
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me

Well, in spite of all you gained
You still had to stand out in the pouring rain
One last voice is calling you
And I guess it's time you go

Just one thing I ask of you, is just one thing for me
Please forget you know my name, my darling Sugaree

Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me

Well shake it up now, Sugaree
I'll meet you at the Jubilee
If that Jubilee don't come
Maybe I'll meet you on the run
Just one thing I ask of you, is just one thing for me
Please forget you know my name, my darling Sugaree

Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
