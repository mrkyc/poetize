It was the afternoon of carnival
As she brushes it gently down
Reuben was strumming his painted mandolin
It was inlaid with a pretty face in jade
Played the carnival parade
Cherise was dressing as Pirouette in white
When a fatal vision gripped her tight
Cherise beware tonight
Reuben, Reuben, tell me truly true
I feel afraid and I don't know why I do
Is there another girl for you?
If you could see my heart, you would know it's true
There's none Cherise, except for you, except for you
I'd swear to it on my very soul
If I lie, may I fall down cold
Reuben was strumming his painted mandolin
The breeze would pause to listen in
Before going on its way again
Masquerade began when nightfall finally woke
Like waves against the bandstand, dancers broke
To the painted mandolin
You might also likeLooking out on the crowd, who is standing there
Sweet Ruby Claire at Reuben stared, at Reuben stared
She was dressed as Pirouette in red
And her hair hung gently down
The crowd pressed round, Ruby stood as though alone
Reuben's song took on a different tone
And he played it just for her
The song that he played was the carnival parade
Each note cut a thread of Cherise's fate
It cut through like a blade
Reuben was strumming his painted mandolin
When Ruby froze and turned to stone
For the strings played all alone
The voice of Cherise from the face of the mandolin
Singing Reuben, Reuben tell me true
For I have no one but you
If you could see my heart, you would know it's true
There's none Cherise, except for you, except for you
I'd swear to it on my very soul
If I lie, may I fall down cold
The truth of love an unsung song must tell
The course of love must follow blind
Without a look behind
Reuben walked the streets of New Orleans 'til dawn
Cherise so lightly in his arms
And her hair hung gently down
