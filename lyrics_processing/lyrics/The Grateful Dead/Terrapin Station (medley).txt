That will not forsake you, till my tale is told and done
While the firelight's aglow, strange shadows from the flames will grow
Till things we've never seen will seem familiar
Shadows of a sailor, forming winds both foul and fair all swarm
Down in Carlisle, he loved a lady many years ago
Here beside him stands a man, a soldier from the looks of him
Who came through many fights, but lost at love
While the story teller speaks, a door within the fire creaks;
Suddenly flies open, and a girl is standing there
Eyes alight, with glowing hair, all that fancy paints as fair
She takes her fan and throws it, in the lion's den
Which of you to gain me, tell, will risk uncertain pains of hell?
I will not forgive you if you will not take the chance
The sailor gave at least a try, the soldier being much too wise
Strategy was his strength, and not disaster
The sailor, coming out again, the lady fairly leapt at him
That's how it stands today. You decide if he was wise
The story teller makes no choice. Soon you will not hear his voice
His job is to shed light, and not to master
Since the end is never told, we pay the teller off in gold
In hopes he will return, but he cannot be bought or sold

Inspiration, move me brightly. Light the song with sense and color;
Hold away despair, more than this I will not ask
Faced with mysteries dark and vast, statements just seem vain at last
Some rise, some fall, some climb, to get to Terrapin
Counting stars by candlelight, all are dim but one is bright;
The spiral light of Venus, rising first and shining best
On, from the northwest corner, of a brand new crescent moon
While crickets and cicadas sing, a rare and different tune
Terrapin Station
In the shadow of the moon, Terrapin Station
And I know we'll get there soon, Terrapin Station
I can't figure out, Terrapin, if it's the end or beginning, Terrapin
But the train's put it's brakes on, Terrapin
And the whistle is screaming, TERRAPIN
Terrapin Station - At the Siding
While you were gone, these faces filled with darkness
The obvious was hidden. With nothing to believe in
The compass always points to Terrapin
Sullen wings of fortune beat like rain
