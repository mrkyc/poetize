Show me what you pray
Teach me every single part
I'll be your guide
You are a prisoner
Looking for to be
You can change your face
But can't change your mind
No matter what do you do

Tell me what your spirit says
Show me what you pray
Teach me every single part
I'll be your guide
You are a prisoner
Looking for to be
You can change your face
But can't change your mind
No matter what do you do
No matter what do you do
No matter what do you do
No matter what do you do
No matter what do you do
No matter what do you do
No matter what do you do
