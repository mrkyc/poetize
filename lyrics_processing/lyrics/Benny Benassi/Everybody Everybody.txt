You won't belong to me, I let you down
I walk around 'n' see your night skyline
I feel the light but you don't want to stay
So lonely now, just let me off downtown
Sad and free, sad and free
Sad and free, sad and free
When I said it was over, you aimed at my heart
Won't be long for I'm leavin' all my love
But I'll feel it forever, no sound's in my life
You can call that no livin', on my own so free
Oh everybody, oh everybody, everybody
Oh everybody, oh everybody
On my own so free
Oh everybody, oh everybody, everybody
Oh everybody, oh everybody
Everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody
Everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody
Everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody
Everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody
