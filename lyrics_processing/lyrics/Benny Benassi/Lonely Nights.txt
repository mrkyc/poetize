These lonely nights
So long, tonight, I've been needing your love
Even though I must have so hard, get down, get down
Don't know how I make it if you are not around, not around
Oh, these fancy cars
Tell me: where do you wanna go by this  town, oh yeah
Do you tell me you're the one that hold me down, hold me down?
You want it just cold, we can't just keep enough, keep enough, oh yeah

Friends, friends
How many of us have them?
Friends, friends
How many of us have them?

How many of us have them?
Friends, friends
How many of us have them?

Amusing now
In a rise, I cannot where I heard this out
Told me: "Keep on swimming, baby, don't give up, no, no"
In an ocean all my dreams don't wanna drown, drown
Do you always bet on me to keep on?
Do you always bet telling me to be strong, be strong?
Don't know how I would ever make it without you
Don't know how I had ever made it without you, without you

I'll get you high and I'll get down
I'll get up and I'll get around
With a little bit of help from my friends
(With a little bit of help from my friends)
Would you let the beat drop comin' 'round my friends, now?

I'll get you hard and never down
I'll give up and I'll give around
Would have better, better doubted on my friend
