Check it out, my man bringing the noise that's right this new year
My man Benny Benassi guaranteed to heat up the floor for sure, yeah
Bring the noise, bass
Bring the noise
Bass, how low can you go?
Bass, how low can you go?
Death row, what a brother knows
Once again, back is the incredible
Rhyme animal, the incredible D
Public Enemy number one
Five-O said, "Freeze", and I got numb
Can I tell 'em that I really never had a gun?
But it's the wax that the Terminator X spun
Now they got me in a cell 'cause my records they sell
'Cause a brother like me said
"Well, Farrakhan's a prophet and I think you ought to listen to
What he can say to you, what you ought to do"
Is follow for now, power of the people, say
Make a miracle, D pump the lyrical
Black is back, all in we're gonna win
Check it out, yeah y'all c'mon, here we go again

Ayo Chuck, they saying we to black man
Bring the noise
Yo, I don't understand what they saying
But little do they know they could get a smack for that
Never badder than bad 'cause the brother is madder than mad
At the fact thats corrupt as a senator
Soul on roll but you treat it like soap on a rope
'Cause the beats in the lines are so dope
Listen for lessons I'm saying inside
Music that the critics are blasting me
For they'll never care for the brothers and sisters
Now across the country has us up for the war
We got to demonstrate, come on now
They're gonna have to wait till we get it right
Radio stations I question their blackness
They call themselves black but we'll see if they'll play this
Turn it up, turn it up
Turn it up, turn it up
Turn it up, turn it up
Turn it up, turn it up
Bring the noise
Bring the noise
Bring the noise
