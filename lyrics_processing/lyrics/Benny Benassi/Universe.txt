When you're far from home
I will always be around you
And the wind that blows
You can always feel me close
It's a long long roll
It don't even matter where you go
Remember in the dark
There's a billion stars ready to surround you

My love my love my love for you it's the Universe
My love my love my love for you it's the Universe
My love my love my love for you it's the Universe
My love my love my love for you it's the Universe
And it's a long long roll
It don't even matter where you go
My love my love my love for you it's the Universe
My love my love my love for you it's the Universe


No matter what you do, I'll be waiting on the horizon
I won't let you lose, I'll be there to pull you through
It's a long long roll
It don't even matter where you go
Remember in the dark
There's a billion stars ready to surround you
