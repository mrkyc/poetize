One stop true love
Don't knock the stars above
You can't blame the moon for a broken heart
Sweet talk
Drive through
There' nothing left to do
But tear those old love letters apart
Fat chance romance
He pulls you close to dance
You've never met a man who could hold you down
He's caught your smile
You've up and drove him wild
You're head on his shoulder
But you're looking around
Ooh what's the matter with you baby
Whatever happened to that first kiss
You couldn't resist
Now you're thinking you can do better than this
Ooh whats the matter with you baby
Do you only want the ones
That you know you can't have
True love so much better than that
You might also likeClose fit that's it
All that matters is
You wake up in the arms of the one you love
Through tidal waves
Undertow
Holding on
Letting go
There's no such thing as gettin enough
Ooh what's the matter with you baby
Whatever happened to that first kiss
You couldn't resist
Now you're thinking you can do better than this
Ooh whats the matter with you baby
Do you only want the ones
That you know you can't have
True love so much better than that
Yeah you move so fast
That you never could know
Yeah there's someone out there
Made to love you
So what's the matter with you baby
Now dont you wait till your sweet smile
Goes out of style
You've kept your poor heart waitin a while
Ooh what's the matter with you baby
I guess you only want the ones
That you know you can't have
True love so much better than
Better than that
Better than that
Better than that
Better than that
What's the matter with you baby(Beth Nielsen Chapman/Annie Roboff)
