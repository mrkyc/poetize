And you say you'll never do it again
But you've hurt me once too often, dear
And it's just a little late to repent
All your beggin' and pleadin' won't help you
And your lyin' and cheatin', I'll take no more
'Cause I told you before and I'll tell you again
You liar, yeah, you liar
It's too late, it's too late
It's too late, it's too late
'Cause I know (I know)
That I never wanna see you again
And now don't you go
Tellin' lies about me to your friends
'Cause I've heard them before and you know it
That I've taken this long just to show it
So take all of your heartaches and leave me alone
'Cause I know, you know and they know
It's too late, I've walked out the door
It's too late to tell me you're sorry
It's too late to go any higher
Oh, you liar (yes, you lie)
Liar (I know you lie)
Liar (Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Sayin' that you'll never do it again
But you've hurt me one too many time
And now I'm afraid it's the end
All your beggin' and pleadin' won't help you
And your lyin' and cheatin' I'll take no more
'Cause I told you before and I'll tell you again
'Cause I know, you know and they know, oh, yeah
It's too late, I've walked out the door
It's too late to tell me you're sorry
It's too late to go any higher

Liar (I know you lie)
