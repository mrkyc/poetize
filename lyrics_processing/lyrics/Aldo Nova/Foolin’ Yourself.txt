But you're only fooling yourself
So long, I'm glad you're happy that way
But you're only fooling yourself
I saw you walk down the street
With somebody new
It's funny, people I meet
They talk about me and you, yeah
But who's to blame for our being apart?
Is it me or is it you?
And who's to say that you're still in my heart?
'Cause now really the best I can do is say
So long, well, it's sad to say
But you're only fooling yourself
So long, I'm glad you're happy that way
But you're only fooling yourself
So just go fooling yourself
It's funny I couldn't see
The change you went through
All those new friends that you'd meet
And the places they took you to, yeah
You might also likeAnd all you could say, you would say, "They're just friends"
And you laughed in my face 'cause you knew
And I'd never know where you'd been late at night
So now really the best I can do is say
So long, well, it's sad to say
But you're only fooling yourself
So long, I'm glad you're happy that way
But you're only fooling yourself, oh, yeah
So now you walk down the street
With somebody new
It's funny, people I meet
They don't talk about me and you no more
But who's to blame for our being apart?
Is it me or is it you?
And who would ever say that you were in my heart?
'Cause now really the best I can do is say
So long, well, it's sad to say
But you're only fooling yourself
So long, I'm glad you're happy that way
But you're only fooling yourself
So long, well, it's sad to say
But you're only fooling yourself
So long, I'm glad you're happy that way
But you're only fooling yourself
So go on fooling yourself
You're fooling yourself
You're fooling yourself
You're fooling yourself
