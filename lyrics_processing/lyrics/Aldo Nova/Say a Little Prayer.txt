Sometimes I reminisce
About the way it used to be
When things were not like this
The world's a ball of confusion
Goin' down in flames
Sometimes I think the Lord Jesus Christ
Died in vain
Because out there on the corner
There's a man on the street
He's got his hand out
'Cause he's got a family to feed
And the people pass him by
They don't know right from wrong
Dear God, what the hell is goin' on?
And the state of the world now is making me sick
Because the walls that separate us
Are ten feet thick
And everywhere I look
I see war, famine and pain
Come on, hop on everybody
On this hellbound train
And we left the world behind us
In a sorry state
I hope this younger generation
Won't accept this fate
You might also likeAnd I'm hopin' that tomorrow's
Better than today
Dear God, it's enough to make you go insane
But I know a change is gonna come
Soon we're gonna see the son
Mother Mary, don't you cry
Just sing us your lullaby
Free us from all this insanity
Now I hear your words
So you can speak through me
Now we must believe
In what we can't see
So we can be free
To make a change
Make love from hate
We must be strong
Have hope and faith
To see the light
Just close your eyes
And take the time
To say a little prayer every night, oh, oh, yes
And the state of the world now is making me sick
Because the walls that separate us
Are ten feet thick
And everywhere I look
I see war, famine and pain
Come on, hop on everybody
On this hellbound train
And we left the world behind us
In a sorry state
I hope this younger generation
Won't accept this fate
And I'm hopin' that tomorrow's
Better than today
Dear God, it's enough to make you go insane
But I know a change is gonna come
Soon we're gonna see the son
Mother Mary, don't you cry
Just sing us your lullaby
Free us from all this insanity
Now I hear your words
So you can speak through me
Now we must believe
In what we can't see
So we can be free
To make a change
Make love from hate
We must be strong
Have hope and faith
To see the light
Just close your eyes
And take the time
To say a little prayer every night, oh, oh
Before I walk through the valley
Of the shadow of death
I'll look at my life
But I have no regrets
And I am not ashamed
To say I've made mistakes
I'll say I've learned from them
Then walk through Heaven's gates
There ain't no black or white
To me they're all the same
We all pray to one God
But call him different names
So we better be ready to accept our fates
'Cause when the end comes
God, it's gonna be too late
But I know a change is gonna come
Soon we're gonna see the son
Mother Mary, don't you cry
Just sing us your lullaby
Free us from all this insanity
Now I hear your words
So you can speak through me
Now we must believe
In what we can't see
So we can be free
To make a change
Make love from hate
We must be strong
Have hope and faith
To see the light
Just close your eyes
And take the time
To say a little prayer every night, oh
Say a little prayer every night
Say a little prayer every night
Say a little prayer
Say a little prayer
Say a little prayer
