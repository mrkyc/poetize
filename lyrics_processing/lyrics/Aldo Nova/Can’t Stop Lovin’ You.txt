At times, your love was all I had
But now that love is just a faded memory
Of all the good times that we had
I never tired to put any chains on you
I tried to take and give
But you kept saying you had your own life to live
So do what you wanna do and be who you wanna be
Go to the end of the Earth and I'll try to follow you
And, oh, say what you wanna say and see who you wanna see
I'll always be there if you want my love tomorrow
You said I was a fool, but a fool couldn't understand
Or feel the love that I feel
So don't go puttin' the blame on me
I've got no reasons to give
'Cause I understood that you had your own life to live
So do what you wanna do
(Do what you wanna do)
And be who you wanna be
(Be who you wanna be)
Go to the end of the Earth and I'll try to follow you
And, oh, say what you wanna say
(Say what you wanna say)
And see who you wanna see
(See who you wanna see)
I'll always be there if you want my love tomorrow
And then there'll be no pain, no sorrow
