Could this be the end
A breaking point and I can't bear it
You wanna know the truth
The map to life is long
I've taken every wrong direction
Writing on the wall
Love once strong now falls
I'm staring into space
And drowning under my decisions
Wonder how you can sleep
At night
Having lied to these eyes
You could feel the relief
Lying awake at night
Wonder and know at the same time
To know his face and his name
Made me lose my mind
Fell apart for the last time
The signs neglected but seen
And thanks to you
My conscience finally feels clean
I brought you into this
You blame me over that
We fight each others accusations
You wanna know the truth
The truth is I'm afraid
Afraid of going nowhere always
Writing on the wall
Love once strong now falls
We're burning in the flames
Covered with the scars of our love
You might also likeWonder how you can sleep
At night
Having lied to these eyes
You could feel the relief
Lying awake at night
Wonder and know at the same time
To know his face and his name
Made me lose my mind
Fell apart for the last time
The signs neglected but seen
And thanks to you
My conscience finally feels clean
Lately
You just can't wait see
Wait see
To make me hate me
Hate me
And maybe we just don't belong
Again
Is this the end
After what you put me through
I feel nothing for you
Wonder how you can sleep
At night
Having lied to these eyes
You could feel the relief
Lying awake at night
Wonder and know at the same time
To know his face and his name
Made me lose my mind
Fell apart for the last time
The signs neglected but seen
And thanks to you
