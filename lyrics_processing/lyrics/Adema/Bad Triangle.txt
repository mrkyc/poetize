It's Rio Life mixed with Adema
Get choked like a throat hanging on a tight rope
To survive you gotta be a dreamer
I quote the fight might make you go psycho
We can do it live in the arena
Try to hold till your windpipe makes your mind slow
Say goodnight thanks to Adema
I chose taking my time so you'd die slow
You're still barely breathing
Yeah but not for long
Where is your mind
You've been caught in a Bad Triangle
Your life's on the line
Where is your mind
It's Rio Life
It starts with your mouth
Running that lip
Stop that unless you wanna see me drop that
Drop that
Without any clout it ain't worth shit
Talk back and you gonna see me cock back
Cock back
Leave any doubt at home with the kids
That you fought back like Bush fought in Iraq
The time is now so just quit
Or get tapped by the man with the hot track
Take that

Yeah but not for long
Where is your mind
You've been caught in a Bad Triangle
Your life's on the line
Where is your mind
It's just a matter of time
Now I have control
You've no where to go
You've been caught in a Bad Triangle
Your life's on the line
Where is your mind
You're still barely breathing
Yeah but not for long
Where is your mind
You've been caught in a Bad Triangle
Your life's on the line
Where is your mind
It's just a matter of time
Now I have control
You've no where to go
You've been caught in a Bad Triangle
Your life's on the line
Where is your mind
It's Rio Life
You've been caught in a Bad Triangle
Your life's on the line
