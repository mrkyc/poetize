You left a bitter taste in my mouth that will never heal to self-revealed unkind
You can never press rewind
You play the part that's so unreal
Repercussions now pay the price
Watch me walk away done talking now
Bridges burning yesterday
Won't put them out
Never heard a single word
Done talking now
Try to get through to me
It won't happen now
I find that you'll get me back sevenfold
Decisions in your life
I find gonna get it back sevenfold
Bury me alive
Right
You're always on the right
Your adversaries left the field
Signed and sealed
Lost sight
Cannot lead the blind
You point your finger filled with steel
Your huge ordeal denied

Bridges burning yesterday
Won't put them out
Never heard a single word
Done talking now
Try to get through to me
It won't happen now
I find that you'll get me back sevenfold
Decisions in your life
I find gonna get me back sevenfold
Bury me alive
You've been riding so high on one big lie all these years
Denied all my cries never thought you'd hear all these years
So crystal clear you'll cry the same tears we all did all these years
All these years
Watch me walk away done talking now
Bridges burning yesterday
It won't happen now
I find that you'll get me back sevenfold
Decisions in your life
I find gonna get me back sevenfold
Bury me alive
At the same time
Watch me walk away done talking now
Bridges burning yesterday
Won't put them out
Never heard a single word
Done talking now
Try to get through to me
It won't happen now
I find that you'll get me back sevenfold
Decisions in your life
I find gonna get me back sevenfold
Bury me alive
Watch me walk away done talking now
Bridges burning yesterday
Won't put them out
Never heard a single word
Done talking now
