I'll get inside you
I'll get inside you

Don't live with shame 'cause feelings change and fame remains
The reason why you're gonna want to take me home tonight
It's all the same up in this game, the people change
And money claims everyone from everything
I can't believe that you would think that shit of me
I was amazed at the torment that you put me through
If you could see right through the greed and all your needs
You'd realize that you're just about as bad as me

Sometimes I only remember
The days when I was young
Nowadays no one remembers
When they were young and stupid
(The way you like it)
Come on, baby
Help me, someone to confide in
(I'll get inside you)
Now you're begging me to stay

My life has changed, but fuck the fame, I'll stay the same
You can't complain when you can pay the bills and do your thing
Appreciate, don't player-hate, congratulate
I miss the pain and the torment that you put me through (I'll get inside you)
So what's to fear when everything is crystal clear?
You realize that you should do the things you wanna do
Don't give into what people say, don't be ashamed
To separate the feelings on your mind you can't sedate (the way you like it)

(I'll get inside you)
Now you're begging me to stay
(I'll get inside you)
They would always say I'd never be shit...
They would always say I'd never be shit
Well, look at me now! Look at me now!
(I'll get inside you)
Now you're begging me to stay
