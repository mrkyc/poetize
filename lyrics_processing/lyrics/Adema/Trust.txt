Let me breathe
Let me breathe

I can't even think right now
Something's got me feeling guilty
Hurt you slowly but so surely
I don't know why, love you so much
I can't feel because I'm lost
Not to much mad as no more

Is it you, is it me, is it us or is it trust?
Or is it trust?

Pushing into what I want
Because I am so goddamn selfish
Left you hanging, stopped relating
I don't know why, love you so much
I can't feel because I'm lost
Not to much mad as no more
Is it you, is it me, is it us or is it trust?

Is it you, is it me, is it us or is it trust?
Or is it trust?
You might also likeI'm so alone, empty and lost, it's easier to let you go
Time will erode the shame and the fault, it's easier to let you go
(Is it you, is it me)
It's easier to let you go
(Let me breathe)
Let me breathe
