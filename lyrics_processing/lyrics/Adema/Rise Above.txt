I walked out on familiar faces
Had to cut some losses
Learned to never be complacent
I searched for some answers
But the bottle couldn't show them
Which took me to some places
I never should have been
I found that true friends may be
The ones you rarely hear from
Cause many said they'd be here
But now they can't be found
Learning sometimes means soul searching
There are no words to calm that kind of hurting
I never considered myself fortunate
Bowing to circumstance
Searching where to place the blame
Selling myself short
Looked right in the mirror
Faced down all my fears
I will rise above
The endless thoughts that fed
The sleepless nights repeating
Almost let me give up the only hope I ever had
Trusting too swiftly can end up being costly
Because many people fooled me
Maybe I just wanted to believe
You might also likeLearning sometimes means soul searching
I never considered myself fortunate
Bowing to circumstance
Searching where to place the blame
Selling myself short
Looked right in the mirror
Faced down all my fears
I will rise above
The world can be so cold
When you step into the unknown
The streets all look familiar
That just multiplies the danger
There is one thing that's for certain
There's no one you can count on
The change occurs inside you
Got to make your own way
I survived
Faced down all my fears
I will rise above
Bowing to circumstance
Searching where to place the blame
Selling myself short
Looked right in the mirror
Faced down all my fears
I will rise above
Bowing to circumstance
I never considered
Searching where to place the blame
Myself fortunate
Selling myself short
Rise above
Looked right in the mirror
I never considered
Faced down all my fears
Myself fortunate
