I'm sittin in my spaceship
2009 lexus
I'm dippin through this gooniverse
AKA that Texas
I pop open my cargo hatch
And let'em see the payload
Me I'm shinin like a constellation cause I stay thoed
I'm the big dipper, just a candy paint dripper
And a solar system flipper, you can ask Big Gipper
RIP to Jack Tripper better known as Sweet Jones
We so high up in the air that we can't even see home
Through the clouds to the other side, deep into the sky
Can they make it? I can't see me as I'm reachin the Hori-zen
I'm just another satellite, floatin through the dirty
Its hard for you to see me cause I'm sittin on them 30s
I'm transmittin live from interstate 45
Its the king of the trenal, keeping the party live
So if you think you fly then playa meet me on the moon
As a matter fact, don't meet me there, beat me there, boom

I'm so tall...
I'm riding an elephant straight through outer space
I'm so tall...
There are laser beams shooting out my face
You might also likeI'm so tall...
I'm riding an elephant straight through outer space
I'm so tall...
Got laser beams shooting out my face

Right now its time to have a talk
Gotta feelin like I'm heaven sent
Excuse me while I kiss the sky
Please pardon my chester french
Animals be understanding you
When you hella bent
Got a crew of hannibals
Riding through one elephant
Go ahead and try lie
Get it in, tryin to find
What I'm in search of like an N.E.R.D
I gotta fly or die
I feel so alive no slowin down now
Its time to drive
Signed a deal behind the wall like Fasil
Cause I'm ridin high
This time I'm beamin up
I don't know if weed enough
In the shower for about an hour
Mirrors steamin up
And when I wipe it off
I hardly recognize the face
P I made it home
But I hardly recognize the place
Whats the point of livin when I'm always driven up the wall?
Whats the point of playin when they never givin up the ball?
So I self medicate, I'm never short, forever tall
Take a letter roll, it ain't a metaphor

I'm so tall...
I'm riding an elephant straight through outer space
I'm so tall...
There are laser beams shooting out my face
I'm so tall...
I'm riding an elephant straight through outer space
I'm so tall...
Got laser beams shooting out my face

I never rolled a spliff
I used to smoke a bit
But then I got over it
After I started noticin this
Fish flyin, birds swimmin
My nerves twitchin
Sometimes its as permanent as a burn victim
Mirages appear, colors form people that huddle
I see mice tacklin tigers in the heat of the jungle
Cavemen and tycoons could be seen in a scuffle
While hands with no bodies are so eager to touch you
Cartoons become real now I'm seein a pattern
Runnin laps around the rings of saturn while thinkin of malice
Check the clips from the blunt, go head look at me
Ironic I can pull a L but can't push a T
Mind faded, I'm jaded, my eyes tearin
Feenin of high places while angels provide blankets
No more smokin, to keep it real, I need a thrill
So tall Yao Ming look up just to see my heels
I'm so tall...
I'm riding an elephant straight through outer space
I'm so tall...
There are laser beams shooting out my face
I'm so tall...
I'm riding an elephant straight through outer space
I'm so tall...
