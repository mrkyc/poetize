I heard multiple tones
In a resonant hum
Made of layers of drones
I saw all of the planets
They were spinning as one
They were moving and breathing
As if they were one
Like a hum
Like a prayer
Filling all the universe
The most beautiful tones I have ever heard
They were spinning in a beauty of unity
And I heard this full prayer
Filling all the universe
We are one with the one
With the sun
We are one with the one
With the sun
We are one with the one
With the sun
We are one with the one
Who is the sun who is one?
With the one who is the one
We are one with the one
With the sun
We are one with the one
With the sun
We are one with the one
With the sun
We are one with the one
Who is the sun who is one?
With the one who is the one

Peace is an essential principle in nature
Not merely a quality to be acquired
It belongs to the innate essence in all things
And like love is a cohesive principle
Behind all movement there is rest
Behind all sound there is stillness
So that behind the motion and the music of the spheres, there is peace
You too, if you would achieve, must find that peace
No man can plead that he does not know these things
Messenger after messenger has come and spread the truth abroad
It is you who have locked up such truth in temple, church and mosque
And taken refuge in the courts of law
Self denial is unknown
And is displaced by denial of the self
Still you laugh contemptuously when told that love shall save the world
Or purity, or truth, or law, or sacrifice
You have hardened your hearts
Yet he still comes
The embodiment of love, of purity and of truth, of law and sacrifice
To teach you once again the ancient truth
Less war, and even greater war should take his place as teacher of the angels of men
Be of the same mind
One with another
For there is but one life
Which is the very essence of you all
It is love that will open the doors
What will your answer be?
Men of earth?

What will your answer be?
What will your answer be men of earth?
What will your answer be?
