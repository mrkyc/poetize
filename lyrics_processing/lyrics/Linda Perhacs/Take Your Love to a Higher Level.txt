In a shallow layer of your world
With a ceiling on which your life is repeating upside down
And your spirit cries out with a more combative will
And the loudest command as always to live
In an element incapable of angles
When you have given all that you can give
In an element incapable of angles
Where everything inside of you wants to live
With no more crying, in your sleep, making you weep
You've got to take your love to a higher level
Take it, take it, take it, to a higher level
Take your heart to a higher level
Take it, take it, take it, to a higher level
Take your life to a higher level
Take your mind to a higher level
Give it your all and you will see
Love comes softly and love comes quietly
Love comes only when inclined in our mind
To where love begins
You've got to take your love to a higher level
Take it, take it, take it, to a higher level
Take your heart to a higher level
Take it, take it, take it, to a higher level
Take your life to a higher level
Take your mind to a higher level
Give it your all and you will see
You might also likeLove comes silently and love comes gently
And love comes only when inclined in our mind
Take your love to a higher level
Take it, take it, take it, to a higher level
Take your heart to a higher level
Take it, take it, take it, to a higher level
Take your life to a higher level
Take it, take it, take it, to a higher level
Take your love to a higher level
Take it, take it, take it, to a higher level
Take your love to a higher level
