C Smoove:
We all on and I'm in the zone
Everything is in doubles
Everybody's got a clone!
You see two women so I see four
'Bout to back it up and dump it
Make sure it hit the floor!
All I need is a beat that's super bumpin
And a chick with a face something like LaToya Luckett
We both hands on
Something like a puppet
And her booty like a pillow
Make it smooth, wanna Fluff it
Make that back drop like a new song or album
I just wanna play all in your middle like Malcolm
My name ain't Dick, but I'm something like a Falcon
I'm fly as I wanna be, with all the womens under me

Yung:
I'm in the back off that Carnavaux
And the light on my neck like a Carnival
Is too many girls and I want them all
The way they bounce that thing like a basketball!
Call on my Willy, ain't talking about Wonka
She backed it up and dumped like a truck: Tonka
And your boy is home, just too fly
On my red bull drink when the boy passed by
She's looking like a Keeper
So I think I need her
She said her name was Nina
She reminded me of my heater
So I grabbed her by the waist, pulled her back
And made her dump it!
Criminal booty, oh my God, I could cuff it
Chorus

Back it up and dump it! Back, back it up and dump it!
Back it up and dump it! Back, back it up and dump it!
Back it up and dump it! Back, back it up and dump it!
And for you, you, you to back it up and dump it!
Jayare:
Hey, Shawty like a stripper
Look at them legs, she can't get no thicker
And if she did, then she would be fat
Back it up and dump it for me, baby just like that!
Hey ah! Baby let your weave down
If you ain't with the biz in V.I.P leave now
Cause Bone's get scummy and I like rhyming
So grab that pole, and slide down like Diamond
And her thong, it ain't no finding
All of that booty, big booty Judy
I think me and you girl should go and make a movie
I'm not playing games, just calling you for the duty
Chorus
All I need is a beat that's super bumpin! O.K

All I need is a beat that's super bumpin! O.K
All I need is a beat that's super bumpin! O.K
All I need is a beat that's super bumpin!
