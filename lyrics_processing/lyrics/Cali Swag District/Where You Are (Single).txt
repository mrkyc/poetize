Did I leave your mind when I was gone?
Well it's not my thing trying to get back
But this time let me tell you where I'm at
I wanna wanna be where you are
Oh ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Anywhere you are
Oh oh ohhhhhhhhh
I wanna wanna be where you are
Oh ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Everywhere you are
Oh oh ohhhhhhhhh
Answer this...
Could it be I should have came back in an orderly fashion
Girl I'm just asking
What happened to the way that we used to be?
Up late at night counting stars just you and me
Now I'm the star you feeling like you losin me
But I won't let you go, you don't know what you do to me
Like my religion you always stay true to me
That's money over women, but you got glued to me
I just want you back to light rooms with me
And in the back of my mind, jump a broom with me
Nah wait it's too soon for me
I just want some space in your heart, is there room for me?
Can it be I stayed away too long?
Did I leave your mind when I was gone?
Well it's not my thing trying to get back
But this time let me tell you where I'm at
I wanna wanna be where you are
Oh ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Anywhere you are
Oh oh ohhhhhhhhh
I wanna wanna be where you are
Oh ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Everywhere you are
Oh oh ohhhhhhhhh
Aye now that I'm gone I gotta testify
I wanna bee with you and I cannot lie
Looking at my phone another text inside
Saying how you miss me like I just passed by
Now I'm out on the road like the Jackson 5
Say you happy for the kid, but when I'm gone you crying
When I reply you get that high
Like that's my swag girl I'm just that fly
But you gon hold me down like gravitation
Cause back at home we was passed the dating
Now I want to see your face and I passed the waiting
Thinking bout a ring got the pastor waiting
Can it be I stayed away too long?
Did I leave your mind when I was gone?
Well it's not my thing trying to get back
But this time let me tell you where I'm at
I wanna wanna be where you are
Oh ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Anywhere you are
Oh oh ohhhhhhhhh
I wanna wanna be where you are
Oh ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Everywhere you are
Oh oh ohhhhhhhhh
It's 3rd back again
And I need you baby like oxygen
If I start from 10 telling you how I feel
By the time I get to one you would know that it's real
10 is your smile I ain't seen in a while
9 you're all mines and I love your sign
8 is no debate me and you look great
And 7 keep letting me know to have faith
6 is a kiss that I leave on ya cheek
5 no lies and I put it on a beat
4 so much more that we got to see
3 you just can't be without me
2 me and you always have a ball
1 I'm gon call so don't ask at all
Can it be I stayed away too long?
Did I leave your mind when I was gone?
Well it's not my thing trying to get back
But this time let me tell you where I'm at
I wanna wanna be where you are
Oh ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Anywhere you are
Oh oh ohhhhhhhhh
I wanna wanna be where you are
Oh ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Everywhere you are
