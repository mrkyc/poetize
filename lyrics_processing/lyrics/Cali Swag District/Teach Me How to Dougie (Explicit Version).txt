My name is Yung, for them dudes who don't know me
I know I'm from the west but I can teach you how to dougie
Step up in the club and all these bitches bug me
All these niggas dancin' and none of them know me
I hear da crowd screamin like "Aye get it Brody"
So I move my shoulders and I take it real low
They like "how you do that he can dougie on the floor"
And when that nigga stoppin' they like "dougie some mo'"
I'm like a nigga kinda tired and I pass it to the bro

And bought it to the hood and got the whole crew at

Back of the party I don't really like to boogie
I'm just tryna get bent and meet a thick red bone (Hmm)
She do her dougie and all the bitches hatin'
But I'm about to escape a bitch and head home (fuck it)
She got her friends so it's her 2 hands
And wanna run it even if her legs long
She like you my hubby and I think she love me but
I change the subject and I do my dougie
Cause I don't give a fuck, blow trees get money
Me Smoove half feignin' in back with Playboy Bunnies
We gon' make 'em do that dougie in the middle of the bed
And when I asked for some head the bitch looked at me funny
DAAH bitch you can't tell me nothin'
Started baked the beat and I just took it out the oven
I just hit the dougie when everybody clubbin'
And I hate skinny jeans cause the burner keep rubbin'
