Burn out, burn up burn out
Burn out, burn up burn out
Burn out, burn up burn out
Burn out, burn up burn out

It goes pedal to the metal
See me flying down the street
And if you really want some problems
Then I'm driving to the beat
My middle finger to police
And I'mma make my music blast
And you can never make me slow down
Cause my shit is way too fast
Drive fast drive fast drive fast (Drive fast)
Cause if you ain't first then you're last (then you're last)
Drive fast drive fast (Drive fast)
And if you're moving slow get the fuck up off the road


I ain't lost to a motherfuckin' Camero yet
I be flying 'round the city and in a mu' fuckin' jet
My nigga come correct, I'm sittin' on the set
Of big rims and big balls and I get big checks
You a rookie I'm a vet, my engine so fresh
Custom whip look good and it be gettin' me the sex
Hoes love it when I pull up, see that black hood scoop
What they say? They be like, "Smoove can we ride with you?"
Ay, I look like a hundred grand at the line
You just that little boy, I'm that man at the line
My shit so hot yo niggas gettin' tans at the line
My trunk so loud marching band at the line
Green light go, that's all a nigga doin'
Til these nothin' ass bitches and niggas, I just keep it movin'
I'm sorry, keep it Smoovin', get your weak ass out my face
And I ain't turnin' nothin' down so if you niggas wanna race it go
You might also like

See me in the streets and I be drivin' like a maniac
Catch me at the light, if you be sixteen you can holla back
80 down my block, my momma say boy you are gonna crash
I say I don't drink and drive so I will not be doin' that
Drivin' like a fool and I live right by a school
Got All the girlies in your school and I bet you're not a fan of that
15 inch kickers keep on kickin' back
A nigga hit a nail in the street and got's to fix a flat
Kush in my pocket cause the homie harren  holdin' that
Bad red bone and the passenger just rollin' that
Hand on the wheel one hand on the blunt
Got money on my mind cause a nigga gotta stunt
Married to the whip and I drive that bitch crazy
Need a new set of tires cause I burn 'em out daily
Motors stay hot, but the weather's so cold
And the tops stay dropped
Like the panties on the road
