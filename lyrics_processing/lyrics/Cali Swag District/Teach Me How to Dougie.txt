Ain't nobody fuckin' with my bro from Morningside
He go by "Bubba," and he hit that dance like thunder (Okay)
I ain't from Dallas, but I D-Town boogie
I show my moves off now, everybody tryna do me (Jockin')
I leave the functions, and all the ladies tryna screw me (On me)
Now you just do you, and I'ma do me (All day)
Niggas love to hate, so they try to shoot me
Bitches be stuck to me, I think they try to glue me
I make the party shine bright when it started gloomin'
This beat was bubblegum, so I had to chew it

The name is Yung (Yup) for them dudes who don't know me
I know I'm from the West, but I can teach you how to Dougie
I step up in the club, and all these bitches bug me
On a nigga dancin', none of 'em know me
I hear the squad screamin' like, "Ayy, get it, brodie"
So I move my shoulders and I take it real low
They like "How he do that? He can Dougie on the floor"
And when that nigga stop, they like "Dougie some mo'"
I'm like "A nigga kinda tired," then I pass it to the bro
M-Bone, show these cats how to do that
Down South dance that we learned a lil' too fast
And brought it to the hood and got the whole crew ass

Back of the party, I don't really like to boogie
I'm just tryna get bent and meet a thick redbone (Hm)
She do her Dougie and all them bitches hatin'
But I'm 'bout to escape with a bitch and head home (Fuck it)
She got her friend, so it's a two-man and
I wanna run it even if her legs long (Yup)
She like "You hubby," I think she love me
But, I change the subject and I do my Dougie (Ha)
'Cause I don't give a fuck, blow trees, get money
Me, Smoove, Heff in the back with Playboy bunnies
We gon' make em do the Dougie in the middle of the bed
And when I asked for some head, this bitch looked at me funny
Dawg, bitch, you can't tell me nothin'
Star made the beat, and I just took it out the oven
I just see the Dougie when everybody clubbin'
And I hate skinny jeans 'cause the burner keep rubbin'
