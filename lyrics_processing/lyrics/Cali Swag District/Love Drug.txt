I'm tryna hit that pussy like I hit that weed
Be high all night, but I ain't tryna fall asleep
I'mma give it to ya good and make ya never wanna leave
I know you tired of ya nigga plus I know ya nigga cheat
Shit, you need a real nigga in your life like me
You'll probably never meet another nigga like me
And shit I'd probably never meet another like you
We was just havin' fun, I wasn't supposed to like you
That fire got a nigga whipped
You be ridin' in a nigga whip
And when I'm gone be at a nigga crib
That's that bomb, baby
Gentleman, that's how moms made me
And shit you crazy cause your moms crazy

Pussy too good, got me on it
I'm drivin' to the pussy doin' a hundred
She got that "wake a nigga up in the mornin'"
That "when you think she done she keep goin'"
Put that on my mama, you ain't knowin'
Not a soft type nigga, a boss type nigga
Swish made my eyes go cross, my nigga
I had to fight with the pussy, I think I lost, my nigga
