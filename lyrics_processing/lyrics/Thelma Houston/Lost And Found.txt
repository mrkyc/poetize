I've been lost 'til you came around
I've been living in the lost-and-found again
Oh no, I can't let you say we've just been fooling around
I do care about what happens to you
And it's true, I feel like I've been living in the lost-and-found
I've been lost 'til I found you
When you gonna call me up and say you love me?
When you gonna let me know your love is real?
I can change, my life re-arrange
When you gonna let me know, just how you feel?
Ooh...
I've been living in the lost-and-found
I've been lost 'til you came around
I've been living in the lost-and-found again
I've been living
I've been living in the lost-and-found
I've been lost 'til you came around
I've been living in the lost-and-found again
I've been living a lie
When I say that I can get along without you baby
I've been hanging and waiting, anticipating a call from you, yes I have
I don't wanna lose you, now that I've found you
I just wanna put my arms, put 'em all around you
