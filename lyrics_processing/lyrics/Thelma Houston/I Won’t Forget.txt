I wanna tell you a little story
Just when I needed a friend
My lucky day looking over my shoulder
I opened my heart and you walked in
Threw out the blues, started over
Around every corner you came
Lifting me up, troubles tumbling down
So much in love, so unashamed
I wish I could share what I've found
But there's no way I can thank you
For all that you do
I promise you that
I won't (ooh) forget
The day you (yeah) came to me
And I won't (said I won't) forget
The love you gave to me
Say, have you ever noticed my love
How every head turns, when we're walking together
They all want a picture of
A something, that looks like forever
But other loves, how they come and they go
But you see, we've got it all
You might also likeI won't forget
The day you (I won't forget it, baby) came to me
And I won't (I said I won't) forget
The love you gave to me (it's been so good to me)
I won't (no, baby) forget
The day you came to me
And I won't (I'm so glad for you) forget
The love you gave to me
Oh, yeah
I said, I won't ever forget about you, baby
You've been so good to me, oh!
There's no way that I can thank you
But I'd like to try, yes I would (I'd like to try, yeah)
Let's get just a little bit closer
And we can unwind
And let time go by, because
I won't forget
The day you (I won't ever forget about it, baby) came to me
And I won't forget (hey, yeah)
The love you gave to me (ooh)
I won't forget (hey...)
The day you came to me
And I won't (no I won't) forget
The love you (I won't ever forget about you, baby) gave to me
I won't forget, I won't forget, no
What you've done for me
(I won't forget) I say, I won't forget about you
(I won't forget) I say, I won't forget about you
(No, what you've done for me) I'm so glad the day you came into my life, hey
Woah, I won't forget you baby
I won't forget about you, no!
Hey, you've been so good to me
You're such a sweet thing, baby
