When I needed someone to hold me
Your arms were open wide
And there was nothing that you wouldn't do
To keep me satisfied
But when it came to conversation
You turned the other way
We were so close, when the light went out
But we were strangers every day

Oh, you never did give all of you
And what you gave was just pretend

Baby it's true, you were my lover
But you never were my friend
Baby it's true, you were my lover
But you never were my friend
No, no no, baby...

It's so disappointing
When I look at you and see
All the things I thought you were
Are things you'll never be
So once again, illusion
Slowly fades my view
While I leave behind another dream
And that's always so hard to do
You might also like
Oh, you never did give all of you
And what you gave was just pretend

Baby it's true, you were my lover
But you never were my friend
Baby it's true, you were my lover
But you never were my friend

You ain't never tried to be my friend, no...
Yeah...

And you never did give all of you
And what you gave was just pretend

Baby it's true, you were my lover
But you never were my friend
Baby it's true, you were my lover
But you never were my friend
(Baby it's true, you were my lover
But you never were my friend)
You ain't never tried to be my friend
(Baby it's true, you were my lover
But you never were my friend)
Oo-wee, baby, I know it!
(Baby it's true, you were my lover
But you never were my friend)
Mm, baby it's true, you were my lover
But you never were my friend
Baby it's true, you were my lover
But you never were my friend
