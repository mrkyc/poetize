Get your act together, and get it on the fun
Oh, and get yourself some, ooh!

Any way you like it, you ain't got nothing to lose
It's on you what you do
So get down, down, down, mm

You better get it together, and get a good grip
Stop shuckin' and jivin', you better handle it
You know what it takes to get it, oh yes, you do
It takes much more to keep it
