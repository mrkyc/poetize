Nothing left to give, nothing left to give, baby
Nothing left to give, nothing left to give, baby

I gave you all of my love, baby
Then you turned and you threw it aside
And now you say you want me back, baby
And that you're gonna make things right
Well, you're gonna have to need me, baby
(Need me, need me)
A lot more than you did before

'Cause you left me so empty (left me so empty)
I don't know, I don't really know for sure...
(I don't, don't really know)

I've got nothing left to give, nothing left to give you, baby
(Nothing left to give, nothing left to give, baby)
I've got nothing left to give, nothing left to give right now
(Nothing left to give, nothing left to give, baby)
'Cause I've got nothing left to give ya (got nothing)
Nothing left to give ya (got nothing)
Anymore (anymore), anymore (anymore)
You might also like
(Nothing left to give, nothing left to give, baby)
I've got nothing
(Nothing left to give, nothing left to give, baby)
Anymore...

Love... is not a thing that you
Can turn off and turn it on
And you know I've given you everything
(Everything, honey) everything, everything, honey
And still, you still did treat me wrong
You drained me so dry from weeping (lying, lying)
And why, I still don't know

There was too many lies (too many lies)
There's no tears left to cry (tears left to cry)
Show me love, oh please, I won't go... (baby, baby)

(Nothing left to give, nothing left to give, baby)
I've got nothing left to give to give you, baby
(Nothing left to give, nothing left to give, baby)
You're gonna have to take me, as I am right now
Nothing left to give ya (got nothing)
Nothing left to give ya (I got nothing)
Anymore (anymore), anymore (anymore)
Anymore, oh baby...
(Nothing left to give, nothing left to give, baby)
Nothing left to give to you, baby, no (I got nothing)
(Nothing left to give, nothing left to give, baby)
Please accept me as I am right now (yeah, baby)
(Nothing left to give, nothing left to give, baby)
I've got nothing left to give ya
Nothing left to give you, honey (I got nothing)
(Nothing left to give, nothing left to give, baby)
Please, say you're gonna try just one more time, baby
(Yeah, baby)
(Nothing left to give, nothing left to give, baby)
Please, take me as I am this time, baby (I got nothing)
