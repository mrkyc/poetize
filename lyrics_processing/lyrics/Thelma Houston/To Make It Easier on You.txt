At times quite realistic
But a game all the same
Somebody wins and somebody loses
It all depends on whoever choses
To take it most seriously
But none of this matters to you babe
This little pantomime of mine
Would only bore you
You don't know if I'm
Only going through the motions
To make it easier for you babe
When you decide it's over
It's a play
Not written very well
But it's a play anyway
Someones a hero and someones the villain
It all depends on whoever's willing
To give themselves unselfishly
But none of this matters to you babe
This little pantomime of mine
Would only bore you
For you don't know if I'm
Only going through the motions
To make it easier for you babe
When you decide it's over
You might also likeWe walk the laughing way
Pretending not to feel
Pretending it's not real
And we don't matter either way
At least that's what I say
To give you no excuse
To tremble us before you need to
To make sure when you do
You won't know that
I need you
It's a show
Not always entertaining
But a show even so
Someone's a star and someone's a stand-in
Some have their handouts, some have their hand-ins
And some people need both hands free
But none of this matters to you babe
This little pantomime of mine
Would only bore you
You don't know if I'm
Only going through the motions
To make it easier for you babe
When you decide it's over
I'm gonna try to make it
Easier for you baby
When you decide it's all over
If I could say a gentle word
To make the inevitable passing of our love seem a little less final
Knowing that the heart can't help growing colder
If I could bear the pain and bitterness of our last goodbye
And let you remember the first sweet hello
It would make it all worthwhile for me
If I could just
Make it easier for you babe
I wanna make it easier for you
Yes I do
So you can just tell everybody everywhere
I'm gonna try to make it easier for you
I ain't gonna shed some tears baby, no no
When you walk through that door
I ain't gonna cry, no no
