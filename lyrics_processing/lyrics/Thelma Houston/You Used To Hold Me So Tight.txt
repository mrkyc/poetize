Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Woo hoo hoo hoo
Baby, baby, baby, baby
Ooh hoo
It's been such a long time
Ooh hoo

Hello my love, it seems like oh so many years
That we have shared the love and oh so many tears
The passion that was ours has seemed to go away
One hug and then one kiss is all that I've received today

Hey, hey
Oh, how I long for the old good days
Oh, oh, oh, I still remember, baby
When...

You used to, used to hold, used to hold me, used to hold me so tight
You used to, used to hold, used to hold me, used to hold me so tight

Ooh hoo
Woo hoo hoo hoo, yeah
You might also like
Try to get back the flame that used to burn inside
Inside your warm embrace our love is still alive
Break down this barrier we've built over the years
Forever keep me close, hold me, oh, so near

Hey, hey
Oh, how I long for the old good days
Oh, oh, oh, oh, I still remember, baby
When...

You used to, used to hold, used to hold me, used to hold me so tight
You used to, used to hold, used to hold me, used to hold me so tight
You used to, used to hold, used to hold me, used to hold me so tight
You used to, used to hold, used to hold me, used to hold me so tight

(You used to)
Yeah, yeah
Woo hoo ooh
Oh, how I long for the old good days (I long for the good old days)
(I still remember, baby) I still remember, baby
(You used to hold me, baby) Oh, how I long for the old good days
(Squeeze me baby, make love to me all the time, baby)
I still remember, baby (I need you, baby)
I miss you so much
Oh, I miss you so much, baby
Oh, I really miss you, baby

You used to, used to hold, used to hold me, used to hold me so tight
You used to, used to hold, used to hold me, used to hold me so tight

I know our love is still hot, baby
Bring back the good times
Do you remember, baby?
(Oh, how I long for the old good days)
Remember how we just couldn't seem to get enough of each other?
Do you remember?
