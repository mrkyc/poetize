Don't leave me this way
I can't survive, can't stay alive
Without your love
Don't leave me this way
Don't leave me this way, I can't exist
And I'll surely miss your tender kiss
Don't leave me this way

Baby, my heart is full of love and desire for you
So come on now, and do what you've gotta do
You started this fire down in my soul
Now, can't you see it's burning out of control?
So come on now, and satisfy the need in me
'Cause only your good lovin' can set me free
Oh... baby, my heart is full of love and desire for you
So come on now, and do what you've gotta do
You started this fire down in my soul
Now, can't you see it's burning out of control?
So come on now, and satisfy the need in me
'Cause only your good lovin' can set me free
Only your good lovin' can set me free
(Set me free, set me free), hey
You might also like
Don't leave me this way
Don't you understand that I'm at your command?
Oh baby, please, don't leave me this way
No no no, baby, don't leave me this way
It would be wrong to just string along
A love so true, baby, don't you leave me this way

Oh... baby, my heart is full of love and desire for you
So come on now, and do what you've gotta do
You started this fire down in my soul
Now, can't you see it's burning out of control?
So come on now, and satisfy the need in me
'Cause only your good lovin' is gonna set me free

Hey, hey, I need your lovin', baby (please)
I need it, I need it (please, please don't go)
I need your love right now, right now
Right now, right now, baby (please)
(Please, please don't go) ooh, baby
You see darlin', your love is so important to me
(Please, please, please don't go)
