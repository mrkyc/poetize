Wake up and my bees are buzzin'
I roll over to some of your lovin'
Little Saturday coffee sippin'
I'm thinkin' 'bout a little road trippin'
We've got sometime for wastin'
Who knows what's out there waitin'?

Hey, hey, what do you say?
Pack our bags and fill up the tank
Find ourselves a brand new place to fall in love again
Go, go, where we don't know
When I'm with you one thing's for sure
Your hand feels good in mine from the passenger side
Baby, let's take a ride

(Ba-ba-da-bu-ba-ba-ba-ba-do)
Baby, let's take a ride
(Ba-ba-da-bu-ba-ba-ba-ba-do)

Lots of possibilities, lose reception and find a beach
Mix up a little Malibu or climb to a higher altitude
You and me, a mini vacation
It could be any destination
You might also like
Hey, hey, what do you say?
Pack our bags and fill up the tank
Find ourselves a brand new place to fall in love again
Go, go, where we don't know
When I'm with you one thing's for sure
Your hand feels good in mine from the passenger side
Baby, let's take a ride

(Ba-ba-da-bu-ba-ba-ba-ba-do)
Baby, let's take a ride
(Ba-ba-da-bu-ba-ba-ba-ba-do)

It's the weekend, we can get away, why wait?
Let's get swept away
Dreamin' while I'm wide awake 'bout this escape
Come on, babe

Hey, hey, what do you say?
Pack our bags and fill up the tank
Find ourselves a brand new place to fall in love again
Go, go, where we don't know
When I'm with you one thing's for sure
Your hand feels good in mine from the passenger side
Your hand feels good in mine from the passenger side
Baby, let's take a ride
(Ba-ba-da-bu-ba-ba-ba-ba-do)
Oh, baby, let's take a ride
(Ba-ba-da-bu-ba-ba-ba-ba-do)
Ooh, yeah, let's take a ride
(Ba-ba-da-bu-ba-ba-ba-ba-do)
Mm, let's take a ride
(Ba-ba-da-bu-ba-ba-ba-ba-do)
Ooh
