She's dressed to kill and if you let her she will
Short skirts mark the way she flirts
She'll jump, jump, jump around
As the boys convert
It's the way
They'll follow
Back to her place
Single-file
It's the days
She falls on
Onto her face
Case the prologue
It's the way she'll pose
And her heart will never know
There you go little miss unwind
Vanity holds your frame of mind
Don't you care, are you leading
When you sleep girl, tell me are you breathing
There you go, little miss unwind
Vanity holds your frame of mind
Don't you care
When you sleep girl, tell me are you breathing
You might also likeWill this be wasted on lines that you tasted
Crowded aisles in a fitting form of guile
Suggests you're ill, the girl's built to spill
And it hurts, with the way she flirts
She'll touch the ground
As the boys converse
It's the days
She's hollow
Tries to retrace
Hard to follow
It's the way
They're all on
Onto replace
Where she went wrong
It's the way this goes
She'll set this room aglow
There you go little miss unwind
Vanity holds your frame of mind
Don't you care, are you leading
When you sleep girl, tell me are you breathing?
There you go, little miss unwind
Vanity holds your frame of mind
Don't you care
When you sleep girl, tell me are you breathing?
Will this be wasted on lines that you tasted?
Will this be wasted on lines that you tasted?
Will this be wasted on lines that you tasted?
Will this be wasted on lines that you tasted?
I used to love everything about her
But love's about her a little too much
I tried it all making sense without her
A girl hooked red lost her sense of touch
I used to love everything about her
But love's about her a little too much
I tried it all making sense without her
A girl hooked red lost her sense of touch
Little miss unwind
There you go little miss unwind
Vanity holds your frame of mind
Don't you care, are you leading
When you sleep girl, tell me are you breathing?
There you go, little miss unwind
Vanity holds your frame of mind
Don't you care
When you sleep girl, tell me are you breathing?
