Yeah you know our lips are on fire
'Cause you know we cannot lie
Just a runaway wanna run away darling
Guess you have to walk from a kiss
With the way you walked in me
Just another lie on a beautiful while
'Cause if we gonna lay all morn
We ain't caught up in pretend
We have nothing on the gain
Pretend, pretend we can't forget
It's all in your head
Forget you say forget
Tell me if I turn around, don't leave
Love me but you running out on me
Strange leaving note before I sleep
There's no air left to breathe
When there's no air left to breathe
