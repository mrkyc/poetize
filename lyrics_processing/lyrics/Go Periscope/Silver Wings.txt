She's tearing at the seams
I'm guessing but I think
That it's alright
Oh my!
Visions of the dead
Falling through my head
And the silver wings are going
Now in the clouds that block the dark
And the silver wings are going
Now in the crowds with everyone
The fire's gonna burn me down
You've gotta put me out
You've gotta put me out
I'm just a victim of a hungry crowd
You've gotta help me up
You've gotta drag me off the ground
Are you gonna let me drown?
You've gotta pull me out
You've gotta pull me out
From under shadows of a heavy cloud
You've gotta help me up
You've gotta drag me off the ground

She's broken and it seems
The terror that we see
Is in my mind
Oh my!
It's like they're dipped in red
All reaching for my head
And the silver wings are going
Now in the clouds that block the dark
And the silver wings are going
Now in the crowds with everyone
The fire's gonna burn me down
You've gotta put me out
You've gotta put me out
I'm just a victim of a hungry crowd
You've gotta help me up
You've gotta drag me off the ground
Are you gonna let me drown?
You've gotta pull me out
You've gotta pull me out
From under shadows of a heavy cloud
You've gotta help me up
You've gotta drag me off the ground
They're reaching for my head
It's like they dipped it in red
The terror that- that I see
And my mind won't let me leave
Dark sky, red eye
The fire's gonna burn me down
You've gotta put me out
You've gotta put me out
I'm just a victim of a hungry crowd
You've gotta help me up
You've gotta drag me off the ground
Are you gonna let me drown?
You've gotta pull me out
You've gotta pull me out
From under shadows of a heavy cloud
You've gotta help me up
