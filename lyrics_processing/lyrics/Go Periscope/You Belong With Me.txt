You're on the phone with your boyfriend
He's upset
He's going off about something that you said
'cause he doesn't get your humor like I do
I'm in the room
It's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listenin' to the kind of music he doesn't like
He'll never know your story like I do
'cause he pops collars
I rock Converse
He plays football
And I wouldn't bother
Dreaming 'bout the day
When you wake up and find
That what you're looking for
Has been here the whole time
If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me
You belong with me
You might also likeWalking the streets with you in your skinny jeans
I can't help thinkin' this is how it ought to be
Laughin' on a park bench, thinkin' to myself
Isn't this easy?
And you've got a smile that can light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while since he brought you down
You say you're fine, I know you're better than that
Hey, wha'cha doin' with a boy like that?
'cause he's so popular
I'm just awkward
He plays football
And I wouldn't bother
Dreamin' 'bout the day when you wake up and find
That what you're lookin' for has been here the whole time
If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me
You belong with me
Standing by, and waiting out your back door
All this time, how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me
You belong with me
(you're...)
Ooh, I remember you
Driving to my house
In the middle of the night
I'm the one that makes you laugh
When you know you're 'bout to cry
And I know your favorite songs
And you tell me 'bout your dreams
Think I know where you belong
Think I know it's with me
Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you?
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me
Standing by, and waiting out your back door
All this time, how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me
You belong with me
You belong with me
Have you ever thought, just maybe
You belong with me
