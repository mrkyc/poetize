She's got the look, she makes me feel, I'm slipping out of my mind
And with these blood stained lips in perpetual red
I hold my breath to keep from moving, hold my breath 'til I'm dead
I hold my breath 'til I'm dead
Lips, legs, curves, it's like she's one of a kind
She's got the look, she makes me feel, I'm slipping out of my mind
And with those blood stained lips in perpetual red
I hold my breath to keep from moving, hold my breath 'til I'm dead
I don't know, I, I don't know who she is
I don't care, I, I do whatever she says
I don't know, I, I don't know who she is
I don't care, I, I do whatever she says
But she could bite down, set it
Makes your heart pound steady
'Cause we're rollin' with the dead now
Rollin' with the dead now
Bite quick, and it makes your heart skip, steady
'Cause we're rollin' with the dead now
Rollin' with the dead now
Why don't you come down? I, I just wanted to feel
You're tearing into my skin, and that's just part of the deal
And when the hit drops, hit, kick, pulse, stop, stop
I take a breath to keep from moving
Take a breath 'til I'm not
You might also likeI don't know, I, I don't know who she is
I don't care, I, I do whatever she says
I don't know, I, I don't know who she is
I don't care, I, I do whatever she says
Bite down, set it, bite down, set it
Makes your heart pound steady
'Cause we're rollin' with the dead now
Rollin' with the dead now
Bite quick, and it makes your heart skip, steady
'Cause we're rollin' with the dead now
Rollin' with the dead now
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
She's got no heartbeat
She's got no heartbeat
She's got no heartbeat
She's got no heartbeat
She's got no, she's got no, she's got no
Bite down
Bite down, set it, bite down, set it
Makes your heart pound steady
'Cause we're rollin' with the dead now
Rollin' with the dead now
Bite quick, and it makes your heart skip, steady
'Cause we're rollin' with the dead now
Rollin' with the dead now
Bite down, set it, bite down, set it
Makes your heart pound steady
'Cause we're rollin' with the dead now
Rollin' with the dead now
Bite quick, and it makes your heart skip, steady
'Cause we're rollin' with the dead now
Rollin' with the dead now
Bite down, heart pound
Got no heartbeat
Bite quick, heart starts
