We are the ones that fall in love with peace
We've wondered aimless in the sea beyond the seas
We'd tell the stories of the untold seas
To find a place where we can break away
Inject our bodies into outer space
Cross out the letters just to misbehave
Fall out of favor with the ones you saved
It was only a dream but it was just like
It was just like, it was just like heaven
It was only a dream, but it was just like we were just like
We were just like, we were just like lovers
Lovers, lovers, lovers, lovers
We are the ones who live in fantasy
We are the ones they left in disbelief
We've wondered aimlessly through time and space
We've told the stories they would never believe
To find a place where we could hide away
Collect the memories and watch them flay
Cross out the letters just to disobey
Fall out of favor with the ones you saved

It was just like, it was just like heaven
It was only a dream, but it was just like we were just like
We were just like, we were just like lovers
Lovers, lovers, lovers, lovers
It was only a dream but it was just like we were just like
We were just like, we were just like lovers
It was only a dream but it was just like we were just like
We were just like, we were just like lovers
It was only a dream but it was just like
It was just like, it was just like heaven
It was only a dream, but it was just like we were just like
We were just like, we were just like lovers
