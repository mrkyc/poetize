Over the hill of flannel covered trees
I wag my tail until the rooftops disappear
Under the sound of stars that fish for dreams that never come
But like the rain they start to heal

I don't want to wait
I don't want to miss you
I don't want to wait
I don't want to go
I don't want to wait
I don't want to miss you
I don't want to wait
I don't want to go, no

Want a way, want a way, want a way
Want a way to get away but
But I wait, but I wait, but I wait
But I wait for you
Got a way, got a way, got a way
Got a wait to get away but
I don't want to wait
I don't want to go, no
You might also like
Okay now hear me when I say
I'm leaving winter for the spring
Can't feel the heat now on my skin
And then it stops just long enough
To shake my fist into the sun
Get back to doing what I've done

I don't want to wait
I don't want to miss you
I don't want to wait
I don't want to go
I don't want to wait
I don't want to miss you
I don't want to wait
I don't want to go, no

Want a way, want a way, want a way
Want a way to get away but
But I wait, but I wait, but I wait
But I wait for you
Got a way, got a way, got a way
Got a wait to get away but
I don't want to wait
I don't want to go, no
I wake in the morning
Wake in the morning
Get on my feet
Savor the moment
Savor the moment
It's bittersweet, I
I want to feel the sun
I put my Ray-Bans on, yeah
I'm waiting for someone
Someone who'll never come, no

Want a way, want a way, want a way
Want a way to get away but
But I wait, but I wait, but I wait
But I wait for you
Got a way, got a way, got a way
Got a wait to get away but
I don't want to wait
I don't want to go
Want a way, want a way, want a way
Want a way to get away but
But I wait, but I wait, but I wait
But I wait for you
Got a way, got a way, got a way
Got a wait to get away but
I don't want to wait
