It's the same me couldn't see the same you
Oh hell, how have you been, missed you too, how's your friends
Move step two and the circle never ends
We're us we can't seem to quit
It's a long ride so we might as well sit
Remind me again how the story begins
When everything stops and the room starts to spin
(Room starts to spin)
We're looking for a way out,a way out
We're looking for a way out,a way out
Never gonna let go, wooo
Never knew you spin so well
You're my carousel
A way out, a way out
We're looking for a way out,a way out
Never gonna let go, wooo
Never knew you spin so well
You're my carousel
Even in my dreams I can feel that strum
Everything you are is everything I'm not
Oh well let's pretend these rules don't bend
Move step two and the circle never ends
