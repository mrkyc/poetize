Without you, without you near
Falling back or fall away
I wish, how I wish you were
I, I don't wanna holiday
I'm so lost, when I'm without you, dear
Falling back or fall away
I wish, how I wish you were here
Wish you were here 
Oh I wish you were here
Wish you were here 
Oh I wish you were here
I'm not stranded alone these days
No more afforded hex dragging me down
I've got something new to say
But it's that same voice that won't make I sound
Take the blame
Take the wrong
Take another aim at us
Oh can't you break out for it
I watch you breaking
Take the blame
Take the wrong
Build it up from what we lost
Don't castaway, you're lonely
But you're not the only one
You might also likeOh I, I don't want a holiday
Without you, without you near
Falling back or fall away
I wish, how I wish you were
I, I don't wanna holiday
I'm so lost, when I'm without you, dear
Falling back or fall away
I wish, how I wish you were here
Wish you were here 
Oh I wish you were here
Wish you were here 
Oh I wish you were here
I won't leave us lost again
I shook the dark clouds tearing me down
The sunshine is coming in
Feel the warm, bright, sight and sounds
Take the blame
Take the wrong
Take another aim at us
Oh can't you break out for it
I watch you breaking
Take the blame
Take the wrong
Build it up from what we lost
Don't castaway, you're lonely
But you're not the only one 
Oh I, I don't want a holiday
Without you, without you near
Falling back or fall away
I wish, how I wish you were
I, I don't wanna holiday
I'm so lost, when I'm without you, dear
Falling back or fall away
I wish, how I wish you were here
Wish you were here 
Oh I wish you were here
Wish you were here 
Oh I wish you were here
Solar flares in the sky
Day or night
Feel the sunshine
The sunshine
Solar flares in the sky
Hand in mine
Feel the sunshine
