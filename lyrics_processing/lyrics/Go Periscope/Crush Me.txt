The dance floor comes alive
And the pulse takes to my mind
Through spectra lights I see you
When I arrive
The dance floor comes alive
And the pulse takes to my mind
Through spectra lights I see you moving
Shake the ground
Drown the night
Align for stars to shine
Take a ride, electrified
Don't sweat the disco
(Don't sweat the discotheque)
Don't sweat the disco
(Don't sweat the discotheque)
Don't sweat the disco
(Don't sweat the discotheque)
Don't sweat the disco
(Don't sweat the discotheque)
I know you
Crush me
Crush me
Rushing to my heartbeat
Don't be scared
Your hips will take you there
If you could
Just free
Just breathe
The air out of your lungs please
It's only gravity
Stay next to me girl
You might also likeWhen we collide
Send chills down your spine
When your beat's in sync with mine
Through midnight eyes I see you moving
Hype the dream
Dream the hype
Breathe it all inside
Take a ride, electrified
Don't sweat the disco
(Don't sweat the discotheque)
Don't sweat the disco
(Don't sweat the discotheque)
Don't sweat the disco
(Don't sweat the discotheque)
Don't sweat the disco
