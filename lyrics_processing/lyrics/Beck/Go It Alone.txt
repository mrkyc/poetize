I'm coming over
See me down at the station by the lane with my hands in my pocket
Jingling a wish coin
That I stole from a fountain that was drowning all the cares in the world
When I get older
Climbing up on the back porch fence just to see the dogs running
With a ring and a question
And my shivering voice is singing through a crack in the window

Na na-na na-na na
I better go it alone, na na-na na-na na
I better go it alone, na na-na na-na na

Down on the corner
See me standing on a makeshift road with the dust storm blowing
In a long black shadow
Pull a hammer from a coal mine down where your daddy was working
Comb my hair back
Strike a match on a bathroom wall where my number is written
Driving on the sidewalk
Looking back and the sky is burning in my rear-view mirror

Na na-na na-na na
I better go it alone, na na-na na-na na
I better go it alone, na na-na na-na na

I'm coming over
See you down at the station by the lane with my hands in my pocket
Jingling a wish coin
That I stole from a fountain that was drowning all the cares in the world
When I get older
Climbing up on the back fence running with the dogs that I'm coming with
A ring and a question
Dime a dozen and a voice that was singing underneath the window

Na na-na na-na na
I better go it alone, na na-na na-na na
I better go it alone, na na-na na-na na
I better go it alone, na na-na na-na na
I better go it alone, na na-na na-na na
I better go it alone, na na-na na-na na

Na na-na na-na na (I better go it alone)
