There was a day, saw lightning
There was a day, saw lightning (I saw lightning)
Hey, hey, hey, saw lightning (Oh)
Ho-ho-ho, saw lightning (Oh)
Hee-hee-hee, saw lightning (Oh)
Ha-ha-ha (Oh)

I saw wind and rain, saw mountains fall
Saw temples burn and prison walls
I saw floods coming, saw children run
Got no more shelter and no more sun
(I couldn't sleep last night because I-)
(Oh)

Then it came to me in a flash of light
By the sycamore tree in the dead of night
In the bottom barrel on the longest day
In the hardest winter, in the falling rain (Oh)
Saw lightning, saw lightning (Oh), saw lightning
Held my head up (Oh) and it struck me down (I saw lightning)
Down to the ground (I saw lightning)
(Oh)
And it struck me down, struck me down
Struck me down to the ground (I couldn't sleep last night because I-)
(Oh)
