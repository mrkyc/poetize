We gotta bring both sides together
Like champagne and leather
Like birds of a feather, we'll fly
Like rain on a sunny day
Like a million dollars that you're givin' away
Like a stray dog on a free rein, we'll fly (Whoa)

'Cause we're all like a team
Livin' inside a dream
You and me doin' our thing and we'll fly (Ooh-ooh)

Can't wait to see the one about the person who edits
And even better than that is who edits the credits
I bet I'll never forget it, 'cause once I read it, then I read it
I go to the theater about ninety minutes late
Skip the whole dang movie 'cause the credits are great
Now if you're gonna be featured on a movie song
The credits is the part that you wanna be on
