Mhm, hmm, no
We gon' push in anyway
How we know how, on sauce, hmm
Whatever you with, we with it
Ain't never lied, never turned 'round, no shit
Never, huh, nah' mean, know what I'm sayin'
We with it (Hey, hey, whoa)

I got lots of thousands, I got tons of bands
And I ride around with choppers like Afghanistan
Push up on a nigga, woo, I'm the Boogie Man
Hit him with a forty-four like I'm the Son of Sam
Hey, hey, we with it
Whatever you with, yeah, we with it
Say whatever you with, yeah, we with it
Say whatever you with, yeah, we with it
Say whatever you with, yeah, we with it
And my diamonds they hittin' terrific
If you want it, lil' boy, you gon' get it
We with whatever you with, hey

We with whatever you with
Woke up this morning, feel like I'm the shit
Said a prayer and I load up the clip
Hit the street then I jump in the whip
Hit the bitches to pick up the grip
Had an eight and I sipped me a fifth
He ain't gangster, I know he'll break
And bag up his head for some chips, you know that I did it
Hey, I pull up with choppers the size of midgets
See this sauce and this drippin', that's my religion
I'm a gangster, lil' bitch, like my name was Griffin
I'm a gangster, lil' bitch, like I'm Gordon
I pull up in somethin' important
Eat steaks when I sit down at Maury's
I'm gassin', a whole 'nother orbit
I tell you we spent it and they just absorb it
Look at my brother 'cause he had a warrant (Twin)
Came in in traffic, sit in the foreign
You come from the Hills and I come from the forest
You came from the 'burbs and I came from the street
All of my diamonds, they hit so unique
I just put spikes on the tip of my feet
I threw stacks of them thousands, they really on me, hey, hey
You might also like
I got lots of thousands, I got tons of bands
And I ride around with choppers like Afghanistan
Push up on a nigga, woo, I'm the Boogie Man

Hey, hey, we with it
Whatever you with, yeah, we with it
Say whatever you with, yeah, we with it
Say whatever you with, yeah, we with it

And my diamonds they hittin' terrific
If you want it, lil' boy, you gon' get it
We with whatever you with, hey

I'm the shit, damn, then admit it
No cap, knock off his fitted
Yeah, I touch down in Dallas like Emmitt
I'm really ballin', man, these niggas just scrimmage
Yeah, I'm ridin' in a foreign, it's tinted
He was pretendin', he playin' an image
I ride with a stick like the Wicked Witches
I'm a one-of-one, they know who different
I got water on me like a fish
I'm lit up like a tree on Christmas
That codeine and caffeine, I mix 'em
You too broke, I can't pay you attention
Ride with the Glock, give a fuck who against me
Camo Valentino, high-tops Givenchy
I'm goin' for it like it's fourth down and inches
Drip, drippin' on these niggas like I was rinsin'
I got lots of thousands, I got tons of bands
And I ride around with choppers like Afghanistan
Push up on a nigga, woo, I'm the Boogie Man
Hit him with a forty-four like I'm the Son of Sam
Hey, hey, we with it
Whatever you with, yeah, we with it
Say whatever you with, yeah, we with it
Say whatever you with, yeah, we with it
Say whatever you with, yeah, we with it
And my diamonds they hittin' terrific
If you want it, lil' boy, you gon' get it
