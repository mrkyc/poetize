Run that back, Turbo

Niggas wan' be like me
Niggas can't drip like me
Nigga, I drip like leak
Nigga, I get that cheese
Nigga, I sauce my sea
Had to put my neck on freeze
Might take a trip to Belize
Just to see my wrist go bling
They wanna be like me
You ain't got a drip like me
Nigga, I drip like leak
Nigga, I get that cheese (Uh)
Nigga, I sauce by the sea
Had to put my neck on freeze
Might take a trip to Belize
Just to see my wrist go bling

Nigga can't splash like me (Nigga can't splash like me)
Nigga can't spill like me (Nigga can't spill like me)
I'ma rock Chanel with the C (Chanel, Chanel)
Wish it was Chanel with the B (Bhanel)
I'ma rock Gucci on my feet (Gucci)
Dog got Goyard leash (Got Goyard leash)
Turbo and Wheezy on the beat (Turbo)
So I'm gon' eat like feast (So full)
Now I had to find my way
Diamonds on shine, might blind your face
Twistin' up tree, no pine today
You fuck with me wrong, I'm bombs away
You play with me wrong and that K gon' spray
A nigga drip sauce like every day
I turned me to a boss at a younger age
Too much lean made me fade away, yeah
Ayy, gotta take a nigga to a brazy place
Bad lil' bitch like Amazing Grace
I ain't had shit, had to make a play
Niggas so brazy like 808, yeah
Pretty lil' bitch, long hair
Nigga come drum like snare
Try to be me, lil' nigga, that's rare

Gettin' rich, gettin' lit right now
I ain't got moves like cow
Don't slip on your drip right now
Got a bad bitch, give me good mouth
She gon' swallow, ain't gon' spit it out
Oh, spend me some racks at the store
Ballin' like I'm on the Bulls
Ballin' like I'm takin' score
Fresher, they not in no morgue
And this is not love, I talk to the Lord, he tell me I'm blessed for sure
I vision the bucks, and sauce it all up, now I'm the shit, manure
Uh, all the way my diamonds shine
All the way they bling and blind
Want the drip, stand in line
If you pay mine, you dyin'
Hit you in your spine 'bout four or five times
You ain't gettin' guap, boy, you're lyin'
Boy, you're burned out and you're fried
