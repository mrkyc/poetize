We had a wonderful night
We had a wonderful night
Told her we can have a wonderful night, we just gotta make it right
Hey, oh

Lil mama she say that I'm bool, I told her let's make her some loot
Need that cash if I'm fuckin' with you, hey, whoa
She told me she wanna come kick it
And I told her let's start up a business
When you fuckin' with me it's no limit, hey
We had a wonderful night, we had a wonderful night
We had a wonderful night, sippin' lean and I got it on ice
We had a wonderful night, we had a wonderful night
We had a wonderful night, twist the backwood and then I ignite

We had a wonderful night, we had a wonderful day
Get some stacks and I put it away
Met a bitch and she came from the Bay
We had a wonderful evening
Man these niggas ain't havin' no seasoning
If you try to rob me then you dreaming
Man that AR gon' make him meet Jesus
We had a wonderful year too
Feel bad for the ones that ain't make it through
Lil mama she foreign, come from Peru
The bitch said she bad and on point
I'm in LA with Wiz smokin' joints
Want a show, gotta pay me a front
Put the gas in the backwood, no blunt
Got some people don't say what I spun
Got some people don't say what I did with 'em
I'm livin' a wonderful life
Free my dogs, they got hit by the vise
What they did to Lil Dae wasn't right (whoa, shit)
What they did it was dead wrong
Since then I been goin' strong
See lil mama from a ding dong
Got her in Hong Kong playin' ping pong

We had a wonderful decade
A million, I'm fresh and I'm gettin' paid
My bitch yeah she bad when she slay
In her Birkin bag she got that K
In her Chanel, yeah she got the yay
Do anything to get paid
Lil nigga just don't be afraid
I hope that I live for a century
When I leave this bitch they gon' remember me
They can talk all this shit but don't mention me
If they do nigga I'ma push up
I'ma pull up with guns out the truck
And I grinded boy, this ain't no luck
Bought a pint and I mixed it with punch
Bought a pint and I drank it for lunch
Bought a pint and I poured up my niggas too
We ought to be drippin' and leanin'
How I do it, I make it look easy
What they did to Lil Pig, wouldn't believe it, damn
What they did, boy it wasn't right
Took a bitch from a candle sight
Had to tell her she was uptight
And my diamonds shine like some headlights
Lil mama she say that I'm bool, I told her let's make her some loot
Need that cash if I'm fuckin' with you, hey, whoa
