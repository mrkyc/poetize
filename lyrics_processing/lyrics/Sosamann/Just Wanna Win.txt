I Just want us to win, blowing smoke in the wind
Forgies out of the Benz
I don't really wanna hurt no more
I just wanna see the top, I just wanna count guap
I just wanna drip sauce, see this flavor gone last forever
See this flavor gone last, I swear this flavor gone last
See this flavor gone last, Swear this flavor gone last forever
I just wanna drip Sauce, I just wanna drip sauce
I just wanna drip Sauce, I just wanna
I just want us to win

I just wanna drip sauce, I just wanna kick flavor
I ain't worried 'bout a hater, no
Step in with some Louboutins
Made a gater, nigga I'm a fuckin' player
Way over from the Himalayas
SosaBrazzy go Super Sayian
Sosa break on a groupie fan
Shout my twinz came from the bottom
Was wearing Dickies, now I'm buying Robins
Got a problem Tre Red dot 'em
Got a problem D Charles got em
Get 'em buried for a couple dollars
I don't worry Kahuna Matata
If she a quarter, then I'mma holler (DAMN!!)
I'mma tell her jump in, Baby I want the end
It's okay bring your friends, I ain't tryna disrespect yall
Baby girl, I'm tryna help yall
Right now girl ya lookin' lost
Tryna splash you a little sauce (SPLASH)
End the strippin' tryna take you out
So little mama won't you come my way, like Fetty Wap
(Baby won't you come my way)
Free Gou Wap
Young nigga tryna see the top
Young nigga count a lotta guap
I remember having visions, rockstar shit, Sosa Hendricks
Long nights I was in the kitchen
Serving fiends, and served sippin'
I told them this was gone happen, but they didn't listen
Now they hating from a distance, Damn!
If Pig was here, he'd be next to me
If Dave was here, he'd be next to me
