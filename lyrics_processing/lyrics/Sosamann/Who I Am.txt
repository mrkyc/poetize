I'm gone off molly, the Devil inside me
Don't stand on the side of me, know you ain't gon' die for me
TSF and Sosa in here with me
Pour me up, I keep drinking lean
Chasing money by any means
All that shit don't get to me
You know who I am
Z06 is way faster than a Lamb'
You know I won't spam
He get out his body, you know I'ma blam
It happened again, god damn
I gotta kill one of my fam'
I don't sing on the cam
These people don't know who I am

These niggas fake, I swear I'm realer
Shit that they say, you know I don't feel them
Whole lot of bodies, you know I'ma killer
Stepped on that boy, he played with my nigga
Big racks on me, taking a picture
Don't get too close with the camera
Under my shirt the hammer
Broke ass nigga, I'll nail him
I was posted in banks with Dale and them
Sippin' them lies, don't tell sell them
Through the North, run from 12 and them
I'm moving the bricks above the rim
Big Bank Sosa, and that's on Sauce
I'm up in this bitch with Sosa 'n' em'
And I put this on CBo, nigga you ain't getting close to him

These people don't know who I am

These people don't know who I am
Ayy, these people don't never gon' have a clue
And I know that lil nigga a Roody-Poo
And I'm stuck off the lean, like I'm sippin' glue
Why you toting that strap when you not gon' shoot?
Why you toting that strap like you big and bad?
With NBA Youngboy, we get him splat
Hey, I brought the lil bitch for the bigger bag
I'm rockin' all gold, but no Trinidad
I just copped a Franckie, it's all flooded
The bitches they hug me, they wanna love me
We kickin' that shit, like we playing Rugby
I gave him some drip, keep the money coming
I just poured an eight in a two liter
I just took my wrist out the freezer
You play and get hit with the Eagle
I'm gone off molly, the Devil inside me
Don't stand on the side of me, know you ain't gon' die for me
TSF and Sosa in here with me
Pour me up, I keep drinking lean
