(Damn, Quad, this shit bangin')
Nah, for shit sure, Quad (Ooh)

Smokin' on good dope, smokin' on good dope
Smokin' on good dope, smokin' on good dope
High as I can go, high as I can go
High as I can go, high as I can go
Smokin' on good dope, smokin' on good dope
Smokin' on good dope, smokin' on good dope
High as I can go, high as I can go
High as I can go, high as I can go

Smokin' Trap Sauce dope
Backwood what I roll, woah, woah, woah
Used to rock Girbauds
Now Amiri on my clothes, woah, woah, woah
Whoadie poured a four
The wave in this bitch for sure, woah, woah, woah
Hit the plug for a load
Got a bitch and she white like snow, woah, woah
Rockin' in the Bent' with the BBs
Simon say work, work, work like RiRi
Shittin' on these niggas, I ain't talkin' 'bout feces
And the bitch ate on the D like a kiwi
I'ma get Gotti, then put it on repeat
They watchin' me like a show on the TV
Used to serve pies like I worked at the Cicis
And you not smokin' on gas, lil' nigga, that seaweed
Higher than a motherfuckin' bird
Fuck what you heard
I'ma sip drank 'til my words slurred
Got a rich partner, he a nerd
'Cause you wasn't gettin' cake, had to kick you to the curb
And I got a hood bitch and she moved to the 'burbs
Just smoke a lil' weed, but she love poppin' Percs
Suck me all night 'til her jaw start to hurt
Smoke a hundred 'Woods, get high out of earth, ooh, ooh, sauce

Smokin' on good dope, smokin' on good dope
