I remember times when I ain't have nothing
Got up on my grind and then I got something
Now, I got them hating I just splash on 'em
I'm running out of patience, 'bout to spaz on 'em
But Imma get that cash and just stunt on 'em
But Imma get that cash and just drip on 'em
Cause I remember times when I ain't have nothing
I was really on my grind, yeah

I remember times when I ain't have nothing
I remember a time when I was fucking struggling
I remember a time when I was robbing 'partments
I remember a time, yeah yeah
I remember times when I was slanging nicks and dimes

I remember times when I ain't have nothing
Got up on my grind and then I got something
Now, I got them hating I just splash on 'em

But Imma get that cash and just stunt on them
But Imma get that cash and just drip on 'em
Cause I remember times when I ain't have nothing
