(Damn, Quad, this shit bang)
Nah, fahshitsho
Ooh, aye
Yeah, yeah
Nah, we gone kick shit out just like this
Ooh, know what im saying
Ooh, hey

Heard you on the bullshit, boy you need to stop
I done came from the bottom to the top
I done came from a kid with a dream on the block
To a grown ass man having whole bunch of knots
Never run in my life, 'less I seen me a cop
Type of nigga at the jeweler spend a hundred on a watch
In the kitchen had to wrestle with the pot like the raw
Did this shit on my own, nigga I ain't take hand outs
Scarface, you could say goodnight to the bad guys
I ain't talkin' Migos, I was servin' stir fry
Had to let a bitch go, she was having bad vibes
Cause I'm tryna do it real big, talking world-wide
Every time, nigga getting flamed no campfire
Up all night got me living like a vampire
Yeah, I sold white trap house looks vandalized
Now I go brazy on the beat gotta put the flow in overdrive
And I had to reach all my goals
Had stash out the loads
Now I gotta lot of paper no King cones
Cold nigga should've put a mink on
Have 'em at your hood shooting shit, no B Roll
Roll up the woods, nigga, I don't do the pre-roll
Young nigga winning like I put in the cheat code
Big blood, I'm a call a hunnid bands B Notes
Blow up like C4, bitch giving deep throat
On Sauce

Ooh, I came from hustlin' the avenue
I had to stack me some revenue
When you get money they mad at you
If you play with the bag I'm after you
Aye, I was out tryna get paid
I was out finding my way
12 was tryna put me in a cage

But no I can't go back
Had to make more stacks
Yeah I'm going crazy in the booth, ate on the track
Quad made the beat, and it had to get kidnapped
Shit so hard, almost had to tell it, "relax"
Big facts, yeah I sold dope and some Air-max
Keep me on stakes, when the bag on fat-fat
Duck ass nigga, I'm a call his ass Aflac
Had to send the P's back, plug send the bag back
Had to send the weed back, wasn't good, I don't know
One thing for sure, Sosa roll up the Indo
Had to cash out, Maybach for the benzo
I was down bad nigga used to drive a pinto
Now I break the bitch, make her send it through the Venmo
Getting to the cake, that is part of my M.O
I ain't telling info, wrist full of emeralds
Cop ass nigga, I'm a call him Carl Winslow
Rat ass nigga, I'm a stay away, so far
And the cup got Wock in it, no bar
Lil' bad ass kid I was breaking laws
Now I live like a big fish, sauce jaws
I got myself rich-rich, no facade
And you know I'm a big dog, no paws
And I was doing it real small, now its large
If a nigga wanna wrestle do him like Monday Night Raw
Nigga wanna wrestle I'm a jab, I'm a hook
Do you smell, wanna look at what I'm cookin?
I'm a sauce-dripping vet, and the nigga, he a rookie
I done fucked around and mixed the K.K. with the cookie
As a lil' nigga I ain't ever ever get boogie
Ridin' round with the automatic loaded and its fully
Right now I'm recording in a Dior hoodie
I'm a sauce ass nigga make the bitch sell, I could've
Aye, on sauce
Hey, nah fashitsho, man
Old sauce ass nigga
Yeah thats me, he is?
Aight, Aight, it's him
Slim with no brim
Just the braids for the babes
Drippin' sauce all mothefucking day
