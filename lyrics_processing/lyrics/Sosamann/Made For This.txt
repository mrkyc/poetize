Haaa, let me hear that (JRag2x)
Mmhmm, I'mma put big test in the way too
Not coming through, nowhere
Have to much money now
We made for this, on sauce

Tell 'em you made for this
Tell 'em you made for this
Tell 'em you made for this
Tell 'em you born to drip
What do you do when you sauce it up?
What do you do when you run it up?
You take all the money and fuck 'em up
And that's what you do, then you go tell 'em
Tell 'em you made for this
Tell 'em you made for this
Tell 'em you made for this
Tell 'em you wanna be rich
What do you do when you sauce it up?
What do you do when you run it up?
You take all the money and fuck 'em up
And that's what you do, then you go tell 'em

Tell 'em you made for this
Tell 'em you made it off going hard
The hate, I was there, had to play my cards
I earned all my stripes, like to show my scars
I keep me a pint with the longest rod
The bitch, yea she  me, she know I'm God
I went from a Buick to foreign cars
I'm rocking Margielas with Goyard
And these are Versace you retard
My pockets on junky, you bummy
You lame and act like a queer
I shine from my neck to my ear
I shine from my lip to my wrist
My rollie from Emmit don't tick
I came up from nothing, not shit
I came from the pavement with this
Young nigga play with the wrist
I was cooking whipping, like I'm a slave in that bitch
Product of my environment
Plus I'm a hood politic, and I still drip
Thinking 'bout buying a ship
Sail the Pacific and splash like the water and shit
My teacher said I wasn't gone make it
I know I was destined for greatness

Go and go spend you some money
And make it back in the morning
10 coming in on a Monday
10 on a bitch now I'm bummy
You play me I'll aim at your onion
You a rat, you telling on something
I just knocked me a bitch down in London
I just got me a bitch down in Paris too
I know that she getting it having loot
She exclusive, she rock them Bushemi boots
She say that I lean like a tower
And I fuck with her, send her some flowers
And she sent me that drop in a hour
While I'm flickin' thru series of Power
I just caught me a lick down in 
I just caught me a stack in the A
I just went to vacay in the Bay
And I had me a play bae away
And that's when I start touching the cake
And that's when I start counting the guap
Shit, I took me a trip on a yacht
Shit, I took me a trip to the land
Had to sauce up and run up them bands
On sauce
