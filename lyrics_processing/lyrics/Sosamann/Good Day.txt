Ride 'round the city, bad bitch in the passenger
The seats we're sitting on lavender
And I swear that you lil niggas amateurs
We the lead for the balancers, anyway
I had a good day, lil mama just hit for a thirty K
The plug just sent 'em right from the bay
You know that I caught 'em, I sold 'em, they bought 'em
But anyway I had a good day (I had a good day)
I had a good day (I had a good day), I had a good day
You know that I caught 'em, I sold 'em, they bought 'em
Keep choppers if they want a problem
We came with the sauce from the bottom
And I got the drip like a faucet
I kick shit with a model, my life is so awesome
And I had a good day, hey

I had a good day, that's perfect timing
The sun is out shining just like my diamonds
The top is way back and the seat reclining
See I am the truth and these niggas lyin'
I keep me a bitch, get them dollar signs
You know that we eat like it's dinner time
Know you not 'bout it so simmer down
We got them choppers for days
Glocks, they pop at hooray, but this here is not a parade
Got blocks and the blades, you comin', just hide by the K
Went from the back to the stage
A stack for the shades, kick me a bunch of the shit, gotta kick somethin', Johnny Cage
I'm hot like a plate, diamonds they wet like some water, might think my neck is a lake
Got racks in the face, I just go count up the guap, then I throw it in the safe
I'm enjoying my day, and I'm ignoring the hate, yeah bitch I'm loving my space
Lil nigga I'm far from a fake
I broke your lil bitch like a vase
On YouTube I'm drivin' a Wraith
Just know I'ma shoot you if you tryna take, hey

And I got the drip like a faucet
I kick shit with a model, my life is so awesome
And I had a good day, hey

My life is so awesome, extravagant
I done dripped on this big one by accident
The lil bitches see me, say I'm dazzling
Burnt through the packaging
I'm so fly, I be high when I'm traveling
Rocking jewelries, I'm feeling so fabalous
Pourin' up red if it ain't the Actavis, grew up with savages
Say I grew up with niggas that bump your melon
Say I grew up, caught cases, and beat the felons
Say I grew up and did some adjustin'
I know so much cake make 'em jealous
I know they gon' hate, keep a weapon
I'm sprayin' that shit like rose pedals
Might die but my heart is so tellin'
To tell the truth, think I learned my lesson
I went from sellin', tellin' stakes like a reverend
Whoa, I had a good night
Lil mama said boy you think you the shit?
I asked her is rice white?
I asked her do lice bite?
Do Florida have fight nights?
I asked her is Sprite light?
Look here lil bitch, you're damn right
