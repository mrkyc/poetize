I wake up with that money on my mind
Know I gotta drip all the time
Keep a freak and she fine
Told her do it for the gram, not the Vine
Do it for the gram, not the Vine
Do it for the gram, not the Vine
She in my DM's all the time
Told her do it for me

Looking at the Roli in my time
I remember I ain't have a dime
I remember I was out commiting crimes
In my own way I had to find
Got a bitch at my door
Sorry baby but my heart cold
Diamonds come from Nova Scotia
I told her I ain't the one
My chain shine like the sun
To the money, kept it running
Sosa  something
I brought the bitch 
Splash 
I don't know who is a drip
Gotta ball till I fuckin fall
And Imma keep a freak here
You might also like
I wake up with that money on my mind
Know I gotta drip all the time
Keep a freak and she fine
Told her do it for the gram, not the Vine
Do it for the gram, not the Vine
Do it for the gram, not the Vine
She in my DM's all the time
Told her do it for me

Do it for me, I got 2 or 3
Brought the crew with me
 you and you go get this D
Talking money everytime I speak
Fuck her once and now 
Sware to god that I'm a player
Young Khalifa keep that reefer rolled
Keep a bitch around me, but I don't need her though
And when you think about me, think of cronic smoke
I blow it by the ounce, she don't fuck, tell her bounce
Kick the hoe up out the house
I never change, I'm still the same
You niggas strange, you ain't Taylor Gang
My hoes insane, crazy in the brain
I beat her down when I'm in town, and never call again
I wake up with that money on my mind
Know I gotta drip all the time
Keep a freak and she fine
Told her do it for the gram, not the Vine
Do it for the gram, not the Vine
Do it for the gram, not the Vine
She in my DM's all the time
