Damn, I'm sayin'
Drip in peace
Everybody passed away in 2017
Free everybody caught a sentence (Ayy, ayy)

This for my niggas, this for the ones who ain't with us (Ayy)
This for the ones that's dead and gone and the ones that's sittin' in prison (Ayy)
This one right here for Lil Dae (Ooh), Lord knows that I miss him (Ayy)
To my bros gave a sentence (Ayy), middle finger to the system (Ayy, ooh)
Now every day, I just sit back and think 'bout how to take the pain away (Ooh)
Every day people sit back and think 'bout how to take the pain away
I think I am losin' my brain today, my bitch say I'm goin' insane today (Ayy)
I don't know what I'm thinkin', but I'm deep in my thoughts (Sauce)

Hey, we losin' our people in strangest ways
If it's not to the prison, it's to the grave
I got youngins that's itchin' to catch a play
Ayy, ooh, the police, they killin' like every day
Funny thing is that they don't get thrown away
Funny thing is that they don't get tossed out
I gotta stay loaded
In this brazy world, gotta stay focused
In this brazy world, gotta stay totin'
And it's brazy that they'll hate you just for growin'
They'll hate you just for glowin'
My partna got killed the same day his baby was born
My city got hit by a storm
Have some people gon' check for their people and mourn, damn
Ayy, and it's brazy the government do nothin' for 'em
They keep on makin' mistakes, you can't make America great
When you tryna build up a gate (Ayy)
When you tryna build up a fence
That shit is to me, it's not makin' no sense (Ayy)
That shit to me seriously some hate
And this for the ones who ain't with us today (Hey)
You might also like
This for my niggas, this for the ones who ain't with us (Ayy)
This for the ones that's dead and gone and the ones that's sittin' in prison (Ayy)

I don't know what I'm thinkin', but I'm deep in my thoughts (Sauce)

Hey, woah, I don't know what I'm thinkin'
At times when I sleep, I be seein' demons
'Cause my mama said, "Pray and believe in Jesus, son"
Ayy, ooh, I don't know what to say
This world is really a strange place
And you wonder why niggas ride with the K
And I sit back and wonder
How you walk in a church and start dumpin'
How you shoot up the concert from a hotel
That the people enjoyin'
How the cops is gon' kill that lil' woman
Go to court, found guilty for nothin'
The other day on the 'Gram, read a story 'bout a mother
Put her kids in the oven... damn
Some shit can get wild
Like how could one take the life from a child? (Ooh)
Some people are foul
Go 'head, step in my shoes, try walk a mile
Ooh, it get hard to smile
When the thoughts of my brother don't know what to dial
He in Heaven, I hope he look down
Lost my partna, he didn't beat the trial (Hey)
This for my niggas, this for the ones who ain't with us (Ayy)
This for the ones that's dead and gone and the ones that's sittin' in prison (Ayy)
This one right here for Lil Dae (Ooh), Lord knows that I miss him (Ayy)
To my bros gave a sentence (Ayy), middle finger to the system (Ayy, ooh)
Now every day, I just sit back and think 'bout how to take the pain away (Ooh)
Every day people sit back and think 'bout how to take the pain away
