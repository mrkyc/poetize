Hey
Woah, ayy

Twistin' up fat bud, sippin' on good mud, lookin' like a lightbulb
Young nigga got moves like a chess club
Took too many drugs, feel messed up
The bitch, she ain't right, she get left, ayy
Yeah I only smoke top shelf, ooh
Gold Gucci, got snakes on my belt, ayy
Young gorilla how I'm beatin' on my chest like ooh, hey
Twistin' up fat bud, sippin' on good mud, lookin' like a lightbulb

Young gorilla how I'm beatin' on my chest like ooh, hey

Sold me a lightbulb
Got lil' niche, I'ma show me a little love
Spilt on a bitch like clean up (Splash)
You ain't got no guap, you a dub (A dub)
Aladdin, nigga fly like a rug
You'll get smacked with the mug (Lame)
And you ain't got real stacks with the plug
Ooh, I got gas on gas like a gun club
I'm swinging that chopper like nunchuck
Break the lil' bopper and leave 'fore the sun up, ayy
I serve the lil' nigga like lunch truck
And laughed all the way to my safe
Got cash but I don't do the banks
Young nigga be drippin', drippin' like I came out the sink (Drip)
Too cold, I might do the mink, ooh
Like P, might pull up in tanks, ooh
Uh, why a lil nigga gon' do that? (Why you gonna do, whoa whoa)
If he shoot at me I'ma shoot back, ayy
Hit a nigga dead in the durag, ayy
Fucked her forever in the flavor last night
Nigga got a lot of swag, nigga gettin' to the bag, ayy
I'm doing a hundred, don't crash
I'm smoking the purest of gas, on sauce

Drip a whole lot of sauce, limpin' like a big boss, pimpin' out the big house
Chains on backwards, all criss-crossed
I'm the type of nigga piss a bitch off (Shit)
Bathing Ape shoes when I step out
Sauce bent the bitch, went and cashed out
Lame ass niggas want a shout-out
Chopper hit you in the leg, make you shout out
I turn the bitch to a cash cow
I stack them hundreds, ones fast now
I gave these bitches the know-how
But just took you down like I'm Chris Brown
Burn a nigga's pockets with that action
If you see my bitch, you shouldn't trust her
She gon' play everything cool
Then flip mode on you, you a buster
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme some more
All of my diamonds came off of a snow
All of my choppers, I cop for the low
All of my niggas came up from the floor
We got cameras that's on top of the door
We can see you from our cellphone
We ain't even gotta be at home
Get a nigga popped in the dome
Twistin' up fat bud, sippin' on good mud, lookin' like a lightbulb
