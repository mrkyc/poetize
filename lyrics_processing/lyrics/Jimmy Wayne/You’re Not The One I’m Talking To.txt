Won't be the last, sure ain't the first
Man who ever had a dream that finally got a break
So don't take this wrong i know i'm blessed
But what you see is what you get
My own interpretation of what's missing most these days
Identity, a real point of view
A little honesty, things we all could use

I don't think the world's all bad
That life is cheap and love don't last
In fact i think it's just a few who'd like us to believe that's true
I think most are sick and tired of all the hip and uninspired
Saying cool is in and good is out
I bet i've got your attention now and oh if i don't then
You're the one i'm talking to
You're the one i'm talking to
I'm tired of seeing youthful eyes
Growing up desensitized
By what they're seeing on TV, believing that's reality
That sex is love and life's a game
Where all the winners look the same
Designer jeans, expensive shoes, imported cars and attitudes
What happened to individuality
The right to choose your destiny?

In fact i think it's just a few who'd like us to believe that's true

Saying cool is in and good is out

You're the one i'm talking to
You're the one i'm talking to
I don't believe the world's all bad
That life is cheap and love don't last
That cool is in and good is out
Have i got your attention now?
'cause if i don't then
You're the one i'm talking to
