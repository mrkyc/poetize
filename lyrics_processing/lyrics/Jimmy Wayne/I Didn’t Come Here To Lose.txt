Under the cushions
Shook all my blue jeans
Spent all day looking
For enough change
To get the rent paid
Just so I can hang
Here another week
I've been passed on
Shown the way out
Worn out these steel toes
Kicking some doors down
Just need that one chance
Don't tell me that I can't
I've gotta do it man
Ain't got no plan b
I don't wanna go home
And give into all these people
Who say I can't do it
I don't want to prove them all right
I'll take my licks and keep on
Getting up swinging
Is that all you got bring it
So what I'm beat up and bruised
I didn't come here to lose
You might also likeGive me your 'heck no's
'you'll never make it's
All those cynical
Back handed praises
I'll turn them into something I can use
A little rocket fuel for my shooting star
Just need that one chance
Don't tell me that I can't
I've gotta do it man
Ain't got no plan b
I don't wanna go home
And give into all these people
Who say I can't do it
I don't want to prove them all right
I'll take my licks and keep on getting up swinging
Is that all you got bring it
So what I'm beat up and bruised
I didn't come here to lose
I don't wanna go home
And give into all these people
Who say I can't do it
I don't want to prove them all right
I'll take my licks and keep on getting up swinging
Is that all you got bring it
So what I'm beat up and I'm bruised
I didn't come here to lose
I don't wanna go home
And give into all these people
Who say I can't do it
I don't want to prove them all right
I'll take my licks and keep on getting up swinging
Is that all you got bring it
