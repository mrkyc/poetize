Ohhh

I've got to move
But I want to stay
Got to find me somebody
Who won't give me love
And then take it away
Listen
I remember the first time
I laid eyes on you girl
I had no idea you could become so important in my world
Like water to a sweet red rose
You were my number one girl you know
Been flowing with you like a summer breeze
Now I want to be free

(You found your way in my heart)
Say you found your way in my heart
(I thought we'd never part)
Thought we'd never part
(I've had enough of this)
Girl I've had enough of this
Girl you're blowing my mind
I'm about to split
Yeah Yeah

I've got to move

Everyday I go to work
(Same old routine)
All you do is lay around
(Keep on stressing me)
Saying things
Playing insensitive to how I feel
Girl lets be truthful
And keep it real

(You found your way in my heart)
Say you found your way in my heart
(I thought we'd never part)
Thought we'd never part

Mine, my life baby
And I couldn't see
There ain't no need
(For you and me)
For.......
