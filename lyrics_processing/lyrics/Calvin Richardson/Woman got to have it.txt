You know, sometimes we have the tendency, or should I say we forget, what a woman needs every now and then
That is if you wanna keep your thing together
Listen to me now)
Do the things that keeps the smile on her face
Say the things that make her feel better everyday
Then you got to stay on your p's and q's
If you don't, the woman you can easily lose
Whoa oa oa I, Oh I had a love and I lost her, and no one can help me share the pain that she caused me
Ohhh, a woman's gotta have it, I believe, she's gotta know that she's needed around
When you kiss her, you gotta make her feel it, everytime boy, she wants to know that she's not walkin' on shakey ground
Ohhhh, yeah
Well, think it over
Think it over my brother
Don't take for granted the smile on her face
Check a little bit closer, you might find a tear trace
Maybe the girl might never say another word, but you gotta make sure that her voice is heard
Whoa Ohhh Ohhh I, had a love, a true love and I lost it, I'm suffering all this pain that that love caused me
A woman gotta have it, you got to give it to her, she's got to know that she's needed around, when you kiss her, you gotta make her feel it, she wanna know that she's not walkin' on shakey ground
Yeah
So if you've got a love, and you wanna keep her, you got to give her what she wants when she wants it, where she wants it, and how she wants it
Every doggone time she feels she needs it
What I'm tryin' to say, a woman gotta have it
Hey, hey, hey, a woman gotta have it
