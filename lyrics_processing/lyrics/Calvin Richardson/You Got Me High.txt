You got me high, I can't lie
I wanna make you feel alright tonight
Said you got it going on
What I feel is so strong
Oh... Yeah
Standing here smoking on a cigarette
Fantasy of you just like that
You've got me on a natural high
You're tempting me girl, I can't lie
Tell me what your name is
You say you've got a main squeeze
And it's only he that can hold your eye
(Girl, I'm not mad at you)
(Do what you wanna do)
But if I had my way (really had my way)
(You'd stay and play all day)

T3 Chant:
Go head with yourself
If it was up to me you'd be by yourself
Go head with yourself
If it was up to me you'd be by yourself

And the sexy way you say you gotta run
'Cause you got a man at home
And he always check your phone
(And you gotta be there on time)
When he checks your phone

So...
