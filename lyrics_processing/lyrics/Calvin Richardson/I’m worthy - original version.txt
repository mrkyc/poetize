To get him to notice you
He don't deserve you
Baby girl, yes, I'm worthy
I feel for you, feel for you
You must be sick and tired of him
Putting everyone before you
Never mind the fact you lied
When you told him you were pregnant
And it wasn't true
And really hate to mention
Just to get some attention
You called him on his job
And had him come home early from work
To take you to the doctor's or emergency room
But you know and I know
But he never knew
There was nothing wrong with you
Look at what you have to do
To get him to notice you
He don't deserve you
Baby girl, yes, I'm worthy
I feel for you, feel for you
Look at what you have to do
To get him to notice you
He don't deserve you
Baby girl, yes, I'm worthy
I feel for you, feel for you
Now I'm alright with us being friends
But the fact the best man didn't win
Ain't cool, ain't cool
You're having, so many thoughts of you being free
Baby girl, should have just been you and me, ain't that cool
Girl, I know that it gets hard
You fell in love and dropped your guard
Baby, that was definitely the wrong move
Why would you go and trust someone
Just using you for some fun
Girl he don't know your value like I do
Look at what you have to do
To get him to notice you
He don't deserve you
Baby girl, yes, I'm worthy
I feel for you, feel for you
Look at what you have to do
To get him to notice you
He don't deserve you
Baby girl, yes, I'm worthy
I feel for you, feel for you
Look at what you have to do
To get him to notice you
He don't deserve you
Baby girl, yes, I'm worthy
I feel for you, feel for you
Look at what you have to do
To get him to notice you
He don't deserve you
Baby girl, yes, I'm worthy
I feel for you, feel for you
Look at what you have to do
To get him to notice you
He don't deserve you
Baby girl, yes, I'm worthy
