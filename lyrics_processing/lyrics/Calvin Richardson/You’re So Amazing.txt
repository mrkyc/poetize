Swam up the stream
Stood on the mountain top I swear it leans
Like Martin Luther said girl "I had a dream"
But I never stopped loving you girl ooh
You're so amazing girl oooh
I've only had one kiss
There's only been one girl that I miss
The only one to make me feel like this
And that's you (girl)
You blew my mind like the wind
Haven't felt this good since (I don't know when)
You can put your load on my back
This love is real so ready to tack
I done been to the river
Swam up the stream
Stood on the mountain top I swear it leans
Like Martin Luther said girl "I had a dream"
But I never stopped loving you girl oooh
You're so amazing girl ooo
Baby we're so close
Like the pocket on your hip
You do me so good
Let me take you on a trip
Around the world won't be long enough
If somebody's waiting on you they can give it up

This love is so good you make me say Oooh (oooh)
So if you're listening now you know (yeah)
I done been to the river
Swam up the stream
Stood on the mountain top I swear it leans
Like Martin Luther said girl "I had a dream"
But I never stopped loving you girl oooh
You're so amazing girl ooo
And if I lose my sight today (girl)
In the pit of your eye I could still see
The grace of your wow
That beautiful smile----
When you come to me
If loving you is wrong (I don't wanna live here any more)
I'd rather be gone (you see)
I will be the evidence that's wrong
Please listen to the words of my song
My song, my song ooh ooh
I done been to the river
Swam up the stream
Stood on the mountain top I swear it leans
Like Martin Luther said girl "I have a dream"
But I never stopped loving you girl ooh
