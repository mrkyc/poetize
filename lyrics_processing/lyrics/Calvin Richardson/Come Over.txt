I just don't feel like sleeping by myself that night
I think I'm gon' phone in, I'll call the one
That I really wanna be with is you, baby
Please don't leave me by myself tonight
Girl, can I
Come over to see you tonight?
Oh, I'm so lonely and I am in need
Of only your company tonight
Picture this
Just like a beautiful cup
That's left alone in the cupboard

It might confuse you
But it can't give nothing
To someone this thirsty
I need your love
And hope you need my good lovin' too
I'm singin', ohh, oh
Oh, baby
Oh, lady
I need you like stop-light need a checker
Like a roller-coaster needs a hand
