To stop now
I'll be loving you, loving you, loving you
In the morning
Holding you, holding me, holding you
At the noon of day
And wanting you, wanting you, wanting you
Late, in the midnight hour, baby
I'm telling you, telling you, I'm telling you
Girl, it's crazy
The weekend is here
And you've been on my mind
Five days of work and stress
No quality time
So baby, get at me
Any way that you can
And there better not be
Any change of plans
I'll be loving you, loving you, loving you
In the morning
Holding you, holding me, holding you
At the noon of day

Listen, can't wait for you to get here
And tell me all about your day
A thousand things we would do

Don't wanna hear from my friends

They won't be coming in
