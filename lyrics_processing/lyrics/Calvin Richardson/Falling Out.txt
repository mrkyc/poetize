Everything changes
You know
Even the seasons
If things are going wrong
We need to sit down and talk
Cause if we don't face this soon
SUNG:
(Chorus)
See the sun is going down (you're gonna live for me and now I'm gone)
And I'm falling out of love (yea yea yea)
I don't want to put you down (yeah yeah)
Cause you taught me how to love
And like a bee, I need your honey (I need you, I need you)
Cause I'm hungry
You started me
Listen
We need to take some time
And talk about (what's going wrong)
The communication lines are getting weak (they used to be strong)
We gotta get back the time when your eyes used to smile
Every time
Like a pillow on a bed so comfortable
This is an emergency
Can't you see you're loosing me

Said the sun is going down (hmm)
And I'm falling out of love
I don't want to put you down (no no)
Cause you taught me how to love
And like a bee, I need your honey (I need you, I need you, I need you)
Cause I'm hungry
You started me
Listen
Theres nothing in this world
Means as much to me as you do
Everywhere I go on Earth
In and out of town
Everybody knows (son that you)
It's so messed up
I put you before my mother
It's so messed up
I put you before my daughter
It's so messed up
I put you before my son
Now I'm in need
In need of someone
(Chorus)
See the sun is going down
And I'm falling out of love
I don't want to put you down
Cause you taught me how to love
And like a bee, I need your honey (I need you, yes I do)
Cause I'm hungry
You started me
Said the sun is going down (on me baby)
And I'm falling out of love
(I don't wanna) I don't want to put you down (never wanna walk away and leave you girl)
Cause you taught me how to love
And like a bee, I need your honey (I need you, I need you, yes I do)
Cause I'm hungry
You started me
Listen
When it's cold outside, baby
I won't be there to keep you warm, lady
I know you're gonna miss me (you're gonna miss my love)
I know you're gonna miss my love (you're gonna miss my time)
Somebody say a prayer for me (you're gonna miss my love)
I know you're gonna miss my love (gonna miss gonna miss gonna miss my love)
Gonna hide summer nights (you're gonna miss my love)
You're gonna miss me (you're gonna miss my love)
I know you're gonna miss my love (gonna miss gonna miss gonna miss my love)
(Chorus)
Said the sun is going down (said the sun is going down)
And I'm falling out of love
I don't want to put you down (I don't wanna put you down)
Cause you taught me how to love
And like a bee, I need your honey
Cause I'm hungry
You started me
Said the sun is going down (yeah)
And I'm falling out of love (I need you)
I don't want to put you down (oh no)
Cause you taught me how to love
And like a bee, I need your honey (I need you yeah)
Cause I'm hungry
You started me
