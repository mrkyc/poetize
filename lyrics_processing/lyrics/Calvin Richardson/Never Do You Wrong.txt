Me in a another woman's face
But sometimes my job takes me there
(I'm just working)
Don't let what I do
Come between me and you
(I'm just working)
'Cause, girl, you know for real that I care
I know it's kinda funny, I blame it on my money
But that's just the way it is
To you, it didn't look right
But to me it really felt like a situation
But I swear, I swear
It wasn't nothing more than a conversation, girl
That's all, we didn't mean nothing
We were just sitting here talkin', girl
You and I, we have it way too good
We been together way too long
Forget about what it may have looked like
Baby, what would I look like if I hurt you?
Remember, I'm your Mr. Right, girl
I would never do you wrong

It's inevitable we will disagree
Just like after the winter comes spring
And then summer breeze
But there wouldn't be four seasons
Without fault
We wouldn't be in love if all the time
Was spent being sweet
Yeah, yeah
The thought if you leaving me
Would have anybody shakin' like a leaf on a tree
Wanna take it easy on a Monday
Just like a Sunday morning, yeah
If you have a question let me answer it
I would never look 'cause it can never be
Better than this, love, can't you see that, yeah
That's all, we didn't mean nothing
We were just sitting here talkin', girl
You and I, we have it way too good
We been together way too long
Forget about what it may have looked like
Baby, what would I look like if I hurt you?
Remember, I'm your Mr. Right, girl
I would never
Look in my eyes now, my girl
Can't you see I wouldn't lie now, girl?
On your love, I'm so high, out of this world
And on your beach I found my pearl
So what you gonna do, babe?
Because for me, there ain't no time to lose, baby
You make me wanna shoop, baby
You're my boo, baby, my boo, yeah
Everybody wants the kind of love
That's good, it won't slip
But will you find love
Better treat it like a gift, yeah, yeah, yeah
That's all, we didn't mean nothing
We were just sitting here, talkin', girl
You and I, we have it way too good
We been together way too long
Forget about what it may have looked like
Baby, what would I look like if I hurt you?
Remember, I'm your Mr. Right, girl
I would never
Never, never, never
(Do you wrong)
Never, never, never, yeah
