You possess my body, baby
(Sexy girl, just stand up)
I feel you in my mind
(Move your hands like you're rubbing me)
Makes my heart beat, baby
Like rain in the summertime
What's this food for, I don't wanna eat, babe
What's this bed for, I can't even sleep lately
Unless you're gonna feed me, girl
You the one I want to put me to sleep, babe
You got me back and forth to the door
Peepin' at the window 'cause I need a hit of your love, baby
All my friends look at me crazy
But they don't know that tasty love I'm gettin' from you, babe
You possess my body, baby
I feel you in my mind
Makes my heart beat, baby
Like rain in the summertime
I'm never stressin', learned my lesson when you come around
You make it better, baby
I know them other angels must be missing you, girl
But if they think I'm lettin' go of you, they gotta be crazy

Told my mother the other day I got laid
She asked me how I feel, I know I gave her chills
I told her that it felt like I'm having a baby, yeah
Oh, momma told me, keep my head right
Momma told me, keep you at the limelight
Momma told me if I love you, give you what you want
(I'll take you shopping, baby, tell me where you wanna go)
(I'll send you flowers for no special reason, just to let you know)
Momma told me, tell my friends
(Don't come around when it's you and me time)
Even if they say it's only gonna take a minute
Ain't got time, 'cause that's your time
Don't worry, mamma, I got this
You, you, you got my mind, oh
You make me feel so crunk, girl
When I talk about her, in my throat, I get a lump
(Let's go, baby)
You possess my body, baby
I feel you in my mind
Makes my heart beat, baby
Like rain in the summertime
You possess my body, baby
I feel you in my mind
Makes my heart beat, baby
Like rain in the summertime
You possess my body, baby
I feel you in my mind
Makes my heart beat, baby
