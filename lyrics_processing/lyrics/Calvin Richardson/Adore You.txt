I just smile every time I see you, girl, I adore you
(Make me want to buy a ring, now)

Listen now
Every time you come my way
Can't find a word to say
That will describe how much I love you
So I have to keep searching
The love you give is so perfect
I know I don't deserve you
Cause your love is so unselfish, yeah
When I'm feeling low
You help me get my feelings
Up, off of the floor
And when I think it's over you come back with some more
Woman, I just adore you, girl, I adore you
(You make my heart smile and sing, yeah)
I just smile every time I see you, girl, adore you
(Make me want to buy a ring, now)
Girl, I adore you, oh, girl
