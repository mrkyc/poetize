Outta life, (ha) but not everyone, not everyone
Wanna got through the toils and strifes
Like this particular fella, walks around
All day long singin' this song
Sha na lah dah dah lah dah dah dah dah
Harry Hippie, lies asleep in the shade
Life don't bug him cause he
Thinks he's got it made
He never worry about nothin' in particular
Oooh he might even sell free press on Sunset
I'd like to help a man when he's down
But I can't help him much
When he's sleepin' on the ground
He's like a bottle in water
Harry just floats through life
Walks around all day long singin' this song
Whoa, whoa, whoa, ohhh yeah
Mary Hippie, she's Harry's lady
Panhandles money just to feed Harry's baby
She can lie down a story so incredible
Man, you wanna help her take the food
Home and put it on the table

But I can't help ya Harry
If you wanna sleep on the ground
Sorry Harry, you're too much weight
To carry around
But he still walks around all day singin' this song
Sha dah dah dah sha nah nah nah nah nah
Nah sha lah lah lah lah dah dah dah
Street child, street child, tell me where
Will you be goin'
When old man winter gets his horn
And starts blowin'
Will you hang around LA
Or hitch a ride on a freeway
Meet an old familiar face in a new place
I'd like to help a man when he's down
But how can I help him
If he's somewhere outta town
Sorry Harry, think I'm gonna put you down
Sha dah dah dah sha dah dah dah dah
Sha lah lah lah lah dah dah dah
Everybody help me sing this song, oh yeah
