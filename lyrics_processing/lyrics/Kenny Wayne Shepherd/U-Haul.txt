They don't realize, oh a thing
Then there's people sittin down on a whole lot of money
Walk by one another and hold their head up high
You know that I searched and I searched
And I searched and I searched
But I never seen no U-Haul behind no hearse, no
Oh yeah
Then there's people they got a lot of money
Lord own everything honey, that's why we can't have nothin' of our own ain't that right sure
We don't have nothin' in this world our own, don't think so honey
(refrain) you know that I searched and I searched and I searched and I searched
But I never seen no nu-haul behind no hearse
I'm gonna tell you all this again, you know, don't let other people take you down
I saw a car I wanna get, I done payed some on it, when I make my last bill on my car
That car is mine ! honey, you park your car in the wrong place and get out of it, come back for your car, honey, your car is gone, ain't that right?
You gotta take money out of your pocket and pay for your car again
Oh yeah, i'm gonna tell you all somethin' honey, oh yeah go ahead on, i'm gonna tell you all somethin' honey, we don't have nothin' in this world our own, don't think so honey
(refrain) you know that I searched and I searched and I searched and I searched
But I never seen no nu-haul behind no hearse
You know, this is my guitar, i done payed for it, but let me tell you, this guitar's not mine !
It sounds funny, don't it ? ha! ha! ha! Ya'll laugh about it, ha !
Ohhh no we don't have nothing in this world of our own.........nothing!!!!
(refrain) you know that I searched and I searched and I searched and I searched
