Finally broke and I could see
Lost, I wasn't lost at all
Just wasn't where I thought I'd be
If I'm strong enough, if I live long enough
I just might come this way again
And I've been here before
All I know for sure is I'm gone like smoke
Anywhere the wind blows
Anywhere the rain falls
(You might find me)
Rising for the ashes, you never know
(I might be dead)
Always been a winner till I'll stir the darkness
Dig a well deeper than it needs to go
Always been ready to roll where it takes me
Anywhere the wind blows
Then, then I began to walk
Across the sinking sand
Search, search for a drink
That wouldn't killed a drowning man
And every step I take, every choice I make
I'm not much further 'round the bench
I don't wave goodbye, there's not need to cry
That's a-how I go
Anywhere the wind blows
Anywhere the rain falls
(You might find me)
Rising for the ashes, you never know
(I might be dead)
Always been a winner till I'll stir the darkness
Dig a well deeper than it needs to go
Always been ready to roll where it takes me
Anywhere, anywhere the wind blows
I won't tell you lies
And I won't dry your tears
You can wonder why
But I'll be far from you
If I'm strong enough, if I live long enough
I just might pass this way again
And I've been here before
All I know for sure is I'm gone like smoke
Anywhere the wind blows
Anywhere the rain falls
(You might find me)
Rising for the ashes, you never know
(I might be dead)
Always been a winner till I'll stir the darkness
Dig a well deeper than it needs to go
Always been ready to roll where it takes me
Anywhere the wind blows
