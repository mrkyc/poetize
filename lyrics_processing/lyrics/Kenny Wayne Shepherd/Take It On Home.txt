I'm lost like a child in a delta storm
And I think it's time to take it on home
Hanging by a thread and a needle in a hole
Coming undone like a frayed out robe
And I think it's time to take it on home
Back to the arms of the woman I love
Sunshine angel with the healing touch
Sweet hallelujah from heaven above
Straight to my bones
Back to the place where feel alive
Put a little peace in this heart of mine
Been long gone and I'm thinking it's time
To take it on, take it on, take it on home
There's a spot beneath the magnolia tree
I swear I hear the wind, it's talking to me
And I'm thinking it's time to it on home
A little white house down a gravel road
Where the world is easy and the days are slow
And I'm thinking it's time to take it on home
Back to the arms of the woman I love
Sunshine angel with the healing touch
Sweet hallelujah from heaven above
Straight to my bones
Back to the place where feel alive
Put a little peace in this heart of mine
Been long gone and I'm thinking it's time
To take it on, take it on, take it on home
Take it on, take it on, take it on home
