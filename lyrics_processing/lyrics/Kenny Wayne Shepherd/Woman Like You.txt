The same old same old change the station
To a new kinda cool kinda conversation

Well gimme that, gimme that sunshine stuff
Some of that summertime moonlight love
Looking so sweet with a badass attitude
Well shake it up, shake it up all night long
Make a southern man wanna put you in a song
The right kinda wrong that I wanna fall into
Oh I want a woman yeah, I want a woman like you
You got something that I can't explain
Set me on fire when you call my name
Losing my mind when you're shaking that thing
Make me wanna, make me wanna give you that ring
Well gimme that, gimme that sunshine stuff
Some of that summertime moonlight love
Looking so sweet with a badass attitude
Well shake it up, shake it up all night long
Make a southern man wanna put you in a song
The right kinda wrong that I wanna fall into
Oh I want a woman yeah, I want a woman like you
