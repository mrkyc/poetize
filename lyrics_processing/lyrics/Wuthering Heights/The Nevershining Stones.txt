Can you feel me breathing
In the rhythm of the world I'm in
Oh!
(Ah, ah-ah, ah)
Here I am
Can you feel me breathing
In the rhythm of the world I'm in
Reaching out I caress the trees
While the sun revolves above me
The air is so rich I can almost drink it
Dance like a fay twixt tree and stream so cold
The true philosopher's stones
Never shall turn nothing into gold
Now they tell me I must lay me down
Once more they'll lock the door
But leaves of green my pillow is
And free I'll disappear in the thicket
The true philosopher's stones
Never shall turn nothing into gold
You might also likeI'm awoken in the woods
I'm searching for the nevershining stones
And the man in white says
I can't hear the birds singing
I'm awoken in the woods
I'm closer to the everlasting truth
And the man in white says
I can't hear them
The wealth of mine is not like thine
Of gold shining
Tree and leaf my treasures are
Living like me, and dying
I'm awoken in the woods
I'm searching for the nevershining stones
And the man in white says
I can't hear the birds singing
I'm awoken in the woods
I'm closer to the everlasting truth
And the man in white says
I can't hear them, no
I'm awoken in the woods
I'm searching for the nevershining stones
And the man in white
And the man in white, oh, oh-oh-oh
I'm awoken in the woods
I'm closer to the everlasting truth
And the man in white says
I can't hear them
Now I'm here
Behind rubber walls
And they tell me
My forest never was at all
Not in a thousand years
Was it the drugs they gave to calm me?
Or something into my mind?
Through generations fed
And if it's all gone
Only a collective memory
Are we then dead?
