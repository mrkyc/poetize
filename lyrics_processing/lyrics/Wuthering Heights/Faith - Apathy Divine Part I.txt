A last display of magic ere surrendering to fear
Lost my faith in leaders and systems long ago
Now it seems I'm losing faith in everything I know
No more attempts to fill the empty pages
Don't ask me to explain my actions
There's no masterplan
No longer seek I satisfaction
In these barren lands
I asked so many whys: were given so few answers
That I can't seem to sense any sense anymore
I cried out to the heavens above
To find out if someone was waiting for me
But they just wanted my gold, not my soul
Though they could have it for free
Lying awake at night; should I keep up the fight
Is madness cursed our divine
Roll with the thunder; cry in the rain
What would the lunatic find
O, apathy divine
Forget it all in time
No more darkness; no more light
No more battles left to fight
You might also likeAfraid to swim into the sea
For the sea may drown
Afraid to climb into the tree
If lightning splits the crown
I heard so many lies; that truth no longer matters
Taking endless extra spins on my unmerry-go-round
Tried to play my life backwards
To find hidden messages; telling me who I am
But I only heard
"Thou art human - thou art damned"
Lying awake at night; should I keep up the fight
Is madness cursed our divine
Roll with the thunder; cry in the rain
What would the lunatic find
O, apathy divine
Forget it all in time
No more darkness; no more light
No more battles left to fight
Used to flow with the waves
But who can swim forever without drowning
Used to strive for immortality
But who needs eternity
In misery
Lying awake at night; should I keep up the fight
Is madness cursed our divine
Roll with the thunder; cry in the rain
What would the lunatic find
O, apathy divine
Forget it all in time
No more darkness; no more light
No more battles left to fight
Should I rely on the arts
To cast light upon us all
Should I write a requiem
For what none wants to recall
At all
No I shall count these the last days of the sun
And seek comfort in darkness
'Til my life tread is spun
But play just one more for me lads;
