No more red blood will flow
When all is frozen;
There'll be no more tears of woe
Locked in winter's deadlock grip
I shall be pleasantly helpless
Ending forever the feverish boil
A wreck, no longer reckless
Snow falls like frozen tears
As if the gods they were crying for me
But I guess there are no more gods
We are alone on this wild, raging sea
If the shipwrecked beats hole in his lifeboat
How can he expect to be saved
Guess that nobody cares
So we might as well go to our graves
When all is white;
No more red blood will flow
When all is frozen;
There'll be nomore tears of woe
Snow falls without; snow falls within
It's colder now; than it's ever been
Inner lands gleaming white
Will there be day after night
Snow falls without; snow falls within
It's colder now; than it's ever been
Cover me in oblivion's frost
Erase the traces of what was lost
You might also likeCaught in apathy's claws
Longing to travel but nowhere to go
Say nothing, do nothing
Longing for caring but no one to hold
Don't know how long I can handle
This urge to blow out the candle
Feel like growing rapidly old
And now it's so cold
When all is white;
No more red blood will flow
When all is frozen;
There'll be no more tears of woe
Snow falls without; snow falls within
It's colder now; than it's ever been
Inner lands gleaming white
Will there be day after night
Snow falls without; snow falls within
It's colder now; than it's ever been
Cover me in oblivion's frost
Erase the traces of what was lost
I'll lay down on these softly rounded hills
This winter's day
And when sun returns
With the snow I'll melt away
Snow falls without; snow falls within
It's colder now; than it's ever been
Inner lands gleaming white
Will there be day after night
Snow falls without; snow falls within
It's colder now; than it's ever been
Cover me in oblivion's frost
Erase the traces of what was lost
I'll lay down on these softly rounded hills
This winter's day
And when sun returns
