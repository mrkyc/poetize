Always the slave by healthy envy was driven
But is my envy still healthy
When I wish not to inherit the castles they live in
I covet not my neighbour's house
Nor his thralls or his cattle
Only the shield that they are to him
In this battle - of life
The poet looks into the mirror
Sees the signs of human action
You may look in there as well
But only see your own reflection
I envy you each day of bliss
Each lucky spell and divine kiss
That the gods bestowed upon you not me
The pictures they paint; are so utterly faint
But clear enough to stir the envy in all
Self-training classes for the consuming masses
To make us feel ugly and small
But that envy is a safe ally
Is a lie
You might also likeI live with ghosts from the past
I live in fear that the next day's the last
I can't keep smiling at your games
While the world is falling down in flames
But make no mistake
I wish I could
I cannot assume ignorance
Of the suffering of man
I cannot pretend pleasure
In walking this scorched land
But make no mistake
I wish that I could
Stormtroopers of stupidity
Manipulating magic
Amazing disgrace of the human race
Sells a paradox fantastic:
That opposed to the so called blessed
You find though you do not seek
Happiness
Sometimes I even envy your conformity
It's not all happy days in the freakshow
- you know
Everything bestowed upon you not me
The pictures they paint; are so utterly faint
But clear enough to stir the envy in all
Self-training classes for the consuming masses
To make us feel ugly and small
But that envy is a safe ally
Is a lie
Still - one can dream of a time
When all the lies have been revealed
And then...
The pictures they paint;
With blood shall be stained
The nightmare of dream factories
Brought down at last
The outcasts shall be the new in crowd, you see
And their mantras a thing of the past
'Cause that envy is a safe ally
