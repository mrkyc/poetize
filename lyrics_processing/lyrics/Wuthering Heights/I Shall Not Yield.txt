I had known it was in vain
That everything was doomed to fail
Too long I lived in childish innocence
While the teachers of pretence
Tested my will to prevail
I cannot trust in anyone, I know
To me my neighbour is my foe
There's poison in the sweets you find
Exploiting weakness with free trade lies
The only thing you cannot buy
Is happiness and peace of mind
It's a balance of power; should I jump
From the prisoners tower
Sometimes I wish that I could lay me down
And hope for no tomorrow
But you'll never see me surrender my blade
Refusing death's call, I will conquer my fate
For I shall not yield
And I cannot even sell my soul
It's beaten, torn and abused
Still my lifejoy may fetch a fair price
Since it's only "slightly used"
You might also likeIt's a balance of power; should I jump
From the prisoners tower
Sometimes I wish that I could lay me down
And hope for no tomorrow
But you'll never see me surrender my blade
Refusing death's call, I will conquer my fate
For I shall not yield
Gods of life!
I meet your challenge
I shall rise from every blow you strike at me
I shall break every spell you throw at me
You will not push me that last bit of way
Over the Edge
Even if I'm only holding on by sheer spite itself
You may have woven this one's lifethread
Of a fowl and poisoned string
But it shall not break
That final victory shall be denied thee...forever!
When even my imaginary friends
Turn their backs on me again
And leave me bleeding on the ground
I can no longer welcome each new day
But on this battlefield I'll stay
'Cause you will never bring me down
And when in time to the ground I'm bent
From carrying life's stone; my strength all spent
I shall drag myself forth by the tip of my nails
To spit on your feet with a last scornful hail
It's a balance of power; should I jump
From the prisoners tower
Sometimes I wish that I could lay me down
And hope for no tomorrow
But you'll never see me surrender my blade
Refusing death's call, I will conquer my fate
