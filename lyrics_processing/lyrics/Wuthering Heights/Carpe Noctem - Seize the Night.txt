A walkabout in olden slopes
Wake up sleeping
In soil covered in ice
Where will the roses grow
Floating in a haze
Like seaweed to the shore
Who will bring back the silky scents
Of the hills of evermore
Then I woke up at the first break of night
My eyes were the only light
And I shall count these the last days of the sun
And seek comfort in darkness
'Til my life thread is spun
The colors of black
The music of the night
Throw your voice high into the air full of pride
Find your own road to glory
Use what powers life may give you
Never cease the fight
If you cannot win the day
Seize the night
You might also likeThrow your voice high into the air full of pride
Find your own road to glory
Use what powers life may give you
Never cease the fight
If you cannot win the day
Seize the night
If you cannot win the day
Seize the night
Only given pleasure; to learn to yearn for it
Only given light; to be blind without it
Only given power; to be scared to use it
Only given mind; to finally lose it
The colors of black
The music of the night
Maybe this is my true realm
In truth I may be blinded by light
If such is indeed my purpose
I shall seize the night
Throw your voice high into the air full of pride
Find your own road to glory, glory
Use what powers life may give you
Never cease the fight
If you cannot win the day
Seize the night
Throw your voice high into the air full of pride
Find your own road to glory
Use what powers life may give you
Never cease the fight
If you cannot win the day
Seize the night
If you cannot win the day
Seize the night
If you cannot win the day
