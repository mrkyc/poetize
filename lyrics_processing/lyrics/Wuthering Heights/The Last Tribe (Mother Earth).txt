The chieftain stares into the fire
A shadow of a tear upon his face
He's not really wise or old, no gets old no more
He just happens to be leading
The remnant of the race
And he knows not all will make the night
He knows this time they've lost the fight
Some still speak of the flower-tribe
Who laid their weapons down, and tried
To live in peace, but were overrun
When greed replaced need
Then fast downhill it went from there
Until all the land was bare
Now they cower in the moonless night
And pray they'll see the day
Lesser sons of greater sires
Bearing wood to their own pyres
One of them may look towards the sky
And raise his broken voice to cry...
O, Mother Earth, how could we forget
The gifts you gave, the things you let
Us do to you, to live off you
And dance beneath the stars
O, Mother Earth, how could we have known
The love you gave's not lightly thrown
Away, will you have mercy on your daughters and your sons
Or have your peace once we are gone
You might also likeThe hunters tell of a place they've found
Where paper stands in leather bound
Filled with mystic signs
That none now can unwind
And one who says he's very bold
Claims he's seen a chest of gold
But the others say such things are vain
They give no shelter from the rain
The vulture riding winds up high
Espies these wicked creatures die
From time to time his blood will chill
When he hears their song from hill to hill
O, Mother Earth, how could we forget
The gifts you gave, the things you let
Us do to you, to live off you
And dance beneath the stars
O, Mother Earth, how could we have known
The love you gave's not lightly thrown
Away, will you have mercy on your daughters and your sons
Or have your peace once we are gone
When all again is wrapped in green
And the balance is restrained
None will recall the sad laments
Of dethroned kings of yore
O, Mother Earth, how could we forget
The gifts you gave, the things you let
Us do to you, to live off you
And dance beneath the stars
O, Mother Earth, how could we have known
The love you gave's not lightly thrown
Away, will you have mercy on your daughters and your sons
