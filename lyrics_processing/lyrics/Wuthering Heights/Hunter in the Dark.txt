Yet in my soul are darkened caves
Something roaming in my mind
A creature from another time
The sea grows red as sun goes down
A voice cries out; I turn around
Hidden power not to see
Red horizon calling me
And I'm crying out in pain
I must have gone insane
Don't know what's dragging me; just know it's true
I don't know what to do
Must hold on; this can't be real
A strange illustion or a dream
Or is it madness
Finally
But the voices keep on calling me
They want to save me; set me free
Nature calling her children home
An exploding lust for the peace beyond
And I'm crying out in pain
I must have gone insane
Don't know what's dragging me; just know it's true
As my voice roars to the sky I know what to do
You might also likeNow I'm one with the night; gone with the light
A hunter in the dark; and you will never catch me again
My blood is running wild; I cry up the sky
In light of moon
And I'm crying out in pain
I must have gone insane
Don't know what's dragging me; just know it's true
As my voice roars to the sky no more
It's gone; I'm here all alone
Was I really there
Or is it all in my mind
All in my mind
But then I hear; A beastly cry reaches my ear
I know a part of me is really out there
Yet I'm bound to live in my world
As you are in yours
But in my dreams I'll be
One with the night; gone with the light
A hunter in the dark; and you will never catch me again
Now I'm one with the night; gone with the light
A hunter in the dark; and you will never catch me again
My blood is running wild; I cry up the sky
In light of moon
One with the night; gone with the light
