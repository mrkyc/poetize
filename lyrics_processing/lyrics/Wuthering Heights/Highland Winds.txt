Oh oh
Oh oh, oh!

I was roaming far from home
Far from the town that I left behind
Out in the wild
Under open sky
Found myself in a field of green
Fairest of lands that I ever saw
The wind was different there
Under open sky
Wind, wiped the tears off my face
Light, shone a way through the haze
Clouds cast shadows on fields below
Rain fell but was no longer cold
Felt I was stranded out of time
Gently touched by the breath of the Gods
Colours primeval
Under open sky
You might also likeWind, wiped the tears off my face
Light, shone a way through the haze
Clouds cast shadows on fields below
Rain fell but was no longer cold
And the world may be falling
Still pipes are calling me home
Highland winds you own my soul
Gladly I laid it in your hands
Let me roam in these green, green lands
And never shall I grow old
I believe I could sit here a thousand years
Feeding on air, watching nothing change
Thinking this is a good place to die
This is a good place to die
Sad was the day when I had to go
Back to the town that I left behind
Enamoured for life
Under open sky
But in my mind this land's forever clear
And in my thoughts I will travel there
To ease all pain and calm my fear
Under open sky
A piece of me remains
Under open sky
I left my heart
Under open sky
Highland winds you own my soul
Gladly I laid it in your hands
Let me roam in these green, green lands
And never shall I grow old
Highland winds you own my soul
Gladly I laid it in your hands
Let me roam in these green, green lands
And never shall I grow old
Thinking this is a good place to die
