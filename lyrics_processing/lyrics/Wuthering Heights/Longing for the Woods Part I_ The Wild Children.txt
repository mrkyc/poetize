Deep within their hearts the earliest of songs
In their eyes the light of the first of days
But the road is hidden
And they are so far, so far away
Oh-oh
Oh, oh!
Staring into darkness
Something stirs inside
A longing for something left long ago
Delving into darkness
Cannot stay inside
The moon is young and clear
And the fire (Fire) is drawing them near
Now the wind calls
A storm from the past
Night falls
And they're longing for the woods
Wind calls
A storm from the past
Night falls
And they're longing for the woods

A storm from the past
Night falls
And they're longing for the woods
Wind calls
A storm from the past
Night falls
And they're longing for the woods
Oh, oh, oh oh
Longing for the woods
They gather in the shadows
In their eyes a fire light
Warriors and maidens fair
Bonded by a love implied
They gather in the shadows
In their eyes a fire light
Warriors and maidens fair
Bonded by a love implied
(Oh, oh, oh oh, oh oh)
(Oh oh, oh, oh oh, oh oh)
(Oh oh, oh, oh oh, oh oh)

A storm from the past
Night falls
And they're longing (Longing, longing, longing)
For the woods
Wind calls
A storm from the past
Night falls
And they're longing for the woods
Wind calls
A storm from the past
Night falls
And they're longing for the woods
Yo-oh, oh oh, yo-oh oh
In the shade I stand and watch them
Like a scene from an ancient dream
Trying hard to awaken the Gods
In the hour of the fall
But it was long ago and it was far away
