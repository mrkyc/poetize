The walls creep close
Surrounded by liquid shapes and shadows
The minstrel is convincing tonight
To me and to the forms that fly
Invisible below the ceiling
Covered in layer upon layer of memories
I know I can't silence the screaming
But not even that can trouble me right now
I feel a sudden warmth, I'm outside time and tears
A strange place where I can laugh at my fears
Knowing that the spirits are
Just outside the field of my view
Protecting me
Showing me a world that is not yet totally desolate
There is more to my soul than to my eyes
I am strong, like the eagle I'll rise
I will seek high and low, quest for quest's sake
I will shape my own path to travel for evermore
Through within to beyond
I feel a sudden warmth, I'm outside time and tears
A strange place where I can laugh at my fears
You might also likeAnd if right now I would lay my life
In a brother's hand
Then perchance one day
I could lay it in the hand of she
Who dances on the hill
Tomorrow may still come
I will reach for the hot core that I've felt still
Living
There is more on the inside
Maybe even a little to share
And maybe even for the Wanderer there'll be
A homely fireside before the world is bare
There is more to my soul than to my eyes
I am strong, like the eagle I'll rise
I will seek high and low, quest for quest's sake
I will shape my own path to travel for evermore
...To my soul than to my eyes
I am strong, like the eagle I'll rise
I will seek high and low, quest for quest's sake
I will shape my own path to travel
To trave.... to travel for evermore
