Dark pools open to swallow all
Greedy claws of decadence grasp at every limb
A mirror of marred, grinning faces
In the eye of this storm of staring eyes I stand
Lightning rips both sky and land
Demonic choirs of disharmony
Screaming their false lamentation
And I know I cannot escape
This darkness that's trying to fill me
For even though I close my eyes
I see fire, I hear thunder roll
I see them carry off the fallen
The mirror cracks
The horizon's falling
When from afar a clear voice is calling
At the stroke of a harp
The road of light opens before me
Down a golden stream
With flames in her hands
With a song she crushes my wanhope
And she dances, dances
You might also likeDancer in the light
Won't you guide me through the darkness
Won't you blind my eyes
That I can't see the edge
Dancer in the light
Won't you dance for me
At the stroke of a harp
The road of light opens before me
Down a golden stream
With flames in her hands
With a song she crushes my wanhope
And she dances, dances
Dancer in the light
Won't you guide me through the darkness
Won't you blind my eyes
That I can't see the edge
Dancer in the light
Won't you dance for me
Dancer in the light
Won't you guide me through the darkness
Won't you blind my eyes
That I can't see the edge
Dancer in the light
Dancer, you're but a fantasy
Temporary existence
And I wonder if ever again
I can gather my powers to call you
Or only wrap myself in darkness
And fly away, fly away
Dancer in the light
Won't you guide me through the darkness
Won't you blind my eyes
That I can't see the edge
Dancer in the light
