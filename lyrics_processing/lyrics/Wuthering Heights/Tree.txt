I'll stand a thousand more
Seen kingdoms rise and fall
Seen pestilence and war
How swift are your little lives?
How swiftly you forget
My roots are deep in your forefathers' bones
My head in the air that you breathe
When you freeze I submit to your fire
When you're hot come seek shadow beneath
Tree, tall as a mountain
Older than fathers of kings of men (Fathers of kings of men)
Stood here and watched while your heroes died
I am your memory
I am incarnate life
My branches your cradle
I watched the rise of man
While you wished upon the stars
I never left the land
And you've hung villains from my arms
Nailed prophets high on my chest
In your mind you may be the master
But in the soil we both shall rest
You might also likeTree, tall as a mountain
Older than fathers of kings of men (Fathers of kings of men)
Stood here and watched while your heroes died
I am your memory
I am incarnate life
You've convinced yourselves you were cast out of Eden
But you left willingly in pride
Now when you freeze in your castles of stone
Do you think you were right?
Do you think?
Do you think you were right?
(Oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh)
Tree, tall as a mountain
Older than fathers of kings of men (Fathers of kings of men)
Stood here and watched while your heroes died
I am your memory
I am incarnate life
Tree, tall as a mountain
Older than fathers of kings of men (Fathers of kings of men)
Stood here and watched while your heroes died
I am your memory
I am incarnate life
How fragile are your lives?
How fragile your dreams?
And you shall ache with thirst
In eroded landscapes (There's no escape)
Last species alone in a field of stone
But listen mankind, what I tell is true
From a buried seed a forest will be
You may destroy
But you cannot undo
