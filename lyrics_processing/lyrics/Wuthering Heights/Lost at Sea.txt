Or so I reckon it must be
A slightly paler shade of grey around
If not inside of me
I stand firm here now
At this ship's prow
But I'm a proud captain no more
I rule this crew with a heavy hand
But they are but ghosts
And I feel only the biting rain
On my face at most
There are great powers here
But I can't wield them
I am no god, can't bend the elements to my will
Though I've prayed to the lords of wind and rain
All around me remains
Still
We are given this board game and a few of the pieces
But most are missing
Then the Lady Fortuna robs you of judgment and breath
As soon as you're kissing
With the scarcest of provisions
Upon the icy waves we're cast
So far from home
No birds shall land on these masts

The ever calmer waters terrifying me
Shifting, pray winds be shifting
Carry me away to anywhere but here
Drifting, ever drifting
The ever calmer waters terrifying me
Shifting, pray winds be shifting
Life is a beautiful ship
But I am lost at sea
I left the homely fire to wrestle the sea
But if they reckon me dead, am I still me?
I cannot turn back, yet see no lands ahead
Bound to sleep on the ocean's bed
There is no straight road, no enchanted isles
The world is bent, and so am I
No one can bridge what time and oceans sever
Those realms are lost, should I sail forever
Drifting, ever drifting
The ever calmer waters terrifying me
Shifting, pray winds be shifting
Carry me away to anywhere but here
Drifting, ever drifting
The ever calmer waters terrifying me
Shifting, pray winds be shifting
Life is a beautiful ship
But I am lost at sea
Sometimes I believe
I hear a lonely piper playing
Somewhere, out there in the mist
But the notes melt away
Like snowflakes in my hand
There is no harbour
There is no fiddle band
Sometimes I believe
I see faint lights twinkling
Somewhere, out there in the mist
But they are not lanterns
To help lonely sailors find
Their way, I know, they are but
Flickers in my mind
Maybe I am gone already
I feel I should go, I would go
Draped only with an almost faded glow
A cape sprayed with a few sands of glory
I could leave them, I would leave them
They are nothing, 'tis all folly
My spirit is ready to go into the soothing darkness
Touching the stars
Perchance to dream
With luck to escape into the night
But still this rope that binds me
To the living lands won't be untied
It is worn thin as a single strand of hair
Yet it holds like a wire of steel
Another dawn out here
Or so I reckon it must be
A slightly paler shade of grey around
If not inside of me
Visibility still naught
Surface is calm but mirrors nothing
New clouds keep coming in
Though my sails won't unfurl
If clouds indeed they be
Or smoke from the scorching of the world
Water's dark below me
Dark as my heart and as cold
Do not feel alive
Only feel I'm growing old
Drifting, ever drifting
The ever calmer waters terrifying me
Shifting, pray winds be shifting
Carry me away to anywhere but here
Drifting, ever drifting
The ever calmer waters terrifying me
Shifting, pray winds be shifting
Life is a beautiful, mystical, magical ship
But I am lost at sea
I left a homely fire, but forgot the road back
I laid roses on a grave, but forgot both name and tears
The anchor will reach no bottom
The wind won't fill the sails
All is now dark
All is now dark
All is now dark
