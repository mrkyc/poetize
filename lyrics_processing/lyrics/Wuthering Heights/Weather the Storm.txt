The maelstrom will take us down
It's a rainy day for the end of the world
Yet I see a lighthouse far away, it's winking at me
(Like an image of an image)
If you see it too, then it must be real
Then at last here we stand
On this last bit of dry land
As the waves are closing in
We have been here before
Though it looks dark for sure
This time the end seems ready to begin
This could be the ultimate day
Yet there's nothing to say
We'll hold on to each other
And take on the world
The living spirit trapped and hurt
By boundaries of written word
Walks forlorn in twilit halls
But I see deep in your eyes
A fire burning bright and high
A mirror of a future that still calls
You might also likeAt ease I go into the night
With you by my side
We are one
And we'll take on the world
Who knows if we'll see each other again
Who knows if this is the end
If we'll see tomorrow my friend
But we are together
Let that be the hope that we cling to
Let that be the rope we hold on to
And when the sun comes over the hills
I suspect we will be here still
'Cause together we'll weather the storm
We'll weather the storm
Rain and snow may fall, the wolves may call
Still we will be strong
Winds may shatter the land, still we will stand
Because we belong
Who knows if we'll see each other again
Who knows if this is the end
If we'll see tomorrow my friend
But we are together
Let that be the hope that we cling to
Let that be the rope we hold on to
And when the sun comes over the hills
I suspect we will be here still
'Cause together we'll weather the storm
We'll weather the storm
And after the rage of the storm is calmed
And all again is free
I will call for you
And you will call for me
And we'll walk hand in hand
On a glimmering path towards the stars
Of a shimmering hue we are
With you, I believe we are forever
Who knows if we'll see each other again
Who knows if this is the end
If we'll see tomorrow my friend
But we are together
Let that be the hope that we cling to
Let that be the rope we hold on to
And when the sun comes over the hills
I suspect we will be here still
