Along about 1825 I left Tennessee very much alive
I never would've got through the Arkansas mud
If I hadn't been a ridin' on the Tennessee Stud
I had some trouble with my sweetheart's pa
One of her brothers was a bad outlaw
I send her a letter by my Uncle Fudd
And I rode away on the Tennessee Stud
The Tennesee Stud was long and lean
The color of the sun and his eyes were green
He had the nerve and he had the blood
And there never was a horse like the Tennessee Stud
We drifted on down onto no man's land
We crossed the river called the Rio Grande
I raced my horse with a Spaniard's foal
Till I got me a skin full of silver and gold
Me and a gambler we couldn't agree
We got in a fight over Tennessee
We jerked our guns, he fell with a thud
And I got away on the Tennessee Stud
Well, I got just as lonesome as a man could be
Dreamin' of my girl in Tennessee
The Tennessee Stud's green eyes turned blue
'Cause he was a dreamin' of his sweetheart too
You might also likeWe loped right back across Arkansas
I whoopped her brother and whopped her pa
I found that girl with the golden hair
She was a ridin' on the Tennessee Mare
The Tennesee Stud was long and lean
The color of the sun and his eyes were green
He had the nerve and he had the blood
And there never was a horse like the Tennessee Stud
Stirrup to stirrup and side by side
We crossed the mountains and the valleys wide
We came to Big Muddy and we forded the flood
And the Tennessee Mare and the Tennessee Stud
A pretty little babyy and the cabin floor
A little horse colt playin' round the door
I love the girl with the golden hair
And the Tennessee Stud loves the Tennessee Mare
The Tennesee Stud was long and lean
The color of the sun and his eyes were green
He had the nerve and he had the blood
