The green leaves of summer are calling me home
It was good to be young then in the season of plenty
When the catfish were jumpin' as high as the sky
A time just for plantin', a time just for ploughin'/plowin'
A time to be courtin' a girl of your own
'Twas so good to be young then, to be close to the earth
And to stand by your wife at the moment of birth

A time just for livin', a place for to die)
