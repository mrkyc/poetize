Let me hear you scream!

I'm black and bruised, beat up, but still I take the blows
'Cause all I need is blood and sweat and skin and bones
I'll take this rage, rattle your cage, nobody said it's easy
It's do or die, only the strong survive
Get ready for the last stand
Get ready, I'm your hangman

Let me hear you scream like you want it
Let me hear you yell like you mean it
If you're gonna go down, go loud, go strong
Go proud, go on, go hard or go home
Let me hear you (Let me hear you)
Let me hear you (Let me hear you)
Let me hear you scream

I'll pull you up and push you right back in your place
I'll take you down and wipe that smile right off your face
I'll watch you break, you're mine to take, don't blink, you just might miss it
It's all or nothing, nowhere left to run
Are you ready for the last fight?
Get ready with the war cry
You might also like
Let me hear you scream like you want it
Let me hear you yell like you mean it
If you're gonna go down, go loud, go strong
Go proud, go on, go hard or go home
Let me hear you (Let me hear you)
Let me hear you (Let me hear you)
Let me hear you scream


Let me hear you scream like you want it
