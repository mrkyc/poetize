How many times can they fill me with lies? And I listen again
Twisting the truth and they're playin' around with my head,  okay
The things they will do and the things they will say, but they don't really understand
Tears fill my eyes when I hear all the cries for the reason today

And they don't really know even what they're talking about
And I can't imagine what empty heads can achieve

Leave me alone, don't want your promises no more
'Cause rock and roll is my religion and my law
Won't ever change, may think it's strange
You can't kill rock and roll, it's here to stay

Looking through eyes of time, mirrors reflecting their stories untrue
Promises, promises, telling me all of my glory's overdue
How many times have I heard it before? And I'll probably hear it again
King of a thousand knights, pawn in a table light, losing to you

And they don't really know even what they're talkin' about
And I can't imagine what empty heads can achieve
You might also like
Leave me alone, don't want your promises no more
'Cause rock and roll is my religion and my law
Won't ever change, may think it's strange
You can't kill rock and roll, it's here to stay


Even the rhymes that they give me in times of confession ain't true
Outcome is obvious, all for them, none for us, meaning you too
The things they will do and the things they will say when they don't really understand
Fear of rejection, I need their protection, I'm making a stand

'Cause they don't really know even what they're talking about
And I can't imagine what empty heads can achieve

Leave me alone, don't want your promises no more
'Cause rock and roll is my religion and my law
Won't ever change, may think it's strange
You can't kill rock and roll, it's here to stay
Leave me alone, don't want your promises no more
'Cause rock and roll is my religion and my law
Won't ever change, may think it's strange
