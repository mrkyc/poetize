I met a magic man who had a daughter
She learned her lessons well, but still, I taught her
She followed willingly as lambs to slaughter
We shared forbidden fruits and things I brought her

You may say I'm a miracle mannequin
Here I come with my mystical plan again
Although you think I can, I'm just a man
And I don't walk on water (Oh no), I don't walk on water (Oh no)

I followed willingly a sweet temptation
She had me hypnotized, and still, I'm waiting
My dromedary dreams as wet as oceans
With sand dunes bearing seeds, she's set in motion

You may say I'm a cynical charlatan
There I go with my whimsical ways again
Although you think I can, I'm just a man
And I don't walk on water (Oh no), I don't walk on water (Oh no)
I don't walk on water (Oh no), I don't walk on water (Oh no)

Kaleidoscopical eyes
As you look in the mirror
And the long is getting shorter
As the far is now nearer
You might also like
Are you just a mirror standing in front of me?
Am I blind? Can my eyes really see?

You may say I'm a miracle mannequin
Here I come with my mystical plan again
Although you think I can, I'm just a man
And I don't walk on water (Oh no), I don't walk on water (Oh no)
I don't walk on water (Oh no), I don't walk on water (Oh no)

I followed willingly (Oh no) a sweet temptation
She had me hypnotized (Oh no), and still I'm waiting
My dromedary dreams (Oh no) as wet as oceans
With sand dunes bearing seeds (Oh no), she's set in motion
I followed willingly (Oh no) a sweet temptation
She had me hypnotized (Oh no), and still I'm waiting
My dromedary dreams (Oh no) as wet as oceans
With sand dunes bearing seeds (Oh no), she's set in motion
I followed willingly (Oh no) a sweet temptation
She had me hypnotized (Oh no), and still I'm waiting
My dromedary dreams (Oh no) as wet as oceans
