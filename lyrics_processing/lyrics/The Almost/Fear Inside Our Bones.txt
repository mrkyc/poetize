Why do we doubt?
Why do we wonder when our stories don't play out?
Why are we hoping?
This too shall pass?
Why are we waiting? For out train come at last
This is my best and my worst guess
We will make with pain inside of us
With a chose to feel just enough
Or grit our teeth and and take the whole thing down
We were made with fear inside our bones
The kind that makes you feel alone
So hold on just breathe and figure out
We are not alone
This makes us feel alive
Why do we wonder? Far into lies
Why do we feel our hope won't arise
This is my best and my worst guess
We were made with pain inside of us
With the choice to feel just enough
Or grit our teeth and take the whole thing down
We were made with fear inside our bones
The kind that make you feel alone
So hold on just breathe and figure out
We're not alone, this makes us feel alive
Don't look to me for hope
I'm lost, I'm just like you
Don't look to me for freedom
There is a real way out
There is a real way out
We were made with pain inside of us
With the choice to feel just enough
Or grit our teeth and take the whole thing down
We were made with fear inside our bones
The kind that make you feel alone
So hold on just breathe and figure out
We were made with pain inside of us
With the choice to feel just enough
Or grit our teeth and take the whole thing down
We were made with fear inside our bones
The kind that make you feel alone
So hold on just breathe and figure out
We are not alone, this makes us feel alive
We are not alone, this makes us feel alive
We are not alone, this makes us feel alive
