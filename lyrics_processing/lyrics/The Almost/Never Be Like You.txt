It seems like
You won't ever understand
Outside the limelight
Here in the daylight
I'm exactly who I am
I don't expect you to get it
Forget it
So just quit it
'Cause I'm so over this
And I'm gonna start replacing
Erasing the faces
Changing the places
Where I started this
I can't fake it, no
I'll never be like you
Never be like you
Oh no
I can't take it, no
I'll never be like you
Never be like you
Oh no
You might also likeYou can try
But you won't get your wish
I won't let you win
You're never gonna win, no
I can't take it, no
I'll never be like you
Never be like you
Oh no
I'm rejecting, not expecting
Any good from you
You're always correcting
And inspecting
Everything I say and do
So walk away
Not afraid of what you say
'Cause what you said
Is what started this
And I know
This is the end
Don't pretend that we're friends
Because friends would never act like this
I can't fake it, no
I'll never be like you
Never be like you
Oh no
I can't take it, no
I'll never be like you
Never be like you
Oh no
You can try
But you won't get your wish
I won't let you win
You're never gonna win, no
I can't take it, no
I'll never be like you
Never be like you
Oh no
Stop trying to waste my time
Stop trying to waste my time
You're never ever gonna cross my mind
You're never ever gonna cross my mind
I can't fake it, no
Never be like you
Never be like you, oh no
I can't take it, no
I'll never be like you
Never be like you
Oh no
You can try
But you won't get your wish
I won't let you win
You're never gonna win, no
I can't take it, no
I'll never be like you
Never be like you
