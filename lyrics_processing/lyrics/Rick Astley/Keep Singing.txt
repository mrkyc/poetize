When I was a boy
I saw my daddy crying at the steering wheel
And oh, it made me feel so scared
Then there was joy
From my religion, swimming in a choir of voices
And oh, I knew that I'd been spared

That I'd be saved some sunny day
Saved from throwing my life away
That I'd be saved some sunny day
From throwing my life, throwing my life away

Keep singing, woah, I keep singing
Praising to the heavens with my voice ringing
Keep singing, woah, I keep singing
Clap to the beat till my hands are stinging
And I'd be saved some sunny day
From throwing my life, throwing my life away

And now I understand
I'm a wide-eyed father, and blessed are the children
Oh, our greatest reward
And with these hands
I'll move a mountain, build a castle to keep you safe
Of this you know you can be sure
