Are we lovers or only just friends?
Come tomorrow will I be lonely again?
When you see me is it love in your eyes?
What you're feelin' deep down inside?

Do you think about me (Think about me)
When I'm far away?
Do you dream about me? (Dream about me)
Can I find the way
To make you want me (Make you want me)
The way that I want you?
'Cause I think I love you (Think I love you)
Could you love me too?

Take me to your heart
Never let me go
If you knew what I'm feeling
You would not say no
Take me to your heart
Never let me go
For your love, for your love
Is all I need to know

Can you tell me when you look at me
If you need me in all honesty?
Because I'm certain as sure as can be
I'll make ya happy
Eternally...

'Cause I think about you (Think about you)
When you're far away
And I dream about you (Dream about you)
Night and day
Can I make you want me (Make you want me)
The way that I want you
