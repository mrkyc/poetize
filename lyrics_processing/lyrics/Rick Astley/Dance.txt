God walks home through the local park
Meets the devil with a broken heart
He says
"I've been let down by the armies of darkness
Oh my whole life's a mess"
And God says

"I got the cure
I'm holding on to something pure
I got the cure for you

All you gotta do is dance
Pick your feet up
All you gotta do is dance
Feel the beat, love
All you've gotta do is dance
Dance with me"

Now the devil thanks God and he's on his way
Skip in his stride, what a beautiful day
And then along comes a slacker with some fun in his hand
Beelzebub knows he's got to save this man
And the devil says

All you gotta do is dance
Pick your feet up
All you gotta do is dance

All you've gotta do is dance
Dance with me
All you gotta do is dance
Pick your feet up
All you gotta do is dance
Feel the beat, love
All you've gotta do is dance

The trees became a multitude of angels
Singing out like a gospel choir
And the benches in the park rose up
To become their chariots of fire
Oh fire, yeah
They rose up
They rose up
To become their chariots of fire
(And the benches in the park rose up
And they dance with God and Beelzebub)
God said
"All you gotta do is dance
Pick your feet up
All you gotta do is dance
Feel the beat, love
All you've gotta do is dance
Dance with me
All you gotta do is dance
Pick your feet up
All you gotta do is dance
Feel the beat, love
All you've gotta do is dance
Dance with me
All you gotta do is dance
Pick your feet up
All you gotta do is dance
Feel the beat, love
All you've gotta do is dance
