Can anybody stop this feeling?
Anybody stop this pain?
Stop this world from turning
So we can start it again, again, again, again, yeah

Tell me that I'm just dreaming
Don't tell me we've gone too far
Tell me this life has a meaning
Is it written in all our scars

Never gonna turn it back
Never gonna change the facts
Can't stop this world from turning
The fire's already burning
Never gonna feel the same
Never gonna and that's a shame
We gotta keep believing
Can't lose that human feeling

If anybody has the answer
The question's never in doubt
Some say life is a dancer
Together we'll find out

Tell me it's just a feeling
Tell me that this ain't real
It's an artificial dream of the future
We'd better be prepared to kneel

Never gonna turn it back
Never gonna change the facts
Can't stop this world from turning
The fire's already burning
Never gonna feel the same
Never gonna and that's a shame
We gotta keep believing
Can't lose that human feeling

I don't think I can make it
If you won't tell me the truth
No, I don't think I can fake it
If you're keeping secrets too
No, I don't think I can make it
No matter how hard I try
I don't think I can shake this feeling
That everything I know is a lie
Never gonna turn it back
Never gonna change the facts
Can't stop this world from turning
The fire's already burning
Never gonna feel the same
Never gonna and that's a shame
We gotta keep believing
Can't lose that human feeling

Tell me it's it just a feeling
(What's the meaning?)
Tell me that this ain't real
(What's the meaning?)
Tell me it's it just a feeling
(What's the meaning?)
Tell me that this ain't real
