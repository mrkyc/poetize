Marie has set up home
With a man who's half my age
A halfwit in a leotard
Stands on my stage

The standards have fallen
My value has dropped
But don't shed a tear
Some walk like they own the place
Whilst others creep in fear
Try if you can to walk like a man
But you don't come near

You've got to fly like an eagle
Prowl like a lion in Africa
Leap like a salmon
Home from the sea
To keep up with me
You've got to walk like a panther tonight
Walk like a panther tonight

The old hometown just looks the same
Like a derelict man who had died out of shame
Like a jumble sale left out in the rain
It's not good, it's not right

The standards have fallen
My value has dropped
But don't shed a tear
Some walk like they own the place
Whilst others creep in fear
Try if you can to walk like a man
But you, you don't come near

You've got to fly like an eagle
Prowl like a lion in Africa
Leap like a salmon
Home from the sea
To keep up with me
You've got to walk like a panther tonight
Walk like a panther tonight

Where did you leave all self-respect?
You look like a reptile, your house is a wreck
Your existence an insult
Stains that are suspect cover your clothes

The standards have fallen
My value has dropped
But don't shed a tear
Some walk like they own the place
Whilst others creep in fear
Try if you can to walk like a man
But you, you don't come near
You've got to fly like an eagle
Prowl like a lion in Africa
Leap like a salmon
Home from the sea
To keep up with me
You've got to walk like a panther tonight

Walk like a panther tonight
Walk like a panther tonight
Walk like a panther tonight
You've got to walk like a panther
Walk like a panther tonight
Tonight
