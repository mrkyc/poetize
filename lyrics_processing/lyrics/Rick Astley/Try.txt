I don't know if I can make it
But I'm gonna try, I'm gonna try
I don't know if I can make it
But just watch me try, watch me try

When it feels like all my chances
End in empty sighs
I remember that the only thing
That I can lose is pride

You know I got to try
Even though my heart is on the line
Even if I'm broken on the inside
There's nothing I won't do to make it right
You know, you know I got to try

All I know is nothing certain
So I'm gonna try, I'm gonna try
It's only myself that I'm hurting
If I don't try, if I don't try

When it feels like all my hopes and dreams
Are shattered into dust
I remember that the only thing
I have to do is trust

And you know I got to try
Even though my heart is on the line
And even if I'm broken on the inside
There's nothing I won't do to make it right
You know, you know I got to try
Even if I'm stopped at every turn
Even if I lose and crash and burn
I won't quit until your love I've earned
You know, you know I got to try

Don't need anyone to tell us this is golden
I can see that there are diamonds in your eyes tonight
Don't need anyone to tell us to be open
We'll open up, we'll open up our wings and fly

Even though our hearts are on the line
Even if we're broken on the inside
There's nothing we won't do to win this fight
You know, you know we got to try
Even if we're stopped at every turn
Even if we lose and crash and burn
We won't quit until our love we've earned
