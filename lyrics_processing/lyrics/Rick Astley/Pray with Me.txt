If you're ever gonna make this work
You gotta pick yourself right up
From out of the dirt
You might need someone
To give you a helping hand
Show you how to love
Make you understand
Well, you never thought that you would fall
Now you're on your knees
And you're about ready to crawl
You need someone to rid you of your disease
I'll tell you what to do
Show you how to be

If you pray with me
On your knees under the willow trees
And pray with me
For what we need
Might not be money, might not be gold
Let your love release your soul
Come on and pray
Won't you pray with me

There's electric in your veins
It's burning you up
You can't stand the pain
You need someone to listen to your affliction
But ain't a few left just one more addiction
