No, no, no, baby
Mhm-mmm
La-la-la-la-la-la (Look into my eyes)
Would I lie to you, yeah? (Would I lie to you, baby, would I lie to you?)

Look into my eyes, can't you see they're open wide?
Would I lie to you, baby, would I lie to you? (Oh, yeah)
Don't you know it's true, girl, there's no one else but you?
Would I lie to you, baby, yeah? Come on

Everybody wants to know the truth
In my arms is the only proof
I've hidden my heart behind the bedroom door
Now it's open, I can't do no more

I'm telling you, baby, you will never find another girl
In this heart of mine (Oh-oh, oh)

Look into my eyes, can't you see they're open wide?
Would I lie to you, baby, would I lie to you? (Oh, yeah)
Don't you know it's true, girl, there's no one else but you?
Would I lie to you, baby, yeah? Come on (Would I lie to you?)
You might also like
Everybody's got their history (History)
On every page, a mystery (It's a mystery, yeah)
You can read my diary, you're in every line
Jealous minds, never satisfied

I'm telling you, baby, you will never find another girl
In this heart of mine, woo! (In this heart of mine)

Look into my eyes, can't you see they're open wide?
Would I lie to you, baby, would I lie to you? (Oh, yeah)
Don't you know it's true, girl, there's no one else but you?
Would I lie to you, baby, yeah? (Would I lie to you?)
Come on

(Ooh, look into my eyes) Ooh, ooh
(Would I lie to you, baby? Would I lie to you?) Would I lie to you, baby? (Oh, yeah)
(Ooh, look into my eyes) Yeah, yeah
(Would I lie to you, baby? Would I lie to you?) Oh, oh, oh, oh

(Would I lie to you?) When you wanna see me night and day
(Would I lie?) If I tell you that I'm here to stay
(Would I lie to you?) Do you think I give my love away?
(Would I lie?) That's not the kind of game I play
I'm telling you, baby, you will never find another girl
In this heart of mine (In this heart of mine, deep in my heart)
Woo

Look into my eyes, can't you see they're open wide?
Would I lie to you, baby, would I lie to you? (Oh, yeah)

Don't you know it's true, girl, there's no one else but you?
Would I lie to you, baby, yeah? (Would I lie to you?)
(Come on, come on, come on, come on and kiss me, baby)
