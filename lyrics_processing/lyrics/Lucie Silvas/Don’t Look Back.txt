My intuition tells me
That this relationship's not working, but we
Pretend we're better off not knowing, only
To realise we can't go on
Tried to tell you
But you didn't wanna listen to me
Say things we don't wanna admit to, but it's no good
'Cause it's time to walk away

I can't explain
My reasons any more
The talking is over
And now I'm out the door

And if I don't look back
Then I won't see how much I hurt you
I really hurt you
And if I don't look back
It doesn't mean I didn't love you
I didn't love you

Please don't ask me
'Cause I can't take the way you're looking at me
Every time we touch it makes me feel so guilty
And I can't do this anymore
You might also like
I can't explain
I've said it all before
And I won't be persuaded
I'm half way out the door

And if I don't look back
Then I won't see how much I hurt you
I really hurt you
And if I don't look back
It doesn't mean I didn't love you
I didn't love you
It doesn't mean I didn't love you

(Ooh na na na) It doesn't mean I didn't love you
(Ooh na na na) It doesn't mean I didn't love you
(Ooh na na na) Oh, it doesn't mean I didn't love you
(Ooh na na na) Oh oh oh oh oh
I can't explain, my reasons any more
It's over, your heart's out of my hands

And if I don't look back (I don't look back)
Then I won't see how much I hurt you
I really hurt you
And if I don't look back (no)
It doesn't mean I didn't love you (I-I-I-I)
I didn't love you (I-I-I)
And if I don't look back (I don't look back)
Then I won't see how much I hurt you (then I won't see)
I really hurt you (then I won't see)
And if I don't look back (oh oh oh oh oh oh oh)
It doesn't mean I didn't love you (it doesn't mean I didn't love you, ohhh)
I didn't love you

And if I don't look back
Then I won't see how much I hurt you (I won't see how much I hurt you no)
I really hurt you
And if I don't look back (I don't look back)
It doesn't mean I didn't love you (I-I-I-I)
I didn't love you
