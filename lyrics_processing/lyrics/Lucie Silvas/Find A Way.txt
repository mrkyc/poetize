The more I give you love
You tell me it's never, never, never
The more I wanna give up
You know, it's much better, better, better

I put myself together just right
So it looks good to you
(I try but I) am falling every time
'Cause you are a mystery to me

How do I find a way to your heart, -eart, -eart?
Where do you go when you're not alone?
I can't find a way to your heart, -eart, -eart
Nobody know, know, knows

The more you shut me out
You see me come runnin', runnin', runnin'
The more I turn it around
You say you got nothin', nothin', nothin'

You're a model of experience
I see you have been here before (every time)
Somebody else believe it:
This boy's gonna change just for me (ooh)

Oh

When you look at me
The sun is out, and it feels so good
Then you forget about me
And it feels so cold
And it feels so cold, ooh
Oh nobody know, knows
Hey, yeah

How do I find a way to your heart, -eart, -eart?
Where do you go when you're not alone?
