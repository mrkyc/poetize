Oh baby tell me, what's your sign?
Need to know what you're made of
Oh if you're versatile and volatile
Then you and me fit like a glove

And I feel that the fire where the levels are down
The deeper I go
Ooh and I've got time for the highest highs and all of the lows

I'll take a first rate heartbreak
Over a second rate love
And all my favorite mistakes
Are the hardest ones
Baby I'll be the , give me the toxic
Instead of the old, wasn't good enough
I'll take a first rate heartbreak
Over a second rate love, love

Na-na-na, na-na-na
Na-na-na, na-na-na

Oh I lean on my destructive side
I got a thing for reckless men
Mmh, if I get my hand on the dial
I'm gonna turn it up to 10
You might also like
Turn it right to define it and 
Lo and behold
All the while in my mind, if you leave me alone
I'm in love with the hot and the cold

I'll take a first rate heartbreak
Over a second rate love
And all my favorite mistakes
Are the hardest ones
Baby I'll be the , give me the toxic
Instead of the old, wasn't good enough
I'll take a first rate heartbreak
Over a second rate love, love

Oh na-na-na

Take me right through the fire leading to paradise
Lo and behold
I've been out of my mind and you leave me alone
I get lost, I get lost, I get lost
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Take a first rate heartbreak
Over a second rate love
Yeah all my favorite mistakes
Are the hardest ones
I'll take a first rate heartbreak
Over a second rate love
And all my favorite mistakes
Are the hardest ones
Baby I'll be the , give me the toxic
Instead of the old, wasn't good enough
I'll take a first rate heartbreak
Over a second rate love, love

Na-na-na, na-na-na
I'll take a first rate heartbreak
