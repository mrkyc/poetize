Why throw it all away?
It wasn't easy to obtain
How do you keep your patience when I do it over and over again?
And God it seems so hard
Cause nothing in life makes sense when you tear it apart

When I try moving on
It doesn't mean my faith is gone
It's nothing more than distance
Maybe that will keep us strong
No I won't let you down
Cause nothing in life makes sense when you're not around

And if I choose
To keep on climbing, climbing the ladder
Will I lose what I've found?
I'm gonna need you
There at the bottom, arms wide open
Ready to catch me when I'm sliding down

And nothing comes for free
And now everything I see
Is how bad I try to take your place and all the love you give to me
Baby if I win I'll loose
Cause nothing I have even matters if I don't have you
If I don't have you
You might also like
And if I choose
To keep on climbing, climbing the ladder
Will I lose what I've found?
I'm gonna need you
There at the bottom, arms wide open
Ready to catch me when I'm sliding down

And I know
I'm not giving you what you want
I'm not giving you what you need
With the faith of a little bird
Fly away to opportunity
And I roll the dice and I don't know which side up
Oh it's gonna fall
And even though each day I get a little bit closer I might end up with nothing at all

And if I choose
To keep on climbing, climbing the ladder
Will I lose what I've found?
I'm gonna need you
There at the bottom, arms wide open
Ready to catch me when I'm sliding down
Oh if I choose
To keep on climbing, climbing the ladder
Will I lose what I've found?
I'm gonna need you
There at the bottom, arms wide open
Ready to catch me when I'm sliding down
Ready to catch me when I'm sliding down

Why throw it all away
