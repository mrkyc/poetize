Mmmmmm

Maybe I gave too much
But you made me feel like everything I did was never enough
I'm gonna let my heart be over-ruled
There's nothing more to me and you
While you've been so preoccupied
I've had time to realise that I can do a little better than you

If I'd known better then I never would've let it begin
But imperfection is hard to see, from the outside lookin' in
I need the things that you denied me
I need someone to inspire me
Someone I can hold on to

It's too late
That somebody just ain't you
It's too late
I can do without you
Tell me that you want me to stay
I could make believe that you mean what you say
Well it doesn't feel that way
You might also like
I thought that I could change who you are
I over esitmated myself I didn't get me very far
But love is only what you make it
You're not ready to embrace it
And what are you waitin' for?

It's too late
That somebody just ain't you
It's too late
I can do without you
Tell me that you want me to stay
I could make believe that you mean what you say
Well it doesn't feel that way
Well it's much too late for change

Oooh...
Well I tried brakin' you down
You just weren't comin' around
It's too late to try and work it out

It's too late
That somebody just ain't you
It's too late
I can do without you
Tell me that you want me to stay
I could make believe that you mean what you say
It's too late
That somebody just ain't you
It's too late
I can do without you
Tell me that you want me to stay
I could make believe that you mean what you say
Well it doesn't feel that way

Well it doesn't feel that way
