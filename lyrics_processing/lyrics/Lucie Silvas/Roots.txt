I could pull them up
But they're all that's left of me
Of me

There is fear in the thought of freedom
There are ways out and I see them
But I choose to be held captive
As crazy as I know that is

I find strength in the sorrow
Wanna wake up with it tomorrow
Oh, but all we try would be in vain
If it were that easy to just walk away

Roots that run that deep
Pain that you don't see
Anyone could look around
Think all is well above the ground
I could pull them up, but they're all that's left
And I'm not ready to lose you yet

I tell myself it doesn't hurt
But the truth still lies there in the dirt
I am lost, and I have a map
But all it does it take me back
You might also like
Roots that run that deep
Pain that you don't see
Anyone could look around
Think all is well above the ground
I could pull them up, but they're all that's left
And I'm not ready to lose you yet

And the past is the only place I know
If I can't stay there, where will I go?
Where will I go? Where will I go?
Where will I go?
There is fear in the thought of freedom

Roots that run that deep
Pain that you don't see
Anyone could look around
Think all is well above the ground
Roots that run that deep
Pain that you don't see
Anyone could look around
Think all is well above the ground
Oh, and I could pull them up, but they're all that's left
And I'm not ready to lose you yet
And I'm not ready to lose you yet
Lose you yet
No, I'm not ready
No, no
