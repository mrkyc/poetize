Keep looking 'round
While your head is spinning you don't see the ground
Oh if I had a penny for each place i found
I thought that I belonged
Don't jump across
'Cause swimming in deep water showed me what love was
So I will just be thankful if I leave because
It lead me right to you

So give me one good reason not to let go
Tell me something that I don't already know

Believe me
I don't need to
Look any further than you
You may be
The one who I build my world around

And I moved on
Kept thinking if I take a chance I could be wrong
If that's the case then what's the point in this at all
What more can I give
You might also like
And if I see you trying to find your way home
I reassure you here is where you need to go

Believe me
I don't need to
Look any further than you
You may be
The one who I build my world around
This feels like
The right thing
And if you don't try you'll never know
I could be
The one who you build your world around

So give me one good reason not to let go
Tell me something that i don't already know
So give me one good reason not to let go
Tell me something that i don't already know, oh

Believe me (believe me)
I don't need to (I don't need to)
Look any further than you (any further than you)
You may be (you may be)
The one who I build my world around (don't you know this feels like)
This feels like (oh the right thing)
The right thing (the right thing)
And if you don't try you'll never know
I could be (I could be)
The one who you build your world around (world around, oh)
Believe me (oh believe me)
I don't need to (don't need to)
Look any further than you (no no than you)
You may be (you may be)
