Oh
Oh oh oh

I've looked at you a thousand times
And only now I see
Everything I hoped to find
Staring back at me
Like waking up to a sunrise
With colours I've not seen before
When you're lying there asleep
I look at you and smile
Gives me time to stop and think
Like I made it all worthwhile
It's so easy to forget
I never noticed all the little things you do
That make me realise

And I love though it may not show
Not sure I ever told you so
And now everything that I was looking for
Has lead me right here to your door
I love you this much and more
Oh and mo-o-o-re, oh-oh
You might also like
We know that everything has changed
That's just the way we are
We don't know what the future brings
We haven't got that far
The way I feel remains the same
'Cause it's just the little things we say and do
That makes us who we are

And I love though it may not show
Not sure I ever told you so
And now everything that I was looking for
Has lead me right here to your door
I love you this much and more

You're beautiful, you're wonderful, you make it all believable
You're everything my heart can take
Now I know that all I feel and
And all I've felt was real
I've gotta find the words when you're awake
Oh-oh-oh

And I love though it may not show
Not sure I ever told you so
And now everything that I was looking for
Has lead me right here to your door
And I love though it may not show
Not sure I ever told you so
And now everything that I was looking for
Has lead me right here to your door
I love you this much and more
Oh yeh yeh yeh more, more
