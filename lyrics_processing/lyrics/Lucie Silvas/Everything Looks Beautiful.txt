Love has a way
(Of blaming the darkness)
Soft as the rain
(To feel like a blossom)
No matter which way things goes
(Tonight we're the strongest)

We'll hold each other's hands
Dancing slowly to the band
Letting the music take over

I guess that's why everything looks so beautiful
When you're in love
Over time, we'll turn the desert to shades of gold
When it's sweet enough
Light as a feather, shining like a treasure
Everything is better, it's true
I guess that's why everything looks so beautiful
So beautiful when you're in love
When you're in love

I kiss is a drink
(And you found a fountain)
So why don't we see
(The magic that's happened?)
If you never let me go, boy
(If you never let me go)
You'd be the new fashion
You might also like
There's a brightness in your eyes
I've never seen until tonight
Everything's hazy but you

I guess that's why everything looks so beautiful
When you're in love
Over time, we'll turn the desert to shades of gold
When it's sweet enough
Light as a feather, shining like a treasure
Everything is better, it's true
I guess that's why everything looks so beautiful
So beautiful when you're in love
When you're in love
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh)
Light as a feather, shining like a treasure
Everything is better, it's true
I guess that's why everything looks so beautiful
So beautiful when you're in love
Over time, we'll turn the desert to shades of gold
When it's sweet enough

(When you're in love, when you're in love)
When you're in love, love, love
(When you're in love, you know, you know)
When you're in, when you're in
(When you're in love, when you're in love)
When you're in, when you're in
(When you're in love, you know, you know)
When you're in love, I know
(When you're in love, when you're in love)
When you're in, when you're in
(When you're in love, you know, you know)
Love
When you're in love, everything looks beautiful
