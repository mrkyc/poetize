Without you, I have room to breathe
And if I'm weak then you can't see my insecurities
Without you, I can do what I choose
Cause when you got no one to love you got nothing to lose

Will there come a time
When my head finds it easier
To not think about this
And I would do anything
To stop the weight of my heart getting heavier
My only conclusion is

That nothing compares to you
No matter where I look
No matter what I do
Cause that garden of Eden you took me to
Is now over grown
And the love I've known is gone without you
Is gone without you

Without you, I can kid myself
That my idea of perfect love is not a fairytale
Without you, I don't need to explain
There's no one to answer to and I got no one to blame
You might also like
I can do my thing, cause who cares what tomorrow brings
When you got nothing to miss
And every time I hide in the arms of another I realise
It still comes to this

That nothing compares to you
No matter where I look
No matter what I do
Cause that garden of Eden you took me to
Is now over grown
And the love iv known
Is gone without you

What is the flower that never blooms
What's the night sky without its moon
If I'm the music you're the tune
Don't hear a sound here without you

Cause nothing compares to you
No matter where I look
No matter what I do
Cause that garden of Eden you took me to
Is now over grown
Cause nothing compares to you
No matter where I look
No matter what I do
Cause that garden of Eden you took me to
Is now over grown
And the love I've known
Is gone without you

Is gone without you
Is gone without you
