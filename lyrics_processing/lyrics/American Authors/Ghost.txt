In the morning when the sun breaks free
A reflection that I know I've seen
In the night it's haunting me
A lonely ghost, a lonely ghost
Ever since I was just a child
I've seen the visions in my sleep
Of a man roaming through the wild
With all these ghosts, a lonely ghost

But you can't breathe in if you don't breathe out
'Cause it's a new day, we're gonna go far
Knuckle down, trim and shake off the dead weight
You know what they say
You can't hide from your ghosts
'Cause it's a new day, I wanna go far
Break it down, jump the gun, find a new way
You know what they say
I'm stuck here living with all these ghosts, a lonely ghost

I'm looking back at a room for two
The skeletons of all we knew
That we were only broke and bruised
As you held me close along the coast
When the morning settles in
And I've learned how to live with it
I can't rewind all the things I did
And all these ghosts, the lonely ghosts
You might also like
But you can't breathe in if you don't breathe out
'Cause it's a new day, we're gonna go far
Knuckle down, trim and shake off the dead weight
You know what they say
You can't hide from your ghosts
'Cause it's a new day, I wanna go far
Break it down, jump the gun, find a new way
You know what they say
I'm stuck here living with all these ghosts, a lonely ghost

Now we know we'll never be alone, alone
And we know I wanna be alone, alone

'Cause it's a new day, we're gonna go far
Knuckle down, trim and shake off the dead weight
You know what they say
You can't hide from your ghosts
'Cause it's a new day, I wanna go far
Break it down, jump the gun, find a new way
You know what they say
I'm stuck here living with all these ghosts, a lonely ghost
