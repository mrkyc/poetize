We say 'I love you'
We go to parties
We never argue
But baby something's changed
We ain't got no love anymore

There's not one thing about you
That I would ever change
There's just this thing that I can't explain
Don't wanna be without you
But it can't stay this way
Don't know what happened but I'll take the blame

Now we're runnin' runnin' runnin' in circles
We're runnin' runnin' runnin' in circles

We say 'I love you'
We go to parties
We never argue
But baby something's changed
We say don't worry
But I think we got to
This house is burning
Cause baby something's changed
You might also likeCause we ain't got no love anymore
We ain't got no love
We ain't got no love anymore

There's just some things about me
That I wish I could change
You're running on empty
And I'm so drained
I feel you toss and turning
I can even feel your pain
Could we just hit rewind and start again

Now we're runnin' runnin' runnin' in circles
We're runnin' runnin' runnin' in circles

We say 'I love you'
We go to parties
We never argue
But baby something's changed
We say don't worry
But I think we got to
This house is burning
Cause baby something's changed
Cause we ain't got no love anymore
We ain't got no love
We ain't got no love anymore

But if we can't go back to what we knew
The different people that we grew into
Instead of running off to someone new
I'd rather start again and grow with you
We say 'I love you'
We go to parties
We never argue
But baby something's changed

We say 'I love you'
We go to parties
We never argue
But baby something's changed
We say don't worry
But I think we got to
This house is burning
Cause baby something's changed
Cause we ain't got no love anymore
We ain't got no love
