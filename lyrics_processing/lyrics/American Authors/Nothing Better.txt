I don't believe it, I don't believe it
I don't believe it's true
There is nothing better than you
La-de-la-de-do, there is nothing better than you

You're right, I'm wrong
Every single time
You're perfect, and it's true
You're hot, I'm cold
Every single night
I'm nothing without you

I don't believe it, I don't believe it
I don't believe it's true
There is nothing better than you

Slow it down, hurry up
Never miss a beat
All the beautiful things you say
Button up, tuck it in
Always looking at me
You make me look so great
You might also like
I search for gold, oh yeah
But I found you
Because I've been high, yeah, I've been low
But I'm nothing without you

I don't believe it, I don't believe it
I don't believe it's true
There is nothing better than you
La-de-la-de-do, there is nothing better than you
All that we've been through, there is nothing better than you

Hot mess, hot damn
I'm always on by
But you keep me on my toes
Bury it, dig it up
I'm working hard
I'm reaping what I sew

I search for diamonds, yeah
But I found you
Because I've been high, yeah, I've been low
But I'm nothing without you
But I don't believe it, I don't believe it
I don't believe it's true
There is nothing better, there is nothing better
There is nothing better than you
All that we've been through, there is nothing better than you
La-de-la-de-do, there is nothing better than you
All that we've been through, there is nothing better than you

All this talk about love, it's just a feeling
It's just a feeling
I let it all go
All this talk about love, it's just a feeling
It's just a feeling
I let it all go
All this talk about love, it's just a feeling
It's just a feeling
I let it all go
All this talk about love, it's just a feeling
It's just a feeling
I let it all go

But I don't believe it, I don't believe it
I don't believe it's true
There is nothing better, there is nothing better
There is nothing better than you
La-de-la-de-do, there is nothing better than you
All that we've been through, there is nothing better than you
La-de-la-de-do, there is nothing better than you
