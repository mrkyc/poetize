I feel like hell
I'm all over the place
Can't believe I'm seeing you in this random space
You know I miss you
Do you believe in fate?

If you think the universe is so big and vast
Don't wanna be alone
You moved on too fast
I didn't catch his name
Just trying to catch my breath

Of course it's you
I'd seen them walking down the street
Maybe the world is telling me it's never easy

So listen up
My heart is dark
I know that I've been replaced
I've had enough
I've tried to love
Keep coming back to this place
I wanna be free and let you fly away
To see your smile
Upon you face
It's the hardest part of being replaced
You might also like
I heard you moved in
Wasn't that our plan?
Still wake up in the morning
And I reach for your hand
I failed chemistry, I don't understand

Most days I sleep in
See more night than day
I had all the answers now the questions have changed
It's a running joke that I can't escape

So listen up
My heart is dark
I know that I've been replaced
I've had enough
I've tried to love
Keep coming back to this place
I wanna be free and let you fly away
To see your smile
Upon you face
It's the hardest part of being replaced

It's never easy
It's never easy
Of course it's you
I'd seen them walking down the street
Maybe the world is telling me it's never easy

So listen up
My heart is dark
I know that I've been replaced
I've had enough
I've tried to love
Keep coming back to this place
I wanna be free and let you fly away
To see your smile
Upon you face
