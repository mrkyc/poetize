I've got these letters tattooed on my arm
That remind me each second
Of where I come from
And the long hard road
To guide me back home
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

Back to my mama who raised me up right
And back to my lady I held every night
It's a long hard road trying to get home
I've been gone now for too long

I'm not trying to stop a hurricane
I'm not trying to shake the ground below
I'm just trying to find a way to make it back home
I'm not trying to part the ocean waves
I'm not trying to overthrow the throne
I'm just trying to find a way to make it back home
I'm just trying to get home
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
You might also like
I've got this image engraved in my mind
Of a light that I had in a whole different time
It still breathes and lives at the end of the road
I've seen mountains and valleys through my missing days
But I never once parted with how you begged me to stay
I will run down that long, hard, and treacherous road to get home

I'm not trying to stop a hurricane
I'm not trying to shake the ground below
I'm just trying to find a way to make it back home
I'm not trying to part the ocean waves
I'm not trying to overthrow the throne
I'm just trying to find a way to make it back home
I'm just trying to get home
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

I've been gone for so long
But my heart, it carries on
As it pounds like a drum
On my journey back home
I've been gone for so long
But my heart, it carries on
I won't give up
I'm not trying to stop a hurricane
I'm not trying to shake the ground below
I'm just trying to find a way to make it back home
I'm not trying to part the ocean waves
I'm not trying to overthrow the throne
I'm just trying to find a way to make it back home
I'm just trying to get home

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
