This life I choose takes me so far away from you
So far away from you
It's bittersweet when I look at the screen of my phone
The picture of me and you
I miss every piece of you

The way you fall asleep on the couch at night
Laying in my arms always slows down time
When you drop me off, wish I'd miss my flight
'Cause I hate goodbyes, I hate goodbyes
Oh, I can't wait to see your smile again

It's been five long nights not by your side, and I miss your touch
At 4 AM I call your phone and wake you up
To tell you three more days 'til the two of us can finally be one
I've been counting down the hours 'til I see you, my love
I'll say it five more times, no, I won't lie, I miss you so much
Only four more nights 'til I get home, been long enough
And now there's three more days 'til the two of us can finally be one
I've been counting down the hours 'til I see you, my love

It feels like years since the very last time I held you and I saw you last, I saw you last
The distance between us has messed with my heart
And it fucked with my head, with my head
You might also like
The way you sing along to your 90's tunes
When we get so high laughing at cartoons
Drive the coast up north just to chase the view
Wish I could stay with you, wish I could stay with you

It's been five long nights not by your side, and I miss your touch
At 4 AM I call your phone and wake you up
To tell you three more days 'til the two of us can finally be one
I've been counting down the hours 'til I see you, my love
I'll say it five more times, no, I won't lie, I miss you so much
Only four more nights 'til I get home, been long enough
And now there's three more days 'til the two of us can finally be one
I've been counting down the hours 'til I see you, my love
I've been counting down the hours till I see you, my love
I've been counting down the hours till I see you, my love

I'm trying to close the distance
I'll see you any minute
I'm trying to close the distance
I'll see you any minute
I'll see you any minute

It's been five long nights not by your side, and I miss your touch
At 4 AM I call your phone and wake you up
To tell you three more days 'til the two of us can finally be one
