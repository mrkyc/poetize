My mind, my body, my soul
Feeling like I got nowhere to go
So take one down and pass it around
And give me your love like you love this town
I work all day, and I work all night
But it's not enough to get you off my mind
My mind, my body, my soul
I need to make more money than ever before
But making music always changes
And what I find, no it ain't the same
Can't afford the life that I wanna buy
Or the big white house for you and I

My mind, my body, my soul
Only feels good standing out in the cold
Can't tell my girl that I lost my heart
Made a few mistakes, and I've gone too far
My head's a mess, and I'll never change
Not strong enough to hold this weight
My mind, my body, my soul
I need forgiveness from anyone's lord
I've seen what's right, and I've seen what's wrong
Can't tell a difference between those songs
Am I a hero or the devil's son?
I can't figure out what side I'm on
You might also like
My mind, my body, my soul
I miss my brother more than ever before
I wish we could have just one more drink
What I would give for you to watch me sing
Mom and Dad, yeah, I know they're proud
But I'd rather have you here right now
My mind, my body, my soul
I'm feeling like I got nowhere to go
I remember my past, I remember those names
Four years of love gone down the drain
Time spent wasted, time well spent
But I'm all alone with no wife and kid

I feel like a bird
Floating through the sky, just a little bit
I feel like a bird
Floating through the sky, just a little bit
Oh, don't take me down to the valley tonight
Don't take me down to the river, 'cause I get lost
Oh, so lost
I feel like a bird
Floating through the sky, just a little bit

My mind, my body, my soul
Floating through the sky, just a little bit
My mind, my body, my soul
