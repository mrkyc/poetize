Some say if you don't go
Then you won't know how to let go
When you gotta let it swerve
Some say if you don't try
Then you won't know how to get by
No one said it wouldn't hurt
Oh, no

If I knew then what I should've known now

Up and down, jump off the deep end
Wreck this house, I should've left with you, with you
No way out, I met your best friend, she went down
I should've made my move, with you

I shoulda, I woulda, I coulda, but I didn't
Hit it

Some say if you break down, and you touch ground
Then you dropped out still you got a lot to learn
But I say take it back up
Throw it on now, make it stack up
'Cause tonight we're gonna burn it down
You might also like
If I knew then what I should've known all along

Up and down, jump off the deep end
Wreck this house, I should've left with you, with you
No way out, I met your best friend, she went down
I should've made my move with you
Messed up now, pissed off the in-crowd
Break this town, my eyes are set on you, on you
We know now I'm not your best friend
Broke all bounds I'll make it up to you, to you

I shoulda, I woulda, I coulda, but I didn't
Hit it

I'm feeling lucky
Lay all my cards down
Nothing can stop me
Tonight, we go all out
I'm feeling lucky
I'll bet my hometown
Nothing can stop us now
But I say if you don't know then you go slow
Or you don't go
Don't be a no-show
Just let go, let's get stoned
From the top down
To the down low, download
Let's go!
I say if you don't know
Then you go slow
Or you don't go
Don't be a no-show
Just let go, let's get stoned
From the top down
To the down low, download
Let's go!
(You, you)
(You, you)

Up and down, jump off the deep end
