Excuse my lack of patience
But today I'm feeling faceless
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
Can I go on?
My mind said I'm a-wasting
My life ain't keeping pace
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
Can I go on?

I need a miracle
I need a saint
I need a hero to lift away
I need a miracle
But not for long

I, I'm on my own
My own hero
I will stay strong
I'm on my own
No undertone could bring me down
I feel like superman
I feel like superman
You might also like
My laugh is understated
'Cause I don't think I can fake it
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
Can I go on?
Been locked inside this cage
And I don't think I can break it
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
Can I go on?

I need a miracle
But not for long

I, I'm on my own
My own hero
I will stay strong
I'm on my own
My own hero
I'm not alone
No undertone could bring me down
I feel like superman
I feel like superman

I'm making waves
Oh, I'm making waves
In my heart again, I'm making waves
I'm making waves
Oh, I'm making waves
In my heart again, I'm making waves
I draw life through what the people say
I'm making waves, I'm making waves
I feel like superman
I feel like superman
(I'm on my own) Yeah, I'm on my own
(I'm not alone) I don't know, I don't know, I don't know where to go
(I'm on my own) Yeah, I'm on my own
(I'm not alone)
(I'm on my own, my own hero, I'm not alone)
I feel, I feel, I feel it in my bones
I feel, I feel, I feel it in my soul
I feel, I feel, I feel like superman
