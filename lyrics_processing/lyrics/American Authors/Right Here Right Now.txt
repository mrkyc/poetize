Hey!
I wanna sip champagne on private planes
I wanna scream my name on the top of the Eiffel Tower
On the Eiffel Tower
I wanna hit that blackjack twenty-four
I wanna take that money, and run right here, right now
Oh, right here, right now

But I won't take that train
I won't catch that flight
If you're not on that plane
We ain't takin' off tonight

All the money in the world, baby
Don't mean a goddamn thing
'Cause you're all that I want
Oh, and even if we're broke, baby
Don't mean a goddamn thing
'Cause you're all that I want
Right here, right now
Right here, right now

I wanna steal the show in Tokyo
I wanna karaoke, bump it a little bit louder
A little bit louder (Hey)
I wanna sing-a-long with Elton John
In a white limousine rolling, right here, right now
Oh, right here, right now
You might also like
But I won't take that train
I won't catch that flight
If you're not on that plane
We ain't takin' off tonight

All the money in the world, baby
Don't mean a goddamn thing
'Cause you're all that I want
Oh, and even if we're broke, baby
Don't mean a goddamn thing
'Cause you're all that I want
Right here, right now

I need you, right here, right now
Oh, I need you, right here, right now
Yeah, I need you, right here, right now

Oh, I wanna scream your name
Wanna make you smile
Let's be runaways, leave it all behind
Will you take that train?
Will you catch that flight?
If you're on that plane, we'll be takin' off tonight
All the money in the world, baby (No)
Don't mean a goddamn thing
'Cause you're all that I want
Oh, and even if we're broke, baby
Don't mean a goddamn thing
'Cause you're all that I want
Right here, right now

I need you, right here, right now
Oh, I need you, right here, right now
