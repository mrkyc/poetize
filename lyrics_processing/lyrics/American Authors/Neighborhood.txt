I left my mother feelin' sick in her bedroom
My daddy told me, "Son, you best grow up"
I told my friends they can find me on the internet
'Cause somehow this place just ain't enough
Collect call from a brother in the lockup
He said he paid his dues, but could I pay 'em too?
My best friend is stealing money from my pocket
I guess it's time to go, and they said

"Who, who are you? Who are you really anymore?"
I said, "Who, who am I? I don't know what I'm heading for"

I said, "Oh no, oh no, I'm leaving again"
I said "Goodbye, so long" to my, my neighborhood
And I know, I know I'll see you again
'Cause I'll always, always come back to my neighborhood
To my neighborhood

I threw my troubles and my bags in the backseat
Pulled up a drive for one last look
She was standin' in the doorway lonely
After leanin' in close and she said
"Who, who are you? Who are you really anymore?"
You might also like
I said, "Who?"
(Said "Who?)
Who am I?
(Who am I?)
I don't know what I'm fighting for"

"Oh no, oh no, I'm leaving again"
I said "Goodbye, so long" to my, my neighborhood
And I know, I know I'll see you again (I'll see you again)
'Cause I'll always, always come back to my, to my neighborhood
To my neighborhood
To my neighborhood

Came back last night just to see you
It's been too long but nothing's changed
I'm trying to be the one that you can't be
Maybe these dreams, they all to blame
I can hear it in your voice that you do know
It's not a choice for me to stay
So long, goodbye to the neighborhood
To my neighborhood

I"Oh no, oh no, I'm leaving again, I'm leaving again"
I said "Goodbye, so long" to my, to my, my neighborhood
And I know, I know I'll see you again, I'll see you again
'Cause I'll always, always come back, come back to my, to my neighborhood
My neighborhood, my neighborhood
My neighborhood, my neighborhood
