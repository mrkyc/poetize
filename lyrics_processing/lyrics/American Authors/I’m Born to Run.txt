I'm born to run down rocky cliffs
Give me grace, bury my sins
Shattered glass and black holes
Can't hold me back from where I need to go
Yellow hills and valleys deep
I watch them move under my feet
Stranger things have come and gone
To see the world and take the throne

Don't hold back
Oh, I won't hold back

I'm gonna live my life like I'm gonna die young
Like it's never enough, like I'm born to run
I'm gonna spend my time like tomorrow won't come
Do whatever I want like I'm born to run
I wanna see Paris, I wanna see Tokyo
I wanna be careless even if I break my bones
I'm gonna live my life like I'm gonna die young
Like it's never enough, like I'm born to run

A winding road where strangers meet
To feel the love of a warm drink
My body moves, it's speaking loud
Don't have to say what I'm thinking now
You might also like
Don't hold back
Oh, I won't hold back

I'm gonna live my life like I'm gonna die young
Like it's never enough, like I'm born to run
I'm gonna spend my time like tomorrow won't come
Do whatever I want like I'm born to run
I wanna see Paris, I wanna see Tokyo
I wanna be careless even if I break my bones
I'm gonna live my life like I'm gonna die young
Like it's never enough, like I'm born to run

All these things I've seen and done
I live my life like I'm born to run
All these things I've seen and done
I live my life like I'm born to run
(I was born, born, born, born, born to run
I was born, born, born, born, born to run)
All these things I've seen and done
I live my life like I'm born to run

I'm gonna live my life like I'm gonna die young
Like it's never enough, like I'm born to run
I'm gonna spend my time like tomorrow won't come
Do whatever I want like I'm born to run
I wanna see Paris, I wanna see Tokyo
I wanna be careless even if I break my bones
I'm gonna live my life like I'm gonna die young
