My home don't feel the same
Last year flew by; goodbye to the good vibes
What we thought were the best times
Nights out with the people I love
Now I'm lost in the neighborhood
That raised me, praised me, made me who I am
But my father was twice the man
And now that pain's resurfacing

Brooklyn don't feel the same
Maybe I'm the one who's changed or the one to blame
Another drink down the drain
Ten more before I get on that plane
I swear I knew just what to say
It's all there on the tip of my tongue
But I don't feel good enough for anyone

But I won't fold
I know cause I-I-I-I got this feeling

I ain't never giving up, I ain't never ever, I ain't never ever giving up my pride
I ain't never letting go, I ain't never ever, I ain't never ever gonna sell my soul
I-I-I-I got this feeling
I-I-I got this feeling
I ain't never giving up, I ain't never ever, I ain't never ever giving up my pride

Pushed out of the family tree
Upside down, but it was a good life
I fell hard for the wine in France
I didn't call you back cause I was learning to dance
And this is who I'd become
It's all there on the tip of my tongue
Wish I was good enough for anyone

No, I won't fold
I know cause I-I-I-I got this feeling

I ain't never giving up, I ain't never ever, I ain't never ever giving up my pride
I ain't never letting go, I ain't never ever, I ain't never ever gonna sell my soul
I-I-I-I got this feeling
I-I-I got this feeling
I ain't never giving up, I ain't never ever, I ain't never ever giving up my pride

Take or leave who I am
Cause this is me

Like a fish out of water
Do I belong here?
But I'm never gonna lose, I'm never giving up my pride
I'm lost in the ocean
Like a note in a bottle
But I'm never gonna lose, I'm never giving up my pride
This is me, who I am

I ain't never giving up, I ain't never ever, I ain't never ever giving up my pride
I ain't never letting go, I ain't never ever, I ain't never ever gonna sell my soul
I-I-I-I got this feeling
I-I-I got this feeling
I ain't never giving up, I ain't never ever, I ain't never ever giving up my pride

Take or leave who I am
