I remember father holding my hand
I remember when he said be a man
It's time to run it's time to chase what you were always meant to be
I remember screaming out I'm so scared
Afraid to fall feeling so unprepared
What if I don't leave the ground
Cuz I've been chained by gravity

He said it's true
That you might just fail
You won't regret it
And I know that if you stay true to yourself
You just might win it
Oh he said

Don't wait my child
Go live your life because the sky's the limit
Don't wait my child
Go live your life because the sky's the limit
Go live your life because the sky's the limit
You might also like
I remember waking up out of breath
I remember mother's tears when I left
Another love another life where I was always meant to be
I remember telling her my big dream
Asking her if it was hard to believe
What if I don't leave the ground
Cuz I've been chained by gravity

She said it's true that you might just fail
You won't regret it
And I know that if you stay true to yourself
You just might win it
Oh she said

Don't wait my child
Go live your life because the sky's the limit
Don't wait my child
Go live your life because the sky's the limit
Go live your life because the sky's the limit
Go live your life because the sky's the limit

Try to catch me now, try to catch me now, try to catch me now, try to catch me
'Cause I'm flying, oh, I'm flying
Try to catch me now, try to catch me now, try to catch me now, try to catch me
'Cause I'm flying, oh, I'm flying
Don't wait my child
Go live your life because the sky's the limit
Don't wait my child
Go live your life because the sky's the limit
Go live your life because the sky's the limit
Go live your life because the sky's the limit
