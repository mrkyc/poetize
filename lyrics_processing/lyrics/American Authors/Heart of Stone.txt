Oh, now you never come around
And then you're spacin' out tonight
I bet I feel it in my chest
The visions in your head, they're all lies
Oh, yeah, it's true
Oh, yeah, it's true
Well I, I need a friend tonight
I need to make it right
And now I'm tired of thinkin'
In spite, I'm always in the right
I never made the time
It's all the smiles I'm fakin'

Oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh, yeah, it's true (Oh, oh-oh, oh)

You've got this heart of stone
I'm never breakin' through
Feels like a dead-end road
So take that any way you want to
You've got this heart of stone
That's keepin' me from you
If I break that, you hate that
So take that any way you want to
You might also like
Inhale, another thought fails
Fallin' off the rails, tonight
Untamed, c-c-crazy train
I'm always yours to blame in your eyes
Shake-a-shake it off now
Then you're take-a-taking off now
All around so you can shoot me down
I should have gotten out before you started beggin'

Oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh, yeah, it's true (Oh, oh-oh, oh)
Oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh, yeah, it's true

You've got this heart of stone
I'm never breakin' through
Feels like a dead-end road
So take that any way you want to
You've got this heart of stone
That's keepin' me from you
If I break that, you hate that
So take that any way you want to
Oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh
If only I could live a little bit longer (Oh, oh-oh, oh)
If only I could live a little bit longer (Oh, oh-oh, oh)
If only I could live a little bit longer (Oh, oh-oh, oh)
If only I could live a little bit longer (Oh, oh-oh, oh)

You've got this heart of stone
I'm never breakin' through
Feels like a dead-end road
So take that any way you want to
You've got this heart of stone
That's keepin' me from you
If I break that, you hate that
So take that any way you want to

(Oh, oh-oh, oh) Any way, any way, any way (Oh, oh-oh, oh)
Any way you want to (Oh, oh-oh, oh)
Any way (Oh, oh-oh, oh)
