I've walked a million miles
To chase down my own desires
Out of fire, sea and stone
Born to find that great unknown
And when I find my joy, I'ma bring it on home

Bring it on home, bring it on home
Bring it on home
When I find my joy, I'ma bring it on home
Bring it on home, bring it on home
Bring it on home
When I find my joy, I'ma bring it on home
Yeah

I hung my heart up to dry
On rooftops under blue skies
No, I never would have grown if I'd never been alone
So when I find my love, I'ma bring it on home (Come on)

Bring it on home, bring it on home
Bring it on home
When I find my love, I'ma bring it on home
Bring it on home, bring it on home
Bring it on home
When I find my love, I'ma bring it on home
(Yeah, whoo!)

When I find my love
When I find my love, I'ma bring it on home

I've run the highest wire
I've laughed, smiled, cried and been called a liar
I thought to myself, win, lose or fail
I won't let this train derail
And when I find myself, I'ma bring it on home

Bring it on home, bring it on home
Bring it on home
When I find myself, I'ma bring it on home
Bring it on home, bring it on home
Bring it on home
And when I find myself, I'ma bring it on home

Home, home is where the heart is
Love is where you'll find it
I'ma bring it on home, I'ma bring it on home
Home, home is where the heart is
Love is where you'll find it
I'ma bring it on home, I'ma bring it on home
Home, home, home, bring it on home
When I find myself, I'ma bring it on home
Home, home, home, bring it on home
