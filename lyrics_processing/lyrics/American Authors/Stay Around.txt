I don't know what I would do
If I was left alone to my own devices
I need to fight this
Sometimes I feel that I'm not acting right
All my life, I've been acting childish
Don't mean to be like this

But I swear I'm gonna take my time
And I hope that you don't change your mind
So I swear I'm gonna take my time
Oh, I know it's hard to find someone like you
I don't wanna let down

I hope you stay around, stay around
I hope you stay around
I hope you stay around, stay around
I hope you stay around
Ooh, when you see me at my worst
My, my, my worst
I hope you stay around, stay around
I hope you stay around

Sometimes I put up a wall to protect how I feel
When I fear the darkness
My heart is guarded
Lighting my fuse is so easy to do
No excuses, I make it harder
For that, I'm sorry
You might also like
'Cause I swear I'm gonna take my time
And I hope that you don't change your mind

I hope you stay around, stay around
I hope you stay around
I hope you stay around, stay around
I hope you stay around
Ooh, when you see me at my worst
My, my, my worst
I hope you stay around, stay around
I hope you stay around

Tell me that it's all okay
Keep me from digging my own grave
Tell me it's okay
'Cause I know it's hard to find someone like you
I don't wanna let down

I hope you stay around, stay around
I hope you stay around
I hope you stay around, stay around
I hope you stay around
Ooh, when you see me at my worst (When you see me at my worst)
My, my, my worst
I hope you stay around, stay around (I hope, I hope)
