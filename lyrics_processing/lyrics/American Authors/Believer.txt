I'm just a believer, that things will get better
Some can take it or leave it, but I don't wanna let it go
I'm just a believer, that things will get better
Some can take it or leave it, but I don't wanna let it go

I'm a little bit sheltered
I'm a little bit scared
I'm a little bit nervous
I'm going nowhere
I'm a little bit jealous
I'm a little bit slow
I'm a little bit hurtful
And I don't wanna let it go
No, and I don't wanna let it go
I'm a little bit angry, when everyone's around
But I get a little lonely, when no one's out
I feel my demons misleading me

I'm just a believer, that things will get better
Some can take it or leave it, but I don't wanna let it go
I'm just a believer, that things will get better
Some can take it or leave it, but I don't wanna let it go

Maybe when I get older
And I'm in the ground
The weights off my shoulders it was bringing me down (down)
I've never been that lucky I've never tasted fame (fame)
I'm always looking for something but I hate changin'
Time fades
There's no space
As life breaks new ground

I'm just a believer, that things will get better
Some can take it or leave it, but I don't wanna let it go
I'm just a believer, that things will get better
Some can take it or leave it, but I don't wanna let it go

It doesn't matter what is out there
My head is spinning and it won't bail out
It doesn't matter what is out there
'Cause time fades
There's no space
As life breaks new ground

Some can take it or leave it, but I don't wanna let it go
