I threw away my innocence when I was seventeen
Lost track of what's magnificent, forgot my memories
But I'm marchin' on to a different drum
And nothing will stand in my way

No, you can't stop me now
No, you can't stop me now
Hangin' on by a thread (Thread)
Hangin' over my head (Head)
But you won't knock me down (Up, up, up, up)
Hear the roar of the crowd
No, you can't stop me now
No, I'm nothin' like you (Hey)
I got so much to prove (Prove)
No, you won't knock me down (Up, up, up, up)

I woke up from a dream, the voices sounded dissonant
I followed a path that wasn't mine (Up, up, up, up)
Took on the enemy, I told myself I'd never quit
I gotta move forward, not back in time
Singin', "Ah-ooh, I'm gonna show you, show you"
The man in the mirror stole all my pride
Ooh, now that I know you
You might also like
No, you can't stop me now
No, you can't stop me now
Hangin' on by a thread (Thread)
Hangin' over my head (Head)
But you won't knock me down (Up, up, up, up)
Hear the roar of the crowd (Up, up, up, up)
No, you can't stop me now (Up, up, up, up)
No, I'm nothin' like you (Hey)
I got so much to prove (Prove)
No, you won't knock me down (Up, up, up, up)
Hey, hey!

When I was seventeen, I threw away my innocence
The worst part of me took over my mind
Singin', "Ah-ooh, I'm gonna show you, show you"
The man in the mirror stole all my pride
Ooh, now that I know you

No, you can't stop me now (No, you can't, no, you can't)
No, you can't stop me now (Oh, nobody's stopping me)
Hangin' on by a thread (Thread)
Hangin' over my head (Head)
But you won't knock me down
(No, you can't, no, you can't, no, you can't, no, you can't)
Hear the roar of the crowd (Up, up, up, up)
No, you can't stop me now (Up, up, up, up)
No, I'm nothin' like you (I'm nothin' like you)
I got so much to prove (Got so much to prove)
