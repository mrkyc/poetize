How can we make amends
When we said all we said
I call and you don't pick up?
How can I say instead
That I hope it's for the best?
I won't, and I won't give up
I'm sorry mother
I know I let you down
I'm sorry for how
I up and left this town
How can we push aside
All the bad and make it right
Now you got me all choked up

I'm sorry brother
I know I let you down
I'm sorry for how
I up and left this town
But please, just listen
'Cause I don't ask for much
I am my own man
I make my own luck

How can we both take sides
When we know nothing's right?
Open up the door that's shut
How can I have my pride
And drink away my soul tonight?
Sorrows filling up my cup
You might also like
I'm sorry father
I know I let you down
I'm sorry for how
I up and left this town
But please, just listen
'Cause I don't ask for much
I am my own man
I make my own luck

Well some birds aren't meant to be caged
And I just can't see the light of day
Please, forgive me, I can't remember
Please, forgive me, no one is calling
Please, forgive me, I can't believe it, no
Gonna pick myself up, so I don't let this ember grow
Even if I mess up, I won't let this ever go
It's hard to stay, it's hard to stay
'Cause some birds aren't meant to be caged

How can I set us free?
I'm what you taught me to be
Shouldn't that be enough
It's time that we make amends
Let's forget the things we said
You know we were all just stuck
I'm sorry mother
I know I let you down
I'm sorry father
I didn't stick around
But please, just listen
'Cause I don't ask for much
I am my own man
I make my own luck

Please, just listen
'Cause I don't ask for much
Just like my old man
I make my own luck

And some birds aren't meant to be caged
And some just can't see the light of day
Please, forgive me, I can't remember
Please, forgive me, no one is calling
Please, forgive me, I can't believe it, no
Gonna pick myself up, so I don't let this ember grow
Even if I mess up, I won't let this ever go
It's hard to stay, it's hard to stay
'Cause some birds aren't meant to be caged
Please, just listen
'Cause I don't ask for much
I am my own man
I make my own luck
Please, just listen
'Cause I don't ask for much
I am my own man
