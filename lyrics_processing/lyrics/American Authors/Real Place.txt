I told you that I'd call
I got caught up with some people that never got to know me at all
Guess I was wrong
Is it all my fault?
For thinking that my reason for leaving was a reason at all
Maybe you're better off

Oh, I got something that I need to say out loud, oh
Oh, I'll be coming back now just to talk it out

From a real place, I just wanna know the truth
From a real place, tell me how to get to you, to you

Turns out I was lost
I was busy with a lover, God knows I never loved her at all
I needed somewhere to fall
This is where I belong
Standing right in front of you waiting for the past to move, oh
I'll give it all that I got

Oh, I got something that I need to say out loud, to say out loud
Oh, I'll be coming back now just to talk it out, to talk it out

From a real place, I just wanna know the truth
From a real place, tell me how to get to you, to you

I remember late nights driving in the taxi, back seat
Black leather jackets in a back streets asking
Take me back, take me back
I remember staying up high, we were chasing, making
All the wrong moves in right places, saying
Take me back, take me back

To a real place, I just wanna know the truth
From a real place, tell me how to get to you, to you

Place
(From a real place, from a real place
From a real place, from a real place)
Real place
(From a real place, from a real place
From a real place, from a real place)
Place
(From a real place, from a real place
From a real place, from a real place)
Real place
