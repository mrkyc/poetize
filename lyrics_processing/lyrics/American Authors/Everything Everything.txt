I spent my whole life dreamin' of a perfect world
Where I thought you'd be (Thought you'd be)
I spent my whole life waiting for a moment
With you next to me (Next to me)

I pull you closer and closer
Closer and closer
I don't wanna let you go

Hey-yo, hey-yo, yo, hey
I don't wanna miss out on a single day
Hey-yo, hey-yo, yo, hey
I don't wanna miss out on a single day
'Cause you're my everything, everything
Everything, everything
Hey-yo, hey-yo, yo, hey
I don't wanna miss out on a single day
Hey-yo, hey-yo, yo, hey
I don't wanna miss out on a single day
'Cause you're my everything, everything
Everything, everything

I heard your name up in the sky above the trees
When it came to me (Came to me)
I spent my whole life trying to fill my heart
When you're all I need (All I need)
You might also like
I pull you closer and closer
Closer and closer
I don't wanna let you go

Hey-yo, hey-yo, yo, hey
I don't wanna miss out on a single day
Hey-yo, hey-yo, yo, hey
I don't wanna miss out on a single day
'Cause you're my everything, everything
Everything, everything
Hey-yo, hey-yo, yo, hey
I don't wanna miss out on a single day
Hey-yo, hey-yo, yo, hey
I don't wanna miss out on a single day
'Cause you're my everything, everything
Everything, everything

Hey, whoo
Hey, alright

It took my whole life
It took my whole life
To fall back into you
It took my whole life
It took my whole life
To fall back into you
I don't wanna let you go
Hey-yo, hey-yo, yo, hey
I don't wanna miss out on a single day
Hey-yo, hey-yo, yo, hey
I don't wanna miss out on a single day
'Cause you're my everything, everything
Everything, everything (Hey-yo)
Hey-yo, hey-yo, yo, hey
I don't wanna miss out, no, I don't wanna miss out
No, I don't wanna miss out
I don't wanna miss out on a single day
'Cause you're my everything, everything
