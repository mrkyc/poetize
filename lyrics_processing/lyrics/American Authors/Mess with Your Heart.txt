Well, if the city's not too big for your taste
And your hometown feels a million miles away
When the walls close in, and the only time you're honest is
When you're speaking through a satellite in space

You say you haven't met a single soul you trust
Always worried about the smoke from another stranger's gun
Let me show you I've got nothing left to hide
And all I have to give to you is my love

Yeah, I really, really wanna take the time now
And I really, really wanna change your mind now
So don't worry I won't mess with your heart
I'll be your neon light in the dark
On nights when the clouds cover the stars
I won't mess with your heart
Won't mess with your heart
I won't mess with your heart

And I promise that I'll be right here to listen
I'll shatter all your doubts and all your intuitions
Every cab ride home I'll call you just to know
That you made it safe and sound going back to Brooklyn
You might also like
Yeah, I really, really wanna take the time now
And I really, really wanna change your mind now
So don't worry I won't mess with your heart
I'll be your neon light in the dark
On nights when the clouds cover the stars
I won't mess with your heart
Won't mess with your heart
I won't mess with your heart

The way you've memorized each rhyme in Adam's lyrics
You sing out loud just like nobody's listening
And all I'm asking is for that kind of love
And I promise you will never regret it

So don't worry I won't mess with your heart
I'll be your neon light in the dark
On nights when the clouds cover the stars
I won't mess with your heart
Won't mess with your heart
