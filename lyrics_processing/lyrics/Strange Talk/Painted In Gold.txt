Don't paint me grey like
You ran out of color
Don't breathe too hard
This flame from an ignited spark
Just turn the page we'll write history together
When will we land if we take a dive into the dark?

Show me your hand, lay it all on the table
Don't count your cards when
You know you'd be walking away
Lets take a chance if temptation is forever
When will this end?
Ooh I'll throw it all in just the same
