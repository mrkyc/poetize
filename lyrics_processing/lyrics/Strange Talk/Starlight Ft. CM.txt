Don't wanna go out  all on my own
 city around, kicking the pavement
If you got something to say, you could just say it
It's hard to me
I've tried to tell you, you're not here with me
Just let me stay
Don't wanna, don't wanna go
Running through the starlight
Through the sunrise
Looking in your eyes
 diamond shine bright
Feeling this love but I bet you know that
It  up high, don't let me go know
Running through the starlight with you
That's where I wanna be
That's where I wanna be
Running through the starlight with you
That's where I wanna be right now
Now all the colors are faded
I feel my feet start to touch the ground
I know we 
But we chasing it round and round
You might also likeOh now you just hard for me
I try to tell you, you're not here with me
Just let me stay
I don't wanna, don't wanna go
Running through the starlight
Through the sunrise
Looking in your eyes
 diamond shine bright
Feeling this love but I bet you know that
It  up high, don't let me go know
Running through the starlight with you
That's where I wanna be
That's where I wanna be
Running through the starlight with you
That's where I wanna be right now
Don't let go
Don't switch you heart off
Don't switch it off
Don't switch it off
Don't let go
Don't switch you heart off
Don't switch it off
Don't switch it off
Don't let go
Don't switch you heart off
Don't switch it off
Don't switch it off
Don't let go
Don't switch you heart off
Don't switch it off
Don't switch it off
Running through the starlight with you
That's where I wanna be
That's where I wanna be
Running through the starlight with you
That's where I wanna be right now
Running through the starlight with you
That's where I wanna be
That's where I wanna be
Running through the starlight with you
