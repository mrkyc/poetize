In a time of wanting more
I can go without it
They'll be closing every door
Take a picture, don't look back
I don't care if I loose track
Switching off, I'm in pitch black
Fade out the lights to pitch black

You know, you know just look back
Fade out the lights to pitch black
You know, you know just like that
Stay in, stay in down low

I've been wanting to stay down low
Never wanted to be unsure
Only wanted to stay down low
To be unsure is way too complicated
I've been wanting to stay down low
Never wanted to be unsure
Only wanted to stay down low
To be unsure is

Hate it out I can't pretend
Living life without it
Smoking mirrors 'till the end
Going off that one time friend
Keep them guessing I'm not there
Disappear into thin air
Fade out the lights to pitch black
