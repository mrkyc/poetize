Mr. Lincoln, I wish you were here
The Republic's changed a lot in a hundred years
And I don't think it's working like you planned
Oh, Mr. Lincoln, we could use a hand

I just read the headlines in The Nashville News
And I wish I'd made this up, but I'm afraid it's true
'Cause a man was murdered for his money in the street
He was takin' his wife to a nice place to eat

When they caught the man
He did twenty-three months of time
He pled insanity like they do now all the time
Sir, what would you have done in 1859?

Now if you shoot someone, sir, you can get off scot-free
It's the latest thing, Mr. Lincoln, can you believe?
Now they sue the manufacturers of the guns
Ain't the law changed a lot since 1861?

Mr. Lincoln, I wish you were here
'Cause things have changed a lot in a hundred years
And I don't think it's working out like you planned
Hey, Mr. Lincoln, we sure could use a hand
You might also like
I just heard the news story on the radio
They let dangerous men out of prisons now, yes sir I'm afraid it's so
'Cause they're overcrowded, and it was only his fifth offense
Yeah, and this time he's killed someone, does that make any sense?

Now, my lawyer called me about a nuisance case
'Cause everybody sues over any little thing these days
Well, at least we're right, all we gotta do is tell the truth
He said, "You're living in the past, you romantic fool"
I said, "You've got that right, I lean toward the older ways
And there's damn few backwoods lawyers left today"

Mr. Lincoln, I wish you were here
The Republic's changed a lot in a hundred years
And I don't think it's working like you planned
Hey, Mr. Lincoln, we sure could use a hand

Mr. Lincoln, please, could you come here?
'Cause things have changed a lot in a hundred years
And I don't think it's working out like you planned
