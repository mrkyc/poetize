If heaven ain't a lot like Dixie
I don't want to go
If heaven ain't a lot like Dixie
I'd just as soon stay home

I was one of the chosen few to be born in Alabam'
I'm just like my daddy's son, I'm proud of who I am
I went through a lot of good women
And shook old Jim Beam's hand
If I never see the pearly gates
I've walked through the promised land

If heaven ain't a lot like Dixie
I don't want to go
If heaven ain't a lot like Dixie
I'd just as soon stay home
If they don't have a Grand Ole Opry
Like they do in Tennessee
Just send me to hell or New York City
It would be about the same to me

I've got wild honey trees and crazy little weeds
Growing around my shack
These dusty roads ain't streets of gold
But I'm a happy right where I'm at
All these pretty little southern belles are a country boy's dream
They ain't got wings or halos, but they sure lookin' good to me

It would be about the same to me
