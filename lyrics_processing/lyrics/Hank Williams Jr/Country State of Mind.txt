That hot old summer sun make you beg for your next breath
So you best be on the creek bank, laid in the shade
Chewin' on a hickory twig, pass that bottle, I'll have me a swig
I ain't got a lot, but I think I got it made in the shade

I'm just laid up here in a country state of mind
Catchin' these fish like they're goin' out of style, drinkin' this homemade wine
Hey, if the sun don't come up tomorrow, people, I've had a good time
I'm just laid up here in a country state of mind

I bet the old man's in the kitchen, he's got my kind of music on his radio
Oh, drinkin' his beer and dialin' up the request lines
Mama and old Aunt Joan probably in the dinin' room tryin' to use the phone
Me, I'm thinkin' about that girl and later tonight

I'm just laid up here in a country state of mind
Hey, I'm catchin' these fish like they're goin' out of style, I'm drinkin' this homemade wine
And if the sun don't come up tomorrow, people, I've had a good time
I'm just laid up here in a country state of mind

You know, the rednecks and the preppies, they're in their discos and honky-tonks
Somewhere between raisin' hell and amazin' grace
Lord, I know just how they feel, you gotta get out and kick up your heels
And ain't it great to be livin' in the U.S.A

Me, I'm laid up here in a country state of mind
Catchin' these fish like they're goin' out of style, drinkin' this homemade wine, all the time
If the sun don't shine tomorrow, people, I have had a good time
I'm just laid up here in a country state of mind
