People think we're nearing the end of time
But we've had enough and we've drawn the line
Our flag is up since our people went down
And we're together from the country to town
We live back in the woods you see
Big city problems never bothered me
But now the world has changed and so have I
And America can survive, America will survive
We can plow our fields all day long
We can catch our fish from dusk 'til dawn
Yeah, we have toughed it out a time or two
These are dark days but we're gonna pull through
We grow good old tomatoes, we got hometown pride
America can survive, America is gonna survive

'Cause you can't scare us out, you can't make us run
What we got here is freedom and fun
We say grace and we say "ma'am"
If they don't like that, we don't give a damn

We came from the West Virginia coal mines
The Rocky Mountains and the big city skylines
Hey, we can hit back and we're gonna be fine
'Cause this old country can survive, America can survive
I had a good friend in New York City
Never called me Hank, he called me hillbilly
My grandpa taught me how to live off the land
And his taught him to be a street-smart man
He used to send me pictures of the Broadway lights
And I'd send him some of that homemade scufflin' wine
He was lost like so many in the terrible strife
And we're all askin' God, now "Why, oh, why?"
I read, "A tooth for a tooth and a eye for an eye"
And that's an old slogan we're gonna revive
'Cause America can survive
America will survive
You might also like
'Cause you can't scare us out, you can't 'em us run
We're the boys and girls that have freedom and fun
We say grace and we say "ma'am"
If they don't like that, we give less than a damn

We're from North California and South Alabam'
And all they've done is unite the whole land
There's no more Yankees and Rebels this time
But one united people that stand behind
America can survive, America will survive
