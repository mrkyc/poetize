Well, my mama met my daddy down in Alabam'
They tied the knot so here I am
Born on the bayou on the Texas line
Loved in Louisiana and raised on Jambalaya

Now before I could walk, I had a guitar in my hand
By the time I could talk, I had my own band
I went on the road when I was eight years old
When I turned fifteen, I was stealing the show

Money to burn and the girls were pretty
It didn't take me long to learn that I was born to boogie

When I was eighteen, I went to Hollywood
I met Elvis and Marilyn and Johnny B. Goode
Got my guitar painted and some California sun
A red Cadillac, having too much fun

Now we were playing them halls and jamming then
And we moved it on over to MGM
They said, "This is the boy we've been telling you about"
He lit a cigar and stuck his hand out
He said, "Son, have we got a deal for you
I'm gonna make you a star
Give you fifty thousand too"
I told him, "My Momma didn't raise no fool"

"I'll take your money, I'll make your movie
I'll tell you right now I was born to boogie"

Well my name is Bocephus, I drink whiskey by the gallon
And I never back down and I love a good challenge
What I do now is what I did then
I like to get down with all my rowdy friends

Now I can be sweet and I can be mean
I still got my hat and I still wear my jeans
My shades are chrome, my guitar is steel
If you think I won't then believe me I will

Get down on you, baby, 'cause I ain't no rookie
