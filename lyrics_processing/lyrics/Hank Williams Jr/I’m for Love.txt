Mothers against drunk drivers, the Pope is against the pill
The union's against the workers working against their will
The president's against the congress, the senate is against the house
People are against politicians and I'm against cats in the house

But I'm for love and I'm for happiness
And I'm for "if you don't like it, can't you just let it pass?"
And I'm for turning off the news and turning down the lights
'Cause I'm for nothing else but me and you tonight

The city is against the county, the county's against the state
The state is against the government and the highway still ain't paved
The banker's against the farmer, the farmer's against the wall
Doctors against me smoking and the devil's against us all

But I'm for love and I'm for happiness
And I'm for "if you don't like it, can't you just let it pass?"
And I'm for turning off the tube and turning down the light
And I'm for nothing else but me and you tonight

The cops are against the robbers, the laws are against the cops
Justice is against the system and some people are blowing their tops
The horse is against the automobile, the bus is against the train
The train is against the jumbo jets and I'm against fishing in the rain
You might also like
But I'm for love, I'm all for happiness
And I'm for "if you don't like it, can't you just let it pass?"
And I'm for turning off the tube and turning down the light
And I'm for nothing else but you and me tonight

Hey, I'm for love, I'm all for happiness
And I'm for not looking for something to make us mad
I'm all for turning off the news and turning down the lights
