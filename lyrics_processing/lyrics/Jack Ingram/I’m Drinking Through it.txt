Sometimes you realize there ain't a damn thing you can do
I've tried everything but there just ain't no pleasing you
Gone round after round
Now you're shuttin' it down
Go ahead and break us in two
Walk out the door and believe that I'm broken and blue

You fixed me, you fucked me
You hate me, you love me
You drive me right out of my mind
I could bitch, I could cry
I could lay down and die
But that ain't gonna happen tonight
There's nothing to it
I'm drinking through it

Sometimes you're thirsty and sometimes you just need a drink
Sometimes a heartache don't hit you as hard as you think
Sometimes it feels good to drown
So order me up one more round
I'll dive deep in your memory tonight, but I ain't gonna sink

Yeah, you fixed me, you fucked me
You hate me, you love me
You drive me right out of my mind
I could bitch, I could cry
I could lay down and die
But that ain't gonna happen tonight
There's nothing to it
I'm drinking through it
I'm drinking through it
You might also like
Can't go over it, can't go under it
You just drink right through it
Can't go over it, can't go around it
You just drink right through it
Yeah that's how you do it
When you're drinkin' through it
You're drinking through it
Yeah, you're drinking through it
Yeah, you're drinking

You fixed me, you fucked me
You hate me, you love me
You drove me right out of my mind
I could bitch, I could cry
I could lay down and die
But that ain't gonna happen tonight
Yeah, there's nothing to it
Yeah, There's nothing to it
Yeah, that's how we do it
I'm drinking through it
I'm drinking through it
Hey, I'm drinking through it
One, two, three
You fixed us, you fucked us
You hate us, you love us
You drive us right out of our minds
We could bitch, we could cry
We could lay down and die
But that ain't gonna happen tonight

That's how we do it
We're drinking through it
Hey, we're drinking through it
That's how we do it
We're drinking through it
We're drinking through it
We're drinking through it
We're drinking through it
We're drinking through it
We're drinking through it
We're drinking through it
We're drinking through it
We're drinking through it
We're drinking through it
We're drinking through it
We're drinking through it
