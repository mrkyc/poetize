Here's to Willie
And here's to Waylon

Where there's smoke, you'll find fire
Where there's fire, you'll find a crowd
Where there's people, there's a party
Party people love it way way loud

Where there's a guitar, there's a hippie
Where there's a hippie, there's a song
Where there's a song, there's a singer
Singing break your heart all night long

Where there's a country band that's playing
There's a cowboy heart that's breaking
Where there's whiskey, there's hope
Everybody's gonna get as drunk as a goat
Where there's night, there's day
There's a will, there's a way
Down in Texas, we have our own saying:
Where there's a Willie (There's a Willie)
There's a Willie (There's a Willie)
There's a Waylon
You might also like
Where there's an outlaw, you'll find trouble
Where there's trouble, you'll usually find a girl
Where there's a girl, there's a guy in a bar
Who just can't get over her

So baby, if you're thinking about leaving
Please please, baby, give me one more kinda chance
Where there's a river called the Guadalupe
There's a Gruene Hall where we can dance

Where there's a country band that's playing
There's a cowboy heart that's breaking
Where there's whiskey, there's hope
Everybody's gettin' drunk as a goat
Where there's night, there's day
There's a will, there's a way
Down in Texas, we have our own saying:
Where there's a Willie (There's a Willie)
There's a Willie (There's a Willie)
There's a Waylon

Where there's a country band that's playing
There's a cowboy heart that's breaking
Where there's whiskey, there's hope
Soon we'll all get drunk as a goat
Where there's night, there's day
There's a will, there's a way
Down in Texas, we have our own saying:
Where there's a Willie (There's a Willie)
There's a Willie (There's a Willie)
There's a Waylon

Where there's night, there's day
There's a will, there's a way
Down in Texas, we have our own saying:
(There's a Willie) There's a Willie
(There's a Willie) There's a Willie
There's a Waylon
Where there's a Willie (There's a Willie)
There's a Willie (There's a Willie)
(Yeah)
There's a Waylon
There's a will, there's a way
Down in Texas, we have our own saying:
Where there's a Willie (There's a Willie)
There's a Willie (There's a Willie)
There's a Waylon
Where there's a Willie (There's a Willie)
There's a Willie (There's a Willie)
