If I were to tell you the truth
And the truth is she ain't been gone that long
But I've been wondering what I'm supposed to do
Call her up, tell her I miss her
I do but I don't wanna be with her
I can feel myself getting weaker
And I just know I've gotta see her
Chorus
I don't go with her when she leaves
But where she's goin' she takes me
I don't go with her when she leaves
But where she's goin' she takes me
You see I'm the kinda guy who likes to drive
And she's got a fast car so you know I like that
While I'm never asked to pay for gas
If it should happen I could fix a flat
You see that's the times when I come through
It's one rare moment she don't know what to do
Now I know that don't seem like much
But hey it's just enough to keep in touch
Chorus
I don't go with her when she leaves
But where she's goin' she takes me
I don't go with her when she leaves
But where she's goin' she takes me
Takes me
Take me
You might also likeNow some folks like it
If at night they stay at home all by themselves
But me I go crazy thinkin'
Maybe there might not be someone else
Knocking on my door and ringing my phone
Coming to my house and taking me home
There's only one reason she don't stay
It's cause I work so damn hard to push her away
Chorus
I don't go with her when she leaves
But where she's goin' she takes me
I don't go with her when she leaves
But where she's goin' she takes me
I won't go with her
No no i won't go with her
No I won't go with her when she leaves
But where she's goin' she takes me
Take me
Take me
Take Me
