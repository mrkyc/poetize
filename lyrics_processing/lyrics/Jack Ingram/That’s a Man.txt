About one more struggling single mother
She was talking about how hard it is getting by
With no help, no money, no nothing from the baby's father
Made me think about this guy I know with a wife and a child
Who's working two jobs just to get by
Yeah, he says he'd do anything he could in this world
Just to give his young family a better life; yeah, a better life
Oh, that's a man
That's a 19-year-old, modern-day hero man
Those two young Marines over there fighting for their country
Man, they're gonna be friends forever
They've both come back eventually
But as bonds and destiny would have it
They don't come back together
Yeah, the one who lived to tell about
Why he can't even talk about it
Keeps fighting that fight up there in his head
Ain't a day goes by he don't wonder why
Why it wasn't me instead
It could've been me instead
Oh, that's a man
That's a you don't know how hard he tried to save his buddy's life man
I don't know about you
Sometimes, I just need a little reminder
And reach down and find some understanding
Find some kind of kindness

Had been farming the same land in Ohio for 100 years
Felt like he'd paid for it ten times over
With his own blood, his own sweat, and his own tears
If he had to, he'd be out there on that tractor working
Seven long, hot days a week
Yeah, he's the kind of feller that people get real quiet
When he stands up in church to speak
They know when he speaks
Oh, that's a man
That's a stand tall, walk straight
Put God's share in the collection plate man
