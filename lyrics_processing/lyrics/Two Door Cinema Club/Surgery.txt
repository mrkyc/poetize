You see me
And I see you
Tell me what you think we're gonna get up to
You see me
And I see you
What you think we're gonna do?

Coffee
Eyebrow
Change in my pocket I forgot about
Wondering what to do with the morning
Something's gotta give me that something
I can try

My head's a gun
Did anybody let you know?
There's another way to take control
But does it matter that you do?
Danger, possibly security

Don't we go
You got me doing what I'm told
Still, nobody lets you go
Baby, how'd you get so cold?
Major sympathy and surgery

Laundry, time-out
Time to discover what it's all about
One more day and I write the story
One more always proves to be boring
Can't deny

My head's a gun
Did anybody let you know?
There's another way to take control
But does it matter that you do?
Danger, possibly security

Don't we go
You got me doing what I'm told
Still, nobody lets you go
Baby, how'd you get so cold?
Major sympathy and surgery
And I say I don't remember all the things I got right
Did you?
We could live this way forever and a day in gaslight
Would you?

Don't we go
You got me doing what I'm told
Still, nobody lets you go
Baby, how'd you get so cold?
Major sympathy and surgery
