I'm your baby girl
Been six years, say I'm, I'm your world
You say the best things that I've ever heard
But darling I wish I was first

Don't wanna be that, wanna be that, wanna be that girl
Don't wanna feel that, wanna feel that, wanna feel that burn
But I found your ex on your Insta
Just wanted to know what you're into

And lately I keep on checking her page, yeah
I don't even know why
Comparing her to me
I don't wanna see these pictures of her
It's driving me crazy
She's kinda cool, she's amazing
She got me thinking why
Why you and me?
Are you gonna leave?
These pictures they hurt
Why'd you make her your ex, your ex, your ex?
Tell me am I next, I'm next, I'm next?
Was it just good sex, good sex, good sex?
Why'd you make her your ex?
