When the lights in my street go out and
All the people lie sleeping under clouds and
They're dreaming of better than this
Then my brother calls me and he's sayin'
"Oh, I can hear the angels praying that we can do better than this"

'Cause I saw a mountain I thought "It's too high"
I heard the birds whisper "You can't fly"
I saw you and I knew I can do better than this, better than this
I heard a language I thought I can't speak
I saw an ocean I thought was too deep
I see you and I know we can do better than this, better than this

And I know you'll take me anywhere I wanna go
And I know you'll make me learn everything that I wanna know
The truth of it is, it doesn't get better than this

When the riddles and the puzzles find me
I wanna let the darkness hide me
But I know there is better than this
And I'm shouting 'cause I see my failings
My fears, my faults, I'm raging
'Cause I know that I'm better than this

Only when we discover that's when we find each other
