Poison are your lips when you're kissing me
But I don't wanna give it up
Why do I do this to myself, when I know you're not good enough?
Say that I could break it off with you
Oh, like I have the choice
I try to run away, but me legs don't work when they hear your voice

And your love is stuck to me like sadness to the blues
Try to shake it but my stomach is tied up in knots at the thought of you

And I don't know why I do the things that I do
I don't know why I can't say no
I don't know why I'm so hung up on you
I can't leave when I can't let go
I don't know why I've given you the power
To lift me up so high then drop me down
And I don't know
Why I'm still around

A bad habit I can't quit
Give it to me, I need it
So hung up, you got me addicted
Never thought I'd be obsessed until I met you
Now I can't let you go

And your love is stuck to me like sadness to the blues
Try to shake it but my stomach is tied up in knots at the thought of you

And I don't know why I do the things that I do
I don't know why I can't say no
I don't know why I'm so hung up on you
I can't leave when I can't let go
I don't know why I've given you the power
To lift me up so high then drop me down
And I don't know
Why I'm still around

No one's worth your tears
And the one that is won't make you cry (make you cry)
So it's time I packed my bags and left, said my goodbye
'Cause it's not my fault
It's time I say no, I'm gonna let go
It's got to be you who's high and dry

I don't know why I do the things that I do
I don't know why I can't say no
I don't know why I'm so hung up on you
I can't leave when I can't let go
I don't know why I've given you the power
To lift me up so high then drop me down
And I don't know
Why I'm still-
And I don't know
Why I'm still-
And I don't know
