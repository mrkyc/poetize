I've had enough
I'm losing my mind
I've spend a life searchin' for what I'll never find
I'm prayin' for silence
Or an easy way out
Tryin' to make sense of what is always in doubt
I'm turnin' the pages
But nothin' changes
The voices in my head won't listen to a word I've said

I know what it takes, think
I'm in a safe place
Then here we go again
Oh and again, oh and again

It's like living on a merry-go-round
And 'round we seem to go
No one ever seems to know why
I'm seein' darkness where the light should be
Madness takin' over me
Listen, many things you will find
In the circus of your mind

I've seen enough
To last for one life
The pain given far between everyone's eyes
Dream of escape
Outside is so near
I go to a new world where everything's clear
Night, at the night, I
Look to the sky to
Help me find a better way, save me before it's too late

I know what it takes, think
I'm in a safe place
So here we go again
Oh and again, oh and again

It's like living on a merry-go-round
And 'round we seem to go
No one ever seems to know why
I'm seein' darkness where the light should be
Madness takin' over me
Listen, many things you will find
In the circus of your mind
The most colorful place
That I can't escape
But someday I'll find my way out
The attic won't open
The looking glass broken
I'm shouting out loud but my voice isn't making a sound

It's like living on a merry-go-round
And 'round we seem to go
No one ever seems to know why
I'm seein' darkness where the light should be
Madness takin' over me
Listen, many things you will find
In the circus of your mind
In the circus of your mind
In the circus of your mind
