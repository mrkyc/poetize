He'll know
When you're tired of neglect and degraded
He'll find out when he wakes up alone
He'll call you ten times but don't take it
Don't take it

Oh-oh-oh
Pack up all your clothes
Car is full of cash, head on down the road
No, no, no
Creepin' on the low
Don't give another chance

This is how you leave a man, make him really understand
He'll do anything that he can
To try to pull you closer, tell you that it ain't over
Remember what I told ya
This is how you leave a man, slippin' right through his hands
He'll do anything that he can
To try to pull you closer, tell you that it ain't over
Remember what I told ya, this is how you leave a man

He'll know
When you change your locks and your number
He's sleeping with people unknown
He'll beg to get back in the covers
Your covers
