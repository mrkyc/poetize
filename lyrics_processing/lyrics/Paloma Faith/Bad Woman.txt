Mm-mhm
I'm a bad woman

Watch the chaos unfurl (Uh)
The walls we built burn
So I spin the wheel and then
I call the shots in the end
Walk away from my homestead
Say, "I'm better on my own instead"
Well, you can have the glory
While I drive into the sunset

I'm not a good girl (Ah, ah), I'm a bad woman
I'm not a good girl (Ah, ah), I'm a bad woman
And you painted me this way (Ah)
Then act surprised when I changed (Ah)
I'm not a good girl (Ah), I'm a bad woman

Picture-perfect house of cards
Call me joker call it art
I threw the dice and gambled it away (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Not saying that it didn't hurt
I paid my duty bed the curse
I broke in two to learn to be apart
