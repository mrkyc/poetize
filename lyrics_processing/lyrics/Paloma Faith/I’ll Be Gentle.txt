Puttin' on a brave face, I wipe the tears away with no trace
I'm OK, Mister Grey
I'm not as strong as you think
There's a hurt behind my smiling face
I say, "I'm OK"

Every saint has a past
Every sinner has a future
And I feel your pain
We all hurt the same

And I'll be there to hold you
There's nothing that I won't do
'Cause we all need a little kindness
All this cruelty is so mindless
I promise I'll be tender
So darling just surrender
I see through all your pretending
So let go 'cause I can take it on

I'll take it on (listen, baby, yeah)
Yeah, I'll be gentle

I see you putting on a brave face
I guess you need to learn to have faith
I'll stay and wait
I shake it off and have a few drinks
And forget about everything they say
I'll be your escape

Every saint has a past
Every sinner has a future
And I feel your pain
We all hurt the same

And I'll be there to hold you
There's nothing that I won't do
'Cause we all need a little kindness
All this cruelty is so mindless
I promise I'll be tender
So darling just surrender
I see through all your pretending
'Cause our love is never ending

Oh, so hold my hand
'Cause I got nowhere else to turn
Please be gentle and be kind
Lend me your ear, lend me your time
Just let it out
It takes a real man to let me see him cry
I'm here to dry your eyes
I see your're hurt, don't cry tonight
And I'll be there to hold you
There's nothing that I won't do
'Cause we all need a little kindness
All this cruelty is so mindless

And I'll be there to hold you
There's nothing that I won't do
'Cause we all need a little kindness
All this cruelty is so mindless
I promise I'll be tender
So darling just surrender
I see through all your pretending
So let go 'cause I can take it on

And I'll be there to hold you
There's nothing that I won't do
'Cause we all need a little kindness
All this cruelty is so mindless
I promise I'll be tender
So darling just surrender
I see through all your pretending
So let go 'cause I can take it on
I'll take it on (oh, take it on)
I'll take it on
Oh, baby
And I'll be gentle
