When the dust settles
And all of our battles are done
You're still here
You know me better
Than no one you read all my scars
Like a script

Every beating I took along the ride
Was a blessing in disguise
And it hurt and I learned
When everything's been said and done
And I know that you're the only one
It was worth it, yeah, so worth it
I realise that I get out of hand
I don't even ask for you to understand
Mmm and sometimes whatever we do
We're damned
I can't apologize for being who I am
Ooh, ooh, I've done my reconciling
I'm over compromising
I need you to see this my way

And love me as I am, ooh, ooh
Love me as I am
Love me as I am, ooh, ooh
Love me as I am

I was rough round the edges
I tried to get ahead just make sense
Of this world
I am still standing
And I've been demanding a lot
I got knocked down

Every beating I took along the ride
Was a blessing in disguise
And it hurt and I learned
When everything's been said and done
And I know that you're the only one
It was worth it, yeah, so worth it
I realise that I get out of hand
I don't even ask for you to understand
Mmm and sometimes whatever we do
We're damned
I can't apologize for being who I am
Ooh, ooh, I've done my reconciling
I'm over compromising
I need you to see this my way

And I love me as I am, ooh, ooh
Love me as I am
Love me as I am, ooh, ooh
Love me as I am
Won't you, please, love me?
Won't you, please, love me?
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
Love me as I am
