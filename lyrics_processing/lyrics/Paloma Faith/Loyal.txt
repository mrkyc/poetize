Wandering eyes that always seem to search out
Other faces in the room
I know we try, pretend that this will work out but
Lately acting's just no good

Maybe we're loyal, maybe we're not
Yeah, we got our secrets but where does it stop?
'Cause you don't remember and I think I forgot
That we made a choice to stay, no matter what

If we're always searching for a love that's perfect
How we ever gonna see just what we got?
Treading water 'til we know it's worth it
Afraid to be the first to open up
Maybe we're loyal, maybe we're not
Yeah, we got our secrets but where does it stop?
If we're always searching for a love that's perfect
How we ever gonna know just what we got?

I don't remember the last time that we made love
Lost in a blind reality
Searching for someone who's standing right before me
Questioning my morality

I wish I could tell you I want it to stop
'Cause you don't remember and I think I forgot
That we made a choice to stay, no matter what

If we're always searching for a love that's perfect
How we ever gonna see just what we got?
Treading water 'til we know it's worth it

Yeah, we got our secrets but where does it stop?
If we're always searching for a love that's perfect
How we ever gonna know just what we got?

Why can't we be loyal?
Why fight what we got when we got it so good?
Why can't we be loyal?
Why fight what we got 'cause

If we're always searching for a love that's perfect
How we ever gonna see just what we got?
Treading water 'til we know it's worth it
Afraid to be the first to open up
