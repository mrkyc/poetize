Angels watchin' over me
With smiles upon their face
'Cause I have made it through this far
In an unforgiving place
It feels sometimes this hill's too steep
For a girl like me to climb
But I must knock those thoughts right down
I'll do it in my own time

I don't care (Care, care)
I'm halfway there (Nowhere)
On a road that leads me straight to who knows where?

I'll tell you what (I'll tell you what)
What I have found (What I have found)
That I'm no fool (That I'm no fool)
I'm just upside down (Just upside down)
Ain't got no cares (Ain't got no cares)
I ain't got no rules (Ain't got no rules)
I think I like (I think I like)
Livin' upside down (Livin' upside down)

Watching people scurry by
Rushin' to and fro
Oh, this world is such a crazy place
It's all about the go, go, go
Sometimes life can taste so sweet
When you slow it down
You start to see the world a little differently
When you turn it upside down

I don't care (Care, care)
I'm halfway there (Nowhere)
And I'm just soaking up magic in the air

I'll tell you what (I'll tell you what)
What I have found (What I have found)
That I'm no fool (That I'm no fool)
I'm just upside down (Just upside down)
Ain't got no cares (Ain't got no cares)
I ain't got no rules (Ain't got no rules)

(Woah, woah, woah)
You gotta slow it down (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
But then you pick it up (Woah, yeah, woah)
Come on and try a little topsy-turvy
Back to front the right way round
Take it slow, slow, slow (You gotta pick it up)
Yeah, yeah, yeah (Let me see you slow it down)
Hey, yo, yo (Tell me something, something)

I'll tell you what (I'll tell you what)
What I have found (What I have found)
That I'm no fool (That I'm no fool)
