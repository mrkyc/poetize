What kind of man gets a thrill from the life he's taken?
How many times can you turn and pretend to see?
Heaven is ours if we want, but we're not courageous

I've had enough, I'm calling you out

Hold up my hands, I swear we're in World War 3
There ain't no peace left here between you and me
These bombs keep blowing when no one's watching
And through my tears I look to the sky and scream
We're in World War 3 (ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh)
We're in World War 3 (ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh)

I'm innocent for my crime and I want my freedom
You shoot me down 'cause you need someone else you can blame
When will it end, when the whole damn world's been beaten?

I've had enough, I'm calling you out

Hold up my hands, I swear we're in World War 3
There ain't no peace left here between you and me
These bombs keep blowing when no one's watching
And through my tears I look to the sky and scream

Over and over, we keep repeating
Frozen in history, time stands still
Over and over, this is a nightmare
Nobody's listening
Kill, kill, kill

Hold up my hands, I swear we're in World War 3
There ain't no peace left here between you and me
These bombs keep blowing when no one's watching
And through my tears I look to the sky and scream
We're in World War 3
