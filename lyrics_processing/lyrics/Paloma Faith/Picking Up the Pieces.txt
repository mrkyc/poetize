Do you think of her when you're with me?
Repeat the memories you made together
Whose face do you see?
Do you wish I was a bit more like her?
Am I too loud? I'll play the clown
To cover up all these doubts

Perfect heart, she's flawless
She's the other woman
Shining in her splendor, you were lost

Now she's gone
And I'm picking up the pieces
I watch you cry
But you don't see that I'm the one by your side
'Cause she's gone
In her shadow, is it me you see?
'Cause all that's left is you and I
And I'm picking up the pieces she left behind

I found a photograph
Behind the TV
You looked so happy, are you missing the way it used be?
And I have changed this room around more often lately
It's clear that me and these four walls
Still know it's hers and yours

Perfect heart, she's flawless
She's the other woman
Shining in her splendor, you were lost

Now she's gone
And I'm picking up the pieces
I watch you cry
But you don't see that I'm the one by your side
'Cause she's gone
In her shadow, is it me you see?
'Cause all that's left is you and I
And I'm picking up the pieces she left behind

Are we liars in denial?
Are we smoke without the fire?
Tell me, please, is this worth it?
I deserve it

'Cause she's gone
And I'm picking up the pieces
I watch you cry
But you don't see that I'm the one by your side
'Cause she's gone
In her shadow, is it me you see?
'Cause all that's left is you and I
And I'm picking up the pieces she left behind
(Picking up the pieces) Oh, I'm picking up the pieces, a broken heart
(Picking up the pieces) Who will save me, who will save me?
(Picking up the pieces) Hey, I am picking up the pieces
Ooh, I am picking up the pieces
Somebody save me, somebody save me
Oh-oh
