I'll be the late night lady you won't recognise
I'm a chameleon, I'm always in disguise
I'll read your future but it's written in the past
Take a good look, might be your last
Don't try to show me, 'cause you don't know me
Stay away

I can be wilder than the wind
A hundred and ninety miles an hour
I'm in a whole other dimension
Dancing doubles on the floor
You think I'm crazy, a little bit hazy
But I'm stone cold sober

You're telling me something
But there's nothing cheap as words
I'm walking away, before I do I flip the bird
Excuse me Mr, I've got other things to do
Than to stand here listening to you
Stop talking at my face
Take a rocket out to space and stay away

I can be wilder than the wind
A hundred and ninety miles an hour
I'm in a whole other dimension
Dancing doubles on the floor
You think I'm crazy, a little bit hazy
But I'm stone cold
I can be wilder than the wind
A hundred and ninety miles an hour
I'm in a whole other dimension
Dancing doubles on the floor
You think I'm crazy, a little bit hazy
But I'm stone cold sober

In the madness of the storm
I'm the one to carry on
I don't need no medicine
If you're looking for a cure
Don't be knocking at my door
I'll never let you in
Take a rocket into space
And stay out of my face

I can be wilder than the wind
A hundred and ninety miles an hour
I'm in a whole other dimension
Dancing doubles on the floor
You think I'm crazy, a little bit hazy
But I'm stone cold
I can be wilder than the wind
A hundred and ninety miles an hour
I'm in a whole other dimension
Dancing doubles on the floor
You think I'm crazy, a little bit hazy
