I'm sorry that the world just ain't good enough for you
Superficial people making gods out of fools
They'll take away your beauty
And they'll blame it on your youth
I wanted more for you

You deserve so much better
Better than all the love, all the happiness
Never give up, don't surrender
Never give up, don't surrender, baby

If there's a God, then I found her in my arms
I saw you looking like the heavens in my dreams
All the joy and all the chaos that I see
I see in your eyes those infinite things
And I'm afraid of the feeling I'm feeling
I try to name it but the words always fail me
All the joy and all the chaos that life brings
I see in your eyes those infinite things

People say I made you but it's clear you made me
My heart has been so broken by the things that I've seen
The only time I feel safe is when I close my eyes to sleep
But I wanted more for you

You deserve so much better
Better than all the love, all the happiness
Never give up, don't surrender
Never give up, don't surrender, baby

If there's a God, then I found her in my arms
I saw you looking like the heavens in my dreams
All the joy and all the chaos that I see
I see in your eyes those infinite things
And I'm afraid of the feeling I'm feeling
I try to name it but the words always fail me
All the joy and all the chaos that life brings
I see in your eyes those infinite things

All I got to give is just not enough
All the words in the world don't describe my love
Such a tiny thing gives me everything
I'm nothing but you give me meaning
You give me meaning, ooh
Didn't know I needed saving
Till I held you in my arms, till I held you in my arms
Listen, darling
I'm nothing but you made me something
I'm nothing but you made me something
I'm nothing but you made me something
(I see heaven in your eyes)
