Hey, hey
My heart is on fire
With a flame that never stops burnin'
If you wanna try
We can go a little higher
You know that you're gonna call me
When you get a little lonely

Sun comes up and the sun goes down
I bet you five dollars I'm still around
Lovers will come and lovers gonna go
But I'm the only lover
That you'll need to know

Well
Hey, hey
My heart is on fire
With a flame that never stops burnin'
If you wanna try
We can go a little higher
You know that you're gonna call me
When you get a little lonely
You might also like
Some will promise
That they'll always need you
They'll keep on promisin'
As they leave you
Win or lose, you got to decide
You got to pay your money
Wanna take that ride?

Well
Hey, hey
My heart is on fire
With a flame that never stops burnin'
If you wanna try
We can go a little higher
You know that you're gonna call me
When you get a little lonely

Love has left you lonely
But you won't be the only
Heart to ever come back
When you've had enough
Then you get a little lonely
Well, the sun comes up and the sun goes down
I bet you five dollars I'm still around
Lovers will come and lovers gonna go
But I'm the only lover
That you'll need to know

Well
Hey, hey
My heart is on fire
With a flame that never stops burnin'
If you wanna try
We can go a little higher
You know that you're gonna call me
When you get a little lonely

Well
Hey, hey
My heart is on fire
With a flame that never stops burnin'
If you wanna try
We can go a little higher
You know that you're gonna call me
When you get a little lonely
When you get a little lonely
When you get a little lonely
