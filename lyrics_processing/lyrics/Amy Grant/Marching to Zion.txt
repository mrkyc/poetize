And let our joys be known;
Join in a song with sweet accord
Join in a song with sweet accord
And thus surround the throne
And thus surround the throne
Refrain
We're marching to Zion
Beautiful, beautiful Zion;
We're marching upward to Zion
The beautiful city of God
The sorrows of the mind
Be banished from the place;
Religion never was designed
Religion never was designed
To make our pleasures less
To make our pleasures less
Refrain
Let those refuse to sing
Who never knew our God;
But favorites of the heavenly King
But favorites of the heavenly King
May speak their joys abroad
May speak their joys abroad

The God that rules on high
And thunders when He please
Who rides upon the stormy sky
Who rides upon the stormy sky
And manages the seas
And manages the seas

This awful God is ours
Our Father and our Love;
He will send down his heav'nly powers
He will send down his heav'nly powers
To carry us above
To carry us above
Refrain
There we shall see His face
And never, never sin!
There, from the rivers of His grace
There, from the rivers of His grace
Drink endless pleasures in
Drink endless pleasures in
Refrain
Yea, and before we rise
To that immortal state
The thoughts of such amazing bliss
The thoughts of such amazing bliss
Should constant joys create
Should constant joys create

The men of grace have found
Glory begun below
Celestial fruits on earthly ground
Celestial fruits on earthly ground
From faith and hope may grow
From faith and hope may grow
Refrain
The hill of Zion yields
A thousand sacred sweets
Before we reach the heav'nly fields
Before we reach the heav'nly fields
Or walk the golden streets
Or walk the golden streets
Refrain
Then let our songs abound
And every tear be dry;
We're marching through Immanuel's ground
We're marching through Immanuel's ground
To fairer worlds on high
To fairer worlds on high
