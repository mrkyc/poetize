Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you
Outside the snow is falling and friends are calling, "Yoo-hoo"
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you
Giddy up, giddy up, giddy up, let's go
Let's look at the show
We're riding in a wonderland of snow
Giddy up, giddy up, giddy up, it's grand
Just holding your hand
We're gliding along with a song of a wintery fairyland
Our cheeks are nice and rosy and comfy-cozy are we
We've snuggled close together like two birds of a feather would be
Let's take that road before us and sing a chorus or two
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you
There's a birthday party at the home of farmer Gray
It'll be the perfect ending of a perfect day
We'll be singing the songs we love to sing without a single stop
At the fireplace we will watch the chestnuts pop
Pop, pop, pop
There's a happy feeling nothing in this world can buy
When they pass around the coffee and the pumpkin pie
It'll nearly be like a picture print by Currier and Ives
These wonderful things are the things we remember all through our lives
