It takes a little time sometimes
To get your feet back on the ground
It takes a little time sometimes
To get the Titanic turned back around
It takes a little time sometimes
But baby, you're not going down
It takes more than you've got right now
Give it, give it time

What's this walking through my door
I know I've seen the look before
Sometimes on faces in the street
And sometimes in the mirror looking back at me
You can't fix this pain with money
You can't rush a weary soul
You can't sweep it under the rug, now honey
It don't take a lot to know

It takes a little time sometimes
To get your feet back on the ground
It takes a little time sometimes
To get the Titanic turned back around
It takes a little time sometimes
But baby, you're not going down
It takes more than you've got right now
Give it, give it time
Yeah, give it time

But it may not be over by morning
And Rome wasn't built in a day
You can name that thing a thousand times
It won't make it go away
Let me put my arms around you
And hold you while you weep
We've been talking and you know what
I'm sick of this talk
It's nothing that won't keep

It takes a little time sometimes
To get your feet back on the ground
It takes a little time sometimes
To turn the Titanic around
It takes a little time sometimes
But baby, you're not going down
It takes more than you've got right now
Give it, give it time

It takes a little more time, more time
(Turn the Titanic around) Turn it around, around, around
(Baby you're not going down) Take a little time sometimes
You can't fix this pain with money
You can't rush a weary soul
You can't sweep it under the rug, now honey
But it don't take a lot to know

It takes a little time sometimes
To get your feet back on the ground
It takes a little time sometimes
To turn the Titanic around
It takes a little time sometimes
But baby, you're not going down
You got things to think of now
So give it, give it time
Give it, give it time

It takes a little time sometimes
It takes a little time sometimes
It takes a little time to get your feet back on the ground
