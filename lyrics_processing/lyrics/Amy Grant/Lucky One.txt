You're the kind
When you love you love with all your might
And you're the kind
I would dream about at night
Now I'm the lucky one
Baby, I'm the lucky one

You're the kind
That I want to be with in the dark and
You're the kind who is capturing my heart
And I'm the lucky one
Baby, I'm the lucky one

And I have never been the one to fall in love so soon
But I could never face another night or day without you
Baby, I'm the lucky one

You're the kind
With poetry and valentines and
You're the kind
Who will never ever leave
And I'm the lucky one
The luckiest girl, my-my, my baby
Baby, I'm the lucky one
