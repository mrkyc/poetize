Don't give up on me
Though I know at times it's hard to see
All my many weaknesses might blind you
I must remind you
Don't give up on me
Even when I act so selfishly
All my views are all I see
And yes, I know there's still so much of me
But God is working constantly
To shape me, He'll remake me

Don't give up on me, I'm gonna make it
I know it's hard for you to see
Don't give up on me, I couldn't take it
If a part of me should keep you from seeing
The part of me that you'd start to believe in
I'm changing so please don't give up on me

Don't give up on me
Even when I fail so miserably
Time and again I know
I stumble, it makes me humble
Don't give up on me
But never let your love begin to be
Hanging on the things you see
Counting all the times I fail to be
Everything you want from me
I'm trying, hear me crying

I know much more than you
How very weak I am
But He believes in me
