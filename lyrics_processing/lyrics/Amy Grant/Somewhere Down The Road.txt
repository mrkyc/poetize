So much pain and no good reason why
You've cried until the tears run dry
And nothing here can make you understand
The one thing that you held so dear is slipping from your hands

And you say, "Why, why, why
Does it go this way?"
And why, why, why?
When all I can say
Is somewhere down the road
There'll be answers to the questions
Somewhere down the road
Though we can not see it now
Somewhere down the road
You will find mighty arms reaching for you
And they will hold the answers at the end of the road

Yesterday I thought I'd seen it all
I thought I'd climbed the highest wall
And now I see that learning never ends
And all I know to do is keep on walking, walking 'round the bend

Sayin', "Why, why, why
Does it go this way?"
And why, why, why?
When all I can say
Is somewhere down the road
There'll be answers to the questions
Somewhere down the road
Though we can not see it now
Somewhere down the road
You will find mighty arms reaching for you
And they will hold the answers at the end of the road

Oh, keep on walking

Why, why, why
Does it go this way?
And why, why, why?
When all I can say, all I know to say now
Is somewhere down the road
There'll be answers to the questions
Somewhere down the road
Though we can not see it now
Somewhere down the road
You will find mighty arms reaching for you
And they will hold the answers at the end of the road

Oh, they will hold the answers at the end of the road

Oh, keep on walking
Woah
Oh, walking down the road
Walking down the road
Somewhere down this lonely road, can't see it now
