Baby if you've got to go away
Don't think I could take the pain
(Stay now, stay now)
Won't you stay another day?
(Stay now, stay now)
Oh don't leave me alone like this
Don't you say it's the final kiss
(Stay now, stay now)
Won't you stay another day?
(Stay now, stay now)
Don't you know we've come too far now
Just to go and try to throw it all away
Thought I heard you say you love me
That your love was gonna be here to stay
I've only just begun to know you
All I can say is won't you stay just one more day?
(Stay now, stay now)
Baby if you've got to go away
Don't think I could take the pain
(Stay now, stay now)
Won't you stay another day?
(Stay now, stay now)
Oh don't leave me alone like this
Don't you say it's the final kiss
(Stay now, stay now)
Won't you stay another day?
(Stay now, stay now)
You might also likeI touch your face while you are sleeping
And hold your hand
Don't understand what's going on
Good times we had return to haunt me
Though it's for you
All that I do seems to be wrong (Seems to be wrong)
(Stay now, stay now)
(Stay now, stay now)
Baby if you've got to go away
Don't think I could take the pain
Won't you stay another day?
(Stay now, stay now)
Oh don't leave me alone like this
Don't you say it's the final kiss
(Stay now, stay now)
Won't you stay another day?
(Stay now, stay now)
Baby if you've got to go away
Don't think I could take the pain
(Stay)
Won't you stay another day?
(Stay now, stay now)
(Stay)
Oh don't leave me alone like this
Don't you say it's the final kiss
(Stay)
Won't you stay another day?
(Stay now, stay now)
(Stay)
Baby if you've got to go away
Don't think I could take the pain

Won't you stay another day?
(Stay now, stay now)
