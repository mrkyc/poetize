Yeah, we're All-Star Atlanta baby, Luda, check
Club packed, know we 'bout be there all night
Tired as hell, jet lag, just got off a flight
But that don't stop me, who? Not me
Pop one bottle, pop two bottles, pop three
Four, five, six chicks in the V.I.P
Seven, eight, nine, naw, they all dimes OG
Louis frames match my Louis kicks on my fifth right
Dirty lame lookin' at me wrong, tell him, "Get right"
Light reflecting off the Bentley, watch now, I'm lit right
Sixes on the candy Range just so I can sit right
Hotter if ya chick nice, I can triple his price
On the black card, got 'em hating, wanna fist fight
Man don't get ya shit sliced, yeah, I hold the fifth tight
We tryna party, lil homie, don't mess up this night
It's a DTP thing, wall-to-wall, it's hype

Luda, Ching-a-ling
I got a car full of women and a truck full of beat
Air full of smoke, glove box full of heat
Heat it and repeat it e'ry day
If the cops ain't on my bumper, everything is okay
What you say we cruise down the block? Jewels on my watch
Fools on my jock so turn this tune up a notch
Cause my whip game's proper, Bentley drop topper
Club's on Luda, drinks on Shaka
I'ma mash that woman, smash that woman
Jump shot fade and pass that woman
Over to Bobby V and tell her to swallow he
Oops, did I say that? Good, oh golly me
Cause it's probably three more women in the cut
Talkin' 'bout tonight, they tryna get fucked up!
And who the hell would I be if I ain't grant them they wish?
Well sure as hell's not Ludacris
Who is this that got his pockets all swole, big bank rolls
A bad lil mama and she ready to go? I'm like

Look, ay, my whip flash, you might catch whiplash
When ya boy dip past, man ain't none of y'all cold as me
My chick lash, she ain't rolled this fast
Watch that new six stash, man can't none of y'all roll like me
Don't get mad, blame my momma them
Plus the Cadillac gangsta grill but don't call me Drama them
My flows, listen to 'em, you might find Osama them
It's a couple celebrity chicks, yeah, I'm with them
