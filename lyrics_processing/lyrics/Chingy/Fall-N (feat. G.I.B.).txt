To all my hustler niggas
Fall in (fall in)
To all you bitch ass niggas, we gon' do it again
I got kin, I got friends
Thinkin' the river don't stop with the mens (pussy niggas)

Retaliation is a must
I'm keepin' it gutta, brah
Anybody talkin' shit, yeah, I'm runnin' up on ya
Banga, keep it by my side
Hundred stacks don't fold right
'Cause I got them streets tied, pimpin' like I'm rollin' right
Yeah, ya walkin' on a corner, better get my money right
'Cause I know your feet hurt
How you gon' stay by my side?
If you ain't' gettin' it, I'm 'bout to roll it right
Like a dodi blunt, we keep throwin up fours

Doin' it like Donald Trump
I'm sendin' this one to the women with body
And all my hustlas with the grill fronts
Just got a check, but it ain't gonna last for four months
Bought a chain, that's some Cardi upgrade
Don't stunt, get with my beats and my rolled blunts
Leave with your cunt
Heads up, musta broke one
Yeah, it's official now (it's official now)
Blow your whistle now (blow your whistle now)
I got a rifle that'll tell 'em blow your whistle now
When I'm chillin' (when I'm chillin')
How I'm feelin' (how I'm feelin')
Really good, watchin' flat screens on the ceilin' (on the ceilin')
Big wheelin' (big wheelin')
Quarter million (quarter million)
Three hunderd C plus time spillin'

To all my hustler niggas
Fall in (fall in)

But it depends on how I feel
And you how been in the past
Either you're fake or you're real
I don't deal with hoe niggas
'Cause hoe niggas they infiltrate
Like they're bigger than they really are
Ridin' in my fast car like Tracy Chapman
I'm simply rappin'
Givin' the world pure satisfaction
If action is what you like to do
Then play your role
'Cause I'm tired of niggas comin' in my life playin' them hoes

To all my hustler niggas
Fall in (fall in)
To all you bitch ass niggas, we gon' do it again
I got kin, I got friends
Thinkin' the river don't stop with the mens (pussy niggas)
To all my hustler niggas

I got kin, I got friends
