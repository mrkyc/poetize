Cheerleaders on the sideline in they Chingy shirts
My dribble is wicked as I drive down the lane
To the hoop, I take it, shake 'n bake it, it ain't no thang

When I'm on the line I'm good with free throws
I came up shooting hoops in the hood in cheap clothes
 where I practice my shot
Remember NBA Jam
They're dirty I'm hot
Finger point at you
Point a finger ball spinnin'
You don't gotta ask who
Because you know we winnin'
Just check my stats
My rating, 98
Come whoopin' with your team
We gonna put cha in your place
You know I got hops
Watch me dunk it in your grill
Ask anybody about me
They gonna say he got skills
When I'm on the field
It's all respect
Half court shots, swish
Look nothing but net so
