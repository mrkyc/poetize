I pull up on the lot
Then I fell up in the spot
Saint Louis hat cocked
Tryna find somethin hot
Drink in my hand
Hundreds in my pocket
I dont curr if he ur man
Understand I'm ur profit
Its 2:39, we should leave by 3
We can stroll around and go get something to eat
Outside I got a flat drop
You hungry?
Round your girls up and we can all go to i-Hop
You prolly think I'm tryna cut
And maybe you're right
You dont like one night stands?
Well, baby tonight

You acting like you don't hurr me (pss pss)
Come nurr me
Quit faking it, take a puff of this green from Jamaica
Just bought a new yacht with 4 rooms and a bar
No you're not that used to being around a hood star
My papa told me good girls always go bad
So if I touch her right thurr ain't no need to get mad
I could take you from the club to paradise
Used to my chicks, I like them thick
Plus naughty and nice
The way you sweep me off my feet, you should be a broom
The way you smell, shoulda had ur own perfume
So knock knock (who's thurr?) Jackpot (that's hot)
Ran with the old head so fuck the sex
Do it tickle when I lick your neck?
Better get you wet
Lookin at your sexy ass make me wanna write a check

You know you claim of bein' on top an goin down
So show a little somethin'
Whisper in my ear and let me know a little somethin
You working that body
Well throw a little something over here where I'm at
Girl I got too much pride to be chasing the cat
But I like how that lingerie fit
Shit, I got enough game to hit Queen Elizabeth
My blood blue so you know I'm royalty
I'm through with catering to y'all girls, spoil me (you dig?)
