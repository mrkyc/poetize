That photo that you posted on the dock
Down at Ridgevale beach, it was meant for me
Couldn't double tap and give you that heart
We've been down that road, both know where it goes and

If I do, you're sendin' me flights and
Callin' in the middle of the night
You know you're still on my mind
So don't you think it's time

That we leave us in a last call, last shot, salt air
Sippin' Reposado and lime
Leave us in a last kiss, last light, beach chair
Temptin' forever all night
But when the tide rolled out and the sun came up
We both knew it was settin' on us
As hard as it seems, that's how it's gotta be
You gotta leave, leave us in a memory

(Last call, last shot, sippin' Reposado and lime)
(Last kiss, last light, temptin' forever all night)
You might also like
Every time I close a beachcomber tab
Racin' down to the dunes, I'm thinkin' about you
And how the sun was comin' up too fast
Wanna call you up, get back what was us and

If I do, you'll be sendin' me flights
Callin' in the middle of the night
And you know you're still on my mind
So don't you think it's time

That we leave us in a last call, last shot, salt air
Sippin' Reposado and lime
Leave us in a last kiss, last light, beach chair
Temptin' forever all night
But when the tide rolled out and the sun came up
We both knew it was settin' on us
As hard as it seems, that's how it's gotta be
You gotta leave, leave us in a memory

(Last call, last shot, sippin' Reposado and lime)
You gotta leave, leave us in a memory
(Last kiss, last light, temptin' forever all night)
Leave us in a moonlight high tide
Before we said goodbye
Sometimes I wanna rewind that night
But it wouldn't be right, oh

That we leave us in a last call, last shot, salt air
Sippin' Reposado and lime
Leave us in a last kiss, last light, beach chair
Temptin' forever all night
But when the tide rolled out and the sun came up
We both knew it was settin' on us
As hard as it seems, that's how it's gotta be
You gotta leave, leave us in a memory

(Last call, last shot, sippin' Reposado and lime)
Leave us in a memory
Leave us in a memory
(Last kiss, last light, temptin' forever all night)
Leave us in a memory
