You're the type of, you're the type of girl that
You're the type of, you're the type of girl that

Moving on and getting over takes a
Takes a little bit of time
And being lonely for the summer ain't what
Ain't what I really had in mind
Almost sent a text that I'd regret in the morning light
Thank God my friends called me again to drag me out tonight

Or I wouldn't be here buying you a drink
Slow dancing away into a memory
Until it's last call, gotta go home
Both know we ain't going alone
Looks like I'm forgetting
All the second guessing and regret
When falling for someone new in a minute
If it weren't for a heartbreak, never would've met you
You're the type of girl that takes a breakup to get to

(You're the type of, you're the type of girl that)

Two shots of tequila with you
Girl, where you've been all along?
Was like a scene from a movie
When you walked in and I was gone
She put a hole in my heart never fixed it
And I'm so glad that she didn't

'Cause I wouldn't be here buying you a drink
Slow dancing away into a memory
Until it's last call, gotta go home
Both know we ain't going alone
Looks like I'm forgetting
All the second guessing and regret
When falling for someone new in a minute
If it weren't for a heartbreak, never would've met you
You're the type of girl that takes a breakup to get to, yeah

(You're the type of, you're the type of girl that)
That takes a breakup to get to yeah
You're the type of girl that (You're the type of, you're the type of girl that)

She put a hole in my heart never fixed it
And I'm so glad that she didn't
'Cause I wouldn't be here buying you a drink
Slow dancing away into a memory
Until it's last call, gotta go home
Both know we ain't going alone
Looks like I'm forgetting
All the second guessing and regret
When falling for someone
If it weren't for a heartbreak, never would've met you
You're the type of girl that takes a breakup to get to

(You're the type of, you're the type of girl that)
Takes a breakup to get to, yeah
(You're the type of, you're the type of girl)
