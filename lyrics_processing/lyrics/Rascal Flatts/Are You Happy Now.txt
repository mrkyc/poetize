Someone let your secret out
Everybody 'round here's talking about, how your knight in shining armor let you down
And now you're alone, I told you so
This is what you wanted, baby, now you got it
Something's wrong and you can't put your finger on it
Could it be that maybe, you did that to me, baby
And now you found

What goes around comes back around
It's been that way forever
Baby, just look at you now, barely holding it together
We were so in love, but you gave that up
Just look around, are you happy now?
Oooh, are you happy now?

Yeah, you're gonna  spend some sleepless nights
Crying in the glow of the TV light
With some sad song on and a glass of wine
Just to sit in the pain, baby, what a shame
This is what you wanted, baby now you got it
Something's wrong and you can't put your finger on it
Could it be that maybe, you did that to me, baby
And now you found
You might also like
What goes around comes back around
It's been that way forever
Baby, just look at you now, barely holding it together
We were so in love, but you gave that up
Just look around
Are you happy now?

Now that I'm not around (now that I'm not around)
Now that you've finally lost what you thought that you needed
Never would have treated your heart like you did

What goes around comes back around
It's been that way forever
Baby, just look at you now, barely holding it together
Oh, we were so in love, oh, but you gave that up
Just look around
Just look around

What goes around comes back around
It's been that way forever
We were so in love (we were so in love)
But you gave that up (but you gave it up)
Just look around
Just look around
Are you happy now?
Are you happy now?
Are you happy?
