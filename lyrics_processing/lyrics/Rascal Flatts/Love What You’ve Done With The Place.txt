Your t-shirt hanging on my chair by the mirror
Where you like to do your hair
I find it everywhere
It's on the bed, it's on my floor
It's like you leave your mark so everybody knows I'm yours
And I don't mind at all
No, I don't

When you gotta go
Don't you leave me all alone
Leave your perfume on my pillow and your picture on my phone
Leave the towel on the shower and that empty shampoo bottle
That make-up on the counter
You can take, but you ain't gotta
Just don't leave me without leaving a trace
Cause I love what you've done
Yeah, I love what you've done with the place

That smile sure brightens up the room
And those eyes go perfect with the view
All the stars outside the window getting closer just to see
This little piece of heaven leaving lipstick on my cheek
And I don't mind
You might also like
When you gotta go
Don't you leave me all alone
Leave your perfume on my pillow and your picture on my phone
Leave the towel on the shower and that empty shampoo bottle
That make-up on the counter
You can take but you ain't gotta
Just don't leave me without leaving a trace
'Cause I love what you've done, yeah I love what you've done with the place
I love, I love, I love, I love

Hang around
You like to sleep
Your Sunday morning on my couch
Like everything about you
I can't stop thinking about
And I don't mind at all

So, when you gotta go
Don't you leave me all alone
Leave your perfume on my pillow and your picture on my phone
Leave the towel on the shower and that empty shampoo bottle
That make-up on the counter
You can take but you ain't gotta
Just don't leave me without leaving a trace
'Cause I love what you've done
Yeah, I love what you've done with the place
I love, I love, I love, I love
What you've done, baby
What you've done with the place
You know I do, baby
