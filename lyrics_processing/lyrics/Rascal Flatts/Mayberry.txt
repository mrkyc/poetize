Sometimes it feels like this world's spinning faster
Than it did in the old days
So naturally, we have more natural disasters
From the strain of a fast pace
Sunday was a day of rest
Now, it's one more day for progress
And we can't slow down (and we can't slow down) 'cause more is less ('cause more is less)
It's all an endless process

I miss Mayberry
Sittin' on the porch, drinkin' ice-cold cherry coke
Where everything is black and white
(Na-na, na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na)
Pickin' on the six string
People pass by and you call them by their first name
Watchin' the clouds roll by
Bye, bye (Bye, bye)
You might also like
Sometimes I can hear this old earth shoutin'
Through the trees, as the wind blows
That's when I climb up here on this mountain
To look through God's window
Now I can't fly, but I got two feet
To get me high up here
Above the noise and city streets
My worries disappear

I miss Mayberry
Sittin' on the porch, drinkin' ice-cold cherry coke
Where everything is black and white
(Na-na, na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na)
Pickin' on the six string
People pass by and you call them by their first name
Watchin' the clouds roll by
Bye, bye (Bye)

Sometimes I dream I'm drivin' down an old dirt road (Down an old dirt road)
Not even listed on a map (Ooh, yeah)
I pass a dad and son carrying a fishing pole
But I always wake up every time I try to turn back
I miss Mayberry
Sittin' on the porch, drinkin' ice-cold cherry coke
Where everything is black and white
(Na-na, na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na)
Pickin' on the six string
Where people pass by and you call them by their first name
Watchin' the clouds roll by
Bye, bye (Bye)
Bye, bye (Bye)
