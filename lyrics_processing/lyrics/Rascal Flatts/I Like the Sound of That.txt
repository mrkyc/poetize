I love hearing that shower turn on
Bet there's nothing but a towel on on you
You sing along with some Timberlake bumping
But he ain't got nothing on you
I don't wanna hear the coffee pouring
A goodbye kiss, then locking the door, yeah
Sounds like leaving you, oh

It's a little too loud on the highway
I wanna pull back in your driveway
It's way too quiet at my place
Wanna come on over, come on over
I just wanna hear that ringtone
I like it turned up when you're blowing up my phone
Wanna hear you say come on over
'Cause when you tell me to come on over
I like the sound of that

Oh-oh-oh
I like the sound, I like the sound of that
Oh-oh-oh
I like the sound, I like the sound of that
You might also like
Love the sound of the thunder rolling
It makes you move a little closer to me
Girl, I bet that your neighbors hate us
'Cause we could laugh all night and never sleep
We can worry 'bout the world in the morning
Light up a candle, lock the door
Wanna stay right here with you, yes I do

It's a little too loud on the highway
I wanna pull back in your driveway
It's way too quiet at my place
Wanna come on over, come on over
I just wanna hear that ringtone
I like it turned up when you're blowing up my phone
Wanna hear you say come on over
'Cause when you tell me to come on over
I like the sound of that

Oh-oh-oh
I like the sound, I like the sound of that
Oh-oh-oh
I like the sound, I like the sound of that
Turn your radio on, baby, turn down the lights
I ain't going nowhere, I'm all yours tonight

It's a little too loud on the highway
I wanna pull back in your driveway
It's way too quiet at my place
Wanna come on over, come on over
I just wanna hear that ringtone
I like it turned up when you're blowing up my phone
Wanna hear you say come on over
'Cause when you tell me to come on over
I like the sound of that

Oh-oh-oh
I like the sound and I love the sound of that
Oh-oh-oh
I like the sound, I like the sound of that
Oh-oh-oh
I like the sound, I like the sound of that
Oh-oh-oh (Yes, I do)
