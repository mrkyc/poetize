I don't wanna spend another lonely night
Ooh
I've got the lights turned up
The door is locked
The bedroom TV's on
Doin' the only thing that gets me through the night
Since you've been gone
Prayin' for daylight, waiting for that morning sun
So I can act like my whole life ain't goin' wrong
Baby, come back to me, I swear I'll make it right
Don't make me spend another lonely night
Prayin' for daylight (Prayin' for daylight)
I made a bad miscalculation
Bettin' you would never leave
'Cause if you're gettin' on with your new life
Then where does that leave me?
Prayin' for daylight, waiting for that morning sun
So I can act like my whole life ain't goin' wrong
Baby, come back to me, I swear I'll make it right
Don't make me spend another lonely night
Prayin' for daylight (Prayin' for daylight)
Prayin' for daylight (Prayin' for daylight)
Prayin' for daylight
You might also like
Hoping that I didn't wait too long (I didn't wait too long)
That this is just the dark before the dawn
Deep in my heart, I know that you love me as much as I love you
(You know I love you, girl)
And that you must be lyin' somewhere, looking up to heaven too

Prayin' for daylight, waiting for that morning sun
So I can act like my whole life ain't goin' wrong
Baby, come back to me, I swear I'll make it right
Don't make me spend another lonely night
(Make me spend another lonely night)
Prayin' for daylight, waiting for that morning sun
So I can act like my whole life ain't goin' wrong
Baby, come back to me, I swear I'll make it right
Don't make me spend another lonely night
(Don't make me spend another lonely night)
Prayin' for daylight (Prayin' for daylight)
Prayin' for daylight

I don't wanna spend another lonely night
I don't wanna spend another lonely night (Prayin' for daylight)
Prayin' for daylight
I don't wanna spend another lonely night
Ooh
