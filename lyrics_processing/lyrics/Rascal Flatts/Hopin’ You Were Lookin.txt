Woah, woah
Woah, woah

Sittin' here stuck in traffic, five o'clock madness
Shoulda took the long way home
Like some Copperfield magic, showed up like a rabbit
Stopped like a runway show
Dark sunglasses
Gonna pull right over
Gotta take my chances
I was hopin' you were lookin' at me, woo

Hey girl, tell me
What you doin' later tonight?
Call me crazy
But I was thinkin' maybe we might
I'll take you downtown, table for two
I keep it laid back, just me and you right now
I'm trippin' over my feet
'Cause the way that you were lookin'
I was hopin' you were lookin' at me
Woah, woah
Woah, woah
You might also like
Takin' off your sunglasses, if you don't mind me askin'
What's your name and where you from?
I know we're movin' kinda fast, but I kinda gotta have it
Put your number in my phone
We can be so classic
June and Johnny Cash it
Now I got you laughin'
So tell me, were you lookin' at me?

Hey girl, tell me

But I was thinkin' maybe we might
Take you downtown, table for two

Baby, hey, what you doin' later tonight?
