Hey baby, is that you?
Wow, your hair got so long
Yeah, yeah, I love it, I really do
"Norma Jean", ain't that the song we'd sing in the car?
Driving downtown, top down, making the rounds
Checking out the bands on Doheeney Avenue
Yeah, life throws you curves
But you learned to swerve
Me, I swung and I missed and the next thing ya know
I'm reminiscing
Dreaming old dreams, wishing old wishes
Like you would be back again

I wake up in teardrops that fall down like rain
I put on that old song we danced to and then
I head off to my job
Guess not much has changed
Punch the clock, head for home
Check the phone, just in case
Go to bed, dream of you
That's what I'm doing these days
Yeah, that's what I'm doing

Someone told me after college, you ran off to Vegas
You married a rodeo cowboy
Wow, that ain't the girl I knew
Me, I've been a few places
Mostly here and there, once or twice
Still sortin' out life, but I'm doing alright
Yeah, it's good to see you too
Well, hey girl, you're late
And those planes, they don't wait
But if you ever come back around this sleepy old town
Promise me you'll stop in to see an old friend
And until then...

I wake up in teardrops that fall down like rain
I put on that old song we danced to and then
I head off to my job
Guess not much has changed
Punch the clock, head for home
Check the phone, just in case
Go to bed, dream of you
That's what I'm doing these days
These days

Baby

I wake up in teardrops that fall down like rain
I put on that old song we danced to and then
I head off to my job
Guess not much has changed
Punch the clock, head for home
Check the phone, just in case
Go to bed, dream of you
That's what I'm doing these...
I wake up in teardrops that fall down like rain
I put on that old song we danced to and then
I wake up in teardrops that fall down like rain
I put on that old song we danced to and then
I wake up in teardrops that fall down like rain
