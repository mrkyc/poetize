She got that "hey y'all" little southern drawl that she got from her mama
Likes coffee with her sugar in the morning
She likes to leave little red lipstick love notes on the mirror
Loves the rain on a tin roof when it's pouring

Doesn't matter what we're listening to
Spinning her around the living room
And I fall apart every time

She puts that beat in my chest
Pounds like a drum, shakes me like thunder
Taking my hand, pulling me up when I'm going under
My dreams come alive when I wake up and look in her eyes
She brings me back to life
Yes, she does

She's got her feet on the dash
Hair blowing back, hand out the window
Making up half the words that she's singing
And she takes an hour to pick a  movie out
Five minutes in and she's passing out
And I wouldn't dare wake her up when she's sleeping
You might also like
I'd stay there forever if I could
Doing nothing never felt so good
And I wish that I could stop time

She puts that beat in my chest
Pounds like a drum, shakes me like thunder
Taking my hand, pulling me up when I'm going under
My dreams come alive when I wake up and look in her eyes
She brings me back to life
Oh, yes she does
And I don't wanna think about where I would be without her, oh
She puts that beat in my chest
Pounds like a drum, shakes me like thunder
Taking my hand, pulling me up when I'm going under
My dreams come alive when I wake up and look in her eyes, whoa
Yeah, my dreams come alive when I wake up and look in her eyes
She brings me back to life

Oh, she does
