Life is like a road that you travel on
When there is one day here and the next day gone
Sometimes you bend, sometimes you stand
Sometimes you turn your back to the wind
There is a world outside every darkened door
Where blues will not haunt you anymore
Where brave are free and lovers soar
Come ride with me to the distant shore
We won't hesitate
To break down the garden gate
There's not much time left today

Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long
If you are going my way
I want to drive it all night long

Through all these cities and all these towns
It is in my blood and it is all around
I love you now like I loved you then
This is the road and these are the hands
From Mozambique to those Memphis nights
The Khyber Pass to Vancouver's lights
You might also likeKnock me down get back up again
You are in my blood
I am not a lonely man
There is no load I cannot hold
Road so rough this I know
I will be there when the light comes in
Just tell them we are survivors

Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long
If you are going my way
I want to drive it all night long
Give me give me give me give me yeah

Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long
If you are going my way
I want to drive it all night long
Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long
If you are going my way
I want to drive it all night long
Let's go!
There ain't no load that I cannot hold
Road so rough this I know
I will be there when the light comes in
Just tell them we are survivors

Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long
If you are going my way
I want to drive it all night long
Life is a highway
If you are going my way

Yeah I want to drive it all night long
If you're going my way
