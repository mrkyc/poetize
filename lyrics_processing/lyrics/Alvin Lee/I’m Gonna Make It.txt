With my guitar in my hand
All the doors will open wide
With my baby by my side
And as far as I can see
I guess the world belongs to me
But the world is made of dust
And my guitar starts to rust
And the entropy goes on
But you say it won't last long
So I'm lying at your feet
Seems you never miss a beat
So I play my guitar
That's my guiding star
Through the cosmos I will blast
Through the universe so vast
So as far as I can see
Until I reach infinity
I'm gonna make it
I'm gonna make it
I'm gonna make it
I'm gonna make it
Gonna make it
Gonna take it
Gonna shake it
Anytime with you
You might also likeI wasn't born to be too mild
I was a revolution child
I played the game for all to see
They couldn't stop me feeling free
It never hurts to take a chance
I'll play the music you just dance
I'm gonna make it I'm gonna make it
I'm gonna make it I'm gonna make it
If you fake it don't you shake it
Gonna make it anytime with me
I'm gonna make it I'm gonna make it
I'm gonna make it I'm gonna make it
I'm gonna make it with you (yeah)
Well if you don't believe me then you'd better be aware
I don't want to love someone who doesn't really care
If you take it you can make it to the end of the line
And that us when I'll know that you are mine all mine
And if you want to help me you can carry my load
If you make it you can take it to the end of the road
I'm gonna make it I'm gonna make it
I'm gonna make it I'm gonna make it
Gonna make it gonna take it
