Trying to make a buck, and never let it go
I'll never find that game, to satisfy my soul
I just wanna play that good old rock and roll
Don't worry about the future, never mind the news
I just want my freedom, so I can play the blues
I'm minding my own business, ain't nobody's business but my own
Wake up in the morning, pick up my guitar
Never read a paper, doesn't get me very far
Never mind the future, just livin' for today
Whatever's gonna happen, gonna happen anyway
Don't worry about your life, it will get you in a state
You're gonna be dead my friend, and then it is too late
So I'm takin' care of business, Ain't nobody's business but my own
Don't want a Ferrari, as long as I've got wheels
Don't need those kind of trappin's Lord, you know that stuff ain't real
You know none of those goods can do no good for you when you go
I only need my freedom, to satisfy my soul
Don't worry about those stocks and shares
The money you make in pounds
The money you got to lose boy, will only bring you down
I'm mindin' my own business, Ain't nobody's business but my own
So many people, they're running to and fro
Tryin' to make a buck, and never let it go
I'll never find that game, to satisfy my soul
I just wanna play that good old rock and roll
Don't worry about the future, never mind the news
I just want my freedom, so I can sing the blues
I'm mindin' my own business, Ain't nobody's business but my own
Ain't nobody's business but my own
Ain't nobody's business but my own
