I can see it in her letters on the paper with her pen
Her response is getting stranger, think she's coming 'round again
So tell me, Mrs. Rita, what's it say in my tarot?
Read my palm and tell me, why do lovers come and go?

Is she coming 'round for me once again?
Around or was that just the end?
I just hope she's coming 'round again

I've been keeping myself busy with my books and with my tapes
And every day's much better since I've slowed my drinking pace
There's no swimming in the bottle, it's just someplace we all drown
And I lost myself in sorrow, I've lost my confidence in doubt

Is she coming 'round for me once again?
Around or was that just the end?
I just hope she's coming 'round again

Get in the car and drive through town
Down the block and back around
Pretending that she's there with me
We drive
Gone forever

My patience keeps me plaintive, my high hopes keep me alone
My lover's will is shaken, I wish she would just come home
So tell me, Mrs. Rita, what's it say in my tarot?
Read my palm and tell me, why do lovers come and go?

Is she coming 'round for me once again?
Around or was that the end?
I just hope she's coming 'round again
Is she coming 'round for me once again?
Around or was that the end?
I just hope she's coming 'round again

I just hope she's coming 'round
I just hope she's coming 'round
I just hope she's coming 'round
I just hope she's coming 'round
I just hope she's coming 'round
I just hope she's coming 'round
I just hope she's coming 'round
