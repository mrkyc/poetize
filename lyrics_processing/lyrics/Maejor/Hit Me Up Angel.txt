And big rims on my truck feel so great
Some people come and say what up, they so fake
Soon as i get by ready know they gon hate
But its really all good cuz they girl dont
My songs make them feel good when the world don't
I won't stop til im popping on the world tour

Yo what up guess im blowing up what can I say
Its the same Bei Maejor from back in the day
Only difference is my car in immaculate shape
And I got it til my rims quit acting my age
When it comes to doing this i'm the jack of the trades
Make beats write songs get stacks for a phrase
Got a pretty young thing back in L.A
Can't wait to touch down lay back and get laid
I'm representing bean town where them niggas don't play
Ride love in the west got a crib in the A
Can't forget the East Coast and they fast pace ways
All my people oversees or whereever you stay
Angel you should get to know me she like how
Real simple baby girl take this down
Three one three two four two triple seven five
One to be my angel it me up right now
