And everybody runnin' but we goin' different places
And everybody cryin' they just fall on different faces
And life is a struggle everybody won't make it
See I was on the plane with a bunch of white people watching world cup soccer, man them niggas going crazy, but if there had been some black people watching basketball then we'd be ghetto the motherfuckers racist
It seems the prettiest girls the ones that get the facelifts, they damn doctors bills take they whole life savings
I wonder why do we always wanna trade places with someone who would trade with us because they couldn't take it
And women post pictures on they page ass naked, and we admire that, niggas treat em like they famous, and let another woman come along and try to save em, they twist they faces up and they acknowledge that as hatin
And times the hardest thing to get back once you waste it
And face it this life is really only what you make it
They sayin Bei slow down youngin', you gotta pace it
But you can't concern yourself with standards when your chasin greatness
I know .. Facelifts and Waterfalls ..
Yeah .. Facelifts and Waterfalls .. Uuh .. Yeah .. Pray dah
Maejor ..
I think its time to let the water fall, make it rain everyday cuz I order ball
New play call it auto ball, its too much bangin get off each others balls
Sippin champagne way up in first class
What nigga's make their whole year I did the first half of January and it was cold outside
Niggas doubted me but can you heard me told em right?
I don't walk I just fly
I went from once a blue moon to once a blue sky
And old school women love me like dah new guy
Got my hat to the side and my eyes on the prize
And you can not hold me down its like tryna hold water
My generation goin dumb im tryna grow smarter
. Mad dah my girl tell her bro friends what I bought her
But her skin so soft man I think she Carol's daughter
Garden of Eden beauty when shes naked
And this life here is only what you make it
So im'a make sure tonight we do it all
Close your eyes
