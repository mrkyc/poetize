You Call Me At Work, So I Know You Got A Something To Say
Well Hurry Up, I Only Got A Few Minutes Left On My Lunch Break
You Take A Deep Breath, Then Say Baby I Don't Know If You're Ready
I Said Your My Girl, So We Both Know You Better Tell Me
She Said We've Been Together For So Long
I'm Thinking In My Head, What Has This Women Done Wrong
Then The Phone, It went Quiet. I Screamed Out Come On
She Said, We're Going To Be A Little Family
Congratulations Babe You're' Going To Be A Daddy
Chorus
Do You Mean What Think You Mean ?
She Said Yeah, Were Having A Baby ( Yes )
And I Couldn't' Be More Excited
I Said Do You Know What This Means To Me, To Hear You Say That You're' Having My Baby
( Yeah ) And I Wouldn't' Wanna Share This Joy With Anyone But You

Oooh This Is Such A Blessing, A Little Piece Of Love From The Heavens
I Pray The Doctor Says That All Is Good And I Swear We Going Move Out This Hood Girl
Tell Your People That I Got Us And That's A Promise
