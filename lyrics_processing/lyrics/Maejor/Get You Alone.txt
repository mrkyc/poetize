Sex on my mind thinkin' 'bout when I get you alone (When I get you alone)
You already know it's goin' down when I get you alone (Get you alone)
'Cause you know what I came here to do when I get you alone (When I get you alone)
I'ma give it all to you when I get you, when I get you alone

You know it, you know you in trouble, when I get you alone (-lone)
Thinking 'bout the places I touch you, when I get you alone (-lone)
And we can turn the cellphones off, baby (Baby), when I get you alone (-lone)
'Cause everything you need is right here (Right here), right here, right here, baby

'Cause I'm tryna see what's up with tonight
And I love the way your body looks up underneath these lights
So don't say it's wrong, when it feels right
'Cause I'm looking at your apple and I wanna take a bite

'Cause you know what I came here to do when I get you alone (When I get you alone)
I'ma give it all to you when I get you, when I get you alone

Tonight I need some entertainment, when I get you alone (-lone)
Take all them clothes off, let's get naked, when I get you alone (-lone)
Baby, let me kiss you somewhere sacred, when I get you alone (-lone)
'Cause I got what you need and it's right here (And it's right here), right here, right here, baby
You might also like

Ahh-ahh-ahh-ah, aah
When I get you alone
Ooh, hm

Say the hottest topic ain't about your body, babe, that's the truth (Truth)
Pull up in a Rover and all these people tellin' me, that's the crew (Crew)
If I had you to myself then God damn, baby, that's a coup
Know you need some peace of mind, them legs up to the ceiling that's the deuce (Of peace)
Any time of day you got me, gotta keep it straight up, no juice
I got a cabbana up in Cancun
We can fuck from R. Kelly to Lil Boosie (Yeah)
With yo' bad ass
I'm a fat kid for that fat ass
Cake
Love it how you make a nigga wait
Girl, your body got me far from sober
Whenever we get alone, it's over
Yeah, it's over
Only if, if I get you alone
Promise it be alright, when I get you alone
Yeah, I know you keep plans and I know you got friends
For once can we get this alone
