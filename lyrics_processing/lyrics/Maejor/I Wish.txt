Why don't you call no more, I miss you
Thought you were the one for me
The only girl I adore
Now you belong to someone else

Yeah, uh
Used to be my girlfriend, why'd I let you go?
I kept a lot of things inside that you'll never know
See I was stupid and my pride wouldn't let it show
So I just went around pretending I was extra cold
The truth is that I really need a sweater though
I'm useless, girl without you, we were special yo
And do I think about the past, well yes and no
You see it hurts to know we'll never get a second go
So, as I'm sittin' on the bed wishing you were here
I close my eyes and in the vision I see you appear
If pretty girls was in the sky, then you in a Lear
And then I'm sick when I wake up, because you wasn't there
Uh, I know I made some few mistakes
But a promise is a promise and a promise I will make
That you'd never spend a day feelin' love was far away
But you sayin' it's too late
And right now I wish I'd never let you go
You might also like
Never let you go
You should know, I want you to come home
But you ain't got love for me
Nah baby
Now you belong to someone else

Uh, I hate the fact that I can't even hit you up no mo'
I hate that I'm the one who messed up what we had befo'
I hate tryna hide everytime I see you out
I'm sure the words I told you so come out your mama's mouth
I hate the fact another nigga got my damn wife
If I could trade it all for you, I would do it twice
I'd give it all up twice to see your smile once
I'd cut my life in half to walk down that isle once, with you, huh
Yeah yeah, the things that we would do
I'm wishing I could rearrange time and start new
It's time to write a sequel, we need a part two
But you say in part one, I ain't play my part, true
Damn, that's where I went wrong
But don't let a few bad notes end a great song
And don't let a few hold-ups end a whole dawn
I'ma keep holdin' on 'til my life gone
I wish I'd never let you go
Never let you go
You should know, I want you to come home
But you ain't got love for me
Nah baby, (Nah baby)
Now you belong to someone else

And right now I wish I'd never let you go
(Never let you go)
I think that it's important you know
How much, how much I want you at home
But you ain't got no love for me
(No love, No love, No love)
Yeah I guess I gotta face the facts
(Now you belong to someone else)
