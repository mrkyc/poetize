(Yeah)

Oh, when you say you need some space
I feel a way cause, baby, I can't even lie
I need you right here by my side
And you don't want me in your life
I swear I'm so done playing games
I didn't think that this would cause us so much pain
I know, I know I make mistakes
But, baby, don't do me this way (nah, look)

Tell me that you love me again
Don't leave me alone
Tell me that you love me again
How could you just move on
Tell me that you love me again
Please don't break my heart
Tell me that you love me again, again
I miss you, baby

Right here by my side
You give me what I like
So give me one more chance
Oh, baby, take me by the hand
And love me like nobody can
Cause I have lost too many times
To watch you float away like a white butterfly
To watch you sink into the sky
As I sit in my car and cry
You might also like
Tell me that you love me again
Don't leave me alone
Tell me that you love me again
How could you just move on
Tell me that you love me again
Please don't break my heart
Tell me that you love me again, again
I miss you, baby

Can't you see that I care so much
I'm just here to get her
We both are
See, I never planned on falling
I don't wanna lose you, I'm sorry
Never my intention to play games
Never was supposed to feel that way
I don't wanna lose you, I'm sorry
How would you feel if you was me
Doing me wrong truthfully (what's it gonna take for you to see)

Tell me that you love me again
Don't leave me alone
Tell me that you love me again
How could you just move on
Tell me that you love me again
Please don't break my heart
Tell me that you love me again, again
I miss you, baby
(Tell me that you love me again
