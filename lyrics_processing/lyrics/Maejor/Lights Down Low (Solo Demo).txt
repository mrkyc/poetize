I know what she want

Lil' mama want her hair pulled
Legs pushed back
Only like a Rottweiler in the kitty cat
She want it wild
Shawty wanna scream
Want it from the front, back, side, and in between
Want it all the time, she a fiend
So good, I see it in my dreams
She wanna arch her back when I hit it
When I do it mama wanna holla get it
She said

Take it slow, put it down on me
I said jump on it, ride like a pony
Lights down low, time to get naughty
Lights down low, time to, time to get naughty
Take it slow, put it down on me
Baby, jump on it, ride like a pony
Lights down low, time to get naughty
Lights down low, lights down low

Lil' mama, hol' up where they do that at?
Wanted more than one round, that's a fact
Ding ding, body shots from the back
Shawty wanna do an all night match
Ready to rumble, baby
She wanna get a kiss
She ain't talking bout her lips
Lil mama want somebody to take control-ol
She say I'm out cold

Take it slow, put it down on me
I said jump on it, ride like a pony
Lights down low, time to get naughty
