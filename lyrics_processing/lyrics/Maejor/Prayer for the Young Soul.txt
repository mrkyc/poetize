Sister Bessie don't you say no prayer for me
A slow boats gonna lead me where I'm bound
I'm for to travel far across the distant seas
My destiny will lead me where I'm bound

Uh, feel like nobody ever pray for her
No body did, nobody ever made a way for her
And in the future she just couldn't see no change for her
She felt her own best friend was a skateboard
That's what she gave for
Uh, young soul living in her own world
Could be you sister, Mother, daughter, home girl
She hate her Pops cause he cheated on her old girl
Now she get high to ease the pain call it done girl
I know it seem like life's too hard
But just remember young soul, you done made it this far
And I'mma tell you little something OG's would day
Everyday ain't good, but something good in everyday
So go girl, I'm praying for you
Remember this deep inside somebody love you
If you're going through hell, run don't be scared
Might make it out before the devil know you was there
Somebody pray for her
You might also like
Sister Bessie don't you say no prayer for me
A slow boats gonna lead me where I'm bound
I'm for to travel far across the distant seas
My destiny will lead me where I'm bound

Felt like nobody ever pray for him
Nobody there, nobody ever made a way for him
See Lil Tommy, he ain't lil no more, just turned 34
Still sleeping on the mattress on his Grandma's floor
Can't keep a steady girlfriend let alone a job
His Honda window broke from the time he got robbed, broke
Ironic it seems, he was such a young soul
He had such big dreams
Now he sits in the basement, playing his guitar
Cause his ex girlfriend said he ain't no star
Can't wait to see her face when his career go far
And his song is on every time she get in the car, yes
Those type of dreams keep him going
Those type of dreams keep him writing, keep him flowing
Society says hes a waste, what a loser
But he don't really care, all he needs is his music
So Tommy pops in a USD
He wanna feel like a G he just listen to me
Wanna feel like a pimp he just listen to C
And when he wanna feel street he just listen to Meek, yeah
Go homie, somebody praying for you
Remember this deep inside somebody love you
If you're going through hell, run don't be scared
Might make it out before the devil know you was there
Somebody pray for him
Sister Bessie don't you say no prayer for me
A slow boats gonna lead me where I'm bound
I'm for to travel far across the distant seas
