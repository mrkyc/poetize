Count on me when you?re all alone
Yeah ill be there when you need somebody to talk to I?m here
You can count on me you know I?m always there
Yeah yeah yeah (I?m here)
See you know it may sound crazy but I swear it?s all true
Every word of every love song reminds me of you
And I know I know I know I know you feel the same way too
Cuz you stick around and put up with the stupid things I do
But I?m sorry you know that you can always always count on me, do you feel me? (good)
Because I love ya, girl I can't see myself with nobody but ya
Always know that you can

Switching lanes and hitting corners in my 745
Tryin to make my way to you no where else I wanna drive
Feel so lucky I?m so lucky that I found that special one
The first time I seen you smile was the day my life begun
Cuz I love ya, love ya so much I would scream it out in public, can you hear me? (good)
Cuz I need ya, some people doubt our love but Ill make them believers
And as always you can
