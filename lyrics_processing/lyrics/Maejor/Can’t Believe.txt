I can't believe, I can't believe, I can't believe, I can't believe
What happened last night, I'm barely sober
I think I need, I think I need, I think I need, I think I need
To come back down, the party's over
There were two drunk girls in the bathroom
My boys dad came home, he was mad cool
Had the time of my life, it all felt right
Can't believe that we going do the same thing tonight
(verse 1)
Weather man called for sunshine
I woke up drunk with my girl on my mind
I only think about her sometimes
I wish that dad would call me son at least one time
Whatever
I take a sip of this dom pizzy and gets busy
I hope this pizza from last night can get me right
I hope my cell phones charged, ah shit its not
I guess i'll wear the same thing, shit, its all I got
(bridge)
Wasted, faded, really shit face-ted
Yeah this is my life and I wouldn't want to change it
We go all out, party till we fall out
If you do the same thing, holla (oh yeah)
You might also like(chorus)
I can't believe, I can't believe, I can't believe, I can't believe
What happened last night, I'm barely sober
I think I need, I think I need, I think I need, I think I need
To come back down, the party's over
There were two drunk girls in the bathroom
My boys dad came home, he was mad cool
Had the time of my life, it all felt right
Can't believe that we going do the same thing tonight
(verse 2)
Smashin on rum like its iced tea
Hatin' niggas mad cause they girl like me
Im just trying to live my life
Straight rage is the kind of shit we like
We had the house party hotter than a griddle
Neighbors buggin out, they was knockin on the window
There was mad cute girls, booties juicier than skittles
Cups in the sky man pour me up a little
Uh oh, here come the cops yo
Everybody got low
And get everyone who ain't 21 up out of here
What they doing here they ain't supposed to be
(bridge)
Wasted, faded, really shit face-ted
Yeah this is my life and I wouldn't want to change it
We go all out, party till we fall out
If you do the same thing, holla (oh yeah)
(chorus)
I can't believe, I can't believe, I can't believe, I can't believe
What happened last night, I'm barely sober
I think I need, I think I need, I think I need, I think I need
To come back down, the party's over
There were two drunk girls in the bathroom
My boys dad came home, he was mad cool
Had the time of my life, it all felt right
