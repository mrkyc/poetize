No, girl she ain't you
No, so I miss you
It's Bei Maejor, the Jukebox Boy
Verse 1:
I think back, 'bout when we used to be
So happy, me and you together, me and you together
My new girl tryna, replace that
But she could never be, what you were to me
I know you like whatever, (psh whatever)
But don't be like whatever
Hook:
So now I'm hopin', maybe one day you'll let your heart open
If you don't then you'll leave me heartbroken, all alone
Singing this song, singing, singing this song
Chorus:
So now I'm like, no
There's no way that any other girl, could do the things you do
If only I had known
I'd have never let you go away, and do them things to you
But now my baby's gone, gone away
And I got, another girl who's cool
But no she ain't you, girl
You know she ain't you, girl

So, uhm, I think back
'Bout how we used to say, that we were gonna stay
Always together, any kinda weather
Any bird, any plane, Superman don't mean a thing
(no, no,)
I think back, 'bout how we used to be, all on the phone
Talking til 3, or 4, or 5 in the morning
Without being bored, and talking 'bout nothing
Think back, many years
When I used to sneak in your crib like this
Shh, be quiet, or your dad'll hear us
Then he's gonna kill us, I don't wanna die
Hook:
So now I'm hoping, maybe one day you'll let your heart open
If you don't then you'll leave me heartbroken, all alone
Singing this song, singing, singing this song
Chorus:
So now I'm like, no
There's no way that any other girl, could do the things you do
If only I had known
I'd have never let you go away, and do them things to you
But now my baby's gone, gone away
And I got, another girl who's cool
But no she ain't you, girl
You know she ain't you, girl
Bridge:
So now I'm calling the radio, hoping that my call gets through
Cause I wanna play this song, and I wanna dedicate it to you
I'm on the phone with the radio, hoping that this call gets through (through)
Cause I want you to hear this song, and I wanna dedicate it you
Chorus:
So now I'm like, no
There's no way that any other girl, could do the things you do
If only I had known
I'd have never let you go away, and do them things to you
But now my baby's gone, gone away
And I got, another girl who's cool
But no she ain't you, girl
You know she ain't you, girl
Heyy, I think back, on when we used to
Every, I think back on when we used to, uh
I think back, every, every, think back, every
Think back, every, eh back, uh
Ohh, gone away, and I know, oh, I think back
Every, know she ain't you, girl
You know she ain't youu, girl, (girl)
Tch, d-did you hear that part at the end, where I was like, "youuu"
