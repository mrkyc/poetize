Me and my homies, so tore up
Baby take a shot of patron
And mabye i can take you home
You've been working all, all day long
And i know this'll get you in your zone
And i hope everybody in this spot is tipsy
Cause i sure drink a lot
And i can't find the damn keys to my drop
But it's all good though, it don't even matter
Cause i don't wanna leave (noooo)
Cause she keep dancing on me (oooh)
So i think i'm gonna head back to the bar
So tell me what you want to drink
We're gone until
We're all, drunk in the club
Me and my homies, so tore up
We're all, drunk in the club
Go and leave without me, so tore up
Girl theres no place better to be
Than off in the club drunk with me
Take another shot, drop, and bend that booty over
Hard to keep composure, when you make it go
To the top, the top, i need another
Uhh, i'll be right back just to watch
And i hope everybody in this spot is tipsy
Cause i sure drink a lot
And i can't find the damn keys to my drop
But it's all good though, it don't even matter
