Look out, look out, look out, hey
(Back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back)
I'm gonna carry this shit on my fuckin' back
(Back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back)
I'm gonna carry this shit on my fuckin' back

I'll sleep, when I'm dead, won't even catch my breath
And I know, the weight of, the world can't crush my chest
I'll work 'til I'm dead, I'll work 'til I'm dead
I'll work 'til I'm dead, and then I'll do it all again

It's not because of that, it's not because of money
Work's in my blood and I kill 'cause I'm hungry
I kill 'cause I'm hungry
I kill 'cause I'm hungry (look out)
I'm gonna carry, I'm gonna carry this
I'm gonna carry this shit on my fuckin' back
I'm gonna carry, I'm gonna carry this
I'm gonna carry this shit on my fuckin' back
I'm gonna carry this shit on my fuckin' back
I'm gonna carry this shit on my fuckin' back
You might also like
I stand, with both arms, folded, under my chest
'Cause I know, I won't stop, 'til I'm the last one left
Fighting 'til I'm dead, eating 'til I'm fed
Never gonna stop 'til I catch my breath
Fighting 'til I'm dead, I eat 'til I'm fed
And then I'll do it all again

It's not because of that, it's not because of money
Work's in my blood and I kill 'cause I'm hungry
I kill 'cause I'm hungry
I kill 'cause I'm hungry
I'm gonna carry, I'm gonna carry this
I'm gonna carry this shit on my fuckin' back
I'm gonna carry, I'm gonna carry this
I'm gonna carry this shit on my fuckin' back
I'm gonna carry this shit on my fuckin' back
I'm gonna carry this shit on my fuckin' back

Focus on my own, every day will test me
Nobody will ever fucking catch me
I live to be the best, this is all I got
I ignore the pain 'cause the pain will never stop
You're better than this, I'm better than this
You're better than this, I'm better than this
You're bigger than this, I'm better than this
You're bigger than this, I'm better than this
You're bigger than this, you're bigger than this
I'm better than this, I'm better than this
I'm better than this, I'm better than this
I'm better than this, I'm better than this
It's not because of that, it's not because of money
Work's in my blood and I kill 'cause I'm hungry
I kill 'cause I'm hungry
I kill 'cause I'm hungry
It's not because of that, it's not because of money
Work's in my blood and I kill 'cause I'm hungry
I kill 'cause I'm hungry
I kill 'cause I'm hungry
(Look out, hey)
I'm gonna carry this shit on my fuckin' ba-

I'm gonna carry this shit on my fuckin' back

On my fuckin' back
