Faithful to the end (We got to be)
Faithful to the end (Uh, I want to be)
Faithful to the end (Yes, it's for the people)
I'd like to be her very best friend
(God moves, yeah)

I was rollin' around, in my mind it occurred
What if God was a "her"?
Would I treat Her the same? Would I still be runnin' game on Her?
In what type of ways would I want Her?
Would I want Her for Her mind or Her heavenly body?
Couldn't be out gettin' bogus with someone so godly
If I was wit' Her would I still be wantin' my ex?
The lies, the greed, the weed, the sex
Wouldn't be ashamed to give her part of my check
Wearin' her cross, I mean the heart on my neck
Her, I would reflect on the streets of the Chi'
Ride wit' Her, 'cause I know for me She'd die
Through good and bad, call on Her like I'm chirpin' Her
Couldn't be jealous 'cause other brothers worship Her
Walk this earth for Her, glory, I'm grateful
To be in Her presence I try to stay faithful

He worked with her, she was his lady's best friend
Even if they don't try, some ladies test men
And this was a test that was bigger than him
Some believe it's the nature that is given to men
He had a good gig, a wife, a kid, a decent home
One reason or another couldn't find peace at home
She asked, "Why do men always have to stray?"
He said, "I'm bad, not as bad as Eric Benet"
"I used to take 'em out to eat but they wasn't really eatin'
Mighta got a little head but I wasn't really cheatin'"
It's hard when your lady don't believe what you say
And what you did in the past you gotta live with today
She asked if they could spend the night together
He thought, and said, "I'm tryin' to get my life together"
Went home to his lady, these were his confessions
"Baby, you a blessin' and my best friend"

Faithful to the end
