All the doors to my life are open wide
Just as long as the wheels keep on turning 'round
I will live for the groove 'til the sun goes down
Living it up, living it up
I can feel it
Living it up
Is it a crazy notion?
Living it up, living it up
I can feel it
Living it up
I got forward motion
I don't wanna go to war, I don't wanna go to war
I said I know what I want and I don't wanna go to war, do you follow me?
I saw a soldier standing in a bar, looked so tired he'd come so far
He said "I need to love someone, before they drop the atom bomb"
There's a girl at the back making eyes at me
And her hair long and black is a sight to see
But I get kind of scared when love's around
I just live for the groove 'til the sun goes down
Living it up, living it up
I can feel it
Living it up
Is it a false emotion?
Living it up, living it up
I can feel it
Living it up
I got forward motion
So I'm a taking you out but I'm a faking
I'm married to the beat
To the music I gave the heart I could have given you
Still there's something 'bout the way that you move
And the way that people stare it's the shock of the new
I want my friends to see me standing next to you
The sun goes down
Living it up, living it up
I can feel it
Living it up
I got forward motion
Ooh, watch her dance
There must be one like her in every club in every town
But I don't mind if that the way she wants to be
There's something 'bout her that reminds me of me
She's my soulmate
We'll be together 'til the sun goes down
The sun goes down
Living it up, living it up
I can feel it
Living it up
Is it a false emotion?
Living it up, living it up
I can feel it
Living it up
I got forward motion
Living it up, living it up
The sun goes down
