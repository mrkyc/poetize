Ayy, oh, I am, ayy, oh, I

Grey hoodies, they covered their heads
I can't see their faces
I can't see, see, see, see, see
They knew me
Look, sweat on my head
My heart's thumpin', drummin'
No need, no need to take from me
Don't throw the paint on me
I see this lake formin'
I got lo-lost astray
In this forest runnin' away
I slip up, I'm on the edge now
They see me, and I nearly
I nearly lose my grip, but you held on to me
And you shake me, and tell me that I'm okay, but

I swear they smell the blood on me
I hear them coming for me
I swear they smell the blood on me
I hear them coming for me, for me

I get up and the sky's blood red
I'm still heavy breathin'
Felt so much more than dreamin'
I get up, they're at the edge of my bed
Yeah, how did they find me, find me?
They said there's somethin' bleedin' in me
Somethin' screamin' in me
Somethin' buried deep beneath
Well I need to, need to get away
So I get it, steal this get-away
And I accelerate, and I accelerate
But my gears got stuck
I'm on this road now
I'm so alone now, swervin' out of control now
And I crash the whip
And this tree flew through me
Arms out, you pull me
And wipe my wounds clean

I swear they smell the blood on me
I hear them coming for me
I swear they smell the blood on me
I hear them coming for me, for me
I swear they hear me coming
I swear they hear me coming
Through the trees
Through the trees
Through the trees
Through the trees
Through the trees
Through the trees
Through the trees, trees, trees, trees

I swear they smell the blood on me
I hear them coming for me
I swear they smell the blood on me
