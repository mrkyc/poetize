I see you in the dark
'Cause I've been where you are
You're too scared show me love
'Cause too fresh with the scars
Well I don't have the answers
So I won't tell you lies
You were there when I was down, love
But you gotta live your own life

She said I can't let this happen
No, I can't let this happen again
I found my love and I
I don't wanna lose it again

And I, I told you all my secrets, lover
No, I
I don't want to have to speak to another, my dear
And I, I find it hard to fully trust you
And I
I'm staring at this multi-colored cluster of lust and love

She said I can't let this happen
No, I can't let this happen again
I found my love and I
I don't wanna lose it again

Her eyes, ears, and her mouth
She looks just like you, my dear

I said I can't let this happen
I can't let this happen again

I don't wanna lose it again
I said I can't let this happen
