Magnetic lights in the blue-high haze
A magnifying glass upon my face

It's so hot I've been melting out here
I'm made out of plastic out here
You touched down in the base of my fears
Houston, can-can-can you hear?
And we both had to harness our pain
Close it and hope it decays
Oh, inhale and I'm up and away
Up and away

I love those mornings, when the sun's up
Smoking in the lobby, yeah
Waiting for my name to pop up, yeah, pop up
And usually I'd run home, and tuck the issue under
Oh, sleeping with my worries, no
I really didn't know what that lump was, my luck

It's so hot I've been melting out here
I'm made out of plastic out here
You touched down in the base of my fears
And that's when your beauty appears
It's so hot I've been melting out here
I'm made out of plastic out here
You touched down in the base of my fears
Houston, can-can-can you hear me now?

You dare know what the scarecrow hears
It's like outer space in his inner ears
And like a blossom you opened up
And understood why you could not love, oh

It's so hot I've been melting out here
I'm made out of plastic out here
You touched down in the base of my fears
Houston, can-can-can you hear?
I've been melting, melting down here
I'm made out of plastic out here
You touched down in the base of my fears
Houston, can-can-can you hear me now?
It's so hot I've been melting out here
I'm made out of plastic out here
You touched down in the base of my fears
Houston, can-can-can you hear now?
Sky height deflate tonight is (tinnitis?)
Thriving off your lessons, yes, you are my lantern
A shy light comes around my ears
The more you speak, the more I see
The more your lights grows upon me
And the more it grows, the closer I think you are, the closer I think you are
To sing me hope
Well if you don't like what you see, silhouettes inside of dreams
And I'm melting from the light
One drip at a time
And I'm melting from the light
One drip, one drip at a time
You're, you're my angel
