Waving from the ocean liner
Beaded cheering Indians behind them

Rock, rock, roll, Plymouth rock, roll over
Rock, rock, roll, Plymouth rock, roll over

Ribbon of concrete, just see what you done
Done to the church of the American Indian

Once upon the Sandwich Isles
The social structure steamed upon Hawaii

Rock, rock, roll, Plymouth rock, roll over
Rock, rock, roll, Plymouth rock, roll over

Bicycle rider, just see what you've done
Done to the church of the American Indian

Mahalo lule, mahalo lulai, kini wakapula
Mahalo lule, mahalo lulai, kini wakapula
Mahalo lule, mahalo lulai, kini wakapula
Mahalo lule, mahalo lulai, kini wakapula
Mahalo lule, mahalo lulai, kini wakapula
