My name is Brian and I'm the man
I write hit songs with a wave of my hand
Songs of surf and sun and sand
I make great music with my band
Songs you dance to and songs of joy
I'm the original Beach Boy
Everybody's gone surfin' Surfin USA
All the songs I used to write
Talked about girls who weren't too bright
Round round get around I got around
What I was lookin' for I never found
As time goes on I've seen the light
Intelligent chicks are dynamite
When I grow up to be man
Giddy-up giddy-up 409
Now some guys like the flashy types
And some guys dig the ugly types
I'm no different from the rest
I love hips and legs and breasts
But strictly on a higher plane
What really turns me on's her brain
You might also likeSmart girls, talkin' 'bout smart girls
Sexy legs with high IQs
Smart girls, I love the smart girls
You brainy babes with your attitudes
Smart smart smart smart girls
Did I love you little surfer girl
Or was it just your bod and long blonde curls
Fun fun fun was all we heard
Cruisin' in her daddy's thunderbird
Ba ba ba ba barbara ann
She ran away with another man
This is the worst trip
Help me, Rhonda
Get her out of my heart
Rhonda helped helped, helped me for a while
Not much going on behind her smile
I wanna hot hot, massive stimulation
Women with more imagination
Yeah smart girls are my inspiration
Given me
Good good good good vibrations
Wouldn't it be nice
If they gave PHDs
For strokin' me with hypotheses
Gimme a gal who teaches school
Who's not afraid to break the rules
Women doctors and lawyers, too
Can really make a man out of you
Smart girls, talkin' 'bout smart girls
Sexy legs with high IQs
Smart girls, I love the smart girls
You brainy babes with your attitudes
Smart smart smart smart girls
Smart girls
Wish they all could be
Smart girls
Rhyme in poetry
A clever head is a real turn-on
You bright, you brainy amazons
Authors, scientists, and architechts
Sultry babes with intellect
Don't worry baby
Everything will turn out
God only knows what I'd be
Without smart girls
Hip hop and harmony
I'm wiser now, I know where it's at
Intelligence is an aphrodisiac
So if you're seekin' that perfect mate
Listen to Brian, beauty's great but
Smart girls, talkin' 'bout smart girls
Sexy legs with high IQs
Smart girls, I love the smart girls
You brainy babes with your attitudes
Big brains are awesome, dude
Smart smart smart smart girls
Smart girls, talkin' 'bout smart girls
Sexy legs with high IQs
Smart girls, I love the smart girls
You brainy babes with your attitudes
I wanna congratulate you
