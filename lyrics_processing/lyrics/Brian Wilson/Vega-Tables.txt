I'm gonna be round my vegetables
I'm gonna chow down my vegetables
I love you most of all
My favorite vege-table

If you brought a big brown bag of them home
I'd jump up and down and hope you'd toss me a carrot

I'm gonna keep well my vegetables
Cart off and sell my vegetables
I love you most of all
My favorite vege-table

I tried to kick the ball but my tenny flew right off
I'm red as a beet 'cause I'm so embarassed

Sleep a lot eat a lot brush em like crazy
Run a lot do a lot never be lazy (boy)
Sleep a lot eat a lot brush em like crazy
Run a lot do a lot never be lazy (boy)

I throw away my candy bar and I ate the wrapper
And when they told me what I did I burst into laughter (pa, pa, pa, pa, du-du-du, du-du-du!)
