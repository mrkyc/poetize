A diamond necklace played the pawn
Hand in hand some drummed along, oh
To a handsome mannered baton (bygone, bygone)

A blind class aristocracy
Back through the opera glass you see
The pit and the pendulum drawn (bygone, bygone)

Columnated ruins domino
Canvass the town and brush the backdrop
Are you sleeping?

Hung velvet overtaken me
Dim chandelier awaken me
To a song dissolved in the dawn (bygone, bygone)

The music hall, a costly bow
The music, all is lost for now
To a muted trumperter swan (bygone, bygone)
You might also like
Columnated ruins domino
Canvass the town and brush the backdrop
Are you sleeping, Brother John?
- Part 2 -

Dove-nested towers the hour was
Strike the street quicksilver moon
Carriage across the fog
Two-Step to lamp lights cellar tune

The laughs come hard in Auld Lang Syne
The glass was raised, the fired rose
The fullness of the wine, the dim last toasting
While at port, adieu or die

A choke of grief hard hardened, I
Beyond belief, a broken man too tough to cry

Surf's up, mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm
Aboard a tidal wave
Come about hard and join
The young and often spring you gave
I heard the word
Wonderful thing
A children's song
- Part 3  -

A children's song (Child, child, child, the child, the child, father of child)
Have you listened as they played? (Child, child, the child, father of child)
Their song is love (Child, child, child, the child, the child, father of child)
And the children know the way (Child, child, the child, father of child)
A children's song (Child, child, the child, the child, father of child)
Have you listened as they played? (Child, child, the child, father of child)
Their song is love (That's why the child is father of the man)
And the children know the way (Child, child, the child, father of child)
A-child
