Don't let this summer go to waste
The enemy is preparing their children. Are you?
Time to show them who's boss
Moloch demands fresh blood to maintain the appetite of his mechanical heart
Will you sacrifice your first born like Abraham would his Isaac?
Will you sacrifice your first born like Abraham would his Isaac?
Tell me, why Dick Cheney underneath my bed?
Hell no, that ain't cool
Tendin' to the lips of a shrunken head
No sir, that ain't cool
Come on now, take one for the team
Stick it to the man, stick it to the man
Raise the dagger high above Isaac
Drive it down as hard as you can
Shiny Master Cadillackness, halos suit you well
All goes exactly as planned, so many tomorrows to sell
Shiny Master Cadillackness, halos suit you well
Steadfast, upset the system, so many tomorrows to sell
Mother, mother, don't wanna work on the farm no more
Father, father, don't wanna wear your uniform
Mary, Mary, keep me safe and comforted
Father, father, raise that dagger above your head

Are you ready to prove your love to the Lord?
I said are you willing to prove your love to the Lord?
As Abraham handed down his first born on a stone
Do you wonder what is right and what is wrong?
