Every time I set to write
Lyricals on the women
I always seem to end up
The victim of some terrible ass kicking
So now I'm telling myself
Friend, why you got the obsession?
Here it is now, people
To the best of my recollection

It goes against my Catholic upbringing
I admit it
I'm a sucker for The Witch
Sucker for The Witch

I can tell you precisely
Where this all began
Salem, Massachusetts
And I was hardly a man
I fell madly in love with
Some brand of Stevie Nicks
Oh, I begged and I pleaded
Like a fiend for a fix

I must unburden my guilty conscience
I admit it
I'm a sucker for The Witch
May God have mercy on my wicked soul
I can't help myself
I'm a sucker for The Witch
I might deny her
But my heart will never resist
I can't help myself
I'm a sucker

She's made her appearances
In many the rhyme
And that's my cross to bear
Until the end of time
Better call The Inquisition
Better put me to the test
Give me exorcism
For I am truly possessed

It goes against my Catholic upbringing
I admit it
I'm a sucker for The Witch
Sucker for The Witch
I must unburden my guilty conscience
I admit it
I'm a sucker for The Witch
May God have mercy on my wicked soul
I can't help myself
I'm a sucker for The Witch
I might deny her
But my heart will never resist
I can't help myself
I'm a sucker for The Witch

It goes against my Catholic upbringing
I admit it
I'm a sucker for The Witch
May God have mercy on my wicked soul
I can't help myself
I'm a sucker for The Witch
I might deny her
But my heart will never resist
I can't help myself
