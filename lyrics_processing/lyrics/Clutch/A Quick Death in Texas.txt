My nasty Yankee mannerisms
Didn't jive with the local traditions
How was I to know she had a jealous husband?
He was the GM of a Tractor Supply
Well acquainted with the guns and knives
Sometimes, I swear I have less sense than a bag of hammers

I prayed for courage
I prayed for love
I prayed for guidance from the heavens above
I prayed to know divine protections
But now I'm praying for a quick death in Texas

Hey, hey
Please forgive me, Mr. Gibbons

I crawled my way into The Doom Saloon
In an attempt to cauterize my wounds
I did a terrible job, and they became powerfully infected
I found myself atop a stolen roan
Quite convinced that I would never see home
And all on account of my lack of common manners

I prayed for courage
I prayed for love
I prayed for guidance from the heavens above
I prayed to know divine protections
But now I'm praying for a quick death in Texas

The saloon doors stopped swinging
The piano player stopped playing (Hey, hey)
In the shadows, I could hear
Archaic Spanish phrases (Hey, hey)
The preacher stood up from his table
In his right hand, he held a Bible (Hey, hey)
And in his left, the business end
Of a Winchester rifle

I prayed for courage
I prayed for love
I prayed for guidance from the heavens above
I prayed to know divine protections
But now I'm praying for a quick death in Texas
