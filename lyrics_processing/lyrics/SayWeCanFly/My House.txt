When your laughter
Was the sweetest sound I'd ever heard
We spent two whole years making this place our own
But then you disappeared
And left me here alone

Come get the things you couldn't live without

'Cause it's the only thing that I picked out

So I guess I gotta change the locks now
Find a way to love myself again
Gotta put my heart on lockdown

Come get your shit out of my-

It was November
