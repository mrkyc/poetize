And with my eyes I cannot see my way out of the dark
I am a wolf, in my bare feet praying for a spark
And as I sleep I feel the rain as it rips my throat apart
And my paw prints are stained with blood
I follow the moon when I can't trust the sun
I've been unfaithful, I let these hands sink so low
If I'm an angel, why do these wings cut my throat?
What beauty lies here in this pile of broken bones?
Without you I would never know
There's an answer somewhere in the sky
But like the earth I will accept that every flower grows and dies
And if you just look close enough you will see it in my eyes
That heaven's what I seek, but hell is what I find
And my paw prints are stained with blood
I follow the moon when I can't trust the sun
I've been unfaithful, I let these hands sink so low
If I'm an angel, why do these wings cut my throat?
What beauty lies here in this pile of broken bones?
Without you I would never know
The cigarettes and nicotine
The alcohol and crazy dreams
Are all the things that make me up to be so human
Never knowing what I want, just trying to live with what I got
I don't know if I'm here or not, I might lose it
You might also likeWhat the hell is it that you want from me?
I'm losing everything. I'm just trying to breathe
I'm just trying to breathe
And what is it that you want from me
I'm losing everything. I'm just trying to breathe
I'm just trying to breathe
I've been unfaithful, I let these hands sink so low
If I'm an angel, why do these wings cut my throat?
What beauty lies here in
In this pile of broken bones?
