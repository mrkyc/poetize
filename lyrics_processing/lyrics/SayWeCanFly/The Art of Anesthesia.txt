The people who are dead or the people who are free
Sometimes I hear them as they whisper to me
I try to stay awake so I won't die in my sleep
And I was quick to take a second look through
The window on the door of the operating room
And the adrenaline, it threw my eyes
To the table on the floor where the patients lie
I saw his face and I could not speak
As the anesthetic kissed his cheek
I felt my lips go cold and my limbs go weak
Because the body on the table where the patients die was me
It was me
Give me back my oxygen mask
Cause I don't want to feel the walls of my heart collapse
So put me under
I would sooner die on this table
Than face what causes me to be so unstable
There was a lie between my demons and me
And a body made of paper in the passenger seat
As I open my eyes, I could not see
I felt the stitches come loose and the blood run free
You might also likeAnd as my thoughts began to shake
I felt the hand of the darkness kiss my face
And then the devil woke up and he grabbed my throat
He pulled me down to the place where the silence grows
He looks at me with hollow eyes
And he whispered my name as the flowers died
I felt my heart go cold as I sank between
The ocean I am and the river I'm meant to be
I'm meant to be
Give me back my oxygen mask
Cause I don't want to feel the walls of my heart collapse
So put me under
I would sooner die on this table
Than face what causes me to be so unstable
Now I'm standing by the window on a Sunday
And I can't quite recall
Why I cannot move at all
And I feel so tired and wounded
Like the stitches on my soul came apart
I'm standing here in the dark
Well, maybe it's from the drinks we had last night
But good God, I love those friends of mine
The best that alcohol can buy
Or maybe it's from the lack of sleep
But all those secrets I've kept, trying to be so sweet to you
It's dark, my dear
But it got me through, it got me through
So give me back my oxygen mask
Cause I don't want to feel the walls of my heart collapse
So put me under
I would sooner die on this table
Then face what causes me to be so unstable
Causes me to be so unstable
Causes me to be so unstable
Sometimes I wonder if I'm only a ghost
Wearing human skin I never chose
I listen to the devil as he spoke
