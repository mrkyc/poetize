You think you know me well
But you don't know the half of what I've been through
Sometimes we gotta walk through hell
Just one of many places that I've been to
And I don't know why you think
That you deserve a piece of everything
But take what you can, and earn what
You want, 'cause I'm not gonna give you anything
I've been, I've been thinking about you
But I don't, I don't know you now
I thought, I thought our love was true
I guess we both slipped somehow
I guess we both slipped somehow
You try your hardest to convince me
I'm worth nothing
But even with a scar, a diamond's
Still worth something
I don't know why you don't understand bad timing
But do want you want and say what you can
'Cause to me you'll never be
A rock worth climbing
I've been, I've been thinking about you
But I don't, I don't know you now
I thought, I thought our love was true
I guess we both slipped somehow
You might also likeI've been, I've been thinking about you
But I don't, I don't know you now
I thought, I thought our love was true
I guess we both slipped somehow
Gas in the engine and drove all night
With a tank full of memories
We said our goodbyes
I never thought that it would end like this
I never thought that, no, I never thought that, no
Cracks in the rhymes remind me to smile
'Cause they're all I've got to remind me of why
I never thought that it would end like this
I never thought that, no never thought that, no
I never thought that it would end like this
Never thought that, I never thought that, no
I never thought that it would end like this
