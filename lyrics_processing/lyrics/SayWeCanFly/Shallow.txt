Take your time
Don't be so shallow
'Cause shallow's a mess
You don't want, trust me

Speak your mind
Don't be so shallow
'Cause shallow's a mess
You don't want, trust me

But if you still love me
Just tell me you do
'Cause I'm here and I just wanna know
Do you have what it takes?
To forget me this way?
Are you tired of sleeping alone?
Or are you not alone?

Well, maybe it's time that I go
'Cause I'm right in front of you
But you don't even notice how there's nothing left but your bones
And they're beautiful
Even though you're a ghost you're still taking up most of my heart
(Most of my heart)

I know you are already a mess you don't want, trust me
(Yeah, yeah)

(Even though you're a ghost you're still taking up most) of my heart
Now I see
That there's nothing left in the water for me
So I'll dig, and I'll dig, 'til I find your bones
'Til I find your bones
Maybe it's time that I go
'Cause I'm right in front of you
(Oh-oh-oh)
