I was always taught to forgive and forget
I live a simple life but I can't pretend
Like it's all ok, when really it's not
Because I've learned that liars get caught
I know I'm only seventeen
But things get rough
When you live in this town and you know you're stuck
Until you get a car
And even then, you won't get far
Don't get me wrong, it's been a party
But I think I'm passing out

I'm seventeen and it's hard enough
To understand that I'm growing up fast
My mom and dad, were all I had
But everybody drifts I guess
I know there's always gotta be a better place than here
I can feel the sun, but I'm nowhere near
So what do you say we make like angels
And get the hell outta here

I could make an honest living at the grocery store
With all the people who forgot their dreams
And closed the doors
But I know that I need more
I can't survive on mopping floors
Now the days of the week are all the same
If I'm not at work, then I'm with my friends
Doing stupid things, I won't forget
Until the day I die
Don't get me wrong, it's been a party
But I need to move along

I'm seventeen and it's hard enough
To understand that I'm growing up fast
My mom and dad, were all I had
But everybody drifts I guess
I know there's always gonna be a better place than here
I can feel the sun but I'm no where near
So what do you say, we make like angels
And get the hell outta here
Woooaaaahhhhh
Let's get the hell outta here
Woooaaaahhhhh
Let's get the hell outta here
Woooaaaahhhhh
Let's get the hell outta here

I'm seventeen and it's hard enough
To understand that I'm growing up fast
My mom and dad, were all I had
But everybody drifts I guess
I know there's always gonna be a better place than here
I can feel the sun but I'm nowhere near
So what do you say, we make like angels
And get the hell outta here
So what, do you say?
