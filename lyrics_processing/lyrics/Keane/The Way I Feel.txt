Well they said you were a bright child
Never anything but joy behind your eyes
No sign of all the dark clouds
Spreading like volcanic dust over your blue skies
Now they're looking for an answer
Where the rot set in and set up the landslide

But it only makes it worse now
You're like a puzzle to be worked out

And it's the voices in your head now
Saying there's something wrong about the way I feel
A broken link, a missing part, a punctured wheel

And it's not what you expected
The way the world you built loves to cut you down
The way your head gets twisted
And you sit up all night trying to figure it out
And they say you've made your bed now
Don't you see you've brought it on yourself

And they say that you should move on
But you can't even get your shoes on

And it's the voices in your head now
Saying there's something wrong about the way I feel
A broken link, a missing part, a punctured wheel
It doesn't matter what you say now
It's like some vision in the stars that seems so real
The way I feel, the way I feel, the way I feel
The way I feel, the way I feel, the way I feel

And everyone else has got things sorted out
You stand on the edge talking to yourself
You're young, left behind and tangled up inside

And it's not what you expected
The way your head gets twisted
And it's the voices in your head now
(And it's the voices in your head now)

And it's the voices in your head now
Saying there's something wrong about the way I feel
A broken link, a missing part, a punctured wheel
It doesn't matter what you say now
It's like some vision in the stars that seems so real
The way I feel, the way I feel, the way I feel
The way I feel, the way I feel, the way I feel
The way I feel
It's like some vision in the stars that seems so real
The way I feel, the way I feel, the way I feel
The way I feel, the way I feel, the way I feel
The way I feel, the way I feel, the way I feel
