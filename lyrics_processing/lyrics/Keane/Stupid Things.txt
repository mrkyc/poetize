Friend
I've done something stupid again
Is not that I don't love you, I do
It's just I'm in this black hole so blue
I've done something stupid again

And now it's little lies and alibis
And the second phone, can't make it home
I'm working late, you know I hate
To miss the kids' bedtime again
I drank too much, a working lunch
I'll crash in town, so don't wait up
If I don't text, my phone's just dead
I've got that thing, I'm sure I said
And I know that you know and we both just play along
Just one more stupid thing that I have done

It starts
Got money in your pocket at last
It makes you think you're more than you are
You're just another sucker for the dream
No more or less than you have ever been

But now it's little lies and alibis
And the second phone, can't make it home
I'm working late, you know I hate
To miss the kids' bedtime again
I drank too much, a working lunch
I'll crash in town, so don't wait up
If I don't text, my phone's just dead
I've got that thing, I'm sure I said
And you look like a joke and we both just play along
Just one more stupid thing that I have done

(It's not that I don't love you)
Just one more stupid thing that I have done
(Little lies and alibis)
And the second phone (I drank too much)
I've done something stupid (Don't wait up)

And now it's little lies and alibis
And the second phone, can't make it home
I'm working late, you know I hate
To miss the kids' bedtime again
I drank too much, a working lunch
I'll crash in town, so don't wait up
If I don't text, my phone's just dead
I've got that thing, I'm sure I said
And you feel like a fool
And we both just play along
And you feel like a fool
And we both just play along
And you feel like a fool
And we both just play along
