Oh not again
One thing lead to another when
He said let's just be friends
Right then and there I said to him
Oh thanks so much for nothing
I hope you find that something
Or whoever she is you think you're looking for
Oh don't do me any favors
I guess I'll see you later
Matter fact pull over and let me out this door
Chorus:
Oh Johnny took my heart
And left me right here on the sidewalk
On the corner is where he dropped me off
I'm saying ohh why did we have to part
So now I'm dialing on my cellphone
Begging Johnny baby bring me back my heart
Bring me back my heart
Bring me back my heart
Bring me back my heart
Verse 2:
Now I ask myself why?
Why did I let him go? now I'm
Walking alone, alone in this cold
Johnny the least you could've done
Was drive me home
You might also likeOh thanks so much for nothing
I hope you find that something
Or whoever she is you think you're looking for
Oh don't do me any favors
I guess I'll see you later
Matter fact don't bother knocking on my door
Chorus:
Oh Johnny took my heart
And left me right here on the sidewalk
On the corner is where he dropped me off
I'm saying ohh why did we have to part
So now I'm dialing on my cellphone
Begging Johnny baby bring me back my heart
Bring me back my heart (my heart)
Bring me back my heart (my heart)
Bring me back my heart (my heart)
Verse 3:
Now I'm hiding
This is hard for me to do
See I'm not that chick who sits around
And waits all night for you
But you're worth it
Why you left me I don't know
But I'll walk these streets all night
Until I bring my baby home
Oh I need your loving
You got that special something
Who am I kidding
Please Johnny come back home
Chorus:
Oh Johnny took my heart
And left me right here on the sidewalk
On the corner is where he dropped me off
I'm saying ohh why did we have to part
So now I'm dialing on my cellphone
