Love, love, love
Hold me close and hold me fast
The magic spell you cast
This is La Vie en Rose
When you kiss me, heaven sighs
And though I close my eyes
I see La Vie en Rose
Use to be that i saw life in shades of black and white
Then I Caught a taste of something new and saw the light
My vision's changed everything is coming up pink
If your cup overflows like mine its life dont cry come on take a drink!
Hold me close and hold me fast
The magic spell you cast
This is La Vie en Rose
When you kiss me, heaven sighs
And though I close my eyes
I see La Vie en Rose
Each day is a gift if I just paint the picture right
My life has changed, its like I see it in new light
I'd never thought that I could feel so rosy
If you feel me let him know and give it to me like you owe me ooh
Hold me close and hold me fast
The magic spell you cast
This is La Vie en Rose
When you kiss me, heaven sighs
And though I close my eyes
I see La Vie en Rose
Hold me close and hold me fast
The magic spell you cast
This is La Vie en Rose
When you kiss me, heaven sighs
And though I close my eyes
I see La Vie en Rose
Looooove!
Is all I've got to make you want me
And now there's no one else that my heart can see
Looks like a cupid when it shot me with that r-o-s-e
Quand il me prend dans ses bras
Il me parle tout bas
Je vois La Vie en Rose
Il me dit des mots d'amour
Das mots de tous les Jours
Et ca me fait quelques choses
Hold me close and hold me fast
The magic spell you cast
This is La Vie en Rose
When you kiss me, heaven sighs
And though I close my eyes
I see La Vie en Rose
Hold me close and hold me fast
The magic spell you cast
This is La Vie en Rose
When you kiss me, heaven sighs
And though I close my eyes
I see La Vie en Rose
