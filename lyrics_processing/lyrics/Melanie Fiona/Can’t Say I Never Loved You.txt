Oh ohhhh
Huuuuhhh woooaaaahh
If my love can't be with you
Who in the world can I give it to
Who can I live my life to change the world with
Oh yeah
If I love what you tell me
'Cause I can't take responsibilities
My pride is all I have
Now you're gonna take it take it take it from me
Promises were all I got
It might mean nothing to you
But to me it meant a lot
(CHORUS:)
You said you love me but you left
Lord knows I really did my best
I relied on you to do the rest
Can't say I never loved you
And I was giving you me
Hoping that the possibility
Wouldn't need to set you free
Can't say I never loved you
You might also likeWhere you going I hope you're staying
There's no way you can't repay
What you took from me
Baby, no way
I'm not crying over you
Not gonna chase you down like some fool
If this is it baby have it your way
Promises were all I got
It might mean nothing to you
But to me it meant a lot
(CHORUS:)
You said you love me but you left
Lord knows I really did my best
I relied on you to do the rest
Can't say I never loved you
And I was giving you me
Hoping that the possibility
Wouldn't need to set you free
Can't say I never loved you
Can't say that I never loved you
Loved you, loved you
Can't say that I never loved you
Loved you, loved you
Can't say that I never loved you
Loved you, loved you
Can't say that I never loved you
Loved you, loved you
Was it everything that you planned it to
Believe it, baby I'm gonna get over you
And now the change is all from red to blue
You're like old news, old news, old news
(CHORUS:)
You said you love me but you left
Lord knows I really did my best
I relied on you to do the rest
Can't say I never loved you
And I was giving you me
Hoping that the possibility
Wouldn't need to set you free
Can't say I never loved you
Can't say that I never loved you
Loved you loved you
Can't say that I never loved you
Loved you loved you
Can't say that I never loved you
Loved you loved you
Can't say that I never loved you
