Verse 1 Melanie:
Oh  love, so many suffer
We all ask why
As they fight for their lives
Can we try
Though it may seem impossible change it
Oh, we just can't sit by
Love just can't let them die
How long 'till we get it right
How long will it take
Oh, we should come together
And we should start today
Chorus:
I know that we can do it
There ain't nothin' we can't rise above
All we need is L-O-V-E, love
Love is the right solution
Love is the answer we're all in need of
It's love, all we need is love
Yeah, yeah, alright
If you're with me say alright tonight
Yeah, yeah, alright. It's L-O-V-E, love
Verse 2 John:
So many voices
So many mother's cry
Can we take the time to listen
Oh, can we try
In this time of trouble we know
Oh, love's the only cure
It's what we're waiting for
How long 'till we get it right
How long will it take
Oh, we should come together
And we should start today
Chorus:
I know that we can do it
There ain't nothin' we can't rise above
All we need is L-O-V-E, love
Love is the right solution
Love is the answer we're all in need of
It's love, all we need is love
