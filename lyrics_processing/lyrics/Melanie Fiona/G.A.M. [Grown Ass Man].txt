Is this the best you can do for me?
Sit on the couch with your PS3 (oh no)
Call out my  name like you're wanting me
To be your waitress (that ain't me for sure)

That you just wanna play
Better take your toys and go, because I wanna...

A - Ass
M- Man

Don't come here asking for a second chance
I ain't gone fall for your song and dance (oh no)
If you was grown you woulda thought of that
Before you started (hanging on a thread)

I done did, there and done, all of that yesterday
I can see already
That you just wanna play
You better run home right now, I wanna...
