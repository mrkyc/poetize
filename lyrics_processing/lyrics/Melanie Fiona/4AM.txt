Turn the lights on

Sitting here feeling kinda crazy
But not just any crazy
It's the kind you feel when you love somebody
And I know that my baby
Is calling somebody else baby
And I can't sit still
Look how gone it got me

Who knew that my heart could have a bruise?
You see this scar here on my chest?
I'm hurting and he don't even care

It's 4 AM and my lover won't answer
He's probably somewhere with a dancer
Sippin' champagne while I'm in his bed
It's 4 AM and I think I might lose it
This motherfucker thinking I'm stupid
He must've bumped his head
Don't he know it's 4 AM?
You might also like
Standing here and I'm getting heated
Pour me up a drink, I swear I need it
I think I'm about, 'bout to hurt somebody
Swear this man is begging me to leave him
Getting sick of being so mistreated
Another night without, without his arms around me

Who knew that my heart could have a bruise?
You see this scar here on my chest?
I'm hurting and he don't even care

It's 4 AM and my lover won't answer
He's probably somewhere with a dancer
Sippin' champagne while I'm in his bed
It's 4 AM and I think I might lose it
This motherfucker thinking I'm stupid
He must've bumped his head
Don't he know it's 4 AM?

I don't deserve this life
I'd make the perfect wife
And I know love's a sacrifice
But who's gonna sacrifice for me and
Give me all their time and
Who knew that my heart could have a bruise?
You see this scar here on my chest?
I'm hurting and he don't even care

It's 4 AM and my lover won't answer
He's probably somewhere with a dancer
Sippin' champagne while I'm in his bed
It's 4 AM and I think I might lose it
This motherfucker thinking I'm stupid
He must've bumped his head
Don't he know it's 4 AM?
