Raise me up like the Sun
Until you crashed into my universe
There was nothing there but just one
Soon became two when you
Said you were looking too
For that special someone
That's when you shot me, with your love through my heart
Oh I, would've bet the moon and stars that we would pass forever
But just this pass, as the seasons change
You said you couldn't stay in our flat
To clean up this mess you made
And now my summers feel like winters
And all I'm left without these splits of memories
I never dreamed you'd leave
Oh how so very silly of me
I just can't believe how someone can be
Such a cold piece of work at heart
It's a cold, cold, fucking world
Such a cold piece of work at heart
It's a cold, cold, fucking world
Such a cold, cold fucking world
Damn, could've stood the test of time
I gave my best to know I tried
But the truth is there was nothing to do
To change your fucked up mind
See the problem it was you
Let's not forget your ego too
You know you better think twice
Next time you decide to play with hearts, play nice
Oh I, I would've bet the moon and stars that we would last forever
But just as fast as the seasons change
You came and went away and that's that
Cause we really had a really good thing
And you know it
And now my summers feel like winter
And all I'm left without these splits of memories
I never dreamed you'd leave
Oh how so very silly of me
I just can't believe how someone can be
Such a cold piece of work at heart
It's a cold, cold, fucking world
Such a cold piece of work at heart
It's a cold, cold, fucking world
Such a cold, cold fucking world
Lesson learned, can't be mad
I bet you wouldn't understand
How you're heart's so cold
Love birds can't relate
Heard people do, heard people
Yes I'll be the first to say
Really made me feel someway
But, I guess that's how this thing must go
Cause sometimes love grows cold
And now my summers feel like winters
And all I'm left without these splits of memories
I never dreamed you'd leave
Oh how so very silly of me
I just can't believe how someone can be
Such a cold piece of work at heart
It's a cold, cold, fucking world
Such a cold piece of work at heart
It's a cold, cold, fucking world
