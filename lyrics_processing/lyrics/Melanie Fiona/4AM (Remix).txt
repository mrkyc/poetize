Turn the lights on

Sitting here feeling kinda crazy
But not just any crazy
It's the kind you feel when you love somebody
And I know that my baby
Is calling somebody else baby
And I can't sit still
Look how gone it got me

Who knew that my heart could have a bruise?
You see this scar here on my chest?
I'm hurting and he don't even care

It's 4 AM and my lover won't answer
He's probably somewhere with a dancer
Sippin' champagne while I'm in his bed
It's 4 AM and I think I might lose it
This mo'fucka thinking I'm stupid
He must've bumped his head
Don't he know it's 4 AM
You might also like
Gyal you know this
Too much to be
Know it's 4 AM
I think I might lose it
Leave me alone
Know it's 4 AM

Wid bang bang bang girl
First things first girl
Why you gotta think the worst girl?
It's like a curse my heart it hurts with you and these requesting
You questioning In my every move
Wanna know everything I do
You know you're my only put to you only girl I stay true
Callin me friends dem late at night
Waking dem up girl that's not right
These likkle things gwaan make us fight
Never happend before girl I don't know why
You insist to act so insane
Consistantly make me feel pain
Drainin my brain emotions all strain
Can't maintain outta road I'm stayin
All when she bawling still me she calling
Still remember those when we would blaze
In love she fallin'
When you met me baby I was a player
I was balling
Change around in my life for you baby
Because you my darling
It's 4 AM and my lover won't answer
He's probably somewhere with a dancer
Sippin' champagne while I'm in his bed
It's 4 AM and I think I might lose it
This mo'fucka thinking I'm stupid
He must've bumped his head
Don't he know it's 4 AM

Standing here and I'm getting heated
Pourin' me up a drink I swear I need it
I think I'm about
'Bout to hurt somebody
Swear this man is begging me to leave
Him
Getting sick of being so mistreated
Another night without..
Without his arms around me

Who knew that my heart could have a
Bruise?
You see this scar here on my chest?
I'm hurting and he don't even care
It's 4 AM and my lover won't answer
He's probably somewhere with a dancer
Sippin' champagne while I'm in his bed
It's 4 AM and I think I might lose it
This mo'fucka thinking I'm stupid
He must've bumped his head
