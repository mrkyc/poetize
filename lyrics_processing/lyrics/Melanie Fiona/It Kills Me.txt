Oh yeah

I've got trouble with my friends
Trouble in my life
Problems when you don't come home at night
But when you do, you always start a fight
But I can't be alone
I need you to come on home
I know you're messin' around
But who the hell else is gonna hold me down?

I've gotta be out my mind
To think it's gonna work this time
A part of me wants to leave
But the other side still believes
And it kills me, to know how much I really love you
So much, I wanna ooh-ooh-ooh
To you-hoo-hoo
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)

Should I grab his cell, call this chick up?
Start some shhhh, then hang up?
Or should I be a lady?
Ooh, maybe, 'cause I wanna have his babies
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
'Cause I don't wanna be alone
I don't need to be on my own
But I love this man
But some things I just can't stand, no
You might also like
I've gotta be out my mind
To think it's gonna work this time
A part of me wants to leave
But the other half still believes
And it kills me, to know how much I really love you
So much, I wanna ooh-ooh-ooh (Ooh)
To you-hoo-hoo

Should I pay him back? (Back)
To see how he'll react, ay-ooh (Ay-ooh)
To see if he'll react to my love (My love)
My love
(Oh, oh, ooh)

I've gotta be out my mind
To think it's gonna work this time
A part of me wants to leave
But the other side still believes
And it kills me (Oh), to know how much I really love you (So much)
So much, I wanna ooh-ooh-ooh
To you-hoo-hoo
Oh, and it kills me (Kills me), to know how much I really love you (To know how much, how much)
So much, I wanna ooh-ooh-ooh (I love you)
