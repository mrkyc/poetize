You don't, You don't
Notice that I'm here
You don't, You don't
Seem to care that you play with my heart
Take me for granted
Leave me in the dark no, no
And I'm not, I'm not
Even thinking clear
Today, I smile
Next day full of tears
Losing my mind
I don't even know if you're wasting my time no, no

Are you gonna
Crush my heart
Cover me
Cut me off
Make your decision boy
Crush my heart
Cover me
Cut me off
Make your decision

Rock, Paper, Scissors
Will it be rock, paper, scissors
I don't know what you're feeling
Will it be rock, paper, scissors
Yea, yea, yea

Wish I, wish I
Had the common sense
To know better
And just walk away
Easier said, harder to do
When I still think there's hope for me and you oh, oh
Always, hurts to
Never be put first
If I'm last on your list
Really what's my worth
Keep me in fear
Asking you questions I don't want to hear the answers to

Are you gonna
Crush my heart
Cover me
Cut me off
Make your decision boy
Crush my heart
Cover me
Cut me off
Make your decision boy
Rock, Paper, Scissors
Will it be rock, paper, scissors
I don't know what you're feeling
Will it be rock, paper, scissors

Someone should've told me I can't compete
With someone who is impossible to beat
(At his own game)
Makes my heart beat but he's killing me
Are the odds in my favor
Don't know

Rock, Paper, Scissors
Will it be rock, paper, scissors
I don't know what you're feeling
Will it be rock, paper, scissors
Yea, yea, yea, yea
Rock, Paper, Scissors
Will it be rock, paper, scissors
I don't know what you're feeling
Will it be rock, paper, scissors
