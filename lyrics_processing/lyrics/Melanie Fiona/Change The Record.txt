I hear you DJ
 
Cause this one's got scratches
Went to get drinks and I'm asking him
"How did you get this way?
Whose lipstick is on your face?"
It's been 15 minutes and 2 hours
You think you can make it up with some damn flowers
Thinking about the things you do
And I'm waiting over here and you're with God knows who
Cause you don't care right here
And you don't care who's there
And you don't care
Well here's the song I hear

You can do better
Do better
If you don't like how he's playing then change the record
You can do better
Do better
Cause I don't know what kind of games you're playing
But it's time to change the record record record
I hear you DJ, I hear you DJ
I hear you DJ, I hear you DJ
You might also like 
Cause this one's got played out
Skips everything you wanna hear about
About the purp it's a little played out
Tired of the lies you wanna rap about, yeah yeah
Cause you don't care right here
And you don't care who's there
And you don't care
Well here's the song I hear

You can do better
Do better
If you don't like how he's playing then change the record
You can do better
Do better
Cause I don't know what kind of games you're playing
But it's time to change the record record record
I hear you DJ, I hear you DJ
I hear you DJ, I hear you DJ

Well this is what the bussiness is
I was with the model type
Body like a gymnast
Hot sex each night, it was just ridiculous
It was a match made in heaven
But we had to split because we couldn't fix the differences
And the difference is
She was manipulative
And I wanted to do just whatever I did
But apparently you had a better idea and you left
I guess it's how it is
Hollywood divorce after Hollywood romance
Now when we're together, and we don't even hold hands
And we don't even two-step
And we don't even slow dance
We was a duet, we was our own band
But now I'm solo, it's no show with no fans
That's how it go though
You strike out like Roland
But strike out like baseball, you go down the court man
And now you're frozen and oh no, it's no chance
So put them hooves on your head like a Colts fan
Now they comment on your life like a spokesman
I need a mediator, you need a mediator
You need a mirror and then maybe you can see a hater
The faster we let it go, the faster you will hear me happy on the radio
Stronger and let it flow, the deeper I will fall into this hole
Cause you don't care right here
And you don't care who's there
And you don't care
Well here's the song I hear

You can do better
Do better
If you don't like how he's playing then change the record
You can do better
Do better
Cause I don't know what kind of games you're playing
But it's time to change the record record record
I hear you DJ, I hear you DJ
