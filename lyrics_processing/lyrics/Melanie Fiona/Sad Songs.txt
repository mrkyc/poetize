(Doo do doo doo)
Oh sad songs, are the best songs, oh yeah

I know there's love waiting on the of top a hill
When I get there I hope it's not to late to reveal
This broken heart of mine
It seem it ran out of time
Loving you, loving me
It's not the way it's supposed to be
But you'll regret it!
You wanna bet it!
Setting this golden goose free!

My love, where did we go wrong?
I wonder who's in your arms?
Especially because you did me wrong
You know that sad songs are the best songs
You don't have to wonder how it's gonna end
(Doo do doo doo)

Gave back my key because you seem to have so many
Did you know this, the wrong one was given to me...
With the initials "L.M."
Is that who you are seeing and
Loving her, leaving me?
It's not the way it's supposed to be!
But you'll regret it!
You'll be upset when the next man is loving me!

My love, where did we go wrong?
I wonder who's in your arms?
Especially because you did me wrong
You know that sad songs are the best songs
You don't have to wonder how it's gonna end
(Doo do doo doo)

No one to cry on
I can begin at the end of this song
Still I remain strong
Keeping interest 'til something is gone
What did I do Lord to deserve to be alone
Thought I had a love too strong so long
But you always gotta prove me wrong
You that sad songs you know are the best songs
And I don't have to won-der how it's gonna end

My love, where did we go wrong?
I wonder who's in your arms?
Especially because you did me wrong
You know that sad songs are the best songs
You don't have to wonder how it's gonna end
