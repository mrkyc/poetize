Finger on the trigger
Let it bang bang, baby let it bang
I don't give a dang cause I'm a rebel kind
Watch me do my thang
Let me introduce you to my Lucy
I don't care if you like me
(I'll walk it out on 'em)
Running from the law
I'll hit the borderline
They trying to trap me
So let's get down baby

I be locking and loading
I be shooting forever
Got my eye on the target
And I'm aiming at ya
See me moving in silence
Feel destruction and violence
Got my eye on the target
And I'm aiming at ya

Bang, Bang (I'm aiming at ya)
Bang, Bang (I'm aiming at ya)
You might also like
Ain't nothing like the feeling of that cold cold metal in my hand
Know I sound psycho, Daddy-o, you'll never understand
Let me introduce you my chrome-plated bullet
She shining
(I'll whip it out on 'em)
Polishing my '45 Chevy ride scraping the highway
Top down, pick it up

I be locking and loading
I be shooting forever
Got my eye on the target
And I'm aiming at ya
See me moving in silence
Feel destruction and violence
Got my eye on the target
And I'm aiming at ya

Bang, Bang (I'm aiming at ya)
Bang, Bang (I'm aiming at ya)

I'm aiming at ya, I'm aiming at ya
Maybe I should live and let die
Taking it like a soldier, don't cry
Hold my head
Come down from my high
I be locking and loading
I be shooting forever
Got my eye on the target
And I'm aiming at ya
I be locking and loading
I be shooting forever
Got my eye on the target
And I'm aiming at ya (Bang, Bang)
See me moving in silence
Feel destruction and violence (Let me introduce you to my Lucy)
Got my eye on the target
And I'm aiming at ya

Bang, Bang (I'm aiming at ya)
Bang, Bang (I'm aiming at ya)

I'm aiming at ya, I'm aiming at ya
Hey, mmmm yeah!
Mmmm! Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Let me introduce you to my Lucy
Ow! Hey, oh!
Bang, Bang, Bang
Bang, Bang, Bang
Bang, Bang, Bang
