Have you heard the news today?
I'm leavin' town and I'm cashin' out
This town's too small for me to stay
The time is now, I'm headin' out

Baby, I still need ya
But if you stay, I'll leave ya
'Cause I gotta get away
And if I ever see ya
My heart is gonna bleed
But I'm leavin' either way

My darling, baby, this is a warning
Said that I'm leavin' on Monday morning
You'll get no answer, no use in callin'
Because I'm leavin' on Monday morning

This flower needs somewhere to go
No room to grow on these dusty roads
I got two tickets and a dream
Eight fifteen, I'll save you a seat
