Nothing but good love here to remind me
Through all my trials, you are my best friend
My heart was bleeding and you just took me in
I'm so glad I got a second chance to love
You took me from pain, to joy
Unspeakable joy, unspeakable joy
You took me from pain, to joy
Unspeakable joy, unspeakable joy
Now there is a bright light in me that's shining
Got in my feet so I can keep climbing
Up any mountain that is before me
'Cause you say you love me, what's more you adore me
Feels good to get a second chance to love
You took me from pain, to joy
Unspeakable joy, unspeakable joy
You took me from pain, to joy
Unspeakable joy, unspeakable joy
Lord I was feelin' so bad, I was always sad
I didn't have no money, nowhere to go
Friends should say who I thought was my friends
They wouldn't answer my phone calls
I was walking pregnant in the snow trying to get a record deal
You know how bad it can get sometimes
You might also likeNever thought I'd get out of pain
And I know a lot of you felt the same
But I'm standing here today to testify
I got joy in the morning
I got joy in the evening
I got joy in the midnight hour
I got joy, joy, joy
So much joy
I got so much joy
See one day I was walking along the street with my head down so low
This brother stopped me, pat me on the shoulder and told me it ought not to be so low
He took his little hand and lifted up me chin
And to tell the truth I've been looking up ever since then
I ain't seen my feet since I don't know when
I got joy in the morning
I got joy in the evening
I got joy, joy, joy
So much joy, so much joy
Oh, I hope I never have to sing about pain again
And somebody oughta say amen (amen)
I bet it feels good to feel good
It feels nice to feel nice
I knew you were looking out for me Lord
But sometimes it just got so hard
I know the Lord
I know the Lord would renew my strength, but I was getting a little impatient
'Cause I have been waiting so long
And I had just been done so long
