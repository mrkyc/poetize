And so pleased that
So many of you come out and share
In all the love and all the happiness we have in store for you
We want you to have real good time
`cause that"s just we have in mind
Is that alright with you
Now i never intended recording this song
It was a personal poem
This until the day that my producer
Happened to thumb through my notebook
He came accross the words and he said
"we got to do somethin" with these
It"s happening everyday
And people want to hear about it Betty"
You see, its a story of a young girl
Making love for the first time
Now when i finnally got a melody
I took i home and I-I played for my mother
Now i got tell little bit about my mother
You i come from one of those pretty large familes
And i"m the baby of the family
And you never grow up to your mother
I"ll never forget the way she look at me when i played for her
She said,"UH,i like the music
You know ,baby,the melody it's really nice
But i know you're not gonna sing that song"
But we eased right on by her,yes we did
And it became one my biggest records too
So i want you do this for me if you will
Everybody think back to you're very first time
Now i'm give you little while longer
'Cause i know some of you
Have to think little further than other's
Come now,i want you to play catch-up
'Cause i dont want you waitin' till i get to the end of my song
Saying', ''oh yea now i remember''
Now wheter it was good
Or you just smiling' was good
Or on the other hand if it was not so good
Here's my story
Hmm...hmm...mmm...mmm...
Tonight is the night
That you make me a woman,mmm...
You said you''ll be gentle wwith me
And i-i hope you will,mmm...mmm...
I'm nervous and tremblin'
Waitn'for you to walk in
I'm tryin 'hard to relax
But i just can't keep still,no
I can hear your car door slamming'
I wanna play big girl and but on a sexy smile
But i know so little about what love is
I just can't't help acting like a child
You're knocking on my door and you ringing' my bell
Hope you're not impatient after waiting so very long
A whole put off with my silly hang up-ups
And we're both old enough to know right from wrong
Tonight is the night
That you make me a woman,mmm...
You said you'll gentle witt me
And i-i hope you will, hmm...mmm...
I'm nervous and tremblin'
Waintin'for you to walk in
Tryin' hard to relax
But i just can't keep still
Mmm...hey, baby
Ho,ho,baby
Ho...yeah..yeah..
Oh but what my momma should come home early
And catch us doin'
Not only will i never live it down
But my whole family relationship it''ll all be riuned
But we''ve gone little bit too far now
Oh,to turn around
So let's pray
That true love is what we've found
