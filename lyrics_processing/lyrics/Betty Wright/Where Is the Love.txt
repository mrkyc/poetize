Where is the love, where is the love you promised me?
Where is the love, where is the love you promised me?

You said I could have all your loving
And this I wanted it you'd give it to me
Now when it's down to the real nitty gritty
You're hiding your love from me, woo-hoo

Where is the love, where is the love you promised me? (Got to know)
Where is the love, where is the love you promised me?

You said I'd be the only one
That you'd be giving your sweet love to
But somebody else must be getting your love
'Cause loving me you just don't do, no, no

Where is the love, where is the love you promised me? (You know I need it, baby)
Where is the love, where is the love you promised me?

I'm waiting on your love now, baby - where is your love?
I'm hurting for your love now, baby - where is your love?
