Ooh, yeah

In the middle of the game, don't change the play
You know you were sweet to catch him
To keep him, keep it that way
In the middle of the game, don't change the play
You know you were good to the last drop
Don't stop, keep it that way

Give her breakfast in bed sometimes
Tell her that she's been on your mind
Take a ride somewhere nice to eat
Put a pair of Jimmy Choos on her feet
Stop nagging on him all the time
Start bragging on him sometimes
Go some places that he wants to go
And make him think that he runs the show

In the middle of the game, don't change the play
You know you were sweet to catch her
To keep her, keep it that way
In the middle of the game, don't change the play
You know you were good to the last drop
Don't stop, keep it that way
You might also like
Make sure there's gas in the car
Give her money to go to the spa
And she'll never forget who you are
In fact, you'll be a superstar
When his friends are watching sports in the den
Get in the kitchen, hook him up something
And even if you can't cook nothin'
Have a little takeout brought in

In the middle of the game, don't change the play
You know you were sweet to catch him
To keep him, keep it that way
In the middle of the game, don't change the play
You know you were good to the last drop
Don't stop, keep it that way

You'd better (keep) it that way
You ought to (keep) it that way
You'd better (keep)
You ought to (keep)
Keep it that way
You'd better (keep) it that way
You ought to (keep) it that way
You'd better (keep)
I said (keep)
Keep it that way
Why do they always have to change?
When you're wearing their ring and you're bearing their name?
Woo
Why can't it stay like, when it was new?
'Cause if deserve me, preserve me
I'll be all that I can be to you, oh
Oh, don't change
Oh, don't change, baby
Oh, woo

In the middle of the game, don't change the play
You know you were sweet to catch him
To keep him, keep it that way
In the middle of the game, don't change the play
You know you were good to the last drop
Don't stop, keep it that way

You got to keep it that way
You oughta keep it that way

You gotta keep, keep, keep it that way
