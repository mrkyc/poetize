You are the fire... you are, you are
A burning desire... you are

Burning deep down inside my soul is you
Uncontrollable feelings I have for you
Between the two, they will call us the flame of love
This towering inferno that's burning inside is you, oh yeah

You are the fire, you are the fire (you are, you are)
A burning desire, you are the fire (you are)

This passion of love I have is waiting for you
'Cause no one can make me feel this way, it's true
I'm burning and yearning and burning, what can I do?
To help me control these feelings I have for you... oh, oh

You are the fire, you are the fire (you are, you are)
A burning desire, oh baby, you are the fire (you are)

You are the fire... you are, you are
A burning desire... you are
You are the fire... you are, you are
A burning desire... you are
Burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn
Burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn
