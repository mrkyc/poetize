Okay, okay, grown folks music being played right now
Put the children to bed, alright
This song goes out to all of you that blame every child you ever had on me
I know, 'cause I mean, all these little kids blame Betty Wright
After "Tonight is the Night"

Light up a candle, we got business to handle
It feels like tonight again
Light up a candle, we got business to handle
It feels like tonight again

We've been taking it kinda slow
'Cause we wanna be sure how far we should go, oh
Said I wanna know, 'cause I've been here before

So light up a candle (Hey), we got business to handle (Woo)
It feels like tonight again
Light up a candle, we got business to handle
It feels like tonight again

No, no, no, no, no, I'm not scared this time (I'm not scared)
'Cause I'm a woman and I (I've crossed that line)
But I'm just as excited, mmm
But you can't come in unless you're invited
You might also like
Light up a candle (Hey), we got business to handle (Woo)
It feels like tonight again
Light up a candle (Hey), we got business to handle (Woo)
It feels like tonight again

I ain't actin' shy, so don't go actin' coy
I ain't no little girl, you ain't no little boy
We know what we wanna do, so time's a wastin', boo
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh, oh oh oh oh
Said time's a wastin', oh oh
Here's what I want to do

Light up a candle (Hey), we got business to handle (Woo)
It feels like tonight again
Light up a candle (Hey), we got business to handle (Woo)
It feels like tonight again

Tonight again, tonight again, tonight again, yeah
Woo-ooh, it feels like tonight again, yeah
Ooh, it feels better the second time
Sure feels better the second time
Mmm, don't matter what little Betty Wright says
That was then, this is now, and I say
Sure is better the second time around, yes
A little knowledge that you can't get in college
Lessons that you learn from me, not from the university, no
Ooh, ooh, ooh yeah, ooh ooh
It feels like ooh, ooh, ooh
Feels like ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh yeah
(Light up a candle) Tonight again
(We got business to handle) Tonight again
(Feels like tonight again) Oh oh, it feels like tonight again
Ah, oh, oh, ooh ooh, hoo
(Light up a candle, hey, we got business to handle, woo)
Ooh
(It feels like tonight again)
