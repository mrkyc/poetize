And this could be anyone
You think good loving is love
And you're the one he's thinkin' of
But all he's gotta do is smile
And you're played like a little child
You stay out all night long
And you think you've done nothin' wrong
Soon there'll be no ringin' of your phone
'Cause they don't want you when you're youth is gone
You are a hoe and you don't know
Know everyone in town says so
You are a hoe and you don't know
Feel so sorry for your so-and-so
I've got something on you
See, I've been a girl and a woman too
How will you ever find a love that's true
Lettin' every man do what he wants to do to you
See, you are a hoe and you don't know
Know everyone in town says so
You are a hoe and you don't know
Feel so sorry for your so-and-so
You might also likeNow I wouldn't give no advice to you
That I would not give myself (No)
'Cause I believe in goin' right to the source
Wouldn't tell nobody else (Tell nobody else)
And you're such a sweet girl, if you tell your love
And you tell him what you could be
See, I had to say what was in my heart
'Cause it was killin' me (Killin' me)
Ooh, you're a hoe and you don't know
Feel so sorry for your so-and-so
See, I was tired of Patti tellin' Gail
Doris heard it even in jail
You don't seem to be gettin' any better
So it's better than writin' a letter
I had to say it
Ooh, I had to say it (Had to say it)
Mmm... you're a hoe and you don't know
Everyone in town says so
But God, He still loves you so
He can pick you up off the floor
Then you don't have to be a hoe no more
You're a hoe and you don't know
Everyone in town says so
You're a hoe and you don't know
I feel so sorry for your so and so
But I'm prayin' for you (Prayin' for you)
I'm prayin' for you
'Cause you're my girl (You're my girl)
I love you so
You don't know
I don't wanna her no phone calls
I don't wanna hear from my friends at all
'Cause I already know what they're gonna say
I'm tired (I'm tired) of replay (Of replay)
You're a hoe and you don't know
I'm so tired of 'em sayin' so (I'm so tired of 'em sayin' so)
You're a hoe and you don't know
Feel so sorry for your so-and-so
You don't have to be a hoe no more
You can pick your heart up off the floor
'Cause God, He still does love you so
You don't have to be a, you don't have to be a
You don't have to be a, you don't have to be a hoe
(It's your sister talkin' to ya
Don't get mad, don't get mad)
And I'm prayin' for you
Would you pray for me?
Cause I'm not perfect, see
But right now, just givin' you a little sister love
