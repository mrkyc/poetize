Why
Won't you give your love to me? To me
When you know
That my love could set you free
From the valley of lonely
It took my love to find you
I was standing right behind you
All you had to do was look back
Maybe you've grown tired
And lost all desire
'Cause of the funny way some women act
But this could very well be your day
That God sends a little sunshine your way
Said I could show you how
Better still I could show you now if you just let me
Oh why
Won't you give your love to me, only me
When you know, you know, you know, and I know
That my love could set you free
From the valley of lonely
You might also likeAll women are not the same
You barely know my name
And already, you've judged me by your past
But I'm made from different stock
Not just some new kid on the block
I can help your heart heal real fast
So I'm sending down my lifeline
Baby, all you've got to do is climb
Lift your head to the sky
Don't let love just pass you by
Oh why
Oh, won't you give your love to me? To me
When you know and I know and I know that you know
My love could set you free
From the valley of lonely
I realize some people like being depressed and lonely
But, when I see you I just don't see that kind of person
You know, you look like the kinda guy that likes the finer things in life
That's why I want you to have me
And well if I'm wrong, and you're satisfied with the shape you're in
Hey, that's alright I have no problem with that
Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose
Personally, I'd rather win
I want you to think about it real good, baby, think about it real good
And I don't owe you no tomorrow you know how women are, I might change my mind
You think too long you might think wrong
Said this could very well be your day
That God sends a little sunshine your way
Said I could show you how
Better still I could show you now if you just let me
Ooh, I'm sending down my lifeline
Baby, all you've got to do is climb
Lift your head to the sky
Don't let love just pass you by
Oh why
Won't you give your love to me? Baby, to me
When you know, you know
That my love could set you free
From the valley of lonely
Why, why, baby
Won't you give your love to me? Don't you hear my beggin', baby?
When you know, I know and you know
My love could set you free
From the valley of lonely
Why, oh why
Won't you give your love to me? Only me, only me
When you know and I know and I know that you know
My love could set you free
From the valley of lonely
Why, baby?
You know you want to give you love to me
When you know, when you know, when you know
That my love could just set you free
From that valley of lonely
