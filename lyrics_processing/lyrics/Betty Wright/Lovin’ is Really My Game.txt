I can't catch no man
Hangin' out at a discotheque
But I believe in the boogie
Oh, but the boogie don't believe in me
Well, I got my way of groovin'
Sittin' down right in my seat
I get soul satisfaction
Yeah, without jumpin' up and down on my feet

Whoa-ho, disco guy
You'll be sorry if you pass me by
I've got what you need
Boy, I wouldn't tell you no lie
(No lie, no lie, no lie)
Why not give me a chance
I swear I could prove it
That don't mean I can't move it
And it's close to perfection
I just use it in another direction, yeah

I can't catch no thrill
Though the music they're playin' makes me feel
When all is said and done
Well, now, I know what it's all about
Well, hey, come along with me
If you do I will guarantee
I'm gonna give you my love
And the way it's gonna make you shout, shout, shout, boy
You might also like
Disco guy
You'll be sorry if you pass me by

And boy, I wouldn't tell you no lie
(No lie, no lie, no lie)
Why not give me a chance

That don't mean I can't move it
And it's close to perfection
I just use it in another direction

I can't catch no man
Hangin' out at a discotheque
But I believe in the boogie
