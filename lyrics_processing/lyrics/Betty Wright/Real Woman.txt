This song goes out to all my nephews, sons
Lil' cousins, you know who you are
Mmm
Try to tell you what to look out for
You know I got your back

Get yourself a real woman
So you can be a real man
It's time to stop playing with girls
You need a woman who will understand
Get yourself a real woman
So you can be a real man
It's time to stop playing with girls
You need a woman who will understand

There was a time when I was wildin' out
Hangin' with the crowd, talkin' way too loud
When I think back to my younger days
And my crazy ways that was just a phase
Now, I don't wanna give you wrong advice
But you got one life you can't live it twice
So when you choosing you just take your time
Elevate your mind, good you're gonna find
You might also like
Get yourself a real woman
So you can be a real man
It's time to stop playing with girls
You need a woman who will understand
Get yourself a real woman
So you can be a real man
It's time to stop playing with girls
You need a woman who will understand

You might be stackin' money, mountain high
So they're, gonna try, try to catch your eye
But all that glitters, boy, you know ain't gold
Some would, sell their soul, they're out of control
And I ain't sayin' that they're all the same
But they all got game, I won't call no names
So take my word, I wouldn't lie to you
'Cause I love you, nephew, here's what you gotta do

Get yourself a real woman
So you can be a real man
It's time to stop playing with girls (Stop playing)
You need a woman who will understand
Get yourself a real woman
So you can be a real man
It's time to stop playing with girls (Stop playing)
You need a woman who will understand
I know what you need (You need a woman who will)
I know what you need (You need a woman who will)
When you get tired of playing in the sandbox
Want a woman who'll love you a whole lot
You need, you need, you need - you need a woman who will

No pain, no gain, this life the same thang
Been playin' so many games, gotta find a slow lane
Sooner or later, no later, 'cause when he finally date her
You'll love her or either hate her, regroup or re'bilitate her
These are some real fly words from the wise one
I got my wife in my life, 'cause she's the right one
Better know it, better show it, every time I step in
A real woman make a real man, and this is definite
Yeah

Get yourself a real woman
So you can be a real man
It's time to stop playing with girls (Stop playing)
You need a woman who will understand
Get yourself a real woman
So you can be a real man
It's time to stop playing with girls (Stop playing)
You need a woman who will understand
You need a woman who will, you need a woman who will
You need a woman who will
You need a woman who will, you need a woman who will
You need a woman who will
You need a woman who will, you need a woman who will
You need a woman who will
You need a woman who will, you need a woman who will
You need a woman who will

Yeah, some of y'all just triflin'
Do anything for a little bling bling
Have a degree gold diggin', yeah
That's how you make your million
To all my daughters, the nieces, and my lil' cousins
You know I ain't leavin' you out
'Cause I know some of y'all be tryin the best you can
But listen to this:
If you be a real woman, then you can get a real man
I'm talkin' to you little girls
Tell me, do you understand?
If you be a real woman, then you can get a real man
I'm talkin' to you little girls
Tell me. do you understand?
Tell me, do you understand?
Tell me, tell me do you understand?
All you think about is blowin' up ya whistle
But it goes like this: Use your wisdom
