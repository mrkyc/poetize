I like my bitches hood, but all my whips foreign
Just bought another house, the last one was borin'
Ten-thousand square feet, it feel like you tourin'
You niggas dissin' me? It really ain't important
Take off yo' shirt nigga, I bet yo' ribs showin'
You niggas starvin' ,my money overflowin'
Jewelry game sick, got all these hoes adorin'
Catch me in the club with all the 'gnac pourin'
If I ever go to prison, I'ma have plenty stories
Sleep real good, cause I ain't got no worries
Stay fresh every day, jewelry stay glowin'
I got plenty money, and all you niggas know it

Next month, guess what? I'm buyin' rappers
I'm startin' to feel sorry for you lil' bastards
I'm pretty hot, yo' career a disaster
I control you niggas, somethin' like yo' master
Sixty-five grand, that's 'round the bezel
Stay from 'round me if you don't like to smell cheddar
I ain't fuckin' with that ho cause she a dick hiker
Wanna know who I'm fuckin'? My money, I just married her
She been good to me, I might five-karat her
Ran me out the sto', I bought too many plasmas
Count so much money, breathe like I got asthma
The old sayin is "the mo' money, the merrier"

I don't know why I bought the Bentley when I had the Maserati
What I paid for the goon chain? 140
Scared to keep money on me cause I will blow it
My strip club name is "Mr. Will Throw It"
Keep fire on deck and I will show it
Fuck with me and get whacked and all you niggas know it
Scared to dance in the club cause my fire loaded
If you won't use it, guess what? Then don't tote it
Mo' money to most niggas mean mo' hoeish
Mo' money to me, it mean keep goin'
Haters gettin' tired, my money still growin'
