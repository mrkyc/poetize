I know you caught me cheating and you tired of me lyin
I'mma be honest with you baby, I know I crossed tha line
If you dont wanna fuck with me no mo, than cool, it's fine
But before you go baby can we fuck one more time?

I know I fucked up and sorry ain't what you wanna hear
But I can't change that shit dog it is what it is
You can go fuck another nigga if thats how you feel
If thats goin' to make you feel better than gone do it hell
You asked me about this lil' petty shit and I kept it real
Know that shit probably hard for you to swallow still
I ain't know how bad I hurt you til' I seen ya tears
I ain't asking you to accept how a nigga live
If you feel like another nigga can treat you better, than it is what it is
But let the truth be told it's been my pussy for years
Now you got all ya lil' home girls up in ya ear
Just let's fuck one more time before you dip

I know you caught me cheating and you tired of me lyin
I'mma be honest with you baby, I know I crossed tha line
If you dont wanna fuck with me no mo, than cool, it's fine
But before you go baby can we fuck one more time?
You might also like
I know it's probably best for us to go our seperate ways
Cause I know me I'mma fuck up again anyway
But in my muhfuckin' heart a nigga want you to stay
Cause once you fuck up this shit can never be straight
I'm dead ass wrong thats why I ain't got shit to say
Bet you think a nigga didn't give a fuck anyway
I just had to fuck you good the other day
And how that pussy was bitin I didn't wanna scape
You rode that dick so long until you started to shake
And I can tell when you would nothin' I can see it in ya face
I'mma miss fuckin' you from the back and how I grabbed ya waist
But most of all I'mma miss how that pussy taste

I know you caught me cheating and you tired of me lyin
I'mma be honest with you baby, I know I crossed tha line
If you dont wanna fuck with me no mo, than cool, it's fine
But before you go baby can we fuck one more time?

It ain't another nigga who's goin' to fuck you like I do
You can talk that shit all you want but baby you know it's true
I fucked up, I said "I'm sorry", now it's on you
You can play stupid and give me away if you want too
If you say fuck it it's over then I guess we through
I know if I caught you cheating I'll probably cut you loose
Don't get it fucked up I ain't tryin to tell you what to do
Whatever decision you make, I gotta live with it
But whatever your answer is just make sure you can deal with it
But if we do break up I'mma keep tryin to get it this
Shit we goin' through right now is real silly
Gone cuss me out and let's fuck and gone kill it
I know you caught me cheating and you tired of me lyin
I'mma be honest with you baby, I know I crossed tha line
If you dont wanna fuck with me no mo, than cool, it's fine
