Yo thick thighs and yo pretty eyes got this yougnsta body shakin
Who am I to tell ya you ain't got it goin on
Shakin what yo mama gave ya girl you bout to blow my dome from left to the right to the right to the left
Slow yo road girl, cause this just got to be bad for my health
If I had to sacrifice a body part, I'd go deaf
Long as I can see yo body with my eyes, I don't care
With a coke bottle shape got me pullin out my hair
Man that thang made me dizzy like a ride at the fair
If a bopper wanna to fight, she ain't scared she got a pair
She stand up for her man leave a bopper out of breath
She a dime and she fine and she all of the above
I'm a touch her while I cut her
And beat it up in the tub
