Bad bitches over here
Come her, girl, let me tell me something in your ear
Pockets on full, got a lot of cash
Lil' mama say she wanna kick it, karate class
You can tell I'm a boss, I ain't gotta brag
Hit the mall like a dog, I be poppin' tags
T-Y Dolla $ign, Hurricane Chris
Shoot stick at your chick and I can't miss
Tell the waitress I need more bottles
And pass me some water so I can roll harder
Standin' on a couch in a VIP
Hoes takin' on the clothes, yeah, we got freaks
Got a yellow bone bitch, lookin' hella fine
You ain't talkin' 'bout money, nigga, never mind
Quarter million dollar whip sittin' outside
And when I get in that bed, I be goin' live, yeah

Ay, she pulled up in a new Benz
Lookin' like a dime piece with two friends
And her two friends look too sexy
So deep in the club, need two sections, yeah
Tell her drop it to the floor and act a damn fool
Can you make it wet, wet like a swimming pool?
Gotta have a nice body and a cute face
Pull up in that Maserati lookin' too straight
Everybody in my click get big money
And when I leave, I'ma leave with your woman
Have you ever seen a nigga spend like fifty grand
In the club one night, blowin' money like a fan?
I'm drunk and I ain't gon' lie
Feel like about to faint, but I ain't gon' stop
Ten shots of Patron got a nigga straight wasted
Take it to the head, I ain't even gotta chase it, no
