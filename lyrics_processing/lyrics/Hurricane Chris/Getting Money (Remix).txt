Yeah
Hurricane, I got you
Ms. Wray, talk to 'em
They see us, still I got much to learn
But otherwise, still I got money to burn (Yeah)
I'm in the streets, can't take it out of me
Get money, get money, that's all I know (It's all I know)
They see us, still I got much to learn
But otherwise, still I got money to burn (I got us)
I'm in the streets, can't take it out of me (We can only go as far as we can take us)
Get money, get money, that's all I know (Let's go)

Yeah, stacks on the dresser, pistol under pillow
Breakfast on the stove, crack a cigarillo
Y'all boys pussy, find yourself a dildo
For real, though, no counterfeit for real dough
For real doe, I'm ill, ho, I peel slow, in the wheel-O
And the wheels glow, the tire lips poking out like Lil Moe
The roof playing hide and go seek, so Robert De Niro
And my checks is the only one that call me zero
Yeah, it say, "You are one, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero"
I'm at the bank waiting for the check to clear, ho
And I don't need a yes man 'cause I'm from the N-O

How could you criticize me for actin like I act if I ain't never had a thing
My daddy got locked up when I was 12, my whole life changed
My momma hustled hard and did (?) to get the bills paid
While you was probably ridin around the city in your Escalade
But now that I got money, I went and bought me two mansions
Just to stunt on them niggas who told me I never had it
I walked out the door the other day and my momma told me
You got a lot of nerve, she told me just because we got all this money to burn
Don't think you can't be in terms
A cold victim to the street so I stay packin some heat
Twenty-four hours, seven days of the week, 'cause they creep
Twenty-four hours, seven days of the week, I'm a beast

They see us, still I got much to learn
But otherwise, still I got money to burn

I'm 18 years old and I done seen more drama than that lil' bit
Go on and (?) to talk about it unless you hear this
My pedal to the medal while I'm thinkin about all of my dogs
I lost in the street tryna ball like me
And this is for my niggas who used to roll gold D
Poppin the trunk on them swingers, hoppin out in tall tees
So all my niggas that's ballin and feel like me
From the struggle, you gutter to makin a lot of G
Keep my head up, remember who got me right where I'm at today
Long as I got money I give a damn what a hater say
One thing I know for sure I'ma get paper 'til it ain't no more
Plus I got a crazy flow...huh
I know somebody say "A hard head make a soft ass"
That's why I keep the Glock on the seat when I'm ridin in my jag
51/50, you don't know nothin about me
Homeboy I'm a (?), still ain't learn

They see us, still I got much to learn
But otherwise, still I got money to burn
I'm in the streets, can't take it out of me
Get money, get money, that's all I know

Get money, get money, that's all I know
