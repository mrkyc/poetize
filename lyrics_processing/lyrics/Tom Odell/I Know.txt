Cold hands, white light
Yellow lamps on blackened skies
Duffel hoods and deep brown eyes
I'll sing you a song that I think you'll like
And we'll walk to places we always go
A million faces I don't know
I'll say the words you'd always hope
Set our hearts on racing, even though

I know what you told me
I know that it's all over
And I know I can't keep calling
Every time I run, yeah, I keep on falling
I know what you told me
I know that it's all over
And I know I can't keep calling
It's just every time I run
Yeah, I keep on falling on you

On the way you stand, on the way you sway
The way your hair curls in the rain
The little lines that write your face
Or the winter nights, you'd come and stay
Or the way you hit me when you wanna fight
The way I yearn, the way I cry
The way our love rolls with the tides
But we know we'll make up every time
