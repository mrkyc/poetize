It's a late Friday night
The street lamps are shining
Up in my bedroom
There's a mighty big fight
Between the thunder and lightning
Wonder who will lose
I see a party balloon
And I ain't been invited
Hey, look at that moon
There ain't nothing like it
All grey and gold
Down on Jubilee Road

Can see Mr. Bouvier
In his two-bedroom basement
In his purple dungarees
He's grumpy and he's grey
Always sweeping off the pavement
Cigarettes and leaves
His kid's up in China
His wife's up in Heaven
Always I wave
'Cause he's got this expression
That he's so alone
Down on Jubilee Road

Oh, I think tomorrow night
I will knock on his door and hear all about his life
'Cause I think that's the kind of thing that I might like
When I'm old
When I'm old

There's Max and there's Maude
In the house by the station
Call them my best friends
He drinks like a horse
She don't appreciate it
All this money he seems to spend
I can hear them tonight
He can't find no vocation
The neighbours they sigh
At that new generation
Just getting stoned
Down on Jubilee Road

Oh, I think in the summertime
I will call you up, make everything alright
And we'll fill up our cups with that bitter wine
And I'll show you
I'll show you
The mice are still here
Your wardrobe's still empty
And the walls are still paper thin
And the neighbours, my dear
I think they still hate me
For all these songs I endlessly sing
'Cause it ain't no perfect street
I ain't no perfect lover
Life it is brief
I don't think we get no other
Come back home
Down on Jubilee Road
