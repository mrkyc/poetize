You should look at your reflection
If you wanna see a lie
You're heading in the right direction
If you wanna pick a side
Give me more perfection if you wanna see me cry

Oh, if you wanna love somebody
Oh, if you wanna love somebody
I'm your guy
I'm your guy

You should get your car a starting
If you wanna be apart
Go to the Californian party
If you wanna fuck a star
Or flick back through your memories
If you want a broken heart

Oh, if you wanna love somebody
(If you want to love)
Oh, if you wanna love somebody
(If you want to love)
Oh, if you wanna love somebody
(If you want to)
I'm all yours
I'm, I'm all yours

Lie, oh lie, oh lie
I'll be waiting, oh
Cry, oh cry, oh cry
And I'll be waiting, oh
'Til you decide
You wanna be in love

You really shouldn't let me hold you
If you wanna just pretend
You gotta make your kiss a little colder
If it's ever gonna end
Lay your head upon my shoulder if you just need a friend

Oh, if you wanna love somebody
(If you want to love)
Oh, if you wanna love somebody
(If you want to love)
Oh, if you wanna love somebody
(If you want to)
I'm your man
I'm your man, oh

Lie, oh lie, oh lie
I'll be waiting
Cry, cry, oh cry, oh cry
Yeah, I'll be waiting
'Til you decide
You wanna be in love
You wanna be back in love
You wanna be back in love
Do you wanna be back in love?
