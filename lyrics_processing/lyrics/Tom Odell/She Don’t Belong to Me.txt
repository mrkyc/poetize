My lover wears a t-shirt as she wonders
My lover wears a t-shirt as she wonders
My lover wears a t-shirt as she wonders

My lover wears a t-shirt as she wonders down the lanes
Stepping over cracks with all the words that she could save
As I begin to wonder will I ever be enough
Her hand it slips away from mine along with all her love

I, it's the rythym of her heart
The rhythm of her heart
Rhythm of her heart
Rhythm of her heart

My-y-y how happy we could be
Like a feather blowing in the wind, she don't belong to me
My-y-y how happy we could be
Like a feather blowing in the wind, she don't belong to me

She lets you in her bed at night and keeps you from the cold
No matter how hard you hold her yeah, you always wake alone
Like the sun she lights you up and everyone around
But sure as hell that sun will set she'll always let you down
