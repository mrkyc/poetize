I keep waking at night in the freezing cold
Staring at the shadows coming up the walls
Giving me a feeling I can't define
"Is there anyone there?" I say to the dark
But all I get back is a beating heart
Going out of rhythm and I realize
Oh, something's changed
Oh, something's changed

It's just a silhouette, a flick in the blinds
It's just a mind trick, I don't know why
But it reminds me of someone that I used to know
Oh that I can't forget, it's there every night right beside me
I open my eyes and it reminds me
I should have never let you go

Look up there don't you see her face
That familiar heart, that familiar shape
Giving me a feeling, I can't define
Oh, something's changed
Oh, something's changed

It's just a silhouette, a flick in the blinds
It's just a mind trick, I don't know why
But it reminds me of someone that I used to know
Oh that I can't forget, it's there every night right beside me
I open my eyes and it reminds me
I should have never let you go

I wanna put my arms around you
Tell everyone I found you
But you're just a shadow in my mind
You know you got me so enchanted
Why you gotta be cold hearted
Dancing on your own in that cold streetlight

You're just a silhouette, a flick in the blinds
Just a mind trick, I don't know why
But it reminds me of someone that I used to know
Oh that I can't forget, it's there every night right beside me
I open my eyes and it reminds me
I should have never let you go

Silhouette
Mind trick
Reminds me
Of someone that I used to know
Of someone that I used to know
