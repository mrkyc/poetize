Look, I got hella shit
Take a whiff, peep these molly rocks
I got downers, too
Bought a few, but they still at the spot
Bitch, don't call my bluff
If you want one, then meet me at the crib
You know what it is
Put your phone on off, give your phone to him, okay, cool
Girl, your fro so soft, ooh, look at your friend, tryna be rude
Get put in your place and that's out my place
So please, be nice
All this in your face, you can't get out my face
We know your type

I got hella racks in my safe, got stars in my Wraith
I got stripper hoes snortin' blow, dancin' in my place
I got hella pounds from the plug that I'm 'bout to face
Three 6 Mafia probably fucked yo' mama back in '98 (Woo)
Sippin' on purple rain like champagne
Niggas gon' make a toast
And that weed ain't shit that you passin'
If a nigga don't choke (You know it)
Rolls Royce, I'm flying, sauce is drippin'
Same color as the smoke
Thousand niggas with it in the street
Nigga look like the Pope
(Boss shit, nigga!)

Gilligan lost, turned trill again
Need a vitamin, wait a min'
Better yet, a ritalin for my adrenaline
If I'm up in my feelings, better pay the man
Like motherfuck a middle man
Like I'm the shits with the shits
Fuck another nigga bitch again off the shits again
Island boy like I'm Dominican
On repeat like a ceiling fan
All pink like I'm Killa Cam
Palms, feet and let 'em feel the sand
On the beach like I'm finna tan
Black and proud like the brother man
Make it rain like the weatherman
Bust your head, fuck a settlement
Captain Save and never sell again

Gone off the shit again, that's just how I live
Lost just like Gilligan on my own island
Gone off the shit again, lost just like Gilligan
