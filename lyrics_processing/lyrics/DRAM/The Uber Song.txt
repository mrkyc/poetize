Ain't nothing but a twenty somethin' dollar ride for my baby, my baby
Ain't nothing but a twenty somethin' dollar ride for my boo
Said it ain't nothing but a twenty somethin' dollar ride for my baby, my lady
And in about twenty-somethin' minutes, she'll be coming through

Baby let me get you that Uber
Just so you can come over and chill
I will
And baby when I get you that Uber
Ima watch it as it drive and maneuver, for real
I will

When I hit your line, you seemed surprised
Cause usually when you call I don't reply (I decline)
But I got time today, okay, you crossed my mind
Cause you seem real and plus you chill, that's hard to find
You can find out all the ways I want to do you
Soon as you send the addy, I'ma call this Uber (to you, to you)
Black truck, nothing less, just select
You're the one I select 'cause you're so real you ride the X

Baby let me get you that Uber
Just so you can come over and chill
I will
And baby when I get you that Uber
Ima watch it as it drive and maneuver, for real
I will
You might also like
Me and you, long overdue
How many months? It's been a few
But will we fuck? That's up to you
When you come through, just make a move
Just say the word, when you tryna skrrt
Or I'll call it early if you just tryna flirt
Don't waste my time, cause I rarely have it
I'll call you that Uber, have you in rush hour traffic
Damn!

Baby let me get you that Uber
Just so you can come over and chill
I will
And baby when I get you that Uber
Ima watch it as it drive and maneuver, for real
I will

Ain't nothing but a twenty somethin' dollar ride for my baby, my baby
Ain't nothing but a twenty somethin' dollar ride for my boo
Ain't nothing but a twenty somethin' dollar ride for my baby, my lady
