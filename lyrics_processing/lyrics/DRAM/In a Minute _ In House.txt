Uhh, hey hey


We ain't X and O in a minute
I think I want you to come over, tonight
You say that you are celibate
Well, lets celebrate the first time you
Get this pipe
In a minute, I'll be there
In a minute, she'll grab your hair
In a minute, I'll give your ass a lil slap
In a minute cause I know you like it like that
We ain't X and O in a minute
I think I want you to come over tonight (come over)
And you said you so celibate
Well lets celebrate the first time you
Got this pipe
In a minute, I'll be there
I'ma hit you, I'll grab your hair
My Dicks official, (yeah you know it)
Thats what you said (you know it)
And once I'm in it, girl don't be scared (girl don't be scared)

Give me a minute, I'll work your ass out for a hour
Put that shit on for the tower
She nerdy as fuck like a owl
Tremendous amounts of the power
Suck it up turn on the vacuum (damn)
She sneeze on the dick I'm like "achoo"
I'm so happy that I holla'd at you
No matter fact, bitch you infected me
That was four months ago, but I had to leave
Gotta travel the land and the seven seas
You was wearing your pussy all on your sleeves
You was letting these fuck niggas come and beat
Then you had the epiphany, suddenly
You couldn't go without vitamin D (hell nah)
Before you went back to me
But thats how you end up malnourished
Come get your nutrition
You don't know what the fuck you been missing
I done learned like 8 new positions
I tried to get with me
You already know how it go when we already kissing
Already admit that you miss me
So keep it one hundred and fifty

We ain't X and O in a minute
I think I want you to come over tonight (Come over)
And you say you so celibate
Well, lets celebrate the first time youu
Got this pipe
In a minute, I'll be there
I'ma hit you, grab your hair
My Dicks official (yeah you know it)
Thats what you said (you know it)
And once I'm in it, girl don't be scared
In a minute....
