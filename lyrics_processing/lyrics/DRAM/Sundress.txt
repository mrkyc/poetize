Hey
Uhhh
Walk a little slower baby (alright now)

Look at that girl in the sundress (and how it get stuck between)
Look at that girl in the sundress (damn her walk is mean)
Look at that girl in the sundress (ah, she's all alone)
Look at that girl in the sundress (woman come on home)

Thin materials slightly covered that wagon (that wagon)
Your heart humble but your body is braggin' (is braggin')
If I was smooth as you thought, I would've buttered you up with my charm (my charm)
But I'm so grooved since I lost my cool, I ain't wanna cause emotional harm (hey)

Look at that girl in the sundress (and how it get stuck between )(alright)
Look at that girl in the sundress (damn her walk is mean) (that's right)
Look at that girl in the sundress (ah, she's all alone) (okay)
Look at that girl in the sundress (woman come on home) (hey)

Wife material for the night, that's you (that's you baby girl)
I bet a dollar that you got you a lower back tattoo (I know you're that type girl)
I'm being honest when I say that they say I'm that cool (as the breeze)
She's gonna watch me walk to the point where you pass through (excuse me)
Jeez!

And I said, "Ooh, ooh," I just get excited when I see you pass me by (ooh)
And I said, "Ooh, ooh," then I'm intimidated so just say 'Hi' (ooh, ooh)
And I say, "Ooh, ooh, ooh," I'll cherish the moment you let me between those thighs
And I say, "Ooh, ooh" I know it's a challenge when I look in your eyes
