I must be losing my mind
I get fucked up all the time
I just been losing my mind
Yup I been losing my mind
I must be losing my mind
I get fucked up all the time
Sometimes I just don't know why
I guess it's because I been losing my mind
Mind gone
Mind gone (mumbling)
Mind gone
Mind gone (mumbling)
I must be losing my mind
I get fucked up all the time
Sometimes I just don't know why
I guess it's because I been losing my mind

Forgive me father cuz I told my momma
The only drug I do is marijuana
But that's a lie
I get high like all the time
I'm a double cup specialist
A big fan of Actavis
Ever since my dog had let me sip
Molly took my brain and she left it somewhere
When I find her i'ma grab her by her pretty blonde hair
Rollin in Richmond like wheels on a chair
Wit my cousins and bros it's a family affair
Don't you be stingy nigga
Puff puff and pass the shit
You lucky my mind is gone
Cuz if not I would count your hits
Lord keep me way from these chiefin' ass niggas
I'm losing my mind cuz my bag getting thinner
Fuck eating whoppers i need me a yopper
Wit cheese i had me a double stack for dinner
Orange juice, water too
I don't know what i'm going through
But as soon as find my mind
I'ma do what i'm supposed to do

Yup I been losing my mind
I must be losing my mind
I get fucked up all the time
Sometimes I just don't know why

Mind gone
Mind gone (mumbling)

Said my mind gone and im dead wrong
If you call me right now its no dial tone
Im busy im busy im busy
Cop me some sour i need me a blizzy
Just got off work popped me perc
Wanna see if this girl really do squirt
Know it got real when she took off her shirt
Its just some molly i swear it won't hurt
I swear you might grind i swear you might twerk
Do somethn strange for heezy man and its easy man
Lean on me lean on me
Got the sprite now the rest is history
Getn fucked up ain't no mystery
Whole 8th in the blunt ain't shit to me
I must be losin my mind i must be losin my mind
Rollin up blunts all the time
Know im fucked up but im fine
Lean on me lean on me
Got the sprite now the rest is history
Getn fucked up ain't no mystery
Whole 8th in the blunt ain't shit to me
