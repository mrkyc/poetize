Haha-ha
Would you do, would it do?
Hey, hey
Make no, make a sunny mood, hey

Looking back in my life
You won't shift me, damn, damn
If I called your ass why
That be history
Bitch you remember me

Hey, I'm bout to change my number on you
All 10 digits
You get with it
Shit, I'm bout to change my number on you
You weren't fucking with me
You know, L, shit

I told her lil, need a lil volume
I'm tryna get turned up, shit
She said all we need is a lighter
Tryna get burnt up, bitch please
You know I remember you
Pressed on you since middle school
Even when we got grown
Your shoulder remained cold
You must take me as a fool
Wanna use a nigga like a tool
I say no
Where I'm going you cannot go

Hey, I'm bout to change my number on you

Shit, I'm bout to change my number on you

Woke up this morning feeling good cause I am myself
Look in the mirror like damn, you got a lot of inner wealth
Dropped the motherfucking project
Everybody feeling your shit
"Cha Cha" is apparent
But you got several hits

Hey, I'm bout to change my number on you
All 10 digits
You get with it
Shit, I'm bout to change my number on you
You weren't fucking with me
You know, L

You gon' let me see you in the underwear
Cause you think I'm bout to take you everywhere
Baby you wasn't there when the rest of them cared
Now it's sold out events, twelve dollars is your fare
Chilling in a motherfucking Uber-Uber
Looking for a motherfucking shooter, psh-psh
Not with a gun, with a video cam
Just to show how I move round the city, I'm the man
You don't understand, you don't get, nah nigga
Niggas throwing up and niggas pitching down
It's a slight difference
I got years under my britches
And yeah I'm 28 nigga, I'm 28
I got bitches younger than me that think that they old
And you can suck a dick, I put it in your face
Cause one epic summer greatest story told
Greatest story told cause this shit was true
Nigga I got proof that it weren't a fluke
Bitch, I was dripping juice since middle school
I was called Big Dog since little dude
On the microphone I'm big dog
They knew that since a lil boy
I would treat it like a motherfucking full time job bitch
They'll treat it like a lil toy
Hey, I'm bout to change my number on you
Hey, I'm bout to change my number on you
Hey, I'm bout to change my number on you
