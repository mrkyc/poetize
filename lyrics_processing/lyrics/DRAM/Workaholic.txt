Said I'm a weekend alcoholic
Everyday backwood-aholic
Every night pussy-aholic (I can't give it up)
But I'm a morning alcoholic
Be-there-early-bird-aholic
Change-the-fucking-world-aholic (I can't give it up)
Cause I'm a Wednesday-noon-aholic
Making boss-shit-moves-aholic
Dropping-bombs-on-you-aholic (I can't give it up)
I'm a make-something-aholic
I'm a make-money-aholic
Keep-it-100-aholic (I can't give it up)

Cause 99 and a half won't be enough
You 50/50 niggas 'bout to have it tough
If there's work that needs workin' they gon' call me up
I'ma come up out the Uber then I do my stuff

Cause I'ma worka-worka holic
I'ma fuckin' workaholic
Say I'ma worka-workaholic  (I can't give it up)
Say I'ma worka-workaholic
I'ma fuckin' workaholic
And I'ma worka-workaholic  (I can't give it up)
