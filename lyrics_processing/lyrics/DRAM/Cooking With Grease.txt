It's got you dotting your I's
And crossing your T's
It's got you cleaning your dirt
Before it gets back to me
It's got you dotting your I's
And crossing your T's
It's got you cleaning your dirt
Before it gets back to me

Just when you need some love, just when you need some love
Just when you need some love, just when you need some love
Just when you need some love, just when you need some love
Just when you need some love, when you're in need

I feel used and abused, so I started doing it, too
But I never did it to you, oh no, oh no
So why you do it to me, baby?
Sounds so stupid to me
Ain't it funny how you couldn't be alone (Alone)

It's got you dotting your I's
And crossing your T's
It's got you cleaning your dirt
Before it gets back to me
You might also like
Just when you need some love, just when you need some love
Just when you need some love, just when you need some love
Just when you need some love (Haven't gotten any loving in a long time)
Just when you need some love (And I've been thinking and I want it right now)
Just when you need some love, when you're in need (Haven't gotten any loving in a long time)

So the way I give good loving makes me proud of myself
And I can't be good for nothing, baby, I doubt it myself
Hot sex out of the oven, baby, we're cooking with grease
And next time you need a lil' something, girl, start looking for me

It's got you dotting your I's (Your I's)
And crossing your T's (Your I's)
It's got you cleaning your dirt (Your dirt)
Before it gets back to me (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
It's got you dotting your I's (Your I's)
And crossing your T's (Your I's)
It's got you cleaning your dirt (Your dirt)
Before it gets back to me

Just when you need some love, just when you need some love
Just when you need some love, just when you need some love
Just when you need some love (Haven't gotten any loving in a long time)
Just when you need some love (And I've been thinking and I want it right now)
