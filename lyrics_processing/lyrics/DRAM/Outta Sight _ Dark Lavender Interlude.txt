Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey

If I don't call you that means I ain't tryna be on your shit
Even though I'm on your shit
If I ignore you
Don't take it as me being rude
It's just that I had things to do
I know what it feels like to be annoying
I know, so I know where they be at night, go for it
If I don't text back, shit
It just means that I had something to say
And I ain't want you reading it anyway
Girl you need to relax
You know I fuck with you the long way
So you don't have to call everyday

Just call me a little
Just call me a little bit
Check up on a nigga
Just call me a little
Just call me a little bit
Emphasis on little

Out of sight, out of mind, out of sight, out of mind
I do know that
Out of sight, out of mind, I'm still on your mind
Out of sight, out of mind, out of sight, out of mind
I do know that
Out of sight, out of mind, I'm still on your mind
Out of sight, out of mind, out of sight, out of mind
I do know that
Out of sight, out of mind, I'm still on your mind
Out of sight, out of mind, out of sight, out of mind
I do know that
Out of sight, out of mind, I'm still on your mind

If you don't call me, shit
I'ma turn to petty D.R.A.M
'Cause I'ma think that you moved on
And if you stalk me
It's all good but that's a fact
I'm never gonna call you back

Just call me a little
Just call me a little bit
Check up on a nigga
Just call me a little
Just call me a little bit
Emphasis on little
Out of sight, out of mind, out of sight, out of mind
I do know that
Out of sight, out of mind, I'm still on your mind
Out of sight, out of mind, out of sight, out of mind
I do know that
Out of sight, out of mind, I'm still on your mind
Out of sight, out of mind, out of sight, out of mind
I do know that
Out of sight, out of mind, I'm still on your mind
Out of sight, out of mind, out of sight, out of mind
I do know that
Out of sight, out of mind, I'm still on your mind

I'll be thinkin' 'bout you from time to time
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
Even that lil bit of pudge you got on your tummy
I'll play with it just like a stack of money


This for everybody
It's got a little bit of sauce in it though
You know?
Oh sexy, so sexy
What makes you mad might make me happy
When I'm with her, sad
DRAM: Oo, hello?
Girl: Hey umm, where am I going? Am I going to the studio?
DRAM: Yeah we're still over here
Girl: Okay 'cause we're in traffic right now so we're like I don't
Know like 35 minutes away
DRAM: Okay that's cool we'll still be here
Girl: Okay then I'll see you bye (bye)

Oo it's the truth
I've been playing around skipping around with
Real life, cyber life, and his life
Oh-ohh
It's not quite blue
But it has a similar hue
Dark lavender

Man this Heineken light taste real good
And it's not even ice cold, we gotta fill the ice box
