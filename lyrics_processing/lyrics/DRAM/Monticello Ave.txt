Hey, hey, hey, yeah, yeah hey, hey, oh
Hey, hey, hey, oh, hey, oh
I do remember

Uh, I do remember, girl I do remember
How you said I was your temper, made me feel like a contender
You acknowledge other niggas who you knew was out to get you (that ain't right)
Fuckin' with the camera man and you still ain't get the picture (snapshot)
I can toss a thousand words to you quick band
But I'ma say nothin' 'cause I need you as my kickstand
Tired of all these hoes that be claimin' that they big fans
Soon as I'm in town they blow my line to buy the wristband
All access and bad sex but head fire
Just to do the same to the headliner
Even at my own shows curse by (they do)
Make me miss my old thing, it's still quiet
But we can up the volume for the evening
And I only mean evening, by sunrise you're leavin'
You still ain't my girl, we damn sure ain't friends
So we can cut that whole "How you been?" and "Where you been?"
'Cause that's the end

Girl you know where the fuck I'm at
Bute street, off of Monticello Ave
And girl you know where the fuck I've been
On the road, tryna enlarge my dividends
You might also like
I toss and turn, backwoods got burned
Many nights, contemplate about you
And all the compalinin' I do
About these hoes and how I know they ain't true
I'm still mad at you for the shit you did
But not that mad, so just come to where I'm is
I've text you once but did not send
Erase what's typed, type back again
Indecisive about the very next move
Fool me once, I don't want number two
And I'm still mad at you for not handling biz
But you can still get the biz
So just come to where I'm is
Please 'cause I really just can't take this shit no more
Oh, it seems that I can't win from losin'
All these triflin' hoes hate, I don't know which to be choosin'
Sometimes I turn to you
In the lowest times, when I'm sad and blue
'Cause you know that we got history
So just come to where I'm finna be

Girl you know where the fuck I'm at
Bute street, off of Monticello Ave
And girl you know where the fuck I've been
I'm tryna enlarge my dividends
Girl you know where the fuck I'm at
Off of Monticello Ave
And girl you know where the fuck I've been
On the road, I'm tryna enlarge my dividends
Soon as, you get on the avenue
Move that pretty little ass over
To my room in the back
No words, lay back, relax
Quiet, don't you apologize
Quiet, hush up with all them lies
You in? One night of rough sex
But after I still won't answer your text
Soon as, you get on the avenue
Move that pretty little ass over
To my room in the back
No words, lay back, relax
Quiet, don't you dare apologize
Quiet, hush up with all them lies
You in? One night of rough sex
But after I still won't answer your text
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
I'm on Monticello
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Avenue
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
