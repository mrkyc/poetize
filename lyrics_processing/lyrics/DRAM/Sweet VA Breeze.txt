Oh first time we came in together
Guess we the ones

Feeling cooler than the April breeze
As we blow like the summer leaves
Girl I'm just hanging around
And I'll come back down
When you choose to come visit me now
The crazy thing about my treehouse
It's always me bugging me out
It's all of the beautiful sounds
That keeps my mouth quiet
'Cause me, I be into some loud

One glad morning
I'll be waiting
With my lighter, to blaze (to blaze)
Till that evening
You come over
And let me take you away
Yeah

I come out to the four pops
Singing songs to the trees
So I'm up in the city
Smoke that sweet Virginia breeze
You might also like
Girl it's looking so nice out
Thinking maybe we can step out
And give all the city a stroll
And we can talk about the places where we want to go
'Cause baby I got big dreams
Hollywood and the movie screens
Millions of fans all for me
With cars passing by and me hearing them play my CD

One glad (one glad) morning (morning)
You'll be (you'll be) waiting (waiting)
With your (with your) lighter (lighter) to blaze (to light up)
Till that (till that) evening (evening)
I'll come (I'll come) over (over)
And let you take me away
Yeah

Fuck girl let's get so high that it casts on to the moon
(to the moon babe)
When we get back to daylight we can just keep our mood
All I wish is you'll still be here when I get off tour
When I get back we'll get higher than ever before
Real love, feel love, taste love, smoke love
Real love (real love)
Feel love (feel love)
Taste love (taste love)
Smoke love (smoke love)
Real love, feel love, taste love, smoke love
Real love (real love)
Feel love (feel love)
Taste love (taste love)
Smoke love (smoke love)
Taste love, taste love, smoke love, smoke love
