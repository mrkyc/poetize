This song is a confession with all my second guessin'
At all of my discretion (And all that, and all that)
And all our conversations, and all that time we waited
Before we finally made it (And all that, and all that)
And your cellular phone suspicion and all your fingers hit it
You askin' me 'bout bitches (And all that, and all that)
And all the lacerations and all the aggravation
Girl, listen to what I'm sayin' (And all that...)

All that is worth it if I got you babe, here
All that is worth it if I got you babe, here
All that is worth it if I got you babe, here
All that is worth it if I got you babe
It's worth it if I got you

Fingers crossed, hopin' that she don't scroll too far
Down to see, my little plea for Emily
To lay with me while she was so far away
Why did I leave my phone out? That's a rookie mistake
She love crackin' codes like a kid loves cake
Infiltration in fifteen minutes, I wish my password wasn't my name
That's real nigga shit, now I gotta deal with this bitch
Mouth and her hand submissions
Gotta watch 'cause her stance South Pole position
Plenty swings all missin' 'cause she rather be kissin'
Crazy 'cause it took two months to get it
Probably went through way too much to hit it
But I got it and I'm tryna keep it
Cause we celebrate every weekend
And she polish it every evenin'
Love is a hell'uva drug
But it still rule out my addiction to lust
Every time I leave out she lose a little of trust
Every step that I take it increase the stars
'Cause girl I'll be back when I'm back not givin' a fuck
But I'll be devastated if it's splitin' us up
It's a double-edge sword, a two-sided war
But instead of making peace I still reach for the door, damn
Damn, damn

All that is worth it if I got you babe, here
All that is worth it if I got you babe, here
All that is worth it if I got you babe
