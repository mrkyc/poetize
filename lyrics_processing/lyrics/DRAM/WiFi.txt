Oooh, WiFi, WiFi

Boy
Oooh, WiFi, WiFi
Hey, hey, mmm
Oooh, oooh

Do you got WiFi?
'Cause I ain't got no signal on my phone
We in these Hills and we all alone
Yeah, do you got wifi?
Do your boyfriend pay your bill for you
To do this Netflix and chill with me?
Do you got WiFi?
Is there signal in your house?
While we chillin' on the couch, baby
Do you got wifi?
'Cause I really wanna show you somethin'
But my phone is fuckin' up

And all I need is you with me
And I just wanna impress you, darling
I just wanna make you feel good
I just wanna impress you, darling
So let me know if I could

And it comes at no price at that
Let me know where your iPhone at
To log on my wifi
What is it that you have to show me?
Boy it better be good, please don't blow me
Well answer me this, while it's loading
Do you like my feng shui in my living room?
How the carpet matches the pillows too?
And did you know I was feeling you?
Forget about your wifi for a second
Put your phone down, please don't check it
