Don't wanna hear that stupid melody
The one we used to always keep playing on repeat
'Cause it just takes me to the place when you were mine
Where you laid my body down, and then got drunk on me like wine
Don't wanna feel that bass rattle in my bones
'Cause once I do, I know it won't leave me alone
It haunts me, baby, it does me wrong
But still, I just can't make myself delete it from my phone

That song that we used to make love to
That song that we used to make love to
It kills me, heals me, gets me, thrills me
I know, I shouldn't say it, but I just wanna play it
That song
That we made love to
That we made love to, yeah

I know I'm contradicting everything I said
But I wanna turn it up when I'm lyin' in this bed
Pull the sheets over my head
Drift off dreamin', baby, go on, let it take my breath

That song that we used to make love to
That song that we used to make love to
It kills me, heals me, gets me, thrills me
I know I shouldn't say it, but I just wanna play it
That song (That song, that song)
That we made love to (That song, that song)
That we made love to, yeah
