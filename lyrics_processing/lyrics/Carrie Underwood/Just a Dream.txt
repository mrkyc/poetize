It was two weeks after the day she turned eighteen
All dressed in white, goin' to the church that night
She had his box of letters in the passenger seat
Sixpence in a shoe, somethin' borrowed, somethin' blue

And when the church doors opened up wide
She put her veil down, tryin' to hide the tears
Oh, she just couldn't believe it
She heard the trumpets from the military band
And the flowers fell out of her hands

Baby, why'd you leave me? Why'd you have to go?
I was countin' on forever, now I'll never know
I can't even breathe
It's like I'm lookin' from a distance, standin' in the background
Everybody's sayin' he's not comin' home now
This can't be happenin' to me
This is just a dream

The preacher man said, "Let us bow our heads and pray
Lord, please lift his soul and heal this hurt"
Then the congregation all stood up and sang
The saddest song that she ever heard
And then they handed her a folded-up flag
And she held on to all she had left of him
Oh, and what could have been
And then the guns rang one last shot
And it felt like a bullet in her heart

Baby, why'd you leave me? Why'd you have to go?
I was countin' on forever, now I'll never know
I can't even breathe
It's like I'm lookin' from a distance, standin' in the background
Everybody's sayin' he's not comin' home now
This can't be happenin' to me
This is just a dream

Ooh, baby, why'd you leave me? Why'd you have to go?
I was countin' on forever
Now I'll never know
Oh, I'll never know

It's like I'm lookin' from a distance, standin' in the background
Everybody's sayin' he's not comin' home now
This can't be happenin' to me
This is just a dream
