Mmm

It's two kids flyin' down the hall
In the mornin' into our bedroom
It's a creaky board on the front porch
You swear you're gonna fix it soon
It's a kitchen table where we say our prayers
Give a little thanks to the man upstairs
It's the feelin' I get, baby, when I look at you

It ain't always pretty as a picture, yeah
And it ain't a mansion on a hill
It's perfectly imperfect
It's worth more than it's worth
It's our life, it's our heart, it's our home
This is our kingdom

It's been late nights, a few good fights
Wouldn't sleep until we work things out
It's been long days of leanin' on faith
Even when we had our doubts
Barely gettin' by, stretched to the limits
All the hard times, no, I wouldn't trade a minute
We've come so far, it made us who we are
Right here, right now

This is our kingdom, oh yeah
This is our, this is our kingdom
This is our kingdom

It's our names carved out on that old oak tree
Pictures on the wall of you and me
It's our heart, it's our home, it's our babies faces
It's the light, it's the love livin' in this place
(This is our kingdom) It's church on Sunday, tire swings
Good and the bad times, prayin' on our knees (This is our kingdom)
Thankin' the Lord for this beautiful life
The love we have built will stand the test of time, yeah
Oh, this is our kingdom
This is our kingdom, yeah
This is our kingdom
It's pictures on the wall of you and me
Thankin' the Lord, prayin' on our knees
