Looks like an angel, so picturesque
Looks like she walked right out of the wild, wild west
She's a devil in a satin dress
You don't even know her hair trigger's aimin' right at your chest
By the time you figure out that she gave you the runaround
You won't know where she's at
She's a tumbleweed blowin' in the wind come sundown
Call a girl like that

Renegade runaway
She's a sure shot, knock the ash off a smokin' cigarette
Yeah, that pretty face
Love you, leave you, play you like a heartbreak bandit
She's an outlaw, a quick draw
She'll take it all, so don't you fall
For that renegade
Runaway, runaway, runaway, runaway
You better run away, run away, run away, run away

You'll see her name, alive or dead
Yeah, they'll take her either way cause she's wanted
If I were you, I'd place my bet
That she's ridin' off out into the sunset
With her long hair flyin' 'cross the desert dirt
Let me tell you, boy, you're never gonna catch her
