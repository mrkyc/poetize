I'm not supposed to be thinking 'bout you, lying here in this bed
Too much has gone wrong and we should move on
That's what we both said
There's a million reasons why we said goodbye
Why we couldn't try, couldn't fight for it anymore
Put your ring in the back of the dresser drawer
And we closed that door

So why am I 2 A.M. pickin' up my phone
And you're standin' in my porch light
Backsliding
Wearin' your old t-shirt in the mornin', it feels so right
Backsliding
We say we won't, but then we do
The same old thing, fallin' right back in
Say it's gonna be the last time
Backsliding, I'm backsliding
Backsliding, I'm backsliding

Well, I heard that you've been hangin' around with someone new
Yeah, word gets around in such a small town
Bet you heard I'm seein' someone too
There's a million reasons why we should be happy
Not lookin' back, livin' in the past anymore
But they ain't addin' up, I guess they ain't enough
'Cause here I am

Backsliding, I'm backsliding
Backsliding, I'm backsliding

And we keep pushing, pulling back, sliding
Pushing, pulling, slipping back, sliding
I keep asking myself, keep asking myself
Why do I need you and nobody else?
And if we're not meant to be, then why do we keep backsliding?

And why am I 2 A.M. pickin' up my phone
And you're standin' in my porch light
Backsliding
Wearin' your old t-shirt in the mornin', it feels so right
Backsliding
We say we won't, oh, but then we do
Yeah, the same old thing, fallin' right back in
Say it's gonna be the last time
Backsliding, I'm backsliding
Yeah, yeah
I'm backsliding, yeah
Backsliding
Why do we keep backsliding?
I can't help it, I'm backsliding
I need you, I'm backsliding
Why do we keep backsliding?
