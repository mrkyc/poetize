She's a small-town, hard-workin' woman
Just tryna make a livin'
Workin' three jobs, feeding four little mouths
In a run-down kitchen
When you're never takin' nothin' and doin' nothin' but givin'
It's hard to be a good wife and a good mom and a good Christian

She said, "I don't drink
But sometimes I need a stiff drink
Sippin' from a highball glass
Let the world fade away"
She said, "I don't smoke
But sometimes I need a long drag
Yeah, I know it might sound bad
But sometimes I need a smoke break"

He's a big-city, hard-workin' man just tryna climb the ladder
First generation to go to college instead of drivin' a tractor
Never had nothin' handed to him on a silver platter
It's hard to be a good man, good son
Do somethin' good that matters

He said, "I don't drink
But sometimes I wanna pop that top
Take a swig and make the world stop
And watch it fade away"
He said, "I don't smoke
But sometimes I wanna light it up
Yeah, when things get tough
Sometimes I need a smoke break"
Yeah

I don't drink
But sometimes I need a stiff drink
Sipping from a highball glass
Let the world fade away

But sometimes I need a long drag

But sometimes I need a, sometimes I need a

When the day gets long
When the work's all done
When the sun sets
When you need to forget
Grab that cup, mmm
Fill it up
Sip it slow
And let it all go
