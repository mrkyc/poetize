You better take it from me
That boy is like a disease
You're running, you're trying, you're trying to hide
And you're wonderin' why you can't get free
He's like a curse, he's like a drug
You'll get addicted to his love
You wanna get out, but he's holding you down
'Cause you can't live without one more touch

He's a, a good time cowboy Casanova
Leaning up against the record machine
He looks like a cool drink of water, but he's candy-coated misery
He's the Devil in disguise, a snake with blue eyes
And he only comes out at night
Gives you feelings that you don't wanna fight
You better run for your life

(Oh, oh)
(Oh, oh)
(Oh, oh)

I see that look on your face
You ain't hearin' what I say
So I'll say it again, 'cause I been where you been
And I know how it ends, you can't get away-ay-ay
Don't even look in his eyes
He'll tell you nothing but lies
And you wanna believe, but you won't be deceived
If you listen to me and take my advice

He's a, a good time cowboy Casanova
Leaning up against the record machine
He looks like a cool drink of water, but he's candy-coated misery
He's the Devil in disguise, a snake with blue eyes
And he only comes out at night
Gives you feelings that you don't wanna fight
You better run for your life

Run, run away
Don't let him mess with your mind
He'll tell you anything you wanna hear
He'll break your heart, it's just a matter of time
But just remember
He's a, a good time cowboy Casanova
Leaning up against the record machine
He looks like a cool drink of water, but he's candy-coated misery
He's the Devil in disguise, a snake with blue eyes
And he only comes out at night
Gives you feelings that you don't wanna fight
You better run for your life

(Oh, oh)
Oh, you better run for your life
(Oh, oh)
Oh, you better run for your life
