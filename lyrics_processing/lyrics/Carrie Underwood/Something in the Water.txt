He said, "I've been where you've been before
Down every hallway's a slamming door"
No way out, no one to come and save me
Wasting a life that the Good Lord gave me

Then somebody said what I'm saying to you
Opened my eyes and told me the truth
They said, "Just a little faith, it'll all get better"
So I followed that preacher man down to the river and now I'm

Changed
And now I'm stronger

There must've been something in the water
Oh, there must've been something in the water

And well, I heard what he said and I went on my way
Didn't think about it for a couple of days
Then it hit me like a lightning late one night
I was all out of hope and all out of fight

Couldn't fight back the tears, so I fell on my knees
Saying, "God, if you're there, come and rescue me."
Felt love pouring down from above
Got washed in the water, washed in the blood and now I'm

Changed
And now I'm stronger

There must be something in the water
Oh, there must be something in the water

And now I'm singing along to Amazing Grace
Can't nobody wipe this smile off my face
Got joy in my heart, angels on my side
Thank God almighty, I saw the light
Gonna look ahead, no turning back
Live every day, give it all that I have
Trust in someone bigger than me
Ever since the day that I believed I am
Changed
And now I'm stronger
There must be something in the water (Amazing grace)
Oh, there must be something in the water (How sweet the sound)
Oh, there must be something in the water (That saved a wretch)
Oh, there must be something in the water (Like me)
Oh, yeah

(I once was lost)
I am changed
Stronger
(But now I'm found)
