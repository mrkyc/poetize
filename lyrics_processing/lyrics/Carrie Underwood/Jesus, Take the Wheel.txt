She was drivin' last Friday on the way to Cincinnati
On a snow-white Christmas Eve
Goin' home to see her mama and her daddy
With the baby in the backseat
Fifty miles to go and she was runnin' low
On faith and gasoline
It'd been a long hard year
She had a lot on her mind and she didn't pay attention
She was goin' way too fast
Before she knew it
She was spinnin' on a thin black sheet of glass
She saw both their lives flash before her eyes
She didn't even have time to cry
She was so scared
She threw her hands up in the air

Jesus, take the wheel
Take it from my hands
'Cause I can't do this on my own
I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
Save me from this road I'm on
Jesus, take the wheel

It was still gettin' colder when she made it to the shoulder
And the car came to a stop
She cried when she saw that baby in the backseat
Sleepin' like a rock
And for the first time in a long time
She bowed her head to pray
She said, "I'm sorry for the way
I've been livin' my life
I know I've got to change
So from now on tonight"

"Jesus, take the wheel
Take it from my hands
'Cause I can't do this on my own
I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
Save me from this road I'm on
Oh, Jesus, take the wheel
Oh, I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
Save me from this road I'm on
From this road I'm on
Jesus, take the wheel
Oh, take it, take it from me"
