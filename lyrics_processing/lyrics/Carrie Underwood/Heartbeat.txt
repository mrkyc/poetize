Mm

I love it when we're at a party in a downtown crowd, oh
But I can't hear you call me "Baby" with the music up loud
Red wine, good times, no, I don't mind bein' with everyone else
And then there's nights like tonight that I, I want you to myself

And tonight, I wanna drive so far, we'll only find static on the radio, oh
And we can't see those city lights and I love the way you look in a firefly glow
Sayin' everything without makin' a sound
A cricket choir in the background, underneath a harvest moon
Standin' on your shoes in my bare feet
Dancin' to the rhythm of your heartbeat, oh
And we're dancin' to the rhythm of your heartbeat

I wanna feel it like a kick drum, beatin' faster in your chest
I wanna feel you holdin' onto me and make me hold my breath
You pull me closer, my head on your shoulder
Baby, we won't need a song
We'll make a fallen star wish, one more slow kiss
What are we waitin' on?

Yeah, we're dancin' to the rhythm of your heartbeat (Heartbeat)

I wanna feel it like a kick drum, beatin' faster in your chest

And tonight, I wanna drive so far, we'll only find static on the radio, oh
And we can't see those city lights and I love the way you look in a firefly glow
Sayin' everything without makin' a sound, with the
River rollin' in the background, underneath a harvest moon
Standin' on your shoes in my bare feet
Dancin' to the rhythm of your heartbeat
