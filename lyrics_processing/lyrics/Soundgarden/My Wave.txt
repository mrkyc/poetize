Yeah

Take if you want a slice
If you want a piece
If it feels right
Break if you like the sound
If it gets you up
If it takes you down
Share if it makes you sleep
If it sets you free
If it helps you breathe

Don't come over here, piss on my gate
Save it, just keep it off my wave
Yeah, mm

Cry if you wanna cry
If it helps you see
If it clears your eyes
Hate if you wanna hate
If it keeps you safe
If it makes you brave
Pray if you wanna pray
If you like to kneel
If you like to lay
You might also like
Don't come over here, piss on my gate
Save it, just keep it off my wave

Keep it off my wave
Keep it off my wave, my wave
Keep it off my wave, keep it off my wave
Keep it off my wave, my wave
My wave, my wave, my wave, my wave, my wave

Cry if you wanna cry
If it helps you see
If it clears your eyes
Hate if you wanna hate
If it keeps you safe
If it makes you brave
Take if you want a slice
If you want a piece
If it feels alright

Don't come over here, piss on my gate
Save it, just keep it off my wave
Keep it off my wave
Keep it off my wave, my wave
Keep it off my wave, keep it off my wave
Keep it off my wave, my wave
My wave, my wave, my wave, my wave, yeah
My wave, my wave, my wave, my wave, my wave
Keep it off my wave
Keep it off my wave, my wave

Keep it off my wave
Keep it off my wave
Keep it off my wave
Keep it off my wave
Keep it off, keep it off my wave
Keep it off my wave, my wave (My wave, my wave)
Keep it off my wave
Keep it off my wave
Keep it off my wave (Keep it off my wave)
(Keep it off my wave)
