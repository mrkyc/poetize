Every word I said is what I mean
Every word I said is what I mean
Everything I gave is what I need
Virgin eyes and dirty looks on
What I have and why I took
Counting all the hands I shook

Now I know why you've been shakin'
Now I know why you've been shakin'
Now I know why you've been shakin'
Now I know why you've been shakin'

So bleed your heart out
And there's no more rides for free, yeah
Bleed your heart out
I said, "What's in it for me, yeah?
What's in it for me, yeah?"

Everything I've held is what I've freed
Everything I've held is what I've freed
Everything I've shown is what I feel
Buyin' lies and stealing jokes and
Laughing every time I choke
Biding all the time you took
You might also like
Now I know why you've been taken
Now I know why you've been taken
Now I know why you've been taken
Now I know why you've been taken

So bleed your heart out
There's no more rides for free, yeah
Bleed your heart out
I said, "What's in it for me, yeah?
What's in it for me?"
What's in it for, what's in it for


Every word I said is what I mean
Everything I gave is what I need
Everything I've held is what I've freed
Everything I've shown is what I feel

Virgin eyes and dirty looks on
What I have and why I took
Counting all the hands I shook
Now I know why you've been shakin'
Buyin' lies and stealin' jokes and
Laughing every time I choke
Biding all the time you took
Now I know why you've been taken
Now I know why you've been taken
Now I know why you've been taken
Now I know why you've been taken
Now I know why you've been taken
