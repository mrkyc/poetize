You're that special someone who makes me wanna give in
You're that special someone who makes me wanna give in
You're that special someone who makes me wanna give in
You're that special someone who makes me wanna

Although my heart is closed, my eyes are opened wide
Looking for that magic song to keep me warm inside
I've been so long alone, a wall around my heart
Waiting for that someone
I've been knocked down and out time and time again
So many fools in love who only bring the pain
So many times I thought I'd always be alone
But you're that special someone, someone

You're that special someone who makes me wanna give in
You're that special someone who makes me wanna give in
You're that special someone who makes me wanna give in
You're that special someone who makes me wanna, makes me wanna
You're that special someone who makes me wanna give in
You're that special someone who makes me wanna give in
You're that special someone who makes me wanna give in
You're that special someone who makes me wanna, makes me wanna

So many people in this world will bring me down
But now at last I know that things are coming around
I've been a stranger to the deeper love inside
But you're that special someone
My life's been dancing to the beat of just one heart
I get so close to love, then life will tear us apart
You are my destiny, I've known it from the start
You're that special someone, someone

You're that special someone who makes me wanna give in
You're that special someone who makes me wanna give in
