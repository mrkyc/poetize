Nothing you could say can tear me away from my guy
Nothing you could do, 'cause I'm stuck like glue to my guy

I'm sticking to my guy like a stamp to a letter
Like birds of a feather, we stick together
I'm tellin' you from the start, I can't be torn apart from my guy

Nothing you could do could make me untrue to my guy (My guy)
Nothing you could buy could make me tell a lie to my guy (My guy, my guy, my guy)

I gave my guy my word of honour to be faithful, and I'm gonna
You'd best be believing I won't be deceiving my guy

As a matter of opinion, I think he's tops
My opinion is, he's the cream of the crop
As a matter of taste, to be exact
He's my ideal, as a matter of fact

No muscle-bound man could take my hand from my guy (My guy)
No handsome face could ever take the place of my guy (My guy, my guy, my guy)
