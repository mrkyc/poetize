You might not like my style
We've been hangin' around this town
A little too long this time
You say you're gonna get your act together
Take it out on the road
If I don't get outta here pretty soon
My head's gonna sure explode
Sure, I like country music
And I like mandolins
But right now I need a telecaster
Turn it up on number ten
Let's go to Memphis in the meantime, baby
Memphis in the meantime, girl
I need a little shot of that rhythm, baby
Mixed up with country blues
I wanna trade in these cowboy boots
For some fine Italian shoes
Forget about the mousse and the hairspray, darlin'
We don't need none of that
Just a little ol' dab'll do ya
You poke it underneath your hat
You might also likeUntil hell freeze over
Maybe you can wait that long
But I don't think Ronnie Milsap's
Ever gonna sing this song
Let's go to Memphis in the meantime, baby
Memphis in the meantime, girl
Maybe there's nothin' happenin' there
Maybe something's in the air, oh
Before our upper lips get stiff
Baby, we could use just one more whiff, yeah
If we could just get off-a beat little girl
Maybe we could find the groove
At least we could get ourselves a good meal
Down at the Rendezvous
'Cause one more heartfelt steel guitar
Girl, it's gonna do me in
I need to hear a trumpet and the saxophone
You know it sounds sweet as sin
When we get good and greasy
Baby, we can come back home
Put the cow horns back on the Cadillac
And change the message on the cord-a-phone
Let's go to Memphis in the meantime, baby
Memphis in the meantime, girl
Let's go to Memphis in the meantime, baby
Memphis in the meantime, girl
Let's go to Memphis in the meantime, baby
Let's go to Memphis in the meantime, baby
