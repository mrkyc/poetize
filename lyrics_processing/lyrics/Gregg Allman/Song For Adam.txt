He was alone into his distance, he was deep into his well
I could guess what he was laughing at, but I couldn't really tell
Now the stories told that Adam jumped, but I'm hoping that he fell
Together we went traveling, as we received the call
His destination India, and I had none at all
Oh, I still remember laughing with our backs against the wall
So free of fear, we never thought that one of us might fall
I sit before my only candle, but it's so little light to find my way
Now the story unfolds before my candle
Which is shorter ev'ry hour, as it reaches for the day
But I feel just like a candle, in a way
But I guess I'll get there, I wouldn't say for sure
Wouldn't say for sure
When we parted we were still laughing, as our good-byes were said
And I never heard from him again, as each our lives we lead
Except for once in someone else's letter that I read
Until I heard the sudden word that a friend of mine was dead
I sit before my only candle, like a pilgrim sits before the way
Now his journey appears before my candle
As a song that's growing fainter, the harder I play
But I feel just like a candle, in a way
I guess I'll get there, but I wouldn't say for sure
Ain't say for sure

And when I stood myself behind, I never felt so strong
Still it seems that he stopped singing in the middle of his song
I sit before my only candle, like a pilgrim sits before the way
I'm holding out my only candle
As a song that's growing fainter, the harder I play
But I feel just like a candle, in a way
But I guess I'll get there, but I wouldn't say for sure
Can't say for sure
