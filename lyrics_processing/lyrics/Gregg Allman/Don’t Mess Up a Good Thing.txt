You been cheating on me now
You know I know it's true
There ain't nobody in the whole wide world
Gonna love you like I do

Don't you be no fool (don't you be no fool)
Don't you be no fool (don't you be no fool)
You gonna keep on fooling around now baby
You gonna mess up a good thing
Whoa

Well I might have cheated a little bit baby
Nobody knows like you
When I get my pay check darling
I rush it on home to you

Don't be a fool (don't you be no fool)
Don't be a fool no (don't you be no fool)
You gonna keep on a-messing around now baby
Gonna mess up a good thing

Living away across town

You'll be putting me down

Don't you be no fool (don't you be no fool)
Don't you be no fool (don't you be no fool)
You gonna keep on jiving around now baby
Gonna mess up a good thing
Oh, better listen to what I say now baby


Don't you come sneaking across town baby
Sure catch you doing me wrong
You know, and I know, and all our friends know
We've got a good thing going
Don't you be no fool (don't you be no fool)
Don't you be no fool (don't you be no fool)
You gonna keep on jiving around now baby
Gonna mess up a good thing
