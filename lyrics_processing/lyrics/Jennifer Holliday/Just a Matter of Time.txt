Just a matter of time, baby

Ever since the night I saw you
I've been watching every move that you've been making
Patiently I'm waiting for you
Kept him out every step you've been taking
Boy, I can't take my eyes off you
And I won't be shy  to tell you're mine
After everything that we've been through
I know when love is knocking at my door

I had my share of playing around
I've been through those changes before
Now I think it's time I've found someone in my life
And, baby, it's you

It's just a matter of time (I'm gonna make you mine)
'Til I make you mine
It's just a matter of time
I'll be holding you in my arms
You might also like
Only you can 
Take my heart and make it yours
I guarantee to satisfy
And I'm saving all my love for you
And it's true that I don't know who you are
But I never felt like this before
Was a moment before I could tell
That love is now knocking at my door

I had my share of playing around
I've been through those changes before
Now I think it's time I've found someone in my life
And, baby, it's you

It's just a matter of time (I'm gonna make you mine)
'Til I make you mine
It's just a matter of time
I'll be holding you in my arms


I had my share of playing around

Now I think it's time I've found someone in my life
And, baby, it's you
It's just a matter of time
'Til I make you mine (I'm gonna make you mine)
It's just a matter of time
I'll be holding you in my arms
It's just a matter of time (just a matter of time)
'Til I make you mine (I'm gonna make you mine)
It's just a matter of time
I'll be holding you in my arms
It's just a matter of time (I'm gonna make you mine)
It's just a matter of time (I'll be holding you in my arms)
It's just a matter of time (I'm gonna make you mine)
