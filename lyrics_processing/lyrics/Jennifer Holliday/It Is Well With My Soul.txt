When peace like a river attendeth my way
When sorrows like sea billows roll
Whatever my lot, Thou hast taught me to say
It is well, it is well with my, my soul
When peace like a river attendeth my way
When sorrows like sea billows roll
Whatever my lot, Thou hast taught me, he taught me down on my knees to say
It is well, it is well with my soul

Oh, it is well (It is well)
With my soul (with my soul)
It is well, it is well with my soul

Wait a minute
I believe I testify
You see, back in 1993
The devil tried to destroy me
Put disease in my body
Took all of my money
And let me tell you about Satan
He broke up my happy home
But you know what I did?
I wiped the tears from my eyes
Got down on my knees
And I began to pray
I said, "Our father, which art in Heaven
Hallowed be, hallowed be thy name
Lord have mercy
Thy said Satan, get thee behind me
'cause I am not having it, no
I said Satan, you better run
'Cause it's on between you and me
And I grabbed that old devil
And here's what I did
I hit him three times
I hit one time for the Father
One time for the Son
And one time for the Holy Ghost, well
And I got up off of my knees
And I said, Mr. Devil, I just got one more thing to say to you
I said, Devil, you may have won some of my battles
But the Lord's gonna help me win the war
And I feel like 
Wake my soul
I said "Whoa"
Yes it is
I got the victory
I got the victory
I got the victory, yes I do
Yeah, yeah, yeah
It is well
I can sing
It is well, it is well with my soul
