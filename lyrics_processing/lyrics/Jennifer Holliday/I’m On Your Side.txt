Oh, oh
In the game of love
Sometimes we get left behind
When pushin' comes to shove
And happiness is so hard to find
A fall from love can break your spirit
Paint a rosy outlook blue
Darlin', you don't have to fear it
'Cause, baby, I'm here for you
I'm on your side when times are hard
And you need some understanding
I'm on your side when times gets tough
And no one else can care enough
I'm on your side to be for you
You can, you're free
But sometimes you're the last to know
You can come to me, yes, you can
When some heartache really lays you low
If your lover leaves you cryin'
You don't have t be alone
Call my number, keep on tryin'
'Cause, baby, you know, I'll be home

And you need some understanding
I'm on your side when times gets tough
And no one else can care enough

Mmm, havin' a friend when you come to the end
Makes it easier
(Makes it easier)
Come back to me
I can save you when she tries to tear you apart
(Tear you apart)
I won't break your heart, no
I'm on your side, baby, when times are hard
And you need some understanding
I'm on your side, baby-baby, when times gets tough
And it seems that no one else can care enough
I'm on your side, baby, whenever you need me
You can always count on me, yeah
I'm on your side, yes, I am, you see
I'm on, hey, on your side, hey, hey, hey, yes
I'll be your friend to the very end
I'm on your side, I'm on your side, baby, yes, I am, ooh
Just like a bridge on troubled water
I'm on your side, I'm your side, yeah
I'm on your side
