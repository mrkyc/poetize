You want all my love and my devotion
You want my lovin' soul right on the line
I have no doubt that I can love you forever
The only trouble is you really don't have the time

You've got one night only
One night only
That's all you have to spare
One night only
Let's not pretend to care
One night only
One night only
Come on, big baby, come on
One night only
We only have till dawn

In the morning, this feeling will be gone
It has no chance going on
Something so right has got no chance to live
So let's forget about chances, it's one night I will give
