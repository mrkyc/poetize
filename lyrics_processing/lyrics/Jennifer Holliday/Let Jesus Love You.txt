I never knew love like this before
Love that will last forevermore
There you were, your arms open wide
Then you changed me deep down inside
Your love surpasses all, understanding
In the mist of the storm, you gave me peace
When I'm weak, you make me strong
When I need you, you  my call

Then you came in my life, gave my eyes brand new sight
Now I know what it means to be loved
Then you came in my life, gave my eyes brand new sight
Now I know what it is to be loved

Let Jesus love you
Let Jesus love you
Let Jesus love you
Let Jesus love you

What would I do without your love?
Life would be worthless without your love
You're my all, you're my everything
Give you my life now I praise your name
You might also like
Then you came in my life, gave my eyes brand new sight
Now I know what it means to be loved
You can call on his name, every day he's the same
He's the one who takes care of my needs

Let Jesus love you
Let Jesus love you
Let Jesus love you
Let Jesus love you

Then you came in my life, gave my eyes brand new sight
Now I know what it means to be loved
You can call on his name, every day he's the same
He's the one who takes care of my needs

Let Jesus love you
Let Jesus love you
Let Jesus love you
Let Jesus love you
Let Jesus love you
Let Jesus love you
Let Jesus love you
Let Jesus love you
Let Jesus love you
Let Jesus love you
Let Jesus love you
Let Jesus love you

Then you came in my life, gave my eyes brand new sight
Now I know what it means to be loved
You can call on his name, every day he's the same
He's the one who takes care of my needs
