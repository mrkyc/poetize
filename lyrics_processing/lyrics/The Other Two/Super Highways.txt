I know them, I already know them
Sing me all your sad lullabies
While I cry, together let's cry
When those children meet again
Does any trace remain?
Along the super highways of July
Tears of goodbye
Give me anything you want
We have everything we need
A loser to the ones above
Who know that once you don't, you don't give up
Take me to the places you've been
In whispers only for me
Show me all the faces you've seen
Paint me pictures on a screen
Now I find us both again
Is it all in vain?
With someone else's paper words to say
About the past replaced
Give me anything you want
We have everything we need
A loser to the ones above
Who know that once you don't, you don't succeed
You can always lose again
Just a loser in the game
And in the name of love
You play it forever and ever, give it up
You might also likeLet us cry like cheated lovers
Let's end and let's begin
Stack the cards against ourselves
Play to never win
There are times I think I'm almost happy
I think I'm free
There's peace and no, there's peace and no
Expectations
Give me anything you want
We have everything we need
A loser to the ones above
A loser in this game of love
You can always lose again
Just a loser in this game
And in the name of love
You play it forever and ever, give it up
Give me anything you want
We have everything we need
A loser to the ones above
A loser in this game of love
You can always lose again
Just a loser in this game
And in the name of love
You play it forever and ever, give it up
Give me anything you want
We have everything we need
A loser to the ones above
