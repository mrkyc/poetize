I don't know why the first thing I do
Whenever somebody asks about you
I smile and say, "Sorry this will take a while"
'Cause truth is that I don't know where to start
Sum it up, all of the things that you are to me
No it ain't easy
No matter what I say, I wish it was more
'Cause baby you're

Wild as a Wyoming rodeo sky
Strong as tequila on a Saturday night
Quiet as a kiss on a front porch swing
Loud as a song everybody sings
And baby I could talk 'til I'm out of breath
And there'd be so much still left unsaid
I know I never will but I'm pretty sure
You'd be the best thing I'd ever heard
If I could put you into words
Put you into words

They say a picture's worth a thousand of 'em
But I'd need a million pictures
'Cause your love is like sand on a beach
The way you crash into me, yeah
You might also like
Wild as a Wyoming rodeo sky
Strong as tequila on a Saturday night
Quiet as a kiss on a front porch swing
Loud as a song everybody sings
And baby I could talk 'til I'm out of breath
And there'd be so much still left unsaid
I know I never will but I'm pretty sure
You'd be the best thing I'd ever heard
If I could put you into words
Put you into words
Put you into words
Put you into words, yeah

Breathless
That's how I get around you
Restless
That's how I sleep without you
Crazy
That's how I am about you
Baby all I know is that you're

Wild as a Wyoming rodeo sky
Strong as tequila on a Saturday night
Quiet as a kiss on a front porch swing
Loud as a song everybody sings
And baby I could talk 'til I'm out of breath
And there'd be so much still left unsaid
I know I never will but I'm pretty sure
You'd be the best thing I'd ever heard
If I could put you into words
Put you into words
Put you into words
Put you into words, yeah
Put you into words
Put you into words
Put you into words
