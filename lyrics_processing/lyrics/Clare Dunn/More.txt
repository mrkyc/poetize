Dashboard jukebox all night long
Kisses in the dark, mmh
More Sunday drives with the windows dropped
Making country miles out of city blocks
Middle seat in your arms, yeah
More hours in the day
More time that I could stay
Closest I could get to you
More than my words could ever say it
More than you know you were worth the waitin'
I couldn't be more sure
That I couldn't love you, couldn't love you
More than I do right in this moment
More that I live, all that I know is
Now and forever, no one's ever
Gonna love, gonna love, gonna love
Gonna love you more (No one)
Gonna love, gonna love, gonna love
Gonna love you more (No one)
Gonna love you more
More good red wine in a paper cup
Hangin' on the couch, baby stayin' up
Doesn't matter what movie's on, yeah
More dancin' shadows on a bedroom wall
Lettin' everything fall where it falls
Takin' all night long, yeah
