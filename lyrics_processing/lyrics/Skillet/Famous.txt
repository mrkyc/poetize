I testify
This is not a secret meant to keep
Your love, like fire
Spreading from my heart straight to my feet

And when I was dead, you gave me new life
I'm lifting you up with all of my might
I don't care who's to the left, to the right
You're all that's on my mind
Don't really care what they say, what they think
I feel so alive

I'm unashamed, I'm wide awake
Not gonna hide, can't deny you're my everything
Here's to the free who still believe
You're the star of the show that we came to see
With all my heart, all my life, gonna live it loud
I wanna make, make you famous
Light up the night, let it shine, never burning out
I wanna make, make you famous

(Fame, fame, fame, fame, f-famous)
(Fame, fame, fame, fame, f-famous)
