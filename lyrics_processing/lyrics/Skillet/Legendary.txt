My heart bleeds adrenaline
The fire I breathe is where I live
Say my name, incredible
Say my name, an animal
One life to live
I never give up, I never give in

Some people wanna turn and run
But the strong rise under the gun

Top, to the top
Ain't never gonna stop
To the top, to the top
Ain't never gonna stop

Never gonna keep me down (Never keep me)

Fly high or will I fall?
Legends made when faith is strong
Say my name, no time to plead
Say my name, I'm conquering
While I'm alive, I'll push through the pain, I'll run for the prize

Some people wanna turn and run
But the strong rise under the gun

Top, to the top
Ain't never gonna stop
To the top, to the top
Ain't never gonna stop
Never gonna keep me down (Never keep me)
Still the one that's standin' now (I'm never falling)

Wings are made to fly, made to fly
Fears are born to die, born to die
Pushin' through the pain, through the pain
Pushin' through, breakin' through
Whatever it takes, what I gotta do
Givin' my all, givin' all that I've got
Never will stop 'til I get to the top
Top, to the top
Ain't never gonna stop
To the top, to the top
Ain't never gonna stop

Never gonna keep me down (Never keep me)
Still the one that's standin' now (I'm never falling)
Destiny is callin' me, go down in history
Every day, I'll fight to be legendary
Never gonna keep me down (Never keep me)
Oh, oh, oh
