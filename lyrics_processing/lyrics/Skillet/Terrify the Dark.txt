No power on Earth, no power in Hell
Is gonna steal my peace
Ten thousand enemies, they will
End up on their knees
When I'm hopeless, I can know this, You're with me

Your light will terrify the dark
I call upon the name
That tears the night apart
My doubt will answer to Your scars
And fear will have no place
No hold upon my heart

Your light will terrify the dark (Your light will terrify the dark)
Your light will terrify the dark (Your light will terrify the dark)

Where could I run? Where could I hide?
You're breaking in on me
Restore the ruins of my life
From rags to royalty
I can see You, I believe You, I trust You

I call upon the name
That tears the night apart
My doubt will answer to Your scars
And fear will have no place
No hold upon my heart

Your light will terrify the dark (Your light will terrify the dark)
Your light will terrify the dark (Your light will terrify the dark)

Break in on me 'til all I see is You, is You
Break in on me 'cause all I need is You, is You

Your light will terrify the dark (Your light will terrify the dark)
Your light will terrify the dark (Your light will terrify)
