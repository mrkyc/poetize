Rise up, rise up just like a fighter
Rise up, rise up

No way, never gonna bow to your hate
You can't pull me under
Stand proud, say it like you mean it
Shout out with voices like thunder

Slap in the face, you put me away
I'll stay in the game, I'll finish the race
Giving my all, my heart and my soul
You can't control
Love's gonna be a battle cry
So hear me

Rise up, rise up just like a fighter
We will rise again
Rise up, rise up, we got the fire
Burnin' to the end
No fear, no death tonight
I'm feelin' so alive
Rise up, rise up, we got the fire
We will rise (Rise), we will rise again
