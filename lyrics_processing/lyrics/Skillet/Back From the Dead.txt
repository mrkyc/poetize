Cold and black inside this coffin
Cause you all try to keep me down
How it feels to be forgotten
But you'll never forget me now

Enemies clawing at my eyes, I
Scratch and bleed, just to stay alive, yeah
The zombies come out at night
They'll never catch me
They'll never catch me
B-ba-b-b-b-ba-ba-back
B-ba-b-b-b-ba-ba-back

Light it up, light it up, now I'm burning
Feel the rush, feel the rush of adrenaline
We are young, we are strong, we will rise
Cause I'm back, back, back from the dead tonight
To the floor, to the floor, hit the red line
Flying high, flying high at the speed of light
Full of love, full of light, full of fight
Cause I'm back, back, back from the dead tonight

Break the skin, you spread like poison
Dying slow when we all attack
How it feels to be the broken
You took a piece, now I'm biting back

Enemies clawing at my eyes, I
Scratch and bleed, just to stay alive, yeah

Cause I'm back, back, back from the dead tonight
Back, back, back from the dead tonight
Deep down, for the count
Don't you dare count me out
Never break, never bow
Never beg, not a doubt

They'll never catch me
