The walls between (The walls between)
You and I (You and I)
Always pushing us apart, nothing left but scars, fight after fight
The space between (The space between)
Our calm and rage (Rage)
Started growing shorter, disappearing slowly day after day

I was sitting there waiting in my room for you
You were waiting for me too
And it makes me wonder

The older I get
Will I get over it?
It's been way too long for the times we missed
I didn't know then it would hurt like this, but I think
The older I get
Maybe I'll get over it
It's been way too long for the times we missed
I can't believe it still hurts like this

The time between (The time between)
Those cutting words (Words)
Built up our defenses, never made no sense, it just made me hurt
Do you believe (Do you believe?)
That time heals all wounds? (All wounds)
It started getting better, but it's easy not to fight when I'm not with you (You)

It's been way too long for the times we missed
I didn't know then it would hurt like this, but I think

It's been way too long for the times we missed
I can't believe it still hurts like this

What was I waiting for? (What was I waiting more)
I should've taken less and given you more
I should've weathered the storm
I need to say so bad
What were you waiting for? (What were you waiting for?)
This could have been the best we ever had
(Oh!)

The older I get
Will I get over it?
It's been way too long for the times we missed
I didn't know then it would hurt like this, but I think
The older I get
Maybe I'll get over it
It's been way too long for the times we missed
I can't believe it still hurts like this!
Hurts like this!
I'm just getting older
I'm not getting over you
I'm trying to
Wish it didn't hurt like this
It's been way too long for the times we missed
