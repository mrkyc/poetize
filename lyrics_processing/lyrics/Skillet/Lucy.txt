Hey, Lucy, I remember your name
I left a dozen roses on your grave today
I'm in the grass on my knees, wipe the leaves away
I just came to talk for a while
Got some things I need to say

Now that it's over
I just want to hold her
I'd give up all the world to see
That little piece of Heaven lookin' back at me
Now that it's over
I just want to hold her
I've got to live with the choices I made
And I can't live with myself today

Hey Lucy, I remembered your birthday
They said it'd bring some closure to say your name
I know I'd do it all different if I had the chance
But all I got are these roses to give
And they can't help me make amends!

Now that it's over
I just want to hold her
I'd give up all the world to see
That little piece of Heaven lookin' back at me
Now that it's over
I just want to hold her
I've got to live with the choices I made
And I can't live with myself today
