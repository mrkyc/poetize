My feet were made to march like thunder
My lips to praise in awe and wonder
My hands hold power and my lungs breath fire
Holy Spirit fire, Holy Spirit fire

All on your love I stand
Because of who You are
I know who I am

Wherever I will go
Wherever You will lead
I never walk alone
Your spirit is with me
Oh, You're with me as I go
So I will not be afraid
You call me to be brave
In You, in You
Brave
In You
You call me to be brave

No height, no depth, no fear can shake me
Held firm, Your hands will never fail me
I won't lose strength, for Your strength is mine
You will be my light through the darkest night
