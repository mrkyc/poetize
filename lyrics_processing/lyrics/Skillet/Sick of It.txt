If you're sick, if you're sick, if you're sick
If you're sick of it
If you're sick, if you're sick, if you're sick
If you're sick of it!
When everything you do
Don't seem to matter
You try but it's no use
Your world is getting blacker
When every time you fail
Has no answer
Every empty promise made
Is a reminder
No one can make this better
Take control, it's now or never!
Are you sick of it?
Raise your hands
Get rid of it!
While there's a fighting chance
Are you over it?
Bored to death?
Have you had enough regret?
Take a stand, raise your hands

Every single day
I chase my own tail
Like a rat inside a maze
Got to get, got to get, get away
I'm running out of time
For me to break this
I'm tired of feeling like
I'm never going to make it
No one can make this better
Take control, it's now or never!

Raise your hands
Get rid of it!

I'm tired of it
I'm over it
I'm bored of it
Got to fix this
I'm sick of it!
