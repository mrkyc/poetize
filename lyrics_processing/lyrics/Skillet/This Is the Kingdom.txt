This is the kingdom, kingdom
This is the kingdom, kingdom

Everybody's building empires
Building walls high in the name of glory
Everybody's hanging high wires
It's a fine line, it's an age-old story

The first will be last
And the last will be kings
The small will be great
And the great will be weak
Everybody's building empires
But it's our time

This is the kingdom
Heaven coming down to the corners of the Earth
This is the kingdom
Come alive in us, gonna light up this whole world
This is for freedom, freedom
To break off every chain
This is the kingdom

And the last will be kings
The small will be great
And the great will be weak

This is the kingdom
Heaven coming down to the corners of the Earth
This is the kingdom
Come alive in us, gonna light up this whole world
This is for freedom, freedom
To break off every chain
This is the kingdom

Forever (Forever), forever (Forever)
Everything else is gonna fade away
It stands forever (Forever), forever (Forever)
Everything else is gonna fade away
We stand together, together
One heart, one voice, one name
It stands forever (Forever), forever (Forever)
