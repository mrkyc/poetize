Guess I should show you round
Where once I was a King, and now I am a clown
The love that we once shared, made a King of me
But now you're gone, but now you're gone
All I face is poverty
King without a heart, King without a hope
King without a woman baby
Oh, I'm a King without a crown
King without a heart, King without a hope
King without a woman baby
Oh, I'm a King without a crown
Hell hath no fury (Hell hath no fury)
Like a woman scorned (Like a woman scorned)
But heaven don't boast, no heaven don't boast
The jewel, the pretty jewel I just pawned (I just pawned)
Every cloud has a silver lining (Every dog has its day)
Oh, but I guess the sun stopped shining (shining, shining)
On the day you went away
King without a heart, King without a hope
King without a woman baby
Oh, I'm a King without a crown
King without a heart, King without a hope
King without a woman baby
Oh, I'm a King without a crown
King without a heart, King without a hope
King without a woman baby
Yes, I'm a King (King), King without a crown

How do I get to tell my story
When all get's your answerphone, but you ain't home
With the love you gave, I felt like royalty
But now you're face to face, face to face
With one ex-member of the aristocracy
King without a heart, King without a hope
King without a woman, baby
Oh, I'm a King without a crown
King without a heart, King without a hope
King without a woman, baby
Oh, I'm a King without a crown
King without a heart, King without a hope
King without a woman, baby
Yes, I'm a King (King), King without a crown
There's no need to feel down
Yeah, just take a look around
You'll see a man who's just a man, nothing more
