We've been at this point time and time over again
I see there's no making you understand
No, I don't wanna pretend
Cause we know it's the end
This won't be easy
But I'm gonna be okay
You can bet I'm gonna find my way
No I don't wanna make a try to change
We both know that so why, should we stay
I'm gonna fix it today
There ain't no you
There ain't no us
There ain't no maybe someday
There ain't no love
There ain't no trust
This time I'm gettin' it my way
There ain't no right
There ain't no wrong
There ain't no words left to say
There ain't no turn
The thing is were done
This time I'm gettin' it my way

Eh eh this time I'm gettin' it my way my way
Eh eh my may
Eh eh this time I'm gettin' it my way
It's only right to do what's best for me
And the last thing I want us to be is enemies... yeah
That dot our I's and cross our final t's
No matter how it hurts you
If we can't make it work, let's part ways in peace
But I'm gonna be okay
You can bet I'm gonna find my way
No I don't wanna make a try to change
We both know that so why, should we stay
I'm gonna fix it today
There ain't no you
There ain't no us
There ain't no maybe someday
There ain't no love
There ain't no trust
This time I'm gettin' it my way
There ain't no right
There ain't no wrong
There ain't no words left to say
There ain't no turn
The thing is were done
This time I'm gettin' it my way
Were on the same page so
I gotta do it my way
I took all I can take as much as I waited
Really can't hate it
I'm so ready to start over
And brush the past off my shoulder
And to take my last years
Get back what I missed
After doin' things I'm gonna do it my way
There ain't no you
There ain't no us
There ain't no maybe someday
There ain't no love
There ain't no trust
This time I'm gettin' it my way
There ain't no right
There ain't no wrong
There ain't no words left to say
There ain't no turn
The thing is were done
This time I'm gettin' it my way
Ehehe my way... ehehe... this time I'm gettin' it my way
Ehehe my way... ehehe... this time I'm gettin' it my way
