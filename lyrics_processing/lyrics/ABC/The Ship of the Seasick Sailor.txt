Running to the empty spaces
Of a love that we once shared
In between the lipstick traces
To a time that we once had

You mistook me for a man, that I once knew
You caught me unprepared
That's why on the tide of an ocean of failure
An ocean of love in my heart

Bring me the ship of the seasick sailor
Bring me the keys of the sleeping jailor
Bring me the guns of the war torn soldier
Bury the flag slung over his shoulder
Maybe you could love me again
Maybe you could love me again
Then and only then
Because it hurts to be your friend

I've been to all the lonely places
We fought once to defend
I'd hate to be your enemy
Because it hurts to be your friend
You might also like
You mistook me for a man, that I once knew
You caught me unprepared
That's why on the tide of an ocean of failure
An ocean of love in my heart

Bring me the ship of the seasick sailor
Bring me the keys of the sleeping jailor
Bring me the guns of the war torn soldier
Bury the flag slung over his shoulder
Maybe you could love me again
Maybe you could love me again
Then and only then
Because it hurts to be your friend

The sea is calm
The door is locked
We're safe from harm
The ship is docked
The battle's over
The war is won
Screen fades to black
In a setting sun
Bring me the ship of the seasick sailor
Bring me the keys of the sleeping jailor
Bring me the guns of the war torn soldier
Bury the flag slung over his shoulder
Maybe you could love me again (All I can do is ... Love)
Maybe you could love me again (All I can do is ... Love)
Then and only then
