You can tell me drugs you're using
You're talking loud and saying nothing
Walking proud and going nowhere fast, you know
If you could tell me how to find belief
If you told me, I'd believe you'd
Speak no evil, hear no evil, see no evil
I'll close my eyes, you know love grows
4 ever 2 gether for years to come
For love too strong for us to part
4 ever 2 gether for years to come
For love too strong for us to part
I stuck a marriage proposal in the waste disposal
If that's the trash aesthetic, I'd suggest that we forget it
Your 12 disciples might kiss and tell
But you can tell me much more than they can right now
A mathematical equation won't describe my liaison
The stars in the sky might try persuading
But you can tell me, I won't hear you
You can tell me, I gave up the listening years ago
4 ever 2 gether for years to come
For love too strong for us to part
4 ever 2 gether for years to come
For love too strong for us to part

I got something new on the agenda
Speak no, speak no, speak no evil
4 ever 2 gether for years to come
For love too strong for us to part
For when two hearts beat strong and sweet
One promise I can never meet
Forgive and forget for goodness sake
For love is strong, might make or break
4 ever 2 gether for years to come
For love too strong for us to part
Two's a party, three's a crowd
I'm surprised what gets allowed
Three coins inside the fountain
You saw Mohammed move the mountain
Speak no evil
Speak no evil
Yours sincerely, how nearly
Yours faithfully, we'll eventually
Speak no evil
