Made myself a prisoner
I locked myself away
I can't remember the last time
I saw the light of day
Don't wanna face life
Feel I've been betrayed
I want you to tell me
Where our love went astray

So can't you wait one more minute
Why can't you wait one more day?
Let's get it straight
'Cause it's a big mistake
You better think about it

I don't wanna break it up
Why do we have to break it up?
Never ever wanna break it up, oh no
I only wanna make it up tonight

You say you've thought about it
But you sound so cold
You make it look like our love
Can be bought or sold
You won't listen
You say it's way too late
That something is missing
And now you just can't wait

Why can't you wait one more minute?
Why can't you wait? Gimme more day
Let's get it straight
This is a big mistake
We better think about it

I don't wanna break it up
Why do we have to break it up?
Never ever wanna break it up, oh no
I only wanna make it up tonight
So don't say break it up (Break it up)
I wanna hear you say we'll make it up (Make it up)
I don't wanna break it up, ooh baby
Why can't we make it up tonight? (Make it up tonight)
Make it up tonight

And I ask myself
What's wrong with me?
How could I be so blind?
I know she tried to give me everything
I still couldn't see
Now as I watch our love slip away
I'm begging you, begging you, please
Don't break it up (Break it up)
Take a little time and make it up (Make it up)
I don't wanna break it up, oh no
I only wanna make it up tonight

I don't wanna break it up
Baby, let me make it up
No, no, no, no
I don't wanna break it up, no, no, tonight
Make it up, let me make it up, oh yeah
