Well, there's something inside that tells me
I got to fight or let you go
I'm not taking this life, yeah
If you want we can take it slow
Because there's one thing missing in my life
You and I know we need a change
Got to try, got to get it alright this time
And this love could be good again
I will give you all I can to show you I'm your man
It would mean the world to me if you'd understand
Give me a sign and let me know
If you going to stay and tell me so
Should I try to hang on or maybe let go?
Yeah, you got to give me a sign, give me a sign
Well, there is no use in pretending
Because I got no secrets to hide
I'll be true to you till the end, girl
I need you right here by my side
I'll always give you all I can
To show you I'm your man
You know you mean the world to me
If only you could understand

Give me a sign, better let me know
If you going to stay and tell me so
Should I try to hold on or maybe let go?
Yeah, you got to give me a sign, give it to me
