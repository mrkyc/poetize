Look!
Man tonight I'm on my southern playalistic/
Paint is still drippin' on my Chevy as I'm speeding through the back woods of Memphis/
And I'm with a Goddess with a body out of senses/
She insisting I come over cause she knows I'm leaving Wednesday/
Slow, loud and banging I was blasting out the tunes/
Then a nigga played some Marvin just to get her in the mood/
Young fly nigga with charisma and a smile/
If your man is acting up ladies you know who dial/
I'm just on my grind, really I ain't lying/
Shady records told a nigga it was all in proper time/
Was always motivated but I feel rejuvenated/
Cause the dream that I been chasing hasn't been a waste of time/
I'm knowing imma shine, you can bet the house nigga/
Complexion might be light but I don't think like house niggas/
If homie cross my fam I'm thinking how to out a nigga/
Now these women wanna stay but now in kick out bitches/
You a fag nigga, my team is taking over/
When I'm on a beat I kill it like how I'm suppose ta/
Ice will even tell ya that this nigga swag is colder/
Pin your girl up on the wall now how is that for a poster/
Nets is out to Brooklyn, I'm on my Jersey devil shit/
Nigga be so icy when I skate in that Prudential bitch/
Kid was man made but this flow is fucking heaven sent/
Baby I'm the man and your mans is just irrelevant/
Gave them ample time for them to get their shit together/
Feeling like Ross tryin' to be a rich forever/
Freaky girl telling me that she can suck it better/
I be tryin' to play it cool but she knows that I'mma let her/
They hoping for the better, I bring it to fruition/
Ask me how it started and I tell them with a vision/
Told them I was coming, they ain't wanna pay attention/
And the mind state of winners is to kill the competition/
Fast cars and vixens, homie this the life/
You know that you a boss when you don't have to say it twice/
Heart what's make a man and bitches come in every size/
If she get wetter than a flood then I'mma lay her with a the pipe/
Death before dishonor is the morals I abide/
I'm swallowing my blood before I'm swallowing my pride/
If I don't make it to the top, then I would rather me to die/
Real niggas in my circle, me and lames don't coincide/
Y'all niggas out here stupid let me school you some advice/
You wanna be a player, you never get caught twice/
Not a bird, she was your wife/
You're suppose to treat her right/
And make your moves discreet while you in the public's eye/

I lost a couple friends to over petty shit and bitches/
I'm glad that I did, found out who was my niggas/
And all we really got is memories and all the pictures/
And my momma keep on telling me to please read my scriptures/
Anything is possible you cannot tell me differ/
At the point of no return, you held me down I won't forget ya/
The best that I can be is that man up in the mirror/
And I'll kill whose on the list, I'm the opposite is Schindler/
So be easy lil nigga, I said the time is me lil nigga/
Team d4g lil nigga, turn it up through your speakers lil nigga/
Chorus
Becoming legendary, being cuffed can wait a while/
I'm on my grind homie, trying to make my paper pile/
I tell these bad bitches get comfy and stay awhile/
I complimented on her style that made her smile/
X2
We destined great/ x 2
Even my momma say destined for great/ x 2
We destined great/
There's a lotta people smiling and most of them hate/
Even my momma say destined for great/ x 2
