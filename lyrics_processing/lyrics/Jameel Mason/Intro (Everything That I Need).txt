The world is cold and I travel a lonely road/
And my heart is heavy, I need somewhere to unload/
I'm reaching out to God ask him help me out with the lows/
He said you got the book, now just read it and crack the code/
Oh!
I go to church I swear it hurts to hear the preacher speak/
Now all the people in this service, why I feel he talk to me/
My poppa died before I came a man/
And at times I feel like he's the only one who ever understands/
Damn!
I'm asking Lord do you hear me/
Please Lord, holla if you hear me/
This shit depressing, need to balance out my mental state/
I drink a fifth of Hennessy only to ease to pain/
What will I gain from giving up, I came along way/
If I don't make it, then life lessons it taught me/
To make it to the top, you gotta plan accordingly/
D4G just becoming the man I'm born to be/

No it's not what I wanted but everything that I need/

Verse 2:
My family always tell me right, I know that they supposed ta/
Seem like every time we fight it only brings us closer/
And we only get one life, I gotta make the most of/
I would tell you bring a knife but niggas now will smoke ya/
I just really want my Momma to be proud of me/
Cause from start she never ever doubted me/
Now there's a blessing in every lesson so pay attention/
Can't comprehend it yet appreciate in retrospect/
Now women call me all the time but I'm still feeling lonely/
I told Mellz that he my nigga, hold me down homie/
Now there's so much that I could lose but got the world to gain/
But I'll never sell my soul, some niggas fall in vain/
I can't complain my back was against the wall/
But now a nigga back and I'm back to taking it all/
Ya'll niggas got it backwards like walking before you crawl/
Everything I needed was given lets go to war/
