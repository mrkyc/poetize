Look..
As life is taking it's course/
A man of word and my balls/
These women say that they love me/
But love me what really for/
I show'em like no remorse/
At times ignoring they calls/
I'm wildin' up in the party and curving them with my boys/
But fuck it she tryna to dance/
Her body got me entranced/
These niggas is hating on me but that ain't stopping the plans/
These bitches know I'm the man/
You might also likeThey happy to get a glance/
Of me and my homies ballin' and getting money at hand/
Bottle popping with the crew/
And I stay with a couple goons/
And I'm telling you keep your cool/
Cause they jump at the slightest move/
I swear I'm telling the truth/
What the hell is you trying to prove/
Come and poly with me shawty, I'll put you on something new/
That's right...
One life to live, gotta stay on the mission/
Always been head strong, Momma said that I've never listen/
Got this liquor in my system/
Out here bugging and tripping/
I'm out living my life/
You see it all in my symptoms/

Chorus:

Living this life, the life that I live/
Got the state of mind where I don't give a shit/
Only live once so I'mma have fun/
Till the world says you're done, you're done, you're done, you're done. X 2

Verse 2:
Look...
I'm steady living this life/
The bottles chill on the ice/
I'm focusing on the prize/
While I'm getting my haters tight/
The money stay on my mind/
Cause these bitches be outta sight/
I been grinding for this moment ain't leave it up to the dice/
Gotta a long way to go like you travel on 95/
And your girlfriend winking at me she came along for the ride/
Lame niggas we don't comply/
Real niggas until we die/
I vow to kill every beat that 9era make and supply/
I'm steady chasing this high/
It make it easy to cope with/
The trial and the pain that's deterring you from your focus/
They say that I am hopeless for steady chasing this dream/
Attitude be like Malcolm I gets it by any means/
Tonight is a celebration/
Women coming in flocks/
Reload the bottle of Henny, Belvedere and Ciroc/
We all are taking a shot/
I'm out here claiming my spot/
And life is the greatest the teacher/
And trust it taught me a lot/

Chorus:

Living this life, the life that I live/
Got the state of mind where I don't give a shit/
Only live once so I'mma have fun/
Till the world says you're done, you're done, you're done, you're done. X 2

Bridge:

When the night fall, yeah I'm rolling/
Got my head high, they can't hold me down/
Trust and believe I'm still hoping/
Making my mark they won't take this crown/
So high, I fly...
Till the sun comes up...
Just free your mind, we gonna light it up/
Chorus:

Living this life, the life that I live/
Got the state of mind where I don't give a shit/
Only live once so I'mma have fun/
