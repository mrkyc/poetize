I said...
I lost a couple friends to over petty shit and bitches/
I'm glad that I did, found out who was my niggas/
And all we really got is memories and all the pictures/
And my momma keep on telling me to please read my scriptures/
Anything is possible you cannot tell me differ/
At the point of no return, you held me down I won't forget ya/
The best that I can be is that man up in the mirror/
And I kill whose on the list, I'm the opposite is Schindler/
Fred The Godson:
Fredrico, y'all got me confused for sure/
This that craigslist flow, it been used before/
But I don't think like this, cause y'all don't think like this/
Head shot bars the god that's why I brag/
Started off like Lebron, I used to shoot for Cavs/
Ladies love me, say I'm a visionary/
These threesomes to me starting to be missionary/
Real talk, when I'm spittin' they listen like doctor Phil talk/
Me and Jameel, Black Deville riding clean no accessories/
Black Glock in the stash box, just the necessities/
When you a figure, they figure, they can just figure yours/
But faking on figure, Get your legs broke figure four/
I'm first option, never secondary/
Fred The God, Jameel this is legendary/

Jameel Mason:
I'm tryna to find the words to this verse and I think I got it/
Success is not for dummies, invest in some better logic/
Groovin' to the beat and she's dancing oh so erotic/
And my team of fly niggas that's cruising on auto pilot/
I can give two fucks about it, I told you I'm on a mission/
I seen it, I had a vision, y'all niggas didn't wanna listen/
They on there Earl Simmons, be happy to catch me slippin'/
But I got back up start to bouncing on em like Pippen/
I suggest you take precaution my nigga, it's just advice/
I told you, ain't tellin' twice, Jameel is colder than ice/
My dream to kill these beats, so it's harder to sleep at night/
I ain't dissing the Carolina's but never been first in flight/
Jersey we stay and fight, told you that boy was nice/
Most these rappers L sevens, that's why my circle is tight/
I told her that I write and she started blessing the pipe/
I said damn you going hard, she a sucker for something light/
Lampin' in Chula Vista, Fire Flame Spitter/
Told you I was sick, I don't want no elixir/
I come to take it all hoping u get the picture/
Nigga gearing up, yeah that's what I'm doing all winter/
Becoming legendary, it's necessary I win/
If the top is kinda scary, my future is looking grim/
Victoria secret model your chances is kinda slim/
I swear I heard that over, over and over again/
Breakdown:
Becoming legendary, being cuffed can wait a while/
I'm on my grind homie, trying to make my paper pile/
I tell these bad bitches get comfy and stay awhile/
