Forced to sit through sermons and be still
Making trouble for the Sunday School teacher
Running through the pews
Just a child then
You were wide-eyed and confused
Screaming on the bus
With all the youth
And more concerned
With dating than with truth
Too cool to join the choir
Too smart to go to school
Church was boring
And the scriptures, just more rules
But all through the years
Your eyes and ears
Saw just enough of Christ
Among the people here
To know what you could trust
To know that you were loved
Until there came the day
Your heart could finally say
I want to go
Where You are going, Lord
I want to be among Your people
Where You are
I cannot live my life alone
I don't know how
But You would not bring me this far
To leave me now
You might also likeFinally off to college for the fall
Fifty different lifestyles down one hall
Your professors question everything
Your roommates test your faith
And easy answers seem so out of place
Running from the chapel with your spouse
And making monthly payments on the house
You were living for your children
And they up and moved away
Your friends seem older
And worry fills your days
But all through the years
Your eyes and ears
Saw just enough of Christ
Among the people here
To know what you could trust
To know that you were loved
Until there came the day
Your heart could finally pray
I want to go
Where You are going, Lord
I want to be among Your people
Where You are
I cannot live my life alone
I don't know how
But You would not bring me this far
To leave me now
You would not bring me this far
