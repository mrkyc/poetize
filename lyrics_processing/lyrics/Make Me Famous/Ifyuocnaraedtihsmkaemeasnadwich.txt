Falling from the top of this world
In a step from jackpot
Second places make me reach for gold
My hand of luck
Turned into hand of curse
This streak of dark
Leads bad to worse
I'm ready to give my soul
For the chance I can't control
There is nothing to choose
There is no turning back
They's make you lose
They will break your fucking neck
When you're running after the hand of gold
You never notice the day when your heart is sold
I started the game
With a hand that I'm not used to
Only got myself to blame
Should have known what I get into
Seeing in black and red
Never care what's ahead
Until my passion is fed
You might also likeI started the game
With a hand that I'm not used to
Only got myself to blame
Should have known what I get into
Seeing in black and red
Never care what's ahead
Until my passion is fed
In the middle of the night
I'm tight on money
So let's start the fight
And never call me, honey
I'm sharing my heart
Between you and this game
It's taking your part
I'm forgetting your name
There is nothing to choose
There is no turning back
They's make you lose
They will break your fucking neck
There is nothing to choose
There is no turning back
They's make you lose
They will break your fucking neck
When you're running after the hand of gold
You never notice the day when your heart is sold
Dreams are alright
As Megan's fox is tight
As Optimus is Prime
They're coming true tonight
Dreams are alright
As Norris never cried
As Tsoi has never died
They're coming true tonight
Got my hat and the mighty horse, so ride on!
You're heading Tennessee sunset, baby!
Not even tired to say come on, come on! yay!
Once upon a time on Mississippi river
There was something and it was a bull
He was swimming down and smiling at me
But I didn't think it was cool
But I don't know I'm singing of
It is meant to be about love
But now it's time for breakdown, kids!
Are you ready?
Final words are all the same, you know?
Don't trade a life for a motherfucking game
Final words are all the same, you know?
Don't trade a life for a motherfucking game
When your life will turn into a show
You'll stay alone and got yourself to blame
Final words are all the same, you know?
