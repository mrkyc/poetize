Thousands of handshakes, millions of heartbreaks
Can't prevent the shots you take
I look around, at where I'm found
I'd never change the things I make

It feels like you're always losing
Living life that you would never choose
I know your efforts are in vain now
Living life that brings you only pain
I'm here again
RUN!

I never met her twice
I'll never see her face again
I can't remember her eyes and I will never tell her name
Just a tiny drop in my lifestream
She made my past life stop
Her blood still remains on my skin
I never met her twice
I'll never see her face again
I can't remember her eyes and I will never tell her name
Just a tiny drop (Just a tiny drop) in my lifestream
She made my past life stop

You're always lying; You never learn
Your heart is dying; I've no concern
You're always lying; You never learn
Your heart is dying; I've no concern
I spread a knowledge to the world
That makes it hard to breathe
You can run for your answers
But I'll make you fall on your knees
I'll be your midnight fear
I'll be your midnight fear!

I will break your neck spinning like a thunder
I'm the giant wave that will take you under
I will tear your guts. I'm your disaster
I am not a vision - I'm the master
I will break your neck spinning like a thunder
I'm the giant wave that will take you under
I will tear your guts. I'm your disaster
I am not a vision - I'm the master
I'm the master
I'm the master
I'm the master
I'm the master
I'm the master
I'm the master
Bitch suck dick!
She made my past life stop
