Oh let me see, see your dreams
And just let me touch your heart again
On the street where my beliefs never caused you no pain

(People hurt)
They always leave in just a minute
For all those woken in my shirt (You should admit!)
That I just did it, that I just did it

Feels so hard to find the reason of love can't take any longer
You're so much stronger
Since I've been dreaming of a sign from above
Don't get any better, nothing does matter
My eyes are open wide to see what's coming next
The trace I walk is so empty
I'll give my life to make you never forget
Who the hell you wanted to make me
I'm better than you could be

Always so sure that you can climb the sky
Settle down your mind and never ever die
Come and kiss me
Oh darling, make me believe, that I could never give it back
Just turn my back and leave
X2

Never knew if my words would make sense again
When you extend your name with titles and awards
If there is a time for words to make sense again
If there is a planet of hopes will you and me remain?
You mesh my head and that's the worst thing you could do
I never knew if my words would make sense again

Feels so hard to find the reason of love can't take any longer
You're so much stronger
Since I've been dreaming of a sign from above
Don't get any better, nothing does matter
My eyes are open wide to see what's coming next
The trace I walk is so empty
I'll give my life to make you never forget
Who the hell you wanted to make me
I'm better than you could be

A tiny border between love and hate

Yeah babe, I was lying
But now it's true, so make up your mind and look for your heartbeat
I would connect my life with every single part
Yeah babe, I was lying
But now it's true, so make up your mind and look for your heartbeat
I would connect my life with every single part
People hurt - they always leave in just a minute
For all those woken in my shirt - admit that I just did it
People hurt - they always leave in just a minute
For all those woken in my shirt
