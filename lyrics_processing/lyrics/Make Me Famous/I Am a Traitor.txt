We, we have reached this place in the way we could
With memories of you and all that dirt
I was so happy, babe
I never thought that I would
I never thought that I would
Sometimes I see your smile
Your lonely eyes behind it
A trick of pride but
So easy founded
So easy founded
It was you inside my vision (inside my vision)
Making me take such a hard decision
Hours I've spent with you
What's left is to ask permission
To leave this so untrue
You're faster than me for one step
And for one moment I was late
And everything has found its place
I know, the way you walk
Defines you'll always suffer from this world
The perfect one that I created taking my last breath
If you'd have another chance
You'll do this one more time again
If you'd have another chance
You'll do this one more time again

On the day I found you lost in the house (of your fears)
Should have left you there but couldn't dare
Couldn't dare
Miracle is over
But it still remains inside me
Sometimes I see your smile
Your lonely eyes behind it
A trick of pride but
So easy founded
Making me take such a hard decision
Hours I've spent with you
What's left is to ask permission
To leave this so untrue

I can not watch this summer taking you away from my arms
Away from my arms and it seems so untrue
Just one moment before I was so sincere (so sincere)
Waiting for all those fears to disappear
But that's our night and that's our fight
To save this world from drowning
But that's our chance to escape this world we live in
Take me deep underwater to forget trifling things
Take me deep into the dreams that I've never seen
You leaving empty hearts behind you hiding what's on your mind
But all turns to nothing by midnight
