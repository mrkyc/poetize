I fell in love in the back seat of your car
The road was shorter than looked
Like ten years and two more
And I held my girl closer than was safe

Take what you want from me
I'm not afraid to turn around
To see you by my side
And I felt pretty when they turned out the lights
I didn't know just what was going on
When all my guts were telling me to run
I stuck around when I should have been there with you
After all we lost, I swear I'll never let go

Cause you and I both are nothing but thieves
We take what we want when we need
I had a chance for a better life
But all that I've known is to
Run, run, run from a devil in disguise
Like a bullet, a bullet, a bullet into the night
We are the last generation of hope
And I wouldn't mind if
Together we died alone
You might also like
I was 21 when I lost control
I took my hands off the wheel
Wheel it spun on its own
And I lost so much of what I loved

Take what you want from me
I'm not afraid to turn around
To see you by my side
And I felt pretty when they turned out the lights
I didn't know just what was going on
When all my guts were telling me to run
I stuck around when I should have been there with you
After all we lost, I swear I'll never let go

Cause you and I both are nothing but thieves
We take what we want when we need
I had a chance for a better life
But all that I've known is to
Run, run, run from a devil in disguise
Like a bullet, a bullet, a bullet into the night
We are the last generation of hope
And I wouldn't mind if
Together we died alone
As long as you're here then
