Ah, ah
Ah, ah...
Are you ready?
Are you ready?
Are you ready?
Are you ready?

Are you ready for the time of your life?
It's time to stand up and fight
S'alright, s'alright
Hand in hand, we'll take a caravan
To the motherland...

One by one, we're gonna stand up with pride
One that can't be denied
Stand up, stand up
From the highest mountain, valley low
We'll join together with hearts of gold...

Now the children of the world can see
This is a better place for us to be
The place in which we were born
So neglected and torn apart (torn apart)
You might also like
Every woman, every man
Join the caravan of love
(Stand up) stand up, stand up
Everybody, take a stand
Join the caravan of love
(Stand up) stand up, stand up

I'm your brother
I'm your brother, don't you know
She's my sister
She's my sister, don't you know

We'll be living in the world of peace
And the day when everyone is free
We'll bring the young and the old
Won't you let your love flow from your heart

Every woman, every man
Join the caravan of love
(Stand up) stand up, stand up
Everybody, take a stand
Join the caravan of love
(Stand up) stand up, stand up

I'm your brother
I'm your brother, don't you know
She's my sister (we're waiting, we're waiting)
She's my sister, don't you know (we're waiting, we're waiting for a caravan)

So are you ready (he's coming)
Are you ready (he's coming)
Are you ready (he's coming)
Are you ready (he's coming on the caravan)
You better get ready (don't worry)
You better get ready (don't worry)
You better get ready (don't worry)
You better get ready (don't worry 'bout the caravan)
(Keep waiting, keep waiting)
