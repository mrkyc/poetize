See you looking at me
Feels like I'm in a dream
I don't wanna wake up
Think we were meant to be
My heart skipping a beat
To magic mystery
You know you're what I need

I know, I know
I got a feeling
I can't let go

Hey boy, tell me what you thinking
I can't wait until the weekend
I know, I know, you know
It's gonna be something sweet
Hey boy, tell me what you thinking
I can't wait until the weekend
I know, I know, you know
It's gonna be something sweet

Say yeah
I say yeah (Oh oh oh)
I know, I know, you know
It's gonna be something
Say yeah
I say yeah (Oh oh oh)
I know, I know, you know
It's gonna be something sweet
You might also like
Heaven on earth with you
Take my breath away
No place I'd rather be
You're the only way
Got my heart on my sleeve
Come on take the lead
Show me the best things are free

I know, I know
I got a feeling
I can't let go

Hey boy, tell me what you thinking (What you thinking)
I can't wait until the weekend ('Til the weekend)
I know, I know, you know
It's gonna be something sweet

Say yeah

I wanna be right
Where you are because
I know we belong together
I wanna be right
Where you are because
I know we belong together
