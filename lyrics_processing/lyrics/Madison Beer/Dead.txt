You could be here, but you're there
You could be anywhere
And these days I don't even care, no more
You only be showing me love
Whenever you've had too much
Whatever's been filling your cup
No more

Baby, no more showing up when you're not sober
At my front door just to say you're alone tonight
You're tryna fuck me and my mind up
It's a reminder, you're a liar
And you know I'm right

You say you can't live without me (Yeah)
So why aren't you dead yet?
Why you still breathing? (Why, why, why)
If you say you can't live without me (You said it)
Then why aren't you dead yet?
Why do you say that?

You could be here, but you're not
I give whatever you want
But you just take it and run, you run (Oh, run, run)
And I give you so many shots
But you're just drinking 'em all
You never give it a thought
Oh, lord (Yeah)

Baby, no more showing up when you're not sober (Sober)
At my front door just to say you're alone tonight (Alone tonight)
You're tryna fuck me and my mind up
It's a reminder, you're a liar
And you know I'm right

You say you can't live without me (You say you can't live without me)
So why aren't you dead yet?

If you say you can't live without me (You said it)
Then why aren't you dead yet?
Why do you say that?

Why, why, why, why?
Why, why, why, why?
Why, why, why, why? (Ooh, whoa)
Why aren't you dead yet?

Be careful what you say (You say)
Say only what you mean (You mean)
Mean to me, then you're nice
You're nice, you're nice (Yeah)
It's nice to know you now
Now that it all went down (Went down)
Down on your knees, you cry (You cry)
You cry, you cry, yeah
You say you can't live without me (You said it)
So why aren't you dead yet? (So why aren't you dead?)
Why you still breathing? (Why are you still breathing?)
If you say you can't live without me (You said it)
Then why aren't you dead yet? (Why aren't you dead?)
Why do you say that? (Why)

Why, why, why, why?
Why, why, why, why?
Why, why, why, why?
Why aren't you dead yet?
Why, why, why, why?
Why, yeah
