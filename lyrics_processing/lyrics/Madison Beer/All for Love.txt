I'm looking for places to run and hide
I'll never forget you, Lord knows I've tried
Wish I could see you without closing my eyes
But I know, I know, it's so far behind

Fading out, fading out, can't get right
I'm tossing out, turning out, every night
I'm losing my, losing my, goddamn mind
Ask me why I did it, ask me why I did it, I said

All for love
Ask me why I did it, I said
All for love
Ask me why I did it, I said

I've run out of tears, I've run out of pride
It's crazy the truth hurts way more than the lie

Fading out, fading out, can't get right
I'm tossing out, turning out, every night
I'm losing my, losing my, goddamn mind
Ask me why I did it, ask me why I did it, I said

Ask me why I did it, I said

All for love, all for love, all for love
All for love, all for love, all for love
All for love
Ask me why I did it, I said

When I'm away from her the times slow
And I ain't leaning on a double cup of Styrofoam
She got me fiendin', you wanna know the reason she really fly though?
She gets me high but I ain't got to hide her from the five-O
And when her name pops up on my iPhone, I'm still mind blown
That this love is diamonds, no rhinestone
'Cause what we got's for real and I forget what day of week it is when I'm with her
She got me doing crazy things without a drop of liquor
Drunk in love, this can't be good for my liver
She's the only one who keeps me off Instagram and Twitter
And everybody keeps on asking me just why I did it
So I tell 'em
All for love (I did it all for love, man I swear, I did it all for love)
Ask me why I did it, I said
All for love (I did it all for love)
Ask me why I did it, I said

All for love, all for love, all for love (I did it all for love)
All for love, all for love, all for love (Yeah, I did it all for love)
All (all for love) for (I did it all for love) love
