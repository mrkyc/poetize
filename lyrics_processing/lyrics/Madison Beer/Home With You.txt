I ain't got no time for no games
Tell me what you like
But it's never gon' change
So you do what you wanna, wanna do
And I'm not going home with you, home with you
I ain't got no time for no games
I'm not being rude
Can you give me my space?
'Cause I do what I wanna, wanna do
And I'm not going home with you, home with you

Your words are dead
Cheap lines are boring
So I do my thing and keep on ignoring you
So you're aware
I don't go 'round giving my thing up, thing up
Have some respect, it's quite insulting
I don't wanna wake up with you in the morning
You tell me you're different
Excuse me for snoring
You liar, liar

I ain't got no time for no games
Tell me what you like
But it's never gon' change
So you do what you wanna, wanna do
And I'm not going home with you, home with you
I ain't got no time for no games
I'm not being rude
Can you give me my space?
'Cause I do what I wanna, wanna do
And I'm not going home with you, home with you
You might also like
No, baby, don't tell me your story (No)
You know I don't care
So why you persistent?
For now I am not, not gonna sleep with you
Stop now (Yeah)
Stop now (Yeah)
Have some respect
Don't act like I'm blind
I can see your intent
Spent way too much time I have
Listening to this, listening to shit
From a player, you get no love

I ain't got no time for no games
Tell me what you like
But it's never gon' change
So you do what you wanna, wanna do
And I'm not going home with you, home with you
I ain't got no time for no games
I'm not being rude
Can you give me my space?
'Cause I do what wanna, wanna do
And I'm not going home with you, home with you
Oh, I'm not going
I'm not going home with you, boy, no
I'm not going home with you (Yeah)
Home with you
Don't do this to me, nightmare
You got a nice face, big deal
Don't want what you got right here, no-whoa
I won't hear you darling
'Cause I'm not your baby
Do I have to say it
Say it again, again?

I ain't got no time for no games
Tell me what you like
But it's never gon' change
So you do what you want, what you wanna do
And I'm not going home with you, home with you
I ain't got no time for no games
I'm not being rude
Can you give me my space?
'Cause I do what I wanna, wanna do
And I'm not going home with you, home with you

Oh
You do what you wanna, wanna do
