I hear melodies in my head
Find little notes in my bed
I got songs tangled up in my hair
I see piano keys everywhere
My heart is a beating drum
Repeating my favorite song
I hear Beethoven No. 9
All the time

And it's kind of like Do, Re, Mi
About as easy as A, B, C
(Baby)
Beautiful like a symphony
I'm talkin' 'bout you and me, yeah

I hear melodies in my head
I, I hear melodies in my head
I was a little off-key
Then you Melodyne me
And I'm better than ever
Hear melodies in my head
I, I hear melodies in my head
I had the beat a bit wrong
But I got a new song now
So I put my headphones on
Plug into you, plug into you
Oh you're my favorite song
Plug into you, plug into you
Oh, whoa
You might also like
You're so wrong that it makes you right
Keep me wide awake at night
I can't sleep now I know you're around
I lie listenin', singin' every sound
I love it when I hear your voice
Oh, baby, I don't think we really got a choice
Mozart is in the air
And I'm right here

And it's kinda like Do, Re, Mi
About as easy as A, B, C
(Baby)
Beautiful like a symphony, yeah
I'm talkin' 'bout you and me, ohhh, oh, oh

I hear melodies in my head
I, I hear melodies in my head
I was a little off-key
Then you melodized me
And I'm better than ever
Hear melodies in my head
I, I hear melodies in my head
I had the beat a bit wrong
But I got a new song now
So I put my headphones on
Plug into you, plug into you
Oh you're my favorite song
Plug into you, plug into you
Oh, whoa
I wake up in the middle of the night
I can't stop all the melodies that I
Hear melodies, baby
I hear melodies all the time
And I'm about to go crazy
I keep on singing about you 'cause see baby
You're my melody and I
I hear melodies in my head

I hear melodies in my head
I, I hear melodies in my head
I was a little off-key
Then you melodized me
And I'm better than ever
Hear melodies in my head
I, I hear melodies in my head
I had the beat a bit wrong
But I got a new song now
So I put my headphones on
Plug into you, plug into you
Oh you're my favorite song
Plug into you, plug into you
Oh, whoa
Put my headphones on
Plug into you, plug into you
Oh you're my favorite song
Plug into you, plug into you
