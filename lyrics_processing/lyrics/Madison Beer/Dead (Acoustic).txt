You could be here, but you're there
You could be anywhere and these days I don't even care no more
You only be showing me love whenever you've had too much
Whatever's been filling your cup, no more

Baby, no more showing up when you're not sober
At my front door just to say you're alone tonight
Yeah, tryna fuck me and my mind up
It's a reminder you're a liar and you know I'm right

You say you can't live without me
So why aren't you dead yet?
Why you still breathing?
And you say you can't live without me
Then why aren't you dead yet?
Why do you say that?

You could be here but you're not, I give whatever you want
But you just take it and run, you run (oh run, run)
And I give you so many shots but you just drinking 'em all
You never give it a thought, oh love (yeah)

Why, why, why, why?
Why, why, why, why?
Why, why, why, why?

Be careful what you say
Say only what you mean
Mean to me then you're nice
You're nice, you're nice
It's nice to know you now
Now that it all went down
Down on your knees you cry
You cry, you cry, yeah
You say you can't live without me
So why aren't you dead yet?
Why you still breathing?
And you say you can't live without me
Then why aren't you dead yet?
Why do you say that?

Why, why, why, why?
Why, why, why, why?
Why, why, why, why?
Why aren't you dead yet?
Why, why, why, why?
Why, why, why, why?
