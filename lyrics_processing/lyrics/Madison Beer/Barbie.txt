Barbie, you're beautiful
You make me feel
My Barbie doll is really real
Rea-rea-real
Barbie, you make me feel
I'm sorry if I seem a little blunt about my feelings
I just feel like I've been seeing all the same old boring people
So many faces, more I look at them they all becoming faceless
My life is just another product placement, yeah

I'm at this event and I'm unimpressed
If I'm wearing clothes then I'm overdressed
We all hate the scene
But as long as we're happy on our screens, yeah

(Barbie)
We built a house on wasted fame
Would kill for the world to know your name
Can't take that glory to the grave
Oh-oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Barbie)
We built a life of broken homes
Painted the walls with glitter and gold
I run my mouth but babe, let's face it
I'm the same, I just embrace it

To keep us all sedated
Mascara on your third eye
It's making all the world blind
I'm the perfect patient in this Barbie generation

I'm at this event and I'm unimpressed

We all hate the scene
