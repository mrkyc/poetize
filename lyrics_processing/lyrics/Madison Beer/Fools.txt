There you go
Getting so overly comfortable, baby
Does it ever cross your mind?
Like oh, no
She wants to be in somebody else's photos
On the low, low, yeah

You don't know what I'm thinking
You don't even try
Whatever you've been drinking
Has got you out of your mind like
I know you've been hurting
And I know I'm the reason why

Don't you know, baby?
Only fools stick around when the love is gone
Don't you know, baby?
Only fools stick around when the love is all gone
Don't you know, baby?
Hey, I just fool around, babe, Such a fool for me (Fool for me)
'Cause only fools stick around
When the love is all gone
You might also like
You walk a hundred miles
And wait a while for somebody
Who don't even smile
Does it ever cross your mind?
Like oh, Lord
She don't want to dance
With the same man no more
Are you so sure?
Yeah

You don't know what I'm thinking
You don't even try
Whatever you've been drinking
Has got you out of your mind like
I know you've been hurting
And I know I'm the reason why

Don't you know, baby?
Only fools stick around when the love is gone
Don't you know, baby?
Only fools stick around when the love is all gone
Don't you know, baby?
Hey, I just fool around, babe, Such a fool for me (Fool for me)
'Cause only fools stick around
When the love is all gone
There you go
Getting so overly comfortable, baby
Does it ever cross your mind?
Like oh, no
She wants to be in somebody else's photos
On the low, low
There you go
Getting so overly comfortable, baby
Does it ever cross your mind?
Like oh, no
She wants to be in somebody else's photos
On the low, low

Don't you know, baby?
Only fools stick around
Don't you know, baby?
Only fools stick around when the love is all gone
Don't you know, baby?
Only fools stick around when the love is gone
