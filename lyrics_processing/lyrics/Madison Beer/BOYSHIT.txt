I'm lettin' you in, you're lettin' me down (Ooh)
I swear, when you talk, you just like the sound  (Ooh)
One too many times I let you ruin my life 'cause
I thought you would change, but I see it now (Ooh)

All the yellin' and kissin' and fightin'
We never could see eye to eye
'Cause you might seem like a man, but you're not one in your mind
Yeah, I'm back on my shit and it's temptin'
To call you and see how you're doin'
But I couldn't understand you if I tried

I don't speak boyshit
You're always coming back, but your love's poison
So I think that I would rather just avoid it
I can't understand ya 'cause I don't speak boy, no
I don't speak, I don't speak, I don't speak boyshit (Woo)

Don't know how to talk or communicate (Ooh)
We're so on and off, to you, it's a game (Ooh)
If you don't level up, I'm leavin' you in the dust, yeah
So I'm movin' on until you start tryna act your age, yeah (Your age, yeah)
You might also like
'Cause I don't speak boyshit
You're always coming back, but your love's poison
So I think that I would rather just avoid it
I can't understand ya 'cause I don't speak boy, no
I don't speak, I don't speak, I don't speak

All the yellin' and kissin' and fightin'
We never could see eye to eye, yeah
You might seem like a man, but you're not one in your mind
Yeah, I'm back on my shit and it's temptin'
To call you and see how you're doin'
But I couldn't understand you if I tried

'Cause I don't speak boyshit (Shit, shit, shit)
Boyshit (Shit, shit, shit)
'Cause I don't speak boy, no
Boyshit (Shit, shit, shit)

'Cause I don't speak boyshit
So tryna get through to you is pointless
You might have a way with words, but I'm a woman
I can't understand you 'cause I don't speak boy, no
I don't speak, I don't speak, I don't speak boyshit (Woo)
I don't speak boyshit
I don't speak boyshit
'Cause I don't speak boy, no
