Do you feel like you just can't take no more?
Broken heart all your pieces on the floor
Like you're runnin' out of breath
Tryna find yourself
Before you blow away in the night
Every word you ever said
Every way you ever felt
I know it's hard but baby tonight

We're gonna run through fire like we've never been burnt
We're gonna laugh out loud like we've never been hurt
We gonna shout it out to the edge of the world
We're unbreakable
You're unbreakable
We're gonna scream on rooftops dance in the rain
We'll open up our hearts (yeah) forget the pain
And they can call us crazy freakin' insane
We're unbreakable
We're unbreakable
You're unbreakable
You're unbreakable

Empty streets filled with faces you don't know
In a crowd tryna stand out tryin' to glow
But no matter where you are it's like you're in the dark
And just can't find the fuse to the light
Every word you ever said, every way you ever felt
I know it's hard but baby tonight

I am me
There's nothin' that can break me
Nothin' that can break me
I'm tellin' you I am free
There's nothin' that can hold me
Nothin' that can hold me
I'm tellin' you I am me
Nothin' that can break me
Nothin' that can break me
I'm tellin' you I am free
Can't hold me down
