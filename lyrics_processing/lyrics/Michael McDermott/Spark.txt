The hand of fate still seems corrupt
When you're caught on the wrong side of your own generation
Found the cracks like midnight barks
Intoxication, the slipstream narcs
Does the temple of your soul need restoration?
Gareth lived here his whole damn life
His job, his lover, his complex wife
He said, "I've never even thought of leaving"
He said, "Believe it or not I'm quite content
Every now and again I kneel and repent
But I never seem to find that feeling of healing, baby"
Spark the heart in a godless night
Spark the dark 'til it turns to light
Spark the colors in the eyes that blame
Spark the embers 'til they turn to flame
From the small towns where the dreams don't hide
To the big city where they do collide
To these hotel rooms where the clocks have ceased their ticking
He dreamt of Paris and MTV
Ireland and the BBC
But now the dream well it only makes him sicken
You might also likeNo one knows his name or even cares
As he stumbles drunk up and down those stairs
Or the spirits' fire that burns within his temper
He's haunted by every train running south
And every lover that he brought to his mouth
Fear of secrets that may soon be rendered, or surrendered, baby
Spark the heart in a godless night
Spark the dark 'til it turns to light
Spark the colors in the eyes that blame
Spark the embers 'til they turn to flame
Yeah, she dyed her hair since the last time we spoke
I got her a drink and I lit up her smoke
And she said, "I don't know how I wound up so defeated"
She said, "These pictures in this place always make me sad
Make me think about the family I never had
I hate the fact that I'm always feeling cheated"
While the jukebox plays 'Your Cheatin' Heart'
Can't see the wounds as well when you're in the dark
She said, "I'll be right back", but I knew she was lying
Me I knew, I needed different company
These kind of talks always get to me
This place smells like everybody's dying, or trying, baby
Spark the heart in a godless night
Spark the dark 'til it turns to light
Spark the colors in the eyes that blame
Spark the embers 'til they turn to flame
Yeah, spark
