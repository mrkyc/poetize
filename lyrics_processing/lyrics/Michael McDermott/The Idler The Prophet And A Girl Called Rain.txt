The Idler stood beside of her, wonderin' whether to walk or run
"Rain" he said, "Tell me again, how you got your funny name"
She said, "My house is the only one on that street
I live at One South Rainey's Lane"
"Jesus, where is he when you need him" Rain said and threw a penny into the well
"He's usually" spoke the Prophet, "behind you and your just too dumb to tell"
Rain said "Who are you? You look like a drunken fool
I wasn't talkin' to you anyway"
The Prophet said "I'm no one baby, just like you
But I can spot a joker coming a mile away....hey"
The prophet said "You can turn and you turn, tryin' to find yourself
You turn and you turn 'til there's no one else
You turn and you turn, until you turn insane"
Aching hours and aching days with the Idler, the Prophet and a girl called Rain
The Prophet he was smokin' by the well runnin' his hands through his greasy hair
The Idler wasn't movin' he was gazin' into the stillness of the air
Rain she sat, adjusted her hat, and said somethin' as a city bus roared by
The Prophet said "I'm sorry I didn't catch your name"
As he looked into the troubled oceans of her eyes
Rain said "Forget it, now... it doesn't matter anyhow. I'm just a cat out on the ledge"
The Prophet said "Melodrama suits you girl... I just don't think you've got the edge"
The Idler looked twice and he rolled his dice and said "You know what would be nice?...
If you two would shut up for a while"
The Prophet said "That's fine with me"
Rain nodded, she seemed to agree and the Idler began to smile
Just like a child... The Prophet said
"You can turn and you turn tryin' to find yourself
You turn and you turn 'til there's no one else
You turn and you turn in a baptism of flame"
The wind swept like a revelation with the Idler, the Prophet and a girl called Rain
The Idler said "Indecision's, ruthless"
As he saw a toothless mother near her child engulf a beer
Rain said "I've fallen so many times these days no one believes it or seems to care"
The Prophet said "Is it all about the future is it all about the fear of livin' with the pain
Or is it all about weakness, temptations curtain tricks or findin' someone to blame"
The Idler said "I'm gonna call it a night I heard the sage was gettin' somethin' goin'
Somethin' about russian roulette, on a blackjack bet, wine and blood will be flowin'
And do me a favor, if you see the president tell him I got somethin' right here for him
You two run along now, be careful, cuz you never know what kind of trouble two people could get in...remember
"You can turn and you turn tryin' to find yourself
You turn and you turn 'til there's no one else
You turn and you turn , but it's never gonna be the same"
The sky bled of dying dreams above the Idler, the Prophet and a girl called Rain
The Prophet and Rain walked to the water
Castin' stones into the night
They went down Rainey's Lane to Rain's place and made love
And fell asleep after it was light
Rain woke to the sounds of the parade
The Prophet he was no where in sight
He left a note on the mirror sayin' "Believe in the Rain and the Rain will be alright"
And she could remember him sayin'...
"You can turn and you turn tryin' to find yourself
You turn and you turn 'til there's no one else
You turn and you turn and never understand the pain"
I guess that's the story...
