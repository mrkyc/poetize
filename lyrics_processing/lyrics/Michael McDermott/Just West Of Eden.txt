I was sailing slowly losing all control
I was goin' down in the dirty water
Deep into the middle of my soul
There like a streak of lightning, illuminating everything in sight
I surrendered to this senseless fighting
I surrendered to this senseless light
Over top of yonder mountain, over there where the rainbow ends
I took a drink from the holy fountain
Down around where the river bends
The further I followed this fallen path
The more I trusted in this fear
Then revealed in the aftermath
I didn't know who I was, what, or where
Just west of Eden, from Chicago to Gethsemane
Just west of Eden, the flowers smelled like tragedy
Just west of Eden
Communion came like rollin' water
Like a feast to a hungry beast
I knelt beside a ploughman's daughter
Whose thirst never seemed to cease
The gateway to the wicked led the lost under their wing
Silence fell upon this hopeless town and the bells of innocence began to ring
You might also likeJust west of Eden, where Cain paved a pavement of sin
Just west of Eden, the trumpet wailed and the walls caved in...
Just west of Eden
Graced by the hours and the mindless traps
In which even the noblest fall
Love's longing flower brought humility unto us all
I stood engulfed by temptations smile
Searching for the only key
Reverent eyes fell upon my brow
While she moved in the air like poetry
Clutching on to this sword, I hold the names of all the men
I rip myself from this chord
Falling free to find myself again
I seize the darkness with a sharpened tongue
Then spit it out at last
I watch the lighthouse from the water
Beware of the coming of the past
Just west of Eden, crucifixions while the cities burn
Just west of Eden, the priest wailed and the poet yearned
Just west of Eden, insolence, prejudice, and cowardice are learned...
