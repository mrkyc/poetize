Ay, I got a question for you
When you see another human being who's being treated worse than a disease
On his knees, beggin' please, for egg and cheese
Or anything to eat, do you see his test as a lesson for you?
Or do you move on? Say "Fuck em", ignore 'em
Can't do nothing for 'em, if this is true, let me count your blessings for you
You could be fighting hunger, not the Gandhi type hunger strike fighting for something right
I mean fighting the type of hunger a little girl in the third world
Fights everyday 'til her stomach is nothing but something that her spine is hiding under
Only been alive five summers
Hunger pains, her heart beating like some live drummers
It's beating harder, then she drop, died
Mama lost a daughter 'cause they ain't have food and drinking water
God damn I shed a tear in the booth
'Cause when I say it I'm simultaneously hearing the truth
But do you care?

Who care?
I need to know if you care
We dying out here in the streets
Little kids, they got nothing to eat
But does anybody care?
Are you there?
Who cares?
You need to see you in them out there, to care
You might also like
Like Zero Dark Thirty we saw terror
Growing up in the hood, a small error
In judgement can make your parents become some
Pallbearers
For nothing, they saw Eric and he gangbanged, but they can't aim
So them straight shots caught Sarah for nothing
Do you care or what?
Get involved, get out of your chair, stand the fuck up
Do something, don't lie down and do nothin'
Five rounds hit him in his side now
Blood paints the streets of the Chitown since the news woman
When is the truce coming?
Violence hit a new summit
And the view from it allows us to see the youth
Plummet
Gotta be sad, colostomy bags, shots got teenagers rockin' a new stomach
And I ain't saying that this rap was perfect
But I'm strapped with purpose
Trying to get past the surgeons in that emergency room
But if I don't get past the casket service
Just write this shit on my tomb, "Nobody cared"

Who care?
I need to know if you care
We dying out here on the streets
Little kids, they got nothing to eat
But does anybody care?
Are you there?
Who cares?
You need to see you in them out there, to care
We dying out here in the streets
Little kids, they got nothin' to eat
But does anybody care?
Does anybody care?
I say, we dying out here in the streets
Little kids, they got nothin' to eat
But does anybody care?
Does anybody care?

Put a lighter in the sky tonight
Put a lighter in the sky tonight (Does anybody care?)
Put a lighter in the sky tonight
Hold a lighter up high tonight (But does anybody care?)
Put a lighter in the sky tonight
Put a lighter in the sky tonight (Does anybody care?)
Put a lighter in the sky tonight
Hold a lighter up high tonight (But does anybody care?)

Who's there to care?
Do you see you in them out there, to care?
Are you there?
Who cares?
You need to see you in them out there, to care
All praise is due to God almighty
