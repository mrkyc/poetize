Hoo-hoo-hoo, yeah

I'm just a love machine
And I won't work for nobody but you (Yeah, baby)
I'm just a love machine
A hugging kissing fiend

I think it's high time you knew
Whenever I think of you
My mind blows a fuse (Baby)
When I look in your eyes
My meter starts to rise
And I become confused

My voltage regulator cools
When I'm sitting next to you
Electricity starts to flow
And my indicator starts to glow, ooh

(I, I) I'm just a love machine
And I won't work for nobody but you (Hoo-hoo-hoo, yeah)
I'm just a love machine (Yeah, baby)
A hugging kissing fiend

I'm gentle as a lamb
I'm not that hard to program
There's no way that you can lose (Doo, doo, doo-doo, ow)
My chassis fits like a glove
I've got a button for love (Push it, push it, ooh)
That you have got to use (Push it, push it)

If you look into my file
I am sure you can find out how
To turn me on, just set my dial
And let me love you for a little while, ooh
