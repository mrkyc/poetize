Baby, take a seat, got something I wanna say to you
Before things get crazy, I'm a need to let out the truth
I wanna tell you, no, I have to tell you
I gotta let this out before he do
And before you say a word, I'm a need your undivided, please
Until I'm finish just try not to say a thing
Ooh, in a way, it's just so complicated
To fix my mouth and say these words to you

See, it's not what you thinking
So don't jump to conclusions
And it's really not that bad
Don't wanna cause confusion
Put yourself in my position
Just hear me out and listen
Understand my condition
Got to let you know, so here I go

Before you were my man
I was chilling with this guy I knew
Before you were my man
Little did I know that he knew you
You should understand and know my circumstance (oh, whoa)
Didn't know he was your friend
Before you were my man
I met him at this party, sitting at the bar
He walked right up to me, bought me some Bacardi
Caught up in the moment I was feeling lonely (lonely)
Don't know how it happened
But this was all before you were my man

Now that I confessed, I think that I should explain myself
It lasted for so long, swear that it was nothing else
Just take a minute to take it all in
Even though it's hard for you to do
I can tell that your upset by the look you have upon your face
Let me apologize for taking so long to say
That your best friend, he was my man
I know it's hard for you to understand

See, it's not what you thinking
So don't jump to conclusions
And it's really not that bad
Don't wanna cause confusion
Put yourself in my position
Just hear me out and listen
Understand my condition
Got to let you know, so here I go

Before you were my man
I was chilling with this guy I knew
Before you were my man
Didn't know that he know you
You should understand, no more circumstance (oh, whoa)
Didn't know he was your friend
Before you were my man
I met him at this party, sitting at the bar
He walked right up to me, bought me some Bacardi
Caught up in the moment I was feeling lonely (lonely)
Don't know how it happened
But this was all before you were my man
Yeah, I know it's crazy (baby)
Now when we come around
You think about what went down
You should have known
Cause when we would come through
I would up and leave the room avoiding the truth
Before

Before you were my man
I was chilling with this guy I knew
Before you were my man
Didn't know that he know you
You should understand, no more circumstance (oh, whoa)
Didn't know he was your friend
Before you were my man
I met him at this party, sitting at the bar
He walked right up to me, bought me some Bacardi
Caught up in the moment I was feeling lonely (lonely)
Don't know how it happened
But this was all before you were my man

You
It's crazy
I had to tell you this way
But it started to get obvious
When he came around
I'm glad I got this off my chest
