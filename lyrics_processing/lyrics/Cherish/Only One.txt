Yeah...
Woah...
Woah...

You and me together
Makes the perfect combination
(Like a body to a soul)
(Like a actress to a role)
I know you have trust issues
But I'm here to let you know
(I'm your Catherine)
(You're my Joe that I have)
You make me whole

I know you go through my phone (phone)
Checking all of my messages
(Oh yeah)
Thinking I do you wrong, wrong
Tryna see who I'm messing with
Baby, I'll ride for you
Baby, I'll die for you
You are the only one
The only one that I'm loving
You might also like
The only one that I'm loving is you (is you)
The only one I'm loving)
(And the only one I let touch me is you
(Is you, baby)
You're the only one
That sees me in my Vickie Secrets
(Victoria's Secret)
The one I share my sheets with
Baby, the only one that I want is you
The only one that I'm missing is you (is you)
(Is you boy)
And the only one that I'm kissing is you
(Oh yeah, oh yeah)
You're the only one
That sees me look rough in the morning
Get that early loving
(Loving, yeah)
Baby, the only one I'm loving is you

See, me without you would be
Like some music with no song
Us together is not a choice
It's like me without a voice
And baby when I tell you that
There's nothing going on
I'm a need you to trust me
And stop tryna prove me wrong, oh yeah


The only one that I'm loving is you (is you)
(You are the one I love)
And the only one I let touch me is you
(I let touch me)
You're the only one that sees me in my Vickie Secrets
(In my Vickie Secrets)
The one I share my sheets with
Baby, the only one that I want is you
(I don't want nobody else but you)
The only one that I'm missing is you is you
(Oh, that I'm missing)
And the only one that I'm kissing is you
(Is you, is you)
You're the only one
That sees me look rough in the morning (The morning)
Get that early loving (Get that early loving)
Baby, the only one I'm loving is you (Loving is you)
Gave you all my love
And I swear it's only you
You're the only one for me
Just open up and see
You gave your heart
I won't break it
My love for you ain't changing
Baby, please hear
What I'm saying
Here's all of me
So take it
