Looking at my watch its almost two
Called me and said to get ready
You comin' through
Want your girl to spend a little time wit you
Boy you must be buggin', cause now you got me rushin'
You roll up in my drive way
You beeped twice, got me lookin' at you sideways
You lookin' right
But you actin' kinda funny
What's on you mind
Damn, I left my wallet at the house

Ooh, ooh I been thinking about all the things that we could do
But I don't know if I could get down wit you
It's got me contemplating
I don't think I'm ready
I don't think I'm ready baby
I don't think I'm ready baby
Ooh, ooh I been thinking about all the things that we could do
But I don't know if I could get down wit you
It's got me contemplating
I don't think I'm ready
I don't think I'm ready baby
I don't think I'm ready baby

We pulled up to your crib and you walked in
Said you'd only be a minute but its been 10
Your motioning for me to come on in
You done lit the candles
Expecting red light special
I know just what you're thinking
You wantin' me
But I'm two seconds from telling you I wanna leave
You put your arms around my, my body
And I don't know what to do
Baby now I want you too


Break down. It's a catch 22
Will I stay or will I go
Cause your kissin' on me
And I don't know what to do
My body saying yes, but my mind is sayng no
Ooh ooh ooh
What I'm gon' do do do
About you you you
I'm so confused, fused
Ooooh

What I'm gon' do do do
About you you you
I'm so confused, fused
