He mixed the ingredient Chemical X
Want to know what will be the effect?
Is it dangerous, or fabulous?
Here they come, they're coming through
It's Blossom and Bubbles and Buttercup too
Here to come to conquer the world
Beware of the Powerpuff Girls

They're coming through and fighting
And everyone they're shocking
You know no one can stop them
All because of the Chemical X
They're coming through and fighting
And everyone they're shocking
You know no one can stop them

Whoa now, now that you see
You should beware of the power of the three
They come to fight as fast as they can
They're dangerous, yet fabulous
Professor Utonium made them it's true
They are the colors of pink, green and blue
They'll catch you in a blink of an eye
And do all before bedtime
