I know those times are far away
But still, I'm missing you
(but still, I'm missing you)
I said some things that I regret
But I'll make it up to you
Baby I can't breathe when you touch
My body
When your heart beats its like music to me
And I can't see my life with out you
Baby it's all up to you

If I could make time stand still
Then I know we can live this moment for ever
Can we stay right here, you don't have to go baby close that door
I really hate missing you
I rather be kissing you
And I don't know what I would
Do, If I couldn't make love to you
Over and Over and Over I wish that I
Could live this moment in time

There were times of day I put my life completely in your arms
And if you should feel I could do more to please you
Then baby tell me how oh oh
Baby I can't breathe when you touch my body
When your heart beats its like music to me
And I can't see my life with out you
Baby it's all up to you
You might also like
If I could make time stand still
Then I know we can live this moment for ever
Can we stay right here, you don't have to go baby close that door
I really ain't missing you
I rather be kissing you
And I don't know what I would
Do, If I couldn't make love to you
Over and Over and Over I wish that I
Could live this moment in time
Time stand still (Can Time stand still)
Then I know we can live this moment for ever (we can live this moment for ever)
Can we stay right here (stay right here)
You don't have to go (you dont have to go) baby close that door (close the door)
I really ain't missing you
I rather be kissing you
And I don't know what I would
Do, If I couldn't make love to you
Over and Over and Over I wish that I
