Lights dimmed
Candles lit
Your car pulls up
And then you walk in
I can see the look on your face
I know you 'bout to ruin my day
Then you get to spittin' lines
Something like this comes a time
Blood rush to my head
I start shaking
Right now my heart is aching

(Thump, thump, thump)
That's when you said and my heart thumped to a thousand beats a second
(Thump, thump, thump)
Gotta catch my breath
(Ha, ha)
'Cause there's nothing left
(Thump, thump, thump)
All these years that I've been down
How you gonna leave me now?
All that's left is regret
Wish I never met you
Can't believe I was a fool
You might also like
You got my heart beating like a drum
Tell me where did this come from?
Thinking that I'mma have your baby
Now you're telling me something crazy
What am I suppose to do?
How do I live without you?
Can't believe you're saying that we're done
You got my heart beating like a drum
(Bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump)
Like a drum
(Bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump)
Like a drum
(Bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump)
Like a drum
(Bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump)
Oh, oh, oh

Now I'm sitting here so confused
Thinking 'bout what the hell I'm gone do
How can I live without your love?
My body's yearning for your touch
Thought you said I would be your wife
Ride or die
Me and you for life
Forever you and I
I was thinking, now our ship is sinking
(Thump, thump, thump)
That's when you said and my heart thumped to a thousand beats a second
(Thump, thump, thump)
Let me catch my breath
(Ha, ha)
Because you up and left
(Thump, thump, thump)
All these years that I've been down
How you gonna leave me now?
All that's left is regret
Wish I never met you
Can't believe I was a fool

You got my heart beating like a drum
Tell me where did this come from?
Thinking that I'm a have your baby
Now you're telling me something crazy
What am I suppose to do?
How do I live without you?
Can't believe you're saying that we're done
You got my heart beating like a drum
(Bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump)
Like a drum
(Bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump)
Like a drum
(Bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump)
Like a drum
(Bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump)
Oh, oh, oh
I still can't see how, how I couldn't see the signs
And how I wasn't warned
Why the only man I ever loved would break my heart?
Tell me where do I go from here?
And how do I move on?
You're the only thing I've known
Baby, your house is my home
How could I lose you?
I won't go
I refuse to
'Cause I can't stop thinking 'bout you
Dreaming 'bout you
See, how could I ever live without you?
Seems like the right words are hard to find
To help you change your mind
For you, baby, I'll fight
'Cause I need you in my life

You got my heart beating like a drum
Tell me where did this come from?
Thinking that I'm a have your baby
Now you're telling me something crazy
What am I suppose to do?
How do I live without you?
Can't believe you're saying that we're done
You got my heart beating like a drum
(Bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump)
Like a drum
(Bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump)
Like a drum
(Bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump)
Like a drum
(Bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump)
