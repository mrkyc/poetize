Five years, that's how long that I had to deal with it
Had to sacrifice a little with it
Your mess, your lies, your cheating ass
And you thought that you was so slick
When you were messing 'round with that chick
Never knew that it would come to this

Seems steady tryna work things out, babe
And you still won't meet me halfway
I really wish we could find a better way to resolve this
Instead we fuss, we fight
Arguing about who's wrong, who's right
Every day we switching roles
Once again, here we go

Here we g-g-go again
Same old drama, we're near the end
I walk out, you walk in
Same bullshit keeps happenin'
Round and round and round we go
Where it stops nobody knows
Got my bags, out the door
Here we, h-h-here we go
You might also like
I'm so done
You made your bed, now go, sleep in it
I'm so gone, this time I'm finished
Should've made those changes from the beginning
Guess I was a fool in love
Couldn't see what was to come
One foot out, one foot in
Tell me, is this the end?

See, I really tried to work things out, babe
But you never did meet me halfway
And it's obvious that we'll never solve this
'Cause still we fuss, we fight
Who'll be the judge? Who's wrong, who's right?
Every day we switching roles
Once again, here we go, baby


So many times I've cried and cried, stuck around and tried to fix it
Set my pride to the side, I would talk but you wouldn't listen
Got my keeps, out the door
With nothing left, I think it's time to go
I told you I couldn't take no more
Once again, here we go
