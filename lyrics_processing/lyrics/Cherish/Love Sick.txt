Can't change your depression
As you realize that you're helpless
Do you mind if I suggest you let it burn?
Take it from a broken hearted scholar
Who would've bet my bottom dollar we would worked
But I considered lesson learned

(I know your heart is breaking down)
Can you feel the pain working?
(I bet you feel so lonely now)
And there's no one there to comfort you
(Because you cheat the one you call on)
And she left you all alone
(But the tears you shed you can count on)
But your tears won't let you down so cry, cry, cry

Cry, cry, cry, cry
Fill me up an ocean
Cry me up a river
Boy, I hope, I hope, I hope you feel so lonely
Bet you wanna call
Hope your nights are so cold
Cause you're missing my love
Got you love sick
Love sick
And you know I'm loving it
Listen closely
You can hear me laughing
You might also like
Sleep now baby
But when you wake up it'll be the same
You'll realize nothing's changed
To live in a state of agonizing pain
It won't last forever
But now it hurts like hell
I know it may be cold
But I, I still can't wish you well

(I know your heart is breaking down)
Can you feel the pain working?
(I bet you feel so lonely now)
And there's no one there to comfort you
(Because you cheat the one you call on)
No surprise she ain't there
(But the tears you shed you can count on)
But your tears won't let you down

Cry, cry, cry, cry
Fill me up an ocean
Cry me up a river
Boy, I hope, I hope, I hope you feel so lonely
Bet you wanna call
Hope your nights are so cold
Cause you're missing my love
Cry, cry, cry, cry
Fill me up an ocean
Cry me up a river
Boy, I hope, I hope, I hope you feel so lonely
Bet you wanna call
Hope your nights are so cold
Cause you're missing my love
I'm loving that you're hurting
I'm loving you feel pain
It's Karma
It's for certain
This time you're in the game
So glad that it's your tears
Hope that it takes time to heal
Yes, heartbreak is for real
Now you see how I feel

Cry, cry, cry, cry. (So won't you cry for me?)
Fill me up an ocean
Cry me up a river. (Fill me up a river)
Boy, I hope, I hope, I hope you feel so lonely. (Oh)
Bet you wanna call
Hope your nights are so cold. (I hope)
Cause you're missing my love. (I bet you miss me now)
Cry, cry, cry, cry. (Cry me)
Fill me up an ocean. (I know it hurts I understand)
Cry me up a river. (Oh)
Boy, I hope, I hope, I hope you feel so lonely. (Now feel my pain)(Lonely)
Bet you wanna call
Hope your nights are so cold. (Oh yeah)
