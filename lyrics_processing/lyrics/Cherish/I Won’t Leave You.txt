Everybody tryna to tell me that they think that you're no good
But I defend you 'til the end, I say that you're misunderstood
My family says that you're no right for me
They say that you're too hood
But I don't think that I would leave you, baby
Even if I could, could
I won't leave, leave you
Even though that they beg and plead for me to

No matter what my friends will say
I won't leave you
No matter what my family says
I won't leave you
No matter what you put me through
I won't leave you
No matter what you say, no matter what you do, boy
I won't leave you, ooh

I'll put everything on hold just so that I can come and see you
And the job I have to go if it stops me from being with you
Mama says that you should know
That I got better things to do
But what she don't understand
Is there's nothing better than you

I won't leave you (No matter what they say)
No matter what you say, no matter what you do, boy
I won't leave you, ooh

No, I won't leave
No, I won't leave
No, no, no

No matter what my family says

No matter what you say, no matter what you do, boy
