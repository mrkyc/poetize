Uh (Uh)
Yeah-yeah (Yeah-yeah)
Really wish I could (Really wish I could)

If only someone could unbreak my heart (Unbreak my heart)
Come relieve my pain (My pain)
If somehow I could wish up on a star
And make all of the memories go away

But my mind just keeps on goin' back
And I can't help but think about
That guy that gon' make me miss out on you (Miss out on you)
And I can't help but remember
'Bout that sad day in September
That day he took my heart with him when he left, ho

See, eventually I will get through this
But right now it seems my heart's in the way
I apologize for the way that I treat you
But I gotta leave you
Unless, somehow, I come across the case of amnesia
Amnesia, amnesia
(To forget, to forget, to forget the heartache)
Amnesia, amnesia, amnesia
(To forget, to forget, to forget the pain)
Amnesia, amnesia, amnesia
(It'll make, it'll make, it'll make things better)
I gotta leave you (Oh-oh, oh), I gotta leave you
You might also like
I tried to leave the past behind me
But it just hurts so bad, oh
And I told myself, "Please, don't cry
Let it go, and let the past be the past"

But my mind just keeps on goin' back
And I can't help but think about
That guy that gon' make me miss out on you (Miss out on you)
And I can't help to remember
'Bout that sad day in September
When you took my heart and just ran away, oh-oh

See, eventually I will get through this (I gotta get through it)
But right now it seems my heart's in the way (But it hurts so bad)
I apologize for the way that I treat you (For the way that I treat you)
But I gotta leave you (But I gotta leave you)
Unless, somehow, I come across the case of amnesia (Case of amnesia, oh)
Amnesia, amnesia
(To forget, to forget, to forget the heartache)
Amnesia, amnesia, amnesia (Oh-ooh, oh-ooh, oh, oh)
(To forget, to forget, to forget the pain)
Amnesia, amnesia, amnesia
(It'll make, it'll make, it'll make things better)
I gotta leave you (Oh-oh, oh), I gotta leave you (I gotta leave you)
Every time you try to get closer to me
I'm fallin' back 'cause I can't go down this road again
Memories won't go away, constantly in control of my life
I wanna erase it all
And forget about it all, ooh, yeah

See, eventually I will get through this
But right now it seems my heart's in the way (Heart's in the way, uh-oh)
I apologize for the way that I treat you (Let me apologize for the way that I treat you)
But I gotta leave you (But I gotta leave you)
Unless, somehow, I come across the case of amnesia (Oh, oh)
See, eventually I will get through this (Baby, one day I will)
But right now it seems my heart's in the way (But right now it's just too hard)
I apologize for the way that I treat you (And I apologize, never really meant to break your heart)
But I gotta leave you (But I gotta leave...)
Unless, somehow, I come across the case of amnesia
Amnesia, amnesia
(To forget, to forget, to forget the heartache)
Amnesia, amnesia, amnesia
(To forget, to forget, to forget the pain)
Amnesia, amnesia, amnesia
(It'll make, it'll make, it'll make things better)
