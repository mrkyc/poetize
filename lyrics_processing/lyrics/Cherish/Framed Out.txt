I jumped out the bed
Flat iron my hair
But in our true religon
I'm so far from peigon
And I hit the closet
Throw on my juicy coaches
Rock my shirt and my bra
Then head staight to the shake draw
Botaga, veneta, valentino, gucci, carde air, marc jacobs, prada
Dependin on how I feel today
Please belive I'm always chumped out
Stay up on my shade game
Yes sir
Frost out

Strut out the house(framed out)
Hop in the truck(framed out)
I hit the club(framed out)
Dats what's up(framed out)
See me all day(framed out)
See me all night(framed out)
I gotta be(framed out)
You know I stay(framed out)

Skj
My louis viton bag
Before I leave the store yo girl be poppin tags
And I gotta keep this pretty face all up in some dolce
And my cold shades look like a churned vanilla milkshake
The rock look(I got em)
The cop look(I got em)
Both them shades up in my hair
Then I grab another pair
Yours look fly but they ain't like these
Cus I don't keep nothing but designers on me
