Yo, this one of them ones
When it come on, it make you wanna say oh
You can't listen to this low, man
You gotta turn it up, you know what I'm sayin', oh
Yeah, Cherish
So So Def, y'all know, oh
This how it go, man, double O three
Felisha, holla at 'em, oh

If I walked up, and said what's up
Would you give me that look and act like you're tough?
As I walk back, would you give me the eye
Admire my strut, checkin' out my look?
See, you look like you be the type
That be gettin' numbers all night, night, night
From night, baby, that's alright
You be gettin' it, but so do I

You can call me M-I
Crooked letter, crooked letter, P-I-M-P (P-I-M-P)
I know you think you got game
But baby lemme tell you, you ain't got more than me (Got more than me)
You can call me M-I
Crooked letter, crooked letter, P-I-M-P (Ooh-ooh)
I know you think you got game
But baby lemme tell you, you ain't got more than me
You might also like
Sweetie, I'm no freak, so you won't have me
But I'll have you messed up with the words I speak
We can be just friends and you would catch feelings
You'll be callin' me up and you'll be checkin' it
I know this might sound like it's hype
But if I want you, boy, you'll be mine, mine, mine
One take, my conversation's tight
'Cause now I got you curious, right?

You can call me M-I (Oh)
Crooked letter, crooked letter, P-I-M-P (Hey-ey)
I know you think you got game
But baby lemme tell you, you ain't got more than me

Yeah, I'm in the C-H-E-R-I, crooked letter, H
And we don't play when it comes to
Pimpin' this music, pimpin' these tracks
Pimpin' this game until we get paid
And we gon' P-I-M-P this music industry
Until everyone knows our name
Felisha, Farrah, Fallon and Neosha's got you open
Till these vocals is what you gon' be sayin'
You can call me M-I (You can call me)
Crooked letter, crooked letter, P-I-M-P (Oh-oh)
I know you think you got game
But baby lemme tell you, you ain't got more than me (Oh)

Crooked letter, crooked letter, P-I-M-P (P-I-M-P)
I know you think you got game (Got game)
But baby lemme tell you, you ain't got more than me (More than me)

I cherish bein' a pimp, it ain't necessarily bad
I'm not embarrassed to demonstrate I party
They call me Miss Harris, favorite color is orange
Cherish is glowin', I'm church from my head to my toe and
It's obvious it's showin', 'cause I'm holdin' my color
Don't bother us when it's game time, every day flame time
This thing shine, I have no other choice but to blow your mind
I'm more soldier than the lieutenant
When it's cold, I'm in a drape into the floor
Chinchilla, I look good in it with the hood in it
Six hundred, wool in it, we runnin', get money
This honey ain't bullshittin', still wit it - funny, ain't it?
Your pimp show tainted, don't hate on me
Why don't you go and get you some, I'm sayin', my whole crew bangin'
We stay sharp as tack, it's J.D. and Brat
Pimpin' this industry to the max, believe that
You can call me M-I
Crooked letter, crooked letter, P-I-M-P
I know you think you got game
But baby lemme tell you, you ain't got more than me
You can call me M-I
Crooked letter, crooked letter, P-I-M-P
I know you think you got game
But baby lemme tell you, you ain't got more than me (You can call me)
You can call me M-I
Crooked letter, crooked letter, P-I-M-P (Oh)
I know you think you got game (You think you got game)
But baby lemme tell you, you ain't got more than me (Got more than me)
You can call me M-I
Crooked letter, crooked letter, P-I-M-P (P-I-M-P)
I know you think you got game
