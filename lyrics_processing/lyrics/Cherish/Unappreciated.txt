I'm feeling really unappreciated
You're takin' my love for granted, babe
And I don't know
How much more
I can take from you
You don't do the things you used to do
You don't even say I love you too
And lately, I've been feelin'
Feeling unappreciated

I woke up this morning and saw your face
And you didn't look the same as yesterday
I got the feeling that you can't seem to see
Where you wanna be
And lately, it ain't been the same at all
When you're here, it's like I'm invisible
I still can't seem to see
Where I went wrong, 'cause I'm feelin'

I'm feeling really unappreciated (Unappreciated)
You're takin' my love for granted, babe
And I don't know
How much more
I can take from you
You don't do the things you used to do
You don't even say I love you too
And lately, I've been feelin'
Feeling unappreciated

Lately, our house is not a home
You come in, take a shower, then say "I'm gone"
What am I to do when my heart says leave
But my feet won't move?
And today is our anniversary
And you haven't even said two words to me
I'm tryin' hard to give you another chance
But ooh baby, I'm feelin'

I'm feeling really unappreciated
You're takin' my love for granted, babe (Takin' my love)
And I don't know
How much more (How much more)
I can take from you
You don't do the things you used to do
You don't even say I love you too
And lately, I've been feelin' (I've been feelin')
Feeling unappreciated

Boy, when I first met you
I thought that you was the most perfect man
That I'd ever seen
And I still don't understand why
You treat me like you do
I used to give into your lust
But now I see the truth
Oh, no, I don't wanna hear it all through
Yeah, I know I'll still be missin' you
But it's not worth the pain that
I've gained from you
You made me feel unappreciated
I'm feeling really unappreciated (Unappreciated)
You're takin' my love for granted, babe (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
And I don't know
How much more
I can take from you (Ooh)
You don't do the things you used to do
You don't even say I love you too (I love you too)
And lately, I've been feelin'
Feeling unappreciated

Don't love me no more
Hey-ay, whoa-hoo-oh
I'm really feelin'
Unappreciated
Oh-whoa
