It's been a while since we been together
But I admit that I get jealous whenever I see you
With another girl
And I know our thing has ended
But I don't want you with other women
Oh, it hurts so deep
It really gets to me

I can't
See you with nobody else
Even if I can't have you for myself
I'm just not with it, no
I can't
See you with nobody else
I bet that those girls can't make you feel
Like I did, oh-ooh

If I see you 'round town with another girl
I'm hatin'
In your passenger seat, it better be me (Hating)
With you at a movie, it better be me (Better be me)
With you walking the street, it better be me (Better be me)
See you 'round town with another girl
I'm hatin'
In your passenger seat, it better be me (Ye-eah)
With you at a movie, it better be me (Better be me)
With you walking the street, it better be me (Be me)

Oh, he zoning off again
But even when we're off you're still my man
'Cause baby in my mind
I'm your only girlfriend
It may be wrong but I don't care
You can see no one else
Boy, I dare a girl to step to you
They don't wanna go there

I can't
See you with nobody else
Even if I can't have you for myself
I'm just not with it
I can't
See you with nobody else
I bet that those girls can't make you feel
They way I did, ooh yeah

If I see you 'round town with another girl
I'm hatin'
In your passenger seat, it better be me (Hating)
With you at a movie, it better be me (Better be me)
With you walking the street, it better be me (Better be me)
See you 'round town with another girl
I'm hatin'
In your passenger seat, it better be me (Ye-eah)
With you at a movie, it better be me (Better be me)
