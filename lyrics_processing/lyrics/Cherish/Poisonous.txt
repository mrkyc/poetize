Just one look, a glance or stare
A simple smile just sittin' there
One symbol tossed at my hair
I'll have you mesmerized
I'll make you fall so deep in love
You never ever get enough
So, you'll never won't be low enough
You're drawn with my simple touch

Boy, I'm dangerous to love
I'm just wanting you to
Let you know that the
Feeling that you're feeling is not
Love, it may be
Lust or something else
Because you should know I'm
Poisonous

Slick as a snake (A snake)
Sneak like a thief (A thief)
Here to tell you, baby
You can't handle me (Handle me)
Hot like fire (Fire)
Heart as cold as ice (As ice)
Boys, beware of me
'Cause I ain't nothin' nice (So poisonous)
You might also like
When you take one look at me
You'll be amazed at what you see
You won't believe your eyes, baby
I'll creep until you're mine
Like a black widow, I strike
Your dream of me, I'll creep at night
Don't you move and I won't bite
I might just creep away because I'm

Oh, boy, I'm dangerous to love
I'm wanting you to
Let you know that the
Feeling that you're feeling is not
Love, it may be
Lust or something else
Because you should know
I'm poisonous

Slick as a snake (Snake)
Sneak like a thief
Here to tell you, baby
You can't handle me (Handle me)
Hot like fire (Fire)
Heart as cold as ice (Cold as ice)
Boys, beware of me
'Cause I ain't nothin' nice (Nothin' nice)
They say desperation can give you damage
Don't get too close, it's a conspiracy, most likely
You try to get in, fit in, and do the do
Not thinking other things wrong I can do with you
But fact one, you open your heart, I'll let you down
And fact two, you think I'm faithful and I sleep around
And fact three, how about I warn you in advance
Show the real person that I can and that I am

Slick as a snake (Oh, oh)
Sneak like a thief (Like a thief)
Here to tell you, baby
You can't handle me (Handle me)
Hot like fire (Fire)
Heart as cold as ice (Cold as ice)
Boys, beware of me
'Cause I ain't nothin' nice (Nothin' nice)
Slick as a snake (Oh)
Sneak like a thief (Oh)
Here to tell you, baby
You can't handle me (Handle me)
Hot like fire (Fire)
Heart as cold as ice (I'm dangerous)
Boys, beware of me
'Cause I ain't nothin' nice (And it's all because I'm poisonous)
Slick as a snake
Sneak like a thief
Here to tell you, baby
You can't handle me
Hot like fire (Fire)
Heart as cold as ice (Ice)
Boys, beware of me
'Cause I ain't nothin' nice

I'm poisonous
I'm poisonous
I'm poisonous
I'm poisonous
