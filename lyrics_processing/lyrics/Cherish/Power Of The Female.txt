We coming through
And anything you can do, we can do too
We wanna let y'all know
We ain't gonna stop
And that we're here
We're headed for the top
Haven't you heard new time, new day and age
New place
What you say, it don't mean a thing
'Cause we're coming and we funk
And ya know we won't stop
We're females and we're hot
And taking the number-one spot
And some guys seem to think that they are so clever
We can do what they cannot better
We're ladies and we're here to stay
On ya forever
But ya don't wanna hear us when we say

Yes, I'm a girl
But that don't mean
That I will not succeed
So go ahead and hate on me
But I'm just where you wanna be
Yes, I'm a girl
But that don't mean
That I will not succeed
So go ahead and hate on me
But I'm just where you wanna be
I've got the power of the female
You might also likeAnd if you only knew
The things we go through
You will see too
I work just as hard as you do
But believe
I can achieve anything I put my mind to
It's a new day
And age
New place
What you say, it don't mean a thing
'Cause we're coming and we funk
And ya know we won't stop
We're females and we're hot
And taking the number-one spot
And some guys think that they are so clever
We can do what they cannot better
We're ladies and we're here to stay
On ya forever
But ya don't wanna hear us when we say

And once we hit the top?
