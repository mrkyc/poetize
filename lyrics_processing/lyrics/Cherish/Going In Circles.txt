See, I'm talking but you're not listening
Feels like we're losing ground
And I think I just need my distance
Or I'm really gonna lose my mind
I don't even wanna talk no more
Tell me what do you take me for
You don't even wanna date no more
I just can't take no more

Can the DJ please drown the sound?
Can we keep these shots goin' round, round, round?
Can we turn the music up real loud?
Can you give me something to just drown me out?
'Cause I can't figure it out

No matter what we try (try)
We end up going in circles (in circles)
It's like we can't get by (get by)
Keep on going in circles (in circles)
Trying to make sense out of every word, every word
No direction, we're a flightless bird, flightless bird
Ooohh, how can we fly?
Ooohh, how can we fly?
Ooohh, how can we fly?
Ooohh, how can we fly?

I don't know the stranger that's laying in my bed
And our conversations keep re-pe-peated
I hope these lights and these flashes can you keep outta my head
'Cause just for tonight I just don't ne-ne-need it

Can the DJ please drown the sound?
Can we keep these shots goin' round, round, round?
Can we turn the music up real loud?
Can you give me something to just drown me out?
'Cause I can't figure it out

No matter what we try (try)
We end up going in circles (in circles)
It's like we can't get by, (get by)
Keep on going in circles (in circles)
Trying to make sense out of every word, every word
No direction, we're a flightless bird, flightless bird
Ooohh, how can we fly?
Ooohh, how can we fly?
Ooohh, how can we fly?
Ooohh, how can we fly?

I thought that what we found (I thought what we had, I thought that you)
You would hold me down (You'd hold me down)
But you won't hear me out (I know you'll never change)
