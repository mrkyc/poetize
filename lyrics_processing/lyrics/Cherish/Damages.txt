Or forgot to tell the time
Judgin by the way u came in
But today I woke up on the wrong side
U should check the? side
You'll see that I cleaned out ya closet
It seems like u wanna go
So I'm a let u go
So let me help u out &, I'll walk u to the door
U shoulda left a long time ago
There's nothin left for me to start all over
No more tryin to fix what's unfixable
No need to try and cure the impossible
So do what u want to
U can choose what u want to
If u tryed to loose me then it worked cus the damage is done...
The damage the damage, the damage is done 
Bet you thought that when u left id cry
Truth it baby I'm fine
Happy that I got rid of you
Go ahead and leave the keys to my ride
Cab is waitin outside
Once again I'm way ahead of u
You might also likeI kno u wanna go
So I'm a let u go
I'll do jus fine without u
Already movin on
I shoulda left a long time ago
But it's not too late to start all over
No more tryin to fix what's unfixable
No need to try and cure the impossible
So do what u want to
U can choose who u want to
If u tryed to loose me then it worked cus the damage is done...
The damage the damage, the, the damage is done 
No more tryin to fix what's unfixable
No need to try and cure the impossible
So do what u want to
U can choose who u want to
If u tryed to loose me then it worked cus the damage is done...
The damage the damage, the, the damage is done
