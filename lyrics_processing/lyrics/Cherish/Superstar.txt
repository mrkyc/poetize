Don't have to take my hair out of my ponytail
Don't have to change my style up or come out the clothes I wear
Because of you I'm able to get through the stormy weather
You know the words to say just to make my day go better

Anything that I do
I know I'll always be beautiful to you
Thought I had all my senses but you gave me touch
Without you I wouldn't know love

I know when I come home I'm your superstar
Even if no records were sold I'm your superstar
No matter the time I know always through your eyes
I'll remain a superstar

No need to put on make up just cause you came around
Don't have to hide my tears from you whenever I feel down
No one else makes me feel the way you do you're so good to me
And I'm still alive and I know that that's because of my baby

Anything that I do
I know I'll always be beautiful to you
Thought I had all my senses but you gave me touch
Without you I wouldn't know love
You might also like
I know when I come home I'm your superstar
Even if no records were sold I'm your superstar
No matter the time I know always through your eyes
I'll remain a superstar

I'll give my heart, I give my heart, my soul, my all to you
And I promise to never leave you
I'll give all my love to you
And promise to stand by you forever and ever

Anything that I do
I know I'll always be beautiful to you
Thought I had all my senses but you gave me touch
Without you I wouldn't know love

I know when I come home I'm your superstar
Even if no records were sold I'm your superstar
No matter the time I know always through your eyes
