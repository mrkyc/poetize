Yo, ladies and gentlemen
What we have here today
Is the official 2006 women's anthem
Cherish
And I go by the name of Don Vito
But this time, I brought a special friend along
Yo, Brat, let's go

When I say I love you, you say ditto
And I can't settle for that, hell to the n-itt-o
It's so much better for Brat, so I gotta get off
Find somebody that's tryin' to supply love near though
It's been a long time since I lay my head on your pillow
I know you pokin' some hoe, creepin' on the l-itt-ow
And I ain't dumb though, with my heart numb though
Come from 6-0-6, 4 to the f-itt-our, yeah

I woke up this morning and saw your face
And you didn't look the same as yesterday
I got the feeling that you can't seem to see
Where you wanna be
And lately, it ain't been the same at all
When you're here, it's like I'm invisible
I still can't seem to see
Where I went wrong, 'cause I'm feelin'
You might also like
I'm feeling really unappreciated (Unappreciated)
You're takin' my love for granted, babe
And I don't know
How much more
I can take from you
You don't do the things you used to do
You don't even say I love you too
And lately, I've been feelin'
Feeling unappreciated

Lately, our house is not a home
You come in, take a shower, then say "I'm gone"
What am I to do when my heart says leave
But my feet won't move?
And today is our anniversary
And you haven't even said two words to me
I'm tryin' hard to give you another chance
But ooh baby, I'm feelin'

I'm feeling really unappreciated
You're takin' my love for granted, babe (Takin' my love)
And I don't know
How much more (How much more)
I can take from you
You don't do the things you used to do
You don't even say I love you too
And lately, I've been feelin' (I've been feelin')
Feeling unappreciated
Yo, when I'm in the mood for love
I don't get kisses and hugs
When I wanna hoo-hoo, you don't even get me no dubs
I don't know what happened to us
We used to be happy so much
But lately, I've been plottin' the ways of effin' you up
So I'm leavin', midnight plane to Georgia this evening
Red-eyed, 'cause I'm tired of weeping
Yes, I need relief, so I've been gettin' really inebriated
And daddy ain't even alleviate it

I'm feeling really unappreciated (Unappreciated)
You're takin' my love for granted, babe (Oh, oh-oh)
And I don't know
How much more
I can take from you (Ooh)
You don't do the things you used to do
You don't even say I love you too (I love you too)
And lately, I've been feelin'
Feeling unappreciated (Don't love me no more)

Hey-ay, whoa-hoo-oh
I'm really feelin'
Unappreciated
Oh-whoa
I'm feelin' unappreciated
Yeah, baby, whoo
It's your girl Brat-tat-tat
Don Vito on the track
And it's Cherish, baby
And we all been feelin' really unappreciated
So, what you need to do is step your game, you dick
'Cause it's So So Def for life
I got it tattooed, and it tattooed, and it tattooed, and it tattooed on me
