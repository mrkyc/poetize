Now, baby, sit back and let me relax your mind
No hurry, baby, we have all the time in the world
Let's play our parts like we are in a movie (Movie)
Tonight it's whatever, don't be afraid to put your hands on me

Baby, get inside my brain
Make me never ever feel the same
I don't even wanna know your name
Just make sure you make it worth it
Now we're dripping sweat like rain
So hot we can spark a flame
So good I wanna run away
So baby won't you make me

Baby make me
Run like a felon (felon)
Scream like I'm hurt (I'm hurt)
Reach like I'm fallin' (Fallin')
Stuck on my words (My words)
Cry like I'm lonely (Lonely)
Losin' my breath (My breath)
Shake like I'm nervous (Nervous)
Gaspin' for air
We gon' bump like some speakers
Bump like some speakers
Bump like some speakers
Bump like some speakers
Bump like some speakers
Bump like some speakers
Bump like some speakers
Bump like some speakers

We're getting ready for another round
So impatient, baby, I just want it now - I can't wait
Let me know when you are ready to go down (Down)
Ooh, what you do to me, I swear it feels like I'm dreamin'

Baby, get inside my brain
Make me never ever feel the same
I don't even wanna know your name
Just make sure you make it worth it
Now we're dripping sweat like rain
So hot we can spark a flame
So good I wanna run away
Oh baby won't you just make me

Baby make me
Run like a felon (felon)
Scream like I'm hurt (I'm hurt)
Reach like I'm fallin' (Fallin')
Stuck on my words (My words)
Cry like I'm lonely (Lonely)
Losin' my breath (My breath)
Shake like I'm nervous (Nervous)
Gaspin' for air
We gon' bump like some speakers
Bump like some speakers
Bump like some speakers
Bump like some speakers
Bump like some speakers
Bump like some speakers
Bump like some speakers
Bump like some speakers
Heart's beating faster and faster
But please don't slow down, slow down
So fascinating, amazing
How you put it down and down

Baby make me
Run like a felon (felon)
Scream like I'm hurt (I'm hurt)
Reach like I'm fallin' (Fallin')
Stuck on my words (My words)
