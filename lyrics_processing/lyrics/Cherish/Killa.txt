Yo, Joc
Yeah?
I don't think they're ready for this one
Cherish
They make me wanna lose control
Yeah, y'all know who it is
Show love
I'm in a wife-beater, two-seater, cruise control
Pull up and your girl might lose control
Not Playaz Circle but a Duffel Bag Boy
Guaranteed they can't get enough of that boy

Saw him from a distance and I watched him make his way to the bar
He walked up to me slowly, whispers and he says, "I know who you are
I wanna get to know you"

I can tell he was a player, but he knows just how to make ya lose control
Somehow I knew

Shorty is a killa, but I really want him
And I gotta have him tonight
Straight heartbreaker, but it really don't matter
'Cause I really want him tonight
You might also like
The way he licks his lips, I'm in an infatuated state of mind, oh yeah
He's so hard to resist, I gotta tell you, baby boy, you so fine
Just gotta have you, oh, yeah

I can tell he was a player, but he knows just how to make ya lose control
If you only knew

That shorty is a killa, but I really want him (But I really want him)
And I gotta have him tonight (And I gotta have him)
Straight heartbreaker, but it really don't matter
'Cause I really want him tonight (Tonight)
Shorty is a killa, but I really want him
And I gotta have him tonight
Straight heartbreaker, but it really don't matter (Heartbreaker)
'Cause I really want him tonight ('Cause I really want him tonight)

Oh, it feels so wrong that it must, it must be right
And I'm so high, don't wanna come down
Just let me fly

Hey, hey, let me talk to 'em
My whips push buttons, no car keys, man
Pop the top like a sardine can
Wrist stay flooded like New Orleans, man
LeBron can't stop how I be ballin', man
Yeah, I'm pretty sure that you heard the rumors
Got big wood and some big cahunas
I'm a pretty slick nigga like Rick the Ruler
Keep one eye open and my hand on that Ruger
I rock the Claudio, my shades Cazal
I break hearts, Heartbreak Hotel
I treat your chick like a pair of Ones
Wear that ass out one good time and short
Shorty is a killa, but I really want him (Shorty is a killa, oh)
And I gotta have him tonight (Tonight)
Straight heartbreaker, but it really don't matter (Straight heartbreaker, but it really don't matter)
'Cause I really want him tonight (Oh, baby, tonight)
Shorty is a killa, but I really want him (I want you, baby, gotta have you, baby)
And I gotta have him tonight (Even if it's wrong, tonight I gotta have you)
Straight heartbreaker, but it really don't matter (Oh-oh)
'Cause I really want him tonight ('Cause I really want you)
