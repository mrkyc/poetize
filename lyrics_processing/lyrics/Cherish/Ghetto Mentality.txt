I knew this guy from ATL, Georgia
Said he wanted to be a judge when he grew up
Had a good life, living up in the suburbs
Doing his thing, just tryna make a come up
But one day things began to make a bad change
His father left, then his mother had to maintain
Moved to the ghetto, joined the gang and began to slang
Now he found himself caught up in the game

What can you gain from making up your own rules?
A major change from the things that he used to do
Then he even stopped praying like he used to
Now he doing what he thinks that he gotta do

Now his boys is the only thing that he needs
And Mary Jane is his only necessity
His state of mind is his only captivity
And now he has to face reality
And his mentality
For what he did for the will of stability
His life changed so physically, mentally
He didn't mean to go through this intentionally
Now he has to face reality
And the ghetto, ghetto mentality

Seventeen with a baby mama
Now he's trapped in a life that's full of drama
Still thinking he can do what he wanna
But he gotta live for his son 'cause he's still a father
Now he's trying to make money the best way he can
Trapping on the streets, thinking that he the man
Dude is blind, he still can't understand
How much his life is getting outta hand

What can you gain from making up your own rules?
A major change from the things that he used to do
Then he even stopped praying like he used to
Now he doing what he thinks that he gotta do

Now his boys is the only thing that he needs
And Mary Jane is his only necessity
His state of mind is his only captivity
And now he has to face reality
And his mentality
For what he did for the will of stability
His life changed so physically, mentally
He didn't mean to go through this intentionally
Now he has to face reality
And the ghetto, ghetto mentality
What would you do if you gave the world to lose your soul?
Can you relate, can you hear the message in these words?
I got the feeling and I know you care, and I
I wanna know if you'll take the cha-ance
'Cause trust me, boy, this is not the end
If you don't hear the truth then we'll talk again

Now his boys is the only thing that he needs
And Mary Jane is his only necessity
His state of mind is his only captivity
And now he has to face reality
And his mentality
For what he did for the will of stability
His life changed so physically, mentally
He didn't mean to go through this intentionally
Now he has to face reality
