Every day, I hear your problems
Talking about your girlfriends
Boy, I'd solve them
If you gave me a chance to be much more than your friend
Baby, open up your heart and let me in
See, what I'm feeling didn't just happen
Felt it for years but I just wasn't telling
So tell me could you be feeling what I'm feeling for you
And if you are, baby, let's make that move

All I ever do is think about you, day and night
We need to be more than friends, you and I
I wanna be
I wanna be
I wanna be your girl
Nothing more that I want in this world
I just wanna be your girl
I wanna be your girl

So what you think?
What you think about me and you hooking up, being serious about this thing, babe
Before you even speak
Open ya eyes and see, there's no girl better for you than me
See, I know you inside out
I don't have any doubt
The time for us is right here, right now
You know we always have fun whenever we are together
And I only see things getting better and better
You might also like
All I ever do is think about you, day and night
We need to be more than friends, you and I
I wanna be
I wanna be
I wanna be your girl
Nothing more that I want in this world
I just wanna be your girl
I wanna be your girl

I wanna give you my all
I wanna be your friend, your girl, your everthing
I wanna be the one you call
Whenever you are feeling lonely
You make me laugh, I make you smile
It could be worth your while
Oh, baby, oh, darling
Just give our love a try

All I ever do is think about you, day and night
We need to be more than friends, you and I
I wanna be
I wanna be
I wanna be your girl
Nothing more that I want in this world
I just wanna be your girl
