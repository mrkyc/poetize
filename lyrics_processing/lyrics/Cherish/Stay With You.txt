What I'm gon' do
Sometimes I love you
Sometimes I hate you
But I stay with you
Baby, I stay with you

You tick me off
Every other day it's somethin' that you say
That just gets under my skin
Then we start arguing
But I still love you, boy
No matter what you do, I stay with you
I've caught you out with other women
And I'm always forgiving

Has to be the one
Cause even when you mess up
I'm still giving you my love
You got me sprung
Get my head messed up, I don't know what i want
'Cause even when I say I'm through
One day and then I'm back with you
I'm so confused
About what I'm gonna do
You might also like
What I'm gon' do?
Sometimes I love you
Sometimes I hate you
But I stay with you
Baby, I stay with you
What I'm gon' do?
'Cause when I try to walk away
I can't forget you
I stay with you

Don't know what it is
That gives you control of my body and soul
Sometimes you treat me so cold, cold
But I just can't let you go, go
'Cause you just flipped the script
The sweetest words come from your lips
First you'll be cool then you trip, trip
Every day you act different

Has to be the one
Cause even when you mess up
I'm still giving you my love
You got me sprung
Get my head messed up, I don't know what i want
Cause even when I say I'm through
One day and then I'm back with you
I'm so confused
About what I'm gonna do
What I'm gon' do?
Sometimes I love you
Sometimes I hate you
But I stay with you
Baby, I stay with you
What I'm gon' do?
'Cause when I try to walk away
I can't forget you
I stay with you

La, la, la, la, la la
La, la, la, la, la la
Stay with you
No matter what it is that you do
La, la, la, la, la la
La, la, la, la, la la
I stay with you
I try to leave but cannot move

What I'm gon' do?
Sometimes I love you
Sometimes I hate you
But I stay with you
Baby, I stay with you
What I'm gon' do?
'Cause when I try to walk away
I can't forget you
