Oh, yeah, no

The feeling that I'm feelin' when I'm with you
It feels so good, it can't be good
The passion when we grabbin when I'm near ya
It's always good

Until everything come
Crash crash crash crash crashing down
Tears hang hate love all around
We can't reach a common ground
We'll never work it out

Oh we got to let go
It's not working no more
Oh you need to just go
Cause you will be my self destruction
Oh we got to let go
Can't go back down that road
Cause I'm grown and I know
That you will be my self destruction
My self destruction
You might also like
Where good when we are good
But when we're not
It's real bad, it's real bad
The moment when I come down from the high
I know we'll never last

Because it all comes
Crash crash crash crash crashing down
Tears hang hate love all around
We can't reach a common ground
We'll never work it out

Oh we got to let go
It's not working no more
Oh you need to just go
Cause you will be my self destruction
Oh we got to let go
Can't go back down that road
Cause I'm grown and I know
That you will be my self destruction
My self destruction

No my heart can't take no more of (you, you, you)
Oh I just might self destruct on (you, you, you)
No I just can't take no more of (you, you, you)
Oh I just might self destruct on (you, you, you)
Oh we got to let go
It's not working no more
Oh you need to just go
Cause u will be my self destruction
Oh we got to let go
Can't go back down that road
Cause I'm grown and I know
That you will be my self destruction
