We were sitting at the table
We were talking 'bout some thangs
Conversating on what's been going on lately
He moved in a little further
Said "Baby, come a little closer
There is something that I want you to know"
And then he said

Whenever you wanna get down
I'll be around
'Cause I'm in no hurry
Again he said
Whenever you felling the mood to let me love you
I'll be here for you
Huhn huhn uhn huhn
Huhn huhn uhn huhn
Huhn huhn uhn huhn
Huhn huhn uhn huhn
Huhn uhn huhn un huhn uhn

I put my hair behind my ear
Thinking if what I heard was clear
Turned my head thinking 'bout what I should say
Then he said "Before you speak
You're the only one for me
Baby I'm here for you whenever your ready"
All while he speaks
Thoughts start to creep
I start to think
About the things
In time we could do
And then he said
You might also like
Whenever you wanna get down (Get down)
I'll be around (I'll be around)
'Cause I'm in no hurry (No hurry)
Again he said (Whenever)
Whenever you felling the mood to let me love you (The mood, let me love you)
I'll be here for you (I'll be here for you, baby)
Huhn huhn uhn huhn
Huhn huhn uhn huhn (Yeah, yeah)
Huhn huhn uhn huhn
Huhn huhn uhn huhn
Huhn uhn huhn un huhn uhn

Whenever the time, whenever the place (Oh, baby, baby)
Baby just call or hit me on my two way
Baby I'm down for whatever you say (Naa)
It's all for you
And then he said

Whenever you wanna get down (Get down)
I'll be around (I'll be around, my baby)
'Cause I'm in no hurry (No hurry)
Whenever you felling the mood to let me love you (The mood, to let me love you, to let me love you)
I'll be here for you (And then he said)
Whenever you wanna get down (You wanna get down, baby)
I'll be around (I'll be around, my baby)
'Cause I'm in no hurry (Whenever)
Whenever you felling the mood to let me love you (Love you, love you, love you, to let me love you, to let me love you)
