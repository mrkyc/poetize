(Chorus)
Treat me like ya Chevy
You can show me off
You can let my top back
Any time you want it
Baby come and shine me
Hit the gas slow
Crank up my ignition
Take me for a roll
(Verse 1)
Take her to the spot
Take her to the club
Sexy wood grain wheels sittin' on dubs
You can keep it gangsta
'Cause she ain't no wanksta
Seat laid back
And I ride with a lean
Give me that treatment
You know what I mean
Might hit the chrome ooh man it gleams
Sexiest thing on the block, that you seen
Oooo, ooh ooh ooh ooh
I know you wanna taste this candy paint
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
But you can't go far
Less you fill the tank
Comin' down. Swerving lanes. In reverse
Watch me do my thang
I'm about to make my body sang
Vroom vroom vroom vroom
You might also like(Chorus (2x))
(Verse 2)
Baby wusup. Do you wanna ride
Put me in gear. From 3rd to 5
Watch me do it (do it)
While you get into it (to it)
Turn on the radio
Play slow jams. Junk in the trunk
Got 'em saying damn
Put your ride in my cam
Rev me up. Like I know you can
Oooh ooh ooh ooh
I know you wanna taste this candy paint
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
But you can't go far
(Un) Less you fill the tank
Comin down. Swerving lanes. In reverse
Watch me do my thang
I'm about to make ny body sang
(Chorus (2x))
I'm about to make my body sang (hey)
I'm about to make my body sang (hey)
I'm about to make my body sang (oh oh oh oh)
I'm about to make my body sang
Treat me like a Chevy baby
Do me like you want to baby
Come on, come on, come on, come on
