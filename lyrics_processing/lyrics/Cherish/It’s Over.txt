But I broke all my chains and opened my eyes, yeah

Now I can finally blow the candles out
Finally close up curtains now
'Cause it's over
Baby, it's over now
And now I can finally put on my shoes
I found the courage to break from you
'Cause it's over
And baby, I know it now

Baby, I'm free now
Free to be me now
I can breathe now
I wash my hands off you

In everything, I put you first

Free to be me now (Free to be me now)
I can breathe now (I can breathe again)
I wash my hands off you

All the ladies that feel the same
Throw up ya hands and sang with me
Tell him it's over (It's over, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, it's over)
To all the fellas that can relate
Forget your girl and say the same
Tell her it's over (It's over, it's over now, it's over)
