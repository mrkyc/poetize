You're in my dreams
Tomorrow you will still be in my dreams
And I need someone like you on my team, yeah
I'll follow your lead, yeah
If it's a fight
That I'm in for to have you in my life
Then let it be, yeah
Prepare the calvary, yeah

And if I get to be so lucky
And fortunate for what I want
I swear to treat you like no other
Like you're the only one

As if you were the last man on earth
Pour into your love
More can't get enough
Of your love, of your touch
Treat you like the last man on earth
I will show I'm worthy of your precious love
Want your love
I need your love
You might also like
So be mine
If you just want to be happy all the time
Deserve to shine
Show the world your resonating line

And I swear if I get to be so lucky
And fortunate for what I want
I swear to treat you like no other
Like you're the only one

As if you were the last man on earth
Pour into your love
More can't get enough
Of your love, of your touch
Treat you like the last man on earth
I will show I'm worthy of
Your precious love
Want your love, I need your love

You're all I want
All I need
All I think about
Can't get you out of my head
There's no end to how you make me feel
So pure, so unreal
And I swear, if I get to be so lucky
And fortunate for what I want
I swear to treat you like no other
Like you're the only one

As if you were the last man on earth
Pour into your love
More can't get enough
Of your love, of your touch
Treat you like the last man on earth
I will show I'm worthy of
Your precious love
Want your love
