I saw a billboard 'bout this rodeo
Last weekend out in El Paso
So I signed up to ride
I drew a bull called Original Sin
I heard he'd killed a couple of men
I figured this was somethin' I could win
Cause the devil was on my side
I was havin' myself one hell of a ride
But I ended up disqualified
That danged old bull just up and died
Before they blew the whistle
When I got them north Texas blues
Thought I'd paid all my dues
Then them south Texas blues
Told me son you ain't through
Had them east Texas blues
And them west Texas too
I've done all I know to do
Tryin' to lose, tryin' to lose
These lone star blues
Got laid off at Brown & Root
Then on my way back to Cut and Shoot
Lost my wristwatch and my boots
Shootin' dice with a dude from Houston

So I got on part time haulin' gravel
With some outfit from Seattle
Down here buildin' custom homes
When I got them north Texas blues
Thought I'd paid all my dues
Then them south Texas blues
Told me son you ain't through
Had them east Texas blues
And them west Texas too
I've done all I know to do
Tryin' to lose, tryin' to lose
These lone star blues
Gassed my truck and packed my clothes
Turned in my key and hit the road
I said Cowtown's where I'll go
You never know I might get lucky
Got a friend there turning knobs
At a place called Billy Bob's
He said he could get me a job there
Workin' as a bouncer
First night on the job was just insane
Some ol' boy got all deranged
Hit me in the head with a Harley chain
To this day my ears still ring
When I got them north Texas blues
Thought I'd paid all my dues
Then them south Texas blues
Told me son you ain't through
Had them east Texas blues
And them west Texas too
I've done all I know to do
Tryin' to lose, tryin' to lose
