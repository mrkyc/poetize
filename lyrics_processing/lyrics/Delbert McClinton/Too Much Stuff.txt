Houseboat won't float. Bank won't tote the note
Too much stuff. There's just too much stuff
It'll hang you up dealing with too much stuff
Hangin' out on the couch puttin' on the pounds
Better walk, run, jump, swim. Try to hold it down
You're eatin' too much stuff, too much stuff
It'll wear you down, carrying around too much stuff
Hundred dollar cab ride, fogged in, can't fly
Greyhound, Amtrak, oughta bought a Cadillac
Too much stuff. Too much stuff
It'll slow you down, fooling with too much stuff
Well, it's way too much
You're never gonna get enough
You can pile it high
But you'll never be satisfied
Rent-a-tux, shiny shoes, backstage, big schmooze
Vocal group can't sing, won awards for everything
Too much stuff. Too much stuff
They just keep on going, rolling in all that stuff
Got hurt, can't work, got a lot o' bills
But the policy don't pay 'less I get killed
Too much stuff. Too much stuff
Just my luck, counting on too much stuff
You might also likeWell, it's way too much
You're never gonna get enough
You can pile it high
But you'll never be satisfied
Running back can't score till he gets a million more
Quarterback can't pass. Owner wants his money back
Too much stuff. Too much stuff
You know, you can't get a grip when you're slipping in all that stuff
Women every which-a-way messing with my mind
You know, I fall in love every day three or four times
Too much stuff. Too much stuff
It'll mess you up, fooling with too much stuff
Yeah, too much stuff. Too much stuff
Too much stuff. Too much stuff
You never get enough 'cause there's just too much stuff
You know you can hurt yourself, fooling with too much stuff
