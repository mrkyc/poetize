I don't know why I love you like I do
After all them changes you've been puttin' me through
You stole my money and my cigarettes
And I ain't seen hide nor hair of you yet

I wanna know, oh, won't you tell me
Tell me how, how could I stay here with you
Somebody please

Take me to the river, and wash me down
Take me to the river
And put my feet back on the ground
Now looka here

I don't know why you treat me so bad
After of all them good times that you and me had
Love is an emotion that I can't forget
My sweet sixteen keeps my mind in a mess

I wanna know, oh, won't you tell me
Tell me how, how could I stay here with you
Somebody help me
You might also like
Take me to the river, and wash me down
Just take me to the river
And put my feet back on the ground

Oh, love me, squeeze me, hold me
And baby, you can tease me
'Til I can't take no more, woo


I don't know why I love you like I do
After all them changes you've puttin' me through
Your pretty picture makes my teardrops fall
I wonder who's the biggest fool of us all

I wanna know, oh, won't you tell me
Tell me how, how can I stay here were you
Somebody help me

Take me to the river, and wash me down
Take me to the river
And put my feet back on the ground
Take me to the river, and wash me down
Yeah, take me to the river
And put my feet back on the ground
Take me to the river, and wash me down
Just take me to the river
