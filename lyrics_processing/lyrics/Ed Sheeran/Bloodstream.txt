Na-na-na-na
Mmm

I've been spinnin' now for time
Couple women by my side
I got sinnin' on my mind
Sippin' on red wine
I've been sittin' here for ages
Rippin' out the pages
How'd I get so faded?
How'd I get so faded?

Oh, no, no, don't leave me lonely now
If you loved me, how'd you never learn?
Ooh, coloured crimson in my eyes
One or two could free my mind

This is how it ends
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
Fading out again
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
So tell me when it kicks in

Well, tell me when it kicks in

I've been lookin' for a lover
Thought I'd find her in a bottle
God, make me another one
I'll be feeling this tomorrow
Lord, forgive me for the things I've done
I was never meant to hurt no one
And I saw scars upon a broken-hearted lover

Oh, no, no, don't leave me lonely now
If you loved me, how'd you never learn?
Ooh, coloured crimson in my eyes
One or two could free my mind

This is how it ends
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
Fading out again
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
So tell me when it kicks in

Well, tell me when it kicks in
Tell me when it kicks in
All the voices in my mind
Callin' out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Callin' out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Callin' out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Callin' out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Callin' out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Callin' out across the line
All the voices in my mind (Tell me when it kicks in)
Callin' out across the line (And I saw scars upon her)
All the voices in my mind (Tell me when it kicks in)
Callin' out across the line (Brokenhearted)
All the voices in my mind (Tell me when it kicks in)
Callin' out across the line (And I saw scars upon her)
All the voices in my mind (Tell me when it kicks in)
Callin' out across the line (Brokenhearted)
All the voices in my mind (Tell me when it kicks in)
Callin' out across the line (And I saw scars upon her)
All the voices in my mind (Tell me when it kicks in)
Callin' out across the line (Brokenhearted)
All the voices in my mind (Tell me when it kicks in)
Callin' out across the line (And I saw scars upon her)
All the voices in my mind (Tell me when it kicks in)
Callin' out across the line (Brokenhearted)
So, tell me when it kicks in
And I saw scars upon her
Tell me when it kicks in
Brokenhearted
And tell me when it kicks in
And I saw scars upon her
Tell me when it kicks in
