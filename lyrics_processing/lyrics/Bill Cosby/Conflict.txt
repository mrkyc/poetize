Justice, revenge for their crimes
Bloodshed without warning
Now they must all pay the price
The ultimate in justice, reprisal for their crimes
Assassinate, eliminate, the rule of an eye for an eye
The moral question, to take another's life
Political necessity when justice has been denied
Terrorized for crimes that often go untried
Spreading fear throughout their victims, ultimate sacrifice
Criticized for killing any hope for peace
Violence no matter what the consequence
Who pays the price? all for a place that they call home
Conflict will never end, all for a place that they call home
This pain, this suffering, in a fight that will never end
Withdraw, to disengage from a place that they call home
Reclaim, retaliate in a fight that will never end
Fighting for a home, the right to claim a land
When victory is everything and nothing will hold back
This is their fight to keep their home
This is their fight to claim their land
This is their fight to keep their culture and their people on the map
Someone must pay for their crimes

And they will fight with everything for victory no matter what the price
They must defeat at any price
And they will fight with everything
Relentlessly, when justice is denied
The choice must be made
Kill. this price must be paid
Kill the choice must be made, kill
This price must be paid, kill
Revenge must be made, kill
For a place that they can call their home
And they will fight with everything until they've reached their goal
The price to pay for a place to call their home
To keep their culture and their people on the map
