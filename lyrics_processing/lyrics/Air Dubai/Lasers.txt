Get back to bass kicks that boom to get your face lift
And vibrations in the kicks like K-Swiss
Its laced with hi-hats to speed it up
Then breaks and 808's will slow it down like matrix
Break it down complex like David Blaine tricks
And leave it to Air Dubai to take it back to basics
Criticize the lasers, a stupid illusion
But put it all together and it's musical fusion
Folks say Air Dubai is like immaculate conception
Put it all together and it's actual perfection
We come through only to make a statement
So we make hits before it's back to the recession
A show with us is like a borealic light show
A hundred thousand watts and it isn't a typo
Fiending all the lights showing up in different flavors
See the DJ, tell him we need more lasers, so

Tell the girls at the front of the stage
That drinks are on me grab another cold drank (cold drank)
Tell the bouncers at the back of the room
To let everybody in that they have to get through (get through)
Tell the sound guy that I need more bass
'Cause I've been more hyped up since I've been in fourth grade
Tell the bartender I don't need more chasers
Tell the DJ that I need more lasers
You might also like
Yo, I'm a global mogul slash soulful coastal coaster
The definition of a legend trophy holder
Slight cocky with an iron fist grip
Come equipped pen-tipped with a venomous drip
Call me the rhyme-slayer critic of common culture
Develop a style so poisonous I might insult ya
Exalt the American Arabic
Flow so fiasco I'm American terrorist
Mechanical animal with a cannibal mandible
I'm a vandal unstandable I'll develop a channel full
Spit kicker the iller figure how could they handle you
I contest wackness, I will dismantle you
Flava Flav rappers with the nappiest style
Soul singers will "oooh" and "aaah" like "I'm feeling you child"
Hand out tablets like pamphlets for all the ravers
And tell the DJ that we need more lasers, so


(More lasers, more and more lasers)
Tell the DJ that I need more lasers
(More lasers, more and more lasers)
Tell the DJ that I need more lasers
(More lasers, more and more lasers)
Tell the DJ that I need more lasers
(More lasers, more and more lasers)
Tell the DJ that I need more lasers
I drop lyrical disasters on demand like it's comcast
Feel it in Japan like a nuclear bomb blast
Nagasaki bombs down, cold as saki bombs
Round one, round two, or however the song sound
I live it by the words beats chronic and red cup life
Passing out drunk from Pabst and sippy-cup nights
Sip me up lady like I'll never be right again
Tripping off euphoria like swallowing vicodin
Okay, now I'm back in it, sick flows I'm adamant
Concentrated rhymes like UPS I'm packing it
Ink flows like Bic pens, hot shit like pig pens
I'll rip you up and tell you the time like I was Big Ben
Just give a little bit of time, bass, compositions full of abstracts
Looking for that heat, well Dubai is where the crack's at
Fat sacks of the illest on the planet
Wordplay from Oz, and Rhias the mic bandit, so


(More lasers, more and more lasers)
Tell the DJ that I need more lasers
(More lasers, more and more lasers)
Tell the DJ that I need more lasers
(More lasers, more and more lasers)
Tell the DJ that I need more lasers
(More lasers, more and more lasers)
