And that's right
I got you buzzing like there's no escape
Heavy on the flow
Dough bloating like it's overweight
Potent and I know it's great
Sticking with it, hold the tape
We go dumb
But tonight I'm trying to go insane
Cause when I do it
Sway so hard make the fans go stupid
Truth is usually I take it to a new degree
Hipsters go crazy cause I spit this shit gluten free
Fluently a must
Got the crew with me I trust
I'm used to having hella girls falling in lust
It's like nothing
Crush it like an opened reserve
Give me 3 and a half minutes
I'll be blowing your hurr back
Pardon this I promise no interruptions
Got my time coming
I'm waiting it like a bus bench
Yeah, and I'm hooking you like a substance
Get fans quicksand got you all sunked in
You might also like
And we still got girls to call
And I still got time to waste
So lets pour some alcohol
We can do this all day
I can never get enough
Let 'em know we're on the way
I don't care what they say
We can do this all day

I got my rays on my face like I'm banning the clouds
And I'm tailored to my feet like I'm chucking it proud
And I'm loving the crowd
Far as the eye can see
With a broken watch so I spit it timelessly
Got never any beef whether frozen it or thawed
Cause I'm blowing it apart and I'm hoping its a start
Spotlight shining like I'm soaking in the stars
And I know you still see me like I'm glowing in the dark
Yeah we go hard when I'm riding through the city
With the sun coming up
And the girls riding with me
And you know just what we bout to do
Live once so I do it like it's last call
Fans going crazy for this shit, bath salts
Stay up on my grind
Going harder than the asphalt
Switching lanes, getting plays, quicker than a fastball
But we still got girls to call
And I still got time to waste
So lets pour some alcohol
We can do this all day
I can never get enough
Let 'em know we're on the way
I don't care what they say
We can do this all day

For all the girls in the city
Late night feel
Suns coming up but we're partying still
For all the fellas in the city
Late night feel
