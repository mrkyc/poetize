I think I'm catching the vibe
I think I'm picking up where we left off
Chain smoke cigarettes at the rest stop
Retro girl like she hit me with her best shot
"Pat", set it off today
Blow it up, break it down
Make it hot today
Make it blast, no past
Throw the clock away
Still I'm feeling so good when she walk away
Yeah, get with the distance, I'm content
Fixed in, the interest of just friends
Feeling strung out when the love ends
Like I think I'm coming down when it sunk in
Right, So high at new heights
The mood lights, shine too bright for tonight
Yeah, and true life I'm on that
And I'm feeling too high for contact

We got our fast cars
We got our fast hearts
We move like lighting
We shine like shooting stars
You might also likeWe're in the afterglow
We're going up in smoke
Losing all control
Whoa
Live or die a contact high

Second place home base a base hit
The same quick talk going back to basics
And face it, any other girl just ain't shit
I tell em, find another heart to play with
Uh, I'm on a one way train to find a runway dame
I need a weekend girl, not a Monday flame
I need to see that world, I'm tryna do me
Get a buzz like I'm coming off two drinks
Yeah, you know I got what you need
All night, alright
She's the crop of the cream, "Warning"
On top, no stopping the team
And she looking for a thrill like she walking the dream
I'm going off the map like I'm lewis and clark
No talkin' back, I'm pursuing the art dude
Yeah, cause true life I'm on that
And I'm feeling too high for contact

I know you love the way I drive
Can we leave the world behind
Meet me where the stars meet sky
