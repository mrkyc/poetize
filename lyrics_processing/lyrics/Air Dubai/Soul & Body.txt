Walking and stepping it, I be talking with rhetoric
I'm squashing and wrecking shit, got no time to settle it
Why I only ever get broken hearts to meddle with
I just had the reverence, she just had the metal clinch
And we go all the way back and forth from what I hope to do
But I just can't submerge all my feelings cause they broke in two
And leaving it, leaving you is exactly what I'm supposed to do
Breaking the focus through, got no control of you

You try to play me in your games that no one can win
Time is where we disappear cause love is what we're missing here
I'd rather be by myself babe, than stuck here with you
And trying and fighting to fall in love is what I'll never do
You try to play me in your games that no one can win
Time is where we disappear cause love is what we're missing here
I'd rather be by myself babe, than stuck here with you
And trying and fighting to fall in love is what I'll never do

I'll never fall in love, I'm too careful
Broken hearts, we're too young to settle in
Soul and body, soul, soul and body
Soul and body, soul, soul and body
I'll never fall in love, I'm too careful
Broken hearts, we're too young to settle in
Soul and body, soul, soul and body
Soul and body, soul, soul and body

Yeah, rocking and rolling, beats be knocking and choking
And we be cropping and focussing, weed is poppin' and potent
Yeah, love is the potion that leaves you chopped up and broken
Keep it locked up and token... I am the ocean
Smooth sails, we groove well, just trying to keep it moving
Pour shots, we do lots, save for some decent grooving
And when we both go do our thing and we just stay departed
We'll keep it distant and live it just like the way we started

You try to play me in your games, that no one can win
Time is where we disappear cause love is what we're missing here
I'd rather be by myself babe than stuck here with you
And I just can't submit all my feelings straight right back to you
You try to play me in your games, that no one can win
Time is where we disappear cause love is what we're missing here
I'd rather be by myself babe, than stuck here with you
And trying and fighting to fall in love is what I'll never do

I'll never fall in love, I'm too careful
Broken hearts, we're too young to settle in
Soul and body, soul, soul and body
Soul and body, soul, soul and body
I'll never fall in love, I'm too careful
Broken hearts, we're too young to settle in
Soul and body, soul, soul and body
