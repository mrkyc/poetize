I think back to last winter
Teardrops fell like hail last December
I need a sunny something just to brighten my day
I packed my things and moved west to L.A
Palm trees in the sunny metropolitan
Where them high classic women will keep calling him
Sunshine just shine, keep on following
Another day we play some basketball again
Bikini girls by beaches are all modeling
This is the life and ain't nothing bothering, me
I'm with Michelle from the valley
Sorry 303 but it's back, back to Cali
Throw the We without the E up
213, ho to yo, I throw the peace up
LAX to the bays I wave bye
One way ticket to kick it with Air Dubai

I'm talking about L.A
The worlds best settlement
Where you can trust the weather man
Cause warm days are better than
C.O. with fur hoods and deep snow
From one day to the next
Is sunshine and heat stroke
(I said I'm talking about) L.A
The worlds best settlement
Where you can trust the weather man
Cause warm days are better than
C.O. with fur hoods and deep snow
From one day to the next
Is sunshine and heat stroke

The heat got me so restless, wearing gray sweats with
My bestest tee is all I'm left with
Let's get over to the courts down on West Fifth
Chill with the contestants and hear the way the nets swish
Weeknights are still hectic
Downtown is dead but the skylines infectious
Buildings stand majestic, respected each section
Head up to the hills and watch the sun set in
Behind Santa Monica beach
Where boardwalk adventures will set yourself at peace
Night falls while lonely waves gently weep
And the sweet sad song will rock your ass to sleep
And play street ball till the lights come on
Or there's a life to mourn, even the nights is warm
The lives of L.A. go from pretty to painful
Just another warm day in the city of Angels
