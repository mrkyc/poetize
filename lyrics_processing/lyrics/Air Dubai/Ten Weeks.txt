Ten weeks is all I got
Wishing for you to just give us a shot, and
Ten weeks is all I have
For making it true and not giving it back, so
Ten weeks is all there is
To see your world, and be a part of it, and
Ten weeks is all I need
To make this girl fall in love with me

I remember when I first met you
The sky dyed your eyes a vivid jet blue
Had small talks in blocks like animation
Told by the conversation she was someone to connect to
A close friend to a few of my acquantences
When I heard that, I had to do some friend maintenance
She had to go because he friends were in hunger
But she said she'd be in town untill the end of the summer
Damn, I said damn cause it's serious
My mind froze, cause of what it just experienced
My heart is jumping all around in my chest
And because of this girl, now my life is the best, so
Went home to see what the calender reads
The end of the summer? I only got ten weeks
The thought of this girl ain't escaping my mind
Here goes to ten weeks for just making her mine

I did what I could just for being around her
I could tell by her smile, I just knew we were bound to
Be, when I sent her flowers on her birthday
The opportune time to ask her out on our first date
She couldn't think of anything more she would like
Than to spend the day with me on the fourth of July
As magic would have it, as the fireworks bursted
Underneath the stars is where we shared our first kiss
It was magic, I could really feel the chemistry
Looked in her eyes, and I could tell that we were meant to be
End of the night, I couldn't let her depart
And after that day, we were never apart
Was lost to cloud nine, only lovers could reach
And I'm high enough to bring you up to heaven with me
We shared good times like the birds and the bees
And remember how we spent a summer beneath the trees


In love, head over heels, I've done lost my mind
It was the end of the road, time to walk the line
Living and laughing together in love
In ways no one else could do this better than us
Summer nights, your loving embrace became
A warm coat as soon as the fall breeze came
When it did, we had to hault like a freeze frame
We knew it was the end when the colors of the leaves changed
Together forever was never an option
Remember the days, but it's better to box them
Inside, held close like a tattoo
From the start we both knew that we had to
Continue on, cause we know it's for the best
But we're gonna be together in this life or the next, so
In my thoughts when I sleep in the night
Will forever remain the best weeks of my life
