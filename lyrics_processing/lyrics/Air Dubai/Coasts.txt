And we never stop
To see the faces of all the places we get into
The greatest memories erases from being living proof
I gotta freshen up, I gotta catch a flight
I'm gonna hit the coast for a couple nights
I'm finna drop some bills, let it snow some white
I got a grip of girls trying to make it right

There's a spot out there in New York City
Where the nights are long
And the girls are pretty
I used to go, with you before
And the days we spent in Los Angeles
Always were the best for us
With you before
So let's live it out loud

Hop in my bright red car
I'ma take you where the stars shine bright for us
You look good but nothing could be better
Than palm trees and some California weather okay
You might also like
Blast music dance on the highway
Barefoot, arms stretched out to the sun


"It's good to see you," she said
I can't remember when we last met
I can't remember if we had sex
I meet a lot of cute girls in a black dress
Did you miss me? Yeah
Did you count days down 'till we stopped in your town?
Then you wanna get frisky, it's too risky
Cause i'm a bad guy, she wanna fix me
Quickly shape me, degrade me and fucking morph me
Distort me and then contort me like all her trophies before me
I'm losing interest, she bored me
I'm trying to get straight to business, she's
Losing all her consistency
Paid the price just to get with me, yeah


I'm saying it's like we do this all the time
Sipping red wine and cutting lines
Just bouncing from coasts to regions
Girls falling in love like every weekend
