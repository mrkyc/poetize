I've got a beautiful day with my face to the sun
Although we just met, I'm pretty sure she's the one
With my head in the clouds, and my feet off the ground
Girl I don't even mind it, and I don't have to be reminded

He never asked for a world to repeat
Of a girl in the sack, just a girl in the sheets
He had those knocked down like a fist fight
He knew love, but he never found miss right
He's so restless, best in the red sun
Still wasn't it so he tried on the next one
Sexed them 'till the monday blues
But the love they choose falls short to the best one
Impressed them like he's smitten with love
His heart is off beat because he's given enough
He found the cure for his bleeding heart
He just needed dark so he could see the spark
The life he chose was a one-way road
When he lied so cold in his sunday clothes, but
He couldn't help that he loved so frequent
Now, and it all goes down when the week ends

You might also like
Situational love, he had a life going
So down he felt sick when he flied home
He had his mind blown, but never could right wrongs
Seperate girls set for different time zones
He likes owing his heart to every girl he sees
Gave it up to late birds and early bees
Fake hurt just ain't worth the world he sees
It ain't fit for the girl he needs (he needs)
So distant, feeling so pissed when
Typical plight met miss right's resistance
His life's missin' a love-type rich with
A miracle goal for his lyrical soul, but
What he had never matched what he felt
When the love that he had couldn't last what he held
He couldn't help that he loved so frequent
Now, and it all goes down when the weekends


And it's all because of you
That my head it goes around, and around
And around, and around
