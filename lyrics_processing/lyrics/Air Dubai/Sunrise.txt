When the sun rises
In the morning
All I want is to wake up next to you

Top of the morning
Foreign liquor sipping's getting morbid
Bright as the sun performing
Cold as the night before hand
Breaking bottles saving vacant places
Wasted faces
Waiting for the day to wake
It's stomach acid rearranging
Something passing me to chase
With faking all the cheese I'm making
Cause I'm faking alot for sure
More of the liquor diet
Forward to get inspired
Spent the whole night pouring up and I'm getting tired
Two shots of the tanqueray
Shot one, shot two and I'm saving face
That'll make it haste for the girl that I met before
Two shots for the girl that I met before
And when I'm leaving reasons waiting for the birds and bees
When after party seize to breathe
And all the smoke from dirty pieces
Decently faded, shaking phases and it's poisonous
And when I'm wasted making sense is more than sober does
She was the hand that I held to get high
The hand that I lived to sit by

Watch our colors through the shades
Turn our bodies into shapes
We look better face to face
As we make our day escape
Just stay with me
I can't watch you leave
You're all I see
Girl I want you


I'm shooting amusing bases
Using all my means to shake it
And when I want you most
I couldn't choose the basics
Drinking I'm stupid faced-ed
But it was you who paced it
And when I'm so far gone
You couldn't do what they did
Four shots and I made mistakes
And you played the game, and you stayed away
And I can't escape, living day to day
And I fade away, and it's safe to say that
You were the hand that I held to get home
