I'm on the prism, just living for opportunity
And when I'm trippin', we're smitten, I'm talking you and me
It's nothing new to me, timid's how I'm supposed to get
A prime model for dry swallowing dosages
I'm focusing so brokenly, I'm a maniac
Just how I'm losing my grip for when my brain attack
And when it's real and I'm feeling either alive or dead
That means it's working exactly how the designer said

And if our time is up and I overdose
Just know that you're the one that I love the most, cause
I go, you go, been there, before
And I know, its too late, before you walk away, before you walk away
I go, you go, been there, before
And I know, its too late, before you walk away, before you walk away

I'm losing the blessin' of having mental possessions
I'm stressin', a couple seconds i'll have to be reconnected
In section, and its the best when I'm sexin' and sweatin' hot and cold
Sick of the common goal, written in modern gold
And when we fade to black, I'm feeling safe at last
Cause every basic task turns into a sacred act
I'm praying that my decision to keep on trippin' does
Will keep me sane if my brain is to keep on gettin' old

I'm living so slow, but feeling so cold
Modern gold's got me solo like Bonobo
Love is a logo, i've got my heart detached
You've been on earth and i've just never been a part of that
And when I'm losing you, that's when I'm losing me
Truthfully, modern gold's brought me down crucially
It's so stupid we say that enough is enough
But now I'm down for the count cause your love is a drug
