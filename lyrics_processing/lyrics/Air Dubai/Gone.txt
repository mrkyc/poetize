And my bags are packed with my crimes from back home
And I'm gone
Motherfuck this place I'm gone

And I'm leaving
She said don't look back
At the infuriating reasons
All put in a book bag
Pen and a pad
Withering in my thoughts
But the ink is running off
Leaving nothing but a blank page
A blank slate when I hit the road blazing
Peek in my rearview
Leave it broken and hazy
And with the battle's still going
With me and a past life
And the atmosphere open
I'm getting out of here hoping
When I hit LA
That the storm clouds will roll away
And get that airplane off ground
With no delay
Got my baby girl by my side
So we won't be late
Love the simplest thing
For everything
What could be simpler than a wedding ring
And the fear is so precocious
I'm breaking the focus and shot across the ocean

And when I'm gone
You said that you're gonna miss me
An altitude grasp
I'm passing over it quickly
Running to hide failed
Broken up inside
Well perfect for a token
But I'm hoping that our time swells
And I'm hurting to rehabilitate
But it's worth it for me to get a taste
And get away
Forget the day spent just waiting
And I know that being patient is a trait that will get me saved


If our home is burned down
It's time to get out
I'm gone
If the city caught fire
Like the night sky behind us
I'm gone
I got my suitcases bursting at the seams
I'm saving two places taking you with me
I'm gone
Leaving my heart in my hometown
Taking the tone down
I'm so gone I don't wanna be alone now
