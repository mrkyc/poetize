She was the girl of my dreams, I swear that she was
I've been here before, but I was buried in love
She wasn't the type to express how she really feels
Spending weeks trapped in stupid laughs and silly deals
I made a pact, I wouldn't let her go
Weeks became months, I had nothing to show for
It, her, here I am again
Wasting away the only year I have to spend
Now, time passes without looking backwards
And I'd be gone way before I could've had her
But when we're alone, it's clear that she was diggin'
Found herself trapped by fear and indecision
My silver bullet shot down by her golden eyes
I won the game but I just never got to hold the prize
I'm all alone with my heart left open wide
Given all I could, but the flame, that's supposed to die

And I keep putting myself in this situation
Knowing all the heartbreak I'd be facing
Did I learn anything at all
Do I learn anything at all
Here again in the same old cycle
I can't explain why I do what I do
Did I learn anything at all
Do I learn anything at all

So when the winter chill springs to a summer daze
The only change is that I love her more a hundred ways
Another phase with her is what I'm lusting
And it's only a discussion not to waste away our wonder age
Love her ways, hate what she does to me
She's all good and sweet, and then she's such a tease
So abruptedly in arrest
Took my heart from my chest to her custody
Now time was the enemy, she couldn't be a friend to me
Giving us a chance ain't the same as a wedding ring
The chemistry shared was a sign that we're meant to be
Together, whether for a day or a century
Fall back now, emotions at risk
I'm waiting girl, I left my heart open for this
Situation stands, same shit is what I really mean
I came a full circle but I never learned anything


And I can't figure this out
I can't lie that I made an attempt
But being with her could never be how I dreamt
Said I'm learning, learning
Thoughts you kept to yourself
I can't lie that I wanted her bad
But her having my heart was just something to have
Maybe someone else will help

Yeah, yeah, yeah
