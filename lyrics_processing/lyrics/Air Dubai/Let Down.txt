Moving on's what I hate to do
But they say heartbreak wasn't made for two
Silhouettes in the shape of you
Still haunting forgetting the memories was daunting
A nightmare for infinity
Well cupid streams these lucid dreams
A night bare of her energy
And I sleep so cold to stay awake
Tryna' figure if it's meant to be
I tried to call wanna talk and explain
I just wanna see your face without you walking away
But you're resisting me all I need is consistency
I'm saving my heart if you say that I got it for sure
Petty thieves will take it and cop it for more
Than what the worth is
But it's worthless without your name still engraved on the surface
But what you say never can equate with the games you play
And what you do never emulates what I want from you

I'm tryna' find a way
A way to get to you
I don't care what they say
I'm gonna make it
I hoped you'd be my dream come true
But you're just gonna let me down
You might also like
You're so cold that I'm getting below
I would've took it back but I did it to know
If when you said love if you meant us
It could've been lust but I let you go
It was neither the time nor the season
For letting it go without a rhyme or a reason
So to reset I haven't a clue
I'm just tryna' make do with the time that we spent
And make amends I hope to
Pick up every piece for the things you won't do
Over re-patch this
If we pick up again we need practice
And it's a good thing
When you say don't wanna waste what we could be
You gotta play the part of forgiveness
I'll stay true from the start to the finish line
But what you say never can equate with the games you play
And what you do never emulates what I want from you
