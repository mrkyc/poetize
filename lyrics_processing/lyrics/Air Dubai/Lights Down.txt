And we go down, hit the town like a light switch
When the sun goes down I'm a night kid
And the music bumps, like the right fix
I ain't ever done anything like this
Fresh don't scratch the surface, it's worth it
Everything we did was perfect
And if the drinks are free
Got everything I need, but a girl to flirt with
Yeah, and when her eyes catch mine, it's time
Then we hit the dance floor, lights down
And there's no need to be shy
Cause having a good time's what we came for right now
Get down, just groove it
Girl that's when I start to lose it
This is our time, and everything is fine
The beat is so nice, so you've got to move it

Get so high baby, off your love faded
Turn it off to turn me on
Hit the lights and I'm gone
In the night you shine bright, but you
Look better when you start to move
Look better when you start to move
Look better when you start to move for me
Me and you are dancing in the dark
You might also like
And when the night progresses
The restless youth couldn't coup the method
And time goes fast when the crew has left quick
And house lights glow
I know, but I didn't want to lose the best chick
Still not missing the days
When I just wanna get down simple and plain
And I'm spitting my game and I'm doing it all for
The same kind of girl I fall for
And I got so surprised she
Moves in a way that electrifies me
The night won't have to end
All alone when we wait for the sun to rise, we
Just get down, straight lose it
This life is a cost to movement
Time struck when we tried to get more
Girl these are the nights we live for
