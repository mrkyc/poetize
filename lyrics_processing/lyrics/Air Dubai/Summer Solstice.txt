I sit and think about ya
The days we spent together
But summers come and gone
Summers come and...
I hope you dream about me
And miss me when you're lonely
But summers come and gone
Summers come and...

Jump in the car again harnessing what we've done before
Playing the part for when we hop up on our summer tour
An open road is the best when you hit both coasts
Just rocking shows with your best friends
Lateral wisdom, Longitudes missing out
Everyday something new
Coming through, different towns
We write tunes that'll crack through the surface
The times that'll give life purpose
Summer dreaming and I know that I've seen it before
Another season but I seem to believe in it more
So can we leave yet? All my bags are packed
The same drill everyday's going back to back
But yo, it's worth it
For when we roll through the party
And seeing Air Dubai up on the marquee
From, living in vans to mingling with fans
We're gonna rock this whole summer from beginning to end
You might also like

I'm saying goodbye to the grind and all the routines
Cause summer's coming on and I'm gonna try new things
For certain-ly play it back so perfectly
Take your time cause we've got the whole world to see
Like I'm a kid again, loving every minute when
We have another toast, toppling over the limit man
Cause up here the stars shine very bright
When you rock a different skyline every night
Keeping my eyes wide, taking in everything
Keeping my mind right, blowing up every dream
And party time's best when you never giving less than
Everything you got, loading bowls and taking shots
Forwards and back far, cruising through the rap charts
Never letting go, breaking banks and crushing hearts
The right channel to escape through
Something only me and my boys can relate to
