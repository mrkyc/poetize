Among the couples fit for a heartfelt relationship
It's never been the one where either players play to win
I lost the race from across the wrongs
And now it's not the same loving off and on
So whatever's going through your mind is beyond me
I'm not to hate for wanting something so concrete
Fill the gaps on the path to destruction
And in the end all we had to show for it was nothing

So to get you it'd be best to let you go
That is just one of those things I can't understand
Maybe one day, girl you will see that you can't
Live so black and white, see all with your eyes
You seem to be such a contradiction to me

I'd say I love you
Just for you to say it's not the right time
It's deep how you can be
So surface with me
You're complicated
But you act like this is oh so basic
But who am I to judge
Who you want to be
You might also like

I'm so far gone girl I've fallen off the deep end
I've never been a victim to the habits that you frequent
And us was never something to believe in
The colors so dullen in extraordinary season
And damn, why am I still bothering played the game of love
And I was dealt the same card again
I never followed it blind by her bright eyes
Chopped up my pride bite size so I could swallow it
The thought of us continuing on the same pass
Bad enough for me to wish the thunderstorms came back
Cause clear skies was never our reality
Only played it cute, only when we knew it had to be
Gray scale the truth was so vivid
Like it was just yesterday
Like I could relive it
Reflipped the switch just wishing you were close to me
A black and white relationship
Was never how it's 'sposed to be
