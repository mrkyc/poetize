And the people say...
Never take a chance when it deals with fate
Never slow down when you're still in the fast lane
Surfing, when you work hard you deserve it
But how many years should I spend
On the same tip shooting it with my friends
A battle, stay away from the fallout
Find a new route try to see what it's all about
But its hard to be decent
When you fall through seasons
And break out with a rhyme and a reason
I find a new bout to sink my jealous teeth in
Never excited when divided from the main crew
Only provided when I try to make the same tunes
But that's not what I did at all
I stand tallest

Cause there are things that I've built
And there are things that I've done
I've been searching for an answer before you take a chance on me know
I'm crashing down

And the people shout
Never think twice when you deal with doubt
Never go about same things the wrong way
Go along great and they say that it's all the same
Breaking the fate apart waiting for the day to start
Faking how I feel, and hating how we stay in dark
Change colors but it's living proof
That everything I did, yeah I did for you
But it's hard to be perfect when it's not even worth it
You break out with a song and a purpose
And watch it all die when you scratch through the surface
Fake any sound, bands fade in and out
Digital rock will stop like so many have
But that's not what I did at all
I stand tallest
You might also like

Before I let you down
Before we hit the ground
I'll give all of me now...
