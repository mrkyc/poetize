I'm blowing o's of smoke when I'm toking dro
And I focus now where I hope to go
But the lines on the page started waving
I'm tryna' make sense of the words that your saying
Procreating let's dance with the devil huh
No debating I'm still tryna' level up
To the point where I don't turn back, uh
White lines 'till the dome turns backwards
You see me gone I'm thinking the nights got me
Empty out the bong and fill it with debauchery
My people watching me
That's how it's got to be
Making it slap when I drop the beat
Up on the same grind
Loose with it takes time
Got my swagger all black like a hate crime
Making my stacks on deck and I ain't lying
I'm tryna' party all night till the daytime

City lights
Don't be scared to try something different
Feels right
I can tell it's just what you're missing
Tell me where you wanna go
If it's here then let me know
I can see you in the city lights
You might also like
Swerve-tastic light the piece pass it
Nights complete after pipes defeat blasting
The good ol' hits
Molly dips and other stuff
I swear living this life is like another drug
And I'm living tonight
Cause I'm getting it hype
And I'm fit to break it down if the rhythm is right
Like I'm picking a fight
While I'm sipping the mikes hard lemon
Boulevard I'm switching lanes
Whip it hard, drippin' paint
Hit the yard getting blazed
Fly girls in my world they get to stay
Tryna' forget every little thing I did today
Cruise while I'm getting high
Loose with it, fit to drive
Fresh when I step in the 2'2
You and I are so smitten
Habit for the fixing
Thieves in the night got me ripe for the picking

City lights
Don't be scared to try something different
Feels right
I can tell it's just what you're missing
Tell me where you wanna go
If it's here then let me know
