You know me, I used to get caught up in everyday life
Tryin' to make it through my day so I could sleep at night
Tryin' to figure out my way through the maze of rights and wrongs
But like you used to say, nothing feels like it's really worth it
Forget perfect, I'm trying not to be worthless
Since I last saw you, I've been looking for a purpose
Well, I met this kid who thought like I did
He had a weird way of looking at it, this is what he said

"Slip out the back before they know you were there and at the worst, you'll see nobody cares
'Cause you don't wanna be around when it all goes down, even heroes know when to be scared
Slip out the back before they know you were there and at the worst, you'll see nobody cares
'Cause you don't wanna be around when it all goes down, even heroes know when to be scared"

Now, I don't remember where I met him or remember his name
But he walked funny like he was just too big for his frame
Just over five foot, but he weighed a buck fifty
And what he said just seemed so right, it stuck with me
Listen, it's like poker, you can play your best
But you gotta know when to fold your cards and take a rest
And know when to hold your cards, hold your breath
And hope that nobody else is stacking the deck
Because I don't need to tell you that life isn't fair
It doesn't care, it arbitrarily cuts off your air
And like you, I want someone to say it's okay
In the truest parts of our hearts, everybody's afraid
We're just underappreciated and overwhelmed
Fighting so hard to hide our fear that we're scaring ourselves
You understand what I'm sayin' 'cause you always did
But it's different in the words of a cowardly kid who said
You might also like
"Slip out the back before they know you were there, at the worst, you'll see nobody cares
'Cause you don't wanna be around when it all goes down, even heroes know when to be scared
Slip out the back before they know you were there, at the worst, you'll see nobody cares
'Cause you don't wanna be around when it all goes down, even heroes know when to be scared"

And I'm no hero, you remember how I was, you know
All I ever did was worry, feeling out of control
To the point where everything is going end over end
I'm spinning around in circles again
This is where you come in, all of this to explain to you why
I had to separate myself away from yesterday's life
Please remember, this isn't how I hoped it would be
But I had to protect you from me

That's why I slipped out the back before you knew I was there, I know you felt unprepared
But every single time I was around, I'd just bring you down and I could tell that it was time to be scared
That's why I slipped out the back before you knew I was there and I know the way I left wasn't fair
