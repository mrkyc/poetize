Y'all are not not re-ready (no), not re-ready (no)
We about to drop it steady so
Do it like that (like that)
Like that (like that), like that (like that), like that

Now why's everybody so petrified (what)
Petrified (what)
Step aside and just drop that (c'mon)
Drop that (c'mon)
Drop that (c'mon)
Drop that (c'mon)
Now why's everybody so petrified (what)
Petrified (what)
Step aside and just drop that (c'mon)
Drop that (c'mon)
Drop that (c'mon)
Drop that (c'mon)

How you doin ya'll, my name's Mike
I'm fluent with the new shit, I'm doin it all night
I like what I do, I do what I like
I can quit and get it back like I'm riding a bike
Like stop, bring it back, bring it back
We got that balance keepin us on track
That you get when you're moving quick with no slow
You stare like you don't care, but you do though
You might also like
I know, you really must be so lonely
Puffed up like you're tough but so phony
You and your boys you don't know me
You really wanna hold me? Show me (homie)
Let's get it over with for good
I got a friction addiction I wish you would
Machine Shop rocking when we step inside
And we got everybody so petrified

Now why's everybody so petrified (what)
Petrified (what)
Step aside and just drop that (c'mon)
Drop that (c'mon)
Drop that (c'mon)
Drop that (c'mon)

Listen: you are not ready
Like children and a building you can't stand steady
It must be the beat so heavy
Causing panic attacks like a crack in the levy
Give you that Robert-Plant
Dancing-days-are-back feeling all in the track
And in fact, for those knowing the name I'm back
With some brand new crack we can do it like that
You really must be so lonely
Puffed up like you're tough but so phony
You and your boys you don't know me
You really wanna hold me? Show me (homie)
Tough talk doesn't mean a thing
Get over yourself, you know when we're up in the scene
It's Machine Shop rocking when we step inside
And we got everybody so petrified

Now why's everybody so petrified (what)
Petrified (what)
Step aside and just drop that (c'mon)
Drop that (c'mon)
Drop that (c'mon)
Drop that (c'mon)
Now why's everybody so petrified (what)
Petrified (what)
Step aside and just drop that (c'mon)
Drop that (c'mon)
Drop that (c'mon)
Drop that (c'mon)

Y'all are not not re-ready (no), not re-ready (no)
We about to drop it steady so
Do it like that (like that)
Like that (like that), like that (like that), like that
Y'all are not not re-ready (no), not re-ready (no)
We about to drop it steady so
Do it like that (like that)
Like that (like that), like that (like that), like...
Get up

Now why's everybody so petrified (what)
Petrified (what)
Step aside and just drop that (c'mon)
Drop that (c'mon)
Drop that (c'mon)
Drop that (c'mon)
Now why's everybody so petrified (what)
Petrified (what)
Step aside and just drop that (c'mon)
Drop that (c'mon)
Drop that (c'mon)
Drop that (c'mon)

Like stop (stop)
Bring it back, bring it back
We got that balance, keeping us on track
Like stop (stop)
Bring it back, bring it back
We got that balance, keeping us on track
Like stop (stop)
Bring it back, bring it back
We got that balance, keeping us on track
Like stop (stop)
Bring it back, bring it back
We got that balance, keeping us on track
Like stop (stop...)
Strange days have found us
Machine Shop (Shop...)
