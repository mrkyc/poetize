Machine Shop!
Yeah. Ladies and gentleman. Please to meet you. I go by the name of Sixx John. Of course you know Mike Shinoda (Yeah)
Uh oh (uh oh), let's go (let's go), let's go
(One time)
For my Machine Shop crew and then it's
(Two times)
S.O.B and LP too and then it's
(Three times)
It's Mike and Six on the track and then
(Four times)
When we come in through the back they're saying

Oh no, close the door
Shut the lights and start the show
Better let everybody know
Get on the mic and there they go
Oh no, close the door
Shut the lights and start the show
Better let everybody know
Get on the mic and there they go

Armed and dangerous bitch
Ya'll can't really hang with us in this
Everyone's so afraid of us, shit
Makes me wanna hang it up and quit--

Forget about all the things you heard before
'Bout time that we're kicking down your door
Everybody's gonna hit the fucking floor
Like "please Mike don't hurt me anymore"
I dont gotta have a secret lie or an alibi
Everybody knows why I'm here
I'd just as soon crack a bottle
As crack you over the head with a bottle of beer
So just listen up there, powder puff
Better believe that I'm not playing
You can love it, you can hate
But don't mistake it, everybody's saying

Oh no, close the door
Shut the lights and start the show
Better let everybody know
Get on the mic and there they go
Oh no, close the door

Green (Green) Lantern--

What you really wanna do is this:
Just make believe that I don't exist
But you won't, cause every time you go to spit
I talk right over you just like this
It's annoying just for you
You can scream all day 'til your face is blue
I'm getting in your head and you know it too
And that's just me, you don't know my crew
My man Sixx John, understand though
The way that he flows you can call him Rambo
Never miss a shot, never run out of ammo
Coming with heat like a goddamn commando
And in S.O.B
Ryu, Tak, Vin Skully, Cheapshot
Now you see
Fuck with me? Nah, Sixx!

Oh no

Uh oh (uh oh), whatever you yell when you see that door close
I'mma bail through the back (for show)
Straight to the bar so I can act (a fool)
I figure you guys would get a little surprised
Your eyes wide when its me and Mike Shinod
I'm just plain old Sixx John from the Nam-District
This is not supposed
I still talk with awkward speech
I'm like a dog that's off his leash
Step out with a Fort Minor patch on a black tee
Niggas scared to walk these streets
I ain't trippin' homie, talk is cheap
Accapella or we can bark on a beat
And if that ain't enough action I got
Seventeen pages in the little magazine I keep
We got this place rockin', beat knockin', non stoppin'
If ya'll are with it let me hear it now (yeah) yo

Its Mike and Sixx on the track and
(Four times)
We do it like that (Like that?)
Like that (Like that!)
Fort Minor (Utterly ridiculous, how sick is this?)
Shinoda (Utterly ridiculous, how sick is this?)
Machine Shop! (Utterly ridiculous, how sick is this?)
