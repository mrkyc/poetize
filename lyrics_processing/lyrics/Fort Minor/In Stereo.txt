That beat is hard

This is how it goes, welcome one and all to the show
We're wired up, fired up, fucking ready to go
In the back of the parking lot, outside of the bar
Twenty deep, twenty feet from the boulevard
Black hoodies, black caps, black label in glasses
Previewing the new shit before all the masses
'Cause the first thing I need when I've got a new beat
Is to see how it sounds, echoing off the street
I just take it for a spin, pop the CD in
Slide it up to ten and get that rear view shaking
Then play it again so there's no mistaking
San Andreas the block, get this bitch earthquaking, like oh

Oh, ready for it, here we go
We got the whole block rocking in stereo
We're taking control, letting everybody know
And if you feel it, let me hear everybody go oh

You're not ready
I got plenty cuts for twenty months dropped steadily
Plenty tracks to empty on your wack pedigree
I'm backed heavily, while you're back-pedalling
Forget the chitchat on me, homie kick back
I'm on that shit that can get your homie bitch-slapped
So zip your lip back, listen and watch
We got the whole block rocking off the way the beat knocks
You don't have to warn the people on the corner they know
That if you're standing on that corner then you're getting that show
World premiering, you're hearing that Machine Shop flow
San Andreas the block, get this bitch earthquaking, like oh
You might also like
Oh, ready for it, here we go
We got the whole block rocking in stereo
We're taking control, letting everybody know
And if you feel it, let me hear everybody go
Oh, ready for it, here we go
We got the whole block rocking in stereo
We're taking control, letting everybody know
And if you feel it, let me hear everybody go

Turn the key, turn the volume up too loud
Roll right, roll every window down
Let the whole block know what this is about
Turn it up y'all, burn that system out
Turn the key, turn the volume up too loud
Roll right, roll every window down
Let the whole block know what this is about
Turn it up y'all, burn out that system like

Oh, ready for it, here we go
We got the whole block rocking in stereo
We're taking control, letting everybody know
And if you feel it, let me hear everybody go oh
Oh, ready for it, here we go
We got the whole block rocking in stereo
We're taking control, letting everybody know
And if you feel it, let me hear everybody go oh
Let's go ahead and test out the speakers
