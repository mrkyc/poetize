Hold up, hold up, what's good, what's your name, nigga?
You affiliated with who? And you reppin' what gang, nigga?
Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up
Who there, who there? Can't just let anybody roll up
Hold up, hold up, we takin' you 'cause we supposed to
What you said your name was again? Nah, my niggas don't know you
Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up
Who there, who there? Can't just let anybody roll up

I don't care if you with a nigga that's with me, what that mean?
You his man, you ain't my man, you ain't gang-gang, you ain't with the team
Trust issues, I got 'em, I'm not your brother, don't call me bro
I told my man come get your man, I don't like your man, your man gotta go
I know niggas don't like me, from the projects, yeah, I'm grimy
If I was blood, everyday I probably pull a almighty ten-ninety
Set trippin' in the parkin' lot soon as niggas walk out the spot
It was all good a week ago, that Henny got a nigga lookin' like the opp
Fire here in that glass jar, kitchen smellin' like Mexico
If a nigga rob me, he might as well shoot himself like Plaxico
We send shots, not messages, we don't leave no witnesses
We don't do it for the 'Gram, we don't want the internet to get a wind of this
Where the money? What the business is? Who you? Where the plug at?
Why talk to a nigga if it ain't 'bout the money, who does that?
Why talk to a nigga that I don't know? He might be the po-po
Or he might be down with the opp tryna line me up on the low-low

Fifteen just to see my face
Clear them niggas out, I can see my way (See it)
