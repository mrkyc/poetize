Y'all couldn't wait for this shit to drop, it's part of hip-hop
Will Smith really went and smacked the shit out of Chris Rock (He did)
He laughed at the joke at first until he saw his wife's demeanor
Chris Rock ain't know Jada was bald because of alopecia (He didn't)
That's something a majority of people knew nothing about
But I bet you he won't put her name back in his fucking mouth (He won't)
Live at the Oscars, you can't make up this story
Her boo August Alsina got beat up by Tory
Jada probably called him to see if he OK
I wonder how she felt when she found out that he was gay
That's who you cheated on Will for, let me fucking stop
August gon' fuck around and catch the monkeypox
I'm just saying y'all do know how it begins spreading
I disrespect niggas every year and I don't regret it
Let's talk about Kanye being anti-Semitic
The Adidas deal that made him a billionaire got deaded
Now he only worth about 4-5 hundred Ms
He lost his mind when Pete Davidson started fucking Kim
He be dressing dusty now, he don't even look rich
He been looking stressed since that white boy took his bitch
You already know Jay-Z be ignoring him he violated George Floyd
Black people ain't supporting him (We ain't)
He was on Drink Champs sounding like a fucking clown
Nore and them had to go and take the interview down
He defended the cop that had George Floyd on the ground
He say dumb shit whenever there's a camera around
And it's like he say that shit without no hesitation
His friends need to make sure he's taking his medication
Maybe he ain't crazy and that's really how he feel
Lately he keep taking shots at Diddy and Meek Mill
No more Yeezys, no more Balenciaga deal
Banned from Instagram, damn that nigga gotta chill
Fuck donkey of the day, he donkey of the year bro
Even Pusha T had to cut ties with that weirdo
He did it to himself, I really don't understand that nigga
What the fuck would make him go and say he a fan of Hitler?
He confused, Kanye wanna be a cracker
That nigga made t-shirts saying white lives matter
Enough about Kanye and all the stupid shit he did
Tiffany Haddish did some weird shit with some little kids
Balenciaga did some weird shit with some little kids

Nobody cares he got 30 years when he went to trial
We ain't trying to be out here screaming free a paedophile (Nope)
Let's talk about Freddie Gibbs, like really what's up with him?
Niggas robbed him in Buffalo and he got beat up again
He be out here looking like a cold-blooded sucker
I know Ashanti regretting letting Irv Gotti fuck her
Every interview he do he got her name in his mouth
Either he's obsessed with her or he's just chasing clout (Come on)
Shit corny, even Fat Joe had to call him out
You mad she fucking Nelly nigga that's what it's all about
Stacey Dash dumb ass on Instagram crying
Like she just found out about DMX dying (Shut up)
Keyshia Cole thought Antonio Brown was her man
AB treated her like she a one night stand (Crazy)
You thought he was feeling you Keyshia, naw he was drunk (He wasn't)
He fucked you a couple times and stopped picking up (Damn)
Scotty Pippen stressed out hearing 'bout all them rumors
About his ex-wife fucking with Michael Jordan Jr
Future already had his thumb all in that ho butt
Michael B. Jordan and Lori Harvey broke up
Diddy had a daughter, congratulations my brother
Yung Miami trending cause she not the baby mother
Akademiks called her one of Diddy's side joints
Right now them City Girls is down a thousand points (They down)
Saweetie fucked Lil Baby, I knew she was a freak
Her album flopped, it only did two thousand the first week (That's it)
She put a record out dissing Quavo, bad timing
Honestly she sound better on mute when she rhyming (She do)
Glorilla said some shit and I couldn't believe it

I said I wasn't gonna do it, y'all know that wasn't true
This my favorite time of year, y'all know how I do
I disrespect niggas respectfully
They did it to they selves so fuck if they get upset with me
Y'all know what happened, y'all heard what happened but y'all don't care
Y'all still want me to talk about this shit every year
Crazy, crazy, this shit crazy
Crazy, crazy, this shit crazy

Here we go
Yeah, new year, new money nigga, it's the rap up
Everybody get it nigga
We don't give a fuck about no fucking industry niggas or bitches

We the niggas that don't care about the red carpet
Thanks 50
Murda let's go

Young Thug and Gunna got hit with the RICO
They using rap lyrics against them and that shit is illegal (Damn)
They let Gunna go we trying to figure out how that happened
(He snitching)
He took a plea deal, Lil Boosie say that nigga ratting
Gunna pushing pleas. Young Thug still stuck in jail
Niggas saying Gunna new name is I'm gonna tell
Until we know all the facts we shouldn't speak on that
If Thug ain't tell him to take that deal then he a rat
He was on Crime Stoppers before looking bad
He the new 6ix9ine on the 'Gram shit is sad
We saw that video of him in court, he a yes man
Is YSL a gang that nigga said yes ma'am
Yes ma'am I know about crimes that they committed
That was Jeffery's stuff in that car when y'all caught me in it
You can plead the fifth on certain shit but that don't matter
You got Charleston White calling you his new favorite rapper
You ain't have to take that deal my nigga free the slime
You ain't do shit, you wasn't facing no real time
Tory Lanez and Megan trial was like a soap opera
Still don't know if Tory Lanez or that girl Kelsey shot her
But we know Megan lied about fucking Tory
And she get drunk like she on Drink Champs with Nore
And we know her and DaBaby was intimate
It's embarrassing for her man hearing about who was hitting it
Imagine when he fucking now, what he be thinking about
On top of that, she got kicked out of Kylie Jenner house
Tory could have fucked Kylie if Megan wasn't hating
Wonder how Travis Scott feel about that situation
Tory got found guilty, they did him foul
Too many inconsistencies, should have been a mistrial
As far as DNA being on that gun his was not
A witness said they saw a female take the first shot
They was all drunk and high, shit just went too far
Megan should have never made Tory get in that car
Now we gotta try to unpack a whole lot of shit
Kelsey could have shot her just like how Remy shot a bitch
I'm just saying y'all acting like that shit is impossible
I ain't picking sides, I'm just trying to be logical
Tory Lanez father blaming Jay-Z and Roc Nation
Jay-Z ain't tell your son to go and shoot Megan
He an independent artist, he make his own decisions
He might get deported after he do his time in prison
He can win the appeal but he need a lot of help
If him or Kelsey ain't do it then that bitch shot herself
Think about it any 3 of them might could be the shooter
Don't take what I say personal that's my sense of humor
Why Tory call that girl from a phone in prison
Knowing they record them calls and was gon' listen
He supposed to know better, people was uncertain
Now it's looking like they convicted the right person
Man niggas ran up in the church like it's a stickup
It was only 8 people in there when the robbed the bishop
When I heard about it real talk I burst out laughing
God don't like ugly that's why he let that shit happen
He was out here scamming people in the name of god
Feds came and locked him up I know he was a fraud
He be dressing like a rapper that shit ain't even funny
He be buying Louis and Gucci with them people money
Ma$e said Diddy robbed him, I believe that shit
That's what happens when you sign a contract and don't read that shit
Now Ma$e saying he the new Diddy 2.0
Same deal Puff gave him he gave Fivio
They was on Gillie and Wallo show going at it
Before you sign a contract, let your lawyer look at it
That's a million dollar worth of game that I just gave you
Even Meek Mills getting jerked by his record label
T.I. trying to become a comedian
Whoever told him he was funny was fucking misleading him
He couldn't deal with the audience being rude
It was funny seeing him getting mad when he getting booed
And he snitched on his dead cousin, I'm not lying
He said his cousin told him to do it cause he was dying
That's some real shit, I get it, he knew you needed help
But I feel like it's certain shit you should keep to yourself
And I don't know who was holding who down when they was shooting
But how the fuck niggas let Takeoff get killed in Houston
They went from arguing to fighting to shots fired
I don't want to say no names, not trying to get no one indicted
Akademiks and the internet spread a foul rumor
But they already caught the nigga that 'posed to be the shooter
We keep losing good niggas, niggas should be ashamed
He was one of the coolest niggas in the whole rap game
Life too short, you never know when the ending is
Hope Offset and Quavo settle they differences
PnB Rock died during a robbery in front of his baby moms, that shit right there bothered me
Could have just robbed him, wasn't no need for killing
Man, that shit sad, imagine how his kids is feeling
And y'all owe his baby moms an apology
Niggas saw him pulling up that's what led to the robbery
Rappers started blaming her for posting up pictures, when shit like that happen, learn to mine your fucking business
Another good brother gone niggas should be ashamed
It ain't worth killing niggas over no watch and chain
They caught the kid who did it that nigga never coming home
They locked up his father too he ain't do that shit alone
If bad parenting was a person it's that nigga
He was the getaway driver that shit wack nigga
Being a rapper getting hard this shit ain't easy
We really out here becoming the new endangered species
I said I wasn't gonna do it, y'all know that wasn't true
This my favorite time of year, y'all know how I do
I disrespect niggas respectfully
They did it to they selves so fuck if they get upset with me
Y'all know what happened, y'all heard what happened but y'all don't care
Y'all still want me to talk about this shit every year
Crazy, crazy, this shit crazy
Crazy, crazy, this shit crazy

We the niggas that don't care about the red carpet

But if we go to war can that bitch block a missile
I be on some bullshit I know people can't stand me

They ain't even get warning telling them don't be outside

A$AP Rocky lucky Rihanna gave him a seed
