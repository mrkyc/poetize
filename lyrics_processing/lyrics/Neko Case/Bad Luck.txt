Woke a dog from a running dream
And that's bad luck (Bad luck)
Ate a black fly in the cream
And that's bad luck (Bad, bad luck)
Chipped my tooth on an engagement ring
And that's bad luck (Bad luck)
Could have stopped any one of these things
But that would have been bad luck

Are you tired of things going right?
Things going wrong?
Tired of trying to make everyone happy?
Too tired to sing your own songs

Do you wish you could stop everything
And take back your love?
Say you're sorry that you gave it up so easy
And cry like you're trying to be born?

Woke a dog from a running dream
And that's bad luck (Bad luck)
Ate a black fly in the cream
And that's bad luck (Bad, bad luck)
Chipped my tooth on an engagement ring
And that's bad luck (Bad luck)
Could have stopped any one of these things
But that would have been bad luck

So I died and went to work
So I died and went to work
It's not as bad as I thought it would be
But it's still pretty bad luck
It's not as bad as I thought it would be
But it's still pretty bad luck

I woke a dog from a running dream
And that's bad luck (Bad luck)
I ate a black fly in the cream
And that's bad luck (Bad, bad luck)
Chipped my tooth on an engagement ring
And that's bad luck (Bad luck)
Could have stopped any one of these things
But that would have been bad luck

And love, the most contrary asset of them all
Dragging in on nature's coattails
Acting like it wrote the moon
Trying to pass riddles as poetry
Embargo is love's waiting room

And meantime
Right here in human time
My heart could break for a one-legged seagull
And still afford nothing to you (That's bad luck)
Are you tired of things going right?
Things going wrong?
Tired of trying to make everyone happy?
Too tired to sing your own songs

Woke a dog from a running dream
And that's bad luck (Bad luck)
Ate a black fly in the cream
And that's bad luck (Bad, bad luck)
Chipped my tooth on an engagement ring
And that's bad luck (Bad luck)
Could have stopped any one of these things
But that would have been bad luck

So I died and went to work
So I died and went to work
So I died and went to work
