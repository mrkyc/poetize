My name's at the bottom
But I'm nowhere to be found
I really get around they say
So I take these sightless creatures home
Then I fear them so to tremble
For I'm no mother, I
Just some random defender
I remember running chest high
In the steppe grass
At the dawn of man
When we got along
I remember running chest high
In the steppe grass
At the dawn of man
When we got along
We raced along the ground
I chased it out of town
The sun's the meanest easy target
That I know
We played a tender game
Of kissing cobra tag
We slept astride our horses
Tied fast in their manes
You might also likeMy friend would touch my face
And leave a star or two
The years left constellations
Of our wild language
What drove the sun away
I'm far too small to know
A gaslight's winter
Marches on refinery legs
What can I tell you now?
It sped away along the canal
And drummed mosquito clouds
From their dens of hot tires for miles
And drummed mosquito clouds
From their dens of hot tires for miles
I remember running chest high
In the steppe grass
At the dawn of man
I remember running chest high
In the steppe grass
At the dawn of man
When we got along
Oh, petroleum
You're the top predator now
Sovereign, lover, liar
But you're uninspired too
According to your anthem, you
Oh, petroleum
You're the top predator now
And I am just desire
One dirty diamond
Some random defender
I sold my flesh that I might die
So the world will spin
And my cubs won't cry
I have to be the sun for them
Oh, petroleum
You are beautiful
But so am I
I'm a dirty diamond
Lying looking at the sky
I'm a dirty diamond
