Weary sun, sleep tonight, go crashing into the ocean
Cut the line that ties the tide and moon, ancient and blue
We take our empty hearts and fill them up with broken things
To hang on humming wire like cheap lamps down a dead end street

(Close your weary eyes)
But every time we turn away
(Until the wintertime)
It hits me like a tidal wave
I would change for you
But babe, that doesn't mean I'm gonna be a better man
Gave the ocean what I took from you
So one day you can find it in the sand
And hold it in your hands again

Cold ways kill cool lovers
Strange ways we use each other
Why won't you fall back in love with me?
There ain't no way we're gonna find another
The way we sleep all summer
Why won't you fall back in love with me?

Combing over Broken Cross I held onto you
Haunted by the ghost of something new
You might also like
Curtains fall, fashions fade, an endless summer over
Another tide to launch an autumn moon over the dunes
There must be a better way to pull a home apart
To keep the walls from caving in
Another way to while away from you, frozen and blue

(Close your weary eyes)
But every time we turn away
(Until the wintertime)
It hits me like a tidal wave
I would change for you
But babe, that doesn't mean I'm gonna be a better man
Gave the ocean what I took from you
So one day you could find it in the sand
And hold it in your hands again

Cold ways kill cool lovers
Strange ways we use each other
Why won't you fall back in love with me?
There ain't no way we're gonna find another
The way we sleep all summer
Why won't you fall back in love with me?
Why won't you fall back in love with me?
Why won't you fall back in love with me?
