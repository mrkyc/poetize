Out of reach of human hands
We don't have control
I use major chords to make this a sadder song
An effective manipulation
Moonlight reflected is many times stronger
I wrote this song for me
And now I let it go
From the island of the Texaco
I release it into the custody of my huckleberry friend
(Am I making pitch or honey?)
No idea why I feel strong
Am I making pitch or honey?
"It's the gift that keeps on getting
That's the shrapnel from your wedding," she said
"It's the gift that keeps on getting
That's the shrapnel from your wedding," she said
Hey, I love you better when you're wild
Suits you better if I say so
Hey, I love you better when you're wild
Suits you better if I say so
You might also likeI hear overtones that make this another song
Out of reach of human hands
We don't have control
When I am dark and I am down as dark and down as I am now
The only thing that makes me smile is to remember
Hey, I love you better when you're wild
Suits you better if I say so  (I hear overtones)
Hey, I love you better when you're wild
Suits you better if I say so  (Out of reach of human hands, we don't have control)
Hey, I love you better when you're wild
Suits you better if I say so  (I hear overtones)
Hey, I love you better when you're wild
Suits you better if I say so  (Out of reach of human hands, we don't have control)
When I am dark and I am down as dark and down as I am now
The only thing that makes me smile is to remember
That I'm beloved of the wild
And may you ever return
