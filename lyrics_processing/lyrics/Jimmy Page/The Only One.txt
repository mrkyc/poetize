Oh, 'cause it's the only one
Oh! Towards that - can you explain?
It's just to some extent you linger on and on again
And it's the only one
Well, I can't sit down, but it looks like I'm moving again
Oh, and there we sit - we oughta try
I try to minimize, minimize, minimize, oh yeah
Get out at night - and if I do
I count a thousand smiles that turn around at you
'Cause it's the only one
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Well, I can't sit down, but it looks like I'm moving again
Ooooh
Oh, yeah
And so it is - I think I know
I might have finally, finally quantified, quantified
Well, it's the only one, oh yeah
I give my word - my lips are sealed
Do you ever really wonder how I really feel?
You're the only one

It's all it fits - it's all it ever really, really was
Could you resist?
Ohhh, 'cause it's the only one
Ohhh, your time has gone - can you explain?
It's just to some extent you linger on and on again, on again, on again
It's very strange - it's very strange
(Oh, oh) Mmm, turning, turning (oh, oh) - oh, turning, turning (oh, oh)
No, I can't sit still when you know that I'm moving now
Mmm, what is it about you that I feel inside, but I can't explain?
