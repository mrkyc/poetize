Tell me what you see
Have you found
What you wanna be?
And would you like to be a real go-getter?
Would that make you feel a whole lot better?
I really don't mean to sound unkind (No)
But I've just gotta say you've been wasting my time
Oh, yeah
Do you know
What you do to me?
Does it show?
Baby, can't you see?
That all I need is some good, good lovin'
Instead of that, I get this push-and-shovin'
Sit down, we gotta draw the line
I've got to tell ya, you've been wastin' my time
You say that we're doin' just fine
I've got to tell ya, you've been wastin' my time
(Keep on wastin', keep on wastin' my time)
I don't know
What I'm gonna do
Just don't know
What to do with you
'Cause after all the time we've been together
I always thought that it could last forever

Baby, please, now I'm beggin' you
Don't you see what I'm goin' through?
You say you love me, but you leave me lonely
I always used to be your one and only
I really don't mean to sound unkind (Oh)
But I've just gotta say you've been wastin' my time
Hey
One last time
Let me say to you
It's a crime
Baby, don't you feel it, too?
If you could only try to talk about it
I wouldn't always have to scream and shout it
Sit down, we gotta draw the line
I've got to tell ya, you've been wastin' my time (Ow)
Oooh, you say that we're doin' just fine
I've got to tell ya, you've been wastin' my time

Oooh, yeah
You keep on wastin', keep on wastin' my time
Ow! You keep on wastin', keep on wastin' my time
Oooooh, you keep on wastin', keep on wastin' time
You keep on wastin', keep on wastin' time
Oooooh, you keep on wastin', keep on wastin' time
