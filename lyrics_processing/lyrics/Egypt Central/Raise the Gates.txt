You think you know what the hell I've seen
You think you know where the hell I've been
I'm from the places people never really talk about
'Cause they don't even know where to begin
The mom and dad that I never had
Were just the first of the MIA
Had the teachers and the preachers and the coaches and counselors
But everybody faded away
Fake it sympathy, you don't care
Yeah there's hell on earth, I live there

You can take me to the devil's house
You can show me where the devil waits
So let me in, I'm not afraid
Raise the gates

Push me in the fire
Let the flames wash everything
I'm not tired
Of defending my beliefs
Let it burn me down to ashes
As it crashes over me
If this is hell, I'm not afraid
Raise the gates
And push me in the fire
You might also like
When you said that you loved me too
You didn't get what it really meant
Can't lie and cheat and steal and leave
And think you're ever gonna see me again
Take it out on me, your M.O
Left in hell on earth, all alone

You can take me to the killing fields
And you can show me where the devil waits
So let me in, I'm not afraid
Raise the gates

Push me in the fire
Let the flames wash everything
I'm not tired
Of defending my beliefs
Let it burn me down to ashes
As it crashes over me
If this is hell, I'm not afraid
Raise the gates
And push me in the fire
I've got this feeling
Like I'm coming undone
I don't know where it's from
But I know that I like it
I've got this feeling
Like I'm coming undone
I don't know where it's from
But I know that I like it

Push me in the fire
Let the flames wash everything
I'm not tired
Of defending my beliefs
Let it burn me down to ashes
As it crashes over me
If this is hell, I'm not afraid
Raise the gates
Push me in the fire
And push me in the fire
