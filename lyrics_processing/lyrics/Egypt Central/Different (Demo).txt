I used to live my life for you
'Til my soul got tired
Did all I was supposed to do
I could fool a liar

Threw it all away
Threw it all to find redemption
Gave it all away
Gave it all to who would listen

That's the price I paid (price I paid)
For being different (different)
And I walk this road alone
That's the price I paid (price I paid)
For being different (different)
I can call this life my own

I used to be a part of you
'Til that part was taken
I used to see your point of view
'Til my faith was shaken
You might also like
I threw it all away
Threw it all to find redemption
Gave it all away
Gave it all to who would listen

That's the price I paid (price I paid)
For being different (different)
And I walk this road alone
That's the price I paid (price I paid)
For being different (different)
I can call this life my own

Running in the sun to seek what I'll find
Crossing your path that intersects mine
Trapped in a scene that only seems real
Confronted my dreams that I can now feel
My fronts have all failed and been stripped away
We all look the same at the end of the day
Given up once, I'll take it back twice
Will it ever cease, this is my flight
Slow me down to breathe
Never will I break this fate could not faze me
Never could I shake the things that you gave me
My heart does not see
Concrete burns and skies will come down
But nothing can change the focus I've found
Used to live my life for you
Used to be a part of you

That's the price I paid (price I paid)
For being different (different)
And I walk this road alone
That's the price I paid (price I paid)
For being different (different)
I can call this life my own
That's the price I paid (price I paid)
For being different (different)
And I walk this road alone
That's the price I paid (price I paid)
For being different (different)
