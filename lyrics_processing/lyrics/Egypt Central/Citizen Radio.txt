I've had California dreamin'
And I've had California turn on me
You can believe in that
You can believe in that
I found truth in the aftermath
And got everything that ever really mattered back
You can believe in that
You can believe in that

I won't be compromised
I know how to survive the worst that you can give
And I will never, ever go away
I can pull myself out of the grave
You can believe in that
You can believe in that

Step back and watch the show
Hear the cry on the Citizen Radio
We will be heard before the curtains close
The voice of the unknown
Hear the cry on the Citizen Radio
We'll always be the ones who told you so
You might also like
And I've seen another future through
The broken hearts down Union Avenue
You can believe in that
You can believe in that
And I've had to wait long enough
I can't turn back now, there's no givin' up
You can believe in that
You can believe in that
I won't be used again
I've learned how to defend myself against the world

Step back and watch the show
Hear the cry on the Citizen Radio
We will be heard before the curtains close
The voice of the unknown
Hear the cry on the Citizen Radio
We'll always be the ones who told you so

I won't be compromised
I know how to survive the worst that you can give
I won't be used again
I've learned how to defend myself against the world
And I found that perfect love
But she could never understand where I was coming from
You can believe in that
You can believe in that
And I've had friends walk away
I will never understand the choice they made
You can believe in that
You can believe in that

Step back and watch the show
Hear the cry on the Citizen Radio
We will be heard before the curtains close
The voice of the unknown
Hear the cry on the Citizen Radio
We'll always be the ones who told you so

I TOLD YOU SO
I'm holdin' on
I TOLD YOU SO
