7 AM and I'm walking again
Back to bury myself in the snow
With a part of me gone and it's hard to hold on
To the person that I used to know
And it kills me inside, I am buried alive
I am nothing but flesh over bone
But I can't think about and I'm not gonna change
I am better off being alone
Better off being alone

The drug, the drug is what understands me
Silence stole the voices in my head, woah
Drink myself to death on cocaine candy
Twenty one gun salute when they find me dead
When they find me dead

In the back of the house with a gun in my mouth
And a mirror in front of my face
I have looked for a reason, just one simple reason
For why I am worth being saved
But I'll never get out, so I put the gun down
It's a slow suicide that I choose
So I give in again, I sit down and breath in
I don't care about what I will lose
What I will lose
You might also like
The drug, the drug is what understands me
Silence stole the voices in my head, woah
Drink myself to death on cocaine candy
Twenty one gun salute when they find me dead
When they find me dead

I feel like this will never end
The curse under my skin
More than air I breathe
You must believe, I need the drug
I'm always on the run
From the addict I've become
More than air I breathe
You must believe, I need the drug
I need the drug
You must believe I need the drug
I need the drug
You must believe I need the drug
(The drug, the drug is what understands me)

The drug, the drug is what understands me
Silence stole the voices in my head, woah
Drink myself to death on cocaine candy
