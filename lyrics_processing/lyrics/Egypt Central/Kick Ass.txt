Now is the moment
I waited for
I can't be broken
I settled the score

(Kick, kick ass, kick ass, kick ass)
I will not quit
(Kick, kick ass, kick ass, kick ass)
So stand up, up, up

Stand up, get your hands up (move)
Are you ready to, are you ready to
Stand up, get your hands up (move)
Are you ready to kick ass?
Stand up, get your hands up (move)
Are you ready to, are you ready to
Stand up, get your hands up (move)
Are you ready to kick ass?

Conquer the weakness
Work through the pain
I can't be defeated
I will remain
