Caught in the storm

I know it's been a while
Since we last spoke
I hope you're doing fine
Out there on your own
Never thought we'd grow apart
We were together from the start
Scraping knees, collecting scars
Now I don't know who you are

It's not our fault
It's the way things are
But I want you to know
You're still in my heart

We got caught in the storm alone
People come and people go
Drifting away like old friends do
But if you walked through the door, our world
Would be just like it was before
Rewind the good times like old friends do

We just got caught in the storm
Caught in the storm

I still look back on the days
When we'd sneak out of the house
Finding a place to get away
Where we could drink and be ourselves
Now we're stressed out and held down
To the life that we've laid out
But those times have shaped us
Into who we wanted to be

We got caught in the storm alone
People come and people go
Drifting away like old friends do
But if you walked through the door, our world
Would be just like it was before
Rewind the good times like old friends do

The past runs away from us
Memories fade in and out
Time flies by before
We can even blink an eye
The past runs away from us
Memories fade in and out
Time flies by before
We can even blink an eye
We got caught in the storm alone
People come and people go
Drifting away like old friends do
But if you walked through the door, our world
Would be just like it was before
Rewind the good times like old friends do
