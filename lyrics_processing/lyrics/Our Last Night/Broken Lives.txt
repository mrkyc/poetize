Open your eyes and it'll make it easier to fight through
The dark times, the dark times
Hold the light and it'll make it easier to shine through
The dark times, the dark times

I remember a time when I was young and blind
Couldn't take the fall for anything at all
I blamed it on everybody else (I blamed it on everybody else)
Like the New World Order, the Illuminati, as long as it wasn't me
I was afraid of the mirror, of what I would see
I didn't wanna see me

Open your eyes and it'll make it easier to fight through
The dark times, the dark times
Hold the light and it'll make it easier to shine through
The dark times, the dark times
If the sky is always raining black
If the world is always stabbing you in the back
Open your eyes and you will find that we all live broken lives
(That we all live broken lives)

We all live broken lives
I was envious of other peoples love
Hung up on why I didn't have their lives
I blamed it on everybody else, I blamed it on everybody
Like corrupt politicians or the shitty economy
As long as it wasn't me
One day I lifted my head and looked into the mirror
I was staring at me

Open your eyes and it'll make it easier to fight through
The dark times, the dark times
Hold the light and it'll make it easier to shine through
The dark times, the dark times
If the sky is always raining black
If the world is always stabbing you in the back
Open your eyes and you will find that we all live broken lives
(We all live broken lives)

Remember we all go down in flames
And fail to live up to invisible names
Without a heart and stuck in our minds
