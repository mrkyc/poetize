I know we both want to do the right thing
But the needle in our compass is trembling
Trapped in the flames as our house burns down
Left for dead cause we can't find common ground

We can't find common ground so we agree to burn it down
We can't let it burn down so we need to find common ground

It's so hard to find the truth
When the other side wants to bury you, to bury you
It's so hard to find the way
When the other side wants to play you like a game
It's all about who's wrong and who's right
Don't wanna learn, we just just wanna fight
If different thinkers are enemies
Just think of what we could be if our thoughts were in harmony

I know we both want to do the right thing
But the needle in our compass is trembling
Trapped in the flames as our house burns down
Left for dead cause we can't find common ground

We can't find common ground so we agree to burn it down
We can't let it burn down so we need to find common ground

We're stuck in a maze of conviction
Every path leads back to the beginning
We've built these walls between us
It's all about who's wrong and who's right
Don't wanna learn, we just wanna fight
We've been blurring the lines between dreams and reality
Only the truth could set us free

I know we both wanna do the right thing
But the needle in our compass is trembling
Trapped in the flames as our house burns down
Left for dead cause we can't find common ground

We can't find common ground so we agree to burn it down
We can't let it burn down so we need to find common ground

Your heart's in the same place
But your mind is a million miles away
Your heart's in the same place
But your mind is a million miles away
And it's forcing us to separate
Your heart's in the same place
But your mind is a million miles away
