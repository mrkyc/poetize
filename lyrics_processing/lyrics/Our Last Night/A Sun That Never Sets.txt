Depressed and scared of death
You believe in a sun that never sets
When playing by the rules you didn't make
You can't expect to win

Don't you wanna live?
Don't you wanna be free?
In a world where you can sin
But you don't have to pray

You claim that it's faith and not that it's real
But you slave away so no one can steal
The place in the sky where you'll go when you die
I'm sorry, I just don't get it
(I'm sorry, I just don't get it)

You point you finger, you shake your head
Living by the book you think you read
I'd hate to say, "I told you so"
When the worms are eating your bones

You claim that it's faith and not that it's real
But you slave away so no one can steal
The place in the sky where you'll go when you die
I'm sorry, I just don't get it

If I said I knew the truth, would you believe me?
Would everything I do become your story?
If I said I saw your god, would you believe me?
Would my eyes become your only vision?
If I said I knew the truth, would you believe me?
Would everything I do become your story?
If I said I saw your god, would you believe me?
Would my eyes become your only vision?

Don't you wanna live?
