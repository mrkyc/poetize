Let's rage

I knew you were, you were gonna come to me
And here you are, but you better choose carefully
'Cause I, I'm capable of anything
Of anything, and everything
Make me your cupid, baby
Make me your one and only
But don't make me your enemy
Your enemy, your enemy

So you wanna play with magic?
Girl, you should know what you're falling for
Baby, do you dare to do this?
'Cause I'm coming at you like a dark horse
Are you ready for, ready for
A perfect storm, perfect storm?
'Cause once you're mine, once you're mine
There's no going back

Mark my words, this love will make you levitate
Like a bird, like a bird without a cage
We're down to earth if you choose to walk away
Don't walk away
It's in the palm of your hand now, baby
It's a yes or a no, no maybe
So just be sure before you give it all to me
It all to me, give it all to me

She's a beast, I call her Karma
She eat your heart out like Jeffrey Dahmer
Be careful, try not to lead her on
Shawty's heart is on steroids, 'cause her love is so strong
Damn, I think I love her, shawty's so bad
I'm sprung and I don't care
She ride me like a roller coaster, turn the bedroom into a fair
Her love is like a drug, I was tryna hit it and quit it
But lil mama so dope, I messed around and got addicted
