Lone wolf, I was running by myself
I don't want, don't want anybody else
I'm solo, being on my own was easy
Thought that I was all I needed, but no
Then something changed
Something hit me in the face
I can't get you out my brain
I know this sounds insane
Thinking 'bout you every night
Like an addict on a high
I can't come down, down

Cross my heart and hope to die
I swear to god I'll make you mine

I'd go through hell to have you
You are the fire I can't lose
You could burn my veins, I would take the pain
I'd go through hell to have you
I'd go through hell to have you

I'd lie for you, die for you
Take a bullet and I wouldn't think twice for you
Ain't nothing right now that I wouldn't do
You know it's true, you know it's true
Oh, I was so cynical
But now I never wanna let you go

Something hit me in the face
I can't get you out my brain
And I know this sounds insane

I'd go through hell to have you
You are the fire I can't lose
You could burn my veins, I would take the pain
I'd go through hell to have you

I'd go through hell to have you
You are the fire I can't lose
You could burn my veins, I would take the pain
I'd go through hell to have you
I'd go through hell to have you

Cross my heart and hope to die
I swear to God, I'll make you mine

I'd go through hell to have you
You are the fire I can't lose
You could burn my veins, I would take the pain
I'd go through hell to have you
I'd go through hell to have you
I'd go through hell to have you (Hell to have you)
Hell to have you
