Buried far beneath, hiding in the deep
The perfect enemy, oh-whoa
The darkness changes shape, to exist in every place
There is no escape, oh-whoa
Like spiders spinning a web of deception
We're tangled up

We can't let our demons take control of us
We should know what we are capable of
We all have a dark side, don't be scared, you can't hide
So we pray that we have the strength to fight

Waiting in the wings, praying all the way
Conspiring while we sleep, oh-whoa
Creatures of the night hidden in plain sight
Powerless in the light, oh-whoa

We can't let our demons take control of us
We should know what we are capable of
We all have a dark side, don't be scared, you can't hide
So we pray that we have the strength to fight
(We pray that we have the strength to fight)
We pray that we have the strength to fight
