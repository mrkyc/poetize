Keep your vision narrow
Put your mind open
If we move like sparrows away from sin
We might have a chance to fight through all the pain
We might keep ourselves from unraveling

There's noise around us
It's been closing in
If we aim our arrows to the bronze serpent
We might have a chance to fight through all the pain
We might keep ourselves from unraveling

Don't fear
Look forward, no distractions, peace is near
Put your hands back on the wheel, you need to steer
Keep your eyes on the target and don't fear
Look forward, no distractions, peace is near
Put your hands back on the wheel, you need to steer
Keep your eyes on the target and don't fear

There's noise around us
It's been closing in
If we aim our arrows to the bronze serpent
We might have a chance to fight through all the pain
We might keep ourselves from unraveling
