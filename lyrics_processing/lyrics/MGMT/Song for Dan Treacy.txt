He spends his time
Or maybe half of his time
Or part of the time wandering
Around the creeks and cobble stones of Hackney lanes
With a tear in his eye
As the children walk by, he's thinking of a song
And then stops to paint a picture of a frown
Walking around

Dan Treacy's smile
Leaves you trying to decide
Who's the victim, what's the crime?
No rest for the mind that's seen it all before
And I don't know where he lives
But he's a myth of a man and Texas Bob the cameraman
Is off to fix his suit before the show
Yeah, but where did he go?

To know when your time's up
You flip the glass and watch the hours quickening
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
In the back of the station
Fluorescent lights about to quit their flickering
Well, he speaks his mind, he says, "What is crime?"
Dan Treacy's eyes

In the middle of the park
When the underground is dark
He's a poet, he's a lark
He starts thinking about a place that no one knows
And when the creeks run dry
He stays frozen in time
Strange lights in the sky start blinking
I can see the car outside but he's listening, ooh
He's listening, ooh
He's listening, ah
And he's making up his mind

(He made his mind up) To get things done and overcome
(He made his mind up) Yeah, he's gonna let it go
(He made his mind up) In the park and at the station
(He made his mind up) Yeah, he's gonna get it done
(He made his mind up) Ooh yeah, he's gonna get it done
(He made his mind up)

Yeah, he's gonna let it go, ooh-ooh
No matter the time, oh, oh
When the creeps run by, oh no
He's making his mind up, oh, oh, oh, oh
Said, yeah, he's gonna get it done, whoa-oh
Oh yeah, when the creeks run dry, whoa-oh
Say, yeah, he's gonna listen to his soul
Say, yeah, when the creeps walk by
"Come here boy, look me in the eye"
