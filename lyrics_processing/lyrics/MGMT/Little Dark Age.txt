Breathing in the dark, lying on its side
The ruins of the day painted with a scar
And the more I straighten out, the less it wants to try
The feelings start to rot one wink at a time

Oh-oh
Forgiving who you are for what you stand to gain
Just know that if you hide, it doesn't go away
When you get out of bed, don't end up stranded
Horrified with each stone
On the stage, my little dark age

Picking through the cards, knowing what's nearby
The carvings on the fetish say they find it hard
And the engine's failed again, all limits of disguise
The humor's not the same, coming from denial

Oh-oh
I grieve in stereo, the stereo sounds strange
I know that if you hide, it doesn't go away
If you get out of bed and find me standing
All alone, open-eyed
Burn the page, my little dark age
You might also like
Little dark age, little dark age
Little dark age, little dark age

I grieve in stereo, the stereo sounds strange
You know that if it hides, it doesn't go away
If I get out of bed, you'll see me standing
All alone, horrified
On the stage, my little dark age

Giddy with delight, seeing what's to come
The image of the dead, dead ends in my mind

Policemen swear to God, love's seeping from the guns
I know my friends and I would probably turn and run
If you get out of bed, come find us heading
For the bridge, bring a stone
All the rage, my little dark age

I grieve in stereo, the stereo sounds strange
I know that if you hide, it doesn't go away
If you get out of bed and find me standing
All alone, open-eyed
Burn the page, my little dark age
All alone, open-eyed
