There's a place I'd like to go somewhere out west
It's not specific, and the pictures show it best
I know there's trees, I know there's sand, I know there's grass
I know it's somewhere in the past
And there's a girl out there who's looking for it too
She's not sure when she'll go or exactly what she'll do
If I am doomed am I the first one or the last?
Am I just someone from the past?

No one has to hear
The sound of people laughing at their fears
And the ocean
And sun are always there
To make you happy if you're feeling scared
Of the darkness

If I ever saw a ghost, it'd change the way I think
I wouldn't gasp for air if ever I did sink
I wouldn't struggle, I'd just let it all out fast
And then start living in the past

No one has to hear
If we hold the hand that raised the hand
The sound of people laughing at their fears
And everyone can feel the hand
And the ocean
And nothing's gonna change
And sun are always there
It could be the time we're living in
To make you happy if you're feeling scared
We'll never feel so safe again
Of the darkness
But love always remains
