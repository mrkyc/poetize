Metanoia, reshaping the world
It can teach you and reprogram you
It can show you the flood that's trapped inside
This one's alive
Tale is breathing and she's listening
Kill the serpent, divide, disperse and grow
Into an oak
Silver lining on a black scale
Wicked hunter, on three hooves, he still rode
But where is the fourth?
You can climb there to your lofty perch
It can teach you the fairy tale of hurt

Ooooh, aaaah!

Mystic referee, don't look on me with scorn
I'm a child; I'm a lover being born
Satchidananda
Disregard the path I'm on
You might also like
You can justify the action should you bless
My ambition and my indecisiveness
Satchidananda
Let me know that you exist

Watch me tremble as I'm answering the phone
I am separate from everything you know

Mystic referee, I promise to return
Once I've given up and lessons have been learned
Satchidananda
You can watch my fire burn

"We were talking junk, right?"
"Yeah."
"Just before the show, this wild-eyed kid came up to the fence
He took one look at us, and he said..."

Help me! Drummer!
Ticket! Yeah!
Help me! Drummer!
Ticket! Yeah!
Help me! Drummer!
Ticket! Yeah!
Help me! Drummer!
Ticket! Yeah!
We didn't play his favorite song
Now he'll never come to another show
Now he'll never come to another show
Now he'll never come to another show
Now he'll never come to another show
Now he'll never come to another show
Now he'll never come to another show

Hospitals and woods confirm (Now he'll never come to another show, now he'll never come to another show)
Red in the eyes of everyone (Now he'll never come to another show, now he'll never come to another show)
Parasites and lovers scrape the meat from bones (Now he'll never come to another show)
Turned into jade and tiger's eye
Save me some dark hair over a face like hers
She'll help the rain come to a pour
Bathroom floor of stone and tiles broke in two
Warm where they touch her porcelain, timid skin
I'm careful to untie this rope
Wrapped in a knot, indifferent
Lion's foot unearthing all the things I've seen
But never truly understood
Rotten wood, from oceans that were never green
Crumbles beneath the canopy, secretly
(Let's pretend he never touched the sugar)


Tonight, under rose
You won't find another wheel to roll
When autumn winds appear
We wear these fears on our right
We just wants to be surreal, cause
All dressed in diamond image jeans
Mercury's found in old field
We miserable in love
And chance we walked right on in
Into the streets of the city, but

Watching people disappear
Without reaching out
Years and years
You're left by yourself
On the wheel
