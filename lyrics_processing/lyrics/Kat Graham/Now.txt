I know it's over now
'Cause I got the right man I love
I finally stopped the calls
Yeah, I had to give you up
No more silly games, ain't tryna play the fool
But when I see your face I feel like I used to

I dare you just to get, just a little closer
Got me feeling like baby, this ain't over
I dare you just to get, just a little closer
Got me feeling like baby, this ain't over

What are we gonna do now
When you've got your girl and I've got my man (my man)
Keep it on the low 'cause they will never understand
What are we gonna do now
When you've got your girl and I've got my man (my man)
Keep it on the low 'cause they will never understand

I had to stop this love
It wasn't right to keep
'Cause you ain't leaving her
No, he ain't leaving me
I think , never meant to be
But damn, I miss your touch
And all the things you did to me
You might also like
I dare you just to get, just a little closer
Got me feeling like baby, this ain't over
I dare you just to get, just a little closer
Got me feeling like baby, this ain't over

What are we gonna do now
When you've got your girl and I've got my man (my man)
Keep it on the low 'cause they will never understand
What are we gonna do now
When you've got your girl and I've got my man (my man)
Keep it on the low 'cause they will never understand

Let's keep it, keep it on the low
Let's keep it, keep it on the low (let's keep it)
Let's keep it, keep it on the low (let's keep it)
Let's keep it, keep it on the low, oh, oh

What are we gonna do now
When you've got your girl and I've got my man (my man)
Keep it on the low 'cause they will never understand
