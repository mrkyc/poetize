Tell me, how long can you make-believe?
Secrets and whispers between you and me
It isn't explicit consistencies
Hold up, hold up

Being secret lovers just don't cut it no more
Ain't gonna hear it no more
I'm walkin' out of the door
Don't need to hear no excuses
Just want to live where the truth is
Got to be free, got to do this

Free to feel the magic
Free to feel the madness of love
Free to feel the magic, the passion
Holdin' on to love, holdin' on to love
I just wanna be free

Happy to wait, but where's my safer days?
Ain't getting younger, seeing seasons change
I've been praying, chance to take your name (hold up)
But ain't no photo of me in your frame (hold up)
You might also like
Just so you can make her feeling happy some more
You're compromising my soul, ain't playing into your role
Don't need to hear no excuses
Just want to live where the truth is
Got to be free, got to do this

Free to feel the magic
Free to feel the madness of love
Free to feel the magic, the passion
Holdin' on to love, holdin' on to love
I just wanna be free

"Sometimes women, we judge ourselves based on a man's love for us. When we don't get back what we put in, we chop ourselves down and say love is just not for us. The right man will step up, just walk away from the one that won't. The magic is out there. Hold on."

Free to feel the magic (free to feel it)
Free to feel the madness of love
Free to feel the magic, the passion
Holdin' on to love, holdin' on to love
Free to feel the magic (free to feel the magic)
Free to feel the madness of love
Free to feel the magic, the passion
