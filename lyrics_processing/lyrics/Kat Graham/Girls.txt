Bet you went and thought we didn't need ya
We just wanna have a little fun now
'Cause we are calling all the boys out
Can we see if we can get down, hey now

We can have a little, have a little party now
No we ain't too serious knowing us
We're gonna boogie 'cause we know how to get down

Won't be home till the morning
And you better make me breakfast in bed
I don't care if the phone rings
You can memorize my body instead
We can groove it all day
And when I've had enough of you
Time to call my girls and go play
I won't do what you tell me to
