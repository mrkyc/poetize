Thinkin' 'bout you, baby, I know you made me crazy
How I miss our problems, our fights and all our dramas
But I get to have a night, it's time that you be right
I can say "I never thought you'd leave me ever"

Beggin' time on the rework
Thought we were good but you were all a fat lie
Wanna try and try to make this thing right
But you love to give me such a good vibe

What the funk do I do, I do without you?
What do I do without you, now?
What the funk do I do, I do without you?
What do I do without you, now?

You would never wanna be trusting me, a memory
What's done is done, you say to me "but that don't change reality"
When you were here, I'd make-believe that we had all eternity
I would run and you would say "I'm here for you, come be with me"

Beggin' time on the rework
Thought we were good but you were all a fat lie
Wanna try and try to make this thing right
But you love to give me such a good vibe
