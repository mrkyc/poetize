And nothing's gonna hold me back
Kat Graham
I want it all
Don't know who you think I am
Don't need you watch
Go keep your benz
Got me saying, go take a walk
Cause boys just talk, talk, talk
Don't need 'em cause I got my own

And nothing's gonna hold me back
I want it all
Im gonna take what I want
Nothing's gonna stand on my way
That's why im
Putting you on notice
Everything and no less
