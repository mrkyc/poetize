It was a long time coming when you came here to me
Seven year relationship but it was down on its knees
And he was everything that I was craving, I need
And it didn't take much to rip my chains and be free

I had everything I wanted
But it wasn't what I wanted, it seemed
House on a hilltop
Wedding dress and a diamond ring

Fool for ya love, I'm a fool for ya love
Fool for ya love, I'm a fool for ya love
Fool for ya love, I'm a fool for ya love
Fool for ya love, I'm a fool for ya love

Never met a guy that made me feel so in love (so in love)
Did everything stupid that a women does
He had me at "hello" and I knew I was hooked
 back all my life and ran as fast as I could

I had everything I wanted
But it wasn't what I wanted, it seemed
House on a hilltop
Wedding dress and a diamond ring (oh, yeah)
