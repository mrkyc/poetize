Denim-jean jacket, pink chucks and a mini skirt
Be your bad habit, throw me up against the wall first
I take advantage of you, you take advantage of me
Drink up this bottle again and paint your body on me

Put your graffiti on me
Put your graffiti on me
Put your graffiti on me
Tag me, tag me

Put your name on it
Put your, put your name on it
Put your name on it
Put your, put your name-
Put your name on it
Put your, put your name on it
Put your name on it
Put your, put your name on it

Cotton-candy, lollipop, sticky like a post-it
You don't need to drum my heart, you already own it
I take advantage of you, you take advantage of me
Drink up this bottle again and paint your body on me

Put your, put your name on it

Put your, put your name-

Treat me like concrete under your feet
I'll be your canvas, incomplete
Your paper-doll, your alley wall, heart in graffiti
Tag me, tag me
