Mirror, mirror on the wall
Who's the freshest one of all?
I think that I am (Sassy), I know that I am
Mirror, mirror on the wall
"Sassy girl" that's what I'm called
I think that I am (Sassy), I know that I am

I'm sassy, sassy as I wanna
Picture perfect poster girl
Yeah, I'm off the wall
Raise your hands my sexy girls, my classy girl
Independent flashy girl
Watch your own cash falls, rocks and pearls
Drive your whip with your sassy girl

My lipgloss and my Fendi
My rings, they cost your Bently
I'm a sassy girl (I am)
I'm a sassy girl (I am)
My Gucci's to my Prada
Share my powder to mascara
I'm a sassy girl (I am)
I'm a sassy girl (Who, me?)
