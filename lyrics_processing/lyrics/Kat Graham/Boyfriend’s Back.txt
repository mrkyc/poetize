Hey ladies! (Yeah!)
All my ladies! (Yeah!)
Are you sick and tired of him acting shady? (Yeah!)
Let him go, let him leave
Tell him get up off his knees
No more begging "Baby, please"
It's a wrap on this scene, cut

I think it's 'bout that time you let him know (Let him know)
That you feelin' like his love went out the door (Out the door)
If you tried, but it ain't work
And he keep on doin' dirt
Keep your cool, don't go berserk
Just let him go (Let him go)

All my ladies! (Yeah!)
We independent, we can get our own Mercedes! (Yeah!)
Don't need his lips or his rocks
He can keep that stuff I bought
If it's cash, I got lots
It ain't nothin' I can't cop

I think it's 'bout that time you let him know (Let him know)
That you feelin' like his love went out the door (Out the door)

It's over, yeah, yeah, it's over!
