Summer call me hot, say I'm cold in the winter
Feelin' this heat, I'm turning up the tempera-ture
Got a chip 'cause I waited to enter
So back out my way 'cause I gotta avenge her
10 whole years and I just got commend her
Gimme a lil' stage and the crowd to attend it
Got a little jam and the skill to assist it
No hater can't stop if God manifests it
Been around this block and I'm now ready to leave it
Grew up with no stash, ready to receive it
So gimme all your loot, all your gold, all your cash
'Cause me and my crew, yeah, we makin' the dash

World is, world is
Mine now, mine now
(The world is mine)
World is, world is
Mine now, mine now
(The world is mine)
World is, world is
Mine now, mine now
(The world is mine)
World is, world is
Mine now, mine now
(The world is mine)

I know you likin' my beat
I know you likin' my beat
I know you likin' my beat
You gotta jam to my sound
And get down with me
I know you likin' my beat
I know you likin' my beat
I know you likin' my beat
You gotta jam to my sound
And get down with me

It's a black out, gimme all your power
Listen to me jam and come and turn me up louder
Taking it back to 1991
Got my Cross colors United Benetton on
Cassette tape overdub the beat how I want it
Bet they never thought I'd be this big of an artist
Put away your keyboard, pick up the mic
And sing everything the label like
Well fuck y'all, I can finally do what I want
Got enough cash, hustling like I'm not
Watch me take a swing and take it to the moon
Taking it back like it was something new
World is, world is
Mine now, mine now
(The world is mine)
World is, world is
Mine now, mine now
(The world is mine)
World is, world is
Mine now, mine now
(The world is mine)
World is, world is
Mine now, mine now
(The world is mine)

I know you likin' my beat
I know you likin' my beat
I know you likin' my beat
You gotta jam to my sound
And get down with me
I know you likin' my beat
I know you likin' my beat
I know you likin' my beat
You gotta jam to my sound
And get down with me
Know you feeling like
You jammin' to that old school
I'm here to take you there
Start jammin to that old school
Know you feeling like
You jammin' to that old school
I'm here to take you there
Start jammin to that old school

Taking it back, taking it back
Taking it back to 1991
Taking it back, taking it back
Taking it back to 1991
Taking it back, taking it back
Taking it back to 1991
Taking it back, taking it back
