You love me when I'm wild, and even when I'm crazy
But isn't that the way it's s'pposed to be
And even when you're mad, and just a little cranky, yeah
Boy you still get the best of me

If you want it, give it on up
And if you need it, give it on up
You got to have it, give it on up
Just say "give it, to me baby", come on

I, can't, give, up, we'll never be. over
Ev-, -ery, break, up, only brings us clo-, -ser boy
Old school lovin', like we're, from nine, teen, nine-, -ty one
Take it back so much, we're back, in nine, teen, nine-, -ty one

I'll give you all my time, and even all my money (-ven all my money)
As long as you stay good to me (to me, to me, to me)
Cause even when your boys, are acting kinda funny, yeah
You know you can still come home to me

If you want it, give it on up
And if you need it, give it on up
You got to have it, give it on up
Just say "give it, to me baby", come on
