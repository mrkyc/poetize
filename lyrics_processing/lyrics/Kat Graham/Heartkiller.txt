Eighteen wheeler, stone cold killer
Hit it and quit her, baby
No heart stealer, sex dealer
Don't pull the trigger, bang bang

No, you're never gonna (Take me out)
Never, never gonna (Take me out, eh eh)
Shoulda know better, if you go get her
You'll end up in flames, flames

Uh oh, there you go
Gun in your holster, ready to blow
Uh oh, there you go
Huntin' me down like an animal
Uh oh, there you go
Uh oh, t-t-there you go
Uh oh, there you go
There you go, there you go

I don't wanna be ya, see ya, hear ya
You're a heartkiller
I don't wanna feel ya, can't be near ya
You're a heartkiller
A murderer, serial lover
I don't wanna be ya, see ya, hear ya
You're a heartkiller
You're a heartkiller

Big fat liar, pants on fire
To you, ain't nothin' but a game game
Preachin' to the choir, bullets keep flyin'
Bet ya look good in red, red

No, you're never gonna (Take me out)
Never, never gonna (Take me out, eh eh)
Shoulda know better, if you go get her

Chalk lines on the floor
If I let you in-in, no
I'll never become
Victim to your touch
Damaged by your love, love, love
