I've been cold enough
You could be the kind of guy who blows the clouds away
And stops the rain
Heartbreak and all those feelings
I'll risk it all for a chance to make you mine
All the time
Let's run together in the sunshine
(Together in the sunshine)
Baby, it's a long hot summer
You've been on my mind
Baby, all the time
Wanna make you mine (Come on)
Wanna make you mine (Come on)
Baby, it's a long hot summer
We got all the time
Let me make you mine
Wanna make you mine (Summer)
Wanna make you mine (Summer)
Day or night, baby it's right
Summer lovin', they say it happens so fast
And that it won't last (that it won't last)
But when you touch me I know that this ain't a fling (this ain't a fling)
It's the real thing (a real thing, baby)
You might also likeHeartbreak and all those feelings
I'll risk it all for a chance to make you mine (make you mine)
All the time (All the time)
Let's run together in the sunshine
(Together in the sunshine)
Baby, it's a long hot summer
You've been on my mind
Baby, all the time
Wanna make you mine (Come on)
Wanna make you mine (Come on)
Baby, it's a long hot summer
We got all the time
Let me make you mine
Wanna make you mine (Summer)
Wanna make you mine (Summer)
Day or night, baby it's right
Long hot summer
Baby, it would be
Oh, just you and me
Baby, it's a long hot summer
You've been on my mind
Baby, all the time
Wanna make you mine (Come on)
Wanna make you mine (Come on)
Baby, it's a long hot summer
We got all the time
Let me make you mine
Wanna make you mine (Summer)
Wanna make you mine (Summer)
