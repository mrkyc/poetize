They say love don't pay the bills
Baby, your rent check kinda late
When you wanna make it work
But time is money, you ain't saved
If money, greed, and love well maybe
Baby you'll be stray, you'd buy back everything
That your broke ass couldn't take

But when you got pocket full of nothing
Cell phone service interrupted
Collar gone from where you left it
Guess the ribbon means I kept it
Sleeping on your mama's floor
Can't stay praying to the Lord
Friends are waiting at the door
Of a club you can't afford

You say you really want my love
I know love should be enough
Time is money, time is money
Even if you got me everything I want
See, I'd do nothing, I'd do nothing
You might also like
When you're out on a dime
And you're boozin' your mind
And you can't seem to find a break
When you can't pay your rent
And your checks haven't spent
And you can't seem to get a break

They say money can't buy love
Well, that's alright with me
'Cause even if you could
That would put you on the street
Don't got much to your name
And by much, don't got a thing
But if he want your heart
Well, baby your love don't cost a thing

But when you got pocket full of nothing
Cell phone service interrupted
Collar gone from where you left it
Guess the ribbon means I kept it
Sleeping on your mama's floor
Can't stay praying to the Lord
Friends are waiting at the door
Of a club you can't afford
You say you really want my love
I know love should be enough
Time is money, time is money
Even if you got me everything I want
See, I'd do nothing, I'd do nothing

When you're out on a dime
And you're boozin' your mind
And you can't seem to find a break
When you can't pay your rent
And your checks haven't spent
And you can't seem to get a break

I'll be all the money that you need
We can live on kisses and on dreams
Pay for life with love and our beliefs
They ain't got nothing on you and me

You say you really want my love
I know love should be enough
Time is money, time is money
Even if you got me everything I want
See, I'd do nothing, I'd do nothing
When you're out on a dime
And you're boozin' your mind
And you can't seem to find a break
When you can't pay your rent
And your checks haven't spent
