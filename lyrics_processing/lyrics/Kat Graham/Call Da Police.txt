All units, I've got an emergency
All units, all u- all u- all u-
All units, all u- all u- all u-
All units, all u- all u- all u-
I've got an emergency
I say, ooh, better call da police now
I say, ooh, better call da police now

Comin' through on the wire, got my heart on fire
Your cigar to my lighter, it's fillin', lifting me higher
You're the bass in my speaker, sweat drippin' on that beer
My heel to your sneaker, got me kissin' every inch of you

I say, ooh, better call da police now
I say, ooh, better call da police now
I say, ooh, better call da police now
If they comin' through the night
Try to take away my life
Gon' get knocked down, drag out, fight

Cuff me to the Polo 'cause I can't ever let go
Shoot the peace, make it real
I'll be the smell, catch your pillow
Hot gun on your holster, load it up; make it fire
No, I can't even hide it and I ain't gonna fight it now

I say, ooh, better call da police now
I say, ooh, better call da police now
I say, ooh, better call da police now
If they comin' through the night
Try to take away my life
Gon' get knocked down, drag out, fight

I don't wanna go to jail and leave my life
I want my freedom, I want to be your wife
I want your love, your sex, give me all your time
And I, baby I could, baby I could make you mine
I need your love, love, love, love, not your cash
If you want me, baby, you better make it fast
I got a  at a quater to one
And baby, it's about that time I want it
I want you, babe

I say, ooh, better call da police now
I say, ooh, better call da police now
I say, ooh, better call da police now
If they comin' through the night
Try to take away my life
Gon' get knocked down, drag out, fight
Because I'm feening
I'm feening above the law
They better lock me up forever
'Cause I'm feening above the law
'Cause I've been feening above the law
'Cause I've been feening above the law
They better lock me up forever
I say, ooh, better call da police now
I say, ooh, better call da police now
They better lock me up forever
