It almost feels like it was just a dream
All these memories of you and me
Blown away in the summer breeze
It almost feels like we just never were
All the time we spent was just a blur
Now it's just me and the melody

So what am I supposed to do?
'Cause all these plans we made in the sand are through

Without you, I'm on my own
Am I gonna be alone?
And if it's only me, myself, and I
Will I be fine?
So far from home
And I just don't know
Am I gonna make it?
Brave enough to take this road
Out on my own

Lookin' in the mirror, it's hard to see
All these choices that I'm caught between
Who I should or who I wanna be
I wanna send in, take this wave
And ride into a brighter day
I'll take a chance and bet on me
You might also like
I think that I
Know what to do
I got all these plans, I'm a one man band, it's true
Now I can't lose

Out on my own
Never gonna be alone
As long as I got me, myself, and I
I'm doing fine
So far from home
I just don't know
Am I gonna make it?
Brave enough to take this road
Out on my own (Oh, oh-oh)
Out on my own (Oh, oh-oh)
Out on my own

Maybe I'm fallin' on my face
Or maybe I'm landin' in my place
And maybe we're a million miles apart
Or maybe we're standin' heart to heart
But no matter what, I'm walkin' right off this stage
And never lookin' back, lookin' back to yesterday
No way, no way
(I'm on my own) I'm on my own
(Yeah, yeah) But never gonna be alone
As long as I got me, myself, and I
I'm doing fine
So far from home
But now I know that I am gonna make it
Brave enough to take this road
Out on my own (Oh, oh-oh)
Out on my own (Oh, oh-oh)
Out on my own

It almost feels like it was just a dream
