If I could stop the world tonight
I would... freeze this moment in time (time)
Oh if I (if I) only could (only could)
Our bodies dance like the wind over and over again
In a perfect sky
Hypnotized by the sound
I get lost and then found in your eyes

'Cause it doesn't get better than this (no, it doesn't)
No it doesn't get (better than) better than this (better than this)
Oh, if we could stop the world tonight
I think that we should try
'Cause it doesn't get better than this
Oh, better

If we could have one night on repeat this is it
Over and over we dance to the beat to exist (ooh)
We're gonna live while we're young
So let's wait for the sun
Before we go home
Lock it all in our minds
Memorize it tonight
'Cause we all know, oh, oh
You might also like
That it doesn't get better than this (no, it doesn't)
No it doesn't get (better than) better than this (better than this)
Oh, if we could stop the world tonight
I think that we should try
'Cause it doesn't get better than this
Oh, better


Ha!
I can't believe that before I was looking up
If it's a dream I don't ever want to wake up
It's a scene and I can't, can't get enough
Tonight is all about us
So live tonight like it's your last
Like there's no future in your past
Oh if we could stop the world tonight
I think that we should try (should try...)

'Cause it doesn't get better than this (no, it doesn't)
No it doesn't get (better than) better than this (better than this)
Oh, if we could stop the world tonight
I think that we should try (I think that we should try)
'Cause it doesn't get better than this
