When the crowd wants more
I bring on the thunder
'Cause you got my back
And I'm not going under
You're my point, you're my guard
You're the perfect chord
And I see our names together on every billboard

We're headed for the top
We got it on lock
We'll make 'em say, "Hey!"
'Cause there's no stopping us when we hit
The same but different
We're never gonna quit
And we'll keep rocking

There's no way I can make it without you
Do it without you
Be here without you
It's no fun when you're doing it solo
With you, it's like whoa
Yeah, and I know
I, own this dream
'Cause I've got you with me
There's no way I can make it without you
Do it without you
Be here without you
You might also like
You got the skills
And I'm bringing the fire
You're the fuel to my rocket
And it's taking us higher
Yeah, we got my flow
And we're blowin' it up
All our fans are gonna scream
'Cause they can't get enough

We're headed for the top
We got it on lock
We'll make 'em say, "Hey!"
'Cause there's no stopping us when we hit
The same but different
Were never gonna quit
And we'll keep rockin', oh!

There's no way I can make it without you
Do it without you
Be here without you
It's no fun when you're doing it solo
With you, it's like whoa
Yeah, and I know
I, own this dream
'Cause I've got you with me
There's no way I can make it without you
Do it without you
Be here without you
(Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!)
I keep on rockin' with you
(Oh! Oh! Oh!)
And there's no stoppin us
(Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!)
I keep on rockin' with you
Ke-keep on rockin'
I, will keep on rockin

There's no way I can make it without you
Do it without you
Be here without you
It's no fun when you're doing it solo
With you, it's like whoa
Yeah, and I know
I, own this dream
'Cause I've got you with me
There's no way I can make it without you
Do it without you
Be here without you

Whoa
Be here without you
Whoa-oh-oh
Be here without you - out you - out you
