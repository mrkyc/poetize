What up?!

Summer in the sand, he's a drummer in the band
Droppin' the beat, she's a DJ at the boardwalk
A smile and a tan, and her sandals in her hand
Rockin' the shades, you could almost see their eyes lock
What could be better than a party and the weather
With the both of us together in the backdrop?
Everything was right and the day turned into night
With the music and the lights, that's where we stop

Oh, I heard it on the radio
Sing it out loud
Oh, comin' down to see your show
Uh, uh, oh (Everybody now)
I heard it on the radio (Oh-oh)
Uh, uh, oh (Everybody now)
Comin' down to see your show
Uh, uh, oh (Play it back, play it back, one time, yeah)
I heard it on the radio

Board and a wet suit on the day we met
You said, "I think of you as catchin' a wave"
Shorts and a jet ski, all the other summer things
Kickin' it in the sun all day (Oh, oh)
We only got time for each other (Yeah)
And we only got time for the summer (For the summer)
Everybody knows, if you gotta let it go
Takin' a chance, makin' it go your way

Oh, I heard it on the radio
Sing it out loud
Oh, comin' down to see your show
Uh, uh, oh (Everybody now)
I heard it on the radio (Oh-oh)
Uh, uh, oh (Everybody now)
Comin' down to see your show
Uh, uh, oh (Play it back, play it back, one time, yeah)
I heard it on the radio

Listen to the story 'bout the party, 'bout the glory
'Bout the summer that would raise the bar
Anyone will tell you it was chill, it was stellar
The best time we've had so far
Everyone together, always going, "Never better"
And the good times go on and on and on
Never will forget it, doesn't matter where we're headed
I'll remember when I hear our song
What!

Oh, I heard it on the radio
Oh, comin' down to see your show
Uh, uh, oh (Everybody now)
I heard it on the radio (Oh, oh)
Uh, uh, oh (Everybody now)
Comin' down to see your show
Uh, uh, oh, heard it on the radio
Uh, uh, oh (Everybody now)
I heard it on the radio (Oh, oh)
Uh, uh, oh (Everybody now)
Comin' down to see your show
Uh, uh, oh (Oh)
