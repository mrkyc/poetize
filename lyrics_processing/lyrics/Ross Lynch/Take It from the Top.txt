Take, take, take, take it from the
Take, take, take it from the top and I
Take, take, take, take it from the
Take, take, take it from the top and I

You never know what this world has in store for you
You break down walls so they don't block your point of view
Stand tall, keep your head up cause you're ready to break through
And if you want to start anew, then all you got to do is

Take it from the top
When I'm in over my head
Take it from the top
I push replay and start again
Take it from the top
Sometimes it might feel strange how fast it all can change
You know I never stopped
Take it from the top

The future's never promised far from guaranteed
The brighter days are always just within your reach
A new beginning is the only thing you need
I know you want to feel it too
So all you got to do is
You might also like
Take it from the top
When I'm in over my head
Take it from the top
I push replay and start again
Take it from the top
Sometimes it might feel strange how fast it all can change
You know I never stopped
Take it from the top

Take, take, take, take it from the
Take, take, take it from the top and I
Take, take, take, take it from the
Take, take, take it from the top and I

Take it from the top
When I'm in over my head
Take it from the top
I push replay and start again
Take it from the top
Sometimes it might feel strange how fast it all can change
You know I never stopped
Take it from the top
(Take, take, take, take it from the)
(Take, take, take it from the top and I)
Take it from the top
(Take, take, take, take it from the)
(Take, take, take it from the top)
Sometimes it might feel strange how fast it all can change
You know I never stopped
