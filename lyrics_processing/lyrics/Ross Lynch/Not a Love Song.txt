You're always on my mind
I think about you all the time
Uhm, no

Let's not talk about it
"Drama", we can live without it
Catch a wave if we're bored
There's a clock we'll ignore
Find a way around it
Hey, girl, I can tell there's something
Even when you say it's nothing
When you're playin' with your hair
Like you just don't care
It's a tell you're bluffing
Now please don't take this the wrong way

I love the things you do
It's how you do the things you love
But it's not a love song
Not a love song
I love the way you get me
But correct me if I'm wrong
This is not a love song
Not a love song

I love that you bought a ticket (Uh-uh)
And you don't make me watch a chick flick
We've come so far, bein' just the way we are
If it's not broke, don't fix it
I can't guess the meaning
When you don't say what you're feeling
If you got a broken heart
You can punch me in the arm
Now that's what you're needing (That's what you're needing)
Don't take this the wrong way (Nope)

I love the things you do
It's how you do the things you love
But it's not a love song
Not a love song
I love the way you get me
But correct me if I'm wrong
This is not a love song
Not a love song

I don't speak girl (Like, "Hey girl!")
I don't quite understand a manicure
But you're the only friend I'd take a shower for (And I would really do that for you)
And I would hold your bags when you go shopping
What a guy (What a guy, what a guy, what a guy)
What a guy
I love the things you do
It's how you do the things you love
The way you say it (Hey)
You'd put me through it
I guess I always knew it (I Always knew)
I love the way you get me
But correct me if I'm wrong
This is not a love song (Not a love song)
Not a love song (I know it's not a love song)

I love the things you do
It's how you do the things you love
But it's not a love song (No, definitely not a love song)
Not a love song
I love the way you get me
But correct me if I'm wrong
This is not a love song (It's not a love song)
Not a love song
This is not a love song (It's not a love song)
Not a love song
This is not a love song (It's not a love song)
