I'll be your entertainer
I'm putting on a show
I'm gonna levitate ya
Leave you wa-wa-wanting more
I see you fascinated
I've got you hypnotized
White gloves, put your dream up
A fantasy before your eyes

Step right up on the stage
Free yourself from the cage
Pick a card and guess it, girl
Here's a lesson, girl
It's just an illusion

One, two, three, I disappear
Coming right back
So stay right here
Ain't no second guessing, girl
I'm impressing, girl
But I'm just an illusion

Ohh, uh, listen
I ain't no fake Houdini
I put a spell on you
I'm something like a genie
Girl, I'll make your wish come true
And now our time is running
With every grain of sand
So here's the grand finale
Watch me do my sleight of hand

But I'm just an illusion

Somewhere in a dream
We'll meet again my baby
And I promise that I won't disappear
I'll be right here
And I won't be, won't be, won't be
Just an illusion
Yeah, baby
