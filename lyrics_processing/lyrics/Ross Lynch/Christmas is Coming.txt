Oh Oh
Christmas is coming
Those elves and reindeer are running
And I just want you by my side

Santa, is coming to town
And you're not gonna be around
This snow, is bringing me down
'Cause tomorrow's gonna be a big day

And you're world's away
I'd give anything
If we'd could sing
Fa la la la la la la la la la la

Oh Oh
Christmas is coming
Those elves and reindeer are running
And I just want you by my side

This year, the season is crazy
Snow globes, that somebody's shaken
That's what makes it Christmas time
You might also like
Presents, under the tree
Could never mean as much to me
As you here
That's why I believe
That when I see Santa's sleigh

Heading this way
He's gonna hear my wishes
And know I miss ya
Fa la la la la la la la la la la

Oh Oh
Christmas is coming
Those elves and reindeer are running
And I just want you by my side

This year, the season is crazy
Snow globes, that somebody's shaken
That's what makes it Christmas time

If we could all be together
In crazy Christmas sweaters
I know that Santa hears me
Loud and clear
Don't ya hear me now
Oh Oh
Christmas is coming
Those elves and reindeer are running
And I just want you by my side

Ooh Yeah
This year, the season is crazy
Snow globes, that somebody's shaken
That's what makes it Christmas time
Yeah Yeah Yeah

Oh Oh
Christmas is coming
Those elves and reindeer are running
And I just want you by my side
(Oh Yeah)

This year, the season is crazy
Snow globes, that somebody's shaken
That's what makes it Christmas time

Oh Woah
Oh Woah Oh Oh
That's what makes it
