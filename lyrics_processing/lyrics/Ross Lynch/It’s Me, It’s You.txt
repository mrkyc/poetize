I like the bass when it booms
You like the high-end treble
I'm like the ninety-ninth floor
And you're cool on street level
I like the crowd rock, rock-rock-rocking it loud
You like the sound of hush, hush
Hey! Keep it down

High tops, flip flops, retro, dance, pop
We rock different ways
Beach bum, city fun, touchdown, home run
What can I say-ay-ay?

It's me, (It's me)
It's you (It's you)
I know we're not the same, but we do what we do!
It's you (It's you) and it's me (And it's me)
And who says that we have to agree?
'Cause I like
What I like
And sometimes we collide
But it's me (But it's me)
And it's you (And it's you)
I know we're not the same
But we do what we do
You might also like
You like going to the mall
I'm into video games
I like sleeping till noon
You say "dude that's too late"
I'm pulling in a fast car strummin' guitars
I'm shooting for stars
Yeah I'm taking it far

High tops, flip flops, retro, dance, pop
We rock different ways
Beach bum, city fun, touchdown, home run
What can I say-ay-ay?

It's me, (It's me)
It's you (It's you)
I know we're not the same, but we do what we do!
It's you (It's you) and it's me (And it's me)
And who says that we have to agree?
'Cause I like
What I like
And sometimes we collide
But it's me (But it's me)
And it's you (And it's you)
I know we're not the same
But we do what we do
Onstage, offstage
We're gonna rock no matter what
Drumsticks, guitarless
It's you and me at the top

It's me, (It's me)
It's you (It's you)
I know we're not the same, but we do what we do!
It's you (It's you) and it's me (And it's me)
And who says that we have to agree?
It's me, (It's me)
It's you (It's you)
I know we're not the same, but we do what we do!
It's you (It's you) and it's me (And it's me)
And who says that we have to agree?
'Cause I like
What I like
And sometimes we collide
But it's me (But it's me)
And it's you (And it's you)
I know we're not the same
