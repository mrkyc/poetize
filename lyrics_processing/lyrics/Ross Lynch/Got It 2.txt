Yo!

Through the door, here's the score
Never seen her here before
Run her fingers through her hair
And I just can't help but stare
Behind those shades, hard to see
Tell me, what's it gonna be?
Set myself up, count to three
Hey now, what's come over me?

Whatever it is I got it
Don't know what to call it
There's no way to hide it
Do you got it too?
Whatever it is I got it
Don't know what to call it
There's no way around it
Do you got it too?

Woah-oh-oh
Yeah, you got it too
Woah-oh-oh
Girl, you got it too
Woah-oh-oh
Yeah, you got it too
Woah-oh-oh
Girl, you got it too

Where's the game? What's that voice?
Like I even have a choice
Did I really shake your hand?
Did you know I'm in a band?
How do you study for this test?
Still not sure if you're impressed
Then you smile a certain way
Kinda like you wanna say
"This is crazy!"

Whatever it is I got it
Don't know what to call it
There's no way to hide it
Yeah, I got it too
Whatever it is I got it
Don't know what to call it
There's no way around it
Yeah, I got it too

Woah-oh-oh
Yeah, you got it too
Woah-oh-oh
Girl, you got it too
Woah-oh-oh
Yeah, you got it too
Woah-oh-oh
Girl, you got it too
More than some of it, we got all of it
Let's get crazy, wild like we're callin' it
Drop the beat, so hot you need sunscreen
Spin like a remix, signed like a done deal
Not just anything, we got everything
Swag is king, so fight for the title ring
No time to quit 'cause it feels like a hit
Oh-oh-oh yeah!

Whatever it is I got it
Don't know what to call it
There's no way to hide it
Yeah, I got it too
Whatever it is I got it
Don't know what to call it
There's no way around it
Yeah, I got it too

Woah-oh-oh
Yeah you got it too
Woah-oh-oh
Girl, you got it too
Woah-oh-oh
Yeah you got it too
Woah-oh-oh
Girl, you got it too
Woah-oh-oh
Yeah you got it too
Woah-oh-oh
Girl, you got it too
Woah-oh-oh
Girl, you got it too
