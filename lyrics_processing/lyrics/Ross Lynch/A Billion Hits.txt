Didn't go nowhere, never left, uh
You really thought that I was gone (Gone, gone, gone)
I heard you talkin' like I lost my swagger
Said I was over you were wrong (Wrong, wrong, wrong)

I'm always improving
Always on the move and
Workin' on my flow
To take it to the studio
This is not a comeback
Followin' my own path
Layin' down the fat tracks
(Still a music maniac)

Whoa, well, I know that I'll make it
Never put my head down
T-T-Turn it up loud
Yeah, 'cause I don't have to fake it
If I keep on workin' it
A billion hits is what I'll get

Whoa, oh, oh, oh-oh
That's what I'm gonna get
Whoa, oh, oh, oh-oh
That's what I'm gonna get
Yeah, 'cause I know that I'll make it
Overload the internet
A billion hits is what I'll get
A billion hits is what I'll get
You might also like
Now you can't breathe
Why so quiet?
No, you don't believe your eyes (Eyes, eyes, eyes)
You pushed me 'til I had to start this riot
Now I'll never be denied (-nied, -nied, -nied)

I'm always improving
Always on the move and
Workin' on my flow
'Til ya hear me on the radio
I know I can be a star
Take off like a rocket car
Everyday I'm workin' hard
To get my name on every chart

Whoa, well, I know that I'll make it
Never put my head down
T-T-Turn it up loud
Yeah, 'cause I don't have to fake it
If I keep on workin' it
A billion hits is what I'll get

Whoa, oh, oh, oh-oh
That's what I'm gonna get
Whoa, oh, oh, oh-oh
That's what I'm gonna get
Yeah, 'cause I know that I'll make it
Overload the internet
A billion hits is what I'll get
Call someone
I think this is an emergency
Hey, pull the plug
Austin's blowin' up my P.C
Every hour, day and night
Can't get this rocker off my site (Site, site, site)
You can't get me outta your site
You can't get me outta your site
You thought that I was gone
Guess that you were wrong
'Cause I just wrote your new favorite song

Whoa, well, I know that I'll make it
Never put my head down
T-T-Turn it up loud
Yeah, 'cause I don't have to fake it
If I keep on workin' it
A billion hits is what I'll get

Whoa, oh, oh, oh-oh
That's what I'm gonna get
Whoa, oh, oh, oh-oh
That's what I'm gonna get
Yeah, 'cause I know that I'll make it
Overload the internet
