I know it's on when I can't stop myself from watchin' you
Mo-o-o-ove (Mo-o-o-ove)
It's automatic, gotta have it 'cause you got that
Boom-da-boom-boom (Boom-da-boom-boom)

When the lights come up, it's hard to hold back
So come on, let it blow

Can you feel it coming down, down, down?
Can you feel it coming down, down, down?
Move it faster, stronger, harder
Move it faster, stronger, harder

Can you feel it? Turn it up, up, up
Can you feel it? Turn it up, up, up
Can you feel it? Turn it up, up, up
Can you feel it, feel it, feel it?

When the lights come up, it's hard to hold back
So come on, let it blow

Can you feel it coming down, down, down?
Can you feel it coming down, down, down?
Move it faster, stronger, harder
Move it faster, stronger, harder

Can you feel it? Turn it up, up, up

Put your hands up and get it rockin'
Hey, hey
Show the whole world we're never stoppin'
Hey, hey
Put your hands up, we're lightin' up the sky
Tonight, tonight
When the lights come up, it's hard to hold back
So come on, let it blow
