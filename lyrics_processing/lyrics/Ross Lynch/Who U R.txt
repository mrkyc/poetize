Hey girl, I really wanna let you know
Your style, it's something that's so natural
You laugh and everyone around you stops
Your smile, I wish you knew just what you got
And don't be scared to show me something real
We'll never know holding back what we feel
I'm into you, so tell me you feel the same
And that's all it takes 'cause

Oh, girl you could be mine
(Girl you could be mine)
Once in a lifetime
(Once in a lifetime)
So open your heart
(Open up your heart)

Show me who you are
Show me who you are
Show me who you are
So open up your heart
And show me who you are

Hey girl, wish that I could let it go
But right now, it's time to let your true self show
And I'm sure if you just let down your hair
You won't have a reason to be scared
So take my hand, it's not that hard
You can have more fun if you let down your guard
I'm into you, so tell me you feel the same
And that's all it takes 'cause

Show me who you are
I want you to show me who you are
So open your heart
(And show me who you are)

I've gotta let you know
Ooo girl, you're just so natural
And I know that we could be something
If you show me who you are
Yeah I wanna see it, hey!
Oh, you could be mine
