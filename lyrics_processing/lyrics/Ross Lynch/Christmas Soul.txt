Uh-huh!
Wooo!
I always love this time of year
White snow and reindeer
Heh, yeah
There's something special in the air
Friends and family everywhere
Ooooh
When everybody's singing
My heart starts jing-a-lingin'
There's something 'bout those December nights
Today's the day
Let's celebrate
With that Christmas soul
Feel that Christmas soul
We got that reindeer
Kinda cheer
Santa's flying over here
All the way from the North Pole!
'Cause we got Christmas soul
Yeah, we got Christmas Soul
Uh, yeah!
