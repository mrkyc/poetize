I can get your heartbeat beat-beat-beatin' like
I can get your heartbeat beatin' like that
You know you got my heartbeat-beat-beat-beatin' like
Hey-ay ay-ay-ay
I can get your heart beat-beat-beat-beatin' like
I can get your heart beat-beatin' like that
You know you got my heartbeat beat-beat-beatin' like
Hey-ay ay-ay-ay

Would you, would you want it if I stood up above this crowd?
Got up on a chair and if I shouted your name aloud
Could you, could you take me, call me baby without a doubt?
I'm shouting your name right now, shouting your name right now
Don't you get it, get it? I'm nothin' like them other ones
It's placed upon the notion, I ain't hosting no re-runs
I said it, said it, said it, wouldn't let it be all or none
'Cause I ain't no rerun, I ain't no rerun

I'll make you forget (Forget)
What you came here for (Here for)
For goodness sake, let's make or break this heart
'Cause it needs more
You might also like

Hey-ay ay-ay-ay
I can get your heartbeat beat-beat-beatin' like
I can get your heart beat beatin' like that
You know you got my heart beat beat-beat-beatin' like
Hey-ay ay-ay-ay

Would you, wa-want it if I opened your gate at night?
Took you by the hand and made your heart beat at the speed of light
Could you, could you take it if I treated you just right?
Your heart at the speed of light
My heart at the speed of light
Jugglin' the consequences, losing your blue sway
Might as well go there, 'cause we're already halfway
We're only young once so grow up with me, babe
We're already halfway, already halfway

I'll make you forget (Forget)
What you came here for (Here for)
For goodness sake, let's make or break this heart
'Cause it needs more

You know you're feeling like you're s'posed to
I know you know you wanna see how fast it can go
So I'ma take you to the top
And bring you down slow, oh
