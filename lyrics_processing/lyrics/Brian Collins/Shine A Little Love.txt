Everybody has a bad day
Been out in the rain
But you're not alone
I can see you're needing a friend
To lend you a hand from out of the cold
And it won't hurt like this forever
It's all gonna work out fine

And we're all in this together
Blue skies or stormy weather
Come on, shine a little love for me
Let your light surround it
And don't just talk about it
Come on, shine a little love for me
And if that's something you can do
I'm gonna shine a little love for you

If you have a smile you can give
It won't hurt a bit to give it away
And when you have a shoulder to spare
For someone out there, it can brighten their day
We all need each other, every now and then
You might also like
And we're all in this together
Blue skies or stormy weather
Come on, shine a little love for me
Let your light surround it
And don't just talk about it
Come on, shine a little love for me
And if that's something you can do
I'm gonna shine a little love for you

Oh when life's weighing you down and you can't find your way out
Just remember that someone cares, yeah, baby, I've been there

We're all in this together
Blue skies or stormy weather
Come on, shine a little love for me
Let your light surround it
And don't just talk about it
Come on, shine a little love for me
And we're all in this together
Blue skies or stormy weather
Come on, shine a little love for me
Let your light surround it
And don't just talk about it
Come on, shine a little love for me
And if that's something you can do
Well, I'm gonna shine a little love for you too
Gonna shine, shine a little love for you
Mmmm, gonna let it shine
Uh come on, uh come on
Gonna let it shine mmmm
