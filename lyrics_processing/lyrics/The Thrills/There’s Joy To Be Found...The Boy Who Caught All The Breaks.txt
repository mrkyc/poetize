I know things might seem hopeless now. yes I know things might seem hopeless now
But there's joy to be found in this life
I know there's joy to be found
But if you find it hold on tight
Will you miss those stuck-up bores like a driver you'll be opening your own doors
I know things might seem hopeless now
Yes I know things might seem hopeless now
But there's joy to be found in this life
I know there's joy to be found
But if you find it hold on tight
Ahhhh ahhhh-ahhh
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
But there's joy to be found in this life
I know there's joy to be found
But if you find it hold on tight
Oh I hope that I'm right
I hope that I'm right
Yes I hope that I'm right
Ooooh-ooooh-oooooooh!
The boy would never grow up, la la la la la la....
I don't think about you that much
But I don't think about anybody else
I just know I gotta get out of this rut very soon
These streets don't inspire me the way it used to do
I don't know why I try
The boy always caught the breaks
No I don't know why I try
The boy caught all the breaks
The boy would never grow up, la la la la la....
Some friends peeking their teeth
And some friends take their time waiting for their moment to shine
You showed your face at the school reunion
Your paperback under your arm
You said it couldn't do no harm
I don't know why I try
The boy always caught the breaks
I dont know why I try
The boy caught all the breaks!
You say you don't believe in love
Cause you've always made your own
Because you've always made your own
Because you've always made your own

He just simply said it was never for me
