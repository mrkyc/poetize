Seger was singing words I could believe in
Mainstreet was my street that night
So I called up Samantha and asked her the chance
Of us running out 'neath the moonlight
Well, she's not with me now, she can always be found
When I rewind the radio dial
And like it was then I feel her on my skin
And I'm back there for a while

So I labor for hours 'cause I know the power
Of a song when a song hits you right
Pourin' my soul into stories of life
Hopin' someone will hear one tonight
And maybe my voice will cut through the noise
And stir up an old memory
And out of these piano keys comes the sound
The sound of a million dreams

My eighteenth summer, I was a cocky up-and-comer
Cranking up Born to Run
Turned left out the drive with the pistons open wide
And I came back a prodigal son
My spirit was broken, she threw the door open
I love you not I told you so
When I hear Mama Tried, I still break down and cry
And pull to the side of the road
You might also like
And I labor for hours 'cause I know the power
Of a song when a song hits you right
Pouring my soul into stories of life
Hoping someone will hear one tonight
And maybe my voice will cut through the noise
And stir up an old memory
And out of these piano keys comes a sound
The sound of a million dreams
So I labor for hours 'cause I know the power
Of a song when a song hits you right
Pouring my soul into stories of life
Hoping someone will hear one tonight
Maybe my voice will cut through the noise
And stir up an old memory
And out of these piano keys comes a sound
The sound of a million dreams
