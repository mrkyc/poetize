The your hell is an empty bed
But it's never hard to keep it full
There ain't too many arms you have to pull
'Cause you think that you're getting love
But they know they're just getting some
And deep inside you know it's true
But you don't date believe it, do you?
Do you?
You just lay it down like a quarter on the railroad track
If it sticks to the wheel you're never gonna get it back
It won't do you no good to change your mind
'Cause it already feel off somewhere down the line
Now all the boys call you when they're looking for a good time
Looking for a good time
These days they call it casual
Well, that just means they'll leave when they get full
Yeah, they say you're cool 'cause you don't care
But in the morning you always cry if they're not there
And you think if they could only see you now
But I swear they'd do it anyhow
'Cause they'll say anything to play the part
But they don't give a damn about your heart
Your heart

If it sticks to the wheel you're never gonna get it back
It won't do you no good to change your mind
'Cause it already feel off somewhere down the line
Now all the boys call you when they're looking for a good time
Looking for a good time
You say you never tell the boys how bad you need it
But every scream is your prayer
You say, "I love you" and you swear you didn't mean it
'Cause you both agree this would go nowhere
Someday I hope that you get tired
Of waking up with the thieves and liars
Maybe you'll go searching for the truth
The kind that ain't written on a phone booth, no, no
You just lay it down like a quarter on the railroad track
If it sticks to the wheel you're never gonna get it back
It won't do you no good to change your mind
'Cause it already feel off somewhere down the line
Now all the boys call you when they're looking for a good time
