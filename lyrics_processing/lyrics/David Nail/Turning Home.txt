Usually take one last pass through town
Stop the car and touch the ground
Watch those streetlights swayin' in the breeze
Decorated store fronts
Rusty old gas pumps
Try to fill my mind up
With somethin' before I go
Picture postcard memories
You know they always make for good company

I don't know no town like the old town
Even when the miles are many, I feel like I'm still around
Deep inside me like rings through an oak tree
Yeah, there somethin' 'bout a Sunday when I'm gone
That keeps me turnin' home

I'm standin' here beneath these billboard lights
Takes me back to those autumn nights
Hometown bleachers packed real tight
As we marched down the field
My feet would swing from a dropped tailgate
Out on Airport Road real late
No one could walk a line too straight
We usually made it home alright
And glory days I can't re-live
Stories I'll never forget
You might also like
And I don't know no friends like the old friends
I never seem to laugh now like I did with them
But deep inside me a piece of history
Yeah, I hear their voices even though they're gone
And it keeps me turnin' home

Never twice the same way does it start
And sure enough she stole my heart
On the old gym floor, spinnin' round and round one night
And though we both tried hard to wait
We sure did love the taste
Of the sweet love being made and prayin' I got it right
Graduation came and went
Along with all the time we spent

And I don't know no love like the first love
When I think about the best times she's the one I think of
Deep inside me all though the taste is bittersweet
I see her smilin' even though she's gone
