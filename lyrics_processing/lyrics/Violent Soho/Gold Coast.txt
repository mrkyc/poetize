When you're cracking, like plastic
And you're drowning, so cable tied and worn
Cause it's visions on visions
Like hollow, hungry wolves
Pay taxes to a leader
So shaken to the bone
'Cause it's liars pushing liars
Throwing feeling out the door

Where did you go now?
Where did you go right through the wall?
Where did you go now?
Where did you go? I'm on my own

When you're able, so civil
Screaming angels just scratching at your door
'Cause it's layers on layers
They'll drop on you like stones
Be quiet and drive
I just want to hear the song
Feels mild, so awake
I'll put my toes back on
'Cause it's visions on visions
Like hollow, hungry wolves
'Cause it's liars pushing liars
Throwing feeling out the door
