With a little bit of action
They don't build the world this way
It's alright
She lied
With the face of Cleopatra
The world ain't built this way
It's alright

Now
I'm gonna go outside
Nothing's gonna save us
Nothing's gonna save us
My only dope calypso
My only dope calypso
My only dope calypso
That's alright

They keep death staring me down
I'm alright
Safe
So safe, they never asked us
The world ain't built this way
It's alright
