Mama was a bit naive
And her Daddy was a blinded thief
He went and stole away what was left
Of the remains of a family
She'd hide away behind a door
She kept locked
But the walls weren't thick enough to
Block out angry noises of the voices
That once soothed her to sleep

And she lies, tonight
Underneath a caving roof
And she cries, tonight
Wondering what she can do
And she tries, tonight
Remembering who she once knew
But they've died, inside
Another empty bottle takes a life

This world can be so cruel
She lives her life as a broken tool
And she believes she's unable to fix
This broken machine, and what's the use
To throw yourself at love
If in the end it never seems enough
To be able to get through all of life's broken dreams
She watched her father live in regret
Heard her mother cry in an empty bed
And she swears
This is the best life gets
You might also like
And she lies, tonight
Underneath a caving roof
And she cries, tonight
Wondering what she could do
And she tries, tonight
But she's out of memories
That she once knew
And she dies, inside
Another empty bottle takes a life

And every little bit, every little bit
Of her wants to see that light
But every single night
Another little bit of her dies inside
She's trapped in her mind
She feels more alive
She feels more alive
In her own dreams
And she's wondering
What's beyond the sky
Could she see the light
If she falls asleep
Cause she feels more alive
In her own dreams
So tonight, she lies
Lifted up through her own roof
Dried eyes, tonight
There's nothing more
That she could do
And they cry, tonight
A daughter that they hardly knew
And she's lost, in time
