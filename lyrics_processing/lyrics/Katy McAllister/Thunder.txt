It comes to rain outside and
Back then I never liked it
When it rained, it poured
I sit up and watch the lightning
You're here with me tonight and
I've never been so frightened
Of something more
I am looking out the window
The fog takes over light and
For once the curtains aren't closed
And I have decided
I'm in this situation
And I just can't dismiss you
Cause you're what I've been missing
And I just can't resist you
I like the thunder
Cause when you pull me under
I'm not afraid anymore
These walls begin to shake
This storm's inside me now
You might also likeI'm down, your lightning caught me
I'm bound to end up weak
This fire burns in your gaze
And I forget to breathe
Outside there's a haze
But this room's the death of me
This building could be up in flames
And we could both go under
And I would never know
Somedays, I like the thunder
Feels like we're in a time lapse
But here inside I'm frozen
I guess the evening has passed
But I'm too caught up to notice
I'm forgetful in your presence
Cause to me, you're like the essence
Of a dream, no longer hesitant
To let my walls come down
With the rain that's on my windowsill
Is just like music
A symphony of motion
And I'm about to lose it
I'm captured by this light
Harmonizing with the darkness
And there's no fear tonight
Sometimes I guess I like this
I like the thunder
Cause when you pull me under
I'm not afraid anymore
These walls begin to shake
This storm's inside me now
I'm down, your lightning caught me
I'm bound to end up weak
This fire burns in your gaze
And I forget to breathe
Outside there's a haze
But this room's the death of me
This building could be up in flames
And we could both go under
And I would never know
Somedays, I like the thunder
I'm lost from the world
It's coming down on me
But we lie curled
And we fit perfectly
So this whole world
Can take it all from me
But they have got nothing
