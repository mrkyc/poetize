See a flicker in the lighting
Coming from behind an open door
See a silhouette lining
I can't help but move indoors
Such a dangerous display
I'm closing in on a dark black alley
Throw myself into the flames I'm burning
I'm yelling come and get me
So I guess its my fault put me on the stand
I said that I was suffering and grab you by the hand
You were there in front of me telling me to stand down
But I couldn't let go now
Just a glance and you tell me
There in a heartbeat I was in the dark and you found me
Crawlin at your feet I couldn't get out you see you got me
You got me hostage hostage
Theres no need for holding holding
No you got me hostage hostage
You know I wanted you to hold me
I spent so much time pretending pointing fingers at you
In denial its so easy blame the pain on someone who knew
You knew just how to save me but you didn't now did you now
Instead you took my by the heartstrings and I bet you'd tear it out

You got me hostage hostage
Theres no need for holding holding
No you got me hostage hostage
You know I wanted you to hold me
And if you hold me down I'm not a fighter
But if you could let me down slow
I don't plan on fighting this flame with fire
I just need you to let me go
And if you hold me down I'm not a fighter
But if you could let me down slow
I don't plan on fighting this flame with fire
I just need you to let me go
Oh there in a heartbeat
I was in the dark and you found me
Crawlin at your feet I couldn't get out you see
You got me and you took me there in a heartbeat
I was in the dark and you found me
Crawlin at your feet I couldn't get out you see you got me
You got me hostage hostage
Theres no need for holding holding
No you got me hostage hostage
You know I wanted you to hold me
Hold me
