Looking out over the city
All the streets, they look so busy
Out of millions I'm here thinking about you
Maybe it's the lights making me
Feel this way tonight
Or just the fact you used to look at this same view

But oh, oh, oh
Nothing's changed
After all, you're still the same
But oh, oh, oh
If I changed
Was less familiar would you stay?

If I was less of a fool
If I hadn't admitted myself to you
And if you never knew
How crazy and frustrating I am
Hard to be around somedays
If I had only known I'd fall for you
I'd fall for you

Watching all the ones I envy
How they turn and run so pretty
Still I can't give you the chase you've given me
Now it's all out on the table
You can run willing and able
But you know this secret that I keep
And you don't leave
But I'd rather watch you struggle
Than watch you pretend you're humble
You know how hard it is for me
To hear you call me friend
You might also like
But oh, oh, oh
Nothing's changed
After all, you're still the same
But oh, oh, oh
If I changed
Was less familiar would you stay?

If I was less of a fool
If I hadn't admitted myself to you
And if you never knew
How crazy and frustrating I am
Hard to be around somedays
If I had only known I'd fall for you
I'd fall for you

You're like a flower to me
And when you're here blossoming
I take what I can get
Cause you'll soon fall away
And I see the leaves are changing
I'll never be like home to you
But I'll still watch you go as you fade
And I will pray
That someday
I'll be less of a fool
Next time around
I won't reveal so much of this to you
Tell me now
If you never knew me in this way
And how crazy and frustrating I am
Hard to be around you these days
I wish I had known I'd fall for you
Cause if I'd only known I'd fall for you
I'd be less of a fool
If I had only known I'd fall for you
