Talk so sweet, like you're gonna be around
You're just another sweet, cruel memory
How do you reel me in
Like I'm gonna fall for it, but then I do
How do you do that to me
Time flies by, and I never hear a word from you
And all I, I can think is
It was mean, the time you never gave me
And it was sad, the spine that I never had
Ended fast, but the words still resonate so deep
Deep like a knife left in me since that first night
And I, I could feel you twisting all the words
They burn me alive
So deep, so deep
Deep like when you feel like breaking
But you're already on the floor
Your mind is a fast car racing you to history's door
Just to leave you wanting more
You move in so deep, so still
Slow kill
You might also likeHow do you do that to me
Sink in slow, like a knife you left behind
But you'll be back to twist it
How do you break me like that
Cliche story with the same old ending
I didn't mean a thing at all in the end
How do you do that to me
Use your words, every single one that kills me
And you let it burn, then you're gone
You're laughing at me like I'm less than you
But I did it to myself cause I saw the best in you
For a moment
It was sweet
The time you gave me
But it was sad
The spine that I never had
Ended fast, but the words still resonate
So deep, so deep
Deep like a knife left in me since that first night
And I, I could feel you twisting all the words
They burn me alive
So deep, so deep
Deep like when you feel like breaking
But you're already on the floor
Your mind is a fast car racing you to history's door
Just to leave you wanting more
You move in so deep, so still
Slow kill
I can't shake this sickness
It's in my stomach
But you never even wanted this
So why did you go in for it
The kiss that left me breathless
When you never even wanted this
Deep like a knife left in me since that first night
And I, I could feel you twisting all the words
They burn me alive
So deep, so deep
Deep like when you feel like breaking
But you're already on the floor
Your mind is a fast car racing you to history's door
Just to leave you wanting more
You move in so deep, so still
