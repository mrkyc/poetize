Have we just started living today
Cause I almost feel that way
We get so behind at times, so behind
I think I stopped for a minute or two
But I stopped looking when I met you
And we get too high, but I'm high on tonight

So let's go out
To the beach, or the city, or even just
Outside to think, or be, or just breathe it
Inside of your head, wanna know it all
Kissing you now seems like an unsafe call
But baby there's really no safe way
No baby, there's really no safe way to fall
Baby there's no safe way
Baby, there's really no safe way to fall

Have you seen the view from the sky
Your city's looking like heaven tonight
I forget to take things in, but I won't miss this
And I was running straight for the hills
But now I wanna roll down them like children
With you, time seems useless
You might also like
Let's go out
To the beach, or the city, or even just
Outside to think, or be, or just breathe it
Inside of your head, wanna know it all
Kissing you now seems like an unsafe call
But baby there's really no safe way
No baby, there's really no safe way to fall
Baby there's no safe way
Baby, there's really no safe way to fall

You'll come to find I'm a little bit scared to say
How often you've really been on my brain
And I was running straight for the hills
But now I wanna roll down them like children with you

Let's go out
To the beach, or the city, or even just
Outside to think, or be, or just breathe it
Inside of your head, wanna know it all
Kissing you now seems like an unsafe call
But baby there's really no safe way
No baby, there's really no safe way to fall
Baby there's no safe way
