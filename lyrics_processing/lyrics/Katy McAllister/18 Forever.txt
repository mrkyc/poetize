You were just here laughing on my shoulder
Tackling me over
We stayed in as the nights grew colder
You were just here with me in this closet
The one I sit here locked in
Tried on every dress with you there watching

And there on the floor we stared at cheap neon stars
And look there's the door I'd open up to your arms

Now I'm in this car
I drive past that spot we parked in
Where I cried our first time fighting
We made up there on that mountain
Now this place looks dark
That abandoned football stadium
Once lit up with friends tailgating
We hid out right there till morning
I was in your arms
And you told me don't be scared of nothin'
Well you know back then I wasn't
Not until this real life sunk in
And told us we couldn't be together
Well I guess you can't be 18 forever
You might also like
We were just there talking bout the future
Sitting in that backyard
Passed a guitar around the fire
We were just about to toast to
The summer, play some Brand New
In the suburbs - Not much to do
But find a little bit of home in each other

But every box of wine has to run out
And all the stores are closed all over this town

Now I'm in this car
I drive past that house we lived in
Every night that's where we ended
If the suns down we're not sleeping
Now the street looks dark
Once lit up felt young love blossom
If I held out what would happen
Would we still be looking back when
When you stole my heart
And you told me don't be scared of nothin
Well you know back then I wasn't
Not until this real life sunk in
And told us we couldn't be together
Well I guess you can't be 18 forever
Toast to the good times
Black out the bad nights
Held onto close ties, some lost touch
Saw faces fly by
Heard rumors spread like
Wildfire, felt the hurt and the rush of love (the rush of love)

Now I'm in this car
I drive past that spot we parked in
Where I cried our first time fighting
We made up there on that mountain
Now this place looks dark
That abandoned football stadium
Once lit up with friends tailgating
We hid out right there till morning
And I was in your arms
And you told me don't be scared of nothin'
Well you know back then I wasn't
Not until this real life sunk in
And told us we couldn't be together
