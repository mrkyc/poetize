But you're so far away
I bet that if I could feel you near me
You are the wind and I can feel you breathing
But you're so far away
I bet that if I could feel you near me
You'd see that I'm afraid
So I keep my distance and I keep on walking
Keeping my path clear
You're with your friends and you were all just laughing
I wonder if you see me here
But Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh
I'll never have the guts anyway
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh
I find it hard to say that
You've got this way about you
My sights are on you
No matter what I do
I can't escape
These things that I need
Your arms around me
I know what you must think
I could be brave
You might also likeAnd walk right up to
The fear I've come to
Know and run away from
Can I just say
That I'd love to see your face
Notice mine someday
I see that all the other girls that pass by
They lay there eyes on you
It's so intriguing that you won't even try
Only if they knew
And I can tell you're nothing other guys
But you don't have a clue
Exactly just how beautiful your blue eyes
Are, I fix mine back and realize
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh
I didn't mean to take a double look
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh
I used to be so subtle
You've got this way about you
My sights are on you
No matter what I do
I can't escape
These things that I need
Your arms around me
I know what you must think
I could be brave
And walk right up to
The fear I've come to
Know and run away from
Can I just say
That I'd love to see your face
Oh dear courage, come and rescue me from these
Minor complications, these pretty observations
Oh what's love if it's just a daydream
Help me make it reality
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh
I make my way across the room
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh
And I can't help but notice you
That Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh
I didn't mean to take a double look
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh
I used to be so subtle
You've got this way about you
My sights are on you
No matter what I do
I can't escape
These things that I need
Your arms around me
I know what you must think
I could be brave
And walk right up to
The fear I've come to
Know and run away from
Can I just say
That I'd love to see your face
