Watched me dress, I'm complaining
You say 'baby, you are crazy, you look amazing'

At 17 the world still seems
Like it's so small
For knowing nothing
I sure thought I knew it all
No one really knows
Exactly what forever means
And it's law, no one sees what's real
Until it's gone
But I found forever
Out on the basketball court
And I thought never, I'd look outside and not
See you waiting on my driveway anymore

Never late, always waiting
Watched me dress, I'm complaining
You say 'baby, you are crazy, you look amazing'
And I remember
You picked me up from work
You helped me pack
We laid on the floor
I never saw you coming
Funny how time flies
9 months felt like a whole lifetime
And it feels like a lifetime ago
But you're still Phil and I'm still Katy
And you still saved me
You might also like
You're like winter, I'm like summer
You're collected while I'm
Completely off the wall
You're a walker, I'm a runner
And it's perfect, you're the one
For which I'd risk the fall
I've never stared so intently
Without anything to say
Yeah we always had those moments
And looking back now
It sounds so cliche
But this was supposed to be forever Have we lost it?

Never late, always waiting
Watched me dress, I'm complaining
You say 'baby, you are crazy
You look amazing'
And I remember having dinner
Never quite won over your mother
But I never doubted you
And it was just young love
That's what they all say
But you are my one love
That never went away
You're still Phil and I'm still Katy
And you still saved me
And it's just an old T-shirt
But when I put it on
I feel wrapped up in you
And I've been loved
And I have been hurt
But at the daybreak no one gets to me
No one gets me like you do
I remember it was prom night
We would've stayed till we saw sunlight
But once again we got the spotlight
Making wishes
I still think about it all the time
Yeah this was supposed to be a lifetime

Never late, always waiting
Watched me dress, I'm complaining
You say 'baby, you are crazy
You look amazing'
And I remember our first big fight
Ended up being or first time
In the summer all those
Late night drives
And it was just young love
That's what they all say
But you are my one love
That never went away
Yeah you're still Phil and I'm still Katy
You're still you and I'm still me
