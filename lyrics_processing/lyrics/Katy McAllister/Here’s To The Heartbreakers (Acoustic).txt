When did it ever begin?
Don't pretend like he was ever interested
He may have had you fooled by
The way he looked into your eyes
But no he really looked right through, through it all
He could swear he never meant it
Act like you're overreacting
But he's the tool who shouldn't have been acting
How are they the ones attracting us?
Chorus 1
Here's to the heartbreakers
Who are so good at hiding all the evidence of them pretending
All along who were we kidding?
I could find a man and not a boy
Yeah you'll see what you're missing
Yes I'm fine now, thanks for asking
Here's to the fakers
Here's to the heartbreakers!
Verse 2
You try to play his games but
Then you're the one who's being confusing
He'll keep using that old line
You could just tell me you don't have the time
But no, you wanna leave me hanging
What's the point in all of my waiting?
I'm the one who's noticing you
Guess that makes me obsessed with you
I turn your flaws into beauty
And you're seeing this as a bad thing
Are you kidding me?
Yeah well, you're the one who'll be missing me

So here is to the heartbreakers
Who are so good at keeping us around
While still keeping our confidence down
Do you feel as if you own me?
I could find a man and not a boy
Yeah you'll see what you're missing
Yes I'm fine now, thanks for asking
Here's to the takers
Here's to the heartbreakers!
Bridge
This is the story of a girl who builds her own thoughts
She has the faith that he'll be more than what she only thinks she wants
She's seen the bitter truth
But when someone is looking right at you
It's hard to see through the lying eyes
When you're mesmerized
Yeah I'm mesmerized
So here's to you, the heartbreaker
Who was so good at hiding all the evidence of
Your pretending
All along who was I kidding?
And now for you, the heartbreaker
Who was so good at keeping me around
While still keeping my confidence down
Well you'll never own me
You'll never even have me... Yeah
Cause I could find a man and not a boy
Yes you'll soon see what you're missing
Did you get what you came for?
Yeah, you're a heartbreaker
Let me give you a little more! :)
