There's candle light surrounding you
And I don't know where you've been all my life
This feels so wrong that it feels right
And I close my eyes, shut them tight
Throw myself at you but you don't make a move
It's like I don't have anything to prove
And you to me are flawless
From the outside all the way to the inbetween
The truth is I'm left lingering on this
And I'm breaking, yeah, I'm breaking at the seams
I'm not subtle like I used to be
And all this talk about stars, they say they all die
But when I'm blinded by the ones in your eyes
I feel so alive
And I don't know what's in the cards and I didn't know a thing
'Til you looked my way, there's no winning at this game
So we squared off and started the fight
But it turns out the rules don't apply
I lose everytime, everytime
'Cause you to me are flawless
From the outside all the way to the inbetween
The truth is I'm left lingering on this
And I'm breaking, yeah, I'm breaking at the seams
You might also likeThe others fell 'cause there's no seatbelt
But I'll hold tight for my life
'Cause I like this ride, yeah, I like this ride
You like the ride that's always dropped my stomach
And that's something from my usually go wrong
But one glance said to me aim for good
And you lose me like nobody could
The universe is setting the mood
And it feels like it's candle light surrounding us
So lean on in for the kill, you're blowing my mind
And it's kind of like I'm dressing up to die
And you to me are flawless
And you to me are flawless
From the outside all the way to the inbetween
The truth is I'm left lingering on this
And I'm breaking, do you see me breaking at the seams?
