I'm just too stubborn to admit that's true
She had you hooked like I never knew
Exactly just how to do
I sugarcoated every dream of you
That you're unable to make come true
And I'll let faith decide this time around
It appears though I'm still here now
This doesn't mean I don't love everything about you
Sometimes that's not enough
It doesn't mean I couldn't stick it out a few more years
It just means I'm not tough
Whether you like it or not
I'll be around most likely
For years to come if you need anything
But I'll never be your lover
No, I'm not cut out for that job obviously
I'm not enough and I won't be
Ever if not now
Your temporary lover you let down
So don't fall back on me now
Cause I'm not cut out
You might also likeI've been in trouble since the start of the first round
And I've dug a hole I can't get myself out
Been miserable off and on for a while
Just give it two more months, wait it out
I told myself that you came back because you love me
But it turns out that I found out, it's cause you're alone again
You never hesitated once to leave me standing
In corners watching you choose her over me again
I'll be around most likely
For years to come if you need anything
But I'll never be your lover
No, I'm not cut out for that job obviously
I'm not enough and I won't be
Ever if not now
Your temporary lover you let down
So don't fall back on me now
Cause I'm not cut out for this
It's not worth it from my end
I've been over it too many times, too many lines
I've never seen you so clearly
You're so clear to me
Sometimes I think I know you better than you know yourself
I'll call your every move, before you move it
The only problem is that I have too much faith in you
I see the best in you, but you won't prove it
It's obvious that it's real love, because you disgust me
And I put up with you willingly when nobody else will
And I could stick it out a few more years
But who's to say you would actually stay
And I'll be around most likely
For years to come if you need anything
But I'll never be your lover
No, I'm not cut out for that job obviously
I'm not enough and I won't be
Ever if not now
Your temporary lover you let down
So don't fall back on me now
