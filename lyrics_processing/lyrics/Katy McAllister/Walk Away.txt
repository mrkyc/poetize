I only brought him trouble since the day he met me
If i was him, by now, i would've left me
I woulda walked away
But now i broken the way
But still somehow he forgive me
He said a man gotta do what he got to
Even if it means him denying himself the truth
Cause when you in too deep you wake up it's too late
Fallin in love in the worst way
And if you don't go now, then you stay
Cause I'll never let you leave
Never let you breath
Cause if you looking for heaven baby your sure as hell ain't me
Yeh yeh
So walk away
So if you walk, then I suggest you walk
Why are we up this hour knockin pictures off the wall?
Tell me what does that resolve
I guess its my fault
The truth is never easy when you gotta get it off
And girl I'm so exhausted
Yes, all this makes me nauseous
This is just the way I that am, you cannot alter it
I'm sorry that I couldn't be your fantasy
If this ain't what you want then you should leave
But still he stays (walk away, walk awayyy)
But still he stays
Hes standing in the heart of darkness
Saying I know you got a soul even though your heartless
How could any man in his right mind
Be so blind, to finding something to say
Instead of walking to me he shoulda (walked away)
He finds color in the darkest places
He finds beauty in the saddest of faces
He's such a groovy, head strong city boy
Coulda had the world
But ya falling in love in the worst way
And if you don't go now, then you stay
Cause I'll never let you leave
Never let you breath
Cause if you looking for heaven baby your sure as hell ain't me
As I fall, (walk away) a thousand miles an hour
Downward, now that you're gone
I guess its true, words have power
I guess what I said left a taste so sour
In your mouth ya wanted me to see what life's like withoutcha
So I lay awake, watchin' DVDs
Season 1, season 2, even season 3
I'm sorry that I couldn't be inside your fantasy
But if this ain't what you want then you should leave
Still he stays (walk away, walk awayyy)
Still he stays (walk away, walk awayyy)
I don't know why hes with me
I only brought him trouble since the day he met me
If i was him, by now, I would've left me
I woulda walked away
But now i broken the way
But still somehow he forgive me
He said a man gotta do what he got to
Even if it means him denying himself the truth
Cause when you in too deep you wake up it's too late
Fallin in love in the worst way
And if you don't go now, then you stay
Cause I'll never let you leave
Never let you breath
Cause if you looking for heaven baby your sure as hell ain't me
So walk away
So if you walk, then I suggest you walk (walk away)
So if you walk, then I suggest you walk (walk away)
(and still he stays)
And girl I'm so exhausted
Yes all this makes me nauseous
This is just the way that I am, you cannot alter it
I'm sorry that I couldn't be your fantasy
