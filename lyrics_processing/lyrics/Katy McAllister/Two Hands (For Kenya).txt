Suffocated by the struggle of a day to day battle
And I can't say that I know what that's like at all
There are people prayin'
It's been a long day and the moon is in the sky
Somebody's layin' down their head to cry, to cry

And I've got two hands placed together
Lyin' in bed but I am torn
'Cause these two hands are good for prayin'
But they were made for so much more

And I don't know what pain is
Or what a bad day is
To someone without food tonight
And someone's lost their will to fight
And I can sit with my heart breakin'
Thinkin' 'bout the shame in
The thought of this world being treated less than beautiful
But we've got a heart for something
And love is more than anything
Two hands can make a difference
But a heart can change the world
Yes a heart can change the world
You might also like
Caught up in a lifestyle where selfless is a task
For some a simple smile is even much to ask
The news may be depressing but look outside your shell
'Cause the world can be inspiring
Once you believe that you can help

And it's so hard to believe in something you can't see
But who told you you're crazy?
Who said it's out of your reach?

And I don't know what pain is
Or what a bad day is
To someone without food tonight
And someone's lost their will to fight
And I can sit with my heart breakin'
Thinkin' 'bout the shame in
The thought of this world being treated less than beautiful
But we've got a heart for something
And love is more than anything
Two hands can make a difference
But a heart can change the world
Spread like a fire we can set this heart with one flame
But we can make a change, we can make a change
Look around we all share this place
It's one love, it's one human race
Happiness it's all around
We can reach it, it's just a matter of how
Look around we all share this place
It's one love, it's once human race
Happiness it lingers all around
Selflessness help them reach it now

And I don't know what pain is
Or what a bad day is
To someone without family tonight
And someone's lost their will to fight
And I can sit with my heart breakin'
Thinkin' 'bout the shame in
The thought of this world being treated less than beautiful
But you've got a heart for somethin'
And love is more than anything
Two hands can make a difference
But a heart can change the world
Spread like a fire we can set these hearts with one flame
We can make a change
