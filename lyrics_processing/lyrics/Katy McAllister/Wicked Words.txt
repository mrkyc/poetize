Unlike the girls with the short bangs
Who leave me in this corner like I'm deaf
Brown skin sharp eyes your wit seems hidden in this house
You play a game and I'm like bambi waitin staring your gun down
What goes on below my brains unseen
Can't control my second personality
I can hide it long enough till you
Throw an insult and you close in like you do
But it's brutal how you hurt me so good
Like icing on a cake I know I should leave it alone
But I just want to know the way
You entice me just enough to make me stay
You look annoying with that smirk
Upon your face I'd gladly slap
On a smile and just take it like a bat
I'm home but your already on your well passed the grass
What goes on below my brains unseen
Can't control my second personality
I can hide it long enough till you
Throw an insult and you close in like you do
But it's brutal how you hurt me so good
Like icing on a cake I know I should leave it alone
But I just want to know the way
You entice me just enough to make me stay
To me you grabbed the short end of the stick
The way you talked to me your just thinking with your judgemental mind
I could be yours and you could be mine
I'm not the one to act as your good time
But your dedication shows me I've been on your mind, been your mind
What goes below your brains unseen
Can't control your personality
You can hide it long enough to
Throw an insult you should know I'm on to you
But it's brutal how you hurt me so good
Like icing on a cake I know I should leave it alone
But I just want to know the way
You entice me just enough to make me stay
It's so brutal how you hurt me so good
I know I should leave it alone
But I just want to know the way
