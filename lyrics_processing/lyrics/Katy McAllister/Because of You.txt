Before you it's been awhile before I slipped up
Before you I never thought to give up
Before you I was satisfied on my own
Before you I never let myself go
Before this I was always on the wrong side
Before this I was always bad at
Hanging onto pride
But before this I was professional
About how to hide
What was goin on on the inside
And before you I was so content
Yeah before you I was unaware of it
I was unaware, of my loneliness

Now because of you
I remember why I have no self respect
Because of you
I remember why I always felt hopeless
I remember why
My perception of love was demented
I remember why I'm such a mess
Why I'm such a mess
Because of you
I remember why I was satisfied with lust
Because of you
I remember why I will never truly trust
Before you there were more yous and I know now why I will never expect much
Thought I forgot, but thanks a lot
Cause now because of you
I remember why I don't love
I remember why I don't love
You might also like
Before you I had control of this
Before you I never let my heart win
Before you I was on my way to freedom
Before you I never let myself give in
To the disappointment of unrequited love
To the mislead illusion of mutual trust
I was unaware, of how bad love was


When somebody walks away
And you feel replaced
Left with your own embrace
A part of you gives up hope
Once you let it go
You never wanna go, back again
I look at you and I see him
All over again

And because of him
I lost all my self respect
Because of him
I was always left hopeless
Because of him
My perception of love is demented
I remember why I'm such a mess
Why I'm such a mess
And because of you
I remember why I'm satisfied with lust
Because of you
I remember why I will never truly trust
Before you there were more yous and
I know now why I will never expect much
I thought I forgot, but thanks a lot
Cause now because of you
I remember why I don't love
