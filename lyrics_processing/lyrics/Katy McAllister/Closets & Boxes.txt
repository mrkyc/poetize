The first night I crossed that line
And finally saw your room
Look there's the shirt I borrowed from you
The first night I crossed that line
And finally saw your room
Look there's the dress I wore on my birthday
The first night you took me out on a real date
Take it away
Look there's the picture I tracked down for you
I hung it on my wall after we were through
Look there's the letter that I never gave to you
Explaining all the reasons why I fell for you
Take it away
Cause it's a place that I never get to go again
And it's such a waste of time and memories
I'll never get back
It's taking up space in my closet
And boxes underneath this bed
Where we layed
So just take it away
Take it away
There's the sweater I kept after that big fight
The one I slept with almost every night
There's the presents you left
Clouding up my mind
There's the pillow I burried into
While I cried
The sheets that you saw me through
The pages I wrote for you
Guitar you used to play
And songs I sang to you
Take it away
Cause it's a place that I never get to go again
And it's such a waste of time and memories
I'll never get back
It's taking up space in my closet
And boxes underneath this bed
Where we layed
So just take it away
Take it away
I've kept the things you wrote
All the ryhmes
The tickets stubs
From all the times we waited in the cold all night
I remember
Kept all the words you never said
Running here around my head
This clutter is such a blur now
But I remember every house in this town
Everywhere you let me down
Take it away
Cause it's a place I never wanna go again
And it's such a waste of time
And memories I'll never get back
It's taking up space in my closet
And boxes underneath this bed
Where we layed
So just take it away
