It's a face I recognize
It's a race that I'm losing
Come and catch me every time
It's a fight worth the forfeit
Take my pride, just let me out
It's looking like I'm tied down to it
Hit the lights, I'm all tapped out
But you got me alone
And I'm losing control
Ready, ready, ready set go
So tell me I won't need to think twice again
Tell me I'm allowed to breathe, the lights are
In front of me, I'm running, leave me struggling
I'm hopeless, I'm hopeless
Tell me all is as it seems once again
I can taste it I believe your promises
I feel like I already need to break from this
But I'm hopeless, in the road again
Tell me I'm hopeless
Feeling small, lamb meet lion
Look what I am up against
Never faced such brutal challenge
Stare in the eyes of dangerous
You might also likeOn a rope that's left me hanging
Lost the strength to pull alone
If you tell me you're not faking
I'll consider letting go
But you got me alone
And I'm losing control
Ready, ready, ready set go
So tell me I won't need to think twice again
Tell me I'm allowed to breathe, the lights are
In front of me, I'm running, leave me struggling
I'm hopeless, I'm hopeless
Tell me all is as it seems once again
I can taste it I believe your promises
I feel like I already need to break from this
But I'm hopeless, in the road again
Tell me I'm hopeless
Again, I'm fearless
Can I convince you?
Can I convince you?
Again, I'm ruthless
Can I resist you?
So tell me I won't need to think twice again
Tell me I'm allowed to breathe, the lights are
In front of me, I'm running, leave me struggling
I'm hopeless, I'm hopeless
Tell me all is as it seems once again
I can taste it I believe your promises
I feel like I already need to break from this
But I'm hopeless, in the road again
