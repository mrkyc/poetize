If you know what's right you'll get yourself under my skin
Hold on to 5am I expect you to know I'm here to win
And baby we'll end up back here again you can count on it
I can't remember my whole last weekend
I think I may have been playing pretend
Is it just me or are we two kids again
Doing nothing, even doing nothing on the weekends
On our way to the big tall buildings, we pass everything
So why on earth does your old street look so much fun to me?
Why is traffic so exciting and it feels like we are hiding?
Take your time cuz I'm taking mine
I can't remember my whole last weekend
I think I may have been playing pretend
Is it just me or are we two kids again
Doing nothing, doing nothing
I can't remember what the sky even looked like
But I saw big city lights in your eyes
Is it just me or are we a damn good time
Doin nothin, doin nothin on the weekends
Even doing nothing on the weekends
Check out this old worn trampoline
Lets kick a can or hide and seek
I don't think I need any, any of that sleep
Join me on this old trampoline
Lets kick a can or hide and seek
I don't think you need any, any of that sleep
I can't remember my whole last weekend
I think I may have been playing pretend
Is it just me or are we two kids again
Doing nothing, doing nothing
I can't remember what the sky even looked like
But I saw big city lights in your eyes
Is it just me or are we a damn good time
Doin nothing, doing nothin on the weekends
Nothin on the weekends
Nothin on the weekends
