Gotta be sure I don't mistake this time for fall
Gotta be sure I don't pick up and try to call
I'm looking for signs in unpaved sidewalks, burnout lights and endless halls
Gotta be sure I don't stay up and think too deep
Gotta be sure you won't catch up to me in sleep
The only light on my road home, flickered when you appeared on my phone

And the radio is playing songs of hope
And I just hope you won't leave me alone

Irony you're teasing me
Just when I think these eyes are clear
Irony you're giving me these worn out wings, just to keep me near
And its not enough I think too much
I fall in lust like someone does
Irony, irony you look too much like love

Gotta be sure you believe I'm still unconvinced
Gotta be sure I lightly tread where you can't swim
I've been looking for signs and pictures
Bars and these long walks go nowhere
You might also like
And the radio is playing songs of trust
But I don't trust you not to see me

Irony you're teasing me
Just when I think these eyes are clear
Irony you're giving me these worn out wings, just to keep me near
And its not enough I think too much
I fall in lust like someone does
Irony, irony you look too much like love

You look too much like love
You look too much like love

Irony you're teasing me
Just when I think these eyes are clear
Irony you're giving me these worn out wings just to keep me near
And its not enough I think too much
I fall in lust like someone does

Irony, irony you look too much like love
You look too much like love
