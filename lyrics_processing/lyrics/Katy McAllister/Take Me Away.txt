You're beautiful, It's nice to see
I wasn't looking for anyone to be with me
Didn't think you would leave this place for so long
I forgot about your brooding stare
So much to talk about but you sit there
And don't have much to say
When you were far away, I planned for this day

And now I can't think of
What I was gonna say
You sit across from me
And I can't seem to think straight
I can't seem to remember
How it got this way
Should be holding it together

But you take me away
And my breath is far from steady
Can you see it on my face?
Don't have to say
Much to me till I'm ready
To up and run away
Don't know what you even do
But I'm dying to just be around you
So take me away
For tonight cause I know
You'll be leaving soon anyway
Anyway
You might also like
Entertain my thoughts
You're like a fantasy
Leaving my stomach in knots
You're within my reach
But seem untouchable
It's like I'm trapped in a movie scene
And I'm the one who's
Too damn obvious
You're a mystery
And I wasn't born to mind-read
You're the one who's
Blessed with perfection
I'm the hot mess
Not easy, just easy to read

Just take me away
And my breath is far from steady
Can you see it on my face?
Don't have to say
Much to me till I'm ready
To up and run away
Don't know what you even do
But I'm dying to just be around you
So take me away
For tonight cause I know
You'll be leaving soon anyway
Anyway
Take me away
And my breath is far from steady
Can you see it on my face?
Don't have to say
Much to me till I'm ready
To up and run away
Don't know what you even do
But I'm dying to just be around you
So take me away
For tonight cause I know
You'll be leaving soon anyway
Anyway, anyway
