Is that you, your eyes slowly fading?
Is that you, your mind full of tears?
Is that you, searchin' for a good time?
Is that you, waitin' for all these years?

And I hope you're feelin' better
Yes, I hope you're feelin' good
Yes, I hope you're feelin' better

Is that you, look across the ocean
Is that you, thinkin nothing's really there?
Is that you, waiting for the sunshine?
Is that you, when all you see is glare?

And I hope you're feelin' better
Yes, I hope you're feelin' good
Yes, I hope you're feelin' better


Is that you, who never saw your baby?
Is that you, who never had a friend?
Is that you, movin' to a new town?
Is that you, will diamonds replace your friends?

And I hope you're feelin' better
Yes, I hope you're feelin' good
