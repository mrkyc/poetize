When you belong to a posse, a team
Is it real or is it just a scheme?
Was it all in your dream?

Many people and places I've been
Before you can start you first must end
Tend to all that is needed
Or your purpose in life is defeated
I know this from trial and practice
Stand up, young man, if you lack this
Knowledge to proceed, exact attitude
Get in the mood for a new interlude
Sonic call to arms
As a female stand and flex with her charms
Is it game on our feelings playing
Come on, boy, if you know what I'm saying
Each time, each day
A brother struggles, then lose his way
A path in the wrong direction
Searching for the meaning of perfection
Time and time and time again
A life decided by the point of a gun end
Oh, what a way to go
It was a brother we all know
Not yet lived, ain't full grown
Coffin closed cause a hole in your dome
Yo, life is a wondrous dream

When you belong to the posse, a team
Is it real or is it just a scheme?
Was it all in a dream?

Knowledge reigns supreme over all
If you have it, you'll never fall
You can go up against the wall
Cause love conquer all
Preach, but pretend not to see it, reach
And some day try to be it, each
And every man must have a goal
Instead some sell their souls
To fly cars and truck gold
Tec-9, and you're ready to roll
If you could see within yourself
Feel how the next man felt
Bless the father, protect the son
Don't try to solve it with a gun
Nothing change when someone dies
Over money, drugs and lies
Wake up and open your eyes
Can't you see the disguise?
My chain, a name, my claim to fame
It's in how you play the game
How ya livin, how ya live?
What you take and how much you give
Yo, yo, life is a wondrous dream
Life is a wondrous dream, also it seems
When you belong to a posse, a team
Is it real or is it just a scheme?
Is it all in a dream?

Fly girl - truckin gold
Gettin paid, only 20 years old
Time fly havin fun
By 21 she was over and done
She's a has-been, gone with the wind
On a corner, now you wanna swing
Pay a price, sure treat you right
Ain't that nice?
Poetess, poetic master
Kick the beat one time faster
Drop knowledge cause I care
I know the game, I was there
Coolin with a big drug posse
Friends droppin, feds they clock me
Schemin for a way to lock me
I was fast, they just couldn't stop me
Gettin paid, paid with the quickness
Wonder why I diss this
Life? Because it happened one night
There was a fight and a man lost his life
He grew cold in the part of the soul
He was a young man, only 20 years old
Tears I cry as I say goodbye
Why'd you have to die?
Say why'd you have to die?
Say why'd you have to die?
Life is a wondrous dream, also it seems
When you belong to the posse, a team
Is it real or is it just a scheme?
Was it all in a dream?
Life is a wondrous dream, also it seems
When you belong to a posse, a team
Is it real or is it just a scheme?
