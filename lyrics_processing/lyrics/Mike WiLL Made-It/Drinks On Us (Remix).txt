Everybody wanna know where you got your stuff
And you say "Oh man, I got the muthafuckin' plug"
Everybody sayin', "Ayy, where you get that from?"
And you feel so coolin' every time you in the club

If you wanna go to the bar, drinks on us
If you wanna go to the bar, drinks on us
If you wanna go to the bar, drinks on us
If you wanna go to the bar, drinks on us

If y'all wanna hang out with the gangstas, y'all go 'head
I'm just gonna count a little motherfuckin' bread
If y'all wanna slither with the snakes, then y'all go 'head
I keep a pedicured lawn so them snakes, they will be dead
Tears of joy run down my cheek onto the soil
I would trick off on your bitch, but she ain't loyal (She disloyal)
Nothing but love for you niggas riding with no tint
Grand total, five digits, make these hoes repent
Popped a couple pills, I feel like Johnny Mad Dog (Geek, geek)
I lost a couple friends, I'm tryna get these bands dog (Geek, geek)
You know we in this bitch, we throwin' up them grands, y'all
And once we get that club, we 'bout that fun, go H.A.M y'all
My comrades want them mills, my comrades want them millions
My comrades want them bills, my comrades want them billions
My comrades want that tri, my comrades want them trillions
Yeah, we need more than racks, my comrades want them 'illions

Been provin', you ain't ever goin' up
Every time you hit the club, you always fuck it up

Bet you never see my niggas pull up to the spot
I just signed so many checks my wrist about to pop
If you ever talk about me when I'm not around
Your girl'll probably tell me when I put it in her mouth
(When I put it in her mouth)
Put your wallet in your pocket, bitch, you playing
(Bitch, you playing)
Even when I wasn't on, I'm always paying
(You know who's paying)
Went from hipsters, now it's models and these singers (On the low)
And my hair be growing like a fuckin' Saiyan (Ooh)
I popped a couple pills, I think that I'm Devante
I fuck a bitch from Lost and Found like every Monday (Oh yeah, oh yeah)
My jawline so defined, I'm wildin' like I'm Gunplay (Oh yeah, oh yeah)
You see no white inside my eyes and it's a fun day
But when I'm workin', girl, I'm workin' for the millions (Workin' for the millions)
Girl, when I'm workin', I be workin' for them billions (Ooh yeah)
Why your hand out, I ain't trickin', find another sucka'
These bitches tryna make a livin', but
You know I been on now, then, and I'm next
Every year my year, you know I always wanna flex

(XO)

Say my, say my, say my name
Switchin' bitches and I'm switchin' lanes
When they call last shot for alcohol
I just wanna take my last drink
I just wanna sip some clean purple
Hit the car lot and just made a purchase
I just realized that I am a star
Cruisin' my coupe up the boulevard
None of my pictures are watermarked
Got more water than the waterboy
Avianne draped me up, nigga
Yellow bones suck my nuts, nigga
She think it's chocolate, but she call me Papi
Papi Chulo, I'ma get it poppin'
Got some red bottoms on a hottie thotty
Put them heels to her nipples in new Cavalli
I just came in like a kamikaze
I just walk 'round like a zombie, daddy
I don't like bein' in paddy wagons
So no remorse, I'm about the fetti
Had a few horses come by the telly
Eating each other, they get some credit
Got commas on commas, I'm really ready
I'm really 'bout to pour up on a jet
I would never mention niggas names
Tell a nigga, a nigga never did exist
You niggas never never been a threat
These niggas never get enough attention
I just put the bitch on punishment
I've been hangin' where the money been
I don't know what type of love is this
Can you tell me where my dogs at?
Put a hollow in your ball cap
What type of nigga you call that?
When I hang up on you, never call back
I'm a money counter, count my own money
Been provin', you ain't ever goin' up
Every time you hit the club, you always fuck it up
