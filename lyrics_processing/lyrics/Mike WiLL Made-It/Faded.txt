Stunna man what it do now?
Yeah, yeah, yeah... Woo!

Even I look at my diamonds sometimes and kiss em
That's why my x my x and I don't miss her
The way she acting right now I should of pimped her
Throwing shots of liquor on my liver my nigga
Even my niggas know I love em my niggas
And ain't no love for you hoes you hoes crazy
And we ain't neva gone fold we stay faded
Yeah we stay faded

Ain't no water running down my eyes
Ain't no love for the other side
The way these diamonds twinkle all in your eye ball
I know it should have been a crime dog, by law
And most of these fake niggas
They done fell off
I'm rasing the stakes, nigga
And I'm well off
I'm counting that cake
Trimming my nails off
And when times is hard
I move a bale off
And when Im whipping them lanes
Im in that new spur
All you niggas some lame
Softer than new fur
Congratulations to niggas like me dog
Get money, get money and I don't see ya'll
I don't see flaw, I don't see flaw

You waking up and you're living your dreams nigga
I'm gettin crazy money with these New Orleans nigga
And only God can judge a nigga holding on the hammer
I could've fucked her from the start and put her on camera
I kept it hustling with you bitches
Kept it real hustler
You fuckin with a gutta nigga
So you will suffer
Helicopter flying over your head
We chop it up
We live the life that need
I ride in cars that you never can drive
We fuck the baddest bitches money can buy
Ain't love lost, ain't no love gained
This a young real nigga
Real pain
