Where is my money? Pullin up gunnin'
Automatic tommies, stomachs
I don't mash out wit' nothing, .45 holds 11
I got birds and they nestin (Gurrr) S.L.I.M.E like reverend (slatt)
Keep her, I thought she renewin, I'm goin' in-fluence
If she don't got class, that's truancy, my VV's are yellow like urine
I smoke me a blunt to the head, then bed, keep that
Ride that lil bitch like a bike, better yet pegs
Ever since I got my ice from Elliott, I been leavin' em dead
Karats on a nigga wrist and his ears and I got that big head
I don't give no fuck about you little bitches, feel like you are dead
Bought me a coupe and I pulled the roof and I pulled off and I sped

Two cups full of muddy, my heart's in the gutter
Fuck the felony, I beat the charges
See me in a truck, it's Maserati
All my passion is reachin' the masses
All this cash is right under my mattress
I go smashin' all over the atlas
I go splashin' right up with the action
All these bullets wrapped up in some plastic
Thirty shots hold it right in the ratchet
All my mans are straight up and savage
Sleep on Fendi, I play with the baddest
Easy money, these cars and these hoes and lights, they be flashing
It's causing the madness
Bitch came straight to my crib with no panties
She tryna be down with a bandit
For these bands, I'ma take full advantage
When I whip up, I whip panoramic
Fuck the motive, just pass me a Xanax
You just left me alone and abandoned
Shoulda known I was causing some damage
Al Capone, I jump right in a Phantom
Had your mama on crack cause I serve it
I'm just living my life with a burden
I hop in a spur and I'm closing the curtain
As I look right in your eyes
And deep down in your soul, I can tell that you hurting
You want the bales, you want soft
You want hard, you want kush, you want molly, that's perfect
Ricky, Ricky, Ricky James, got evicted, made a change
Started grinding harder than I ever did
Before and then, I got the fame

American and foreign, bank AC enormous
Dance to my performance, fixate her like I'm Lawrence
Martin but extra funny, everything 'bout the money
Everybody love me, I'm your favorite subject
Playin' with the bills though, countin', fallin' down like dildo
Tearin' up tracks like railroad, whole bail lookin' like earlobes
Man it's cracky and no pecan, dump her then refine
Jump jeans, no Levine, me and Young Thugga tail large G rides
Come on
