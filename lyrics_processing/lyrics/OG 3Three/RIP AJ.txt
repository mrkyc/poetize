Aye, aye, aye, ain't that probably Tago
Pipe that shit up TNT

The police killed my dawg
Rest in peace to AJ
I'm still runnin' wild, sendin' niggas Jpay
Bitch I'll gun you down, have you screamin' Mayday
Yeah, and still  the laws until I meet my death day, gang
Droppin' the top, yeah it's rented
38 Baby deposit they sentence
Whole lotta racks in the back of the Bentley
Running back, quarter back, he bitchin'
All of my niggas, they down for the killin'
If I die it's the ones who with me
Sparsely covered like brand new Givenchy
I pray for my niggas errytime they with me
Let's go

Rest in peace AJ
Best believe I'm always with my niggas
I'm steady talkin'  the law
That's right or wrong, won't get no bigger
45 shots won't kill no nigga
He right up in heaven peaceful
That lil' nigga rich, yeah
The police hate on us, let's prove 'em wrong
Come to get 'em, show 'em I won't give a 
'Cause when the odds all against us all we got is us
Now every show that I go I gotta keep a tuck
Bitch come and try your luck, pussy
Every nigga up in the 
I'ma send  when I can
One phone call, that's who I am
If I ain't answer you ain't gimme no chance
Handlin' business, you know I'm the man
 like a water dam
Prices goin' up, I'm in high demand, gang
