Might be in Milwaukee chasing bands in the snow nigga
Yeah, Three

Climb to the top of the pint of the seal
My niggas we chasing bags for real
Fuck one bag, we need a mill
My niggas we all need a deal, gang
Shoot to the top just like rocket
Nothing but hundreds in my pocket
I'm like whoa kemosabe
I'm like fuck 'bout what you hollerin', gang

Call for the pack you know I send it
We wrap it up and then remix it
My niggas we stuck up in the trenches
You know that gang forever getting it, gang
My niggas we holdin' it down for real
We balling hard with no deal
Ice on me but I can't chill
I'm screaming fuck how nigga feel, gang
They want me to flock but I can't go
I keep hitters on the road
I got that bag, yeah that's for sure
You play, you gon' die, thats a must that you know, gang

Plus I'm on that fluid, shout out to my mans
We running them bands, I'm working my hand
Going Kirko with the bands
Fell out with my last, shit what to do
Ain't have no fucking option, so I gotta send my crew
I worked my wrist and stood in, all the pots too
I was a crack baby, a trench baby, ooh
Shit what to do, I'm stuck up in the trenches
I told the bitch it's game time, like it's fourth and inches
Make the bitch catch the sideline if she ain't wit it
Ask the bitch where your game face ho, why you ain't gettin' it?
