Fredonem

The way that I feel right now, I really need a pill right now
I'm sippin' this mud, takin' these drugs, I can get you killed right now
Lot of pain what I feel right now
I'm just tryna see a mil right now
And all I got is my brothers
Same struggle, different mothers
And we so motivated (and we so motivated)
Me and my niggas dedicated (me and my niggas dedicated)
And we just steady paper chasin' (and we just steady paper chasin')
We do this shit up on the daily, that's just for greatness

I pour a deuce in my Fanta, Akorn, ain't no Hi-Tech
I realize I'm the hottest, these niggas need to pay they respect
When you boss up you gon' get a check
Fuck a hater, tell 'em wear a vest
When we catch you we shootin' above the neck
It was a threat so it's disrespect
This for my youngins right now (right now)
Hustling, gettin' it in (gettin' it in)
This for my niggas locked up (locked up)
Keep it G from the street to the pen (street to the pen)
Hold your head up high (hold your head high)
And keep it real on your business (on your business)
The grind don't stop nigga (it don't)
Shit it is what it is

Grindin' hard, shit I can't stop (I can't stop)
Main bitch think she wanna flop
Think I'm trippin' 'bout some niggas, shit
Bitch I'm headed straight to the top
I'm deep in my bag, bitch I beat the block
I came up from nothing to something now
My hustle game so relentless
I'm stuck in the trenches, I pray that we make it out
I tried to find us a better route
I fuck around, take the paper route
Pick up the bag and we set the cost
I do what I want, bitch I am the boss (I am)
Shooters on go, never turn 'em off
I'm the QB, they gon' run the ball
I call the play and they gon' pick you off
We gon' stand tall, we'll never fall (on gang)
