The past, the past
I swear it won't last
Niggas and bitches oh they on, get that bag
My past is gone shit, I hope I don't crash
I pull a heist shit I'm a smash the bag
The past, the past
I swear it won't last
Niggas and bitches oh they on, get that bag
My past is gone shit, I hope I don't crash
I pull a heist shit I'm a smash the bag

Mmmm, long nights
We getting it in ain't had no court we used to hide
They talking now I don't know you, it's a shame, crazy life
You know we stuck up in them trenches but I promise it's alright
Got so much for my gang but they never know
We got errthing up out the mud and that's in our soul
Fucking fake  we tryna get it, shit that's how that go
One main rule slip up once, and you gotta go
I was on my own on my hand
You pulled a stunt on the man
And I'm a burn copper  that's way faster than a round
Diamonds whithered in the down
I'm really tripping, yes I am
Or I may be overseas, pass the lashes down

The past it hurt my heart oh really used to be fine
Forgot my Donald Ace first it was called main thing
It really hurt me, he's my dog, had an allergy
Shit got worse when he held, his mom passed
He turned violent, lost his papa 
Try moving to the devil but I ain't lost his 
It was really fucking crazy dude
He caught a body
I pray to the almighty
Lord give us faith and guidance
We pay the price and where I'm froma
The system got us all caught up ccept the outcome
I'm grinding and all my people told you I'm the one
I'm a get the bag and run the set I told em, level up
The past, the past
