And I know these niggas prayin' on our downfall
Looked at both of 'em in they eyes, bitch we gon' stand tall
Always kept it real, I never fuckin' downed y'all
This what it is, it's just the code 'til I'm dead and gone
Whoa, never go against the grain, gotta feed all y'all
Ooh, and I put this on my heart, we gon' forever ball, ooh, yeah

I got these pounds up on the floor, bitch how you think they move?
Anybody can get it, nigga I don't pick or choose
Bitch sleep on 3, I make 'em hit the snooze
Real nigga, can't nobody fit my shoes
Yeah, nigga I stick and move
Bitch class in session, take 'em back to school
