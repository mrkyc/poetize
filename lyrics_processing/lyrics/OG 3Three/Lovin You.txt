Bae you know that you need me so why would you leave me
I'm lovin' you, girl you know I fuck with you

No matter what it is, promise be there for me
I put my pride to the side so don't thug me
Hold it down, keep it tight when we thuggin'
I'm addicted to your love, girl you drug me
And I just made a move again, broken heart I'm tryna mend
Now I'm floating down I-10, blowing purp up in the wind
Girl I'm really tryna vibe with you
You know any situation I'ma ride with you
I'm in love, and she know I'm in love
But she don't want a thug
Yeah I know what up, wake up and we fuck
I ain't tryna fuss, is this love or lust?

Cold hearted, lately I ain't been loving much

Hurt my soul, 'cause baby I really need your trust

Giuseppe stepping, moon walking, put some bling on you
Girl tone it down 'cause you know you go insane on 'em
Yeah, all of my niggas say I'm rocking bags
Girl you too official, yeah you show your ass
When you think I don't appreciate that make me flash
Think I'm doing wrong but I'm in my bag
You send a text sayin' that I'm acting different
You gotta understand I'm on a mission
These hoes can't fuck with you, no competition
Sometimes you just need to sit down and listen
