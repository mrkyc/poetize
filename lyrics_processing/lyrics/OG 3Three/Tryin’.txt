They don't see the pain, they don't see you tryin'
Take all my pride to the grave, I ain't lyin'
Forever gang so forever we gon' ride
My girl be trippin' but shit I ain't got the time
And people say that they won't change, yeah
I'm stuck off in the game, yeah
You say that you know me, how come?
Where the fuck you was at, where you from?
I was posted right up in the slums
Applyin' pressure with all them pumps, yeah yeah yeah yeah

Where was you at that night? when I was on that flight
I'll stick you for that price, young nigga will take your life
All gas, no brakes, no pipes, I gotta get it right
I'm pushin' hard, where y'all get sent tonight
I do this for my gang, forever in my life
YB I love you nigga, mama raised us right
I went to school, you made it out, can't believe our life
But we still up in them trenches, know that shit ain't right
If they ain't gang, no they can't hang
No cap in my domain, it ain't a shame
Came over through the rain, got blood all on my reins
I'm bleeding so much I got a stain

I go get it in, turn a Honda Accord to a Benz
YB thuggin', full of pills with Twin
KD and B on the road gettin' it in
Got so much love in my heart for Ben
You know I love that ten ten ten
I'm sendin' shots up in the wind
Disrespect baby ten
Play you gon' lay, we creep 'round where you stay
Just left the A, even got some plugs by the Bay
This shit ain't safe, how I move around out of state
You know what it is, I keep it so real, you know I can't play games
I'm all alone at night, just me and all my ice
Diamonds dancin' so bright, I can barely see the light
Make a bitch think twice, I put this on my life
I'm gettin' some head tonight, I'm her bed tonight
They don't see the pain, they don't see you tryin'
Take all my pride to the grave, I ain't lyin'
Forever gang so forever we gon' ride
My girl be trippin' but shit I ain't got the time
And people say that they won't change, yeah
I'm stuck off in the game, yeah
You say that you know me, how come?
Where the fuck you was at, where you from?

Applyin' pressure with all them pumps, yeah yeah yeah yeah

Yeah, up in this game nigga
I was applyin' pressure with them pumps, for real nigga
Ask KD, ask YB, ask Ben Ten, ask Big B
Yeah y'all know they gang nigga
Nigga know what the fuck it is nigga, this that 3 Point Line, yeah
