Now all the ladies I need you to come up here
Come to the stage, come to the front, come break your back in

For my ladies trying to break their back in
I'll go get that thing and I'm talking back in
When that mama bend it over I'm ready to tap in
I'm gonna get to busting it open like she was the mac 10
I'm loving her black skin
The way she moving in motion ? is attracting
The booty big as the ocean is dragging me back in
The booty on auto pilot feel like I'm relaxing
I can tell she with the mood by the way she keep acting
