Hear that piano in that bitch, that Three shit

I told my niggas anything can happen with me
If it happen I know y'all took care of me
Make sure my mama straight, make sure my family eat
If I go before I wake I pray my soul to keep
I told my niggas anything can happen with me
If it happen I know y'all took care of me
Make sure my mama straight, make sure my family eat
If I go before I wake I pray my soul to keep
Don't hold your head, it's alright
Just throw your threes, let go of your pride
Ain't no cappin', I really lived that life
I keep it one hundred, so no I can't lie

Ooh, what is you sayin'?
I'm runnin' them bands
I'm stuck in the trenches, ain't sellin' no grams
I ain't tryna be a statistic, they know that I'm gifted, they know who I am
I call all the shots and I beat up the block, my nigga I don't give a damn
Tryna ride my wave, get shot in your face
My niggas they play with K's, don't act brave
They say I need to pray more, and change my ways
In the system they treat you like shit, think that we slaves
I tell my niggas every day that I love 'em
Man that's gang and I love you, I swear I love you
I kiss and hug 'em, man we been all through the struggles
You know the gang forever thuggin', man I promise we gon' bubble
