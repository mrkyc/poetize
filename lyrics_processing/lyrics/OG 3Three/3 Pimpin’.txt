Three in one day
I don't know what to say
Just broke a pill record
And I started yesterday

He know how I feel young nigga just tryna get paid
Brought two bitches down for six hours
You know how it feel to have the power
Tell the bitch what I want
More Joe like Austin Powers
Tell bitch fly me to the Eiffel Tower
Got me feeling like Richard Power
Bitch got a hell of a mug
Cocaine a hell of a drug
My niggas they serious bout the shit
The pipe point blank pear bottle bitch
She choose, I want to choose
And if she lose gotta dip
I make the whole water wet
Take the bitch to the strip
Gotta make a quick flip
Purp first ass last
