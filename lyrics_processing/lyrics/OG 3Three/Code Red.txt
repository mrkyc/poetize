I heard a nigga want them problems, we saw them with them choppers
Another man dead, code red, we can't stop them
I know I need some help, I pray the Lord, that he got me
This shit we in too dead, I just pray he stop the violence
Oooh, I know they plotting on me
Oooh, I know they watching a G
Oooh, I need some money to feed
But I'll never let you bitches steal me (damn)

Pull up with that hot shit like middle of summer
