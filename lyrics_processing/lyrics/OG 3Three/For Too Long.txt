For too long I've been doing this shit
My whole plan was to trap and get rich
Never look back on what we do
We took some chances to get right here
Some niggas switch, some niggas ain't changed
I never switch, I'm a always stay the same
I'm a stay loyal and true to this game
I'm a keep it one hunnid, you just do the same

Gotta hustle hard if I wanna get rich
Gotta think smart I can't talk about the business
Gotta play my cards right I ain't never ever slip
If you ever wonder why I walk with a limp
Got a 357 on my hip so don't trip
If a nigga outta line it's a must to get zipped
If a nigga outta line it's a must to get killed
Lot a niggas switched up and changed
Told them niggas I'm a always stay the same
Stay loyal, stay true to they game
Stick up my hands and stay out the way
I ain't never have no time for the waste
Get money in the trap in a day
Bitch call up my phone, she blowing me up
I hunged up the chip in her face
Tryna steal a million dollars in my safe
Turn to em when I'm tryna get a raise
Tryna take care my family then  up the hay
Yeah we gon get em one day
On my knees every night and I pray
Pray to the Lord that we see a better days
Hope that they free up all my niggas in the cage
And rest in peace to the ones in the grave
