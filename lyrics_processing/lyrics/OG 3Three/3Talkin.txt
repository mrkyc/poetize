They talkin down that I don't know what I do
Get on my knees and I pray on to you
Three of them dead by the lights of the blue
They always tell me stay tall when we up in the booth
I keep my head high
I gotta watch out for the feds now
Niggas they really want me dead huh
I keep the strap you think I'm scared huh
Bitches go red now

I keep my strap you think Im worried about a nigga
You must ain't heard we really swerved up in the curved behind your niggas
My niggas sick we roughles we dont worried about no nigga
Today Im feeling like Chapo and drop a bag apon your hitta'
Lotta monay upon my mind can't waste no time
We gotta get it, we've got stack and grind until we shine
Tryna rush it , Im moving fast, got to take my time
Im pushin' the gas , going hard, you know I ain't lying

They talkin down that I don't know what I do
Get on my knees and I pray on to you
Three of them dead by the lights of the blue
They always tell me stay tall when we up in the booth
I keep my head high
I gotta watch out for the feds now
Niggas they really want me dead huh
I keep the strap you think I'm scared huh
Bitches go red now

Sippin' on drank, cuz' I just pour me a Douse
If I go fleshing on the line I don't mean to be rude (gang)

They talkin down that I don't know what I do
Get on my knees and I pray on to you
Three of them dead by the lights of the blue
They always tell me stay tall when we up in the booth
