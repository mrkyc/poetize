Nigga all we know is murder, homicide
Murder one, we gon' ride
You niggas die, we gon' slide
Urgent care, homicide
Nigga all we know is murder
My niggas and we purging
Who the fuck said we ain't working? fuck a nigga
Who the fuck said we ain't deserve it? we out here workin'

Bag after bag and I switch up the scene
Who the fuck say that they want it with Three?
I'm double cup and I'm sippin' on lean
I'm pouring a three all in my drink
You know I'm a heavy drink sipper
Nigga play, I'll zip him
Sending shots, I don't miss 'em
Keep it G, confidential
I'm thuggin' hard with my team
We ballin' hard, don't you see?
Narcotics say we got them P's
Fuck I smoke a lot of weed
I ain't taking no pleas
Rather be a flea on the flee
Told the bitch say please
If she want to fly with Three
I went blew a bag and got it right back
You know that we stacking this cheese
I keep it one hundred, I keep it too real
For you to lie to me
I go get that pack, I go get that sack
Young nigga he do it with ease
They say I was too hot, you know I'm on fire
Four hundred degrees

From the top I look down and see
Used to be in the whip with KD
I got rich, now they plotting on me
All of niggas they sliding for me
187, it's off with your cap
Don't fuck with these niggas, these niggas be cap
Navigation, bitch I'm way off the map
Ten and Big B, they be up in the trap
Since I got money I don't like to rap
Fuck that lil nigga, I'll bust if he snap
Fuck on that ho, I'ma pull out her hair
Run up on me, tell that nigga I dare him
Hop out the whip with that stick and I pay him
Murder murder, put that shit on the cam
Brick after brick, I don't shoot at the rim
Fuck all that shit, I'ma shoot when I see him
These niggas so broke so I don't want to be 'em
These niggas some hoes, you know I don't feel 'em
Talk all that shit but you know I don't hear 'em
Fire this bitch, I'ma kill 'em
Nigga all we know is murder, homicide
Murder one, we gon' ride
You niggas die, we gon' slide
Urgent care, homicide
Nigga all we know is murder
My niggas and we purging
Who the fuck said we ain't working? fuck a nigga
