All eyes on three
All eyes on three, live the life of a thug nigga 'til the day I die
Live the life of a boss player 'cause we be gettin' high

Woke up to 50 enemies tryna shit on my image
Plottin' on spinnin' 'round my block
You think my niggas ain't spinnin'?
Won't let you niggas keep my out my 
Know you niggas some bitches
Refused to let you trick me or play me out my position
Depend on me like the first 15
I got these bitches feedin' on me 'cause they know I'm a G
Bitches pursue me like a drink, get me back onto my feet
Now I appreciate the love but you can get off your knees
Check the road, check in nigga it's prime time
Like  say retarded, best believe nigga I'm 'bout mine
You paint a picture nigga, you 'sposed to be up in crunch time
Claim you in your bag but nigga knowin' you 'bout lyin
 ass nigga

All eyes on three, live the life of a boss player 'til the day I die
 around and get cross laden, the future in my eyes
All eyes on three, live the life of a thug nigga 'til the day I die
Live the life of a boss player 'cause we be gettin' high
You might also like
Worried 'bout bitches and bitches ain't worried about now nigga
Pick my weight and pay it off when I get all bigger
Bitches decievin' knowin' they leachin' all up on all niggas
Switch my lane up, I got my change up and now I'm richer
187 we be slidin' like 
I gotta keep a van off niggas when I ride
Retaliation a must, I promise nigga you gon' die
Hold on, stop at the store
There you go, let's open fire, blah, blah, blah
So much  in the world, how could I  myself?
I done blew a hundred K, how could I commit myself?
Put a  on my arm, I never needed no help
Ask me how I felt, I'm prayin', runnin' for help

All eyes on three, live the life of a boss player 'til the day I die
 around and get cross laden, the future in my eyes
