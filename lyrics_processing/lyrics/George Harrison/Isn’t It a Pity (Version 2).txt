Isn't it a pity? Isn't it a shame?
How we break each other's hearts and cause each other pain
How we take each other's love without thinking anymore
Forgetting to give back, isn't it a pity?

Some things take so long, but how do I explain?
When not too many people can see we're all the same
And because of all their tears, their eyes can't hope to see
The beauty that surrounds them, now, isn't it a pity?


Now, isn't it a pity? Oh, now, isn't it a shame?
How we break each other's hearts and cause each other pain
How we take each other's love without thinking anymore
