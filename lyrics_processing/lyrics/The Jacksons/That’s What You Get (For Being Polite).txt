Jack still cries day and night
Jack's not happy with his life
He wanna do this, he wanna do that
He wanna be kind but ends up flat
For love
For love

He tries so hard to give a lot
He wants to be what he is not
But love's not harsh, and love's not bad
But what's he's doin' for love is so sad
He wants to be so bad
He wants to be so bad

All the time gettin' in
Thinks he can't get out
Somethin' deep inside of him
Eatin' up the pride of him
That makes him buy things for the girls

That's what you get for being polite
For being polite

Jack still sits, all alone
He lives the world that is his own
He's lost in thought, of who to be
I wish to God that he would see
Just love
Give him love

He tries so hard to give a lot
He wants to be what he is not
But love's not harsh and love's not bad
But what's he's doin' for love is so sad
He wants to be so bad
He wants to be so bad

All the time gettin' in
Things he can't get out
Somethin' deep inside of him
Eatin' up the pride of him
That makes him buy things for the girls

That's what you get for being polite
For being polite
