Let me show you the way to go

I don't know everything
But there's something I do know (I know, I know)
I've read and heard a lot
And now, we're ready to show
That we can come together and think like one
(Come together now)
Live together underneath the sun
Please, please let me show ya

Just put your trust in me
I'll try not to letcha down
(Letcha down, letcha down)
The job is hard to do
But only we can't let us down
'Cause we can help each other to overcome
We can do it, we can do it now
