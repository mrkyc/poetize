Here I am reaching out for you
But there's nothing to reach for
Guess my mind don't believe what my eyes have seen
The blame's you, baby
You know and I know nobody wants you with your
Wishy, washy ways
Your mama raised you from a child
Spent no time worthwhile
And I feel you really accomplished nothing, no
You've got to change your style of life
You've gotta change
You've got to change your style of life
Oh, there you go, said, I think I love you
But it's a matter of time
I have told you, I told ya how bad I wish to hold you
My feelings have doubt in mind
You know and I know that you can do better
Tomorrow's a brand new day
I have tried to make you change, but you remain the same
And I feel you really accomplished nothing, no
You've got to change your style of life
You've gotta change
You've got to change your style of life

Haven't been together for too long
Now, you're acting like you own me
Hey, baby, that's so wrong
You hate to suffer for what you get
My love don't come easy
Why don't you change, baby and please me
You've got to change your style of life
I don't like what you're giving me, baby
You've got to change your life, baby
You've got to change your style of life
Turn around, you've to got to really
You've got to change your style of life
You've got to change your life
You've got to change your life
You've got to change your style of life
