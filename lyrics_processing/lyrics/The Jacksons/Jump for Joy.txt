Of what life is all about
They put values in the wrong things
And in happiness they lose out
'Cause being happy is a feeling
This is all a frame of mind
And every moment you feel sad and blue
You could be having a real good time
Why don't you jump for joy and be happy?
Why don't you jump for joy and be glad?
If you just try it, feel better
And have the best time you ever had
Why don't you jump for joy and be happy?
Why don't you jump for joy and be glad?
If you just try it, I'm sure you'll like it
And have the best time you ever had
Do it, do it, do it, do it
Do it, hmm
There is no sense in worrying
'Cause that won't solve a thing
Chances are what's ever worrying you
Is not as bad as it seems
Being down won't last forever
'Cause nothing really stays the same
You will have a bright tomorrow
There's always sunshine after rain
Why don't you jump for joy and be happy?
Why don't you jump for joy and be glad?
If you just try it, I know you'll like it
And have the best time you ever had
Why don't you jump for joy and be happy?
Why don't you jump for joy and be glad?
If you just try it, I know you'll like it
And have the best time you've ever had
(You just gotta, you just gotta)
C'mon, yeah, c'mon, yeah, yeah
Why don't you jump for joy?
Why don't you jump for joy?
If you just try it, I'm sure you'll like it
And have the best time you ever had
Why don't you jump for joy?
Why don't you jump for joy?
If you just try it, I'm sure you'll like it
And have the best time you ever had
Why don't you jump for joy?
Why don't you jump for joy?
Try it, I'm sure you'll like it
And have the best time you ever had
Why don't you jump for joy?
Why don't you jump for joy?
Would you try it? I'm sure you'll like it?
And have the best time you ever had
C'mon, c'mon, yeah, yeah
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, baby
Yeah
Why don't you jump for joy? Yeah, yeah
