People all over the world are the same everywhere I go
I give in to this, I give in to that
Every day it bothers me so

Am I in a bad situation?
People taking me to the extreme
Am I being used?
I just need a clue
I don't know which way to go

So I took my problems to a doctor
So he could check it out (He don't know)
Took it to a palm reader
So she could read my hand (She don't know)
(Five minutes later) I started to understand
And I started screaming, and shouting, acting mad
No one could help me but myself
But I gave everything I had

It's things I do for you
In return do the same for me
It's things I do for you
In return do the same for me

Always wanting something for nothing
Especially what they don't deserve
Reaching in my pocket
I just got to stop it
Though they got a lot of nerve

Am I in a bad situation?
People taking me to the extreme
They don't use rejection
So I need protection
To keep my equity

So I took my problems to a doctor
So he could check it out (He don't know)
I took it to a palm reader
So she could read my hand (She don't know)
(Five minutes later) I started to understand
And I started screaming, and shouting, and acting mad
No one could help me but myself
But I gave everything I had

It's things I do for you
In return do the same for me
It's things I do for you
In return do the same for me
Take it over!

It's things I do for you
In return do the same for me
It's things I do for you
In return do the same for me

It's things I do for you
In return do the same for me
It's things I do for you
In return do the same for me

It's things I do for you
In return do the same for me
It's things I do for you
In return do the same for me

It's things I do for you
In return do the same for me
It's things I do for you
In return do the same for me
It's things I do for you
