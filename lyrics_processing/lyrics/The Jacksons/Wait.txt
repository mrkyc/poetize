How come you tell me that we have to get away?
But girl, you can't be found
We'll dine in Paris on the Champs-Elysees
Whenever you come around
There's been a breakdown, breakdown
Don't change your mind on me
Just take a little time
You say the finer things
Are worth waiting for
Just gimme some kinda sign, baby

I can't wait, wait for a hundred years
I can't hold back my tears any longer, longer
I can't wait, wait for a hundred years
I can't hold back my tears any longer, longer

Sometimes, I think of all the moments that we share
I've been waiting for so long
You know it hurts me
Every time you run and hide
I look up and now, you're gone
I've been put down, way down
There's no tomorrow for me
You can't let love just fade away, baby

I can't wait, wait for a hundred years
I can't hold back my tears any longer, longer
I can't wait, wait for a hundred years
I can't hold back my tears any longer

Girl, I've been longing for you deep inside
And I tell myself, baby, baby
If this love of ours will survive
Then let's take this chance together, together
Baby, you know

I just can't wait, wait for a hundred years
(I just can't wait)
I can't hold back my tears any longer, longer
I can't wait, wait for a hundred years
Can't hold back my tears any longer

Now, hear, you pushed my heart around
Tore me up inside, made me feel so bad
You took away my pride (My pride)

I can't wait, wait for a hundred years
I can't hold back my tears any longer
(I can't hold back my tears)
(Any longer)
I can't hold back my tears, baby
(Any longer)
Can't hold back my tears, darling
(Any longer)
I can't hold back my tears, baby
(Any longer)
Any longer
I can't wait
I'm down on my knees, baby
Baby, baby, baby
Don't talk to me, oh
Break down on my knees, baby
Must tell me
Can't help my soul
I can't help my soul, baby, baby
(Any longer)
Talk to me
(Any longer)
Break down on my knees, now, baby
(Any longer)
(Any longer)
Can't wait
(Any longer)
I can't wait
I can't wait
I can't wait
Wait, baby
I can't wait no more, now, baby
