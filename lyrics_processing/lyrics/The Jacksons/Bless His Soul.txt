I try to do what's right for me
But no one sees the way I see
And then I try to please them so
But, how far can this pleasing go?

Something's soon to come over you
You just can't please the world and yourself
You gotta start doing what's right for you
'Cause life is being happy yourself

Then you should bless his soul
It's hard to find a person like you, you're one of a kind
If I were you, I'd change my mind
And start living for me in these changing times

Sometimes I cry 'cause I'm confused
Is this a fact of being used?
There is no life for me at all
'Cause I give myself at beck and call

Something's soon to come over you
You just can't please the world and yourself
You gotta start doing what's right for you
'Cause life is being happy yourself

Then you should bless his soul
It's hard to find a person like you, you're one of a kind
If I were you, I'd change my mind
And start living for me in these changing times

The life you're leading is dangerous
It's so dangerous, dangerous
The life you're leading is dangerous
Doggone dangerous, dangerous, dangerous

Something's soon to come over you
You just can't please the world and yourself
You gotta start doing what's right for you
'Cause life is being happy yourself

Then you should bless his soul
It's hard to find a person like you, you're one of a kind
If I were you, I'd change my mind
And start living for me in these changing times
People will cry, if rain or sun
Try to please all and you've pleased none
