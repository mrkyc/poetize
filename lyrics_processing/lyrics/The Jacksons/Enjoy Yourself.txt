Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself
Enjoy yourself with me
Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself
Enjoy yourself with me
You better enjoy yourself
You better enjoy yourself

You sittin' over there, starin' into space
Awhile people are dancin', dancin' all over the place
But you shouldn't worry about things you can't control
Come on, girl, while the night is young
Why don't she let, let herself go "Woo!"

Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself
Enjoy yourself with me
Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself
Enjoy yourself with me

Let's have some fun
Let's have a good time, you and me
Sittin' there with your mouth poked out
Just as sweet as you can be
Why don't you live, live the life you got
Come on girl, let's get it, while the music's runnin' hot, woo!

Pretty girl, I've been watchin' you
I can wipe away that frown
Ah, you and I could get together
We could tear the house down, we could tear the house down
We could tear the whole house down, woo!

Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself
Enjoy yourself with me
Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself
Enjoy yourself with me
You better enjoy yourself
You got to enjoy yourself
