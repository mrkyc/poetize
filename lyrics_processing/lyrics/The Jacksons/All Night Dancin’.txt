I don't like it, baby
When you're stopping me on the floor
'Cause the more I keep on dancin'
The more I keep wanting some more

I don't care what you're saying
You're talking in my ear much too loud
And the music's taking my body
On a trip from nine to five
Keep me dancing
(All night)
Wanna keep me groovin'
(All night)
Rockin' and rollin'
(All night)
Ain't nobody's business
(All night) Woo!
I'm gonna dance up fire
I'm calling engine number 109
There ain't no chains to hold me
Gonna burn this place down till five
See The Jacksons LiveGet tickets as low as $90You might also likeAnd you can't stop this fever
'Cause my temperature's burning hot, hot
And all I want to do is dance, dance
Sweating from my face to my feet
Keep me dancing
(All night)
Gotta keep me movin'
(All night)
Ain't nobody's business but mine
(All night) Woo!
(All night)
Keep me groovin'
