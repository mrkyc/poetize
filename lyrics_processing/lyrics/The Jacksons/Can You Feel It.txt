Can you feel it, can you feel it, can you feel it

If you look around
The whole world's coming together now (Yeah)

Can you feel it, can you feel it, can you feel it

Feel it in the air
The wind is taking it everywhere (Yeah)

Can you feel it, can you feel it, can you feel it

All the colors of the world should be
Lovin' each other wholeheartedly
Yes, it's all right
Take my message to your brother and tell him twice
Spread the word and try to teach the man
Who's hating his brother when hate won't do
'Cause we're all the same
Yes, the blood inside of me is inside of you
Now, tell me

Can you feel it, tell me can you feel it (can you feel it), can you feel it
Can you see what's goin' down
Can you feel it in your bones
(Can you feel it, can you feel it)
Can you feel it
Yeah, yeah

Every breath you take
Is someone's death in another place
('nother place, 'nother place, nother place)
Every healthy smile
Is hunger and strife to another child
('nother child, 'nother child)
But the stars do shine
In promising salvation is near this time
(Near this time)
Can you feel it now
So brothers and sisters
Show we know how
Now, tell me

Can you feel it, tell me can you feel it, can you feel it
Papa, can you see what's goin down
(Can you feel it, can you feel it, can you feel it)
Open up your mind
All the children of the world should be
Loving each other wholeheartedly
Yes, it's all right
Take my message to your brother and tell him twice
Tell the news to the marching men
Who are killing their brothers when death won't do
'Cause we're all the same
Yes, the blood inside my veins is inside of you, now, tell me

Can you feel it, can you feel it, can you feel it (can you)
