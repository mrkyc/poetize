I'll give my all and all
To you and no other woman
Never will I let you down
Never will I do wrong
And I'll give my heart and soul
And hope that you will never let me go
Never had a woman so fine

And if I give my love completely
Will you love me in return?
And if it's in your heart, then show me
Then you'll never have to worry
'Cause I'll always be around

'Cause there ain't nothin', ooh
And I do mean nothin'
No, no, no, nothin' that compares to you
You're so fine that I'm scared of you
There ain't nothin', ooh
And I do mean nothin'
Ooh, nothin' that compares to you
You're so fine that I'm scared of you
