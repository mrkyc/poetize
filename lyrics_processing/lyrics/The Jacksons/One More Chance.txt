(Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello - hello-hello-hello)

Just remember everything I told you
Sorry for the pain that I have caused you
You'll know it's true, I wanna stay
I know you tried to make it what it should've been
You were there to help me when I couldn't have been
I don't know whatever came over me

Gimme that one more chance
Remember all that we've planned
Gimme that one more chance, for me
Gimme that one more chance
Remember all that we've planned
Gimme that one more chance, for me

I just wanna do half of what you do
And I know it seems so strange of me to say this
If there is a hundred ways to say it
All in one and it means "Don't go away"
Everybody's goin' 'round tellin' you lies
They don't know how hard that I've tried
You know it takes the pressure for me to see

Gimme that one more chance
Remember all that we've planned
Gimme that one more chance, for me
Gimme that one more chance
Remember all that we've planned
Gimme that one more chance, for me

If you could read my mind how wonderful it'd be
Love is hard to find, and what it means to me is so divine


Gimme that one more chance
Remember all that we've planned
Gimme that one more chance, for me
Gimme that one more chance
Remember all that we've planned
Gimme that one more chance, for me
Gimme that one more chance
(I wanna prove it)
Remember all that we've planned
(I know we can do this)
Gimme that one more chance, for me
Gimme that one more chance
(Love's my playground)
Remember all that we've planned
(Sorry I let you down)
Gimme one more chance, for me
Say you love me
Say you love me
I want you to say it, say it
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Tell me you love me
