It's a full moon, it's the weekend
Lookin' for a little fresh meat to sink your teeth in
Slow motion rollin' in like a wild wolf pack (Woo, woo)
Got a trust fund beard like Moses
Betcha gotta spend a lot to look that homeless
With your shaggy hair, don't care, thinkin' it's in the bag

I've seen this before
Couldn't be more
Not surprised (I ain't surprised, baby)
But sure, buy me a drink
Tell me what you think
Look deep in my eyes

Hey baby, let me guess
You've never felt this before
My beauty takes your breath
Boy, get that jaw off the floor
Ain't my first rodeo
I know the way this goes
Bow wow, baby, got a bone to pick
New dogs, old tricks
Ooh, put a leash on it
New dogs, old tricks

Got the same moves (Same moves)
It's the same game (Same game)
They were playboys back in the stone age
Carving promises they don't keep on the cave girls' walls

I've seen this before (Before)
Couldn't be more
Not impressed (I ain't impressed)
But sure (Sure), buy me a drink (Come on)
Tell me what you think, yeah

Hey baby, let me guess
You've never felt this before
My beauty takes your breath
Boy, get that jaw off the floor
Ain't my first rodeo
I know the way this goes
Bow wow, baby, got a bone to pick
New dogs, old tricks
Ooh, put a leash on it
