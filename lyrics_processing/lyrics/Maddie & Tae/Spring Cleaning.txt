I used to let you call me up in the middle of the night
You said your bed was gettin' cold and I lit your fire
Your steadiness was seldom, wearin' out your welcome
Ain't a smile and wave with this goodbye

So I'ma say "thank you" and let you go
Guess I took a little note from Marie Kondo

Ooh, you're takin' up space
It's time to tidy up and take you out my brain
Ooh, what do you see?
Cleanin' out the closet looks good on me
It ain't spring, but I'm cleanin' house
It ain't spring, but I'm cleanin' out
It ain't spring, but I'm cleanin' house
So come and get your shit out

Yeah, I dropped you like a habit and your unclaimed baggage
You can find it in the trash with the old me
Yeah, I'm feelin' like a queen in my king-sized bed
Now I know what minimal finally means
