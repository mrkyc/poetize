You're my North Star
You're my hideaway
You're my lighthouse shinin' in a hurricane
You're my best friend
You're my favorite thing
Changed my mind, change my heart, change my last name
Ain't it something that we both got something worth fightin' for
We know better than to worry 'bout whatever wolf's at the door

Come what may, babe, hell or high
If those stars fall from that sky
Let it all come crashin', I'll be runnin' to you the fastest
If these streets go up in flames
If everybody goes insane
I'll reach for you, you'll keep me safe
'Cause, baby, whatever happens

If the world goes mad
If it all goes bad
If the world goes mad
I'll love you through the madness
I'll love you through the madness, babe

We're gonna have days
That rock us to the core
But what don't kill us only gonna make me love you more
Ain't a gut punch
Ain't a single storm
We ain't ridin' out drinkin' on the front porch

Come what may, babe, hell or high
If those stars fall from that sky
Let it all come crashin', I'll be runnin' to you the fastest
If these streets go up in flames
If everybody goes insane
I'll reach for you, you'll keep me safe
'Cause, baby, whatever happens

If the world goes mad
If it all goes bad
If the world goes mad
I'll love you through the madness
Through the madness, baby

Ain't it something that we both got something worth fightin' for
We know better than to worry 'bout whatever wolf's at the door
Come what may, babe, hell or high
If those stars fall from that sky
Let it all come crashin', I'll be runnin' to you the fastest
If these streets go up in flames
If everybody goes insane
I'll reach for you, you'll keep me safe
'Cause, baby, whatever happens

If the world goes mad
If it all goes bad
If the world goes mad
If the world goes mad
If it all goes bad
If the world goes mad
I'll love you through the madness
