You'll know when she walks in
She's what the town's been talking about
She got that leather jacket locked in
Hot enough to burn a dive bar down

You can buy her a drink
You can tell her you think
She's got the prettiest eyes you've ever seen
But if you're gonna hold
Her heart made of gold
You should know she ain't the kind you can love and leave

That girl can make a grown man cry
Make him think he lost his mind
So before you let her go, you should know that
Her memory's gonna burn out slow, yeah
She's got a kiss that'll keep you up at night
Puts that look good in goodbye
So before you break her heart, think twice
'Cause girl can make a grown man cry
(Grown man cry, grown man cry)

You'll be a tear in your beer song
She'll be the one that got away
So boy, good luck trying to move on
Trying to put out that flame
'Cause every new girl you meet ain't ever gonna compete
That angel's gonna bring you down to your knees
