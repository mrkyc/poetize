Here comes the breakup
Here comes the falling out of in love
The kind that don't come with a make up
Yeah, we've seen it coming for a while
Boy, before you head out
There's just something I just need to get out
You ain't even gotta sit down
I'll say it all with a smile

I wish you nothing but the bluest of blue skies
All the wildflowers blooming on your road side
Every beer's a little colder than the last
Scratch the right ticket and get enough cash to
Get you riding up high in your dream truck
With a brand new girl that your momma loves
Wish you a life full of song, no static
I'd wish you the best, but you've already had it

It'll probably take a couple years
For you to see it all real clear
Everything standing right here
Is all you'll ever try to find
You might've broke my heart in two
But I still want the next best thing for you 'cause

Wish you a life full of song, no static
I'd wish you the best, but you've already had it

I'll take the high road now
You take the two lane out, oh yeah

I wish you nothing but the bluest of blue skies
All the wildflowers blooming on your road side
Every beer's a little colder than the last
Scratch the right ticket and get enough cash to
Get you riding up high in your dream truck
With a brand new girl that your momma loves
