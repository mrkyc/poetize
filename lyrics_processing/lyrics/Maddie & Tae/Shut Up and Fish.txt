Whew, alright

He pulled up in his red Corvette
Salmon shorts and a white V-neck
I said "Wow, you know how
To dress down for a city guy"

We headed out to a spot on the lake
A couple Zebcos and a cup full of bait
I could tell pretty fast he had more than just bass on his mind
Oh, I was fishin', he was wishin' we were kissin'
I was gettin' madder than a hornet in an old Coke can
Gettin' closer, slidin' over
Crowdin' up my castin' shoulder
Reachin' out to try to hold my reelin' hand
And sayin' I'm pretty, sayin' he's in love
And how it don't get any better than this
I said, yeah it could
Boy, if you would
Shut up and fish
Shut up and fish

For a little while he calmed down and let up
But then he went right back to pushing his luck
And that line of mine wasn't all I wanted to throw in
Oh no

I was fishin', he was wishin' we were kissin'
I was gettin' madder than a hornet in an old Coke can
Gettin' closer, slidin' over
Crowdin' up my castin' shoulder
Reachin' out to try to hold my reelin' hand
And saying I'm pretty, sayin' he's in love
And how it don't get any better than this
I said, yeah it could
Boy, if you would
Shut up and fish
Shut up and fish
Come on

I finally had all of him that I could take
So I gave him a cold shower in the lake
What can I say (Say)?

I was fishin', he was wishin' we were kissin'
I was gettin' madder than a hornet in an old Coke can
Gettin' closer, slidin' over
Playin' Captain Casanova
Reachin' out to try to hold my reelin' hand
And saying I'm pretty, sayin' he's in love
And how it don't get any better than this
I said, yeah it could
Boy, if you would
Shut up and fish
Just a little push
'Cause he couldn't just
Shut up and fish
