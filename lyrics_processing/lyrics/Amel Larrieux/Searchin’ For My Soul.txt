Once I was happy
Once I was alive
With the spirit of life's beauty
And a limit of the sky
Watching lives get taken
Made something in me die
Every day is a struggle for my spirit to survive
Somehow I lost the will to be
'Cause my soul simply crept outside of me

Somebody tell me where'd it go
(Searchin' for my soul)
Thought it was stayin' but now I don't
(Searchin' for my soul)
It left an empty space you know
(Searchin' for my soul)
If you should see it send it home
(Searchin' for my soul)

I tried to be strong but my strength is skin deep
If happiness is comin' I hope I have the vision to see
I'm so heavy-hearted
I've got Billie's blues
Lately I can't even bring myself to watch the news
Oh, I feel the weight of all the world
Is resting on the shoulders of this girl, mmm
You might also like
Somebody tell me where'd it go
(Searchin' for my soul)
Thought it was stayin' but now I don't
(Searchin' for my soul)
Well, it left an empty space you know
(Searchin' for my soul)
If you should see it send it home
(Searchin' for my soul)

Every time one of us goes down
It's like I'm looking at my own blood on the ground
Seems like everybody's lost their minds
And I just might be the next one in line

Somebody tell me where'd it go
(Searchin' for my soul)
Thought it was stayin' but now I don't
(Searchin' for my soul)
It left an empty space you know
(Searchin' for my soul)
And if you should see it send it home
(Searchin' for my soul)
