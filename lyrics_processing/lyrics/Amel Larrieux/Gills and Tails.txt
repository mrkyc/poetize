I looked at my reflection in the water
Thought, "What an unlikely pair"
Closed my eyes, held my breath, plummeted down, down, down
And anchored myself there

Can't tell how long I've been
In the company of gills and tails
I think I feel my skin
Growing scales

Can I come up for air?
(Can I come up? Can I come up?)
Can I come up for air?
(Can I come up? Can I come up?)
Can I come up for air?
(Can I come up? Can I come up?)
Can I, can I come up for air?
(Can I come up? Can I come up?)

I'm getting eaten up down here
I'm just not built like that (That)
The big fish have a monopoly
The little fish get buried in the sand
You might also like
This sea world I'm in
Sucks your life out, leaving you comatose
Take back your salt and fins
Send me a lifeboat

Can I come up for air?
(Can I come up? Can I come up?)
Can I come up for air?
(Can I come up? Can I come up?)
Can I come up for air?
(Can I come up? Can I come up?)
Can I come up for air?
(Can I come up? Can I come up?)

I look up with longing at the surface
Hypnotized by the way the sunlight seems to ride each ripple
And they do a dance
Every ray becomes a beckoning hand
I miss the sweet taste of oxygen
I mistook this for the promised land

Can I come up for air?
(Can I come up? Can I come up?)
Can I come up for air?
(Can I come up? Can I come up?)
Can I come up for air?
(Can I come up? Can I come up?)
Air, air
(Can I come up? Can I come up?)
Can I, can I come up?
(Can I come up? Can I come up?)
I, I
(Can I come up? Can I come up?)
I, I, I, I
(Can I come up? Can I come up?)
I
