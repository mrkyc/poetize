I dream of you nights
And daytime too
Like someone slipped me something
And that something's you
Almost walked into a wall
Imagining your embrace
Had to snap myself out of
The thought of your lips
And their heavenly taste

And the sensation is real
The blood rushes into
Each place as if you were here
Elevating me to
Closed-eye elation
Heartbeat is racing
This evocation

Got me afraid of
The rapture stirring inside of me
Got me afraid of
What I'm gonna do if I get you to see
Got me afraid of you
So fine sometimes, I forget to breathe
Got me afraid that
Wherever you are is wherever I have to be
You might also like
Faces are fading
Replaced with yours
Bodies are changing
Into your beautiful form
Oh, to feel your pulse
Beating inside mine
Want you to press against me
Like if you don't, you'll die

And the sensation is real
The blood rushes into
Each place as if you were here
Elevating me to
Closed-eye elation
Heartbeat is racing
This evocation

Got me afraid of
The rapture stirring inside of me
Got me afraid of
What I'm gonna do if I get you to see
Got me afraid of you
So fine sometimes, I forget to breathe
Got me afraid that
Wherever you are is wherever I have to be
You must be kin to the moon
'Cause when you're up and out and full
I could be anywhere and feel a pull
Whispering to my ocean
You're cool enough to flow in
Into my spine

And this is why I am afraid
The rapture stirring inside of me
Got me afraid of
What I'm gonna do if I get you to see
Got me afraid of you
So fine sometimes, I forget to breathe
Got me afraid that
