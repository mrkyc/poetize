I made some decisions
Detrimental to my life
Put my trust in some translucent people
But now I see through them just fine
I've come back to the real world
And I put my bitterness behind
'Cause revenge is not as sweet as my freedom
And no one's taking mine

Promises broken
With endless waiting
Been so many mountains
I've had to climb
I got this feeling
Something is waiting
My destiny's changing
I'm about to shine

Experience has taught me
What I need to take me far
See, I can mingle with my enemies
'Cause now I know who they are
I'm stronger than I've ever been
Got to be to survive
There's a test around the corner trying to bring me down
But I'll never make the same mistake twice

Promises broken
With endless waiting
Been so many mountains
I've had to climb
I got this feeling
Something is waiting
My destiny's changing
I'm about to shine

Oh, shine
Oh, shine
Oh, shine
Oh, shine

Promises broken
With endless waiting
Been so many mountains
I've had to climb
I got this feeling
Something is waiting
My destiny's changing
I'm about to shine
(I'm about to shine)
Promises broken
