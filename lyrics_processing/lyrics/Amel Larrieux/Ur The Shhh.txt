To be said without subtlety
Gone are my normal charms
You disarm the poet in me
And a rapturous wave
Travels through me
Sending all my good sense south
I begin to behave
Like a star struck groupie
And the words escape my mouth
You're the shh
I been over it
Never seen another like you in my life
You're the shh
I been over it
And I wouldn't swear if I wasn't right
The other adjectives
Seem illegitimate
In reference to yourself
Forgive my un-inventiveness
I'm just too impressed
To come up with something else

And the words escape my mouth
You're the shh
I been over it
Never seen another like you in my life
You're the shh
I been over it
And I wouldn't swear if I wasn't right
Lost on me ar-ti-cu-la-tion
Tongue tied with pure a-dor-a-tion
And risk offense with this na-rra-tion
But it's all because
You're the shh
I been over it
Never seen another like you in my life
You're the shh
I been over it
And I wouldn't swear if I wasn't right

I'm gonna stay in town a little longer

A little longer (longer)
Than a rebound (bound-bound-bound-bound-bound-bound)
Before is not a word it's just a sound
After you my past
Faded into the background
(after you my past faded into the)
My heart don't beat
It pounds
And I think, I think
My life begins right now (right now)
And I think, I think
My life begins right now (now)
And I think, I think
My life begins right now
