If ever you awake and find your inner light is gray
May I suggest a simple remedy to make your day?
Open up your windows and then open wide your eyes
Let your vision feast upon the golden yellow sunrise
You might be aching 'cause the one you love is far away
Thinking it's impossible to make it through another day
You can feel better, take it from me
Just look at the colors of the falling autumn leaves
Let them put you at ease

As long as we have the weather
The dark skies that bind us will send the clear day to remind us
As long as we have the weather
The sunlight will guide us and the rainbows will surely find us

God created changing seasons not in vain
The beauty of the weather's here for some distraction from our pain
Let a warm summer's night romance you
Let a winter's snow fall entrance you
You don't have to pay nothing to take in the view

Let the winter winds blow your pain away
Let the blue sky be your secret getaway
I got the antidote to keep you cool
You should loosen up because nature has no rules

Let the winter winds blow your pain away
Let the blue sky be your secret getaway
I got the antidote to keep you cool
You should loosen up because you know that nature has no rules

As long as we have the weather
The dark skies that bind us will send the clear day to remind us
Oh, whoa whoa whoa, oh whoa
The sunlight will guide us and the rainbows will surely surely find us
As long as we have the weather
The dark skies that bind us will send the clear day to remind us, yeah yeah
As long as we have the weather
The sunlight will guide us away
