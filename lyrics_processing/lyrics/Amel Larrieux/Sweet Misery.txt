I wish I didn't feel it
I know it just ain't right
But it seems to pop up in my head
Morning, noon, and night
I just can't release it
The memory of you
Momma never told me
Love would leave me so damn blue

And I got misery
'Cause I know loving you's a sin
You got me on my knees
Praying that I don't give in
And baby, you and me
Never ever could have been
So I got misery
'Cause I'll love you 'til the end

You said that you loved me
That I'm your only one
But what you call monogamy
Is lying to everyone
Well, I gave you your freedom
But that's not the end of that
You reached in and stole my heart
And now I want it back
You might also like
And I got misery
'Cause I know loving you's a sin
You got me on my knees
Praying that I don't give in
Baby, you and me
Never ever could have been
So I got misery
'Cause I'll love you 'til the end

I'm so blue (I'm so blue)
Can't let go of you (Can't let go of you)
I'm so blue (I'm so blue)
Can't stop loving you (And I can't stop loving you)
I'm so blue (I'm so blue)
Can't let go of you (I can't let go of you)
You give me sweet misery

And I got misery
'Cause I know loving you's a sin
You got me on my knees
Praying that I don't give in
Baby, you and me
Never ever ever could have been
So I got misery
'Cause I'll love you 'til the end
I'll love you 'til the end
Oh, I know loving you's a sin
You got me, you got me on my knees
Praying that I don't give in
Baby, you and me never ever could have been
So I got misery
Oh, I've got it bad, I got it bad
I've got it so darn bad, so darn bad, baby
Praying that I don't give in, baby
You and me, we never ever could have been
So I got misery 'cause I'll love you 'til the end
Ah babe, oh babe, ah babe, ooh wee, baby
Ah ya ya ya ya ya, ah baby
Sweet misery, sweet misery, sweet misery
I got some sweet, sweet misery
Misery
Misery
