I watch your lips moving
I see the words taking shape
But love's like a language
I cannot translate
I can't afford to be careless
And let you in
I turn my head for one minute
And lose everything

Wish I had someone on whom I could lean
'Cause everybody's always counting on me

With my hands held real tight
Always ready to fight
For the few pieces of joy I have now
You have turned on a light
And I've lost my sight
But my heart still remembers the sound
Of a dream of a love one day found
Of a dream of a love one day found
So don't let me down

Your past it may be rocky
But your present is clear
My present situation
Is the sum of all my fears
I take responsibility for the few things I done right
But I got so much on my plate
I'm scared to take another bite
You might also like
Wish I had someone on whom I could lean
Still I don't want no one's charity

With my hands held real tight
Always ready to fight
For the few pieces of joy I have now
You have turned on a light
And I've lost my sight
But my heart still remembers the sound
Of a dream of a love one day found

Heartbreak and bullets can try
To steal any good from my life
Fathers and lovers have lied
Rivers have flowed from my eyes
Never seen love face to face
Just seen it walking away
Why would you think I would recognize
Something that's never been mine

You have turned on a light
And I've lost my sight
But my heart still remembers the sound
Of a dream of a love one day found
You're the dream of a love one day found
And the freedom from what kept me bound
And a promise of staying around
My eyes may not work for me now
But my heart sure remembers the sound
(Remembers)
So if you're saying it, please say it loud
