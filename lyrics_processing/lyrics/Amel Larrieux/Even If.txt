Never thought I would
Find the words that could
Stand up through any weather
Something I could say
You could hear today
But stay with you forever

Just when I was losing my faith
And I was losing my way
It came to me as clear as day

Even if I wake up and find I'm alone
'Cause the whole world's turned to stone
And my God says, "It's time I take you home"
I'll be happy going knowing that I loved you

Innocent and mild
You must be heaven's child
Sent to make me believe (Make me believe)
On my darkest night all you have to do is smile
And you breathe new life into me
You might also like
Just when I was losing my faith
And losing my way (Losing my way)
You came to me as clear as day

Even if I wake up and find I'm alone
'Cause the whole world's turned to stone
And my God says, "It's time I take you home"
I'll be happy going knowing that I loved you

There'll be a time
When I'm gonna have to leave this sweet place behind
(Leave it behind)
But baby before I go
I gotta make sure you know
About the joy that you bring to my life

Even if I wake up and find I'm alone
'Cause the whole world's turned to stone
And my God says, "It's time I take you home"
I'll be happy going knowing that I loved you
Even if I wake up and find I'm alone
'Cause the whole world's turned to stone
And my God says, "It's time I take you home"
I'll be happy going knowing that I loved you
I'll be happy going knowing that I loved you
I'll be happy going knowing that I loved you
I'll be happy going knowing that I loved you
I, I, loved you
I, I, loved you (Knowing that I loved you)
