Oh, his life has just begun
Got a temper like a gun
Pointing it at everyone
That's his game
And it helps him to get through the day
But a voice inside him says
How much longer can I play?

He's got infinite possibilities, I can see them now
It's the unbroken chains of his past by which he's bound
He's got infinite possibilities
I can feel them now
If he chooses well, then nothing can tear him down

Peace of mind
Is not easy for him to find
And he's walking a thinner line
In a place where another man is keeping his time
Though he's young
He's not like everyone
He sees what he's become
And he'd rather be standing in the sun
You might also like
He's got infinite possibilities, I can see them now
(I can see them now)
It's the unbroken chains of his past by which he's bound
(By which he's bound)
He's got infinite possibilities, I can feel them now
(I can feel them now)
If he chooses well, then nothing can tear him down


He's got infinite possibilities, I can see them now
(I can see them now)
It's the unbroken chains of his past by which he's bound
(By which he's bound)
He's got infinite possibilities, I can feel them now
(I can feel them now)
If he chooses well, then nothing can tear him down
He's got infinite possibilities, I can see them now
(I can see them now)
It's the unbroken chains of his past by which he's bound
(By which he's bound)
He's got infinite possibilities, I can feel them now
(I can feel them now)
If he chooses well, then nothing can tear him down
Infinitie, infinite possibilities
In-, in-, infinite possibilities
Infinite possibilities
Infinite possibilities, infinite possibilities
Infinite possibilities, infinitie
Oh, infinite possibilities, infinite possibilities
Infinite (Infinite)
Infinite possibilities
Infinite possibilities
