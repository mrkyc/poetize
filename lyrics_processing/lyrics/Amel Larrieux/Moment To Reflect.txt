He had a thought
He couldn't keep it to himself
Though he ought
He spread it 'round knowing that
Mouths would run like water
And turn it into fact
This is how wars begin
This is how bombs start droppin'
If it begins with stopping I will, I will
Before I say something I regret I
Need a moment to reflect I'd
Like to keep my foot out of my mouth
And not be speakin' out my neck
And not say it just to be sayin' it
I got a butterfly net
In which my thoughts I collect
Puttin' the head and heart to the test to come with something better
If a thought is an opinion
To the truth it has no relation
But many mouths want attention
Intoxicated by the feelin of getting some

This is how hearts get broken
If it begins with stopping I will, I will
Before I say something I regret I
Need a moment to reflect I'd
Like to keep my foot out of my mouth
And not be speakin' out my neck
And not say it just to be sayin' it
I got a butterfly net
In which my thoughts I collect
Puttin' the head and heart to the test to come with something better
When the tongues start waggin'
Yeah yeah
It burns fire like dragon
Yeah yeah
I don't want to be havin'
That on my conscience, no
I remember, I remember
Said the mother, to the daughter
"If you don't have nothin' nice to say then don't say nothing at all"
Before I say something I regret I
Need a moment to reflect I'd
Like to keep my foot out of my mouth
And not be speakin' out my neck
And not say it just to be sayin' it
I got a butterfly net
In which my thoughts I collect
Puttin' the head and heart to the test to come with something better
To come with something better, to come with something better
To come with something better, to come with something better
To reflect
Puttin' the head and heart to the test to come with something better
