Feeling like it's all been pointless
I keep holding on
Every day's an uphill battle
I believe I'm the one

Everybody says
It's no good for me
But I don't care what they say
'Cause you're everything that I can need

I can't give it up, can put it down
My friends say that I'm not around
Can't give it up no matter what I do
You know I got to see it through

I'd give it up but it would break my heart
Rather die than be apart
Can't give it up, can't give it up
Can't give it up, I can't give it up

Spent my day
I can't give
Spent my day
I can't give

Spent my days without you
I can't live without you
Spent my days without you
I can't live without you
Spent my day
I can't give (It up)

I can't give you up
I can't give you up, give you up, give you up
