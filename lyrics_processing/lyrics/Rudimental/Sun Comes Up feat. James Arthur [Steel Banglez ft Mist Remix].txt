Ahh
I got pain in my brain in my skull cap
Might tu vince  to get a sun tan
Same prayers to the sky where my mums at
Treat the music like I trap
I get funds up
Labbin' all night till the suns up (ohhhwhoa)
I treat the riddim like a op its gettin fucked up
Never say never agin cos' its bad luck
Never say never agin cos' its bad luck
Im tryna purify my system where the water at
Stress with the BM got me thinkin' where my daughter at
Might do music
Coulda been a baller ack
Its minor
Still hit rays give autographs
Nah
I don't wanna lose it
Had Ps for the strap before the music
Had me runnin in gaffs like I'm lootin'
The sun shines through the rain now I'm movin'

I wonder, maybe they'd never find me
I've been waitin' such a long, long, long time to feel it
Swallowed by the waters around me
Though I took so many wrong, wrong, wrong turns to see it, woah
See Rudimental LiveGet tickets as low as $32
But I dance through the blisters at night
And I laughed 'til I cried and cried and
I ran 'til my feet couldn't run no more
And I sat 'til my lungs were burnin'
'Til I know I'm alive, alive, yeah
I'll sit 'til I can't hear words no more

Suddenly the sun goes up
And I feel my love floodin' back again, yeah
Until the sun goes up
And I feel my love comin' up again

It wasn't easy tryin' to run with these handcuffs
I had to sleep through such a cold, cold, cold night to see it
Green flashes hit me right where I'm standing
Sunlight cut into your bones, bones, bones, started to heal it

But I dance through the blisters at night
And I laughed 'til I cried and cried and
I ran 'til my feet couldn't run no more
And I sat 'til my lungs were burnin'
'Til I know I'm alive, alive, yeah
I'll sit 'til I can't hear words no more
Suddenly the sun goes up
And I feel my love floodin' back again, yeah
Until the sun goes up
And I feel my love comin' up again

Won't you give it
Give a little love back
Won't you give it
Turn your light on me
Give a little
To get a little love
