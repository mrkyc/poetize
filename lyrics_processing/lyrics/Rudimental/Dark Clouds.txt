Take it back
Didn't feel, did nothing wrong
Take it
Didn't feel, did nothing wrong
Let me go, we'd be alone
Let me go, we'd be alone

Thanks for calling to let me know
That your heart's not in it and you're letting me go
The way you've been here before and it didn't work, didn't work
Don't tell me again that it's not enough, not enough, not enough

Rewind those moments again
Of when you felt at ease in my home
Take it back to the day
Of when it didn't feel, didn't feel wrong
Rewind those moments again
Of when you felt at ease in my home
Take it back to the day, back to the day

I can feel the cold wind calling my name
See those black clouds raining on me
All for a reason, now I know you did wrong
So, I just ha-ha-ha-ha-had to let you go
