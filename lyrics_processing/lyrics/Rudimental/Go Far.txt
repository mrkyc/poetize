Every day is a blessing
The sun shines for you and me
I've got a feeling to make something
Something that you've never seen yeah

So many places to go and faces to see
I'm offering my hand now, won't you come with me?
Cause we can go far, all the way around the world
Spreading love to all the boys and girls

We can go far, all the way around the world
Spreading love to all the boys and girls
We can go far, go far, go far
Spread love, spread love, spread love

I see trouble in the distance
Tell me, can you see it too?
I'm gonna have to build an army
Where we're spreading love and only truth
