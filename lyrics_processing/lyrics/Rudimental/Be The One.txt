Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

Every time you show up, yeah
Always on glow up, yeah
I really shouldn't go back there
Always say no, but yeah
You could never love me how I love me
I will never trust you, trust me
It was just you, never just me
You're lucky I don't do you how you done me

You know mine's never-ending
You're with me, you're protected
One more time, no pretending
You've got me moving restless
You say you love me, but you know that's just words (Just words)
Say it's real, but I still just curve (Just curve)
You want another chance, you know you got nerve (Got nerve)
I'm priceless, now I know my worth

Now you wanna be mine, you can't be
Hours after midnight, you call me
Now you're gonna tell me you're sorry
I don't even feel like you're ready
Now you wanna be mine, you can't be
Hours after midnight, you call me
Now you're gonna tell me you're sorry
I don't even feel like you're ready

It's crazy how we can't go back
We tried, but we can't go back
Too much been said, too much been done
Another time won't run and even I know that
I could never love you how you love me
That's why I don't judge you when you judge me
Whatever hurts you, that hurts me
It's all me, I never said it weren't me

You know mine's never-ending
You're with me, you're protected
One more time, no pretending
You've got me moving restless

This the AJ flow, but it's mine now (Bro)
I can't lie though, I kinda miss ride-outs (I do)
Used to go back to hers for the hideouts (I did)
Weren't tryna see Thameside or High Down
My town, get down or lie down (Down)
I'm the king, where's my crown? (Crown)
Where's the ting? I'll fly 'round
Corn run with the wind, bring the bine out
Real-ass crip, I'll never be slime (Be slime)
She my, she wanna be mine (Be mine)
You can't give that free time
Young boy livin' out by the seaside
OT, OT, we really don't tick like my Rollie
When they need grub, they really phone me
When I was up there, didn't wanna know me
Now you wanna be mine, you can't be
Hours after midnight, you call me
Now you're gonna tell me you're sorry
I don't even feel like you're ready
Now you wanna be mine, you can't be
