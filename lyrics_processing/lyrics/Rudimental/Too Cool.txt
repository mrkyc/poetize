Walking down streets I've been before
Bright lights, big city, gotta take it all
When all I gotta do is walk away
Then I know I'll feel better

You're too cool to love me, you're too cool to love me back
You're too cool to love me, you're too cool to love me back
You're too cool to love me, you're too cool to love me back
You're too cool to love me, but it's cool I don't need that
I don't need that, I don't need that
You said before I don't need that, I don't need that

Always find it hard to understand
Sometimes things don't go to plan
When all I gotta do is walk away
Then I know I'll feel better

You're too cool to love me, you're too cool to love me back
You're too cool to love me, you're too cool to love me back
You're too cool to love me, you're too cool to love me back
You're too cool to love me, but it's cool I don't need that
I don't need that, I don't need that
You said before I don't need that, I don't need that
