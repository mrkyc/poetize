I can see it in your eyes
You're locking out your mind
You wanna turn around and run
I wanna say this every time
When I'm wavey from the wine
But I always bite my tongue

I know you been through some shit
What's love got to do with it?
It's okay, we've all been hurt before
You tell me, "That's the lesson learned"
You played with fire, you got burned
You got burned, yeah, you got burned

Don't be scared of love
Baby, you got some bruises like the rest of us
I got you, I got you
Don't be scared of love
Maybe you got some bruises, but when it gets too tough
I got you, I got you

Don't be scared
Don't be scared of love
Don't be scared of love
Don't be scared
Don't be scared
