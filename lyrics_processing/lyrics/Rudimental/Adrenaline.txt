I got it bad for you, a bad heart
I'm falling back to your arms like waves on a pebbled shore
I'm 'bout to give in, my brain shuts down
And then it hit me like a thunderstorm
I can't see what I fell hard for

I gotta go, feel it running through my veins
And I can't stop it right now
Just stay up late to hear my voice through your phone
Caught in the night roaming through the streets now
Feeling so damn good, yeah
Open my mind, everything is possible now

I feel strong on my own
'Cause I'm high on this adrenaline
Oh, of my love, my love, my love, my love
I feel strong on my own
'Cause I'm high on this adrenaline
Oh, of my love, my love, my love, my love

Oh, of my love, my love, my love, my love
Oh, of my love, my love, my love, my love

Gasoline to my burning fire
Getting better every minute
Let the rhythm take, take control
And in this dance I see it clear
Overflow of the waves pulling out from the pebbled shore

I gotta go, feel it running through my veins
And I can't stop it right now
Just stay up late to hear my voice through your phone
Caught in the night roaming through the streets now
Feeling so damn good, yeah
Open my mind, everything is possible now

I feel strong on my own
'Cause I'm high on this adrenaline
Oh, of my love, my love, my love, my love
I feel strong on my own
'Cause I'm high on this adrenaline
Oh, of my love, my love, my love, my love

Oh, of my love, my love, my love, my love
Oh, of my love, my love, my love, my love
