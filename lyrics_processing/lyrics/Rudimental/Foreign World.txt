You just wanna see my look inside
You just wanna talk to me and say what I like
Baby hold on, take me on a ride
I don't need promises, just get close like a dance

Love just give it to me
Go on and suck it to me
Lover give it to me
Go on don't stop it for me

Fuck it 'til the night comes down
Feel it baby, soul to soul
I got you where I want you now
And I just can't stop to let you go
In a foreign world, dancing foreign ways
Baby we find ourselves
In a foreign world, you can find yourself baby
Find yourself baby, find yourself baby

You plus me were written in the stars
Picture perfect cause you move the way that I like
Take my closer to your other side
Be your oxygen, I'll be your one and only
