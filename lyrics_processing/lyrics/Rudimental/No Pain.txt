We don't need no pain
So wash them tears away
And though we bleed the same (Ooh, yeah)
So, now, wash them tears away
Said, we don't need no pain

Seven steps to heaven, but you're trippin' on the first one
Mama bawl out when the bullet hit her first son
Tired of this world, think we need another version
Too many bombs and military incursions
This is our prayer for the ones that been muted
Deaf to our cryin', can't fix it with no Q-Tip
Everybody choosin' desires over beauty
Evil is bloomin' and money's where it's rooted
So spread your wings and get ready to fly
To a place where pain is just a memory, yeah
Said it's no biggie and I'm ready to die
The grave digger have them space in the cemetery
So just listen to me properly when me a tell you this
Get it in your head, say them system set up fi prejudice
When we warrin', the rich man seek the benefit
Them no business 'bout the blood when we're sheddin' it

We don't need no pain
So wash them tears away
And though we bleed the same
So, now, wash them tears away

Father, I'm still sorry
Sorry I ain't on and off
All that I see is war here
There's bombs where the kids are growin' up
Bullets keep you awake
She couldn't wash out the stains, oh, Lord
There's blood on the leaves again
And if only I was never changed
And father, we're still hungry
Starvin' with no clear way out
All that I see's money
The money don't hear you callin' out
Bullets keep you awake
She couldn't wash out the stains, oh, Lord (Oh-oh-oh)
Pray your wings take you away

Said we don't need no pain (No pain)
So wash them tears away (Away)
And though we bleed the same
So, now, wash them tears away (Away, away)
Said we don't need no pain

Ninety-nine problems, L is not an option
Heart got colder, goose came custom
Wolf, sheep clothin', still can't trust 'em
Who fell, Grenfell, what that cost 'em?
They said change was gon' come (Huh?)
Change for who? Change for why?
Been worked hard, I've had enough now
I need none of this here when I touch down
Youngers wilding, death toll rising
Young, them violent, no surprise when
Youth club shut down, funding cut down
Police cut down, who helps us now?
They can never penetrate the passion
Or the pedigree
Thick skin, that gon' get me smilin'
Through the jealousy
Distance, took the longer road
'Cause I was meant for this
Well, we don't need no pain (We don't need no pain, no)
So wash them tears away (We don't need no pain, no)
And though we bleed the same
