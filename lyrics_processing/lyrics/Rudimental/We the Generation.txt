(Riff it down, Riff it down, make make it flesh)
(Riff it down, Riff it down, make make it flesh)

Lately I've been out of luck
Seems like I'm not good enough
Maybe life's just really tough
Like a diamond in the rough

I can see more clearly now (Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah)
I need you to trust me now (oh oh oh, oh oh oh)
I want you to hear me out, yeah (Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah)
All I'll do is scream and shout (oh oh oh, oh oh oh)

(Riff it down, Riff it down, make make it flesh)
We the generation and we have had enough
(Riff it down, Riff it down, make make it flesh)
We the generation and we have had enough
(Riff it down, Riff it down, make make it flesh)
We the generation and we have had enough, oh
(Riff it down, Riff it down, make make it flesh)
We the generation and we have had enough
See Rudimental LiveGet tickets as low as $32
Bet you think this is the end
We don't wanna play pretend, No
Because you'll make my stakes again
We'll put up our best defense

I can see more clearly now (Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah)
I need you to trust me now (oh oh oh, oh oh oh)
I want you to hear me out, yeah (Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah)
All I'll do is scream and shout (oh oh oh,oh oh oh)
