I wake again
You got me up to my old ways again
You know I be saving first place for him
You give me the feeling I want, uh
So safe with him
Baby got me feeling so safe again
Baby I can never feel the same again
When you do the thing that I want

I have got to be honest
See you there and I want it
Hold my body boy, pull me close
One by one
You have taken me higher
We got no Bic or no lighter
Think I'm ready, I'm letting go

One by one, two by two
My walls come falling down
One by one, two by two
Was lost and now I'm found
Wasn't looking, wasn't searching
You came without a sound
One by one, two by two
My walls come falling down
So let 'em fall
One by one, two by two
My walls come falling down
So let 'em fall
Let 'em fall, let 'em fall
One by one, two by two
My walls come falling down
So let 'em fall down

You're feelin' some type of way again
And I don't know what to say again

If I'm out in the night time crawlin' now
You're the only one I'm lovin' now

Pickin' up when I call you
You're bailing off the line right now
Talk to me when I'm feelin' low
Feel like I can take you higher right now, now
Tell me now if you're all in
Me runnin' through your mind right now, now
'Cause if you think then I need to know
Na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na
