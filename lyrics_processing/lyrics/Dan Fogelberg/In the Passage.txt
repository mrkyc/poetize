There's a ring around the moon tonight
And a chill in the air
And a fire in the stars that hang
So near, so near

There's a sound in the wind that blows
Through the wild mountain holds
Like the sighs of a thousand crying souls
Crying souls

There's a time when the traveler
Is fated to find
That insight has turned his gaze
Behind, behind

And the steps taken yesterday
Will beckon again
And lead to his weary journey's end
His journey's end

And in the passage from the cradle to the grave
We are born, madly dancing
Rushing headlong through the crashing of the days
We run on and on without a backwards glance
We run on and on without a backwards glance
You might also like
I cast my fate with the wife of Lot, I turned my gaze around
Knowing neither what I sought nor what was to be found
Heeding weakness, feeding strength, oh, life at length is frail
I seek again the river's source through time's dark shadowed veil


In the fast fading century
As we spin through the years
I pray that our failing vision clears
Our vision clears

And in the passage from the cradle to the grave
We are born, madly dancing
Rushing headlong through the crashing of the days
We run on and on without a backwards glance
We run on and on without a backwards glance

The places dash and the faces dart like fishes in a dream
Hiding 'neath the murky banks of long forgotten streams
The lines of life are never long when seen from end to end
The future's never coming and the past has never been
There's a ring around the moon tonight
And a chill in the air
And a fire in the stars that hang
