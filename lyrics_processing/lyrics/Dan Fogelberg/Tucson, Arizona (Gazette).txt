Rising in the heat like a mirage
Tony keeps his Chevy
Like a virgin locked in his garage
He brings it out at midnight
And cruises down the empty boulevards
And he prowls the darkened alleys
That snake between the city's thirsty yards
The lonely desert skies reflect the anger in his eyes
And it is dawn
His father died of drinking
And left five children sinking with his mom
His older brother Bobby
Never made it back from Vietnam
With high school well behind him
He lives at home and works this shitty job
And he thinks his '60 Chevy
Is the only true amigo that he's got
His heart is filled with sadness
And his soul is like some ugly vacant lot
Mary Estelle Hanna
Came out from Louisiana for the sun
A deal gone bad in Dallas
Left her burned and broke and on the run
To make the rent and groceries
She takes this job at $3.15 an hour
Serving shots of whiskey and tequila
In some smoky redneck bar
And she dreams some day she'll make her way to L.A
And become a movie star
You might also likeTony saw her working
He swallowed hard and asked her for a date
Mary laughed and answered
"I would, but every night I'm working late."
He said he had some cocaine
That she could have if she'd just ride along
She said, "What the hell? I may a well
I haven't had no fun in so damn long."
He picked her up at closing time
They pulled out on the road and they were gone
Tony's mom got frantic
When she found her son had not come home
Mary's roommate panicked
And called the sheriff from a public phone
They asked her lots of questions
She tried her best to tell them what she saw
And late that night
They found poor Mary
Lying in some narrow dusty draw
And the coroner reported
That she hadn't been deceased for very long
Two weeks on they found it
Buried to the windshield in the sand
There inside lay Tony
With a small revolver in his hand
The papers simply stated
It must have been the drugs that drove him mad
The neighbors speculated:
What could make a good boy go so bad?
Well, it might have been
The desert heat
