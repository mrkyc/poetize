You whispered that you were getting tired
Got a look in your eye
Looks a lot like goodbye
Hold on to your secrets tonight
Don't want to know
I'm okay with this silence
This truth that I don't want to hear

You're hiding regret in your smile
There's a storm in your eyes
I've seen coming for a while
Hang on to the past tense tonight

Don't say a word
I'm okay with the quiet
The truth is gonna change everything

So lie to me and tell me that it's gonna be alright
So lie to me and tell me that we'll make it through the night
I don't mind if you wait before you tear me apart
But look me in the eye
And lie, lie, lie
Lie, lie, lie
You might also like
Oh, I know that there's no turning back
If we put too much light on this
We'll see through the cracks
Let's stay in the dark one more night

Don't want to know
I'm okay with this silence
This truth that I don't want to hear

So lie to me and tell me that it's gonna be alright
So lie to me and tell me that we'll make it through the night
I don't mind if you wait before you tear me apart
So look me in the eye
And lie, lie, lie

Don't want to believe in this ending
Let the cameras roll on, keep pretending
Tomorrow's all wrong if you walk away
Just stay

So lie to me and tell me that it's gonna be alright
So lie to me and tell me that we'll make it through the night
I don't mind if you wait before you tear me apart
So look me in the eye
And lie, lie, lie
So lie to me and tell me that we're gonna be okay
So lie to me and tell me that we'll make it through the day
I don't mind if you wait before you tear me apart
So look me in the eye
