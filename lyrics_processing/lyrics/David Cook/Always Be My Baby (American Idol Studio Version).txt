We were as one, babe
For a moment in time
And it seemed everlasting
That you would always be mine
Now you want to be free, yeah
So I'm letting you fly
'Cause I know in my heart, babe
Our love will never die, no

You'll always be a part of me
I'm a part of you indefinitely
Girl, don't you know you can't escape me
Ooh, darling 'cause you'll always be my baby
And we'll linger on
Time can't erase a feeling this strong
No way you're never gonna shake me
Ooh, darling 'cause you'll always be my baby

I ain't gonna cry no
And I won't beg you to stay
If you're determined to leave, girl
I will not stand in your way
But inevitably you'll be back again
'Cause you know in your heart, babe
Our love will never end, no
You might also like
You'll always be a part of me
I'm a part of you indefinitely
Girl, don't you know you can't escape me
Ooh, darling 'cause you'll always be my baby
And we'll linger on
Time can't erase a feeling this strong
No way you're never gonna shake me
Ooh, darling 'cause you'll always be my baby

I know that you'll be back, girl
When your days and your nights get a little bit colder, ohh
I know that you'll be right back, babe
Oh, baby believe me it's only a matter of time

You'll always be a part of me
I'm a part of you indefinitely
Girl, don't you know you can't escape me
Ooh, darling 'cause you'll always be my baby
And we'll linger on
Time can't erase a feeling this strong
No way you're never gonna shake me
Ooh, darling 'cause you'll always be my, my baby, yeah
You'll always be a part of me (You will always, yeah)
I'm a part of you indefinitely
Girl, don't you know you can't escape me
Ooh, darling 'cause you'll always be my baby
And we'll linger on (We will linger on)
Time can't erase a feeling this strong
No way you're never gonna shake me
Ooh, darling 'cause you'll always be my baby
