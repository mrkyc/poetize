Never really said too much
Afraid it wouldn't be enough
Just try to keep my spirits up when there's no point in grievin'
Doesn't matter anyway
Words could never make me stay
Words will never take my place when you know I'm leavin'

Try to leave a light on when I'm gone
Something I rely on to get home
One I can feel at night, a naked light
A fire to keep me warm
Try to leave a light on when I'm gone
Even in the daylight, shine on
And when it's late at night you can look inside
You won't feel so alone

You know we've been down that road
What seems a thousand times before
My back to a closing door and my eyes to the seasons
That roll out underneath my heels
And you don't know how bad it feels
Leave the only one that I have ever believed in
You might also like
Try to leave a light on when I'm gone
Something I rely on to get home
One I can feel at night, a naked light
A fire to keep me warm
Try to leave a light on when I'm gone
Even in the daylight, shine on
And when it's late at night you can look inside
You won't feel so alone
Oh yeah...

Sometimes it feels like we've run out of luck
When the signal keeps on breaking up
When the wires cross in my brain
You'll start my heart again
When I come along, yeah

Try to leave a light on when I'm gone
Something I rely on to get home
One I can feel at night, a naked light
A fire to keep me warm
Try to leave a light on when I'm gone
Even in the daylight, shine on
And when it's late at night you can look inside
You won't feel so alone
Try to leave a light on when I'm gone
Even in the daylight, shine on
And when it's late at night you can look inside
