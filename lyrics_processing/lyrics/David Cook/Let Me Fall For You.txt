I was wrong, I was wrong
Thinking my heart can be my own
I was strong, I was strong
When I had a reason to hold on

Let me fall, let me fall for you
Let me fall for you

Don't look down, don't look down
By now it's too late to take it slow
Turn around, turn around
Give me a reason to let go

Let me fall, let me fall for you
Let me fall for you

It's almost over
I'm hanging by a thread
With all the words you never said
I'm going under
So tell me what to do
I've got nothing to hold on to
Let me fall for you
You might also like
All the time, all the time
You were the one that got me through
Like a sign, like a sign
You were the voice that knew the truth

Let me fall, let me fall for you
Let me fall for you

It's almost over
I'm hanging by a thread
With all the words
You never said
I'm going under
So tell me what to do
I've got nothing to hold on to
Let me fall for you

Let me fall like a stone in the water
Let me fall like a plane out of the sky
Let me crash, let me burn my heart out
Let me learn to fly
It's almost over
I'm hanging by a thread
With all the words
You never said
I'm going under
So tell me what to do
I've got nothing to hold on to
Let me fall for you
Let me fall for you
Nothing to hold on to
Let me fall for you

Let me fall like a stone in the water
Let me fall like a plane out of the sky
Let me crash, let me burn my heart out
