From you're super cool and you're super fresh
Anyone will accept you as a special guest
Now, he or she will do that as a special request

You live inna the town, just turn on the pipe, and get fi your shower
If you've got an AC you can bathe regular
A man nuh want a woman if she 'fraid of water
A woman nuh want a man if him 'fraid of water
