Shabba Ranking pon big ship riddim
(Di Genius)
Right now mi nuh mad bout it but mi errrr ere
Right now mi ignorant bout it but mi ereeeeeeeee ere
How can you not rate who come before you
You a gwaan like a you come bout yah come come mek music big

Yet dem and those, who suppose to respect the elders
Nuh deh yah
And a gwaan like a you a deh man
A nuh you a di man, a god a di man, ereerrrr

None of dem nuh bad like Shabba Ranking
Nuh nuh nuh nuh, none a dem, none a dem
None a dem nuh tough like the Shabba Ranking
Nuh nuh nuh nuh, none a dem, none a dem
Stop dah one deh and ask him
If him nuh imitate the great Shabba Ranking
Unuh can't stop da on da and asked him
If him nuh imitate the great Shabba Ranking

See di fool deh!
Ask him, if him nuh imitate di ranking
The vibes I bring di big songs that I sing
Must inspire and motivate him
Big vibes bouncing pon big ship riddim
From compound back to gully banking

So unuh no bother hide di truth, just put the facts in
Di Gong a H2O and mi need oxygen
Dancehall is like how mi pick the jewels and gem
Tell dem say, mi supply di word fi di him

Thirty years deep, and still a roll in

'Cause dem a brag and boast and its a shame
And dem nuh add up to what dem proclaim
With dem little house, dem little car, dem little chain
Dem baby name, and none a dem nuh badder than Baby Wayne
Wid him around now me, mad, now me inhumane
How many more can this man explain?
That you cannot treat them and Shabba Ranks di same
'Cause when it comes to music, its not fun and game
How unuh fi gwan like unuh waan ignore me
And a boost up who don't come before me
Take it from the foundation, build it a couple of story, Czechoslovakia, adore me
God get the higher praise, and all of the glory
Respect the foundation who come before me
Colonel Josey, Brigadier Jerry, Yellow Man to this man, is legendary
Errrrr


Yet dem and those, who suppose to respect the elders
Nuh deh yah
And a gwaan like a you a deh man
A nuh you a di man, a god a di man, ereerrrr
