She want a elderly man
I don't wrong her still
Because she's thinking about the dollar bill
Come now!

I'm in love with a man, nearly twice my age
Don't know what it is, but its a hit for my youthful days
As I go my way, I don't care what people say
I'm in love with a man, nearly twice my age!

When I tell you girls, in my youthful days
I never loved another man my age
And then the Don, he came along
Made me smile all the while
He stood tall and strong, so strong, so strong...
