Woman, you're pretty like a flowers, that alone nah go do
Although you pretty so, man still a lef' you
You look good from a look good point of view
Although you look good, woman dem look good too
You can dress, you ever look cris and new
No bother make the mate try fi out-dress you
Every woman haffi hold them man, a that them fi do
If you cyan hold your man, a gyal a take him from you

Offer the grip, and the muscle, and him cyan buck-shuffle
Lay the grip, that him go, him haffi come back to you
Offer the grip, and the muscle, and him cyan buck-shuffle
Lay the grip, that him go, him haffi come back to you

Him nah love you fi your face, eeh baby?

Woman you're pretty, but that alone nah go do
You're pretty like a flowers, man still a lef' you
Pretty like a wha', Shabba don't know wha'
The way you're pretty, yes, you set his soul on fire
It's not your pretty face, it's the capturer
The property that you carry under
Woman you're pretty, but that alone nah go do

You can dress, woman, you ever look new
But no bother make your mate try fi out-dress you
