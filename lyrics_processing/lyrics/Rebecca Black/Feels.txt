And I got way too many feels, way too much emotion
I don't even know what's real
I just say fuck it, keep on going
And I get deeper, I get deeper, yeah, I feel I'm rolling
I can see you, yeah, I see you
I don't know, I think I'm rolling
Way too many feels, way too much emotion
I don't even know what's real
I just say fuck it, keep on going
And I get deeper, I get deeper, yeah, I think I'm rolling
I can see you, yeah, I see him
I don't know, I just keep going

And I got way too many feels, way too much emotion
All this Xans inside my body, I say fuck it keep on drowning
You can bring a juice I'll match you
Yeah, you mix it, pour the potion
I don't know who you are, but I'd dive into your ocean
You say you smoking grams, I'm smoking into the Grammys
You say you got them bars, but all I see is candy
You still came through so low-key, think you understand, I don't know me
Still I get along with your best friends, even better with your family

I got way too many feels, way too much emotion
I don't even know what's real
I just say fuck it, keep on going
And I get deeper, I get deeper, yeah, I think I'm rolling
I can see you, yeah, I see you
I don't know I think I'm going

I got all I need, you don't know what I mean
We pour up 'til we go up
Yeah I got way too many feels, not enough to forfeit
So many fuckin' bands, so you know we finna blow it
I'm faded when I'm sober, sober when I'm faded
Overscrutinized by all your counterparts there's no debating

You say it's cause they jaded, yeah, they jealous that I made it
(Do you remember that first time I missed you in the basement?)
Back when we didn't really know, we were searching for some
(Now they pay full advance, and there ain't no fucking discussion)
At the stage they jumping 'cause it's like that
(You see all these checks and now your girl ain't even write back)
But you drink all my Rose, and you know what to do
(Someone dropped up a dose, so we finna get screwed)

You know I got like way too many feels, way too much emotion
Don't know how to make you feel
But I'm sorry, bitch, I'm rollin'
You know I just drop top in that coup, zoom
Don't know where you been at, true
Now I'm searchin' for who you

I don't even know what's real
I just say fuck it, keep on going
And I get deeper, I get deeper, yeah, I feel I'm rolling
I can see you, yeah, I see you
