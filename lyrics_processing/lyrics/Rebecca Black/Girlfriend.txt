Hey, let's talk
Please call back, bye

Told you I needed time, a little space
I packed up everything, all the stuff you left at my place
Moved back in with my mom, just had to get away
Tried to get used to it, waking up not seeing your face

I went out (I went out)
Trying to forget about
Killed some time on the rebound
Where are you now?
'Cause nothing really feels like you

I'm getting back with my girlfriend
Ready to dive in the deep end
This time, it's gonna be different
I'm getting back with my girlfriend (Oh)
Gonna call her, drive on over
Wanna see her, wanna hold her
It hit me all of a sudden
I'm getting back with my girlfriend
You might also like
Friends think I'm naive
I don't care what they say 'cause I'm not listening
Need you like I need to breathe
Never liked the chase much anyway

I went out
Trying to forget about
Killed some time on the rebound
Where are you now? (Where are you now?)
'Cause nothing really feels like you (No, no, no, no)

I'm getting back with my girlfriend
Ready to dive in the deep end
This time, it's gonna be different
I'm getting back with my girlfriend
Gonna call her, drive on over
Wanna see her, wanna hold her
It hit me all of a sudden
I'm getting back with my girlfriend (Girlfriend)

Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
I wanna see her (Hey)
I've got a fever
'Cause I really want her back
Guess I'm gonna have to ask
I wanna see her (Wanna)
I've got a fever
'Cause I really want her back
I'm feeling it hard
I'm getting back with my girlfriend (Yeah, yeah)
Ready to dive in the deep end (Yeah, yeah)
This time, it's gonna be different (It's gonna be)
I'm getting back with my girlfriend
Gonna call her, drive on over
Wanna see her, wanna hold her
It hit me all of a sudden
I'm getting back with my girlfriend

Dum-dum-dum, dum-dum-dum
