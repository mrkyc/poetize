Were you the one who said that I would be nothing?
Well, I'm about to prove you wrong
I'm not the only one who believes in something
My one wish is about to come true

I'm not stopping for you no matter what you do
I'll just keep on dreaming
My head up in the clouds, when nobody's around
To see

This is my moment, my moment
It's my time, flying high, limelight
Feels like my moment, my moment
I've waited for so long but now everybody knows
This is my moment, my moment
It's my time, flying high, limelight
Feels like my moment, my moment
I've waited for so long but now everybody knows
This is my moment

You knew it all along, I was afraid of you
I thought I couldn't be myself
You tried to be my friend, but I wouldn't let you
Remember what you said
You might also like
Don't miss out on your chance, your life is in your hands
So take it just as far as you can
But trusting in yourself, forget everyone else
Believe

This is my moment, my moment
It's my time, flying high, limelight
Feels like my moment, my moment
I've waited for so long but now everybody knows
This is my moment, my moment
It's my time, flying high, limelight
Feels like my moment, my moment
I've waited for so long but now everybody knows

Haters, said I'll see you later
Can't talk to you right now, I'm getting my paper
Said I'm doing big things, things you never dreamed of
I hope you are happy cause I'm 'bout to blow up (Blow up)

This is my moment, my moment
It's my time, flying high, limelight
Feels like my moment, my moment
I've waited for so long but now everybody knows
This is my moment, my moment
It's my time, flying high, limelight
Feels like my moment, my moment
I've waited for so long but now everybody knows
