He couldn't wait to buy them blue suede shoes
Stayed all his days eatin' leaves in the shade
Stayed when the night set too
Conrad, the Caterpillar knew life would be a thriller
Soon as the threads was spun
Wouldn't stop to play in the Caterpillar Games
Till his own webbing game was done
He said, "No, no, I got no time to play
Thousand little legs that don't get me too far in a day
I'm leaving tomorrow, no look like I can't stay"
That little pillar, he found him a willow
Spun in with a craftsman's weave
Wound so tightly to protect him from the light
And all shapes of water that drop from the leaves
Conrad, the Caterpillar knew that would be a chiller
Wound it tighter some more
Wound it so wide 
And the ends of his legs go sore
"No, there isn't any feelin' in my feet
Just when I thought it was time to stroll on down the street
I'm leaving, time looks like I can't leave
What do you know? What's all this moving around with inside me?

Hey, nobody sees a lonely bump on a tree
 cry for more
Conrad, the Caterpillar knew life would be a thriller
As soon as the treads were spun
Anybody stands in the caterpillar's place
Are moving in a standing run
 I just need some room to fly
Spent all of my days just tryin' to keep dry
 a waterfall, not take a little drop from the eye
I can't see nothin' from here anyway, might as well
No, make room and try
Said, no, need a little bit of room to fly
