Perfect little snowflakes dancin' down real fine
Neighbor kids they're skatin' by
People waving, sayin' hi
I'm bored right out of my mind
I'm True To My Nature
I hope you're not true to mine
Well tell me how wrong I am
Let's disagree and we'll get along fine
Gonna eat some cold brains in Macon
Eat some Guinness on the ribs down in New Orleans
Need a little riot in my diet, I'm sick of
Peace and quiet and pleasantries
Strolling beside the beach line
There are those sassy girls dressed in whispers passing by
The sun's melting the ice blue sky
Friends are talking, sayin' hi
I'm bored right out of my mind
I'm True to My Nature
I hope you're not true to mine
Well tell me how wrong I am
Let's disagree and we'll get along fine

And the thread count Dracula's piled high and fine
Troubled waters in the next room

Gonna eat some cold braise in Macon
Eat some sloppy ribs down in New Orleans
