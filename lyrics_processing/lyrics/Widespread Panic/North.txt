Some look for belief
Baby, you look for Jesus
I look for relief
Used to talk about the weather
Used to think it all looks fine
Now we never hang together
Now you're never on my mind
Spinning around in circles
Cut it up in squares
Ask me if I love you baby
Ask me if I care
Last thing that I need's a mustang
Last thing I need's a tan
I'm gonna get myself up north
Find out who the hell I am
Well I, I go north, the sun here burns my eyes
But I don't really care, they're all drowning down here
Trials and tribulations
Face us every day
Baby, we used to talk alot
Now I ain't got much to say
You think it's a joke or something
I think it's all a drag
You think maybe it's in the pocket
Can't be let out of the bag

But I don't really care, they're all drowning down here
Oh, So I will disappear and find my way up north
And find out what I know, ooh just who I am
Oh I will disappear, I will disappear
Some look for religion
And others look for truth
Baby it seems I spend my days
Looking all over for you
You think that its stupid
I say that it's cool
Haul you back to Mexico
Send me back to school
Last thing that I need's a mustang
Last thing I need's a tan
I'm gonna get myself up north
Find out who the hell I am
Well I, I go north, the sun here burns my eyes
But I don't really care, they're all drowning down here
So I will disappear and find my way up north
