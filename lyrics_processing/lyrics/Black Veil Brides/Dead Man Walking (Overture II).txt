They say there was progress
The holy among us
I thought they would lead us through the night
But fear has consumed us
A feeling we can't trust
I hope this will open up their eyes

Stand up before it gets too late
Love now when all is down to hate

So I stare at the sun
And I can't take back, I can't take back the world
And I stare at the sun
And it burns my heart
As I cry I am left with the lie of all of these forgotten words
And we can't take back just what we did
And we can't take back the things we said
But I'll try to change this world again
Before we lose our hope

Feel like a dead man walking
A dead man walking
I'm a dead man walking
A dead man walking

I thought you could hold me
I thought this would show me
That we will live eternal nights
But I can't be bought, no
I won't be taught, no
I have no faith to run back to

Please try before it gets too late
We can choose to end this hate
[Chorus}
So I stare at the sun
And I can't take back, I can't take back the world
And I stare at the sun
And it burns my heart
As I cry I am left with the lie of all of these forgotten words
And we can't take back just what we did
And we can't take back the things we said
But I'll try to change this world again
Before we lose our hope

Feel like a dead man walking
A dead man walking
I'm a dead man walking
A dead man walking
Don't smile at me with your sideways
Two-faced enemy to criticize he said she said
All these years are left for dead
How can we live our lives?
How can we live our lives now?
This is oppression
And where's your goddamn king?
What's missing?
(What's missing?)

And if you're fed up then rise up from the dirt
Will the fight that we once had retreat?
Just a hole where your heart used to be

The nation fades away and the aftertaste is bitter
Will the ghost that haunts stand for this song?
We have nothing for this pain, ignorance to true gain
We can run away and build a wall of isolation, desperation

But they won't be there to answer the call
Who is left now to catch your fall
They won't be there, they won't be there
They won't be there, they won't be there

We're drowning, we're drowning
And I'll be the constant reminder of what life should have been
We're drowning, we're drowning
I feel alone living in a nightmare
Feel like a dead man walking
I'm a dead man walking
I'm a dead man walking
I'm a dead man walking

So I stare at the sun
And I can't take back
I can't take back the world
And I stare at the sun
And it burns my heart
As I cry I am left with the lie of all of these forgotten words
And we can't take back just what we did
And we can't take back the things we said
But I'll try to change this world again
Before we lose our hope

Feel like a dead man walking
A dead man walking
I'm a dead man walking
A dead man walking
