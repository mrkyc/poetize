Sitting on your throne you rest your pretty bones
Don't act like you're alive
Take another chance to do this on my own
But you won't let it die
Feels like a lifetime living in this pain
While the whole world passes me by
Losing the daylight but I must admit
That you're suited for this lie (Another lie)

We will fight back through your broken
Past and your vanity
Throw the first stone
We will arrive throughout all our lives
Still you don't believe

F.E.A.R., hate
Love take it to your grave
F.E.A.R., hate
Love take it to your grave

Everyday you grind your teeth and spit out blood
Dripping down from your own life
Swinging from the axe it crashes and it hits
So why not even try

We will fight back through your broken
Past and your vanity
Throw the first stone
We will arrive throughout all our lives
Still you don't believe
Say goodbye to the world you know
Say goodbye to your mask of hope
We will fight back through your broken
Past and your vanity
Throw the first stone

Save your words there's only time
To kill the way you made me
So save your words, I'm moving on
There's only hate within me
Your vanity my enemy...
The time has come for you to know
Just save your words there's only time
To kill the life you gave me...
I won't go back


We will fight back through your broken
Past and your vanity
Throw the first stone
We will arrive throughout all our lives
Still you don't believe
Say goodbye to the world you know
Say goodbye to your mask of hope
We will fight back through your broken
Past and your vanity
F.E.A.R., hate
Love take it to your grave
