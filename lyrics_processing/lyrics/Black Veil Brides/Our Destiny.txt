Have we begun to drift away
Have we learned from our mistakes
Who will be the one to save our destiny?
All the lights have hit our eyes
And we said our last goodbyes
Who will be the one to save our destiny?
Who will save?

The king is dead
In our town of broken dreams
The rivers red
Are we breaking at the seams
Bleeding out
Fire spreads like kerosene
We're going down
We're going down in tragedy

Singing
Oh, woah, woah, woah, oh, oh
Oh, woah, woah, woah, oh, oh

Have we begun to drift away
Have we learned from our mistakes
Who will be the one to save our destiny?
All the lights have hit our eyes
And we said our last goodbyes
Who will be the one to save our destiny?

Sound the bells
From the dark and hollow hills
Hounds from hell
Yeah, we're goin' in for the kill
No defense
We've got nothin' left to lose
But our revenge
We'll remind them of our truth

Singing
Oh, woah, woah, woah, oh, oh
Oh, woah, woah, woah, oh, oh

Have we begun to drift away
Have we learned from our mistakes
Who will be the one to save our destiny?
All the lights have hit our eyes
And we said our last goodbyes
Who will be the one to save our destiny?
