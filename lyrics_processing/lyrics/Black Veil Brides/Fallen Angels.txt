(Scream! Shout!)
(Scream! Shout!)
(We are the fallen angels!)

We are the in between
Cast down as sons of war
Struck to the earth like lightning
On this world we're torn
We won't cause the pain
Of living out their law
Take joy in who you are
We know our wings are flawed

We're bored to death in heaven
And down alone in hell
We only want to be ourselves

We scream (We scream!), we shout (We shout!)
We are the fallen angels
We scream (We scream!), we shout
(Woah! Woah oh oh oh!)
To those who sing alone
No need to feel this sorrow
We scream (We scream!), we shout
(Woah! We are the fallen angels!)

Follow the morning star
A light when darkness fell
The passion left unholy
Now you find yourself
We have nowhere to go
No one to wish us well
A cry to find our home
Our stories they will tell

We're bored to death in heaven
And down alone in hell
We only want to be ourselves

We scream (We scream!), we shout (We shout!)
We are the fallen angels
We scream (We scream!), we shout
(Woah! Woah oh oh oh!)
To those who sing alone
No need to feel this sorrow
We scream (We scream!), we shout
(Woah! We are the fallen angels!)
