Don't ever look to the sun
He will burn your eyes with the fire of his light
And never pray in the house of
Eternal sight where the spirit goes to die
So now we stand up and again we cry for the passion of his name
It's where we love, where we hate
It's the price we pay when our love is out of time

Where is the spark that won't fade away?
And where is the queen to my king of pain?

Say my name, never leave your side, I will be your shadow in the night
Love and fear cannot win the fight
Even with an army behind your life
So don't walk away, I'll keep you safe, forget promises that we made
Say my name, never leave your side, I will be your shadow here tonight

And when we find what we need from these
Broken hearts and what was missing from the start
Speak the words of a God that
Refused to lie to a believer that won't try
I want to give up as my vision fades. I'm left alone and now I'm blind
Don't make me go to the desert that I left
Behind with the ashes of a faith that died

I cannot see what's become of life
It's all just passing by
I cannot see what's become of life
It's all just passing by, yeah

Love and fear cannot win the fight
Even with an army behind your life
