We've built it up just to fall apart
Try to leave them wanting more
As we scream and we fight, carry on through the night
But the problem is never the cure
Every day we try to be better than the lies and the sins
I will love all the hate, feel like one in the same
I only sink before I swim

I swear this time is gonna be the last one
Gonna be the last one, oh woah ho
This time is gonna be the last one
Gonna be the last one, oh woah ho

I'll forget all the dreams that we told our hearts
And the pain that's there to start
Try to find what is safe from the scars that replace
Like a faithful that converts

I swear this time is gonna be the last one
Gonna be the last one, oh woah ho
This time is gonna be the last one
Gonna be the last one, oh woah ho
I'm standing ground
We sing it out
The legion of the underground
This time is gonna be the last one
Gonna be the last one, oh woah ho

Keeps pulling me under
When the waves come down
I can't come up for air
Keeps pulling me under
When I close my eyes
It's all that I can bear
Keeps pulling me under
Let the rain come down
And wash away the fear
Keeps pulling me under
Let the rain come down
And wash away, wash away the fear
Yeah

I swear this time is gonna be the last one
Gonna be the last one, oh woah ho
This time is gonna be the last one
Gonna be the last one, oh woah ho
I'm standing ground
We sing it out
The legion of the underground
This time is gonna be the last one
