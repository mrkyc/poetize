Last night a little dancer, came dancin' through my door
Last night a little angel, came pumping on my floor
She said come on baby, I've got a license for love
And if it expires, pray help from above, because

In the midnight hour, she cried more, more, more
With a rebel yell she cried more, more, more
In the midnight hour babe more, more, more
With a rebel yell she cried more, more, more
More, more, more!

She don't like slavery, she won't sit and beg
But when I'm tired and lonely she gives me head
I said, what sets you free and brought you to me, babe
What sets you free, I need you here by me, because

In the midnight hour, she cried more, more, more
With a rebel yell she cried more, more, more
In the midnight hour babe more, more, more
With a rebel yell she cried more, more, more

He lives in his own heaven
Collects it to go from the seven eleven
Well, he's out all night to collect a fare
Just as long, just as long it don't mess up his hair

I walked the ward, with you, babe
A thousand times, with you
I dried your tears, of pain, babe
A million times, for you
I'd sell my soul, for you, babe
For money to burn, with you
I'd give you all, and have none, babe
Just to, just to, just to, just to, to have you here by me, because

In the midnight hour, she cried more, more, more
With a rebel yell she cried more, more, more
In the midnight hour babe more, more, more
With a rebel yell she cried more, more, more
More, more, more!

Ooh yeah, little baby
She want more
More, more, more, more, more!
Ooh yeah, little angel
She want more
