If you're ever to leave me
How could I breathe?
How could I even go on?
If you're not here beside me
Then what good would my life be?
This life won't mean a thing if you're not around
And don't you know that
If I lose you there'll be no joy to be found, no
This world won't show a thing to me, oh

(I don't wanna smile)
If you're not smiling with me
(I don't wanna laugh)
If you're not there to share the laughter with me
(I don't wanna live)
Without you, what kinda life would that be?
(Oh baby) oh baby
(No, baby) No
I don't wanna smile
If you're not smiling with me

If there's ever a moment
When you're not there
Sharing these moments with me
It will be such a sad song
It would all just be over
You might also like
The stars wouldn't shine as bright if you walk away
And don't you know that
There'll be no reason to wake up every day, oh
This world won't mean a thing to me, oh

(I don't wanna smile)
If you're not smiling with me
(I don't wanna laugh)
If you're not there to share the laughter with me
(I don't wanna live)
Without you, what kinda life would that be?
(Oh baby) Oh baby
(No, baby) No
I don't wanna smile
If you're not smiling with me (Baby)

I don't wanna see the sunrise
If I can't see it with you (You)
I just know that there will be no joy
In anything I do
This world will be too sad for me, so

(I don't wanna smile)
If you're not smiling with me
(I don't wanna laugh)
If you're not there to share the laughter with me
(I don't wanna live)
Without you, what kinda life would that be?
(Oh baby) Oh baby
(No, baby) No
I don't wanna smile
If you're not smiling with me
Not smiling with me
Not smiling with me
