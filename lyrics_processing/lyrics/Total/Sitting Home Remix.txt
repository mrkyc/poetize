The man you've all been waiting to hear, check him out

Let it be understood, Bad Boy run this
Brooklyn to A-T, they pump this (C'mon)
Punch you in your head with this gun shit
Yeah, I know, I be on some dumb shit (Uh-huh)
Run with cold, killa niggas that air the block out (Yeah)
Them chinchilla broads that wear your cock out (Haha)
Cost a half-a-mil, that was me you seen hop out (Woo)
Stop playin', game over like the lockout
Serious shit, I'm the baddest Bad Boy, period, shit
Me and P-U-double-F in the four period six (Yeah)
Knocking Total, Callaway flavor, know that

I'm getting tired being tired of your ways (C'mon)
You haven't come home or even called me today (This is the remix)
You don't know the pain when I'm feelin' alone (That's right)
I'm calling out your name when you're not even home (Yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah)

And I need you with me, babe
Can't see you leaving me, babe
'Cause I don't know no other road I would go
And I hope your feelings change
Come bring your lovin' back to me
So I can give you what you need and much more (This is the remix, Bad Boy style)
You might also like
Sitting home waiting for you (Waiting)
'Cause staring at these walls is all I do (Mhm)
I try my best to be good to you
But you're never around when I'm in the mood (Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah)

All my friends think that I am a fool (Talk to 'em, Keisha)
And since you have been gone, I've been thinkin so, too
Just tell me what it is and what you feel I do wrong (You don't do nothin' wrong)
Why we should stay together 'cause our love is so strong (I feel you, let's go)

And I need you with me, babe
Can't see you leaving me, babe
'Cause I don't know no other road I would go
And I hope your feelings change
Come bring your lovin' back to me
So I can give you what you want and much more (Shyne, talk to me one more time)

I think it's only right I let it be known
I was on some multi-platinum melody tone
Shoot me, 'bout to bury me, holmes
Carryin' chrome, pencil bars
And Continental Rs, coincidental? Nah
I was meant to do this, my speeches as a fetus
Meet you at your zenith, you B-list
I'm A-1, you lightweight, I'm eight tons
You better off counting stars than the hoes that I made cum
Hot to death, I ain't talking rhymes
I'm talking 'bout this vest, TEC and the coat that cover it all
From the better we ball, BK to 2-5
Nigga, Shyne and it's too live (Too live)
Say you better, nigga, you lie
Want to be me, you can't fit the shoe size
On hoes, bruised thighs, young don
From, um, Brooklyn, done, gone
Sitting home waiting for you
'Cause staring at these walls is all I do
I try my best to be good to you
But you're never around when I'm in the mood (Kima, Keisha, Pam)
Sitting home waiting for you (Ain't no remix like a Bad Boy remix)
'Cause staring at these walls is all I do
I try my best to be good to you
But you're never around when I'm in the mood (It don't stop)
Sitting home waiting for you
'Cause staring at these walls is all I do
I try my best to be good to you
But you're never around when I'm in the mood
Sitting home waiting for you
