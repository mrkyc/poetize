Ow!

I break your bones and your gristles
Get high as a missile, blow like a whistle
Grip my titties like a pistol
Bang bang, let me hear Total sang
Swang your ding-a-ling, okay, I swing my poontang
The kind that rock in my '98 drop
Stop the car, niggas (*skrr*)
Feel my head bop (Ooh)
Hit me off with that new Total rock
That new Total rock

I like my man lookin' cute in some boots
Dirty boots, Tommy jeans
Baggy jeans, wit' some cream
If you know what I mean
(Ooh ooh ooh ooh)
Boy, you move too fast (Uh-huh)
He drive a truck that he can thump
Smokin' skunk in the seats of his Jeep
But he's fresh 'cause the nigga feelin' on my knee
(Wah-one, wah-one, two, ooh-ooh, wah-one, wah-one, two)

I like my man in the club, lookin' thug
He's a thug, a fly guy from the Southside
And he wanna kick it wit' me
(Beep, beep, vroom, ayo, ayo, ayo)
He's on his cell phone and the boy's full grown
Should I be grown if the boy want my booty?
(Brr, brr, boom, ha ha ha, ah, ah)

Get your foot up off the gas (Oh yeah)
Don't be feelin' on my ass, no, no, no
