Baby, can we spend some time
But if only for one night
I wanna be together
I wanna be with you
Baby, can we spend some time
But if only for one night
I wanna be together

All of my days and nights
I spend dreaming of us together
I never realized how much of my time
Goes to thinking of you
You're always on my mind

Baby, can we spend some time
But if only for one night
(Can we spend some time, baby?)
I wanna be together
I wanna be with you
Baby, can we spend some time (Hey)
But if only for one night
(One night is all, baby)
I wanna be together
You might also like
I wanna talk to you
About the things that we can do
Is that alright with you, baby?
Can we work this out?
I need to be sure
That you understand what love is all about

Baby, can we spend some time (Yeah, yeah)
But if only for one night
I wanna be together
(Baby, baby, baby, baby)
I wanna be with you
(You know my love for you is crazy)
Baby, can we spend some time (Oh, oh)
But if only for one night (Hey)
(One night is all, baby)
I wanna be together (Yeah, yeah, for one night)

All my days, and all my nights
I wanna be with you tonight
(I wanna be with you)
Baby can we spend some time
I wanna be with you
All my days, and all my nights
(All my days)
I wanna be with you tonight
(And all my nights)
Baby can we spend some time
I wanna be with you
(Baby, baby)
Baby, can we spend some time (One night)
But if only for one night (Oh yeah)
I wanna be together
I wanna be with you
(Can we spend some time alone?)
Baby, can we spend some time (Oh)
But if only for one night (Hey, yeah)
I wanna be together
I wanna be with you (Hey, yeah)
(All my days, and all my nights)
Baby, can we spend some time
(If only for one night)
But if only for one night (Oh yeah)
I wanna be together
(Baby, can we spend some time?)
I wanna be with you
(Can we spend some time?)

Baby, can we spend some time (You and me)
But if only for one night (And all of my days)
I wanna be together
(Baby, can we spend some time?)
(And all my nights)
I wanna be with you (I wanna be with you)
(All my days, and all my nights)
Baby, can we spend some time (Mhm)
But if only for one night (Hey, yeah)
I wanna be together
(Baby, can we spend some time?)
I wanna be with you (Oh baby)
(All my days, and all my nights)
