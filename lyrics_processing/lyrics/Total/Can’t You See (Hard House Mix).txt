In the middle of the day now, baby
I seem to think of only you, hey, ho, hmm, oh yeah
Never thinking for a moment
That you've been thinking of me too, yeah

Oh, I can't wait for the day
That we can be together
I can't let you walk away, oh
Can't you see you and me
Were meant to be, oh baby
And there's nothing left to say, hey

Oh baby, can't you see what you do to me
Our love was meant to be
You were made for me
(Boy, why don't you see what you do to me?)
Oh baby, can't you see what you do to me
Our love was meant to be
You were made for me

And there's nothing left to, and there's nothing left to
And there's nothing left to, and there's nothing left to
And there's nothing left to, and there's nothing left to
And there's nothing left to say, hey
You might also like
Every time I see you
Oh, I get this feeling, oh yeah, hmm
Telling me you are the one
Oh, what a feeling, hey, hey

I can't wait for the day
That we can be together
I can't let you walk away, oh
Can't you see you and me
Were meant to be, oh baby

And there's nothing left to, and there's nothing left to
And there's nothing left to, and there's nothing left to
And there's nothing left to, and there's nothing left to
And there's nothing left to say, hey

Oh baby, can't you see what you do to me
Our love was meant to be
You were made for me
(Boy, why don't you see what you do to me?)
Oh baby, can't you see what you do to me
Our love was meant to be
You were made for me
Take me away, so far away
Oh, what you do to me, oh, oh, oh
I wanna be alone together
Somewhere just you and me
Oh, oh

And there's nothing left to, and there's nothing left to
And there's nothing left to, and there's nothing left to
And there's nothing left to, and there's nothing left to
And there's nothing left to say, hey

And there's nothing left to, and there's nothing left to
And there's nothing left to, and there's nothing left to
And there's nothing left to, and there's nothing left to
And there's nothing left to say, hey
And there's nothing left to, and there's nothing left to
And there's nothing left to, and there's nothing left to
And there's nothing left to, and there's nothing left to
And there's nothing left to say, hey
