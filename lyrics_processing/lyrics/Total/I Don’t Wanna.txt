I tore up the pictures
All the memories of you
'Cause I don't wanna remember
All the pain you put me through
Here I go again
Can't get you far from out of my mind
And so many times I've cried
I tried to put these things behind me

I don't wanna think about ya (I don't)
I don't even wanna spend no time around ya (I can't)
Every time, I can't function without ya (No, no)
Every time I sit home thinkin' about ya
I don't wanna think about ya (I don't)
I don't even wanna spend no time around ya (I can't)
Every time I can't function without ya
Every time I sit up thinkin' about ya

I keep tellin' myself
I don't love you anymore
But why am I foolin' myself
'Cause this feeling is not too sure
Everything I do
Just brings memories of us
And I don't wanna think about you
But I'm missing all of your love
I don't

I don't wanna think about ya (Baby)
I don't even wanna spend no time around ya (I can't)
Every time I can't function without ya
Every time I sit home thinkin' about ya (I can't)
I don't wanna think about ya
I don't even wanna spend no time around ya (I can't)
Every time, I can't function without ya (Can't function)
Every time I sit up thinkin' about ya

My heart's lonely (Yeah)
I've been so depressed for weeks
Can't get you off my mind for me
Someone has took the joy from me
(My my my my my my)
My heart's lonely (I'm lonely)
I've been so depressed for weeks (Can't get you)
Can't get you off my mind for me
Someone has took the joy from me

I don't wanna think about ya (I don't)
I don't even wanna spend no time around ya (I can't)
Every time, I can't function without ya (No, no)
Every time I sit up thinkin' about ya
(I'm going out of my mind)
I don't wanna think about ya
I don't even wanna spend no time around ya (Baby, I can't)
Every time, I can't function without ya (No, no)
Every time I sit up thinkin' about ya
I don't wanna think about ya
I don't even wanna spend no time around ya
Every time, I can't function without ya
Every time I sit up thinkin' about ya
I don't wanna think about ya
I don't even wanna spend no time around ya
Every time, I can't function without ya
