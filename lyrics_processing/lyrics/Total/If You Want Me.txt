What you think, what Ma$e be young, Ma$e be dumb?
Get Ma$e strung, there'll be no pre-numb?
Ever since B.I.G. died, my life's changed
Out the blue, I'm your boo
Yo, that's quite strange
I get nice thangs, way out they price range
And half these girls, don't even know my right name
See a fly rollie, mink made of coyote
Love a ghetto chick, cause I know she'd die for me
You got me confused, see Cam the freak
Ma$e never the playa, bring sand to the beach
I'm sumthin' that the average girl hand couldn't reach
Living expenses, 20 grand a week
You know me, I be O-T, low key
Platinum rollie, smokin' a O-Z
I'm that babyfaced playa, without no goatee
2 point 8, and about to go 3
