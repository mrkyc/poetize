At home, yeah

Sitting home waiting for you (Mhm)
'Cause staring at these walls is all I do (Yeah yeah)
I try my best to be good to you
But you're never around when I'm in the mood

I'm getting tired of being tired your ways
You haven't come home or even call me today
And you don't know the pain when I'm feeling alone
I'm calling out your name when you're not even home

And I need you with me, babe
Can't see you leaving me, babe
'Cause I don't know no other road I would go
And I hope your feelings change
Come bring your lovin' back to me
So I can give you all you need and much more
Oh, I'm sitting

Sitting home waitin' for you (And I'm waiting)
'Cause staring at these walls is all I do (Mhm, mhm)
I try my best to be good to you (To be good to you)
But you're never around when I'm in the mood
(Yeah yeah, yeah yeah)
