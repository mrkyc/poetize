He said, you may not be doin' it right
But I always get my way
Is it the way that I twist my big hips
That mak the bad boys all flip the script
I get my mini-skirt
Look into my eyes then I lick my lips

When I'm in my room I need your concentration
I climb on my bed, open my legs... ejaculation
Then I lay back to get in the perfect situation
You know what I'm saying, never keep a girl like me waiting
Don't keep me waiting
 
Bet she can't do like I do it
'cause when I do I throw my back into it
And if you doubt me then let me prove it
'cause I can turn you out

When I'm on the phone I like to talk nasty
You can call me late at night, tell me what you wanna ask me
What am I wearing, what is the color of my draws
In my bed, I'm your girl, I hit you with the yes-yes-y'all
Yes-yes-y'all
You might also like 
Bet she can't do like I do it
'cause when I do I throw my back into it
And if you doubt me then let me prove it
'cause I can turn you out

I'ma give it to you boy like all night
I'ma make sure I treat you right
I don't wanna be rude or impolite
But I bet your girl don't do you right
 
Bet she can't do like I do it
'cause when I do I throw my back into it
And if you doubt me then let me prove it
'cause I can turn you out
 
Bet she can't, bet she won't
But I will, if she don't
If she won't, I got the goods baby

Bad boy, missy, total, misdemeanor, puff daddy
One time, hit me, two times, out
I'ma give it to you boy like all night
