I think you need to think back
When we were sexin' each other
Tell me what you wanna do
Tell me

Say you don't wanna press rewind
Think back to the times
Where sexin' me was the only thing on your mind
Look me eye to eye
And tell me you don't want
What you used to get tonight
Boy, I remember just what you like
And for you, boy, been keepin' it nice and tight
Waitin' for this moment to come with you
So press rewind to when you was mine
And tell me what you wanna do

Press rewind
Give it to me again and again
Askin' what you say, baby
What you wanna do?
