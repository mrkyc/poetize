Do you know, you put me under
I start to wonder, how do you know?
How I feel when you're around me
I can't control it, how do you know?

Many a day goes by
When I'm just sitting around letting the time go by
There's nothing else to do, oh no
At least not 'til I met you

Do you know, you put me under (Oh)
I start to wonder, how do you know?

How do you know? (How do you know?)

It feels so good to let you know
How I'm feeling, yeah
But you seem to know these things
You make my heart sing
Every time you walk into the room, hoo
