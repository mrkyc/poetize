Ayo bitch, turn the fuckin' music up
You fuckin' bitch
I heard you've been fuckin' with my man
What kind of friend are you?
What's goin' on? What am I dealin' with?
(Wah wah wah wah wah wah wah wah wah)
I can't believe it
You call yourself a fuckin' friend?
I should stamp on your face right now
Fuckin' bitch
Don't look, don't look at me
You call yourself a friend?

I feel so bad
For lovin' my homegirl's man
I tried
(You call yourself a friend?)
I swear I tried
(Wah wah wah wah wah wah wah wah wah)
And it's so sad
That she don't know all we did how long ago
(You call yourself a friend)
I tried
I've tried
You might also like
I know I'm wrong
But I can't help it
I tried to block you out my mind
But I can't help it
For real, you know I tried

(You call yourself a friend?)
I tried (I tried)
(Wah wah wah wah wah wah wah wah)
I know I'm wrong

What to do to make these feelings go away
I tried

I tried (Oh, baby, baby, baby)

Baby, believe me

Tried my best not to let them know
Wanna be wherever you go
Got the biggest crush on you
For real I tried, and that's the truth
Baby, believe me (Believe me)
When I say, I really (I tried)
Tried my best not to let them know
Wanna be wherever you go

Can't believe you were fuckin' wit' my man
Get out
You call yourself a friend?
