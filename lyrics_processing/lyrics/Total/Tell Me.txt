I like that
That's right
We gon' smooth it out a little bit, ha
For all you players out there
And we gonna sex it up a little bit
For all you lovers out there

Every woman wants a man
Who can satisfy her desires, mmm
But if you can't understand
That you got me waiting for your love
And I need to hear the word from you

Tell me what you want me to do
'Cause baby, I'm waiting
(I'm waiting)
Waiting for an answer from you
Tell me what you want me to do
(So won't you tell me)
'cos baby I'm waiting
(I'm waiting)
Gotta hear a word from you, baby
You might also like
Baby, I'm not afraid
To speak from my heart to you
What I feel is so true
Take me, embrace me
Don't keep me waiting for you
Give me your lovin', hey, oh

Tell me what you want me to do
(Tell me right now, baby baby)
'cause baby I'm waiting
(I'm waiting, just waiting)
Waiting for an answer from you
(Won't you tell me)
Tell me what you want me to do
'Cause baby I'm waiting (Oh, oh)
Gotta hear a word from you, baby

Gotta tell you how I feel
Love so good it seems unreal
Really need your love right now
Make it work somehow
So won't you tell me what I gotta do, babe
I really, really need your love
Tell me what you want me to do
(I can't get enough)
Can't get enough of your lovin' (Oh)
Can't get enough of the things you do (Oh)
Can't get enough of your loving
Can't get enough of the things you do (Tell me)
Tell me what you want me to do
(What you want me to do, baby)
'Cause baby I'm waiting

Waiting for an answer from you
