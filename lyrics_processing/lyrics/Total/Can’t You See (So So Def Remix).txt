("Act up, I'll have my honeys Total bust your sh**")
Yeah, Bad Boy, So So Def collaboration

Now this be the big play double payback
When I come through, I crack sacroiliacs (Uh)
Step to the mic, the girls cry like onions
'Cause they know I'm 'bout to stomp their favorite rapper out like bunions (Woo)
In a procedure, from fades, braids, dreads, afros and caesars
I'm puttin' rappers in seizures (Come on)
(Our love was meant to be, baby)
Verbal pack, I drops it freely like an almanac
I gotta come outside with the nine and take my style back (Check it)
React like a soul who reflects in paragraph (Yeah)
Roll up fat tracks with illy Philly skillies that I have (Uh)
(Our love was meant to be, baby)
To see a smile up on your face, I rig the bass and wreck the place
Niggas know the case, I'll be on the paper chase (Yeah)
Call my name (Uh-huh) and I'll come runnin' (What?), gunnin'
All y'all bummin' niggas will get done in
Shit, I keeps it tight like KITT and Michael Knight
(Our love was meant to be, baby)
Keith Murray and Total, y'all (Total), on the remix (Remix), word up

(Bad Boy) In the middle of the day, babe
I seem to think of only you, yeah
Never thinking for a moment
That you've been thinking of me too, yeah

I can't wait for the day
That we can be together
I can't let you walk away
(Hello, can you play that Total remix?)
Can't you see you and me
Were meant to be, oh baby
And there's nothing left to say

Oh baby, can't you see what you do to me
Our love was meant to be, baby
Oh baby, can't you see what you do to me
(What you're doin' to me)
Our love was meant to be, baby

Every time I see you
I get this feeling, yeah
Telling me you are the one
Oh, what a feeling, hey

I can't wait for the day
That we can be together
I can't let you walk away
Can't you see you and me
Were meant to be, oh baby

Oh baby, can't you see what you do to me
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh yeah)
Our love was meant to be, baby

Take me away, so far away
Oh, what you do to me, oh, oh
I wanna be alone together
Somewhere just you and me
Oh, oh, oh, oh yeah

Oh baby, can't you see what you do to me
(Can't you see, baby?)
Our love was meant to be, baby
(What you done did to me)
Oh baby, can't you see what you do to me

Baby, our love was meant to be

Baby, our love was meant to be
