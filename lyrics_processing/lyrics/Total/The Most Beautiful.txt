When my eyes met your eyes
I knew from the day
A moment you will never regret
Maybe tonight will be so right
For me and you
You're so beautiful

All my life I stood by
(Just standin' all alone without no one to call my own)
Then you came by and changed my life
(Now I'm dancin' 'cause you gave me a heart to call home)

What you are to me (Yeah)
Is everything I need (I need)
As far as I can see (Can see)
The most beautiful... (Most beautiful)
What you are to me (What you are)
Is everything I need (Need, need, need)
As far as I can see (Oh)
The most beautiful...

Finally you started to touch me
And you made it rise, ooh, you made it rise
My body started to go (Round and round)
Into overdrive, you got me high
(You're so beautiful)
