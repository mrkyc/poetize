You thought it would be easy
Something like a shopping spree
But living life 'n limbo
Created your catastrophe
Now you say you're sorry
And that's good, but it's not over yet
But if you want me to forgive you
I'll be willing to forget it ever happened
Erase it from my mind
I gave my life to save you
That's the plan
That I designed, because
I L-O-V-E U
I L-O-V-EU
Put your trust in me
'Cause I L-O-V-E Y-O-U
Lately you've been thinkin'
That you're the captain of the sea
But when your ship was sinkin'
Your transportation back was me
Do you remember?

That you need someone to navigate
Which leads me to the question
"When can we affiliate?"
I know survival
Is not an easy task
I've always been the answer
But I thought you'd never ask, you see
I L-O-V-E U
I L-O-V-E U
Put your trust in me
'Cause I L-O-V-E Y-O-U
I L-O-V-E U
I L-O-V-E U
Put your trust in me
'Cause I L O V E Y O U
I'm more than able
Like a beacon in the night
To see that you don't
Ever lose your way
Because your defense is defective
Even at its best
But my efforts will never
Fail because
G, H, I
(J, K)
L-O-V-E U
I L-O-V-E U
Put your trust in me
'Cause I L O V E Y O U

Put your trust in Me
'Cause I L-O-V-E Y-O-U
Love is patient
Love is kind
Love is no envy
Love is not pride
Love behaves
Love is not selfish
Or easily provoked
Love is not evil
Love shares truth
Instead of spreading lies
Love bears all
Love believes all
Love endures all
Love is home for all
Love never fails
I L-O-V-E U
Put your trust in me
'Cause I love you
Put your trust in me
'Cause I love you
Put your trust in me
'Cause I love you
Put your trust in me
'Cause I love you
Put your trust in me
'Cause I love you
Put your trust in me
