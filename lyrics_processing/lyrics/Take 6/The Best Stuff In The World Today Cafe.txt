I left the office to get fed
I had dined at every place on Main
My appetite was ripe for change
And there stood this old restaurant
I had never seen before
And a stranger in an apron
Came bursting through the door and said
Welcome to 'The Best Stuff In the World Today Cafe'
We are all believers in a better way
We were served as customers not so long ago
Now we are all waiters, thought you ought to know
Then the waiter said to me
Everything we serve is free
And when he saw that I was full of doubt
He shoved the best stuff in my mouth
The food was so fantastic, man
I could not stay in my seat
I jumped up from the table
And dragged a stranger off the street and said
Welcome to 'The Best Stuff In the World Today Cafe'
We are all believers in a better way
We were served as customers not so long ago
Now we are all waiters, thought you ought to know
See Take 6 LiveGet tickets as low as $33You might also likeAnd if you're inclined to take the time
To show your gratitude
Then serve somebody else today
Like I've done for you
Pretty soon the business went berserk
And all the people left their work
In every case because they took the time to serve
They each got more than they deserved
The pantry soon was empty
And all that we could find
Was some simple bread and wine
But the people stood in line to say
Welcome to 'The Best Stuff In the World Today Cafe'
We are all believers in a better way
We were served as customers not so long ago
Now we are all waiters, thought you ought to know
So know you know the way I learned
That once the tables have been turned
It's just not enough to have your fill
Tip the waitress, pay the bill
When you can serve the banquet
That the world's so hungry for
So grab an waiter's apron
And see who's at the door and say
Welcome to 'The Best Stuff In the World Today Cafe'
We are all believers in a better way
We were served as customers not so long ago
