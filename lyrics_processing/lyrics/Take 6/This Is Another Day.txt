Just want to thank You Lord
Thank You for one more day
This is another day that the Lord has kept me
Ooh, this is another day He blessed me
He kept me from all evil with my mind stayed on him
And I know He's gonna keep me
Until He returns again
This is another day that the Lord has kept me
Ooh, this is another day He blessed me
He kept me from all evil with my mind stayed on him
And I know He's gonna keep me
Until He returns again
Have you ever felt like you couldn't make it?
You didn't have the strength to go through
Troubles and trials always got you down
You cry, "Lord what shall I do?"
Stop depending on your feelings
And start trusting in God's word
'Cuz I'm persuaded, He will keep me
He'll never leave me till I see his face someday
