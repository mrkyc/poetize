Just when I think I can get a breath of fresh air I'm gasping for more
I can remember way back in my childhood days when my mama used to say to me
"God sees the little sparrow fall and I know He's got His eye on me"
I believe what she told me
I believe what she said is true (I believe it! )
I believe what she told me
She said, "God will take care of you" (I believe it)
Just believe what He tells you
And put Him first in everything you do
And He will make a way out of no way
Exchange your lonely nights for brighter days
That's the reason why, why, why He would say that
"You gotta believe in Me"
I kept thinking I could make it on my own and only call when I'm in need (call on You Lord)
It took some trials to break my stubborn mind, but I'm gonna follow where you lead
You never said the way would be easy, or that there would never be any night
You said, "My yoke is easy and my burden is light"
I believe what He told me
I believe what He said is true (I believe it)
I believe what He told me
He said: I will take care of you" (I believe it)
Believe that He tells you
And put Him first in everything you do
He will make a way out of no way
Exchange your lonely nights for brighter days
That's why, why, why He would say that
"You gotta believe in Me"
I believe what you told me
No doubt in my mind
No greater love
I'll ever find
I'll tell everybody, everywhere I go
I believe what He said, and I'm gonna follow His way
He will make a way out of no way
Exchange your lonely nights for brighter days
That's the reason why, why He woud say
He'll give eternal life if you believe (but ya gotta believe)
He will make a way out of no way
Exchange your lonely nights for brighter days
That's the reason why, why He would say
