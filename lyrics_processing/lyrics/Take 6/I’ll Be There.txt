I'm a step ahead of you
And whatever you need
You can believe what I say I'll do, I'll do
I'll be there when you feel you can't go on
I'll be there when all hope is gone
I'll be there like a beacon in the night
I'll be there to make what's wrong right
I'll be there whenever you call
I'll be there to catch you when you fall
I'll be there to wipe all your raindrops away
Sunshine's on the way, sunshine's on the way
Whenever it rains, I'll ease your pain
And chase the clouds away
Don't be afraid of what you can't see
Just call on me and I will lead the way
I'll be there when you feel you can't go on
I'll be there when all hope is gone
I'll be there like a beacon in the night
I'll be there to make what's wrong right
I'll be there whenever you call
I'll be there to catch you when you fall
I'll be there to wipe all your raindrops away
Sunshine's on the way, sunshine's on the way
