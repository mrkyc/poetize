You know that I've got it
(Sho' you right, sho' you right)
Well, you might wonder why I'm so happy
And if I'm right there's one thing you should know
I've just been connected
(Oh Lord)
To an everlasting source of power
And that power makes me glow
No, I'm not saying I don't have problems
And I can't say that I don't get down
But it behooves me to move with a pep in my step
When I'm excited 'bout the joy that I've found
I might have trouble on every side yet not distressed
I might be perplexed but never in despair
Persecuted but not forsaken
Cast down but not destroyed
Whoa I've got life in Jesus
(Better believe)
That I've got life just look at the smile on my face
Oh, I've got life in Jesus
And you know that I'm gonna win this race
Got that life got that life
