Down here i have done my best
I have been to the pool, I've been baptized
I wanna go to heaven and rest
I wanna go to heaven and rest
Down here i have done my best
I have been to the pool, I've been baptized
I wanna go to heaven and rest
Well one of these mornings it won't be long
Good for me and I will be gone
Gone down the Jordan on a willing tide
Just gonna shake this frame of mine
But...
I wanna go to heaven and rest
Down here i have done my best
I have been to the pool, I've been baptized
I wanna go to heaven and rest
I wanna go to heaven and rest
Down here i have done my best
I have been to the pool, I've been baptized
I wanna go to heaven and rest
Hey now
When I get to heaven gonna sing and tell
The . taller bill in the hit of the day
To let my heart and begin to play
I wanna go to heaven and rest
Down here i have done my best
I have been to the pool, I've been baptized
I wanna go to heaven and rest
I wanna go to heaven and rest
Down here i have done my best
I have been to the pool, I've been baptized
I wanna go to heaven and rest
... to the hit of the day to my heart and begin to play
I wanna go to heaven and rest
Down here i have done my best
I have been to the pool
I wanna go to heaven and rest
I wanna go to heaven and rest
Down here i have done my best
I have been to the pool, I've been baptized
I wanna go to heaven and rest
I wanna go to heaven and rest
Down here i have done my best
I have been to the pool, I've been baptized
I wanna go to heaven and rest
I wanna go to heaven and rest
Down here i have done my best
I have been to the pool, I've been baptized
I wanna go to heaven and rest
I rest I rest I rest
I rest I rest I rest
I rest I rest I rest
I ain't gonna make it through
I rest I rest I rest
I rest I rest I rest
