Climbing the walls not even knowing
What it was I had to find
Wondering if I ever would
There had to be
Some kind of something or someone
Who might bring out the best in me
Only the Greatest ever could
You (then You) caught my eye
With a glow too wonderful to ignore
(Better sight) I took
(In Your light) One look
(Shining down) Through Heaven's door
I never thought I would ever
Stumble out of darkness and prize the view
But this time I found a Gold Mine in You (in You)
This is too much
Hard to believe my life is changing, Lord
But now I've got Your touch
I gotta keep passin' it along
Down (deep down) in my heart
I knew there'd be someone like You someday
(On the move) Hear me
(Knowing You've) Steer me
(Chosen me) Just lead the way

...I have to admit
I never thought I would ever
Chance upon a love I could hold on to
But this time I found a Gold Mine in You
I found a treasure (no one can measure)
But it's true
I can't begin to calculate my wealth
And I never thought I would ever
Stumble out of darkness and prize the view
But this time (I found) I found You
(And finders are keepers)
I never thought I would ever
Chance upon a love I could hold on to
I never thought I would ever
Spot a ray of hope in the residue
I never thought I would ever
Find another prospect to interview
But this time I found a Gold Mine in You
