The one that will make you lick your fingers (Yeah, that's the one)
Maybe there's some flour, eggs and ah, a little brown sugar somewhere
Perhaps some vanilla too but i just know it was good
You know I love a sweet potato pie but i couldn't make one to save my life
Its collared greens and mac and cheese, sure sounds good to me
Don't know everything to use, but I know it worked for true
...if you tired of pain and strife, i know the recipe for life
It only takes One, It only takes One, It only takes One
Stop! Let's revisit
22 players on a football field, that 11 from either team
6 strings on a rhythm guitar, 3 valves make the trumpet scream
10 jerseys in the referees view, better know when your playing hoops
And everybody knows in the Raisin Brand, there's just 2 scoops
88 keys on a baby grand, 5 fingers on a baby's hand
Can't count every grain of sand, or how much hair I got
I dont know how he lights the sky or the formula that keeps the stars in line
But if you tired of the pain and strife, i know the recipe for life
It only takes just one man that they say was from galilee
It only takes one risen savour to purchase you and me
Only One, it only takes one
It only took one cross with 3 nails, one man, 3 days
To satisfy the ransom for my soul
It makes my broken wounded spirit whole
Just one lamb that brings the lost back to the fold
Oh just One, Only, only takes one
One to save my soul
It only takes one
One to make recipe right
It only takes one
One to save my dying soul
