Da-da, da-da, da-da-mmm-da-ooh

When I feel a summer breeze
And I hear it as it whispers through the trees
Well, it causes my heart to fly
Flying like an eagle through the sky

And I know your love is why I feel this way

Just behold a newborn child (So tender and mild)
If devoid of your love I would never see that smile
(I would never see your smile)
Oh, this miracle holiday, I am overwhlemed with your display

And I know your love is why I feel this way

Beauty in this world, often hard to see
Found in little things close to you and me
When I let this love into my heart
With a new point of view, I can start
By your love I can see the way things were meant to be

With your love and by your will
I am forever warm within my heart through winter's chill
And when snow falls from the sky
Crystal images of love go by

And I know your love is why I feel this way
And I know your love is why I feel this way

Close to you and me, oh
When I let this love into my heart
With a new point of view, I can start
By your love I can see, I can see the way things were meant to be

Oh, with your love and by your will
I am forever warm within my heart
Forever warm within my heart through winter's chill
And when snow falls from the sky
Crystal images of love go by

And I know your love is why I feel this way
And I know your love is why I feel this way
And I know your love is why I feel this way
Thank you, Father
I am forever, through the chill, through the chill
Snow falls from the sky
Crystal images of love go by
