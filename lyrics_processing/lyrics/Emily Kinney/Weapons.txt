I'm only human, I need a god
To show me what we want when we fought
From morning to dusk
Our tears causing rust on all of our weapons
And he's just a man but deep in his eyes
I see all this love without the lies
From now till forever
We'd be so much better without the weapons

Empty my gun, dull my knife
Build a house, make a life
We lie in bed and let the record play
I hope that he and I will always be this way

Oh, I'm only human but I've found a match
He doesn't hurt, he doesn't scratch
I'm just some girl but I've found a soul
He doesn't push, he doesn't pull
He's just a man but he's like a savior
That I don't deserve after my bad behavior
He says he's wasted with no money left
But all that I see is perfect
You might also like
Empty my gun, dull my knife
Build a house, make a life
We lie in bed and let the record play
I hope that he and I will always be this way

I am done with the jealousy
Done with the fighting
Done with words that feel just like biting
I have found a new man with a heart he wants to share
It just goes to show life isn't always unfair
I have pumped new blood into this heart for him to take
We're gonna move to California to a house on a lake
And some day we will kiss in front of family and friends
Only cake and champagne and no need
For weapons

Empty my gun, dull my knife
Build a house, make a life
We lie in bed and let the record play
I hope that he and I will always be this way

All these clear-headed thoughts were once home to doubt
Think I finally know what life is about
And it seems smooth sailing where the waters were rough
How the world looks different when you find yourself
In love, in love
In love, in love
