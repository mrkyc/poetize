I've got a pain in my chest
And it doesn't go away
I know just when it started
I can pinpoint the day
Living in a hotel
West Hollywood
He said "I've found a new lover"
Guess we're really done for good

I got your notes on napkins
And my blood on your walls
Our soda glass love could only take so many falls
And my paper bag heart can only take so much rain
Before it drowns, dissolves, gets dragged down the drain

I only wish you the best
But I've got this pain in my chest
It doesn't soften or scab
Lessen or fade
You said you shouldn't sleep over
I still wish you had stayed
You said you shouldn't sleep over
I still wish you had stayed
You might also like
And I've got a song in my head
And it's never done
I tried strumming out the chords
The night we started having fun
It sounds like crickets in the floorboards
Cupcakes in the dark
The drums of fireworks and staircases and Echo Park

Got your notes on napkins
And my blood on your walls
Our soda glass love could only take so many falls
And my paper bag heart can only take so much rain
Before it drowns, dissolves, gets dragged down the drain

I only wish you the best
But I've got this pain in my chest
It doesn't soften or scab
Lessen or fade
You said you shouldn't sleep over
I still wish you had stayed
You said you shouldn't sleep over
I still wish you had stayed
Yeah, my heart is in the gutter
Our love broken on the floor
But I would tape it back together
For a few minutes more
And I would drive downtown
Give up the Hollywood chase
For just a few more hours
Staring at your face
I know you're trying to stay sober
Be as great as can be
But how does your greatest life not include me
How do you go for so long
Not wondering where I am
Do you ever want to start over and fall in love again
Do you ever want to start over and fall in love again
Do you ever want to start over and fall in love again

I only wish you the best
But I've got this pain in my chest
It doesn't soften or scab
Lessen or fade
You said you shouldn't sleep over
I still wish you had stayed
You said you shouldn't sleep over
I still wish you had stayed
Do you ever want to start over and fall in love again
