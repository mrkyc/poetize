I am so confused
I don't know what's up or down
Should I leave or stick around?
Am I lost or am I found?
He's throwin' wisdom like a poet
Throwin' tantrums like a child
But when he holds my hand
My pulse runs red and wild
I was a fighter for my freedom
Now a fool for his touch
He is a nightcap, a brunch buzz, and I'm a lush

Next to the nightstand I'm taking every pill he's got
My head, my heart, my throat, my lungs
My stomach all in a knot
I swore off suitors and the never-ending, needless drugs
I learned my lesson and I thought, "Yeah, I've had enough"
But I'm back on love
Back on love

And I'm losing time, losing weight
I'm a loser for this man
I've been lost since our first date
You might also likeHe is a tight-rope talker, I can't balance at all
He says it's fascinating watching me tip-toe and crawl
He says my ex-boyfriend's boring, he says the moon is the sun
He says anxiety can be the source of lots of fun
My best friend made a list of ways his love is off-track
But I don't give a shit, and I refuse to call that bitch back
He might be messin' in New York
He might be messin' with my head
But I'll do anything to keep him messin' in my bed

Next to the nightstand I'm taking every pill he's got
My head, my heart, my throat, my lungs
My stomach all in a knot
I swore off suitors and the never-ending, needless drugs
I learned my lesson and I thought, "Yeah, I've had enough"
But I'm back on love
Back on love

I've got witches wavin' in my windows
Sky high, I cry, and swear to quit
I've got witches wavin' in my windows
Sky high, I cry, and swear to quit
I've got witches wavin' in my windows
Sky high, I cry, and swear to quit
He calls me up
He calls me "moonlight"
I'm pulling up to Pacsam for one more hit
Next to the nightstand I'm taking every pill he's got
My head, my heart, my throat, my lungs
My stomach all in a knot
I swore off suitors and the never-ending, needless drugs
I learned my lesson and I thought, "Yeah, I've had enough"
But I'm back on love
Back on love
