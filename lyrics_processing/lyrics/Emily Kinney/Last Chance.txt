You've got bad dreams from the broken wedding rings
That you keep under your pillow while you sleep
And there's open spaces, blank faces
When you search for answers on the street

Oh, there's no one left to call
Nothin' much to say
Pretty sure the world is gonna end today
Drink up one last whiskey, head to the dance
Baby, this is our last chance
Baby, this is our last chance

So gimme whatcha, gimme whatcha got tonight
Packin' cigarettes
Baby, I'm your light
Gimme whatcha, gimme whatcha, gimme whatcha can
I'm the last pretty girl
You're the last decent man

I've got broken heart pieces swimming in my bed
Broken conversations floatin' in my head
A let down little mermaid trying to find air at the top
Pretty sure this spinning world's about to stop
So I cover up in glitter, head to the dance
Baby, this is our last chance
Baby, this is our last chance
You might also like
So gimme whatcha, gimme whatcha got tonight
Packin' cigarettes
Baby, I'm your light
Gimme whatcha, gimme whatcha, gimme whatcha can
I'm the last pretty girl
You're the last decent man

When the world is on fire
But your heart is on ice
It's hard to know what's wrong and what's right
But if you wanna feel your blood burn, get to the floor
Scream to God, "I want it more!"
More hurricanes, snow storm, rain in my face
More midnights drunk and dizzy dancin' at your place
A life of fame and fortune and the star of some show
Now it's almost over, almost time to go, oh, go, oh, go oh, go, oh oh, oh...

So gimme whatcha, gimme whatcha got tonight
Packin' cigarettes
Baby, I'm your light
Gimme whatcha, gimme whatcha, gimme whatcha can
Baby, this is our last chance
