Dust in my eyes, tears on my face
Boy next to me says he's been in the same place
Mind just racing in the middle of the night
Wondering what it's gonna look like in the daylight

Wondering if he's on the right path
Wondering how long his luck will last

Baby, that's what I call feeling mortal
Put your head and cry on my shoulder
We can watch the moon turn bright blood red
You can stay the night in my tree-house bed
Oh-oh, oh-oh, he's got my soul in his hands
And oh-oh, Next to Skid Row on a rooftop we slow dance
Is this forever
I'm not at my best
But I'm addicted to the music swear I hear in his chest

Both brilliant on the ground floor
Do pretty well with a closed door
Yeah, it's now or never but tomorrow will change
Go to different cities and rearrange
You might also like
Wondering if he's on the right path
Wondering how long our luck will last

Baby, that's what I call feeling mortal
Put your head and cry on my shoulder
We can watch the moon turn bright blood red
You can stay the night in my tree-house bed
Oh-oh, oh-oh, he's got my soul in his hands
And oh-oh, Next to Skid Row on a rooftop we slow dance
Is this forever
I'm not at my best
But I'm addicted to the music swear I hear in his chest

I swear he's trying to say he loves me
The way he's moving his mouth
I swear he's trying to say he loves me
But the words never come out
I swear he's trying to say he loves me
The way he's moving his mouth
I swear he's trying to say he loves me
But the words never come out

Baby, that's what I call feeling mortal
Put your head and cry on my shoulder
We can watch the moon turn bright blood red
You can stay the night in my tree-house bed
Oh-oh, oh-oh, he's got my soul in his hands
And oh-oh, Next to Skid Row on a rooftop we slow dance
Is this forever
I'm not at my best
But I'm addicted to the music swear I hear in his chest
I swear he's trying to say he loves me
But the words never come out
I swear he's trying to say he loves me
But the words never come out
I swear he's trying to say he loves me
