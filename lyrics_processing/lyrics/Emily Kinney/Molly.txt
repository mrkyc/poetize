Oh, oh I know about Molly cause she told my friend
That she was hooking up with you on the weekend
Guess those stories that you told me turned out not to be true
You say you're done with Molly
Well, I am done with you

Oh, I know about Molly
She likes to sing and get high
She likes to kiss my boyfriend
When he comes walking by
Woah-oh, I know about Molly
So, just confess it out loud
You're so guilt-stricken, crying on the corner
Do you feel better now?

Oh, you were working with Molly when you said she's just a buddy
Never thought you were the type to fuck an understudy
Molly's so naive, she don't know wrong from right
And when your girlfriend's out of town she's at your place all night
Oh, oh, oh NYU, LaGuardia, to so Broadway bound
But she keeps taking shitty gigs that I turned down
I hope you love her face
I hope you dig her voice
You say you're done with Molly
Well, I have made another choice
You might also like
Oh, I know about Molly
She likes to sing and get high
She likes to kiss my boyfriend
When he comes walking by
Woah-oh, I know about Molly
So, just confess it out loud
You're so guilt-stricken, crying on the corner
Do you feel better now?

Oh, Molly, you can have him, you're much cooler than me
I never liked staying out smoking weed till 3
So, take my boots in his closet like you took my man
It's clear you don't mind wearing things secondhand
And I'm not looking for a winner, or a loser, or a forfeit
But my heart's in little pieces so I hope that it was worth it
Hope you're happy together cause I'm doing alright
But you both should stay away from the Lower East Side

Cause I know about Molly
She likes to sing and get high
She likes to kiss my boyfriend
When he comes walking by
Woah-oh, I know about Molly
So, just confess it out loud
You're so guilt-stricken, crying on the corner
Do you feel better now?
Do you feel better now?
