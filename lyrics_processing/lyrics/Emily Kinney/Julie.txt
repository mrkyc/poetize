Let go of Julie and take my hand
Let go, it's time to be my man
Let go of Julie and kiss my face
She is standing, she is standing in my place

And I'm not normally the jealous jealous type
But I'd imagined it'd be you and me tonight
And I'll bet Julie's really smart, oh you keep saying she's so cool
But if you pick her over me you're just a fool

So take home Julie we'll be drinking at 2
Take home Julie, we got catching up to do
Just take home Julie, take up my heart
I'm ready I'm ready to start

I said I was alone and you just laughed out loud
How do broken hearts make you so proud
Left a comfy bed, I left my lover of a year
To be with, be with you here

And I'm not normally the jealous jealous type
But you deserve a girl with matching sparkly eyes
A girl who makes you dance 'til dawn and who makes wanna write a song
And if you think that that is Julie you're wrong
You might also like
So take home Julie we'll be drinking at 2
Take home Julie, we got catching up to do
Just take home Julie, take up my heart
I'm ready I'm ready to start
So take home Julie we'll be drinking at 2
Take home Julie, we got catching up to do
Just take home Julie, take up my heart
I'm ready I'm ready to start

I'm staring at the ground as she walks right by
You're staring at me next, I refuse to say hi
I'm just staring in to space cause all I got on my mind
Elevator kisses, summer summer time
Elevator kisses, you and I

And I'm not normally the jealous jealous sort
But if we're picking favorites, I am yours
And I know Julie doesn't drink and I'm just hanging at the bar
So go ahead and call up Julie a car
Yeah go ahead and call up Julie a car

So take home Julie we'll be drinking at 2
Take home Julie, we got catching up to do
Just take home Julie, take up my heart
I'm ready I'm ready to start
So take home Julie we'll be drinking at 2
Take home Julie, we got catching up to do
Just take home Julie, take up my heart
I'm ready I'm ready to start
