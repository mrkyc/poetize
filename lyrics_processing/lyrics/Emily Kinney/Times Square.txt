Buy you a coffee? Lend you some money?
Walk you to Times Square, walk to the moon? What can I, what can I, what
Can I do what can I do?
Oh, it's been a long time, but it's been about right. You're looking like
You need a kiss or a fight
Without my love you don't know how to live
Is there somebody, somebody else who could make it worth it?
Somebody else? Somebody else? Somebody else?

And I know you're alone, most of the day
I know you spend night the very same way
I know you're not with somebody new, I won't break his heart to fix you
And I think, and I prey, about last September
As time goes by, I barely remember
And I know that you say you would change that night
But I was never yours and you're no longer mine
Oh, I'd like to kiss you, but my lips are purple
And I'd like to love you, but our love is spent
And we wasted our wishes, hurt our best friends, made a home in heart ache
And now can't pay the rent

I'm not a movie star, pretty play bunny
I'm just a lucky hack fooling myself
If you want perfection look to somebody else
Somebody else, somebody else, somebody else

And I know you're alone, most of the day
I know you spend night the very same way
I know you're not with somebody new
I won't break his heart to fix you
And I think, and I prey, about last September
As time goes by, I barely remember
And I know you say you would change that night
But I was never yours and you're no longer mine
So, what can I, what can I do for you, honey?
Buy you a coffee? Lend you some money?
Walk you to Times Square, walk to the moon?
What can I, what can I, what can I, what can I, what can I, what can I
