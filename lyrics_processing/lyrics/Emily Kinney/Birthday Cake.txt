Would you be my band?
Travel the world together
You can hold my hand
Crossing cracks from the airplane
To the terminal gate
Hope we're meant for each other
Hope that love is our fate
Life feels like a whirlwind
Been watching paint dry
Can't steady the current
No matter how hard I try
We could all use an anchor
You're not afraid of the sea
Let's both dive in together
Put your hooks in me

Boy you really got me after birthday cake
Making love on my friends new couch
So call me any night, any day of the week
I wanna learn what you're all about
And I know I'm far away but this is just the start
And if we make it past the first little part
We could fly around the world in the very same plane
We could share a life, share a name
You might also like(Ooooh, ooh-ooh
Ooooh, ooh-ooh.)
I wanna live in New York City
When I'm old and gray
You say you're gonna come visit me
See a Broadway play
Snow has just started falling
Hope you'll come around soon
My apartment is tiny
But I think there's enough room
For you

Yeah boy you really got me after birthday cake
Making love on my friends spare bed
And I can't seem to shake walking Echo Park Lake
Or get your face, outta my head
And I know I'm far away but this is just the start
And if we make it past the first little part
We could fly around the world in the very same plane
We could share a life, share a name
(Ooooh, ooh-ooh
Ooooh, ooh-ooh.)
Am I saying too much, way too soon?
Well my only confidant is this empty room
And my only response is the echo on my voice
When I'm falling in love it's like I have no choice
From my heart to my throat to my lips to the air
I don't wish for much, but I wish you were here
We need to check this out, oh, check me in
I'm not into playing games but I do fight to win

And boy you really got me after birthday cake
Making love on my friends spare bed
And I can't seem to shake walking Echo Park Lake
Or get your face, outta my head
And I know I'm far away but this is just the start
And if we make it past the first little part
We could fly around the world in the very same plane
We could share a life, share a name
(Mmm mm mm mm mm mmm mmmm
