I didn't know what to say
Didn't know what to do
When I saw a picture of Katy B. kissin' you
Basically my face went numb
Can't get any work here done
Forget about sleepin,' forget about eatin'
Forget as I try
I cry and I cry
I really might die all alone
From a picture on a phone

Should I make a will
Notify my family and friends?
You put the nail in the coffin
And this just might be the end
Make a toast to my heart
It's taken quite a beating
But it's in a better place now
Without the breaking and the leaving
Oh, it's not quite how I imagined I would go
From a picture on a phone

I asked if you could take it down
But you like watching me drown
I'm out here swimmin'
Do you mind lending me a branch?
Yeah, I'm in the deep end
Nothing is movin'
Could you reconsider this tiny gesture?
Give me a fighting chance!

Should I make a will
Notify my family and friends?
You put the nail in the coffin
And this just might be the end
Make a toast to my heart
It's taken quite a beating
But it's in a better place now
Without the breaking and the leaving
Oh, it's not quite how I imagined I would go
From a picture on a phone

I'm sure you'll revel at your name in my poems
Just a feather in your cap to keep you going
'Cause love has given you wings
But it's knocked the wind right out of me
I'm lying in the dark, broken-hearted
Why can't you ever just finish what you started?
Yeah, next time don't halfway it!
Intercourse fully naked!
Post it for the world and all our friends and me to see
Stab me three more times and then just leave me here to bleed
Oh, it's not quite how I imagined I would go
From a picture on a phone
Should I make a will
Notify by family and friends?
You put the nail in the coffin
And this just might be the end
Make a toast to my heart
It's taken quite a beating
But it's in a better place now
Without the breaking and the leaving
Oh, it's not quite how I imagined I would go
