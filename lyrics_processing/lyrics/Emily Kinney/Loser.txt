How does it feel to be a loser
How does it feel to be a hack
A lovesick self-abuser
But now I'll never be back
How does it feel to be rejected
The way I was so many nights
Pretending not to hear me whisper
I love you's by your side

Boy, I really miss you
I miss you so much
But I know you're never gonna miss me
So I flew across the world and fucked around with some Brit
Just to have this epiphany

How does it feel to be a has-been
When you were once a rock star
How does it feel to be sober
When everyone's having fun drunk at the bar
How does it feel to be an old man
Lines running down your face
No matter how many miles you run
You'll never get back in shape
You might also like
Boy, I really miss you
I miss you so much
But I know you're never gonna miss me
So I flew across the world and fucked around with some Brit
Just to have this epiphany

How does it feel to have a small dick
Cause by now I've seen others
I got a tall, dark millionaire man
With smart skills under the covers
How does it feel to be jealous
Disqualified from the race
I know in just a few years
You'll be the one back on the chase

How does it feel to be a loser
How does it feel to be a hack
How does it feel to be rejected
How does it feel to be a has-been
How does it feel to be sober
How does it feel to be an old man
How does it feel to have a small dick
How does it feel to be jealous
How does it feel to be a loser
How does it feel to be a hack
A lovesick, self-abuser
But now I'll never be back
I'll never be back
