We can't stop eating the candy, we can't stop making out
The girl in the corner knows the story about the first night we met, she keeps asking "weren't you together yet?"
And I've got my hands in your heart, you've got your hands in my hair, I don't know these people let them stare
And I've got you me wrapped up in your chest we keep whispering when we're together yet
Should we get married tonight? Once we've drank all the wine
Would you marry me an always be mine
It's such a nice night in brooklyn and we shouldn't be alone
Let's get married baby, married and go home
And then the moon could be our witness and north fifth street our isle, the stars will cheer and cry and smile
Oh, our friends will feel left out and our parents had no warning but we'll calm them with the good news in the morning
So let's get married tonight, once we've drank all the wine
Would you marry me and always be mine
It's such a nice night in brooklyn and we shouldn't be alone
Let's get married baby, married and go home
I don't really be at this party anymore
We're running out of jelly beans and there's no one left to pour
Oh we don't want to be at this party anymore
Make up lies and say goodbye and meet me at the door
And let's get married tonight once we've drank all the wine
Would you marry me and always be mine?
It's such a nice night in brooklyn and we shouldn't be alone
