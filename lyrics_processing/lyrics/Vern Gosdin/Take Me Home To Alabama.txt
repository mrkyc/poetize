I do love my Ma and Pa
Not the way that I do love you
Well, holy moly me oh my
You're the apple of my eye
Girl, I've never loved one like you
Man, oh, man, you're my best friend
I scream it to the nothingness
There ain't nothing that I need
Well, hot and heavy pumpkin pie
Chocolate candy, Jesus Christ
Ain't nothing please me more than you
Home, let me come home
Home is wherever I'm with you
Home, let me come home
Home is wherever I'm with you
La la la la
Take me home
Mama, I'm coming home
I'll follow you into the park
Through the jungle, through the dark
Girl, I've never loved one like you
You might also likeMoats and boats, and waterfalls
Alleyways, and payphone calls
I been everywhere with you (that's true)
Laugh until we think we'll die
Barefoot on a summer night
Never could be sweeter than with you
And in the streets you run afree
Like it's only you and me
Geez, you're something to see
Home, let me come home
Home is wherever I'm with you
Home, let me come home
Home is wherever I'm with you
La la la la
Take me home
Mama, I'm coming home
- Jade?
- Alexander?
- Do you remember that day you fell outta my window?
- I sure do-you came jumping out after me
- Well, you fell on the concrete, nearly broke your ass, and you were bleeding all over the place, and I rushed you out to the hospital, you remember that?
- Yes, I do
- Well, there's something I never told you about that night
- What didn't you tell me?
- Well, while you were sitting in the back seat smoking a cigarette you thought was gonna be your last, I was falling deep, deeply in love with you, and I never told you till just now!
Home, let me come home
Home is wherever I'm with you
Home, let me come home
Home is wherever I'm with you
Home, let me come home
Home is wherever I'm with you
Our home, yes, I am home
Home is when I'm alone with you
Alabama, Arkansas
I do love my Ma and Pa
Moats and boats, and waterfalls
Alleyways, and payphone calls
Home is when I'm alone with you!
