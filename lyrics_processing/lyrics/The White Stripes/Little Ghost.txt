Little ghost, little ghost, one I'm scared of the most
Can you scare me up a little bit of love?
I'm the only one that sees you and I can't do much to please you
And it's not yet time to meet the Lord above

The first moment that I met her, I did not expect a specter
When I shook her hand I really shook a glove
She looked into me so sweetly and we left the room discreetly
No one else could know the secret of our love

Little ghost, little ghost, one I'm scared of the most
Can you scare me up a little bit of love?
I'm the only one that sees you and I can't do much to please you
And it's not yet time to meet the Lord above

Every morning I awoke and I see my little ghost
Wondering if it's really her that's lying there
I lean to touch her and I whisper but not brave enough to kiss her
When I held her I was really holdin' air

Little ghost, little ghost, one I'm scared of the most
Can you scare me up a little bit of love?
I'm the only one that sees you and I can't do much to please you
And it's not yet time to meet the Lord above

Though I tried my best to keep it, there really was no secret
Must have looked like I was dancing with the wall
No one else could see this apparition
But because of my condition
I fell in love with a little ghost and that was all

Little ghost, little ghost, one I'm scared of the most
Can you scare me up a little bit of love?
I'm the only one that sees you and I can't do much to please you
And it's not yet time to meet the Lord above
