Oh, well

Well, women and children need kisses
Not the man in my life I know
And I been goin' to mystery misses
I respect the art of the show
Take back what you said, little girl
And while you're at it take yourself back too
Well, I'm tired of sitting here waiting
Woman, what you going to do now, what you going to do about it?

And I'm thinkin' about my doorbell
When you gonna ring it, and when you gonna ring it
Yeah, I'm thinkin' about my doorbell
When you gonna ring it, yeah, when you gonna ring it, oh

You don't seem to come around
Point your finger and make a sound
You don't seem to come around
Knock, knock, since you knocked it down
Oh, well

Make a sound and I'll make you feel right
Right at home, yeah
Yeah, right at home, yeah

Nobody's got me waitin' in pain
But how come it's so easy to you
You don't strike me as the type to be callous
But your words seem so obtuse
But then again, I know you feel guilty
And you tell me you want me again
But I don't need any of your pity
I got plenty of my own friends, they're all above me

And I been thinkin' about my doorbell
When they're gonna ring it, when they're gonna ring it
Yeah, I been thinkin' about the doorbell
When they're gonna ring it, and when they're gonna ring it, oh
I been thinkin' about the doorbell
When they're gonna ring it, when they're gonna ring it
Yeah, I been thinkin' about the doorbell
Oh, well
They don't seem to come around
Push the finger and make a sound
They don't seem to come around
Maybe then they'll knock 'em down
Oh, well

Make a sound and I'll make you feel right
Right at home
Right at home

I'm thinkin' about my doorbell
When you gonna ring it, and when you gonna ring it
