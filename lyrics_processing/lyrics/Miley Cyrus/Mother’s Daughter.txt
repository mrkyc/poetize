Oh my God, she got the power
Oh, look at her, she got the power

I'm nasty, I'm evil
Must be something in the water or that I'm my mother's daughter
Don't fuck with my freedom
I came up to get me some
I'm nasty, I'm evil
Must be something in the water or that I'm my mother's daughter

So, back up, back up, back up, back up, boy, ooh
Back up, back up, back up, back up, boy, ooh

Hallelujah, I'm a witch, I'm a witch, hallelujah
Swish swish, I'm a three-point shooter, I blow through ya
Like a hot wind out in the bayou, yah
