'Round and 'round and away we go
'Round and 'round and away we go
Four-by-four and away we go
High, not low, and away we go
'Round and 'round and away we go
And away we go and away we go
Four-by-four and away we go
High, not low, and away we go

I'm a female rebel, can't you tell?
Bang on the dashboard, just chipped a nail
Lean out the window, that's when I yell
Drivin' so fast, 'bout to piss on myself
Drivin' so fast, 'bout to piss on myself
Police wanna get him and put him in jail
I'ma do whatever to get him his bail
Hooked on donuts and rooster tails

I'm in that passenger seat, ridin' high in the air
And we're drivin' fast 'til we plumb outta gas, let's go

'Round and 'round and away we go
'Round and 'round and away we go
Four-by-four and away we go
High, not low, and away we go
'Round and 'round and away we go
And away we go and away we go
Four-by-four and away we go
High, not low, and away we go

I'm a female rebel, can't you see?
Ridin' 'round your backyard, who could it be?
Pullin' on the steerin' wheel, wrapped 'round the seat
Pumpin' his breaks to the sound of the beat
Pumpin' his breaks to the sound of the beat
He don't understand what he's doin' to me
Deep down inside, like a pitbull in heat
Someone's comin', so we head for the streets

I'm in that passenger seat, flyin' high in the air
And we're drivin' fast 'til we plumb outta gas, let's go (Oh)

'Round and 'round and away we go (Yeah)
'Round and 'round and away we go
Four-by-four and away we go
High, not low, and away we go (Woo)
'Round and 'round and away we go
And away we go and away we go
Four-by-four and away we go
High, not low, and away we go

It's twelve o'clock and I don't want to party
My big boyfriend and my big truck hobby
A little bit of dirt never hurt nobody
Now I got dirt all over my body
Might as well lie to L
His big fog lights is bright as hell
Calls the law, he starts to yell (Mm, yeah)
He hits the gas, so I grab the rail
Sure you wanna ride with me?
If you scared, don't lie to me
I'm a crazy motherfucker from the Midwest
With a Mississippi flow and a Arch rest
Four-by-four with the altar steps
We doin' donuts underneath the arch (Yes)
I need a chick on time, don't mind bein' early
A ride-or-die, dollar six-thirty
A straight-up chick like twelve o'clock
"I don't know where he at," that's what she tell the cops
Take a stand for a nigga, raise a hand for a nigga
"I solemnly swear he was with me all day"
To the judge, "He the one I love"
Hell, they could tell, she don't even budge
'Round and 'round we go
Don't stop 'til I tell you so

I'm in that passenger seat, flyin' high in the air
And we're drivin' fast 'til we plumb outta gas, let's go (Yeah)

'Round and 'round and away we go
'Round and 'round and away we go
Four-by-four and away we go
High, not low, and away we go
'Round and 'round and away we go
And away we go and away we go
Four-by-four and away we go
High, not low, and away we go
I'm a female rebel, can't you tell?
Ooh, can't you tell? Ooh, can't you tell?
I'm a female rebel, ooh, can't you tell?
