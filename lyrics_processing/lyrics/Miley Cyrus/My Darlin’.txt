Why don't you stand (Mike WiLL Made-It), stand by me ?
Oh, my darlin'
Stand by me

I walked through a puddle of water
When I seen the shadow of a broken-hearted girl
Pictured us walking to the altar
For better or for worse

Why don't you stand, stand by me?
Oh, my darlin', stand by me
'Cause we gon' make a movie, a movie
And it's gon' be in 3D, in 3D
And we gon' make a movie, a movie
And it's gon' be in 3D, in 3D

Why don't you stand, stand by me?
Oh, my darlin', stand by me

I ain't pop no Molly
But you still got me sweating
What happened to that feeling?
We'll never get it back
I ain't take no shots, but you still got me hot
What happened to the feeling?
I wish it wouldn't stop
We were supposed to be together
We were supposed to be together, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Plenty odds are running out of time

Oh, my darlin', stand by me
'Cause we gon' make a movie, a movie
