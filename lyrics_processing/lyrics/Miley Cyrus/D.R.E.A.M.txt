You're in my bed uninvited
It's fine 'cause I'm in the mood
Hope you don't mind if I spike it
We'll drink it, just me and you

And you know we're gonna be alright
We'll be sleeping on a red-eye flight
Keep up with me 'til the end of the night
And we're just gettin' started

Always last to leave the party
Drugs rule everything around me
Wake up with new tattoos on my body
Drugs rule everything around me
Hit the Goose, raise a toast, pop the molly
I can go toe-to-toe, like I'm Ali
We're all tryna fill the lonely
Drugs rule everything around me

Drugs rule everything around me
Drugs rule everything around me

These planes are all UFOs
And this city's in outer space
It's better than where we came from
I think that we both should stay

'Cause you know we're gonna be alright
We'll be fucking on a red-eye flight
Keep up with me 'til the end of the night
And we're just gettin' started

Always last to leave the party
Drugs rule everything around me
Wake up with new tattoos on my body
Drugs rule everything around me
Hit the ghost, raise a toast, pop the molly
All the girls in my room look like Dolly
We're all tryna fill the lonely
Drugs rule everything around me

(Drugs rule everything around me)
Drugs rule everything around me
Drugs rule everything around me
Drugs rule everything around me
Drugs rule everything around me
Drugs rule everything around me
You could call me a king
I got it all in my store, you should crown me
Purple Perc, sticky green mollies, sippy lean
Got the white that's sure to light the floor like in "Billie Jean"
Scarface nights (Nights)
500 thousand on the pinkie, Broadway ice (Ice)
We throw diamonds at weddings and y'all throw rice (Rice)
Lollapalooza, Coachella custies, that's my type
