Ooh-ooh-ooh
Yeah, huh-huh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

I feel a surge coming over me
I feel it all around my thighs
And chills going up my legs
This is the worst coming out of me
When I came, felt like I could die
And it sends chills up my spine

You're sexy, sexy
I got things I wanna do to you
Make me, make me
Make my tongue just go do-do-do
Flex it, flex it
Flex your muscles, and go through the roof
Arrest it, -rest it, 'cause this shit is criminal

I been laying in this bed all night long
Don't you think it's time to get it on?
But we gotta get it right, we can't get it wrong
Don't you wanna fuel this fire before it's gone? Yeah, yeah
You might also like
I feel the thirst pouring out of me
The things that I wanna try
That echoes in my head
This is the first time I get to see
Things I've never seen in my life, yeah
You make flowers grow under my bed, yeah

You're sexy, sexy
I got things I wanna do to you
Make me, make me
Make my tongue just go do-do-do
Flex it, flex it
Flex your muscles, and go through the roof
Arrest it, -rest it, 'cause this shit is criminal

Do you feel me?

Sometimes you just wanna
Be naughty

I feel so alone when you are gone
Feeling right back home when I'm in your arms
You played my strings, like my guitar
When I look in your eyes, I see all the stars

Would you believe
I'm dancing in the mirror? (Dancing in the mirror)
I feel like I got no panties on
I wish that I could feel ya (Wish that I could feel ya)
So hurry, hang up that damn phone

All night long (All night long)
Don't you think it's time? It's time to get it on
But we gotta get it right, we can't get it wrong

Going on and on and make it last forever
What you want all day?
Just as long as it's you and I together
Babe, don't make me wait, yeah
Ooh, oh
