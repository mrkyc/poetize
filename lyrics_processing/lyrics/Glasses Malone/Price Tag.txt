Bitch cruise the drop can't believe this motherfucker flop
Got a nigga hot
Tryna figure who to blame
This my life niggas treat it as a game
Took the pistol at my brain, as the hammer pill back
If I don't kill me imma go kill mac
And his kid will feel that, They ain't did nothing to me
Fuck! I Can't believe I let the pressure get to me
So it comes down to this live life as a failure
Nobody home, death the only shelter
I Phone yelling nigga pick me up
But luckily I answer like "Nigga What The Fuck!?"
I got a deal you couldn't possibly refuse
But will a nigga ball ?
You will get your own shoe
What about the plaques, grammy's, groupies ?
Let me direct and we gon' make a movie
But when we start shooting ? what's the pay for the picture
Everlasting fame, power and riches
Gucci belts for your brethren
If you want in, just sign the contract
Where the motherfucking pen?

Single drop? I could tell shit was different
No single? niggas wouldn't trip
Now the new single got the whole club flipping
And shit where the hoes? hoes get to stripping
I don't get distribute 6 figures first week
Niggas on my nuts, bitches want the meet
Award nominations, front row seats
Best artist in the game begging me for a feature
All I get is love, All I get is checks
I Phone ringing, that's when I get attached
Don't forget who your ass is really signed too
You ungrateful, must I remind you ?
Hell naw, I don't need no reminder
I'm all lifestyle, clothes all designer
Slide to the stage to accept my award
As I go to thank God, a disturbance on the floor
And this award goes to... GLASSES MALOOONE (yeaah)
That's what I'm talking bout
(First off, I just wanted to thank you God
Get your hands outta my pocket...
Get your hands outta my pocket nigga!
Wtf? aye nigga calm down
Oh shit!)
(bang!)

Thinks we do for the millions, now I'm staring at the ambulance ceiling
Pressure keep building as they tryna stop the bleeding
They tryna keep me breathing
Beat start to slow, as my heart start to go
Flat line a nigga gone, that's what you get from selling shit you don't own

Everybody got a price tag
Nigga name your price
Everybody got a price tag
Nigga name your price
Everybody got a price tag
Nigga name your price
Everybody got a price tag
