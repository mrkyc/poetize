GMX (S-S-Six 'n the mornin')
GMX (Dolla $ign)

Bitch, thug life
Lot of niggas say they thuggin', they don't thug right
Fhe want a real thug, bands in my jeans
Flood your town with that water for the green
Rag seis-uno, this motherfucker clean
Cup full of Pruno, like I'm fresh up out the bing
Sit that hoe down when it's time to go and get 'em
And bro, I never send 'em, I'm in the car with 'em
Fuck boss, I'm a leader, lean by the liter
Hoes poppin' shit, that's gon' get your nigga beat up
E.S. with the B.S., these niggas can't see us
I'm a real nigga, the rap game need us
At the dinner table, my niggas tryna eat up
And like Tray Deee, I still keep it G'd Up
L to the A, double dollar sign east
Teddy bear with these bitches
On you niggas, I'm a beast (Ah)

I'm goin' off the deep end
Still sell a lil' dope on the weekend
Got your main bitch with me, she freaky, freaky
All night, we geekin', geekin'
Till six 'n the mornin', six 'n the mornin'
Six 'n the mornin', six 'n the mornin'
(Most niggas don't really fuck with me, Glasses)
Till six 'n the mornin', six 'n the mornin'
Six 'n the mornin', yeah
You might also like
Get your bang on, nigga, let your nuts hang
I give a fuck about your hood, that's on everythin'
Don't ask me what's good, ain't shit sweet
I ain't never alone, I'm like six deep
Black hoodie, black mask, black gloves
Talk shit, get bodied, no love
Kind of ill like blood in my bath
The psych say sociopath
Cali nigga from the bottom, put it on the map
Lowridin', Crip walkin', that's a fuckin' fact
I'm only happy when this lead flying out the strap
I'm addicted to punishment and pay back
I'm a sucker for war, I love conflict
I love the way my wrist feel when that Glock kick
Death threats, vendettas & pain
Dreams of killin' half the niggas in the rap game
My nigga, Glasses Malone, said "let's get cake"
Iceberg on your track equals yellow tape
My nigga, Glasses Malone, said "let's get cake"
Iceberg on your track equals yellow tape

I'm goin' off the deep end
Still sell a lil' dope on the weekend
Got your main bitch with me, she freaky, freaky
All night, we geekin', geekin'
Till six 'n the mornin', six 'n the mornin'
Six 'n the mornin', six 'n the mornin'
Till six 'n the mornin', six 'n the mornin'
Six 'n the mornin', yeah
Bad little bitch that I'm bonin'
Gotta get her out of my bed before six 'n the mornin'
Room number four-two-izzo
Pussy was good but you still gotta gizzo (Gotta go)
Snoopy this, Snoopy that, Snoop want, Snoopy do
Shout out to the homie, Big Snoopy Blue
See I'm a Eastside Long Beach, Rip Ridin', gang bang affiliate
I peel 'em when i kill him when I fill him with the calm of a storm
One hundred million Rips, rise and reform
See this the G-Call, no iPhones
Khakis, Chucks or some nikes on
Dress code, West Coast, head up
Shooters on the roof for the set up, now throw it up
Crip, Crip, Crip, don't trip
