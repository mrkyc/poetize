They already know me, S-A-G-E
Woah, tell her gas pedal, gas pedal
Uh

And I'll shoot your face off
Turn the TV on and watch Face Off
Ain't that a bitch?
Thirsty nigga buy a slurpee, wish you had a bitch
Only time you get her wet is if you had a fish
I got horse like  got a corner store
But you niggas power ranger, yelling mighty morph
Black money , how we winnin', wish you had a score
Ah-heh, damn, okay
I'm bossy, your girl tryna boss me
Spaghetti, no noodles, no meat, hoe, I'm saucy
Me and shawty catchin' all the looks, Randy Moss-y
I be basket-balling, so try to double cross me
I go blind lookin' left, I look so right
Shinin' on a nigga, I be so bright
Throw up the W, yeah, take sides
And I'd be damned if a weak nigga take mines

Treat it like Rihanna!
Beat it up, beat it up
'Cause playin' with the pussy ain't enough
I'ma treat it like Rihanna!
Bitch, call me Chris Brown
She love how a nigga put it down
When I treat it like Rihanna (Rihanna, Rihanna, Rihanna, Rihanna, Rihanna, Rihanna)
Treat it like Rihanna (Rihanna, Rihanna, Rihanna, Rihanna, Rihanna, Rihanna)
Treat it like Rihanna

You fuck boys counterfeit

And I count, count money like a bank
 760 gettin' head from a skank
I can tell you what it is and I can tell you what it ain't (Tell you what it ain't)
Catch you to that telly, girl, it's on til you faint, ha
Put you on a frame, have you open like a Walmart
Kno-knock it out the ballpark

Beggin' me to beat it up
I'ma treat it like Rihanna!

Treat it like Rihanna!
Beat it up, beat it up
