Akon and Glasses... uh huh

Niggas spit fairy tale, G issue the facts
Not Jeezy but I sold my fair issue of crack
Not Weezy but Malone got dat Hustler Muzik
And them hustlers use it, serve customers to it
Went from 2 to 300, got the Mexicans down
Hundred Crips, hundred Bloods, hundred Mexicans now
Hundred round in the clip, man who wanna get dumb
With the New West breds on these A-Town drums
With the New West breds that he callin' to play
And we sackin' wack rappers, niggas call it a day
Down south call 'em choppers, home - call it a K
Either way, ambulances come and haul 'em away
This Blu Division bitch, I'm the soul of the crew
Honeygirls on my heels like the soul of my shoe
Got Toomp in da kitchen, let it simmer and cook
Now 'Kon break it on down and deliver the hook (Let's go~!!)

I ain't for all that beefin'
Got niggas to bust your head for no reason
Ask around the streets, man I'm certified
Cross seas, all my customers are satisfied
See I ain't for all that beefin'
Matter of fact, I'm trying to chill with the squeezin'
Ask around the hood, man I'm certified
And I'd hate to have to put a bullet in your mind

Got the Bloods on my team, who gon' fuck with cuz?
I'm heavy in the streets, nigga fuck the club
I make G's bounce and wanna buck the snub
Takin' down everything, you spending bucks to plug
I was just a little pissed I didn't sign with Jay
A mil' plus, couple months, feelin' fine today
Mil' plus, couple blunts, they say he runnin' the hood
And I'm laughin at you rap niggas runnin' from Suge
Talk greasy on your records, stop pushin me ho
Face to face, turn bitch, you lil' pussies expose
You a mark, I'm a G, so when you pop ya checks
You can buy any car but not the streets respect
One of few gangsta rappers that the streets respect
And plaques and nothin' less is what the streets expect
Got Toomp in da kitchen let it simmer and cook
Now 'Kon break it on down and deliver the hook (Let's go~!!)

I ain't for all that beefin'
Got niggas to bust your head for no reason

Watt's up lil mama? Watt's up?
Watt's up lil mama? Watt's up?
Watt's up lil mama? Watt's up?
You won't find another nigga spittin' Eastier shit
I'm hot on the West, hot in the South
Fuck bars, nigga hot for puttin' Glocks in ya mouth
Fuck bars, it's the flow, so easy and smooth
Charismatic on the mic like Eazy and Cube
No attitude though, fuck stoppin' the grind
No whitey in my mix, homie, robbing me blind
Go hyphy in this bitch, only problem is time
Cause my Bentley watch broke but got the properest shine
In the base model 5 but the BRABUS in line
Once I made back ends, it's the Maybach Benz
Got Toomp in da kitchen, let it simmer and cook
Now 'Kon break it on down and deliver the hook (Let's go~!!)
