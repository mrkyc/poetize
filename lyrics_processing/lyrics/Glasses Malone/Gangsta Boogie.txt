Glass - I keep it one double-zero (100)
The hood hero
Waterboy, damn a torpedo
Still pull and shoot. that's heat tho
I get rid of that weight, that's ki tho
Big cuz, hynas call me primo
Forever in the set, they eradicating gringos
Give yo baby mamas a shoulder she can lean on
Big dick long enough for her to swing from
She deserve mouth and lip service
As you can see, I'm me on purpose
My advice is for you to be you
Buick GNX when the locs be through
Fuck a foreign and all that weak shit
Thats a car note, nigga this a pink slip
50 foot cigs. have a sweet dip
Tell pig zip
Loose lips sink ships

Nigga can tell I want the smoke by the double exhaust
Imma keep it gangsta, give a fuck what it costs
7 bullet holes, a few still in me
Swervin off the remmy, nigga gassing up the hemi
Clutchin' on the semi, nigga this my everyday
You know the motto "to live and die in LA"
Let me talk my shit tho
Chucks with the braids, kill me in broad day
That's on 
If you know, you know
RIP 
12 on my dick so I keep the low tint
Brack the window hit 'em with the fent
I don't give a fein none, if k9 smell the scent
Outlaw shit, like Gaddafi and them niggas
Ask smokers in my hood
"On Bompton, he the nigga"
All I ever needed was my balls and my Glock
'til I'm 90 years old, this gang shit don't stop
 x2
I keep it (gangsta boogie)
