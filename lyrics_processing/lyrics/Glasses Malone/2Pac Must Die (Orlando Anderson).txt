For over twenty years, you've heard one side of the story
Now hear mine's
{Gunshot}

En route to a bout to watch Tyson do his thizzle
Vegas vacation, it was just to clear my mental
Four negroes deep, white Cadillac rental
Out the city where they stretchin' youngin's out like a limo
(Where? Compton) City where I'm from
Never leave home without it, fuck Amex, I'm talkin' guns
Pedal dope for the funds, keep my loc'in' on the one
Sucka try and play me, either smoke him or get dumb
But he done, best go the other way
Caught a opp in the mall the other day
Just lackin', clunky head from all this smackin'
And this chain, just a casualty of all the action
Now my trophy, ass whoopin's how you win it, and (Ayy)
To keep it real, my nigga, I look better in it, and (Ayy)
Ain't no price you could pay to get it back (Get it back)
Never catch me goin' out like that

(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
(Bah-ah, ba-dah ah-ah)
Never catch me goin' out like that
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
(Bah-ah, ba-dah ah-ah)

MGM, bellin' dolo like a G should
Other homies went to dine, you know we eat good
On the prowl, now I'm fresh up out the fire
Spot some ass, I like to get up out them tires
See this trece on my jersey, south is what I rep
All these people walkin' 'round me, bet nobody step
Two Cs, whether solo or I'm with the clique
Because my whole city knowin' that I'm with the shit
Same go for Vegas, all these haters give me looks
Turn around, see a rapper on approach but I ain't shook (No)
Mobbin' with that nigga from the mall that we bucked
Number one can get the jab, number two can get the hook
But Suge right behind along with four more opps
Niggas jumped me like rope, kicked me like rocks
Casino guards made 'em stop and I pray the law don't end the act
'Cause I ain't goin' out like that

(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
(Bah-ah, ba-dah ah-ah)
'Cause I ain't goin' out like that
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
(Bah-ah, ba-dah ah-ah)
Now I meet up with the homies, let them niggas know the deal
Enemy gon' jump me, so la sangra gotta spill
Because he rap, fuck, that nigga think he ill?
I'ma show him that this Crippin' shit for real
Forty Glock Veil, choice of weapon for revenge
Justice want him killed, my ego want suspense
These niggas poppin' pills or they shootin' heroin
Thinkin' I'ma let this slide, so these corners, bro, we bend
Lookin' for the mothafucka's club: 662
Posted in the parkin' lot, upon arrival we gon' shoot
S'posed to be a Panther, yet he pushin' that Piru
Well, he done pissed off the wrong mothafucka wearin' blue
Blew a couple blunts, chillin' in the ride
Ain't seen nobody yet, God must want that boy alive
'Cause a twenty minute mission now done turned to twenty-five
Like birds in the winter, to the south we 'bout to fly
Slide out the lot, put away the Glock
Havin' second thoughts, and so I take another shot
Steam comin' from my top, they did me so grimy
Word'll get back to the city, everybody gon' try me, nah
Why'd they have to play a loc?
Then Keefe screamed, "there they go," uh
Thank you, God, thank you, God
And now, it's time to settle score
T. hit a U, don't know which car they in
Fuck, shoot up their whole caravan
Hold up, I heard them hoes scream his name
Got that nigga, now put that on the gang
This is them in the bimmer, I think them hoes seen us
I don't give a fuck, there's too much smoke between us
Since freak ain't shootin' cuh, I reach right across him
This gang-bangin' shit is so costly
