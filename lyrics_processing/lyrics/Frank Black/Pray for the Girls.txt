Last night I had the strangest dream
Saw everybody running in the streets
Leapfrogging salmon trying to get upstream
The dream was over but I could not sleep
I had to put on the lights when she said that

Last night I had the strangest dream
The sky was dark and I could not see
Felt underwater when I tried to scream
When I heard the rooster I was finally free
I was a little bit frightened when he said that

Last night I had the strangest dream
Me and the chickens running in the streets
We met a monkey with an eye that gleamed
He drew that line, we couldn't move our beaks, no
A doggie woke me and he said hey rooster

Last night I had the strangest dream
The war was over and I had no peace
The moon was waning so it wasn't the beams
It's just a dream but I have no peace
I eavesdropped on my masters they said that
You might also like
Last night we had the strangest dream
It was disturbing, oh, what does it mean?
Monkey in a turban, oh, what does it mean?
Last night we had the strangest dream
We better go to the mayor, then we drove

Downtown to have a talk with the mayor
He told my masters, oh, oh, can't you see?
What we have here is a prophecy
Cross your fingers people, say a prayer
I'm not a religious dog but I said that

Better pray for the girls
Better pray for the girls
Ain't no other hope in this whole world, no
Better pray for the girls
Better pray for the girls
Ain't no other hope in this whole world, no
Better pray for the girls
Better pray for the girls
Ain't no other hope in this whole world, no

In sleep we searched behind the sun
A funny place to find someone
We did not find them on the moon
We dreamed that's where they disappeared
We dreamed perhaps another pearl
Or dangling on some other dune
But darker dreams we fear
Where'd you go this time, girls?
Better pray for the girls
Better pray for the girls
Ain't no other hope in this whole world, no
Better pray for the girls
Better pray for the girls
