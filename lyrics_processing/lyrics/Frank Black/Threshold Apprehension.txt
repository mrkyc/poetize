Then you talk to the hand just to get a little jerk
Some people die, then they start to get old
But I don't want to die upon the threshold
I got threshold aprehension
Threshold, threshold, threshold, threshold
Threshold, threshold, threshold apprehension
(Threshold apprehension)
I got threshold apprehension
Every little shit gotta find his salt lick
If I don't find my babe, I'm gonna be junk sick
Roll away the rock so I can get to my ascension
Ain't my first time having threshold apprehension
I got threshold aprehension. What?
Threshold, threshold, threshold, threshold
Threshold, threshold, threshold apprehension
(Threshold apprehension)
I got threshold apprehension
Who's carrying who?
Who's turning the screw?
Who hath prophesied?
Petit paramour
I will be the whore
And you'll be my suicide

Threshold, threshold, threshold
We got on my bike and we rode to the sea
I stood on the dock and you got on your knees
Grand Marnier and a pocket full of speed
We did it all day 'til we started to bleed
Are you feeling apprehensive?
I can leap higher than an old king toad
I do 185 on the new ring road
I love a blue girl and I like my grog
It's a black and white world, 'cause I'm a Scorpio dog
Have drink, press button, seventh floor
And wait a hundred years for the elevator door
Come a time when you wanna lose the tension
It's your last time for the threshold apprehension
I got threshold aprehension. Say what?
Threshold, threshold, threshold, threshold
Threshold, threshold, threshold apprehension
I got threshold apprehension
I got threshold apprehension
Threshold, threshold, threshold, threshold
Threshold, threshold, threshold, threshold
Threshold, threshold, threshold, threshold
Threshold, threshold, threshold
Threshold, threshold, threshold
Who's carrying who?
Who's turning the screw?
Who hath prophesied?
Petit paramour
I will be the whore
Be my suicide
Who's carrying who?
Who's turning the screw?
Who hath prophesied?
Petit paramour
I will be the whore
