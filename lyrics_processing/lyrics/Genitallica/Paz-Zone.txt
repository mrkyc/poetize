'Cause they're we, yes, yo, I'm in the house now for sure
Because I wanna talk about the hearts of men
Who knows what evil lurks within them
But let's take a travel down the blindside
And see what we find on this path called
Stranded on death row so duck when I swing my shit
I get rugged like Rawhead Rex with fat tracks that fits
The gangsta type, what I recite's kinda lethal
Niggas know the flow that I kick, there's no equal
I'm murderin' niggas, yo, and maybe because of the tone
I kicks when I grip the mic and kick shit niggas can't fuck with
So remember I go hardcore and slam
Nuff respect like a Sensei, ba-bash like Van Damme
So any nigga that claim they bossin'
What don't you bring your ass on over to Crenshaw and Slauson?
Take a walk through the hood when we up to no good
Slangin' them things like a real O.G. should
I'm stackin' and mackin' and packin' a ten so
When you're slippin', I slip the clip in but ain't no set tripppin'
'Cause it's death row, rollin' like the mafia
Think about whoopin' some ass but what the fuck stoppin' ya?
You might also likeAin't nothin' but a buster
I'm stranded on death row
For pumpin' slugs in motherfuckers
Now you know you're outdone
Feel the shotgun, corrupt inmate, cell block one
No prevention from this mention of sorts
You're a victim from my drive by of thoughts
No extensions, all attempts are to fail
Blinded by the light, it's time you learn Braille
From the lunatic, I death like arsenic
When I kick up wicked raps Dr. Dre will kick the scratch
With treachery my literary form will blast
And totally surpass the norm
Not a storm, plural, make it many storms
When I'm vexed I fly leg, necks and arms
In this dimension I'm the presenter
And the inventor and the tormentor
Deranged like the hillside strangler
MC mangler, tough like Wrangler
I write a rhyme, hard as concrete
Step to the heat and get burned like mesquite
So what you wanna do?
The narrator RBX, cell block two
Rage, lyrical murderer, stranded on death row
And now I'm servin' a lifetime sentence
There'll be no repentance
Since it's the life that I choose to lead, I plead guilty
On all counts let the ball bounce where it may
It's just another clip into my AK
Buck 'em down with my underground tactics
Facts and stacks of clips on my mattress
Bed frame there's another dead pain
Layin' lain with the shame, who's to blame?
Me, the lady of Rage On
When I'm comin from the death in row takin' no shit
So flip and you're bound to get dropped
It's 187 on motherfuckers don't stop handcuffed as I bust
There'll be no debate, it's Rage, from cell block eight
And yo steppin' through the fog and creepin' through the smog
It's the number one nigga from the hood, Doggy Dogg
Makin' videos, now I stay in Hollywood
Bustin' raps for my snaps, now they call me Eastwood
Dre is the doctor and my homey little nigga
Warren G is my hand and my hand's on the trigga
Shootin' at the hoes with the game that I got
Sent to death row 'cause I wanted to make
A grip from servin' my rocks
And I'm still servin' for mines, peace
To my motherfuckin' homies doin' time
In the pen and the county jail
Mobbin' with your blues on, mad as hell
And you say, yeah, fuck the police
And all the homies on the streets is all about peace
And it's drivin' the cops crazy
But ain't nuttin' but a black thing, bay-bee, uh
No I'm not flaggin' but I'm just saggin'
I betcha don't wanna see the D O double G
And you can't see the D R to the E
Or my motherfuckin' homey D.O.C
You know you can't fuck with my motherfuckin' DJ
That's my homey and we call him Warren G
Yeah, and you don't stop, Doggy Dogg
Break 'em down with the motherfuckin' Dogg Pound
That's the only way we'll beat 'em, man
We gotta smoke 'em then choke 'em
Like the motherfuckin' Peter Man
