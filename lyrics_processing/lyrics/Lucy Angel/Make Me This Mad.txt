Now I ain't sayin' I'm lookin' for something perfect
Heaven knows that ain't what we got
But if it ain't worth a fight, then it ain't worth it
And if that's the case what we got is worth a lot

You only make me this mad 'cause I love you that much
Sometimes I yell, sometimes you cuss
It's like what the hell, what's the fuss
But that's how it is and that's just us
We barely see eye to eye
And from time to time I need some time
But I know you know when things get rough
You only make me this mad 'cause I love you that much

How this one got started's a little hazy
By now it shouldn't take us all this long
To realize tryin' to place the blame, well that's just crazy
'Cause I'm always right and you're never wrong
Except when you're wrong, yeah

You only make me this mad 'cause I love you that much
Sometimes I yell, sometimes you cuss
It's like what the hell, what's the fuss
But that's how it is and that's just us
We barely see eye to eye
And from time to time I need some time
But I know you know when things get rough
You only make me this mad 'cause I love you that much
You might also like
Baby it's all good, it ain't no thing, gonna be alright
And I'll make sure that you know tonight
Yeah, I'll make sure that you know tonight

You only make me this mad 'cause I love you that much
Sometimes I yell, sometimes you cuss
It's like what the hell, what's the fuss
But that's how it is and that's just us
We barely see eye to eye
And from time to time I need some time
But I know you know when things get rough
You only make me this mad 'cause I love you that much

Baby don't you know that you make me so mad
