Boy, before you get your game on
That move, that groove, that drink on
Just please go easy struttin' and you can
Keep that button buttoned, it's time to take a breath
And rethink those cheesy lines
Girls don't dig that stuff, shit
And if ya don't know why

You better ask somebody before this chance is blown
Do a little bit of research
Re-sharpen your approach
If ya wanna make it happen
Find someone who knows, ya know?
Ya better ask somebody

Don't start braggin' 'bout your paycheck
Or that brand new jet-black Corvette
I don't get impressed with who your friends with
Or some gym card, low card fitness
Honey you don't get in a hurry
If you wanna get it right
Ya might wanna call your mama
Or how 'bout you callin' mine
You might also like
You better ask somebody before this chance is blown
Do a little bit of research
Re-sharpen your approach
If ya wanna make it happen
Find someone who knows, ya know?
Ya better ask somebody

Well I want her so here's what I done
See I got smart, went and asked someone
I went home to mama, asked her some questions
Fount out the truth and learned me a lesson
No need to brag, no need to front
Shut up and listen, find what she wants
Give her your attention, listen to her dreams
Love her like crazy, show her what she means
Ain't nothin' better than lovin' a good girl
Find the right one, it'll change your world
So now that you know what you need to does
You better ask somebody if you're looking for love

You better ask somebody before this chance is blown
Do a little bit of research
Re-sharpen your approach
If ya wanna make it happen
Find someone who knows, ya know?
Ya better ask somebody
