I know why she's crazy
Why she's drinkin' all the time
Lookin' more like forty
When she's only twenty-nine
Why her best friend and her Momma
Think she's lost a couple screws
Yeah I know why she's crazy 'cause
Baby you've done made me crazy too

I know why she called you
Always cryin' on the phone
Drivin' by late at night
Just to see if you were home
I know why she was wonderin'
If you were tellin' her the truth
Yeah I know why she's crazy
'Cause baby you've done made me crazy too

Crazy makes you do the things
You swore you'd never do
Checkin' emails, checkin' details
Calls and texts from unknown females
Yeah crazy ain't so crazy
When you're goin' through it too
Through the garbage, through your pockets
Through your trunk and glove compartment
Yeah I know why she's crazy 'cause
Baby you've done made me crazy too
You might also like
I know why she hates you
'Cause right now I'm on the verge
I know why she keyed your car
'Cause I sure got the urge
Now I'm the one who's standing
In her bitter high heel shoes
Yeah, I know why she's crazy 'cause
Baby you've done made me crazy too

Crazy makes you do the things
You swore you'd never do
Checkin' emails, checkin' details
Calls and texts from unknown females
Yeah crazy ain't so crazy
When you're goin' through it too
Through the garbage, through your pockets
Through your trunk and glove compartment
I know why she's crazy 'cause
Baby you've done made me crazy too

Crazy makes you do the things
You swore you'd never do
Checkin' emails, checkin' details
Calls and texts from unknown females
Crazy ain't so crazy
When you're goin' through it too
Through the garbage, through your pockets
Through your trunk and glove compartment
Yeah I know why she's crazy 'cause
Baby you've done made me crazy too
