Can't get you out of my head
Blowing up the phone
Just to hear you breathing
You runaway runaway but that's ok
Girl we can play make believe in this fantasy
I'll be the king that you need to treat you like a queen
You'll be my everything
 :
But I won't stop until you're mine
So just let go and hold on time
Cause I'm falling in love again
I'm falling in love again
I'm falling in love again
Don't stop baby cause I'm falling in love again
Oh Oh
Now I know what's really happening
Staring at her face wondering what she's dreaming
I stay awake stay awake all night
Cause I'm affraid she won't be there in the daylight
I'm so amazed but we got play the cards right
Don't wanna make the wrong move
