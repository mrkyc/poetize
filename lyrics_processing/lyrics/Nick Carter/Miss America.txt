Early morning
A small cafe
A beautiful vision comes my way
I watch her hips swing when she walks
She leaves me speechless when she talks
I see the sun shine through her dress
Makes my heart say
Yes
Take it off, take it off
Let's get it on, get it on
Light a fire so sweet
Make the man within me
Desire the woman in you
Miss America
Yes, that's what you are
All my dreams they come true
When you do what you do
I just gotta get next to you
Miss America
Take me where you are
In the land of the free
Make a prisoner of me
Close my eyes and you're all that I see
Miss America
You might also like(Yeah)
I see your beauty shine in every girl
Coast to coast you're the queen of my world
You're the reason for this state I'm in
New York to LA
Skin to skin
Take it off, take it off
Let's get it on, get it on
Makes me strong
Makes me weak
Makes the man within me
Love the woman in you
Miss America
Yes, that's what you are
All my dreams they come true
When you do what you do
I just got to get next to you
Miss America
Take me where you are
In the land of the free
Make a prisoner of me
Close my eyes and you're all that I see
There's one thing you need to know
(Oh woman)
You rock my world 'cause you're so
Beautiful
Miss America
Yes, that's what you are
Miss America
Take me where you are
(Oh)
Miss America
Yes, that's what you are
All my dreams they come true
When you do what you do
I (just gotta get next to you) just gotta get next to you
Miss America
(Oh yeah)
Take me where you are
(Ooh take me)
In the land of the free
Make a prisoner of me
Close my eyes and you're all that I see
Miss America
Ha, cha
The queen of my world
Miss America
Miss America
Ha, cha
American girl
Miss America
Take it off, take it off
Let's get it on, get it on
Take it off, take it off
Let's get it on, get it on
