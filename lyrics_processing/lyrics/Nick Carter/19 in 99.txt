The surf's up, the traffic sucks
My girlfriend said sayonara
I'm too rad to get mad
I'm rolling down my windows
And I'm turning up the 2Pac
I rock the 2Pac, I rock the 2Pac
I'm pushing down the pedal with my blunt up Reebok's
I'm in my Reebok's
It makes me wanna go back in time
I know you remember when
You and I, didn't give a damn
And we would go all night, 19 in 99
Baby you and me, everybody wanted to be free, too free
Spending all our money, just to live like kings
Underneath the Hollywood sign
Reunited in 1999
19 in 99, 19 in 99
Countdown back to millennium
Bleach blond, party on
Tank tops, tube socks, and felines
Skateboards, Sega's

(Think it was Lana, think it was Lana)
She had a tattoo on her back and listened to Nirvana
(I heard Nirvana)
It makes me wanna go back in time
I know you remember when
You and I, didn't give a damn
And we would go all night, 19 in 99
Baby you and me, everybody wanted to be free, too free
Spending all our money, just to live like kings
Underneath the Hollywood sign
Reunited in 1999
19 in 99, 19 in 99
Let's go all night, like it's 99
Let's go all night, like it's 99
Let's go all night, like it's 99
Let's go all night, like it's 99
It makes me wanna go back in time
I know you remember when
You and I, didn't give a damn
And we would go all night, 19 in 99
Baby you and me, everybody wanted to be free, too free
Spending all our money, just to live like kids
Underneath the Hollywood sign
Reunited in 1999
19 in 99, 19 in 99
Let's go all night, like it's 99
