Girl I'm sitting here looking at you
Can't believe this beautiful view
That I'm seeing right before my eyes
Trying to think about words to say
Girl you got me way
It's a feeling I don't wanna fight

Girl you shine and you sparkle underneath these lights
Gotta have you, gotta make you mine
Chemistry we can't ignore
So what are we waiting for

Cause we ain't gonna live forever
Oh baby, we can't stop the hands of time
As long as we are here together
No, nothing can go wrong tonight

My love just can't wait, can't wait, can't wait
My love just can't wait, can't wait, can't wait
My love just can't wait, can't wait, can't wait
My love just can't wait, can't wait, can't wait
You might also like
All I do is hold you close
Feel your heartbeat through your clothes
Can you tell me baby what's your name
'Cause when you look at me like that
Girl there ain't no turning back
Girl you gotta tell me that you feel the same

Girl you shine and you sparkle underneath these lights
Gotta have you, gotta make you mine
Chemistry we can't ignore
So what are we waiting for

Cause we ain't gonna live forever
Oh baby, we can't stop the hands of time
As long as we are here together
No, nothing can go wrong tonight

My love just can't wait, can't wait, can't wait
My love just can't wait, can't wait, can't wait
My love just can't wait, can't wait, can't wait
My love just can't wait, can't wait, can't wait
I can feel you
Feel your warm embrace
When you're talking about love
There's no better time and place

Cause we ain't gonna live forever
Oh baby, we can't stop the hands of time
As long as we are here together
No, nothing can go wrong tonight

My love just can't wait, can't wait, can't wait
My love just can't wait, can't wait, can't wait
My love just can't wait, can't wait, can't wait
My love just can't wait, can't wait, can't wait

Can't wait, can't wait, can't wait
Can't wait, can't wait, can't wait
My love just can't wait, can't wait, can't wait
Can't wait, can't wait, can't wait
