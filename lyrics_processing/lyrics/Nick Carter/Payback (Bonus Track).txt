It's payback
Get outta my face
Get outta my pocket
Get off of your free ride
And get, right out of my sight
It's payback
Get off of my case
Get off of my lady
Get into your fat Mercedes
And right outta my life

It's payback
Get outta my face
Get outta my pocket
Get off of your free ride
And get, right out of my sight
It's payback
Get off of my case
Get off of my lady
Get into your fat Mercedes
And right outta my life

You walk in, right into my world
Right into my backyard
I give to you all that I got
You gave to me jack
And then you pretend
To be my friend
My trust you're earning
When all of this time, you're turning
A knife in my back
And now
You might also like
It's payback
Get outta my face
Get outta my pocket
Get off of your free ride
And get, right out of my sight
It's payback
Get off of my case
Get off of my lady
Get into your fat Mercedes
And right outta my life

How does it feel to be down on your knees
Tell me, how does it feel for ya
How does it feel to be down on your knees
Tell me, how does it feel for ya

I'm chilling with the boys from the south
Better make a run cause you know its gonna go down
I'm sick of everything that you say
And by the way did you say that you couldn't make a better day
Better leave real quick cause you know me
Everything I do, everything I think
Its payback, and its all
Take a listen to the words of the song
It's payback
Get outta my face
Get outta my pocket
Get off of your free ride
And get, right out of my sight
It's payback
Get off of my case
Get off of my lady
Get into your fat Mercedes
And right outta my life

You say you're sorry now
That you feel bad about it
You make it up to me
There ain't no doubt about it
You must think I'm a fool
That I was born yesterday
Some kinda simple sucker
There's nothing you can say
You stupid mother...

Payback
Payback
Payback
It's payback
Get outta my face
Get outta my pocket
Get off of your free ride
And get, right out of my sight
It's payback
Get off of my case
Get off of my lady
Get into your fat Mercedes
And right outta my life

How does it feel to be down on your knees
Tell me, how does it feel for ya
Right outta my sight
How does it feel to be down on your knees
Tell me, how does it feel for ya
Right outta my life
