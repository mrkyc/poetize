I'm just trying to figure out what's wrong with your head
Every time I look around you're somewhere else instead
I wanna ask you why but every time i try, you cry

And I want you to know when you're floating in space
And I want you to know if you ever come back down
And I need you to know

I wanna breathe you
I wanna feel you near
This is my confession
I wanna see what you see when you cry those tears
Give me just a second
What am I to do
Maybe it's obsession
But this is my confession

I confess, every time I come around
Something's always got you down
And I don't understand why
And if you wanna tell me
I'll be the angel on you shoulder, baby
I'll be the man that you confide in
But I can't seem to get you out of that place
And everything you do is just
Erasing the pain and that's not right
With hatred inside I can't ask why

And I want you to know when you're floating in space
And I want you to know if you ever come back down
And I need you to know

I wanna breathe you
I wanna feel you near
This is my confession
I wanna see what you see when you cry those tears
This is my confession
I wanna breathe you
I wanna feel you near
Give me just a second
What am I to do
Maybe it's obsession
But this is my confession

And I want you to know when you're floating in space
And I want you to know if you ever come back down
If you ever come back down...

I wanna breathe you
I wanna feel you near
This is my confession (this is my confession)
I wanna see what you see when you cry those tears
This is my confession (gimme just a second)
I wanna breathe you
I wanna feel you near
Maybe it's obsession
This is my confession
I wanna see what you see when you cry those tears, yeah yeah
