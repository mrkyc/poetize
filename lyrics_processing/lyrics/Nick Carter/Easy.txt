It's 7:30 in the morning
I smell eggs over easy
In those pajamas that I like, girl
'Lil mama knows how to please me
I hear the kids wakin' up, screamin' mom and daddy, "Where you at?
Downstairs
Give her a kiss on the cheek as she winks, said, "I see you later on" "Hell yeah"

I swear that you got something special love
That comes from up above
But I'd never give you up
'Cause you make this

You make this look easy
Oh-oh-oh
You make this look easy
Oh-oh-oh
And how you do everything with style and grace
I thank God that you're for me, yeah yeah yeah
'Cause you make it easy to love you
La la la la la la la la
You make it look easy
La la la la la la la
You might also like
You keep my heartbeat beating
And girl, I'm feening for more time with you
More love with you, girl, is what I'm needing
And just a kiss from your lips is enough to keep my world just spinning
And don't rush it, girl
Just trust it, girl
And feel what I'm feeling

I swear that you got something special love (special love)
That comes from up above (From up above, yeah)
I'd never give you up
'Cause you make this

You make this look easy
Oh-oh-oh
You make this look easy
Oh-oh-oh
And how you do everything with style and grace
I think god that you're for me, yeah yeah yeah
'Cause you make it easy to love you
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la
You make it look easy
How do you do everything with style and grace?
I thank God that you're for me, yeah yeah yeah
'Cause you make it easy to love you
La la la la la la la la la la la la
You make it look easy
