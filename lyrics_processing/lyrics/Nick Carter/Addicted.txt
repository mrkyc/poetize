I saw my world come crashing down
I?ll never forget
How you just blew my mind
My head is spinning
Feel my heart ?bout to explod
I?m overload from the head to toe
Around and round and round we go

So what I?m addicted
And now I can?t live without your love
Maybe it?s crazy
But I just can?t get enough
I can?t fight the feeling
I?d rather let you take me away
I don?t wanna break these chains
I?d rather feel the pain
You?re such a good bad drug
The one I can?t give up
You give me such a rush
The one I?m thinking of
You?re such a good bad drug
Yeah, I?m strung out
No, I can see straight
All you give I?ll take
You got me now
Just coming back for more
Oh, I-I?m not coming down
Too much to wait
I?m overload from head to toe
Round and round we go
You might also like
So what I?m addicted
And now I can?t live without your love
Maybe it?s crazy
But I just can?t get enough
I can?t fight the feeling
I?d rather let you take me away
I don?t wanna break these chains
I?d rather feel the pain
You?re such a good bad drug
The one I can?t give up
You give me such a rush
The one I?m thinking of
You?re such a good bad drug
I?m so hooked up, took your pill
I get stucked in, get my fill
There?s no hope of waiting you
Or getting off of our love
I need a therapy
Unless you?re not around
I?ll get your chemistry
I?m never coming down
You got hold on me
I want more, gimme more
I need my fix
What I?m addicted
And now I can?t live without your love
Maybe it?s crazy
But I just can?t get enough
I can?t fight the feeling
I?d rather let you take me away
I don?t wanna break these chains
I?d rather feel the pain
You?re such a good bad drug
The one I can?t give up
You give me such a rush
The one I?m thinking of
