I climbed the highest mountain
Was on top of the world
Then I came crashing down
All the fame and fortune
Turned to dust and dirt
Couldn?t turn it back around
Many days felt helpless
Many nights full of sadness
Maybe it?s meant to be

I got nothing, nothing left to lose
I got freedom, but most of all, you
We got love and we got time
If we just remain on each other?s hearts
We could leave it all behind
And start anew
As long as I got you
As long as I got you
No more front page stories
No more making up lies
Turning my life around, life around
No more cameras flashing
Blinding my eyes
I can see clearer now
Oh, cause I?m still breathing
It?s a new beginning
Baby it?s meant to be
You might also like
I got nothing, nothing left to lose
I got freedom, but most of all, you (oh)
We could be anything we want
Just let go in each other?s arms
No more lonely nights in dirty hotel rooms
We got love and we got time
If we just remain on each other?s lives
We could leave it all behind
And start anew
As long as I got you
And the rain won?t stop me
And the cold won?t scar me
And nobody?s gonna hold me down

I got nothing, nothing left to lose
I got freedom, but most of all, you
We could be anything we want
Just let go in each other?s arms
No more lonely nights in dirty hotel rooms
We got love and we got time
If we just remain on each other?s lives
We could leave it all behind
And start anew
As long as I got you
As long as I got you
As long as I got you
