Yeah, I like this
Hey

Hey
Hey
To all my girls in the USA
Ya got a fine thing goin'
So I gotta say
You been good to me
So now I'm down
Gotta drop the line
Gotta give em a shout
LA girl givin' me the sign
See you on the strip
Lookin' too damn fine
My Texas honey's
Always on the road
Gimme lots of love at the Alamo
To my DC girls
Workin' 9-5
With the business suits
Keep the country in line
All the Tampa girls
Lemme hear ya scream
On the Ybor strip
Walkin' on the street

Ahh
Does she walk that way
Walk that way
Ahh
She spends my money the American way
Ahh
Coast to coast
New York to L.A
To all my girls in the USA
I got a little thing in the Denver hills
A real fine mama
With the sex appeal
And Boston's got the ones I love
With the college girls
At the Aria
And I've always been down with the NYC
Cuz I love the legs
Of miss Liberty
Hawaii girls
Give me the lei
When I wanna treasure hunt
For some candy
And I still gotta get my desert fix
With some Vegas girls
And go spend some Chips
To my Carolina girls
Lemme rock you all
To my Jersey girls
Chillin' at the mall
Ahh
Does she walk that way
Walk that way
Ahh
She wears stars and stripes
And she's ready to play
Ahh
Coast to coast
New York to LA
Ahh To all my girls in the USA
Girls in the USA
She'll make it hot when ya
Girls in the USA
Shake what you got
From the east coast
To the west coast
All around the world we're singin'
Girls in the USA
She'll make it hot when ya
Girls in the USA
Shake what ya got
From the north down
To the dirty south
All around the world we're singin
To all the girls
That I might've missed
Don't take offense
You're on my list
If you wanna yell
Lemme hear ya say
God bless the girls of the USA
