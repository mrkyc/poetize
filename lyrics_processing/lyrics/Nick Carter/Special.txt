Mafia

She makes me wanna fly
Both feet on the ground
Takes me to this place
I don't want to come down
(Down, down, down)
Gives me something fresh
Someone that is real
Separate from the rest
Makes me wanna feel

I got the perfect imitation
To a world that is full with smiles
With our spirits free and wild
Mmm
But it's a bittersweet sensation
'Cause I'll never have her heart

No matter how I try
She's always on my mind
At night, everyday
And with every breath I take
On the way
She'll make a grown man cry
With one look deep into her eyes
Outrageous, make you crazy, it's amazing
She's special
She's special
So special
She's special
She's special
She's special

Footprints on the sand
Hear the ocean crash
Underneath the moon
Walking hand in hand
Shadow by my side
Wishing you were mine
Keep you in my dreams
Locked deep inside

I got the perfect imitation
To a world that is full with smiles
With our spirits free and wild
Mmm, but it's a bittersweet sensation
'Cause I'll never have her heart

No matter how I try
She's always on my mind
At night, everyday
And with every breath I take
On the way
She'll make a grown man cry
With one look deep into her eyes
Outrageous, make you crazy, it's amazing
She's special
Oh, I swore to you girl I will follow
I know some day you'll want me
When you're not so cold and lonely
I'll be the whisper in your ear
If ever you should call me
I'll be here

No matter how I try
She's always on my mind
At night, everyday
And with every breath I take
On the way
She'll make a grown man cry
With one look deep into her eyes
Outrageous, make you crazy, it's amazing
She's special
She's special
So special
She's special
She's special
She's special
Yea-ah
She's special
She's special
So special
She's special
She's special
