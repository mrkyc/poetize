I wish I could define
All the thoughts that cross my mind
They seem too big for me to choose
I don't know which ones to lose
When I've fallen down so far
I think I'll never see your light
Bouncing off of me
Shining down here from your eyes

Help me, figure out the difference
Between right and wrong, weak and strong
Day and night where I belong
Help me, make the right decisions
Know which way to turn, lessons to learn
And just what my purpose is here (just what my purpose is here)
Oh, yeah

It's like I got the signals crossed
With messages I can't decode
Half asleep, never wide awake
I'm in a complete overload
I've got so much information here
And nothing I can really grasp
I should know the truth
But I'm too afraid, so I have to ask
You might also like
Help me, figure out the difference
Between right and wrong, weak and strong
Day and night where I belong
Help me, make the right decisions
Know which way to turn, lessons to learn
And just what my purpose is here (just what my purpose is here)

I wanna know you, more than anything
I need you, in my every dream you're there for me
You love me, for who I am
No angel, just an ordinary man

Help me figure out why I'm stuck in the middle
Tryin' to understand why I can't, why's it such a riddle
Got my eyes crossed, thinkin' so hard
And I know I'm missin' the mark
Can you help me sort out all this information
I'm just rackin' my brain, payin' attention
But I'm still lost and at all costs, I (I)
I gotta know (I gotta know, oh, oh)
