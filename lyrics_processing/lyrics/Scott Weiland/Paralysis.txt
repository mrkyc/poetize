Took a look at the bed
The one that we called home
Bought a ticket to somewhere, anywhere
Did you think of me blind
Cause I walked in circles
I know you thought of me unkind
But I tried to lead you through the minefield
Instead I led you to another
Pack my bags
Walking in rain
Here them voices inside my head
Drinking that booze and taking down names
And plates and seeing the place where I dream
Call my name, shout my name
Try to consume the place where I lay
Driving on the freeway passing up cars
Crashed my car
Gotta get out of here
Had to rip up my heart
Had to patch up my head
At the hotel terrace
Had a drink at the bar
Stumbled up and away
Every piss and a girl is a ghost of you
You might also likeDid you think of me blind
Caused I fly around in circles
I know you think of me unwise
But I try to lead you through the minefield
Instead I lead you to another
Pack my bags
Walking in rain
Here them voices inside my head
Drinking that booze and taking down names
And plates and seeing the place where I dream
Call my name, shout my name
Try to consume the place where I lay
Driving on the freeway, passing up cars
Crashed my car
Gotta get out of here
When you realized me blind
You lead me round in circles
For seven years I read your lies
But I still lead you through
That minefield
Find my way back through another
Pack my bags
Walking in rain
Here them voices inside my head
Drinking that booze and taking down names
And plates and seeing that place where I dream
Call my name, shout my name
Try to consume the place where I lay
Driving on the freeway, passing up cars
Crashed my car
Gotta get out of here
Pack my bags
(did you think of me blind)
Walking in rain
Here them voices inside my head
Drinking that booze and taking down names
(cause still I fly around in circles)
And plates and seeing that place where I dream
(did you think of me blind)
Try to consume the people I pay
Flying on the freeway
(Cause still I fly around in mind fields)
