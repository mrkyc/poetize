Left out on the evening train
I was just a little boy thinking about the memories
The father that you used to be
San Jose is a sun-drenched town
Your old truck with the windows rolled down
Jerry Jeff riding high on the radio
I wanna know why you had to go
Took a plane to California, yeah
End of summer, 1970's
Telling you that you're the man that taught me how to sing
Why did you go?
Leave me so lone... so young... so young
Tell me things that I wanna know
Now I'm a man with a family of my own
Why'd you go and leave me in the cold?
With the face in the mirror of the man I didn't know
In the desert where the warm wind blows
Where'd you go when I was so alone?
Those California nights would be so cold
I wanna know the man I didn't know

The wife and kids that tell me what's wrong
I need the man in my life who made me who I am
I don't want to lose you again
Took a plane to California, yeah
End of summer, 1970's
Telling you that you're the man that taught me how to sing
Why did you go?
Leave me so lone... so young... so young
Tell me things that I wanna know
Now I'm a man with a family of my own
Why'd you go and leave me in the cold?
With the face in the mirror of the man I didn't know
In the desert where the warm wind blows
Where'd you go when I was so alone?
Those California nights can be so cold
I wanna know the man I didn't know
Go...
Tell me things that I wanna know
Now I'm a man with a family of my own
Why'd you go and leave me in the cold?
With the face in the mirror of the man I didn't know
In the desert where the warm wind blows
Where'd you go when I was so alone?
Those California nights can be so cold
I wanna know the man I didn't know
