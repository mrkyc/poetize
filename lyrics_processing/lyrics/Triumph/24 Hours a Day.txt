I'll tell you sweetly now
Why I can't come to bed
I'm listening to the music
That's playing in my head
While you're filled with sleepy dreams
I'm moving to the sounds
The beat keeps driving in my brain
And the words go round and round
I see myself up on the stage
And holding my guitar
And I can't tell
If it's Carnegie Hall
Or just some local bar
But the hands are clapping
And the place is moving
And I feel it in my soul
It's late at night
And I can't sleep
I gotta write some
Rock and roll

It drives me crazy about
Twenty-four hours a day
It's bouncing all around
In my brain and
I've just got to play
You might also like
While the world outside is quiet
And the children are fast asleep
But here inside I'm rockin' 'n' rollin'
To a crazy beat

So come on come on come on
Come on boys let's play
Yeah we gotta do it do it do it
Twenty-four hours a day

(Everybody party)
Twenty-four hours a day
(Everybody party)
Ooh, listen baby what I say
(Everybody party)
Twenty-four hours a day
(Everybody party)
Party party every day


Ooh baby let me tell you sweetly
Why I can't come to bed
I'm listening to the music playing in my head
While you're filled with sleepy dreams
I'm moving to the sounds
The beat keeps driving in the back of my brain
And the music goes around and around
So come on come on come on
Come on boys let's play
Yeah we gotta do it do it do it
Twenty-four hours a day

(Everybody party)
Twenty-four hours a day
(Everybody party)
Ooh, listen baby what I say
(Everybody party)
Twenty-four hours a day
(Everybody party)
Party party every day


(Everybody party)
Twenty-four hours a day
(Everybody party)
C'mon boys let's play
(Everybody party)
Twenty-four hours a day
(Everybody party)
We party party every day
(Everybody party)
Twenty-four hours a day
(Everybody party)
Party party every day
(Everybody party)
Hey listen baby what I say
(Everybody party)
Twenty-four hours a day
(Everybody party)
Twenty-four, twenty-four
(Everybody party)
Twenty-four hours a day
(Everybody party)
