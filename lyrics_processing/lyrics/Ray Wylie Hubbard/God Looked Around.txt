God looked around
He didn't see nothin'
Said, "Well shucks, let there be light"
So up come the sun
Bright as all get-out
And then he split it up into day and night

God looked around
Wasn't much to look at
So he fabricated the heavens and earth
So now there's solid ground
Divvied up by waters
He said, "Well, there it is, for what it's worth"

He gave wings to birds
Ao they'd fly in the air
And legs for critters walkin' on the ground
Allocated fish to the water
And beasts to the fields
And creeping things to crawl around

God looked around
He didn't see no one
He reached down and he picked up some dust
Then he spit on it
And he kneaded it like bread dough
And a man rose up full-grown as such

God looked at the man
He saw that he was lonely
Said, "Go to sleep, I guess I ain't done"
He pried out one of his ribs
And he slapped some hide around it
There was two now where once there's one

He gave it some curves
And lips red a cherries
And ravishing curly raven hair
Well the man, he woke up
And he looked at the woman
He said, "Whoa Lord, you done answered my prayers"

Now things was righteous
When a snake walked up
Said "Hey woman, take a bite of this
"You'll be smart as God
"And you'll live forever
"You'll be foolish to resist"

The woman said "Uh-uh
"I don't eat from that tree
"Those was God's very own words"
Oh, but the snake sweet-talked her
And she took a bite
And the she realized she's naked as a jaybird
The woman went to the man
And he took a taste
"Well I'm undraped" he proclaimed
And they heard God a-comin'
So they went and hid
'Course they was naked and ashamed

Well, God found 'em
Said, "You ate forbidden fruit"
The woman cried "The snake duped me, I was tempted"
God said "I told you not to
"And since you disobeyed
"Your time here in paradise is ended"

So God cast 'em out
Dooming us all to die
That's why it's the way it is
And God said to the snake
"You done walkin' and talkin'"
