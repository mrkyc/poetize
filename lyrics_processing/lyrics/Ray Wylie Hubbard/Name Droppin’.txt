Never been to Birmingham
Makes his livin' with an old lap slide
He's gonna take Willie for a pony ride

If you got a body, baby, shake that thing

Sweeter than a whiskey still
She got her fiddle, she got her a bow
Plays barefooted with painted toes

Let it rain, let it pour

If you've a mind to, you can sing
If you got a body, baby, shake that thing
