Last night I went down
To the railroad tracks
And I watched that train roll by
Ninety-nine cars
Screamin' into the dark
I heard the lonesome whistle cry
With her name on my arm
And the rain comin' down
It was like the first time
I took her down
To the railroad tracks
And her red, red lips touched mine

She said "I wanna rock and roll
"I wanna hoochie coo
"I wanna shake that thing
"Baby, love "

The woman's got a walk
To make a man cry
Throw back his head and howl
Ruby red lips
And liquid hips
More than the law will allow
If I told her once
I told her twice
I must've told her a thousand times
"I got a red hot mind
"And a cold black heart
"I am the jealous kind"
The woman just laughed
And said, "Sweet Daddy
"You know you're the only one
"You're my smooth lover boy
"My heartache and joy
"Come on let's have some fun"

It was early last night
I went downtown
To a place called Johnny's Last Stand
Through the blues and the smoke
I saw her on the dance floor
She's with another man
The dead man's name
Was Louie Dupree
I pushed the little button on my knife
I walked up to 'em and said
"Hello boys and girls
"Have you enjoyed your life?"

It's time to rock and roll
It's time to hoochie coo
Shake that thing
Baby, love 
Last night I went down
To the railroad tracks
To watch that train roll by
Ninety-nine cars
Screamin' into the dark
I heard the lonesome whistle cry
With her name on my arm
And the rain comin' down
I kissed her for the very last time
I took her down
To the railroad tracks
And her red, red lips touched mine

I wanna rock and roll
Wanna hoochie coo
Shake that thing
Baby, love 
I wanna rock and roll
Wanna hoochie coo
Shake that thing
Baby, love 
Baby, love 
Baby, love
