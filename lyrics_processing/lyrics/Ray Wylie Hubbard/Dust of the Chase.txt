I come down from Oklahoma with a pistol in my boot
A pair of dice and a deck of cards, a Bible in my suit
I come here as the cause of tears, just a cryin' shame
Seven Stud or Eternal Blood, I'm lookin' for a game

I double-crossed the State of Texas and they give me a little time
I taught myself to double-cut the cards and hold scriptures in my mind
I learned to love the tumbling dice and to believe the Word
Tombstones or rollin' bones, beats anything I ever heard

Patience is a virtue that I don't possess
I can't deny that heaven lies beneath a cotton dress
How small a part of time we share 'til we hear the sound of wings
I'm lost in the dust of the chase that my life brings


I have walked through God's green pastures, beneath his rich blue skies
I've seen the fall of man and the kingdom hidden from their eyes
I have heard the roar of thunder, I've felt a lightnin' bolt
And when I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I take along Samuel Colt

Every night I kiss the cards and I hold them to my breast
And when I see the King of Hearts I know that I am blessed
And though my eyes are blind sometimes, I know there's somethin' there
So when the time's at hand and I kill a man, I say a little prayer

So I come down from Oklahoma with a pistol in my boot
A pair of dice and a deck of cards, and a Bible in my suit
How small a part of time we share 'til we hear the sound of wings
I am lost in the dust of the chase that my life brings
How small a part of time we share 'til we hear the sound of wings
