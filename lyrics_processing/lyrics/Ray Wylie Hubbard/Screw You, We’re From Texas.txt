I got on my cowboy boots, jeans, and Hawaiian shirt
Mirrored sunglasses and mobile phone
I guess I look like some Port Aransas dope dealer
That's out on bail, just tryin' to get home
But I ain't in jail and I got me a guitar
Got a little band that's hotter than a rocket
Sometimes we're sloppy, we're always loud
Tonight we're just ornery and locked in the pocket

So screw you, we're from Texas
Screw you, we're from Texas
Screw you, we're from Texas
We're from Texas, baby, so screw you

Now I love the USA
And the other states, ah, they're okay
Texas is the place I wanna be
And I don't care if I ever go to Delaware anyway
'Cause we got Stubbs, and Gruene Hall and Antone's
And John T's Country Store
We've got Willie and Jacky Jack, Robert Earl
Pat, Cory, Charlie, and me, and so many more

So screw you, we're from Texas
Screw you, we're from Texas
Screw you, we're from Texas
We're from Texas, screw you
Sing it with me-- screw you, we're from Texas
Screw you, we're from Texas
Screw you, we're from Texas
We're from Texas, screw you!

Now Texas has gotten a bad reputation
Because of what happened in Dallas and Waco
And our corporations, well they are corrupt
And the politicians are swindlers and loco
But when it comes to music, my friend
I believe these words are as true as St. John the Revelator's
Our Mr. Vaughan was the best that there ever was
And no band was cooler than The 13th Floor Elevators

So screw you, we're from Texas
Screw you, we're from Texas
Screw you, we're from Texas
We're from Texas, screw you
Screw you, we're from Texas
Screw you, we're from Texas
Screw you, we're from Texas
We're from Texas, screw you
Screw you, we're from Texas
Screw you, we're from Texas
Screw you, we're from Texas
We're from Texas, screw you
