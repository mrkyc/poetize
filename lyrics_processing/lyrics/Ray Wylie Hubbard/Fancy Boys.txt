In this false and soulless age we're all tied to a great white whale
Blind faith and promises are hangin' on a rusty nail
We all end up in Nashville scroungin' for our next meal
When the devil's lawyer shows up, says "Down here it's a hell of a deal"

Hank Williams died on New Year's Day in a Cadillac Fleetwood
And now fancy boys prance around on stages where Waylon once stood

An old preacher will appear just before our last breath
Saying "Whoever believes the word, they shall not taste death"
Still we stutter and we stammer and we fall down on our knees
As desperate a real estate agent at the Salton Sea

Hank Williams died on New Year's Day in a Cadillac Fleetwood
And now fancy boys prance around on stages where Waylon once stood

They say your life will flash before your eyes before your soul takes leave
And none but God can see your sins, I guess that's some relief
Before the last waltz is over, a new song shall begin
And the vandals brought the handle back so the pump works once again

Where I'm goin' for my bad past I ain't gonna need a toothbrush
It's gonna take than more than the soap in my mouth like when Momma first heard my cuss
Willie said roll him up and smoke him-it'd be easier with a bong
Just throw my ashes in the face of who's got this week's number one country song

And now fancy boys prance around on stages where Waylon once stood
