You're part of my story

I had a secret that I kept to myself, yeah
I had a one-way ticket that was goin' nowhere

You could be the one (Ah-ah)
You could be my sun (Ah-ah)
Everything is fun till the walls come close and
Take away the light (Ah-ah)
Run into the night (Ah-ah)
Everything'll be alright (You said)

Baby, take the stage
You know the stars are comin' out for ya (You said)
Ebb and then they flow
Baby, feel the glow
You know, you know, you know

You were the one puttin' out that fire (Ah, ah-ah, ah, ah, ah)
And when the rain came down, I couldn't get much higher, yeah

You know, you know, you know

I didn't walk on the wild side or fall in the night sky
I didn't let the world know, I, I
I was fightin' a big fight, fightin' a dark light
Ragin' hard on the inside
Hard on the inside
