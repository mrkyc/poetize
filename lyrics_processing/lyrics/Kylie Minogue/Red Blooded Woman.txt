Ah, ah (Ah), ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah (Yeah), ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

Count backwards, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
Before you get too heated and turned on (This guy)
You should've learned your lesson all them times before
You've been bruised, you've been broken
And there's my mind saying "Think before you go
Through that door, it could lead you nowhere" (This guy)
Has got you all romantic crazy in your head
Do you think I listen? No, I don't care

'Cause I can't focus, I can't stop
You got me spinning 'round, 'round, 'round, 'round (Like a record)
I can't focus, it's too hot (Inside)
You'll never get to heaven if you're scared of getting high

Boy, boy, let me keep freaking around, I wanna get down
I'm a red-blooded woman, what's the point of hanging around?
Boy, boy, don't want to keep turning it down
When this girl wants to rock with you (Yeah)
Boy, boy, let me keep freaking around, I wanna get down
I'm a red-blooded woman, what's the point of hanging 'round?
Boy, boy, don't want to keep turning it down
When this girl wants to rock with you
You might also like
My conscience saying "Get down off this dream
It's too dangerous and deadly" (This guy)
Has got you talking 'round in circles, can't you see?
All for the sake of sexy (You're loving it)
Then there's my sense saying "Stop before you fall
I don't want to pick you up again" (This guy)
Has got you all romantic, crazier each day
Do you think I listen? There's no way

'Cause I can't focus, I can't stop
You got me spinning 'round, 'round, 'round, 'round (Like a record)
I can't focus, it's too hot (Inside)
You'll never get to heaven if you're scared of getting high

Boy, boy, let me keep freaking around, I wanna get down
I'm a red-blooded woman, what's the point of hanging around?
Boy, boy, don't want to keep turning it down
When this girl wants to rock with you
Boy, boy, let me keep freaking around, I wanna get down
I'm a red-blooded woman, what's the point of hanging 'round?
Boy, boy, don't want to keep turning it down
When this girl wants to rock with you
Let me keep freaking around (Freaking around)
Red-blooded woman
It's too hot inside
You'll never get to heaven if you're scared of getting high
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la (Freaking around)
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la (Freaking around)
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la (Freaking around)
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la (Freaking around)

Boy, boy, let me keep freaking around, I wanna get down
I'm a red-blooded woman, what's the point of hanging around?
Boy, boy, don't want to keep turning it down
