Fashion and attitude
Right on the money
How 'bout an interview?
Talk to me, honey
Was just about to walk out
Turned my body right 'round
If you wanna get down
Boy, let's have a ball

This is the last chance
For the first dance
Bring your body close (Bring your body close)
So if you got a minute
Then the DJ gon' play my song
The one that always turns me on

Last chance
To be my baby
Last chance
The final call
Last chance
The music's playing
Last chance
To come and get that first dance
My body's talking
First dance, it's critical
Last chance
So all I'm saying
We could have a ball

Nights are for having fun
Summer's for lovin'
Sometimes we fall in love
All of a sudden
So put your arms around me
Let me feel your heartbeat
If you're feeling lucky we could have a ball

This is the last chance
For the first dance
Bring your body close (Bring your body close)
So if you got a minute
Then the DJ gon' play my song
The one that always turns me on

Last chance
To be my baby
Last chance
The final call
Last chance
The music's playing
Last chance
To come and get that first dance
My body's talking
First dance, it's critical
Last chance
So all I'm saying
We could have a ball
Last chance
To be my baby
Last chance
The final call
Last chance
The music's playing
Last chance
To come and get that first dance
My body's talking
First dance, it's critical
Last chance
So all I'm saying
We could have a ball
Underneath the lights
Feels like you and I own the night
Let's make some magic supercalifragilistic love
I'll make you feel like there ain't no one in the room but us

This is the last chance
For the first dance
Bring your body close (Bring your body close)
So if you got a minute
Then the DJ gon' play my song
The one that always turns me on

Last chance
To be my baby
Last chance
