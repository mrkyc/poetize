This isn't goodbye
I just need a little time to hide
We're forever you and I
And you know it
Wouldn't give it all away
'Cause we weathered that storm and the pouring rain
When I need a little love
You show it

And nothing beats that high
But coming down from you
Well, it takes just a little time
So I put it in writing

This is au revoir, I won't go that far
(You'll still see me, you'll still hear me, love you dearly, ah-ah)
And this is not the end, I'll come back again
(You'll still see me, you'll still hear me, love you dearly, yours sincerely)

Every little word
Every dance I do when I'm shaking it for you
Even when it hurts
There's nothing on earth I wouldn't do for you
You might also like
'Cause nothing beats that high
But coming down from you
Well, it takes just a little time
So I put it in writing

This is au revoir, I won't go that far
(You'll still see me, you'll still hear me, love you dearly ah-ah)
And this is not the end, I'll come back again
(You'll still see me, you'll still hear me, love you dearly, yours sincerely)

Give me those thrills, I won't forget ya
Put it all down in a love letter
Love letter
Love letter
(Sincerely yours)
Give me those thrills, I won't forget ya
(Sincerely yours)
Put it all down in a love letter
(Sincerely yours)
Love letter
So I put it in writing (Put it in writing)

This is au revoir, I won't go that far
(You'll still see me, you'll still hear me, love you dearly ah-ah)
And this is not the end, I'll come back again
(You'll still see me, you'll still hear me, love you dearly, yours sincerely)
Give me those thrills, I won't forget ya
Put it all down in a love letter
Love letter
