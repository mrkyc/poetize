If I share a little secret
Can you keep it?
It wasn't supposed to be a thing
Disco ballin' every weekend
Till you walked in (Disco)
You got me seeing different

I was wishing my time away
Ay-ay-ay, ay-ay-ay
Now I'm wishing for one more day
Ay-ay-ay, ay-ay-ay

Come on
One second without you is just too long
Been calling out your name like it's my song
Keep counting down the days to you
It's getting me through those Monday blues

Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday
It's the weekend (It's the weekend)
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday
It's the weekend (It's the weekend)
You might also like
I thought that we were only doing the hustle
I let my heart go
I got to know your skeleton
You told me you like Earth, Wind and Fire
And that made my mind up
Baby, I remember when

I was wishing my time away
Ay-ay-ay, ay-ay-ay
Now I'm wishing for one more day
Ay-ay-ay, ay-ay-ay

Come on
One second without you is just too long
Been calling out your name like it's my song
Keep counting down the days to you
It's getting me through those Monday blues

Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday
It's the weekend (It's the weekend)
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday
It's the weekend (It's the weekend)
Oh
You make every day feel like Saturday
Let's go
Oh, you get me through those Monday blues (Come on)
Ooh-ooh
Get me to the weekend
Get me to the weekend
Ooh-ooh (Ooh)
Get me to the weekend
Get me to the weekend

Come on
One second without you is just too long
Been calling out your name like it's my song
Keep counting down the days to you
It's getting me through those Monday blues

Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday
It's the weekend (It's the weekend)
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday
