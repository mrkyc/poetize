Woop

Every day's the same
Feeling every shade of grey, ay
Playing by the rules when you wanna be led astray, ay
Gonna miss that train, don't take me home
I've got all I need right here
Soaking up the sound, gonna wash it all away

Raining glitter down on us tonight
Covering us all in magic
Never even seen them stars so bright
As the look in your eyes
Raining glitter down on us tonight
No more hiding in the shadows
Ooh, you look like diamonds in the light
Everybody put your hands up to the sky
And let it rain
Whoop

We can let it rain
Let it rain down silver and gold, oh
We all want the same
Yeah, we're looking for that hand to hold, ooh
And that stolen kiss that feels so good
That it might just change your world
You can call us fools, but these dreams will never get old
You might also like
Raining glitter down on us tonight
Covering us all in magic
Never even seen them stars so bright
As the look in your eyes
Raining glitter down on us tonight
No more hiding in the shadows
Ooh, you look like diamonds in the light
Everybody put your hands up to the sky
And let it rain

This is what it's about
Never stop
Whoop
Say my name, hold me tight
In the drop
Woop
'Cause we're not, no we're not giving up on love

Raining glitter down on us tonight
Covering us all in magic
Never even seen them stars so bright
As the look in your eyes
Raining glitter down on us tonight
No more hiding in the shadows
Ooh, you look like diamonds in the light
Everybody put your hands up to the sky
And let it rain
Whoop
Baby let it rain
