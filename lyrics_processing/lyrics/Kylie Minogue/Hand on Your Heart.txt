Put your hand on your heart and tell me
That we're through, ooh, oh
Ooh, whoa
Put your hand on your heart
Hand on your heart

Well, it's one thing to fall in love
But another to make it last
I thought that we were just beginning
And now you say we're in the past
Oh, look me in the eye
And tell me we are really through
You know it's one thing to say you love me
But another to mean it from the heart
And if you don't intend to see it through
Why did we ever start?
Oh, I wanna hear you tell me
You don't want my love

Put your hand on your heart
And tell me it's all over
I won't believe it 'til you
Put your hand on your heart
And tell me that we're through, ooh, oh
Put your hand on your heart
Hand on your heart
You might also like
They like to talk about forever
But most people never get the chance
Do you wanna lose our love together
To find a new romance?
Oh, I wanna hear you tell me
You don't want my love

Put your hand on your heart
And tell me it's all over
I won't believe it 'til you
Put your hand on your heart
And tell me that we're through, ooh, oh
Put your hand on your heart
And tell me it's all over
I won't believe it 'til you
Put your hand on your heart
And tell me that we're through, ooh, oh
Put your hand on your heart
Hand on your heart

Hand on your heart, hand on your heart
Hand on your heart, hand on your heart
Oh, look me in the eye
And tell me we are really through
Put your hand on your heart
And tell me it's all over
I won't believe it 'til you
Put your hand on your heart
And tell me that we're through, ooh, oh
Put your hand on your heart
And tell me it's all over
I won't believe it 'til you
Put your hand on your heart
And tell me that we're through, ooh, oh
Put your hand on your heart
And tell me it's all over
I won't believe it 'til you
Put your hand on your heart
And tell me that we're through, ooh, oh
Put your hand on your heart
And tell me it's all over
I won't believe it 'til you
Put your hand on your heart
