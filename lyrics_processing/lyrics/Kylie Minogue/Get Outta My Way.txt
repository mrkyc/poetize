What's the worst thing that could happen to you?
Take a chance tonight and try something new
You're getting boring, you're oh-so boring
And I don't recognize the zombie you've turned into

Don't worry 'cause tonight, I got you
You can take a seat, do what you normally do
I'm about to let you see (You see)
This is what'll happen if you ain't giving your girl what she needs

Leave you, move on to a perfect stranger
You talk, I walk, wanna feel the danger
See me with him and it's turning you on
It's got me saying
Ain't getting me back at the end of this song
Get outta my way, get outta my way
Got no more to say, he's taken your place
Get outta my way, way outta my way
Got no more to say, he's taken your place
Get outta my way

Now I got a taste, I wanna explore
Ain't going to waste, no, not anymore
You're going hard now, to win my heart
But too many times now, you've been coming up short
You might also like
Don't worry 'cause tonight, I got you
You can take a seat, do what you normally do
I'm about to let you see (You see)
This is what'll happen if you ain't giving your girl what she needs

Leave you, move on to a perfect stranger
You talk, I walk, wanna feel the danger
See me with him and it's turning you on
It's got me saying
Ain't getting me back at the end of this song
Get outta my way, get outta my way
Got no more to say, he's taken your place
Get outta my way, way outta my way
Got no more to say, he's taken your place
Get outta my way

No, I ain't going home 'cause I wanna stay
But I won't be alone no how, no way
Now I showed you what I'm made of (Made of)
This is what'll happen if you ain't giving your girl what she needs

Leave you, move on to a perfect stranger
You talk, I walk, wanna feel the danger
See me with him and it's turning you on
It's got me saying
Ain't getting me back at the end of this song
Get outta my way, get outta my way
Got no more to say, he's taken your place
Get outta my way, way outta my way
Got no more to say, he's taken your place
Get outta my way
No, I ain't going home
But I won't be alone
Now I showed you what I'm made of (Made of)
