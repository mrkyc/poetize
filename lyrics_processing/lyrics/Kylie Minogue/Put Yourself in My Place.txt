I can't take this situation
It's making me feel so blue
One moment you walk into my life
And now you're saying that we're through

I hear that you're in love now
Babe I don't know what to say
I can't believe that I still feel this way
I hear that you're in love now
Babe I don't know what to say
But before you decide you won't be mine
Put yourself in my place

You know the circle will come around
You're gonna put yourself (Put yourself)
In my place
When your lovers bring you down
And there's no one else around
You're gonna put yourself (Put yourself)
In my place

There's no rhyme or reason (Rhyme or reason)
That keeps me playing along (That keeps me playing along)
I guess that I just keep on believing
Inside you, love will know right from wrong
You might also like
I hear that you're in love now
Babe I don't know what to say
I can't believe that I still feel this way
I hear that you're in love now
Babe I don't know what to say
But before you decide you won't be mine
Put yourself in my place

You know the circle will come around
You're gonna put yourself (Put yourself)
In my place
When your lovers bring you down
And there's no one else around
You're gonna put yourself (Put yourself)
In my place


Circle will come around
You're gonna put yourself (Put yourself)
In my place
When your lovers bring you down
And there's no one else around
You're gonna put yourself (Put yourself)
In my place
You know the circle will come around
(It's gonna come around)
You're gonna put yourself (Put yourself)
In my place
When your lovers bring you down
And there's no one else around (no one around)
You're gonna put yourself (Put yourself)
In my place
In my place (Put yourself)
