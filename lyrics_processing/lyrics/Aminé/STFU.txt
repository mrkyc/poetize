Ayy, man, say, man
We startin' to get really tired of all that, all that hoopty hollerin'
Whoopty whoo, blaze blah y'all been talkin' lately, man
Go somewhere with all that, man, for real, shut up, shut up
All that talkin' y'all be doin' man, for real
"I'ma do this, I'ma do that," ugh

Every day you're talkin', every day you're in my ears
And every time we fightin', I gotta go and wipe your tears
'Cause if I don't (Don't), you gon' throw your problems on me
And then we'll fuss and fight when I just really wish you'd

Shut the fuck up, don't complicate it
Shut the fuck up, you're overexaggeratin'
Shut the fuck up, just have some patience
Shut the fuck up, quit givin' me hell

We keep lockin' eyes
Petty, so you're silent
You keep talkin' signs
Heart is in the science
Sleep, weep
Don't cry on me, don't die on me
All up in my face with the oochie wally wally
Soundin' like girls at a party on the molly (True)
I ain't tryna link or build (Nah)
Bubble space, bubble space, still, nigga, chill (Move)
Oh, you got a chain? Sick
Oh, you got some fame? Sick
Got a new Rolex, so you know he had to flex
'Cause the hoes gon' check
Five hundred K in my stash
Why you flex the only couple hundreds that you have? (Damn)
Screw needin' security for your insecurity (Yeah)
Callin' niggas broke, you should choke on your own words
Name droppin', pic croppin', dick hoppin', bill dodgin'
Boy, you know who you are (Yeah)
Man, why you wanna try so hard? (Why?)
Be yourself, be yourself and please
You might also like
Shut the fuck up, don't complicate it
Shut the fuck up, you're overexaggeratin'
Shut the fuck up, just have some patience
Shut the fuck up, get out my head

I'm waitin' my whole life, but I'm tired
Tired of wishin' for you
I'm waitin' patiently, but my mischief
Wishin' for somethin' new

Money come right back, never had to fight that
But I come back, back
Thought it was a night cap, life hit a hijack
Girl, I speak facts, facts
Heartbreak Drake for my first heartbreak
I was seventeen and I made mistakes
Went to dances, but I never did dance
Got pretty fly, but I never did land
Now I'm twenty-three
Lovin' and learnin' from all the lovers that I see
Nissan babes with the body burgundy
Love my car same way I used to love key
Friends need a Uber, sis need tuition
Fans want the music, but they want a politician
Pressure, pressure, pressure, pressure, pressure
Shut the fuck up, I don't need the extras
Spice girl sittin' in a red Mercedes
Attitude like I'm tryna have your babies
But I ain't tryna have no babies
No, I ain't tryna have no baby
Been waitin' my whole life, but I'm tired (So tired)
Tired of wishin' for you
I'm waitin' patiently, but my mischief
