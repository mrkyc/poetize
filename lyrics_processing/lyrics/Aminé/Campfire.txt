You no-business, born-insecure, junkyard motherfucker

Got a bad lil' mama and she always with the shits
Put a hundred in my pocket then a hundred on the rims
That's my lil' bitch, that's-that's my lil' bitch
That's my lil' bitch, that's-that's my lil' bitch
Put a red dress on her and some gas for the trip
Got a hundred in my pocket and a couple on the tint
That's my lil' bitch, that's-that's my lil' bitch
That's my lil' bitch, that's-that's my lil' bitch

Campfire, I'm a hot motherfucker (True)
Please, no pictures, I'm a tired motherfucker
Spidey senses tingle when it's fake niggas
Dreads swinging like they did the Harlem shake, nigga, that's true
West Coast 'til I D-I-E (Westside)
If you want respect, look me in my E-Y-E
I love my whips like a racist and travel lot of places (True)
Free my nigga, Hef, fuck the police (True)
Uh, Oprah for President (Woo), CLBN resident (Yeah)
Thizz-Face when I'm disgraced, that's the nigga in me (Uh-huh)
Might catch me at a Whole Foods (True)
And if you see that red Mercedes, then you know who

Yeah, yeah, campfire, I'm a scary lil' nigga
This run in my blood like Drew Barrymore, nigga
And my fit on ET, yo 'shit on EBT
So when you try and flex, I'm like, "What's yo' credit score, nigga?" (The fuck?)
Yeah, and that's word to my granny
Since fourteen, knew the route like Randy
Everything dandy, gray sweats with the Pennys
(Nausea, heartburn) Side effects may vary
Yeah, fuck these niggas, where the child lock?
So many hits, I could have my own NOW! comp
Pen a triple album full of all my children
No difference from Kidz Bop, book 'em in the Hilton
