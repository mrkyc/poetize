Excuse me ma'am
You're the one that I need
Fell in love, you cut me deep
Saturn girl, you're ecstasy, baby
I need your love, to stay alive
Out this world, you're out of sight
Saturn girl, you changed my life, oh

Help me find new ways to get around (I still love you girl)
You're the one I love, hope it counts for something
(I hope it counts for something)
Help me find new ways to get around (I'll protect you girl)
You're the one I love, hope it counts for something
