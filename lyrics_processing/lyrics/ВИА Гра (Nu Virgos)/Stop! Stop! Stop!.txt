No I didn't trust him, but he rushed me to feel
Tried to mesmerize me and was all sex appeal
Told me everything that I was longing to hear
Shiny and handsome my souvenir
And then all of a sudden I have fallen in love
He would put me down, but I'd still place him above
Tired of searching for the love that still lives in him
Giving my everything like a souvenir

Given up my heart, in the name of a memory
Fallen down like rain, he could feel every drop
Now I know I have, have the courage to tell him
Tell him to stop stop stop
Given up my heart, in the name of a memory
Fallen down like rain, he could feel every drop
Now I know I have, have the courage to tell him
Tell him to stop stop stop

I've become invisible,  melt away at night
Dreaming once so colourful becomes black and white
Loving once so wonderful is no longer here
So I'll keep this feeling like a souvenir
