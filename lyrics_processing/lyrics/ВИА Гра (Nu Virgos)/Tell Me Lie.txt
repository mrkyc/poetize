Sorry for my love, I am sorry for my grief
I do everything around you trying to comfort your belief
Sorry that my hope is still flashing in my soul
I feel lovely, I feel lonely, is it rise or is it fall?
Keeping questions in my mind, looking for the truth

Tell me just one word and I will follow you nowhere
I will tell you all my secrets, you've got only to be fair
Symbols of your love disappeared in your hate
You left nothing for my dignity, it's my destiny, my fate
I believe in bitter truth, I believe in you

You can never prevent it
Know that you will repent it
Broken hearts will be broken
Now and then forever
One more chance I will give you
Take my hand -- I'll forgive you
Tell me lie I'll believe it
Tell me lie, but don't leave me
Tell me lie, but don't leave me

Give me just one word, I'll switch off the shining stars
Celebration is now over, it is over for all times
Sorry for my love, I am sorry for my pain
Trying hard to follow treatment but it makes me go insane
I am missing you for now, I believe in you
You might also like
You can never prevent it
Know that you will repent it
Broken hearts will be broken
Now and then forever
One more chance I will give you
Take my hand -- I'll forgive you
Tell me lie I'll believe it
Tell me lie, but don't leave me
Tell me lie, but don't leave me
You can never prevent it
Know that you will repent it
Broken hearts will be broken
Now and then forever
One more chance I will give you
Take my hand -- I'll forgive you
Tell me lie I'll believe it
Tell me lie, but don't leave me
Tell me lie, but don't leave me
