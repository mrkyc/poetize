I don't even try
Live on my own without your lovin' sexy toxic beaty
Can't obediently face my bitter destiny
You are everywhere
In every face, in every shadow, hidden in tghe darkness
Nere deeply in my heart pulsing your tenderness

Don't let go, don't leave my life
You have captured the world of my desire
Cross my heart, no farewell
Lucky my lunacy L.M.L
Take my hand give me your smile
Sun reflections in your diamond eyes
Hold me tight my singing bell
Lucky my lunacy L.M.L

Do what should be done
Fly to the ocean dressed in twilight follow your emotions
Just try to believe in wings of your cherished love
Be my only one
Stay with like a lovely magic, like a breath of fire
Be what you should be, only for me, for us
You might also like
Don't let go, don't leave my life
You have captured the world of my desire
Cross my heart, no farewell
Lucky my lunacy L.M.L
Take my hand give me your smile
Sun reflections in your diamond eyes
Hold me tight my singing bell
Lucky my lunacy L.M.L

Quand je te vois sourire
Mon coeur s`epanouit
Et je voudrais te dire
Ce que mon coeur me dit!
Alor toute ma vie
A mes yeux apparait;
Je maudis, et je prie
Et je pleure en secret
Car sans toi, mon seul guide
Sans ton regard de feu
Mon passe parait vide
Comme le ciel sans Dieu

Don't let go, don't leave my life
You have captured the world of my desire
Cross my heart, no farewell
Lucky my lunacy L.M.L
Take my hand give me your smile
Sun reflections in your diamond eyes
Hold me tight my singing bell
Lucky my lunacy L.M.L

Lucky my lunacy L.M.L
Lucky my lunacy L.M.L
