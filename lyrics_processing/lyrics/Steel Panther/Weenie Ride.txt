So I wrote you this song
If you've ever been to Disneyland
You know the lines can be real long
But I got a ride that the bitches love
And you won't have to wait at all
All you've got to do is ditch your boyfriend
And give sexy Michael Starr a call
I'll take your ass for a weenie ride
Spread your cheeks and swallow your pride
It's scary like a rollercoaster
It will stretch you out so wide
Gonna take your ass for a weenie ride
Hold on tight 'cause I'm coming inside
It's better than a ferris wheel or a water slide
It's a weenie ride
I want to sing about a thing
That's funner than a swing
And better than the Monkey bars
You can take it on the couch
Or your waterbed
Or in the back of your Daddy's car
See Steel Panther LiveGet tickets as low as $44You might also likeAnd it's open all day
Nighttime too
Seven fucking days a week
It only shuts down intermittently
So I can take a leak
So put that snatch on a weenie ride
Ride her face down or on your side
You'll be amazed what you can fit in there
When some leverage is applied
Open your legs for a weenie ride
You won't be the first to see it and cry
Just bring the baby wipes and some astroglide
It's a weenie ride
Oh yeah
Scream for me... Scream out in Ecstacy...
Honey, won't you try the weenie ride
You're never gonna be the same
Baby, how you gonna get to Heaven
If you can't take a little pain?
Step right up for a weenie ride
It's even more fun when you're gagged and tied
Oops, I think I got a little DNA
All over your backside
Go on and tell your friends about the weenie ride
You can charge admission, baby, I don't mind
Even with a big old muff you won't get denied
For the weenie ride
Ooooooooh
Weenie Weenie Weenie Weenie Weenie Weenie Weenie Ride (It's a weenie ride)

Thighs)
