Like a monkey at the zoo
I don't care if you're a monkey
With an ass that's red and blue
Cause I'm gonna fuck you doggy-style
The way chihuahua's do
But I got one request
That I just have to ask of you
Turn out the lights
Before you suck my dick
Someone beat you with an ugly stick
I wanna fuck, but you make me sick, so
Turn out the lights, turn out the lights
So you think that I'm a loser
Cause I used to be in jail
And I got my GED Diploma
Last week in the mail
But at least a man can exercise
If he gets too fat
But I've got news for you
Your face will always look like that, haha

Before I take a ride
You don't seem to have a good side
Whip out a condom and the astro-glide
Turn out the lights, turn out the lights
Ugh, I think I'm gonna hurl
Jesus Christ, I hope that you're a girl
Open your mouth, baby, here come the pearls
Turn out the lights, turn out the lights
Tell me when it's over
Please tell me you don't have VD
Thank god that it's over, yeah
Well we all have indiscretions
I think you're my biggest yet
Had to roll you in some flour
Just to find where you were wet
Well this never would've happened
If I hadn't lost that bet
I wonder if our grandkids
Will ask us how we met
Turn out the lights
Girl it's way to bright
I don't wanna look at your cellulite
There ain't nothing on your body that's tight, baby
Turn out the lights
Turn out the lights
Before you take off your clothes
I wanna tie you up with some garden hose
Slap your tits and rub my balls on your nose
Turn out the lights
Turn out the lights
Before we do the deed
Before I cover your box with my seed
I'm gonna pound ya till ya fucking start to bleed, bitch
