When you came to the show
You'd be getting on the bus with me
And doing some blow
Your mama's in the parking lot
Looking for you
She's gonna find you when I'm done
All covered with goo
Ooh, mama's little girl got all sticky
Hair on your nipples
Zits on your box
In Oklahoma city
You're considered a fox
What did you have to do
For that backstage pass
Cause I found a Poison laminate
Inside of your ass
So come on pretty baby
Suck my balls all night
The driver says we're leaving
Come morning light

And do me right
Oooh, come on pretty baby
Suck my balls all night
Yeah that's it
Aah, you're a good girl
I wanna thank you for the loving
That you spread over me
I'll be singing about you
On the next CD
And you won't have to wonder
If you caught VD
You'll be screaming my name
When you sit down to pee
Hey Michael Starr you motherfucker
Whoa, whoa
So come on pretty baby
Suck my balls all night
I'm hopped on Cialis
And you're high as a kite
I know it tastes infected
But I think it's alright
Oooh, come on pretty baby
Suck my balls all night
All around the world
There's a hundred billion stupid girls
Just like you
Just begging for nuts to chew
So come on pretty baby
Suck my balls all night
Your daddy's looking for me
And he's ready to fight
The driver says we're leaving
Come morning light
Oooh, come on pretty baby
Suck my balls all night
So come on pretty baby
Suck my balls all night
I'm hopped up on Cialis
And you're high as a kite
I know it tastes infected
But I think it's alright
Oooh, come on pretty baby
Suck my balls all night
Come on pretty baby
Suck my balls all night
The driver says we're leaving
Come morning light
Spit out that retainer
And do me right
Oooh, come on pretty baby
Suck my balls all night
So come on pretty baby
