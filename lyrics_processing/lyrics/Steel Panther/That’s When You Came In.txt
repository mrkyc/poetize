Every night I'd party till I was stupid stumbling drunk
And the walls were drenched in vomit spit
And other peoples spunk
And an endless line of 18 year old stripper druggie whores
Would be winding to my bunk
From right outside the tour bus doors
But I couldn't help but want
For something just a little more

That's when you came in and blew me
That's when you came in and blew me
That's when you came in and blew me away

I was looking for a woman, more beautiful than most
And not just in the retouched facebook selfies that they post
Who'd refrain from talking only of herself when in my bed
Not that I'd ever consider it, but someone I could wed
I needed someone just like me, but I got idiots instead

That's when you came in and blew me
That's when you came in and blew me
That's when you came in and blew me away
See Steel Panther LiveGet tickets as low as $44You might also like
Of all the girls I've ever known
You showed me things nobody else could show me
It doesn't matter where you go
You'll always be the one I want to blow me
Cause you blow me away!


I was ready to retire, maybe move to Mexico
One too many rockers parties, one too many skanky hoes
After all the critics said, our debut record was our peak
Now I couldn't hit the high notes
Sometimes I couldn't even speak
But the band had dates in Germany
For just another week

That's when you came in and blew me
That's when you came in and blew me
That's when you came in and blew me away
That's when you came in and blew me
That's when you came in and blew me
That's when you came in and blew me away
You blew me away
You blew me away
