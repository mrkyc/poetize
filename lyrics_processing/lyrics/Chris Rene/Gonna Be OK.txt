I learned to make 'em run like the revenant
But I never had a nine milli or a mac 11
I was enticed by the G life
When I met them boys from the east side

Yeah, making money in the street life
You could get stunted drinking honey from the bee hive
Made my way through the troubles sometimes
You could say I always had something else on my mind

Yeah, I've been all about that mean code
When I was younger always look up to the hero
Everyone else they liked Scarface, DeNiro
They used used call me a weirdo

If you ever felt like your world is over
Thought about just giving up
Feeling like you're fucked up when you're sober
And your best shot's not enough
Have you ever thought about just ending
Even toy with the curtain call
I know how you feel right now my friend see
I've been backed on against the wall
It's gonna be ok, hey hey
It's gonna be ok, hey hey
It's gonna be ok, hey hey
It's gonna be ok, hey hey

I remember I was rapping in the twilight saying
It would be so nice living in the limelight
It was 1999 right I never saw it coming
Grinding hit me blindside
Been so many years since I looked back
I know that it's this music makes me look at my life
In a different perspective to many studio sessions
Got my music obsession without no musical lessons
Learned to play punk rock listened to other lessons
I was raised west side and used my mind as a weapon
I got cracked a few times and I spat a few lines
Ain't saying that it's cool just glad that I survived

If you ever felt like your world is over
Thought about just giving up
Feeling like you're fucked up when you're sober
And your best shot's not enough
Have you ever thought about just ending
Even toy with the curtain call
I know how you feel right now my friend see
I've been backed on against the wall
It's gonna be ok, hey hey
It's gonna be ok, hey hey
It's gonna be ok, hey hey
It's gonna be ok, hey hey
Before this day is done
And it falls down out the sun
Just let me hear you say
It's gonna be ok, hey hey
It's gonna be ok, hey hey
It's gonna be ok, hey hey
It's gonna be ok, hey hey

If you ever felt like your world is over
Thought about just giving up
Feeling like you're fucked up when you're sober
And your best shot's not enough
Have you ever thought about just ending
Even toy with the curtain call
I know how you feel right now my friend see
I've been backed on against the wall
It's gonna be ok, hey hey
It's gonna be ok, hey hey
