As this moment comes like a tidal wave
Everything that I lost comes back again
I'm electrified brought me back to life
'Cause I loved you to death
And I'ma love you in the
Next life ,the next life
Next life ,the next life

I'm out here on the road so many different cities
I lose my mind wishing wishing you were here with me
It's been 8 months I seen my kids twice
I signed a deal feeling like I left you behind
But it's not true know that I'm just working hard
Praise where would I go to when I need to talk to God
It's what I gotta do for now until I reach the stars
Being this far from home, was it our vows
They sayin' your daddy so busy he can't even skype you
And on facebook they say that people like you
This is my next life I know there's more to come
I'm going for the belt this is only round 1

As this moment comes like a tidal wave
Everything that I lost comes back again
I'm electrified brought me back to life
'Cause I loved you to death
And I'ma love you in the
Next life ,the next life baby
Next time ,the next time sing it
You might also like
I wanna put my program first 'cause I'd be dead without it
Sometimes I ask myself am I really staying honest
Used to hit meetings every day now it's once a week
Swimming on a tidal wave trying not to sink
But I'ma hold on ye Chris a soldier
Like I'm walking on water Jesus on my shoulders
I hope I earn my wings 'cause I wanna fly
Home to my young homies sing a lullaby
Dad's gone yea I know how it feels
I cry about it yea I'm just tryin' to keep it real
Today's his birthday I know he's looking down
I gotta seize this moment 'cause I don't wanna drown

As this moment comes like a tidal wave
Everything that I lost comes back again
I'm electrified brought me back to life
'Cause I loved you to death
And I'ma love you in the
Next life ,the next life baby
Next time ,the next time sing it

If you're lost at sea and you're draining water
When the water's rising you just paddle harder
Put your hands up drop pennyes ye
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
If you ever doubted don't doubt no more
Message in the bottle washed upon the shore
I said be ready when your wave comes
I'm coming home to you after this record's done
As this moment comes like a tidal wave
Everything that I lost comes back again
I'm electrified brought me back to life
'Cause I loved you to death
And I'ma love you in the
Next life ,the next life baby
