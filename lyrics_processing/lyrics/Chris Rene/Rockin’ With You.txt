You've got your friends, they say that I'm just no good
Because they heard my name buzzin' through the hood
Why go through all the things that I used to do?
To make a long story short, I'm only rockin' with you
I did my dirt, but hey, who ain't got a past?
It's a new day, I just wanna make it last
So when I say "I love," just know that it's true
To make a long story short, I'm only rockin' with you

Them other girls now
That used to come around
Don't mean a thing now
Cause I'm only rockin' with you
So let your guard down
Cause girl I'm all about
Being your man now
Cause I'm only rockin' with you

No need to lie, ok, I know I was wrong
For all those times those girls were calling my phone
I swear I learned my lesson when you said you were through
To make a long story short, I'm only rockin' with you
So all those games I've played, I put them aside
Cause I can't live without you here in my life
It might have took a little time but you're the one that I choose
To make a long story short I'm only rockin' with you
You might also like
Them other girls now
That used to come around
Don't mean a thing now
Cause I'm only rockin' with you
So let your guard down
Cause girl I'm all about
Being your man now
Cause I'm only rockin' with you

I been a ladies man, ever since I was a baby, man
I don't need a thousand girls, just one woman that'll rock my world
You waited for me when I got out of jail
You held me down when they thought I would fail
I'm doing good yeah you know that I would, right
Now it's just us let's toast to the good life

Them other girls now
That used to come around
Don't mean a thing now
Cause I'm only rockin' with you
So let your guard down
Cause girl I'm all about
Being your man now
Cause I'm only rockin' with you
Them other girls now
That used to come around
