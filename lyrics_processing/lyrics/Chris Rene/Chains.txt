They say that I'm a dreamer
That makes me a believer
Even got it inked un on my arms (Ayo, ayo)
I've been thinking (Ayo, ayo)
I got a reason (Ayo, ayo)
Make a plan and start all over

See, we all could be happy people
If we stop feeding our own egos
And live our lives right where we are
Instead of where we wanna be

Are you ready to break these chains?
Are you ready to fly away?
We were made for more than this
Time is all we got to give
We don't have to live this way
Are you ready to break these chains?
Ready to break these chains

Yo, this ain't no fairy tale
I made life long friends in jail
I love them 'til the day I die
Uh huh, yep (Ayo, ayo)
You remind me (Ayo, ayo)
A little of me (Ayo, ayo)
And there's nothing we can't change
You might also like
See, we all could be happy people
If we stop feeding our own egos
And live our lives right where we are
Instead of where we wanna be

Are you ready to break these chains?
Are you ready to fly away?
We were made for more than this
Time is all we got to give
We don't have to live this way
Are you ready to break these chains?
Ready to break these chains, yeah

I've been locked down, chained to my own thoughts
Now I rock out, break out my own box
I'm so blessed, I'm so happy it's so right
I'm fresh dressed, my best vest is so tight (Ayo, ayo)
That's what I'm saying
Crazy in a whole another lane, that's amazing
Just to let you know
Yo, I'm coming from the other side
Still, I'll always be a kid in my mother's eyes
See, we all could be happy people
If we stop feeding our own egos
And live our lives right where we are
Instead of where we wanna be

Are you ready to break these chains?
Are you ready to fly away?
We were made for more than this
Time is all we got to give
We don't have to live this way
Are you ready to break these chains?
Ready to break these chains, yeah

See, are you ready now?
