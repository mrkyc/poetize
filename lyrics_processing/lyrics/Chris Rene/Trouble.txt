Trouble, trouble
Uh-oh, uh-oh

She knows just the way to walk on by
That makes my heart stop
I don't, know the way to say good night
Cause she don't want me, to go nowhere
Without her there, she's everywhere
I don't need trouble, just some music
And a little chance to sing my song

That girl is trouble, trouble
From her head to her toes
Oh oh, oh oh, always taking off her clothes
Trouble, trouble
When her lips touch mine
Only had to happen one time
That girl is trouble, trouble
Like a sting from a bee
Oh oh, oh oh, and she's taking over me
Trouble, trouble, even blind men can see
That's why I gotta run, why I gotta run

Baby, baby

I woke up to hear her on my telephone
Talking crazy, she said, "come over now, nobody's home"
I said baby, I don't know if I should go tryna take it slow
I don't need trouble but I choose it
At least that's the way it seems yeah

That girl is trouble, trouble
From her head to her toes
Oh oh, oh oh, always taking off her clothes
Trouble, trouble
When her lips touch mine
Only had to happen one time
That girl is trouble, trouble
Like a sting from a bee
Oh oh, oh oh, and she's taking over me
Trouble, trouble, even blind men can see
That's why I gotta run, why I gotta run

Momma always said, "there'd be girls like this"
Never did I know they'd be so fine
First a passing glance, turned into a kiss
Now she's running through my mind
That girl is trouble, trouble
She is, that girl is trouble, trouble
Only had to happen one time
That girl is trouble, trouble
From her head to her toes
Oh oh, oh oh, always taking off her clothes
Trouble, trouble
When her lips touch mine
Only had to happen one time
That girl is trouble, trouble
Like a sting from a bee
Oh oh, oh oh, and she's taking over me
Trouble, trouble, even blind men can see
That's why I gotta run, why I gotta run

(Trouble, trouble, oh oh, oh oh)
It only had to happen one time
It only had to happen two times
