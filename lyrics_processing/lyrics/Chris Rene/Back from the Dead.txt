Been left for dead here
A thousand miles from home
With a hole in my chest right here
And a bullet in my gun, oh no
Feels like I lost my life
Guess I played the game so I paid the price
But it was cold-blooded the way you left me here
Now I'm the living dead, girl, since you disappeared

And I know we both made mistakes
Sometimes that's just what it takes
Still I just can't let you go

Just call out my name (And I'll find you)
No matter what's in the way (I'll remind you)
Nothing can stop me, don't care what they say
Girl, if you need me, I'm coming back from the dead

It feels like I'm stranded
Nowhere else to go
It's worse than I imagined, oh
A life without a soul, oh no
Since you blew past I took my last breath
I guess nothing lasts, maybe not even death
But that was cold-hearted the way you played your part
Now I'm the living dead, girl, since you took my heart
You might also like
And I know we both made mistakes
But sometimes that's just what it takes
Still I just can't let you go

Just call out my name (And I'll find you)
No matter what's in the way (I'll remind you)
Nothing can stop me, don't care what they say
Girl if you need me, I'm coming back from the dead

So I'm laying here 6 feet deep in the ground
Ever since you left and you're you're you're not around
But it just ain't living without you by my side
'Cause only your love can bring me back to life

Just call out my name (And I'll find you)
No matter what's in the way (I'll remind you)
Nothing can stop me, don't care what they say
Girl if you need me, I'm coming back from the dead
Just call out my name (And I'll find you)
No matter what's in the way (I'll remind you)
Nothing can stop me, don't care what they say
Girl if you need me, I'm coming back from the dead
Just call out my name (And I'll find you)
No matter what's in the way (I'll remind you)
Nothing can stop me, don't care what they say
Girl if you need me, I'm coming back from the dead
Just call out my name (And I'll find you)
No matter what's in the way (I'll remind you)
Nothing can stop me, don't care what they say
Girl if you need me, I'm coming back from the dead
And I'll find you
