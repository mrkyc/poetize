I was sitting in a coffee shop, just minding my own affairs
When all of a sudden this policeman caught me unawares
He said, "Is your name Pedro?", I said, uh, "Yeah, I guess so"
He said, "Then come with me cause you're the man we been looking for"

I said, "Hey, man, I've been framed"
Hey, no, really, man, I was framed
Aw, I never do nothing wrong, man
But every time I get the blame (I've been framed!)

They put me in the lineup and let the bright lights shine
There was ten poor dudes like me standing in that line
I knew I was the victim of somebody's evil plan
When this scroungy looking dude came up and said
"Yeah, that's him, man"

Hey, wait a minute, man, I've been framed, man
Aw, listen to me, judge, I was framed
I never do nothing wrong
Aw, but every time I get the blame (Hey, I been framed!)

Then the prosecuting attorney started prosecuting on me
That dude gave me the first, second, and third degree
He said, "Where were you on the night of July 29?"
I said, "Man, I was home in bed"
He said, "Judge, that man is lying"

I said, "Wait a minute, man, I was framed, man"
Hey judge, listen to me, man, really, you got to believe me, I been framed, man
I never do nothing wrong
Aw, but every time I get the blame (Oh, I was framed!)

Now look, I deny the charges of having any weed
And I also deny the charges of taking any speed
I deny the charges of selling any grass
But when the judge looked down and said "Guilty"
I said, "Judge, you can kiss my-" (Framed!)

Judge, I'm telling you the truth, I was framed, man
I never do nothing wrong
Aw, but every time I get the blame (Hey, I was framed!)

Oh, framed
You got to believe me, judge
That wasn't even my stuff, I was holding it for a friend, man
Could this face life, man?
Oh, come on, judge, don't send me to camp, man
I just got my car fixed, man
Look, I just got a new tattoo and everything, man
Oh, man, what a bummer, man
Hey, come on, judge, give me a break, please
Aw, judge, come on, man, don't take me away, I was framed
