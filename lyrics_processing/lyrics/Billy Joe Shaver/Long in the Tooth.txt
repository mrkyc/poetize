Long in the tooth, long in the tooth
I'm telling you children I'm long in the tooth
What I use to do all night, now takes all night to do
But the women folk don't complain
Cause I still got a young man's brain
I still do more than most men do
I'm telling you women I'm long in the tooth
(Chorus)
Long in the tooth
Long in the tooth
I'm telling you folks I'm long in the tooth
I used to go bear huntin with a switch
Sleep all week with the same old witch
I put that grisly over my knee
But I'm not the man I used to be
(Verse 2)
Long in the tooth, long in the tooth
I'm telling you telling I'm long in the tooth
I had an alligator kiss my ass
It's mostly luck he's runnin' that fast
Showed him a thing or two
I'm wearin alligator vest, eatin' alligator stew
You might also like(Chorus)
Long in the tooth
Long in the tooth
I'm telling you children I'm long in the tooth
Throw that football a country mile
Leave all the women with a satisfied smile
I used to be so wild and free
Sometimes I wonder what happened to me
(Interlude)
Long in the tooth, long in the tooth
I'm telling you children I'm long in the tooth
Long in the tooth, long in the tooth
I'm telling you woman I'm long in the tooth
(Instrumental break)
(Verse 3)
Time did a number on me
I ain't the man I used to be
Running at speed but I'm little at motion
Live up to all them stories been told
(Interlude x2)
Long in the tooth, long in the tooth
I'm telling you children I'm long in the tooth
Long in the tooth, long in the tooth
I'm telling you woman I'm long in the tooth
Long in the tooth, long in the tooth
I'm telling you children I'm long in the tooth
Long in the tooth, long in the tooth
I'm telling you folk I'm long in the tooth
Long in the tooth, long in the tooth
Long in the tooth, long in the tooth
Long in the tooth, long in the tooth
