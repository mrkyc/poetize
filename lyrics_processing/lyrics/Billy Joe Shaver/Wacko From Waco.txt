Ain't no doubt about it
Shot a man there in the head
But can't talk much about it
He was trying to shoot me
But he took too long to aim
Anybody in my place
Would have done the same
I don't start fights, I finish fights
That's the way I'll always be
I'm a wacko from Waco
You best not mess with me
Joe Jamail said I was like
A fly in buttermilk
Trapped in a Waco bottle
I was bound to get kilt
Dar Jamail said, "Billy
Houston's where you need to be
If you're going back to Waco
You're leaving without me"
It's nice to be important
More important to be nice
If you're shootin' dice in Waco
You'll roll snake eyes every time
You might also likeDicky DeGuerin took my case
And didn't charge a thing
He said Waco bells would be easy to unring
Willile Nelson, Bob Duvall, and Logan V, too
Stood right up for me
The way they always do
I'm damned if I don't, damned if I do
I'm a wacko from Waco
I'm telling you the truth
I was born in Corsicana
They said Billy can you do it
I said course I can
Just point it out
And I'll get right to it
Corsicana, Texas, has been real good to me
They knew I had to shoot that man
Before that man shot me
I should have known the truth
Would finally set me free
I guess living down in Waco
Made a wacko out of me

A wacko from Waco is still on the run
A writer, a singer a son of a gun
Don't cross him, don't boss him
Stay out of his way
Don't give him no trouble
Cause you'll just make his day
I'm damned if I don't damned if I do
I'm a wacko from Waco I'm telling you the truth
I'm damned if I don't, damned if I do
I'm a wacko from Waco
