Shop barbecue
Party shop barbecue
Car wash jumping, wheels they shinning up
Everybody dressed up looking good
Grab my shades so the sun don't blind me, no
There's nothing like summertime in the hood

Let's have a block party
(get on up, ain't got nothing else to do)
Let's have a barbecue
(grab your phone, everybody go call your crew)
Let's have a block party
(it's summertime, and the sun don't set til 9:00)
As long as the beat don't break, and the wine keep popping, we gonna keep rocking til the cops come Knocking
Just get down now, turn around now
Grab a hand now, turn around now
Move around now, to the left now
To the right now, shake a hand now - stop
Grab a hand now, turn around now
Move around now, to the left now - stop
To the right now, one time now
Two times now - Chuck Brown let's rock!
Cops harassing, trying to shut us down
But ain't nobody breaking rules, no
We ain't trying to hurt nobody officer
We ain't trying to act no fool - we so cool
And we're just trying to move and
