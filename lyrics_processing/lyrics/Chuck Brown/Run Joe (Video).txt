Selling micas behind closed doors
The cops grab Moe and as Joe runs out
Brother Moe he began to shout
Run Joe!
Hey the man's at the door
Run Joe!
Hey man he won't let me go
Run Joe!
Run Joe as fast as you can
Run Joe!
These police holding me hand
Hide the crystal ball by the fence
So they won't find the evidence
Get somebody to tell a lie
Got to have me an alibi
Hurry home and get in your bed
Call the doctor and tie your head
Get somebody to call my bail
Don't want to stay in that fucking jail
Run Joe!
Hey the man's at the door
Run Joe!
Hey man he won't let me go
Run Joe!
Run Joe as fast as you can
Run Joe!
These police holding me hand
