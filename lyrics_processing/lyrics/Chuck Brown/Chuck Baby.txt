Hey watch out cause I'm coming for you
Well baby girl KK tell me what cha do
I said I come from DC you can't see me
Hey Chuckie B, let'em know what we do

I used to say I would never not in my days, ever change my ways
Too good at getting away with all them games I player
Smooth walker slick talker anything I did
Get out of a jam quicker that MacGyver did
Shit, I think I'm sprung now, I seen a dude up town
Who makes me what to settle down and have his son now
He might be the one now, I count it funny myself
I'll let my daddy, Chuck Brown, give you the run down

I was driving in my car one day
I saw a sexy lady walk my way
A banging body and a pretty face
So I whispered in her ear and said
"I really love your style and you dress so fly yo
Id love to see your pretty face in my show
I've been around the world from London to Chicago
But I ain't never met a girl like you
Shorty took a look into my eyes
And said she heard I was a crazy guy
I hit and run the Georgie/Porgy type
You like to kiss the girls and make them cry
I told her don't believe the hype cause I'm cool
Enough about me lets talk about you
I want to get to know you and make you my boo
Its all on you baby, and she said
You might also like
Chuck baby don't give a what, (And she said); Chuck baby don't give a ugh! (And he said);
Chuck baby don't give a what (And they said); Chuck baby don't give a ugh! (And you said)
Chuck baby don't give a what (That ain't true); Chuck baby don't give a ugh! (I love all of you)
Chuck baby don't give a what (You know what I do); Chuck baby don't give a ugh! (Owww)

So I shoot a couple of jokes, he laughin' and he gigglin
Tell by the look in his eyes he knows I'm feelin him
Throw a couple of hints, he act like he can't hear
I say I'm going to lunch why don't you meet me there
I swear, you think he own a store in G-town
He drivin a hard bargain while I'm trying to talk him down
Man you ready or not I can bring a car around
If not then let me know so I can go and shop around

So I asked her if she had a man
She didn't answer so I asked again
And baby I ain't trying to force your hand
Baby I'm just tryin to understand
Why you try to play so hard to get
And my name ain't no Romeo and you ain't Juliet
And she said

Chuck baby don't give a what, (And she said); Chuck baby don't give a ugh, (And he said);
Chuck baby dont give a what (And they said); Chuck baby dont give a ugh, (And you said)
Chuck baby dont give a what (That ain't true); Chuck baby dont give a ugh, (I love all of you)
Chuck baby don't give a what (You know what I do); Chuck baby don't give a ugh (Owww)
He said, you said, they said, he said, everybody said
Chuck baby dont give a what, Chuck baby dont give a
I said Chucky Thompson so sick with it, Chucky Browns baby girl so sick with it
