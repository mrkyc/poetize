There's something in your eyes
That's fought to revealing
Why must to be like this
A love without feeling
Something wrong with you And now
I see it in your eyes
Believe me when I say
It's gonna be OK !!
Paul:
I told you from the start, I won't't be demanding
If you have a change of heart, I'll be understanding
When love becomes a broken heart
And dreams begin to die
Believe me when I say
We'll work it out someway
Together :
I'll never try to hold you back
I wouldn't try controlling you
If it's what you want
It's what I want
I want what's best for you
And if there's something else that you're looking for
I'll be the first to help you try
Believe me when I say
It's hard to say goodbye
(Paul)
We've lost that loving touch
We used to feel so much
I try to hide the truth That's in my eyes
But when i feel, we're not in love
I know I'm losing you
Believe me when I say
We'll work it out someway
I'll never try to hold you back
I wouldn't try controlling you
If it's what you want
It's what I want
I want what's best for you
And if there's something else that you're looking for
I'll be the first to help you try
Believe me when I say
It's hard to say goodbye
Instrument. . . . . . . . . . 
If it's what you want
It's what I want
I want what's best for you
I'll never try to hold you back
I wouldn't try controlling you
If it's what you want
It's what I want
I want what's best for you
And if there's something else that you're looking for
I'll be the first to help you try
Believe me when I say
