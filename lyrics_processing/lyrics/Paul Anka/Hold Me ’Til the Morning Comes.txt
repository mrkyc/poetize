Two broken hearts, neither one knows what to say
Both falling for love, but not quite all the way
Look at us now, reaching back for yesterday
Wanting to know if the other wants to stay

After all I'm the one who said we're through
Now I can't live without you anymore
And out there lost is the dream that can't come true
Is it worth the reaching for?
Do you need me anymore, darling?

Hold me till the morning comes
Until I see your smile
Take all the sadness from your eyes
Hold me till the morning sun
Let me stay we've just begun
I wanna stay with you

Where shall we start? Tender words that we can share
And if we believe, in time we will get there
Look at us now, wanting more than words can say
Both falling in love but this time all the way

Out there lost are the words, I still love you
Are they worth the reaching for
Do you love me anymore, darling?

Hold me till the morning comes (Hold me)
Until I see your smile
Take all the sadness from your eyes
Hold me till the morning sun
Let me stay we've just begun
I wanna stay with you


Hold me till the morning comes
Until I see your smile
Take all the sadness from your eyes
Hold me till the morning sun
Let me stay we've just begun
I wanna stay with you

Would you love me in the morning? (Would you love me?)
Will you still be there in the morning? (Would you love me?)
Or would you leave without a warning? (Say you'll stay)
(Say you'll stay) Would you love me in the morning?
(Love me) Will you still be there in the morning?
(Love me) Or would you leave without a warning?
Say you love me too
(Say you'll stay) Would you love me in the morning?
(Love me) Will you still be there in the morning?
(Love me) Or would you leave without a warning?
Don't walk away
(Say you'll stay) Would you love me in the morning?
(Love me) Will you still be there in the morning?
(Love me) Or would you leave without a warning?
