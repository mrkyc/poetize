Lately it seems I've been, being old foolish me
Mumble when I try to talk
Stumble when I try to walk
It's like I'm in a state of shock when I'm with you
Here I go again, looking just like a clown
Everything I say is wrong whenever you're around
Somehow I got kind a shy
I can't look you in the eye
I come all apart inside when I'm with you
Think I'm in love again
Grinning that silly grin
Look what a fool I've been, think I'm in love again
Lately I've lost my mind and I do it everytime
Yes, I know all the signs, think I'm in love
I won't lie to you, I've been in love before
And I think that you're the one that I've been waiting for
I've been around I'll admit
But this time all the pieces fit
Something tells me this is it, when I'm with you
Think I'm in love again
Grinning that silly grin
Look what a fool I've been, I think I'm in love again
Lately I've lost my mind and I do it everytime
Yes, I know all the signs, I think I'm in love
