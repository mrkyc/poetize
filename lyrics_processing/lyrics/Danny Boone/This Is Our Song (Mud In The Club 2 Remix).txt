Cypress Spring in the buildin'
Danny, Tommy Chayne, T-Wood, what's good?

I'm from that Nub City, 850 in the buildin'
Panhandle's finest, when I spit it, you feel it
It's that backwoods, knuckle up, cowboy up shit
No time for games, if you talkin', you get hit
Got one red light, Circle H and a stop sign
Boy, we from the dirty, more country than pork rinds
So drop on by, I'll show you a good time
Hang a right at the county line and pass me the moonshine
I'm just tryna put on for my hometown
A group of country folks comin' loud from the underground
Let me grab the mic and this is how I get down
Haters said I wouldn't make it, take a look at me now
Back then they said my music wouldn't make it a week
Now when they see me out in public, takin' pictures with me
So I'ma do this for my people that believe when I speak
Leave the others washed away like the banks on a creek, and

This is our song, everybody sing it
Clap your hands, y'all, and do it like you mean it
We stand our ground and we don't back down
If you're from a small town and you're never gonna leave it
This is our song, everybody sing it
Clap your hands, y'all, and do it like you mean it
We stand our ground and we don't back down
And if you don't like it then don't come around

Tommy Chayne (Yeah), welcome to 'Bama
Where we roll deep and we hit like hammers (Yeah)
As far as country goes, yeah, we settin' the standard (What?)
On that homegrown, lit like a lantern (Haa)
Like to unwind on some homemade wine (Wine)
One-ninety proof, that apple pie moonshine (Moonshine)
Yeah, we good people, but don't cross the line
Disrespect mine, realign your jawline
Ain't got much, what I got is mine
Naw, we ain't rich, but we do just fine (Yeah)
Wanna drop by, just shoot me a line
Like grandma said, come back any time, Chayne

This is our song to ride to (Our song)
Work week's long, we fight through (Gotta go)
This is for them hardhats and steel toes (Steel toes)
The ones way back in Wilco (Amen), as hard as they can (As they can)
Always puttin' family first with a bible in their hand (In their hand)
Yeah, this is for the Walkers and Blueticks (Blueticks)
Always stalkin' through the slough sticks (Slough sticks)
Chasin' whitetails through them ridin' trails
Around huntin' clubs with them rifle shells (Rifle shells)
Explodin' from the man standin' on the dome box (Box)
Holdin' a thirty-aught-six as they jaws drop (Woo)
Feelin' like you live a block away (Away)
From Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday (Doc Holliday), we'll always stay
In the land handed down from the ones above (Yeah)
Where shakin' hands and a nod as word is still enough (Still enough)
With good friends, great food cooked with grandma's love (Aw, yeah)

Turn it up a notch, don't believe us? Just watch (Come on)
