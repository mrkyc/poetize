It's getting better everyday
I think I may have accidentally found my way
Throw my cares away
I might as well be a-OK
It all happens for a reason so they say
I won't stand in the way

None of us have control
Maybe it's time we all let go
And no one said it would be easy
Wishing that it could be
But it's not for us to understand
And lately when the pressure starts to break me
I don't fight or run for safety
I just smile throw up my hands
'Cause this is who I am

I've fought the fights I've walked alone
Licked my wounds and searched for truth away from home
Set out to prove you wrong
I've paid the cost to play the fool
Won and lost
I think I've broken all the rules
Dying seems so cool
You might also like
None of us have control
Maybe it's time we all let go
And no one said it would be easy
Wishing that it could be
But it's not for us to understand
And lately when the pressure starts to break me
I don't cry or run for safety
I just smile throw up my hands
'Cause this is who I am

Played the game and I guess it's just 'bout time that I made my stand dammit I've been everything but me for y'all
But not no mo the pretendings ending
No breaking bending
No faking blending
I've been fighting fending all the lies you got to be kidding me I know me better than anyone else I know
I swear
Gonna grow my hair or maybe cut it what if I don't what if I do whats it to you
I didn't stu stu stutter leave it or love it brother yeah yeah yeah

No one said it would be easy
Wishing that it could be
But it's not for us to understand
When the pressure starts to break me
I don't fight or run for safety
I just smile throw up my hands
