I'm flippin through a book of photos
I found my birth certificate
A treasure trove of polaroids
My sister she was probably six
In this one
Look at mom and dad
He was still in college
Bagging groceries full time
Spare time odd jobbin
Mom's basketball pic
State champ four times
And who's that goofy cub scout
We won't talk about mine
That's my granddad's flatnose Chevy van
He taught me how to work and cuss like a man
We were all being taught something we don't understand
Keep your eye on the ball
And what's the proper stance
And every day was sunny
Even when it rained
Hard to tell if it's funny
Or if it's sad how things changed
Look at that spiked mullet
Lines cut in the side
And that look on my face
Man, that's nothin but pride
And that's me
Atlanta Hawks number four
Slammin that Nerf on my bedroom floor
You might also like
And it goes on and on and on and on
I know I got the rest of my life
But that ain't long
As it used to be
My, my how time flies by
And it goes on and on and on and on
Next thing you know
You wonder where the years have gone
And trying to wish it back won't work
Who'd have thought a good memory
Could hurt so bad

Look at the kid in this picture
Wearing that Oxford and khakis
Them penny loafers with dimes in them
My thoughts driftin; back
I remember feeling invincible
The future was mine
Ready to take on the world
But those were simpler times
Never a straight "A" student
I didn't make great grades
Three sport athlete
I made a few great plays
I had this black Chevy Nova
Jacked up in the back
With a 350 sitting on some Cragar mags
I was a bad boy
Definitely not the baddest
But my confidence level
Was on rockstar status
Spring break at the lake
Better yet, Panama City
No reservations or money
Man, let's just go, come and get me
Now, where were you
When Spud Webb won the dunk contest?
I was on cloud 9
'Cause I was just a little guy
And I watched his 5'7 slam 10 feet, so fresh
And knew, I couldn't be denied
And it goes on and on and on and on
I know I got the rest of my life
But that ain't long
As it used to be
My, my how time flies by
And it goes on and on and on and on
Next thing you know
You wonder where the years have gone
And trying to wish it back won't work
Who'd have thought a good memory
Could hurt so bad

And I don't know what tomorrow holds
But I know I can't live in the past
And it's hard when all your childhood dreams
Are the same ones you still have
And it seems just like yesterday
In a blur it all went by
It's like I fell asleep at 16, and woke up 45

And it goes on and on and on and on
I know I got the rest of my life
But that ain't long
As it used to be
My, my how time flies by
And it goes on and on and on and on
Next thing you know
You wonder where the years have gone
And trying to wish it back won't work
Who'd have thought a good memory
Could hurt so bad
(Where were you, wh- wh- where were you)
(Where were you, wh- wh- where were you, you)
