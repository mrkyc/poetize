She got a body like ooh-woo and she moves like hell yeah
Drinkin' on a Bud Light lookin' like just my type in that camo bikini
She got a body like ooh-woo and she moves like hell yeah
Dancin' in the moonlight lookin' like just my type in that little camo bikini

How did I know that she was hot like lava
Got a volleyball body booty bangin' that's when I forgot
Where I was, I seen her from afar
Carrie Underwood demeanor, she was sippin' from a jar
I was sitting on a cooler by the creek with a beer in each hand Checkin' out that copper tone tan
She had a tramp stamp and a Georgia "G"
Tattooed on her ankle gorgeously
Eleven on the one to ten, made her friends look like fives
It didn't make any sense how
She was shakin' what her mama blessed her with
By the Lord she was gifted, yes sir
Wigglin' her hips to all summer long
She shotgunned a brew and said "Who got the beer bong?"
No she didn't, 'cause guess who does
I wouldn't mind my truck gettin' stuck in that mud

She got a body like ooh-woo and she moves like hell yeah
Drinkin' on a Bud Light lookin' like just my type in that camo bikini
She got a body like ooh-woo and she moves like hell yeah
Dancin' in the moonlight lookin' like just my type in that little camo bikini
You might also like
When I spotted her I was sloppy like good God almighty
That hottie, she's sippin' 'shine like she was Asian sippin' saki
If I get lucky she will straddle me like a Kawasaki
And I'll park my crotch, rock it all in her hot pocket
Ass was asinine, blessed with breasteses
Finessin' this princess into undressing's gonna take
Less aggressiveness and more kissin' and listenin'
Whatever it takes 'cause I just want to reach around
And play that g-string like a stand up bass
She drives a Silverado, drinks liquor out the bottle
Dirty south born and bred, country as cornbread
And if she talks to me I hit the lotto

She got a body like ooh-woo and she moves like hell yeah
Drinkin' on a Bud Light lookin' like just my type in that camo bikini
She got a body like ooh-woo and she moves like hell yeah
Dancin' in the moonlight lookin' like just my type in that little camo bikini

As the party started windin' down no girl was goin' strong
She told me she was ridin' out and I should come along
As we stepped into her double wide I closed and locked the door
And that camo bikini was layin' on the floor
She got a body like ooh-woo and she moves like hell yeah
Drinkin' on a Bud Light lookin' like just my type in that camo bikini
She got a body like ooh-woo and she moves like hell yeah
