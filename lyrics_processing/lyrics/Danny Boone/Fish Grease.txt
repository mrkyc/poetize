Gotta keep it knockin like a workboot in a dryer
Fish grease
That's just how hot we are, hot we are
How we gonna bury all the mason jars
Gotta keep it bumpin like an Alabama dirt road
Fish grease
That's just how hot we are, hot we are
How we gonna bury all the mason jars

Started at the bottom
Just a bunch of average Joes
From the country makin music
Tryin to be like our heroes
Took it to them rural areas
Those city folks don't go
Plantin seeds out in the sticks
And hope that they would one day grow
Bubba said it's gon get ugly
And I'll be damned, lo and behold
Brand new string of country twang
Homeboy, they call it southern soul

Gotta keep it knockin like a workboot in a dryer
Fish grease
That's just how hot we are, hot we are
How we gonna bury all the mason jars
Gotta keep it bumpin like an Alabama dirt road
Fish grease
That's just how hot we are, hot we are
How we gonna bury all the mason jars

Now we got everybody watchin
Took the show and hit the road
Got em comin out the woods
On ATVs and 4X4s
Drinkin whiskey, rebel yellin
Head to toe in mossy oak
Got them swampers rooster tailin
When they make it rain for sure
From the dirty where it's mucky
To up north to where it snows
Baby, I want to get muddy from the east to the west coast

Gotta keep it knockin like a workboot in a dryer
Fish grease
That's just how hot we are, hot we are
How we gonna bury all the mason jars
Gotta keep it bumpin like an Alabama dirt road
Fish grease
That's just how hot we are, hot we are
How we gonna bury all the mason jars

Look at how the industry takin notice
Well, it ain't gonna work is what they told us
Wall Street Journal sniffin around
They wanna know about the mud
The jacked up drugs The camo, the ammo, artillery
And all about the backwoods distilleries
Man, we killin it
Hip hop drums with a little Nashville in it
Now who's dumb
Gotta keep it knockin like a workboot in a dryer
Fish grease
That's just how hot we are, hot we are
How we gonna bury all the mason jars
Gotta keep it bumpin like an Alabama dirt road
Fish grease
That's just how hot we are, hot we are
