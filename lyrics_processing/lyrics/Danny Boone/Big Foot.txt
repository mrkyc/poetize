I'm stompin' like a sasquatch (I'm big foot, I'm big foot)
I'm goin' through the trees (I'm big foot, I'm big foot)
I'm climbin' up the hillside (I'm big foot, big foot)
When you see me take a picture (Yell big foot)
I'm stompin' like a sasquatch (I'm big foot, I'm big foot)
I'm goin' through the trees (I'm big foot, I'm big foot)
I'm climbin' up the hillside (I'm big foot, big foot)
When you see me take a picture (Yell big foot)

Yeah I'm all terrain built like a tank
Way out in the boonies let them Kenwood's bang
Far from civilization, far from civilized
Just a country boy coolin' I'm way up high
Damn near three feet from the top of the tires to the wheel well
I'm a monster livin' XL
Rompin', stompin, howlin' and growlin'
Bouncin' around while I'm creepin' and crawlin'

I'm stompin' like a sasquatch (I'm big foot, I'm big foot)
I'm goin' through the trees (I'm big foot, I'm big foot)
I'm climbin' up the hillside (I'm big foot, big foot)
When you see me take a picture (Yell big foot)
I'm stompin' like a sasquatch (I'm big foot, I'm big foot)
I'm goin' through the trees (I'm big foot, I'm big foot)
I'm climbin' up the hillside (I'm big foot, big foot)

Splashin' through the river crushin' two ton boulders
Stump jumpin' Colt Ford bumpin' from the dash board
Hundred foot shadow when that big beast roll up
Colossus preposterous big wheels swole up
Bazooka in the window, can't scrape the paint
It got thick skin Line-X the whole thing
Got enough KC's to light up a stadium
Bass so heavy that it'll make you think you numb
Climb Mount Everest stomp through the swamp
Play Dixie on the horn if I feel the need to honk it
It's a redneck dream, guzzlin' gasoline
I rumble through the jungle that legend they never seen

I'm stompin' like a sasquatch (I'm big foot, I'm big foot)
I'm goin' through the trees (I'm big foot, I'm big foot)
I'm climbin' up the hillside (I'm big foot, big foot)

You can catch me ridin' dirty smelly mud slapped covered
With some big foot feet, 54 inches of rubber
I'm a monster, yeah this big block roars
See me tearin' through the woods just like a wild boar
The way I roll I smash one I smash all
Yeah I guess you can go ahead and call me a wreckin' ball
Got mud grips spinnin', and they chewin' and they bitin'
If they was in a ring you could call 'em Mike Tyson
Climbin' from the bottom and I'm headin' to the top
Expert hill climber and I'm creepin' over rocks
Hate on me go ahead I feel honored
If you want you can go and take a picture so it lasts longer
I'm stompin' like a sasquatch (I'm big foot, I'm big foot)
I'm goin' through the trees (I'm big foot, I'm big foot)
I'm climbin' up the hillside (I'm big foot, big foot)
