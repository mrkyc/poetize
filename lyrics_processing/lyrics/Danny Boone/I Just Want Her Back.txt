4:25 AM, and I'm drunk again
Ain't no high gonna cure this low
I came home from the road
And I walked in
To a big empty house with a little note
All it said was bye, with a smiley face
So here I am, sittin all alone

I know I'm hard to love
Been pourin' booze
On my heartache
Where did she go?

I just want her back, I just want her here
My heart is on the floor, stuck in a blank stare
I know that I was wrong
But I just want her home
I'm sendin' up a prayer
Is anybody there?

All this reality hurts
I know it's my fault
If I'd have been here
Then she wouldn't be gone
I got no excuses
Been chasin' that dream
I guess it wasn't her who decided to leave
What the hell was I thinkin'
Dear lord up in heaven
Please come and take away this pain
You might also like
I know I'm hard to love
Been pourin' booze
On my heartache
Where did she go?

I just want her back, I just want her here
My heart is on the floor, stuck in a blank stare
I know that I was wrong
But I just want her home
I'm sendin' up a prayer
Is anybody there?

And the rain on the roof
Sounds like applause
But the beer cans are piling up again
I been smokin' just like Willie, been
Pretendin' I'm Billy The Kid
So long, it got hard to tell right from wrong
Feels like the lord won't take my calls

I just want her back, I just want her here
My heart is on the floor, stuck in a blank stare
I know that I was wrong
But I just want her home
I'm sendin up a prayer
