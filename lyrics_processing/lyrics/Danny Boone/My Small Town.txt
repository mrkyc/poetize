This four lane road I'm drivin' on used to be made of dirt
And right over there where the Walgreen's stands used to be a church
Well I was born in this hick town, raised on sunshine
Didn't take much to have us a good time
Still get up and go to work
And a catfish was all you could get on line
And all the neighbors waved when you drove by
Even though they lived a mile away

And it's a song for the family
Sittin' 'round the table, a hymn of amazing grace
And it's a song for the soldier that just got home
From doing whatever it takes
And the sun still shines and the wind still blows
The stars and stripes on the top of that pole
This is for my small town, even though
My small town ain't that small no more

And there's a bonfire burnin' in the middle of a field
By the big red barn that my granddad built
But those were much simpler times
And though memories fade mine still exist
Like the old oak tree where I stole my first kiss
Way back on that star filled summer night
You might also like
And it's a song for the family
Sittin' 'round the table, a hymn of amazing grace
And it's a song for the soldier that just got home
From doing whatever it takes
And the sun still shines
And the wind still blows
The stars and stripes on the top of that pole
This is for my small town, even though
My small town ain't that small no more

And it was church on Sunday
Work through Friday
'Round here everybody knew everybody
Before progress came to town
And now you can't let your kids
Out the house without an iPhone
Back to the future
Damn, where's the time gone?
All we ever really had is now

And it's a song for the family
Sittin' 'round the table, a hymn of amazing grace
And it's a song for the soldier that just got home
From doing whatever it takes
And the sun still shines
And the wind still blows
The stars and stripes on the top of that pole
This is for my small town, even though
