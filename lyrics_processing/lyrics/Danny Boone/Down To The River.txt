Baby, let's get away
I'm so tired of my job
We can leave the kids
We can let them stay with your mom
I'll load up the car
And you can pack some clothes
We'll leave it all behind
Baby who knows

Couple of bottles of booze
And we'll go down to the river
We'll pitch a tent
Smoke until we spin
Then we'll make love
Until the sun comes up
Sleep 'til dark
And do it all over again
And over again

We can sit by the fire
And laugh for a little while
And try to remember
How we used to smile
I got a lantern
And I got a coleman stove
And I sure need a break, girl
Ain't you ready to go
You might also like
Couple of bottles of booze
And we'll go down to the river
We'll pitch a tent
Smoke until we spin
Then we'll make love
Until the sun comes up
Sleep 'til dark
And do it all over again
And over again

Hang the bug zapper
From a limb and
When the stars come out
We can take a swim
Get a can of off
And a seeping bag
Play a little Willie
And take a drag
And live like we ain't gotta go home
Count the fireflies
And sing a few songs
Catch up on time that slipped away
Come over, what do you say
Couple of bottles of booze
And we'll go down to the river
We'll pitch a tent
Smoke until we spin
Then we'll make love
Until the sun comes up
Sleep 'til dark
And do it all over again
Couple of bottles of booze
And we'll go down to the river
We'll pitch a tent
Smoke until we spin
Then we'll make love
Until the sun comes up
Sleep 'til dark
And do it all over again
Couple of bottles of booze
And we'll go down to the river
We'll pitch a tent
Smoke until we spin
Then we'll make love
Until the sun comes up
Sleep 'til dark
And do it all over again
