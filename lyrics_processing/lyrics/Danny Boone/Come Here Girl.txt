Her jeans are real tight
Her camel toe just right
Blouse with no bra, her headlights are on bright
She powders her nose, if you know what I mean
Got super side heels and a rack that clean

Come here girl, I kinda like what I see
I can tell from here you're just as trashy as me
We can stay up all night and see how much we can drink
Or we can pass out on each other, on top of the covers

She wears titty perfume
Got a scar above her eye
Too much makeup and I can tell she likes a fight
She's doing shots of Jager
She's chain smokin' at the bar
Her daddy's in jail and she likes muscle cars

Come here girl, I kinda like what I see
I can tell from here you're just as trashy as me
We can stay up all night and see how much we can drink
Or we can pass out on each other, on top of the covers
You might also like
She's dancin' on the table
She's fallin' on the floor (she's fallin' on the floor)
She's throwin' beer at the bouncer
He's draggin' her ass out the door
She wants more

Come here girl, I kinda like what I see
I can tell from here you're just as trashy as me
We can stay up all night and see how much we can drink
Or we can pass out on each other, baby
Come here girl, I kinda like what I see
I can tell from here you're just as trashy as me
We can stay up all night and see how much we can drink
Or we can pass out on each other, honey child
Come here girl, I kinda like what I see
I can tell from here you're just as trashy as me
We can stay up all night and see how much we can drink
