Play that, that, that trailer park song, man about the car, man

I've written songs about love, songs about war
Beat up cars and old screen doors
Youth and truth, lies and money
Some of them are sad and others are funny
And I've sang about sunshine, sang about rain
Lookin out the window of a big jet plane
Songs about home and this road I'm on
And songs just to find the strength to carry on

I reckon I've written about a million songs so far
Dirty clubs and motel rooms
Trying to be a big rockstar

But all they wanna hear is Sittin' At A Bar
You know, that bartender song
The one about crashing that car
So I sing it every night but I save it for last
And everybody sings along
Might even sign me an autograph
You might also like
Well I've strained my brain and tried to search
For great ideas, it just won't work
Complex metaphors, double entendres
Tryna to be more than a one hit wonder
Scheming on a rhyme scheme, racking my melon
How long I've been doing this, ain't no tellin'
Working like the devil to be avant garde
Well, hell, maybe I just tried too hard

I reckon I've written about a million songs so far
Dirty clubs and motel rooms
Trying to be a big rockstar

But all they wanna hear is Sittin' At A Bar
You know, that bartender song
The one about crashing that car
So I sing it every night but I save it for last
And everybody sings along
Might even sign me an autograph

And I'm not complaining, not at all, I'm just sayin'
If I could find a way
To write a million more like that one
Then maybe that drunk guy with all his sloppy friends
You can find at all our shows
Wouldn't be yellin' "Play that trailer park song"
We're just two songs in, but who knows
All they wanna hear is Sittin' At A Bar
You know, that bartender song
The one about crashing that car
So I sing it every night but I save it for last
And everybody sings along
