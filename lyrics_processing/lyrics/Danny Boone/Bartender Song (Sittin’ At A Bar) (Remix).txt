Bartender I really did it this time
Broke my parole to have a good time
When I got home it was 6 am
The door was locked so I kicked it in
She was trippin' on the bills
I think she was high on some pills
She threw my shit out into the yard
Then she called me a bum and slapped me real hard
And in my drunken stupor I did what I should of never done
Now I'm sittin' here talkin' to you drunk and on the run

I'm sittin' at a bar on the inside
Waitin' on my ride on the outside
She stole my heart in the trailer park
So I jacked the keys to her fuckin' car
And crashed that piece of shit and then stepped away
Stepped away, I stepped away

You know Moe, I'll probably get ten years
So just give me beers 'til they get here
Yeah I know the sun is comin' up
And y'all are probably gettin' ready for closin' up
But I'm tryin' to drown my soul
I'm tired of this life on a dirt road
And everything that I love is gone
And I'm tired of hangin' on
You might also like
She got me sittin' at a bar on the inside
Waitin' on my ride on the outside
She stole my heart in the trailer park
So I jacked the keys to her fuckin' car
And crashed that piece of shit and then stepped away

Guess it was meant to be romance is misery
So much for memories and now I'm headed to the penitentiary
See me on TV the next Cops series I am a danger
I guess I should've did something about my anger
But I'll never learn real things I don't concern
I pour kerosene on everything I love, and watch it burn
I know it's my fault but I wasn't happy it was over
She through a fit so I crashed that piece a shit Nova

And now I'm goin' back again
Back to the pen to see my friends
And when we all pile out that county van
They'll ask me where I've been

I've been at a bar on the inside
Waitin' on my ride on the outside
She stole my heart in the trailer park
So I jacked the keys to her fuckin' car
And crashed that piece of shit and then stepped away
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
Well I'm sittin' at a bar on the inside
Waitin' on my ride on the outside
You know I crashed that bitches car then I stepped away
Yeah, yeah, I stepped away
