You can take my cold beer
You can take my pack of smokes
I don't need no lovin'
I just want a Jack and Coke
You can take my keys
But don't take my whiskey from me

I don't care for business deals
Or priceless shiny things
Just give me a dirty broad
And a bottle of Jim Beam
I don't mind playin' a fool
I guess I'm too far gone
But if you please don't bother me
Just leave me alone
You can take it all, take anything
But don't take the whiskey from me

I ain't trying to fall in love
That woman broke my heart
Left with both my babies
I just want a Maker's Mark
Yeah, I might get mean
If you take my whiskey from me
You might also like
I ain't much a gamblin' man
My poker face is weak
I'll see you young Kentucky
And raise you a glass of Tennessee
You can make it easy
Or you can make it hard
But you best make it a double and sit it right there on the bar
You can take it all, take anything
But don't take my whiskey from me

Down down down down
Down down down down
Down down down down
Down down down down
Down down down down
Down down down down

And I don't wanna talk no more
I don't wanna hear you speak
Hard times and bad luck
Done got the best of me
Can't you see I'm weak
But don't take my whiskey from me
You can kick me out the bar
But I'll stop by the store
And buy another 90 proof
Damnit, I need some more
Forget about that Seagram's Gin
And Bailey's Irish Cream
And I don't care how grey that goose is
'Cause it ain't brown enough for me
Forget about it all take everything
But don't take the whiskey from me

You can take it all take everything
But don't take the whiskey from me
You can take it all take everything
