Yeah
Uh

Chillin' in the backwoods kickin' up my boots
With a pistol I can shoot and a Winchester too (yup)
Call a couple girls we can shoot and get loose
Maybe hop up in the truck crank it up here's the rules (yeah)
Every time you see a critter walk across the street
Hit the roof yell shoot if you miss it than you drink (drink)
One shot two shots two shots three
Could it be that the weed got me floatin' like a leaf (like a leaf)
Rebel yell can I get a yee yee
Plant the seed to the land bail the hay country
Backwoods raised from my days as a young buck
I been on the grind out here it ain't no luck

Point that Winchester to the sky and boom boom
It's great to be alive in the U.S.A. way out in the boonies
Howlin' at the moon way out in the boonies
Point that Winchester to the sky and boom boom

All of my friends are sinners I don't know any saints
Lot of my homies when they smile they look like fill in the blanks
We eatin' cornbread collard greens fish and grits
Driveway made of gravel mailbox ain't brick
And we can tell if you're tryna be slick
So don't try just hope we more golden rule than we are
Eye for an eye and I'm a Levi guy
Not the chew but the jeans
Down at Warren Roberts Georgia boy had a dream
To keep the bar on smash and keep the porch on tilt
A 55 gallon drum with the steaks gettin' grilled
A rusty Chevy on blocks a rototiller in the weeds
Daddy breakin' his back so mama gets what she needs
We quick to jack up a jeep and put that thing on stilts
It's all good in the woods yeah we're country for real
We an Los Angeles or NYC
We in the middle of a field drinkin' whiskey in the breeze
