I think you'll recognize that every word is true
It's the story that I tell about my brother
The brother that I loved but hardly knew
We were forced to live so far from one another
But it was more than distance keeping him from me
While I had the right to lead the life I'd chosen
All he yearned for was the day that he'd be free
CHORUS
How I dreamed that one day we could be together
Doing all the things that brothers do
But I feared that I would have to dream forever
For only dreamers still believe that dreams come true
I fought with all my strength to gain his freedom
And I challenged those who dared keep us apart
I pleaded for compassion, "he's my brother,"
But there's no mercy when the soul is cold and dark
The years and decades followed one another
And I worriedd what they must have done to him
Though the flame that made us brothers was still burning
I knew that tiny spark was growing dim

How I dreamed that one day we could be together
Doing all the things that brothers do
But I feared that I would have to dream forever
For only dreamers still believe that dreams come true
But He who rules the world heard our prayers
How I wept the day they set my brother free
And I wondered, would he find faith with his freedom
In my heart I knew that it was up to me
Oh I realized the first time that I embraced him
He's a stranger who feels awkward and alone
But I have just what it takes to make him welcome
A brother's love to make him feel at home
CHORUS
How I dreamed that one day we could be together
Doing all the things that brothers do
But I feared that I would have to dream forever
For only dreamers still believe that dreams come true
How I dreamed that one day we could be together
Doing things that brothers do
Now that day has come and it will last forever
For I know and I believe, yes I know and I believe
