That only seeks to live in peace
To spread my seeds upon the earth
And firm my roots within the soil
Of the land my father gave to me
And his father gave to him
Made by the Father of us all
But the woodsman
With an ax poised in his hand
Said it's my sacred duty
To clear away this land
And on this place that I call home
I will plant a field of stone
I am but a little tree
That only seeks to live in peace
To spread my seeds upon the earth
And firm my roots within the soil
Of the land my father gave to me
And his father gave to him
Made by the Father of us all
While the sly fox
Aloof, cool and remote
Said I cannot be distracted
By the bloodstains on my coat
I can feel the woodsman pain
Perhaps the tree should not remain
You might also likeI am but a little tree
That only seeks to live in peace
To spread my seeds upon the earth
And firm my roots within the soil
Of the land my father gave to me
And his father gave to him
Made by the Father of us all
And the eagle
High above so far away
Said it's in my best interest
To see the small tree stay
No it need not thrive like I
But why not let it stay alive
Though storm and wind may come
I'll bend but never break
And like all those before me
I'll stay true to my faith
That soon will come a day
When all will gather 'neath my shade
I am but a little tree
That only seeks to live in peace
To spread my seeds upon the earth
And firm my roots within the soil
Of the land my father gave to me
And his father gave to him
