Let me hold you in my hand,
And we'll fly away you and I together,
To a place down on the land
Come with me little Neshamala,
Don't shy away, do as you're told
There's a little child, waiting to be born today
You're to be his spark, his soul.
But dear malachel no, I don't want to go,
There is so much pain and evil, upon the earth below,
Let me stay here up in heaven, were it's safe and I'll be pure,
Please don't make me go away, can't you see I'm so afraid.
Come with me little Neshamela,
Its time you faced, your destiny,
As we fly beneath the clouds now, I will show you,
There is so much you can be.
Yes dear malachel I can see kedush over there
Look someone's learning Torah, there's another deep in prayer
I will stay here if you answer me, it's all I need to know
You must promise me dear friend, that I too will be like them.
Come with me, little Neshamela
Oh it's a task that I must do
As I tap you on the lip you will forget me
You're on your own, its up to you.
Come with me, little Neshamela
And let me hold you in my hand
And we'll fly away you and I together
To a place above the land.
But dear malachel no, I don't want to go,
I'm not ready to go with you, where you'll take me I don't know
Let me stay right where I am, there's so much more I need to do
Please don't make me go away, can't you see I'm so afraid.
Come with me, little Neshamela,
I've only come to take you home,
And there is no need to fear your destination,
