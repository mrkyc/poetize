You want to find yourself
But you don't want to do that with me
You want to drive
You want to feel the breeze
Between your fingers and the trees
And you don't know where you're going
You get in the car and you hit the road
And though I still love you
I want you to know
I hope you hit traffic
The magic gets lost and the wind sits still
I hope it's a static erratic drive
And you're slamming on the wheel
You get angry and graphic
And I hope you hit traffic
You want to fly
You want to spread your wings
And you got a hundred more cliches
You think the road holds the truth
And no ones gunna get in your way
And you don't care where you're going
You let the car decide when you hit the road
You might also likeThough I still love you
I want you to know
I hope you hit traffic
The magic gets lost and the wind sits still
I hope it's a static erratic drive
And you're slamming on the wheel
You get angry and graphic
And I hope you hit traffic
You turn the radio up loud
But no station is clear
Then a crackle from a cloud
And the rain is soon here
Could the car break down?
Could it be a sign?
I wish you would, I really think you should
But if you can't be mine
I hope you hit traffic
The magic is lost and the wind sits still
And I hope it's a static erratic drive
And you're slamming on the wheel
I hope you hit traffic
The magic is lost and the wind sits still
And I hope it's a static erratic drive
And you're slamming on the wheel
You get angry and graphic
