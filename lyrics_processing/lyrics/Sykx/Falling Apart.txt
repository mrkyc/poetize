It feels like we've been going round in circles lately
Everyday, why you always seem to drive me crazy
Do you be lying to me? Why can't you be straight?
I thought we had love, now everything just seems fake
You always check my phone when I leave it my a room
But when I catch you looking through it you always give me some mood
Don't call me a liar, that will cause me to switch
Don't call me a dickhead, I won't call you a bitch
Why the gal tryna over step their mark?
They call us boys players but then fuck with our hearts
I would have given you the world, the planets and the stars
You were my shining light but you left me in the dark
They say honesty's a policy so that's what I'm sticking by
You ain't bothered with me so I ain't gonna try
Bet you wanted me to break down to see me cry
Well I'm just happy that you're no longer in my life

You can try to understand
It's so easy in the end

You're everything, I follow you
You're everything, we'll make it through
You're anything and everything falling apart
You're everything, I follow you
You're everything, we'll make it through
You're anything and everything, falling apart
You're everything

See we started off so nice
Everything was so perfect
Relationships weren't me but I was slowly learning
But then I realised
You must be dead inside
You said you couldn't trust me
But you're the one belling guys
When I text you, you were so numb with me
But when I'm with you, you're on your phone constantly
So who you belling then?
You ain't making sense
Thought you was heaven sent
You're messing with my head again
So I ain't shedding tears or hurting inside
Yeah you broke my heart, longer girl you don't realise
Like, girl what did I do to you? I wanna know why
Actually, no I don't just say your goodbyes
So go pack your bags and don't call me again
The only feelings I have for you now are regret
Delete my number off your phone
I don't wanna be your friend
I don't care for your excuses I ain't seeing you again
Just go

You can try to understand
It's so easy in the end

You're everything, I follow you
You're everything, we'll make it through
You're anything and everything falling apart
You're everything, I follow you
You're everything, we'll make it through
You're anything and everything, falling apart
