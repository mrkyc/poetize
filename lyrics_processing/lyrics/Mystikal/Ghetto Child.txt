It's crazy out here (uhh)
Yo, mama, I'm tryna keep my head strong (whats up Mystikal?)
Uhh! (uhh) I'm just a ghetto child tryna make it
Uhh! I'm just a ghetto child tryna make it
Uhh! This ghetto got me crazy
Mama, won't you pray for your baby?
Uhh! I'm just a ghetto child tryna make it
Mama, I'm just a ghetto child tryna make it

I feel like a bird nigga with no wings
I'm stuck in this ghetto tryna have a little change
My homies killin' up each other 'cause we gotta eat
And I ain't trippin' 'cause I'm runnin' from the police
I done seen little kids in the projects starvin'
I done seen more hoes messin' than Marvin
See in the ghetto, the sun it barely shines
But so many niggas in jail and the welfare lines
And all my life I thought Bill Clinton ran the country
'Til I found out Bill Gates had all the money
And the media startin' east and west coast wars
I'm from the south, where they prejudice on us all
Commodity powdered milk and eggs don't fill us up
But why the government sold us drugs and charges to clean us up
Gave us three halves and high interest student loans
Four dollar minimum wage and section eight, we call it home

It's real when you can do whatever you want to do
When you want to do it
Ain't to many niggas out there livin' like that
That's why the rest of y'all niggas ain't never gone through it
How many niggas in the penn
How many niggas in the cemetery don't know why?
How many strikes y'all niggas need
How many innocent children in the ghetto gotta lose they lives?
WHY? Why you gotta make your mama cry?
HUH? She tell you stay off of the street 'cause that's where you gon' die
But you don't listen 'cause your mind is one track and your head is hard
And your gettin' flipped, and your talkin' back
Showin' your ass, actin' straight up off the wall
Lemme talk to y'all, don't think it's too hard to fall, but that's far and all
I done saw it all, and it was cool when it started off
Now the nigga's duckin' bullets like dodge-balls
Niggas got me scared to plant my seed
Fear of how it's gon' grow
Livin' in a messed up world, in a messed up time
I'm tellin' ya, you can't do shit no more
It's bigger than us, it's out of our hands
That's why I'm prayin' to God
Oh, Heavenly Father
Keep my head above the water
It's your world, but we your children
Your sons and your daughters
We strugglin', tryna get out the ghetto
They constantly tryna make it to mars
Uhh! This ghetto got me crazy
Mama, won't you pray for your baby?
Uhh! I'm just a ghetto child tryna make it
Mama, I'm just a ghetto child tryna make it
Uhh! This ghetto got me crazy
Mama, won't you pray for your baby?
Uhh! I'm just a ghetto child tryna make it
Mama, I'm just a ghetto child tryna make it

Dear mama pray for your son
Hopin' I can make it through this game
Wishin' I can change, I've been through so much
Seen so many things, couldn't find the words to explain
Only way to avoid stress is to get high, by drinkin' Hennessy
But I can't get too high, 'cause I keep my eyes on my enemies
I've seen harder times, but there gonna be some harder days
Penitentiary close, but you know what? Cemeteries ain't that far away
Before I die I'm tryna make the whole world feel
Like our people scared to stand here
The way we express ourself, they think that we all some killers
Now look through the eyes of this ghetto child influenced by the street
Go to sleep to gunshots, wake up from sirens from the police
See now my life ain't been the same nigga
Life as a thug
If I had to draw a picture of my life
I have to paint my picture in blood
Closest homie died
Before he died little cousin told me this
Get you somethin' 'cause cemeteries
Packed full of niggas who had dreams to be rich
So keep your head up, to all my ghetto children
It was hard to tell my family one day I was gonna grow up to make millions
When I told them, they seemed to laugh at my so called dream
I liked to scream when I came home from jail
Told: my best friend turned into a fiend
I ain't gonna lie, my conscience ain't clear
When I close my eyes
But you gotta realize, God forgive me
I'm just out here, tryna survive
They cut welfare and health care
That shit gotta stop
I got a positive note, my auntie havin' a baby
Congratulations, she on rocks
Uhh! This ghetto got me crazy
Mama, won't you pray for your baby?
Uhh! I'm just a ghetto child tryna make it
Mama, I'm just a ghetto child tryna make it
Uhh! This ghetto got me crazy
Mama, won't you pray for your baby?
Uhh! I'm just a ghetto child tryna make it
