Since I'm so fucking bad
Give me mine
Get yours
Ooooh...

I woke up this morning
Rocked up
Humping on the matress
Hard like I was fuckin
I realized I was dreaming
Then I got up
I hit the Vick's inhaler
'cuz my nose was stuffed up
From the bed to the floor
To the bathroom to the sink
From the mirror to the toilet
Took a piss then shook the shank
Oops, dont look know I think I sprinkled when I tinkled
So, I did what the sign said, "be a sweetie, wipe the seatie"
Cocoa powder, bubble-bath, and rubbing alcohol
For 5 fuckin cent that you could buy at the mall
I'm a long distance super-power, pussy-magnet
I was born in the ghetto, made by the ghetto
So fabulous!

Ghetto fabulous - living like this
I'm so happy, yeah!
'cuz I'm ghetto fabulous (repeat)

Yeah I feel what you're saying, Dog
But, uhh, you could let these fools know how hard it is
When a nigga ghetto fabulous, know what I'm saying?
Let's kick that shit!

It's like a big rush with no time
Niggas be like "whyyyyy"
Kids be like "let me get your autograph"
Bitches be like "ahhhh!"
Ever since I said "here I go"
Braids or not y'all
They know me wherever I go
I'm real private
The windows tinted, doors locked
They'll crowd you, make a scene
"Ain't you Mystikal?"
"No, I'm not."
Lie to a die hard fan with a straight face
And let the hour long picture signing session take place
Sign, hey, baby, how you doing?
What's your name?
Stay real, stay sweet
Stay sexy, stay the same
And never forget
I'm never going to change
I'm loving what I'm doing
And you can put that on your game
I got my piece of pie and my piece of mind
Fool, I'm a piece of coal
Don't crowd me, people, let me shine
I know you see me on t.v
With Snoop, Fiend, Mia, C, Silkk, Serv, and Petey
Nigga we run these street-ies
But livin' like this ain't easy
It's fabulous!
I'm so fucking bad

See, that's a cutie with her big booty
And her big body
Her and her big fine posse
Take their ??? and take their vitamins
Be ordering drinks all down at the bar
We don't got to buy
Just work that halter top
And work them tight bell bottoms
Ohhh, you acting funny and trying to holla
She project Tyra Banks
The neighborhood super-model
She shaped like a coke bottle
Hair whipping smelling good
Finger nails and her toes polished
She get it how she live
Cause she got to have it
First drop them fucking kids by they baby's daddy
Her ass ain't never what she should have been
Go ahead on and act bad, I'll see ya when I get a hit
See, she was so fucking bad
