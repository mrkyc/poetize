I bet you're feeling the same
I guess we know what's really goin' on
Can we do it with our clothes on?
I'm not the kind to show and tell
Everyone knows the word S-E-X too well
I'm here to tell you that it ain't no sin
So it's okay to let me see that grin
Smile if you like sex
Smile if you like sex
Smile if you like sex
Smile if you like sex
Ooh, baby, baby, there's no need to be shy
It's okay to have that look in your eye
Every now and then, once in a while
You and I both know you can make me smile
I'm not the kind to show and tell
When it comes to the three little letters we know too well (Sex)
I'm gonna tell you that it ain't no sin
Just open up and let me see your grin
Smile if you like sex
(All I wanna do is get next to you)
Smile if you like sex
Smile if you like sex
(I wanna see you)
Smile if you like sex
