Ooh, yeah
Tender love again
(Tender love, tender love)
Hey, there, where are you going?
I won't let you pass me by without knowing
Right now I'm hypnotized, just a little mesmerized
And it's you, you're the reason why
I spend my time thinkin' of the things we can do
(I wanna share my lovin')
I spend my time thinkin' of the ways I love you
And with a little bit of T.L.C. coming from me
Everything's gonna be all right
Why don't you spend the night?
A little T.L.C. coming from me
Everything's gonna be all right
Why don't you spend the night if you please
Ooh, baby
Hey, sugar, gotta have a little faith in me
I won't ever let you down, have the strength to believe
Baby, I want you to know that I'll always love you so
And it's you (you, baby), you're the reason why (I love you)
