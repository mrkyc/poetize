She slid across the front seat and said, "Come on baby let's go"
She rolled down the windows and cranked up the radio
She said, "When I'm with you honey I feel defenseless"
Oh and that kinda talk can drive a man senseless
I'm just doin' my best to keep my heart steady
I think I'm in love and I like it already
With one hand on the wheel and the other one losin' control
I was tickin' like a time bomb tryin' to keep the car on the road
Yeah she had my mind in such a sweet commotion
I was gettin' all kinds of serious notions
I'm just doin' my best keep my heart steady
I think I'm in love and I like it already
Yeah I like it already (I like it already)
Oh I like it a lot (I like it a lot)
I like it already (I like it already)
Oh and I don't want it to stop
Oh something real good is happenin' to me
And I'm beginnin' to see the possibilities
Hey from here on out the sky's the limit
She's got me holdin' on from minute to minute
I'm just doin' my best to keep my heart steady
I think I'm in love and I like it already
