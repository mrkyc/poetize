Check the ol buddy filler' up with ethyl
'Cause I got a long drive in sight
My baby just left me for a pool shootin' fella
And I'm gonna bring her back tonight
Aw he don't really need her and I know he's gonna feed her full
Of promises he can't keep
But I'm the one to blame
'Cause I been drivin' her insane
By staying out six nights a week
So buddy check the tires I'll leave the engine runnin'
'Cause I can't waste no more time
I got sixty-three miles of two lane before I even
Cross that Tennessee line
I know my baby needs me and I hope that when she sees me
That she's gonna wanna come back home
I let her slip away and that's the price you gotta pay
But I ain't leavin' there alone
I'm bringin' her back
Bringin' my baby back home
Bringin' her back
Bringin' my baby back home
So buddy take a ten don't worry 'bout the windows
I can see enough to get me by
You might also likeForget about the change I don't need the money
She's the only thing on my mind
Aw heads will be a spinnin' when I cross the city limits)
Cause she's been away from me too long
So when the sherriff's askin' if you've seen my car a passin'
You can tell him just where I've gone
I'm bringin' her back
Bringin' my baby back home
Bringin' her back
Bringin' my baby back home
I know my baby needs me and I hope that when she sees me
That she's gonna wanna come back home
I let her slip away and that's the price you gotta pay
But I ain't leavin' there alone
I'm bringin' her back
Bringin' my baby back home
Bringin' her back
Bringin' my baby back home
I'm bringin' her back
Bringin' my baby back home
Bringin' her back
