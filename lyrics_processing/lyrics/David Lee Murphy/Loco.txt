All we need's a little salt & lime
We can plug in the hot pepper lights and pretend
That we're livin' on Key West time
I can run to the store and get some charcoal
Buy a tiki torch and fire up the grill
The whole town wants to know when I'm gonna grow up
But you know I never will
Yeah I might be a little bit loco
But it keeps me from losin' my mind
Oh but half insane that's ok
Babe a little bit crazy's alright
Nothin' wrong with a little excitement
No it makes me forget about work
'Cause I live by the rule that everything's cool
Just as long as nobody gets hurt
Hey I feel like I'm on vacation
Honey you say the word and we'll go
'Cause you're getting to me
In those cut off jeans
And that T-shirt from Sloppy Joes
Yeah I might be a little bit loco
But it keeps me from losin' my mind
Oh but half insane that's ok
Babe a little bit crazy's alright
Yeah the deep end might be so close
Oh that I'm hangin' on for dear life
Yeah I might be a little bit loco baby
But a little bit crazy's alright
(That's right)
