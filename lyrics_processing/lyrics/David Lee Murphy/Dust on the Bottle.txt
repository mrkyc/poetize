Creole Williams lived down a dirt road
He made homemade wine like nobody I know
I dropped by one Friday night and said, "Can you help me, Creole?
I got a little girl waiting on me, and I want to treat her right."

He said "I got what you need, son," as we sat down in the cellar
He reached through the cobwebs as he turned on the light and said

"There might be a little dust on the bottle
But don't let it fool you about what's inside
There might be a little dust on the bottle
But it's one of those things that gets sweeter with time"

You were sitting in the porch swing as I pulled up the driveway
My old heart was racing as you climbed inside
You slid over real close as we drove down to the lake road
And watched the sun fade in that big red sky

I reached under the front seat and said, "Now here's something special
It's just been waiting for a night like tonight
You might also like
"There might be a little dust on the bottle
But don't let it fool you about what's inside
There might be a little dust on the bottle
But it's one of those things that gets sweeter with time"

You're still with me
We've made some memories
After all these years
There's one thing I've found
Some say good love
Is like a fine wine
It keeps getting better
As the days go by

There might be a little dust on the bottle
But don't let it fool you about what's inside
There might be a little dust on the bottle
But it's one of those things that gets sweeter with time
There might be a little dust on the bottle
But don't let it fool you about what's inside
There might be a little dust on the bottle
But it's one of those things that gets sweeter with time
