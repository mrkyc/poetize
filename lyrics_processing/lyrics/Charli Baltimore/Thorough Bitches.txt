Thorough bitches, adapt to any borough bitches
(It's what the fuck is up)
Be in spots where they were no bitches, you feel me
(This mothafuckin' song right here)
Thorough bitches, adapt to any borough bitches
(We got Queen Pen)
Be in spots where they were no bitches, you feel me
(We got Da Brat-tat-tat)
Thorough bitches, adapt to any borough bitches
(We got the Lady of Rage)
Be in spots where they were no bitches, you feel me
(We got Gangsta Boo)
Thorough bitches, adapt to any borough bitches
(And it's her shit right here, C.B.)
Be in spots where they were no bitches, you feel me
(Huh, Charli Bal-T)
Thorough bitches, adapt to any borough bitches
(More)
Be in spots where they were no bitches, you feel me
(More and more)

Step from the darkness, with lyrical hardness
I'm a heartless
Ready or not regardless, I'm gon' start this
Part this, straight down the middle like the rod of Moses
Suckers think they cold as ice, I leave them in the freezer frozen
Me the chosen, me the golden
My controller, bigger and bolder
Knockin' them chips straight off his shoulders
It's over, no need to look back
You got beef
Give me the grease and raid and cook that
Look cat, don't provoke me
Lyrically I smoke thee like Annie Oakley
You think you the shit, that's a lie like Pinocchi-o
You didn't know that I assassinate 'em
Wipe 'em off the map, and baby then eradicate them
'Cause I, I be the master, think it's disastrous
When I crash MC's like the Indianapolis
5000, I'm housin', check one-two on this, I'm hot
Rage in effect I wreck you on this, I'm out
You might also like
Scarlett fever, cunt diva
Slick bitch quick to leave you
Deceive you, then cop a one way ticket to Indonesia
I sees you but you ain't no threat to a bitch like me
You can ice me, or step on my toes ever so slightly
And I'ma scorch your punk ass in the nine-ocho
We live immortal
Ice the cake out, you can't get a morsel
You light in the ass bitch too frail, I'm bout to set sail
Fuck waiting to exhale, find me on the block for the next sale
Why you swearing you rhyme hot?
Bitch I got it locked like Comstock
You bout to get rocked, so put the bunny back in the pots
As for the Glocks, they plastic
What color? Pick your casket
I know it get drastic
But bitches like you gotta get blasted

(Yeah, Ex Angels, thorough bitches)
Be in spots where they were no bitches, you feel me
(We in for life)
I leave hoes broke the fuck up
Throw they ass in slings
Angels chose to fuck up so I broke they wings
Got one dog, fuck fleas
Ridin' dick for no cheese
Sidekicks please, for Thelma and Louise, thorough b's
We got to split it B-I, ya'll hoes don't see us
Wanna get what we got, not blow spots in bohemos
Or meet us, with cheetahs, millimetres be nine inch
Blowin' out wombs like a fetus
How you greet us?
On you knees bitch, execution
Plus we cute and where the loot man?
Or we shootin' hoods up, roads down
Save the guns for thugs
I spent two dubs to bust hoes in they heads with plugs
What?

It'll take a million and one of you's to stop our flows
It's always a handful of you perpetrating ass hoes
All hyped up off of clothes
For check it we done run out
Snatched gears off the rack in '89
We done rolled out
We been thorough bitches from way, way back
Heffer you just got thorough since you signed your contract
Do not get it twisted, don't get it all fucked up
Stop, a platinum record don't mean you hot child
Walk a mile on these struggling ass streets
Like me and Charli B without deals we gon' eat
Regardless a thorough bitch be holding our own
Real bitches do dirty work with him being home, nigga
Thorough bitches, adapt to any borough bitches
Be in spots where they were no bitches, you feel me
Thorough bitches, adapt to any borough bitches
Be in spots where they were no bitches, you feel me
Thorough bitches, adapt to any borough bitches
Be in spots where they were no bitches

Came in like a tomboy, still one
Tote the guns, smoke the guns, kill summin'
Give you something you can feel, bumpin'
Speakers a speak and be thumpin'
It gets sweet when I freak the beat
Obsolete when you think you can meet
You front when you deny that I'm fly
You must think of me
You talk shit, get traced in the white chalk quick
I switch and alternate my soldiers who itchin' to spill the clip
Yeah I tricked for diamonds, but one of Chi Town's finest
And mami I'm mixed
Get wetter than Zinfandels wine gets
I'm a hot bitch, thorough, step up and get drop kicked
Whatever borough I rock shit
Trouble in my way, I gotta cry sometimes
Get high sometimes, and pray to my God, I don't die sometimes
But in the event of it happen, remember me for my rapping
And slashing a niggas ass for the fuck of it 'cause I'm Brat

I'm roastin' bitches daily baby, it's the oven in me
What you be jealous fuckin' hoe, you always looking at me
Act like you know, Gangsta Boo never buyin' you baby
In the Mercedes and 380s, Charli pass as to Lady
So I can spray these bitches up, tryin' touch my position
We be the Hypnotize Minds got it sewn like stiches
Peelin' bitches bananas better ask for 3-6
I ask Un motherfucka' with the Untertainment
I'm bring pain like the Method Man running through your veins
Like some blood, I'm the blood gang
Niggas ain't shit
Chains high as fuck but because I'm comin' up
Niggas from the south, what the fuck
We tear clubs up
