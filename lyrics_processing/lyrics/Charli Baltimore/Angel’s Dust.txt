Serenade the street with heat waves
P.A. to B.K. bitches
Keep my cliques to small masses
Flossin' while ballers sweatin' our fat asses
Pass the G stacks, estates from ReMax
Fuck duplex and condos decline those
The kinda hoes need anchors to rape us
Mean suck a dick straight out yo ass
Man we chase 'em
Type chick to freak out, speak out
Hold the tongue when you getting sprung
Throw cheeks out
Went from had 'em to madam
You see a B-More bitch show you how to bag 'em
What? 9-9 roll through with a whole crew of divas
Philly style we pushin' up on playas like cleavage
Charli's chicks, big lips, big hips
Ride around big whips, cats with big dicks
Those videos or flicks, on the low we keep it
Like your dough we keep, if you slow we peep it
My Angel's Dust dangerous
For the average stash karats
Next Tyson fight, Prada bag ain't fake ours
Stick cats from the Lakers
Take trips to Jamaica, extra paper
Cats caught the vapors
Like Biz and Kane 'cause we done flipped the game
Like niggas flip they 'caine
From right to left lane
Fast crack, pass that
Play these rap cats for they ASCAP
Fuck that
In '91 take a hustle to King of Prussia Mall
Getting fly offa DKNY
All his dough spent, step to an event
Hot to death, I'm running out of breath, damn
You might also likeYo Un you want 16 more?
(Yo bitch just keep rappin')
Yo, my comeback never done whack
Cats stressed and nail me like a thumbtack
And bend these walls
Swallow wood daddy, keep the throat clear like Halls
Mentho-Lyptus gotta lick it backwards to hit this
They know I can rip shit, what?
Know I can flip shit, what?
Thought I was coming on some high yellow chick shit
Spit like a nigga and fooled ya'll
48 straight through ya'll
Bring a hot bitch to ya'll
I'm here for my boostin' bitches
Here for my FedEx the clothes back to Houston bitches
Here for my credit card scam bitches
In stores with they backs to the cam bitches
I'm here for my trick nigga bitches
Get paper stash that from dick quick bitches, what
Play the cut 'til my 15 minutes is up
And drop, wanted to be wait
Be fashionably late
