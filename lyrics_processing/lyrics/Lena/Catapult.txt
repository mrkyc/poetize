So still for the longest time
I couldn't see
Two steps ahead I was blind
I, I... I, I could not decide
When I should dive
Which river will lead to the life
That I wanted
Don't know if you know
But you messed up my space
Just what I needed to move from this place
That I wanted
Gave me a reason to open the gate
Just when it felt like it could be too late

Launch me into, launch me into
Another atmosphere
Was it for you, was it for you
I would not be here

Want you to know
Want you to know
You're my catapult
Want you to know
Want you to know
Want you to know
Want you to know
You're my catapult
Want you to know
Want you to know

Just two strangers rendezvous
Make me forget
Everything I ever knew
You, you... You waiting around the bend
A second before
And we would never have met
Coincident
Don't know if you know
But you messed up my space
Just what I needed to move from this place
Coincident
Gave me a reason to open the gate
Just when it felt like it could be too late

Launch me into, launch me into
Another atmosphere
Was it for you, was it for you
I would not be here

Want you to know
Want you to know
You're my catapult
Want you to know
Want you to know
Want you to know
Want you to know
You're my catapult
Want you to know
Want you to know
I'm taking off into the sky
You can see me fly
It was you and I
Read between the lines
Tell me why you try
Living in a lie
Figured that I might
See you in another life
Please don't you try me this time
Can't stand me losing my mind
I'm gone
I been searching just to find
Something that'll keep me sane while I'm here
Something I can maintain while I'm here
This has never been a game I'm sincere
Promised I will never change I'm making it clear
Boy no fears
This is my truth and you heard it here first
We probably been through the absolute worst
Boy, you, this drama, it might not be worth it
But we're more than worth it
And that's why it hurts
Don't you listen to words
Coming from anybody else but me
Is this even gonna work, well, we'll see
What will be will be
But don't underestimate me--no!
Launch me into, launch me into
Another atmosphere
Was it for you, was it for you
I would not be here

Want you to know
Want you to know
You're my catapult
Want you to know
Want you to know
Want you to know
Want you to know
You're my catapult
Want you to know
