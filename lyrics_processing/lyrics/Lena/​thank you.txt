We all have knocks, and yes, I know it's tough, mm
But why's it so hard just to show some love?

Thank you for knockin' me down
'Cause these scars have just made me stronger
And your words, they don't matter now
So thank you, thank you for knockin' me down

For letting me down
Now that I know that every low will make me grow
Thank you
For knockin' me down
