(Poisoned air, I'll breathe you in)
(A straitjacket couldn't keep my hands off your skin)

We're bonded by somethin' that's spiritual
Twisted miracle, ooh-ooh-ooh
Whisperin' my name like a ritual
When you draw me close, ooh-ooh-ooh

I could spend a lifetime gettin' over you
I can meet somebody, but tell me, what's the use?
'Cause I would spend forever in hell to get to you
I don't really care 'cause nobody, nobody compares to

The way you touch, the way you love
They'd have to bury me before I'd ever give you up
Poisoned air, I'll breathe you in
A straitjacket couldn't keep my hands off your skin

Physical, magnetic, electrical
It's a bittersweet escape
Can't keep our hands off each other
We love so much that we suffer
I wouldn't have it any other way

I can meet somebody, but tell me, what's the use?
'Cause I would spend forever in hell to get to you
I don't really care 'cause nobody, nobody compares to

The way you touch, the way you love
They'd have to bury me before I'd ever give you up
Poisoned air, I'll breathe you in
A straitjacket couldn't keep my hands off your skin

(Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
A straitjacket couldn't keep my hands off your skin
(O-o-o-ooh, o-o-o-ooh, o-o-o-ooh, o-o-o-ooh)
A straitjacket couldn't keep my hands off your skin

I know it's dramatic
But there's no one else that I would ever break for
Push me to my limit
But you're givin' me that feeling that I'd wait for

I could spend a lifetime gettin' over you
I can meet somebody, but tell me, what's the use?
'Cause I would spend forever in hell to get to you
I don't really care 'cause nobody, nobody compares to
The way you touch, the way you love
They'd have to bury me before I'd ever give you up
Poisoned air, I'll breathe you in
