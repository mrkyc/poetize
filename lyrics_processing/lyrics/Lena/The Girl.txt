She runs to the wishing well
With her pocket full of dreams
One after the other
Throws them all into the deep
Throws them all into the deep
The fever is in her veins
Every moment she's awake
Secretly she listens
Waiting for the wind to change

Desperate to break away
To live what she believes
But she's afraid to try
'Cause no one's ready for the girl
Desperate to find a world
Where she can hold her own
But she's afraid to try
'Cause no one's ready for the girl
(No one's ready for the girl)

Held back by reputations
Just waiting for the time to pass
Brought down by expectations
But she's not gonna fight
'Cause no one's ready for the girl

Her life's not a wonderland
But it's all she's ever known
Secretly she wishes
There will be another door

Desperate to break away
To live what she believes
But she's afraid to try
'Cause no one's ready for the girl
It's hard to make a stand
Hanging from a string
But she's afraid to try
'Cause no one's ready for the girl
(No one's ready for the girl)

Held back by reputations
Just waiting for the time to pass
Brought down by expectations
But she's not gonna fight
'Cause no one's ready for the girl

She might be too much
(No one's ready for the girl)
Oh, but never enough
No one really knows, oh
No one really knows, oh-oh
She's living someone else's life
'Cause no one's ready for the girl
Held back by reputations
Just waiting for the time to pass
Brought down by expectations
'Cause no one's ready for the girl

Held back by reputations
Just waiting for the time to pass
Brought down by expectations
But she's afraid to fight
