I went everywhere for you
I even did my hair for you
I bought new underwear, they're blue
And I wore 'em just the other day
Love, you know I'd fight for you
I left on the porch light for you
Whether you are sweet or cruel
I'm gonna love you either way

Love, oh, love
I gotta tell you how I feel about you
'Cause I, oh, I
Can't go a minute without your love
Like a satellite, I'm in an orbit all the way around you
And I would fall out into the night
Can't go a minute without your love

Love, I got it bad for you
I saved the best I have for you
You sometimes make me sad and blue
Wouldn't have it any other way
Love, my aim is straight and true
Cupid's arrow is just for you
I even painted my toenails for you
I did it just the other day

Love, oh, love
I gotta tell you how I feel about you
'Cause I, oh, I
Can't go a minute without your love
Like a satellite, I'm in an orbit all the way around you
And I would fall out into the night
Can't go a minute without your
Love, oh, love
I gotta tell you how I feel about you
'Cause I, oh, I
Can't go a minute without your love

Where you go, I follow
You set the pace, we'll take it fast or slow
I follow in your way
Oh, oh, oh
You got me, you got me
A force more powerful than gravity
It's physics, there's no escape

Love, my aim is straight and true
Cupid's arrow is just for you
I even painted my toenails for you
I did it just the other day
Love, oh, love
I gotta tell you how I feel about you
'Cause I, oh, I
Can't go a minute without your love
Like a satellite, I'm in an orbit all the way around you
And I would fall out into the night
Can't go a minute without your love
Love, oh, love
I gotta tell you how I feel about you
'Cause I, oh, I
Can't go a minute without your love

Love, love, love
