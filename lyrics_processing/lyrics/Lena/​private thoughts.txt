If I tell you all my secrets
Would you love me? Ohh
If I showed you all the darkness
Would you stay or leave? Ohh
I'm so drunk in my mind
Could you chill for the night?
And hold me?
Just hold me!

I don't need you to be romantic
Take off your clothes, we're dirty dancing
You better not take this for granted
'Cause I don't usually do what I'm about to do

I'll let you go where it's not safe
I'll let you go (I'll let you go)
I wanna do what I can't say
I wanna do (I wanna do)
You see it on my face
Something I can't explain
I'll let you go where it's not safe
I'll let you go

Hold me closely, never lonely
When I'm next to you, 'cause
Ain't nobody touch my body
Like the way that you do, oh
I open up, I let you in
Let's get lost, let's get lost
Buried all my innocence
Let's get lost

I don't need you to be romantic
Take off your clothes, we're dirty dancing
You better not take this for granted
'Cause I don't usually do what I'm about to do

I'll let you go where it's not safe
I'll let you go (I'll let you go)
I wanna do what I can't say
I wanna do (I wanna do)
You see it on my face
Something I can't explain
I'll let you go where it's not safe
I'll let you go

You know what I'm thinkin' of
What I'm thinkin' of in my head
I don't wanna think at all
Wanna think it all when you're here
You know what I'm thinkin' of
What I'm thinkin' of is so clear
But I don't wanna think at all
I tell you my private thoughts

I'll let you go where it's not safe
I'll let you go (I'll let you go)
I wanna do what I can't say
I wanna do (I wanna do)
You see it on my face
Something I can't explain
I'll let you go where it's not safe
I'll let you go
