You were blind, I know you couldn't see it
But in the end, it just feels like you've cheated right to my face
You only did what you did for a reason, yeah
You tried to open up, but you were scared to lose what we have

Why, why
Did I tell you things that I didn't believe in?
I lied
Tried to protect you by hiding my feelings
We got tied
All up in this lie I created to keep you
On my side
Keepin' it inside of me isn't worth it

Don't lie to me
Don't you do what I've done to you
Don't lie to me
I promise I, I know it's bad for you
Don't lie to me
I don't wanna go back to how we both used to be
Oh nah nah, one thing I know
We won't lie 'round here no more
