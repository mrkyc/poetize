What am I afraid of the most?
Being left out or getting too close?
Taking blame for being me
Open up and still I won't be seen
I get paralyzed every time I try to wake up
Why do I let it get to me? Why do I let it get to me?
Eye to eye, fighting demons I'm  afraid of
Won't let them get best of me, didn't know it was a good thing

I'm scared of always losin' somethin'
I'm scared of endin' up with nothin'
It's okay, it's okay, I'll face it anyway
I'm scared, but fear don't scare me no more

I'm scared of always losin' somethin'
I'm scared of endin' up with nothin'
It's okay, it's okay, I'll face it anyway
I'm scared, but fear don't scare me no more

The worse, it may seem now to you
The more you know it's worth it too
Got all we need to handle that
So watch it, target, then attack

I'm scared of always losin' somethin'
I'm scared of endin' up with nothin'
It's okay, it's okay, I'll face it anyway
I'm scared, but fear don't scare me no more
Fear don't scare me no more

I get paralyzed every time I try to wake up
Why do I let it get to me? Why do I let it get to me?
Fantasize 'bout a life I'm not afraid of
Won't let them get best of me, didn't know it was a good thing

I'm scared of givin' up my secrets
I'm scared of seein' them torn to pieces
It's okay, it's okay, this is a part of me
