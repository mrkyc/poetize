Mister, can you help me? I'm lost here
Feels like I am getting nowhere
I'm sure that I don't wanna stay here, stay here
Mister, can you see I got a problem?
You seem nice, could you solve them?
My bag is heavy and I'm way too tired to keep movin' on
Oh, oh-oh

My feet are really hurting and my back is aching
God, my body's certainly weary and my legs are shaking
I've been searching for so long to get to destiny
But I can't find the arrow key
Been climbing up the walls but I am falling down
I've been running through the streets but I still haven't found
I'm looking for, I'm searching for it desperately
But I can't find the arrow key

Mister, I'm feeling cold and I'm lonely
The people seem to ignore me
But I do need someone to guide me, guide me
Mister, you really seem to be a nice guy
With your moustache and your kind eyes
It feels like I already know you, do I?
Oh, oh-oh
