I have a habit
It feels frenetic
Okay, a pretty irritating habit
I wouldn't say it's normal, it's fanatic
I am an addict
I'm a hysteric
I could explain it but you wouldn't get it
And now I have to deal with it, I'm at it

Ahh, addictive tendencies, mhm
They'll not get the best of me
Get the best of me, me, me

I'm okay, you're okay, we're okay, mhm
I love myself 'cause I am trying, love myself 'cause I am trying
I'm okay, you're okay, we're okay
I love myself 'cause I am trying, love myself, love myself

I'm okay, you're okay
I love myself 'cause I am trying, love myself 'cause I am trying
I'm okay, you're okay
I love myself 'cause I am trying, love myself, love myself

Yeah, I'm a manic
It's kinda selfish
I'm notoriously love-addicted
It's pretty obvious my mind is twisted
It's automatic
I hate to say it
I get frustrated but I overplay it
I won't say it so you don't mislay it

Ahh, addictive tendencies, mhm
They'll not get the best of me
Get the best of me, me, me

I'm okay, you're okay, we're okay, mhm
I love myself 'cause I am trying, love myself 'cause I am trying
I'm okay, you're okay, we're okay
I love myself 'cause I am trying, love myself, love myself

I'm okay, you're okay
I love myself 'cause I am trying, love myself 'cause I am trying
I'm okay, you're okay
I love myself 'cause I am trying, love myself, love myself
Ain't nobody gets me like I do, like I do
Ain't nobody gets me like I do, do

I'm okay, you're okay, we're okay, mhm
I love myself 'cause I am trying, love myself 'cause I am trying
I'm okay, you're okay, we're okay
I love myself 'cause I am trying, love myself, love myself

I'm okay, you're okay
I love myself 'cause I am trying, love myself 'cause I am trying
I'm okay, you're okay
