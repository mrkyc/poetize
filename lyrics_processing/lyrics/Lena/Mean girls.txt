How many of you have ever felt personally victimized by Regina George?

I thought you would be cool, and I thought you would be sweet
Got a face like an angel, but the devil underneath
You knew what to say, and you dressed a certain way
Flipped your hair and walked away, make me cray-ay-ay-ay
So I thought about it, and I cried about it
I decided (You're the problem), wrote a song about it
Yeah, you're beautiful, you're calculated, proud about it
With your money and your house and your daddy problems

But it's my mistake
I let a snake into my house
Then you got away
Yeah

This is for the mean girls
Stab-you-in-the-back kinda scene girls
Perfect hair and teeth, acting sweet girls
(You're not fooling me)
You don't have it all, but you say that you do
Gotta watch out for mean girls like you (You-you)
Mean girls
Stab-you-in-the-back kinda scene girls
Perfect hair and teeth, acting sweet girls
(You're not fooling me)
You don't have it all, but you say that you do
Gotta watch out for mean girls like you

Spreading rumors, your sense of humor
Only funny when you're not a victim of her
Once a bitch, always a bitch, yeah
I thought we grew up (I guess you didn't)

But it's my mistake
I let a snake into my house
Then you got away, away

This is for the mean girls
Stab-you-in-the-back kinda scene girls
Perfect hair and teeth, acting sweet girls

You don't have it all, but you say that you do
Gotta watch out for mean girls like you
