So many weeks, still hard to sleep
In this kingsize bed alone
Thoughts in my head keep coming back
I can't seem to let them go

Feeling so lonely, but I won't let it own me
I wanna cry it out 'til all the tears are gone
Somebody show me how to not go crazy
Didn't I tell myself that this is what I want?

When you were with me, mh-na-na
Life was a beach, yeah, mh-na-na
Now I can see the tracks at your feet
They don't lead up to me, na-na
When you were with me, mh-na-na
Life was a beach, yeah, mh-na-na
Now I can see it's not meant to be
But I still got me, mh-na-na

You were the place where I was safe
Let you close like no one else
I need some time, tryin' to find
This kinda home inside myself

I found someone, found someone to talk to
And I admit, we've been talkin' about you
I found someone who helped me deal with it so well
