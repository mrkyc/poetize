(You, ooh)
(You're the only drug worth doin', doin')

I feel bad for lovers that I had
That's somethin' that you and me do
They'll never know how good it feels to hold
The person that they were meant to

Lonely nights were the only nights 'til I met you, babe
Paranoid, tried to fill the void just to hide the pain
I did the time, yeah, I lived the life, I can walk away
I can walk away

You, ooh
You're the only drug worth doin'
Baby, you, ooh
You can have my heart to ruin, ruin
I've crossed that line enough to know, yeah
That there ain't nothin' even close
To you, ooh
You're the only drug worth doin', doin'

One look at you, there's nothin' that I could do
All of the sudden, I'm so alive
'Cause this is love, it's runnin' through my blood
Stars like ours don't just align

Lonely nights were the only nights 'til I met you, babe
Paranoid, tried to fill the void just to hide the pain
I did the time, yeah, I lived the life, I can walk away
I can walk away

You, ooh
You're the only drug worth doin'
Baby, you, ooh
You can have my heart to ruin, ruin
I've crossed that line enough to know, yeah
That there ain't nothin' even close
To you, ooh
You're the only drug worth doin', doin'
