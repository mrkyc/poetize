I feel your voice crawl over my body, my body, mmm
Rip me in two 'cause with you I'm a savage, I'm a savage

And now that I'm high on you
There's nothing wrong to do
Though I am lost in you
Don't push me to look 'cause I don't wanna find me
High on you
There's nothing wrong to do
Though I am lost in you, in you

'Cause I'm lost in you, you, you
I'm lost in you, you, you
I'm lost in you, you, you
I'm lost in you, you, you

I am lost in you
Oh, I am lost
Oh, I am lost in you
Oh, I am lost
Oh, I am lost in you

If I can find a way to get home again
And I lost all the maps that I thought were true
You're right here by my side, make me whole again
Don't need to find a way 'cause

I'm lost in you, you, you
I'm lost in you, you, you
I'm lost in you, you, you
I'm lost in you, you, you

I am lost in you

Oh, I am lost in you
Oh, I am lost
Oh, I am lost in you
Oh, I am lost
Oh, I am lost in you
