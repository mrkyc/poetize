Let me give you this good, good lovin'
Give me the word, girl, tell me somethin'
Give me the world, won't ask for nothin'
Let me show ya how much I really care

It's all about my, my baby
I hold the globe and she spins and we leave
Open the door, throw out the key
She helps me explore, that's what love really means

So tonight I'll return the favor
'Cause love is all that I gave ya
And I'm the one that'll save ya
Nothin' more, so don't go runnin' tonight

Let me give you this good, good lovin'
Give me the word, girl, tell me somethin'
Give me the world, won't ask for nothin'
Let me show ya how much I really care
So come and get this good, good lovin'
Give me the word, girl, don't start runnin'
Give me the world, won't ask for nothin'
Let me show ya how much I really care
