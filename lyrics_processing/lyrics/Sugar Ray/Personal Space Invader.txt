Sometimes, I just want to be left alone
Move your big head, it's my way, go and get your own

I don't care about the things you do
I don't care about the things you do
I don't care about the things you do
I don't care about the, I don't care about the

All my friends can't relate
No time off to hesitate
Feel my head, touch my face
Two steps back, you're in my space

You want more, impossible to satiate
Got the high score, forgot to put the letter H

I don't know about the things you do
I don't know about the things you do
I don't know about the things you know
About the things I know about the things you do

No time off to hesitate
Feel my head, touch my face
Two steps back, you're in my space

And now let's think of how we met
All the illegal pictures on the net
Remember how we taught you well
And that your playground is the gates of hell

I don't know about the things you do
I don't know about the things you do
I don't know about the things you do
I don't know about

All my friends can't relate
No time off to hesitate
Feel my head, touch my face
Two steps back, you're in my space

Can you see (I don't know about the things you do)
Touchin' me (I don't care about the things you do)
Can you see!
(Sometimes, I just want to be left alone)
I don't care about the things you do
I don't care about the things you do
(Move your big head, it's my way, go and get your own)
I don't care about the things you do
I don't care about, I don't care about

All my friends can't relate
No time off to hesitate
Feel my head, touch my face
Two steps back, you're in my space
