He was the heavyweight king at the age of 21
From the streets of New York where they're all called mean
Never had no mom, he never had no dad
His aunt and cuz Da'mato was all he ever had
But he found his pot of gold, consequently came Givins
And when they broke up, it was him that was givens
We like to build them up, but we love to see them fall
Finally taken down by a hooker five feet tall

I said I gotta set him free
I said I gotta set him free
I said I gotta set him free
I said I gotta set him free!

When push comes to shove! (Kickass!)
When push comes to shove! (Kickass!)
When push comes to shove! (Kickass!)
When push comes to shove, he'll be standing above!

It was a battle of brains, a battle of wit
So my man got his man, skilled Allen Durschwitz
But he left him out to dry, the judge was a fool
Using this case as a publicity tool
So it's off to the cell to meet the prison staff
The first thing they do, they want his autograph
And I just laugh 'cause he suffered the wrath
Now the man added time to his liberty path

I said I gotta set him free
I said I gotta set him free
I said I gotta set him free
I said I gotta set him free!

When push comes to shove! (Kickass!)
When push comes to shove! (Kickass!)
When push comes to shove! (Kickass!)
When push comes to shove, he'll be standing above!

I heard he gets a lot of visits, still he's got no family
But he gets a lot of love from the kids at Jodeci
What Desiree sucks kid and a new TV
Same name bitch, but don't look similar to me
But that's another story, I'm gettin' off track
Now when he gets out, I think you better watch your back
I said now when he gets out, I think you better watch your back
You may find yourself, kid, tagged and sacked
I said I gotta set him free
I said I gotta set him free
I said I gotta set him free
I said I gotta set him free!

When push comes to shove! (Kickass!)
When push comes to shove! (Kickass!)
When push comes to shove! (Kickass!)
When push comes to shove, he'll be standing above!
