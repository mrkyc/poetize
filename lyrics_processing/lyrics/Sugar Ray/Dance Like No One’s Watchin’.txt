That's when it seems you come around
And separate all that stuff
But ever gentle, just a touch of grace
But I would never know
'Cause you're the sun, the moon, the rain
And every summer breeze that fills the sails
Of every little boat out on the waves
That carry me back home
And we'll dance like no one is ever watchin'
And we'll love each other 'til the early mornin'
And we'll be together, girl, through stormy weather
And we'll stay together 'cause there's no way in hell
I'd ever let you go, I'd ever let you go
Never really felt like this before
And the fightin', yellin', screamin'
Makes me love you more
I only wanna be right here with you
Just lying on the sand without a thing to do
'Cause you're the sun, the moon, the rain
And every summer breeze that fills the sails
Of every little boat out on the waves
That carry me back home

I'd ever let you go, I'd ever let you go
Just hold my hand, just hold my hand
Try to make her understand
Just hold my hand, won't you hold my hand?
Well, you're the sun, the moon, the rain
