The only good thing that's creeping in this city
Elvis had a '55, this one is mine
Japanese cars, man, such a pity
A.M. Radio suits me fine

Brakes good, Tires fair
(Burn it!)

(Can you turn Mark up louder?)

Every now and then I drive just to get away
I'm eatin' up the lanes, I gotta find Sugar Ray
Can't stop now give me all your money
Sometimes I drive slow, sometimes I drive quick

A '68 coupe is all I need
So don't you dare mess with my mean machine

Jesus saves, no, he shoots and scores
I'm with stupid, caught my finger in the door
I'm wookin pa nub, like Revenge Of The Nerds
But my ass it's a play on words
