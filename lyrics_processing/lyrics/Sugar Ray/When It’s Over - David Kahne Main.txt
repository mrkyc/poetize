That's the time I fall in love again
When it's over
That's the time you're in my heart again
And when you go, go, go, go
I know it never ends
Never ends
All things that I used to say
All words that got in the way
All things that I used to know
Have gone out the window
All things that she used to bring
All songs that she used to sing
All her favorite TV shows
Have gone out the window
I'm missing you
I never knew how much you loved me
I'm missing you
I never knew how much you meant to me
I need you
And when you go, go, go, go
I know it never ends
It never ends

I'm wishing you
You never said you were pretending
I'm wishing you
You'd feel the same and just come back to me
I need you
