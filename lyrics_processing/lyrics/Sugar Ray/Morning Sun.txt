Creeping up right behind me?
When the moment is right I'm gonna tell her tonight
I'll tell her she's my morning sun
Here comes the morning sun
Spreading all the rays around me
When the ocean is right I'm gonna feel it tonight
I'll tell you who loves the morning sun
And with a smile like no other
It always brings me back to you
I can tell by the look in your eyes
You wanna be about it, come on and be about it
All daydreaming, staring at the ceiling
I'll be tripping baby if you leave
'Cause I toss and I turn and I wake up to the birds
Singing who loves the morning sun
It took so long for me to say goodnight
'Cause all the words got in the way
And I never wanna see you cry
'Cause I feel everything in my soul
We'll be shining forever
Yeah, it warm right here with you
And I can tell by the look in your eyes
You wanna be about it, go ahead and be about it
