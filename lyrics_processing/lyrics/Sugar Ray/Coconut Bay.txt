Co-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Co-oh, oh-oh
Down in Coconut Bay

From the mountaintops down to the sunny streets
Singing songs of love and swaying to the beat
Raise a glass up high and toast the ones you meet
Then you know, yeah, you know it

Feels like a million miles away from here
All your troubles disappear (Hey!)

Swimming in the sea in perfect harmony
Never going back, just blowing in the breeze
You and I will stay up in the stream
And we know it, yeah, we know it
