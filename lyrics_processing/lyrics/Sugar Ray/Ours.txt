One on one, the queen of two worlds
She was your woman, but she was my girl
That would make her ours
Mmmm hmmm
I met a girl
She had another
But I didn't know
The music was hella banging
On the stereo
A latte later, she said Yes
Grabbed me by the hands, much respect
Bounce to bounce came with what I came to get, (yeah this is how the story goes) mmm'
She was your woman, but she was my girl
One on one, the queen of two worlds
She was your woman, but she was my girl
That would make her ours
Mmmm hmmm
Next thing I know, she's with my sister
Talking to my mother, about the other
Is my girlie at home
Or is she with another
Another another another another
Tell me if you've seen him my brutha
A menage-a-three's not hard to see till then
Don't try to put me on hold
Shut up the situation
Like a Springer episode
Shut the door baby
Don't say a word

Dark blue skies
Over deep waters
You're drowning in a world of blue
Never taking time to separate the two
Both of 'em goin' crazy over you
One's your lover, the other's your man
Put them together
They wouldn't understand
She's mine
But you can have her
She's yours
I already had her
She's mine '
