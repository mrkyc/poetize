I'm sitting on top of the world today
Feels like things are gonna go my way
'Cause it all comes down to who we are
And it all breaks down to who we love

I'm sitting in the highest tree
'Cause the view looks good to me
So let's sing a melody
'Cause this is the place to be
I'm sitting in the highest tree
'Cause the view looks good to me
And this is the place to be
So let's sing the melody

Say hey, hey, hey (Hey, hey, hey)
Alright (Alright)
Hey, hey, hey (Hey, hey, hey)
Alright (Alright)

Riding up high on cloud nine today
Looks like everything will fall into place
'Cause it all comes down to the life we live (Oh, yeah)
And it all breaks down to the love we give
