What it is! All nice and easy slip of the curl
This is Super Cat and Sugar Ray riding through
Spread your love and fly, fly...

All around the world, statues crumble for me
Who knows how long I've loved you?
Everywhere I go people stop and they see
Twenty-five years old, my mother, God rest her soul
(Lord, have mercy)

I just wanna fly
(Uh, where you, uh, where you want)
Put your arms around me, baby
Put your arms around me, baby
I just wanna fly
(Where you want, where you try, uh, where you want)
Put your arms around me, baby
(I, I, I w-w-would tell her, here, well
Spread your love and fly, oh, me, oh, my
Spread your love and fly, oh, me for I
Spread your love and fly, fly)

Dance a little stranger
Show me where you've been (Say what?)
Love can make you hostage
Wanna do it again (Word)
There's no time to think
'Bout the starting or the end (Never)
We'll find out, I'm told
My mother, she told me so
(Yeah, yeah, check it out)
