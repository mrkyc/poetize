From the corner of my girlfriend's four-post bed
I know it's not mine, but I'll see if I can use it
For the weekend or a one-night stand
Couldn't understand how to work it out
Once again, as predicted
Left my broken heart open
And you ripped it out
Something's got me reeling
Stopped me from believing
Turn me around again
Said that we can do it
You know I wanna do it again
(Sugar Ray say) Oh-whoa-oh
Every morning
Every morning when I wake up
(Shut the door, baby, don't say a word)
She always rights the wrongs
She always rights, she always rights
(Shut the door, baby, shut the door, baby)
Every morning there's a heartache hangin'
From the corner of my girlfriend's four-post bed
I know it's not mine, and I know she thinks she loves me
But I never can believe what she said

When you stop believing
Turn me around again
Said we couldn't do it
You know I wanna do it again
Oh-whoa-oh
Every morning
Every morning when I wake up
(Shut the door, baby, don't say a word)
Oh-whoa-oh
Every morning
Every morning when I wake up
(Shut the door, baby, shut the door, baby)
She always rights the wrongs for me, baby
She always rights the wrongs for me
Every morning there's a halo hangin'
From the corner of my girlfriend's four-post bed
I know it's not mine, but I'll see if I can use it
For the weekend or a one-night stand
(Shut the door, baby, don't say a word)
Every morning
Every morning when I wake up
(Shut the door, baby, shut the door, baby)
Every morning (Turn me around again)
Every morning
(Shut the door, baby, don't say a word)
Every morning (Do it again)
Every morning when I wake up
Every morning
(Shut the door, baby, shut the door, baby)
