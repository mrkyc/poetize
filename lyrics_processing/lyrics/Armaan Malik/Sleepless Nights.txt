Doing nothing with you is better than doing
Anything with anybody
You don't have to try and I can't deny
With you, I feel like I'm somebody

You hit my heart, oh, hit it like a heart attack
We talkin' all the time like we insomniacs
It's something that I never, ever, ever had
I've never needed nobody

But I wanna spend sleepless nights and sleepy days with you (With you, with you)
You make me speechless when you speak the way you do (You do, you do)
'Cause nobody knows me better
And nobody else will ever be (Ever be)
Feeling like I feel the way I do, ooh, about you

Oh, oh, oh

I want to take you away, London for the day
Running through streets down in Soho
I could take all your pictures, laugh over dinner
We could go anywhere you wanna go
You might also like
You hit my heart, oh, hit it like a heart attack
We talkin' all the time like we insomniacs (Insomniacs)
It's something that I never, ever, ever had
I've never needed nobody

But I wanna spend sleepless nights and sleepy days with you (With you, with you)
You make me speechless when you speak the way you do (You do, you do)
'Cause nobody knows me better (Nobody knows me better)
And nobody else will ever be (Nobody else will ever be)
Feeling like I feel the way I do, ooh, about you

Nobody knows me better
Nobody else will ever be
Feeling like I feel the way I do about you
Nobody knows me better
Nobody else will ever be
Feeling like I feel the way I do about you, about you

Sleepless nights and sleepy days with you (With you, with you)
You make me speechless when you speak the way you do (You do, you do)
'Cause nobody knows me better (Nobody knows me better)
And nobody else will ever be (Oh, nobody else will ever be, oh)
