You ready
Thank you Grizzly Bear
{Trey Wright}
I probably left you hanging
Like you shoulda took viagra
Cheese on top of bread
Call it pizza with some fat crust
Give your girl an orange soda
I think she's got a crush
You probably shouldn't ask her why she always starts to blush
Listen,Im not in to making friends
No thank you
Ill leave you out to dry
An you won't even have to wait dude
Ohh I'm that kid you wish you knew
Cause no I act like a horny dude, always makin moves
My life is McDonalds, Im Lovin it
They see me with two bitches
Thou shall not covet it
Beat the beat up like it owes me lunch money
Running this shit
So run from me
You might also likeLife's a roller coaster
Don't get sick to the stomach
6 foot 7foot, 8 I'm on my bunch shit
Put you on some crunk shit
Eat this beat for lunch
Its easy when your greedy
You love it...
{Skizzy}
Here we go
So put that weed on the table
And they gonna roll it up
And then before hit the club
I'll smoke it up
Im getting comments from haters
Like I'm not old enough
Man that game is broken
And I'm just trying to sew it up
And Mr. Midas told me potential means nada
And I'm just trying pop up on the scene like ta-da
Your girl calling you baby
Ok she calling me papa
I don't really smoke
But tonight Ill be a rasta
Georg Jensen, my bitches be expensive
The soldiers straighten up when I call for all they attention
And I just love making music for the people
Had a hit a couple weeks ago
They asking for a sequel
God I'm a deciepal
Heroin to you evil
Im killin y'all on the daily
Im stuntin Evel Knievel
AH and Ranko brought a couple bars back stage
And lil star? was like lets rage
Thats what we did
White girls who are confused, on my favorite
Come over to my crib and sip this wine I've been aging
They know I spit fire
Hot flames robs cajun
Good defense on these rappers
Common up and they fading away. hey
I got flames on this Calgary shit
Ralph lauren wardrobe on my cavalry shit
Heard you had a new track
Knew it had to be shit
Different galaxy
Martha fuck with gravity
Bitch so put that weed on the table
And they gonn roll it up
And then before we hit the club
Ill smoke it up
Im getting comments from haters
Like I'm not old enough
Man that game is broken

{Trey Wright}
Uh oh here we go
Bong hits and snare kicks
Thats just how I'm livin now
I made a mil off a mix tape
Got you thinking how can he do it
Every verse is bonkers
I can kill a check
Like tyler himself in yonkers
So please don't test me
Word plays so sweet
Like I invested in nestle
Uh, no tobacco
But I'm spitting with grizzly
Fuck it I'm a douchebag
Go and ask skizzy
And forget what you heard about me
All I do is spit the truth
Haters couldn't doubt me
The cheapest vodka and sprite up in my red cup
Shout the clubs name every night you know we live it up
Your style is so fake
Like a perm on a whig
But I'm the realest rapper out
Trey wright- ya dig
