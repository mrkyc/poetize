Every time you take a sip
In this smoky atmosphere
You press that bottle to your lips
And I wish I was your beer
And in the small there of your back
Your jeans are playing peekaboo
I'd like to see the other half
Of your butterfly tattoo

Hey, that gives me an idea
Well, let's get out of this bar
Drive out into the country
And find a place to park

'Cause I'd like to see you out in the moonlight
I'd like to kiss you way back in the sticks
I'd like to walk you through a field of wildflowers
And I'd like to check you for ticks

I know the perfect little path
Out in these woods I used to hunt
But don't worry, babe, I've got your back
And I've also got your front
Now, I'd hate to waste a night like this
I'll keep you safe, you wait and see
The only thing allowed to crawl all over you
When we get there is me

You know every guy in here tonight
Would like to take you home
But I've got way more class than them
Babe, that ain't what I want

'Cause I'd like to see you out in the moonlight
I'd like to kiss you way back in the sticks
I'd like to walk you through a field of wildflowers
And I'd like to check you for ticks

Now, ooh, you never know where one might be
And, ooh, there's lots of place that are hard to reach
I gotcha

I'd like to see you out in the moonlight
I'd like to kiss you, baby, way back in the sticks
I'd like to walk you through a field of wildflowers
And I'd like to check you for ticks
Oh, I'd sure like to check you for ticks
