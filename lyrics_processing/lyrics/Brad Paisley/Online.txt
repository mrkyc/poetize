I work down at the Pizza Pit
And I drive an old Hyundai
I still live with my mom and dad
I'm 5'3" and overweight
I'm a sci-fi fanatic, mild asthmatic
I've never been to second base
But there's a whole 'nother me you need to see
Go check out MySpace

'Cause online, I'm out in Hollywood
I'm six-foot-five and I look damn good
I drive a Maserati, I'm a black belt in Karate
And I love a good glass of wine
It turns girls on that I'm mysterious
I tell 'em I don't want nothin' serious
'Cause even on a slow day, I can have a three-way
Chat with two women at one time
I'm so much cooler online
So much cooler online

I get home, I kiss my mom
And she fixes me a snack
I head down to my basement bedroom
And fire up my Mac
In real life, the only time I've
Ever even been to L.A
Was when I got the chance with the marchin' band
To play tuba in the Rose Parade
See Brad Paisley LiveGet tickets as low as $55You might also like
But online, I live in Malibu
I've posed for Calvin Klein, I've been in GQ
I'm single and I'm rich
And I got a set of six-pack abs that will blow your mind
It turns girls on that I'm mysterious
I tell 'em I don't want nothin' serious
'Cause even on a slow day, I can have a three-way
Chat with two women at one time
I'm so much cooler online
Yeah, I'm cooler online

When you got my kinda stats, it's hard to get a date
Let alone a real girlfriend
But I grow another foot and I lose a bunch of weight
Every time I log in

Online, I'm out in Hollywood
I'm six-foot-five and I look damn good
Even on a slow day, I can have a three-way
Chat with two women at one time
I'm so much cooler online
Yeah, I'm cooler online
I'm so much cooler online
Yeah, I'm cooler online
(Yeah, he's cooler online)
Hey, I'm cooler online
(Oh, yeah, he's cooler online)
Yeah, I'm singin' online
Hey, I'm cooler online
(Yeah)
