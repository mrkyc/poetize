I can make anybody pretty
I can make you believe any lie
I can make you pick a fight
With somebody twice your size

Well, I've been known to cause a few break ups
And I've been known to cause a few births
Well, I can make you new friends
Or get you fired from work

And since the day I left Milwaukee
Lynchburg and Bordeaux, France
Been making the bars
Lots of big money
And helping white people dance

I got you in trouble in high school
But college, now that was a ball
You had some of the best times
You'll never remember with me

See Brad Paisley LiveGet tickets as low as $55You might also like
I got blamed at your wedding reception
For your best man's embarrassing speech
And also for those
Naked pictures of you at the beach

I've influenced kings and world leaders
I helped Hemingway write like he did
And I'll bet you a drink or two
That I can make you
Put that lampshade on your head

Cause since the day I left Milwaukee
Lynchburg and and Bordeaux, France
Been making a fool out of folks just like you
And helping white people dance

I'm medicine and I am poison
I can help you up or make you fall
You had some of the best times
You'll never remember with me

Alcohol
Alcohol
Yeah since the day I left Milwaukee
Lynchburg and Bordeaux, France
Been making the bars
Lots of big money
And helping white people dance

I got you in trouble in high school
But college, now that was a ball
You had some of the best times
You'll never remember with me
