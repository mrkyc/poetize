When you see a deer, you see Bambi
And I see antlers up on the wall
When you see a lake, you think picnics
And I see a largemouth up under that log
You're probably thinkin' that you're gonna change me
In some ways, well, maybe you might
Scrub me down, dress me up, oh, but no matter what
Remember I'm still a guy

When you see a priceless French paintin'
I see a drunk, naked girl
You think that ridin' a wild bull sounds crazy
And I'd like to give it a whirl
Well, love makes a man do some things he ain't proud of
And in a weak moment, I might
Walk your sissy dog, hold your purse at the mall
But remember I'm still a guy

And I'll pour out my heart, hold your hand in the car
Write a love song that makes you cry
Then turn right around, knock some jerk to the ground
'Cause he copped a feel as you walked by

I can hear you now talkin' to your friends
Sayin', "Yeah, girls, he's come a long way"
From draggin' his knuckles and carryin' a club
And buildin' a fire in a cave
But when you say a backrub means only a backrub
Then you swat my hand when I try
Well, now, what can I say? At the end of the day
Honey, I'm still a guy

And I'll pour out my heart, hold your hand in the car
Write a love song that makes you cry
Then turn right around, knock some jerk to the ground
'Cause he copped a feel as you walked by

These days, there's dudes gettin' facials
Manicured, waxed, and botoxed
With deep spray-on tans and creamy lotion-y hands
You can't grip a tacklebox
Yeah, with all of these men linin' up to get neutered
It's hip now to be feminized
But I don't highlight my hair, I've still got a pair
Yeah, honey, I'm still a guy
Oh, my eyebrows ain't plucked, there's a gun in my truck
Oh, thank God I'm still a guy
