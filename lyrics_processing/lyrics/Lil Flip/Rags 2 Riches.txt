It was all a dream... (Ha-ha)
We finally made it (finally made it)
One A, One B
We came up from

Rags to riches (wha)
Rags to riches (wha)
Me and Will-Lean came up from rags to riches (wha)
Rags to riches (wha)
Rags to riches (wha)
 We're Clover G's, pull up, we got the baddest bitches
 Rags to riches (wha)
Rags to riches (wha)
Me and Will-Lean came up from rags to riches (wha)
Rags to riches (wha)
Rags to riches (wha)
 We're Clover G's, pull up, we got the baddest bitches

 I push a drop-top
 I push a Maserati
 I got five screens
 In my black Denali
 You know the ladies love us
 You know the niggas hate us
 We learn to make the money
 Don't let the money make us
 We can't fuck with you fakers
 We keep a gat for jackers
 Them shots will hit ya ass
 BOOM! Harder than a linebacker
 I got a chip on my shoulder
 I got three clips in my holster
 Let's get it on nigga
 Before I spit ya dome nigga
 I'm nominated this year
 We need a Grammy nigga
 I'm at the Source Awards
 Down in Miami nigga
 I used to be broke
 Now we paid in full
 We back to back (back to back)
 Like the Chicago Bulls
 We came a long way
 You shouldn't have made a left (made a left)
We made a right (made a right)
 You went the wrong way
Now we coming up
 Y'all niggas goin' broke
 We got our own weed
 Y'all still borrowin' smokes
You might also like

 I fuck with mad hoes
 You already know
 I got three chicks in Pensacola
 And two in Me-ji-co
 And we thuggin
 Rollin' on dubs
 I can't quit like Snoop
 We smokin' our stuff
 Nigga, you not hard
 You just a pop star
 You sweet in the middle
 You remind me of a Pop Tart
 You had a head start
 But you in last place
 That's what you niggas get
 For movin' at a fast pace
 We number one for real-uh
 Just fire up the killa
 And if you wanna show
 Just wire us the skrilla
 We came to bring the pain
 And Johnny bring the chain
 What about the watch?
 We got special rocks
 Cause we got extra Glocks
 With a few extra shots
 When I reflect a dot
 You gettin' extra dots
 We got Lexus drops
 Our paper never stop
 We Clover G's on top
 And we extra hot
