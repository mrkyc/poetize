I never meant to break your heart
But you know how life go, shit happen
But you know I still got your back
And I just wanna tell you that
I never meant to break your heart
But you know how life go, shit happen
But you know I still got your back
And I just wanna tell you that

Many nights you waited up, but I never called back
And every time I had a show, I would tell you to fall back
I know you think I got chicks in every state
I know my lifestyle fast, but I'ma pump my brakes
At the beginning, everything was cool
I used to leave the studio, and pick you up from school
You was there when I had to eat Ramen noodles
If you ain't careful, stress is what the game'll do ya
I got the world on my shoulders
That's why I lace my girl with a Clover
I know you worried cause I stay in the streets, ma
But don't worry, cause I roll thirty deep, ma
I'm good!

I never meant to break your heart
But you know how life go, shit happen
But you know I still got your back
And I just wanna tell you that
You might also like
At first it was restaurants, then the movies
Now you typing crazy messages in my two-ways
But as time goes, I meet a million hoes
But they ain't like you, cause they ain't got pretty toes
You know thugs never let they feelings show
But anytime you wanna talk, just let me know
Cause I got your back, we a perfect match
It's me and you against the world, who's stopping that?

I never meant to break your heart
But you know how life go, shit happen
But you know I still got your back
And I just wanna tell you that
I never meant to break your heart
But you know how life go, shit happen
But you know I still got your back
And I just wanna tell you that

I like to see you with no makeup on
I like to see you with a Jacob on
Now do your thang, girl
If you wanna get to know me, just holla, girl
Have you ever rode in a drop top Impala, girl?
I can turn a good girl into a bad girl
I got you rockin' black ice, no more black pearls
I can't lie, I want your body in the worst way
