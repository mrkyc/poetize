Yo, JP
Look, I'm a millionaire, but I ain't used nothin' in my life that my teachers taught me

My teachers never taught me that (My teachers never taught me that)
How to deal with this or that, how to make my paper stack
How to get a DM back, how to buy a Lambo cash
My teachers never taught me that (yo)

My teachers never liked me one bit
They said I would amount to be shit
They thought I was just another misfit
I had to make like a banana and split
Now, Jakey in a mansion, got 8 builders for expansion
All these diamonds on my dances, Mrs. Claus just see me flashin'
My Lambo hit the gas, and all these Prius's I'm passin'
216 to Calabasas, I feel like Kim Kardashian

My teachers never taught me that (My teachers never taught me that)
How to deal with this or that, how to make my paper stack
How to get a DM back, how to buy a Lambo cash
My teachers never taught me that
You might also like
My teachers said I need to get up on my grades
I need to get my B's and raise 'em up to them A's
I walk in the class, I got Supreme on my J's
You always tryna hate, but you got nothin' to say
I'm almost at the top, I'm the young Lebron James
I'm not the same in my own brain, I'm in a different lane
It's yo girl Sunny, and call me Mrs. Stay-On-Top
I'm on this record, killin' the game, and this a bop

My teachers never taught me that (My teachers never taught me that)
How to deal with this or that, how to make my paper stack
How to get a DM back, how to buy a Lambo cash
My teachers never taught me that

Never taught me how to flow when I be on the beats
Skippin' class all day, there be F's all on my sheet
Detentions everyday, got me kicked off the team
And the teachers never cared about my California Dream (No)
I was nothin', just a nerd like McLovin
My teacher's frontin', talkin' shit 'cause I'm nothin'
Now I'm somethin', speakers bumpin'
Crowd jumpin', money comin'
Wrist flooded, girls lovin'
Whip stunnin' (Damn)
My teachers never taught me that
(My teachers never taught me that)
How to deal with this or that
How to make my papers stack
How to get a DM back
