Hah, sorry Logan
I have to diss you
You started it
But I'ma finish this
Also I did this in one day

Help me help you make a better song bitch
Numbers don't lie, the Logang is shit
And Why Don't We is the Walmart One Direction
The Jake Paulers on top and we stay flexin'

You know is Team 10
And you know I stay reppin'
Why all your vlogs look like mine, reflection
I see you talking trash
About the song we made
We did it in one day
You had to spend 60K
Turn on you radio Kiss FM
Just hit us with a play
Only thing worse than your song is the Logang
And Why Don't We talk about
How your just a rebound
David came to you after AJ Mitchell wasn't down
Did I just go there?
That's just my warm up
Mr. Donald Trump hair
I don't really flippin' care
I'ma snap on the beat
So everyone knows not to mess with me
Yes you do movies
But are you on Disney?
Bitch, this is a marathon not a sprint
You was poppin' on Vine
But now your content is shit
That's why you dropped a song
And text me to promo it
You was on top
What happened, Mr. Fit?
Now every vid you make
Got my name in it
This my second song
But I'm already hall of fame with it
Yeah, we both got Lambos
But you don't know how drive that shit
Hate it or love it the underdog on top
And I will never stop
Like I'm running from the cops
You might also like
Help me help you make a better song bitch
Numbers don't lie, the Logang is shit
And Why Don't We is the Walmart One Direction
The Jake Paulers on top and we stay flexin'

Now let me help you out
I'ma roast myself now
You got more followers on Instagram, wow
I thought like for 20 minutes of how else I can roast myself and that's all I got
But I'm sorry Logan
JK, I'm never sorry
You thirsty for the views
Call it Kalahari
You the Karate Kid
And I'm Mr. Miyagi
You just a Prius
And I'm a Bugatti

Help me help you make a better song bitch
Numbers don't lie, the Logang is shit
And Why Don't We is the Walmart One Direction
