Caught in my emotions
Oh, shit

I've been drinkin', floatin', caught in my emotions, losin' my mind (my mind)
I've been sinkin', copin', left my heart broken, I don't know why
I've been thinkin', hopin', can we leave it open? I just need time
I just need time, but why even try?

I'm single, I'm single
I'm single, I'm single (Jake Paul)

All the time (Yeah), on my mind (Bro)
When I'm workin' out (I don't love you no more), yeah
You on the 'Gram (Yeah), goin' ham (Yeah)
Say you goin' out (Goin' out)
Well that's fine, that's fine, that's fine (Woo)
You can go out, you can have a good time (Go for it)
But just know at the same time (Guess what?)
I can play games too (Hahaha)

I just need time (I just need time), but why even try? (But why even try?)

Tryna grab my heart, playin' defense
Got me drunk, textin' on the weekend
Way too young to be stressin' out

Gettin' cheddar now, big cheese feta now
I was tryna bring you up but you let me down
