I love you big bro, I love you big bro
And I want you to know that I'm so sorry
For things I said, sometimes I wish
That our war would end
I want you to know, they were just jokes
These times they get tough, that's just when we go
Oh why can't it be like Ohio
LA changed us, but I want you to know
That I love you bro

He's my lil' bro can't blame him
Kinda hard, but it's my job to tame him
He's a loose cannon, a live wire
But I see that he's calling for a ceasefire
We got the same last name, same blood
So much hate, but where is the love?
Animosity, negativity, what happened to all the smiles and happy energy
Came up in Ohio, wasn't much to do
Then we found this place called YouTube
We made our dreams come true
Work hard and you can too
Yeah we may have had one small brawl
But I can move on, and  so should y'all
I will pick him up if he falls
After all it's the Rise of the Pauls
You might also like
I love you lil' bro, I love you lil' bro
And I want you to know that I'm so sorry
For things that I said, I just want to be friends
So let's make amends and be bros til' the end
{Verse 2: Jake Paul]
All we have is each other, from the same mother
What more can I ask in a brother?
Shouts out to all the Logang Paulers
Look up to you everyday bro
Tearing up as I switch the flow
I messed up and it's hard to let go
But You picked me up, when I was on the flo
And I want you to know that I love you bro
And Sometimes I Just wanna run out the door
But I know and I know that I don't really know
But I'm a kid in LA and I'm just trying to grow
And life moving so fast I do and I go
And I been on my own since 17 years old
And all I had with me is my brother Logan
And I want you to know
That I love you bro

I love you my bro, I love you my bro
And I want you to know that I'm so sorry
For things that I said, I just want to be friends
