Blood, sweat, tears, yeah
Got no fears, no
It's my time, huh
Heart's beating inside now
People tryna stop me
Odds all stacked against me
I'ma show the world that
It's better not to test me
'Cause

Bitch, I'm a fuckin' champion
Bitch, I'm a fuckin' champion
Grindin' work, I do this shit for fun
Phoenix, bitch, I'm risin' like the sun
I'm a fuckin' lion, I'm the one

I am the one, if you not, then you last
LP and Jake came to take out the trash
Stay in your lane, if you don't, then you crash
Beat up your face like your face need a mask
I'ma show the world, just sit tight
Hit 'em with a left then a big right
Team Paul, now I gotta mid fight
Oh, it's a blackout, call it midnight
Champ gon' hit him with a great hook
Get up from the ground, it's not a great look
Jab to your face, how your face look
Posted on the gram, got the gram shook

Blood, sweat, tears, yeah
Got no fears, no
It's my time, huh
Heart's beating inside now
People tryna stop me
Odds all stacked against me

Bitch, I'm a fuckin' champion
Bitch, I'm a fuckin' champion

Bitch, I'm a fuckin' champion
Bitch, I'm a fuckin' champion
Grindin' work, I do this shit for fun
Phoenix, bitch, I'm risin' like the sun
I'm a fuckin' lion, I'm the one

You ain't been through what I've been through
Days where no food on the menu
One bed, three people
I used to sleep in the middle
Two faces on the pillow
Now tryna get to the Skrilla
I'ma fight until I get it
Knockin' out the competition
We came here on a mission
But they don't wanna see us winnin'
Team Paul with the RNBO
We ain't basic but we used to
See the most hated
Logan and Jake tonight
They will be crowned the greatest
Bitch, I'm a fuckin' champion
Bitch, I'm a fuckin' champion
Grindin' work, I do this shit for fun
Phoenix, bitch, I'm risin' like the sun
I'm a fuckin' lion, I'm the one

I will not stop 'til I'm dead
Ice in my veins and my head
Fuck all that shit that's been said
We just be laughin' at hate
'Cause it just keep makin' us bread
I am the champ from the land
I got the game in my hand
I got my mind on the plane
Never was shit wasteman
But I kept on grindin' and I never gave a damn

Blood, sweat, tears, yeah
Got no fears, no
It's my time, huh
Heart's beating inside now
People tryna stop me
Odds all stacked against me
I'ma show the world that
It's better not to test me
'Cause
