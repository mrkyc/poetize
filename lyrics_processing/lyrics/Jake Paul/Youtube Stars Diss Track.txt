Pressure hard, they all watchin' now
Make a mistake, world on me now
It ain't easy, just a kid from a small town
To every news publication tryna take me down
I'm human too, they want me to lose
Want me in a noose but they ain't tell the truth
Tryna drag my name, tryna stop my game
Don't know the pain, bitch, I know the pain

Man, where was y'all at when I was on email
Tryna stop depressed fans from killin' themselves?
Man, where was y'all at when I was in the kitchen
Whippin' up meals for kids on Thanksgiving?
Where was y'all at when I was with a teacher
Handin' out backpacks & handing out t-shirts
Or where was y'all at when Make-A-Wish hit me
To meet my girl, Caylee
Damn, that shit changed me

That ain't on the news
You think you know me, but
That ain't on the news
That ain't on your Twitter
That ain't on your Insta
That ain't on your Twitter, man

This is for all of the liars
Spreadin' these rumors like a virus
They don't really know nothin' 'bout us
They don't know nothin' about us

I'm sorry for my actions, man, I'm askin' for forgiveness, man
I'm askin' you to witness my growth in this business
My growth as kid, shit I know you can't admit it
You know that I kill it, you know my game pippin'
You know the views rippin', you know that I'm a villain
You know the bank chillin', you know that you can't stop me
Yeah I know that I'm cocky, you know that I'm tryna not be
Like I said I'm sorry, but I gotta ask, man

Where was y'all at when I was in the lunchroom
Stoppin' kids from getting bullied?
They were scared to come to school, man
Where was y'all at when I was 17 years old and
Livin' on my own tryna to find a way to grow, man?
Where was y'all at when Selena left Disney?
Didn't talk shit to her, but now you talk shit to me
Where was y'all at when the neighbors didn't hate me?
They all wanted pictures, but now they tryna play me
