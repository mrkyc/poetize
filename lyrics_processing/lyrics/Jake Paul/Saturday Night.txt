Saturdays are for the boys

What ya doin' this Saturday night?
Me and you, this Saturday night
Uber to the cribs this Saturday night
Netflix and Chill this Saturday night
Swipe right on you this Saturday night
Pizza and ranch this Saturday night
Chillin' in my Calvins this Saturday night
Let's get a tattoo this Saturday night

Saturdays are for the boys
Saturday, let's make some noise
Taco Bell is open late
Slumber parties, movie date
Saturday, I can't complain
Take me back to the good ol' days
Ohio and chasing baes
That's how they made Saturdays
In my Jeep, lots of doors
Pullin' up to Gucci stores
Start a fire, cook some s'mores
Found a date and close the door
Yeah, we're here, yeah, we're lit
Now it's 'Rari's, no civics
I ain't sorry, we got hits
Tell the DJ, "Play our shit!"

Mini Cooper and your chick to my right
Fish and Chips, this Saturday night
London is my country, you can take a flight
Winston Church and you don't wanna fight
I got my Visa last Saturday night
Last Saturday night, (Ronald Weasley), last Saturday night
