Ohio Fried, chicken, bitch
We made this, in one day
Tricky Rick, Bobby Slick
Ohio boys, let's hit it

Honkey-donk, tonkey-tonk
Ohio Fried Chicken is what it's called (Yeehaw)
I got my truck, my overalls
Just me and my boys makin' fried chicken, y'all

Kentucky can't compete (No), OFC yee-yeet (Woo)
Sweep you off yo' feet (Yeah), please look up to me
We'll tell you what to do, tenders the move (They are)
Get yourself some sauce, yeah, you a boss

OFC, that's how we're livin'
Come around town, you'll find me sittin'
You're a pretty girl with no care
No problem in the world, not even her hair
I think I found what I finally need
Chicken and a girl that's nice and thickened
Slow it down or speed it up
I'm makin' my way to Ohio Fried Chicken, bitch
