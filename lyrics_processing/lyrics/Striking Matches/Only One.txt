Summertime rescue me
It's been a long cold season on my knees
I'm runnin' out of runnin' room
Don't wanna have to find another you

Are you listening baby?
Are you listening baby?
Listen to me now
Listen to me now

I will not be the only one (Not be the only one)
I will not be the only one (Not be the only one)
I will not be the lonely one
In this love
I will not be the only one (Yeah, not be the only one)
I will not be the only one (Not be the only one)
I will not be the lonely one
In this love

Trepidation weighing on me
And I'm second guessing everything
Baby, baby, baby, make me lose my mind
Make me crazy, crazy, wasting all my time
You might also like
And are you listening baby?
Are you listening?
Listen to me now
Listen to me now

I will not be the only one (Not be the only one)
I will not be the only one (Not be the only one)
I will not be the lonely one
In this love
I will not be the only one (Not be the only one)
I will not be the only one (Not be the only one)
I will not be the lonely one
In this love
No

I will not be the only one (Not be the only one)
I will not be the only one (Not be the only one)
I will not be the lonely one
In this love
I will not be the only one (Not be the only one)
I will not be the only one (Not be the only one)
I will not be the lonely one
In this love
I will not be the only one (Not be the only one)
I will not be the only one (Not be the only one)
I will not be the lonely one
