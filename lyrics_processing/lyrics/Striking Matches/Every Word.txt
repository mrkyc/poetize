The days are long
But the nights are longer
It's like you're stuck inside my head
I close my eyes
And I go under
I beg to hear your voice and then

There is a lullaby
For all these sleepless nights
When all my fears are closing in
I've found my anthem now
Oh, I would die without
And I'm not scared of anything 'cause

Even if the lights go down
And love is something we've worn out
There will be a song we used to sing
And I will feel you in the melody
When all else has disappeared
I will always find you there
Even if it burns, even when it hurts
I'll remember, I'll remember every word
You might also like
We used to dance
Like a broken record
The imperfections made it real
The slightest whisper
Can crash like thunder
Reminds me how I used to feel

I get surrounded by
All of these sounds and I
I'm not afraid of anything

Even if the lights go down
And love is something we've worn out
There will be a song we used to sing
And I will feel you in the melody
When all else has disappeared
I will always find you there
Even if it burns, even when it hurts
I'll remember, I'll remember every word

If I still sing about you
Will you still sing about me too?
If I still sing about you
Will you still sing about me too?
If I still sing about you
Will you still sing about me too?
If I still sing about you
Will you still sing about me too?
When all else has disappeared
I will always find you there
Even if it burns, even when it hurts
I'll remember, I'll remember
Even if it burns, even when it hurts
