I like the tension with us
There's nothing left to discuss
I know you feel it 'cause
Your eyes do the talkin' for ya
I'm hanging on your words
Like I'm your prisoner
Don't care if I'm the first
To say but there's something 'bout
The way you move the way you do

Your kiss fills up my lungs with smoke
Every word you speak, it chokes me
Can't you see there ain't no stopping us now?
We're steam up on the window
Baby, come tomorrow
It's too late to put us out, we're
Burnin' down, woah
Burnin' down, woah

Feels like the more we try
To keep it locked up tight
Temperature's gonna rise
Don't say I didn't warn ya
Your lips are fire red
Tracing the shape of them
Don't know if I'm the first to say
But there's something 'bout
The way you move the way you do
You might also like
Your kiss fills up my lungs with smoke
Every word you speak, it chokes me
Can't you see there ain't no stopping us now?
We're steam up on the windows
Baby, come tomorrow
It's too late to put us out, we're
Burnin' down, woah
Burnin' down, woah

When the sun comes up in the morning
We'll be nothing but ashes on the ground
When the sun comes up in the morning
We're burning down, burning down, burning down (Burning down)
When the sun comes up in the morning
We'll be nothing but ashes on the ground
When the sun comes up in the morning
We're burning down, burning down, burning down
We're burning down, we're burning down
We're burning down, burning down, burning down

Your kiss fills up my lungs with smoke
Every word you speak, it chokes me
Can't you see there ain't no stopping us now?
We're steam up on the windows
Baby, come tomorrow
It's too late to put us out, we're
Burnin' down, woah
Burnin' down, woah
Burnin' down, woah
