You're heading towards the door
Tripping on my words
I make my way across the floor
I steal your hand and ask you
If you really have to go
Yeah, its true, now we just met
But there's so much I want to know
I wanna know where you grew up
I wanna know your middle name
I wanna hear your favorite love song
I wanna know if its the same
As what i heard when i first saw you
When you were staring back at me
But I was so lost in your eyes I couldn't find the air to breathe
I don't know how to else to say this so I don't sound crazy
So tell me everything, about anything
Don't wanna miss a word you say so, just take it slow
Just let it go, cuz I wanna know
Baby tell me so
I wanna know what gets you worked up, what makes you wonder why
Wanna know about your first kiss, was it just as bad as mine?
And all the things that make your face turn red, don't be afraid to say
Tell me all your deepest secrets, I won't let them get away
Wanna know about your first love, did she ever made you cry?
Did she run away with your heart, was it you that said goodbye?
Was she easy getting getting over? Does she fill your memories?
Was she worth it in the end, was she anything like me?
I may be making a mistake, but baby make it with me
So tell me everything, about anything
Even if it hurts to say so, just say it slow
Keep letting go, cuz I wanna know
Baby tell me so
In a few years from now if we ever settle down
We'll look back on all the things we done
Tell me all your favourite parts, and we'll do them over one by one
So tell me everything, about anything
Cuz I can't wait to start it over
Baby, let's go, just want to show that I wanna know
Baby tell me so
