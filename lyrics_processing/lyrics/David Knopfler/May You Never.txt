May you never make your bed out in the cold
You're just like a great strong brother of mine and you know that I love you true
You never talk dirty behind my back and I know there's those that would
So please, won't you please, won't you bear it in mind
Love is a lesson learned in our time
Please, won't you please, won't you bear it in mind for me
May you never lay your head down without a hand to hold
May you never make your bed out in the cold
You're just like a big close sister of mine, you know that I love you true
You've never pulled a blade behind my back and I know there's those that do
So please, won't you please, won't you bear it in mind
Love is a lesson learned in our time
Please, won't you please, won't you bear it mind for me
May you never lose your temper if you get in a barroom fight
May you never lose your woman overnight
You're just like a great strong brother of mine and you know that I love you true
You're never badmouthin' me behind my back and I know there's those that would
So please, won't you please, won't you bear it in mind
Love is a lesson learned in our time
