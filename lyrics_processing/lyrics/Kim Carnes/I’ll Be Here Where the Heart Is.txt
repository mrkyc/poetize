It's the song that just keeps playing on the radio
And you know I haven't seen you for a while
I lie awake at night and wonder how you are
And I wish that I could see you again

Is it fate or is it luck that brings us back?
Or is it just a common point of view?
Time has put a spell on you, you never seem to change
I wish that I could see you again

I'll be here where the heart is
When the dreams that we've been after all come true
You will find me here where the heart is
I'll wait for you, I'll wait for you

It's the light that just keeps shining day after day
When other loves have come and gone
I'll be here with open arms to take you in
I wish that I could see you again

But I'll be here where the heart is
When the dreams that we've been after all come true
You will find me here where the heart is
I'll wait for you, I'll wait for you
You might also like
And in between
And when I need to see you again
All I have to do is close my eyes
Oh, the picture's coming in, my friend
I'll hold you again, but until then

I'll be here where the heart is
When the dreams that we've been after all come true
You will find me here where the heart is
I'll wait for you, I'll wait for you
I will still be here where the heart is
When the dreams that we've been after all come true
You will find me here where the heart is
I'll wait for you, I'll wait for you
I will still be here where the heart is
When the dreams that we've been after all come true
You will find me here where the heart is
