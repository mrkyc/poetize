Invitation to romance
Invitation to dance
Invitation to dance
House lights down
My heart is the only sound
Spotlight, music begins and
That feeling takes me again
I close my eyes
Head over heels
You look my way
Whisper to me, come closer
Leaning on your shoulder (shoulder)
Loving the beholder, darling
Invitation to dance
(Give me an) invitation to romance
Invitation to dance
(I need an) invitation to dance
I'm lost in the song
I've been waiting here
For dreams too long
You might also likeOn the street, in my mind
Seeing the picture
Stopping the time
You tip your hat and then
I wave my heart goodbye
Given the wings I fly
To be there on your
Shoulder (shoulder)
Loving the beholder, darling
Invitation to dance
(I need an) invitation to romance
Invitation to dance

Hot on the rhythm
Hot on the floor
That's where the magic begins
You don't need a reason
Give in to the beat
And go with the motion again
