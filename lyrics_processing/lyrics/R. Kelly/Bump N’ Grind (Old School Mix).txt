You know I can't see nothing wrong
With a little bump n' grind, baby
You know I can't see nothing wrong
With a little bump n' grind, baby

(I don't see nothing wrong)
You know I can't see nothing wrong
With a little bump n' grind, baby
(I don't see nothing wrong)
You know I can't see nothing wrong
With a little bump n' grind, baby

Sit down on the couch, take your shoes off
Let me rub your body before I tear it off
The honey lover man is ready to flex
Girl, flex, time to have sex
We'll start right here and work our way around
I won't stop until I hear the "ooh ah" sound
Don't front you know about the rodeo show
So show me some ID be-fore I get knee deep in-to you
I don't see

(I don't see nothing wrong)
You know I can't see nothing wrong
With a little bump n' grind, baby
(I don't see nothing wrong)
You know I can't see nothing wrong
With a little bump n' grind, baby
(I don't see nothing wrong)
You know I can't see nothing wrong
With a little bump n' grind, baby
(I don't see nothing wrong)
You know I can't see nothing wrong
With a little bump n' grind, baby
You might also like
This is going on 'til the early morn'
And my word is bond, so baby, flex the thongs
I got what you want, you got what I need
Homie lover friends is all I wanna be
It's the pretty round brown driving me wild
Ooh child, things are gonna get a little freakier
And I will have you singing like a mockingbird ... word
Don't front you know ... about the rodeo show
So show me some ID be-fore I get knee deep in-to you
I don't see, yeah

(I don't see nothing wrong)
You know I can't see nothing wrong
With a little bump n' grind, baby
(I don't see nothing wrong)
You know I can't see nothing wrong
With a little bump n' grind, baby
(I don't see nothing wrong)
You know I can't see nothing wrong
With a little bump n' grind, baby
(I don't see nothing wrong)
You know I can't see nothing wrong
With a little bump n' grind, baby
Ah yeah, break it down, ha
This is the remix on the wild tip comin' at ya for the '94
Check it out
Baby, turn the lights off
I'm gonna set it off
Driving you out of your mind
With a little bump n' grind

(I don't see nothing wrong)
You know I can't see nothing wrong
With a little bump n' grind, baby
(I don't see nothing wrong)
You know I can't see nothing wrong
With a little bump n' grind, baby
(I don't see nothing wrong)
You know I can't see nothing wrong
With a little bump n' grind, baby
(I don't see nothing wrong)
You know I can't see nothing wrong
With a little bump n' grind, baby
(I don't see nothing wrong)
You know I can't see nothing wrong
