Now I'm dashing home
Doing 85
Swerving lane to lane, with fire in my eyes
I got a million thoughts
Going through my mind
I'm thinking about what I'ma do
And who I'm gonna do it to when I get home
How could I have been so blind?
And then I look in my rear view
I cannot believe this
(Whoo whoo whoo)
Damn, here comes a policeman
He drove right up on me and flashed his lights
Then I pulled over without thinking twice
He hops out the car and walked over to me
And said, "License and registration please."
I looked up at him and said
"Officer, is there something wrong?"
He said, "No, except you were doing 60 in a 40 mile zone"
Then I said, "Officer
Let me explain please
You see the truth of the matter is
Is that I got an emergency."
He said, "No excuses and no exception."
He flicks his cigarette as he gave me the ticket
Said, "Have a nice day.", and walked away
I said, "Yeah right.", and drove away
Then I turned my radio on
And did 55 all the way home
I pulled up in the driveway
Hopped out and slammed the car door
Then go in through the back
Bust up in the house
Pull back the shower door
And she screaming, "What's all that for?"
Then I'm like, "Woman I called this house
And a man picked up my phone"
Then she said, "Calm down
Did you forget my brother 'Twan came home"
"Oh..."
And that's all I could say was "oh"
With a stupid look on my face
Said, "I forgot he came home today."
And she said, "That's okay
Because honey I understand"
She said "you don't have to explain."
Then I took her by the hand
I kissed her and then we went to the room
Then I turned some music on
Apologized one more time
Then went down and start getting it on
And she started biting her lip
Grabbing me and making noise
Now we making love and she's in my ear whispering
"It's all yours."
I said, "I love you."
And she said, "I love you, too."
Then a tear fell up out my eye
And then I called her my sunshine
And then she looked at me
And said, "Baby go deeper please."
And that's when I start goin' crazy
Like I was tryin' to give her a baby
The room feel like it's spinning
'Cause we keep turning and turning
As if we were in a whirlwind
The way our toes are curling
The next thing ya know, she starts going real wild
And starts screaming my name
Then I said, "Baby, we must slow down
Before I bust a vessel in my brain."
And she said, "Please no don't stop."
And I said, "I caught a cramp."
Then she said, "Please keep on going."
I said, "My leg is about to crack."
Then she cries out
"Oh my goodness, I'm about to climax."
And I said, "Cool, climax
Just let go of my leg!"
She says, "You're the perfect lover."
I said, "I can't go no further."
Then I flip back the cover
