Baby, I have something that I want to ask you (Baby)
So sit back and listen...

Hey Miss Beloved, we are gathered here
To join each other hand and hand
No more playing house, no
'Cause I want to make it real, do you understand?
To have and to hold (mmm-hmm), until death do us part
No one, no one could ever interrupt the beats of our heart
'Cause this is gonna last...

Forever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever
This is gonna last forever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever

Now, there's no one here to speak out
And interrupt this ceremony, ah baby, yeah (baby, just say)
All you got to do is say (you love me)
Say that you love me and we will walk
(And we will walk down the aisle, watching the people smile
Flowers are everywhere, nothing else can compare)
Yeah, girl, you got the kind of love that makes a man like me
Want to settle down, a picket fence and a house, yeah
You might also like
Forever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever
Forever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever...

Girl, I'm down on my knees
So what's it gonna be, what's it gonna be, what's it gonna be
(Talk to me, baby) what's it gonna be, what's it gonna be, what's it gonna be
(2 words, yeah) What's it gonna be, what's gonna be
Baby, you and me; baby, you and me; baby, you and me
(And it's you and me) Baby, you and me
Oh oh, oh oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Forever, baby; you and me, baby
I will be your man, you will be my lady
We'll walk hand in hand, side by side
I will be the perfect groom, you, the perfect bride
Would you just think about it, baby? Think about it, baby
You and me will be together, girl
Rain, sleet, snow, no matter what the weather
Just think about it, baby; think about it, girl
We'll be making love for eternity, raise a family, girl
I'm on my knees saying (marry me) Marry me
(Marry me) 'Cause I love you, baby
(Marry me) There's no other, baby
(Marry me) For you, baby
(Marry me) Said a picket fence
(Marry me) A dog and a house
(Marry me) About 12 kids
You cooking me breakfast in the morning and I'm taking the garbage out (marry me)
Marry me, marry me, marry me, marry me, (hey) marry me, marry me, marry me, marry me...
