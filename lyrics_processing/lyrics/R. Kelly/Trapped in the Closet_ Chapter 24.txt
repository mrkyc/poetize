"Now that's what I'm talkin' about, looks like your boy Twan is about to get paid"
"Nigga go head-on"
"Tell 'em, Sylvester, that shit was furious"
"Nigga, you see this razor to my head? You better back up, it ain't that serious"
"Oh my bad"
"Now man, sit down, T"
"And talk to me, what was that shit you was sayin' to me about a mysterious phone call?"
While Twan sits down in the chair, and gives Sylvester what he calls the script
Let's take it out to the streets where Pimp Lucius is with his hoes, on the strip
"H-huddle, I say, bi-bi-bi-bi"
"Bitches, huddle"
"Listen to me now"
"Somebody grab Nocea, and turn her ass around"
"Now, Pimp Lucius is at a loss. And somebody gotta pay the cost"
"One of you bitches been comin' up sh-sh-short"
"A-a-and I ain't no dummy"
"Bitch better have my m-m-m-m-m"
"Shit, y'all know what I'm sayin'"
"Y'all gon' m-m-m-m-m-mess around and make me slap your ass like I did Tina"
"And I ain't playin'"
"Somebody better talk to me"

Where the game is over and Twan done won, and it looks like he done won a lot
"Well my man, how much is it gon' be?"
"Hol' up Sylvester, you ain't gotta pay for nothin', G"
"Mm"
