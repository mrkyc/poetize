I just started laughin'
Shaking my head
And just kept on laughin'
Thinking about all the things I had been through that day
Then she cries, "What? Why do you have that smile upon your face?"
Then I laughed out said, "Thinking about the things that I've been through"
She wipes her nose and she sniggles and laughs out, "I've been through it too"
Then I start laughing again
And she start laughing more
Then next thing you know we both are
Cracking up on the floor
And she laughs out, "I can't believe this idiot really answered my phone"
Now meanwhile 'Twan just got out of prison and he's on his way home
Then she laughs, "Baby I'm sorry for all the lies and all the bullshit"
Then I say girl, "Just wait till I tell you all the drama that I've been dealing wit'"
She laughs, "I wanna hear it all"
Then I laugh and say, "Baby first of all
I got a hangover, been trapped in the closet, slept wit who knows, threatened to kill a pastor"
She says, "What?"
"Baby this is no lie, he had a lover, turns out to be a gay guy"
She says, "Damn you've been through a lot of shit"
"Plus I got a ticket"
Meanwhile the policeman he turns around
Just out of concern comes back to the house
Then he pulls up in the driveway
My car's parked crooked with the lights on
Then he goes around the back way
He hear the dogs barking like something's wrong
He gets to the backdoor and discover it's been broken in
He looks around, pulls his gun out, then proceeds in
Meanwhile we're laughing and laughing and laughing
But from his perspective he thinks somebody's crying
He gets closer to the bedroom and he would swear that somebody was coughing and sighing
Meanwhile we're in the bedroom laughing as I'm trying to continue to explain
She yells out, "Sylvester, you're killing me"
I said, "I swear that it went that way"
Then next thing you know, he bust up in the room said, "Muthafucka freeze!"
And then I looked back up at him and said, "Wait, you're that damn police!"
Then she screams, "Baby, I mean James." She says, "Everything is cool"
And then he yells, "Gwendolyn, I got this
I know you're sick and tired of this fool!"
Then I stood up, start walking toward him screaming, "Man, get out my house!"
Then he yells, "Freeze!" She screams, "Please!" And I pulled my Beretta out
She cried out "Sylvester, please don't!"
Visions of him making love to her
He said, "Man, put the gun on the floor"
I can't stop thinking about him and her
I slowly put the gun down and then I put my hands up
He winked at me and smiled
And that is when I went nuts
Hopped all over him grabbed the gun
She screaming, "Settle down!"
