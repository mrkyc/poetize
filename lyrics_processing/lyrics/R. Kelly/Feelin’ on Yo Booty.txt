This is my song for real, no doubt (oh)
Said the DJ's making me feel thugged out
(Feeling thugged out here)
As I walk you to the dance floor (oh)
We begin to dance slow (yeah)
Put your arms around me
I'm feeling on your booty

Hey pretty mama, how you doing?
Said I'm just in town for the weekend
Looking for a little trouble to get into
Baby, tell me what you're drinking
And I got you, ooh

Playas wanna play
Ballers wanna ball (oh yeah)
Rollers wanna roll
But I'm taking off after I dance, oh yeah

This is my song for real, no doubt
Said the DJ's making me feel thugged out
(I'm feeling thugged out, oh yeah)
As I walk you to the dance floor
We begin to dance slow
Put your arms around me
I'm feeling on your booty (this is my song, oh)
This is my song for real, no doubt
Said the DJ's making me feel thugged out
(Feeling thugged out, yeah)
As I walk you to the dance floor
We begin to dance slow (oh)
Put your arms around me
I'm feeling on your booty

Now you're body's got me feeling like spending
With a back room I could come to live in
And your hair weave's looking kind of purty
The way you back it up on me baby
Lord have mercy

Playas wanna play (um)
Ballers wanna ball (ballers wanna ball)
Rollers wanna roll
But I'm taking off after I dance, oh yeah

As I walk you to the dance floor (dance floor)
We begin to dance slow (we'll dance)
Put your arms around me (oh yeah)
I'm feeling on your booty
If it's your birthday
Then put your hands up
You wanna get drunk
Then put your hands up
And if you got some cash
Then put your hands up
Have your own job
Put your hands up

Ballers wanna ball (ballers wanna ball)
Rollers wanna roll
Feels so good, say it again
Playas wanna play
Ballers wanna ball
Rollers wanna roll
But I'm taking off after I dance, oh yeah
