I'm just bein' real, you know
I'm like the sun, I'm tryin' to shine on everybody
You know what I'm sayin'
But it's like situation after situation, you know
So I write about it to get it off my chest, you heard

Dear mama, you wouldn't believe what I'm goin' through
But still I got my head up just like I promised you
Ever since you left, your baby boy's been dealin' with
Problem after problem, tell me, what am I supposed to do?
See, I get lost sometimes, don't understand this place
Look in the mirror sometimes and see a troubled face
And then my tears roll down and hit the sink
Then I hold my head up high
I hope the Man upstairs can hear my cry
All these questions deep inside my mind
Like, if Jesus loved me, why He leave my side, mama?
I'm still tryin' to get the answer why
You were young, 45, and you had to die
I'm always tryin' to help people out
And it's them same people tryin' to take food out my mouth
(For real tho') It seems like the more money I make
(For real tho') The more drama y'all try to create
(For real tho') And through I try to move into the positive
(For real tho') The more y'all don't wanna let me live
When will you realize that I don't owe you nothin'
Need to get up off your butt and go get your own somethin'
I'm pullin' on my hair to keep from snappin' off
Fools ride up in my camp and be yappin' off
Somebody out there please pray on what I'm talkin' 'bout
Still young tryin' to figure it out
You might also like
Heaven, I need a hug
Is there anybody out there willin' to embrace a thug?
Feelin' like a change of heart
And all I really need is a sign or a word from God
So shower down on me, wet me with your love
I need you to take me, and lift me up, oh yeah

I gave 13 years of my life to this industry
Hit song or not, I've given all of me
You smile in my face and tell me that you love
But then before you know the truth, you're so quick to judge me
That's alright, go ahead, keep talkin' ('Cause...)
'Cause I'ma hold my head up high and keep walkin'
And reach for the sky, focus on the plan
Rescue the ghetto with his paper and pen
And this is for the homies that we lost
Yo, we cannot forget y'all, so the hats come off
We pour a little liquor out for the memories
I know y'all up there sittin' on chrome in them pearly streets
The street survivors, be careful, stay alive
I'm prayin' for your families, I hope you pray for mine
(For real tho') Used to be a time you wished me well
(For real tho') It hurts to know you wanna see me fail
(For real tho') And don't forget I kept you out of jail
(For real tho') Where's my arms when you needed to be held
They turned they backs on you, who was there believin'?
Who said your troubles were only for a season?
In church together tryin' to pick up all the pieces
And now you betray me, I bind you in the name of Jesus
Somebody please pray on what I'm talkin' 'bout
Still young tryin' to figure it all out
Heaven, I need a hug
Is there anybody out there willin' to embrace a thug?
Feelin' like a change of heart
And all I really need is a sign or a word from God
(Please shower down)
So shower down on me, wet me with your love (Yeah)
I need you to take me, and lift me up (Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Man, I tell you it's enough to make you wanna give it up
Thank God for my fans 'cause through it all they show me love
To my sister and two brothers
Tell me why can't we just try to get along with one another?
Instead of hurtin' one another, fightin' one another
Man, I pray to God He get my family back together
Let me see what wanna I see, just to blind me
All of these luxuries, wine and dine and me
And then You push me out in front to get behind me
Then You sat me up by blessin' me to bind me
I'm a grown man with kids now, stakes are higher
Gotta go to church now to avoid the fire
Frankly, y'all, to keep it real, I'm just tired
Dreams of bein' dead, but the devil is a liar
(For real tho') Church folks, you need to stop judgin'
(For real tho') Or you will be the first to be judged
(For real tho') And women stop dependin' on us men
(For real tho') And start dependin' on the Man above, feel me
And as for Robert, here's what I need to do
Get rid of them clowns and get myself a whole 'nother crew
And media, do your job
But please just don't make my job so hard
Somebody please pray on what I'm talkin' 'bout
I'm still young tryin' to figure it all out
Heaven, I need a hug
Is there anybody out there willin' to embrace a thug?
(Embrace me)
Feelin' like a change of heart
And all I really need is a sign or a word from God
So shower down on me, wet me with your love
(Shower down on me now)
I need you to take me (Please) and lift me up, yeah, yeah
(Said I'm callin' on...)
Heaven, I need a hug
Is there anybody out there willin' to embrace a thug?
(Embrace me, yeah)
Feelin' like a change of heart
And all I really need is a sign or a word from God
So shower down on me, wet me with your love
I need you to take me, and lift me up (Lift me up)
Yeah, yeah (Heaven, I need)
Heaven, I need a hug (Ooh, yeah, yeah)
Is there anybody out there willin' to embrace a thug?
Said I'm feelin' like a change of heart (Hey)
And all I really need is a sign or a word from God (Ooh, yeah)
So shower down on me, wet me with your love
