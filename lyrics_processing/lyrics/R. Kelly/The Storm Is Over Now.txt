I was in a tunnel
And couldn't see the light
And whenever I'd look up
I couldn't see the sky
Sometimes when I'm standing
It seems like I done walked for miles
And my heart could be crying
Dead in the middle of a smile

But then I climbed the hills
And saw the mountains
I hollered help 'cause I was lost
Then I felt the strong wind
Heard a small voice saying

The storm is over
(The storm is over now)
And I can see the sunshine
(Somewhere beyond the clouds)
I feel Heaven, yeah
(Heaven is over me)
Come on and set me free, whoa
You might also like
Now in the midst of my battle
All hope was gone
Downtown in a rushed crowd
And felt all alone
And every now and then
I felt like I would lose my mind
I've been racing for years
And still no finish line, oh

But then I climbed the hills
And saw the mountains (mountains)
I hollered help 'cause I was lost
Then I felt the strong wind
And then a small voice saying

The storm is over
(The storm is over now)
And I can see the sunshine
(Somewhere beyond the clouds)
I can feel Heaven, yeah
(Heaven is over me)
Come on and set me free
Somehow my beginning stepped right in (right in)
Then faith became my friend (my friend)
And now I can depend
On the voices of the wind
When it's saying (saying)

The storm is over
(The storm is over now)
And I can see the sunshine
(Somewhere beyond the clouds)
I can feel Heaven, yeah
(Heaven is over me)
Won't you come and set me free
Won't you set me free
The storm is over
(The storm is over now)
And I can see the sunshine
(Somewhere beyond the clouds)
I can feel Heaven, yeah
(Heaven is over me)
Won't you come and set me free

(Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)
Won't you come and set me free
(Just like, if that guy can see the light, shine it!)
Somewhere beyond the clouds
(If that guy can see the light, shine it!)
Take it down, down
(If that guy can see the light, shine it!)
The clouds moving, the sun shining
(If that guy can see the light, shine it!)
I made it home, the rainbow, the pot of gold
(The storm is over now)
I tell ya I could see the light
(Somewhere beyond the clouds)
I can feel Heaven over me
(Heaven is over me)
Come and set me free...
(Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)
Come and set me free
