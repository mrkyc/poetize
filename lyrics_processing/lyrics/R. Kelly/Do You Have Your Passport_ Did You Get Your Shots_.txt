Uh
Let's settle down for a second so I can talk to y'all for a second
I got a problem
The day before I got on the plane to come out here
Me and my girl broke up
Yeah, we broke up
And it was over something really really silly
Something we shouldn't have broken up over
But it is, it is what it is
We broke up, and here I am in Ethiopia tonight
Question:
Is there anybody out there single?
That broke up with they man and they looking for somebody else right now?
You gotta be single
You gotta be single
Single ladies put your hands in the air right now so I can see you
It's so many, I'm confused
Single ladies, single ladies
Now I would like to get to know you and
Talk to you and have a drink or something and we can just have something to eat and just
But at the end of the conversation
At the end of the conversation I'm gonna want you to come back to America with me
I know I am
So you gotta be willing to split the difference
Come to America and see me, I come out here to see you in Ethiopia
But it's so hard to get back and forth
So hard to get back and forth, that's the problem:
How am I gonna get you from Ethiopia to America?
Let me think, let me think
I got it:
Do you have your passport? Did you get your shots?
Girl, would you like to come back with Rob to America? America?
Do you have your passport? Did you get your shots?
Girl, would you like to come back with Rob to America? America? America, the beautiful?
To America, America, America, America
Do you have your passport? Did you get your shots?
Who wants to come back with I to America?
To America, America, America, America
To America
America, America, America, America
