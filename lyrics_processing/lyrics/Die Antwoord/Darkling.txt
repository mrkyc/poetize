Just a little baby girl, didn't ask to get born into this crazy world
Sometimes I get sad because I didn't even know who my daddy was
My mommy held me tight, rocked me side to side as she sang a lullaby
Then my mommy cried and my mommy said goodbye
She brought me into this life, but I don't know why
Mommy didn't want me, mommy didn't want me

Just a little baby girl, didn't ask to get born into this crazy world
Sometimes I get sad because I didn't even know who my mommy was
Maybe I was born bad, maybe I need help
'Cause sometimes I get sad and I wanna kill myself
But when I sing my momma's lullaby, I don't wanna die, but I don't know why, why
Mommy didn't want me

Toemaar, toemaar baba, moenie huil nie
Mamma moet nou weggaan, maar moenie worry nie
Al is jy arm, of al is jy ryk
Die Here sal vir ewig en altyd na jou kyk
Toemaar, toemaar baba, moenie huil nie
Mamma moet nou weggaan, maar moenie worry nie
Al is jy arm, of al is jy ryk
Die Here sal vir ewig en altyd na jou kyk
