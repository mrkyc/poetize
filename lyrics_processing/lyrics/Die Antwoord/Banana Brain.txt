Baby girl, you so fine
So so fine, you blow my mind
Look at you, coochie coo
Juicy, tushy, gushy goo
Booby one, booby two
Bouncin' like a Looney Tune
Booty boomin', cookie juice
Gushin' out your coochie boo
You're so cute, like Pikachu
Ain't no one so sweet like you
I was sad, then you sneaked into
My lonely heart like peek-a-boo
Now every time I think of you not by my side I dry my eye
Just wanna sing lullabies to my little butterfly
