Jealous of us because, we're better than you

He was the wrong ninja to fuck wif!

Yo, I am the Ninja in charge over here (Wat?)
No fear when I scope a rhyme in your ear (Fuck)
With the wrong Ninja this time, what's the matter, you
Should've known better to fuck with a Ninja with a attitude
I wasn't mad at you but now you're mad at me and jealous
Little stunk poofy rappers like Anthony and Dennis
Lemme help to make you famous
Jesus, but you rap kak
When you rap you actually sound like you're having a fat kak (Yoo)
Sies!
Why you so obsessed with me? Oh-oh woah-ooh
Jesus Christ, you should see how these boys stalk me
Follow my every move like a sea-point moffie
Fuck you, and all your arb lyrics
Maak klaar met n spif quote from the licks
Yo, there's not a rapper out there who can touch me
If you don't believe me, run up and try to punch me

Why do I call myself a ninja, you ask me?
Because my style is so motherfuckin' nasty (Is ja!)
Nothing you can say or do can harm me
Ek's kak fuckin' common, jy's n flou fuckin' laanie
Fuck with Die Antwoord, you fuck with the army!

Super Ninja's coming, faster than a bullet
Leaping over buildings, waving at the children
