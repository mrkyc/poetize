Told my daddy I was gonna grow up to be
A superstar rapper making big money, know what I mean girl?
But my daddy told me I was living in a dream world
If I said "Yes dad" I wouldn't have my zef swag
Or fly round the whole fokken world gettin' jet lag
Gettin' bitten by the zef bug is the best drug
If I played it safe, I woulda never made it ever
Now every day in every way I get a little zeffer
No matter what you smoke, you'll never get as high as me
It's like a fat fuck you when these naaiers see
My big billboard up in NYC
Don't you wish your boyfriend was zef like me?
I'm the motherfuckin' greatest, suckers love to hate us
But I make these bitches submissive cause I'm a dominator
I'm mad musical, my rhymes are the tightest
That's why I tap beautiful designer vaginas

Make my dreams come true

Baby I'm an angel, sent from the dark side
Took my brush-cut to the next with peroxide
"Oh my god, that's such a fresh switch!"
Ja, whatever, just don't touch the hair bitch
Everybody's crying saying; "Hip-hops dead"
'til a white South African hip-hop head
Pops up on the scene sayin' "It's not dead!"
I'm here, can I get a fokken aah yeah?
Rappers looking at me like I just crawled out the drain
The underground got me bored out my brain
And this pop-rap bullshit all sound the same
God help you if I call out your name
From the dark side of the moon, I zoom outta the gloom
Doom doom! The room goes boom like a cartoon
The dark ravers has come, my mic-saber is on
Turn and tell your friend; "Yo this is my favourite song!"
