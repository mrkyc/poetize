You drink my whiskey without askin'
You put your boots up on my couch
It drives me crazy to remind you
More than once to take the garbage out
You use my good towels on the dog
And that's the only thing I've asked you not to do
Most days I'd love to lock you out
I can't live without you

The kitchen table ain't for business
I wish you'd put the bills where they go
I guess you'd need an invitation
To the backyard to see that it needs mowed
You'd leave your whiskers in the sink
And I've told you 'til I'm black and blue
You've never worried what our neighbors think
I can't live without you

'Cause you've got my back even when I'm wrong
You're the only one who knows me and my heart can't get along
I got reasons to cry and can't tell you which one
But you don't ask no questions, you just hold me 'til I'm done
And when I'm lookin' to fight, you flat refuse
I can't live without you

You're always voicin' your opinion
You play your guitar way too loud
And, God, I reckon it would kill you
To lift a finger and help me clean this house
You know, your jokes ain't all that funny
But I'll keep on laughin' if you want me to
Nobody understands why I love you
I can't live without you

You've got my back even when I'm wrong
You're the only one who knows me and my heart can't get along
I got some reasons to cry but can't tell you which one
But you don't ask no questions, you just hold me 'til I'm done
And when I'm lookin' to fight, you flat refuse
I can't live without you
