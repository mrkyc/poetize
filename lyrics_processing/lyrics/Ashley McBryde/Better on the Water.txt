Tank top, twist top, flip flops comi'n off
Sunblock, boombox, pick a song, get it on
Sun drop rollin' like Shiner Bock, load it up
Oh styrofoam, solo, keep the food, keep it cold
Fishin' pole, grab a hold of anything that'll float
Let's go, gotta roll, cold beer's heatin' up
Cut-off blue jeans and tan bare feet
Got more butts than we got seats

Hey y'all, let me hear you holler
Yeehaw, take another swallow
This boat ain't gonna rock itself
Let's have more fun than we oughtta
And take this party out a little farther
Keep this buzz floatin', hey hey
Everything's better on the water
Everything's better on the water

Money funday, celebrate a holiday
Every day's a good day, catchin' rays, makin' waves
Let's make this lake party play some belly up
Callin' all redheads, brunettes, blondes with hot friends
Rednecks floatin' that beer on a life vest
Sea-Doo, pontoon, that's cool, tie it up
Anchor down any troubles if you got 'em
Watch that sucker sink straight to the bottom
