I used to roll my cigarettes on the hood of my Tacoma
Sit and watch the world go by
I was seventeen and green, and knowin' nothin' 'bout livin'
In a town where people go to die

And Leroy was a transplant from somewhere in Alabama
The first time I met him, he asked me for a spoon
And I thought he must've been in a bluegrass band, or somethin'
But I'd find out one August afternoon

Three doors down, there's tin foil on the table
And they ain't cookin' up nothin' good 'round here
There's one in every house high on the couch, stealin' cable
On the dark side of the country it ain't bonfires, it ain't beer
But you find out quick how big a hit the neighbor's bike'll get ya, boy
Livin' next to Leroy

In the classroom, Susie Highschool was passin' pills like notes
Takin' shots in the parkin' lot at lunch
And I'd join in every now and then, 'cause you can't beat the cool crowd
I'd go to Leroy's 'til I sobered up

Three doors down, there's tin foil on the table
And they ain't cookin' up nothin' good 'round here
There's one in every house high on the couch, stealin' cable
On the dark side of the country it ain't bonfires, it ain't beer
But you find out quick how big a hit that class ring'll get ya, boy
Livin' next to Leroy

I rolled a J on the day I got my diploma
I knew Leroy would be proud
I can't forget shakin' him, tryin' to wake him on that sofa
He never did come 'round


Yeah, three doors down, there's tin foil on the table
They ain't cookin' up nothin' good 'round here
There's one in every house high on the couch, stealin' cable
On the dark side of the country it ain't bonfires, it ain't beer
But you find out quick how high you get when that last hit gets you, boy
Livin' next to Leroy

Yeah, livin' next to Leroy
Oh, yeah, woah, next to Leroy
