Starin' through a spider web where the windshield used to be
What's left of the dashboard, the smell of gasoline
I can just make out one neon light south off through the trees
My feet took over walkin' 'fore my mind caught up with me
When I walked in my tab was already open
My drink was poured and my cigarette was smokin'

And somebody said, "Hey girl, where you been? Don't ya know I been waitin' for ya?
I've got a band up there been dyin' to play a little 'Devil Went Down to Georgia'
Rest that travelin' soul, looks like the road was long
Welcome to Southern Babylon"

I had to pull myself together and ask to use the phone
The waitress smiled a wicked grin, it sent a chill right to my bone
I said, "I need to call the tow truck, some way to move along"
She said, "Who you wanna call now that you've been called home?"

She said, "Hey girl, where you been? Don't you know I been waitin' for ya?
You got a band up there just dyin' to play a little 'Hotel California'
And maybe it's not sinkin' in, but you'll learn to play along
Honey, you been gone since you walked into Southern Babylon"

"I'm not supposed to be here, bartender, don't you see?
I took a gig down in Atlanta and the brakes gave out on me"
She said, "We know all about ya, it's a little bit too late"
She handed me a guitar and pointed to the flames

"Hey girl, where you been? Don't ya know I been waitin' for ya?
You got a band up there just dyin' to play a little 'Devil Went Down to Georgia'
Rest that travelin' soul, looks like the road was long
Welcome to Southern Babylon"
