A little outside of Elizabethtown
There's a little bar where I'd sit down
And trade a couple country songs for Kentucky Bourbon
A little ol' gal in the middle of the night
Learnin' how to love and learnin' how to fight
And learnin' how to like my brand of hurtin'

Hell, there's hell everywhere I go
I'm just stickin' with the devil I know

Mama says get my ass to church
Daddy says get my ass to work
Doctor says I gotta give up on these smokes
Everybody's got somethin' to say
About how I gotta change my ways
But I got somethin' to say of my own
Hell, there's hell everywhere I go
I'm just stickin' with the devil I know

I love somebody everybody loves
And he's in love with my messed up
Most folks can't see my soul through the smoke
And we're suitcase marks on a hardwood floor
Flippin' the bird, slammin' the door
And peelin' out and turnin' 'round and comin' home

But hell, there's hell everywhere I go
So I'm stickin' with the devil I know

Mama says get my ass to church
Daddy says get my ass to work
Doctor says I gotta give up on these smokes
Everybody's got somethin' to say
About how I gotta change my ways
But I got somethin' to say of my own
There's higher roads than I rode
And better choices than I chose
I'm just stickin' with the devil I know

Hey, hey
Hey, hey, whoa

Mama says get my ass to church
Daddy says get my ass to work
Doctor says I gotta give up on these smokes
Everybody's got somethin' to say
About how I gotta change my ways
But I got somethin' to say of my own
Hell, there's hell everywhere I go
