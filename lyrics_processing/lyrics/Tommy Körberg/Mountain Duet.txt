This is the one situation I wanted most to avoid
Nothing I say will convince him this isn't a trick
THE RUSSIAN
A drink on a clear moonlit night, I relax, she smiles
There's something unpleasant going on
FLORENCE
So with immaculate timing, I'm left to carry the can
Embarrassed, outnumbered, marooned
THE RUSSIAN
Now she can't be working for them - I mean us
She seems so very straightforward
But where is he?
FLORENCE
He has to come back, he wanted this meeting, well didn't he?
THE RUSSIAN
Maybe he's scared, just as scared as he was in the game
FLORENCE
Oh I just couldn't care less
He can go right ahead, go and wreck his career
I know I've done my best

Well, at least she's a good-looking spy
FLORENCE
What if my Russian friend thinks that my plans
Are more of an intimate kind?
If I don't say something and soon
He'll go - nobody's on nobody's side
THE RUSSIAN
Listen, I hate to break up the mood
Get to the point, begin the begin
Haven't you noticed we're a protagonist short
In this idyllic, well-produced scene?
FLORENCE
All I can say is moments ago
He was right here ready and waiting
THE RUSSIAN
Never mind him, I haven't missed him so far
BOTH
Maybe it won't do any harm
To struggle on without his charm?
Funny how all at once I feel
That he can go jump off the mountain I won't care
FLORENCE
This is the one situation I wanted most to avoid
THE RUSSIAN
My dear opponent, I really can't imagine why
FLORENCE
So I am not dangerous then?
What a shame!
THE RUSSIAN
Oh you're not dangerous
Who could think that of you?
BOTH
You - you are so strange
Why can't you be what you ought to be?
You should be scheming, intriguing, too clever by half
THE RUSSIAN
I have to hand it to you
For you've managed to make me forget why I ever agreed to this farce
BOTH
I don't know why I can't think of anything
I would rather do
Than be wasting my time
