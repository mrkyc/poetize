I remember years ago
Someone told me I should take
Caution when it comes to love
I did, I did
And you were strong and I was not
My illusion, my mistake
I was careless, I forgot
I did

And now
When all is done, there is nothin' to say
You have gone and so effortlessly
You have won, you can go ahead, tell them

Tell them all I know now
Shout it from the rooftops
Write it on the skyline
All we had is gone now
Tell them I was happy
And my heart is broken
All my scars are open
Tell them what I hoped would be
Impossible, impossible
Impossible, impossible

Fallin' out of love is hard
Falling for betrayal is worse
Broken trust and broken hearts
I know, I know
Thinking all you need is there
Buildin' faith on love and words
Empty promises will wear
I know, I know

And now
When all is gone, there is nothin' to say
And if you're done with embarrassin' me
On your own, you can go ahead, tell them

Tell them all I know now
Shout it from the rooftops
Write it on the skyline
All we had is gone now
Tell them I was happy
And my heart is broken
All my scars are open
Tell them what I hoped would be
Impossible, impossible
Impossible, impossible (Let me tell you now)
Impossible, impossible
Impossible, impossible
Ooh, la-la-la (Ooh, impossible)
La-la-la
La-la-la (Yeah, yeah)
I remember years ago
Someone told me I should take
Caution when it comes to love

Tell them all I know now (Yeah)
Shout it from the rooftops (Shout it from the rooftops)
Write it on the skyline
All we had is gone now (Hey)
Tell them I was happy (Tell them I was happy)
And my heart is broken (And my heart is broken)
All my scars are open
Tell them what I hoped would be (Whoa)
Impossible, impossible (Impossible, impossible)
Impossible, impossible (Let me tell you now)
Impossible, impossible (Hey, let me tell you now)
Impossible, impossible
