G'yeah, now that's some of that real gangsta shit (Yes)
Comin' from an original nigga from the Compton streets
MC Eiht's in the mothafuckin house, G'yeah
And right about now, Half Ounce in the motherfuckin' house, G'yeah (He's dope, huh)
MC Eiht, DJ Slip
My niggas on the run (Aw shit)
Little Hawk and Bird (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
G'yeah (Put that shit down)

One more nigga on the run
I just can't handle this, born in the land of the scandalous
Thirteen years of age at the time
Moms ain't kickin' in, I gots to get mine
I loads up my strap, map out my plan
Choose my victim, then mothafuckin' stick him
One more point that got scored for the hood
Up to no damn good, understood?
Snaps is getting low so I gots to get some mo'
Loads up the K, break out the back do'
You know the routine, so punk fool, here we go
Same bat channel, keep your mothafuckin' hands up on the dash
And gives up the cash
One times is making a move on my ass (G'yeah)
But I ain't sweating it because ain't shit funny
Because it's All For The Money

G'yeah
I gots to get mine, so I'ma take yours
I gots to get mine, so I'ma take yours
G'yeah, G'yeah, G'yeah

Just call me the come up kid, G
Hard times kicking it in the C-P-T
So that means I gotta do what I gotta do
And if you ain't down with The Hype, fuck you
You're coming up short when I'm stomping
So when I hit your corner, you're gonna be a goner
Nigga duck when my nine starts to buck
In it for the snaps so I'm crazy as fuck
I should be laying low cause one time is real hot
Need to make a knot so I rush your spot
And it's like that when I got the feelin'
If you don't kill, somebody else does the killin'
So when you hit the end of the road ain't no turning back
I done signed a hood lifetime contract
Jackin' and packin' cause ain't shit funny
Because it's All For The Money

G'yeah
I gots to get mine, so I'ma take yours
I gots to get mine, so I'ma take yours
G'yeah, G'yeah, G'yeah
Uh oh, there goes another beep on the beeper
One time sleep on the fucking night creeper
Trying to show stop on the sales
Pull fake braids but I still gets paid
Just say no? Fuck the TV
Trying to push the shit cause the weight is exceeded
See me for the blast, Five-oh fly in fast
Mad cause I'm making more cash than they ass
Now I lay low in the cut
Label me the nigga with the fucking gangsta strut
Every hooptie got gold license plates
My birds fly out throughout the fucking states
Now my other half is telling me I'd better quit
But I ain't through in this shit, so I guess this is it
I'll be dead before I go out like a dummy
(Why's that, G?) Because it's All For The Money

Geah, geah
That's how we puttin' down, y'know I sayin'? (Right)
Like I said before, y'know I sayin'?
We comin' wit real Compton gangsta groove
MC Eiht, DJ Slip
My niggas on the run, Little Hawking Bird
G'yeah
I gots to get mine, so I'ma take yours
I gots to get mine, so I'ma take yours
I gots to get mine, so I'ma take yours
I gots to get mine, so I'ma take yours
I gots to get mine, so I'ma take yours
