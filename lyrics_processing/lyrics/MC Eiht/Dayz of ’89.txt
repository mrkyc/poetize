Geah
Some of that thug shit
Hoo-Bangin' Gangsta's in the house
Representin' for the West
Compton one time
Check this out, uh
Geah
Hoo-Bangin' in the house
We gon' do it like this
Compton in the house
For all the thug niggas out there
Life ain't nothin' but money and hot 9's
Crooked hoes, keepin' hid from one... (Check me out)

Somebody help me out the ghetto
Cause there's some things I just can't let go, uh
My mind takes a twirl
Lord, I try to cope with it
But I scream "Fucks the world!"
Young nigga with dreams of schemes
For the cash but then awaken
To the sounds of late night gun blasts (Boo-yah!)
My moms told my ass "Hit the floor!"
Before the hot ones echo through the window
Damn, why the fuck it's my block?
Graffiti lookin' greedy and niggas who slangin' rock
Fo' sho', I wanna be like that, fuck Mike
Unless Mike was on the corner with a strap at night
Gettin' harrassed
By the cops, 'cause he's tryin' to make some dough
So he can push up from a Caddy and dumps the Pinto
So everybody in the hood can cops the yayo
And I can collects the - cash flow

Life ain't nothin' but money and hot 9's
Crooked ho's, keepin' hid from One-Time
You got your strap, uh, I got mine
Takin' you back to the times of '89

Pops sendin' money in lines, from out of state
But too late, I'm on the corner now way past eight
Better be on the look out for dark head lights
Or get caught up, In a twist, a long kiss goodnight
Love the days of gettin' paid, with the Cavi I clock
When I roam the hard knocks, or the court down block
Turnin' tide
Now you bitch niggas - wanna trip
With a year-old Cutlass, and a bank full of grips
Still dips the hood, stay true Is what they tell me
Fuck you bitch-ass niggas, no, the nina never fail me
Lord, forgive me, 'cause sometimes I can't deal
With the pressures from the hood, with the mentality to kill
Protects me and my kids necks, that's real
Jealous-ass bitches, 'cause y'all gots no skrill
Time will reveal
I be damned if I let y'all niggas stop my next meal

Life ain't nothin' but money and hot 9's
Crooked ho's, keepin' hid from One-Time
You got your strap, uh, I got mine
Takin' you back to the times of '89
Now I sits in late nights spots and clock chips
With a bag of chips, eatin', loaded up extra clips
Watch out for the knock at the door
Throw your money through the mail and pick up the damn blow
Quickly now, don't let the po-po show
Or I'm hittin' - to the spot where the moon don't glow
Life's a bitch, uh, life's not a dance
Life's too short for my ass to try to chance
Last place niggas get caught with the fuckin' dollars
Have your ass on G.R. while I dip Impalas
Blue-collar niggas sellin' to white-collar fools
But I don't give a fuck, y'all know cash rules
Pay your dues, stay true to the street
Get your money, man
Fo' sho' packs my heat
Told by the G's that talk is cheap
But y'all know since the days I'm N 2 Deep
C'mon!

Life ain't nothin' but money and hot 9's
Crooked ho's, keepin' hid from One-Time
(Hoo-Bangin' in the house, c'mon)
You got your strap, uh, I got mine
(You know how the fuck we regulatin')
Takin' you back to the times of '89
(For all the thug niggas out there)
Life ain't nothin' but money and hot 9's
(Thug niggas on the block)
Crooked ho's, keepin' hid from One-Time
You got your strap, uh, I got mine

Takin' you back to the times of '89
