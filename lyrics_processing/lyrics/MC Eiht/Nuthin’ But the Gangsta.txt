Geah
We in the mothafuckin' house
Eiht Hype in the mothafuckin' house, geah
1/2 Oz in the mothafuckin' house
My Niggas on the Run in the mothafuckin' house
Lil Hawk n Bird in the mothafuckin' house, geah
And ain't no love in the '94, ho

It makes me want to jack mothafuckas in the fog
Let them hood rat bitches know the true meanin' of a dog
Makes me want to be a nigga, for hire
Let 5-O feel the mothafuckin' fire
Hold my nuts and make my cash
Break this ten and a half off in your ass, uh
Walkin' with the strap and a bad ass rap
You get off first, before your enemy tries to peel your cap (uh-huh)
And bitches can't hang with the pack
Ho's talkin' smack, it makes me smack you right back
Niggas got beef think teens out macked
And since the age of thirteen, I've been packin'
Fool, I slang a gang of twenty bags
Pistol in my pocket makes my khakis sag
Always on the lookout for the helicopter
Blast from the AK fill the fuckin' copper
It's do or die, mothafucka, die!
Niggas from the Compton streets so don't even try, nigga
You get a slug from the stub for offendin' me
Ain't nothin' but the gangsta in me
You might also like
Nothin' but the gangsta, geah
Nothin' but the gangsta, geah
Nothin' but the gangsta, geah
Spice 1 come down

I am a G, yes, I'm only a G
Walks like a G, talks like a G
So A to the mothafuckin' K
It's your one eight seven proof ass nigga from the Bay
Wanna be totin' my gat quick to slap shit, pistol-whip they ass
I'mma do the blastin', Eiht you get the cash and
Dash the fuck out the cut
Fifty bullets up in the next nigga, that's how we runnin' up
I pulls my hat to the back when I slide
When a mothafucka peelin' his cap
Pick out my nine millimeter uzi, barrel chrome, handle plastic
So killamatic, killamatic, killaman, killaman with me Glock
Piggity-pop mothafucka, watch 'em drop, mothafucka
Just a G, comin' up out the Bay with a fat AK
Put it in your face and split your wig, nigga, zag to zig nigga
Disrespect me, I'mma bank ya
'Cause I'm nothin' but a mothafuckin' East Bay Gangsta

Nothin' but the gangsta
Nothin' but the gangsta
Nothin' but the gangsta
Haha, come on, nigga
Check it out
Oh my God! I destroy cities like The Blob
Droppin' trunks of funk and I blast a punk from here to Cape Cod
Fuck a job, my organization runs like the mob
The original Joe Pex Flex
Redman, bitch, you better ask some bod'
Prepare to slam from here to Japan with jams
I'm from the Jersey section, and I keep it real for '94 and
I can't march y'all swap meets, y'all duck sects I dissects
Better pack a nine gat
And the cops - still don't know where mines at
Black, huh, I snatch the Beauty from the Beast
It's the funk deceased nigga comin' through
Bitch, so grab your head piece
I got the gangsta in me, plus, I'm not friendly
To a bitch-ass, whose mouth runs more laps than the Indi's
Now, let me Spice the track up
MC Eiht, pass the bone, so I can get lifted
And a head can get blown when Bronx pass the biscuit
I drop the funk, and drop a body to show I'm serious
The gangsta means I'm live, reppin' from New Jersey, period!

Nothin' but the gangsta
Nothin' but the gangsta
Nothin' but the gangsta
Nothin' but the gangsta
Nothin' but the gangsta (Woo)
Nothin' but the gangsta (Geah)
Nothin' but the gangsta (Nigga)
Nothin' but the gangsta
Hit the weights everyday like Popeye the sailor
Bailin' with my starched up khakis and Chuck Taylors
Just touched down from San Quentin
Hand me that fresh ass Pendleton, uh
It's nothin' but the gang thing
Makes me hit the corner and slang
Board and quarter about a hundred times
Don't be servin' no dubs and dimes
But I do it, no hesitation
Fuck it, I'mma violate probation
No one gave a mad fuck about me
Since the age of eight, I roamed the halls of LB
Pops boned out, never had a big brother
Put on the set when I could pick the right color
The homie put me down on a half a bird
Turned it into key, now they buyin' from me
Rollin' in the Trey on fuckin gold D's
Nothin' but the mothafuckin' gangsta in me (Geah)

Nothin' but the gangsta, geah (That's right)
Nothin' but the gangsta (Come down)

And that's how it's going down (Geah)
That's how it's going down, uh (Geah)
1/2 Oz in the mothafuckin' house
Niggas on the Run, Lil Hawk n Bird
Geah

Nothin' but the gangsta
Nothin' but the gangsta
Nothin' but the gangsta
Nothin' but the gangsta
Woo!
