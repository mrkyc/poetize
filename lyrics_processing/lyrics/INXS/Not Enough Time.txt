Attempting to make sense
Of my aching heart
If I could just be
Everything and everyone to you
This life would just be so easy
Not enough time
For all that I want for you
Not enough time for every kiss
And every touch and all the nights
I wanna be inside you
We will make time stop
For the two of us
Make time stop
And listen for our sighs
Not enough time
For all that I want for you
Not enough time for every kiss
And every touch and all the nights
I wanna be inside you
(Make time stop, make time stop)
In our fight against the end
Making love, we are immortal
We are the last two left on earth

Not enough time for every kiss
Not enough time for all my love
Not enough time for every touch
