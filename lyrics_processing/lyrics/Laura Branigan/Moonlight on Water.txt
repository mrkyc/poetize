What's going on down on the planet?
What's going on inside your pretty head?
What's life without a Mercedes
And the need to feel adrenaline rush?

Is it better than moonlight on water?
Is it better than sex on the beach?
Think about us riding wild horses
Think about us, it's not out of reach

I'm here for you (Moonlight on water)
No matter where you go, no matter what you do
I'm here for you (Moonlight on water)
When there's a lonely night, who can you hold on to?
I'm here for you
Want you in my arms uncomplicated
I am for you, I am

Who's gonna be the competition?
Who's next in line for promotion, baby?
Everyday the real world is fading
Spinning out on the wheel of fortune but

You've been working so hard
Don't you know it, baby?
You don't understand what I want from you
Instead of dreamin' 'bout all that money
We got such simpler things to do

Like moonlight on water
Like sex on the beach
