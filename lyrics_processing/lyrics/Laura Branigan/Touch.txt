There's something that I really got to say
Let me tell you everything that's on my mind
Don't say no, I'll tell you anyway
Sometimes when I see you in a crowded room
I really want to kiss you in the dark
I get the strangest feeling coming over me
Frightening sensations of the heart
I want to run but my feet won't go
I want to move right through the floor
I want to stop but I can't say no
I want to hear you cry for more
Baby, let me touch you
Let me get to know you
Baby, let me touch you tonight
Come a little closer
Let me feel your fingertips
Baby, let me touch you tonight
I've been attracted to you for so long
Seems like I've been waiting all my life
And now there's nothing standing in the way of love
We can find what we both really like
You might also likeI want to stay with you all night long
I want to kiss you on the floor
I want to stop, but I can't say no
I want to hear you cry for more
Baby, let me touch you
Let me get to know you
Baby, let me touch you tonight
Let me get to know you
Let me feel your fingertips
Baby, let me touch you tonight
Tonight
I want to stay with you all night long
I want to see you on the floor
I want to stop, but I can't say no
I want to hear you cry for more
Baby, let me touch you
Let me get to know you
Baby, let me touch you tonight
Baby, let me touch you
Let me feel your fingertips
Baby, let me touch you tonight
Baby, let me touch you
Let me get to know you
Baby, let me touch you tonight
Baby, let me touch you
Let me feel your fingertips
