Here in the night
There's a perfume in the air
And you can almost smell the danger
Pressed in a crowd
You can feel the heat flow
In the touch of every stranger
We're out on the town
And it's action that we're after
Keep fannin' the flame just a little faster

It's gonna be a hot night
We're gonna have a hot night tonight
It's gonna be a hot night
We won't get no sleep tonight
Too hot, it's too hot

The need in your eyes
Hits me to the heart
With a shot of stimulation
Come on with me
In a moment I will see
Such a burning fascination
No stopping it now
We got to stay in motion
We're two-footed fire, two-footed emotion

It's gonna be a hot night
We're gonna have a hot night tonight
It's gonna be a hot night
We won't get no sleep tonight
Too hot, it's too hot
It's gonna be a hot night
We're gonna have a hot night tonight
It's gonna be a hot night
We won't get no sleep tonight
Too hot, it's too hot

No stopping it now
We got to stay in motion
We're two-footed fire, two-footed emotion

It's gonna be a hot night
We're gonna have a hot night tonight
It's gonna be a hot night
We won't get no sleep tonight
Too hot, it's too hot
It's gonna be a hot night
We're gonna have a hot night tonight
It's gonna be a hot night
We won't get no sleep tonight
Too hot, it's too hot
It's gonna be a hot night
We're gonna have a hot night tonight
It's gonna be a hot night
We won't get no sleep tonight
Too hot, it's too hot
It's gonna be a hot night
