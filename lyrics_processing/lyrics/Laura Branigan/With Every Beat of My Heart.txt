As I look out of my window
I see your face in each shadow on the street below me
And as I hear the hard rain falling
I wonder, will you be calling?
Do you still wanna hold me?
I think, will you turn away?
Do you wanna say it's over?
Will you really come?
Was it just for fun, I wonder
Is it easy to see that every time you touch me

With every beat of my heart, there's thunder inside
Every beat of my heart, I need you tonight
Every beat of my heart, I'm reachin' for you
I need you now, with every beat of my heart

As I lay down in this dark room
I hear your voice like a soft tune, echo all around me
And as I feel the cold wind blowing
I wonder, will you be showing
Or forget you ever found me?
I think, will you turn away?
Do you wanna say it's over?
Will you really come?
Was it just for fun, I wonder
Is it easy to see that every time you touch me
You might also like
With every beat of my heart, there's thunder inside
Every beat of my heart, I need you tonight
Every beat of my heart, I'm reachin' for you
I need you now, with every beat of my heart


With every beat of my heart, there's thunder inside
Every beat of my heart, I need you tonight
Every beat of my heart, I'm reachin' for you
I need you now, with every beat of my heart
With every beat of my heart
With every beat of my heart
Every beat of my heart, oh
Every beat of my heart
Every beat of my heart
Deep inside of me something's died
Every beat of my heart
Every beat of my heart
Every beat of my heart
