I say now, let's play a game
I betcha I can make a rhyme out of anybody's name
The first letter of the name
I treat it like it wasn't there
But a 'B' or an 'F' or an 'M' will appear
And then I say "Bo", add a 'B'
Then I say the name, then "Banana-Fanna" and a "Fo"
And then I say the name again, with an 'F' very plain
Then a "Fee-Fi" and a "Mo"
And then I say the name again, with an 'M' this time
And there isn't any name that I can't rhyme
OK, let's do Tony!
Tony, Tony, Bo-Bony, Banana-Fanna, Fo-Fony
Fee-Fi-Mo, Mony, Tony
That was good, let's try Katie!
Katie, Katie, Bo-Batie, Banana-Fanna, Fo-Fatie
Fee-Fi-Mo, Matie, Katie
But if the first two letters are ever the same
You drop them both, then say the name
Like Bob, Bob, drop the 'B's', Bo-Bob
Or Hugh, Hugh, drop the 'H', go "Ooh"
Mary, Mary, drop the 'M', Mo-Mary
That's the only rule that is contrary
You might also likeOK everybody, now say Bo (Bo!)
Now Tony with a B (Bony!)
Now Banana-Fanna-Fo (Banana-Fanna-Fo!)
Then you say the name again with an 'F' very plain (Fony!)
Then a Fee-Fi and a Mo (Fee-Fi and Mo!)
Then you say the name again with an 'M' this time (Mony!)
And there isn't any name that I can't rhyme
Let's do Doug!
Doug, Doug, Bo-Boug, Banana-Fanna, Fo-Foug
Fee-Fi-Mo, Moug, Doug
Now you got it! Joanie!
Joanie, Joanie, Bo-Boanie, Banana-Fanna, Fo-Foanie
Fee-Fi-Mo, Moanie, Joanie
A little trick with Rick!
Rick, Rick, Bo-Bick, Banana-Fanna, Fo-Fick
Fee-Fi-Mo, Mick
But if the first two letters are ever the same
You drop them both, then say the name
Like Bob, Bob, drop the 'B's', Bo-Bob
Or Hugh, Hugh, drop the 'H', go "Ooh"
Mary, Mary, drop the 'M', Mo-Mary
That's the only rule that is contrary
OK everybody, let's try David!
David, David, Bo-Bavid, Banana-Fanna, Fo-Favid
Fee-Fi-Mo, Mavid, David
That was great, try Larry!
Larry, Larry, Bo-Barry, Banana-Fanna, Fo-Farry
