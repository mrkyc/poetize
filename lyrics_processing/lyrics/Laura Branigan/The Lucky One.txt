You can break away or you can stay
You choose your life, you're free to fly
Go on and fly
Go on and fly

She had it in her all the time
To get away and try to find
Somewhere to go, to run
She saw the world through open eyes
And never let a soul inside
Don't come too close, so close

Baby thinks she's smart
But what about her heart?

Like a wild bird of prey
Like a thief in the night
You can take what you want
And you don't think twice
'Cause the world's in your hands
You got all you want
And you won't change a thing
You're the lucky one
You might also like
Oh, the lucky one
Oh, the lucky one

Her soul was strong
Her heart was tough
And when she felt she had enough
She tore herself away
Love in the dark is all you see
Get what you want, not what you need
You look the other way

Never letting on
To what it's all become

Like a wild bird of prey
Like a thief in the night
You can take what you want
And you don't think twice
'Cause the world's in your hands
And you've got all you want
And you won't change a thing
You're the lucky one
Oh, the lucky one
Oh, the lucky one

(Life is a dream)
(The lucky one, the lucky one, the lucky one)
(Oh, life is a dream, the lucky one)
(Life is a dream)
(The lucky one, the lucky one)

Baby thinks she's smart
But what about her heart?

Like a wild bird of prey
Like a thief in the night
You can take what you want
And you don't think twice
'Cause the world's in your hands
And you've got all you want
And you won't change a thing
You're the lucky one

Oh, the lucky one
Oh, the lucky one
Oh, the lucky one
