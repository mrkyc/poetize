I can't tell you
No one will ever die from a broken heart
But one thing I know since I've loved you
I know that I'm alive

So why do you keep holding back?
Don't run away
From what we have
I would never hurt you, darling

Can't stop the rain
When you hear the thunder
Tonight's the night
We're caught up in the flood
Don't you see?
We were meant for one another
To live and breathe in the spirit of love

Naked alone
What would I be if your love
Had never found me?
One thing that's real
Is only the trust we give to one another
You might also like
So touch me or I'll lose mind
We've waited for the longest time
It's too late to stop now

Can't stop the rain
When you hear the thunder
Tonight's the night
We're caught up in the flood
Don't you see?
We were meant for one another
To live and breathe in the spirit of love
Can't stop the rain
When you hear the thunder
Tonight's the night
We're caught up in the flood
Don't you see?
We were meant for one another
To live and breathe in the spirit of love


Can't stop the rain
When you hear the thunder
Tonight's the night
We're caught up in the flood
Don't you see?
We were meant for one another
To live and breathe in the spirit of love
Can't stop the rain
When you hear the thunder
Tonight's the night
We're caught up in the flood
Don't you see?
We were meant for one another
To live and breathe in the spirit of love
To live and breathe in the spirit of love
To live and breathe in the spirit of love
Can't stop the rain
When you hear the thunder
Tonight's the night
We're caught up in the flood
Don't you see?
We were meant for one another
To live and breathe in the spirit of love
Can't stop the rain
When you hear the thunder
Tonight's the night
We're caught up in the flood
Don't you see?
