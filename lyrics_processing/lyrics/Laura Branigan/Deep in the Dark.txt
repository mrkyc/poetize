Check it out, Joe

I'll tell you a secret if you know where to keep it
And you promise not to tell
Got a tale or two about a girl that you
Could have sworn you knew so well
It was years ago, though it sounds like yesterday
You came on strong and she gave it all away
He had an angel's face, a fighter's grace
And an ace hidden up his sleeve
But never mind 'cause love is blind
And she needed to believe
His touch could fill, he held her safe from harm
If looks could kill, she'd have died there in his arms

(Deep in the dark) Ooh-oh-oh
(The thunder in her heart) Ooh-oh-oh
He told her every single lie
He swore he'd never told anyone before

Now you wake up in the dead of night
And reach out to touch her hair
But the bed is empty, turn on the light
And she's not even there
Then a note she wrote, you read that thing and weep
'Cause if you love someone and never know what runs so deep

(Deep in the dark) Ooh-oh-oh
(The thunder in her heart) Ooh-oh-oh
She told you every single lie
She swore she'd never heard before
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
(Deep in the dark) Ooh-oh-oh
(The thunder in her heart) Ooh-oh-oh
She told you every single lie
She swore she'd never heard before

Two, three, four
(Cha, cha, cha, cha)
(Cha, cha)
(Cha, cha, cha, cha)
(Cha, cha)
