And your eyes have changed
I don't want to hear the words you say
I don't want to know the pain
And I see your lips move
But I can't hear the sound
So I turn my head away
As my heart drops to the ground
And I've tried to see right through you, but it's all in vain
Like a locomotive blinded by the rain
And I swear that you loved me just the other day
I still remember how you used to say
I would die for you, I would live for you
I would fight for the right just to give to you
You can set me free, but you'll come back to me
Didn't we almost win? Didn't we almost win it all?
Time seems to heal wounds
Well, that's what they say
But it doesn't matter now
'Cause I never felt that way
And I see your lips move
But I can't hear the sound
So I turn my head away
As my heart drops to the ground

And I swear that you loved me just the other day
I still remember how you used to say
I would die for you, I would live for you
I would fight for the right just to give to you
You can set me free, but you'll come back to me
Didn't we almost win? Didn't we almost win it all?
I could swear that you loved me just the other day
I still remember how you used to say
I would die for you, I would live for you
I would fight for the right just to give to you
You can set me free, but you'll come back to me
Didn't we almost win? Didn't we almost win it all?
You can set me free, but you'll come back to me
