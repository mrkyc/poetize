Goin' nowhere

With somebody else (Hey, come on)
Sayin' I'm dangerous and you can do bad
All by yourself (Hey)

(Everybody got somethin' to say)
And they don't even wanna see
While they talk so badly
I actually make you happy
(All that matter is us anyway)
And I don't even give a damn
For you I'm a better man
So tell 'em, if they wanna hate, they can

And the life I live
You ain't out in the club all night
You wanna be the quiet part of my life
They don't understand how beautiful that is, hey, hey
