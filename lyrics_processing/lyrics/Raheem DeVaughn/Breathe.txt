The ultimate pleasure's giving pleasure
Yeah, I'm a Taurus...
They say that we're patient lovers
Bet you're a Aries, are you a Scorpio? Cancer? Capricorn?
On the cusp? Cool

If you should feel thirsty, I'll be sure to bring you water
Yes girl I got candles that will slow burn longer
And I know your favorite love song
And how you like it on repeat, me
I was born a patient lover
So I'll start with your feet

It would be like, when hearts beat as one
It would feel like, no ordinary kiss for you and I
Now close your eyes, and picture us
Breathing life, the two of us
It would feel like, when hearts beat as one
It would be like, no ordinary love for you and I
Now close your eyes, and picture us
Breathing life, the two of us

I'll do my best to inspire you to dream of us til we meet again
You may even be encouraged to take a walk so we can love again
The Most High outdid herself when She created you
And girl I am thankful for how our love has bloomed
You might also like
It would be like, when hearts beat as one
It would feel like, no ordinary kiss for you and I
Now close your eyes, and picture us
Breathing life, the two of us
It would feel like, when hearts beat as one
It would be like, no ordinary love for you and I
Now close your eyes, and picture us
Breathing life, the two of us

Picture us making love
Picture us making love
Picture us making love
Baby, let's ride, picture us

It would be like, when hearts beat as one
It would feel like, no ordinary kiss for you and I
Now close your eyes, and picture us
Breathing life, the two of us
It would feel like, when hearts beat as one
It would be like, no ordinary love for you and I
Now close your eyes, and picture us
