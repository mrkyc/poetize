Yo, peace and love
I wanna tell y'all about the beautiful love experience
Hope you have time
Hope you don't mind

To my cousin, I'm hoping you can hear this rhyme
When I ride through the bricks, yeah
I think about you all the time
That cold day I got that phone call
It plays back in my mind
I can still hear your mother cry

But at least I can say that I first experienced love through you

And to my first girlfriend
I know you probably married now
But reminiscing on our prom date
The way I did you, yeah, was kinda foul
But I guess I had to wise up
So now I know better now
But at least I can say
You might also like
But at least I can say that I first experienced love through you

Like how it feels
When it comes
What it's like
When it leaves
So to the woman that betrayed me
I think its unfair how
How you chose to deceive me
I thought that was my child
Now he's forced inside for now

But at least I can say that I first experienced love through you

To the faith I've lost (Faith I've lost)
For the friends I've gain (The friends I've gain)
I'm thinking while I'm questioning change is a good thing
'Cause with dead weight you can't travel light (Can't travel light)
Besides I was born to fight so I'm gon' be alright (Born to fight)

But at least I can say that I first experienced love through you
How it feels
When it comes
What it's like
When it leaves
How it feels
To my momma, and my grandma
To my sister
And say goodbye to my family
After departure day and my friends told me what happened, oh

But at least I can say that I first experienced love through you

(I've experienced love)
I've experienced
The Love experience
(The love experience)
You should experience
(I'm telling you you should)
The love experience
(Experience)
We are all, all experiments
('Cause we're all experiments)
Of the love experience
(Of the love experience)
So just experience
(Oh, from the ghetto to the Great Walls in China)
We all should experience
The love experience
We all should experience
The love experience
(I'm telling you 'cause)
I've experienced
(As a baby)
The love experience
(After I came out my momma's womb)
You should experience
(I have been living love)
The love experience
(I am love)
We are all, all experiments
(The love experience)
Of the love experience
(The love experience)
But at least I can say that I first experienced love through you
I've experienced
The love experience
(The love experience)
You should experience
(It's something wonderful)
The love experience
(The love experience)
We are all, all experiments
(Is something powerful)
Of the love experience
(The love experience)
