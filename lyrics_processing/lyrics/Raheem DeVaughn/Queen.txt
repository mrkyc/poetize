Love came (love came, love came) forever...

You're a nurturer and a superwoman
You're every daughter that becomes a mother
And you can be my rock to the highest mountain top
From my heart to my toes, to cherish, love and hold

You're my queen, queen, queen, queen
Queen, queen, queen, queen, queen
You gave birth to all the land
You're the backbone of every man
You're my queen, queen, queen, queen
Queen, queen, queen, queen, queen
You wear the crown and you wear it well
I hold my head high so you can tell
Forever, forever you're my queen
You're my queen, queen, queen, queen
Queen, queen, queen, queen, queen

You're a counselor, just like grandmas do
You're that voice, you're that push for all I dream and do
So I cherish you like royalty
And by all means, I'll never put my hands on thee
You might also like

I never wanna be rid of me
The merest sensitivity
She is a warm, strong women
And I'm never gonna call you out your name
Yeah man make this and man make that
'Till the end of time, it's a well-known fact
Behind the greatest man it's a virtue of a woman


You could be my daughter
You could be my wife
My virtue of a woman
My rock (?) in life
(You're my queen, queen, queen, queen, queen)
You're the backbone of every man, baby
I won't never, ever call you out your name baby
You're my queen, you're my call
You're my love, you're my all
You gave birth to all the land
You're the backbone of every man
You're my queen, queen, queen, queen
Queen, queen, queen, queen, queen
You wear the crown and you wear it well
I hold my head high so you can tell
