Lady when the sun goes down (when the sun goes down)
And you find yourself in need of some rectification and some gratification
Just pick up the phone, dial, dial my number baby
I'll be there (and I'll be there, in record time flat)

10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
Countdown to love
Countdown to love
Countdown to love
Countdown to love to love to love to love

The conversation, pillow talk, you can call a fella
4play, you can call a fella
Back rub, you can call a fella
Warm bath, you can call a fella
Got an itch you need to scratch, call a fella
Insomnia, call a fella
Just left the club, call a fella
And I'm gon' be 

Promise I will make your day
Promise I won't make you wait
You can do whatever you like
Any hour is never too late
I wanna' give you all of me
And rock you from night to day
You wanna learn I love to teach
But see i'll let you have your way

A fantasy come true, call a fella
Come let me show you what it do, call a fella
Help to forget about who call a fella
A.M. around 2, call a fella
You need that work downtown, call a fella
Sunrise another round, call a fella
Good D to break you down, call a fella
Yeah you should get it right now call a fella

Promise I will make your day
Promise I won't make you wait
You can do whatever you like
Any hour is never too late
I wanna' give you all of me
And rock you from night to day
You wanna learn I love to teach
But see ill let you have your way
 (repeat until song ends)
