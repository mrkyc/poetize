I think I can speak for all men when I say
There's something exceptional, unique
About a woman

Your Colgate smile (Smile)
Those pretty brown eyes
Like heaven, smooth skin (Your)
Your hair in the wind
Those legs in those hills
That switch all in your walk
That sexy way you talk, girl
Like a DaVinci painting art, girl (Yeah that's true girl)

And I, if I can make you with a magic wand
I will make you no other got away
And who's made by the Maker of love?
You was made by the Maker of love
Baby listen I said I wouldn't change a thing
I want you, couldn't have you, no, ever kind away
Who was made by the Maker of love?
You was made by the Maker of love (You're exceptional)

Your body that curve
Your hips in that skirt
The smell of a fragrance
Oh a taste of a sweet kiss
The passion, the thrills
Goosebumps and the chills
Thy wish is thy will
And I'll do anything for you
See when it comes to you
You might also like
I-I love the way He made you
And I wouldn't change one thing
And who was made by the Maker of love?
You was made by the Maker of love
See I, if I made you
I wouldn't change one thing
Who was made by the Maker of love?
You was made by the Maker of love

From head to toe
You were made for love
You were made for man, made for me
You were made from a spark
To light up the world
With a man to cherish
To have and to hold
Save forever for now
See that's why I say now

Who was made by the Maker of love?
You was made by the Maker of love
If I, I wouldn't change one thing
Who was made by the Maker of love?
You was made by the Maker of love
See I, I know you were you're telling me
Made by the Maker of love
