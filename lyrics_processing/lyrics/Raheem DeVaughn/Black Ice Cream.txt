Out of 31 flavors baby you make 32
Let me scoop that on my cone, let me show you what it do
Open wide open sesame
Open wide open sesame
All the 32 flavors

You be the scoop, I be the cone
You be the Queen, I be the throne
You be the ride, I be the saddle babe
You be the spoon, I be the stir you crazy
Be the power of the P for the pleasure
I be your D and do whatever
You be the job, I be that work
I be that pipe that make you burst

When i'm in, you scream
You melt yeah, you be
Like black ice cream
Like black ice cream
From your lips, to your ears
Don't stop no, just give it here
You're like black ice cream
Like black ice cream

Put it on the bed and pinky swear
I be the hands to pull your hair
I be the motion in your ocean, baby
The helium to send you floating, lady
Cause you're my harem all in one
My right receiver when I call
I keep my grip, I don't let you fall
Make you climb, them mother f'in walls


See the thing right here
Taste of sweet liquorice right upon my lips
Baby when I'm kissing you it's like the sweetest gift
Set it all upon my face and scoop you with that lift
You've got that pretty brown round brown
Make me wanna go around
So stay right here
Love it when you cream
Love the way you scream
Get all up in my ear baby and tell me I'm your king
We play that Jodeci, that Sade, that Marvin
I be on your ice cream like Baskin and Robbins
Like oh oh oh oh oh oh
Do you feel me throbbing yet
I love it when you're soaking wet
My, my black ice cream
 + 

Not like mango, not like peach
Not like strawberries
(Black ice cream, like black ice cream)
Black ice cream
(When I can't find the words to say)
Sometimes I can't find the words to say
When I'm inside of you and you fuck me back
And I'm in your eye
(When I can't find the words to say)
It just comes out like, like
(When I can't find the words to say, I say, I say)
(When I can't find the words to say, I say, I say)
With conviction I say
(When I can't find the words to say)
You know what else? Listen
And I can go on and on and on, and all I know is what love is

Your love is so good baby
Hot on the outside with love on the inside
(All I know, all I know is your kiss is)
So good, makes me soak
(Coming down baby, dripping)
Wet on the inside with love on the inside
