Deep
Deep

Come and lay your body
In my kingdom (Kingdom)
'Cause I've been impatiently waiting
Had a hunger craving
For that honey-sweet wonderland
Sweat drops fall like molasses
Ain't no time frame limit (Slowly)
Off the bed, against the wall
On the floor when we fall
Girl, I can't wait to feel your grip
When you appear
It be on when it's time

It's time to get deeper, deeper (Deeper), deeper (Deeper)
In the dark (Deep, deep in the dark, oh-oh)
Slow songs on repeat (Alright)
All night off, no sleep
Wet, in between the sheets
Deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep
You might also like
Your face deep in my pillow
Your body all up on my throne
Your feet pressed against the wall
And once again, it's on (It's on)
Tease you 'til I please it (Please it)
Tremble when it's time (Tremble)
The flashbacks for tomorrow
When it's daydream time
I'll be damned if I don't love you like I should, ooh
Ooh, Lord, girl, you got the good, good, good, good
Your fingers pinch my pelvic bone
While I grip your waist
Don't wanna come up for air
That's how good you taste

It's time to get deeper (When it's time to get deeper), deeper (Yeah), deeper
In the dark (Deep, deep in the dark, deeper in the dark, yeah)
Slow songs on repeat  (Slow songs on repeat)
All night off, no sleep (All night)
Wet, in between the sheets (So, so sweaty wet)
Deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep (You know the energy, you know the vibes, girl, I get)
Deeper, deeper (Deeper, deeper), deeper (All lights out when it's time to get deeper)
In the dark (Deep, deep in the dark, deep in your walls, I dwell)
Slow songs on repeat (With slow jams, I'll rock your love)
All night off, no sleep
Wet, in between the sheets (Deep)
Deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep
(Deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep)
I'ma show your body gratitude
Play a slow jam to set the mood
You know the energy, you know the vibe
I'm waiting 'til the next time (I'll be waiting)
You know the energy, you know the vibe
I'm waiting 'til the next time
'Til you can pull up on me
Pantyless for easy access

It's time to get deeper, deeper (Deeper), deeper (Oh, let me get deeper)
In the dark (Deep, deep in the dark, in the dark)
Slow songs on repeat (Slow jams on repeat)
All night off, no sleep (Slippery wet)
Wet, in between the sheets
Deep, deep (Oh), deep, deep (Ooh, come), deep, deep (Come, come feel me deeper)
Deeper, deeper, deeper ('Cause the night time is the right time to feel this love deeper)
In the dark (Deep, deep in the dark, gonna go deep in the night time, baby)
Slow songs on repeat (One stroke with slow jams on repeat)
All night off, no sleep (Two from the high )
Wet, in between the sheets (To get it wet)
Deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep

(Hallelujah, once again, it's time)
Deeper, deeper, deeper (To get deep)
In the dark (Deep, deep in the dark, deep in the dark, baby)
Slow songs on repeat (I wanna feel all your love)
All night off, no sleep
Wet, in between the sheets
Love king
