I was ho-oo-oo hoping you would answer
Maybe ho-oo-oo hoping you would call
Maybe one shot too many got me wishful thinking reminiscing on the love we had
I know that its late
And I don't wanna disrespect the situation but
Hold up baby wait
I gotta get this up off of my chest
There's something you should know
Baby you're a tough act to follow
And when I'm all alone and I'm staring at the walls, in the back of my mind I hear my conscious call

I miss you here
Helping you undress
And the excitement of your heart beating out your chest
The way we lay it down and everything that comes next
I miss your touch, I miss your kiss, I miss your sex
I miss you here and your nastiness
I miss the wetness of our bodies when we sweat
The way you pull me in and everything that comes next
I miss your feel, I miss the thrill, I miss your, I miss your, I miss your
S-e-x baby I miss your sex (4x)
You might also like
I miss gripping your thighs, the look in your eyes baby when you release it
Now there I go, there I go once again reminiscing on the love we had
Baby are you still on the line?
Can I get it one more time, can I hit it, hit it one more time just one more time
I'm begging you baby
Please!!!

I miss you here
Helping you undress
And the excitement of your heart beating out your chest
The way we lay it down and everything that comes next
I miss your touch, I miss your kiss, I miss your sex
I miss you here and your nastiness
I miss the wetness of our bodies when we sweat
The way you pull me in and everything that comes next
I miss your feel, I miss the thrill, I miss your, I miss your, I miss your
S-e-x baby I miss your sex (4x)

This ain't what about I can't have
This is only about what I want
This is only about what I need
I need you next to me
And I know its kind of crazy how we strayed away to miss the love we had
I'm going through withdrawals
Said I miss you bad!!!
I miss you here
Helping you undress
And the excitement of your heart beating out your chest
The way we lay it down and everything that comes next
I miss your touch, I miss your kiss, I miss your sex
I miss you here and your nastiness
I miss the wetness of our bodies when we sweat
The way you pull me in and everything that comes next
I miss your feel, I miss the thrill, I miss your, I miss your, I miss your
