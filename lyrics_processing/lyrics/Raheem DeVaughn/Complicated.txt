Bliss, magnificent, orgasmic
Love can be all these things
Fear, timeless, complicated

They say that we make a good couple
But I'm too afraid to mess up what's special
We do what lovers do
But I'm obligated, that's what makes it cool
I would know it's true
Way she can tell from the surface
I would never hurt her on purpose
'Cause she don't deserve it, and I think she's perfect
But there's a chance things will change if she knows this, oh

I'm kinda single, but I'm in love (But I'm in love)
It's complicated because, because
(Blame it on my lifestyle)
I'm being patient, can't say we're dating (Oh no)
I can't explain it, it's complicated, girl
It's complicated, so complicated
I can't explain it, it's complicated, girl
I'm being patient, can't say we're dating
I can't explain it, it's complicated, yeah

Our friendship's too good to damage it
If we advanced it, I don't think we can handle it
And that's how I feel, I could be wrong
But me speaking from experience, I know
Sometimes I get confused, tryna handle it
Going through emotion, when I'm not emotionless
I'd rather be here for her to lean on
Than to be mad at me 'cause I let this go
It's complicated

I'm kinda single, but I'm in love (But I'm in love)
It's complicated because, because
I'm being patient, can't say we're dating
I can't explain it, it's complicated, girl
It's complicated, so complicated (Like a puzzle, baby)
I can't explain it, it's complicated, girl
(I can't explain it but I'm being patient, girl)
I'm being patient, can't say we're dating
I can't explain it, it's complicated, yeah

It's our code, we can't change
This friendship, our bond will remain (Will remain)
Call it what you want but I know what it is
Com-pli-ca-ted
My best friend, my buddy, I trust in her only
Has good intentions for me
Call it what you want but I know what it is
Com-pli-ca-ted
I'm kinda single, but I'm in love (But I'm in love with you)
It's complicated because, because
(I think it's complicated)
I'm being patient, can't say we're dating
(But I'm selfish, hey, hey)
I can't explain it, it's complicated, girl
It's complicated, so complicated
I can't explain it, it's complicated, girl
(Don't know why I can't explain it)
I'm being patient, can't say we're dating
I can't explain it, it's complicated, yeah
I'm kinda single, but I'm in love
(But I'm a single man sometimes)
It's complicated because, because
I'm being patient, can't say we're dating
I can't explain it, it's complicated, girl
(Oh, why is love so complicated?)
It's complicated, so complicated
(Complicated)
I can't explain it, it's complicated, girl
(Complicated)
I'm being patient, can't say we're dating
I can't explain it, it's complicated, yeah

It's complicated, I make it complicated
It's complicated, it's complicated
