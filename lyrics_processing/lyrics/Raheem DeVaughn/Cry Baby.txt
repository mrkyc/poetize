(So go 'head and cry, cry)

Can't wait to dim the lights and make you, you scream, baby
Baby, don't lean back, let me dive right in, oh yeah
Your thighs (Your thighs) 'round my waist ('Round my waist)
Put that (Right here) on my face (On my face)
Can you handle it (Handle it) when I'm all the way in?

It'll probably make cry baby (Baby)
When I love your body like I do
