Believe in me
Believe in me
You must believe
Believe in me

With affection like a dreamer
With patience and understanding
Like a teacher with a student, vice versa
Promise not to hurt you, not to leave
Not to lie, not to cheat
Not to fuss, not to stress
Like the rest in your past
All I ask

Believe me, I ain't like most men, no
I ain't like them others you done dealt with in the past
Just have some faith
That's all I ask, believe in me (Oh, oh, oh)
Believe me, I ain't like most men, baby
I ain't like them others you done dealt with in the past
(Girl, all I ask) All I ask
(Just have some faith) Have some faith
(Believe in me) Believe in me (Believe in me)
