Ridiculous

I never said that every choice I make
Everyone was gonna like
I never said that satisfying the masses is how I would live my life
And never once did I say all of my decisions would be right
I never said I would ignore my heart and listen with just my mind

And I know it looks like I've gone crazy
But in the way of love and what it does
I'll be crazy for us

So call me a fool, call me insane
Tell me the loving you the way I do is ridiculous
I don't mind, no, I don't mind
Forget the rules, I'm over the game
Baby, if loving you the way you do is ridiculous
Then call me ridiculous
Call me ridiculous

Every one knows what I'm suppose to do
Everybody says I'm out my mind to feel what I feel for you
(Feel what I feel for you)
Everybody needs to mind their own, to this love I'm not brand new
(Brand new, brand new)
See, I know when it's real love though they think I don't have a clue, I do
You might also like
And I know it looks like I've gone crazy
(I know it looks like I'm crazy)
But in the way that I love and what it does
I'll be crazy for us

So call me a fool, call me insane
Tell me that loving you the way I do is ridiculous
I don't mind, no, I don't mind
Forget the rules, I'm over the game
Baby if loving you the way you do is ridiculous
Then call me ridiculous
Call me ridiculous

For seeing something inside you that no one else can see
That's way they don't understand me, no
So stupid (Stupid), idiot (Idiot), nothin' to it
Say what they will, I don't mind
Baby, that's what I'll be (That's just what I'll be)
Long as it's always a we, ridiculous, that's me (Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
Ridiculous, that's me, me (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

So call me a fool (A fool), call me insane (Insane)
Tell me the loving you the way I do is ridiculous (I don't mind)
I don't mind, no, I don't mind (No, I don't, I don't mind, baby)
Forget the rules (Hey), I'm over the game
Baby, if loving you the way you do is ridiculous
Then call me ridiculous (Call me)
So call me a fool (A fool), call me insane
Tell me the loving you the way I do is ridiculous
(I don't mind, no, I don't mind, I don't mind)
I don't mind, no I don't mind (I don't mind, no)
Forget the rules (Got my rings), I'm over the game (I'm retired)
Baby if loving you the way you do is ridiculous (Ridiculous, oh yeah)
Then call me ridiculous (Call me ridiculous)
