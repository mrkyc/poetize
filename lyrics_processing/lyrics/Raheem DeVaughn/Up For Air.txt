You're listening to WDMG 69.1
I'ma zone out for a second, you wanna turn the lights out?
(It's true)
Arched back
You're around the perimeter just circling because it feels good (It's true)
Climb on top of the mountain, develop like a Polaroid, spit
Blow on top of the hood, you can't avoid it
Feels like I'm caping for the D effortlessly
Fondle the lips, grip
Wait, baby, grip
Handle that, shh (It's true)
Intertwine the tongue, just the tip now, kiss
Our lips become one when you twist
Love me long time before you love me long time
Moans, feeling my follicles
You standin' straight up like the hairs on my neck (It's true), this
Nasty, open, pulsating, quaking, the roar got you smilin'
Taste is sweet, unique to our chemistry
I'm vulnerable this wide open, so waste not one, my love, eat
"X-rated classic" be the caption (It's true)
You and me hashtaggin'
Possessed in your fingertips and you clean up the rest
She's ready for good smashin'
You got the rights to brag
So go in

Flowin' like Niagara Falls when I break your dam
Already, yeah

When I'm kissin' and strokin'
When your sesame's open
When I'm down on your love
(I won't come up for air) When I'm down on your love
When you're hollerin', screamin'
Arch your back and then I lean in
When I'm down on your love
(I won't come up for air) Baby, wow
'Til we're leanin' off the bed, babe
You break your nails and hit your head on the headboard
When I'm down yonder on your love
(I won't come up for air) Yeah
'Til you feel me up your dress, feel me down your spine
'Til you say it's TKO, 'til it's tap-out time
I won't, baby, no, no

You're screamin' Jesus' name in vain, keep it there for me
L-O-V-I-N-G
Mercy, no, ooh, oh
Now say that punani belong to me
And I'm gon' treat you like my Q-U-double-E-N (Yeah, yeah)
And I'm gon' stay on ready 'til your body say when (When? When?)
Sex you up 'til you tick-tick-tick-tick-boom
'Til you up, up, up, up on top
'Til Victoria is showing me all of your secrets

And when I'm kissin' and strokin'
When your sesame's open
When I'm down on your love

When you're hollerin', screamin' (Screamin')
Arch your back and then I lean in (I lean in, yeah)

W is for all the work that I'm gon' put in (Oh)
X is for X-rated, so nasty when you take it
Y is for the way that you never tell me no
And Z is for the way you love me like an animal
Like lions and tigers in bed (We be at it like)
We be mating like the birds and bees (It's true)
(We be at it like) Suffocatin' in your love
And I don't come up for air

When I'm kissin' and strokin'
When your sesame's open (When you're open sesame, baby, yeah)
When I'm down on your love
