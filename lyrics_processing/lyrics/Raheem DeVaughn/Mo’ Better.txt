Even... even if I don't have much to my name
And through the ups and downs it come with faith in my life
You pat me on the back and rub away the pain cause your my baby, my darlin
Priceless... You're priceless, no dollar amount can buy the friendship you bring
You are the first lady worthy of a king... my queen
The momment I set eyes on you I knew I would fall

See life ain't so bad after all
You make it better, better, better, better

You make it better, You make it better, You make it better, You make it better... I know your love gets more better, more better with time

Like a rainbow cutting through to take out the clouds
When you come around girl and make me smile
It's a joy to hear you say things will work out some how
Cause you're my baby, my darlin
So promise, promise me and I'll promise you
Promise and I'll make a vow to, to you girl
Cause from the momment I set eyes on you
I ken that fairy tales come true

See life ain't so bad after all
You make it better, better, better, better
