Ra-heem, Big, Boi

Hey, the energy in your words is so innocent (So innocent)
But so enticing, so inviting, ooh, wow (Wow)
The energy in your touch is so bashful but yet so triple-X-rated
Oh, ooh wee, the energy in your kiss leaves a bitter taste of a tease
But I'm so pleased 'cause you're delicious
Oh (Ooh wee), see, magnetic energy
When you add that up with me, it's obvious to see

We got a match that's made on earth, girl
(We've got it, we've got it)
The next best thing to heaven, girl
(We've got it, hey, hey)
We got a match that's made on earth, girl
(We got the next best thing, hey)
The next best thing to heaven, girl (Ooh, ooh)

You and I, we got energy (Like my lips on your lips, girl)
Oh, energy (When we do it after dark, girl)
You and I, we got energy (Like slow songs in the bedroom)
Oh, oh, oh, energy (Like magnets when we touch, girl)
You and I, we got
You might also like
And so we connect with our eyes
And you wrap me up in your thighs
And you try to keep your voice
If it's good and you make noise
And you just can't get away, so you agree to stay
We both know what it is, and we get in on what it is
It is what it is, hey

We got a match that's made on earth, girl
(We got a match made, yeah, yeah, yeah)
The next best thing to heaven, girl
(A match made on earth, girl)
We got a match that's made on earth, girl
(We got a match)
The next best thing to heaven, girl (Hey, hey, hey, hey, ooh, ooh)

You and I, we got energy (You and I we got energy)
Oh, energy (You and I, we got chemistry, hey)
You and I, we got energy (Like doin' it after dark, girl)
Oh, oh, oh, energy (Like Magnums in the bedroom)
You and I, we got

Energy like Bill and Hillary Clinton
Did I mention, my chicks stay 'round like a pension plan
Nigga never penny pinchin'
Down for the build up, the shit in the kitchen
Nutrition, sorta like these power bars
From, from the Dirty South and this is how we are
All y'all can call the law
If y'all think what y'all bought, boy, was flaw
Shor-ty, where they do that at? Rat, they
In the land of the "A" where everybody say "hey"
When you walk by, ah, a good vibration
Or either say "get up" in hood situations
A li'l bit of Red Bull and vodka might kill the fatigue
It's Hennessy and Crunk Juice for me
But the vigorous activity with no sleep
Now that's energy, B-O-I B-I-G
You and I, we got energy (Like my love in the bedroom)
Oh, energy (Like magnets when we touch, girl)
You and I, we got energy (I just can't get enough, no, no, no, no)
Oh, oh, oh, energy (Like one mo' gin, one mo' gin, girl)
You and I, we got

You and I, we got
