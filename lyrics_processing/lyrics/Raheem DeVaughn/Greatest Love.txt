Like a backboard, I hit it, baby
Don't stop, get it, get it
Call me Michael Phelps way I be swimmin' in it
She, she wailin' like a siren, louder than my radio
Light as a feather, hard as a rock
Like a backboard, I hit it, baby
Don't stop, get it, get it
Call me Michael Phelps way I be swimmin' in it
She, she wailin' like a siren, louder than my radio
Light as a feather, hard as a rock

Our love was made to fill your heart
My width was made to fill that part of you
To climb aboard and straddle me
To taste and touch all of your anatomy
(Call me Michael Phelps way I be swimmin' in it)

Girl tonight, all of your expectations I'll supersede
And girl tonight, I'm gonna give your body all the love therapy it needs
And girl tomorrow, you're reflecting, recollecting, I'll be on your mind
And girl, not to be cocky, not to brag, but I will be the best you ever had
Welcome to love land
I'll be your lover (I'll be your lover)
I'll be your king (I will be your king, baby)
I'll be your freaky freak, baby (I'll be freakin' you)
And all your wet dreams
Just call me your love king (Your love K-I-N-G)
In the bedroom, my throne (Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
And prepare for the greatest love, the best you've ever known
The best, greatest, the best, the best, best
Greatest, the best, best, the best
Greatest, the best, best, the best
Greatest, the best

My sex was made to sweat out your weave
To make your MAC makeup smear and run

And call me Mister extra low the way I make it flow
Let me hydrate you from the sex

And girl tonight, gonna give your body all the love therapy it needs
