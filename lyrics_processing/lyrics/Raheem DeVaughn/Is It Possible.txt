Question:
Can a smile lead to a hello
And a hello lead to a first date
And a first date to a can't wait to do it again
Ain't no pressure (No)
Can just let love develop
Get to know one another
From a sister
To a brother
I'm just wondering
I'm just wondering
If we start as friends
I'm just wondering
If you have a man
I'm just wondering
If I could be around, permanent
How can I get down?
I'm just wondering (Oh)
What do you see
When you look at me
In your beliefs, do dreams come true?
'Cause I dream of you, of holding you
I'm wondering, oh

Is it possible
For you to see
That maybe you and I could be
Is it possible
For you to see
That maybe you say I could be
Say it's possible
For you to see that maybe you and I could be
Is it possible
To be logical
For you to see that we could be

Patience, I was born with plenty
So if and when you're ready
Have some faith, girl
And we can step out on faith
'Cause baby, I'm not your everyday, average man
Spittin' every day, average lust
Or rehearse, girl, I speak the truth at all times
So if you're wonderin', this is too far fetched
If you're wonderin', this is no conquest
To love you, then leave you there
So I'm wondering, wondering, oh, oh

Is it possible
For you to see
That maybe you and I could be
Is it possible
For you to see
That maybe you say I could be
Say it's possible
For you to see that maybe you and I could be
Is it possible
To be logical
For you to see that we could be, baby
Is it possible
Oh, say it, say it, say it
Oh, oh, oh, yeah, baby
Oh, oh, oh, baby, I want to know

Is it possible
For you to see
That maybe you and I could be
Is it possible
For you to see
That maybe you say I could be
Say it's possible
For you to see that maybe you and I could be
Is it possible
To be logical
For you to see that we could be
Is it possible
For you to see
That maybe you and I could be
Is it possible
For you to see
That maybe you say I could be
Say it's possible
For you to see that maybe you and I could be
Is it possible
To be logical
For you to see that we could be, baby
Hey, you ever been between a rock and a hard place?
Perhaps had the silver spoon instead of the struggle
You can't have one without the other
And besides, a contradictory, self-defeating course of action only leads to self-destruction
