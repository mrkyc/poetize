'Cause I don't wanna wait another day
Be ready to scream, you'd better be
'Cause girl, I just might do the same

Oh, (And I) knew soon as I felt it
I'd lose control
(Baby girl, I knew I was gonna lose control)

So, I don't, I don't wanna tip-toe around
Just go down right here
You're turning me on, I want it, come get on it
Baby, let's get naked now
While I'm screaming your name, I'm gone, I can't control it
I love the way you break me down
