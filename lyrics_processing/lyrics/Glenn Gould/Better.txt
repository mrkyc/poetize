I know you think you know me better (Know me better)
Think you could should show me how the stars align
You shouldn't waste your time
I definitely know me better (Know me better)
I know every part of my design
And I'll be just fine
See how much you doubt me now as the lights go down
Round and around and around when the lights go-
Round and around and around when the lights go-
Round and around and around when the lights go-
Round and around and around and around
Round and around and around when the lights go-
Round and around and around when the lights, light
Round and around and around when the lights go-
Round and around and around when the lights go-
I know you like what you see (You see)
All the glory that I know you think you gave me (Gave me)
But it's never been about you
I can do it all without you
So you probably shouldn't look so pleased, please
(Tell, tell, tell, tell, tell)
