This is not a song of the year, this the anthem
Got a two-story, but I treat it like a mansion

Says she's down to give me brain, but she not a fan
Closed legs don't get fed with a closed mind
So I let that chick hanging like a clothesline

Dressed down to the socks Dapper Dan (Uh-huh)
Ho's sweating me, tryna hold my hand (Hold my hand)
