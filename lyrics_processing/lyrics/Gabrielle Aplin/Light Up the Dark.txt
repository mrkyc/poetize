I don't have to mention
That I saw you today
I shone the sun into your eyes
And you don't always have to question
Why there's pleasure and pain
Because there's no truth for you to find

I'm drawing perfect circles
'Round the life that we could share
And what is ours is ours to keep
I know the thing you want the most
You hide it over there
Safe at the dark end of the street

When the devil's waiting
Down by the river calling out
I wanna be
The one to light up the dark in you
And when the flood is over
And all the love is pouring out
I wanna be
The one to light up the dark in you
Light up the dark in you
Light up the dark in you
La-light up the dark in you
You might also like
There's so little I'm afraid of
When it comes to an end
But I can't leave you on your own
When your chaos turns to silence
And your enemy's your friends
I will roll away the stone

When the devil's waiting
Down by the river calling out
I wanna be
The one to light up the dark in you
And when the flood is over
And all the love is pouring out
I wanna be
The one to light up the dark in you
Light up the dark in you
Light up the dark in you
La-light up the dark in you
Light up the dark in you
Light up the dark in you
La-light up the dark in you

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
When the devil's waiting
Down by the river calling out
I wanna be
The one to light up the dark in you
And when the flood is over
And all the love is pouring out
I wanna be
The one to light up the dark in you

And when the devil's waiting
Down by the river calling out
I wanna be
The one to light up the dark in you
And when the flood is over
And all the love is pouring out
I wanna be
The one to light up the dark in you
Light up the dark in you
Light up the dark in you
La-light up the dark in you
