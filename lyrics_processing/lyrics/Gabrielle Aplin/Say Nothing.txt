I don't know about you, but I'm tired
Running after you, putting out fires, oh
You're waiting for something
That won't come for nothing
Maybe it's not me
Maybe it's not me
In the heat of the moment
When you're wide-eyed and broken
Are you thinking of me?
Are you thinking of me?

So, tell me a lie
Tell me you were high
Let me know why
Do anything it takes
Tell me it was a mistake
Tell me how your heart breaks
It meant nothing anyway
Say anything to make me stay
But you say nothing
But you say nothing

You look so confused
Don't you try
To twist the truth and get inside my
Mind yourself, we're on our last strike
That thin line
You're so under the pressure
With nothing else left
Are you thinking of me?
Are you thinking of me?
You might also like
So, tell me a lie
Tell me you were high
Let me know why
Do anything it takes
Tell me it was a mistake
Tell me how your heart breaks
It meant nothing anyway
Say anything to make me stay
But you say nothing
But you say nothing

Tell me, are you in there?
Give me a sign
Nothing's gonna make this right this time
I know that you're in there
Where do you hide?
This time, I only came to say goodbye
But you said nothing

So, tell me a lie
Tell me you were high
Let me know why
Tell me anything it takes
Tell me it was a mistake
Tell me how your heart breaks
It meant nothing anyway
Do anything to make me stay
But you say nothing, oh
You say nothing
Do anything to make me stay
But you say, oh, oh
And you say nothing
Do anything to make me stay
