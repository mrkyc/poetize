You, you, kept, you
You kept you
You, you, kept, you
(Ahhhhhhhh, Ahhhhhhhh, Ahhhhhhhh)
You kept, you, you kept, you, you...(Ahhhhhhhh, Ahhhhhhhh, Ahhhhhhhh)
You kept
You kept all the things I threw away
A leaf I picked, a birthday card I made
Holding on to memories of you and me
We didn't last a year, oh
We're just a box of souvenirs
'Cause maybe, be, be, be...
Ahhhhhhhh
Ahhhhhhhh
Ahhhhhhhh
Hucci
Good
You kept all...
You, you kept all...
You kept all the things I threw
You kept all...
You, you kept all...
You kept all the things I threw

The more I know it's over, dear, dear, dear, oh
We're just a box of souvenirs and
Maybe I pulled the panic cord
Maybe you were happy, I was bored
Maybe I wanted you to change
Maybe I'm the one to blame
Maybe you were just too nice to me, me, me, me, me, me, me....
May.. me, me, me, me, me
Just too nice
To me, me, me, me...
May.. me, me, me...
Me, me, me, me...

Me, me, me, me...
Maybe it took me way to long to leave
Maybe once we felt the same, oh
Maybe once we felt the same, oh
(Felt the same, oh)
Once we felt the same
Maybe once we felt the same, oh
(Felt the same, oh)

This meant more to
This, this meant more to
This meant more to you than it did to me
This meant more to
