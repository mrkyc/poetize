Heaven, help me
My mind changes like the wind
Please excuse me
I don't know where to begin
But I didn't think I cared
I could be your friend
But I'm unprepared
Oh, I've never felt like this
I was unaware
You were lighting flares
Now, I'm running scared
Oh, how did it come to this?

You know I've never
Been so lonely on my own
And it shows
'Cause I don't see you
Like I used to
Now I'm going back on the things that I know

Oh, all my nights
Taste like gold
Yeah, when I'm with you
It's like everything glows
And all my days
We can lay low
Yeah, when we're waking up
We're waking up slow
You might also like
I can rearrange
Would you do the same?
I don't wanna change
But you're just too good to miss
'Cause I'm intertwined
And I'm running blind
But I don't mind
I'm so glad it came to this

You know I've never
Been so lonely on my own
And it shows
'Cause I don't see you
Like I used to
Now I'm going back on the things that I know

Oh, all my nights
Taste like gold
Yeah, when I'm with you
It's like everything glows
And all my days
We can lay low
Yeah, when we're waking up
We're waking up slow
It's a little bit clearer now
I love you like the sun came out
Oh, we're waking up
We're waking up slow
It's like I never had a doubt
I love you like the sun came out
Oh, we're waking up
We're waking up

Like I told ya
Don't look backwards
'Cause now I see you here
Nothing else matters
Like I told ya
Don't look backwards
'Cause now I see you here
I'm going back on the things that I know

Oh, all my nights
Taste like gold
Yeah, when I'm with you
It's like everything glows
And all my days we can lay low
Yeah, when we're waking up
We're waking up slow
It's a little bit clearer now
I love you like the sun came out
Oh, we're waking up
We're waking up slow
It's like I never had a doubt
I love you like the sun came out
Oh, we're waking up
