Follow me
Carelessly
Leave our plans on the back seat
Chase the lines
Two at a time
Open your eyes
Do you remember me?

You don't like dancing
But don't you ever say
We're going nowhere
There's always somewhere we can be

You and me, we can be you and me
So, why aren't you dancing?
Why aren't you dancing?
What ever happened?
I thought we had it all
You think there's nothing
There's always something we can be
You and me, we can be you and me
So, why aren't you dancing?
Why aren't you dancing?
You might also like
Close the night down
You've made your point now
There's nothing here
When you're way over there
Don't be like that
I'll pull you back
You'll swim in deep
But you'll come up for air

You don't like dancing
But don't you ever say
We're going nowhere
There's always somewhere we can be

You and me, we can be you and me
So, why aren't you dancing?
Why aren't you dancing?
What ever happened?
I thought we had it all
You think there's nothing
There's always something we can be
You and me, we can be you and me
So, why aren't you dancing?
Why aren't you dancing?
I won't be giving up this way
I'll make you happy that you came
Oh, how do you know if you don't feel it?
Oh, oh, oh

You don't like dancing
But don't you ever say
We're going nowhere
There's always somewhere we can be

You and me, we can be you and me
So, why aren't you dancing?
Why aren't you dancing?
What ever happened?
I thought we had it all
You think there's nothing
There's always something we can be
You and me, we can be you and me
So, why aren't you dancing?
