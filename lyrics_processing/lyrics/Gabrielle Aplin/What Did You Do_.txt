Hiding behind all of the walls
Running inside, locking the door
Nothing ahead, no one to hurt
You know you can't fall off the floor

I didn't look for you
I didn't ask for this
I didn't need you to pull me apart

I've been falling out of control
I think of you wherever I go
Oh, what did you do?
Oh, what did you do to me?
I've never felt so lonely alone
I didn't care 'til you came along
Oh, what did you do?
Oh, what did you do to me?
Oh, what did you do?
Oh, what did you do to me?

I'm in the dark
I'm such a mess
Wherever we are, here in this now
So look what you've done
Wasn't my fault
You'll see the worst if you stick around
You might also like
I didn't call for you
I didn't ask for this
I didn't need you to pull me apart

I've been falling out of control
I think of you wherever I go
Oh, what did you do?
Oh, what did you do to me?
I've never felt so lonely alone
I didn't care 'til you came along
Oh, what did you do?
Oh, what did you do to me?
Oh, what did you do?
Oh, what did you do to me?
Oooh, ooh, oh oh
Oooh, ooh, oh oh

I didn't look for you
I didn't ask for this
I didn't need you to
But I'm coming round to it

I've been falling out of control
I think of you wherever I go
Oh, what did you do?
Oh, what did you do?
I've never felt so lonely alone
I didn't care 'til you came along
Oh, what did you do?
Oh, what did you do to me?
Oh, what did you do?
Oh, what did you do to me?
Oooh, ooh, oh oh
