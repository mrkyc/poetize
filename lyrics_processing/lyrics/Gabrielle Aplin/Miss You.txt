So what you been doing?
I've been loving my life waking up on my own
Are you doing the same thing?
You can say if you like, but I don't need to know
And I, I've been wondering why we've been wasting all this time
So what you been doing?
I thought that I saw you, I guess I was wrong
Are you doing the same thing?
Convincing yourself you're better alone
And I could tell you how you never left my mind

Then, you tell me that you miss me and I'm like

Oh God, I miss you, too
It's all I ever do
I'm coming back to you
And I won't let go
Oh God, I miss you, too
We got making up to do
I'm coming back to you
And I won't let go again
Oh, I won't let go again
You might also like
So what were we thinking?
You got me a cab, and we said we were done
And I thought I was fine
But the days were so long, and they rolled into one
And I, I couldn't believe you were taking it in your stride

Then, you tell me that you miss me and I'm like

Oh God, I miss you, too
It's all I ever do
I'm coming back to you
And I won't let go
Oh God, I miss you, too
We got making up to do
I'm coming back to you
And I won't let go again
Oh, I won't let go again

Will you be my best friend?
Will you be my last?
I need somebody who can love me like that
You be my best friend
Will you be my last?
I need somebody who can love me like that
Oh God, I miss you, too
It's all I ever do
I'm coming back to you
And I won't let go
Oh God, I miss you, too
We got making up to do
I'm coming back to you
And I won't let go again

Will you be my best friend?
Will you be my last? (Oh, I won't let go again)
I need somebody who can love me like that
Will you be my best friend?
Will you be my last?
