I think I think too much
I think we know too much
Every time I'm pushing past and look right in
I'm in a photograph
While different people pass
I'm looking out and they just stare right in

I've been looking for a moment to say a lie
But I just end up with nothing

Give me a reason to let you go
'Cause I am drowning in your shallow love
Give me a reason, won't you let me know?
This heart of mine is sinking like a stone
Shallow love, let me go
Shallow love, let me go

I try to wind it off
I think I've said enough
Don't you think it's time that you could take your turn?
Maybe I'm wasting time
My motions, paralyzed
And I don't even hear you when you're crying out loud
You might also like
I'm always waiting for someone to start a fight
But I just end up with nothing

Give me a reason to let you go
'Cause I am drowning in your shallow love
Give me a reason, won't you let me know?
This heart of mine is sinking like a stone
Shallow love, let me go
Shallow love, let me go
Shallow love, let me go
Shallow love, let me go

I never feel the wanting
I never feel the needing
Give me a reason to follow, follow
I'm scared of running to you
I'm tired of asking again and again, again and again

Give me a reason to let you go
'Cause I am drowning in your shallow love
Give me a reason to let you go
Cause I am drowning in your shallow love
Give me a reason, won't you let me know?
This heart of mine is sinking like a stone
Shallow love, let me go
Shallow love, let me go
Shallow love, let me go
