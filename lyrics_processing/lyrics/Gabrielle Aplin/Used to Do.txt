Time went slowly
But then, it hit me 'round the head
I'm not quite over this just yet
I thought I'd let go gently
But I've been holding on too tight
And it still keeps me up at night
It isn't right

It's not healthy
To stay homesick for so long
When you don't feel like you belong
Because I have these memories
But some got lost along with time
And some still linger in my mind
It's hard to find
Somewhere to go
But I just wanted you to know that I've come home

Can you hear me?
Tell me that you feel it, too
Do you still know me
Like you used to do?
You might also like
Nobody loves me like you used to do
Nobody loved me like you used to do
Do you still need me
Like you used to do?

I've seen colors
Shining from the other side
When they're close enough, they're blinding
And they pull you under
Show you what you left behind
Until you slowly realize
You'll never find
A place to go
But I just wanted you to know that I've come home

Can you hear me?
Tell me that you feel it, too
Do you still know me
Like you used to do?

Nobody loves me like you used to do
Nobody loved me like you used to do
Do you still need me
Like you used to do?
No, no, no, no, no, nobody
Nobody loves me like you used to do
No, no, no, no, no, nobody
Nobody loves me like you used to do, love

Can you hear me?
Tell me that you feel it, too
Do you still know me
Like you used to do?

Nobody loves me like you used to do
Nobody loved me like you used to do
Do you still need me
