Of the 7 deadly sins
We're all at the mercy
Of the elements in this world we're in
We're all at the mercy
Of each other's little whims
And we're all at the mercy
Of the little man within
Show no mercy, no more mercy
For this little man within
We're all at the mercy
Of the little man within
Hey mister how did you fit
Into the same shoes as him?
No more mercy, mo more mercy
Show no mercy, no more mercy
For the little man within
He tears up all the countryside
Stops when he should begin
He drowns when he tries to walk on water
But he never learns to swim
He's an animal but he thinks he's God
Gets him mixed up with him
And we're all at the mercy
Of this little man within
He was doing fine in 39
Thank God he did not win
He kept playing on his fiddle
As he watched old Rome cave in
He sold love away from his children's hearts
And told them it was sin
Now we're all at the mercy, we're all at the mercy
Of that little man within
Now he's sitting in the gardens
As the acid rain comes in
He got it covered full of rhino heads
And boots of leopard skin
He got the means, he make the harvest high
But you can count those hungry people die
We're all at the mercy
Of the greedy man within
So if you're feeling lonely, baby
If you're feeling blue
If you listen to your little friend
You know he'll tell you what to do
But if you hear his words and you get confused
Start believing they're all true
Then you have just been fooled again
Who said we won't get fooled again?
By the little man within
He might recognize the great one
He might understand what's good
But he believes that he can never live
The way they say he should
So he puts them in the asylum
And he just throws away the key
He keeps the deep freeze inside you
He keeps the deep freeze inside you
And he puts the light in me
So show no mercy, no more mercy
For the little man within
We're all at the mercy
Of this little man within
Hey sister, how did fit
Into the same shoes as him?
Show no mercy, show no mercy
Show no more mercy, no more mercy
For the little man within
Gonna kill, kill the little man within
Gonna kill, kill the little man within
Gonna kill the little man within
We've got to kill, kill the little man within, kill
