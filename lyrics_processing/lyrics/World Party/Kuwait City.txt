Miles of golden sand beside the sea (miles of golden sand beside the sea)
A brand new Chevy and a Muslim girl close to me
Never mind the black clouds floatin' out to sea (never mind the black clouds floatin' out to sea)
Just the news team on the corner
Well I think they might be filming me

We got the Muslims and the Christians and the PLO
And Israel still says "no!"
There ain't no sun at all
There really ain't no sun at all in Kuwait City (Ku-Ku-Kuwait)

Drive to the mall and buy a new TV (drive to the mall and buy a new TV)
An alarm they recorded
There's a lot of twin peaks I didn't get to see
We won the contract cappin' all the wells down by the sea (the contract cappin' all the wells down by the sea)
Cause there's no cold beer in the bars (oh no!)
For my buddies and me (oh well)

You know we dropped all the bombs with a lot of precision
I think we put an end to female circumcision
And there ain't no sun at all
No, there really ain't no sun at all
Well, there's hardly any sun at all in Kuwait City (Ku-Ku-Ku-Ku-Kuwait)

Ooh-ooh, Kuwait (so much tea)

You know we dropped all the bombs with surfin' precision
I think we put an end to female circumcision!
And there ain't no sun at all
There really ain't no sun at all
