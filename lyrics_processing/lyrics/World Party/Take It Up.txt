I got an extra glimpse of the truth today
Staring at my breakfast
When I thought I heard it say
Fighting is no good
Success an empty lie
The treasure hunt is lonely
Until you realise

We came to take it up
We came to take it up
We came to take it up
We came to raise it up
We came to take it up
We came to move it up

I promise you miss, I will do my best today
But somebody keeps trying to make me
Trying to make me lose my way
But I believe, oh my darling
I believe in you
And I hope when you hear this
You'll remember what we were sent to do
You might also like
We came to take it up
We came to take it up
We came to take it up
We came to move it up
We came to raise it up
We came to praise it up
I came to take you up
You came to take me up
We came to take us up
Take me up
Take me up
Mmmm la la la la la
La la la la la
La la la la la
Ohhhh
We came to take it up

Speeding out of the town
I thought I'd lost my way
Til I saw the green and ebony
Come a-wondering about their pay
Well I've got the money
If you've still got the friends
We can really put this world to right
Or sit and watch the end
You know
We gonna take it up
We gonna move it up
We gonna take it up
We gonna take it up
To the very very top
To the very very top
To the very very very very very very top
To the very very top
To the very very top
To the very very top
Ooh ooh
