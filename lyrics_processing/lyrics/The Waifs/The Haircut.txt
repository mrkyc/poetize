I thought I'd dye it red but got it cut instead
And maybe I could send you my long blond locks
'Cause you were always after something baby
Something I'm not
See I'm darker underneath, I'm darker by far
I'm dark as hell, you know who you are
My eyes, I always, I wished they where green
My skin is so damn brown but the sun, it don't see
And fingernails, I could've stuck them on
The hair on my lip I should've waxed it off
Yeah I know my lips could do with a little more pout
The mole on my chin I can do without
And my cheekbones, they never sat real high
I'll get some bone put in, they can take it from
My thighs
I'm darker underneath, I'm darker by far
I'm as dark as hell, you know who you are
So now when I make love, I make love to myself
I got no disease so it's good for my health
I got my hands in my pants, down my Calvin Kleins
I don't need you no more baby, I can come every time
You might also likeI'm darker underneath, I'm darker by far
I'm as dark as hell, you know who you are
Don't you ever show your face here again
To me or any of my friends
'Cause I'm glad I found out what you're all about
When I finally fell down off my cloud
'Cause baby when you ran away
You broke my heart
You kept my Kerouac books and that old guitar
And I am darker underneath, I'm darker by far
I'm as dark as all hell, you know what you are
I don't need to tell you, you know what you are
I don't need to tell you, you know what you are
I don't need to tell you, I don't need to tell you, no
You know what you are
This is more than a haircut I'm wearing on my head
