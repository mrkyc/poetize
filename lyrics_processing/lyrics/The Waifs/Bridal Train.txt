It is time to catch the Monterey
Cause the man I wed he waits for me
And a daughter that he's yet to see
The U.S. navy beamed its message
We'll deliver brides on a one way passage
It made big news across the nation
The bridal train leaves from Perth station
All the girls around Australia
Married to a yankee sailor
Your fare is paid across the sea
To the home of the brave and the land of the free
From west to east the young girls came
All aboard the bridal train
It was a farewell crossing over land
She's gone to meet her sailor man
No time for sad goodbyes
Well she held her mother as she cried
And then waited there in the Freo rain
To climb aboard the bridal train
Well she was holding her future in her hand
Yeah the faded photo of a man
Catch a sailor if you can
Yeah the war bride leaves her southern land

This is the story of the starry nights
Through desert plains and city lights
Through burning sun and driving rain
They leapt aboard the bridal train
All the girls around Australia
Married to a yankee sailor
Your fare is paid across the sea
To the home of the brave and the land of the free
From west to east the young girls came
