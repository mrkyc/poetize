And the judgment has begun
Courtesans on the thrones that have been cast down
And when those books are read
And the sanctuary cleansed
Then the lord shall put on his kingly robe and crown
And the saints will be singing that song
Of Moses and the lamb
I see the savior coming
With a sickle in his right hand
Saying let the holy be holy now
And the clothes of the Jesuit out
Saints will be singing that song
Of Moses and the lamb
Well I heard a cry
Echo through that midnight sky
Out of his judgment has now come
"Come out" they say
Lest he's sharing all her fates
Don't be drunken with the wine of Babylon
Saints will be singing that song
Of Moses and the lamb
I see the savior coming with a sickle in his right hand
Well the wicked gonna wail and weep
When he thrusts in the sickle to reap
Saints will be singing that song
Of Moses and the lamb
All that dirty gold
That my ragged purse can hold
Ain't enough to save my sorry soul
There's a heavy price
It takes a perfect sacrifice
For the keys to the city whose streets are made of gold
Saints will be singing that song
Of Moses and the lamb
I see the savior coming with a sickle in his right hand
Well the wicked gonna wail and weep
When he thrusts in that sickle to reap
Saints will be singing that song
Of Moses and the lamb
Well the lord himself
From heaven shall descend
And the shout of an angel will bring him
When the trumpet sounds
Then the whole earth shall resound
And we shall see the glory of our king
We're gonna be singing that song
Of Moses and the lamb
When the savior comes with a sickle in his right hand
Well the wicked gonna wail and weep
When he thrusts in that sickle to reap
Saints will be singing that song
Of Moses and the lamb
Didn't cry, shall rein
I'm corrupted by their graves
And we blew our ears to remain
Shall be caught up there
Meet our savior in the air
And so shall we ever be without lord and king
All night see a glass
Where the saints shall stand and laugh
Here the presence of our king
And we won a call
Sing praises to the lord
With a chorus of angels
And we will sing that song
Of Moses and the lamb
With the fall of the throne on the sea of glass we stand
Will the righteous be righteous then
When we meet on Zion's hill
Saints will be singing that song
Of Moses and the lamb
Staying true and righteous on the way
You are worthy of our praise
The saints will be singing that song
Of Moses and the lamb
I see the savior coming with a sickle in his right hand
Well the wicked gonna wail and weep
When he thrusts in that sickle to reap
Saints will be singing that song
