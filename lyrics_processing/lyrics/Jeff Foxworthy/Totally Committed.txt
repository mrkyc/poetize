Always figured if something was worth doing it was worth doing right
You ever see those dead possum lying in the road they were partially committed
Rule #1 if she ain't happy you ain't happy and if she ain't happy long enough your gonna be unhappy with half your
Stuff
Early on in our marriage when wed be in the same room for a half hour and she didn't say a word a word to me i would make the mistake of looking at her a saying whats wrong? Hoping it was something other than me
Now i have learned If were in the same room for a half hour and she doesnt say a word to
Me. ITS ME. Now i just go up to her and say baby i realize i have done or said something stupid and insensitive and while i dont yet know what it is i would like to go up to my room and think about it for a little while

I've learned early on in our relationship that women are complicated creatures
Once i had accepted that it made alot of things easier for me
But i have found that because women are complicated they like to think men are complicated too
You ever hear a group of women talking to each other " OOO i wish i knew what
He was really thinking" Ladies ill tell you what were really thinking
Were really thinking "I'd like a beer and i'd like to see something naked"
Thats all were thinking You go to a nursing home and see a 90 year old man going down the hall on
A walker Thats what hes thinking "I'd like a beer and I'd like to see something naked"

And i do belive what women understand men better than men understand women
Think about that
How often do you see a man stomp out of a room crying and have a woman go
"What, What'd I say?" Come Back
And i do think men would take advice on relationships but were not gonna sit down and read magazines about it. You got to feed it to us in a way were we'd accept it. Sneak it into the play-by-play of a baseball game
