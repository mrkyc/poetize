They should have to wear signs that just say I'm stupid
That way you wouldn't rely on them, would you?
You wouldn't ask them anything
It would be like, "Excuse me, oops, never mind"
"I didn't see your sign."
It's like before my wife
And I moved from Texas to California our house was full
Of boxes and there was a you-Haul truck in our driveway
My friend comes over and says, "Hey, You moving?"
"Nope."
"We just pack our stuff up once or twice a week
Just to see how many boxes it takes."
"Here's your sign."
Why can't they get the picture?
Why don't they understand?
We're not dealing with the planet of apes
We're talking about the modern man
So you people with them itsy bitsy teensie weensie tiny minds
Here's your sign
Here's your sign
A couple of months ago I went fishing with a buddy of mine

"Talked 'em into giving up."
"Here's your sign."
I was out in the front yard with my boy the other day and he was
Playing with his little friend
And he hit his friend and I went up to him
And I said "Hey, (smacks his boy), we don't hit."
He looked up at me like, "Here's your sign, dad."
Why can't they get the picture?
Why don't they understand?

We're talking about the modern man
So you people with them itsy bitsy teensie weensie tiny minds
Here's your sign

I was watching one of those animal shows on the Discovery Channel
There was a guy
Inventing a shark bite suit
There's only one way to test that
"Alright Jimmy, you got that shark suit on
It looks good
They want you to jump
Into this pool of sharks
And you tell us if it hurts when they bite you."
"Well alright, hold my sign, I don't want to loose it"
Why can't they get the picture?
Why don't they understand?
We're not dealing with the planet of apes
We're talking about the modern man
So you people with them itsy bitsy teensie weensie tiny minds
Here's your sign

Last time I was home I was driving around I had a flat tire
I pulled my truck into one
Of these side-of-the-road gas stations
The attendant walks out, looks
At my truck, looks at me, I swear to GOD he went
"Tire go flat?"
I couldn't resist
I said "Nope"
"No I was driving around
And those other three just swelled right up on me."
"Here's your sign."
Why can't they get the picture?
Why don't they understand?
We're not dealing with the planet of apes
We're talking about the modern man
So you people with them itsy bitsy teensie weensie tiny minds
People with them little bitty teenie weenie tiny monds

We were trying to sell our car about a year ago
A guy come over to the house, drove the
Car around for about 45 minutes
We get back to the house, he gets out
Of the car, reaches down
And grabs the exhaust pipe, then goes, "Damn that's hot!"
