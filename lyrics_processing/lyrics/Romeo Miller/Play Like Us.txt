With the girlies screaming every day
And you can play your ice this way
But can they hate no way no way no way
If you feeling Richie Rich play

I 'm the youngest soilder I got the game fitted
The new no limit game time did it
From Romie Rome homie to Richie Rich
Don't talk about dough 'cause I been had it

Wash face and save it show's I lace em
Number 1 on billboard I 'm sorry I replace em
Rome Lil' D Two Way play all day got me game face on uh huh

Ain't too many players that could hang wit us (hang wit us)
When we step up on the scene we looking marvolous (marvolous)
When I fuss at this thing that mean you hard to touch (hard to touch)
All the haters in my ear saying we ain't old enough (okay)
When the beat go just throw your hands up
All the girlies rushing up to the cadillac truck
Better hold on tight cause we about to bust
Richie Rich and Tyron can you dig it
What what

I 'm Lil' Romeo I know about cars and know about clothes and it ain't no flaws
I paid the cost to be the boss n clutch player
Pen and paper pass the apple now later
That's what's on play tag with the lazers
I'm from the south so I bite like a gator
Another year passed so my game got greater
Court side seats for the sixers and the lakers
Shake shake them haters do me a favor
Check out the wrist ice big like a blazer
Kid got flavor say oooohwe
I 'm where you wanna be ya'll can't stop me
Sing

Yo when the school bell ring baby roll wit me
Chrome wheeling scanding pank baby sittin on chrome
Iced out from my neck and my wrist all
Two Way Lil' Romeo and you know it's on

Where my girls at uh what what
Where my boys at uh what what
