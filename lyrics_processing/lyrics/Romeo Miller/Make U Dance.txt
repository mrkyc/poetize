Yo, this is for the angels out there
What's up Aaliyah, and to my fans...
Thanks for makin' me who I am, ok

Boy you're my angel, you're my darlin' angel
Closer to me than all my peeps, baby
Boy you're my angel, you're my darlin' angel
Boy you're my friend in time of need, baby

If you wanna dance, then I'ma make you dance
And if you wanna move, then I'ma make you move
But if ya down with No Limit, say Romeo
Romeo, Hey Romeo

Yeah, y'all know me
I'm the only kid my age you've seen with a crib on TV
But that's it respect it, you know No Limit
GameTime and I came to win it
I don't play with 'em baby baller, for real
S3 20 gettin' paid off my skill
My Daddy showed me how I could do that there
Supersize all the plaques put braids in my hair
It's Lil' Rome kickin' it with big P'zy
Mack daddies, the ballin' ain't easy
The girls love me and you know the game needs me
Platinum records, we doin' the thing easy
You might also like
That's the way, uh-huh uh-huh, I like it, uh-huh uh-huh
That's the way, uh-huh uh-huh, we like it, uh-huh uh-huh

I don't know if it's my raps or how I play ball
But they act crazy when I go to the mall
Autograph signin's when I walk in the door
It's like I'm servin' ice cream, I have you rushin' the store
Still lone and seen, P. Miller gear so clean
I done did a whole lot and I'm barely a teen
The girlies say they love me it must be the genes
Cuz everytime, they see me and my Dad they scream, ok

Boy you're my angel, you're my darlin' angel
Closer to me than all my peeps, baby
Boy you're my angel, you're my darlin' angel
Boy you're my friend in time of need, baby

Baby Hummer wasn't enough, had to get me a Jag
And I don't lie about nothin', man, look who my Dad
Got the sound on lock, whodi, I'm the best here
P. Miller sweats and sneaks we got the best gear
The girls love me when I step on the stage
When my babyface glowin' and my hair in a braid
I know the bodyguards hate when I stop and wave
And I been in more cities than I have birthdays
Miller boys it's official, they holdin' it down with me
The New No Limit you need me, just hit me (Romeo, Romeo, Hey Romeo)
You know I travel worldwide from the west to the east
I can't drive, I got a chauffeur, I'm in the passenger seat
Girls chasin' me around, wanna know my plans is
I'm platinum plus, whodi, check the fan mail
I'ma tell you why I'm here, who's stoppin' me now?
They know I got a club "Jumpin'" like Destiny Child
I'm a mini millionaire, pick apart the plate
Six flags, babygirl, you can have it your way
That's the way, uh-huh uh-huh, I like it, uh-huh uh-huh
That's the way, uh-huh uh-huh, we like it, uh-huh uh-huh
That's the way, uh-huh uh-huh, I like it, uh-huh uh-huh
