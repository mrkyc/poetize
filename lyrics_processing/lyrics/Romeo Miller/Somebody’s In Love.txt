I still remember when I met her, I would never forget her
It was cold outside, I gave her my sweater
Walk her from school and she gave me a letter
It read, "Romeo let's be friends forever
Be my Mickey Mouse and I'll be your Minnie
I'm feelin' you even though you're feelin' Jenie
Her name was Keesha, she always sat by the teacher
A seat away from Teresa and Lisa
Pam, was very out spoken in class
She was funny she always used to make us laugh
Now Monique, she was always sweet
And at recess we all played hide and seek, ya heard

You might also like
I like her dimples, the way she sharpens her pencils
The way her hair blows when she looks out the window
Her name's Sonya, she got a sister named Lonya
They new here, they just moved from California
Look like a pop star, can sing like Brittney Spears
Her bangs stay low in her No Limit Gear
Call her Tisha and Tamara's her twin
And there's Brandy, matter fact she's one of her friends
Kinda shy come about this high
Just right, I can look in her eyes rolled
Up in a baby hummer jump, this high
Come on ma, let's go for a ride

Yo I ain't gotta be away from you
You in the fifth grade I wanna be in that class with you
Font like the teacher just to reach you
All up in the hall rockin' hundred dollar sneakers
You see me in the video, true
They play it in the mall, yo true
Tryna ride, shorty let's go
I wanna show you where I be at
Give you what you want, that's a fact
Little free just call me the bomb
If you call I'm like the North Face mommy, I'll keep you warm
Though I do it hard with my Timberlands on
Laces untied, just my life
