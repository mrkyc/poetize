(Rich Boyz - Verse 2)
The girls them cupid long hair brows
My best ready to tone
Lookin' like I gotta box of fully peppers in my arm
I'm in the price of 300 with the source back doors
And my name on the seats and the feast 24
Gotta step up in the place
We goin' bounds growing g's
Up I'm in the trobec teams
When they spoke with the geers
These dudes can't beat us, uh
These players makin' it hap but when they come up first
They about to freaze up but just hit to my jag go for 8
That's my jeep over the top
Don't let it go below my waist cause my jeans 95
And my shoes are a buck 50
It kinda dozz up in club and nobody in makin' the room kinda hot up
In the place I could ruin the whole party all the ice in the system
People sayin' bow hardy it's kinda hard to have my wrist
When the rocks on my watch bigger than the ones
Than they could hit the live with

(Master P. - Verse 3)
You little dudes can't stop me from makin' the mill's
Cause I push Master whips with the guns and the wheels
But still, I'm money taller than hills
They might as well come at papa's gate cause I keep a lot of bills
Huh, and haters do but they can't son
I'm on the street ballin'
Like I'm runnin with M.Y huh
Y'all don't really wanna get it on
Love might cost a bit
So I keep the really really youngs I push all whips
Gettin' kinda, truck, I might be pushing the full
Like my walking buck
If I was you I won't try your luck
I guarantee like blue eye lids suck, huh
I guarantee I'm kinda better than y'all
Count every diamonds in my ear look like colourful cotton balls
Uh, and I'ma mind gettin' ball but I got some things
That I tell ya whole face yo, guarder
