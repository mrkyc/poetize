And I ain't gotta lie man you know who I'm is
I'm fresh, some call my clean iouno how to dance
But, I know how to lean in my P Miller pants
(Oh) I'm the sheriff and you in my town
You know how I get down, I don't play around

I make you lean like joe and terror squad
You got on p miller, throw ya hands in the sky
I got bucks like milwauke
Hit me on the cell phone, holla back on the walky talky
The new no limit, yeah we hot
I might be young, but I got this rap thang on lock
Yeah you know it's my time to shine
Throw me a ball, I hit a home run like barry bonds
If you in elementary juniour high or high school
Get it crunk, wild out wit the crew
If you ain't scared, say you ain't scared
We play tackle football with no pass
If you a soldier, say you a soldier
The new no limit up in here, I thought I told ya
After high school, I'm goin straight to the pros
Romeo got game, take it to the flo
