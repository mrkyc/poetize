Growin' up in the projects, I had to stick to the script
Every other day another person was hit
We rode busses to school, I followed the rules
First grade, second grade, packed up and we moved
Still had to struggle, my pops gave up his hustle
Got into music, then game started to bubble
My main focus is to study, stay out of trouble
Bad Bubba, look at me now, thanks Dad, I l love you
Whoever thought that a 12 year old could touch souls
Even hip-hop braids in a row, that's so cold
I tell my friends, family and all my fans
May God bless everyone on this land

Reach for the stars, life is trouble, put up a fight

First single "My Baby" number one 10 weeks

I'm young, but my dad taught me all about survival
I don't feed into the negative, I sho' improve what I do
