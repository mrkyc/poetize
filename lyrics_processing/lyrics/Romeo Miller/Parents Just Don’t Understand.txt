Yeah, dub baby uh

You know, parents are all the same no matter time or place

So to all you kids, across the land
There's no need to argue parents just don't understand

Na, na, they don't understand (Okay)
They ain't gon' get it (Okay)
No, no, if you feel me (Okay)
Feel me, feel me, feel me, feel me (Okay)

I remember one year my mom took me school shopping
It was me, my brother, my mom and my pop, and my little sister
All hoped in the car
And headed downtown to the gallery mall (Out!)
My mom started buggin' with the clothes to chose
I didn't say nothing at first, I just turn my nose
She said, "What's wrong? This shirt costs $50!"
I said, "This shirt is whack and it's not worth a dollar" (Out!)
The next half-hour was the same old thing
My mom buying me clothes from 1993
Then she lost her mind and did the ultimate
I asked her for a assement and she bought me skips
I said, "Mom, whatchu doin'? You ruinin' my rep"
She said, "You're only a kid, you don't have a rep yet"
So to you all the kids, across the land
There's no need to argue, parents just don't understand (Out!)

Holla all you kids across the land (Peace Out!)

Uh, underdig the situation
Mom's bounced out for a weeks vacation
And she left the keys to the 5 double O
Would she mind? Hmm well, how she gon' know?
I just get a Benzo, Lord spins
See what it look like with 20 inch rims
Then I be the man in my neighborhood
Well, maybe I shouldn't, yeah course I should
You payin' attention cause the plot gets hot
Yo, I pull the whip up to the end of the block
That's when I saw this dom piece startin' in my grill
My diamond rings blairin' from the steerin' wheel
Then she tryin' to pretend like she ain't notice Nick
So I blow her a kiss like I know this chick
Um, was that for me? Yeah, you know it huh?
Come take a ride with the young Billy Dee Williams
How do I know? You look sick
You could be some kind of lunatic
Aw, c'mon sugah, it's Nick from Nick
Besides would a lunatic push a whip like this? (Out!)
Na, na! (C'mon!)
They don't understand (Na, na, they don't understand)
They ain't gon' get it, no, no, if you feel me
Holla all you kids across the land (Out!)

I agreed we were on our way
He was lookin' real good so if I-I must say
Who's car is this? I'm a little curious
So I stepped on the gas, fast and furious (Out!)
Wasn't impressed with the way he burned rubber
The car phone rang Yo, who is it? Your mother
On the phone wild'n, the way my moms sounded
There was no way to avoid being grounded
I can't believe it, I just made a mistake
Well, parents are the same
No matter time or place
So to you all the kids, across the land
Take from me, parents just don't understand (Out!)

Na, na! (C'mon!)
They don't understand (Na, na, they don't understand)
They ain't gon' get it, no, no, if you feel me
Holla all you kids across the land (Uh!)

They ain't gon' get it, no, no, if you feel me
Holla all you kids across the land (Out!)
Na, na! (C'mon!)

They ain't gon' get it, no, no, if you feel me
Holla all you kids across the land (Uh!)
