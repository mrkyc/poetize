The girlies, yeah they love me, they shove and push to touch me
I love em back but i'm too young to be soo lovey dubby
I'm still my momma baby
Haters, ya'll can't hate me
She say iam just like my father
Never stop thinking, calls me a work-a-hollic
If i'm not in my booth or if i'm not writing rhymes
If i ain't shooting hoops..then i'm losing my mind
See i gotta make A's or B's or my parents won't let me leave
They'll get real disapointed in me, try to take my car keys
And my friends outside screaming....
(Chorus)
(Romeo)
Bounce wit me, bounce wit me, bounce wit me, bounce wit me.....
Bounce wit me, bounce wit me, bounce wit me, bounce wit me.....
Head bobs, head bobs, shoulders moving, shoulders moving.....
Head bobs, head bobs, shoulders moving, shoulders moving.....
