Okay okay
 I love you Romeoooo
 You my Juliette girl Come on

Love has truly been good to me
Not even one sad day of memories I had
Since you come my way
I hope you know I'll gladly go
Anywhere you take me ain't no limit to this love
I'll follow you to the moon and the sky above

The first time I met you
I didn't sweat you
My Juliet I knew that I catch you
Gave you the key to my heart you unlocked it
A perfect match you the plug im the socket
As time moved on we became friends
I knew was love at first sight and it wasn't 'bout to get wit this
You was there when I needed you
I remember writing letters on the road I wanna be wit you
I know we young and we got time
Little soldiers need love so girl I want to make you mine
We could roll together, go to shows together
My best friend girl lets grow together
You might also like
Love has truly been good to me
Not even one sad day of memories I had
Since you come my way
I hope you know I'll gladly go
Anywhere you take me ain't no limit to this love
I'll follow you to the moon and the sky above

We could walk together rode buses together
Ya moms call jellybeans things we stuck together
We at park playin' hide-go-seek
I find you, or you find me
This was meant to be
They call us little one and shorty
Find us hugged up at every school party
We study together, ball together
Somebody said cupid must've brought us together
I love your cute eyes and you love my tight braids
Play video games almost everyday
And when we not together we on the phone
Talkin' 'bout our first kiss and we don't wanna be alone

Love has truly been good to me
Not even one sad day of memories I had
Since you come my way
I hope you know I'll gladly go
Anywhere you take me ain't no limit to this love
I'll follow you to the moon and the sky above
And I remember so well how your smile
Made me feel bright like the sun shine
I'm so glad that you mine, you my Juliet
I never let the jealous ones between and that's a safe bet
And we could get to studyin after school is over
Homework is a must so we can come over
And Afterwards we could hit the mall sip ices and cotton candy
And after that come chill wit da family

Got to tell you how you have me
I'm so happy that you came in here and changed my world
Bye Bye sadness hello Romeyyyy
You're the only boy that got Solange in so in love
