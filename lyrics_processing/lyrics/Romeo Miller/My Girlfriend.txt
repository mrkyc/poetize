Look I dun traveled all over the globe, different countries, different area codes. Whether its
Shooting movies or rock the show, I mean I meet a nice girl every where that I go. Shouts out to
Halie up in Cali, Tammy and Brandy my girls in Miami
Whenever I'm in town they treat me like family, I can't forget about my girl named Sandy. "Who's
That" my girl from N.Y., Told me whenever I'm in town to swing by. Real love coming from real
Fans. In every arena they be filling up the stands. They in the airport as soon as my plane
Lands, I wanna hug them all and kiss every one of their hands

Ok, on tour, city to city, Its hard for me to leave cuz they all so pretty, I wish my bus was
Big enough to bring them all wit me. Exchange phone numbers and tell them all to hit me, But
There ain't enough time in the day, for it to go down that way
Open all my fan mail and read every thing they say, I'll never let you down and in my heart you
Will stay. Yeah, wherever I'm at wherever I go, Yeah, North, South, East, or west coast Preparing
For touring in Tokyo, i got love for the girls, I just want them to know That I appreciated
