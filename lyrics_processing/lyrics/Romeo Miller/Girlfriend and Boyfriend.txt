I wanna ask you one question You wanna be my Juliet
Or other words we could just be friends lala lala lalalaaa (girl)
Mary had a boyfriend his name was romeo
And everywhere dat romie went dem girls were sure to go

(boy) I'll be your boyfriend
(girl) I'll be your girlfriend
(boy) I'll be your boyfriend
(girl) I'll be your girlfriend
If I be your boy would you be my girl
If I be your boy would you be my girl
If I be your boy would you be my girl
If I be your boy would you be my girl

I'm lookin for a girl who can touch my heart
Someone pretty quiet she gotta be smart
Hair curly demples beautiful smile
Sence of humor sweet to shy to be wild
Likes music from top of her grades A student
A dyme from her head to her toe shot by cupid
Write letters to let me know how she feel
One of a kind good team you know that she's real
My juliet call her my baby boo
Ain't know other girl made me feel like you
You always on time you know that you mine
When I first met you ma I knew it was real
I'm thinking movies and popcorn whats tha deal
I'm a lilsoulja so we all need love
You be tha baseball I be tha glove
I mean after school we could walk together
Here's my 2way girl we could talk forever
Who cares you care we like Ja' and Ashanti

Long hikes even got his and her rights
I wouldn't know what to do if she was out of my life
We been together so long she considered my wife
Got alot in common she even likes what I likes
Takes pictures she hangs wit my sisters
The lovable type lots of hugs and kisses
I take time off just ta be wit my girl
Six flags dis is on she's apart of my world
The feeling was on we could paint together
If love is like ice we could bling together
My lucky charm I mean my four clovers
We young now but I can't wait until older

(boy) I'll be your boyfriend
