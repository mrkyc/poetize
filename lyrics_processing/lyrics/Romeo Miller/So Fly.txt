Boy you soo fly

(Verse 1 - Lil' Romeo)
Now, me and my pop we in the finer things
Still, in every rings we designin' things
Like girls, diamonds I never change
I keep my girl to the best of things yep
Just, pop the benz now I'm about the new reins
I'm like the bombs on street I'm always lookin' for change
And I on't know what it is about me
But all the little ladies seem to really like me
Much be the deans little Master P
And it's no contest cuz we the best
By mote y'all dress man we impress
No window shoppin' we invest so
Lil dude always on his tip of toes
Y'all make money yeah we earn them doing shows
Im a baller you already know
I was born to be a fly thats the way I roll yeah

(Verse 2 - Lil' Romeo)
Now once in a while here I'm kinda fly
All the pretty girls they just speak thier mind
When I'm, tourin' the world just ridin' around
Going to the store now I'm gettin' chased around
I ont' know what it is could it be the smell?
From up top north to the dirty south yeah
Just flowin' all over my home
There's nothin' but plex, platinum and gold ones
I do it for the kids out there
My stallion really care
As long as I'm leashed, in my P miller gear
We gon' be too hard to stop this year
There's soo much too hot to touch
This winner, too cold to cool off
You could catch my flow I'm not with Ruledof
What I'm tryna say I can't stop the tank dog yeah
(Chorus - Intyana)
Boy you soo fly
Boy you soo fly
I'm gon' make you mine. (what?)
Boy you soo fly
Boy you soo fly
I'm gon' make you mine
(Verse 3 - Lil' Romeo)
Getcha hands up, throw your hands up up
Getcha hands up, throw your hands up up
Where the west at? Where the north at?
Where the south at? Where the east at?
Getcha hands up, c'mon
