And it leads to the heart of you
I don't know whatever made me so afraid
I look back to my childhood
But you know it does me no good
I've already lived through my past
And all of the things that I thought would last
Take a walk around the bend
Of a road that does not end
By the light of an old street lamp
In the rain I wade again
Strange shapes, strange shadows
Strange faces that the wind blows
You catch me as I run away
Through the rain I hear you say
Come with me
Take my hand
Through the milk and honey of a broken promise land
Side by side
Don't say no
Time will tell our secrets everywhere we go
Now the streets we walk are still
And the rain is gone away
And I don't know whatever made me so afraid
One wish, harden hearts
In the beginning there were false starts
I know that in the end
All I want is a good true friend
You might also likeCome with me
Take my hand
Through the milk and honey of a broken promise land
Side by side
Don't say no
Time will tell our secrets everywhere we go
So many people we never will meet
So many hills we will never climb
But I will be by you on the dead end street
One more last chance
One more time
Come with me
Take my hand
Through the milk and honey of a broken promise land
Side by side
Don't say no
Time will tell our secrets everywhere we go
Come with me
Take my hand
Through the milk and honey of a broken promise land
Side by side
Don't say no
Time will tell our secrets everywhere we go
Come with me
Take my hand
Through the milk and honey of a broken promise land
Side by side
Don't say no
