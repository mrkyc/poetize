That's impossible, that's imposs...
That's impossible, that's impossible
'Cause you're in New York, but I'm not
You're in Tokyo, but I'm not
You're in Nova Scotia, but I'm not
Yeah, you're everywhere that I'm not
Yeah, you're everywhere that I'm not
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not
I thought I felt your touch
In my car on my clutch
But I guess, it was just someone
Who felt a lot like I remember you do
'Cause that's impossible, that's im...
That's impossible, that's imposs...
That's impossible, that's impossible
