I could never tell you
What it meant to me
Just to know
That you were nearby
Well, I've decided
To put away my fear
I've got to tell you
At least I wanna try

I love you in a way
That scares me and scars me
I love you in a way that won't let me sleep at night
I love you in a way that leaves me in confusion
I love you in a way that keeps on changing my mind

Yes, I love you
Yes, I do
Yes, I love you
Yes, I do

So many people
Have secret feelings
But I can't hide it
Anymore, you see
I think about you
Almost always
And you're becoming
Another part of me
You might also like
I love you in a way that scares me and scars me
I love you in a way that hides me in confusion
I love you in a way that falls all around me
I love you in a way that won't let me sleep at night

Yes, I love you
Yes, I do
I guess I love you
Yes, I do

And I guess you might love me too

People lie a lot
Myself included
But not this time around
I really mean it
I think about you
Almost always
You're another part of me
That's how I've seen it

I love you in a way that scares me and scars me
I love you in a way that won't let me sleep at night
I love you in a way that leaves me in confusion
I love you in a way that keeps on changing my mind
Yes, I love you
Yes, I do
Yes, I love you
Yes, I do
Yes, I love you
Yes, I do
I guess I love you
