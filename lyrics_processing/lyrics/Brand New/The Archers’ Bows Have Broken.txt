Who do you carry the torch for, my young man?
Do you believe in anything?
Do you carry it around just to burn things down?
Meet me tonight on the turnpike, my darling
'Cause we believe in everything
If we sweat all these debts, then we're sure to drown
So, we strap ourselves up to this engine now
With a God who we found laying under the backseat

What did you learn tonight?
You're shouting so loud, you barely joyous, broken thing
You're a voice that never sings, is what I say
You are freezing over hell
You are bringing on the end, you do so well
You can only blame yourself, is what I say

(Oh!)
Order your daughters to ignore me, think that will sort me
And sweep me under the rug, ah
You're beating with a book everyone
That book tells you to love
Ah, there is an ember in the heart of the kiln
And it's burning hot with love
Burning out my center 'til there's nothing but dust
Rollin' me with care into your cigarette
'Cause the God I believe in never worked on a campaign trail
You might also like
What did you learn tonight?
You're shouting so loud, you barely joyous, broken thing
You're a voice that never sings, is what I say
You are freezing over hell
You are bringing on the end, you do so well
You can only blame yourself, is what I say


Who do you carry that torch for, my young man?
Do you believe in anything?
Or do you carry it around just to burn things to the ground?

What did you learn tonight?
You're shouting so loud, you barely joyous, broken thing
You're a voice that never sings, is what I say
You are freezing over hell
You are bringing on the end, you do so well
You can only blame yourself, is what I say

Feels like we could escape it
(What did you learn tonight?)
I might throw it away
(You're shouting so loud, you barely joyous, broken thing)
For a filthy silver song
(You're a voice that never sings, is what I say)
If you tried running the maze
(You are freezing over hell)
Of your lives, it's you are to say
(You are bringing on the end, you do so well)
That you've thrown out everyone
