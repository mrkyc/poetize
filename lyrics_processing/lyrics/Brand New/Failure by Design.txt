Watch you on the ones and twos
Through a window in a well lit room
Become a recluse
And I blame myself because I make things hard
And you're just trying to help
And when I wake up you're the first to call
This is one more late night basement song
And I'm so sore
My voice has gone to hell
And this is one more sleepless night because

We don't believe in filler, baby
If I could I'd sit this out

(This is over)
This is a lesson in procrastination
(When I say it's over)
I kill myself because I'm so frustrated
And every single second that I put it off
Means another lonely night I gotta race the clock
(I ignore it)
What say we go and crash your car?
(And it ignores me too)
And every time I leave you go and lock the door
And I walk myself picking at a chip on my shoulder
I'm another day late and one year older
It's failure by design
You might also like
And we just want sleep
But this night is hell
I'm sick and sunk and I blame myself
Because I make things hard and you were trying to help
I got no gas (no gas)
I'm winding out my gears
This is one more day on the verge of tears
And now my head hurts (head hurts)
And my health is a joke
Now I gotta stop because the headphones broke

We don't believe in filler, baby
If I could I'd sit this out

(This is over)
This is a lesson in procrastination
(When I say it's over)
I kill myself because I'm so frustrated
And every single second that I put it off
Means another lonely night I gotta race the clock
(I ignore it)
What say we go and crash your car?
(And it ignores me too)
And every time I leave you go and lock the door
And I walk myself picking at a chip on my shoulder
I'm another day late and one year older
It's failure by design
I'm out of everything
No one sleeps till we get this shit out on the shelves
It's late, I'm faltering
But this time I got nothing to say besides
Doo doo doo, doo doo doo
Doo doo doo, doo doo doo (Baby, I'm better than this)
Doo doo doo, doo doo doo
Doo doo doo, doo doo doo (Baby, I'm better than this)
Doo doo doo, doo doo doo
Doo doo doo, doo doo doo (Baby, I'm better than this)
Doo doo doo, doo doo doo
Nothing to say besides

(This is over)
This is a lesson in procrastination
(When I say it's over)
I kill myself because I'm so frustrated
And every single second that I put it off
Means another lonely night I gotta race the clock
(I ignore it)
What say we go and crash your car?
(And it ignores me too)
And every time I leave you go and lock the door
And I walk myself picking at a chip on my shoulder
I'm another day late and one year older
