I am heaven sent
Don't you dare forget
I am all you've ever wanted
What all the other boys all promised
Sorry I told
I just needed you to know
I think in decimals and dollars
I am the cause to all your problems
Shelter from cold
We are never alone
Coordinate brain and mouth
Then ask me what it's like to have myself so figured out
I wish I knew

I hope this song starts a craze
The kinda song that ignites the airwaves
The kinda song that makes people glad to be where they are
With whoever they're there with
This is war
Every line is about who I don't wanna write about anymore
Hope you come down with something they can't diagnose
Don't have the cure for
Holding on to your grudge
Oh, it's so hard to have someone to love
And keeping quiet is hard
'Cause you can't keep a secret
If it never was a secret to start
At least pretend you didn't wanna get caught

We're concentrating on falling apart
We were contenders, we're throwing the fight
I just wanna believe
I just wanna believe
I just wanna believe
In us

Oh, we're so c-c-c-c-c-controversial
We are entirely smooth
We admit to the truth
We are the best at what we do
And these are the words you wish you wrote down
This is the way you wish your voice sounds
Handsome and smart
Oh, my tongue's the only muscle on my body
That works harder than my heart
And it's all from watching TV
And from speeding up my breathing
Wouldn't stop if I could
Oh, it hurts to be this good
You're holding on to your grudge
Oh, it hurts to always have to be
Honest with the one that you love
Oh, so let it go
We're concentrating on falling apart
We were contenders, we're throwing the fight
I just wanna believe
I just wanna believe
I just wanna believe
We're concentrating on falling apart
We were contenders, we're throwing the fight
I just wanna believe
I just wanna believe
I just wanna believe
In us

This is the grace only we can bestow
This is the price you pay for loss of control
This is the break in the bend
This is the closest of calls
This is the reason you're alone
This is the rise and the fall!

We're concentrating on falling apart
We were contenders, we're throwing the fight
I just wanna believe
I just wanna believe
I just wanna believe
We're concentrating on falling apart
We were contenders, we're throwing the fight
I just wanna believe
I just wanna believe
I just wanna believe
