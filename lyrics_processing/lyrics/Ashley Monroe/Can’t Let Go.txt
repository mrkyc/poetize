Well it's over baby I know it but I can't let go
I'm like a fish out of water, a cat in a tree, you dont even
Wanna talk to me,well it's over,I know it but I can't let go
You wanna take me back,when I come around you say your sorry
Then you push me out,I got a big chain around my neck and
I'm broken down like a train wreck,well it's over but, I know but I can't let go
See I got a candle it burns so bright,in my window every night well
It's over, I know it but I can't let go
You dont have to see me standing around, feel like I've been shot
But didn't fall down, well it's over, I know it but I can't let go
You wanna take me back,when I come around (hey) you say your sorry
Then you push me out, I got a big chain around my neck and
Im broken down like a train wreck,well it's over, I know but I can't let go
You turn off the trouble like you turn off a light,went off and
Left me it just ain't right,well it's over I know it but I can't let go
Yeah round every corner there's something I see and it brings
It right back to how it used to be,well it's over,I know it but I can't let go
