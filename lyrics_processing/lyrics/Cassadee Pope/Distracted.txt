Sorry, gonna have to get you to repeat what you just said
'Cause I wasn't listening
I was too busy wondering where you're gonna take me next
Musta checked out for a second

It's becoming a thing, yeah, it happens a lot
I got my head up in the clouds
Ain't tryna complain, I don't want it to stop
But baby whenever you're around

You got me distracted
It's the only way for me to explain the way that I'm acting
I got a one track mind when you're looking at me
I can't focus, I can't think
I got lovesick ADD
No, I can't look away, that face got me held captive
You got me distracted

You got me calling cancelling plans
All week I'm dreaming 'bout the weekend
Priorities, they don't stand a chance
Against those hands

It's becoming a thing, yeah, it happens a lot
I got my head up in the clouds
Ain't tryna complain, I don't want it to stop
It's all of the time, even right now

You got me distracted
It's the only way for me to explain the way that I'm acting
I got a one track mind when you're looking at me
I can't focus, I can't think
I got lovesick ADD
No, I can't look away, that face got me held captive
You got me distracted, you got me distracted

Sorry, gonna have to get you to repeat what you just said
'Cause I wasn't listening

You got me distracted
It's the only way for me to explain the way that I'm acting
I got a one track mind when you're looking at me
I can't focus, I can't think
I got lovesick ADD
No, I can't look away, that face got me held captive
Yeah, you got me distracted, oh, you got me distracted, yeah
You got me distracted, distracted
