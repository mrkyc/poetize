La la la
La la la
La la la

Sneakin' out the bedroom
Cursin', trippin' on his stuff
Lookin' for my car keys while I'm pullin' my jeans up
I make sure I'm out before
I turn my phone back on
I've got five missed calls
Can't believe what I just did
I lost myself tonight
But I just gotta get to you
The guilt's making me drive
I stumble in, I wake you up
But when you look at me
I just can't speak

'Cause you're the only one, the only one
Who ever gave a damn
And it's killing me to know you think
I'm better than I am
Came over here to tell the truth
But looking in your eyes
Baby, sometimes, it's easier to lie
You might also like
You know that I've been crying
So you ask what's going on
Your arms around my shoulder
You got no clue what I've done
'Cause you don't see the guilt in me
And that just makes it worse
Yeah, that just makes it worse

'Cause you're the only one, the only one
Who ever gave a damn
And it's killing me to know you think
I'm better than I am
Came over here to tell the truth
But looking in your eyes
Baby, sometimes, it's easier to lie
It's easier to lie, oh
It's so easy

I can't believe what I just did
I lost myself tonight

'Cause you're the only one, the only one
Who ever gave a damn
And it's killing me to know you think
I'm better than I am
Came over here to tell the truth
But looking in your eyes
Baby, sometimes, it's easier to lie
'Cause you're the only one, the only one
Who ever gave a damn
And it's killing me to know you think
I'm better than I am
Came over here to tell the truth
But looking in your eyes
