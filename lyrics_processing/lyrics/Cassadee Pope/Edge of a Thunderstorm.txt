Something's gathering in the sky
I see lightning in your eyes
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Move in closer, next to me
I wanna feel that electricity
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Inside, my heart is beating fast
Feels like something's coming

Maybe I'm gonna get swept away
I'll worry 'bout that some sunny day
'Cause I can't wait to taste that rain, ooh whoa
Whatever this night is stirring up
It's gonna be a wild, undeniable love
Hold me, keep me warm
Like we're standing on the edge of a thunderstorm
We're standing on the edge of a thunderstorm, oh

I'll tell you right now, I never felt like this
The touch of your hand, the thought of your kiss
Yeah, yeah, yeah
It's a powerful thing washing over me
I'm reminding myself, "Don't forget to breathe"
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You might also like
So right, the way you look at me
Feels like something's coming

Maybe I'm gonna get swept away
I'll worry 'bout that some sunny day
'Cause I can't wait to taste that rain, whoa, oh
Whatever this night is stirring up
It's gonna be a wild, undeniable love
Hold me, keep me warm
Like we're standing on the edge of a thunderstorm
Like we're standing on the edge

Ain't no shadow of a doubt
This is what I dreamed about
Bring it on, I'm ready now

Maybe I'm gonna get swept away
I'll worry 'bout that some sunny day
'Cause I can't wait to taste that rain, whoa, oh
Whatever this night is stirring up
It's gonna be a wild, undeniable love
Hold me, keep me warm
I said hold me, keep me warm
Like we're standing on the edge of a thunderstorm
Like we're standing on the edge of a thunderstorm
A thunderstorm, whoa
Hold me, keep me
