If you don't wanna know if I miss you
If I still think about us
If you don't wanna know if I listen closer
Every time your name comes up
I could say I'm doin' alright, I'm happy with the new guy
But you know it when I lie

So don't ask me if I wake up in the mornin'
Wishin' that your arms where the ones that were holdin' me
Don't ask me if I missed ya
Ask me if I wished you were takin' my hand when it's time to leave
Don't even question if I still question the way that we left everything
'Cause my answer may not be the one that you want it to be
If you don't wanna know boy, don't ask me

If you don't wanna hear how it hurts to see you out with somebody new
Lookin' at her like you used to look at me
If you don't wanna see me break down here right now

Then don't ask me if I wake up in the mornin'
Wishin' that your arms where the ones that were holdin' me
Don't ask me if I missed ya
Ask me if I wished you were takin' my hand when it's time to leave
Don't even question if I still question the way that we left everything
'Cause my answer may not be the one that you want it to be
If you don't wanna know boy, don't ask me, yeah
Ah, don't ask me
You might also like
I don't wanna have to tell ya I'm goin' through hell
I don't think I could bring myself to wish you well
So don't ask me

No don't ask me if I wake up in the mornin'
Wishin' that your arms where the ones that were holdin' me
Don't ask me if I missed ya
Ask me if I wished you were takin' my hand when it's time to leave
Don't even question if I still question the way that we left everything
'Cause my answer may not be the one that you want it to be
If you don't wanna know boy, don't ask me, yeah
Ah, don't ask me
