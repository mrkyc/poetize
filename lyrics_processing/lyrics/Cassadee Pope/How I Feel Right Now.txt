Life's got seasons
Some are hot and some are freezin'
And baby, after last weekend
You've got my temperature risin' and I just wanna drive
And listen to that red album, old Third Eye Blind
And soak in the semi-charmed life

Yeah, that's just how I feel right now
Catchin' feels right now
Move a little lighter on my heels right now
I ain't tryin' to brag but I can't help myself
'Cause that's just how I feel right now
You got me flyin' high right now
Cloud nine right now
Hands up, 'cause your love's a ride right now
Tomorrow might be different I might come back down
But that's just how I feel right now
Feel right now

I'm more than okay
Happy hour tipsy on a Monday
Funny how it changes after one day
It wasn't that long ago, I was at the end of my rope
But you gave my story a twist
Yeah, one kiss and you flipped the script
You might also like
Yeah, that's how I feel right now
Catchin' feels right now
Move a little lighter on my heels right now
I ain't tryin' to brag but I can't help myself
'Cause that's just how I feel right now
You got me flyin' high right now
Cloud nine right now
Hands up, 'cause your love's a ride right now
Tomorrow might be different I might come back down
But that's just how I feel right now
Feel right now
Feel right now

Dancin' in the parkin' lot
I don't care, let 'em watch
I don't know why

Yeah, that's how I feel right now
Catchin' feels right now
Move a little lighter on my heels right now
I ain't tryin' to brag but I can't help myself
'Cause that's just how I feel right now
You got me flyin' high right now
Cloud nine right now
Hands up, 'cause your love's a ride right now
Tomorrow might be different I might come back down
But that's just how I feel right now
Feel right now
I feel right now
Tomorrow might be different I might come back down
But that's just how I feel right now
