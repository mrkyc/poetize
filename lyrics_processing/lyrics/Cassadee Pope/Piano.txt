I was fragile, I was nervous
I was flawed and you were perfect
I was timid, you were fearless
I was in it, you could feel it
You were music, I was listenin'
Not a beat that you were missin'
I got so caught up in the way you sound

You played me like a piano
You made it sound pretty, stringin' me along
I fell for every note
Guess I didn't know it was a heartbreak song
I'm not a stupid girl, I should have known
I let you play me like a piano, oh

You played me like a piano

It would feel good for a minute
Just a scream, but you won't hear it
And the truth is this is my fault
All the big things started out small
All of a sudden, I had two hearts
One was so blind, one was too smart
And the weakest part of me wouldn't let go
You might also like
Oh, you played me like a piano
You made it sound pretty, stringin' me along
I fell for every note
Guess I didn't know it was a heartbreak song
I'm not a stupid girl, I should have known
I let you play me like a piano, oh

You played me like a piano, oh-oh

Thank you and I guess I'll thank myself
Smart girls don't let this kind of thing happen twice
I'll never let anyone else

Played me like a piano
You made it sound pretty, stringin' me along (You made it sound pretty)
I fell for every note
Guess I didn't know it was a heartbreak song (A heartbreak song)
I'm not a stupid girl, I should have known (Oh, I shoulda known)
I let you play me like a piano, oh

You played me like a piano, oh-oh
I fell for every note
You played me like, you played me like a piano
Yeah
