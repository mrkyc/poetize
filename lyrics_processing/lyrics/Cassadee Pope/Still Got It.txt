Flew home only here for the weekend
Didn't think I'd run into you
Life is good, doin' fine, how have you been?
I see you got a couple new tattoos
Time and tears go by
But you look in my eyes
And I go back in time
'Cause seein' you here after all of these years

Still got it with your shy boy grin
And your sun tanned skin just glowin', glowin'
Still got it in your Stones t-shirt and the way you flirt
And you don't even know it
Only here a couple days, I don't got no time to waste
Don't wanna hide it babe, I got a confession to make
If you wonder where my heart is, if you want it
Well, baby you still got it, yeah, you still got it
If you want it, babe, you still got it
You still got it, yeah, you still got it
If you want it

Take me down to the pier like you used to
Flashin' back to 17 again
Hands brush accidentally right on cue
Still as electric as it was back then
Watch, you watch the sky
With your constellation eyes
And I go back in time
Of fallin' into this second-chance first kiss
You might also like
Still got it with your shy boy grin
And your sun tanned skin just glowin', glowin'
Still got it in your Stones t-shirt and the way you flirt
And you don't even know it
Only here a couple days, I don't got no time to waste
Don't wanna hide it, babe, I got a confession to make
If you wonder where my heart is, if you want it
Well, baby, you still got it, yeah, you still got it
If you want it, babe, you still got it

Everything fades, burns out
But you got a way
Of finding me in my dreams at night
Everything's changed, guess one thing stayed the same
Still into you after all of this time

Still got it with your shy boy grin
And your sun tanned skin just glowin', glowin'
Still got it in your Stones t-shirt and the way you flirt
And you don't even know it
Only here a couple days, I don't got no time to waste
Don't wanna hide it, babe, I got a confession to make
If you wonder where my heart is, if you want it
Well, baby, you still got it, yeah you still got it
If you want, it babe, you still got it
You still got it, yeah, you still got it
If you want it, babe, you still got it
You still got it, yeah, you still got it
