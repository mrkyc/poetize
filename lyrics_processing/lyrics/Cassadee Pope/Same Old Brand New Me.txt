My mom never changed my old bedroom
It's the same place, same posters on the wall
CD poetry by Blink-182
Makin' its way into my songs
Ran away from home, had to hit the road
Put some miles on this heart and made it gold
Every exit sign was a reason why
I still believe in Rock 'n' Roll

No matter where I go or where I've been
I know my soul beyond my skin
Wherever it takes me, I know it won't break me
'Cause I'll always be, the same old brand new me

I've been talkin' with my old tattoo
Doesn't say the things that it used to say before
Yeah, we reminisce and we laugh about
How to forget a whole world tour
Life's happenin', it's goin' so fast
When it's slowin' down, you just wanna make it last
Like the first taste of a first kiss
Once you lean in, you can't look back
You might also like
No matter where I go or where I've been
I know my soul beyond my skin
Wherever it takes me, I know it won't break me
'Cause I'll always be, the same old brand new me

Whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh

Gonna keep my heart forever young (Whoa-oh-oh-oh)
It ain't over even when it's done (Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh)
And on every trip around the sun (Whoa-oh-oh-oh)
I'm always home (Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh)

No matter where I go or where I've been
I know my soul beyond my skin
Wherever it takes me, I know it won't break me
'Cause I'll always be, the same old brand new me
Oh, no matter where I go or where I've been
I know my soul beyond my skin
Wherever it takes me, I know it won't break me
'Cause I'll always be, the same old brand new me
Oh-oh, the same old brand new me
