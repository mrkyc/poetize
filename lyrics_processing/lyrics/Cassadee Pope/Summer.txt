Oh

Rolled in as wild and free
As a Clearwater-beach-at-seventeen memory
Eyes blue as the July sky
Sent shivers down my spine every time that he'd smile at me

The way he took off that white T-shirt
The way he looked walkin' out of that water
And it just got hotter and hotter

The tan line's fadin' on my sun-kissed skin
Hits me like a wave when I think about it
Sublime on the boombox (Woo)
Our bare feet in the sand
Makin' out on the boardwalk
My heart on fire in his hands, yeah
He drove away the first of September
But I remember, yeah, I remember
He talked like, and he walked like, and he looked like
And he burned like summer, summer
Ooh, ooh
And he burned like summer, summer
Ooh, ooh
You might also like
His kiss was a sweet salt breeze
Had a hold on me like the moon pulls the tide
Took me up on the ferris wheel
And I swear it feels like I never came down from the high

I know we never said forever
But somethin' 'bout it felt like it would never end

The tan line's fadin' on my sun-kissed skin
Hits me like a wave when I think about it
Sublime on the boombox (Woo)
Our bare feet in the sand
Makin' out on the boardwalk
My heart on fire in his hands, yeah
He drove away the first of September
But I remember, yeah, I remember
He talked like, and he walked like, and he looked like
And he burned like summer, summer

Oh, bottle rocket sparks in the Florida sky
Summer, summer
Somethin' that bright's gotta burn out sometime
The tan line's fadin' on my sun-kissed skin
Hits me like a wave when I think about it
Sublime on the boombox (Woo)
Our bare feet in the sand
Makin' out on the boardwalk
My heart on fire in his hands, yeah
He drove away the first of September
But I remember, yeah, I remember
He talked like, and he walked like, and he looked like
And he burned like summer, summer
Yeah
He burned like summer, summer
