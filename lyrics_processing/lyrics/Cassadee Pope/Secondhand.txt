I know that look, I know those eyes
She broke you down again
I'm not surprised
Every time you show up here again
Hands in your pocket, heart on your sleeve
Tell me all about what you need
Lean in close, but I'll take what I can get

Breathe you in, breathe you in like my first cigarette
Breathe you out, breathe you out, turning off the regret
Don't worry, baby, 'cause it's all my fault
I'll take the part that she doesn't want
Breathe you in, breathe you in, take the spark with the smoke
Breathe you out, breathe you out, feel the rush as I choke
I know it's worth it, baby, even if it's just
Secondhand, secondhand love

My heart has no pride standing here
Good thing I can take the tears
Sew you up as I'm tearing at the seams
It's so good, yeah, while it lasts
You might also likeGo ahead and strike the match
Burn me down, make ashes out of me, yeah

Breathe you in, breathe you in like my first cigarette
Breathe you out, breathe you out, turning off the regret
Don't worry, baby, 'cause it's all my fault
I'll take the part that she doesn't want
Breathe you in, breathe you in, take the spark with the smoke
Breathe you out, breathe you out, feel the rush as I choke
I know it's worth it, baby, even if it's just
Secondhand, secondhand love

I know that you're no good for me
You make me weak as I can be
Bad habits; there is just no breaking free

Breathe you in, breathe you in like my first cigarette
Breathe you out, breathe you out, turning off the regret
Don't worry, baby, 'cause it's all my fault
I'll take the part that she doesn't want
Breathe you in, breathe you in, take the spark with the smoke
Breathe you out, breathe you out, feel the rush as I choke
I know it's worth it, baby, even if it's just
Secondhand, secondhand love
Secondhand, secondhand love
