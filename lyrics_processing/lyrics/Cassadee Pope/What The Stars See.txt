Are we really over?
'Cause I'm a couple glasses in
Can't help but want a little bit of closure
Are you waitin' by the phone? Are you out, are you at home?
'Cause I can't stop picturin', what you may or may not be doin'
Wish my eyes could shine down on you

I wanna see what the stars see
Are you good? Are you sad? Are you missing me?
Are you a little bit lonely?
I wanna know what you're feeling underneath
That midnight, moonlight, heartbreak sky
Wishin' I could read your mind
You left me in the dark, and wherever you are, I wanna be
Tonight, I wanna see what the stars see
I wanna see, wanna see

They're so lucky
They know exactly where you are, what you're feelin' in your heart
And if you're sorry
That you're not with me tonight, that you ever said goodbye

I wanna see what the stars see
Are you good? Are you sad? Are you missing me?
Are you a little bit lonely?
I wanna know what you're feeling underneath
That midnight, moonlight, heartbreak sky
Wishin' I could read your mind
You left me in the dark, and wherever you are, I wanna be
Tonight, I wanna see what the stars see
Yeah, yeah, I wanna see, wanna see
You might also like
Are you cryin' in your car tryin' not to fall apart?
Are you wondering about me too?
Or are you throwin' 'em back, happy that I'm in the past
Lovin' up on someone new?

I wanna see what the stars see
Are you good? Are you sad? Are you missin' me? Oh
Are you a little bit lonely?
I wanna know what you're feeling underneath (Underneath, yeah)
That midnight, moonlight, heartbreak sky
Wishin' I could read your mind
You left me in the dark (In the dark), and wherever you are, I wanna be
I wanna see what the stars see
Tonight, I wanna see what the stars see

Yeah, ayy, I wanna see, wanna see
I wanna see, wanna see
