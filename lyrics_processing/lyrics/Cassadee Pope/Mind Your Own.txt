Ahem

I got a friend, she's got a girlfriend
People always starin', don't know what they're carin' about
And I got this other friend
Postin' pictures of her baby
Yeah, I see you momma shaming
Sayin' whatever, thinkin' you're clever
I can't help but think that just maybe

If you were happy, you would mind your own business
Start workin' on your heart's sad sickness
These words aren't meant for you, I'm not finished
If you don't like what you hear, quit listening
Let 'em love who they love, let their colors shine through
Let everybody be themselves, what's it gotta do with you?
Why are you so hateful? Why are you so cold?
'Cause if you were happy, you would mind your own, mind your own

I know your type 'cause there's this other guy
Sittin' on his high horse, never thinking before he speaks
Don't get me started on the woman who just can't say
Black lives matter in the same way as hers does
I'm sick of the trash talk, you're all messed up
You might also like
If you were happy, you would mind your own business
Start workin' on your heart's sad sickness
These words aren't meant for you, I'm not finished
If you don't like what you hear, quit listening
Let 'em love who they love, let their colors shine through
Let everybody be themselves, what's it gotta do with you?
Why are you so hateful? Why are you so cold?
'Cause if you were happy, you would mind your own, mind your own

Sayin' whatever, thinking you're clever

If you were happy you would mind your own business
Start workin' on your heart's sad sickness
These words aren't meant for you, I'm not finished
If you don't like what you hear, quit bitching
Let 'em love who they love, let their colors shine through
Let everybody be themselves, what's it gotta do with you?
Why are you so hateful? Why are you so cold?
'Cause if you were happy, you would mind your own, mind your own

Yeah, if you were happy, you would mind your own
Yeah, yeah
