There's something about how you look at me
I can tell that you're for real
My heartbeat pounds and my head spins round
Is this how forever feels?
Gonna take a chance, gonna take your hand
Gonna let the real me show
Baby just sit back and try not to laugh
There's a few things you should know

I'm gonna get jealous
I can get moody when my hair's a mess
And I cry over nothing, oh oh, oh oh
I'm gonna ask all about your ex
Gonna be late 'cause I can't choose which dress
These are things I must confess, oh oh, oh oh
And if you're okay with that then I'm okay with you
And if you'll always have my back I guess we're cool

If I've learned one thing you should never bring
Any secrets into love
'Cause the things you hide they build up inside
And I don't want that for us
I'm a little scared 'cause I wanna share
The best of me with you
But along with that comes a few red flags
You should know what you're getting into
You might also like
I'm gonna get jealous
I can get moody when my hair's a mess
And I cry over nothing, oh oh, oh oh
I'm gonna ask all about your ex
Gonna be late 'cause I can't choose which dress
These are things I must confess, oh oh, oh oh
And if you're okay with that then I'm okay with you
And if you'll always have my back I guess we're cool

Yeah yeah, put my heart out on the table
Yeah yeah, and you didn't run away
Yeah yeah, love me if you're able

Even though I get jealous
I can get moody when my hair's a mess
And I cry over nothing, oh oh, oh oh
I'm gonna ask all about your ex
Gonna be late 'cause I can't choose which dress
These are things I must confess, oh oh, oh oh
And if you're okay with that then I'm okay with you
