Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh baby
La-da-da-da-da, da da da da, yeah

I really don't feel like talking on the phone
And I really don't feel like company at home
Lately, I don't wanna do
The things I used to do
Baby, since I lost you

And I don't want to sing another love song, babe
I don't want to hum another melody
I don't want to live my life without you, babe (Yeah)
It's drivin' me crazy (Crazy)

I really don't feel like smiling anymore
And I haven't had the peace to sleep at all
Ever since you went away
Baby, my whole life has changed
I don't wanna love, and I don't wanna live

And I don't want to sing another love song, baby
I don't want to hum another melody
I don't want to live my life without you, babe (No way)
It's drivin' me crazy (Crazy)

Until I don't wanna laugh, I don't wanna play
I don't wanna talk, have nothing to say
I don't want to tour, forget the show
How can I go on, now that you are gone?

I don't want to (Make a note) sing another love song (Hey), babe
And I don't want to (No way) hum another melody (Hey)
And I don't want to (To live) live my life (No way) without you, babe (I don't give a damn about nothin', babe)
It's drivin' me crazy (Without you by my side, darlin')
I don't want (I) to (Don't wanna) sing another love song, babe
And I don't want to (No way) hum another melody
And I don't want to (Live my life) live my life (No way) without you, babe (Baby, since you've been gone)
It's drivin' me crazy (I've been so all alone)
I don't want (Come back) to (To me) sing another love song (I need some you), babe (Right here)
