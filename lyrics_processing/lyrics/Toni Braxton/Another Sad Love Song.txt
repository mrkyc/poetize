Whoa, oh
Whoa
Oh, whoa
Whoa, oh
Whoa
Oh, whoa
Baby

Since you've been gone, I've been hanging 'round here lately
With my mind messed up
Jumped in my car, tried to clear my mind, didn't help me
I guess I'm all messed up now, baby
As soon as I jumped into my ride
Those memories start to play, yeah
A song comes on, on the radio
And there you are, baby, once again

It's just another sad love song racking my brain like crazy
Guess I'm all torn up
And be it fast or slow, it doesn't let go or shake me
And it's all because of you

Since you've been gone, I keep thinkin' about you, baby
It gets me all choked up
This heart of mine keeps dreamin' of you and it's crazy, babe
You'd think I'd had enough, yeah
As soon as I get you out my head
I'm in my car again, ooh, darling
Just one request from the radio
I'm back in love, sugar, once again
You might also like
It's just another sad love song racking my brain like crazy
Guess I'm all torn up
And be it fast or slow, it doesn't let go or shake me
And it's all because of you
It's just another sad love song racking my brain like crazy (Like crazy, babe)
Guess I'm all torn up
And be it fast or slow, it doesn't let go or shake me
(Whoa, baby)

Here come the strings, then somebody sings
Only takes a beat, and then it starts killin' me, darling
Only takes one note, I tell ya
From that radio, it's just another lonely love song, ooh!

It's just another sad love song racking my brain like crazy
(You know you got me goin')
Guess I'm all torn up (Going crazy, babe)
And be it fast or slow, it doesn't let go or shake me
(Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)

(Whoo, so sad!)
So sad, so sad (Sad, darling)
So sad, a sad love song
(Ooh, I heard it on the radio last night, so sad)
So sad, so sad (Sad, baby)
So sad, a sad love song
(Ooh, you got me singin' another love song all night, darling)
It's just another sad love song racking my brain like crazy (Ooh, and I'm)
Guess I'm all torn up
And be it fast or slow, it doesn't let go or shake me
And it's all because of you

So sad, so sad
So sad, a sad love song (Oh yeah, babe)
(And it's all because of you)
So sad, so sad
