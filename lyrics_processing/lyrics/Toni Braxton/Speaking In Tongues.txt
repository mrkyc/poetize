I know that it's over
But I still reminisce
'Bout the very first time that I saw you
And the first time that we kissed
I still recall the days of good old love we made
Without taking off our clothes
You spoke a language to my body, baby
So universal, you and me talkin', baby

Oh I (Yeah yeah), oh my
Oh la, la la la
Talk to me, baby
La la (You know that), la la
Speaking in tongues, babe, with you
Oh-oh

Maybe we could exchange
A little conversation, yeah
315-37,69 - call me, boy, anytime
Don't need no caller ID, 'cause I won't have anybody
Interrupting our call
Talk dirty to me, baby
Without talking at all
You got me singin', baby
You might also like
Oh I (Ooh yeah), oh my (Oh my my)
Oh la, la la la
Talk to me, baby, babe
La la (Ooh yeah), la la
Speaking in tongues, babe, with you
Oh-oh, whoa

How do we play pretend?
How do we do not sin
And be together, making love forever?
Then I will fantasize
Make you up in my mind
And intimately, I will cry

Hoo, hoo, hoo (Oh I, oh my)
Speaking in tongues, babe, with you (Oh la, la la la)
Hoo-hoo, talk to me, baby
Drive a girl crazy tonight (La la, la la)
Speaking in tongues, babe, with you
Oh-whoa-ooh, yeah
Oh I, oh my (My)
Speaking in tongues, babe, with you (Oh la, la la la)
Talk to me, talk to me, baby
Talk to me, sugar, yeah (La la, la la)
Speaking in tongues, babe, with you
Whoa-oh
Oh I (Oh), oh my (My)
Speaking in tongues, babe, with you (Oh la, la la la)
Boy
La la, la la (Oh yeah)
Speaking in tongues, babe, with you
Oh-oh, whoa
