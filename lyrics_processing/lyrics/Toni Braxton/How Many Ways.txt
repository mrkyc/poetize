How many ways, I love you, let me count the ways
How many ways, I love you, let me count the ways
How many ways, I love you, let me count the ways

You must have been heaven sent to me
'Cause I never knew love like this
You know you make me feel
So good inside and boy, it's a feeling I just can't hide
And the words can't express my gratitude
For each and every little thing you do, oh yeah
I want you to understand, you're all the man
That I love and I know that I need and I want and more
Baby let me count the ways

How many ways, I love you, let me count the ways
How many ways, I love you, let me count the ways

You know you're so very special to me
My my my my baby, I'll never let you go
When I'm with you I feel so free
I could count from one up to ninety nine and still believe
Although sometimes now, baby, we disagree
There ain't never or will ever be another love for me, oh yeah
And I want you to know, I appreciate
All the things that you do when you do what you do for me
Oh yeah babe, darling, let me count the ways
You might also like
How many ways, I love you, let me count the ways
How many ways, I love you, let me count the ways

Let me tell you one, two, I love you, three, four, so much more
Five, six, I can't get enough, get enough of this
Seven let me show you my love and take you to heaven
Eight, nine, ten, let the love over and over and over
And over and over and over again

How many ways, I love you, let me count the ways
