Should I even listen?
Should I even try?
Will I just be hearing the same old lines, baby?
See, it doesn't matter
What you say this time
'Cause our whole relationship is built on one lie
You say things aren't the way they seem
But still, you can't come straight with me
How can you think that you're in love
When you don't know the meaning of it?

Love shoulda brought you
Brought you home last night
You shoulda been with me
Shoulda been right by my side
Baby
If you cared anything for me
Then love woulda brought you to me last night

Gotta hand it to you
You had me there for a while
I was so in love with you, I couldn't see past your smile
Now I smell the coffee
I got a wake-up call
And it left the message that you just don't care at all
You can't expect me to believe that
She does not mean anything
You say that you love only me
Your kind of loving, my darling, I just don't need
You might also like
Love shoulda brought you
Brought you home last night
You shoulda been with me
Shoulda been right by my side
Baby
If you cared anything for me
Then love woulda brought you to me last night
Love shoulda brought you
Brought you home last night
You shoulda been with me
Shoulda been right by my side
Baby
If you cared anything for me
Then you woulda been sincere
And I wouldn't be in tears
And love woulda brought you to me last night

Oh, baby, why?
Why do men think
That love's just for the moment
Not overtime?
Please tell me why
Why should I think that you're gonna be sincere?
Are you deserving?
Don't blame me if I just don't believe it
Just don't believe that you'll always be here
Love shoulda brought you
Brought you home last night
You shoulda been with me
Shoulda been right by my side
Baby
If you cared anything for me
Then love woulda brought you to me last night
Love shoulda brought you
Brought you home last night
You shoulda been with me
Shoulda been right by my side
Baby
If you cared anything for me
Then love woulda brought you to me last night
Love shoulda brought you
Brought you home last night
You shoulda been with me
Shoulda been right by my side
Baby
If you cared anything for me
Then love woulda brought you to me last night
Love shoulda brought you
Brought you home last night
You shoulda been with me
Shoulda been right by my side
Baby
If you cared anything for me
