First thing Monday morning
I'm gonna pack my tears away
Got no cause to look back
I'm lookin' for me a better day

See, the thing 'bout love
Is that it's not enough
If the only thing it brings you is pain
There comes a time when we could all make a change, darling

Just let go
Let it flow, let it flow, let it flow
Everything's gonna work out right, you know
Just let go (Whoo)
Let it flow, let it flow, let it flow
Just let it go (Baby)

Don't nobody want no broke hearts
And don't nobody want no two-time losers, oh no
Oh, ain't nobody gonna love you like you are
If you take whatever he brings your way
Oh, no, no, no
You might also like
See, the thing of it
Is we deserve respect
But we can't demand respect without change
There comes a time when we must go our own way

Just let go (Let it flow, baby, baby)
Let it flow, let it flow, let it flow
Everything's gonna work out right, you know
Just let go (Let it go, let it go, baby)
Let it flow, let it flow, let it flow
Just let it go (Oh, oh-yeah)

'Cause sometimes love can work out right, right now
And sometimes you'll never know it
You're never ever gonna know it
But if it brings you pain in your life
Don't be afraid to let it go

Just let go (Oh yeah)
Let it flow, let it flow, let it flow (Let it flow right out, ooh)
Everything's gonna work out right, you know
Just let go (You know this, said to let it go now, now darling)
Let it flow, let it flow, let it flow (Ooh)
Just let it go (Right)
Just let go (I wanna sing la-la-la, la-la la-la)
Let it flow, let it flow, let it flow (Let it flow, la-la-la, la-la la-la)
Let it flow, let it flow, baby
Just let go (La-la-la, la-la la-la)
Let it flow, let it flow, let it flow (Let it flow, la-la-la, la-la la-la)
Just let it go (Let it flow, let it flow, baby)
Just let go (La-la-la, la-la la-la)
Let it flow, let it flow, let it flow (Let it flow, la-la-la, la-la la-la)
Let it flow, let it flow, baby
Just let go (La-la-la, la-la la-la)
Let it flow, let it flow, let it flow (Let it flow, la-la-la, la-la la-la)
Just let it go
Let it flow, let it flow, baby
Just let go (Hey-yeah, said to let it go, darling)
Let it flow, let it flow, let it flow (Let it go, baby)
(I don't wanna break my heart)
