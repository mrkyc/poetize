Mmm, mmm
Hey, yeah

It only took a moment, a solitary glance
And I could hear the voice of rapture call
I've loved you from a distance, afraid to take a chance
But now, it seems I can't help but to fall

Imagine my surprise
To open up my eyes
And find that you were looking back

And suddenly, I cannot remember who I used to be
And like the rain, this yearning washes over me
And all the pain I knew before has gone
And suddenly, I'm no longer drifting on an empty sea
And now I know that I believe in destiny
And mine is waiting right here in your arms

I long to wake beside you and bathe in love's abyss
Washing all that's come before away
Ooh, and in that frozen moment, as I receive your kiss
There will not be words enough to say
You might also like
I wanna make you melt
Touch you like no one else
And do it all again a thousand times

And suddenly, I cannot remember who I used to be
And like the rain, this yearning washes over me
And all the pain I knew before has gone, yeah
And suddenly, I'm no longer drifting on an empty sea
And now I know that I believe in destiny
And mine is waiting right here in your arms

Oh, babe
Yeah
Na, na, na

I wanna make you melt
Touch you like no one else
And do it all again a thousand times

(Oh, suddenly)
And suddenly, I can not remember who I used to be (Who I used to be, yeah)
And like the rain, this yearning washes over me
And all the pain I knew before has gone (All the pain I knew before has gone away)
(Ooh, baby, yeah)
And suddenly, I'm no longer drifting on an empty sea (I was drifting on an empty sea)
And now I know that I believe in destiny (But I believe in destiny)
And mine is waiting right here, baby, in your arms
Baby, yeah
Mmm, mmm
