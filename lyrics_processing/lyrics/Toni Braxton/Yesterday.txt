Oh, oh
No-oh
Oh, oh

I gave you the benefit of the doubt
Till you showed me what you were about
Your true colors came out, oh
And your words couldn't hide the sin
'Cause the truth about where you'd been
Is in a fragrance I can't recognize

Just standing there, scratching your head
Bloodshot eyes, drunk with regret
Hanging yourself ten feet over the edge
I'm done with this, feeling like an idiot
Loving you, I'm over it
I just don't love you, don't love you no more

You, you are so yesterday
Never thought you'd lose my love this way
Now you come begging me to stay
See you, you are so yesterday
And I won't let you rain on my parade
I don't wanna hear a thing you say
You're so yesterday
You might also like
Funny now how I'm gone
The little light in your head came on
Now you realize it's all your fault, ooh-ooh
Don't you wish you had a time machine?
That way you could change history
That's the only way that you could be with me, oh

Just standing there, scratching your head
Bloodshot eyes, drunk with regret
Hanging yourself ten feet over the edge
I'm done with this, feeling like an idiot
Loving you, I'm over it
I just don't love you, don't love you no more

You, you are so yesterday
Never thought you'd lose my love this way
Now you come begging me to stay
Honey, you, you are so yesterday
And I won't let you rain on my parade
I don't wanna hear a thing you say
You're so yesterday

And now you wanna reminisce?
You say you wanna try again?
It started with a little kiss, but we can't even be friends
(Oh no, no no)
Now I never wanna see you, never wanna feel you, never wanna hear you
I don't love you, don't need you, can't stand you no more
You, you are so yesterday
Never thought you'd lose my love this way (Oh no)
Now you come begging me to stay (I wanna stay)
(Baby, you are) You, you are so yesterday (Yeah)
I won't let you rain on my parade (Whoo)
I don't wanna hear a thing you say
You're so yesterday (You are)

So yesterday
So yesterday, so yesterday (Today)
So yesterday
(You are, oh so yesterday)
So yesterday, so yesterday (Yeah)
