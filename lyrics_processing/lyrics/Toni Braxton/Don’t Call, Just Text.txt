Now I'm finally goin' been on my mind all day
And I ain't heard from you but I'm so cool I'm about to do my thing
So I'm leaving now and I'm thinking now it's goin' be a late now for me
So don't blow me up I know u want some you ain't gon' drive me crazy
You know I'm not at the house
Been telling you all week tonight I'm going out
So baby if you want me you know how to spell it out
Don't call just text, don't call just text, don't call just text
You know the music's too loud
Don't know what you're saying can't figure it out
I wanna talk but just not now
Don't call just text, don't call just text, don't call just text me
Yeah you know me
'bout now I'm sipping something in the VIP
Oh yes I'm rocking that thang in the back of my wish you was watching me
And there you go sending a picture text tryna turn me on
You just can't let go lemme do me and I'll do you when I get home
I know you wait up while I'm at this club
You can't steal my phone at all
Even when it's in this house
You know I'm not at the house
Been telling you all week tonight I'm going out
So baby if you want me you know how to spell it out
Don't call just text, don't call just text, don't call just text
You know the music's too loud
Don't know what you're saying can't figure it out
I wanna talk but just not now
Don't call just text, don't call just text, don't call just text me
