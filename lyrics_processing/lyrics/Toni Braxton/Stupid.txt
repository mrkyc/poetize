Loving you is stupid
'Cause I know that you never really loved me
And you never gave me a sign, so I could see
That you and me were never a possibility
And I feel so stupid after all the nights you left me lonely, to die
And you never gave me a reason why
And now I sit all alone and I cry
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, ooh, hey, ooh

Am I stupid? I shoulda known you were only playing the game
And you and me would never be the same
You made me feel like I'm the one to blame
And I feel so stupid
After all those nights after nights that I've tried
And all those conversations of lies
And I'm sitting here all alone and I'm crying
Whoa, oh, whoa, whoa-oh, oh, oh
I'm crying oh, whoa, whoa-whoa-whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, whoa-oh, baby

Oh, can't believe you never knew I felt
All this love, baby, no one else
Could ever love me the way that you do
Oh baby, you're all I needed
But you treated me so wrong and I can't believe it
How could you do me like you do?
'Cause I've been so stupid for you
You might also like
(You, you) Yeah-yeah, yeah (You, you)
Ooh baby, yeah (You, you), you, baby (You)
Why do you do me like you do, baby?
(You) You, baby (You) You, darling
(You, you) You, hey (You, you), yeah-yeah
(You) You, baby (You) You, darling, you, yeah, yeah
(You) I'm stupid, baby (You), I'm stupid darling, for you
I'm the one, baby, I'm the one left with all this shame
And I'm stupid, baby, stupid, darling, hey, yeah, yeah
Stupid is as stupid does
I was stupid for you, baby, just because
Stupid is as stupid does
