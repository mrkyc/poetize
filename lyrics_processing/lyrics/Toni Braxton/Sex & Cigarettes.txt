Tell me how am I supposed to trust you
When I can never tell just where the hell you been?
Am I supposed to lie alone to suffer?
But you can't expect for me to just pretend

Yes I do, yes I do, yes I do, I do love you
And you know, and you know, and you know I put up with too much
Tell me why do me, why don't you act like you're supposed to?
I guess you're too cold, too bold to give a fuck

You make me crazy, crazy
I swear you act like you hate me, hate me
How can you tell me "I love you"
Then do the things you do?
At least try to lie to me, lie to me
Oh yeah
Instead, you come straight to our bed
Smelling like sex and cigarettes

Remember when i used to catch you lying?
You'd double back and cover up your dirt
But lately, you don't even try to hide it
It's the lies and disrespect that hurts me worse
You might also like
Yes I do, yes I do, yes I do, I do love you
And you know, and you know, and you know I put up with too much
Tell me why do me, why don't you act like you're supposed to?
I guess you're too cold, too bold to give a fuck

You make me crazy, crazy
I swear you act like you hate me, hate me
How can you tell me I love you
Then do the things you do?
At least try and lie to me, lie to me
Oh yeah
Instead you come straight to our bed
Smelling like sex and cigarettes

I can't believe it, we're going through this again
We're too old, and I thought you'd outgrown this
This is driving me crazy, I can't do this no more
Not again, not again

You make me crazy
I swear you act like you hate me
How can you tell me I love you
Then do the things you do?
At least try and lie to me, lie to me, yeah
Instead you come straight to our bed
Smelling like sex and cigarettes
