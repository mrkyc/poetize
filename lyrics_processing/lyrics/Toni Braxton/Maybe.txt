Is tonight the night
That you take control of me?
Tell me, boy
What's it really gonna be?
Spending time for a while
Daddy, come close
I'm straight up feeling your style
I love the way you make me feel
When you keep it real
When you're holding me
When you're spooning me
When you look sexy
When you're touching me
When you're bumping me gently
Sitting here waiting in my Vicky's
In the mirror imagining you're with me
Petit Cheri, and I'm smelling real nice
Jouet cold, chilling on ice
Coming over at half past ten
And I'm wondering if I'm really gonna let him in
Give in, get it up, let it go
Or tell him no

Should I give him some?
Maybe
Is this the night for fun?
Maybe

Here it is, and he comes right in
And I fix us drinks, and I start to think
About what I'm gonna do
Will a brother be true
Will he size my body up and down?
Can he beat the odds?
Can he play it safe?
Will he make me hot?
When he hits the spot
That I love a lot?
Will he leave me hanging lonely, desperately?
Will he go and tell all his friends
That we did it and we did it again
Had me weak between the sheets
Will he say I was a real big freak?
Maybe I should slow it down
Cool off my flow
Relax and let him know if this gets out
No more, no glove, no love
Oh, no

Should I give him some?
Maybe
Is this the night for fun?
Maybe
Should I just give him some?
Maybe
Is this the night for fun?
Maybe
Maybe
Pretty baby
Love me
Like a lady

Should I say yes or no?
Should I just let it go?
Should I slow down my roll?
Let me think 'cause I really don't know
Don't know what to do about it, baby
If I do, will I regret it?
Maybe I should just forget it
What about if he ain't got no dough?
Tell me, I should let him go?
Maybe

Should I give him some?
Maybe
Is this the night for fun?
