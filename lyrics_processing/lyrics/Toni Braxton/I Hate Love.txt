Cause I know what they bring
You get up and take a shower and in no time, you're leaving
It sounds so selfish
But I can't help but think
That if you knew how much i needed you
You'd stay
I hate goodbyes
I hate these tears in my eyes
I hate myself for the way I feel about you everytime
I've had enough
I'm sick of wishing you were around me every day, every night
Its way too much
I hate love yeahh yeahhh
I hate love yeahh woooo
I hate your phone calls
In the middle of the day
Cause all they do is just remind that my baby's so far away
It drives me crazy babe
Cause I need you here with me
I know its hard for you to understand when I say
I hate goodbyes
I hate these tears in my eyes
I hate myself for the way I feel about you everytime
I've had enough
I'm sick of wishing you were around me every day, every night
Its way too much
I hate love
You might also likeI don't want to feel this alone (I can't help it)
Everytime you walked out that door
I start missing you (I can't help it no)
Wish I didn't need you this much (I can't help it)
But I love how it feels when we touch
I hate goodbyes
I hate these tears in my eyes
I hate myself for the way I feel about you everytime
I've had enough
I'm sick of wishing you were around me every day, every night
Its way too much
I hate goodbyes
I hate these tears in my eyes
I hate myself for the way I feel about you everytime
I've had enough
I'm sick of wishing you were around me every day, every night
Its way too much
I hate love
I hate love
