My bones ache, I'm cleaning the place up
Sometimes I don't even know why I care
I sit down take off my make-up
I lay down but you don't wake up
Sometimes I wonder if you know I'm there
I can't remember the last time you
Told me I'm beautiful, and I can't remember
Last time you said anything at all
I'm a woman
A woman with a heart
And I deserve your all
I'm not some girl who don't know what she wants
I'm a woman
And I need to be touched
And I need to be loved
Cause being just your woman is not enough
Now I hope that you don't wake up
When it's too late to make up
You'll be the one that's alone and that's sad
In time you'll find somebody
The truth is she'll never be me
And that's when you're going to miss what we had
You might also likeWhen all I really needed to hear was "you're beautiful"
All I really needed to hear was anything at all
I'm a woman
A woman with a heart
And I deserve your all
I'm not some girl who don't know what she wants
I'm a woman
And I need to be touched
And I need to be loved
Cause being just your woman is not enough
I'm not your friend who only needs you sometimes
And if I'm your lady
You got to treat me like...
I'm a woman
A woman with a heart
And I deserve your all
I'm not some girl who don't know what she wants
I'm a woman
And I need to be touched
And I need to be loved
Cause being just your woman is not enough
A woman needs your heart
A woman needs your all
A woman needs your everything
I'm a woman
And I need to be touched
And I need to be loved
And I deserve your everything
I'm a woman
I'm a woman
