La-da-da-da-da, la la

Where's the sand? I'm set
My body? Thumping, going pitty pat
Gettin' tan and wet
And when I feel the beat, I lose control of it
Oh, baby, I'm feelin' you, I must admit
Looking tight and fit
And I imagine you and I'm in...

Summer
Bodies shakin' to the ground
Music's going through ya
Can you feel the heat, the heat?
The heat is moving through your body
Temperature is risin'
Can you feel the heat, the heat? (Mmm)

Sleeping in till noon
Been naughty, put bubbles in the swimming pool
Skinny dip for two
And as you feel the rhythm taking hold of you
Oh, papi, I love it when you ooh-eeh-ooh
And I'm hooked, it's true
I imagine you and I'm in...
