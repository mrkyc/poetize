Look for me, look for me

All I need in this life of sin
Is me and my boyfriend
Ride with me till the very end
Just me and my boyfriend
All I need in this life of sin
Is me and my boyfriend
Down to ride till the very end
Just me and my boyfriend
(Look for me, look for me)

Ain't nothing in this world that I won't do
When it comes to being around you
You, baby homeboy
Don't you know that I would die if I had to live without you?
Always there to wipe my tears
Thick and thin, through all these years
I'm in it for life with you
My love is true, you're all I need

All I need in this life of sin (all I need)
Is me and my boyfriend (all I need is, babe)
Ride with me till the very end (oh yeah)
Just me and my boyfriend (all I need)
All I need in this life of sin
Is me and my boyfriend (all I need, baby)
Down to ride till the very end (yeah-yeah)
Just me and my boyfriend
(Look for me, look for me)

Even if the world would end tonight
I know that I would have you by my side
So many days, boy, that you took my pain away
'Cause only you can heal my heart, yeah
When you didn't have enough
You made sure that I was taken care of
I'd lay out my life for you
I'll ride for you, you're all I need
