Ay, ay, hold up a minute
Let me stop up here and use this payphone real quick
(*telephone dialing, sighs*)
Ay, ay, Toni, it's me
I was just callin', you know, just callin' to let you know
Don't wait up for me tonight
I mean, I just got a lot of things on my mind I gotta think about, you know
Just um, I'll be up at Bryan's house
You know, just for the night
I mean, I mean I know things are different, but you know
It's not you, it's me, you know, it's really me, you know
And basically, I just think I'ma need some space

Why you callin' me on the phone?
Why you not at home on time?
You say you're stayin' over your friend's
'Cause you've got a lot on your mind
Now you're swearin' up and down that it ain't me
So you say that things have changed
So, tell me what exactly does it mean
When you say you need your space?
Just don't make no excuses

Why you gotta lie to me? (No, no)
Just be a man about it
Baby, you don't gotta lie to me, no
Just be a man about it
If you wanna leave (I can tell you wanna leave), go on now
Just be a man about it
Come and grab your things (So come on, get your things and leave), and go on right now
Just be a man about it (Yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah)

I mean, you gotta understand I love you
You know what I'm sayin'?
And I love you enough to say that I think
I think you deserve somebody better than me, you know
And right now, I can't give you what you need, you know
I mean, I wanna love you
Well, I'm gonna love you one day, but you know
I mean, you just gotta understand where I'm comin' from

You say right now, that you're not what I'm lookin' for
And what you really need is time to grow
You're promisin' that one day, you may come around
And I'm supposed to let that go
But where the hell do you get off
Telling me your mama said I'm not what you need?
I tell you what, since she knows it all
Then that's where you need to be
Just don't make no excuses

Why you gotta lie to me? (No no, yeah)
Just be a man about it
Baby, you ain't gotta lie to me (You don't gotta lie to me), no no no no
Just be a man about it
If you wanna leave (I can tell you wanna leave), go on right now
Just be a man about it
Come and get your things (So come on, get your things and leave) and go, baby
Just be a man about it (Ooh yeah, yeah, oh-oh yeah)
Can you tell me how
You can say you're in love and then treat me so bad?
Boy, you know it just ain't right
I cannot believe
The way you handled things
You wouldn't lie if you were a man

Why you gotta lie to me?
Just be a man about it (Just be a man about it)
You don't gotta lie to me (Baby-yeah)
Just be a man about it
You ain't gotta lie to me (I can tell you wanna leave), no no, baby
Just be a man about it
If you wanna go, grab your things and leave now
So come on, get your things and leave (Don't wanna say it, don't wanna be in no more lyin')
Just be a man about it
If you wanna (Why you gotta lie to me?), go on and leave, but
Just be a man about it
You ain't gotta be here (You don't gotta lie to me), so leave me alone, babe
Just be a man about it
Baby, just be a man
I can tell you wanna leave, whoo
Just be a man about it
So come on, get your things and leave
