Seven whole nights and I'm just about through
I can't take it, won't take it, can't take it no more
I had about enough of you
I'd rather be on my own, yes, on my own
Darlin, darlin'
You know if you cared anything about love
You woulda been front and center
Oh, lovin' me and touchin' me
Honey, honey
You know if you knew anything about me
You woulda been much more tender
Oooh, squeezin' me, caressin' me
You coulda had about anything you wanted
But you messed it up
Oooh, you had to be tough
You told your friends you had me wrapped around your finger
You were talkin' kinda cocky like you had it goin' on
All the while you knew that things were kinda shaky
You knew that you were wrong
Dead wrong to be mistreatin' me
How can we go on?
(Seven whole days and not a word from you.)
Not a single word from you
(Seven whole nights and I'm just about through.)
What's a girl to do?
(I can't take it, won't take it, can't take it no more.)
I had about enough of you
I'd rather be on my own, yes, on my own
You might also likeSugar, sugar
You know if you knew anything about sweet
You woulda kept talkin' to me
Oh, every day, seven days a week
Baby, baby
You shoulda been givin' me a little more time
But you were just much too busy
Oh, abusin' me and usin' me
I woulda done about anything you wanted
I was there for you
I was crazy 'bout you
While I was sittin' thinkin' I was kinda special
You were runnin' 'round hittin' on every other girl in town
How could you love me when you knew you played me funny?
You knew that you were wrong
Dead wrong to be mistreatin' me
How can we go on?
Seven whole days and not a word from you

Deep in my heart, you were number one to start
But then you changed, you threw my heart away
Told your friend that you were runnin' things
Why'd it have to be that way?
