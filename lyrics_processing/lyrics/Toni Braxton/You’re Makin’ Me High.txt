I'll always think of you
Inside of my private thoughts
I can imagine you
Touching my private parts
And just the thought of you
I can't help but touch myself
That's why I want you so bad

Just one night of moonlight
Yeah, with you there beside me all night
Doin' it again and again
You know I want you so bad
Baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby (Ooh, ooh)

Ooh, I get so high
When I'm around you
Baby, I can touch the sky
You make my temperature rise (Ooh, baby)
You're makin' me high (High, ooh)
Baby, baby, baby, baby

Can't get my mind off you
I think I might be obsessed
The very thought of you
Makes me want to get undressed
I want to be with you
In spite of what my heart says
I guess I want you too bad
You might also like
All I want is moonlight
Ooh, with you there beside me all night
Ooh, baby, doin' it again, and then again (And again)
And then again, and then again
You know I want you so bad
Baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby (Ooh-yeah)

Ooh, I get so high
When I'm around you
Baby, I can touch the sky
You make my temperature rise (Ooh, boy)
You're makin' me high (High, ooh-yeah)
Baby, baby, baby, baby

I wanna feel
Your heart and soul inside of me
Let's make a deal
You roll, I lick, and we can go
Flying into ecstasy
Oh darling, you and me
Light my fire, blow my flame
Take me, take me
Take me away
And all I really want is moonlight
Ooh, with you there beside me all night
Ooh, doin' it again, and then again (And again)
And then again, and then again
Ooh, baby, I want you so bad
Baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby (Oh yeah)

Ooh, I get so high
When I'm around you
Baby, I can touch the sky
You make my temperature rise (Ooh, you know you're makin' me)
You're makin' me high (High)
Baby, baby, baby, baby (High, oh baby)

Ooh, I get so high (Ooh, oh-yeah)
When I'm around you
Baby, I can touch the sky (Ah, touch the sky)
You make my temperature rise (You know you're makin' me)
You're makin' me high (You know you're makin' me high)
