I am willing to give whatever it takes)
Quietly I am screaming for help
I calm down and steady myself
Collapse to the ground when I realize I can't breathe
Could this be happening? What's happening to me?
All the walls are closing in on me and confusion makes it hard to see
Still my pounding heart is bleeding for you
(I know the truth)
And I start to sweat, sweat, sweat sweat
Why the hell am I here?
I start to sweat, sweat, sweat, sweat
Have I succumbed to fear?
Why am I trying the undying, a ghost of such elegance?
Oh why am I racing to be facing a vision of something so perfect?
I am willing to give whatever it takes to find forgiveness for my mistakes
So I'm going to take a chance and invite the unknown to a deadly dance
I have laid eyes on you and yet it does not seem as if the Earth moved
(I know the truth)
And I start to sweat, sweat, sweat sweat
I will have you tonight!
I start to sweat, sweat, sweat sweat
You will be mine tonight!

As I rise to conquer the demons I sense that the darkness awaits
(The road I walk is paved with a thousand unmarked graves)
