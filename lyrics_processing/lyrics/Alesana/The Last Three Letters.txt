I hope this message finds you well
As these endless thoughts drip from my soul
Every single word secretly paints a fairytale
Of when we will melt into one...
Eyes (i am so scared) forfeit sight to the pain (so scared)
Cold scalpel's steel whispers tear at my very core
As I cling to memories of you
I am so scared...so scared...I need you with me
Were the last words that I wrote for you enough to tell you
That in my death the light that shone through my painful darkness
Was a blinding vision of your eternal smile?
It's me again
Is it me or am I wrong to be concerned?
Will the beauty of your pen ever cross my eyes again?
Was this all a lie? why?
Were the last words that I wrote for you enough to tell you
That in my death the light that shone through my painful darkness
Was a blinding vision of your eternal smile?
Make it stop, make this pounding in my head stop
Fill my lungs with air, give me one more day to make her dreams come true
She understands right? that I'm not coming back...
She understands right? that I'm not coming back...
Make it stop, make the pounding stop
I'm not coming back, I'm not coming back, I'm not coming back...
I don't know what happened...who would have thought my life would end up like this?
I never got the chance to see her face, or to touch her hair, and now, it's too late
I didn't mean to hurt her, not hurt her like this...I can't feel my legs
I can't feel my legs and I can't even cry...how could somebody die like this?

Never knew that silence could cut so deep or that you could twist the blade
Now I curse all of your beautiful lies..
I love you and goodbye...
Were the last words that I wrote for you enough to tell you
That in my death the light that shone through my painful darkness
Was a blinding vision of your eternal smile?
Cold scalpel's steel whispers tear at my very core
