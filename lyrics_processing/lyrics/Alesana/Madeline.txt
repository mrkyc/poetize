Sweetheart, be still
Enjoy the show
All the walls are beginning to bleed
Lay to rest any hope of flight
Oh, my God can this be happening?!
Darkness quenches anxious light!
My sly illusion is chasing after me
As time cries, "please forget what you've seen"
One minute I was there chasing dreams
Suddenly I'm here cheating death
One mistake and I'll be a slave to it, yea
And maybe I will find you on the other side
Or maybe I'm trapped in this narration
So condemned to never be again
I own you now, oh sweet child
Just when you thought you had fooled the Gods
Oh, darling just you wait
Such mystery remains
I could try to scream, I could just run
But I would find you and punish you for your sins
For ever thinking you were clever enough to prevail
Everyone is dead, everything is dead, everything is dead!
I'm loving every second of watching you writhe!

As time cries, "please forget what you've seen"
One minute I was there chasing dreams
Suddenly I'm here cheating death
One mistake and I'll be a slave to it, yea
And maybe I will find you on the other side
Or maybe I'm trapped in this narration
So condemned to never be again
Let the games begin!
Try your best to escape, lamb!
I saved the worst for you, yea!
I'll humiliate your soul!
I'll make you wish you'd stayed asleep!
One minute I was there chasing dreams
Suddenly I'm here cheating death
One mistake and I'll be a slave to it, yea
And maybe I will find you on the other side
Or maybe I'm trapped in this narration
So condemned to never be again
I own you now, oh sweet child
Sweetheart, be still
Enjoy the show
All the walls are beginning to bleed
Just when you thought you had fooled the Gods
Oh, darling just you wait
Shall we begin?
