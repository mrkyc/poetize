If I'm still alive then I have to find the answer
Could it be that it was a dream and I'm still beside her?
Right before my eyes a tragic surprise, the water stops
Wickedness will rain and drown us in her sorrow and her thirst
If I hope to survive I must think faster, I'm losing ground
Should I pull back the veil?
You had the best of me, now taste the worst
All that glimmers is not gold
I may be wrong but your brilliance is my darkness
You had me convinced that together we could fly
Until I started scratching at the surface and I saw beyond your masquerade
Your body is an illness
Temples crashing down all around me, panic chokes the streets
The golden city falls and with it our lives go up in flames
Should I pull back the veil?
You had the best of me, now taste the worst
All that glimmers is not gold
I may be wrong but your brilliance is my darkness
You had me convinced that together we could fly
Until I started scratching at the surface and I saw beyond your masquerade
Your body is an illness

We've been watching you wander)
My blood runs cold
(There's no need to run farther)
I fear I know the truth
(Come into our arms, brother)
I tear back the cowl and stare into my own eyes
(Now we can be one forever)
Who are you? Who are you? Who are you?
(Yeah!)
(Hey, hey, hey, hey!)
I pull back the veil
You had the best of me, now taste the worst
All that glimmers is not gold
I may be wrong but your brilliance is my darkness
You had me convinced that together we could fly
Until I started scratching at the surface and I saw beyond your masquerade
Your body is an illness and I'm sickened by the thought of you
