If this is what you call betrayal
Then this is what I call revenge
How could I be so blind?
I guess I fell in love too quickly...
But I'm fine
Imagine where you'd be now if you only knew
The one you love is the one who's killing you
I trusted you too much
I know now that I should have kept my eyes
Wide open the first time that we kissed
I'll bury you for this
Just say to me that this time is the last time
And I'll pretend that somehow I know we'll be fine
Years spent watching in silence as your illness spilled onto page
Those were the last days I spend with you
Before you left, before he came
How could I be so blind?
I guess I fell in love too quickly...
But I'm fine

Oh, is it my fault?
You fell into that illusion you've been living discretely
Should I blame you in the end?
Did you ever think the sketches would take over completely?
Die!
Just die!
You are scum!
You are filth!
Choke on blood as your knife ends the show! Writhe in pain you thought you'd
Never know!
I don't think they dig graves close enough to hell for the likes of you!
I don't think they dig graves close enough to hell for the likes of you!
I handed you a knife and my heart, oh, I handed you a knife and my heart
And now the dream is over... and now the dream is over
I handed you a knife and my heart, oh, I handed you a knife and my heart
And now the dream is over... and now the dream is over
