If only you could see
If only you could see
You're the only girl I've ever dreamed of
If only you could see
If only you could see

Should I apologize to such pathetic eyes?
Just the sight of you has made me sick tonight (Tonight)
It was your poison kiss that turned me into this
Then again there is a chance you could be mine tonight (Tonight)

Darling, will you please take a walk with me?
We can count the stars that disappear (I wish you could see)
I wish you could see
You're the only girl I've ever dreamed of
Are you satisfied?

(Are you satisfied?)
(Are you satisfied?)

What fate has led me here? Oh, please forgive me dear
I don't know if I could survive on my own (My own)
I could have married you instead I buried you
Now we'll see if I can fall asleep alone (Alone)

Darling, will you please take a walk with me?
We can count the stars that disappear (I wish you could see)
I wish you could see
You're the only girl I've ever dreamed of
Are you satisfied?

(Are you satisfied?)
The nightmares coming true
(Are you satisfied?)
It was all for you
(Are you satisfied?)
I did it all for you
(Are you satisfied?)
I wish you could see
You're the only girl I've ever dreamed of

Darling, will you please take a walk with me?
We can count the stars that disappear (I wish you could see)

You're the only girl I've ever dreamed of

The depths of a man's soul can not be measured
In a manner of meters and fathoms
But rather it is, in my opinion
Only quantified by his proximity to heaven and hell
It was in such a state
That I ushered myself past the town tavern
Bursting at the seams with the sounds of laughter and drunken piano playing
Had it only been a different night, a different place
Or a different kind of man passing by the threshold of that innocent pub
The events that transpired at that point would have undoubtedly been drastically different
I can only guess if anyone outside that place
Had a clue when those exclamations of mirth
Became the desperate screams of the helpless
