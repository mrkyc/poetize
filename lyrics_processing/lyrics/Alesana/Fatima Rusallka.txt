A tortured existence which leaves behind no answers
Destined to suffer the struggle, cursed to be one of them, to be both of them
Fatima. Rusalka
Born out of nothingness, defined by beauty and patience
A tortured existence which leaves behind no answers
Destined to suffer the struggle, cursed to be one of them, to be both of them
Fatima Rusalka

Somewhere between the chaos and the void in a desert that predates time itself, bereft of stars and untouched by the Gods of man
There was only one, there was only her

Black echoes deafening silence (She is born!)
Spat upon the tortured earth (All alone!)
Cursed to never live! (Scarlet fiend!)
Cursed to never die! (Condemned to breathe eternally!)
Thirsting for (an answer)
Starving for (her purpose)
But the sky (holds his tongue)
As she waits (For the end)

And it's not looking good at all
An anguished melody
Reveals to me a memory of love once lost
A quiet affliction, a moment of weakness
(Breathe and shut your eyes!)
Finally, it all makes sense so naturally
I am lost
When angels and devils make sense of the wreckage
Unsung heroine, death won't set you free!

Cautiously I softly fake a smile
It's cold here at night
I'm trying to hide, dying to find myself
(I should stop praying to no one!)
(I can't stop searching for someone!)
Please just stop, sweetheart, it gets better than this
I wish I could go, wish I could find a way
(I just want to see your face)
But now I'm starting to see how it all ends

And it's not looking good at all
An anguished melody
Reveals to me a memory of love once lost
A quiet affliction, a moment of weakness
(Breathe and shut your eyes!)
Finally, it all makes sense so naturally
I am lost
When angels and devils make sense of the wreckage
Unsung heroine, death won't set you free!
Immortality is your curse!
You're an orphan by God, and lost
You're an orphan by God, and lost
An orphan by God
You're an orphan by God, and lost
So now it seems the sky has failed me
This has been a terrible mistake
If I had just one more chance...
If you're looking for an answer
Hold tight and never let me go
(If you're looking for an answer)
And the lies we said we'll bury with the rest
(If you're looking for an answer)
Oh, the senselessness of all this suffering
(If you're looking for an answer)
Feel it again, and over again
(Let it begin)
Born out of nothingness, defined by beauty and patience
A tortured existence which leaves behind no answers
Destined to suffer the struggle
Cursed to be one of them, to be both of them
Fatima Rusalka
Ageless warrior left to destroy mankind and reap the earth
We have to believe, trust that there is hope
Useless prayers will be left to unveil the truth that all is lost
We have to believe, trust that there is hope
