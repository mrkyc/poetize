Your lips they beg for me to get you alone
I want you to know it's the sway of your hips
You taste so sweet (cruel temptress), I'm at your feet
I can tell by the way you move that you want me to want you
Are you happy now that I've figured out I was just the victim
In a game of lies and lustful tension?
Your lips they beg for me to get you alone
I want you to know it's the sway of your hips
You taste so sweet (cruel temptress), I'm at your feet
I can tell by the way you move that you want me to want you
Are you happy now that I've figured out I was just the victim
In a game of lies and lustful tension?
I can't believe I fell for you
I was wrong, I am so confused
A foolish mistake
(I gaze across the chasm that divides me from her, my prize
And drink in her beauty
I let the heady aroma of perfume riding on the hot win saturate me
I train my ears to the creaking of the bridge spanning the gap to her
I throw caution into that wind of passion and continue down the path
The path to the unknown.)
You might also likeI'm losing control and I want all of you, I ache to swallow you
I'm losing control, your body screams for me, it's destroying me
I can not resist the temptress of the night
I'm coming for you, I want to, I need you
As the Earth quakes I will deflower you
Oh how my head swims, oh how my heart yearns
I'm coming for you
Our flesh will become one and we'll never speak of what we've become
(It's what you want.)
I'm gone! I'm gone! I'm gone!
So it seems that we were nothing
Are you happy now that I've figured out I was just the victim
In a game of lies and lustful tension?
I can't believe I fell for you
I was wrong, I am so confused
