Let's roll the windows down, you and I
I'll play your favorite song, we'll drive until we fly
I'm gonna make you feel just like the Fourth of July
Aw girl, you know my heart explodes from the colors in your eyes
Have I ever told you how much I love you?
Well I want to let you know-oh-oh

I was a dead man walking
My heart was barely beating
But girl you walked in
And I started feeling
Boom boom, the rhythm in my chest
You you, took away my breath
Baby, just say yes
If I make your heart go boom boom, oh
If I make your heart go boom boom

Just give me one more kiss
Then give me one more kiss
I hope you never stop
I hope this never ends
Gonna lose myself in you
Gonna make you come and find me
Aw girl you know I lose control
I want you all around me
Have I ever told you how much I need you?
Well I want to let you know-oh-oh
You might also like
I was a dead man walking
My heart was barely beating
But girl you walked in
And I started feeling
Boom boom, the rhythm in my chest
You you, took away my breath
Baby, just say yes
If I make your heart go boom boom, oh
If I make your heart go boom boom

If i never told you, how much I love you
Girl I love you, girl I love you

I was a dead man walking
My heart was barely beating
But girl you walked in
And I started feeling
Boom boom, the rhythm in my chest
You you, took away my breath
Baby, just say yes
If I make your heart go boom boom, oh
If I make your heart go boom boom, yeah
Do I make your heart go boom boom boom, oh
