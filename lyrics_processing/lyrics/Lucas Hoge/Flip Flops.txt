Finally got the okay to get away
Leaving the farm, sitting there in the rearview
Five guys on a two day drive
Only stopping for gas and Mountain Dew
Never been out of our small town
For nothin' but Friday night football games, now
Here we are pullin' this car
Right out on the sand and we're blown away by

Flip flops and bikini tops
Strollin' down on the boulevard
Lookin' for a good time in the sunshine
These tan lines are a beautiful thing, yeah
Warm wind on your hot skin
Everybody gonna jump on in
'Til the night comes and the moon's up
Gonna need a little light to help you find those
Flip flops and bikini tops

Fire burnin' down, still we're hangin' out
And watching the sun slip up out of the blue waves
Wide-eyed all through the night
Gotta take it all in before it slips away
Well this girl in my arms, she's never seen a farm
She couldn't believe I'd never been to the ocean
Well it is what it is, nothing serious
Just goin' with the flow, and rollin' with the motions of
You might also like

Lookin' for a good time in the sunshine
These tan lines are a beautiful thing, yeah
Warm wind on your hot skin
Everybody gonna jump on in
'Til the night comes and the moon's up
Gonna need a little light to help you find those
Flip flops and bikini tops, yeah yeah yeah
Oh, flip flops and bikini tops

Oh, woah-oh-oh
