Look at you, leanin' back, on the hood of my Chevy
Damn girl, that thing never looked so good
Jump in, crank it up
Drive us on out where there ain't nothin' but you and me
A couple heartbeats getting real close
I wanna hear you go

Ooh baby, good and lazy
Cover me up like country gravy
Underneath the shade of an old magnolia
Let me chase that cherry cola
With a kiss from your lips
And lay you down, down in the dirty south

Baby, let's take it slow, like sippin' good whiskey
Oh yeah, that's what I'm talking about
I think that muddy water's telling me
To wiggle you out of your blue jeans
So we can take a dip, for a little bit
Girl don't you know
I wanna hear you go

Ooh baby, good and lazy
Cover me up like country gravy
Underneath the shade of an old magnolia
Let me chase that cherry cola
With a kiss from your lips
And lay you down, down in the dirty south
You might also like
Ooh, like honey on a biscuit, sticky sweet
Ooh, girl, I want you all over me
I wanna hear you go, ooh
I wanna hear you go, mmm
I wanna hear you go

Ooh baby, good and lazy
Cover me up like country gravy
Underneath the shade of an old magnolia
Let me chase that cherry cola
With a kiss from your lips
And lay you down
Oh, just give me that kiss from your lips
And lay you down, down, down in the dirty south
Down in the dirty south, ooh yeah

(Underneath the shade of an old magnolia
Let me chase that cherry cola)
Lookin' good on the hood of my Chevy
Cover me with country gravy
Yeah the muddy water's been telling me
Wiggle you out of your blue jeans
Gonna take a dip, for a little bit
Take you down, down, down yeah
Let me chase that cherry cola
