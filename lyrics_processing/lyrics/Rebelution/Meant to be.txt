I can see the sun come up
Time to get away from here
Time to make a new plan up again
Water never felt this good
And air: it never felt so pure
Time to make a new plan up again
Well, it was true when I said it
I'd rather forget it when the past don't matter now
You think I owe you
But I gotta go, you see, the past don't matter now

And it feels like life is taking over
It feels like it's meant to be
And it feels like life is taking over
It feels like it's meant to be
'Cause I can see the sunrise on my way
I can see the road rise to meet me
I can feel the earth underneath my feet
And I can see the stars on top of me
And I say don't ever come down, come down, no
I need your light now, right now, yeah
Don't ever come down, come down, no
I need your light now, yah, right now, yeah
