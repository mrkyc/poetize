Well alright, speaking my mind
Speaking my mind
You're a counterfeit love
Stay away from me, cause I don't trust you girl
You're a counterfeit lover
Say you love me, but I don't trust you no

I never thought it would end this way
Whatever happened to my dream girl?
Whatever happened to you baby?
I'd always say there's a way
But this time you changed
You took my money, and you took my time
You took my heart and my soul, my whole life

You're a counterfeit love
Stay away from me, cause I don't trust you girl
You're a counterfeit lover
Say you love me, but I don't trust you no
You're a counterfeit love
Stay back from me, cause I don't trust you girl
You're a counterfeit lover
Say you love me, but I don't trust you no

When I was I child I would dream
Dream for the day when I had money
I'd buy my baby all these precious little things just for me
But when dreams become reality
She took me for my money, took me for my time
Took me for my heart and my soul, my whole life
I never thought I'd say it, I can't live a lie
Well I was wrong and now I gotta say goodbye

You're a counterfeit love
Stay away from me, cause I don't trust you girl
You're a counterfeit lover
Say you love me, but I don't trust you no
You're a counterfeit love
Stay back from me, cause I don't trust you girl
You're a counterfeit lover
Say you love me, but I don't trust you no
Yeah, well alright
