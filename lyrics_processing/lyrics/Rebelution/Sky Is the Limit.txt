No time for the wicked
If you're in my line
I'ma go round the side and still bring it
Sky is the limit
Out of my way, you can't get me down
No time for the wicked
If you're in my line
I'ma go round the side and still bring it
Sky is the limit
Out of my way, you can't get me down

There's nothing like a clear peace of mind
To overcome the hardships in life
To sort out the wrong from the right
Someone's in line, but they can't get me down
I got my own self by my side
And mentally we gotta be free
I see the wickedness coming full speed
But I hold together like the ball needs the seam
I'm tryna do somethin' not nothin'
You're tryna hold me back and that's fine
Nothing you say or do is worth my time
Good day to you, I respectfully decline
And now I'm comin' stronger than ever
You say I'm a fool, I say whatever
I'm in it for the good vibes together
And the love lasts forever

Sky is the limit
Out of my way, you can't get me down
No time for the wicked
If you're in my line
I'ma go round the side and still bring it
Sky is the limit
Out of my way, you can't get me down

Nothing you can do to me now
There's nothing you can say to me now
Yeah

And now it's been seven years running
Backyards and front yards and at the eight-seven
Some hit the scene with a bang and that set it
And some didn't really work hard to get it
"Dream on," they say, "dream on, you're weak"
But my hand's still high 'cause in my mind I've achieved
IV set the pace for a dream
And 6500 all the livin' I need
There's nothin' you can say to me now
There's nothin' you can do to me now
Nothin' you can say to me now
Nothin' you can do to me now
Yeah

No time for the wicked
If you're in my line
I'ma go round the side and still bring it
Sky is the limit
Out of my way, you can't get me down
No time for the wicked
If you're in my line
I'ma go round the side and still bring it
The sky is the limit
Out of my way, you can't get me down
No time for the wicked
If you're in my line
I'ma go round the side and still bring it
The sky is the limit
Out of my way, you can't get me down
No time for the wicked
If you're in my line
I'ma go round the side and still bring it
The sky is the limit
Oh, out of my way, you can't get me down

There's nothin' you can say to me now
Nothin' you can do to me now
