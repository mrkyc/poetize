Ever since the day I was born
There were dark clouds hovering over the city where I stay
I don't recollect clear days, mostly the fog and  haze
Because the city by the Bay stays grey
But that's what made it great, consistently the same
Also I hated it when I wanted a change
But I wasn't afraid, back then I thought that I would live for days
A year was an eternity so yeah, I thought I had it made

But I kept it hush, kept it hush, kept it hush
Yeah I kept it quiet and I never opened up
Made my own philosophy, the system is corrupt
Made my own decision that I'd had enough
I just never found what some say I would find
I was making music just so I could pass the time
Stored it in my mind, pushed it to the side
Realised that there was lots to criticise

On some days, some days
I think about those days, those days
On some days, some days
Reminisce about those days, those days
On some days, some days
I think about those days, those days
On some days, some days
Reminisce about those days, those days

When it got to May and we all celebrate
First time it hit me, adding numbers to my name
And I start to see, every day was a routine
Get up in the morning, same thing every week
But I didn't speak, never opened up my mouth
Pretended I was listening when I was spacing out
Started to have doubts instead of me being devout
I would've said it loud but I don't think that was allowed

So I kept it hush, kept it hush, kept it hush
Yeah I kept it quiet and I never opened up
Made my own philosophy, the system is corrupt
Made my own decision that I'd had enough
I just never found what some say I would find
I was making music just so I could pass the time
Stored it in my mind, pushed it to the side
Realised that there was lots to criticise

On some days, some days
I think about those days, those days
On some days, some days
Reminisce about those days, those days
On some days, some days
I think about those days, those days
On some days, some days
Reminisce about those days, those days
On some days, some days
I think about those days, those days
On some days, some days
Reminisce about those days, those days
On some days, some days
I think about those days, those days
On some days, some days
