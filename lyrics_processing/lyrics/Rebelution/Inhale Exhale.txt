Yeah Colorado well-stocked, keeps me medicated inhale, exhale

I'll be the first one to say
Yeah, light it up, I'll be the first one to fade
And spark it up
We're elevated
Nah, I can't complain
It keeps me humble, makes me appreciate
Sweet Mary Jane
You pick me up you make me feel no pain
And when in doubt, inspire me to get out
Sing with my heart I'll take a draw to calm down

Don't have to tell you we don't have to give a reason
We elevate at any time or any season
It keeps me going never feel like I'm defeated
Gives me that feeling I can always count on

I'll take the best of what's around it don't matter wanna inhale, exhale
Yeah, South Side keep it up, keep it blazing inhale, exhale
Just got some Mendo at my spot, and it's fire wanna inhale, exhale
And in the islands well-stocked keeps me medicated inhale, exhale
