If you need someone to hold on to
I'll help you settle down easy (Settle down easy)
And when your day is through
I'll help you settle down easy

Nothing satisfies me
As much as when you're happy
It's true

Nobody does it like you do
And I would only tell the truth
You know I'm honest you look beautiful in blue
But all the colors bring the beauty out in you
And when you're running
Come run my way
I'll meet you halfway
And love you always
Hey baby
I'll meet you there
Hey, nothing compares to you

If you ever need the weight off you
I'll help you settle down easy (Settle down easy)
And when our days are few
I'll help you settle down easy
