A heart like a lion, a burning like fire
Waiting just to be set free
A heart like a lion, a burning like fire
How can I bear captivity

Some they tell me I'm a fool, a fool who walks this road alone
So afraid of making changes, remember that nothing is carved in stone
Oh, tell me why we are so afraid of the secrets locked within our souls
Everything that we're made of is dying just to be exposed oh yea

So don't turn your back on yourself, cause there's nowhere to run
You know your life's ain't a practice run
It's time to wake up your mind oh yea
For maybe tomorrow will never come or maybe it will but by then it's too late uh huh
There's nothing left to do but cry
So now you cry and you don't know why, and now you cry but you don't know why

A heart like a lion, a burning like fire
Waiting just to be set free
A heart like a lion, a burning like fire
How can I bear captivity

So what you want to be now well it's time to realize
That everything you need now has been right in front of your eyes
Don't point your fingers and blame, remember it's never too late to change
Don't point your fingers and blame, remember it will be okay

So don't turn your back on yourself, cause there's nowhere to run
You know your life's ain't a practice run
It's time to wake up your mind oh yea
For maybe tomorrow will never come or maybe it will but by then it's too late uh huh
There's nothing left to do but cry
So now you cry and you don't know why, and now you cry but you don't know why

You better get up, you better get out
You better get up and turn your life around
You only live once, you better act now
Cause you never know when it's going to come back around

A heart like a lion, a burning like fire
Waiting just to be set free
A heart like a lion, a burning like fire
