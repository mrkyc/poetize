Oh do you feel it now music's up in ya
Do you feel it loud straight through your ears man
It's that mean bass singing pleasure to meet ya
The green and black throw it up so we see ya

Y'all feel the sound? It's coming straight through the waves
While the music from the Earth keeps us sane
I'm feeling that herb when the sun hits my face
You create your mind so make your mental space

Much respect to all the people thinking green
Not just the color but the message in between
Now here's a mental weapon that you'll use frequently
To stop evil people and end their beliefs

Green turned to black, green smoked to black, green turned to black
Yea that's what we stand for
Green turned to black, green smoked to black, green turned to black
Yea that's what we stand for

Well Mr. Tough Guy he fights physically
When all the people really need is some peace
It are these moments where we turn to our weed
It never caused no death, no disease

Don't try and make it seem like were some foolish youth
Throwing away our lives, as were searching for the truth
Don't need authority/rules while we go unheard
Still there ain't no crime using herbs

Much respect to all the people thinking green
Not just the color but the message in between
Yes here's a mental weapon that you'll use frequently
To stop evil people and end their beliefs
