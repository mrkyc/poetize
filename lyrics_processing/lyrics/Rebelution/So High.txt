Good day, hey, I'm awake
And I feel good, now it's time to get baked
Roll me up a spliff
Then I catch a lift
Put me on your shoulders, on the cannabis I'll sit (hiigghh!!)
Control it, now we gettin' high
Planet Earth in the place, catch a vibe
Iron, lion, watch me levitate
Now I did it good, representing for the grapes
Marijuana, I love her to my death
Plus I'm from North Sudan, so the sess on my breath
Never fuck with them, we only blow dank
I'll supply, vaporizer, it's time to elevate, yeah
