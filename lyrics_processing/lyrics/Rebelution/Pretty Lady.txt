Got up this morning, read the text that she left me
She said you won't believe the dream that I had
Let's reenact the way that you made me crazy
And give me all of the excuses to be bad
I was just thinking really nice and slow
But then again, you are the one who's in control
I wanna love you baby all night cause I
I know exactly what you like

I know exactly what you mean
Hey pretty lady, gonna act upon your dreams
In the covers, gonna make you scream it loud
Hey baby
Hey beautiful, I know precisely what you need
I wanna lay you down so I can relieve ya
Tease ya, please ya, like you won't believe
I'm loving that sound

Slap on some reggae, get the room to bubble up
So I can work your body from sun down to sun up
Every second got you on the verge to erupt
Baby I can read your mind and you can't get enough
We can turn the lights down low
You should let your body flow into me
Two become one easily
Things that I know to let me give you what you need

Hey baby
Hey beautiful, I know precisely what you need
I wanna lay you down so I can relieve ya
Tease ya, please ya, like you won't believe
I'm loving that sound

Nobody else knows you better, you know that I will never leave your side
Little darling, we're turning dreams into reality
You don't have to say a word, no
You don't have to say nothing because

I know exactly what you mean
Hey pretty lady, gonna act upon your dreams
In the covers, gonna make you scream it loud
Hey baby
Hey beautiful, I know precisely what you need
I wanna lay you down so I can relieve ya
Tease ya, please ya, like you won't believe
