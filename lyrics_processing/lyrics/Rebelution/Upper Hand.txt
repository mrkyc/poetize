Said I wouldn't waste all this time on you, but I do
Losing all my days trying to escape you, but it's useless

Always turning my head sideways like I'm chasing clues
I wanna walk away but I know I am fixed on you
You got me thinking backwards
Running circles and I don't know what to do, well I don't know what to do

I can't stand you've got the upper hand
But I like the way you use it and I don't wanna lose ya
I just hate the way you pull my strings
But I love the way you use me and oh, it's so confusing

Here I am again, lost up in your maze and it's crazy
Told myself I'd leave but then I caught your gaze and it's amazing

Always turning my head sideways like I'm chasing clues
I wanna walk away but I know I am fixed on you
You got me thinking backwards
Running circles and I don't know what to do, well I don't know what to do

What you doing to me?
And here I am again
What you doing to me?

I can't stand you've got the upper hand
