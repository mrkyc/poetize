Yeah yeah
Next thing I knew we were in deep
Hold on to me 'cause babe I'm about to leave
She said it never felt so right
As the time went by I was off in the night
She said I don't cry, tonight I cried twice
The thought of you not by my side
And I find with you I'm the emotional type
Hold on to me, we can hold on for life
Well, tell me how you feel when I say this
Our destination is place-less
I never understood what it meant
When I said the three words that some people dread
That's about as real as it gets
I never hold back with my love and intent
I finally figured out what it meant
Now there's a spark in my heart, times ten
Everyday
Eight days a week was the song that I'd play
Eight times for me and eight times for the sake
Eight times for love and eight times for the way
That I can remember those days
You and every minute wasn't all so strange
See you in the spring when the patience pays
I'm strugglin' but hustlin' and lovin' it, always

I wrote to her eighty-five times
Sometimes for her, but sometimes for my
Simple collection of lines
Sometimes to find the way up in a rhyme
I woke up one morning to find
It was her first name on a billboard sign
I smiled and said damn what a trip
It was just yesterday I had a kiss for her lips
Usually I don't make much of this
Sign's a sign, it doesn't change it a bit
I choose to stay calm in my sleep
Seeing the prize on April nineteenth
That was then, I was down to a week
Longest seven days of my life so to speak
I sip up my tea so sweet
In my head there's the girl I've been dying to see
So everyday
Eight days a week was the song that I'd play
Eight times for me and eight times for the sake
Eight times for love and eight times for the way
That I can remember those days
You and every minute wasn't all so strange
See you in the spring when the patience pays
