Today is gonna be a good day
And I wouldn't want it any other way
I've got my number one lover right beside me
And she holds the key to my safe

Well, there are six vibrations to be made, ah-ha
In a pattern that I only designate, ah-ha
Well, she sings to me
When I need her to be my everything
She's my everything

It's gonna be a good day, ah-ha-ahh
No other beauty can purr like her
She picks me up when I need her most
And good company when I'm alone

Today is special in its own way
Because I never really know what's in store
I've got a reason to believe
And a reason to depend on a good time with good company

Well, there are six vibrations to be made, ah-ha
In a pattern that I only designate, ah-ha
Well, she sings to me
When I need her to be my everything
She's my everything

I share with you my deepest truths
Beauty that I can't explain
And two can only play this game
I hear you call out my name
And you remind me

That it's gonna be a good day, ah-ha-ahh
No other beauty can purr like her
She picks me up when I need her most
And good company when I'm alone
