'Cause your past, it can't be undone
Tell me what you're running from

Well she wakes up every morning
Her thoughts weighing heavy on her mind
She's hoping today will be a better day than the ones behind
She's having some trouble getting going
Oh, from the fear she's paralyzed
She puts her face into her hands and then she cries

'Cause she's so tired
She closes her eyes
Trying to live up to a standard that the world provides
And she's so tired
She closes her eyes
Trying to live up to a standard that the world provides
Oh yeah

No reasons to live, more reasons to die

Will she ever find the courage to change?
