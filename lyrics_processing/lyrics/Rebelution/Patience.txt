I just need some time with you
Waiting for my turn
Maybe isn't good enough
I'm patient, I ain't givin' up, no
Just enough room for two
Let me show you what I've got for you
Maybe isn't good enough
Well, I'm patient, I ain't givin' up, no

Yes, I know, been a long day
But my love is your escape
Am I misunderstood?
So many questions
I wish I could get you alone
I can read your eyes on me
But I can't read your mind
Slowly, can I be your
Everything and more that you ask for
I'll be waiting on you

I just need some time with you
Waiting for my turn
Maybe isn't good enough
I'm patient, I ain't givin' up, no
Just enough room for two
Let me show you what I've got for you
Maybe isn't good enough
Well, I'm patient, I ain't givin' up

Yes, I know been a long time
But my love will be worthwhile
Am I clueless from the start?
Ehy ehy, like a shot in the dark, mhm
Still, I can see your eyes turn wide
And I can feel the tension rise
Can I be your
Everything and more that you ask for
I'll be waiting on you

I just need some time with you
Waiting for my turn
Maybe isn't good enough
I'm patient, I ain't givin' up, no
Just enough room for two
Let me show you what I've got for you
Maybe isn't good enough
Well, I'm patient, I ain't givin' up, no

La la la la la, maybe isn't good enough
I'm patient, I ain't givin' up
La la la la la, maybe's not good enough
Patience, I'm not givin' up, no
La la la la la, maybe's not good enough
