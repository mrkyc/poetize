We're feelin' alright, yeah
We're feelin' good, we're feelin' alright
Yeah yeah yeah

Well, it's about that time for us
To look around and meet somebody new
Let's all welcome in
Familiar faces, perhaps somebody who
Has got a conflict in their life, alright
Tell them you're sorry, but
There's ways to change the wrong to right

See, we can sit in a distant haze
And watch rain clouds pour thoughts of greatness
To help our troubles sail real far away, oh yeah
Well, it's a struggle, every day we're stressin'
But what's a life without dedication, ah?
I'm gonna pick up that soul's intention
To soak in music, relaxation

We're feelin' good, we're feelin' alright, yeah
We're feelin' good, we're feelin' alright, yeah
We're feelin' good, we're feelin' alright, yeah
We're feelin' good, we're feelin' alright
Yeah yeah yeah

In a moment I'll be on my way
To better days, while life is changing
And even though I've had my share of pain
I've been sympathisin' and realisin'
I've got a feeling, we could be a better friend
Simply complimenting every now and then
'Cause in the morning I wake up and miss the night before
'Cause I love the music more and more

Yeah, we can sit in a distant haze
And watch rain clouds pour thoughts of greatness
To help our troubles sail real far away, oh yeah
Well, it's a struggle, every day we're stressin'
But what's a life without dedication, ah?

To soak in music, relaxation
