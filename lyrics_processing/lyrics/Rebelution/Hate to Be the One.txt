Hate to be the one who has to tell ya
Hate to be the one, aaaaa
Hate to be the one who has to tell ya
Because you're in a war zone
Get out now you don't know
I hate to be the one
Hate to be the one, aaaaa
Hate to be the one who has to tell ya
Now let me tell you as a friend, my friend
I can see it happen all over again
Yeah let me tell you as a friend, my friend
There's a theme going on and it's a trend
Well take another look
She's the type of crook
Call it kiss and run
The most devious of looks
And she don't really care
Take take and now she took
But the men still stare
And they're reaching for their books
So tell me why they say I'm better than the rest
She's a little beauty how much meaner can she get
I love her pretty eyes and I'm chasing for the tail
Devil in the detail, you should let her sail

Why? Because she said I love you boy
And love will prevail, aaaaa
Nothing that can ever go wrong
So how can I mess up?
In every single way
I hate to be the one
Hate to be the one who has to tell ya
Hate to be the one, aaaaa
Hate to be the one who has to tell ya
Because you're in a war zone
Get out now you don't know
I hate to be the one
Hate to be the one, aaaaa
Hate to be the one who has to tell ya
Take the warning,see the red lights?
Where she gone, another late night
This little girl, she not play right
You only see in the daylight - why is that?
The secret she keeping when you sleeping
She out there just creeping, I'm telling you
Wait 'til the rumor start leaking
Better listen, just peep it
Ah, next man she keeping, I'm telling you
And I know you won't believe me
But you're rising for a fall
And honestly speaking
This girl will only make you bawl
Hear what me say
And I know you won't believe me
But the next man she call
And honestly speaking
This girl won't catch you if you fall
Hear what me say
I hate to be the one
Who has got to, hate to be the one
Dollars not cents
Thousands gone, and now she's off again
Can you believe it my friend?
Oooo, flash, gone
Gone with the wind to the next top dog
Well come on I don't want to be alone
She says she loves me, that's how I know
Love grows you know
I swear on my soul
Well that's why I can never let her go, oh
Oh, never can I fail, oh no
Why? Because she said "I love you boy"
And love will prevail, aaaaa
Oh, never can I fail, oh no
Why? Because she said "I love you boy"
And love will prevail, aaaaa
Nothing that can ever go wrong
So how can I mess up? In every single way
I hate to be the one
Hate to be the one who has to tell ya
Hate to be the one, aaaaa
Hate to be the one who has to tell ya
Because you're in a war zone
Get out now, you don't know
I hate to be the one
Hate to be the one, aaaaa
