Yeah yeah yeah
Waoh-oh

I don't wanna be waiting in line
I got too many things that I could do with my time
And I don't wanna feel this confined
To city life, to city life, to city life
I can't avoid this feeling
Another siren sounds
The last straw, I'm leaving
It's time to leave this crowd

In fact, I might go
First thing in the morning
To lay low
I gotta get out of here for real

Yeah, that sounds good to me
Ah-ah
Find some cleaner air to breathe
Ah yes
Get away from everything
Ah-ah
Never ever ever ever felt

And find my way under the stars, I'll roll a sack up
And find some peace and quiet, get my spirits back up
Breathe in the oxygen, I'll find a place to shack up
That'll keep me on track, my friends
To get back
The things that I lack

The things that I lack
Yeah, that's it
