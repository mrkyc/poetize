Now, you children better watch your P's and Q's
Hang up your clothes and clean up your room
Ah, do everything that you're supposed to do
'Cause Santy Claus is watchin' you!
He's everywhere, he's everywhere!

Now, you kids better behave
Ah, get your homework every day
And try to make good grades in school
'Cause Santy Claus is watchin' you!
He's everywhere, he's everywhere!

Well, every Christmas Eve
He climbs on his sled full of toys
And spreads Christmas cheer
To all good little girls and boys

And Santy Claus say
"On Dasher and Dancer
And Prancer and Vixen
And Comet and Cupid
And Donner and Blitzen
And Bruce and Marvin!"
Say, well, Rudolph!
Say, well, say, he dislocated his hip in a twist contest
And he's all stowed up in the hospital, yes
But we've got a swingin' replacement
Say, we got the fastest steed from the sands of the 'Rabian desert, babies
Say, we got Clyde the Camel
And then he say
"On, Clyde! On, you big camel!"
And Clyde say
*Camel sounds*
Which is camel for
"Don't bug me, man, say, I'm pullin' this sled fast as I can"

Over the trees
Over the fences
Through the skies
'Cross the clouds
On the roof
Click clack click
Real quick!
'Cause here comes jolly old Saint Nick, ho, ho, ho!

Now, you children better be good
And act like all good children should
Be careful of what you say and do
'Cause Santy Claus is watchin' you!
He's everywhere, he's everywhere!

Well, every Christmas Eve
He climbs on his sled
With the fuel exhaust, side mirrors
Fox tails, mud flaps, and leopard-skin seat covers

Say, what have you got in your big bag for all the kiddies this year, Santa, hmm?
Say, I's got apples and oranges
Hundred and seventy ponies
Three thousand sets a' drums
Seven thousand comic books
And a do-it-yourself guitar course
Complete with a eight by ten color photo of Bo Diddly
Suitable for framin', yes
And with that
And leaping on his sled
And laying his finger aside of his nose
He pulled back on the reigns, cracked the whip
And took off like the first stage of a Cape Canaveral rocket
Headed straight for the ice and snowy regions of the North Pole
Which is habitated and abounding in polar bears and penguins, yes
And you could exclaim as he drove out of sight
"On Dasher and Dancer
And Prancer and Vixen
And Comet and Cupid
And Donner and Blitzen
And Bruce and Marvin!
On Clyde!"
And Clyde say
*Camel sounds*
Which is camel for
"Merry Christmas, everybody!"
"On Clyde, on you big camel!"
