Avast there, mates! You're sailing with Long John Blackbeard Pegleg Patcheye Hook!
The scourge of the Bounty Main!
The bloodthirstiest, black-heartedest pirate captain ever sailed the seven seas!
Ha ha! What say ye, we hoist the Jolly Roger, heel over to yonder Spanish galleon
Lay a few broadsides again' her timbers
Swing over there on these here lanyards with our cutlasses in our teeth
Cut out the rivets and split the booty!
What say ye to that, me hearties? Eh?
(Pirate)
I don't like it!
(Pirate Captain)
You don't like it?
