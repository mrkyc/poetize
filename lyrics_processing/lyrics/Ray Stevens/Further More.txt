'Cause baby, now that you have done me wrong it's plain to see
That you no longer want to bother me

And the way that you have been mistreating me
And lemme tell you friend that you will never get the chance to break my heart again
And furthermore

And on top of that
I don't love you anyway
Well, you told me that you'd always love me, treat me fair
But lately, baby, seems like you don't even care about me anymore
You closed the door on me
And left me blue as I can be
And I'm not gonna take it anymore
And be your fool again, like I was before
'Cause baby this is it, I quit
You can just forget that we ever met
And furthermore
