When you were young she must have wrapped yo' turban too tight
She should have kept you home on those Arabian nights
It's plain to see - you need some therapy
Osama - yo' mama could have done a lot better
Though I bet every day you did somethin' to upset her
By the way, we got an answer to your anthrax letter
New York City's where it's from - it's called a smart bomb
And I can hear yo' mama sayin' now, "You in a heap o' trouble son
Now just look what you've done!
Saw you on TV with yo' gun
Mercy sakes, I can't do a thing with ya, told ya Dubya's gonna getcha."
And I can just hear Dubya sayin', "You in a heap 'o trouble boy
And I don't think you will enjoy
Our game of search and destroy
Yeah, we got your terror right here, we gonna run it up your rear."
Osama - yo' mama didn't teach you how to act
You've crossed the line too far this time, there ain't no turnin' back
You're startin' to remind us of another maniac
Yeah, you know who, he started World War Two
Osama - yo' mama didn't teach you to behave
Now they say you're hangin' with the bats in a cave
Well, pullin' off that sneak attack was not too brave
Kinda makes us remember the seventh of December

Now just look what you've done
Saw you on TV with that gun
Goodness me, I can't do a thing with ya, told ya Dubya's gonna getcha."
And I can just hear Dubya sayin', "You in a heap 'o trouble boy
And I don't think you will enjoy
Our game of search and destroy
Yeah, we got your terror right here, we gonna run it up your rear."
Osama yo' karma's really got you in a jam
But that's just what you get - when you mess with Uncle Sam
Osama the Taliban is history
Nobody wants to see you startin' World War Three
Osama you know the al-Qaida won't last
