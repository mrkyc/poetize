Stopped by to see you
Just the other day
And I wanna say
That I finally realized
The words "I love you" don't mean a thing
It's so hard for me to see
That you meant everything to me
But I guess I gotta move on
Even though it hurts, I gotta be strong

If you don't wanna love me, don't love me
Don't wanna touch me, don't touch me
'Cause I don't want you to do anything
That you don't wanna do (And if you don't)
If you don't wanna miss me, don't miss me (Miss me)
Don't wanna kiss me, don't kiss me
'Cause I don't want you to do anything
That you don't wanna do, no

Who would have known
All the nights that you were hangin' late
All alone, I'd lay awake in my bed
Someone else was puttin' food on your plate?
I refuse to believe
That you never ever loved me
I've got to move on, our love is gone
And this house is not a home, no
You might also like
If you don't wanna love me, don't love me (Yeah)
Don't wanna touch me, don't touch me
'Cause I don't want you to do anything (Oh, baby)
That you don't wanna do (And if you don't)
If you don't wanna miss me, don't miss me (Miss me)
Don't wanna kiss me, don't kiss me
'Cause I don't want you to do anything (No)
That you don't wanna do, no (Do, no)

You can be lonely
I don't even care
But you didn't have to make me think that
You'll always be there
You said you'd be right there, so

(If you don't...)
If you don't wanna love me, don't love me
Don't wanna touch me, don't touch me (Ooh, baby)
'Cause I don't want you to do anything (I don't want you to do a damn thing for me, babe)
That you don't wanna do (Whoa, no)
If you don't wanna miss me, don't miss me (I don't want you, and don't kiss me)
Don't wanna kiss me, don't kiss me (And don't miss me, don't do a damn thing for me, baby)
'Cause I don't want you to do anything (I don't care what you'll say)
That you don't wanna do, no (You don't love me anyway)
If you don't wanna love me, don't love me (I don't want you, I don't need you)
Don't wanna touch me, don't touch me (I don't love you, I don't want you, baby)
'Cause I don't want you to do anything
That you don't wanna do
If you don't wanna miss me, don't miss me (Don't, no, ooh)
Don't wanna kiss me, don't kiss me (Don't)
'Cause I don't want you to do anything (Oh, oh)
That you don't wanna do, no (Do, do, do)
