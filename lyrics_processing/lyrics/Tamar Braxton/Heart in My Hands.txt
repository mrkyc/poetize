You left your phone on the sink
So I grabbed it without thinking
I would hand it to you as I turned to leave
Later that night as you sleep
I was kissing you and we were interrupted by an unfamiliar thing

Ring, ring, ring
Three o'clock in the morning
She's looking for you
That's when I opened up my eyes
The words filled the room
I wish I didn't see what she sent to you
Oh, I'm holding your heart in my hands
Your heart's in my hands
Oh, I'm holding your heart in my hands
And I gotta know if it beats for me, oh
Only me, oh
Only me, oh
If it beats for me, oh

Went back and forth with my mind
Should I say that I don't know?
Should I stay or should I stand right by this door?
I shouldn't have but I did
Sending several messages just to see what she just had to say to him
You might also like
Ring, ring, ring
Three o'clock in the morning
She was looking for you
That's when I opened up my eyes
The words filled the room
I wish I didn't see what she sent to you
(she sent to you)
Oh, I'm holding your heart in my hands
Your heart's in my hands
Oh, I'm holding your
Heart in my hands
And I gotta know if it beats for me, oh
Only me, oh
Only me, oh
If it beats for me, oh

I miss you
I need you
I can't wait to see you
I love you
I want you
Always thinking of you
Realize that's what I read
Feeling this pain in my chest
I hate it
The way my heart is breaking
Cause I'm holding my heart in my hands
My hands, my hands, oh
Does it beat for me, oh
Beat for me, oh
Beat for me, oh
