You slept on my couch before
I gave you some good love every night
I made sure you had everything that you wanted
Now, this new chick you're on
She don't do it right, she don't do it right
You ask for gas money, 'cause you never had your own
You on this new fish, like I ain't put you on
I ain't trippin', don't phase me now
I ain't trippin', don't phase me now, oh
I ain't trippin', don't phase me now
I ain't trippin', don't phase me now

Baby, I know the real you
Baby, I know the real you
Baby, I know the real you
Baby, I know the real you

Don't flex (Baby, I know the real you)
Don't flex (Baby, I know the real you)
Baby, don't flex (Baby, I know the real you)
Don't flex

I know where your mama stay
Your sister keep asking 'bout me
Don't front for the 'gram, babe
Them pictures be all about me
There's something about you that I just can't explain
Got me all in my feelings
Why you playin' this game?
I was around, I was down for you
And we both know it's true
Why you acting brand new?

What's this about?
Tryin' to figure you out, how you flip and then change on me
You gon' make me go crazy, crazy (Don't flex)
Actin' like you ain't worryin' about me (Don't flex)
Like I'm tryin' to work it out (Baby, don't flex)
Last thing I'm thinkin' about (Don't flex)
You and your leased Benz can both be out
My, oh, my
You're just a liar, liar
Why you gotta lie?
You ain't got a credit card, or a pot to piss in, or a window to throw it out
