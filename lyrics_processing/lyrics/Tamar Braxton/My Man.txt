Oh, oh
No, no
No, no

Boy, you let me down, I am so confused
I stood right by your side through everything that you went through
Why is she around?
Why are you so cruel?
How could you just turn your back when I stood by you?
Yeah, when you were broke, I didn't leave you
Somehow, through it all, I believed in you
No, no, no, not my man
'Cause he would never hurt me (Not my man)
Let alone, just desert me, no, no (Not my man, no, no)
No, not my man (Not my man)

Word around town is that you live with her
And you said she took your heart away, oh baby
I told them that's a lie
'Cause I don't wanna hear no bullshit stories 'bout my man
Can't stop my screamin' and yellin' (Oh, no, no, no, no, no)
I'll pass
Embarrassin' pain for me, really (Oh, no)
No, I just can't believe that you're with her
Is she the one you played me for? (My man)
Should've noticed it the day that she walked in my door (My man)
I just can't believe she stole my man
You might also like
(Not my man) Ooh, my man, oh yeah
She walked right in my door (Not my man)
Looked me in the face (No, no)
And she took my man (Not my man)
Never trust a lonely woman with the one you love (Not my man)
She ate dinner at my table (Not my man)
Even watched my kids (No, no)
And she took my man (Not my man)
Bitch actin' like she was my friend
She called me 'bout her man
What I didn't understand, she was talking 'bout my man, heifer!
(Not my man) Oh, my man, my man, my man, my man, my man
(Not my man)
My man, man, man, man, woo! (No, no, not my man)

Is this my life?
It cuts me like a knife
To know the one I love
Could leave me for a friend
(I'm not desperate, but I would reconsider)
Baby, are you sorry?
(All the years I put in this thing to be a win)
But I know it's too late, she took my man
(Not my man)
See, I was just a fool (Not my man)
Didn't wanna see the truth (No, no)
And she took my man (Not my man)
And my heart screams out loud (Not my man)
Oh, oh-oh, uh-oh
(Not my man, no, no) No, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, uh-oh
(Not my man) Yep
Oh, whoa (Not my man)
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, uh-oh (Not my man, no, no)
(Not my man)
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, uh-oh
