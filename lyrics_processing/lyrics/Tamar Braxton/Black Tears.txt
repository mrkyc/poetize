No man knows what it's like
Crying a river, a river for love
Seems like no one sees
When a woman's fed up
It's always too late and she's already given up
Now what can you do?
Now that she's not there to touch, she's not there to hold
At night...
And what would you do?
Now that she's been hurt in love
Gon' be hard to trust

'Cause she's giving so much in love
And it seems like her best just ain't enough
And it's taking more than she can give
To the point where she can't take no more
And her tears turn to black
Black tears, black tears
Black tears, black tears (I don't think ya hear me out there)
Black tears, black tears
Black tears, black tears
Black tears, black tears
Black tears, black tears
Black tears
You might also like
See I've been through it
Once or twice before
So you know that it feel ya
When a good woman's scorned
You could tried everything
To make it work
And then you realize you're standing alone
I wanna know
Now what can you do?
Now that she's not there touch, she's not there hold
At night...
And what would you do?
Now that she's been hurt in love
Gon' be hard to trust

'Cause she's giving so much in love
And it seems like her best just ain't enough
And it's taking more than she can give
To the point where she can't take no more
And her tears turn to black

Black tears, black tears
Black tears, black tears (I don't think ya feel me out there)
Black tears, black tears
Black tears, black tears
Black tears, black tears
Black tears, black tears
Black tears
Oh does it make you feel real good?
Having women cry for you, for you
Probably feeling like a real man
Don't know how you can sleep at night, at night
Tell me why does a man let a good girl go
When they do everything to keep them up
With the cooking and cleaning, is there a reason?
You wanna give it up

'Cause she's giving so much in love
And it seems like her best just ain't enough
And it's taking more than she can give
To the point where she can't take no more
And her tears turn to black

Black tears, black tears
Black tears, black tears
Black tears, black tears
Black tears, black tears
Black tears, black tears
Black tears, black tears
