Remember that time, that time I blew your mind
Now you don't wanna share, must be good to you
And didn't you say that love ain't worth your time
But you're right back here, must be good to you
:
I piece of this chain, you in danger
Ooh it's something major
You don't know what to do
Now every time I pick up my phone you on the line
Yeah, I put my hooks on you (Bitch!)
:
Hell yeah I love it, I love it
It must've been good to ya
(Must've been good)
Must've been good
Hell yeah I love it, I love it
It must've been good to ya
Must've been good to you
You love how it feels don't ya?
You love how it kills don't ya?
Look but don't stare
Bad for your eyes
I'll be ya feature
Call it Showtime
Yeah I know that it's good to ya
Get the picture?
