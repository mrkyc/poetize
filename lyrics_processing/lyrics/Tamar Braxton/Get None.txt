Uh, oh, uh-uh, no, no (Get none)
Just, just 'cause you tricked a little doe tonight (Ow)
That don't mean that you takin' me home tonight (Hey, hey, hey)
Get none, uh
No, no (Oh, oh, uh-uh)
No, no, no, no, no
Just, just 'cause you tricked a little doe tonight (Ow)

Mister first-class baller (Ooh!)
I got a few things to say to you (Okay)
Right now, you're gettin' on my nerves
Wit' your trickin', bad-habit issues (Uh-huh!)
Now, I'm sure if I was with you
No doubt, I would be laced up
But I got a term paper due, don't get it confused
My mind is on other things, not you

You can go home (Hey)
Run your phone bill up
Run your cell phone up
You don't get none
You can page me all you want (Hey)
But I won't call back, no (Hey)
No, you won't get none (No, no, no, no)
You can buy me diamonds
Nice trips on the beach
But you still don't get none (Oh, yeah)
Stop tryin' to use cash
To get you some ass
Face the facts (Hey, hey)
Nigga, you ain't gon' get none (No)

I ain't a part-time lover
There's a couple things I just don't do
I won't be no hoe, just drop my clothes
And all the silly things that you're used to
So, if you're steppin', approach me like a lady
Or there is no me at all
I take my time, won't cross the line
Until I really know, no

I've seen your type before (I've seen)
You think you've got so much game (Yeah-eah)
Money is everything
And that's all I need to be happy (Money is everything to be happy)
Soon, you're gonna see (Now see)
That's not how it should be (How it should be)
Until that day, boy, you get nothing

Okay, if it's goin' like that, let it go like this
Why you all up in the corner wit' me, drinkin' my Cris?
Straight laughin', talkin', leadin' me on?
Huh, no, that was yo' ass readin' me wrong
Now, ma, come on, you act like I'm the broke type
What?
Psh, can't be serious
You actin' like I'm the hoe type
Just 'cause you tricked a little doe tonight
That don't mean that you takin' me home tonight
Shit, is that right?
That's right, get your rap tight
And press your brakes, put off your back lights
Fool, what you sayin'? I'm playin', and I ain't gon' get it?
I'm the man, girl, look how quick I got your digits
Oh, that's just my pager
I know that, but I'm sayin' it
Well, if you know that, you know I ain't got to call you back
Poppin' Cris all night like I'mma fall for that
Uh-huh?
You need more than that to pull a baller's act
