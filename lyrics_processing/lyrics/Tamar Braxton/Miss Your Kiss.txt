Can't wait to see you, boy
'Cause you know it's been a while
Since we've had the chance
To do what we do
I'm wearin' what you like
Lying under the moonlight
How soon can you get here?
'Cause I'm ready to play, ooh yeah

I'll light fifty candles, boy
Around my bedroom
A romantic interlude's in store
Just walk through the door now

And don't rush, take your time
We've got a night
So many things we're gonna do
Ooh, baby, ooh, I'm ready
I miss your kiss
Make love tonight
I won't be shy
So many things I wanna do
Ooh, baby, ooh, I'm ready
I miss your kiss
You might also like
My mind is calling you
Anticipation's killin' me
Everything is ready
Just need you here, oh
Can't wait till our lips meet
How nice to start the evening
I'll do anything, anything you please
Tonight

I'll light fifty candles, boy
Around my bedroom
A romantic interlude's in store
Just walk through the door now

And don't rush, take your time
We've got a night
So many things we're gonna do
Ooh, baby, ooh, I'm ready
I miss your kiss
Make love tonight
I won't be shy
So many things I wanna do
Ooh, baby, ooh, I'm ready
