I thought that I knew everything about it
But then came you and ain't no doubt about it
Like I wished on a star
You, you, you, you raise the bar
And here I've been thinking I been through it all
But I can honestly say that you broke down every wall
You're the best by far
You, you, you, you raise the bar
Chorus]:
And every wrong turn that I made
And every scar
And every burn
And every pain
Led me to ya
Led me to ya
:
Turn my body into the deepest sea
Swim deep in this water of love
I ain't afraid to say you blew my mind from the start
Baby you, you, you, you raise the bar
Ooo can't nobody do me like you
Cause you're the first
The only man, on this earth
That I trust, to give my heart to
Really you, you, you, you raise the bar
You might also like:
Ooo and every wrong turn that I made
Every scar
Every burn
Every little pain
Led me to ya
Led me to ya
Oh babe and every love
That I didn't  get right
And every last tear that I cried
Led me, Led me to ya baby
Led me to ya, to you
:
Ooo don't know what I did before
I met your sexy ass and changed the score
I couldn't ask for more than who you are
Cause baby you, you, you, you raise the bar
:
And every wrong turn that I made
Every scar
Every burn
Every pain
Led me to ya
Led me to you
(Led me to you, led me to you
Led me to you, led me to you
Led me to you, led me to you)
Led me to
Led me to you
