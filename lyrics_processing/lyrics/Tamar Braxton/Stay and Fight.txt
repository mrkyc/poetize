We could walk away from this mess we made
We could live and learn, set fire to this bridge and watch it burn
We can act like it was not even really love in the first place, no
We could throw out the pictures and throw our dreams away
We could forget the words we were too afraid to say
And we could live with the mistake, tearing us apart every day
We could let all the good just fade away

But I wanna stay and fight for you
Fight till my heart is black and blue
Fight till there's nothing left
Not one single strand of the love we had
I wanna stay and fight for us
Fight like hell before I give up
Till I'm the only one, the only one in love
I'd fight for you

We could turn off our feelings and go about our days
Put on a happy face, tell everyone that we're okay
And we could just say you and me were probably never meant to be
Or we could be nothing more than a memory

But I wanna stay and fight for you
Fight till my heart is black and blue
Fight till there's nothing left
Not one single strand of the love we had
I wanna stay and fight for us
Fight like hell before I give up
Till I'm the only one, the only one in love
I'd fight for you

'Cause we done went through the fire, baby
We still survived, baby
If you know where I stand, then I'll be away
'Cause it'll never be my choice, baby, to give up on us really
When it's so rare to find in the first place
When you're the realest thing I ever met

I wanna stay and fight for you (Stay and fight, baby)
Fight till my heart is black and blue (No, no, no, no, no, no, no)
Fight till there's nothing left
Not one single strand of the love we had
I wanna stay and fight for us (Stay and fight, fight)
Fight like hell before I give up
Till I'm the only one, the only one in love (Till I am the one, the only one in love, oh)
