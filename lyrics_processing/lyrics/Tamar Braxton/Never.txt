You don't never wanna
Take the time to love me
Get back to me slowly
Always in a hurry
What did I do to deserve this?
You don't never wanna
Hold me in the morning
Takin' all the covers
Never cuddle with me
You just don't know what I'm feeling

You treat me like I'm nothing
You take me for granted, you're trippin'
Walkin' round here like I owe you somethin'
Always goin' out my damn way
Just to keep you happy
Well, since you wanna act like that

I swear you'll never kiss my lips again
I promise that you'll never feel my love again
Never again, no, never

I don't think you ever
Even noticed that I'm
Always cookin' dinner
Like every single night
Tell me, do you even care?
And I don't think you ever
Look me in the eye
Tell me, "Baby, thank you
'Cause you do a lot"
I don't even know why I'm still here
You might also like
You treat me like I'm nothing
You take me for granted, you're trippin'
Walkin' round here like I owe you somethin'
Ooh, always goin' out my damn way
Just to keep you happy
Well, since you wanna act like that

I swear you'll never kiss my lips again (Never, never gonna)
(Why you walkin' round here like I owe you somethin'?)
Never feel my love again (Never, never gonna)
Never again, no, never

Since you wanna act like that
I'mma pack my love and I ain't coming back (Ain't coming back)
And since you wanna do me this way
I'mma make sure I give your love away (So, so long)
And since you ain't really love me
I'mma find one who know (Find one who know)
And when you're alone
Don't be blowin' up my phone

Because you'll never kiss my lips again (Don't even try me, baby)
(Hey, I swear!)
I promise that you'll never feel my love again (I don't want you, babe, no, no)
Never again, no, never
I swear you'll never kiss my lips again (Never love me)
(I swear you'll never touch me, baby)
Never feel my love again (No, no)
