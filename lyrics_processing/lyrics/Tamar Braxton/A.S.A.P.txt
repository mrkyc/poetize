Pulled up real slow
Lights down real low
Boy, I can't wait to give it to ya
To touch your face and give into it
When you hear me moan
Baby, it's on
Cause I can't wait to give it to ya
Boy, I just wanna give it right now
:
There's no need to rush
My heart pound, pounds
Hands all on my body
Baby, slow down
Every single touch, I wanna feel it
Cause every second with you is the realest, oh

Boy, you know this heart belongs to you
There's nothing I won't do
Whatever you want, baby
It's no secret, I'm feinding for you
There's nothing I won't do
To give it to you ASAP
ASAP, ASAP
Give it to you
ASAP, ASAP
Give it to you
ASAP, ASAP
Imma give it to you
ASAP, ASAP

Now that we're home
Let's act like we're grown
Boy, don't be scared just talk me through it
Tell me you like just how I do it
Get full off this cake
Let you lick the plate
Come light me up just like a candle
Give me more love than I can handle
