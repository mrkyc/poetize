When he makes you feel like you're the prettiest?
He wakes me up early in the morning
With a smile and breakfast in bed
It's like a fairytale beginning
A heart full of love, and there's no end
It's got me looking kinda crazy
It's too good to be true
Ain't no man that will make me ever feel like you do
And I love it everyday, all day, 24/7 (hey)
I love it, I feel like Cupid done shot me from heaven
Undescribable
