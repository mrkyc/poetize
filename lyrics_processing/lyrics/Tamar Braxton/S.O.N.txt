I don't wanna be like this
I don't wanna fight
I don't wanna just shut down
Gotta make it right
Do this with me, please babe, please babe
:
Why when we argue
We can't even disagree?
How did we end up in a fight?
(Really?) really?
(Really?) really?
(Really?) really?
When it ain't even that serious babe
All I wanna do is make it right
(Feel me?) feel me?
(Feel me?) feel me?
(Feel me?) feel me?
And I so understand that you're a man
But you're caught in you're feelings
At the same time I'm a woman who's willing
To say I fucked up (yeah)
And you know that it's tough for me
But I'd rather lose
This argument instead of losing you
You know you like it when we makin' up
Now losing is tough
