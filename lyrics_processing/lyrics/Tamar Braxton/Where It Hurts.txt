What you gotta understand is, I'm still here
I could've been with any man I wanted
So, let's be clear

Yeah, I know that she hurt you
And under those circumstances
You got a lot of things to work through
You don't wanna take no chances
What you gotta understand is, even with all that, I'm still here

If you just show me where it hurts
I can kiss away the pain
I can make you good again if you let me
If you just show me where it hurts
I'll make it alright if you want me to
All you gotta do is show me where it hurts
Show me where it hurts, baby

I know it's hard to give in, but just try
'Cause you know that you can trust me, love you right

Yeah, I know that she hurt you
And under those circumstances
I'd never be the one to hurt you
Don't miss out on this chance (Out on the chance)
Just let yourself go (Let yourself go)
'Cause I'm still here

If you just show me where it hurts

I can make you good again if you let me

All you gotta do is show me where it hurts
Show me where it hurts, baby
Show me where it hurts
Show me where it hurts, baby

I know you see that I'm the one you need (One you need)
And it's just not fair to compare her to me
She cannot compete
We're better together than apart
You have my heart (Have my heart)
So, come on, show me, baby

Show me where it hurts
I can kiss away the pain
I can make you good again if you let me
Just show me where it hurts (Show me where it hurts)
And I'll make it alright if you want me to
Now all you gotta do is show me where it hurts
Show me where it hurts
