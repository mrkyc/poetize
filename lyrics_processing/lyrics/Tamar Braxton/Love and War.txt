Somebody said every day was gon' be sunny skies
Only Marvin Gaye and lingerie, I guess somebody lied
We started discussin' it, to fightin', then, "Don't touch me, please"
Then, it's, "Let's stop the madness, just come lay with me"
And truth be told, I'm waving my flag before it goes bad, yeah

'Cause we made it this far on for better or worse
I wanna feel it even if it hurts
If I gotta cry to get to the other side
Let's go, 'cause we're gon' survive, oh

We stay on the front lines
Yeah, but we're still here after the bomb drops
We go so hard, we lose control
The fire starts, then we explode
When the smoke clears, we dry our tears
Only in love and war

Sometimes, you're my general
You quarterback all these plays
Sometimes, you're my enemy, and I'm throwin' grenades
We'll just be chillin' and laughin', I'm layin' on your chest
I don't know what happened 'cause things just went left
But here we go, back down that road
That's just the way that it goes
You might also like
'Cause we made it this far on for better or worse
I wanna feel it even if it hurts
If I gotta cry to get to the other side
As long as you're there, I'll survive, oh

We stay on the front lines
Yeah, but we're still here after the bomb drops
We go so hard, we lose control
The fire starts, then we explode
When the smoke clears, we dry our tears
Only in love and war

As long as we make up after every fight, when it's over
You know I'm comin' home, right there where I belong
I'm takin' off this armour
Oh-oh-ooh, whoa

And we stay on the front lines (On the front lines)
Yeah, but we're still here after the bomb drops
We go so hard, we lose control
The fire starts, then we explode, baby
When the smoke clears, we dry our tears
Only in love and war
Only in love and war
