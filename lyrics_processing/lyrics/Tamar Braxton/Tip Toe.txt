Don't take nobody with you to my house
If anybody see you, then our secret gon' be out
Don't let nobody catch you by my crib
I don't want them knowin' you be goin' where I live
Just make sure you leave before the morning, break of dawn
I'll see you later
Make sure you don't wake the neighbors
See that too many people wanna know
Who that, who that, who that
So be quiet when you go

Now tip toe, now tip toe
Now tip toe, now tip toe
Now tip toe, now tip toe
Now tip toe, now tip toe
Now tip toe, now tip toe
Now tip toe, now tip toe
Now tip toe, now tip toe
Now tip toe

Boy, check it out, what we got going, boy you know
The minute you start talking, I'ma have to let you go
('Cause I don't want my business to be at my neighbor's door)
(And I don't want my business on The Wendy Williams Show)
I can tell that you're losing patience looking at your face
So get up out this club and just meet me at my place
('Cause I don't want my business to be at my neighbor's door)
(And I don't want my business on The Wendy Williams Show)

Ooh love, want nobody know that this case
You're sending me the signal like it's time to get away
(I like how you come through, and I ain't gotta say a thing)
(You sticking to these rules, you know how to play this game)
I've been keeping you around for a reason
And you look good and you give me what I needed
(I like how you come through, and I ain't gotta say a thing)
(You sticking to these rules, you know how to play this game)
