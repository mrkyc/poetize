Damn, it's so amazing
I could tell the way you chase it
Nothing better than, no sweeter than my love
I could tell so baby face it
I know you been craving
Baby, nothing can compare to my love
(Pre-Chorus)
I got that comeback candy that you never ever ever get tired of (tired of)
Just like a waterfall, run for cover
Baby, I swear it'll drown ya (drown ya) (you love it)
(Chorus)
And baby you love it, you love it, you love it, you love it (you love it)
And baby you love it, you love it, you love it, you love it (you know you do)
So tell me you want it, you want it, you want it, you want it
Cause baby you love it, you love it, you love it, you love it (you know you do)

(Verse 2)
Damn, I feel you shaking
Got you faded, faded, faded
You know them other girls can't do the things I do
Yeah, speeding up the tempo
Show me how deep your love can go
Boy, you know I'm strung out on you
You might also like(Pre-Chorus)
I got that comeback candy that you never ever ever get tired of (tired of)
Just like a waterfall, run for cover
Baby, I swear it'll drown ya (drown ya) (you love it)
(Chorus)
And baby you love it, you love it, you love it, you love it (you love it)
And baby you love it, you love it, you love it, you love it (you know you do)
So tell me you want it, you want it, you want it, you want it
Cause baby you love it, you love it, you love it, you love it (you know you do)
(Bridge)
I'mma tie your hands around your back
C'mon daddy, tell mommy how bad do you want it
Want it just like that
Cowboy, you want me to saddle my pony
Play truth or dare, touch me right there
(Chorus)
And baby you love it, you love it, you love it, you love it (you love it)
And baby you love it, you love it, you love it, you love it (Boy I know, I know you do)
So tell me you want it, you want it, you want it, you want it
So baby jump on it, jump on it, jump on it
