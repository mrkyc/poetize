It's 4 AM, I don't know where to go
Everywhere is closed, I should just go home, yeah
My feet are taking me to your front door
I know I shouldn't though, heaven only knows

That, ooh, the side effect to my loneliness is you

Ooh, you're all that I want
No good at giving you up
Come on and give me some love tonight
Ooh, you're all that I want
No good at giving you up
Come on and give me some love tonight

This happens every time I try to mix
Decision making with one too many drinks

But, ooh, if late-night friends have consequences, cool, yeah

Ooh, you're all that I want
No good at giving you up
Come on and give me some love tonight
Ooh, you're all that I want
No good at giving you up
Come on and give me some love tonight
Ooh, I think about it all the time
Make it happen in my mind, I'm telling you, yeah
Ooh, you're all that I want
No good at giving you up
Come on and give me some love tonight
