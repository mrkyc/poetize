You don't gotta say it, I know you ain't stayin' over
And I won't even mention the fact that you're never sober
I never know which side I'm gonna get tonight
And the closer we get, the less I think I know you

But you're just my type
The kind that only calls me late at night
You can't decide if you'll be yours or mine
I hate to say it, but you're just my type
Yeah, you're just my type, yeah, yeah

And I'm foolin' myself, 'cause I know that I'll never change ya
But you told me the truth, so I guess I can't really blame ya
No, you're not the one, but you're all I want, yeah
People say I'll get hurt, I don't know what they're so afraid of

But you're just my type
The kind that only calls me late at night
You can't decide if you'll be yours or mine
I hate to say it, but you're just my type
Yeah, you're just my type, yeah, yeah
