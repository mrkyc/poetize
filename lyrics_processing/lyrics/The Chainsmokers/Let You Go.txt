You end up alone after all that you've done
All that you paid for
Did you get what you wanted?
You loaded a gun with all you were made of
When you're alone
People don't think you know what you're made of, oh
Are you better than me?
It's not up to say it's all that you wait for
Now I'll find a way
I'm seeing it through, can you not be hateful
While we're alive
Can we relax that, that what our maids for?

You were there for me, and I was there for you
How will I let you go?
You will always be the one that I regret
How will I let you go?

You're here in the way
How could you stay after that I paid for
Leave any time, won't let you wait
How could you be assured?
You're holding out hope
I'm seeing it, too, I'm trying to follow
I've been through hell and back again
I've come to understand that when
You tell me that I can't pretend
I either care about your stuff
Make the most of the things that might be rough
I let you go

Holding out hope for you
Holding out hope, holding out hope for you

You were there for me, and I was there for you
How will I let you go?
You will always be the one that I regret
How will I let you go? (go) (go)

Let you go, let you go
Let you go, let you go

Holding out hope for you
Holding out hope, holding out hope for you

You were there for me, and I was there for you
I remember times like that
You will always be the one that I regret
How will I let you go?

Let you go, let you go
