Droppin' bombs in cups of coffee
You said it hit you all at once
I'm already tired and it's still mornin'
Then you clear your throat
Deep down I know that this is done
You tell me you're sorry and I'm laughin'
You say sometimes these things just don't work out
'Cause you're only human, this shit happens
Wait, I don't mean to stop you
But darlin', I have to cut you off

Don't say, don't say you're human
Don't say, don't say it's not your fault
I won't take the bait or these excuses that you're usin'
Don't say, don't say you're human

Don't say, don't say
Don't say, don't say
Don't say you're human

Say you regret the way you acted
Come on, admit you let me down
Say that I'm better in your absence
Go right ahead, say almost anything you want

Just don't say, don't say you're human
Don't say, don't say it's not your fault
I won't take the bait or these excuses that you're usin'
Don't say, don't say you're human

Don't say, don't say
Don't say, don't say
Don't say you're human

Don't say, don't say you're human
Don't say, don't say it's not your fault
I won't take the bait or these excuses that you're usin'
Don't say, don't say you're human
Just don't say, don't say you're human
Don't say, don't say it's not your fault
I won't take the bait or these excuses that you're usin'
Don't say, don't say you're human, oh

Don't say, don't say
Don't say, don't say
Don't say you're human
No way, no way you're human
