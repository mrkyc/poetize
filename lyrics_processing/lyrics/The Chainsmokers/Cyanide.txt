Cap and a stem with the red wine
You ain't got friends, so you're at mine
I hear you're in town for the weekend
(I swear I'm not trying to get even)
Couple texts from my ex, you were homies
(Never took the time to get to know me)
And now you're standing in the kitchen doing blow, please

You kiss me on some cyanide
It kills me, you feel different when we're eye to eye
Listen, I don't wanna be your alibi
You feel too much, so miss me on your ride tonight
(Hey!)

A day goes by and I want you
Spent two nights in your bedroom
We can get high by the ocean
And I'll try to hide my emotion
3-6-9, you can call me
Only stay at my place when you're lonely
If you need me for the night, I gotta know, please

We'll never go back, back, back to the way things were
And I was intact, that's fact, 'til you struck my nerve
Once I felt the way it hit, I was addicted to this
I would never go back, back, back, oh

(You kiss me on some cyanide)

Am I gonna know when it's over? (When it's over)
'Cause I gotta know who's next
I'm tired of letting hope control me
Set me free

You kiss me on some cyanide
It kills me, you feel different when we're eye to eye
Listen, I don't wanna be your alibi
You feel too much, so miss me on your ride tonight

(You feel, you feel)

You kiss me on some cyanide

You feel too much, so miss me on your ride tonight
