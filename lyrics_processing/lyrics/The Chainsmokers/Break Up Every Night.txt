She wants to break up every night
She wants to break up every night
Don't wanna wait until she finally decides to feel it
She wants to break up every night
Then tries to fuck me back to life
How can I help it if I like the way she makes me feel it?

"Give me time, give me space, give me reason."
That's what you tell me when you're leaving
Change your mind every night like the seasons
You're insatiable

And I know you say you want it now (want it now)
Give me the runaround (runaround)
Which one am I with now?
She's got seven personalities, every one's a tragedy

She wants to break up every night
She wants to break up every night
Don't wanna wait until she finally decides to feel it
She wants to break up every night
Then tries to fuck me back to life
How can I help it if I like the way she makes me feel it?

Been to France one time and you're Parisian
Joined the real world, new season
Check my phone, check my pulse, ain't a reason
I kinda love it though

And I know you say you need me now (need me now)
Give me the runaround (runaround)
Which one am I with now?
She's got seven personalities, every one's a tragedy

She wants to break up every night
She wants to break up every night
Don't wanna wait until she finally decides to feel it
She wants to break up every night
Then tries to fuck me back to life
How can I help it if I like the way she makes me feel it?
She wants to break up every night
She wants to break up every night
Don't wanna wait until she finally decides to feel it

So I build the bridges up, the bridges up
Build the bridges up again

Build the bridges up again
Build the bridges up, the bridges up
Build the bridges up again, oh

Don't wanna wait until she finally decides to feel it
