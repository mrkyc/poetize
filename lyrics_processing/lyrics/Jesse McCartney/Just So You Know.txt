I shouldn't love you, but I want to
I just can't turn away
I shouldn't see you, but I can't move
I can't look away
I shouldn't love you, but I want to
I just can't turn away
I shouldn't see you, but I can't move
I can't look away

And I don't know how to be fine when I'm not
'Cause I don't know how to make a feeling stop

Just so you know
This feeling's taking control of me
And I can't help it
I won't sit around, I can't let 'em win now
Thought you should know
I've tried my best to let go of you
But I don't want to
I just gotta say it all before I go
Just so you know

It's gettin' hard to be around you
There's so much I can't say
Do you want me to hide the feelings
And look the other way?

This emptiness is killing me
And I'm wonderin' why I've waited so long
Lookin' back I realize
It was always there, just never spoken
I'm waitin' here
Been waitin' here
Mm, oh

Just so you know
This feeling's taking control of me

I won't sit around, I can't let 'em win now
