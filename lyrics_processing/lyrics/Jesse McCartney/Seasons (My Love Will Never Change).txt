Baby, let me take your coat
Let's sit down and talk
I already heard the news
Plus, your mama told me, too
I know it's complicated
Work got you all frustrated
(They laid you off)
But, don't trip, you got me
And we'll get through it, baby

I'm in it for the long run (Even if we' strugglin')
Every day (We gon' be hustlin')
Every day (We gon' be hustlin') together

Even though I know
Seasons will change
But, my love will stay the same
Put that on everything, oh, yeah
If the world's fallin' apart
You still gon' have my heart
Put that everything
Nothin's gonna change

If the world's fallin' apart (If the world's falling)
You still gon' have my heart (You can still have it)
