My, my, my, my

She steps to the groove, her body in tune
She stops the whole room, she got to everybody
The red of her lips, so hard to resist
The curve to her hips, I gotta tell somebody
I'm helplessly falling into your eyes like whoa
I'm hopelessly in love for the first time like whoa

Gotta make ya my baby
Wanna make ya my baby
Gotta make ya my baby
Wanna make ya my baby
Gotta make ya my baby
Wanna make ya my baby
Gotta make ya my baby
My baby

She throws me a sign (Sign), a wink and a smile (Smile)
I stopped on a dime, could she be looking at me
With nothing to prove (To prove), she's makin' her move (A move)
And as she walked through, leaned in to tell me somethin'
I'm helplessly falling into your eyes like, whoa, whoa (Whoa, whoa)
I'm hopelessly in love for the first time like, whoa, whoa
(Whoa, whoa)

She took my hand and led me 'cross the dance floor
Everybody's watching like oh no
The kind of girl you could only ever pray for
All the cameras flashing, like oh no no no no
And as we left together
She whispered something soft and sweet so right
She said, "I'd love to love you all through the night"
I'm helplessly falling into your eyes, like whoa (Whoa, whoa)
I'm hopelessly in love for the first time, like whoa (Whoa, whoa)
