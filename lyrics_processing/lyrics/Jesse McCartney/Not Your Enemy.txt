Sorry for all the times he lied and left your heart hanging
I can't imagine what that feels like
But that was another place, and that was another time
It's not fair to blame me for all his crimes
Just for a minute, give me a chance, let me inside
Just for a minute, baby, just for a moment
Let me prove I'll do things right

Let down your guard, and show me your colors
Don't fight it anymore, show me you're with me
Open your arms, I'm not like the others
So don't fight it anymore, no
What will it take for me to make you see?
I'm not your enemy

Funny how the day that he left, I wasn't even there
It's become a nightmare, but I'll never rest
'Til you give your all, I'll take nothing less
'Til I hear happily ever after, the end
Just for a minute, give me a chance, let me inside
Just for a minute, baby, just for a moment
Let me prove I'll do things right

Let down your guard, and show me your colors
Don't fight it anymore, show me you're with me
Open your arms, I'm not like the others
So don't fight it anymore, no
What will it take for me to make you see
I'm not your enemy

How do you expect things to get any better
If you keep me on the sideline?
Don't you know, there's a million things I wanna do
But you gotta meet me halfway, you gotta try, whoa

Let down your guard, and show me your colors
(And show me your colors)
Don't fight it anymore, show me you're with me
(Don't fight it anymore, show me you're with me)
Open your arms, I'm not like the others
(Open your arms, I'm not like the others)
So don't fight it anymore, no oh
(So don't fight it anymore)
What will it take for me to make you see, oh
(What will it take for me to make you see)
