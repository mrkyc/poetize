I don't know what to say to you really
You're holding on to this thin idea
That somehow I will still be standing here
When you haven't changed
Don't matter what you say
Cause I've been hearing 'bout the temporary fixes
The drunken walks, the foreign men you can't remember kissin'
So I would rather you enjoy yourself
Than lie to me and tell me that your someone else
You don't have to change
You can stay the same

The truth is that there's nothing wrong
With what you're doing
You're just painting the picture
The way that you want me to view it
You don't have to babe
Throw your brush away
Cause we can move on
We can be friends, it'd be better
If you'd stop protecting my feeling in every single letter
Give it to me straight (To me straight)
Girl I'll be ok (Na na na na)

When it was good
It was great, girl I won't deny
But there was nothing we could do
About the place in time
Maybe in the future
We can give this thing another try, baby
But until then
I wish the best for you
And your children too
