When we on the cloud and we up this high
Every other thing is such a waste of time
'Cause as long as we is always you and me, me
We can go and kiss the world goodbye

For every time they said it won't last
We kiss and tell then push it right back
'Cause we been there, done that
Bulletproof, bounce back
We ain't got nothin' to prove
We had to tune out all the noises
These people makin' ugly choices
Yeah, they talk shit, one click
That must be exhaustin'
Pushing me closer to you

When we on the cloud and we up this high
Every other thing is such a waste of time
'Cause as long as we is always you and me, me
We can go and kiss the world goodbye
Tryna bring us down but they just can't climb
Can't get off the ground 'cause the hate don't fly
But as long as we is always you and me, me
We can go and kiss the world goodbye

They see us happy so they're gettin' mad
I guess they jealous they don't have that
When they go off go off, go off, baby, let it roll off
I'll just keep rollin' with you (Woo)

When we on the cloud and we up this high
Every other thing is such a waste of time
'Cause as long as we is always you and me, me
We can go and kiss the world goodbye
Tryna bring us down but they just can't climb
Can't get off the ground 'cause the hate don't fly
But as long as we is always you and me, me
We can go and kiss the world goodbye


As long as we is always you and me, me
We can go and kiss the world goodbye

When we on the cloud and we up this high
Every other thing is such a waste of time
'Cause as long as we is always you and me, me
We can go kiss the world goodbye
Tryna bring us down but they just can't climb
Can't get off the ground 'cause the hate don't fly
But as long as we is always you and me, me
