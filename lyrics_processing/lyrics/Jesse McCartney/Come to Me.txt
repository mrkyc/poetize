Under the silver stars
Right where he broke your heart
Girl you know I'll give you anything
I wanna hold your hand
And say the words he never said
I'll make you promises you can believe

Let me be the one
Telling you it's alright
Sharing the smiles and tears you cry
Let me be the one
Lovin' you when you're weak
For all the strength you need
You can come to me

When you're down and you feel so lonely
Turn around
You can come to me
When you're down baby
I will be the only
Come to me
You can just be yourself
'Cause I don't want nobody else
All of your secrets are safe with me
For the kind of love you can trust
For more than just a crush
Baby why don't you just
Come to me
