Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

It's been about a year now (Now)
Ain't seen or heard from you (Yeah)
I've been missing you crazy (Oh)
How do you, how do you sleep?
I found the letter you wrote me (Yeah)
It still smells just like you (Oh)
Damn, those sweet memories (Yeah)
How do you, how do you sleep? (How do you sleep?)

Tried my best at movin' on
Have yet to find a girl like you (Uh-huh)
See, things now I didn't before
Now wishing I had more time with you (Uh-huh)
How do you stay awake knowing all I do is think of you? (Uh-huh)
All the things we thought about
Then that will never happen again
If I could just see you

If I had my way, I'd come and getcha, girl
In your favorite car with the missing top
Remember 'round my way where we used to park
And did all those things to steal your heart

Baby, all that I hear from my friends again, again
And again (Come and ask 'bout you)
They say, "We saw your girl at the game, and damn, we gotta say a big mistake by you"
Not only does your body bang, but I miss the conversation too
Tell me that you're gettin' no sleep
Can't think, can't eat, 'til I come see you
If I had my way, I'd come and getcha, girl
In your favorite car with the missing top
Remember 'round my way where we used to park
And did all those things to steal your heart
