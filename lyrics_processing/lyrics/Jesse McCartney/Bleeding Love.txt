Closed off from love, I didn't need the pain
Once or twice was enough and it was all in vain
Time starts to pass, before you know it, you're frozen
But something happened for the very first time with you
My heart had melted to the ground, found something true
And everyone's looking 'round thinking I'm going crazy, baby

But I don't care what they say, I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closing
You cut me open and I

Bleeding Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love Bleeding
I keep bleeding
I keep, keep bleeding love Bleeding
I keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
You cut me open

Trying hard not to hear, but they talk so loud
Their piercing sounds fill my ears, try to fill me with doubt
Yet I know that their goal is to keep me from falling Whoa, whoa
Oh, but nothing's greater than the rush
That comes with your embrace
And in this world of loneliness, I see your face
Yet everyone around me thinks that I'm going crazy
Crazy
Maybe, maybe
