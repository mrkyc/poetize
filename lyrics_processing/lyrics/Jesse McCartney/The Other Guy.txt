The selfish part of me needs for you to stay
Cause girl you keep a smile stretched across my face
And I would give anything now
But you would lose everything now
The way your lips move when you say my name
The smell of your hair on my pillow case
And I would give anything now
But you would lose everything now
If I'd had it my way I'd never let you walk out the door
And my heart is heavy with something that I just can't ignore

Girl, I'm sitting here wondering what it is that we've done
Baby who am I to be that other guy?
Cause I've seen tables turned, a world of hurt
I'd never wanna feel twice
I know what it's like from the other side
So baby who am I to be that other guy?

This could be your home, girl, a special place
Something much more than your great escape
Girl I would give anything now
If you didn't had everything now
He doesn't have to hear that you feel the same
You tell me that your love for me will never change
Unless you change everything now
It doesn't mean anything now
If it's him that you've chosen
Then we need to stop closing the door
Cause while he's at home waiting
We can't pretend there's something more

Ooh, cause no matter what you do a heart will break
