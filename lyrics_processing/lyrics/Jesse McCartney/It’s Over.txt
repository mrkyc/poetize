We've run out of words, we've run out of time
We've run out of reasons, really, why are we together?
We both know it's over, baby, bottom line
It's best we don't even talk at all, whoa
Don't call me even if I should cross your mind
Hard enough, I don't need to hear your voice on my messages
Let's just call it quits, it's probably better so
If I'm not returning your calls, it's 'cause

'Cause I'm not coming back, I'm closing the door
I used to be trippin' over missin' you, but I'm not anymore
I got the picture phone, baby, your picture's gone
Couldn't stand to see your smile, every time you dialed

'Cause it's over
Girl, you know it's over this time
So when you call, I'm pressing seven
Don't wanna hear your messages, messages
I'm tryna erase you from my mind
'Cause it's over
I swear it, girl, it's over this time
So don't be calling, leaving messages
Don't wanna know where ya been
Baby, 'cause it's over

I still wake up every morning quarter to ten
Still eat my cereal right at the kitchen table
I can't even remember how long it's been
No trouble stayin' occupied, oh (Oh)
They ask about you whenever I come around (I come around)
I do what I can not to put my business in the streets
Last thing I need's another episode
Keep conversations short and sweet because

'Cause I'm not coming back, I'm closing the door
I used to be trippin' over missin' you, but I'm not anymore
I got the picture phone, baby, your picture's gone
Couldn't stand to see your smile, every time you dialed

'Cause it's over (Girl, it's over)
Girl, you know it's over this time
So when you call, I'm pressing seven
Don't wanna hear your messages, messages
I'm tryna erase you from my mind
'Cause, baby, it's over ('Cause it's over)
I swear it, girl, it's over this time
So don't be calling, leaving messages
(No) Don't wanna know where ya been (Oh no)
Baby, 'cause it's over
You know that it's over when the burnin' and the yearnin'
Inside your heart (Heart) ain't there anymore (There anymore)
And you know that you're through when she don't do to you
And move you like the way she moved you before (She moved you before)
And you wanna pull her close, but your heart has froze
You kiss her, but her eyes don't close
Then she goes out of your heart forever
And it hurts you, but you know that it's better

Girl, you know it's over (Over)
Girl, you know it's over this time (It's over)
So when you call, I'm pressing seven (It's over this time)
Don't wanna hear your messages, messages
I'm tryna to erase you from my mind (Whoa, girl, you know)
'Cause it's over (Over)
I swear it, girl, it's over this time (It's over)
So don't be calling, leaving messages
Don't wanna know where ya been (It's over this time)
Baby, 'cause it's over, yeah
'Cause it's over
Girl, you know it's over this time
So when you call, I'm pressing seven
Don't wanna hear your messages, messages
I'm tryna erase you from my mind (I'm tryna erase you from my mind)
'Cause it's over
I swear it, girl, it's over this time
So don't be callin', leaving messages
Don't wanna know where ya been
