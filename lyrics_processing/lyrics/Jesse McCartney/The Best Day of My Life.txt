Woke up around a half past ten
Can't believe that I'm late again
Put down about a quart of caffeine
To start my pulse and then
I grabbed my jeans off the floor
Then I hit the door
Just the same old same
It goes to show, you never know
When everything's about to change

Just another day
That started out like any other
Just another girl
Who took my breath away
Then she turned around
She took me down
Just another day that I
Had the best day of my life

Can't say exactly what it was
She's not the usual type
She wore a cowboy hat with the red Prada boots
And a Gwen Stefani smile
Then she pulled out a pen
And surprised me when
She wrote her number on my hand
Then she was gone, from now on
I'm gonna be a different man

Just another day
That started out like any other
Just another girl
Who took my breath away
Then she turned around
She took me down
Just another day that I
Had the best day of my life

I guess it goes to show
You never really know when everything's about to change

Just another day
That started out like any other
Just another girl
Who took my breath away
Then she turned around
She took me down
Just another day that I
Had the best day of my life
Just another day
That started out like any other
Just another girl
Who took my breath away
Then she turned around
She took me down
Just another day that I
Had the best day of my life
Best day of my life
Just like any other
Had the best day of my life
Best day of my life
Best day of my life
