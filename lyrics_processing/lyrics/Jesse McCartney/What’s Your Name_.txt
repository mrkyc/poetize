Oh, oh, uh, uh

I turn around again and suddenly your gone
I wanna get to know you, but I don't know who you are
You're the kind of girl who makes me stop and lose my mind
I wanna get together but you're oh so hard to find
I see you when I'm at the Starbucks as your walkin' out the door
I see you when I'm rentin' movies when your leaving the store
I need an opportunity
There's something I wanna ask
I never seem to ever get the chance

What's your name?
What's your name?
Oh, I really wanna know
You got me going crazy
And I want you more and more
Oh hey, this could be something real
I gotta let you know the way I feel
What's your name?
What's your name?
Oh, I really wanna know
Cause every time I get there
But it's right before you go
Oh hey, if only you could see
I wanna get to know you
And to get you knowing me

See you at the mall
You hanging out with all your friends
I'm waiting to make my move
You go before I get the chance
You know you got me tripping
Thinking 'bout you day and night
But I can't get to know you
If you don't know i'm alive
I see you when you're at the beach
And your loading up the car
I see you when i'm at the concert
When the lights go dark
There's something I got to find out
If I ever get the chance
There's only three words I wanna ask

What's your name?
