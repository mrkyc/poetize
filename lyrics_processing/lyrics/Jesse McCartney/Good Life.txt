If I were you, I'd be taking it easy
Kick back and relax for a little while
We'll all still be here tomorrow
Take time just to act like a little child
No matter what the world has in store for us
You got the ring that better get off of us
Reach out for a comfortable chair
Rejoice and throw your arms in the air

'Cause it's a good life, so why y'all trippin'?
The good life's slippin' away
It's a good life so why y'all trippin'?
The good life's slippin' away
It's a good life, so why y'all trippin'?
The good life's slippin' away
It's a good life, so why y'all trippin'?
The good life's slippin' away

If your boss is giving you pressure
Let go, take a breather in the park
You've got to find out what's your pleasure
In time, you'll be singing like a lark
Pretty soon your sorry will chime for all
Somebody will heed your call
Reach out for a comfortable chair
Rejoice and throw your arms in the air

Cast aside those cloudy days, crushes are hard to bear
