She movin' like this, like that
Move up, move back
Yeah, drop it low
Man you see
She put it on me
She clap that ass like a pro

She windin' it, she grindin' it
Ooh Aah, like the way she handle it
Ooh Aah, like the way she shakin' it
She make your boy get up, up!

Told her, gon' let it move you
It's more than a beat to dance to!
Let the music fill you up!
Get up and away. Up, up, and away
Better move out the way, 'cause here she comes!
You ain't never seen nobody get high like
What I'm about to show you is gonna be the highlight
Get up and away. Up, up, and away
Better move out the way, 'cause here she comes!
Everybody! E-everybody!
Yeah

She make my booty go boom, boom, clap
When she pop like that
Makes my body explode
I ain't ever seen it quite like this
She great like this
She the shit and she know



I'll tell you one time, so listen real close
I'm the best of the best; don't even have to boast
Coast to coast, they know what I be
Don't want enemy, and nobody steps after me
Don't wanna start somethin', and there'll be nothin'
You never heard of me? Imma screw you somethin'
If you ain't got game, don't step to the flo'
Just pack your bags, and leave the town, hahaha!

Get up and away. Up, up, and away
Better move out the way, 'cause here she comes!
You ain't never seen nobody get high like
What I'm about to show you is gonna be the highlight
Get up and away. Up, up, and away
Better move out the way, 'cause here she comes!
Everybody! E-everybody!
