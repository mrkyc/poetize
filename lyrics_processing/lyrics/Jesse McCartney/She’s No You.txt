They got a lotta girls who know they got it goin' on
But nothing's ever a comparison to you
Now can't you see that you're the only one I really want?
And everything I need is everything you do

Any girl walk by, don't matter
'Cause you're looking so much better
Don't ever need to get caught up in jealousy
She could be a supermodel
Every magazine, the cover
She'll never ever mean a thing to me

She's no you (Oh, no)
You give me more than I could ever want
She's no you (Oh, no)
I'm satisfied with the one I got
'Cause you're all the girl that I ever dreamed
She's only a picture on a magazine
She's no you
She's no you

They got a lotta girls who dance in all the videos
But I prefer the way you do, the way you move
You're more than beautiful and I just wanna let you know
That all I ever need is what I got with you

Any girl walk by, don't matter
Every time, you're looking better
I think you're perfect, there ain't nothin' I would change
She could be a supermodel
Every magazine, the cover
She'll never ever take my heart away

She's no you (Oh, no)
You give me more than I could ever want
She's no you (Oh, no)
I'm satisfied with the one I got
'Cause you're all the girl that I ever dreamed
She's only a picture on a magazine
She's no you
She's no you

No one's ever gonna get to me, oh
The way you do now, baby, can't you see
That you're the one, the only one
Who's ever made me feel this way?
Nothing's ever comin' even close, no
No one's ever been comparable to you
Oh, ooh, yeah
Ah, ah
I don't want nothin' I don't got
I don't need nothin' but you
I can't get more than you give me
So don't stop anything you do
You're all that, all that and then some
You know what, just what I need
And no girl, no place, nowhere
Could mean a thing to me

She's no you (Oh, no)
You give me more than I could ever want
She's no you (Oh, no)
I'm satisfied with the one I got
'Cause you're all the girl that I ever dreamed
She's only a picture on a magazine
She's no you (She's no you, girl)
She's no you

She's no you (They got a lotta girls who know they got it goin' on)
You give me more than I could ever want
She's no you (Now, can't you see that you're the only one I really want?)
I'm satisfied with the one I got
'Cause you're all the girl that I ever dreamed
She's only a picture on a magazine
She's no you (She's no you)
