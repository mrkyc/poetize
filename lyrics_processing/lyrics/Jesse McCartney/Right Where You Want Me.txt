Girl, there's somethin' 'bout me that you oughta know
I've never felt the need to lose control
Always held on back and played it slow
But not this time

Baby, don't be gentle
I can handle anything

Baby, take me on a journey, I've been thinkin' lately
I could use a little time alone with you
Crazy, let's do something maybe
Please, don't take your time
You got me right where you want me (Ooh)
Right where you want me (Whoa, whoa, oh)

Girl, I'm gonna let you have your way with me
But when you move like that, it's hard to breathe
I never thought that it could be like this
But I was wrong

Baby, don't be gentle
I can handle anything

Can't explain it, how you swept me off my feet, unexpectedly
In slow motion, my imagination's running
Tryna keep my body still
Oh, I can hardly stand the thrill, yeah

Well, baby, don't be gentle
I can handle anything

Baby, take me on a journey, I've been thinkin' lately

Please, don't take your time (Maybe, yeah)
You got me right where you want me (Me)
