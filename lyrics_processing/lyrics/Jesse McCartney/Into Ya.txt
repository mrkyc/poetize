Oh, uh, uh

If you let me, put a lil into ya
For so long, I've been tryin' to get in it
Let me in your brain, I'll be in your heart
I'll be that good thing that you just can't put down
Get up in my canopy
Bring that over here, girl, and talk to me
While you're on your back, I'ma touch you slowly
Keep you paralyzed so you barely move
Feel like I just struck gold, you a fantasy (Fantasy)
So tell me, what's the business been
Got me about to pop, genie in a bottle
Let's make a toast 'cause I'ma cherish you

Now, girl, it's your turn to take the reins
Now show me what you gonna do
'Cause, girl, I got your remedy, oh

If you let me, put a lil into ya
For so long I've been tryin' to get into ya
Let me in your brain, I'll be in your heart
I'll be that good thing that you just can't put down
If you let me, put a lil into ya
For so long I've been tryin' to get into ya
Let me in your brain, I'll be in your heart
I'll be that good thing that you just can't put down

Baby, your soft skin is every indication to me
(Every indication to me)
That you need me to hold, protect you from the cold
And then just sing you to sleep
I got so much love to give, but I ain't found a recipient
Yeah, I can trust the two of ya, oh
Everything they told me, right before the sex with me

Now, girl, it's your turn to take the reins
Now show me what you gonna do
'Cause, girl, I got your remedy, oh

If you let me, put a lil into ya

Can't put down, girl, get down
Help! It's too late cause it's 'bout to go down
