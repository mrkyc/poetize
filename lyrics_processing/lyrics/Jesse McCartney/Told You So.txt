Hey, oh
Oh no, oh no, whoa
Oh no, oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh

Lookin' at ya now I can tell
That you and your new relationship ain't goin' well
There's no reason your name should come up on my cell
Unless you're unhappy, but that shouldn't be the case
'Cause you said
Said he was the one, baby, yes you said
Said you were in love, love
When you left me, you said that you wouldn't be comin' back
Remember that? But I never agreed

I hate to say it, but I told you so
Told you if you left that you were gon' be miserable
Guess he don't do it like me or else you wouldn't be
Runnin' back to the past, it was you that left me
I hate to say it, but you know I'm right
Every time you're up, you're callin' for me late at night
But now that you ain't got me, tell me where you gon' be
'Cause I can't take you back, no, my heart won't let me

Girl, you know he can't touch like I do
I don't see you trippin' or flippin' over his moves
Don't take a genius to see he ain't that dude
But you let him back, you don't know what you was on
When you said
Said he was the one, baby, yes you said
Said you were in love, love
When you left me you, said that you wouldn't be comin' back
Remember that? But I never agreed

I hate to say it, but I told you so
Told you if you left that you were gon' be miserable
Guess he don't do it like me or else you wouldn't be
Runnin' back to the past, it was you that left me
I hate to say it, but you know I'm right
Every time you're up, you're callin' for me late at night
But now that you ain't got me, tell me where you gon' be
'Cause I can't take you back, no, my heart won't let me

You fell on hard times, it seems
But you ain't gettin' no sympathy
No, baby, not from me 'cause I told you, you should never leave
See, you chose this road, so you gotta go it alone
Remember I told you so, oh, ooh
I hate to say it, but I told you so
Told you if you left that you were gon' be miserable
(Gon' be miserable)
Guess he don't do it like me (Oh) or else you wouldn't be (Oh)
Runnin' back to the past (Hey), it was you that left me (Oh)
I hate to say it but you know I'm right (You know I'm right)
Every time you're up, you're callin' for me late at night
But now that you ain't got me, tell me where you gon' be (oh)
'Cause I can't take you back, no, my heart won't let me

Heart can't take you back, no
No
