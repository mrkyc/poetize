Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

It's been about a year now
Ain't seen or heard from you
I've been missing you crazy
How do you, how do you sleep?
I found the letter you wrote me
It still smells just like you
Damn, those sweet memories
How do you, how do you sleep? (How do you sleep?)

Tried my best at movin' on
Have yet to find a girl like you (Uh-huh)
See, things now I didn't before
Now wishing I had more time with you (Uh-huh)
How do you stay awake knowing all I do is think of you? (Uh-huh)
All the things we thought about
Then never will have done happen again
If I could just see you

If I had my way, I'd come and getcha, girl
In your favorite car with the missing top
Remember 'round my way where we used to park
And did all those things to steal your heart

How do you, how do you sleep?
I found the letter you wrote me
It still smells just like you
Damn, those sweet memories
How do you, how do you sleep? (How do you sleep?)

Baby, all that I hear from my friends again, again
And again (Come and ask 'bout you)
They say, "We saw your girl at the game, and damn, we gotta say a big mistake by you"
Not only does your body bang, but I miss the conversation too
Tell me that you're gettin' no sleep
Can't think, can't eat, 'til I come see you

If I had my way, I'd come and getcha, girl
In your favorite car with the missing top
Remember 'round my way where we used to park
And did all those things to steal your heart

Look, now it's been about a year and I'm tryin to figure out, how could ya?
Forget about who loves you the most, why would ya?
Heal my heart (Heart), heal my brain (Brain)
Oh, how I wish you could feel my pain
'Cause I couldn't get you off my mind if I tried (Hey)
Twenty-four seven (Three, six, five)
And my nights so cold (Cold), days so long (Long)
They say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
Well, it's gone and I'm trippin' how much I miss it
And you steady walkin 'round like I never existed
And it's hard to understand (Hey), you got another plan (Hey)
Tryin' to play harder, you got another man
But you'll never find another like moi (Moi)
That have you ridin' 'round in a drop top car (Car)
Baby, you a star and it's time that you know it
So much love and it's time that we show it (Luda!)

It's been about a year now
