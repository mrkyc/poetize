Lipstick on my cigarette
How you used to hog the bed
The little shit that I can't forget
I wonder where you are
Still got your apartment key
Voice mails that I can't delete
Man, I miss how it used to be, I wonder where you are

I reminisce with the stars tonight
And I think of how we knew them all by name
But they don't shine half as bright
Ever since you walked away, oh

If we get back together
It'll be like when I met ya
Even better, girl, I bet ya, baby
Let's get back together
Girl, I swear you are the reason
Love is something worth believing
Ooh (when we get together) ooh (it'll be forever)
Ooh (when we get together) ooh
Yeah
If we get back together
It'll be like when I met ya
Even better, girl, I bet ya, baby

Last call at the troubadour
Late night meals after four
Stumbling through my front door, it just don't feel the same
Can't go to our lunch spot, or grab Joe from the coffee shop
Looking down at my phone a lot, but I don't see your name

I reminisce with the stars tonight
And I think of how we knew them all by name
But they don't shine half as bright
Ever since you walked away, oh

If we get back together
It'll be like when I met ya
Even better, girl, I bet ya, baby
Let's get back together
Girl, I swear you are the reason
Love is something worth believing
If we get back together
It'll be like when I met ya
Even better, girl, I bet ya, baby
Let's get back together
Girl, I swear you are the reason
Love is something worth believing
Ooh (when we get together) ooh (it'll be forever)
Ooh (when we get together) ooh

It'll be like when I met ya
Even better, girl, I bet ya, baby
