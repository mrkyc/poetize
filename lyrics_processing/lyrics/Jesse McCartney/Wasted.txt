The phone rings, already know who's calling
But every time it's after two
It ain't you, but the champagne talking
Saying "Baby, when you coming through?"

You like to call me when you're high
End of the party, I'm your guy
Thing is, I do this every night
And I don't wanna come off impatient
But you only call when you're...

You only call when you're wasted
You only call when you're wasted
You only call when you're
You only call when you're wasted
(Wasted, wasted, wasted)

I wait for the day you tell me
You'll see me in the afternoon
Don't get me wrong, I love our late night evenings
But that ain't all I want from you

You like to call me when you're high
End of the party, I'm your guy
Thing is, I do this every night
And I don't wanna come off impatient
But you only call when you're...

You only call when you're wasted
You only call when you're wasted
You only call when you're
You only call when you're wasted
You only call when you're
You only call when you're wasted
(Wasted, wasted, wasted)

You like to call me when your high
And baby, trust me, that's alright
'Cause I will answer every time
But we should be taking this places
And you only call when you're
I don't wanna come off impatient
But you only call when you're
As much as I love when you're naked
You only call when you're
You only call when you're
You only call when you're wasted
You only call when you're wasted
You only call when you're
You only call when you're wasted
You only call when you're
You only call when you're wasted
