I'm drunk
And right now I'm so in love with you
And I don't wanna think too much about what we
Should or shouldn't do
Lay my hands on Heaven and the sun and the moon and the stars
While the devil wants to fuck me in the back of his car

Nothing quite like the feel of something new

Maybe I'm all messed up, maybe I'm all messed up
Maybe I'm all messed up in you, maybe I'm all messed up
Maybe I'm all messed up, maybe I'm all messed up
Maybe I'm all messed up in you, maybe I'm all messed up

This is the only time I really feel alive
This is the only time I really feel alive, ah, ah, ah

I swear
I just found everything I need
The sweat in your eyes, the blood in your veins
Are listening to me
You might also likeWell, I wanna rip it up and swim in it until I drown
My moral standing is lying down

Nothing quite like the feel of something new

Maybe I'm all messed up, maybe I'm all messed up
Maybe I'm all messed up in you, maybe I'm all messed up
Maybe I'm all messed up, maybe I'm all messed up
Maybe I'm all messed up in you, maybe I'm all messed up

(This is the only time I really feel alive
This is the only time I really feel alive)
Oh

Maybe I'm all messed up in you! Oh! Oh, oh-oh!
No! No! Woah-oh-oh-oh!
Oh, oh-oh!

This is the only time I really feel alive
This is the only time I really feel alive
This is the only time I really feel alive
This is the only time I really feel alive, oh
