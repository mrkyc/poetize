Well, you've got me workin' so hard lately
Workin' my hands until they bleed
If I was twice the man I could be
I'd still be half of what you need
Still you lead me and I follow
Anything you ask, you know I'll do
This one act of consecration
Is what I ask of you

(Ringfinger) Promise carved in stone
Deeper than the sea
(Ringfinger) Sever flesh and bone
And offer it to me

Well, you just leave me nailed here
Hanging like Jesus on this cross
I'm just dying for your sins
And aiding to the cause

(Ringfinger) Promise carved in stone
Deeper than the sea
(Ringfinger) Sever flesh and bone
And offer it to me
You might also like
Wrap my eyes in bandages
Confessions I see through
I get everything I want
When I get part of you

(Ringfinger) Promise carved in stone
Is deeper than the sea
(Ringfinger) Sever flesh and bone
And offer it to me!
(Ringfinger) A promise carved in stone
Deeper than the sea
(Ringfinger) Devil's flesh and bone
Do something for me

(Ringfinger)
Aaaaah, c'mon, c'mon!
I'm so tired I can't get to sleep
And the squeaking of the bed is right in time with the song that's repeating in my head
I just want you to know
