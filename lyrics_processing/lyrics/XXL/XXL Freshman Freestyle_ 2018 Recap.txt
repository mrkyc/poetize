XXL, give your bitch the dick and it XXL
Running from the cops, yeah, we running from twelve

But now I'm up, and I'ma stay focused and get the paper
Had to get my money up, rocking with the stainless
Any nigga disrespect, brother, he gon' spank him
And I ain't playing with these niggas, leave a nigga dangerous

Might just have to drop a bomb, Han Solo
Got me bicken back being bool, Quasimodo
All about my paper, got to get my fucking dough, hoe
Always on the fucking go go, you a bitch like Tony Romo

Hold up, shawty, you know that I tweak, ayy
Beams got me geeking, shit, I bit down on my cheek, ayy
Pulled up in that Royce like "Who that there", like, shit, it's weef, ayy
Long way just from trapping out your mommy, shit, I see, ayy

Look at my two-tone Patek
I smash a hoe then forget
I got a fridge on my neck

Ooh, I love to flex

Strong on these bitches, they back on knees
Back in that bitch like, "What's happening?"
Jump in that pussy like trampoline
Made that pussy sound like mac and cheese

They be like, "Ski, you be snappening"
Teach me the ways of the saucin' king, hah

Wreck a roof, any booth, anybody get it too, you ain't invisible
Shootin' at us, metaphysical, put 'em in critical, critical, uh
