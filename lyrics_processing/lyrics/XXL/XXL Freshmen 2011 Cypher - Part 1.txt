Ayy, look, look

Uh, it's YG 400
The flow cold, got these hoes' nose runnin'
The rap game a bakery, I'm getting dough from it
And I shop with it, I got something to show from it
I got this white girl, she like my snow bunny
These niggas jokes in they raps, so funny!
It's Mr. Young Gangsta, these niggas so wanksta
Like, "Don't sleep on us", these niggas better wake up
Candle lit money, nigga, get ya cake up
Bullets like makeup, they switch your face up
I'm like an airplane, girl, you know what's up
Niggas blowing money quick like we blowing blunts
Red Chucks like my bitch lipstick
I'm taking bitches down, like the hit stick
Push in, motherfucker, nigga go hard
These niggas baller blocking, I call 'em bo gaurds

Yeah
Look, ayy

Whatever it is, they're getting it straight
I'm too obsessed, too dedicated, never escape
I ain't scared, I'ma go in, looking like I'm glowing
Running on beats, you stomping your feet if you ever be down to be flowing, now
I got a notion, I'ma put this into motion
Speeding through the present, tryna get there and coast, man
Hope this broke man will be there soon
For now, the music up loud and the beat on smooth
I'm just rhyming, spitting so efficient
Keeping the tradition while seeking to be different
Just dropped K.I.D.S., but I'm a man of many words
I had to do it big, couldn't ever stop the work
And now you heard my verse, so your bubble gon' burst
Yeah, we on third, say what up to the homies on first
If I can, I'ma kick it, rip it just 'cause I love it
Now they hit me, ask me to spit it up out in public
Got time that you wastin' hatin'
When you could focus on your own grind: skatin'
Mad I got fans and they mad I got love
'Cause me and music fit like a glove, so snug
All you angry mo'fuckers go and form a club
'Cause when you come around me, it ain't nothing but love
I got girls giving hugs, people dapping me up
And you in the corner, like, "Oh man, Mac sucks"
It's been a long grind and a little bit of luck
Feeling blessed every day for the way I'm coming up
I can promise you this: I ain't even close to done
Just pray to God that I'm safe when the soldiers come
They hear me, they forgetting if I'm old or young
Got this music on lock, but I open up
All the time, 'cause my bars and my rhymes be my lifestyle
Blowing white clouds, you getting high right now
You might also like
Yeah

It go live from the Apple, slicing the American pie
With dope lyrics, watch me get America high
By your appearance, I can get a glimpse of your vibe
They say you are what you wear, I'm Yves Saint Laurent
Maison Martin Margiella, catch me at the Montreyon, fella
Getting money, that's why you all jealous
This ain't a rap song, this is a rap psalm
Immaculate, so I'ma be the first to cast stone
In kindergarten, I was filling out my tax form
While my other classmates was learning Jimmy Crack Corn
, how could I go broad?
Riding shotgun with Lupe through Chicago hood
Hat tilted to the side like a GD
Bumping a Pac CD, picture me rollin', holla when you see me
This easy, sorta like my ABC's
I'ma take 'em to the Pelham, nigga, one-two-three
Know my name when I spell, it's D-I-two-Gs
Rather die before I'm telling, see, I'm too G, Diggy!

Yeah
Check, Twist
Beatin' up the beat like it's a high school drumline
I got these teachers like "What has he become now?"
A young genius, homie, sumn like an Einstein
Yeah, I'm balling now, we go to Belize and I'll shine
No deportion, split the dough in proportion
Grown man money, these kids partial abortion
Goin' to the mall, they playing around and horsin'
They beefin' while Twizzy up, dropping stacks in Nordstroms
Porky Pig Pull, but that ain't all, folks
Ain't kidding with y'all folks
Sound like a kid but I ain't kidding at all though, so don't mistake me
