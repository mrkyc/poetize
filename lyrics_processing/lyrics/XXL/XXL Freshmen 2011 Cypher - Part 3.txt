Yeah
I stay shiny, mind clear, with the jewels drippin' off 'em
She say I be killin' em, I say get a coffin
Stuntin', I be often, they like "What it cost him?"
Whole team full of green, you would think we Boston
Spalding, ballin', flow be on the faucet
Middle man, shut yo damn mouth, call a boss in
Big money on the table, nigga, why you talkin'?
Black and yellow Maro, murder scene, caution
Tape, scrape, all I get is hate
Chillin' in the mansion, all you see is gate
She say that I'm handsome, she thinking 'bout a date
But I'm just tryna take her home, I'm thinking 'bout a safe
I was just booked, they had me biddin' in the pin house
Couple months later, now I'm sittin in the penthouse
Bitties fuckin' everywhere, you thinkin' it's a pimp house
Engineer lookin' "When that boy gon' pull his pen out?"
No pen, no pad, this shit so sad
Sittin' in the Aston, this shit so fast
This bitch so bad, I treat her so nice
I came so fast, I had to go twice
Rob me, no dice, that'll get your throat sliced
Puffin' on the diesel gettin' higher than the coke price
Homie, you a rat, you a talkin' to them folks type
I'm more like the bull that could get 'em by the bow type
Meek Milly

Young Krizzle, yo, yo
Do you mind if I murder this?
Spit that southern slang over something so conservative
Swingin' lane to lane, candy coated sippin' purple shit, mind frame, I herbal it
Southern MC of my caliber, never heard of it
Verbally, spit that gospel, prophecy in word of it
No obstacle can topple my run, simply hurdle it
Down to get shells over green, this ain't turtle shit
Bolt like Usain, who game to get got
I mastered the Shaolin styles of BIG and 2Pac
Sweet and sour chicken while my partner workin' two woks
Tryna to get that candy paint that's wetter than a dew drop
Down to take a loss, like, give me whatever you got
Scrapin' from the game, I'll be a king, just you watch
Sippin' fine wine with breadsticks and goulash
I'm far, far away from sardines and noodles
You'd ball hard too if all your life you lived frugal
Wishing on a star for J's, but got Pumas
That was passed down to you 'cause your brother outgrew 'em
Yeah, I talk to 'em

Yeah, uh, uh
Live from the BX
It's funny how I walk around with a .45 and a 3X
Big chain get you smoked like I love Lucys
Just me and my Cuban, I love Lucy, huh
Finna age, look Omarion
I'm center stage, more Olajuwon, huh
I'm ridin' on whoever side you on
Black and white, whatever race, relay the message, homie, with my baton
Move pies like Papa John
When we in the ride, be quiet when we pop on
I'm being honest, I got that flame
Like G-Unit, you ain't got no game
All I got is a flow with it
I make your sandwich, no hero, son, you gotta roll with it
Leave in a O.J. when Nicole get it;
It's a murder
Look, I let the .38 and then the deuce beam him
We'll put his face in a box like he uStreaming, huh
Labels, I hear offers
Had Jay-Z going crazy in the office
Clark Kent endorsed it, Lenny S forced it
Beans tried to take me to Bellevue, I lost it, ha
Now rappers should all forfeit
My swag is a ladder, I will never fall off it
Those who can't hear, I appear to flow awkward
Spitting out of this world, chewing on some Orbit
You ain't a boss, so don't walk it or talk it
You better off the bench, more Crawford, I'm nauseous
I don't feel right deaded
Put the M to your head, now you feel light-headed, ha
This Halloween it was sick
Painted myself brown, I'm the shit
