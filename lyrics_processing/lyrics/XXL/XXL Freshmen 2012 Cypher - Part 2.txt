Act like you ain't heard
Know I stay mad fly like Angry Birds
Kid Ink, I'm a beast, dog, heard me?
Pockets on Kirby, tell 'em that it's curtains
Draped up, fronting for my lateness
Spit that raw, no latex, all you niggas safe sex
West side alumni, Batgang what I rep
Shake 'em up and watch 'em disappear like an Etch A Sketch
Yeah, I'm the truth, you the one that she lied to
Probably got your girl taking orders like a drive-thru
Stay so hot, ain't nobody in my eye view
Blunt too fat, need a motherfucking lipo
Yeah, only J's are the ones on my feet
Concrete nigga, I came from the streets
Now, "Mother may I?" "Yes indeed"
Got my weight up, you see the freshman fifteen, woo!

One time, now
I'm from the city of Seattle, never been on that hat troop
Never played the guitar, never gotten tattoo
Unless you were a band or a singer in a flannel
Then the street wasn't listening like the city was soundproof
This is for my outcasts, who live without mass
Thrift shop hustles who make it without cash
That can take a fat woman's fur jacket out the trash
Can and make it look like something Gucci Mane has
My mama said to keep on shining
Stare the crowd in the face, never let 'em close their eyelids
It's just that moment you show them you're alive, bang
Give 'em who you are, why the hell are you hidin'?
So toughen up, sink or swim or knuckle up
I never play to be a runner-up on any team
Nah, it's just that hustle 'cause when labels wanna fuck with us
We've build fan bases and turned fans to family
Now for the world staring at that screen
We direct to video with our heart on our... nah
Fuck it, I'm sleeveless, stitch the cadence, a seamstress
Better re-up and eat that beat, I need that bass like a fiend does
Needle in my arm, plug into the speakers
Heroin don, kick the habit, change dealers
Addict who'd probably buy Louis Vuitton if it was cheaper
But I realize that you can't fill the void with a Visa
I got a chain with a space for Jesus
I haven't been to church in years, "Have you seen him?"
Live for the ideas, record beneath the heavens
'Cause if I don't write my story, then somebody else will tell it

My baby mama told the judge I was a millionaire
Wish somebody told me, I'm still dealing squares
Victory, yeah, the feeling's rare
But the trigger on a blicker thinner than a hair
And yo' girlfriend wetter than a wishing well
But I'd box with a bear before I hit her bare
Me in my kids in the mall tryna Build-a-Bear
And I can't find a Lamborghini Power Wheel anywhere
Hi ho, let's lay
Never mind my name, just know I'm paid
And I gets head, home girl, I'm a fade
So fresh to death, I should bathe in a grave
And so I never spent a day in the cage
I got old school shooters like Ray with the Trey
Fuck a freestyle, I get paid for what I say
Read the story of my life, getting paid's on every page

You know I'm illy, who you kiddin'? Go and tell your friends
I am the chief, and y'all just the Indians
Iggy is a big dog, chillin' in the left lane
But ain't got no leads, you chickens, you ain't free-range
You bitches can't see me, I aim high, honey
Throw stones at your face, never bother with your body
Cut straight to the chase, new age vigilante
You ain't taking shit from me, show my teeth, if you want it
Baby, what you looking at is a fearless heart, hungry
What you smellin' on me is me getting to the money
Going green, flexing on 'em, feeling like Gumby
Everybody on my dick, they wanna ride my pony
On my own dime, don't need no one to sponsor me
Smart bitches know, you ain't never eat a lunch that's free
You gassed up off it, don't know the cost of it
