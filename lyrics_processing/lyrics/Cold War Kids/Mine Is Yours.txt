Woah, woah
You were changin' colors like the leaves in fall
I was savin' up for the long winter
Summers we'd hide out in my car
When it broke down we didn't care
We'd figure out another way to get me there
Mine is yours
What is mine is yours
What is mine is yours
What is mine is yours
A realistic love runs out of room
I try to talk big but my mouth don't move
'Cause I don't own the sun, I don't own the moon
They only come out when they want to
They don't care whether I promised you
They only come out when they want to
They don't care whether I promised
What is mine is yours
What is mine is yours
What is mine is yours
What is mine is yours
You might also likeYou wanna fight about it
You wanna fight about it
You wanna fight about it
Come on, come on
I made you cry about it
I made you cry about it
I made you cry about it
Come on, come on
There was no other way
To let you in here to stay
We had to give it away
Come on, come on
And when we come up for air
And when we come up for air
And when we come up now we know
All my stones become your pearls
All of my trials are your treasures
All my debt you inherit
All of my clumsy lines will shine
'Cause what is mine is yours
What is mine is yours
What is mine is yours
What is mine is yours
What is mine is yours is yours is yours
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
(When I can hear you)
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
(When I can hear you)
Oh, oh, oh
