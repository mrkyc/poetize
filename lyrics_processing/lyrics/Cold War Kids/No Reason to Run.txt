In the mirror I see my face
I've got to let this go
What if all my decisions are fear based?
What if I lose control?
I'm asking for intervention
I've tried to fly solo
It's not a question of whether I will fall
It's how hard I hit the floor

When did I feel it?
How did I know that you were the one?
I am defeated
I got no reason to run, no reason to run

I wanna be part of the movement
Somebody sign me up
Have you ever felt so authentic?
Like you belong in the club
Freedom is overrated
I'm not gonna come undone
I can't lose my motivation
Laying all day in the sun
You might also like
When did I feel it?
How did I know that you were the one?
I am defeated
I got no reason to run, no reason to run

Don't wanna hear your prayers
Don't reminisce on glory days
Fight the tears, yeah, I'm okay
I'm like a cro-magnon walking out of my cave
I have evolved like a fish growing legs
Woke like a lightbulb clicked in my brain
I am changed, yeah, I have changed
I got you
And I'm never gonna be the same

When did I feel it? (When did I feel it?)
How did I know that you were the one?
I am defeated (I am defeated)
I got no reason to run, no reason to run

Stay by my side (No reason to run)
So in love, so alive (No reason to run)
Stay by my side (No reason to run)
So in love, so alive (No reason to run)
Stay by my side (No reason to run)
So in love, so alive (No reason to run)
Stay by my side (I got no reason to run)
