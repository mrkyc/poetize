I've come here nine times asking you, do not make it ten
I'm peelin' off all the armor that protected my skin
Apologize, I'm layin' down my ego to rest
Could you be mine forever, just in case it exists?

I think about the old days
What we've been through to survive
Do we get better with time?
Tell me I'm wrong

Looking back to the start, who we were when we met
This box of pictures tells a story, when we fight, we forget
And I can barely recognize us, back then we were obsessed
Can we cut out this madness and get back to the best?

Think about the old days
What we've been through to survive
Do we get better with time?
Tell me I'm wrong
I'm lookin' to you always
We follow the same guiding light
Passin' like ships in the night
Can we hang on?
Can we hang on?
You might also like
Can we hang on?
Can we hang on?
Can we hang on?

This could've gone either way if one of us had walked
If I'd gone off and you caved in, and we broke it off
I'd be lost, I'd be chasin' some broke down dream, I'd be bored to death
But we cannot stay forever young and out of our heads
Out of our heads

I'll think about tomorrow
If I can get through tonight
I know that we'll be alright
Can we be strong?
I'm lookin' to you always
Even though we're like ships in the night
Don't you go passin' me by
Can we hang on?
Can we hang on?

Can we hang on?
Can we hang on?
Can we hang on?
You can find it, if you're dyin' to live
If you want to know the secret, hang on
You can find it, if you're dyin' to live
If you want to know the secret, hang on
You can find it, if you're dyin' to live
