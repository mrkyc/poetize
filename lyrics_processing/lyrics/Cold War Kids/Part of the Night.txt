We are a part of the night
Part of the night
You've seen me through my darkest times
We are a part of the night
Part of the night
I feel you when I close my eyes

I hate to get all emotional
This separation leaves us vulnerable
I'm so aware of what you must think of me
I used to have so many tricks up my sleeve

Wish I could be the one who's shining, who's always on
But now the fear of day is driving to right my wrongs

We are a part of the night
Part of the night
You've seen me through my darkest times
We are a part of the night
Part of the night
I feel you when I close my eyes
You might also like
I guess you knew what you were getting into
I'm temperamental and a kind of recluse
But we defy any category
We set out, we set out to live two separate dreams

Do your friends say I'm playing the artist card?
But they don't sympathize when it gets too hard

We are a part of the night
Part of the night
You've seen me through my darkest times
We are a part of the night
Part of the night
I feel you when I close my eyes

Careful not to overexpose
Do you remember what we started this for?
The image we made up is bigger than us
(So much bigger)
It was a vision built from the ground up
So it's ours to crush
We are a part of the night
Part of the night
You've seen me through my darkest times
We are a part of the night
Part of the night
You've seen me through my darkest times
We are a part of the night
Part of the night
I feel you when I close my eyes

We are a part of the night
Part of the night, part of the night, part of the night that I need you
Part of the night, part of the night, part of the night that I need you
We are a part of the night
Part of the night, part of the night, part of the night that I need you
