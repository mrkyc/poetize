Yo, now when I first met her all I thought was, "Thong thong-thong"
Like, "Lose the lame, we can get our freakin' on"
Baby know the game, slip away, and slide me yo' number
It's the last day of spring, see you first day this summer
I'm a bad motha, shut yo' mouth, pull the drop out and
Creep at a low speed, 'cause homie probably know me
I push the pedal, thoughts of your stiletto
Way up in the air like I think he's here
'Cause see, every time that I'm alone with you (With you)
Homey be checkin' up on you (On you)
But if that nigga only knew (Only knew)
You've got a lot of freak in you, baby
Well, now it's startin' to rain, I pop the roof and the champagne
How Jay said? "Money Ain't a Thing"
It's been close a few, at times even impossible
But, it's been between me and you, baby

Girl, it's on again, every year, we hummer 'em in
Beaches, houses, hoes, foes, friends
And when the, day ends, that's when it all begins
You wit him? Here's my room key, holla at me
While you thinka-think I'ma hit it up
Then look at the nigga you thinkin' you love? C'mon love
We could go there, me and you, creep off all night
If you love it, in the mornin', awake with new light
If you lookin' like I ain't gonna handle his
Let me handle my biz, it is what it is
Nigga livin' his life, and that's my bitch
You know I got a wife, let's keep this thing tight, baby

If they, knew we were doin' what we were doin' it'd probably ruin
Our creep away summer in Cancunin' and I, love
The way we get away, throw away a whole day
Turn off the pagers and phones, we in the zone like
"Fuck life, we live life
This is our life, live your life"
