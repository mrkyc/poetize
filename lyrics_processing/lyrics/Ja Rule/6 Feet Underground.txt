I'm so ignorant 'cause I done played my last tears
And pain is bliss been through so many things
It's hard to resist a mind that's currently
Thinking on his last wish it's nothing to fuck with
When I know what I want because you must think I'm a fool
Claiming you love what I do and be out playing the Rule
Bad move, more cars, more hoes, more jewels, and I'd love
