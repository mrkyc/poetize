Whatever it is that's what is gon' be nigga
Hussein Fatal, the outlaw don, Blood In My Eyes
Yeah, Triple O stand up, got your mind's back right
Jerse's mobbin' these cowards all the time
You know gunnin' 'em down
Everything like that
Smooth stayin' forty below on these cowards
Early nigga
Outlaw status alone got these niggas on freeze
Get down or lay down
Draw heat and protect your self, Rule holla at yo' peoples nigga
From now on call me the don, and bitches call me don da da
Wherever I go niggas soon to follow
Like when I dropped my first joint makin' the world holla
I kept it Between Me And You
Cause that's what real street niggas do
Put It On Me, cause even thugs get lonely
Sometimes I Cry, for niggas I'ma baptize
When will they realize I Live It Up
Cop the coke sell it and re' it up, I'm Always On Time
Keep the bitches Mesmerized from the Thug Lovin'
Load the clip, cock back the nine, open mouth shove it
Down the throat, look in his eyes and squeeze like fuck it
And they think my niggas do this shit for nothin'
Where my wild lil duggins, lookin' to get a come up
Come on in and catch the angel that's all in
Call me Lord when it's my time, and I'll arrive
With blood in my eyes
See Ja Rule LiveGet tickets as low as $180You might also like
That's what real niggas do you know
We hold it down for each other
We don't waste time we get it done, why not, why wouldn't we, you know
That's what goes down you know
You draw yours, I draw mine, whoever get the drop that's what it is
We live by those laws, why wouldn't we?
The object (Yo) is to get it done
Let's go
It's nothin'

Fuck the world and the bigger pussies that run it
Rule for prez cause I'm one of the best that done it
On the M-I, these niggas spittin' semi, to get by
But never really get right, livin' up off the hid-ype
DMX was my dog, but now we just dog fight
He suckin' on glass dicks callin' 'em crack pipes
And I'm hearin' you lettin' your health slide these days
And your latest bid, looked like you contracted the AIDS
Who the fuck you callin' gay nigga?
Must've been talkin' to Em and Dre, nigga
Pour out a lil liquor, and rest in peace 2Pac Shakur
'Cause you let us know that Dre was a queer before
And Marshall how dare you use his name in vain
Son of a panther, you'll never understand his pain
But you do understand trailer parks and cocaine
Disrespectin' your mother what fuckin' part of the game
Is that, man? I guess this world needs change
So we got it, and now I gotta put 'em in the grave
Red dot 'em, before they put us in a cage
Rule and Gotti, America's most wanted to many
Come and get meeeeeeeee!!!
