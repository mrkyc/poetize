Better not violate the camp, get shot down by chance
I'm real advanced with that cock and blast
'Cause the feds want us bad for cleanin' cash
But what cashes we cleansin', it's all about the Benjamins, what
If it's dirty then we rinsin' it off
Real niggas don't give a fuck, mobbed up in H2s
Niggas is talkin' shit, aw bitch, that's old news

We put that bang, bang, bang to use nigga
Cause Rule's the truth nigga, for show
Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-uh-uh-oh

Niggas wanna ball, but can't on the West Coast
Dre Day's been dead a long time ago
Respect the Inc., Row, Rap-A-Lot collabo
Just know y'all niggas ain't safe on the globe
And while the world probes, IRS versus I.N.C

Now before they start runnin' they lips
I just thought I should warn these motherfuckers, there's a gun in this bitch
And I know he's got one on his hip
But I got the drop, and outside, Rule got the drops
All it takes is a cock and a pop
Money for bail, ain't seein' no more sale
Instead, I'm poppin' on yachts
They told me J. Prince runnin' the south
And I'm beast from the east, that'll come and put a gun in your mouth
I got bricks for days, dick to make a bitch behave
Had to baldhead my shit threw, switch the waves
Just that quick, slip and the mac spit, bladdat
Hit four of 'em up in they chest, reload while they back flip
We in this together, bad weather, rippin' the storm
They some dictionary rappers, they just spittin' the norm
You 'posed to know the La Costra Nostra flow
I did it, cause I lived it, you can quote the flow
Hit your six up with sixteen in sixty seconds
Get your whips up, we split beams, keep fifty weapons
To you coppers that's a posin' a threat
Fire up the air holes in the tech
To put a hole in your neck
See I rep for the four forty but I'm 'bout the five
Ride by, blazin' out the five, nigga I'm so cool
Bitches say, Hizzy, you remind me of the old school
In the club posted, snatchin' hoes with no jewels
