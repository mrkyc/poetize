See Ja Rule LiveGet tickets as low as $180You might also like
Fuck what they hollerin' about Rule, nigga, here's the real
I'll pop ya top like champagne bottles to chill
With nuttin' but ice, now I'll send it up to the greatest
To tell 'em I'm nice too, plus push some nice coupes
The Inc. roll like deuce, man, I'm OG Bobby J
And we slingin' soccer fields of yay
They don't respect that, or get ya mind around and
Get it pushed back, y'all don't want that
I send 'em to the morgue while keepin' my bitches bouncin' for sure
In the club wit no gun, got 'em takin' it off
Can't help that, I'm the nigga that puts it down
Once I hit that, that's it, I'm up in the mind, maxin' them
Holdin' the throwback, West, 44, Lakers
Let's make no mistakes when these F's take place
What's the procedure wit a gun in your face when you got one in your waist?
Let's cock back, nigga, air out the space (Come on), we gon'

Who be in the cub, Rule muhfucker poppin' the bubbly
When shit get ugly, I hug the snub closely,
But usually used to see your bitches
Dancin' on some freak shit, tryna ride my dick
I can handle it long as they manage
To get they ass in front of my dick and dance to Big's One More Chance
I'm catchin' hate from a glance, but I'm a giant
These niggas is mere ants, I'll stomp out 'em wit a shank
Give bitches the back hand, this pimp shit, is not realistic
The game is helpless, let's not get it twisted
I'm young, black, and gifted, but still at the bottom
And stuck somewhere between Gomorrah and Sodom
I'm here to make this rap shit hotter than Harlem
Fuck the dog, beware of Rule 'cause I'm the problem,
What's the procedure wit a gun in your face when you got one in your waist?
Let's cock back, nigga, air out the space (Come on), we gon'

Let's take 'em to war, nigga, like Bush and Saddam, I'ma find out where Em Laden's hidin' and bomb first
It could be much worse, I could be hotter than your scrubs
Mask and gloves, gun hot to burn that ass up
I'd rather be bossed up wit a bunch of broads
The preacher's daughter screamin' out, "Fuck the Lord!"
I may have struck a chord with the Christians
But y'all got the freakiest bitches out of all the religions
And God gave me his blessin' to handle my business
On these wanksta, snitches, let the nina blow kisses
If she some how misses, he gon' meet the mistress
And clap that boy like Birdman and Clipse
I got these niggas all over my dick like hoes
I'm the star a the shows, I must be as hot as they come
What's the procedure with a gun in your face when you got one in your waist?
Let's cock back, nigga, air out the space (C'mon), we gon'

Clap back, we gon' clap back
We gon' clap back, we gon' clap back (Let's take 'em to war, niggas)
