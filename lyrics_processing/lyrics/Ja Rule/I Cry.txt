Said we cry (cry)
Cry (cry)
Cry (cry)
We cry together, oh, oh

When I cry, you cry, we cry together
I said I cry, you cry, we cry together
I said I cry, you cry, we cry together
I said I cry, you cry, we cry together

I love my life, I love my wife but bad times'll prevail, and overwhelm me
I'm livin' in hell but livin' wealthy
And know these hoes love me because I'm a star
I can't even cop a drink at the bar
Get me some bottles of that Remi Martin, let's get the party
Crackin' right here, fuck V.I.P
Knowin' my baby loves me, home with tears in her eyes
And when I get in, I hurt her more by tellin' her lies
She ain't surprised at me, she just surprised that we
Been together for this long and I can be
The one to mistreat her, thought it'd last forever
'Cause if I cry, you cry, ('cause when) we cry together

From what I recall, we was little niggas
Cut school, gettin' high with the hottest bitches (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Livin' life so free, that we (yeay, yeah) ain't fearin' the
Ills of the world and the heat of drug dealin'
You and I then made a killin', and stuck together (you and I)
In this land of forbidden treasure
Love is the only evil seed that could sever a tie this close
Not the love between us, but your love for the dough
You went O.T., started makin' M-O-N-E, why
All my good niggas gotta die?
Wish it could last forever, I wish death was pleasure
'Cause when you died, I cried, ('cause when I cry) we cried together
When I cry
You cry (you cry)
We cry together (we cry)
Said I cry (I cry)
You cry (you cry)
We cry together (we cry)
Said I cry
You cry (baby)
We cry together
Said I cry ('cause when I cry)
You cry
We cry together

Wash away your tears, my love (away my tears)
You ain't got to cry no more, my love (nooooooh, more)
I put it on everything that, I love, that (hmmmm, baby)
My pain is, my love, and, (pain is love) I want

This world to smile for me (smile)
Don't shed a tear, 'cause a nigga died happily (yes he did)
My mama warned me life was a motherfucker
But I ignored the warning and kept on hustlin'
And every night she just looked at me, tears in her eyes
And they be saying shit like, "I don't want me baby to die"
Brought so much pain to her life, gotta make it better
'Cause when ma cried, I cried, ('cause when I cry) we cried together
When I cry
You cry (you cry)
We cry (and we cry) together (yeay, yeah)
Said I cry
You cry
We cry (together) together
Said I cry
You cry (you cry)
We cry together (we cry, yeah)
Said I cry
You cry
We cry together

Ooh

When I cry, then you cry, then we'll cry together
Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah, baby
'Cause when Ja cries, Mo cries, we'll cry together
If he cry, then I'll cry, then we'll cry together, yeah

Mmmmmm, oh, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah
