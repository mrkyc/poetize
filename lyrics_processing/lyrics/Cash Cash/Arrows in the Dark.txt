Maybe I'm a fool to let you go
They say yes, but I say no
Maybe you could tame my wicked heart
I keep shooting arrows in the dark

Je ne t'aime pas
No, je ne t'aime pas
Je ne t'aime pas
No, je ne t'aime pas

I like the way you talk to me, I like the way you smile
I like the way you open doors and go the extra mile
I love the way you kiss me, I love the way you rage
I love the way you let loose like a tiger in a cage

Mother says you're an angel, my father says you're the one
The apple of their eye, the prodigal son
All my friends wanna fuck you, every boy and every girl
But I could never love you for all the money in the world

Je ne t'aime pas
Maybe I'm a fool to let you go
They say yes, but I say no
Maybe you could tame my wicked heart
I keep shooting arrows in the dark
You might also like
Je ne t'aime pas
No, je ne t'aime pas
Je ne t'aime pas
No, je ne t'aime pas

I love the way you treat me, you always pay for food
And you don't really mind it when I tell you what to do
Got the body of a god, temper of a lamb
Hot like an ocean, but I'm playing in the sand

You're perfect on paper, but I don't like to read
I should really want you, but you're not what I need
All my friends wanna fuck you, every boy and every girl
But I could never love you for all the money in the world

Maybe I'm a fool to let you go
They say yes, but I say no
Maybe you could tame my wicked heart
I keep shooting arrows in the dark
I keep shooting arrows in the dark

Je ne t'aime pas
No, je ne t'aime pas
Je ne t'aime pas
Maybe I'm a fool to let you go
They say yes, but I say no
Maybe you could tame my wicked heart
I keep shooting arrows in the dark

Je ne t'aime pas
No, je ne t'aime pas
I keep shooting arrows in the dark
Je ne t'aime pas
No, je ne t'aime pas
I keep shooting arrows in the dark
