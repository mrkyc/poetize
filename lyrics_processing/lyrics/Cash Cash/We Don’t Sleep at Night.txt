Turning you on when the lights go off, o-o-o-o-off
Turning you on when the lights go off, Cash Cash
Turning you on when the lights go off, o-o-o-o-off
Turning you on when the lights go off, o-o-o-o-off

When the sun goes down, all our sins collide
When the moon comes out, I'm a devil inside
Gonna go all night, 'cause you know we arrange it right
We don't sleep at night
We don't sleep at night
We don't sleep at night

In the land of milk and honey
We spendin' all our parent's money
Don't give a fuck about tomorrow
We only care about tonight

When the sun goes down, all our sins collide
When the moon comes out, I'm a devil inside
Gonna go all night, 'cause you know we arrange it right
We don't sleep at night
You might also likeWe don't sleep at night
We don't sleep at night
Poppin' pills
For the thrills
We don't sleep at night

Turning you on when the lights go off, o-o-o-o-off
Turning you on when the lights go off
We don't sleep at night
You make me hungry like the wolves
'Cause I'm a creature of the night

We don't sleep at night
We don't sleep at night

Doctor says I got a problem
'Cause I think sleep is for the weak
I wanna bite him like a vampire
'Cause I'm a kinky little freak
When the sun goes down, all our sins collide
When the moon comes out, I'm a devil inside
Gonna go all night, 'cause you know we arrange it right
We don't sleep at night
We don't sleep at night
Poppin' pills
For the thrills
We don't sleep at night

Turning you on when the lights go off, o-o-o-o-off
Turning you on when the lights go off
We don't sleep at night
Turning you on when the lights go off
