There's a party in your bedroom all night long
There's a party in your bedroom all night long
There's a lot of talk about you
Cause there's a party in your bedroom all night long
Pretty girl, it's a show
Let it go when you're alone

There's a party in your bedroom all night long
There's a lot of talk about you
Cause there's a party in your bedroom all night long
Pretty girl, it's your show
Let it go when you're alone
Lips sealed tight
Don't say goodnight

Walking down the street
Keepin' hush hush on the scene
No one knows you, such a mystery
Opposite of fun 'til you turn the power on
Then you come out turning up the heat

Upstairs all alone
One click for a show
Your roof is on fire
You're losing control
You might also like
There's a party in your bedroom all night long
There's a lot of talk about you
Cause there's a party in your bedroom all night long
Pretty girl, it's your show
Let it go when you're alone
Lips sealed tight
Don't say goodnight

Dancing with your hands
Turning strangers into friends
Touch the keys, please, and unlock my heart
You're free to be a freak
Change your picture every week
Show the camera you're a super star

Upstairs all alone
One click for a show
Your roof is on fire
You're losing control

There's a party in your bedroom all night long
There's a lot of talk about you
Cause there's a party in your bedroom all night long
Pretty girl, it's your show
Let it go when you're alone
There's a party in your bedroom all night long
There's a lot of talk about you
Cause there's a party in your bedroom all night long
Pretty girl, it's your show
Let it go when you're alone
Lips sealed tight
Don't say goodnight
It's no debate
When I think of you
Can't stay on track
Cause I can't wait
Can't stay on track
Can't hide the fact
You're all I want, you're all I need
Let's get this party started
Kick it hard
Just you and me

There's a party in your bedroom all night long
There's a lot of talk about you
Cause there's a party in your bedroom all night long
Pretty girl, it's your show
Let it go when you're alone
There's a party in your bedroom all night long
There's a lot of talk about you
Cause there's a party in your bedroom all night long
Pretty girl, it's your show
Let it go when you're alone
Lips sealed tight
