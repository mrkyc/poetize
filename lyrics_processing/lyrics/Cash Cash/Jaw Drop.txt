Last night at the party
I was looking for somebody who I could take home
Was cool cool made a move
I was think maybe you could lose
Lose all control
Now you're all over me
One thousand degrees
And I can barely breath

She makes my jaw drop
In her low rise jeans
She makes my heart stop
Talking dirty to me
You know it don't stop
When we're under the sheets
She makes my jaw drop
She makes me jaw drop
If you know what I mean
She makes my heart stop
Talking dirty to me
You know it don't stop
Like a loving machine
She makes my jaw drop
You might also like
She's down right getting naughty
Moving like she ain't nobody's girl
Just dancing alone
So let's dance dance
No romance
Tear it up
And the we could do it right
We'll go all night
With your hands touching me
One thousand degrees
And I can barely breath

She makes my jaw drop
In her low rise jeans
She makes my heart stop
Talking dirty to me
You know it don't stop
When we're under the sheets
She makes my jaw drop
She makes me jaw drop
If you know what I mean
She makes my heart stop
Talking dirty to me
You know it don't stop
Like a loving machine
She makes my jaw drop
You're crazy girl
Who taught you how to get down like that?
Damn

Tight jeans
Beauty queen
If any y'all touch her
I'm a make a scene
She's leaving with me
I got no doubt she wants it know
Kiss her like there ain't no one around
It's time to get down

She makes my jaw drop
In her low rise jeans
She makes my heart stop
Talking dirty to me
You know it don't stop
When we're under the sheets
She makes my jaw drop
She makes me jaw drop
If you know what I mean
She makes my heart stop
Talking dirty to me
You know it don't stop
Like a loving machine
