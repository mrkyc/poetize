And now we're singing
OOh
I still got it, I still got it
OOh
Yeah, I still got
Still got that pop lock n', panty droppin'
Smooth moves in my pocket
Still got that look that get some hook like a locket
Off like a rocket
Been down like Kenny Powers
Now I'm up like the Trump Towers
And I'm back in town, ain't backin' down
Won't stop till I get that crown
OOh
I still got it, I still got it
OOh
I still got it
Still got that fire burnin' hot like never before
Still got my heart beatin' loud like yours on the floor
My bottles poppin', fist pumpin' and I'm ready for more
That's right
I still got it, I still got it, I still got it
Still got that tiger blood pumpin' fast through my veins
Mixed with zannies, stripper whammies
I ain't feelin' no pain
This bottles up
Swingin' hard cause I'm still in the game
Uhuh
I still got it, I still got it, I still got it
Still got these zebra pants back from 08'
We all laughed and I took the hate
Before the world was party rockin'
Neon poppin' and beat shoppin'
We're the ones that cook the beats up
And that's right we milf huntin'
Sorry for milf' huntin'
Yeah, I remember way back when
Long nights on the road in the back of the van
We had mommas in the back of the van
Cheatin' on hubbies in a one night stand
Sorry dad
Different cities, different bitties, always singin'
There's a party in your bedroom all night long
Keep it going now
OOh
I still got it, I still got it
OOh
I still got it
Still got that fire burnin' hot like never before
Still got my heart beatin' loud like yours on the floor
My bottles poppin', fist pumpin' and I'm ready for more
That's right
I still got it, I still got it, I still got it
Still got that tiger blood pumpin' fast through my veins
Mixed with zannies, stripper whammies
I ain't feelin' no pain
This bottles up
Swingin' hard cause I'm still in the game
Uhuh
I still got it, I still got it, I still got it
Now look, I never had no top 10
But I got this silver Benz
Run around like I own the town
You can honk the horn if you see me around
Cash Cash up in the bank
Got gas up in my tank
Imma buy you a drink
Then take you home out to your kitchen sink
OOh
We're back baby
OOh
I still got it, I still got it
OOh
I still got it, I still got it
I still got it
Still got that fire burnin' hot like never before
Still got my heart beatin' loud like yours on the floor
My bottles poppin', fist pumpin' and I'm ready for more
That's right
I still got it, I still got it, I still got it
Still got that tiger blood pumpin' fast through my veins
Mixed with zannies, stripper whammies
I ain't feelin' no pain
This bottles up
Swingin' hard cause I'm still in the game
Uhuh
I still got it, I still got it, I still got it
