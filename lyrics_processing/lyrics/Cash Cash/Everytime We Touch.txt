I still feel your touch in my dreams.(my dreams)
Forgive me my weakness, but I don't know why
Without you it's hard to survive
'Cause everytime we touch, I get this feeling
And everytime we kiss I swear I could fly
Can't you feel my heart beat fast, I want this to last
Need you by my side
'Cause everytime we touch
Yeah, yeah Mc oz
Yea Cash Cash
Yeah, uh what
'Cause everytime we touch
You light me up like Los angeles
Girl, the Hollywood lights can't handle this
Hold on, tell my momma this chick is my future miss
I never knew a chick like this before
And momma I can't ignore
It doesn't take a genius to feel it this time
But if it does, you can call me Einstein
After feeling this much, I'm down for a game of two hand touch
What you feel it two? I feel it three
Four on the floor, who's next, me?
That's right a round of applause
Mc oz, came with a cause, but it's never enough
Everytime we touch

Can't you hear my heart beat slow
I can't let you go
Want you in my life
