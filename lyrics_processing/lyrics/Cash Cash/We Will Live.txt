Why you so worried 'bout me?
What I eat, who I fuck, where I wanna sleep
We're not a plague or disease
For you to cure or purify as you please

Can't fight those who feel
You can't fight who you are
No, you can't hide from the nightmare
In someone else's heart

We will live, we will love
We will never have to change for anyone
We are here, we are free
We will live as we were made to be

We are here, we are free
We will live as we were made to be

We will live as we were made to be
We will live as we were made to be
You might also like
You can't control what I think
What I mean, the chemicals inside of me
And if in God, you believe
Let us live, let us live as we were made to be

Can't fight those who feel
You can't fight who you are
No, you can't hide from the nightmare
In someone else's heart

We will live, we will love
We will never have to change for anyone
We are here, we are free
We will live as we were made to be
And will it take a thousand years
Oh, to bury all your fears
We are here, we are free
We will live as we were made to be

We are here, we are free
We will live as we were made to be
We will live as we were made to be
And will it take a thousand years
Oh, to bury all your fears
We are here, we are free
We will live as we were made to be

We will live, we will love
We will never have to change for anyone
We are here, we are free
