I'm just victim trying to set myself free
But it's so hard to see you ain't right for me
My friends all hate you, but I still disagree
The way you dance on me, it makes it hard to see it
Is me loving you such a crime?
You keep my blood rushing all of the time

I'm going out of my mind
I'm a victim of love
Got me tied up in knots
Someone please call the cops
I said I can't walk away
'Cause I can't get enough
I'm just a tied down, bruised up, victim of love
I'm going out of my mind
'Cause I can't shake your love
My heart got lost in your sheets
Bumping hard to the beat
I said I can't walk away
'Cause I can't get enough
I'm just a tied down, bruised up, victim of love

You always kick me when I'm down on my knees
'Cause girl you're cold as ice
Should've took my mom's advice
My friends all tell me you've been cheating on me
But it's so hard to see, you're no good for me
Is me loving you such a crime?
You keep my blood rushing all of the time

Got me tied up in knots
Someone please call the cops

'Cause I can't get enough
I'm just a tied down, bruised up, victim of love
I'm going out of my mind
'Cause I can't shake your love
My heart got lost in your sheets
Bumping hard to the beat
I said I can't walk away
'Cause I can't get enough
I'm just a tied down, bruised up, victim of love

I can't believe I've been wasting my time
I think the sex must have made me go blind

Come on, come on, come on
I can't shake this
Come on, come on, come on
A little help now
Come on, come on, come on
A victim of love
I'm going out of my mind
I'm a victim of love
Got me tied up in knots
Someone please call the cops

Victim of love, of your love
Yeah, I just can't walk away
'Cause I can't get enough
I'm just a tied down, bruised up, victim of love
