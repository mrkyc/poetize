Finally, we can relate
Now we're side by side, this is fate
I knew all along we'd find some way to communicate
(Communicate!)

I've been here before, and I know that
We must stand up tall
I'm not scared to ask when I'm not sure
We can overcome it all

Speaking from nowhere else except your heart
You'll never know if you don't try
Listen and see the voice I carry with me
"Speak with your heart! Speak with your heart!"

If you could tell me how to lend a hand
I would try to understand
No words could say how much I care
Together we can take a stand

Don't fall apart
Speak with your heart
And always take it with you back to the start!

We can break this wall that divides us
I know you're sincere
We'll just take our time in this moment
Your voice will come clear

Speaking from nowhere else except your heart
You'll never know if you don't try
Listen and see the voice I carry with me
"Speak with your heart! Speak with your heart!"

If you could tell me how to lend a hand
I would try to understand
No words could say how much I care
Together we can take a stand
Tell me how to lend a hand
I would try to understand
No words could say how much I care
Together we can take a stand

Don't fall apart
Speak with your heart
And always take it with you back to the start!
Don't fall apart
Speak with your heart
And always take it with you back to the start!
The anthem of this victory
Will light the way to the end
And I know that if we communicate
Peace be ours 'til the end!

Don't fall apart
Speak with your heart
And always take it with you back to the start
Don't fall apart (Just take it from the start)
Speak with your heart (Come on and speak with your heart)
Your heart, with your heart
Speak with your heart!

Don't fall apart
Speak with your heart
And always take it with you back to the start!
Don't fall apart
Speak with your heart
Your heart, with your heart
Speak with your heart!

Don't fall apart
Speak with your heart
And always take it with you back to the start!
Don't fall apart
Speak with your heart
And always take it with you back to the start!
