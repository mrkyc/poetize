Oh my god, Becky
Did you hear who's coming to town tonight? (Who? Nick?)
Oh, no no no no
Not Nick, Johnny (Yeah girl!)

I've got my list and I'm checking it twice
So, tell me, girl
Are you naughty or nice?

We got the girl (Check!)
This party's high (Check!)
The drinks are flowin' (Check!)
Yo, we 'bout to get wrecked!
I'm dancing like the matrix
Not like these other fake chicks
You know I'm 20/20
All the other girls are basic

Tonight's getting hot
Got your body on lock
Woah-oh, here we go
Time to put on a show
Come on, girl, let me know
Am I taking you home?
Are you naughty or nice?
You might also like
I've got my list and I'm checking it twice
So, tell me, girl
Are you naughty or nice?
Tonight's the night
I ain't rolling the dice
Are you naughty or nice, naughty or nice?

This girl's a freak (Check!)
She's on the floor (Check!)
I make it move (Check!)
Yo, I got this, no sweat
I'm dirty like the south
Doin' dirty on the couch
Just leave some milk and cookies
And I'll put them in your mouth

Tonight's getting hot
Got your body on lock
Woah-oh, here we go
Time to put on a show
Come on, girl, let me know
Am I taking you home?
Are you naughty or nice?
I've got my list and I'm checking it twice
So, tell me, girl
Are you naughty or nice?
Tonight's the night
I ain't rolling the dice
Are you naughty or nice, naughty or nice?
I've got my list and I'm checking it twice (Checkin' it twice!)
So, tell me, girl
Are you naughty or nice? (Naughty or nice?)
Tonight's the night
I ain't rolling the dice
Are you naughty or nice, naughty or nice?

Tonight's getting hot
Got your body on lock
Got the key, baby
Come with me tonight
Baby boy, be my toy
But, I'll cut off the strings
Gettin' hot, don't you let it stop tonight
Don't you let it stop, boy

I've got my list and I'm checking it twice (Checkin' it twice!)
So, tell me, girl
Are you naughty or nice? (Naughty or nice?)
Tonight's the night
I ain't rolling the dice
Are you naughty or nice, naughty or nice?
I've got my list and I'm checking it twice (Checkin' it twice!)
So, tell me, girl
Are you naughty or nice? (Naughty or nice?)
Tonight's the night
I ain't rolling the dice
Are you naughty or nice, naughty or nice?
