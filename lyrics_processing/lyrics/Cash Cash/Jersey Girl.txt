So be my Jersey girl
I know that you're a Jersey girl inside

4am at a diner stop
Singing "Livin' on a Prayer"
I'm thinking maybe you're a Jersey girl
With all those highlights in your hair
No other girl can move like you
We pump our fist, damn right, it's true
And I don't care what they might say
They'll never get us anyway

So be my Jersey girl (Jersey girl)
And take a little ride with me tonight
And let's get dirty, girl (dirty, girl)
I know that you're a Jersey girl inside
The way you turn it up
Turn me on
And then you take it off
Make it hot, make it loud
We'll wake the whole town
Jersey girl (Jersey girl)
I know that you're a Jersey girl inside
You might also like
Throwing money on those boardwalk games
Having the time of our lives
Remember when I fought that hot head guy for ya?
You know how we roll
Nobody talks the way we do
The way we curse, damn right, it's true
And I don't care what they might say
They'll never get us anyways

So be my Jersey girl (Jersey girl)
And take a little ride with me tonight
And let's get dirty, girl (dirty, girl)
I know that you're a Jersey girl inside
The way you turn it up
Turn me on
And then you take it off
Make it hot, make it loud
We'll wake the whole town
Jersey girl (Jersey girl)
I know that you're a Jersey girl inside

Uh, yeah
Listen up!
Let me tell you about a girl from Jersey
She was looking so fine, with the hips so curvy
I want her over down in seaside heights
And a boardwalk flight at the end of the night
Hold up, we got a situation
Got condensation for the girl's gyration
She's hot, like the girl next door
With the tig ol' bitties
That I can't ignore
I could fall in love with you
I'd be your boss, you'd be my muse
And when we roll to NYC
We're reppin' dirty Jersey

So be my Jersey girl (Jersey girl)
And take a little ride with me tonight
And let's get dirty, girl (dirty, girl)
I know that you're a Jersey girl inside
The way you turn it up
Turn me on
And then you take it off
Make it hot, make it loud
We'll wake the whole town
Jersey girl (Jersey girl)
I know that you're a Jersey girl inside

Now don't forget
We've got Brucey, Bon Jovi
Ha, bring it in and we'll get nice and cozy
Seaside to Montclair
Everybody wanna stop and stare
Jersey girl
Getting down and dirty girl, yeah
I know that you're Jersey girl inside
