I'm feeling all this pressure and I'm trying to breathe
It's in the way you touch me, how you're making me weak
Knocking down my walls, you cut me down and so deep
So deep (So deep, so deep, so deep)
Yeah, I'm caught up in confusion, you're too blurry to see
'Cause this manic situation's getting harder to read
The waves are crashing over, but I'm crashing right in
Yeah, I'm in (I'm in, I'm in, I'm in)

Drowning in your ocean
Swimming in emotion

You're making me sweat
And I'm over my head
You're making me sweat
Oh, swimming in emotion

You're making me sweat
You're making me sweat

We could do whatever, I don't even care where
Minutes turn to hours, got me gasping for air
Always dreamed of this, but now you're taking me there
Yeah, we're there (We're there, we're there, we're there)
I could stay right here forever, feeling reckless and free
As long as we're together, I got all that I need
The tides are rolling over, but we're rolling right in
Yeah, I'm in (I'm in, I'm in, I'm in)

Drowning in your ocean
Swimming in emotion

You're making me sweat (You're making me sweat)
And I'm over my head (I'm over my head)
You're making me sweat (Yeah, you're making me sweat)
Swimming in emotion

You're making me sweat
You're making me sweat
You're making me sweat
Drowning in your ocean
Swimming in emotion

You're making me sweat
And I'm over my head
You're making me sweat (Yeah, you're making me sweat)
Swimming in emotion
You're making me sweat (You're making me sweat)
And I'm over my head (I'm over my head)
You're making me sweat (Yeah, you're making me sweat)
Swimming in emotion
You're making me sweat
Oh, you're making me sweat
Yeah, you're making me sweat
Oh, swimming in emotion
You're making me sweat
