Cause we did not have a fall, we had a spring
We did not have a fall there wasn't a fall anywhere
And your quite scares me a little, as if your f***in'
Your like the rest of the country n**ody noticed it
It was f***in' warmer, it was the warmest fall ever
And that.. theres no such thing as a warm fall its a spring, so thats bullshit the leaves didn't even change colour, they just got so hot and tired they fell off the trees. and i was the only one who cared to even write about it I was goin 'This is f***ed. Its 75 at the end of November, by the middle of December its goin be 130. people come home from work the sun a foot from their g****** heads sweatin' like pigs going to get something from the refrigarator to get something to drink, and the eggs are DONE.' n**ody worried about the weather, people were worried cause it was after september 11, people were worried about anthrax. 4 people died,4,FOUR! And the whole g****** country went sonava b****, everybody went nuts. I've never seen any.. I was in Rala, Missouri, because my life is a rich full f***ing waster, cause apparently if you say come perform i'm like a dancin' monkey. And a, So i went to Rala, and if you're ever thinkin of killin yourself that's the town. Don't kill yourself here its a nice place there's a lot of distractions you won't even get around to it but if you were really contimplating it there's the place there'll be no distractions you'll just get there and go 'f***. phew!' It'll be no problem for you. But the good people of Rala, Missouri were worried about getting anthrax and i said "What the f***.. what you nuts, you gonna get it in a K-mart catalog a** hole even the Taliban isn't iterested in you, you idiot look where you live you're already dead. But they were worried about anthrax, people worried bout smallpox. I don't worry bout smallpox i got a vacine i got a scar to prove it, cause back then they didn't have the proper equipment they used a c**e cap and they scratched me. so if i get smallpox i'm gonna sue whoever it is that you f***in' sue when you get smallpox. but i am cause they took me out of class to get that vacine and if i wouldn't been in that class i wouldn't be doin this bullshit. that's where things went wrong i got offtrack. People were worried about smallpox and anthrax meenwhile we hadn't had a spring, a ligitamte spring in 50 f***in' years. and now it was fall b-b-but it was spring and i kept screeming at people look at the calander we're going backwards, we're going f***ing backwards! I was afraid it might be environmental terrorism, some afgani in one of those mountains back there in a cave with aluminum foil on his head, got ahold of a bunch of black and white TV's and he was f***in with us. If it's not environmental terrorism then its a... it coulda been a... well its obviously global warming. that's what it is and we're not gonna deal with that either. 135 nations signed the global warming treaty, we didn't, we didn't we wonder why the world thinks we're arogant haha
