So I'ma gonn' work work work every day
I got mouths I gotta feed
So I'ma gonn' make sure everybody eats
I got Bills!!
All these bills pile up my desk
They looking like a mount
All the little kids run around
I can hear their stomach growl
Touching for a moon out
And my girl just don't know how
Said she gonna leave me if I don't home with 50 thousand
$50? God damn, god damn, god damn, god damn
Oh man, oh man, oh man, oh man
God damn, oh man, god damn, oh man
I got Bills I gotta pay
So I'm gonn' work, work, work every day
I got mouths I gotta feed
So I'm gonn' make sure everybody eats
I got Bills
Woke up and I bumped my head
Stumped my toe on the edge of the bed
Opened the fridge and the food all gone
Leaving everybody, crap them along
Hopped in the car and the car won't start
It's too damn hot but I still gotta walk
My honey old lady and of course will not
Praying that my card won't get declined
God damn, god damn, god damn, god damn
Oh man, oh man, oh man, oh man
God damn, oh man, god damn, oh man
