If I was you I'd be dying to be
A reflection of the person that you're seeing in me
Like I was born on the moon, but I'm conceived by the sea
And I won't concede 'em 'till I'm achieving my dreams
So I'm flyin' home, home, home, home
And if you hear me I'm gone, gone, gone, gone

Look, If I was you I'd be down a lot
That's why I be so angry
Painfully I failed a lot in hopes to feed my family
Insanely we had to came to be products of our economy
Usually chasing paper, but normally paper ran from me
I'm hungry. My hunger be main thing that's driving me
That pain deep inside of me had me reacting violently
And solemnly I swear that I
I'ma go in 'till the day that I die
Get it in with the pen and pad no lie
Or be back on the block with the tan and the white
I, I, I said it I did it
Moms needs bread I'ma get it. Harm you to get it
At best when I'm sinnin' taste test hot lead as you give it. Damn
I wish I could go back to that man I used to be

If I was you I'd be dying to be
A reflection of the person that you're seeing in me
Like I was born on the moon, but I'm conceived by the sea
And I won't concede 'em 'till I'm achieving my dreams
So I'm flyin' home, home, home, home
And if you hear me I'm gone, gone, gone, gone

I feel like I'm a martian born on the moon in a crater
Please watch what the dudes you starting with partner I'll see you later
If I was you I'd copy me. The game is a monopoly
People always profiting off the poor folk in poverty
And obviously I did the same. Rob the bus so I can gain
Diamonds and them necklaces, earrings and all them shiny thangs
I'm ashamed, can't front on that
Hands to the start with your gun on your back
You ain't that hard you can hardly act
Ever ran up on a car with a 9 or a mack?
I did that as an iddity bitty baby
Chiddy chiddy bang bang cock back spray
Give 'em everything to lose over monetary gaining
And I get it from my daddy, he crazy
I wish I could go back to that man I used to be

If I was you I'd be dying to be
A reflection of the person that you're seeing in me
Like I was born on the moon, but I'm conceived by the sea
And I won't concede 'em 'till I'm achieving my dreams
So I'm flyin' home, home, home, home
And if you hear me I'm gone, gone, gone, gone

Now put your hands up
Flyin' home back to the space that I'm from
If you understand that you already knowing the same
When you came the same when you're gone
I'm flyin' home, home, home, home
Everybody stand up, hands to the sky. Thanks for living your life
Everyday that you live on the grind ain't legally living so you will survive
I'm gone, gone, gone, gone
I used to hate the man I'm is
Livin' a life of sinning
Been in the game a minute
I won't quit 'till I'm winning
All I can say is I gave it my best, with every gasp of my breath
I'ma go hard 'till there ain't none left
You think I'ma fail then you don't know Leq, naw

If I was you I'd be dying to be
A reflection of the person that you're seeing in me
Like I was born on the moon, but I'm conceived by the sea
And I won't concede 'em 'till I'm achieving my dreams
So I'm flyin' home, home, home, home
