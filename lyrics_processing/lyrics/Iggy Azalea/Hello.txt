Look, we gettin' money, we spendin' money
That's june money and december money
That's summer money and winter money
Cold-co-co-co-cold-cold
Clothes on top of clothes
I'm flyer than a bird, and I'm shittin' on you hoes
What you know? Bitch, I'm on
And can't nobody turn me off
And if I was a dick I would be hard
But you would make me soft, my God
He choosin' like hello, hello
Tall, pretty bitch, hair yellow
Yellow blond, but please don't think I'm dumb
I'm gettin' to this bread
Where's the Grey Poupon?
These dudes is on my jock every time I come
And you would think that I was strippin'
Shit, the way they throw the ones, I be like

I can make you do what the fuck I want you to do
I walk in they like "Hello, hello, hello"

And if I have to tell you one more time, I'll blow
Like a bomb, or a horn, or a bitch behind a bungalow at prom

Pussy two more times is exactly what he got
After I made it hot, and he spent up all his gwap
I'm talking racks on top of racks
And stacks on top of that

You dress like orphan Annie, give the kitchen back them rags
