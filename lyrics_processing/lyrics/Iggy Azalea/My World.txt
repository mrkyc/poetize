D.R.U.G.S

My world, rhyme vicious
White girl team full of bad bitches
D.R.U.G.S Gang, I'm in the zone
Aussie hoe, put my country on
G shit, I'm what you ain't
6-4 dip with the candy paint
I-I get done, what you can't
White bitch on Slauson, gangstas faint
Shut it down, go and hate
Had enough of these hoes, no time to waste
Amazing grace, embrace the place
Basic bitch, get out my face
I'm on the phone closing deals
George tell 'em next, half a mill
On the phone closing deals
George tell 'em next, half a mill

Cotton candy, laced in gold
Stack that money, sushi roll
Bottles up, feeling throw'd
V.I.P, overload

Higher than a motherfucker

Spittin', she the other color
Me and your man, secret agents, we under covers
My team on the scene, stay clean on these other brothers
Talk shit, get his nuts like a nutter butter
Iggy Pop, I'm gone bitch, burn rubber
Bo-bo-bottles over here, more 'till I die
Sparkle every bottle, see the glare in my eye
Turned over here, It's the 4th of July
White, Black, Asian, Latin hoes, Middle Eastern
