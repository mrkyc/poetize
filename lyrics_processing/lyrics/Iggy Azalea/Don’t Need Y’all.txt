I remember when it used to be simple
But all this cash, it just complicates things
And all this money that we into
It'll drive you crazy, but it only make me go harder, grow stronger
And get tougher when the road get longer
Sometimes you gon' think it's too much on ya
But think what I'd be doing if this wasn't goin' on
So I just keep pushin' when I'm being pulled in every direction
Now I'm poppin' so the they watchin' every step of my progression
Sometimes fame like a curse, latched to my blessing
On the road to the riches, turning earth into heaven, now
Dear Lord, if ya hear me, I don't need not a new friend near me
'Cause I don't want none of that fake love
'Cause how I'm looking at it, all of that be made up

I remember when I wasn't this big
And now ya'll wanna act like ya'll helped me get here
Oh now everybody wanna love me
Tried to knock me down but I'm strong
Did all this on my own
Ain't got no time for no new friends
So for now just leave me alone
I don't need y'all anyway
I don't need y'all anyway
I don't need y'all anyway
I don't need y'all anyway
I don't need y'all anyway
I don't need y'all anyway
I don't need y'all
You might also like
Making each and every song like it might be my last one
But still making sure the cash come
Still ain't forget the times when I didn't have none
Back against the wall feeling like I had to grab sumn
That's when, I took time and I figured it out
I'd rather deal with the stressin' more than living without
Take a one way trip to the top one time
Let you have it for a minute, now I want mine
Same girl on the cover of the magazine
Was the one hiding pain that you hadn't seen
Talkin' 'bout no money, no family
Sixteen in the middle of Miami
Same critics love me nowadays couldn't stand me
Now we talkin' 'bout VMA's and a Grammy
But in due time, turn nothin' into somethin'
So now I need money put in all of my discussions

I remember when I wasn't this big
And now ya'll wanna act like ya'll helped me get here
Oh now everybody wanna love me
Tried to knock me down but I'm strong
Did all this on my own
Ain't got no time for no new friends
So for now just leave me alone
I don't need y'all anyway
I don't need y'all anyway
I don't need y'all anyway
I don't need y'all anyway
I don't need y'all anyway
I don't need y'all anyway
I don't need y'all
And if you wasn't here when I was down
Then you won't be here when I'm up
Now the same one you looked over
Be the same one that blew up
Ain't it funny how this life thing works?
When you think it's finished, is when it all begins
Go from doubts to havin' the thought it might work
It goes up and down, and then it starts again
And when I reminisce, sometimes I
Can't even keep a dry eye
But my, how time flies by
When you on top of the world sky high

I remember when I wasn't this big
And now ya'll wanna act like ya'll helped me get here
Oh now everybody wanna love me
Tried to knock me down but I'm strong
Did all this on my own
Ain't got no time for no new friends
So for now just leave me alone
I don't need y'all anyway
I don't need y'all anyway
I don't need y'all anyway
I don't need y'all anyway
I don't need y'all anyway
I don't need y'all anyway
