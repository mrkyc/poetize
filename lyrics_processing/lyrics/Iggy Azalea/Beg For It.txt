I'ma make you beg, I'ma make you beg for it
I'ma make you beg, I'ma make you beg

Pulled up lookin' picture perfect, baby
High price (Ooh), but I'm worth it, baby
Can't play with ya, I've been busy workin', baby
Gettin' faded in the European, swervin', ayy
Look, describe Iggy, groundbreakin' what the word is
Hit the stage, ass shakin' like I'm nervous (Shake, shake)
When in New York, I be parkin' right on Madison
This ain't no accident, I'm killin' 'em on purpose
I-G-G-Y, did she just have to do it?
Baby, ride with me, fly livin', ain't nothin' to it
And my waist slim, ass fat, you gotta have it
Get my bake on, cake long, that's automatic

I know you like the way I turn it on
I'm out here with my friends
I'ma make you beg, I'ma make you beg for it
If you don't do this right, you're going home alone
I guess you'll have to beg
I'ma make you beg, I'ma make you beg for it

Pussy power, pay me by the hour (Right)
I need me a Braveheart, can't deal with a coward
I tell him if he ain't ballin', he should hit the showers (Ah)
If I pick you, you lucky, baby, this money ours (Right)
All yellow gold on me like I'm Trinidad (James)
Sittin' drop top, wonderin' where the ceiling's at
I know my old thang wanna bring the feelin' back
But I got a new thang, baby, I ain't feelin' that
Now Iggy, Iggy, Iggy, can't you see?
That everybody wanna put they hands on me (Ayy)
See, I be on this money while your man on me
And I need another hand with all these bands on me, wait

I know you like the way I turn it on
I'm out here with my friends
I'ma make you beg, I'ma make you beg for it
If you don't do this right, you're going home alone
I guess you'll have to beg
I'ma make you beg, I'ma make you beg for it

Get up out my face like who d'you think you are?
Talkin' all this trash like blah-de-blah-de-blah
Oh-eh-oh (Nuh-uh), oh-eh-oh, oh-eh-oh (Nuh-uh)
Get up out my face like who d'you think you are?
Make me wanna laugh like har-de-har-de-har
Oh-eh-oh (Nuh-uh), oh-eh-oh (Nuh-uh)
I know you like the way I turn it on
I'm out here with my friends
I'ma make you beg, I'ma make you beg for it
If you don't do this right, you're going home alone
I guess you'll have to beg
I'ma make you beg, I'ma make you beg for it

Got you hooked, boy, I'm like a drug
If you want my love better smoke it up
Make you beg for it, I'ma make you beg for it
You can look, boy, but don't you touch
If you want my love make me give a fuck
