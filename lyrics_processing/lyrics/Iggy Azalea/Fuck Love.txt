So you want a type of bitch that'll stay at home
But I'm too busy getting my own
For the kinda girl you want
Boy you need to call Tyrone
I don't need your help
I can take care of myself
I might get into the money
Baby, couldn't you tell?
I'm much chillin in Euro
Making a whole lotta euros
Yeah my money so plural
Honey that's what I do though

You can't break my heart
You can't take my pride
Oh no, that love shit, I won't do it

It's crazy, the mushy shit be making me hurl
Big baby, I know you want a taste of the pearl

Do what I want to, and I don't want you
