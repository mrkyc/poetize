I just wanna spend the night
I just wanna drink you up
Love, I do
Love, I do
Ooh-ooh-ooh
I blame it on your love
Love

Every time you get too close, I run, I run away
And every time you say the words, I don't know what to say
Back, back to the beginnin', really wish that I could change
I do, I do (I do)
Every time you get too close, I run, I run away
And every time you say the words, I don't know what to say
Back, back to the beginnin', really wish that I could change
I do, I do, I do

I blame it on your love every time I fuck it up
I blame it on your love, I do
I blame it on your love, I can't help it, I can't stop
I blame it on your love, I do

I blame it on your love, I do
I blame it on your love, I can't help it, I can't stop
I blame it on your love, I do
