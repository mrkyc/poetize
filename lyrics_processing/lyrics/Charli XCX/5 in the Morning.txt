I know your type, think you're one in a million
Your diamonds are fake, you ain't golden
But I only fuck with the ones who are rare enough
Real enough, down to keep goin'
It's 5 in the mornin'
And I'm goin' all in, I'm busy ballin'
Funny how wherever I wanna go
You wanna be there too

Pull up and stunt with your clique (Clique)
Glacier all up on your wrist (Wrist)
Think you're the sickest like you got diseases
But you ain't got nothing on this
I can see you talk, got a big mouth (Blah, blah, blah, blah)
Would you stick around for the comedown? (Come down, yeah!)
24/7, I'm 365
Wait for me heaven, I'm here 'til I die
Ah, ah

I'm goin' all in (All in)
It's 5 in the mornin', I'm busy ballin'
I ain't even stoppin' (No)
It's 5 in the mornin', I'm so devoted
I'm goin' all in (All in)
It's 5 in the mornin', I'm busy ballin'
I ain't even stoppin' (Yeah)
It's 5 in the mornin', yeah

Birthday cake, you want a piece 'cause it's tasty
We on a roll, we don't stop 'til the bottles all popped
And the pills got me wasted

Funny how wherever I wanna go
You wanna be there too
