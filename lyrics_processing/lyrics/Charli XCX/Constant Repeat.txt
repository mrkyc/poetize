(Ooh-oh-oh, ooh-oh-oh)
(Ooh-oh-oh, ooh-oh-oh)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (Bad girl if you wanted)

I'm focused on you, you're all on me too
I'm cute and I'm rude, and you like what I do
You said I run through your mind, so I put love on the line
I scared you away, you missed the chance of a lifetime

When you're lonely
Are you ever thinking 'bout the magic in me?
Do you wish I was yours?
When you're lonely (When you're lonely)
Am I ever on your mind on constant repeat?
Is it me that you want?

Do you realize I could've been the one to change your life?
You could've had a bad girl by your side
You could've had a bad girl
Could've had a bad girl if you wanted (Bad girl)
Do you even know the reasons why you had to let me go?
(Do you know?)
You could've had a bad girl by your side
You could've had a bad girl
Could've had a bad girl if you wanted (Bad girl)

Told you I'm cute and I'm rude with kinda rare attitude
You said I'm still on your mind, but now I don't have the time
You should've been brave, you missed the chance of a lifetime
