Ooh, ooh, ooh, Lord have mercy
I can't get ahead no way I try
Everything is outta pocket
Somebody do something
The brother's situation is abstract
Listen, mmm
Listen

I'm working forty hours
Six long days
And I'm highly embarrassed
Every time I get my pay
And they working everybody
Lord, they working poor folks to death
And when you pay your rent and your car note
You ain't got a damn thing left

Ain't that a bitch, ha, yes, it is
Somebody doing something slick, yeah, they are
It's got me wondering which is which
Might as well go out of town and dig a ditch
Ain't that a bitch, ha, yes, it is
Now ain't that a bitch

Let me tell you about my qualifications

I know accounting and psychology
I took a course in business
And I can speak a little Japanese, funk san
Gotta work two years
To get one week off with pay
And when I'm on my job
I better watch every word I say

Ain't that a bitch, ha ha, boy
Somebody doing something slick, downtown
It's got me wondering which is which
Might as well go out of town and dig a ditch
Ain't that a bitch, it's way, way too cold
Now ain't that a bitch

Make me wanna holler, ah, Lord, Lord
Lord have mercy this evening
Won't somebody please help me to see land, Lord
I want to play the guitar, come here guitar

Oh, somebody doing something slick
Now listen to this

Stopped at the supermarket
To get myself something to eat
And when I look at the prices
They knock me off of my feet
I was in the bologna section
And I had to take myself a close look
Now  couldn't have made these prices
With a sky hook

Ain't that a bitch, ha ha, yes, it is
Somebody doing something slick, yeah, they are
It's got me wondering which is which
Might as well go out of town and dig a ditch
Ain't that a bitch
Hmm, now ain't that a bitch

Sure is something slick going on
Sure is something slick
Sure is something slick going on
Sure is something slick (Ain't that a)
Sure is something slick going on
Sure is something slick

Somebody sure is slick (Ain't that a)
Sure is something slick going on
Sure is something slick
Sure is something slick going on (Ain't that a)
Somebody sure is slick (It's a bitch)
Sure is something slick going on
Sure is something slick (Ain't that a)
Sure is something slick going on
