You walked in
Pretty skies just rolling away (hey listen)
What is this magic?
I can see a brighter day
Before there was you, I was drifting off in space (yes I was)
Makin big 
Not getting any place but you know what?

I wanna thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you for being you

Oh baby
Oh baby, for being you (oh you're so sweet)
Putting all my memories on the shelf (the shelf, listen)
Ain't got time to think of nothing else (no, no, no)
The love you bring is full of fire-e-e-e
Being close to you is my desire (is my desire, yeah baby)
Can't get enough of your sweet love (can't get enough, no I can't, can't get enough)
I just want some more (I want some more, I want some more, I want some more, I want some more, I want some more)
(listen)
All of the love
(all of the love)
I wanna do strange things to you baby (yes I do, yes I do, right now, right now)
Things that I never wanted to do before
(tell the truth)
(I think it turns me on)
Listen for example
I wanna kiss you straight through about 90 days
A whole lot of other freakish thangs baby on this record I wouldn't dare to say
But I'd just like to say, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you for being you
Woo-woo Woo-woo Woo-woo, Woo-woo thank you baby Woo-woo
You might also like
I wanna thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you for being you
Thank you baby baby baby oh baby, oh baby, thank you baby
Oh let me play this piano, come here piano
(Oh thank you baby)
(Look out)
(Woooo-Ohhhh)
(Yeahhhhhh)
(Thank you baby, thank you baby)

I wanna thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you for being you
Oh baby, oh baby, oh baby for being you, oh baby oh baby
Go on with your bad self
Woo-woo baby
I just wanna thank you this evening
Go on with your bad self
Wooooo-woooo
(You're so sweet baby, you're so sweet baby)
