I'm stronger than a locomotive, yeah

But I can't understand sometimes, baby

When it come to getting over you, baby
Well, I can't get off the ground

Something's wrong, yeah, yes, it is

Faster than a speeding bullet
I've out-flown a few, yes, I have
But I must be flying awful slow sometimes, baby

I got X-ray vision
And I can see, see through steel, too, baby
I know there's something wrong with me
'Cause I can't see through you
