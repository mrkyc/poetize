I want to hold your hand
Gonna make love just as long as we can (long as we can baby)
And I'm gon' be your man and make you understand
Every, every time we kiss baby
I know that heaven must be like this
Oh this feeling, this feeling I can't resist
I feel so brand, I feel so brand

We'll climb to the top of the ladder
And that ain't all that we'll do
There'll be some healing and speeding, it's you I'll be pleasing
Loving and feeding, more love we'll be needing
My love is your love and your love is my love
If my love is your love then uh
Give me my love (give me my love baby)
Give me my love (give me my love sugar)

Let me get close to you
We'll be as one, before I'm through
I just wanna keep on, oh keep on loving you
And here's what we're go-
Touch, touch, touch, find the direction
It's all about love (yes it is), sweet love and affection
I'll put your name (oh yes I will) in the uhh marriage uh section
It will be mine, oh it will be mine

And that ain't all that we'll do (ha no it ain't, listen)
There'll be some heating and speeding, it's you I'll be pleasing

My love is your love and your love is my love
If my love is your love then uh
Give me my love (I want you to)
Give me my love
