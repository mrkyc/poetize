Uh-uh, oh my goodness
Ooh, le-lemme get up out this bed
Uh, woo, woo, listen

Eight o'clock in the mornin'
My feet better hit the floor, mm-hmm
And they barely keep movin'
Until thirty past four, ain't that cold?
Any fool in his right mind
Would've tried to get some rest, ha
But you know how we do
I was out there tryna catch

That's my claim to fame, haha, listen
That's my claim to fame, good God
That's my claim to fame, you know what? Ha

It's a damn shame, ooh, yes it is
Come on, help me, I know you could say it
It's a damn shame
Now-now listen to this here
You might also like
I take off my uniform
As soon as I get home
I reach in my closet
And put somethin' slick on
Race to my driveway
I jump off in my ride
And-and as soon as I try to leave
My shoulder done got tired

That's my claim to fame, haha, ain't that cold? Listen
That's my claim to fame, people
That's my claim to fame, haha, you know what? Listen

It's a damn shame
Believe me when I tell you, I'ma say it again
It's a damn shame
Come on, help me, I know you could do it
It's a damn shame
I'm tellin' the truth
It's a damn shame
Oh, le-lemme play somethin' here

Ow
Oh yeah, listen

Last night at the disco
When I should've been gettin' my sleep
I met a cute little brick house
And she knocked me off of my feet
Up we sit in a dark corn'
And before her eyes could wink, listen
I asked her before she asked me
So maybe I could get me a drink

That's my claim to fame, haha, ain't that cold?
That's my claim to fame, people, listen
That's my claim to fame, you know what? Mmm

Uh, it's a damn shame (Ooh, ow, ow, ow, yeah-yeah)
It's a damn shame (Every day now, now)

It's a damn shame (Workin' down here at this car wash, he cold, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
It's a damn shame (Yeah, yeah, yeah, woah, woah, woah)
