This weekend was fully devoted to you
You said you were coming through real soon
That was now a couple hours ago
I'm thinking in my head you really got nerve
Cause this won't be the first time that you stood me up
Well baby I got news for you
It's time to get a taste of your own medicine
I'm throwing my vest on
I'm letting my hair down
I'm not bout to spend the night alone, lone
You just made my ish list
Baby you can kiss it
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight!
I'ma dance till the morning
I'm not waiting up for you
Boy, I'm turning off my phone tonight (night, night, night)
By the time that you call
I'll be walkin in without you on the floor (floor, floor)
I'ma party with my beautiful people (people, people)
You beautiful people, people
I'ma party with my beautiful people (people, people)
You beautiful people, people
I'ma party with my beautiful people
You might also likeI'ma make it known the second I arrive
For your sake, you better hope nobody catch my eye
Cause since your living like you're single
I'ma do the same, I'ma do my thing, yeah
When I hear my song, make the DJ turn it up
In the middle of the floor, I-I-I'ma burn it up
No longer will I be worried bout you
You could find me in the night life
Here I come!
I'm throwing my vest on
I'm letting my hair down
I'm not bout to spend the night alone, lone
You just made my ish list
Baby you can kiss it
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight!
I'ma dance till the morning
I'm not waiting up for you
Boy, I'm turning off my phone tonight (night, night, night)
By the time that you call
I'll be walkin in without you on the floor (floor, floor)
