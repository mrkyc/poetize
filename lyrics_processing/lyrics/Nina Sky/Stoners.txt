We gotta be the stoners
To take a trip like this
You keep me higher than a spaceship flying
We're stoners
Take a trip like this
There's no denying I'm addicted to your kiss
We're stoners

Taking flight with more miles than a flight attendant
You got me on the ride, the roller-coaster that's never ending
Don;t need to fight, you gon' like my clip
Just give the taste of your two lips
No paper to feel it
Give me what you're dealin'

We might be the stoners
Take a trip like this
You keep me higher than a spaceship
Flying, we're stoners
Take a trip like this
There's no denying I'm addicted to your kiss
We're stoners
You might also like
A night cap on the long work day
And one hit straight to your face
So stoned from the love we made
A hang over that you can take

We might be the stoners
Take a trip like this
Then keep me higher than a spaceship
Flying, we're stoners
Take a trip like this
There's no denying I'm addicted to your kiss
We're stoners

Roll up, seal it with a twist
You ain't never had no bomb like this
Burner, perfect occasion for a song like this
A session with the god and your lungs might quit
A number one on the list
She's going down. Fuck biting the dirt, got so high, bit a cloud
Big pull, think you got it figured out
Rookie calls, let it all out
Ah, might be time to set it down
Few sips of smart water, level without
Now where that lighter went you bored in your crib
Fuck it, homie, get high again
I live my life, got stoned, fuck around and miss my flight
Forest Gump, fake shit happens, I'm a stoner
Purell in my hands, trying to cover the aroma
