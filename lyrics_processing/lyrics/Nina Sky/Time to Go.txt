Finally you saw me
Found out I was seeing someone new
Knew you wouldn't ask me
'cause you brought this to yourself
(Chorus)
Think its time to go
Since you played me thought that you should know (thought that you should know)
All your lies won't take it anymore
Packed your shit and left it at the door
Oh baby think its time to go
(Verse 2)
I think about how you treated me
Feeding me your lies you couldn't see
Thought that I would stay true
Instead I left with someone else
(Chorus)
Think its time to go
Since you played me thought that you should know
All your lies Won't take it anymore (I won't take your lies no more no more no more)
Packed your shit and left it at the door (I left them at the front door)
Oh baby think its time to go
You might also like(Bridge)
Dont go pointing fingers at me
'cause I always knew you'd cheat
So I had to make you see
Was it all worth losing me
And its better off this way
And thats all that I can say
You know two can play that game
I guess that's put your arse in shame
(Verse 3 - Angie Martinez)
Ohh you ain't wanna know but I'm gunna say it
You knew from the door I was nothin to play with
You had my love and you betrayed it so I take it back
Far as anotha brotha calm as a mothaf**ka
Was I wit him yea you was neva even there
Talkin bout I hurt ya how bout I dont even care
Plans we had they through man they dead to me
I got new man he treat me like a Kennedy
Yea hes somethin as a team we heavy
We at customs sluggish lookin like a ???
Talkin bout you missin Ang Im disgusted
Talkin bout how you could kiss my ass man
You violated all my general laws
And I can't take it gotta get a divorse
He did the right thing while you was gettin a broads
And his pipe game is betta than yours
Ready or not you can 'cause you denied
All the lies you told me baby
Ready or not here I go I can't hide
All the ways you hurt me baby
Think its time to go
Since you played me thought that you should know
All your lies Won't take it anymore
Packed your shit and left it at the door
