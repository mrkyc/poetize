Passing me by remember when i used to give you some time
And though I wasted it
I can't deny you were important for a very small time
So insignificant
Bridge:
And now you talking shh like I ain't hearing it
Your boys be trying to holla
I know you feeling it
You said its dead and gone (gone)
But you still play my song (song)
I hear you getting all emotional
Chorus:
Because
Im on some bullshh (buup what you heard)
Im really on some bullshh (buup what you heard)
You know im on some bullshh (buup what you heard)
Im really on some bullshh (buup what you he-e-eard)
Verse:
Had some good times (ti times) I ain't gon lie
But they were never at night (night)
What were you working with
Little that slide (slide) cause after all I thought you were a nice guy (oh no)
Really you were a trick
