Baby, Ride it, ride it
Let me slide in inside it
Legs divide it, hands tried it
Try hide it, have you tried it?
Your boyfriend askin' me 'bout me and you, but I denied it
If you did not keep you private, would you survive it?
She hot like Nine Seven or Nine Eleven
Feels like me died and gone to heaven
Mi still revin', because later
Me wake up to good morning, sir
Like a house, I move into her
Like needles to a record, I groove into her
Dance with blazers and civers
Stop, alright back to where we were (Oh)

Move your body, girl (Move it, babe)

Move your body, girl (Move your body)
