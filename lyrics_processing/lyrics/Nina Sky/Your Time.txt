Attracted to your style your brand new suit
Didn't take that long to fall in love
Built this bond it became so strong
But as time passes changes are visible
Work more often and lately busy too
Wondering whats goin'on
What's taking up your time
My friend sayings that your cheating
Should I read the signs
(Chorus)
Should I move on and find someone better
Should I sit down and write you a letter
You bought me gifts and a diamond ring
But all I really want is just one thing
Your time
Should I move on and find someone better
Should I sit down and write you a letter
You bought me gifts and a diamond ring
But all I really want is just one thing
Simply your time, all I want is your time
All I need is your time, your time, your time, your time
Tired of sleepin' home alone at night
Dreamin' of you should be by my side
How many nights have I sat and cried
Relationships should consist of you and I
Time'all I ask for with you
Thought that this was so sure
I always miss you when your not around
Been waiting for you but you let me down
You might also like(Chours)
Should I move on and find someone better
Should I sit down and write you a letter
You bought me gifts and a diamond ring
But all I really want is just one thing
Your time
Should I move on and find someone better
Should I sit down and write you a letter
You bought me gifts and a diamond ring
But all I really want is just one thing
Your time, simply your time, all I want is your time
Your time, your time
Your love is so incredible
Need you to know that
I need you here with me, with me
And when you go
I miss you so
Just let me know should I move on, move on
(Chorus)
Should I move on and find someone better
Should I sit down and write you a letter
You bought me gifts and a diamond ring
But I really want is just one thing
Your time
Should I move on and find someone better
Should I sit down and write you a letter
You bought me gifts and a diamond ring
But all I really want is just one thing
Your time, simply your time, all I want is your time
