Can't believe our song is fading out
Thought we would dance like this forever
But every single note is breaking down
Til there's no sound
And I'm choking on the thought of this
You broken up this part of us for what
Was it worth it
Cause when the music ends
You won't be seeing me again
And then you'll know
If it was worth it
You were innocent until I proved you guilty
Even though it kills me
The truth is better then the lie
No going back, I've reached my final verdict
You had my heart and hurt it
But I won't let you see me cry
This is our last dance (our last dance)
This is our last dance (our last dance)
So take my hand
Follow me down to the floor right now
Only have half the song left to go
I'm not even angry for what you've done
I'm only sad I have to let go
And I'm choking on the thought of this
You broken up this part of us for what
Was it worth it
Cause when the record ends
You won't be seeing me again
And then you'll know
If it was worth it
You might also likeYou were innocent until I proved you guilty
Even though it kills me
The truth is better then the lie
No going back, I've reached my final verdict
You had my heart and hurt it
But I won't let you see me cry
This is our last dance (our last dance)
This is our last dance (our last dance)
Ohh would you rather know the truth
Even if it was hurting you
Could you say goodbye
If you knew it was right (if you knew that it was right)
You were innocent until I proved you guilty
Even though it kills me
The truth is better then the lie
No going back, I've reached my final verdict
You had my heart and hurt it
But I won't let you see me cry
This is our last dance (our last dance)
