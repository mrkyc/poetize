I'm sitting here all confused
Never-ending thoughts of you
My days and nights, they're lonely
Happiest times, all memories
I dream of past days gone by
When you were right here by my side
To help me cope with all this pain
Without you, my friend, life's not the same

Good times, they're gone
My smiles, no more
Childhood memories of you and me
Can't believe we never said goodbye
I sing this song
To show you your spirit lives on
I hope you're hearing this
Because you're surely missed

Woke up one day to bad news
Car accident involving you
Ambulance said you'd be safe
Guess only God knew your fate
I could not believe my ears
My heart had dropped, I burst to tears
My best friend, my other half
So much has changed since you passed
You might also like
Good times, they're gone
My smiles, no more
Childhood memories of you and me
Can't believe we never said goodbye
I sing this song
To show you your spirit lives on
I hope you're hearing this
Because you're surely missed

Gotta be strong for the family
Never forget what you mean to me
You'll always be in our hearts
Heaven was missing an angel
But why did they take you?
Our first-born will be blessed with your name
To live on your legacy
I miss you and know you're watching me
Oh, oh, oh
I miss you, I need you
Can't believe we never said goodbye
I sit here and cry
Let this song express my emotion
Let it speak for my heart
You'll always be in my heart
Good times, they're gone (Oh, they're gone)
My smiles, no more (My smiles are no more)
Childhood memories of you and me (I always think of you)
Can't believe we never said goodbye (Oh)
I sing this song (I sing this song)
To show you your spirit lives on (I always think of you)
I hope you're hearing this (I hope you're hearing this)
Because you're surely missed
Good times, they're gone (Oh, they're gone)
My smiles, no more (My smiles are no more)
Childhood memories of you and me
(You'll never be forgotten)
Can't believe we never said goodbye (No, no, no, no)
I sing this song (I sing this song)
To show you your spirit lives on (Your spirit lives on)
I hope you're hearing this (I know you're hearing this)
