Now, Who?d of thought, we?d end up this way
Talkin? to each other, like the enemy
There?s really only three words, I should say
But even if I did, would you hear them any way
We should have read the signs
We could have made more time
Why was I so blind
To what was out in front of me
I never thought I?d be the last to know
I never thought you?d be the first to go
Forever never lasts too long enough for us to have a chance to hold
So take me by the hand I?m on my knees
Together we will stand now I belieeeeeeeve
Somewhere in that plan there?s gotta be
A second chance for you and me
There was a time when we made history
But the dream we tried to keep became the casualty
We traded paradise for misery
What was once a house of love, is now a battlefield

We could have made more time
Why was I so blind
To what was out in front of me
I never thought I?d be the last to know
I never thought you?d be the first to go
Forever never lasts too long enough for us to have a chance to hold
So take me by the hand I?m on my knees
Together we will stand now I belieeeeeeeve
Somewhere in that plan there?s gotta be
A second chance for you and me
It?s not about what we want
It?s all about holdin? o-o-o-o nnnnnn
I never thought I?d be the first to cry
This doesn?t have to be our last goodbye
Forever?s gonna wait just long enough for us
To fight for one more try
So take me by the hand I?m on my knees
Together we will stand now I belieeeeeeeve
Somewhere in that plan there hadta be
A second chance for you and me
A second chance for you and me
A second chance for you and me-e-e-e-e
Somewhere in that plan there had to be-e-e-e-e
