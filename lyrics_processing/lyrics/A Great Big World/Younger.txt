I wish I was younger
The fat kid with the big, blue eyes full of wonder
No shame, no fame, no worries, the king of wiffle ball (oh, oh, oh-oh-oh)
Without a care at all
I wish I was younger
Keeping track of the lightning strikes and the thunder
Barely thirteen, no hurry, my feet over the wall (oh, oh, oh-oh-oh)
It doesn't matter if I fall

I wish I was younger
I wish I was younger

I wish I was younger
Barbies and fashion shows with my brother
So clear, no fear, no bullies, I didn't even know (oh, oh, oh-oh-oh)
Where did all that magic go?
I remember third grade, shades, new rollerblades
4 foot 2, feeling 10 foot 8
Classic Mario
I remember charades, your braids, my first date
Working at the pool, barely ever getting paid
Do you remember those days?
I wish I was younger
Getting high with my friends outside in the summer
Never cool, never had a lot of money, but damn we had it all (oh, oh, oh-oh-oh)
We had it all

I wish I was younger
I wish I was younger

I wish I was younger
Butterflies in my chest when I asked for your number
You smiled and said, "You're funny"
Two words and I was gone (oh, oh, oh-oh-oh)
You wrote it on my arm (oh, oh, oh-oh-oh)
I swear, we set off the alarm (oh, oh, oh-oh-oh)

Do you remember making out in the stands?
Showing up late and getting kicked out of band?
Poor Mr. Kafer never could understand
Just take me back to who I was when I was younger
Do you remember riding home in the rain?
That Sunday morning, playing Songs About Jane?
And from that moment I was never the same
Just take me back to who I was when I was younger
Just take me back to who I was when I was younger
