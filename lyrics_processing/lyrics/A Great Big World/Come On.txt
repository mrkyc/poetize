Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on

I wanna be a thought inside your mind
I wanna see the starlight through your eyes
What's it like?
Drive underneath the night you'll be the glow
No matter where we are, it feels like home
Say it's so
Say you'll go with me tonight

Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Move in just a little closer
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Show me what it's like
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Don't wait 'til the moment's over
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on

Time suspended in slow motion, not a sound
Walking on a wire above the ground
Don't look down
And say you'll go with me tonight
You might also like
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Move in just a little closer
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Show me what it's like
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Don't wait 'til the moment's over
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on

Oh, show me what I don't know
Show me how to let go
I've been waiting

Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on

Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Move in just a little closer
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Show me what it's like
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Don't wait 'til the moment's over
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Don't wait 'til the moment's over
