There's a girl in the backyard bangin' on her drum
Sitting in a junkpile laughing at the sun
Singing, "Ah ha ha, I just wanna be a rockstar"
There's a boy in the backseat singing to the song
Playing on the radio knowing he's the one
Singing, "Ah ha ha, I just wanna be a rockstar"
Singing, "Ah ha ha, I was born to be a rockstar"

There's a girl in the treetop looking at the stars
Waiting for a touchdown coming in from Mars
Thinking, "Is there anybody out there?"
There's a boy thinking of her playing his guitar
Searching for the answer buried in his heart
Thinking, "Ah ha ha, is there anybody out there?
Singing, "Ah ha ha, is there anybody out there?"

If there's a meaning can you show me a sign?
The more I look it just gets harder to find
The world is spinning and I wanna know why

And we're all getting older wishing we were young
Hanging on the memory of what we would be become
Singing, "Ah ha ha, I was born to be a rockstar"
Singing, "Ah ha ha I just wanna be a rockstar"
Singing, "Ah ha ha I was born to be a rockstar"

If there's a meaning can you show me a sign?
The more I look it just gets harder to find
The world is spinning and I wanna know why
And maybe we will never figure it out
I got a feeling that's what life's all about
I'm learning anything is possible now

Take a ticket and get off the line
Take a ticket and get off the line
Take a ticket and get off the line
Take a ticket and get off the line
So take a ticket and get off the line
Take a ticket and get off the line
So take a ticket and get off the line
So take a ticket and get off the line

Singing, "Ah ha ha, I was born to be a rockstar"
Singing, "Ah ha ha, I was born to be a rockstar"
Singing, "Ah ha ha, I just wanna be a rockstar"
