I would like to shout it from the highest mountain
To tell the world I've found love and what it means to me
But all around there's violence and laws to make me think again
Maybe one day they will understand
There's more to love than boy meets girl
There's more to love than boy meets girl
For love is strange and uncontrolled, it can happen to anyone
There's more to love than boy meets girl
How can one man decide the fate and destiny of innocent lovers
And why is it less of a crime to take the life of another?
Through time they've always tried to hide and cast aside this love denied
In the shadows we held each other tight
There's more to love than boy meets girl
There's more to love than boy meets girl
For love is strange and uncontrolled, it can happen to anyone
There's more to love than boy meets girl
I saw your face, it caught the light, infatuation swirls inside
My every thought for days was only you
So I'll climb that mountain and shout it loud
I'll never let them bring me down
And one day they will have to understand
There's more to love than boy meets girl
There's more to love than boy meets girl
For love is strange and uncontrolled, it can happen to anyone
There's more to love than boy meets girl
