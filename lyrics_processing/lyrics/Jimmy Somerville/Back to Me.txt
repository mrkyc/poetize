Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
(Oh-oh)
Back to me (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Back to me (Oh-oh)
Bring it home

I can feel you, feel your hand in mine
Though you are so far away from me
I can hear you, hear you call my name
Telling me you'll soon be on your way

Somehow break it down and bring it back to me
Somehow break it down and bring it home
Somehow break it down and bring it back to me
Somehow break it down and bring it home

(Oh-oh)
Back to me (Oh-oh)
Bring it home (Oh-oh)
Back to me (Oh-oh)
Bring it home
You might also like
I have waited far too long for you
I need to see to touch your smiling face
I won't dream for dreamers dream alone
It's time to make it real so come on home

Somehow break it down and bring it back to me
Somehow break it down and bring it home
Somehow break it down and bring it back to me
Somehow break it down and bring it home
Somehow break it down and bring it back to me
Somehow break it down and bring it home
Somehow break it down and bring it back to me
Somehow break it down and bring it home

Bring it home, bring it back to me
Bring it home, bring it back to me
Bring it home, bring it back to me
I've waited far too long

Somehow break it down and bring it back to me
Somehow break it down and bring it home
Somehow break it down and bring it back to me
Somehow break it down and bring it home (I've waited far too long)
Somehow break it down and bring it back to me
Somehow break it down and bring it home
Somehow break it down and bring it back to me
Somehow break it down and bring it home
Bring it home
Break it down and bring it home
Break it down and bring it home
Break it down and bring it home
