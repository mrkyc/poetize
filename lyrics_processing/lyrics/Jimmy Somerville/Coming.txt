I am coming
I am coming
I am coming through
Coming across the divide to you
In this moment of unity
Feeling an ecstasy
To be here, to be now
At last I am free

Yes, at last, at last
To be free of the past
And of the future that beckons me

Here I am
Neither a woman, nor a man
We are joined, we are one
With the human face
We are joined, we are one
With the human face

And I am in outer space
I'm being born and I am dying
