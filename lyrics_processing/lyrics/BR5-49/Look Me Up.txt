Oh yeah!

Well, one of these days he's gonna go too far
And push you right over the edge
And leave you sittin' solo on a Saturday night
A-wonderin' where he went

Ooh, ooh, ooh, I've been rubbin' my hands
And waitin' on my lucky break
Knowin' in my heart  it's just a matter of time
Before he makes his last mistake

He'll leave you cryin'
But that's okay
I'll be ready
Whenever you say

Look me up
When he lets you down
Like a tom cat
I'll be hangin' around
In your arms faster than the speed of sound
Look me up, I'll be over when he let's you down

Well, I fit it any fool that tries to get in my way
When my turn comes around
Ninety miles an hour through the drag race, ain't
Nothin' gonna slow me down

One track Monday
That's what I am
You'll find my number
Under "I'm your man"

Look me up
When he lets you down
Like a tom cat
I'll be hangin' around
In your arms faster than the speed of sound
Look me up, I'll be over when he let's you down

You know that you should be with me
How long you're gonna let him run around?
Look me up, I'll be over when he let's you down
Whoa!
Mm, I've been longin'
To be your darlin'

Look me up
When he lets you down
Like a tom cat
I'll be hangin' around
In your arms faster than the speed of sound

Look me up, when he let's you down
Like a tom cat
I'll be hangin' around
In your arms faster than the speed of sound
Look me up, I'll be over when he lets you down
Look me up, I'll be over when he lets you down
