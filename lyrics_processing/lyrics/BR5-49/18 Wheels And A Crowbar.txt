Twenty-one days, not a wink of sleep
Got a belly full of pills and a bottle of heat
Sleep makes you old  on the road
Truckin' is a young man's trade
Pinhead pencil-pushing loud-mouthed geek
Cut me off at mile-marker thirty-three
I made him pay for the move he made
With his Pinto and a fiery grave

Eighteen wheels and a crowbar
Cuttin' you down to size
Eighteen wheels and a crowbar
Can't run away this time
Eighteen wheels and a crowbar
I'm gonna put the hammer down
Eighteen wheels and a crowbar
Fate was on the dashboard looking right at me now

Big rig rollin' through a foggy night
The bile in my stomach don't taste quite right
Three men in a Mercedes Benz
Got wrapped around a telephone pole
You might also likeDon't know my twenty and my eyelids shut
I've fallen down and I can't get up
Driving blind, but just in time
To lay to rest your weary soul

Eighteen wheels and a crowbar
Cuttin' you down to size
Eighteen wheels and a crowbar
Can't run away this time
Eighteen wheels and a crowbar
I'm gonna put the hammer down
Eighteen wheels and a crowbar
Fate was on the dashboard looking right at me now

I've been hauled, mauled, run to the side
I've got the pedal to the metal and I ain't satisfied
I tarped my load but the open road
Slipped a wrench in the dispatch skull
As I raise the tire-tool above my head
Come crashing through the desert in a flash of red
I've pain in my foot, there's knots in my gut
It's time to pay the human toll
Eighteen wheels and a crowbar
Cuttin' you down to size
Eighteen wheels and a crowbar
Can't run away this time
Eighteen wheels and a crowbar
I'm gonna put the hammer down
Eighteen wheels and a crowbar
Fate was on the dashboard looking right at me now
