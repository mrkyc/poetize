In a cheap hotel on the Missouri side
I had you out in my car in the parking lot
Early next morning we were driving east
Headed for the big city where I felt at least
We could enjoy the weather as long as we didn't talk
But I spoiled it by speaking my swirly head
And you rolled them eyes turned to me and said
(chorus)
There's only one thing you got wrong with you
It ain't the whole world looking at you
Why don't you find yourself a life that's real
Too lazy to work, too nervous to steal
Well we got to the city and you got a job
Delivering the L.L.Bean catalogue
I was bored and restless, didn't know where to go
Late one evening after I got up
My guitar and I found our way into a club
I saw the queen of diamonds work that big dance floor
Well she looked at me but I couldn't go
That familiar face said, do you want to know
You might also likeThere's only one thing you got wrong with you
It ain't the whole world looking at you
Why don't you find yourself a life that's real
Too lazy to work, but too nervous to steal
You gave me 24 hours to pack up my bags and glide
No one's got respect for a man going over the side
Well you went back to the station to make sure I was gone
That bus was on time you didn't have to wait long
I saw the bright lights of Nashville disappear behind me
Well that Greyhound was cool under the summer heat
I could still see your face from my window seat
I was so happy to see your crooked smile of relief
But after miles and miles of that highway has droned
I hear the last thing you said when we were all alone
There's only one thing you got wrong with you
It ain't the whole world looking at you
Why don't you find yourself a life that's real
Too lazy to work, too nervous to steal
Too lazy to work, too nervous to steal
