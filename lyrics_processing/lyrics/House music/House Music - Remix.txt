I knew back then this illegal computer sound was gonna be my call
My heart got hooked on 4x4 beats when house took its journey with
Jack, Chicago and Acid House
Now my heart is hooked forever
It's in my soul
In my veins
On my mind 24/7
Don't care if it's Jazz, Soul, Tech, Minimal, Funky, Vocal or Hip-house
Name it I love it
Its all about the House music and it always has been
I don't understand people who satisfy with ordinary pop music
They just listen to whatever radio stations decide they should like and my God, they like it
Some people even think that house club's for weirdo's only
Maybe they are right, maybe we are weird, maybe this music is weird
And maybe the clubs are overrated
We were in this for the love of music, for the love of beats, for the love of loops
For the love of loops...
Its all about the House music and it always has been
If you're into house music the DJ seems like a natural path to follow
And back in the days, DJ's were weird people who like music in a weird way
Back then you'll have to be a nerd to become a DJ
Nowadays everybody wants to be a DJ
Nowadays everybody wants to be that nerd
It sickens me
If you are not in it for the love of the music
Would you please f*** off!
Hate those smart a**es who think DJing is the easy way to get laid
Well, get a life!
You might also likeI wonder what house would be like in the future
Wonder what the clubs would be like
Now that technology has taken over the DJ world
What will the DJ be like in the future
Let's just hope that house music will keep its soul
Let's just hope that DJ's will keep their skin
Because it's not about how you do it
But why you do it
But actually I don't give a s***
We don't give a s***
