Hit the shower for an hour, and brush my grill
Call Diezel to make sure he ain't puttin pork on the grill (Wah)
Call J up, pour Cristal on the Mile, what's up

Of the six, huh, maybe I'll drive the five

Yo, these lil' young girls wildin' out
Told 'em chill, we on the way to my momma's house
Pimped out, placed my right hand on her thigh
And the beam from VVS, hit her in the eye like "Hi"
I used to think that they was blowin' me off
Now they takin me to they momma's and they showin' me off
Now they momma's ready to ride, they got the clickin' tongue
He in a, E-S V with 26-inch chrome
We gotta, get to this party and crank it up
In a six full of ass, wanna spank it up
That's what's up, food and drink with some bad hoes
I'm lovin' to see 'em steppin' with them pedicured toes (Oh!)
Today's the day, tonight's the night
A backyard party and it ain't no fights
Who footin' the whole bill? Anybody wanna go?
Long as you know that you out for (Yuh), the night, so let's roll
