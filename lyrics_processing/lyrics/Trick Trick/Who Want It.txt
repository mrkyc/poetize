Yeah, we back baby!
(Yea, let's go!)
I told y'all we was comin' back
(We done time!)
Detroit
What, bitch?
It's Trick-Trick!
(Yeah!)
And motherfuckin' Slim Shady! (Hahahahahaaa!)
(What?)
Gettin' back, yo!
Get your motherfuckin' hands up!

We've been accused of everything from chest wets to death threats
The best yet and niggas gettin' they neck checked
Best check to protect, Detroit ain't only known
For the best threats, so bet, we got decks
 collect debt and rests the goon squad
We wreck your whole set, we rep the Mid-West
You rappin' niggas get wrong, speak on us on your songs
We sendin' them home, stones thrown and broken bones
Better leave us the fuck alone, keep it runnin' through niggas
Can't even stomach what the D got comin'
And waitin' until they frontin' and poppin' off at the chops, boy
We poppin' off shots and guaranteein' a spot at the top
First place for niggas gettin' got
You think you fuckin' with Trick and Eminem, but no, you not, motherfucker
So next time you see us be sure that you make a hole
And when they mention the D, get down on all fours

Ooh, wow, look at the bitches up in this club
Man I'm gettin' me some digits 'fore I leave up out this mug
And it's like boom pow, wham, bam, thank you ma'am
I ain't kissin' you on the lips but I'll be glad to shake your hand
Now let's get blew out, let's start some shit tonight
Just let me pick the chick that I'ma leave here with tonight 'fore we get to fightin'
And threw out, this music makes me rowdy
How they gonna play that new Trick-Trick and expect no one to get their shit split?
It's just too wild, and one more shot of Hpnotiq
And I am not in control of my body, I go robotic
And blow a fuse out, homies is like, "You're startin' to stagger"
And I'm like, "Nah that's just my swagger" and I'm dancin' with this fat girl
And gettin' loose now, I don't wanna fight, I feel like partyin'
'Til this idiot dumps his Bacardi on my cardigan
And knocks my screws out, it never fails, I know I'm goin' to jail
I might as well take the laces out my shoes now

I hear 'em screamin', "Goddammit, there go the Eminem in him"
It ain't no hittin' him, they think that we just clanked up, but he been with them
It's Trick and them Goon Squad gangstas, you can't get to him
We down for the bang and the brawl but now we killin' 'em
See, ever since we started you might've had to pardon
Our heart is from the largest city, they sayin' that we retarded
And , so stop, some of their artists got dropped
You think I'm playin'? Then bring it, come on let's see what you got
We make the club go bang *gunshot*, you got that light noise
See, ain't nobody fuckin' with this nigga and this white boy
Done been through the realest and the pros, treated their best like hoes
We put the thugs on and make 'em beat up out of they clothes
We don't give a fuck about nothin' you used to do
Your record is equivalent to a high school musical
No blamin' Jimmy Iovine, Paul or Dre
Blame me for everything I say, 'cause I got him nigga
