Detroit
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (C'mon, c'mon)
Everybody get the bread (C'mon, c'mon)
Where you at? Where you at? Get bread
Where you at? Where you at? Get bread
Detroit, Detroit, get bread

They knew Trick was coming through to smash the haters and the bustas
Detroit players, baby, natural born hustlers
Gettin' bread from Jefferson, 'til the end of bright mode (Woo)
Got  sold up, now how ya like those?
We done trained everything from G's to hot lead
We can tell when a boss fled, gettin' that bread
Cartier wrist wear, hold it down to the socks
Plus I'm bricked down the middle, take a home girl shopping
And the hood-rats love everything we do
They ain't trippin' on you partner, 'cause they gettin' bread too
This the thief, lil' boy, they ain't checkin' for flip
They checkin' for Trick Trick, so you can say they're trippin'
I ain't gon' front, we the hottest bang loose with the choppa
Ain't no city gettin' bread like mine, not ne'er, nada
Bring your spot work and broke ass head, get ran outta
Detroit, you can't set up shop and get mad dollars

To all my thugs in the club, get the bread
The five tenets of the law, get the bread
Girls shaking that thang, get' bread
Go, swinging that chain, get the bread
The DJ spinnin' nines, get the bread
Boy pushin' that pie, get the bread
Got a knot from the block, get the bread
Got the spot, we go hard, get the bread
Talkin' 'bout

Frosty face on the watch, got birked
Call it frosty flakes, see it shine boy
Gotta be a boss to play
I ain't lyin', I been flyin' all 'cross the way
Tryna drop that ticket, y'all ain't ready for this
I can hit it with a big and get twenty for this
This that game where the real hitters study for this
Got the young boys actin' real nutty for this
Bring it down some, pimpin', when the time is right
You and the boys get together, we gon' ride tonight
I know a hitter with a hundred gettin' high tonight
We got a dime, we gon' pull him to the side tonight
So we live now, baby, so it's time to play
 doing damn lit, too big, sedate
Ain't so, man wait through, that's the way
Flush it down and all , wooh, washin' the paint
Now we gettin' that drank
To all my thugs in the club, get the bread
The five tenets of the law, get the bread
Girls shaking that thang, get' bread
Go, swinging that chain, get the bread
The DJ spinnin' nines, get the bread
Boy pushin' that pie, get the bread
Got a knot from the block, get the bread
Got the spot, we go hard, get the bread
Talkin' 'bout

I went from county jail to makin' million dollar figures
Then partnered with Wonder Boy, so the budget got bigger
Still live in the city drivin' hundred-thousand dollar cars
Conversation with the mobs, they ridin' with firearms
I'm a boss, know this, it's been that way
Like pop up before the sunrise, to get that pay
I'm making power moves, the kind you haters dream about
I make Alejandro Sosa look like Nino Brown
This ain't no minor league home boy, you're dealin' with a major
I been puttin' this work down since  made pagers
It ain't hard to get a sit down, to try to connect
Write a rhyme, produce some beats, and sign the cheques
I got a team of big fellas, when it's time to collect
I got a bank that I gotta protect, a whole city that'll break yo neck
Knock them lames that be sittin' with feds
But the real hitters gettin' their bread
To all my thugs in the club, get the bread
The five tenets of the law, get the bread
Girls shaking that thang, get' bread
Go, swinging that chain, get the bread
The DJ spinnin' nines, get the bread
Boy pushin' that pie, get the bread
Got a knot from the block, get the bread
Got the spot, we go hard, get the bread
