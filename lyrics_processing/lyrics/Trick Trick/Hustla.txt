Nigga, I started this Goon Sqwad shit
What it seem like nigga? Y'all know what it is
Do what we wanna do around here
Sup lil' nigga? Wassup?

He used to see me bendin' corners in the 6-4
Seen him at the dice game, haulin' with the hit flow
Sixteen years old, nigga got a lil' paper
Hold on lil' homie, lil' nigga, lil' paper
Asked me what the business was, told me what he's gettin'
He looked me in my eyes, what's the ticket on a chicken?
I told him "thirty-two", he asked me "How much for a half?"
I told him I ain't do 'em like that and this nigga laughed
Told him "I tell you what", you cash out one, I'ma throw you two
And when you all through, cash out three, you all hood with me
Tossed the bag on the floor, he ready to do some more
We counted out the dough, he ready to do four
Lil' nigga laughed and say "Ready to ride", I'ma give you five
And it's gon' be right, say you want some money lil' nigga
Well let's see 

Hustler, hustler, hustler, hustler, hustler, hustler, hustler, hustler

Okay, now I've been gettin' money for a long time
Even with a dick in shit, nigga I was on mine
Never paid late, always stay G
It's how this lil' nigga here, he remind me of me
He appreciate the hustle, he-a go get it
I ain't bullshittin' this motherfucker cold with it
I asked him what he do and "Shit, I slang at these bitches"
Only thing I love, homie bangin' these bitches
Whatever the fuck he doin', I said "Fuck it, I'm gon' let him"
Now he gettin' fifty a week, at twenty-seven
And he don't give a fuck, he'll do it for thirty-three
Six dollars a piece, this lil' nigga's a beast
I ain't mad at it, nigga got his balls strapped on
They lost it for a minute, now they all back on
Whole team back strong, but somethin' ain't right
One of his soldiers got hit last night, he a motherfuckin' hustler

Hustler, hustler, hustler, hustler, hustler, hustler, hustler, hustler

No matter how many this nigga paying
I'm neglected to mention that I ain't school him to the game
I figured I ain't have to, he had a clientele
He want what I'm sellin', I figured shit, might as well
That's a bad move, shit, it was my fault
So what if the nigga that I been servin' get caught
And he decide to talk, and give 'em my name
Gotta do what I do to niggas, I'm thankful to the game
Now I'm paranoid, he keepin' it one hunnid
Tellin' me everything, I'm thinking this nigga frontin'
What they ask a lil' homie? Did they ask 'em 'bout me?
He looked me in my eyes, "Hell naw, OG"
"Lil' homie don't know that I been gettin' this from you"
I believe you lil' nigga, so this what you gotta do
Go and bail him out, ask him what was said
But before he get to answer put a bullet in his head
You a motherfuckin' hustler
Hustler, hustler, hustler, hustler, hustler, hustler, hustler, hustler

Y'all niggas better open your eyes
Start schoolin' these lil' niggas
They don't know the game
Anybody could bang (What!)
(Goon Sqwad, and ya don't stop)
(Trick Trick, and ya don't stop)

(Shoutout to DOC, nigga , what up?)
