That's some fucked up shit man
I'm fightin' for my motherfuckin' life
I'm sittin' here all this time over some dumb shit?
These bitches out to kill me, they ain't playin'!
I ain't talkin 'bout no niggas either
I'm talkin 'bout the motherfuckion' pigs
Fuck it, let's go!

What would be the reason for me to jump out of the whip
And run up on a motherfucker with a 50-round clip
And cake him in the back of his head four or five times?
His brain matter was scattered, plastered out of his mind
His sister got on the stand and told a mouthful of lies
And steady, pointin' the finger but wouldn't look me in my eyes
Not once, did this bitch even acknowledge the real
I was in my truck at the corner when her brother was killed
Nowhere near the scene, I'm clean far as murder's concerned
But they after me, I see, with a warrant to serve
A conviction never the issue, y'all guineas after some tissue
She after me for the money; her nose snottin' and runny
This overreactin' hoodrat, lacin' 'em with them lies
Assistant to district attorney chargin', I'm facin' life
I done turned myself in, with no reason to run
I ain't murdered a damn thing so fuck yo' M-1!
You might also like
You can't get me, tryin' to convict me
But you can't stick me with an M-1
Prosecution against me, cops wanna clip me
Judge is against me, I'm the wrong one
You can't get me, tryin' to convict me
But you can't stick me with an M-1
Prosecution against me, cops wanna clip me
Judge is against me, I'm the wrong one

This got to be the most, sickenin' situation
Fightin' this murder case and
Gotta be strong and patient, look at the time I'm facin'
Get it outta my face, don't even think of offerin' me a cop
A hundred and eighty years? You got to stop!
You got to be shamed for wastin' my time
How 'bout pinnin' this on the person who committed this crime?
I was taught, swallow yo' own medicine when you grown
When people can't get along, leave 'em the fuck alone
Speakin' of people that thinkin' that people is evil
He stuck around for the fight and shot him in broad daylight
Can't imagine havin' to do life for somethin' I've seen
But I'm only bein' rebellious if you know what I mean
I ain't speakin' to y'all dawg, that's all they finna get
Tryin' to get me to give a statement, give me a cigarette!
Give me fifty ki's of raw for tellin' you what I saw
A hundred dollars a gram then murder won't give a damn
You can't get me, tryin' to convict me
But you can't stick me with an M-1
Prosecution against me, cops wanna clip me
Judge is against me, I'm the wrong one
You can't get me, tryin' to convict me
But you can't stick me with an M-1
Prosecution against me, cops wanna clip me
Judge is against me, I'm the wrong one

Now I'm 'bout sick of this motherfuckin' ridiculous shit that I keep on hearin'
All these notions and these motherfuckin' hearings
The prosecution's an idiot, my record's enticin'
It wasn't no better than the court appointed
I'm tryin to prove a point
That I wasn't the shooter and the photographs of the victim that you keep showin'
Ain't movin' and I ain't know him
What happened I get a check from rappin' and
Not from bein' a cop
I never liked you motherfucker so stop!
Fuck the police, and yo' investigation
His way of intimidation was more like a presentation of lies
I see it off in his eyes, he after my soul
But I'll never give it away to you bitches and hoes
Instead of killin' these niggas we need to look at the bigger picture
Get to pop us a month or just maybe order some coffins
And bury us motherfuckers, that's puttin' in work
Just to bust 'em in the back of the head, dick in the dirt
C'mon!
You can't get me, tryin to convict me
But you can't stick me with an M-1
Prosecution against me, cops wanna clip me
Judge is against me, I'm the wrong one
You can't get me, tryin to convict me
But you can't stick me with an M-1
Prosecution against me, cops wanna clip me
Judge is against me, I'm the wrong one

Still ain't got nothin for you bitches!
I beat that shit bitch
