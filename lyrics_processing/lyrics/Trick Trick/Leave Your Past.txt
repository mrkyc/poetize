Come on
This one for all my people
I wish I could wipe your tears away
I feel your pain, just know that I feel your pain

It's time for me to send a little message to my people
I pray for us all to be delivered from this evil
And if you will god, take away the pain
The pressure and the strain on brotha's trapped up in the game
Kind of an 'ard request  from a thug who already escaped
And put the sack down right before I went upstate
I got a whole lot of nerve don't I
But I be blessed for the speaking of your word won't I?
See that the point that I'm tryna prove
Don't be distorted by your past when you tryna move
Keep your eyes on the prize above
Don't let the past be  eyes of love
Believe that he understands
Believe that he got the power to deliver every man
Telling you not to think about it is easy for me to say
Only if I could wipe your tears away
But I feel ya

Don't think about it, don't think about it, don't think about it (Serious) (Ooh)
Don't think about it, don't think about it, don't think about it

It's kind of hard when the ten and eleven'o'clock news come on
The stories that break first is what's really goin' on
Like what could've possessed this man to do what he did Purchased a 12 gauge pump and shot four of his kids
His own flesh and blood, if that ain't enough
He set a fire to his house to burn his kids up
But one of his kids survived and after all that
She asked the EMS where her father was at
Lord, it hurts so bad inside
I feel the pain of the mother of the kids that died
God, I don't deserve the right to ask you why
If you could comfort all they souls at the times they cry
Come on, this little lady need a hug from us
It's time for us to show these babies all this love from us
I hear the cries for a father figure, baby we here and when you call I be there to wipe away your tears, come on

Don't think about it, don't think about it, don't think about it (Ooh)
Don't think about it, don't think about it, don't think about it
Don't think about it, don't think about it, don't think about it
Don't think about it (Ooh), don't think about it, don't think about it
Don't think about it, don't think about it, don't think about it
Don't think about it, don't think about it (Ooh), don't think about it
Don't think about it, don't think about it, don't think about it
Don't think about it, don't think about it, don't think about it (Ooh) Don't think about it, don't think about it, don't think about it
