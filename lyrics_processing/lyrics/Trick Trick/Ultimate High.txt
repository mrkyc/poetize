Tryna live a life without hatred
Tryna live a life without pain
My understandin' wouldn't see sunshine if it wasn't for a lil' rain
I love this nigga in the mirror
So I'm like, "Who am I to change?"
Probably try to kill him if he would resemble anybody else in this game
You just can't trust these bitches
Can't trust niggas either
So I keep my guard up, remain hard
Layin' back, puffin' this reefer
Not if my God done gave me a job
"Doin' what?" Bein' a leader
Make an non-believer a believer
Watch him 'cause the preacher's a deceiver
Leadin' by example, so give him passes
Done had to squish it to a halt
He'dn't get a sample, beat his ass
Fuck him and it's all my fault
Charged with felonious assault
It got me thinkin', "What if I done walked?"
I hit him up, leave him dead
No turnin' cheeks, like Jesus said
Give him a bond 'cause he's a threat
Tryin' to take me out of there for good
I'd still be gone if I had to pledge
Just bein' loyal to the hood
It ain't gotta never be said
Real nigga shit, long 'cause it's understood
Livin' by the code of respect
I can go on anybody's hood
And I'm good

Strip split to the white meat
Stomped to the ground, fuckin' clown

Found out what your kids worth
Think shit bad? Nah, better give 'em his money
Or we'll get burnt
Same boss with or without the bag
And I'm stickin' to the script, when the shit get real
With or without the mag (On beef, on real niggas)
Gon' head run through that if you a boss
Then you should have knew that gettin' lost is a

And put your whole team in the dirt

Call your babe, tell her you gon' run my cut
No more  fuck I say, fucked up
So you just gon' run off with a nigga bag (You lay the fuck down)
