It's all good
Keep that warm string goin'

Hey lady, how you doin', I ain't seen you in a while
Just though I'd send you a word or two, to try to get you to smile
Maybe brighten up your day to take your mind off the pain
Try to weather the storm, lady, sunshine or rain
It ain't easy, I know, you got a kid and all
Last time I seen him he was a baby, now he big and tall
I hope that I'm helpin' out, with the cash that I'm sendin'
And I hope the kid like the last gift that I sent him for Christmas
As for me, I'm good, I been workin' a lot
A workaholic, but the girl I'm datin', she want me to stop
But I can't, you can remember what happened befo'?
I went broke in my last home, and she didn't want me no mo'
Anyways, I was thinking, and I will make a suggestion
That when you talk to the kid, and get to askin' him questions
Be grown up, don't talk to him like he a kid
You don't want him to make the same mistakes that his daddy did
Okay?

I never shoulda let you out my sight
Never shoulda let you out my life
Never shoulda let you go nowhere
Never shoulda let you go nowhere
Never shoulda let you out my sight
Never shoulda let you out my life
Never shoulda let you go nowhere
I never shoulda let you go

I'll be damned, the mail just rang and guess what I got
A lady from you lady, and believe it or not
I knew that you was in pain, I can feel it inside
Try to be strong and I promise you that you will be back
Stop poppin' them pills for real, that ain't the way
Do like me when I think about it, I hit my knees and pray
Slow down, you gotta kid, you young and beautiful
I'm sick and tired of viewin' the young at funerals
You feel that? I know you do, we did it togetha
And the kids who live and dream, we got to live it fo'eva
Don't stop now, better said and hard to do
Don't say that you'd rather be dead, and that it's hard for you
It was hard for me too, I thought my soul was gone
I get teary-eyed just listenin' to a soulful song
I can't ever destroy my life, 'cause it's a thing of the past
Just relax, I be to see you in a week and a half (Trick Trick)

I never shoulda let you out my sight
Never shoulda let you out my life
Never shoulda let you go nowhere
Never shoulda let you go nowhere
Never shoulda let you out my sight
Never shoulda let you out my life
Never shoulda let you go nowhere
I never shoulda let you go
I started this song just writin' a letter
Reaching out to yo baby mama, man, hopin' she's better
She tried to blow her life on x and cane, but I ain't got let her
And if she start to slip away again, then I'ma go get her
She fucked up! She never expected that you would leave
And I told her you snuck away, when I told you give me them keys
You hard headed. I turned for a second, you left
I'm so pissed at you, I wish I could talk you to death
'Cause you drove off, wouldn't even answer my phone call
You shoulda just waited a minute, dammit you done dawg
You just missed an old lady, you almost caught
But the couple you did kill, they left a son and a daughter
They wanted to prosecute you, but you died in the van
I shoulda snatched the fuckin' car keys outta you hands
And maybe, just maybe, you will still be alive
Don't you die!

I never shoulda let you out my sight
Never shoulda let you out my life
Never shoulda let you go nowhere
Never shoulda let you go nowhere
Never shoulda let you out my sight
Never shoulda let you out my life
Never shoulda let you go nowhere
