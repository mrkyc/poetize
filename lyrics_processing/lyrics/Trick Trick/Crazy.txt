Hm, crazy
They say everybody deserve a shot at love
That's bullshit
You live your entire life as a miserable bitch
Then you deserve to die a miserable bitch
Fuck you
Good lookin' Em
Jump fast, Trick Trick

 to the waitress  me
I frequent the joint so she  in me
 more than an average customer
I trusted her to bring to me what I ordered
Even a bottle of water
Met her in a  grabbed my 
All these legs and thighs that catched my eyes
I got my mind on this five foot one
1-23, I lead her home to go out to see
Her ride the beat without the poles
She don't serve for free
She out for dope
The 's clean and respectable
But     you
But the way she came, whenever I call or wave my hand
You gotta understand
This  right here, had me gone
I knew one day I'd drive her home
The day then came when she sat with me
It was a Saturday, the club was empty
V.I.P. room, all alone
32  (Damn!)
I know she , she can't drive
Big old , 
Take us home, I can't lie
I wanna bone, but I'm to high
Not that I would take advantage of her
'Cause I got patience and a plannin' for her
Sunday morning, she left my crib
She had to leave to get home to the kids
She rolled with me, spent the night
So why would I believe otherwise

I won't let them hate me
She  a baby
She callin' the police
I won't let them take me
She knew I would

She  signature
I swear she ain't write that
The way she was 
The way she could play me
 I'm patiently waiting
She  to pay me
I thought it would 
Despite what you 
That woman is crazy

I like the fact that she laid with me
She said she had somethin' to say to me
So much for the layout,  much for the plans
To my surprise, she had a man
Told me they're was on their way to breakin' up
So the vision of me and her wakin' up
After making love, was far from there
The night was young, we laid in the bed
She had to leave to get home with him
Aggravated when I  alone with him
On the phone with him
 touched  but she's sucking on my lollipop (Damn!)
Can you believe this shit? (What?)
I am leaving this
'Cause I can't see her leaving him (Oh, hell no)
It's been six months
And all me and her, whatever we did was fuck
And that's whats up
I got me one, but not the one that I'm speaking of
I'm out for love, but not with her
I've found me one that get me what I'm dreaming of
I told it all out front of her 
She told me no, she needed mo' time (What?)
I came and  this  yet
She keeps seducing me, calling for sex
Starting to  with a men at home
When all she did was trip when she had my phone
Like: "Who's that? Who's this?"
Well, who is she to  another bitch? (What?)
I couldn't take another step further with (That's right)
This ignorance, she had to go
I told her to leave, she told me no
I forced her out, then slammed to door
I won't let them hate me
She  a baby
She callin' the police
I won't let them take me
She knew I would 
 she was like that
She  signature
I swear she ain't write that
The way she was 
The way she could play me
 I'm patiently waiting
She  to pay me
I thought it would 
Despite what you 
That woman is crazy

So whatever this is, it had to stop
I knew for sure that she called the cops (What?)
They came to the door with a "Knock! Knock! Knock!"
I thought it was her man, so I cocked my Glock
Y'all know me I asked for 
Damn police, you wouldn't believe what this men told me
Told me he loved to see me go
When all he had was a 
Slammed my door, now I'm pissed of about that ho
But that didn't take the cake or change the flight
Thief in the middle of the night
This last  Benz
Stole a sim-card and called my friends
Took a picture of 
With a note attached: "What you gon' do now?"
Sought me out with my brand new chick
She rode upon me: "Is that your bitch?"
Told me she wanted to kill herself
Eat a shotgun and and kill herself
I 
Grabbed the .45 from out the stash
If she chase me then that's her ass
You can't catch me in my car too fast
Hold my , text my phone
Now I'm hurt, bitch told the feds that I got 
Called my lawyer, checked it out
The alpha  outside your house
Now this gon' get you most of all
She asked the judge, she 
On my behave, she spoke up
It's 7 A.M. and I woke up
(*Inhales*)
Heh?!
