I'm in the back of the pussy club, mind on mine

Ten racks to the waitress, change all that

I don't pay a bitch to fuck, I pay a bitch to leave
She ain't fuck with me before, but tonight she gon' believe
She used to fuck with niggas with a trick up her sleeve
I got a trick for you bitch, get your motherfuckin' knees
Drop that ass on the floor, hit that motherfuckin' pole
Bring your ass over here, this little pretty bitch cold
 on it, fuck it, bitch consider it sold
Gotta keep it on stacks, no money don't fold
Most niggas by the park, well bitch we by the club
V.I.P belongs to me, and I wanna fuck (Yeah)
Ain't nobody in here fuckin' with us
 head to the back, I got on some blue chugs
I'm rollin' with the mafia, who want it cuz?
Ain't a nigga in this club to do what we does
I don't see your lil' clique, you niggas' scrubs
Y'all still throwin' ones, we throwin' dubs

You bein' just a temporary
Envy in the game, flow coatin' in February
My bitch is mad 'cause I passed on that gettin' married
Smoke like a hippie, just blew a sick 
Teach my niggas' bosses, we gon' flood this club
If you tryna' fuck your pussy, come and fuck with some thugs
All but school proper, I get money and lay low
That's why we deep in this bitch, shake yo ass and get low
M.Staxx on back, throw on the grind to get moved on
Niggas is bitches for believin' these fake hoes
I'm 'bout my hustle, M.Staxx among the cutthroats
Pop the pussy, hoe, before your mind on my pesos
Focus on your bread, shit, I keep me a bankroll
Probably why niggas mad, in the presence they don't get thrown
Fresh as hell when you see me, keep me about me
Bitches ain't shit, you won't play me, dummy

Got four bitches on me, G nigga
We ain't gotta buy shit, it's free, nigga
GS run this bitch, see nigga

That's what it is, that's what it's gon' be, nigga
All my motherfuckin' life, been a cheat, nigga
Make it rain in this bitch, til' after three, nigga
Bitches upside down on some freak shit
And one thing is for sure is he a freak bitch
Ten steps with the ones, I'm a G, bitch
And we make it hurricane, you ain't seen shit
Now get your ass on stage and do some things, bitch
It ain't nothin', the money ain't a thing, Trick
I only fuck with them Goons, and we bang shit
I could do it all at night, it doesn't change shit
