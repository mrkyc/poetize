It's 2:30 in the morning, it ain't nothin' else to talk about
So tell me, what you wanna know?
Where you wanna go? Hey
It's 2:30 in the morning, it ain't nothin' else to talk about
So tell me, what you wanna smoke?
And where you wanna go? Hey

The light's on (Light's on), while we still here
All that day-talking, I don't care to hear
It's meaningless, though it ain't to you
All these hoes in this club, but I'ma wait for you
I got some sour diesel, and some bubblegum
A little orange in that fifty, tryna fuck with someone
I ain't into waitin', 'cause I got plenty hoes
I'm in that pearl white Bentley, on them twenty-fours
So what's the word, huh?
Tryna get into somethin'
Punk ridin' the front of the elysium
I see it all in yo eyes, you wanna give me some
You want it all in yo face, so you can see me cum
Touch it, there you go, ain't no playin' with it
I'ma get it better than your ex man hit it
Turn it over, back it up, hand full of hair
Put your back down, ass in the air

So tell me, what you wanna know?
Where you wanna go? Hey
It's 2:30 in the morning, it ain't nothin' else to talk about
So tell me, what you wanna smoke?
And where you wanna go? Hey

It's three'o'clock, ready to eat, but I don't do the diners
'round here in the D, we go to Coney Island
We in the drive-thru, she starin' at the diamonds
She see the watch and start blowin' me, perfect timin'
Her phone kept ringin', somebody's tryna find her
He gotta wait his turn, I'ma about to get behind her
She like the bitch from last night one, but this one finer
I got the 68, but she want me to sixty-nine her
I found the spots, and beat it up
She done came twice, and I ain't had to eat it up
It's like burnt rubber, when I heat it up
Snatch the mag off, bitch eatin' the semen up
Goddamn, what's yo name again? (Woo)
Bitches don't keep they mouth shut, she gon' tell her friends
They callin' her, askin' her what hotel we in
They on they motherfuckin' way, I'm finna get it in
It's 2:30 in the morning, it ain't nothin' else to talk about
So tell me, what you wanna know?
Where you wanna go? Hey
It's 2:30 in the morning, it ain't nothin' else to talk about
So tell me, what you wanna smoke?
