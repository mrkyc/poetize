She don't want a nigga with some funny cash
She want a nigga with a money bag
Dollars after dollars, keep them coming fast
4, 3, 2, 1, I'm about to blast
Blast,  let my speakers blast
Blast, put a fake nigga on blast
Blast,  the weed,  we finna blast
Blast, 3, 2, 1, I'm about to blast

I'm taking off like Nasa
Got a new bitch, and she better than my last one
Payed like a sergin, but I'm just a rapper
I spit a lot of verses, you would think I was a passter
Shawty know I'm ballen, when she see me she get azma
Never saw 
Just graduated, now she tryna get her masters
She hit me with the knowledge, I hit her with the magnom
Getting to the money, means I'm bout to blast off
A couple hundred racks, keep it in a cash vault
Lil mama make it clap, I wanna see that ass talk
How low can you go? Drop it to the asshfalt

She don't want a nigga with some funny cash
She want a nigga with a money bag
Dollars after dollars, keep them coming fast
4, 3, 2, 1, I'm about to blast
Blast,  let my speakers blast
Blast, put a fake nigga on blast
Blast,  the weed,  we finna blast
Blast, 3, 2, 1, I'm about to blast
