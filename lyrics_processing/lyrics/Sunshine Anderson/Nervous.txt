I'm so nervous
It's three O'clock in the morning
And I can't get you off my mind
First test tomorrow evening
And I'm drowning in this wine
I hope I've picked the right dress
The other outfit's on floor
I ain't got a lot of time
'Cause it's already tomorrow
Damn, I'm nervous
I'm nervous 'cause I knew from hello
That we would be more than friends
I'm nervous and I'm tripping
'Cause I just don't know where tonight will end
Nervous while seeing you
Nervous while pleasing you
Don't know what I'm gonna do
So please be good to me
'Cause baby, I'm nervous
What's going on with me?
This just ain't how I'd do
Got me sweating staying up all night
He better be nervous too
You might also likeI'm nervous
But what if he kisses me?
And those sparks that'll fly
I start feeling tingly all up in the inside
Tell him I'm nervous
I'm nervous 'cause I knew from hello
That we would be more than friends
I'm nervous and I'm tripping
'Cause I just don't know where tonight will end
Nervous while seeing you
Nervous while pleasing you
Don't know what I'm gonna do
So please be good to me
'Cause I'm nervous
Where is this going? If he's holding I'm rolling
I will make his money, do we pray on Sunday
There's so many questions, is my dress too tight?
Is my perfume smell right?
Do you love this trauma? Do you love or hate trauma?
Stressing for nothing 'cause he might not be worth it
But then again he could be the one for me
Tell him I'm nervous
I'm nervous 'cause I knew from hello
That we would be more than friends
I'm nervous and I'm tripping
'Cause I just don't know where tonight will end
Nervous while seeing you
Nervous while pleasing you
Don't know what I'm gonna do
So please be good
I'm nervous 'cause I knew from hello
That we would be more than friends
I'm nervous and I'm tripping
'Cause I just don't know where tonight will end
Nervous while seeing you
Nervous while pleasing you
Don't know what I'm gonna do
So please be good
I'm nervous
I'm nervous
