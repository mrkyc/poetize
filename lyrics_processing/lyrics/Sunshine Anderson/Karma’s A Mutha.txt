supposedly
(So in love)
So I thought
What started as paradise
Fast became nothing nice
(So many times)
Your broke my heart
You know
Just what I'm talkin' 'bout
You thought I'd be ass out
(Without you)
That I would fall
But look who is laughin' now
What goes up
(Must come down)
Just like you did go lose it all
(Karma)
Karma's a mutha
I really love her
I thought you were the one
'Til you jumped on some other
You might also likeNow you say you need me
But I don't want ya
Please lose my number
So it's no surprisin', no
Lately you've been callin' me
(Tryin' to worm)
Your way back
And I'd be like
What the hell do you want?
(You're no good and we're not havin')
None of that
You know
Just what I'm talkin' 'bout
(You don't know you're welcome now)
But you still have the nerve to call
You used to
Kick me when I was down
Funny you wanna kick in now
When you broke your spell
Lost it all
(Could it be?)
Karma's a mutha
I really love her
I thought you were the one
'Til you jumped on some other
Now you say you need me
But I don't want ya
Please lose my number
Karma's a mutha
When the table turned
And you have no choice but to let it burn
And now you wanna act right
Since you've hit rock bottom
But that's not my problem
Karma's a mutha
I really love her
I thought you were the one
'Til you jumped on some other
Now you say you need me
But I don't want ya
Please lose my number
Karma's a mutha
I really love her
I thought you were the one
'Til you jumped on some other
Now you say you need me
But I don't want ya
Please lose my number
