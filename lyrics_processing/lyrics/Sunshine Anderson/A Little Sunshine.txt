Sometime, to brighten up your day
Everybody needs a little sunshine, in your life
Sometimes, if it's only but a ray
There are days when we all feel like
We are lost in a maze, nothing's going our way
It's just one of those days
Can I get a witness, oh now
At some point we all need something
Or someone to come through with a kind word or two
Something so small can make all the difference
In the world, that's why
Everybody needs a little sunshine, in your life
Sometime, to brighten up your day
Everybody needs a little sunshine, in your life
Sometimes, if it's only but a ray
Have you ever just needed a hug
Or a pat on your back, feels so good to be loved
Something so small can make all the difference
In the world,ooh
Everybody needs a little sunshine, in your life
Sometime, to brighten up your day
Everybody needs a little sunshine, in your life
Sometimes, if it's only but a ray
Every now and then when the clouds move in
They're somewhat overbearing
But before you know, the sun is in control
And into your eyes it's staring
Everybody needs a little sunshine, in your life
Sometime,to brighten up your day
Everybody needs a little sunshine, in your life
Sometimes, if it's only but a ray
