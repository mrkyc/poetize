Oh oh oh yeahhhh
Ohhhhhhhh
If you think
You can just leave
Out on me
You come & go
Just as you please
You believe
You got another thing coming
Ain't no running from me
What you heard
You better be scared
I'ma get what i deserved
And thats my worth
And thats revenge
Yea life's a bitch
But that's what happens
When your a snitch
Why are you acting like nothing ever happened?
You know that you was wrong
So since you wanna be tough
Let's see who's bad
When your made to go alone
With the flow
Thought we were friends
Through thick and thin
But you turned me in
And left me for broke
Now your gonna learn the true meaning
Of being left out in the cold
You might also likeAin't no way out of this one
No forgiving what you've done
I could never see
You turning your back on me
No more wool over my eyes
Now that i've come to realise
Your stupid
So you just have to be dealt with
What was i thinking
I actually trusted
Everything you did
Everything you said
Then you started letting people get in your head
Get in your ear
To the point where
You don't care about lil' old me no more
Step over me as if i was dead on the floor
But it's cool to hell with you
It's your loss
And i just can't understand why...
Why are you acting like nothing ever happened?
You know that you was wrong
So since you wanna be tough
Let's see who's bad
When your made to go alone
With the flow
Thought we were friends
Through thick and thin
But you turned me in
And left me for broke
Now your gonna learn the true meaning
