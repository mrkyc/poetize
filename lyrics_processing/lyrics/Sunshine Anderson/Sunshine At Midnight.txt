Ahhh Ahhh Ahh oh Yeah This Life This Life

Its Been a struggle tho your still my Life Line tha lightz went out realized I was outta Time
Oooh why'd it have to hurt like that state of confusion I can't go bak to what my life used to
Be emotions they go up and down tha hataz are runnin' wild dont wanna eat juss can't sleep
Dont wanna leave tha house oh im missin' sunny dayz i dont wanna feel this way livin my life
In a daze it feels like midnight

I need to get away from this life so much hurt and tha pain that i feel inside but i know that i can't
Turn bak tha time( I can't turn bak time) So i need to move ahead with my life(my life) try and change
Tha dayz that i can't fix wishin on tha starz to get away from everyday that feels like Midnight

Ooh Why'd it have to go this far why'd it have to cut so raw why did this happen when i Know I
Played my part did u eva feel tha same or was it just all a game now im hurt so deep i wish i had
Some peace oooh what am i gonna do now couldn't go wrong this way but im loosin out and i can't
Take that rout(no) ooh what am i gonna do now couldn't it go wrong this way baby leave me out i dont
Deserve this

I need to get away from this life so much hurt and tha pain that i feel inside but i know that i can't
Turn bak tha time( I can't turn bak time) So i need to move ahead with my life(my life) try and change
Tha dayz that i can't fix wishin on tha starz to get away from everyday that feels like Midnight
