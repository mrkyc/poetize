You ain't gotta lie to kick it
Ooh, where should I begin?
I talked to a girl that said she's your friend
And that she thinks she knows you a little bit more than me
And by saying that, I asked her what did she mean
(You gave your word)
Said you didn't even have no kids
(I learned from her)
You got 3 but 2 for sure is his
(You told me)
Your job was investment real estate
(I found out)
You got caught up moving weight upstate
So then I guess that makes you a convicted felon
So tell me what the hell houses you buying and selling
Why do you lie? You asked me to trust in you
But I don't
(You ain't gotta lie to kick it)
You ain't gotta lie, no you don't, no you don't
To kick it with me
(You ain't gotta lie to kick it)
But you do it anyway now
You might also likeYou said you and your baby mama was over
Now I learned you still paying the note on the Rover
I coulda sworn you said you live by yourself
But ya live-in girl exposed your world
(I bet you wonder)
How the hell she got my number
(You called from the home phone)
And forgot to block my number
Why do you lie when you expect me to trust in you?
You ain't gotta lie, no you don't, no you don't
(You ain't gotta lie to kick it)
To kick it with me
Sayin' any and everything
You thought I wouldn't find out 'bout your other ways
(You ain't gotta lie to kick it)
Now you can't even look me in the face
I never trust you again
'Cause you's a liar
And you make it bad for a good man
(You ain't gotta lie to kick it)
Matter of fact I never wanna see you again, no
And I done told all my friends
And they told they friends
(You ain't gotta lie to kick it)
And now everybody knows what I know
You so bogus
(You ain't gotta lie to kick it)
