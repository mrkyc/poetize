They're unable to keep your mind intrigued from moving too fast
What you need is someone who can provide
You a challenge that's keeping you alive
One hundred percent woman, yes, indeed
You say that's what you need
So I'm thinking, yeah

Since I'm who you want (I'm who you want) and need in your life  (You need me, yeah)
Then we should do lunch (Yeah, yeah, oh, or dinner) or dinner sometime (Oh, oh)

I can see that you're full of confidence
One of many things I like about you
Your body language is speaking loud and clear
And it's music to my ear, yeah
So I'm thinking

Since I'm who you want (I'm who want, baby, oh, yeah) and need in your life (You need me, yeah)
Then we should do lunch (Then we should do lunch) or dinner sometime (I'm thinking)
Since I'm who you want (I'm who you want) and need in your life (Then, baby, let's go out)
Then we should do lunch (For some lunch or dinner) or dinner sometime (Ooh)

Since I'm feeling you
And you're feeling me
Then I'm willing to take the chance

Then we should do lunch (We should do lunch or dinner sometime) or dinner sometime (Sometime, sometime, sometime, yeah, yeah)
Since I'm who you want (I'm who you want, baby) and need in your life (You need me, you know you do, yeah)
