Falling for it
Do you know your family don't approve?
But you can't help yourself
Your heart is in it
Even though you know it's bad for you
And so does all your friends
But you're ignoring them
And wish they'd let you live your life
But they see what you don't
'Cause you're so gone, you won't
Take time and open your eyes
There's a little hard love in most of us
It makes us do crazy things
Sometimes even cause a scene
In the name of this thing called love
The joy heads up in the air
If you've been there
Tell me what you know about
(Showin' up at your mans house)
Bangin' on the front door
You might also likeLike the police
(Open up, you know it's me)
What you takin' so long for?
You say, he better not be in there
(Laid up with some chick and hell)
I swear, I'll set it off today
And once he let's you in
(No one's there but you and him)
But you still lookin' at him sideways
(I tell you)
There's a little hard love in most of us
It makes us do crazy things
Sometimes even cause a scene
In the name of this thing called love
The joy heads up in the air
If you've been there
I've had my share of love
(Changin' ways)
Wish it was easier, I wish it was
(Painless)
But it's not and I learned a lot
About myself and how much I can take
(I tell you)
There's a little hard love in most of us
It makes us do crazy things
Sometimes even cause a scene
In the name of this thing called love
The joy heads up in the air
If you've been there
There's a little hard love in most of us
It makes us do crazy things
Sometimes even cause a scene
In the name of this thing called love
The joy heads up in the air
