I want my life back, I want my life back
So many promises you made to me
Said you would always love me faithfully
Had me off telling, thinking this was it
But you turn right 'round and did the opposite
You had jumped off, I was in denial
So decided before we walked down the aisle
Said, "I do" but now I feel you don't
Care nothing for you so I'm moving on
I gave you my best years, took your last name
But the way you've been treating me, it's a crying shame
Don't know how much worse things could get
But I'm over you and I through with this
I want my life back, I want my life back
I want my life back, I want my life back
In the midst of all our craziness
We had high notes and conceived a kiss
I was hoping things would turn around
But when I needed you the most you were nowhere to be found
You might also likeDidn't know a thing but later I would find
You knocked up a jail bar around the same time
That explains why you were so in my aid
It's all I can do to not agitate
I gave you my best years, took your last name
But the way you've been treating me, it's a crying shame
Don't know how much worse things could get
But I'm over you and I through with this
I want my life back, I want my life back
I want my life back, I want my life back
Not saying I was perfect by no means at all
But I was loyal to a fall
These confrontations with you, lots of occasions
Gotta stop, I'll just start all over
I want my life back, I want my life back
I want my life back, I want my life back
I gave you my best years, took your last name
But the way you've been treating me, it's a crying shame
Don't know how much worse things could get
But I'm over you and I through with this
I got my life back, I got my life back
I got my life back, I got my life back
I gave you my best years
But the way you've been treating me
Don't know how much worse
But I'm over you
I got my life back, I got my life back
