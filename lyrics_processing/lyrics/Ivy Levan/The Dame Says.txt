I said trick or treat
They said that I got to keep it sweet
But I'mma do my thang
You got a problem, you can kiss this ring

Now you act like you got some class
But do you know how to back that ass up?
Watch me drop the hurt
Make money money, make money money work
(Make money money, make money money work)
(Make money work)

All eyes on me (all eyes on me)
All eyes on me
I'mma give you what you need
I'mma give you what you need
All eyes on me (all eyes on me)
All eyes on me
I'mma give you what you need
'Cause if you like it rough
You'll love it when I give it to you raw

You see, I got my cake
And I fuckin' ate it too (okay)
I'mma grade-A steak
You ain't nothin' but dog food (woof!)
You might also like
Now you act like you got some class
But do you know how to back that ass up?
Watch me drop the hurt
Make money money, make money money work
(Make money money, make money money work)
(Make money work)

All eyes on me (all eyes on me)
All eyes on me
I'mma give you what you need
I'mma give you what you need
All eyes on me (all eyes on me)
All eyes on me
I'mma give you what you need
'Cause if you like it rough
You'll love it when I give it to you raw
