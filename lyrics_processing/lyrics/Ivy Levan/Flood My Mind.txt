You keep floodin' my mind
Floodin' my mind
Floodin' my mind
You keep floodin' my mind
Floodin' my mind
Floodin' my mind

Met you on a Sunday in September
Lauryn Hill was on the stereo
I was chillin', mindin' my own business
And you came in and shook me to the core

With those eyes, with those lips
I can't lie, can't resist
I think about it
I need to slow down, down, down, 'cause

You keep floodin' my mind
Floodin' my mind
Floodin' my mind
You keep floodin' my mind
All of the time
I want the world to be alive
Body on mine, moving in time
You keep floodin' my mind
Floodin' my mind
Floodin' my mind
You might also like
You keep floodin' my mind
Floodin' my mind
Floodin' my mind
You keep floodin' my mind
Floodin' my mind
Floodin' my mind

Drivin' back to Hollywood 
Traffic keeps on slowin' to a crawl
I just keep pretendin' like it's nothin'
But I can't think of nothin' else at all

You keep floodin' my mind
Floodin' my mind
Floodin' my mind
You keep floodin' my mind
All of the time
I want the world to be alive
Body on mine, moving in time
You keep floodin' my mind
Floodin' my mind
Floodin' my mind
With those eyes, with those lips
I can't lie, can't resist
I think about it
I need to slow down, down, down

You keep floodin' my mind
Floodin' my mind
Floodin' my mind
You keep floodin' my mind
All of the time
I want the world to be alive
Body on mine, moving in time
You keep floodin' my mind
Floodin' my mind
Floodin' my mind

You keep floodin' my mind
Floodin' my mind
Floodin' my mind
You keep floodin' my mind
Floodin' my mind
Floodin' my mind
You keep floodin' my mind
Floodin' my mind
Floodin' my mind
You keep floodin' my mind
Floodin' my mind
