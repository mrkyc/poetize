I'm gonna give it like, uh, 'til you're blue in the face
And not gonna stop 'til they put me away
I'm like, damn, how bad can I be?
'Cause I'm gonna be guilty to the fifth degree

I'm no good (No good, no good, no good)
Ain't got nothing on this, no good
I'm no good (No good, no good, no good)
Ain't got nothing on this, no good

Your love, your love
Makes me no good, I'm just no good
Your love, your love
Makes me no good, I'm just no good
And that's all that I ever wanna be
And that's all that I ever wanna be
Your love, your love
Makes me no good, I'm just no good

Now watch me like, uh, caught in my trance
Do as I say, now dance monkey, dance
Wrapped around my finger like a wedding ring
Round tomorrow morning, it ain't no thing
You might also like
I'm no good (No good, no good, no good)
Ain't got nothing on this, no good
I'm no good (No good, no good, no good)
Ain't got nothing on this, no good

Your love, your love
Makes me no good, I'm just no good
Your love, your love
Makes me no good, I'm just no good
And that's all that I ever wanna be
And that's all that I ever wanna be
Your love, your love
Makes me no good, I'm just no good

You spend the night with me and what do you get?
A lover, a fighter, but deeper in debt
Hey, daddy, don't call me 'cause I ain't home
Momma is a rolling stone

Your love, your love
Makes me no good, I'm just no good
Your love, your love
Makes me no good, I'm just no good
And that's all that I ever wanna be
And that's all that I ever wanna be
Your love, your love
