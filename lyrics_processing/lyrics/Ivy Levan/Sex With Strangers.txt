Seeing you only when it's dark
Together but yet so far apart
Giving me only just a taste, so is it a waste?
Want to relieve and satisfy
I'm fading into your double life
Taunted by love, slowly haunts me inside

And I'm not the one to give up easily
But this time I hesitate
The thrill of it all, should I put faith in you
Or walk away?

Loving you is like sex with strangers
All the passion but too much danger
Feeling the heat, but will this fire end up burning out?
Hiding beneath the covers
When are we gonna be more than lovers?
Secretly in deep

Gasping for air I cannot breathe
Wanting for more I can't receive
Using my body as the bait, but is it too late?
Is this just how it's gonna be?
Hanging loosely by your strings
Slipping underneath your spell
But never falling
You might also like
It's never enough, I wanna be the one
Not some kind of luxury
It's hard to believe it, you say you feel the same
But you don't even know me

Loving you is like sex with strangers
All the passion but too much danger
Feeling the heat, but will this fire end up burning out?
Hiding beneath the covers
When are we gonna be more than lovers?
Secretly in deep

So it's the end of our rendezvous
With the sheets turned down and my mind's confused
Think you're gonna get a show? No encore, it's time to go
There's a reason why you keep coming back
You could never give me up that's a matter of fact
Why can't you just say it's so? Leave me when I say it's so

Loving you is like sex with strangers
All the passion but too much danger
Feeling the heat
Hiding beneath the covers
When are we gonna be more than lovers?
Secretly in deep
Loving you is like sex with strangers
All the passion but too much danger
But will this fire end up burning out?
Hiding beneath the covers
When are we gonna be more than lovers?
