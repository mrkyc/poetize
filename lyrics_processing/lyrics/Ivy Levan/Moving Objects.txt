Might seem closer
Might seem closer
New kind of temptation, a stimulation
I've been lovin' on the run
Take notes if you must dear
But don't interfere
'cause it's a new world kinda fun
If you can't stand the heat though
Get out tha' kitchen
'Cause I've only just begun
I'm moving faster than a jet plane
And now I'm itchin'
Like a trigger on a gun
Hey engineer, take me on a train
Take me on a train
I hear it blowing
My wrecker's never still
Moving objects might seem closer
(might seem closer)
But everybody's doing it, doing it, doing it
More than just intuitive, did you hear
My sex is like a chemical, chemical, chemical
Moving like a freight train
Please stay clear
You might also likeNot a warning, second-guessing
Is it what you want, or what you fear?
What you gonna do with it?
Take what you can get while I'm here
One soul for admission and take your ticket
Lose your baggage you don't need it now
It's a healthy addiction, did you feel it
I'll bring in someone to show you how
Little Momma on a mission
With no restriction
'cause a hit is what it's all about
And just like I predicted
You're so inflicted
Yeah, I'm the rush you can't live without
Hey engineer, take me on a train
Take me on a train
I hear it blowing
My wrecker's never still
Moving objects might seem closer
(might seem closer)
Everybody's doing it, doing it, doing it
More than just intuitive, did you hear
My sex is like a chemical, chemical, chemical
Moving like a freight train
Please stay clear
Not a warning, second-guessing
Is it what you want, or what you fear?
What you gonna do with it?
Take what you can get while I'm here
Nothing too moving as I've crossed it off this track
I'm feeling more insane, the rails will lead me back
We're heading for a place, you lead, you know we're near
Beyond the air stopping
We're leaving on a freight train
Please stay clear
Everybody's doing it, doing it, doing it
More than just intuitive, did you hear
My sex is like a chemical, chemical, chemical
Moving like a freight train
Please stay clear
Not a warning, second-guessing
Is it what you want, or what you fear?
What you gonna do with it?
Take what you can get while I'm here
