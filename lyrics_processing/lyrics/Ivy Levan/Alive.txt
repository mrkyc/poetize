Take me back to the moment
Take me back to the start
Take me back to the days we lost our time
We were drivin' and drinkin'
Takin' pills in a Lincoln
Missed it if you were blinkin' on the night

Don't believe a word they say
You never listened anyway
No way

You won't take me alive
You won't take me alive
You won't take me alive 'cause I've got so much more to live for
You won't take me alive
You won't take me alive
You won't take me alive 'cause I've got so much more to live for

You were open and broken
All the pain you were holdin'
Like a light when it flickers all night long
You go on like the ocean
Forever and golden
Now I'm nothing but empty and now you're gone
You might also like
Don't believe a word they say
You never listened anyway
No way

You won't take me alive
You won't take me alive
You won't take me alive 'cause I've got so much more to live for
You won't take me alive
You won't take me alive
You won't take me alive 'cause I've got so much more to live for

All the lonely days and wasted nights
Or the best of times and the worst of fights
I live for, oh I live for

I don't wanna let go
But I gotta let go
Now it's time for you to go home
I don't wanna let go (I don't wanna let go)
But I gotta let go (I gotta let go)
Now it's time for you to go home
You won't take me alive
You won't take me alive
You won't take me alive 'cause I've got so much more to live for (To live, to live, to live for)
You won't take me alive
You won't take me alive
You won't take me alive 'cause I've got so much more to live for (To live, to live, to live for)

All the lonely days and wasted nights
Or the best of times and the worst of fights
I live for, oh I live for
All the lonely days and wasted nights
Or the best of times and the worst of fights
I live for (I live for), oh I live for (I live for)

I don't wanna let go
But I gotta let go
