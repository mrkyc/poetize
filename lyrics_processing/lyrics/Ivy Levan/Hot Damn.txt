I got that real good, good
And you know it don't come cheap
A pretty penny, a pretty penny, a pretty penny
You like what you see
You want it real bad, bad
But you still, you still want more
Looking at me, looking at me
They'll be knocking down my door

Hot damn
These fools try to strip me from my paper
Damn, these fools won't leave me alone
Hot damn
These fools try to strip me from my paper
Damn, these fools won't leave me alone
From New York to LA
And every single day I said
Hot damn
These fools try to strip me from my paper
Damn, these fools won't leave me, leave me alone

You follow me like dogs
And I can't, can't get no sleep
A pretty penny, a pretty penny, a pretty penny
You just want a piece
'Cause I got that real good, good
And you just keep wanting more
Looking at me, looking at me
What the hell you looking for?
You might also like
Hot damn
These fools try to strip me from my paper
Damn, these fools won't leave me alone
Hot damn
These fools try to strip me from my paper
Damn, these fools won't leave me alone
From New York to LA
And every single day I said
Hot damn
These fools try to strip me from my paper
Damn, these fools won't leave me, leave me alone

Who turnt that temperature up?
It's hot enough to cook an egg in a frying pan
Don't you turn that temperature up
Oh, it's hot enough to make me crazy like the Son of Sam
Hot damn
