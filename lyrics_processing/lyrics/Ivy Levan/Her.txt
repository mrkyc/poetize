I've been losin' sleep
Stayin' up all night
'Cause I'm in too deep
Comparin' myself to a body type
And I get too drunk
Tryna drown my mind
Make myself so sick
Thinkin' 'bout how she get her dress so tight

What's she got that I don't have ?
Cried all the tears I had
Watch me as I fade to black

Baby, you've gone too far
You know you broke my heart
Why you keep on runnin' back to her ?
Back to her ?
I don't know what to say
Baby, I'm not okay
Why you keep on runnin' back to her
Back to her?
Lalalala lalalala
La la la la la
La la la la la
Back to her
Lalalala lalalala
La la la la la
La la la la la

Now I feel so numb
Picture you with her
So is she the one?
Boy I never knew that I could feel so hurt

What's she got that I don't have?
Cried all the tears I had
Watch me as I fade to black

Baby, you've gone too far
You know you broke my heart
Why you keep on runnin' back to her ?
Back to her ?
I don't know what to say
Baby, I'm not okay
Why you keep on runnin' back to her ?
Back to her?
