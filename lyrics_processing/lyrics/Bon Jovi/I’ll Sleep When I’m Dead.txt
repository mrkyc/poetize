Seven days of Saturday is all that I need
Got no use for Sunday because I don't rest in peace
Don't need no Mondays or the rest of the week
I spend a lot of time in bed but baby I don't like to sleep, no

I won't lie to you
I'm never going to cry to you
I'll probably drive you wild eight days a week

Until I'm six feet under, baby I don't need a bed
Gonna live while I'm alive, I'll sleep when I'm dead
Until they roll me over and lay my bones to rest
Gonna live while I'm alive, I'll sleep when I'm dead

So you're looking for some action, I got got everything you need
Better keep your motor running, because I was built for speed
This ain't no slumber party, got no time for catching z's
If they say that that ain't healthy, well then living's a disease

We're never going to die baby
Come on let me drive you crazy
We'll make every night another New Year's Eve

Until I'm six feet under, baby I don't need a bed
Gonna live while I'm alive, I'll sleep when I'm dead
Until they roll me over and lay my bones to rest
Gonns live while I'm alive, I'll sleep when I'm dead
Sleep when I'm dead, sleep when I'm dead
Gonna live while I'm alive, I'll sleep when I'm dead


Seven days of Saturday is all that I need
Got no use for Sunday, because I don't rest in peace
I was born to live, you know I wasn't born to die
But if they party down in heaven, I'll be sure to be on time

Until I'm six feet under, baby I don't need a bed
Gonna  live while I'm alive, I'll sleep when I'm dead
Until they roll me over and lay my bones to rest
Gonna  live while I'm alive, I'll sleep when I'm dead

I feel like I'm exploding, going out of my head
Gonna  live while I'm alive, I'll sleep when I'm dead
Until I'm six feet under and they lay my bones to rest
Gonna  live while I'm alive, I'll sleep when I'm dead
Sleep when I'm dead, sleep when I'm dead
