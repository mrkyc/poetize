Hey, man, I'm alive
I'm taking each day and night at a time
I'm feeling like a Monday, but someday I'll be Saturday night

Hey my name is Jim, where did I go wrong?
My life's a bargain basement and all the good shit's gone
Just can't hold a job, where do I belong?
Been sleeping in my car, my dreams moved on
My name is Billie Jean, my love is bought and sold
I'm only sixteen, I feel a hundred years old
My foster daddy went, took my innocence away
The street life ain't much better, but at least I'm getting paid

And Tuesday just might go my way
Can't get worse than yesterday
Thursdays, Fridays ain't been kind
But somehow I'll survive

Hey, man, I'm alive!
I'm taking each day and night at a time
Yeah I'm down, but I know I'll get by
Hey hey hey hey, man, gotta live my life
Like I ain't got nothing but this roll of the dice
I'm feeling like a Monday, but someday I'll be Saturday night

Now I can't say my name or tell you where I am
I want to blow myself away, don't know if I can
I wish that I could be in some other time and place
With someone else's soul, someone else's face

And Tuesday just might go my way
Can't get worse than yesterday
Thursdays, Fridays ain't been kind
But somehow I'll survive

Hey, man, I'm alive!
I'm taking each day and night at a time
Yeah I'm down, but I know I'll get by
Hey hey hey hey, man, I gotta live my life
I'm gonna pick up all the pieces and what's left of my pride
I'm feeling like a Monday, but someday I'll be Saturday night

Someday I'll be Saturday night
I'll be back on my feet, I'll be doing all right
It may not be tomorrow, baby, that's okay
I ain't going down, I'm gonna find a way!
Hey, man, I'm alive!
I'm taking each day and night at a time
Yeah I'm down, but I know I'll get by
Hey hey hey hey, man, gotta live my life
Like I ain't got nothing but this roll of the dice
