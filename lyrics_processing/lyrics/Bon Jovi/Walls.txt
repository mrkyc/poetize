My mama told me
When I was younger
You better speak up
Don't be a number
My daddy told me
When there was thunder
Go be the lightning
Don't run for cover

Who's gonna help the helpless
Sometimes we're all alone
These days we're all just looking
For a place that we call home

Now we can't climb over
And you can't go 'round
Build them up
We'll tear them down
Brick by brick
Gonna watch them fall
Build more bridges
And tear down walls

Are the mountains that we climb
These walls
Are the great divide
Brick by brick
Gonna watch them fall
Build more bridges
Tear down walls

The space between us
Is getting wider
We need the spark to
Light the fire
Show me the promise
Give me some feeling
There's too much hurting
We need some healing

Who's gonna help the helpless
Sometimes we're all alone
These days we're one step closer
To that place that we call home

Now we can't climb over
And you can't go 'round
Build them up
We'll tear them down
Brick by brick
Gonna watch them fall
Build more bridges
And tear down walls
These walls
Are the mountains that we climb
These walls
Are the great divide
Brick by brick
Gonna watch them fall
Build more bridges
Tear down these walls

I remember when the world was smaller
And we both felt 10 feet taller

Now we can't climb over
And you can't go 'round
Build them up
We'll tear them down
Brick by brick
Gonna watch them fall
Build more bridges
And tear down walls
These walls
Are the mountains that we climb
These walls
Are the great divide
Brick by brick
Gonna watch them fall
Build more bridges
Tear down these walls
