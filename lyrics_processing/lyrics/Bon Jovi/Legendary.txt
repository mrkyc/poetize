(Oh, oh, oh, oh)

Who are you and who am I
To think that we could ever fly?
It don't pay to even try
Work, get paid, and just get by
Sons of sons, bricks on bricks
What's broken you don't try to fix
'Round here, there ain't no whys and ifs
You don't pick up what you can't lift

I raise my hands up to the sky
Don't need more to tell me I'm alive

Got what I want 'cause I got what I need
Got a fistful of friends that'll stand up for me
Right where I am is where I wanna be
Friday night comes around like a song
"Sweet Caroline," and we all sing along
Got my brown-eyed girl, and she believes in me
Legendary

I know this town like the back of my hand
Every crack in the sidewalk tells me who I am
"Live and you love" is the law of the land
These are our dreams, that's where we stand

Raise my hands up to the sky
Don't need more to tell me I'm alive

Got what I want 'cause I got what I need
Got a fistful of friends that'll stand up for me
Right where I am is where I wanna be
Friday night comes around like a song
"Sweet Caroline," and we all sing along
Got my brown-eyed girl, and she believes in me
Legendary

(Oh, oh, oh, oh)

Who are you and who am I

Got what I want 'cause I got what I need
Got a fistful of friends that'll stand up for me

"Sweet Caroline," and we all sing along
