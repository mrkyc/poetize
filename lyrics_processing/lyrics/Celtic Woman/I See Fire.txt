Keep careful watch of my brothers' souls
And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke
Keep watching over Durin's sons
If this is to end in fire
Then we should all burn together
Watch the flames climb high
Into the night
Calling out, father, oh
Stand by and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on
The mountain side, oh
And if we should die tonight
Then we should all die together
Watch the flames climb high
For the last time
Calling out, father, oh
Prepare as we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on
The mountain side
Desolation comes upon the sky

Inside the mountain
I see fire
Burning the trees
And I see fire
Hollowing souls
And I see fire
Blood in the breeze
And I hope that you remember me
Oh, should my people fall
Then surely I'll do the same
Confined in mountain halls
We got too close to the flame
Calling out, father, oh
Hold fast and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on
The mountain side
Desolation comes upon the sky
Now I see fire
Inside the mountain
I see fire
Burning the trees
And I see fire
Hollowing souls
I see fire
Blood in the breeze
And I hope that you remember me
And if the night is burning
I will cover my eyes
For if the dark returns
Then my brothers will die
And as the sky is falling down
It crashed into this lonely town
And with that shadow on the ground
I hear my people screaming out
I see fire
Inside the mountain
I see fire
Burning the trees
And I see fire
Hollowing souls
I see fire
Blood in the breeze
I see fire, fire
And I see fire, fire
And I see fire, fire
