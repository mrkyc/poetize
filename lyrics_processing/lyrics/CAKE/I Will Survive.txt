At first I was afraid, I was petrified
I kept thinking I could never live without you by my side
But then I spent so many nights just thinkin' how you'd done me wrong
I grew strong, I learned how to get along
And so you're back from outer space
I just walked in to find you here without that look upon your face
I should have changed my fucking lock, I would have made you leave your key
If I'd have known for just one second you'd be back to bother me

Oh, now, go, walk out the door
Just turn around, now, you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to break me with desire?
Did you think I'd crumble? Did you think I'd lay down and die?

Oh, not I, I will survive, yeah
As a-long as I know how to love, I know I'll be alive
I've got all my life to live, I've got all my love to give
I will survive, I will survive, yeah, yeah


It took all the strength I had just not to fall apart
I'm trying hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart
And I spent oh so many nights just feeling sorry for myself
I used to cry, but now I hold my head up high
And you see me with somebody new
I'm not that stupid little person still in love with you
And so you thought you'd just drop by and you expect me to be free
But now I'm savin' all my lovin' for someone who's lovin' me

Just turn around, now, you're not welcome, anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to break me with desire?
Did you think I'd crumble? Did you think I'd lay down and die?

Oh, not I, I will survive, yeah

I've got all my life to live, I've got all my love to give
