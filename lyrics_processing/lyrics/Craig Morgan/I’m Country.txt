You gotta dodge the pots an' pans on the floor when it rains
There's a ten-point buck on my livin' room wall:
A squirrel and two ducks are hangin' in the hall
That hole in my yard is a barbecue pit:
A couple times a year, we'll throw a hog in it
There's a four-wheel drive parked in my driveway:
I'm a proud and active member of the NRA
Hey, I'm country: I was born and raised in it
I'm country, that's my kind of livin'
White beans, collard greens, sweet tea, chicken and dumplin's
Well, I get up every mornin' when the rooster crows:
I stay out some nights until the cows come home
I'm dog-runnin', deer-huntin', fish-catchin', cow-tippin'
Hay-balin', pea-pickin' country
Well, there's my Mama in the rockin' chair by my screen door:
The red, white, and blue hangs off of my front porch
There's my darlin' in the garden pickin' black eyed peas:
Kids are bouncin' up and down on the trampoline
My truck cost less than my champion 'coon dog:
My neck is painted red, by the Grace of God
My kids say: "Please, Sir, Thank you and Ma'am."
I ain't what I ain't, but I am what I am

Ha, ha, ha, ha
Yeah, I guarantee you, I'm country
