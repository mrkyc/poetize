I'm the son of a third-generation farmer
I've been married ten years to a farmer's daughter

I'm a God-fearin', hardworkin' combine driver
Hoggin' up the road with my p-p-p-p-plower
Chug a lug a luggin' five miles an hour
On my International Harvester

Uh, three miles of cars layin' on their horns
Fallin' on deaf ears of corn
Lined up behind me like a big parade
Off late to work, road rage jerks
Shoutin' obscene words
Flippin' me the bird
Well, you may be on a state-paved road
But that blacktop runs through my payload
Excuse me for tryin' to do my job
But this here ain't been no bumper crop
If you don't like the way I'ma drivin'
Get back on the interstate
Otherwise, sit tight and be nice
And quit your honkin' at me that way

I've been married ten years to a farmer's daughter
I've got two boys in the county 4-H
I'm a lifetime sponsor of the FFA, ayy
That's what I make
I make a lot of hay for a little pay
But I'm proud to say

I'm a God-fearin', hardworkin' combine driver
Hoggin' up the road with my p-p-p-p-plower
Chug a lug a luggin' five miles an hour
On my International Harvester

Well I know you got your own deadlines
But cussin' at me won't save you no time, hoss
Now, this big-wheeled wide load ain't goin' any faster
So just smile and wave and tip your hat
To the man up on the tractor
