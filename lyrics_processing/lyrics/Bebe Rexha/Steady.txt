Steady

Something 'bout a rapper, something 'bout a singer
Trying to make a feeling last longer than a linger
They knew exactly what they were getting into
He was always sippin', she was somethin' different
Together they were living, never ever overthinkin'
Falling in madly, runnin' from their issues
And he's not to blame, and she's not to blame
Drinking the love that they pour in the cup 'cause it eases the pain
And he'll never change, she'll never change
Breathin' the hope that they find in the smoke 'cause it eases the pain (Oh)

We only love when our eyes get heavy
We only laugh, we only dance when the high gets steady
Yeah, we only touch when our hands get messy
We only laugh, only attach when the high gets steady

When the high gets steady
Hi-high gets steady
When the high gets steady
When the high gets steady
Hi-high gets steady
When the high gets steady (It's Tory)

I pulled up on you last night
I didn't know what to do last night
Pulling out, you put me to my knees, baby
I was on the Dior, you in jeans baby, keep it G, baby

You know what it is, whenever I come through the cake up
And you say you get this feelin' with me, baby, on the real
I get the same feelin' witcha, I know how you feel
So keep it G with me
'Cause this one I'mma do with ya, I'ma keep it 78 plus 22 with ya
You know what it is when I pull up in that new, new thang
Looking for a new thang, oh

We only love when our eyes get heavy
We only laugh, we only dance when the high gets steady
Yeah, we only touch when our hands get messy
We only laugh, only attach when the high gets steady

When the high gets steady
Hi-high gets steady
When the high gets steady
When the high gets steady
Hi-high gets steady
When the high gets steady
We only love when our eyes get heavy
We only laugh, we only dance when the high gets steady
Yeah, we only touch when our heads get messy
We only laugh, only attach when the high gets steady
When the high gets steady
Hi-high gets steady
Wish we could love
