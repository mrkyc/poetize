You hit me up at 3 A.M. on a Friday night
Say you ain't feelin' right
You need to see my face right now, you ain't over it
Just wanna talk a bit

If you wanna talk, let's talk about the way you left me
Left me with a text, so cold, yeah
Even though I'd die to see you
I don't trust myself to meet you
'Cause we both know that your kiss is a gateway drug
Once you get one, it's never enough
Your kiss is a gateway drug
Once you get one, it's never enough

'Cause kissin' leads to touchin'
Leads to lovin', leads to fuckin'
Leads to someone always seems to get hurt (Yeah)
Kissin' leads to touchin'
Leads to lovin', leads to fuckin'
Leads to everything mean nothin'
Your kiss is a gateway drug

You said that you loved me
If you really loved me, why'd you leave me like that?
Why'd you go around and talk shit like that behind my back?
Love don't do shit like that, ooh
