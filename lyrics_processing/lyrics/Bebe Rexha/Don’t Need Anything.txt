I've seen better days, better towns
My love is all used up and it brings me down
Can't seem to get it right, this crazy life
Broken promises, now realize

Whoo, it's just me, myself and I
Solo ride until I die
'Cause I got me for life
Whoo, I don't need a hand to hold
Even when the night is cold
I got that fire in my soul

I don't need anything to get me through the night
Except the beat that's in my heart
Yeah, it's keeping me alive
I don't need anything to make me satisfied
'Cause the music does me good and it gets me every time

Taste that bitter taste and wash it down
I'm in a better place, a little sweeter now
I'm done with compromise, it's overdue
Take my memories, take my tears
I'm so over you
You might also like
Whoo, it's just me, myself and I
Solo ride until I die
'Cause I got me for life
Whoo, I don't need a hand to hold
Even when the night is cold
I got that fire in my soul

I don't need anything to get me through the night
Except the beat that's in my heart
Yeah, it's keeping me alive
I don't need anything to make me satisfied
'Cause the music does me good and it gets me every time
