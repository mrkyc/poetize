If I was on death row, you would be my last meal
Show you how my neck broke, tryna make you catch feels
I feel a connection, just want you to say it's real
Say it's real
If I was on death row, you would be my last call
Show you how my heart stopped, tryna make you free fall
I feel a connection, just want you to say it's real
Say it's real
Say it's real, real, real, real

I know that it's crazy to cry for you
I know that it's crazy to die for you
But I'll do it tonight, night
If you do it too
And I know that it's crazy to cry for you
Sayin' shit, like, "Baby, I'd die for you"
But I'll do it tonight, night
If you die, die, die for me too
Die for me too

If I was on death row, you would be my last word
Show you how you shook me, right down to my last nerve
I feel so electric, just want you to say it's real
Say it's real
'Cause I'd like to know you and I'd like to show you
That it's real (That it's real)
Say it's real (Say it's real)
Is it real, real?
You might also like
I know that it's crazy to cry for you
I know that it's crazy to die for you
But I'll do it tonight, night
If you do it too
And I know that it's crazy to cry for you
Saying shit, like, "Baby, I'd die for you"
But I'll do it tonight, night
If you die, die, die for me too

Sha, la, la, la-la-la-la
Sha, la, la, la-la-la-la

I know that it's crazy to cry for you
I know that it's crazy to die for you
But I'll do it tonight, night
