We can get low, oh, na-na-na
Let me be your friend, baby, let me in
Tell you no lies, oh, na-na-na
We can get lost, oh, na-na-na
Take it all off, oh, na-na-na
Let me be your friend, baby, let me in
Give it to me all, oh, na-na-na

Tell me what you're thinkin', always overthinkin'
I just wanna love you, I got you
Don't have to be so guarded, let's finish what we started
It's all I ever wanted
