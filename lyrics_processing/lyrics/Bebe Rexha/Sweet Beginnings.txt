(Huh, ha, huh, ha)
(Huh, ha, huh, ha)

It's like bed bugs in a five-star hotel
First date, pretty face, but he's dumb as hell
He's dumb as hell
It's like choking on a LifeSaver
Like a firehouse burnin' to the ground (Yeah, yeah)
Burnin' to the ground

And I keep runnin', runnin' circles, circles
Tryna understand why the dreams I die for are now killin' me
And I keep runnin', runnin' circles, circles
Tryna figure out why this life is not what I thought it'd be, yeah

I wanna go back to the sweet beginnings
When I was young and full of innocence
I wanna go back to complete surrender of you
The sweet beginnings, oh
(Huh, ha, huh, ha)
(Huh, ha, huh, ha)

It's like you're allergic to your medication
Meant to make you better, but it makes you worse
It makes you worse
It's like dyin' in your own living room
Like a U-Haul following behind a hearse
We all turn to dirt

And I keep runnin', runnin' circles, circles
Tryna understand why this life is not what I thought it'd be
Yeah, yeah

I wanna go back to the sweet beginnings
When I was young and full of innocence
I wanna go back to complete surrender of you
The sweet beginnings of
(Oh, huh, ha, huh, ha)
The sweet beginning of (Huh, ha, huh, ha)
The sweet beginnings of
(Boy have not ported it back)
So let go of your heart
(Boy have not ported it back)
So let go of your heart
I wanna go back to the sweet beginnings
When I was young and full of innocence
I wanna go back to complete surrender of you
The sweet beginnings, oh

I wanna go back to the sweet beginnings
When I was young and full of innocence
I wanna go back to complete surrender of you
The sweet beginnings, oh
The sweet beginnings, oh
The sweet beginnings, oh
