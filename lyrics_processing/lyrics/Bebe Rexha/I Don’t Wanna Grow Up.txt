(Ha, ha, ha)

I don't wanna grow up, no
I don't wanna grow up
I'm still naive
Young, wild and free, oh, uh, ohh (Ohh)
I don't wanna hear it, no
I don't wanna feel it
Don't lecture me
Just let me be, oh, uh, ohh (Ohh)

If love is a lie, it's the most beautiful lie that you've ever been told
'Cause nothin'
Nothin' makes me feel like you do
Even though I see through you
If love is a lie, then please don't ever tell me the truth (Come on, come on, come on)
Cause nothin'
Nothin' makes me feel like you do
Even though I see through you

I don't wanna live it, no
I don't wanna live it
Reality
Just not for me, oh, ohh, ohh, yeah
Like a cheap tequila
Makes you sick but it tastes so good
So good on your lips
Take a sip
Just one more hit
I love it when you do it, when you do it like this (Come on, come on, come on)
Oh, when you do it, when you do it like this (Come on, come on, come on)
