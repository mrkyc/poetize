Sittin' in a parked car
We don't even fight no more
We don't even touch no more
Used to be my best friend
We don't even laugh no more
Barely even talk no more

You wanna hold my hand and then you won't
You say you love me then you don't
You keep me runnin' and runnin' around

If I'm not all you need, then just set me free
I'm down on my knees
If you're not the one for me, then just let me be
I'm begging you, please
I'm praying for closed doors and open windows
I'll follow where the wind blows, don't be scared to leave
If I'm not all you need, then just set me free
I'm down on my knees tonight

We used to go out on dates
Now you don't wanna go no place
Feels like we're stuck in one place
I wish I could read your mind
Instead I gotta read your eyes
Oh, how they tell me lies
You might also like
You wanna hold my hand and then you won't
You say you love me then you don't
You keep me runnin' and runnin' around

If I'm not all you need, then just set me free
I'm down on my knees
If you're not the one for me, then just let me be
I'm begging you, please
I'm praying for closed doors and open windows
I'll follow where the wind blows, don't be scared to leave
If I'm not all you need, then just set me free
I'm down on my knees tonight

Set, set, set me free
Let, let, let me be
I'm down, down on my knees
(I'm down, down on my knees)
Set, set, set me free
Let, let, let me be
I'm down, down on my knees

If I'm not all you need, then just set me free
I'm down on my knees
If you're not the one for me, then just let me be
I'm begging you, please
I'm praying for closed doors and open windows
I'll follow where the wind blows, don't be scared to leave
If I'm not all you need, then just set me free
