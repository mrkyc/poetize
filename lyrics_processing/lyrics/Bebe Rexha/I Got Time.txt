I just wanna do what I want (what I want, yeah)
I don't want no one to tell me nothing (nothing, no)
I just wanna live how I want (how I want, woo)
I don't wanna hear nothing about it
'Cause I got time, I got time
I'll go and get high if I wanna get high
Love who I want
'Cause I got time, I got time
'Cause I got time, I got time, I got time
And right now I ain't worried 'bout none
Yeah, right now I ain't worried 'bout none
Yeah, right now I ain't worried 'bout none

I do what I wanna
I run up the commas
We mix marijuana with a cup of liquor
All my friends are monsters
I don't need no sponsors
Spend this money now 'cause I might not be here tomorrow
I mix-match designers
I'm a fashion statement
I'm elevator high, but I started on the pavement
Yeah, I came from nothing
Turned it into something
Look into the mirror, I tell myself, "I'm fucking awesome."

Everybody in my crew, we fucking amazing

Hundred thousand for the charm
