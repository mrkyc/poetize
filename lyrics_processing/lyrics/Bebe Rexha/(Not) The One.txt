Oh my god, here we go
I drank a little too much again
Now I'm stuck in your bed again
Oh my god, I'm too close, oh
But this feeling is so damn good
Guess I'm loving it more than I should

I know I should leave
But when you are next to me, deep asleep
Your skin on my skin
Can't help the way I feel, ooh
But you cannot know, there's no place I'd rather be, honestly
When I hold you close to me

I want you to
To love me, to love me, to love me, but don't fall in love
To hold me, to hold me, to hold me, but not for too long
I want you to love me, to love me, but don't fall in love
'Cause I'm not the one to love

Oh my god, here we are
I'm fallin' deeper into this mess
Yeah, I know I shouldn't get undressed
We both know this ain't right
It's a little too dangerous, this little thing between us
You might also like
I know I should leave
But when you are next to me, half asleep
Your skin on my skin
Can't help the way I feel, ooh
But you cannot know, there's no place I'd rather be, honestly
When I hold you close to me

I want you to
To love me, to love me, to love me, but don't fall in love
To hold me, to hold me, to hold me, but not for too long
I want you to love me, to love me, but don't fall in love
'Cause I'm not the one to love

I want you to
I want you to
I want you to
I know I should leave
But when you are next to me, half asleep
Your skin on my skin

I want you to
To love me, to love me, to love me, but don't fall in love
To hold me, to hold me, to hold me, but not for too long
I want you to love me, to love me, but don't fall in love
'Cause I'm not the one to love
I want you to
To love me, to love me, to love me
I want you to
To hold me, to hold me, to hold me
I want you to
I want you to love me, to love me, but don't fall in love
