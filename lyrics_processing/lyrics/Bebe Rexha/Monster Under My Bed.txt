In the darkest of my nights
A little spark begun to shine
Woke up and I realized
Imperfection is divine

So this creepy heart of mine
That's tiptoeing on the line
I know it will be just fine
And I know I

I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're trying to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
Well that's nothing (oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh)
Well that's nothing (oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh)

In a world so black and white
Out of place and out of my mind
Woke up and I realized
Imperfection is divine
