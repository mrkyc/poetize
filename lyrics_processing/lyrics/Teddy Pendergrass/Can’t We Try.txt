Come lay your head on my heart
Soon it'll be apart, stay here to the touch of morning
I'm glad we're leaving as friends
Baby, by the way, I forgot to say

Can't we try
Love was never born to say goodbye
Just another helpless fool in love is what I am
But I don't give a damn
Sorry, I forgot myself
I guess that I'm just not myself

And I know that we're not supposed to cry
Love was supposed to die
When people get to know each other
In case I don't see you again
Really wish you well, baby, this is hell

Can't we try
Love was never born to say goodbye
Touch me one more time
And make me feel that I'm alive
And if we don't survive
At least we'll have a moment here
With honest pain and tears
You might also like
Then say goodbye
Come lay your head down on my heart
The morning suddenly leads you
You know that I don't need you
We can't go back to yesterday, go away
Girl, I wished you'd stay

Can't we try
Love was never born to say goodbye
Touch me one more time
And make me feel that I'm alive
And if we don't survive
Then we will end like we began
And even though it's over
Can't we try
Let's go back to yesterday, and I
Just another helpless fool in love is what I am
But I don't give a damn
See, once before I set you free
I just got to hold you close to me
Can't we try
Love was never born to say goodbye
I want you to touch me
Touch me one more time
And make me feel that I'm alive
And if we don't survive
Then we can end like we began
And even though it's over
Can't we try
Let's go back to yesterday, and I
See, I'm just another
Just another helpless fool in, in love is what I am
But I don't give a damn
See, once before I set you free
I got to have you, I got to have you
Can't we try
