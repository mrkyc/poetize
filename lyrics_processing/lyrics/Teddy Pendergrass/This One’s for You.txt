You know I really don't think this song would ever sell
I don't think people would ever understand
You know I really don't even sing it well
Huh, I try, but somehow I just can't
Still I'll sing it every night
And I'll fight so hard just to keep it in
This one's for you
This one's for you

I've done a hundred songs
From fantasies to lies
But this one's so real for me
That I'm the one who cries
And I, sing it every night
And I'll fight so hard to hide my tears
'Cause, this one's for you, this one's for you

This one's for you wherever you are
To say that nothings been the same since we've been apart
This one's for all the love we once knew
Like everything else I have, this one
This one is for you, oh
You might also like
Yes I've got it all it seems, for all it means to me
But I sing of things that I miss, things that used to be
And I, wonder every night
If somewhere somehow you might miss me too
And Lord knows I sing, I sing just for you
I sing for you

This one's for you, wherever I go, wherever I go
Say the things I know I should have said
Things that you should know
This one's to say that all I can do, all that I can do
Is that hope that you'll hear me sing
'Cause this one, this one's for you, oh
This one's for you wherever you are, wherever you are
Say that nothing's been the same since we've been apart
This one is for you, wherever you are, wherever you are
To say that nothing's been the same since we've been apart
Ah

I just wanna say that, I hope you all don't mind
You see 'cause I love you, love you, love you, love you, love you all
And to me it's sorta special
You see you've been so good to me through the years
And yes, you've been so good to me through all the tears
And I just wanna say that, this one, is for you
Yeah, this one is for you
Oh yeah, this one is (For you)
This one is for you (For you)
