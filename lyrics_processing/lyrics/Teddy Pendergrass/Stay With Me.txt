Stay with me, stay with me
Spend just one more day with me
Maybe you can re-arrange your plans
I know there's a whole new world you found
And it's true that world you bound
But please, don't leave me standin' here
Just stranded on the ground
So won't you stay with me, stay with me?
Spend just one more day with me
I can't bear to see it end this way
If I could spend one night with you
It would last my whole life through
Of all the nights I've held you close
Tonight's the night that means the most
So stay with me

Tonight I'll show you that our love is something beautiful
I'm gonna give you all the loving you need
Tonight I'll show you that our love is something beautiful
For the rest of your life you'll never wanna be

So won't you stay with me, stay with me?
Spend just one more day with me
I just need some time to change your mind
I'm gonna make you feel much more
Than you've ever felt before
Won't let you get away form me
Tonight, you're gonna stay with me
So stay with me
You might also like
Tonight, I'll show you that our love is something beautiful
I'm gonna give you all the loving you need
Tonight, I'll show you that our love is something beautiful
For the rest of your life, you'll never wanna leave

Won't you stay with me, stay with me?
Spend just one more day with me
'Cause I can't bear to see it end this way
So won't you stay with me, stay with me?
Spend just one more day with me
'Cause I can't bear to see it end this way
So won't you stay with me, stay with me?
(My darling, stay with me, stay with me)
Spend just one more day with me
Spend just one more day with me
Of all the nights I've held you close
Tonight's the night that means the most
Stay with me, stay with me?
Spend just one more day with me
I can't bear, see it end this way
Stay with me, stay with me?
Spend just one more day with me
Of all the nights I've held you close
Tonight's the night that means the most
