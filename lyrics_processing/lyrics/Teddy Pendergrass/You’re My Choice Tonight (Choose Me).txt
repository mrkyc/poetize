Now you know we've both been through a lot today
That's why we need to just sit back
And enjoy this evening
So if you'll choose me then you're my choice tonight, mhm
Right tonight, you're my choice tonight
You really got me, yeah
Feeling right - look out, girl
Sure gon' be a heavy night

Chooser, beggar - what's your pleasure, girl?
In the evening when the day is done
Why don't you ease back, honey
And let me be the one

To hold you, just to know you, girl
There's gotta be a way
(A way, a way, a way)
All the signs we go, easy, soft and slow
So how can we say no, when

It feels so right (Oh, it feels so right, baby)
You're my choice tonight
(It's you, baby, you, you, baby)
What delight (Mmm, mmm)
Downright heaven-like
(Oh girl, take this love) Let it fly
(Oh girl) In the midnight sky
(I said you got me, baby) Feeling right (Yeah)
You're my choice tonight
(Yes, you are, yeah)

The idea sounds so good

I got a love design, made with us in mind
And it's ready to be tried (It's ready to be tried)
It's an all-night plan for love makin'
As much as we can stand, ooh girl

Feels so right (Sure feels right to me)
You're my choice tonight (It's you, you, baby, you, you, you, you, baby)
