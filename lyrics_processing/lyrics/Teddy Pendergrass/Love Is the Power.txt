It's been a long time coming
You brought my love back to life with your lovely smile baby
I searched the world over, there is no other I'd rather love than now
Since you came and brought me love
You've erased all the hurt and the pain I've known
And I'm still in need of you
Bring it back to life baby, your love is the power baby

Your love, your love
(Love is the power, this is the hour, the moment, the minute)
Your love is the power baby
(Love is the power, this is the hour, the moment, the minute)

I turned the world over, round and round again
Trying to find the one to be my angel heaven sent
And then you brightened up my life
Girl you make my whole world right, you are the one
You're my everything baby, cause when I turned to you
You knew how to love me (you love me, you love me)
You gave me my dream and my song, how I long to sing
See now I'm not so alone, I keep you living in my heart baby
I can feel it way down deep in my soul
You might also like
(Love is the power, this is the hour, the moment, the minute)
The moment
The minute
I wanna tell you about your love, oh yes I do
(Love is the power, this is the hour, the moment, the minute)
It's the moment
It's the minute
See now it's the time to give you all my loving, aw yes it is
(Love is the power, this is the hour, the moment, the minute)
It's the moment
It's the minute
And I don't mind giving you just what you need
(Love is the power, this is the hour, the moment, the minute)
No
The minute

I don't mind telling the world about how you make me feel
(Love is the power, this is the hour, the moment, the minute)
See I, I, I've searched the world over and over and over and over again
(Love is the power, this is the hour, the moment, the minute)
But I never found nobody like you
Aw, that, that can do all of the things that you do, that you do, that you do, that you do
(Love is the power, this is the hour, the moment, the minute)
Aw, aw, aw, aw baby
And every time that we make love
I can feel the chills running up and down my spine
(Love is the power, this is the hour, the moment, the minute)
Oh yes I do, I love it, I want it, I need it! Right now, right now!
(Love is the power, this is the hour, the moment, the minute)
Right now I feel the need of you
I want you baby, I need you baby
I got so many things in my mind, so many things I wanna try
(Love is the power, this is the hour, the moment, the minute)
Right now, right here, with you
You and me, me and you
(Love is the power, this is the hour, the moment, the minute)
You don't know what you do to me baby but I don't mind
(Love is the power, this is the hour, the moment, the minute)
I'll tell the whole world about this thing
