Come on and go with me
Come on over to my place

I don't feel like bein' lonely tonight
You see, I want, I want some company
And you look like you're just my type
You're the kind, you're the kind whose spirits are runnin' free
Let's take a sip of some cold, cold wine
And dance to the music nice and slow
And you won't be under any kind of pressure
You see, we'll just let, we'll just let the evenin' flow

Come on and go with me
I'd sure like that, baby
Come on over to my place
It would be so nice, it would be so good
Come on and go with me
Come on over to my place

You look like you're just bored to death
And you wanna get away
You wanna get away from this noisy crowd
Let's go where it's nice and quiet
Where there's nobody
There's nobody else around
Let's sit by a cozy lit fire
And we can be in each other's company
Now how does that sound to you?
You see, cause it sounds so good
It sounds so good to me
You might also like
Come on and go with me
Would you do that, baby?
Come on over to my place
Would you do that, baby?
Would you do that, baby?
Come on and go with me
Come on over to my place


My car's right outside
We can leave right now
That's if you're ready to go
I know you're just meeting me
You see, I'd understand it
I'd understand it if you said no
But don't you do it, baby

Come on and go with me, come on, baby
Nah, no, no
Come on over to my place
No, not tonight, no
You see it's not far from here
I believe you
Would you just take a minute and think about it?
Oh, man
Would you just think about it, think about it? Yeah
I'm thinkin' about it but I really have to say no
Come on and go with me
Come on over to my place
No, I know
You're sittin' here
You've been sittin' here for quite a long time
Yeah, I'm slightly bored, I hate bein' bored
See, I've been watchin' you
I've been doin' the same thing
I've had my eyes on you
I've been checkin' you out all night long
You look so nice and you look so sweet
Oh, thank you
Come on and go with me
That was sweet
You look like you oughta be with me
Come on, over to my place
Yeah, but what are you gonna with me? That's the problem
Seems that you feel the same way I do
I think it would pretty interesting
It seems that you need some company, too
Oh, boy
Yeah
Come on and go with me
You said your car is right out front, right out front
Come on, over to my place
And you're gonna bring me home after
But would it be all right with you?
Come on and go with me
If we left here and we went somewhere else, baby
Come on over to my place
Somewhere where it's nice and quiet, it's nice and quiet
That's nice, yeah, that sounds a little better than this place
Where we could sit down by a cozy lit fire
We could sip a little wine, work things out
Oh, yeah
Come on and go with me, work things out
Well, I cannot stay long
Come on over to my place
We got an hour, no more than that
Lady, you won't be under any kinda pressure
Please, I cannot stand pressure
I wouldn't do that, baby? No
Okay, well, would you get my coat?
See, I wouldn't do that, baby
See, I just wanna sit down
And get to know you a little better
Okay, just for a little while
I swear you look so good to me
Are you gonna pay for my drink?
Come on over to my place
