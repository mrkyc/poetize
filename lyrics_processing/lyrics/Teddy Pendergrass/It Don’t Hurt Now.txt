It used to be every night
I would cry my heart out over you
It used to be every day
I would wish you here close to me

I couldn't sleep, couldn't eat
I'd just sit at home and I'd weep
But now all that has changed
I've found someone to ease my pain

And it don't hurt now (No, not now)
Baby it don't hurt now (No, not now)
Well, there's no more sleepless nights
No more heartaches, no more fights
And it don't (Hurt now, not now)

It used to be every time
I would hear a sad song, I would die
It reminds me of when you and I
Were so much in love

I couldn't sleep, couldn't eat
I'd just sit at home and I'd weep
But now all that has changed
I've found someone to ease my pain
You might also like
(And it don't) No (Hurt now, no not now)
Trying to tell you (Baby, it don't hurt now, no, not now)
Well, there's no more sleepless nights
No more heartaches and no more fights
(And it don't hurt now) No, it don't (Not now)
Well


See, there's no more sleepless nights
No more heartaches and no more fights
Now all that has changed
I've found someone to ease my pain

(And it don't) No (Hurt now, no not now)
Trying to tell you, woman
(Baby, it don't) It don't (Hurt now) no (No, not now)
See, there's no more sleepless nights
No more heartaches and no more fights
And it don't (Hurt now) no, it don't (Not now)

Will you listen to me (Don't hurt now)
Please (Don't hurt now), please
Trying to tell you that it don't, don't (Don't hurt now)
No (Not now), no, hey-hey, no
(Don't hurt now) It don't hurt no more
(Don't hurt now) I think it's over
(Don't hurt now) I think it's over, I think it's over
(Don't hurt now) it's over between me and you
(Don't hurt now) Between me
(Don't hurt now) And you, you, you, you, you, you, baby
(Don't hurt now) Tired being alone
(Don't hurt now) Yes, I am - tired of sitting all alone
(Don't hurt now, don't hurt now)
Think I can make it, I think I
(Don't hurt now) I think I can make it without you
Think I can make it (Don't hurt now)
Think I can make it without you (Don't hurt now)
Baby, yes I can (Don't hurt now) Yes, I can
I don't need you no more (Don't hurt now)
I don't need you no more, I don't need you no more
(Don't hurt now) I don't need you no more
No no no no no no, no
I'm a grown man, yes I am
Think I can understand, yes I can
That you didn't mean me no good
And right now in my heart (Don't hurt now)
I'm so happy, I'm so happy, baby (Don't hurt now)
I don't need you no more (Don't hurt now)
I found somebody new (Don't hurt now)
Somebody can make me feel (Don't hurt now, don't hurt now)
Better than you could ever do (Don't hurt now)
