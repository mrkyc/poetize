Time to rejoice, you've been crying
(I know you have babe)
Memories do, they keep on rising
Unforget about you, I've been trying
No good for you, no need in lying

I just called to say
I still love you girl
And I want you to know it
I wouldn't want you to leave this world
Without you knowing it girl
So I'm telling you girl

I keep on dreaming while I'm sleeping
(Oh I keep seeing you late at night)
Hoping you're happy and not somewhere weeping
Don't you know I brought you
(I brought you sunshine)
When your sky was crying, yeah
You lived in my spirit when they were dying

That's why I just called to say
I still love you girl
And I want you to know that
I wouldn't want you to leave this world
Without you knowing it girl
So I'm telling you girl
You might also likeI just called to say
I still love you girl
And I want you to note
I wouldn't want you to leave this world
Without you knowing it girl, so I'm telling you girl

Keep in your heart, please reserve a place for me
Don't let them turn
Don't let them turn your love away from me child
Just write down these words, they're yours to keep
Don't you know that you
You'll always be a very special part of me

That's why I just called to say
I still love you girl
And I want you to know that
I wouldn't want you to leave this world
Without you knowing it girl
So I'm telling you girl

Time to rejoice, oh I see you've been crying
Oh yes, you have
Memories do, they keep on rising
Unforget about you, I've been trying
Oh yes I have
But I'm no good for you, no need for lying
Oh child, I keep on dreaming, oh while I'm sleeping
Hoping you're happy and not somewhere weeping
