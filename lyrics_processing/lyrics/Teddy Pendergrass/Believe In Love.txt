Believe in love
Believe in love

Don't you know that
We can't worry about the things they say
'Cause they can't change the way we feel, oh no
What we have is more than they'll ever know
'Cause what we have is oh so real, alright
I can't go a single day without you
And all the things that you do, alright
Girl, you'd make a blind man see
My eyes are open now, I want you here with me

If you believe (You believe) in love (In love), I will always be around
(I will never let you down, oh no)
If you believe in love (In love), I will never let you down
(I will always be right there)

Ever since that day I laid my eyes on you
I knew you were the one for me, ah yeah
Rarely does that lightning strike the same place twice
I'd be a fool if I ever let you leave, girl
Never in this whole wide world
Would I ever find a woman like you
You don't have to waste your time and worry
Girl, I'm here to stay, I ain't going no place
You might also like
If you believe (You believe) in love (You believe in love)
I will always be around
(I will never let you down, baby, oh no)
If you believe in love (Oh baby), I will never let you down
(I will always be right there)

Tell me, tell me don't ya...
Don't you...
Never in this whole wide world
Would I ever find a woman like you, baby
You don't have to waste your time and worry
Girl, I'm here to stay, I ain't going no place

If you believe in love (Oh, belive in me), I will always be around
If you believe in love (Always), I will never let you down (Oh yeah)
If you...

Know we've had some good times, sugar
Thought I had some times but I'll
I'll...always have those good times (You know it)
Sure 'nough had those bad times (You know it)
I'll, I'll be right there for you, baby
Oh, oh
