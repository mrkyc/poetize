Close the door
Let me give you what you've been waiting for
Baby, I got so much love to give
And I wanna give it all to you

Close the door
No need to worry no more
Let's bring this day to a pleasant end
Girl, it's me and you now

I've waited all day long
Just to hold you in my arms
And it's exactly like I thought it would be
Me loving you, and you loving me

Close the door
Let me rub your back where you say it's sore
Come on, get closer and closer, so close to me
Let's get lost in each other
Come here, baby

I've waited all day long
Just to hold you in my arms
And it's exactly like I thought it would be
Me loving you, and you loving me
You might also like
Close the door, baby
And let me blow your mind
Plenty good lovin' all through the night
And then again, and then again when the morning comes
Come here, woman

Come here baby, let me blow your mind
Let me do what I want to you
Let me do what I want to you
Let me make sweet love to you, baby, uh
Ooh baby, oh baby, so good, baby
So good, so good, so good, baby, uh
You'll do it to me, I'll do it to you
Come here, baby, lay your head next to mine
Ooh, oh, ooh, oh, aah, uh
So good, sweet woman
I like the way you make me feel
I like the way you make me feel
So good, so good, so good, so good, baby, uh
Let me do what I wanna do
All I wanna do is make love to you
Let me do what I wanna do
All I wanna do is make love to you
