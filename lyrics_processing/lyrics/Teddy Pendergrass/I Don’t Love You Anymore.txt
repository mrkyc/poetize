I don't love you anymore
It's just that simple
No, no, no, not like before
Such a shame, dirty shame

We can't work it out
No, not this time
We can't be together
We can only be friends
We gotta respect each other
You gotta reply to your lover
It could never be
It could never be like it was before
You don't know what I'm talking about

I don't love you anymore
It's just that simple
No, no, no, not like before
Such a shame, dirty shame

I'll take care of my responsibilities
I'll send you your money
Every month, you can depend on that
You better believe that you can
You might also likeBut we can't live together
This way, we'll be much better
'Cause you see, you never know
You see, you never know where I'm coming from
You see that I just got to tell ya, tell ya

I don't love you anymore
It's just that simple
You don't believe, no, baby
(No, no, no, not like before) Never like before
I just got to tell ya I don't love you anymore
We can't work it out  (No, no, no, not like before)
You see, I gotta leave, (I don't love you anymore)
But I said I'll take care (No, no, no, not like before)
Of my responsibilities
Said can't make it, can't make it
Said I try and I try and I try
Said I try  (Said I try)
I tried being your man
Tried to do everything that I can
But we can't make it, but we can't make it
We just can't make it, we just can't make it
Maybe someday when we get our heads together
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Well, we can try, baby.  (Try, baby.)
When I die  (When I die)
When I die  (When I die)
When I die  (When I die)
I just got to tell ya, tell ya that I don't love you anymore, no
No, no, oh no (No, no, no, not like before)
Oh!
(I don't love you anymore.) No, no
(No, no, no, not like before.) No, no, no, no, no, no
