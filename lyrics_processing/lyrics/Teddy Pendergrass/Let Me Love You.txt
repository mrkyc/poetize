Come on, tell me about your problems
Girl, that you think you got
'Cause I'm here to tell you to change your mind
'Cause a problem is not
'Cause any kind of problems
Girl, that you got, I'm here to chase away
If you want me to spend the night
Just ask me, I'd be more than willing to stay

Let me love you
(Let me love you, let me love you)
When you feel so sad
(Let me love you, love you) let me love you
(Let me love you)
Be the best thing you ever had
Let me love you
(Let me love you, let me love you)
It's the least that I can do
(Let me love you, love you) let me love you
(Let me love you) lay this sweet loving on you

There's no need to cry, girl
Oh, that much I had
And oh, girl, you gotta stop
You gotta stop feelin' sad (stop)
So pick yourself up, yeah (pick yourself up, girl)
Just don't start all over again
You didn't know it, girl
But before this thing happened to you
I had always been your man
You might also like
Let me love you
(Let me love you, let me love you) oh, stop feeling so bad
(Let me love you, love you) let me love you
(Let me love you)
Be the best thing you ever had
If you let me love you
Oh, let me love you, girl
Let me love you, let me love you
Let me love you
Oh, let me love you, girl (let me love you, let me love you)
Would you let me love? (Let me love you, love you)
Oh, oh, oh
Ooh, let me love you, girl
Oh, I wanna make sweet loving on you
Ooh, let me love you, girl
Oh, I know just what to do
Yeah, let me love you
I'll lay something else on you
(Love me, let me love you, ooh) come on, pick yourself up
(Love me, let me love you, ooh)
(Love me) we don't have to get serious, girl
But for now, but for now, I wanna, I wanna (let me love you)
Be your friend, love you girl (let me love you, love you)
Love you, love you, whoa (let me love you, let me love you)
Wouldn't be so bad (let me love you, love you)
If you let me love you, ooh (let me love you)
