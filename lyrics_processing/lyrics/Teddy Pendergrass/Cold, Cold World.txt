From one friend to another
It seems that something being bothering you?
If you got a minute maybe there something I can say or do
See, I realize life has it changes
Lot of changes, sometimes it seems
Things just don't go right
But there's one thing I want you to think
About as you lie on your bed tonight

When the whole world seems against you
And your whole life seems unborn
And all you ever wanted was a little peace
I can understand just how you feel
But a little bit of peace of mind
Nowadays is so hard to find
And you can't even find it in your sleep
Here's some advice that I think you should keep
And baby

Don't let this cold world get you down (Be Strong, hold on)
Don't let this cold world get you down, down, down, down
(Don't let it get you down, no)
Cold, cold world, get you down
Cold, cold world, get you down

Listen
Dry your eyes, don't cry no more
What in the world do you think that a friend is for?
See, there's always something that we can do, me and you
So when things don't always go your way
You've got to prepare yourself each and every day
For the things that life will put you through
I'm telling you, will you listen to me

Don't let this cold world get you down
(When times are hard and friends are few)
Don't let this cold world get you down, down, down
(Don't let it get the best of you, don't let it get the best of you)
Cold, cold world, (Don't do it) get you down
Cold, cold world, get you down

I know the road sometimes seems rough
And the going gets a little tough
But hold on, hold on
I wonder whatever happened to, oh baby
The happy face that I once knew
You can't let nothing, you can't let nothing
Nothing ever bother you, and oh, don't do it
Cold, cold world get you down (Don't let)
Cold, cold world get you down (Hold on)
Cold, cold world get you down (Be strong)
Cold, cold world get you down

Hold on be strong
I know to some folks life comes easy
For others life comes hard
Some folks to keep on trying while others just get tired
Hold on
Don't let this cold, cold world get you down
Don't let this cold, cold world get you down
Don't let this cold, cold world get you down
I need to share the things that I've learned
Don't let this cold, cold world get you down
I don't wanna see nobody else get burned
Don't let this cold, cold world get you down
