The more I get, the more I want
The more I get it, the more I want
The more I get, the more I want from you, baby

Give me habit, I just can't kick (Well)
'Cause it's your love I'm so happy with
There's no other, I can't compare
'Cause when I want your love, you're always there
You always give me what I want without knowing it
You always give me what I need when I need it (When I need it)
I don't ever want our love to end
'Cause I want that good thing over and over again

The more I get, the more I want (Oh, yeah)
The more I get, the more I want
The more I get, the more I want from you, baby (Come on)
I want from you, baby

Too much of anything ain't good for the soul
If you got too much, you might just lose control (That's what they say)
Every time I get it I just want more
'Cause each time I get it, that thing gets better
You always give me what I want when I want it
You always give me what I need when I need it
I don't want you to take your love and go
That's why I ain't ashamed to let you go (I gotta tell you)
