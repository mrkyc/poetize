Oh baby, you know I hate to beg
And I really hate to rush you, girl
We've been knowin' each other for so long
And I really think it's time to let go, baby
Oh baby, don't you feel my heart?
It's missing some excitement, and you're the missing part
You're the missing part
That can heal my lonely nights
You're the missing part
That makes my day so bright
Can we be lovers?

Can we be lovers?
Can we be lovers?
You're the only one I need in my life
Can we be lovers?
Can we be lovers?
Can we be lovers?

Can't you feel my love, it's calling you (It's calling you)
To a romantic rendezvous (Rendezvous)
I believe every heart wants to feel real love
I don't think true love is a mystery, it's right here for you

Please be careful, baby, how you talk to me
'Cause I have a fragile heart and it's broken easily
And if it's broken I may never love again
And it will be so sad, sweet darling
To live without my friend

Can't you feel my love, hey, it's calling you, baby
To a romantic rendezvous (Rendezvous)
Well, each and every heart wants to feel real, real love
I want you to know that my love is here for you
See let me in your heart
You're the only one I want
In my life, in my life
In my life, in my life tonight
