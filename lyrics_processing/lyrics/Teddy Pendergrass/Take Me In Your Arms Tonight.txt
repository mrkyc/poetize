I have got something to tell you
But it's more, more than words can say
What I'm feeling, words could never express it, oh, oh, oh
Nothing like I would if I just could
Spend a few moments with you, oh

My baby, take me in your arms tonight
Hold me tight, now baby
Got to have your love tonight
Do it right, now baby (Oh)
Take me in your arms tonight (Hee, hee)

We, we got something between us
And it feels, it feels so good to me
It's getting stronger, but I keep getting weaker
I know that you can feel it too
Just by the things that you do, woah

My baby, take me in your arms tonight
Hold me tight, now baby (Yeah)
Got to have your love tonight
(Do it right) Do it right, now baby
Take me in your arms tonight (Oh, oh, oh-oh)
Hold me tight, now baby
Take me in your arms tonight
You might also like
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh

It's getting stronger
Getting weaker
I'm still getting weaker
Oh, yeah, yeah
Take me
I'm gonna take you
Oh, take me


Oh, hey, hey
Ooh, hoo

My baby (Yeah), take me in your arms
Hold me tight, now baby
Got to have your love tonight (Do it right)
Do it right, now baby (Baby)
Take me in your arms tonight (Oh, hey)
Do it right, now baby (Do it right, Do it right)
Got to have your love tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight (Oh, hey, hey)
Baby (Baby), take me in your arms tonight (Baby, oh)
Do it right, now baby (Do it right)
Got to have your love tonight

All your love
