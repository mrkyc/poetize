Look down-hearted and confused
Because lately youve been startin' to lose
Losin' out on everything, you might try to do
Bad lucks there, its got a hold on you
Dont send you money, bout to lose your home
Done lose your woman and everything you own

But the bookers gets you for every cent youve got
Walk around in a daze with your pockets bare
Got to see your woman and she ain't even there
Dont seem to give a whiz about it and all your trapped in time
The more I think about it, I think youre bout to lose your mind
Some people call it jinxed, some say it ain't my day, huh

They cut down on smokin', we have to cut down on dreamin'
Cause early one morning I got me a paper, huh
I sat down on my living room floor
Opened it up opened it up, guess, what I saw, huh?
Saw the President of the United States
The man said he was gonna give it up
Hes giving us high hopes
But he still turned around and left all us poor folks behind
They say they got another man to take his place
But I dont think they need to satisfy the human race
Bad luck, bad luck, bad luck
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
The only the thing that I got that I can hold on
Is my God, huh, my God, huh
Jesus be with me, Jesus
Give me good luck, good luck
