Be sure, my baby
That you find everything that you need in me
'Cause forever is a long, long, long, long time
Be sure, my lover
'Cause it would be a sin to be hurt in love again
You see I've lost this time, I wanna win (I wanna win)
I wanna win (I wanna win)
Oh

Just be sure of it
That you don't make a mistake
(Better be sure)
Just be sure of it
'Cause I don't want a heartbreak
(Better be sure)
Just be sure of it
Just a game of give and take
(Be sure, girl)

Be sure, my angel
It's not that I doubt you
But you see, I'm looking out for your feelings, too
Infatuation for love is no substitute
You just gotta be sure, my sweet thing
It's not so bad to apologize
Than to go through life living a lie
So whatever you do (Whatever you do)
Whatever you do (Whatever you do)
You might also like
Just be sure of it
That you don't make a mistake
(Better be sure)
Just be sure of it
'cause I don't want a heartbreak
(Better be sure)
Just be sure of it
Just a game of give and take
(Be sure, girl)

Be sure, my sweet thing
See, it's not so bad to apologize
Than to go through life living a lie
See, so whatever you do (Whatever you do)
Whatever you do (Whatever you do)
Oh

Just be sure of it
That you don't make a mistake
(Are you sure?)
Just be sure of it
'cause I don't want a heartbreak
(Are you sure?)
Just be sure of it
Just a game of give and take
(Are you sure?)
Just be sure of it
That you don't make a mistake
(Are you sure?)
Just be sure of it
'Cause I don't want a heartbreak
(Are you sure?)
Just be sure of it
Just a game of give and take
(Please be sure, my darling)
You just gotta be sure
Please be sure
Little sweet thing, be sure
Well
Make sure that you find, every, every, every
Everything that you want in me
See this time
I feel that you and I, we've got to win
And I don't wanna
I don't wanna have to start all over again

Just be sure of it
That you don't make a mistake
(Please be sure)
Just be sure of it
'Cause I don't want a heartbreak
(I'm begging you, be sure)
Just be sure of it
Just a game of give and take
(Please be sure)
Just be sure of it
That you don't make a mistake
(Hey, be sure)
Just be sure of it
'Cause I don't want a heartbreak
(Please be sure)
Just be sure of it
Just a game of give and take
(Please be sure)
Be sure
(My darling, please be sure)
You just gotta be sure
(Be sure you find)
Be sure
(Everything that you need in me)
You just gotta be sure
(Be sure I'm everything that you want a man to be)
Be sure
(Please be sure)
