Oh baby, oh baby
Mmm

I dreamed of you last night
And oh, your face was so very clear
All I could do was think about the good times
That you and I used to share
I could still remember the last time
Oh, I held you in my arms
But all those days have come and gone now
And all I seem to do is cry

It hurts (It hurts)
Remembering how things used to be
We thought our love (Our love)
Would last throughout eternity
Now it's history, baby

It should've been you, whoa
It should've been me
It woulda been all those things that life
Was meant to be
But if I had you, oh girl
This time you'd see
You would have all the love
I kept (I kept) inside (Inside) me
Well
You might also like
Have you got somebody else?
Yes, I've got somebody, too
But you know I've finally realized
No one could ever take the place of you, no
I'm not one to place the blame
Or for whatever the fault just might be
All I need is to find a little happiness
Oh, in life that will fulfill me

It's you (It's you)
It's you that means more to me
Without your love
It's nothing more than a fantasy
Baby, come back to me, whoa

It should've been you, oh girl
It should've been me
It would've been all those things that life
Was meant to be
It should've been you
It should've been me
We could've built a love so strong
But my eyes were closed and I didn't see
Oh, it should've been you, baby
It should've been me
It would've been all those things that life
Was meant to be, was meant to be, meant to be, baby
Oh, if I had you, girl
This time you'll see
This time you would have all the love
All the love, all the love I kept wrapped up inside of me, baby

You know, so much time has passed since, since you and I have been together
So much time 'til I...I don't know quite how to start
All I know is that from that day until this, you remain on my mind and in my heart
You know, it was never really clear just what went wrong
I guess that's why I had to write this song
If I knew then what I know now, I would've never let you go, no way, no how

Oh, it hurts (It hurts)
Remembering how things used to be
We thought our love could last throughout eternity
Now it's history
Oh, baby

Oh, it should've been you (It should've been you, baby)
It should've been me (Should've been me)
It could've been all those things in life (All those things in life)
That was meant to be (That was meant to be)
Oh baby
I know, I know, I know, I know it should've been you, baby
It should've been me
We could've built a love so strong
(We could've built a love so strong)
But my eyes were closed (If I had) and I didn't see
Oh, it should've been you (It should've been you, baby)
Oh, it should've been me (Should've been you and me)
Oh, it could've been all those things in life that was meant to be
That was meant to be, oh baby
(Should've been, should've been you)
Oh, I know if I had you, girl
I know this time you'll see (This time you'll see)
I'll show you, baby (I'll show you, baby)
(All the love) You could have all my love
All the love, all the love (I kept)
I kept wrapped up inside of me, oh yeah
Why don't you give me one more chance? (Why don't you?)
If you wanna be with me, take a chance with me, baby
I woke up this morning with you on my mind
(Should've been you)
Oh, baby, baby
(Should've been you)
Oh baby, come on, try it again
(Should've been you)
Let's start all over
(Should've been)
We can make it work this time
(Should've been you, should've been you)
Come on
