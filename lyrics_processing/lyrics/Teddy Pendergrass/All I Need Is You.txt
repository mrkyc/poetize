All I need is you
All I need is you, baby
All I need is you
All I want is you

Stay with me through the night
Let me hold you close 'til morning light
Lay your head on my heart
Make love to me while it's still dark

Oh, no one but you
Could make me feel the way you do
You're all that I've been praying for
'Cause the way you're loving me
I couldn't ask for anymore

All I need is you
See, you're everything that I never had
And baby, all I need is you
See, you're everything that I need so bad

I been in love once or twice
But I never found the love that's right
Until you came along (Just like a bird)
I was like a bird without a song
You might also like
Oh, no one but you
Could make me feel the way you do
You're all that I, I've been praying for
See 'cause the way you're loving me
I couldn't ask for anymore

All I need is you
See, you're everything, everything that I never had, never had
And all I need is you, you're everything
Everything that I needed so bad, baby, oh

(All I need, all I want is you)
You've been so sweet to me
(All I need, all I want is you, baby)
And there's nothing in the world that I wouldn't do
(All I need, all I want is you)
All I need is you
I can climb any mountain, I can swim any sea
(All I need, all I want is you, baby)
Just as long as you stay here with me
(All I need, all I want is you)
You see, you're everything
That a man could ever hope for, yeah
(All I need, all I want is you)
It's you, it's you, it's you, it's you, it's you
Baby, all I need is you
You're everything I need so bad
Baby, it's you, it's you
Yes, all I need is you
Good God almighty, you're everything
You're everything that I never had
I been looking for and never found it
