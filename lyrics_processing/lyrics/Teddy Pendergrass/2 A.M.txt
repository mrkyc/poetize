I've been watching your body
While the music plays so soft and smooth
You got me in a sexy mood
If you would only let me
I'll make you feel so doggone good
There's so many ways we can love
You're dancing, having so much fun, oh yeah
I don't want to disturb you now, ah no no no no
Maybe when the party's over, yes
We can find a place
Our own private space
I can be with you; I wanna be with you...

After 2 A.M. when the party's over
What I wanna do, what I wanna do
I wanna be with you
After 2 A.M. when the party's over
Tell me that it's true, tell me that you...
You wanna be with me

Kick off your shoes, let's get comfortable
I'll make this night one you won't forget, no
Now's the time to turn the lights down low
We can make it happen
Explosions of ecstasy
Flowing from me and you
You might also like
After 2 A.M. when the party's over
What I wanna do, what I wanna do
I wanna be with you
2 A.M. when the party's over
Tell me that it's true, tell me that you...
You wanna be with me
(Say you wanna be with me, baby)
After 2 A.M. when the party is over
What I wanna do, what I wanna do
I wanna be with you
(I wanna be with you, baby; yes, I do; yes, I do)

Girl, I wanna be with you
You know, I was just thinking that
Maybe after all the noise and the crowd is over
That maybe we can find a place
Our own private place where
We can make love, just you and me

After 2 A.M. when the party's over
What I wanna do, what I wanna do
I wanna be with you
2 A.M. when the party's over
Tell me that it's true, tell me that you...
You wanna be with me
(I hope you wanna be with me, baby
Surely wanna be with you, girl)
2 A.M. when the party's over
(I've been watching your body groovin'...)
I wanna be with you (...all, all, all night long)
(I've been standing in the corner...)
2 A.M. when the party's over
(I've had my eyes on you, baby)
You wanna be with me
