It's so good lovin' somebody
When somebody loves you back

To be loved and be loved in return
It's the only thing that my heart desires
Just appreciate the little things I do
Oh, you're the one who's got me inspired
Keep on liftin', liftin' me higher

So good, good lovin' somebody
When somebody loves you back
It's so good needin' somebody
When somebody needs you back

We can build a world of love, a life of joy
Make our goal each other's happiness
I will do for you anything that I can
Oh, everyday I wanna do a little more
Do a little more, just a little bit more

It's so good lovin' somebody
When somebody loves you back and that's a fact
It's so good wantin' somebody
When somebody wants you back
Said it's so good
