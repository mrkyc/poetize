This is the last time
You will ever have to cry
Dry the tears from your eyes
This is the last time
You will have to cry

Go on and cry
Get it over with
Oh, sometimes we know we have to let the tears fall
I know, I know it's hard to forget, oh baby
All the pain and misery
That we both been through
But all that matters
Is that we're together now

(This is the last time)
This is the last time
You will ever have to cry
Dry the tears from your eyes
This is the last time
(This is the last time)
You will ever have to cry
You might also like
There's one thing I want you to know
You belong to me
(You belong to me, I belong to you)
Woman, don't you know that I belong to you
Yes I do, yes I do, yes I do, come on
Take hold of my hand, oh baby, oh baby
I know that we can make this whole thing work again
Without a doubt, my love, without a doubt, my love

(This is the last time)
This is the last time
You will ever have to cry
Dry the tears from your eyes
This is the last time
(This is the last time)
You will ever have to cry
Dry the tears from your eyes

We tried to go our seperate ways
But we couldn't be satisfied alone
You are the one for me, hey hey
Yeah, yeah
This is the last time
(Sure 'nough is the last time)
You will ever have to cry
(You won't have to shed a tear no more)
Dry the tears from your eyes
This is the last time
(I'm so sorry)
You will ever have to cry
(I'm so sorry you ever had to shed a tear, my dear)
Dry the tears from your eyes
(Can you ever find it in your heart to forgve me, baby?)

Well now, here we are once again
Facing one another
You looking in my eyes and I'm looking in yours
Wondering what in the world went wrong
You know it really doesn't make a whole lot of sense
Just sitting here trying to figure out where the fault lies
Whether it was your fault whether it was mine
I guess all that really matters is that what I came here to tell you
And that is I don't think I can live my life without you
I mean, without you my days are so empty and my nights are so lonely
See, I need you so much
See, I love you so much
Oh baby
This is the last time
You will have to cry
We are to gether now
Dry the tears from your eyes
This is the last time
You will have to cry
We are to gether now
Dry the tears from your eyes
This is the last time
You will ever have to cry
Dry the tears from your eyes
This is the last time
You will have to cry
We are to gether now
Dry the tears from your eyes
This is the last time
You will have to cry
