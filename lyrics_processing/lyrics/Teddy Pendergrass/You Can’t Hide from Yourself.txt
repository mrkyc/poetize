Well
I just got to tell you that
You can't hide from yourself
Everywhere you go, there you are

The truth is a light, a light shining from within'
When you look in the mirror
Do you see a foe or a friend?
You can lie all you wanna
But one day you're gonna, gonna break down
Break down and let it all out

You see that
You can't hide from yourself, no
Everywhere you go, see, there you are
I just got to say that
You can't hide (No, no) from yourself
Everywhere you go, see, there you are

Make peace with yourself
Before you can love another
Understand who and what you are
Before you can go any further
You can lie all you wanna
But one day you're gonna, gonna break down
Break down and let it all out

You can't hide from yourself
Everywhere you go, see, there you are
