Something that you told me
Stayed in my head all night long
You wanted me to love you when you said
"Simply reach out and touch me, my love is in your hands"

Feel me, I want to feel the fire
Why do you want to play with my emotion?

And if I should lose your love
For any reason, any reason at all
Then just let my record show
I gave you all of my love, I know

Feel me (Oh, that's all you go to do), I want to feel the fire
Feel me, I want to feel the fire
I don't want to play with your emotions
Give me love and all your devotion

Feel it
I want to feel you
Feel it
You might also like
And if I should lose your love
For any one reason, any reason at all (Tell me)
Then just let my record show
I gave you all the love, I know

Feel the fire, I want to feel you, feel me
I want to feel you
Feel the fire, feel me, I want to feel you
Teddy, Teddy, Teddy, don't you dare (I wouldn't dare)
Don't you dare try to play with my emotions

I want to give you all of my love
I want to give you all of my love
Give it to me, yeah
Feel the fire, feel the fire
Feel it, feel it, feel it, don'tcha feel it?
Feel it, hee-hee, yeah, feel it, hee-hee, hee-hee
Feel it, oh, oh-oh, oh, feel it
Come on, Teddy, Teddy
I want to give you all of my love
I want to give you all of my love
I want to give you all of my, all of my, all of my
All of my, every little bit of my loving
Don't you dare, I don't believe that
You would dare to play with my emotions
You better believe it, baby
I do
Give me all of your love, baby
You got it all
Give me all of your love (You)
