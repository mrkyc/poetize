Love, I've waited all my life to find you
I've searched for you in every dream
And suddenly
You reached out to me
Oh love, I remember when I first touched you
I remember how my heart had wings
To sail upon
Tell me what went wrong

Oh love, when you were just within my reach
I was blind
To find my dreams of being free
Oh love, it's not too late for you and me
There's still time
As long as we believe
Believe in love

I thought that I could live without you
I really thought that I was strong
But now you're gone
I'm not half as strong
Oh love, I never knew how much I missed you
I never knew I had to give to you
To keep you hear
Now I need you here
You might also like
Oh love, when you were just within my reach
I was blind
To find my dreams of being free
Oh love, it's not too late for you and me
There's still time
As long as we believe
Believe in love

I never knew that life could fade away
A little bit more each day
Without you
I'm twice the fool
Oh love, believe me when I say I'm sorry
We've got to find a way to start all over
'Cause it's not over
For me and you

Love, you were just within my reach
I was blind
To find my dreams of being free
Free, is just a way to say goodbye
But I was wrong
I really need you by my side
Oh love, it's not too late for you and me
There's still time
As long as we believe
Believe in love, it's not too late for you and me
Believe in love, as long as we believe
Believe in love, it's not too late for you and me
