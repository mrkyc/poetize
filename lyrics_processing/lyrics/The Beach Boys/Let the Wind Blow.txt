Let the wind blow
Let the grass grow
But don't let her go

Don't take her out of my life
Don't take her out of my life

Let the moon glow
(Let the moon glow, oh-oh-oh)
On the fallen snow
(Let the moon glow on the fallen snow)
But I just got to know
(Let me please know, oh-oh-oh)

Know she'll be a part of my life
Know she'll be a part of my life forever

Let the bees make honey
Let the poor find money
Take away their sorrows
Give 'em sunshine tomorrow
But don't take her out of my life
Don't take her out of my life
What would I do without her, tell me now

Let the birds sing
With the coming spring
Let the church bells ring
Let the rain fall, let the grass grow
Let the moon glow on the fallen snow

But don't take her out of my life
