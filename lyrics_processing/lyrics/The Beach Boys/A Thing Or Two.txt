When I see my baby
When I see my little girl
When I see my woman
I'm gonna tell her 'bout the lonely hours I just spent
And say the thing we got goin', hope it never ends
Well, I'm gonna tell that little girl a thing or two

Do it right, baby
(Do it right, baby)
Aah-ha
Outta sight, baby
Aah-ha
Do it right, baby
(Do it right, baby)
Aah-ha

When I see my baby
When I look in her pretty eyes
When I get with my darlin' baby
Say my heart'll start to beat like a conga drum
She'll get my temperature to rise about a hundred and one

Do it right, baby
(Do it right, baby)
Aah-ha
Outta sight, baby
Aah-ha
Do it right, baby
(Do it right, baby)
Aah-ha

A whole day away from your woman
A separation from your girl can really mess your mind
And can you dig this one thing?
Well, it's lucky I'm workin' from nine to five
I have to live with five doctors just to keep me alive
(Keep on telling) A thing or two

Do it right, baby
(Do it right, baby)
Aah-ha
Outta sight, baby
Aah-ha-ha
Do it right, baby
