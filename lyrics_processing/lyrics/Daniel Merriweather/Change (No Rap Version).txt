I saw a dried up river and a rich man
Turnin' on a garden hose
I see a young man pickin' up a gun
I guess that's where the money goes, yeah
Am I just as good as a bad man
Sleepin' while the rest are dyin'? Yeah
Or am I just as bad as a good man
Sayin' there's no use in tryin'? Yeah

(Ooh) Tell me, do you still believe
(Ooh) Everything that you read?

Till we learn to get together
And see who we really are

Ain't nothin' gonna change
Ain't nothin' gonna change
If nobody's gonna wake up
And start askin' who's in charge
Ain't nothin' gonna change
Ain't nothin' gonna change
Ain't nothin' gonna change
La-la, la, la-la-la-la, la, la, yeah

Some people do it all for money
And some do it all for the love, yeah
Some do it all for the glory
'Cause nothin' else they're thinkin' of
I saw a man in a four-door truck
Complainin' that the price is high
Like a well-feed man with a spoon in his hand
Sayin', "Who ate all the apple pie?" Yeah

(Ooh) Tell me, do you still believe, yeah
(Ooh) Everything that you read?

Till we learn to get together
And see who we really are

Ain't nothin' gonna change
Ain't nothin' gonna change
If nobody's gonna wake up
And start askin' who's in charge
Ain't nothin' gonna change
Ain't nothin' gonna change

La-la, la, la-la-la-la, la, la, yeah

Ain't nothin' gonna change
If nobody's gonna wake up
And start askin' who's in charge
Ain't nothin' gonna change

No, no, yeah
