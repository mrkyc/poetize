I saw a dried up river and a rich man
Turnin' on a garden hose
I see a young man pickin' up a gun
I guess that's where the money goes, yeah
Am I just as good as a bad man
Sleepin' while the rest are dyin'? Yeah
Or am I just as bad as a good man
Sayin' there's no use in tryin'? Yeah

(Ooh) Tell me, do you still believe
(Ooh) Everything that you read?

Till we learn to get together
And see who we really are

Ain't nothin' gonna change
Ain't nothin' gonna change
If nobody's gonna wake up
And start askin' who's in charge
Ain't nothin' gonna change
Ain't nothin' gonna change
Ain't nothin' gonna change
La-la, la, la-la-la-la, la, la, yeah

And ain't shit changin' but diapers on babies
Get higher than the background singers singin'
La, la-la-la, la (Huh, singin')
La, na-na-na (Okay, singin')

Some people do it all for money
And some do it all for the love, yeah
Some do it all for the glory
'Cause nothin' else they're thinkin' of
I saw a man in a four-door truck
Complainin' that the price is high
Like a well-feed man with a spoon in his hand
Sayin', "Who ate all the apple pie?" Yeah

(Ooh) Tell me, do you still believe, yeah
(Ooh) Everything that you read?

Till we learn to get together
And see who we really are

Ain't nothin' gonna change
Ain't nothin' gonna change
If nobody's gonna wake up
And start askin' who's in charge
Ain't nothin' gonna change
Ain't nothin' gonna change
Ain't nothin' gonna change
La-la, la, la-la-la-la, la, la, yeah
Uh, if I ain't ready to listen, I'm never gonna listen
Most follow intuition while they wishin' it would work
And my vision is imperfect, so I don't ever look for it
They all wishin' for some change like a church worker
Hallelujah, preacher, I am not influenced
If I don't donate to your movement, am I not improving?
And while the poor kill the poor for a portion
A piece of American society pie, I get high
The munchies I got, so bear witness
I got this girl lookin' at you 'cause my ribs kissin'
Mwah, and I ain't ready to wait
When there's dollars on their brain, why would you expect change?

Till we learn to get together
And see who we really are

Ain't nothin' gonna change
Ain't nothin' gonna change
If nobody's gonna wake up
And start askin' who's in charge
Ain't nothin' gonna change
Ain't nothin' gonna change
Ain't nothin' gonna change
No, no, yeah
And ain't shit changin' but diapers on babies
Get higher than the background singers singin'
La, la-la-la, la (Singin')
