And everyone knows you but they ain't seen this side of you
I'm over the measure, one shot turns into four
And I end up injured as love turns into war
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
When I get over you and get the dirt off my shoulder
Will I look like a fool or just a whole lot older?
Givin' myself to you is like givin' myself to a chainsaw
You keep cuttin' me open
Why is it the only thing that you're good for?
Givin' myself to you is like givin' myself to a chainsaw
You keep cuttin' me open
Why is it the only thing that you're good for?
I can't remember how we started this thing
But I know I was better before you pulled the string
Somethin' to mention before you kill me
So I won't be the last one, the last one that's for sure
And oh, oh, oh, oh
The last one, oh, oh no
When I get over you and get the dirt off my shoulder
Will I look like a fool or just a whole lot older?

What you gonna do when you've had enough?
What you gonna say when it's all to late?
What you gonna do when you fall in love?
How you gonna feel when it hurts the same?
What you gonna do when you've had enough?
What you gonna say when it's all to late?
Staring at the things that you broke apart
And you know you can't put 'em back again
Givin' myself to you is like givin' myself to a chainsaw
You keep cuttin' me open
