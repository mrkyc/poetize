I remember waking up, being broke but still it wasn't breaking us
I remember why I broke the rules 'cause I ain't really have nobody to look up to
I remember cutting class, being bad 'cause I ain't have what them other kids had
I remember wishing that I knew my dad, then I remember wishing I could get him back
For every night that he told me he was coming and he didn't
For every single dollar that my mama and then was missing
For ever thing I wanted and was told I couldn't get it
And that I had to face it that my daddy was addicted
That's right it wasn't easy growing up, mama was exposing us
To life as she knew it, so we all went through it
I remember being down and out, sleeping on my homie's couch
In and outta trouble ever since my mama kicked me out
Damn it's getting real, damn it's getting real
Didn't graduate, I'm thinking damn I gotta deal
So I hit the block, selling rocks just to eat a meal
So I grabbed the Glock, kept it cocked, peace is being still
In the back of the tracks, my niggas stayed with the packs
And if a nigga was scheming, my brother stayed with the Gat
Yeah yeah, we stayed in the trap, yeah everyday in the trap
These hoes was chasing the cheese, so we would stay with the rats
And we was riding down, dipping low, I stayed in the back
In the X5 stunting, we ain't know how to act
Spending money like it's nothing 'cause we gon' get it back
17 never thought that I'd be getting them racks
Had a dream but I said I wasn't fucking with that
Mel told me I would make it, I ain't fucking with that
But he told me that it wouldn't hurt to give it a try
Hardest thing out in New Orleans, never seen 25
Right then I woke up, broke out, told my niggas had to roll out
Moved to the A and got motivated, that inspiration don't run out
Heard my brother got gunned down and it hurt me to my heart
So I kept grinding, I kept pushing, he told me to go far
So I can't stop at no crib, can't stop at no car
Gotta keep going like there ain't no tomorrow
So I'm going hard everyday 'til I got nothing to say
Nothing can stand in my way, I gotta stay to show my niggas a different way
