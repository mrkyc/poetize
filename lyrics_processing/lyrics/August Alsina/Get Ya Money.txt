They don't ever see you like I do
First thing when you wake up, before you put on your make up
And they don't really know you like I do
'Cause with me you ain't the same, you ain't gotta run no game
Girl cause what you do and what I do ain't different
We both on a mission, I love your ambition
And I know how it is to hit the block and get the guap
And you know what it is to hit the stage and make it pop

Like damn I hope somebody spend some money today
And I pray nobody come and try to take it away
'Cause I'm just outchea doing what I gotta do cause all these fucking bills are due
And I see all this money to make, so girl you know that

I ain't judging you
Go and get your money, got and get your money, go and get your money
Baby, I salute
Go and get your money, got and get your money, go and get your money
Make that money girl it's yours, spend that money girl it's yours
You work hard for all of it, it's yours, work that body baby it's yours
I ain't judging you
Go and get your money, got and get your money, go and get your money

Single mother in college, working hard for them dollars
Girl, we got something in common, making money with ballers
See you pussy popping at Onyx, keep it clapping at Magic
Got them niggas tricking at Palace, come on making it happen
Girl, I love seeing your back bend, they cashing out and you cash in
They going broke and you working, back broke when you twerking
I know how hard this shit can be when income is uncertain
Hustling just to make a way, I know you're thinking

Damn I hope somebody spend some money today
And I pray nobody come and try to take it away
'Cause I'm just outchea doing what I gotta do cause all these fucking bills are due
And I see all this money to make, so girl you know that

I ain't judging you
Go and get your money, got and get your money, go and get your money
Baby, I salute
Go and get your money, got and get your money, go and get your money
Make that money girl it's yours, spend that money girl it's yours
You work hard for all of it, it's yours, work that body baby it's yours
I ain't judging you
