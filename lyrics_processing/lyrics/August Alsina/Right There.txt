Right there, right there, right there
Right there, right there, right there
Right there, right there, right there
Right there, right there, right there

I know how it be when you trying your best
But you turn around and you got nothing to show for it
So you stay on your grind, tryna get to the shine
Even turn to crime, but how come I ain't made it yet?

I'm just like you, I know the feeling y'all
'Cause I been there too
I hope you feel me 'cause I, been through the pain
There ain't a difference, you and I are the same

Homie I was right there, right there, right there, right there
I was right there where you are, I can't forget that I was
Right there, right there, right there, right there
Now I'm reaching for the stars but I remember I was
Right there, right there, right there
Homie I was, right there, right there, right there
Getting money, right there, right there, right there
Born and raised, right there, right there, right there

I remember nights there, when I had to go to sleep, in the back of the Quick & Easy
Chilling on the boulevard, with them hard headed niggas from the 7th ward
Had a chick in the Ville, who was down for a nigga that's real
Use to have fam in the Florida projects, that's why I'll never forget

I'm just like you, I know the feeling y'all
'Cause I been there too
I hope you feel me' cause I, been through the pain
There ain't a difference, you and I are the same

Homie I was right there, right there, right there, right there
I was right there where you are, I can't forget that I was
Right there, right there, right there, right there
Now I'm reaching for the stars but I remember I was
Right there, right there, right there
Homie I was, right there, right there, right there
Getting money, right there, right there, right there
Born and raised, right there, right there, right there
Homie I was right there, right there, right there, right there
I was right there where you are, I can't forget that I was
Right there, right there, right there, right there
Now I'm reaching for the stars but I remember I was
Right there, right there, right there
Homie I was, right there, right there, right there
Getting money, right there, right there, right there
