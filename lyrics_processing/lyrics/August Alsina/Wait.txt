I'm not telling you to wait, oh
I'm not telling you to wait on me, no
I'm not telling you to wait, but I'm hoping that you'll wait

I know this may not be my place
But I got something I should say to you
Sometimes I'm in a different space
But that don't change the way I feel for you (I do)
This may not be the best time
I got a lot going inside my mind
Don't think for a minute that I'm a fool
Don't know what I'll do if I lose you

You need someone who will be there to hold you
I can't even say that it's fair, but I do
Hope you know I'll always be here if you need me
What I gotta say isn't easy

If you gotta leave
Girl, I won't stop you, so do what you gotta do
I don't want you to go
But I got a few things in life that I gotta do
I'm not telling you to wait
I'm not telling you to wait on me
I'm not telling you to wait
I'm not telling you to wait on me
But I'm hoping that you'll wait
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait
You might also like
I told you when I met you, girl, that I would need patience
You said that you understood so I thought that you could take it
We have a real good thing
Nothing should come between us
Now you want some things I never promised
You say something missing, I was always honest
Telling you the way that I felt for you
Could be something real that I never knew

You need someone who will be there to hold you
I can't even say that it's fair, but I do
Hope you know I'll always be here if you need me
What I gotta say isn't easy

If you gotta leave (if you gotta go)
Girl, I won't stop you, so do what you gotta do
I don't want you to go
But I got a few things in life that I gotta do
I'm not telling you to wait
I'm not telling you to wait on me
I'm not telling you to wait
I'm not telling you to wait on me
But I'm hoping that you'll wait
But I'm hoping that you'll wait
But I'm hoping that you'll wait
