Sometimes I get emotional
And I can't seem to find the way I'm s'posed to go
And all these so-called people that I'm s'posed to know
They be the main ones, smile up in your face, but behind your back they hate
So I hope you know, you ain't the only reason I'm emotional
My tears fall like water so that I can grow
Not like I was before
Tryna make a change, I need something more

I can't hold back these tears, let me cry
They say a man ain't supposed to cry

So I'ma let the song cry
I'ma let my soul cry through these words
I need to try to free my mind
Sometimes I need to cry just to ease my hurt
But when I let the song cry
Hope you don't think I still won't ride for mine
Every rose needs the rain sometimes
But know that you can dry your eyes this time
Let the song cry

What am I s'posed to do?
Hold it all together when I think of you?
When in my heart I'm thinking you were gone too soon
May you rest in peace, yet I can't sleep
'Cause my point of view
Got me in a state of mind, I'm so confused
Crying raindrops so that I can bloom
So what am I to do?
You might also like
I can't hold back these tears, let me cry
They say a man ain't supposed to cry

So I'ma let the song cry
I'ma let my soul cry through these words
I need to try to free my mind
Sometimes I need to cry just to ease my hurt
But when I let the song cry
Hope you don't think I still won't ride for mine
Every rose needs the rain sometimes
But know that you can dry your eyes this time
Let the song cry

Let it breathe
Let it breathe
Let it breathe
Fuck, let's get it

I may be cryin' now but I'll be laughin' later
Knew it wouldn't be easy when you're tryna be the greatest
That ever did it or does it
Ain't no fuckin' time for later
And I know they think I'm sporadic
The bastard child of an addict
But I'm way too calculated
I try to love, but I never knew it
This money, I'm blowin' through it
Ain't rockin' red or blue, I'm unafilliated
'Cause my bloods and my cousins hate me
I try to buy my mama's love, she don't appreciate it
So I stay inebriated
I figured maybe J.Cole or Drizzy Drake
Would drop a verse and tell the people how we hurtin'
Guess I was mistaken
This moment mine for the takin'
For all them nights I thought of suicide, contemplatin'
I can't hold back these tears, let me cry
They say a man ain't supposed to cry

So I'ma let the song cry
I'ma let my soul cry through these words
I need to try to free my mind
Sometimes I need to cry just to ease my hurt
But when I let the song cry
Hope you don't think I still won't ride for mine
Every rose needs the rain sometimes
But know that you can dry your eyes this time
