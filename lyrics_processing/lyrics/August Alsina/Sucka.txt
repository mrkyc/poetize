Why you calling bout ho problems? Them your problems, dialtone
Then you calling back nigga fuck that call your chick, this my phone
Last time I checked I was full grown so I ain't got time to play with ya
Keep on talking that bullshit, I might make your girl a twit picture
Pose, yeah, your chick be loving that
My spot be the place she get her loving at, loving at
Don't be mad cause I didn't know she was your girl then
Now you sad saying that August stole your girlfriend

Love is for suckers, that's why I don't trust 'em
Cause when you try to cuff 'em, you end up in trouble saying
Love is for suckers that's why I don't need it
Cause when she say she love you, then she'll make you believe that you're in love
(Love, love love, love love)
Now she got you open and she got you hoping you're in love
But you shouldn't trust her cause you just a sucka for love
(Oh oh ohhh you)
You're not in love, you're just a sucka for love
You're not in love, you're just a sucka for love

Wassup homie? What's going on?
I heard you got a lame nigga calling your phone
He got this game all wrong, if he had any words witcha
He's a fool to be calling you, guess he don't see the big picture
Love, that four letter word will have you sick
And love will have a nigga losing it
Cause he thought he could trust her and she ain't like the others
So he thought he could love her, but now he's saying
You might also like
Love is for suckers that's why I don't trust 'em
Cause you trying cuff em, you end up in trouble saying
Love is for suckers that's why I don't need it
Cause when she say she love you
She'll make you believe that you're in love
Now she got you open and she got you hoping you're in love
But you shouldn't trust her cause you just a sucker for love
You're not in love, you're just a sucker for love
