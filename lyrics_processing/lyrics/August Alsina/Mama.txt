Mama said, "Stay out of trouble"
Mama said, "Don't be a fool"
Mama said, "Stay in somebody's church"
Mama said, "Boy, stay in school"
Mama told me I better get home, before the street lights come on
Mama always used to cry when I left her
Maybe 'cause daddy was gone

I still remember the lessons my mama taught me
But now it's my turn to show you how far they brought me

Mama I made it, ah yeah, mama I made it
I could've been locked up, I could've been gunned down
But I found my own way, I ain't gonna stop now
'Cause mama I made it and I hope I made you proud

Mama said, "Stay humble"
Mama said, "Stay true"
Mama said, "Boy, keep that drama far away from you"
Mama told me keep working, busting on to the future
Mama told me she lost one and she ain't tryna lose two
But I had to find my way, and I had to get my own
Mama ain't always right, but she never led me wrong
I don't know if I'ma make it big, mama but I made it out
I know I didn't make it easy, I know you had your doubts
