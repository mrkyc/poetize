Don't forget about me

I'll never forget where I come from, I'm from the bottom
The shoes on my feet, I remember how I got 'em
When I didn't have a car, I was on the bus stop
When I needed cash, I was selling crack rock
Didn't have a lot but a nigga had enough
Had to keep it moving when the going got tough
It was bad y'all, lost some niggas on the way
It's sad y'all, they couldn't make it here today

Now I do it for my homies that'll never get to do it
And I do it for the mamas tryna make it on they own
Yeah I do it for the thugs on the yard locked up
And I do it for New Orleans, couldn't do it all alone

Believe it, while I'm outchea on the grind looking out for me
All my homies saying, Aug don't forget about me
I'm just tryna shine and see what I can be
But I can hear them saying, Aug don't forget about me

Don't forget about the hard nights
Don't forget about the downtown street lights
Don't forget about your brother, don't forget about his daughters
Don't forget your little nieces growing up without a father
And son remember mama
Remember all the nights she had to put up with your drama
And for anybody else who's saying don't forget you
My advice is that you just be unforgettable

Now I do it for my homies that'll never get to do it
And I do it for the mamas tryna make it on they own
Yeah I do it for the thugs on the yard locked up
And I do it for New Orleans, couldn't do it all alone

Believe it, while I'm outchea on the grind looking out for me
All my homies saying, Aug don't forget about me
I'm just tryna shine and see what I can be
