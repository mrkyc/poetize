Nobody knows what I go through
Wish you could put yourself inside my shoes
You got friends that ain't friends no more, they don't understand the life I chose
See the money and the fame it can hurt everything you love
Got some people that depend on me
And I can't give up
They don't know what I'm going through
They don't know what I'm going through

Nobody saw the struggle, they just see the reward
They focused on the peace but they never saw the war
Homies I started with, ain't make it 'til the end
They used to be my niggas, now we ain't friends
Long as I'm putting niggas on it be all good
Soon as I tell them that I can't they the first to go
I see em tryna come around since I'm out the hood
But I see 'em being fake so I let 'em know, I gotta let 'em know

Nobody knows what I go through
Wish you could put yourself inside my shoes
You got friends that ain't friends no more, they don't understand the life I chose
See the money and the fame it can hurt everything you love
Got some people that depend on me
And they can't give up
They don't know what I'm going through
They don't know what I'm going through

Now everybody ran out with their hand out, maybe cause I stand out
See me in the videos thinking that I'm cashing out
They don't see my homies with the notices on their house
They just think I'm eating so they sitting with an open mouth
Laying back saying I should give 'em this and buy 'em that
I remember back when I was hurting, working selling crack
Where were all these niggas at claiming they my fam?
If I lost it all tomorrow I know they won't give a damn

Nobody knows what I go through
Wish you could put yourself inside my shoes
You got friends that ain't friends no more, they don't understand the life I chose
See the money and the fame it can hurt everything you love
Got some people that depend on me
And they can't give up
They don't know what I'm going through
