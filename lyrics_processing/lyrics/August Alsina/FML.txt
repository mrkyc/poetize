All you gotta do is get it one time, one time
For all my niggas (For my niggas)
(For my niggas too) Ohh
Drumma Boy, Drumma Boy

Wake up feelin' like fuck my life
Life's a bitch, she better fuck me right
Lost my love in this losin' game
When the Feds came, it's like I lost my wife
Nigga losin' weight, as I'm losin' time
See I took a loss, see I lost a mil', then I lost my mind
Over-conversated with them hoes
Overcompensated with them hoes
Overdid it like it's overtime
Told her run the tab 'til she overdose
Alpina, Alsina, King Push like King Tut
Made niggas to you middle men
You get middle fingers, we don't give a fuck
Ow!

Let me tell you 'bout myself, I'm not scared to die
Been through so much shit, sometimes I wanna be in the sky
Wanna know how it feels to fly, wanna know how it feels to fly
I'm scared of hello, I ain't scared of goodbye

I never thought that I would be here
I never thought I'd get this far
If they say life is like a beach chair
Then why am I sitting in the dark?

Growing up (Sometimes I just feel like, fuck my life)
Growing up (Fuck my life, fuck my life)
Even when I'm up I'm feeling down, ohh
Fuck my life, fuck my life
Half my niggas locked up or underground, ohh
Fuck my life, fuck my life
Sometimes I just feel like, fuck my life
Fuck my life, fuck my life

See I grew up in the jungle, where everybody broke
A lot of niggas never make it, all they know is selling dope
Life ain't easy in the Easy, murder capital
Might not make it here tomorrow, like I'm running outta hope, no

I never thought that I would be here
I never thought I'd get this far
If they say life is like a beach chair
Then why am I sitting in the dark?
Growing up (Sometimes I just feel like, fuck my life)
Growing up (Fuck my life, fuck my life)
Even when I'm up I'm feeling down, ohh
Fuck my life, fuck my life
Half my niggas locked up or underground, ohh
Fuck my life, fuck my life
Sometimes I just feel like, fuck my life
Fuck my life, fuck my life
Even when I'm up I'm feeling down, ohh
Fuck my life, fuck my life
Half my niggas locked up or underground, ohh
Fuck my life, fuck my life
Sometimes I just feel like, fuck my life
