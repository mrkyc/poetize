Ever since day one, somebody probably say you wouldn't be nothin'
I bet they told you this over and over again on repeat like a re-run
Nobody ever told you you could live up to anythin' you want, don't give up
They rather tell you, you're destined for failure, that's what they tell you
But you just say, what about Martin?
What about Garvey? What about Rosa? What about Malcolm?
What if somebody told 'em they would never be nothin'
And they believed this, think about the outcome
Would we even be the way we are today?
Even if it weren't, could have been a harder way
Even though we lost a lot of people on the way
Had to sacrifice to get us in a better place

I hope you listen to these wizzords
All they want us thinking' 'bout is sippin' on some sizzurp
And they got us thinkin' somethin' better, we don't deserve
And that we shouldn't try, it's no use but that couldn't be further from the truth
Don't believe it, that's what they told me too
When I was growing up (they told me), they told me (that I wouldn't make it too far)
And when I got a little older (they told me) they told me
Yeah (that I wouldn't be anything)

That's what they told me, they told me, they told me
When we were little ones
That's what they told me, they told me, they told me
We're supposed to be kings and queens
That's what they told me, they told me, they told me
When we don't believe them
That's what they told me, they told me, they told me
Tryna live the American Dream
You might also like
They see the ballers and celebrities
As a reminder of the people they would never be
Jealousy got them sick without a remedy
Thinkin' when I die, nobody's gon' remember me
I was told that nobody cared
So the dreams that I had turned to nightmares
'Cause this thing called life really ain't fair
Need help but it ain't there
See you know it's really hard to stay dedicated
When the ballers screamin' they was never educated
On the corner gettin' high just to medicate it
'Cause the teachers just told him he would never make it
Now he feelin' like he made it 'cause he stackin' paper
But probably won't live to spend the money later
Nobody ever told us we could be greater
To everybody on the ground and them paper chasers

I hope you listen to these wizzords
All they want us thinkin' 'bout is sippin' on some sizzurp
And they got us thinkin' somethin' better, we don't deserve
And that we shouldn't try, it's no use but that couldn't be further from the truth

Tryna live the American Dream

(That's what they told me, they told me, they told me)
They'd rather see me dead, never gon' make it
(That's what they told me, they told me, they told me)
They'd rather see me fail, never gon' be anythin'
(That's what they told me, they told me, they told me)
They'd rather see me in jail, you're never gon' be shit
(That's what they told me, they told me, they told me)
Everybody die, you ain't shit, you never been shit
(That's what they told me, they told me, they told me)
But not everybody lives, I told you
(I told you you was gonna make it)
We gotta get out of this
When did you tell me shit?
You just gotta tell yourself
