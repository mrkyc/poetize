Kissing on me, kissing on me
Kissing on me, kissing on me
Kissing on me, kissing on me
Kissing on me, kissing on me

Baby, I don't blame you for being in the clubs and getting all that love
'Cause you're so beautiful, God made you to show that off
Now I ain't ever been the jealous type of guy, but I want you to myself, I can't lie
I know we ain't on no one-on-one thing, but baby, it should change

'Cause when I be out with other chicks I be thinking 'bout you
And when you be out on dates you be texting me too
Telling me to come pick you up when he drop you off
I pray to God he ain't breaking you off

I don't want nobody but you kissing on my tattoos
I don't want nobody but me talking to you until you fall asleep
We better stop playing before we mess around and someone gets hurt
I don't want nobody but you kissing on my tattoos
Nobody but you kissing on me, kissing on me
Nobody but you kissing on me, kissing on me
Nobody but you kissing on me, kissing on me
Nobody but you kissing on me, kissing on me
Nobody but you kissing on me, kissing on me

All my homies wanna know what's up with us
They can't believe that I'm kicking it with just one girl
But I'm cool with that
Them pretty eyes and that smile, girl I'm a fool for that, yeah I'm a fool for that

'Cause when I be out with other chicks I be thinking 'bout you
And when you be out on dates you be texting me too
Telling me to come pick you up when he drop you off
I pray to God he ain't breaking you off

I don't want nobody but you kissing on my tattoos
I don't want nobody but me talking to you until you fall asleep
We better stop playing before we mess around and someone gets hurt
I don't want nobody but you kissing on my tattoos
Nobody but you kissing on me, kissing on me
Nobody but you kissing on me, kissing on me, oh baby
Nobody but you kissing on me, kissing on me, oh baby
Nobody but you kissing on me, kissing on me
