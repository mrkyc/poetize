I just gotta be real, never been on no fake shit
Say you wanting the truth, but I hope you can take it
Lot of niggas had doubts, said I wasn't gonna make it
If I were to rap the same shit
They probably would've been on my dick
And I probably would've been on freshman list
BET wouldn't bench this
R&B niggas would've been missed
Bitch niggas wouldn't understand this
Real talk nigga, couldn't plan this
Young nigga coming for the top spot
Do know some niggas back home
That'll kill tryna get what I got
Still got some homies on the block, I'm just being honest
Niggas tryna see me shot, I'm just being honest
I know I got some hoes high, I'm just being honest
But a lame nigga I am not, I'm just being honest

Name another nigga hot, I'm just being honest
More hoes than I got, I'm just being honest
Treat bad bitches like thots, I'm just being honest
Ain't never give 'em my heart, I'm just being honest
(Gotta tell the truth)
I keep my day one niggas with me true
And we ain't never going back to what we used to do
You know I can't lie to you so I had to tell the truth
I'm just being honest
(Gotta tell the truth)
I keep my day one niggas with me true
And we ain't never going back to what we used to do
You know I can't lie to you so I had to tell the truth
I'm just being honest

Since I'm being honest, I've been way too modest
But lately I've been stressing, I've been tryna hide it
They be all up in my business, can't do shit in private
And I hear all the shit they say, but still I'm silent
(To tell the truth)
I know ya, lame niggas always hating
Probably took the bitch they dating
She choosing on a nigga, just face it
Really don't like this fame shit
Hate what the music came wit
And my brother telling me he ain't shit
Won't be shit and he's kept it
That's fucked up to be so stuck on that street shit
When they took Mel
We both said that we'd get right
It's been three years and I can't tell
Know there's an outcome
He laid down or be in jail
Pray he keep his head up
Cause Lord knows we've been through hell
Truthfully, I'm cutting people off
Who can't do shit for me
Cause I've made mistakes of helping people
Who just take from me
Seen me tryna get it
So they plotting on me faithfully
I know if I lost it all tomorrow
They won't stay with me
Most niggas be flexin'
Like they keeping it so real
Ain't getting no bad bitch
These hoes really ain't boss chicks
Never fall for that game shit
Hoes know that I peep that
So sick of these rap niggas
Who talk crack but they don't trap
So done with these gold-diggers
Who fuck just so they get racks
Nobody's got ambition
Wish I had a way to fix that
My niece is getting older
Gotta lot up on my shoulders
No muscle, no hustle, everything's a struggle
(Gotta tell the truth)
I keep my day one niggas with me true
And we ain't never going back to what we used to do
You know I can't lie to you so I had to tell the truth
I'm just being honest
I keep my day one niggas with me true
And we ain't never going back to what we used to do
You know I can't lie to you so I had to tell the truth
I'm just being honest

Niggas be talking about what they gonna do
But when they press circle on 2K
Only time they shoot
And I'm out with the same face it
None my niggas know
My lil' bro be yelling bruh, bruh
My lil' nigga too
Ain't got shit to prove but got a lot to lose
Cause when it come to light
Sometimes I get confused
Can't even call Fly
Damn I miss you dude
It's hard to see the same shit
When you got different views
But if that shit ain't working
Then make different moves
My bezel say I'm winning
Ain't got time to lose
And I heard homie be snitching, I can't fuck with dude
And if you fuck with homie, we can't fuck with you
Look, cause over here we don't play both sides
You fuck with us, you fuck with us, period, no talking (none)
And I'mma tell you like a nigga told me
Whatever happens in the streets stay in the streets, yeah
Name another nigga hot, I'm just being honest
More hoes than I got, I'm just being honest
Treat bad bitches like thots, I'm just being honest
Will never give 'em my heart, that's just being honest
