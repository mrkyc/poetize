(Oh, Knucklehead)

I know you heard that I'm a choosy lover
Realest nigga, I know, bet you won't find another
If you're tryna to be my object of affection, my number one selection
Girl, listen close, I'm 'bout to learn you somethin'
I ain't never been one to catch feelings, I come and I go as I please
Not sayin' I'm pimpin' forever, but for now this is how it's gon' be
Just tryna stay in the moment and chasin' this paper, I'm focused
But if you ain't with it, then clear it, 'cause the look in your eyes say you open

Girl, I was just rollin' through the hood when I saw you sexy
Damn you lookin' good, when you caught my eye
Told you I just need somebody for me
Then you started walkin' over slowly, this is what you told me

I'm so glad you chose me
But this would be my very first time, very first time
This would be my very first time
And I don't want to waste your time
But I'm so glad you chose me
But this would be my very first time, very first time
This would be my very first time
So promise me you'll take your time

Said it's the first time with a real nigga
Never had a man who could boss up, know how to deal with her
Not in a rush, know how to chill with her, when I'm down to fuck, keep it real with her
Ain't nothin' new, been trill with her, keep the Tommy on me like Hilfiger
So girl, if you with it, stop playin' and get it, save all that talkin', you ready to leave it
If you want me to take it, I want you to give it and if you can take it, the sky is the limit
I wanna take you as high as the ceilin', you know you're first, how you all in your feelings
Who ever knew we could have it this good? Damn

Girl, I was just rollin' through the hood when I saw you sexy
Damn you lookin' good, when you caught my eye
Told you I just need somebody for me
Then you started walkin' over slowly, this is what you told me

I'm so glad you chose me
But this would be my very first time, very first time
This would be my very first time
And I don't want to waste your time
But I'm so glad you chose me
But this would be my very first time, very first time
This would be my very first time
