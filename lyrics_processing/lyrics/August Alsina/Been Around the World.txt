I've been around, I've been around the world (I've been around the world)
I've been around, I've been around the world (I've been around the world)
I've been around, I've been around the world (I've been around the world)
I've been around, I've been around the world (I've been around the world)

First thing first, I'm Aug, freaks, all the honies
Dummies, Playboy bunnies, hoes gettin' money
That's the one they like 'cause they only get the pipe
And if they act right, they might get to spend the night
These girlies wanna be with me
These hoes tryna trap a G, but I ain't with it
Money out there, nigga tryna get it
A lot them bitches tell me I be slippin', I admit it
Had my share of every kind of girl
But lately, this ain't what you need, not me, girl
'Cause you know they gon' hate on you
And they really gon' hate me too 'cause I'm too honest all about it

Been around the world and I-I-I (Around, been around)
Swear this shit been crazy
I don't know how, I don't why (Been around, been around)
I should choose one lady
Been around the world and I-I-I (Around, been around)
Met the girls who get down
You should know I get around (Been around, been around)
When you fuckin' with a nigga like me, girl, I hope you see
You might also like
I've been around (I've been around), I've been around the world (I've been around)
Girl, you know they gon' hate on you (Oh-woah)
I've been around (I've been around), I've been around the world (I've been around)
And they really gon' hate me too
I've been around (I've been around), I've been around the world (I've been around)
So we gon' do what we do (Girl, I've been around)
I've been around (I've been around), I've been around the world (I've been around)
Just know I can't be with you 'cause I been around (Oh, yeah)

Baby girl, show me
What makes you different from them other girls
You must not know me
Girl, I'm the best you ever had
So, girl, don't you start runnin' game on me
Don't be listenin' to them weak niggas
A nigga rich, we takin' trips, I spend a week with ya
Baby, now we on the beach, rollin' in the sand
Go to Paris, I know you like France
You can bring your girls, ain't a lot of niggas
And I'ma end up grabbin' your booty with both hands
Then you like, "Please, baby
Can we go somewhere one on one, so you can put it on me, baby?"
Girl, I'ma put it down, you know I've been around
You get the dick 'cause I
Been around the world and I-I-I (Oh, around, been around)
Man, this shit been crazy
I don't know how, I don't why (Been around, been around, woah, woah)

Been around the world and I-I-I (Around, been around, oh, ooh)
Met the girls who get down
You should know I get around (Been around, been around)
When you fuckin' with a nigga like me, girl, I hope you see (Oh)

Girl, you know they gon' hate on you (Oh, oh)
