I will hold you here and keep
All our secret dreams and plans
You never thought our love could last
Now you've put that in the past
'Cause you finally understand
That after all the times you told me
That we'd never be good together
After all the things you said
That made me think that you'd never call
Now you've turned around and told me
That you want to stay here forever
And you're back here in my arms
Where you belong, after all
We all the promises we made
All the words we never said
Never knowing what was right
You didn't know that the love we used to share
Wasn't cause it wasn't there
We'll make up for it tonight
'Cause after all the times you told me
That we'd never be good together
After all the things you said
That made me think that you'd never call
Now you've turned around and told me
That you want to stay here forever
And you're back here in my arms
Where you belong
Back here in my arms
Where you belong, after all

And your dreams took you places far from me
How I long to believe?
You'd return, now here you are
That after all the times you told me
