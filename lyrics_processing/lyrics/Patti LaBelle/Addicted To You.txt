Can't nobody else
Move me like you do
I'm addicted to you
I try to let go
But I can't say no
It's sad but it's true
I'm addicted to you
Who am I fooling?
(I just wish I knew why)
This hold you got on me won't let my heart be free
From this confusion
When will it all end?
In spite of myself
Can't nobody else
Move me like you do
I'm addicted to you
I try to let go
But I can't say no
It's sad but it's true
I'm addicted to you
I was determined
(I made up my mind)
Once I walked out that door (that door)
I would not have anymore
Of sad delusions
But here I go again

Can't nobody else
Move me like you do
I'm addicted to you
I try to let go
But I can't say no
It's sad but it's true
I'm addicted to you
Oh, I know that it's wrong
To keep holding on
I try to be strong, but my will is all gone
When I look into your eyes
I can see past all your lies
I don't want nobody else
Yes, I'm hooked in spite of myself
So sad
Only you, only you
When I'm blue
Sad but true
Never knew
In spite of myself
Can't nobody else
Move me like you do
I'm addicted to you
I try to let go
But I can't say no
It's sad but it's true
I'm addicted to you
I'm gonna keep on, I'm gonna keep on, I'm gonna keep on loving you as hard as I can
I'm gonna keep on, I"m gonna keep on, I'm gonna keep on
Keep on, keep on loving you
