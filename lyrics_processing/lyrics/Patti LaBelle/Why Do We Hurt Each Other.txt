I don't know the reason why we do these things
Why we fight despite all the tears and the hurt it brings
I know no one else can fill this space inside our hearts
So then why are we trying to make us break apart?

If we love each other, why do we hurt each other?
If we need each other, why do we make each other cry?
If we care about each other, why do we bring pain to one another?
Why do we make each other sad, treat each other bad?
If we love each other why do hurt each other this way?

Oh, I don't see why you and me cannot get it right
Oh, I can't recall the last time that we kissed good night
I know no one else has touched my soul as much as you
And it's such a shame the pain we put each other through

If we love each other, why do we hurt each other?
If we need each other, why do we make each other cry?
If we care about each other, why do we bring pain to one another? (Why do we do it)
Why do we make each other sad, treat each other bad? (I don't know)
If we love each other why do hurt each other this way?

Oh, can't we try to bring some feeling back to you and I?
We can't go on like we are
We can't keep playing these parts
We can't keep breaking these hearts, baby, oh

If we love each other, why do we hurt each other?
If we need each other, why do we make each other cry?
If we care about each other, why do we bring pain to one another?
Why do we make each other sad, treat each other bad?
If we love each other why do hurt each other this way?

Why can't we? Why?
Said, if we care about each other
Why do we bring pain?
Sad, so bad, so bad
Why? Why? Oh, oh, oh
Oh, baby
Why do we hurt each other?
(I don't know, I don't know, why, oh, I don't know)
I don't wanna hurt no more, no more, no more (no more)
(Oh, don't hurt me no more, no more, oh)
I hurt you (You hurt me)
That ain't how it's supposed to be
When we're in love
Do you love me? (I love you)
I know you do
You love me (I sure do)
Let's make love, tenderly
All night long, all night long, oh, oh, to ya darlin'
