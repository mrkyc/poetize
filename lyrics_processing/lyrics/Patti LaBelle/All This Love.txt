And no one could seem to solve them
But you found the answer
You told me to take this chance
And learn the ways of love
My baby
And all that it has to offer
In time you will see that love
Won't let you down
You said that you loved me
And hurt only came to pass me
It sounded so convincing
And I gave it half a chance
And learned the ways of Love (learned the ways of love)
My baby
And theres so much love inside me (inside)
And all that I have I give my all to you
OhOhOhOooh All my love, baby
All this love is waiting for you
Cause I really love you baby
Oh I really love you honey
All this love is waiting for you
