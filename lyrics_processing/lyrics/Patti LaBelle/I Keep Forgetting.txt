You know how sometimes people get amnesia, huh
Just forget everything
This is one of my favorite songs from back in the day

I keep forgettin' we're not in love anymore
I keep forgettin' things will never be the same again
I keep forgettin' how you made that so clear
I keep forgettin', darling

Every time you're near, ooh
Every time I see you smile
And I hear your "Hello"
Saying you can only stay a while
And I know that it's hard for you
To say the things we both know are true
But tell me how come I

I keep forgettin' we're not in love anymore
(Oh-oh, I got amnesia, baby)
I keep forgettin' things will never be the same again
(I, I can't remember, no)
I keep forgettin' how you made that so clear (So clear)
I keep forgettin', baby
See Patti LaBelle LiveGet tickets as low as $31You might also like
Every time I hear
How you never want to live a lie
How it's gone too far
And you don't have to tell me why, no
Why you're gone, why the game is through
If this is what's real, if this is what's true
Tell me why can't I

I keep forgettin' we're not in love anymore
(Oh, tell me, darling)
I keep forgettin' things will never be the same again
(Oh, things will never be the same again and I know that)
I keep forgettin' how you made that so clear (So clear)
I keep forgettin', baby

Don't say that, don't say that, don't say that
I know you're not mine, no
Anymore, anyway, any time
Tell me how come I

I keep forgettin' we're not in love anymore
(How come I)
I keep forgettin' things will never be the same again
(Keep forgettin' you don't love me)
I keep forgettin' how you made that so clear (So clear)
I keep forgettin', baby
(Don't say that, I said I've got amnesia)
I keep forgettin' we're not in love anymore (Oh, oh)
I keep forgettin' things will never be the same again
(Things will never be the same again)
I keep forgettin' how you made that so clear (Oh yeah, so clear)
