Out of the lonely blue
(Patti)
I' I hear your voice
I' I hear your voice
I' I hear your voice calling in the night (can't take it baby)
I remember just like it was yesterday
I woke up baby, you were gone
I didn't even wanna tear myself up out of bed
Let alone, I didn't wanna carry on
(chorus)
'Cause I could hear your voice (I hear your voice calling in the night)
I can't stop it (stop it) no matter how hard I try
I can hear your sound, your sound (I hear your sound calling in the night)
In a word, I feel like I wanna die
I started looking, lookin' from dusk 'til dawn
For ways that I wouldn't miss you so much
I even bought a new dress (new dress)
But when I put it on
I could still (still) still (still) feel your touch (feel your touch)
And I could hear your voice (I hear your voice calling in the night)
I can't stop it (stop it) no matter how hard I try
I can hear your sound, your sound, your sound(I hear your sound calling in the night)
In a word, I feel like I wanna die (feel like I wanna die)

A bird in hand beats two in the bush'
What my friends don't know, and I ain't about to tell them
Is that you're the only one, you're the only one that knows what buttons to push
Oh oh it don't take no scientist to tell you what's wrong with me
No no no it don't take good vision to see what any fool could see
That I just need your body, I just need your fa fa fa fa face
Right where it counts, no not in another place
I'm talkin' about all up hey, & all down
Every inch, you see, I don't need ya cross town
You better read my lips, I need you here with me
I can't stop it, no matter how I try
In a word, I feel like I wanna die
( I hear your voice)
I' I hear your voice
I' I hear your voice
I' I hear your voice calling in the night
