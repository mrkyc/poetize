Runnin' hot
Runnin' cold
I was runnin' into overload
It was extreme

I took it so high
So low
So low, there was nowhere to go
Like a bad dream

Somehow the wires uncrossed
The tables were turned
Never knew I had such a lesson to learn

I'm feelin' good from my head to my shoes
Know where I'm goin' and I know what to do
I've tidied up my point of view
I got a new attitude
I'm in control, my worries are few
'Cause I've got love like I never knew
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
I got a new attitude

I'm wearing a new dress, new hat
Brand new ideals, as a matter of fact
I've changed for good
Must have been the cool night
New moon, slight change
Or that look in your eye
More than to figure, but I feel like I should, yes

Somehow the wires uncrossed
The tables were turned
Never knew I had such a lesson to learn

I'm feelin' good from my head to my shoes
Know where I'm goin' and I know what to do
I've tidied up my point of view
I got a new attitude
I'm in control, my worries are few
'Cause I've got love like I never knew
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
I got a new attitude
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh

Somehow the wires uncrossed
The tables were turned
Never knew I had such a lesson to learn
I'm feelin' good from my head to my shoes
Know where I'm goin' and I know what to do
I've tidied up my point of view
I got a new attitude
I'm in control, my worries are few
'Cause I've got love like I never knew
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
I got a new attitude (Gonna feel it)
(Ooh) Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
From my head to my shoes
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
(I, I got new) I got a new attitude
(I got new) Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh (New attitude)
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh (Everything about me has changed)
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh (Baby, I ain't the same)
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
I got a new attitude
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
