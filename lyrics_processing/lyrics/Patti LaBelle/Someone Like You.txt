All my life I've waited for someone like you
With a heart of gold
Hey hey hey yes
I always knew
I knew you would come my way
All my life I've waited, I've waited
I've waited for someone like you

I've waited a lifetime
For someone just like you
Somebody who will take my hand
Someone who's warm and true
Romancing by candlelight
A touch from you thrills my heart
Say if you love me and you feel right
Nothing can keep us apart

All my life I've waited for someone like you
With a heart of gold
I always knew you would come my way
All my life I've waited for someone like you

From now 'til the end of the time
That's how long I'll be loving you
Together we will live in paradise
A paradise made for two
All my prayers have been answered
And my dreams are reality
I feel complete whenever you're next to me
So I'm gonna hold on
I'll never let go, No, No

Every day we'll make sunshine
