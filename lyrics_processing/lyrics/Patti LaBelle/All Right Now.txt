All right now

You used to mean the world to me
My eyes were blind
I couldn't see the truth for all your treachery
Too tired to fight
I just accepted we were never mean to be
After the rain
I lived with the pain
Of trying to find myself again, baby
Said I'm all right now
Hey boy, said, said I'm gonna be alright
Doo doo doo doo doot doo doo, na na na na na na

I thought our love was far above
Any temptation that would
Ever cause that heart of yours to change
But in the end you couldn't bend
Enough to take the steps
That lead you back my way
Things got so strange!
It took a while for me to smile
And comprehend the fact
Our love was over
We were really through
But since I found my higher ground
I have the strength
To start again without
A thought of missing you

I thought I would die
But I survived to testify
I'm all right now
Said that I am, that's right baby
And I'm gonna stay that way!
After the rain
I suffered the pain
Of trying to find myself again, baby
Said I'm all right now

Now my crying days are gone
You will be the one alone
Hey, it's time for me
To be happy like I used to be
Hey, oh baby, my eyes have dried
Truth has set me free, baby
When you said goodbye
I thought I would die
But I survived to testify
Said I'm all right now
After the rain
I lived through the pain
Of trying to find myself again
All right now, said I'm alright now
When you said goodbye
I thought I would die
But I survived to testify
Said that I'm all right now
Said I'm alright now
After the rain
And after the rain
I survived through the pain
Of trying to find myself again
All right now
