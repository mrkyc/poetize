Tell, tell, tell, tell me
Mmm, tell me
Tell, tell, tell, tell me
Who needs the aggravation
I think I'm running out of patience
I can't take any more heartbreak
Why be a Cinderella
When you can't find a fella
It's a nightmare, it's not fair
I need the kind of lovin'
Hotter than my mama's overn
I'm on fire with a love desire
Tell me, when am I gonna find true love
When am I gonna find true love
When am I gonna find
When am I gonna find
When am I gonna find true love
I ask myself the question
Ooo, tell me
Somebody tell me
I'm in a situation
Even with the going inflation
No good men, can't spread myself that thin
I need a magic potion
To put my love back in motion
My confusion is no illusion
I need the right connection
I'm moving in the wrong direction
To enhance a lasting romance
Tell me, when am I gonna find true love
When am I gonna find true love
When am I gonna find
When am I gonna find
When am I gonna find true love
I ask myself the question
Tell me, when am I gonna find
When am I gonna find
When am I gonna find true love
I ask myself the question
Tell me, when am I gonna find
When am I gonna find
When am I gonna find true love
When am I gonna find
When am I gonna find
When am I gonna find true love
Ooo, tell me
Somebody tell me
True love
True love
Somebody tell me
Somebody tell me
Tell, tell me
Tell, tell, tell, tell me
Tell me
Tell, tell, tell, tell me, tell me
Oh, I need you to tell me, tell me
Oh, somebody tell me, tell me
Oh, I want to know, tell me
Somebody tell me, tell me
Oh, tell me, tell me
Oh, true love
I need true love
Tell me, tell me
Oh, won't somebody tell me, tell me
Oh, tell me, tell me
