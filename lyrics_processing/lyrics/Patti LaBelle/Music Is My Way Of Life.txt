Music is the way I live, I'm alive and living now

Well I come from a world where there's nothing you can live for
Except when day turns into night I'm the star in neon lights
I know the only way out is through my dancing
That's when I let my fantasies, when I dance they look at me
That's one thing you can't take from me, is the music that I feel in my soul
When the daylight comes and I'm leaving the dance floor
By nighttime I'll be back for more

Music is the way I live, I'm alive and living now

As my heart beats to the rhythm of the music
People turn their heads and stare, watching as I'm dancing there
I know mama's blessed, I'm best when I'm dancing
My feet can dance upon a dime, I'll give five cents back keep in time
That's one thing you can't take from me, the music that I feel in my soul
When the daylight comes and I'm leaving the dance floor, by nighttime I'll be back for more
