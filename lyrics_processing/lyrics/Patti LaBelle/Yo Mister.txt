Yo mister, how's your daughter?
You really ought to know
For every thing you taught her
Don't matter when she's all alone

My crazy friend named Cara
After all of us told her "No"
S-s-she did another speed ball
Now, she's going nowhere slow
Her papa caught her for the first time
And put her out on the street
Cara told me to remind him
That she was only seventeen

Yo, mister, how's your daughter?
You really ought to know
How's your girl?
Every thing you taught her
It don't matter when she's all alone
How's your girl?

Cara got hooked up with the wrong kids
Then s-s-she started skipping school
Then Cara got high to make disappear
A world full of fools

Her father was the biggest fool of them all
When she was speeding
That's what she'd say
Maybe, maybe
Maybe she wouldn't talk so stupid
If she knew how much she needed this fool today

Yo, mister how's your daughter?
You really ought to know
How's your girl?
For everything you taught her
Don't matter when she's all alone

She needs you right now, mister
Cause she ain't got long to live
It's so easy to say I love you
But it's harder to forgive

Her father cried
When I told him that Cara twice got knocked up
He said, "Just like her mama, uh-huh
She shows her body
When she wants to show love
She tried that stuff with me
But I beat her down
There's no way I could let her stay
Couldn't let her stick around
Cause I tried so hard to raise her right"
He said, "What made her turn out this way?"
I don't know
What made her turn out this way
I don't know
I don't know
And I said and I said and I said
Yo, mister
How's your daughter?
You really ought to know
Everything
Everything you taught her
Don't matter when she's all alone

But she needs you right now, mister
She ain't got long to live
It's easy to say I love you
But it's harder to forgive
