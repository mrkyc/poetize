I can't sit here while I go nowhere
Chase my dreams through the polluted air
Walking on a wire
Running out of time
There's no room in this ol' heart of mine
Bill collectors waiting down the hall
Neighbors scream
And crack the bedroom wall
Nerves jump off the pavement
Passion hits the street
Anger's cookin' in the city heat
World's too crazy
I can't take no more
I won't stay here locked behind the door

Baby, stir it up
Got to break it up now
When I think about tomorrow
I can't wait to
Stir it up
Got to shake it up now
If I have to beg or borrow
I'm not gonna take it anymore

Hungry minds do stare you in the eye
Spread it thick
And lay the biggest lies
Don't say what you feel
Must play hard to get
All those time bombs tickin' in your head
So much pressure to keep holdin' on
Pack my clothes up
Baby, I'll be gone

Baby, stir it up
Got to break it up now
When I think about tomorrow
I can't wait to
Stir it up
Got to shake it up now
If I have to beg or borrow
I'm not gonna take it anymore

Can't find love
Because it's trapped inside
Can't find freedom
Flirting with the line
Make some room in this ol' heart of mine
So much pressure to keep holdin' on
Pack my clothes up
Baby, I'll be gone

Baby, stir it up
Got to break it up now
When I think about tomorrow
I can't wait to
Stir it up
Got to shake it up now
If I have to beg or borrow
I'm not gonna take it anymore
Got to break it up now
When I think about tomorrow
I can't wait to
Stir it up
Got to shake it up now
If I have to beg or borrow
