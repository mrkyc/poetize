Safe inside their dreams, is it a scheme
They think they'll grow up into Queens
I am old, I am young and wise
I'm just a little girl in low cut clothes
Who hides behind a face, but really knows
That you devise what a child get for free
Can loving be that way once for me?
Come on and hold me tight
Don't turn off the light
Just let your words embrace me
Like a fathers loving arms
Protect me from the night it will be alright
Cause tonight I'm just a little girl
A women is what a woman gives
Sometimes she gives too much, look but don't touch
Most times for me, there's not enough
When a man fall in love, with me
He moves into me like he would a house
He decorates me and lives his fantasies out
If you devise what a child gets for free
And I'll be viewed that way once... of me
