No one will have to beg to eat
If we live in a world of dignity
No man will have to live on the street
If I tell you you're a part of me
There's no need for disbelief
Here's my hand to let you know
That what we dream we all can hold
Apart we are weak
Together we're strong
Oh, People
We're all writing this song
We're all living these words together, forever
There's no reason
We can't live and be one
Build the world that we want together
For as long as you stand here by me
We'll live on
Think of all the possibilities
That the eyes of a child can see
Think of all the opportunities
That float right by you and me

You know what?

Oh, there's room for us all
