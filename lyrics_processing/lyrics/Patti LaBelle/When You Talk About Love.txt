Yeah!
Love, ha-hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Talk about love
That's all I want you to do

I'd like to give you a test
So, darling, prepare yourself
When I say "Love", please explain
What pictures pop in your brain?

'Cause when you talk about love (Love, love, love)
Said when you think about love (Love, love, love)
Ooh, when you talk about love (Love, love, love)
You should be talking 'bout me (Love, love, love)

Now, if you need to be taught
Don't make me an afterthought
For every lesson that's wrong
You can bet my good lovin' will be gone
So, let's erase any doubt
Take a second or two to figure out
Speak from your lips to my ears
Yes, I know you know what I wanna hear
