Only one of seven men in his platoon that made it back alive
He must have seen some tough times
But he never talked too much about all of that
Put his pictures and his memories in the cedar chest
Everything but his old army hat
By the time I graduated the winds of change had blown across our land
They were burning flags and draft cards
When they bothered to take some kind of stand
And we used to laugh at grandpa
Like he was some old relic from the past
'Cause he never left the house less he was wearing
That funny looking worn out army hat
Every eye was on him anytime that he went anywhere
They whispered and they pointed
But you could tell that grandpa didn't care
I ain't weaning this for them he said it's a whole lot more than that
For my buddies who gave everything the least that I can do
Is keep on wearing this old army hat
He called me up one morning said he'd seen it on the news on his tv
They've opened up a monument to World War II in Washington D.C
I ain't getting any younger
And I wish someone would take me to see that
I couldn't help but think their gonna laugh at you up there
If you show up in that silly army hat
You might also likeTwo strangers both saluted as grandpa walked up to the monument
One said thank you soldier for a job well done the other said amen
And a young boy said sir my daddy went to war and never made it back
Would you take a picture standing here beside me
And maybe let me wear your army hat
Every eye was on him and there was not a dry one in the crowd
They whispered and they pointed
And grandpa stood up extra tall and proud
He said son just keep it
When the young boy tried his best to give it back
You're a brave little soldier son and every soldier needs
His very own authentic army hat
For your daddy who gave every thing the least that I can do
