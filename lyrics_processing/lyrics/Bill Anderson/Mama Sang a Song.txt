I get to thinking lots of times about back when I was a lad
Of the old homeplace where I grew up of the days both good and bad
My overalls were hand-me-downs my shoes were full of holes
I used to walk four miles to school every day through the rain the sleet and the cold
I've seen the nights when my daddy would cry
For the things that his family would need
But all he ever got was a badland farm and seven hungry mouths to feed
And yet and yet our homefire never flickered once
Cause when all these things went wrong
Mama took the hymn book down and mama sang a song
(What a friend we have in Jesus)
I've been rocked to sleep many a night to the tune of What a Friend
And come morning Rock of Ages would wake me gently once again
And when daddy would reach up and he'd take the Bible down
And he'd read it read it loud and long
And I always felt that maybe our house was blessed
When daddy would say mama sing a song
Sister left home first I guess and then Bob and then Tommy and then Dan
By then dad's hair was turning white and I had to be mama's little man
But it seemed that as daddy's back grew weak my mother's faith just grew strong
And those were the greatest days of all when mama sang a song
(Rock of ages cleft for me let me hide myself in Thee)
I guess the house is still standing I don't get to go back much anymore
No voice is left to fill those halls and no steps to grace the floor
For you see my mother sings in heaven now around God's golden throne
But I'll always believe that this world is a better place
