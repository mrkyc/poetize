I'd have spent a lot more time out in the pouring rain
Without an umbrella covering my head
And I'd have stood up to that bully when he pushed and shoved
And called me names but I was too afraid

And I'd have gone on and seen Elvis that night
He came to town and Mama said I couldn't
And I'd have gone skinny-dipping with Jenny Carson
That time she dared me to and I didn't

Oh I I'd have done a lot of things different

I wish I'd have spent more time with my dad when he was alive
Now I don't have the chance
I wish I had told my brother just how much I loved him
Before he went off to war, but I just shook his hand

And I wish I'd gone to church on Sunday mornings
When my grandma begged me to, but I was scared of God
And I wish I would have listened when they said
Boy you're gonna wish you had, but I wouldn't
You might also like
Oh I I'd do a lot of things different

People say they wouldn't change a thing
Even if they could, oh but I would

There was this red dress she wanted one time
So bad she could taste it, I should have bought it but I didn't
And she wanted to paint our bedroom yellow and trim it in blue and greens
But I wouldn't let her wouldn't have hurt nothing

Oh, and she loved to be held and kissed and touched
But I didn't do it, not nearly enough
And if I'd know that was going to be our last dance
I'd have told the band to play on and on and on and on and on

Oh I I'd do a lot of things different

People say they wouldn't change a thing
Even if they could, oh but I would
Yes I I'd have done a lot of things different
