When I walked over and said "Hi" and introduced myself
And "What's your name?" I asked
She just smiled
She was wearing a tiny gold chain, with the initials SS on the front
And I said, "Wait a minute, let me guess, you are Susie Smith."
She shook her head
"O.K. then your Sally Simpson.....Sara" before I could finish
She put her hand on mine and said, "Look, it's not important."
And I said, "O.K., I'll just call you Double S"
She nodded
And I said, "What are you drinking Double S?"
She said "Scotch and soda."
I said "O.K. Miss Double S, One Scotch and soda coming up."
" You live around here?" I asked
"No" she said, "Just killing time 'till morning
I 've got an early plane back to California, I live near San Simeon"
"Oh, you'll be flying on a seven o seven no doubt?"
"How'd you know?" she asked
"Oh, well I guess I'm just super smart."
"You gonna spend the rest of the night here in this bar Double S?"
"No," she said, "I have a motel room. I'm at the Surf and Sand."
"Can I give you a lift?"
"Thanks, I rented a car, but I don't drive it to well. She answered
It's a stick shift."
"Double S you are something special." I said. And I paid the tab
We walked out into the cool evening breeze
She slid across the seat and snuggled up close to my side
And I began to run my fingers through her hair
It was soft and silky
I opened the door to her room
My lips found her lips and I held her close
And I whispered, "Your are a Super Sexy Lady."
She simply smiled and I could feel her body slowly soften
As her sensuous soul swept me into sublime serenity
Her plane left just as the morning sun slowly began to streak the starry sky
She kissed me a soft sayonara, waved a sultry 'so long' from the window
And I never saw Double S again
Right now she's soaring somewhere above the clouds
And I'm walking home on one
And I just realized I never did find out what Double S stood for
