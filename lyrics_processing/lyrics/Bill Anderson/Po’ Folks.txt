There's a whole lotta people lookin' down their noses at me
'Cause I didn't come from a wealthy family
There was ten of us livin' in a two room shack
On the banks of the river by the railroad track
We kept chickens in a pen in the back
And everybody said we was po' folks

My daddy was a farmer, but all he ever raised was us
Dug a forty-foot well, struck thirty-six gallons of dust
The Salvation Army give us clothes to wear
A man from the county came to cut our hair
We lived next door to a millionaire
But we wasn't nothin' but po' folks

We was po' folks livin' in a rich folks' world
We sure was a hungry bunch
If the wolf had ever come to our front door
He'd had to brought a picnic lunch

My granddaddy's pension was a dollar and thirty-three cents
That was ten dollar less than the landlord wanted for rent
The landlord's letters got nasty indeed
He wrote "Get out," but Pa couldn't read
And we was too broke to even pay heed
But that's how it is when you're po' folks
You might also like
We was po' folks livin' in a rich folks' world
We sure was a hungry bunch
If the wolf had ever come to our front door
He'd had to brought a picnic lunch

But we had something in our house money can't buy
Kept us warm in the winter, cool when the sun was high
For whenever we didn't have food enough
And the howlin' winds would get pretty rough
We patched the cracks and set the table with love

'Cause that's what you do when you're po' folks
And we wasn't nothin' but po' folks
My mom and my dad was po' folks
My brother and my sister was po' folks
My dog and my cat was po' folks
