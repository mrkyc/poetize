You get up, you get down
You get lost and then you get found
Sure as I'm sittin' here
Sure as I'm sittin' here
You get a laugh, you get a cry
Get 'em all before you die
Sure as I'm sittin' here
Sure as I'm sittin' here

Come on, sit down, get down
A-come on, sit down, get down
Sure as I'm sittin' here
Sure as I'm sittin' here

All the ladies (Fine ladies) hypnotize you
And all your friends, well, they just patronize you
Don't gotta look for God, he's just sittin' here
And I think He's got a plan but it's not too clear

You get the truth, you get a lie
Enough to make a grown man cry
Sure as I'm sittin' here
Sure as I'm sittin' here
You get the light
You get the dark
Fall in love, it breaks your heart
Sure as I'm sittin' here
Sure as I'm sittin' here
