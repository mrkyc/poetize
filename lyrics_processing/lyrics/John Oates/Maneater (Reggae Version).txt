She only comes out at night
The lean and hungry type
Nothing is new, I've seen her here before
Watching and waiting
She's sitting with you but her eyes are on the door
So many have paid to see
What you think you're getting for free
The woman is wild, a she-cat tamed by the purr of a Jaguar
Money's the matter
If you're in it for love
You ain't gonna get too far

Woah, here she comes
Woah, here she comes
(Watch out, boy, she's gonna chew you up)
Watch out, boy, she's gonna chew you up
(Oh, here she comes)
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah
She only comes out at night
When she's a little hungry
(Woah, here she comes)
Oh, the woman is wild, woman is wild
Know I've seen her here before, woah, woah
Said (Woah, woah, woah-ooh-oh)
You better think about it
She's a maneater
You know the woman is wild
You might also like
I wouldn't if I were you
I know what she can do
She's so deadly, man, she can really rip your world apart
Mind over matter
Ooh, the beauty is there, but a beast is in the heart

Woah, here she comes
(Watch out, boy, you better watch out, boy)
Watch out, boy, she's gonna chew you up, mm
(Oh, here she comes)
Oh, here she comes
Only comes out at night
When she's a little hungry and tight
(Woah, here she comes)
(Watch out, boy, she's gonna chew you up)
She's gonna rip your world apart
You know the beast is in her heart
(Woah, woah, woah-ooh, woah)
She's a maneater
(Maneater)
I said the woman is wild

Hey
(Oh, here she comes)
Oh, watch out boy, you better watch out boy
(Oh, here she comes)
Well, she only comes out at night, that's right
(Oh, woah, woah, woah, oh-ooh-oh)
Too many have paid to see
What you think you're getting for free, yeah
(Oh, here she comes)
The woman is wild, woman is wild
(Oh, here she comes)
She's a deadly fantasy
(Woah, woah, woah-ooh-oh)
Well, you ain't gonna get too far
'Cause if you're in for love it's gonna leave a scar, hey
(Oh, here she comes)
Oh, watch out boy, she's gonna chew you up
(Oh, here she comes)
She's a maneater, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Woah, woah, woah-ooh-oh)
She's a maneater, yeah
