Could you tell me what side I should pick
I brought this new me home to show the world
Get your shades for the star I am shining
I always said it was all about timing
You, look for patience but I don't think you'll find it
You gotta learn it
You gotta earn it
I feel the sun rays
Like every days a Sunday
You can have the money
I just want the love
You think that my mind is lost and I'm gonna be late (Why)
But I think that I'm gonna be great
All my friends are telling me that I should keep the faith
So baby just give me my space
I've fallen before for no reason
I'm growing I'm changing like seasons
I just needed me to believe it
So tell me now what are you seeing
Get your shades for the star I am shining
I always said it was all about timing
You, look for patience but I don't think you'll find it
You gotta learn it
You gotta earn it
I feel the sun rays
Like every days a Sunday
You can have the money
I just want the love

But I think that I'm gonna be great

So baby just give me my space
One day, you will hear me
Oh so clearly
Now's the time
Oh oh, Oh oh
Clearly, its no theory
You'll me miss dearly
When I pass you by
Oh oh, Oh oh
I feel the sun rays
Like every days a Sunday
You can have the money
I just want the love
You think that my mind is lost and I'm gonna be late (Why)
But I think that I'm gonna be great
All my friends are telling me that I should keep the faith
