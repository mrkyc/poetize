And you really look like you're in love
Boy, she's really got you
She's the only one you're thinking of
I've been watching, baby
To see just how far you would go
When you move, be careful
Because I think that there is something you don't know
I'll bet she's got a boyfriend (yeah)
That she's not telling you about

(That she's not telling you)
I'll bet she's got a boyfriend
And you know that you're the one
I can't live without
Can I tell a secret?
I love you more than that girl ever will
And I'm feeling so bad
Cause you don't understand the love I feel
You might also likeI would never hurt you
Would never treat you less than very well
But she's gonna leave you
And how soon it's gonna happen
Time will tell
I'll bet she's got a boyfriend (yeah)
