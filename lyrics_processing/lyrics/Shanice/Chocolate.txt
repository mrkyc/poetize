I remember when I was a little girl
A Hershey's Kiss was my favorite thing in the world
When I was lost, I would always turn to something sweet
A candy bar would always satisfy me instantly
Oh oh, you're my...

Chocolate, you're my Chocolate (Uh-huh)
Caramel cream filled, hundred percent filled
Chocolate you're my chocolate (Ooh ooh)
Cocoa butter honey lover, you're like no other
You're my chocolate, you're my chocolate
Like hot fudge, you're too much, I can't get enough
Of your chocolate, your chocolate
You are my favorite candy

Every day, you would always surprise me with something new
A candlelight (dinner) and a dozen roses just to name a few (Few, few, few)
You always seem to know the things that I'm feeling
You always give to me the things that I'm needing
I can never let you go
You're the sweetest candy that I'll ever know
You're my..
