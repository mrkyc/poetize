When I won't tell them
They get upset
Breakin' hearts ain't my claim to fame
And if I had a dime for all they've tried
I'd be a millionaire yet
When I'm out hangin' with my friends
People say they think we're cute
When we're together
Yeah, we play to win
And if you're gonna stare
What do we care
So what's it mean to you
No half steppin'
Ya gotta do it right
In the middle of the day, y'all
Or in the middle of the night
No half steppin'
Show just what you got
And don't give up for nothin'
If you think you're hot
I'm not about playing games
I've got too much that I wanna do
Don't have the time to sit down and explain
And if you're gonna try and figure out
Here's what I say to you
You might also likeNo half steppin'
Ya gotta do it right
In the middle of the day, y'all
Or in the middle of the night
No half steppin'
Show just what you got
And don't give up for nothin'
If you think you're hot
No half steppin'
Ya gotta do it right
In the middle of the day, y'all
Or in the middle of the night
No half steppin'
Show just what you got
And don't give up for nothin'
If you think you're hot
No half steppin'
Oooh oooh ooh
Oooh oooh ooh
Ugh
All right
Come on, babe
Baby
That's alright
When I sing
I do my best
To let you know what I feel
When on the stage
I'm put to the test
Ya better believe after you leave
You're gonna know the deal
No half steppin'
Ya gotta do it right
In the middle of the day, y'all
Or in the middle of the night
No half steppin'
Show just what you got
And don't give up for nothin'
If you think you're hot
No half steppin'
Ya gotta do it right
In the middle of the day, y'all
Or in the middle of the night
No half steppin'
Show just what you got
Don't give up for nothin'
