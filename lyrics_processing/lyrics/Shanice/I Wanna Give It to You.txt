Hey Mr. DJ, play a song for me
Something I can groove on to
I wanna spend some time with you
We got all night so, baby, take your time
Make sure what you feel is true
I wanna dance the whole night through
You might also like
Don't you worry about a thing
I'm gonna be right here
'Cause the music feels so good inside
Take it slow and make it last
And baby, have no fear
'Cause I wanna be with you tonight

No questions
Let's have some fun
I wanna give it to you
Give it to you, give it to you, give it to you
Be patient
We'll have good times (Oh yeah)
I wanna give it to you
Give it to you, give it to you, give it to you

Sit back, relax and let the rhythm take control
This time you surely know when I drop the music low
(Give it to you, give it to you)
Tonight's the night to get your boogie on
Keep your head up and stay strong
Let's party to break the dawn
Don't you worry about a thing
Shanice is here
And the music feels so good inside
Take it slow and make it last
And baby, have no fear
'Cause I wanna be with you tonight, baby

No questions
Let's have some fun (Ah yeah)
I wanna give it to you
Give it to you, give it to you, give it to you
Be patient
We'll have good times
I wanna give it to you
Give it to you, give it to you, give it to you
(I wanna)

Oh, I wanna give it to
Give it to you, give it to you, give it to you
You know this song is for the DJ
Now he's the one who keeps the vibe flowing all through the night
So give it up to the DJ
'Cause, baby, the music feels so good inside
No questions
Let's have some fun
I wanna give it to you
Give it to you, give it to you, give it to you
Be patient (Be patient)
