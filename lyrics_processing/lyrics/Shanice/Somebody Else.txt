Whatcha thinking 'bout, what's on your mind?
Baby, don't keep wasting all my time
'Cause your body's here but I know
That your mind is on somebody else
It's feelings you can't hide
Baby, I'm not afraid to be alone
So pack your things, it's time for you to go
'Cause your body's here but I know
That your mind is on somebody else
I got to let you go

Baby, it all got started in the month of June
And that's when I noticed a change in you
You never spend any time with me like we used to
Forget telling me that you love me
'Cause I'm not buying it
And baby, it's no mystery that you're lying to me
You can't run that one on me

I know on the low, you've been around
You think you're fooling me
I can see so easily
I don't have you mentally, so tell me

Tell me why you slipped and called me Regina
(Why, why, why)
Tell me who is she and why are you laying here with me
(Oh, oh)
Tell me what is lipstick doing on your collar
Don't try to say that it's mine
'Cause I heard that old line
You can't run that one on me

You've know all along, you've been around
You think you're fooling me
I can see so easily
Even someone blind can see, so tell me

If you wanna to be a player
Then bye-bye, see you later
'Cause I don't want you
I'd rather be alone
