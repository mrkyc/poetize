Baby, I know
You're ready for love
You gotta be patient with me
For me
'Cause you're my first
I want it to be just like I dreamed

So you know why I've been taking my time
To think about the rest of my life
And yes, I wanna spend it with you
Hope that you're feeling, baby, the same way, too

So don't break my heart
If you do, I'll cry forever
'Cause there's no way I could ever get over you
Not in my lifetime

Baby, there's no
No greater feeling
Greater than being with you
Me and you
Baby, I thirst
For every single drop of your love
Your love
You might also like
And I hope that I'm not wasting my time
I've got better things to do with my life
So I hope you plan to grow old with me
'Cause that's the only
The only way we can be

So don't break my heart
If you do, I'll cry forever
'Cause there's no way I could ever get over you
Not in my lifetime (Not in my lifetime)
Don't break my heart
If you do, I'll cry forever
'Cause there's no way I could ever get over you
Not in my lifetime (Not in my lifetime)

Whoa, promise me you'll watch over me (Watch over me)
Oh, just promise me right here and right now, oh yeah
You know my little heart breaks so easily
So baby, don't leave me
Don't leave me
Don't leave me now

Don't break my heart
If you do, I'll cry forever
'Cause there's no way I could ever get over you
Not in my lifetime (Not in my lifetime)
Don't break my heart
If you do, I'll cry forever
'Cause there's no way I could ever get over you
Not in my lifetime (Not in my lifetime)
My lifetime
My lifetime
