You strut your body around the city
In green suede
You think you're so bad
Hustling girls that want your money
Well, you ain't worth a dime you have, baby
Smooth talking ladies man
Seeking a good time
But you ain't got the goods to play
No, no
Soft touching
Slow hand
Chivalry in man
Are things that sweep a girl away

You ain't all that, baby
You ain't all that, no, no
You ain't all that, honey
You ain't all that, all that

Your Maserati don't impress me
I'm looking for a high speed man
You think you can keep up with me
From what I've seen
I doubt you can
You might also likeDon't tell me that you love me
I see right through your game
I ain't fooled by your desire
If you're half of what you say
Babe, I'd like to play
But you're badder than bad
Cooler than cool
Attitude always gets in the way

You ain't all that, baby
You ain't all that
You ain't all that, oh sugar
You ain't all that
You ain't all that, darling
You ain't all that
You ain't all that
Said you ain't all that

You say you "fell in love at first sight"
Sweet talk me with lies
But I heard you said it
Elsewhere last night
Well, you should know
That I'm no fool
I don't need you
'Cuz, you ain't all that

You thought you was fly
So I had to say goodbye
I gave you a chance
And don't even know why
You ain't nothing
I can find another cutie
'Cause all you wanted
Was my money and my booty
So step off
Get lost
Get off my trip
I don't need you boy
'Cause you ain't legit
You sucker

You ain't all that
You ain't all that, oh sugar
You ain't all that, baby
You ain't all that
You ain't all that, baby
You ain't all that, sugar
You ain't all that, darlin'
You ain't never gonna be the kind of man
Who was on your knees
Begging
Trying to please me
You ain't all that, no, no
You ain't all that

Yeah, you ain't all that
And never will be

Ain't all that?
:
You ain't all that

Well, O.K
It's alright
'Cause that's why you been with it all this time

Yeah
And don't forget to leave my key
Right there on that table

Leave the key on the table?
What?

Yeah, right there, on that table
And while you're at it
Don't call me
Don't call my mother, don't call my father
And don't even give my dog a biscuit

Yo, bow, wow

And by the way
I did cancel all the credit cards

That's cool too
'Cause you're gonna pay all that bills
Peace, I'm outta here

Bye
You ain't all that, baby
