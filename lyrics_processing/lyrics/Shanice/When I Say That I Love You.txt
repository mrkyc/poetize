Every time you get that look on your face
It hurts so much to see your eyes full of questions
Doesn't matter if I tell you each day
How I feel, it doesn't change your suspicions

Can I prove (Can I prove)
You're the one (You're the one)
And that all the others really don't matter
If I show (If I show)
How I care (How I care)
Boy, I gotta tell you something so don't you go nowhere

If you go
What will you do?
Why don't you just try to believe
When I say that I love you
You should trust
You know it's true
I'm not trying to deceive
When I say that I love you

Please, baby, just understand
I know it's hard, the kind of life that I'm living
While I'm standing under all these lights
And everywhere I'm getting guys' attentions
You might also like
Can I prove (Can I prove)
You're the one (You're the one)
I don't care about the others' reaction
If I show (If I show)
How I feel (How I feel)
You'll never find a girl so true
So what you gonna do?

If you go
What will you do? (What will you do?)
Why don't you just try to believe
When I say that I love you
You should trust
You know it's true
I'm not trying to deceive
When I say that I love you
If you go (If you go)
What will you do? (Ooh)
Why don't you just try to believe
When I say that I love you
You should trust
You know it's true
I'm not trying to deceive
When I say that I love you
In a world full of doubts
You're the one that I can count on
Baby, you're my rock
Don't you know what's in my heart
No matter where I reach, you're the star
Break it down
Hey, you got it going on
Hey
Ho, you got it going on
Here we go
Hey, you got it going on
I said a-one, two, three and to the four
Ho, you got it going on
Hey, you got it going on
Ho, you got it going on
Woo
Hey, you got it going on
Ho, you got it going on

If you go
What will you do?
Why don't you just try to believe
When I say that I love you
You should trust
You know it's true
I'm not trying to deceive
When I say that I love you
If you go
What will you do?
Why don't you just try to believe
When I say that I love you
You should trust
You know it's true
I'm not trying to deceive
