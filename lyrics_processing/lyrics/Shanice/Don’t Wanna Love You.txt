Don't wanna touch you
Don't wanna kiss you
Don't wanna miss you
Don't want your name or your number
'Cause I don't wanna give you a call
Don't wanna end up a lover
Oh, I don't wanna know you at all
Because you've all seen my finest qualities
You mess up everything that you ever touch
Because it won't be long before you do something wrong
And I won't stick around and be dogged, that's why I

'Cause I don't wanna end up alone
Won't let you walk on my feelings
I see to you it doesn't matter that you can do me wrong
You know I heard everything 'bout your history
Only a fool would fall in love with you now, yeah
But boy, I just don't think that you'd be, be good for me
And I won't stick around and be dogged
