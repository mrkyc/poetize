Hey you
You know, there's a few things I wanna get off my chest
I know we've been friends for a while
And you know how I feel about you
It's just not fair
And I've been holding back my feelings for so long
I should have never let myself fall in love with you
Now I let you have someone else

Sometimes I wish I had never met you
'Cause I can't have your lovin'
Sometimes I wish I had never met you
'Cause I know, boy, I know that we won't be the two

I have a broken heart, you see
But you're not the one to blame, oh no
'Cause I didn't know how hard it was
Controlling my inner feelings this way

Oh, darling, I know it wasn't right for me
To fall in love with you
(To fall in love with you)
I really didn't want to
(I really didn't want to) No
'Cause it's so very clear to see
That you already got somebody
And I'm not fond of jealousy
But I do believe
You might also like
Sometimes I wish I had never met you
'Cause I can't (I can't) have your lovin'
(Have your lovin')
Sometimes I wish I had never met you
'Cause I know (I know) that we won't be the two

This is such a hurting thing
'Cause you're in my every passing thought
Oh yes, you are (Oh yes, you are)
And I know that you're feeling so guilty
Even though we realized it's not your fault
Oh, it's not your fault, baby

'Cause the one that has your heart right now
She's such a lucky girl
(She's such a lucky girl)
The luckiest in the world
(The luckiest in the world)
'Cause if I had one wish to bring
I'd wish that you'd be here with me
But reality is killing me
Oh, can't you see
Sometimes I wish I had never met you (Oh no)
'Cause I can't (I can't) have your lovin'
(I know it's wrong, oh)
Sometimes I wish I had never met you
('Cause I'm so in love)
'Cause I know that we won't be the two

Listen
Since the day I first saw your face
These feelings that I've tried to replace, baby
Over (Over), over (Over), over again (Over again)
But it's not very easy
You just don't know you've done to me
'Cause I know it's true
No matter what I do
I still love you, I still love you
Baby, I do, oh yeah
I wish that I'd (I wish I'd never)
I'm still in love with you
(I wish I'd never met you)
Baby, I do (I wish I'd never)
I wish I'd never met you, baby
(I wish I'd never met you)
Baby, I do (I wish I'd never)
Loved you
(Sometimes I wish)
Oh, baby
But it's something 'bout you, baby
That turns me on
Don't get me wrong when I say it's true
Sometimes I wish I'd never met you (Hey)
No matter what
I still love you
Don't get me wrong when I say it's true
Sometimes I wish I'd never met you
No matter what (No matter what)
I still love you (I really didn't mean it)
Don't get me wrong when I say it's true
(But it's so hard) Sometimes I wish I'd never met you
(It's so hard)
No matter what (It's so hard to say goodbye)
I still love you
Don't get me wrong when I say it's true
Sometimes I wish I'd never met you (No matter what)
No matter what
(Can I throw away the feeling that I feel about you, baby)
I still love you
