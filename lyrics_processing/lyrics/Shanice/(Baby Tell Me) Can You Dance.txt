Staring into space
Acting like you're grooving
With that look upon your face
I see you smiling at me
You want to know my name
But if you wanna play, boy
You got to play my game
What I really want to know is
Can you dance?
You're talking to your friends
About how good I look
Try to find a number
The phone is in the book
Before you come up to me
To tell me how you feel
I'm wiser than my years
So let me tell you what's the deal
What I really want to know is
Can you dance?

Can you dance
Can you dance
Oh baby, tell me can you dance
I just wanna party
That's what I'm here to do
I didn't come to pick up by the likes of you
But I'll give you a chance
And one is all you get
If you think I'm sassy now, boy
You ain't seen nothin' yet
What I really want to know is
Can you dance?
(What I really want to know)
What I really want to know is
Can you dance
Can you dance
Can you dance
Can you dance
Oh baby, tell me can you dance
Can you dance
Can you dance
Can you dance
Oh baby, tell me can you dance
I see you grooving hearty
Looks like you're having fun
But if you came to party
Start dancing on the one
Get up
If your dance is nothing
You don't need to be here
It ain't about the posing
But the sexy atmosphere
Get with it
You've got to start a fire
If you want to put one out
It's the groove that takes you higher
That's what dance is all about
Now I'm a busy person
No time for playin' games
But if I know you're serious
I'll tell you what's my name
Shanice
Can you dance
Can you dance
Can you dance
Can you dance
Tell me, tell me, tell me can you dance
Can you dance
(Tell me can you)
Can you dance
