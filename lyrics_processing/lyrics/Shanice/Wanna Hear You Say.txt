Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, whoa

Last night we made love
You called my name
And the next morning things weren't the same
Even though you stole my pride
I just can't understand why
My heart and my mind and my soul still loves you

And I wanna hear you say that you love me
I wanna hear you say you care for me
I wanna hear you say that you'll be there for me
That's the way it's supposed to be
And deep inside I know I can't let go
But there's one thing I got to know
Will you be there for me
Like the way it's supposed to be

Correct me if I'm wrong
But this don't feel right
(How could you break my heart and leave this good woman?)
See, I can't stand the pain
After all the love I gave
You took it, smiled and walked away, oh baby
You might also like
Three days passed and there were no phone calls (No phone calls)
I was starting to get this feeling (Feeling)
You weren't feeling me at all (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
The time we spent (Time we spent), boy, it don't make sense (Don't make sense)
That I've fallen in love again
And I don't quite understand why

I wanna hear you say that you love me
(Said I wanna, wanna hear you say)
I wanna hear you say you care for me
(Do you really care for me?)
I wanna hear you say that you'll be there for me
That's the way it's supposed to be
And deep inside I know I can't let go
But there's one thing I got to know
Will you be there for me
Like the way it's supposed to be

Oh, oh, I just don't know why you won't
Say you love me
Why you don't care enough
Not enough to call me
Why
I wanna hear you say that you love me
I wanna hear you say you care for me
I wanna hear you say that you'll be there for me
That's the way it's supposed to be
And deep inside I know I can't let go
But there's one thing I got to know
Will you be there for me
Like the way it's supposed to be
(Will you be there, baby? Yeah)

I wanna hear you say that you love me
(I wanna hear you say)
I wanna hear you say you care for me
(I wanna hear you say)
I wanna hear you say that you'll be there for me
That's the way it's supposed to be
And deep inside I know I can't let go
But there's one thing I've got to know
(To know, to know, to know)
Will you be there for me
Like the way it's supposed to be

(Will you be there for me? Yeah)
I wanna hear you say that you love me
I wanna hear you say you care for me
I wanna hear you say that you'll be there for me
That's the way it's supposed to be
And deep inside I know I can't let go
But there's one thing I've got to know
(Said I wanna know, I really wanna know)
Will you be there for me
