In some crowded place
Or maybe out at a movie?
Too familiar to ignore
But I can't fill the space
Of where we met or how we could be
Maybe it was at the park
At a dance after dark
Or through a friend in the neighborhood
Wherever it may have been
I'm thinking God now for then
'Cause I really do think that I know you
Do I know you?
Is it possible
Do I know you?
(Wondering do I know)
Do I know you?
Is it possible
Do I know you?
I know that I've seen your face before
In some crowded place
Or maybe I'm just dreaming
You might also likeYou're the one I've been looking for
And it's been all my life
And it feel so right
I'm so sure
I've come too far to just pretend
You're the gold at rainbow's end
I'm so glad that I've found you
Please believe and don't say no
Take my hand and don't let go
Let me open the door
Do I love?
Do I know you?
Is it possible
Do I know you?
(Wondering do I know)

I've come too far to just pretend
You're the gold at rainbow's end
I'm so glad that I found you
Please believe and don't say no
Take my hand and don't let go
Let me open the door to our love, baby
Do I know you?
