Ooh
(Yeah, don't matter, just don't fight it)
Ooh
(Uh, uh, don't matter, just don't fight it)
Yeah
(Yeah, don't matter, just don't fight it)
Yeah
(Uh, uh, don't matter, just don't fight it, come on)

I've been in need of some affection
How did I end up in your direction?
You're still friends with my ex-boyfriend
I don't know if I was wrong to pretend
That I never thought of me and you as gettin' it on
Just so happens that I'm still all alone
Know that I've turned you down before
But I won't turn you down no more, baby

If you check me out, you can let me know
I'm not gonna fight it if my heart says so
If you wanna put it down, baby, you should know
I'm not gonna fight it no more (No, no, no, no)
If you wanna check me out, you can let me know
I'm not gonna fight it if my heart says so
If you wanna put it down, baby, you should know
I'm not gonna fight it no more
You might also like
I've been thinkin' 'bout your attention
Ever since the day you began to mention
That you wanted me, oh, so very long
Never really knew you were feeling that strong
It could be confusion with you and your boy
Far as I'm concerned, I ain't there no more
My love, it's been enough time
When I can't get you off my mind, my mind, my mind

If you check me out, you can let me know
I'm not gonna fight it if my heart says so
If you wanna put it down, baby, you should know
I'm not gonna fight it no more
If you wanna check me out (Check me out), you can let me know
I'm not gonna fight it if my heart says so
If you wanna put it down, baby, you should know
I ain't gonna fight it no more

I never thought it would ever be real
Can't stop thinkin' 'bout the way I feel, boy
Never thought of it as right before
But I can't let him keep me unhappy no more
Didn't think it would happen to me
Making a decision over history
Is it wrong to be into you? What am I supposed to do?
And he's not thinkin' 'bout me, baby
Don't fight it
Yeah, don't matter, just don't fight it
Uh, uh, don't matter, just don't fight it
Yeah, don't matter, just don't fight it
Uh, huh, don't matter, just don't fight it
Ooh
Yeah, don't matter, just don't fight it
Ooh
Uh, huh, don't matter, just don't fight it
Yeah, don't matter, just don't fight it
Uh, huh, don't matter, just don't fight it
Baby, if you check me out, you can let me know
I'm not gonna fight it if my heart says so
If you wanna put it down, baby, you should know
I ain't gonna fight it no more, no more
If you wanna check me out (Check me out), you can let me know
I'm not gonna fight it if my heart says so
If you wanna put it down, baby, you should know
I'm not gonna fight it no more, no, no

If you check me out (Won't fight it), you can let me know (I ain't gonna fight it)
I'm not gonna fight it if my heart says so
(Won't fight it, I ain't gonna fight it)
If you wanna put it down (Won't fight it), baby, you should know (I ain't gonna fight it)
I'm not gonna fight it no more
(Won't fight it, I ain't gonna fight it)
If you wanna check me out, you can let me know
I'm not gonna fight it if my heart says so
If you wanna put it down, baby, you should know
