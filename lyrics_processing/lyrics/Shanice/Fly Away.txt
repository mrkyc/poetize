If I had wings I'd fly away
I'd let the stars just guide the way, right to you
Don't care if this journey takes all night
Oh, how my heart yearns to be with you

I thought I would share with you my dreams
I'm still missing you
But instead of just writing you
I'll spread my wings and

Fly like an angel to you
I'll spread my wings like an eagle and fly straight to you
I'm gon' fly like an angel to you
I won't be writing you no letters
Love's gon' bring our souls together

And if by chance that we should meet on an open glide
We'll run away with each other
No looking back, we're headed to our destiny
Someday I hope it will come true
(Someday, will come true, and I)
You might also like
I thought I would share with you my dreams
I'm still missing you (I'm still missing you)
But instead of just writing you
I'll spread my wings and

Fly like an angel to you
I'll spread my wings like an eagle and fly straight to you
I'm gon' fly like an angel to you
Won't be writing you no letters
Love's gon' bring our souls together

And we'll fly (And we'll fly)
Through the sky (Through the sky)
To the sun, to the heavens above
And we'll touch through our love
We'll be closer to heaven
I'll open my wings and

Fly like an angel to you (To you)
I'll spread my wings like an eagle and fly straight to you
I'm gon' fly like an angel to you
Won't be writing you no letters (Won't be writing)
Love's gon' bring our souls together
(Love's gon' bring our souls together)
Fly like an angel to you (Together, together)
I'll spread my wings like an eagle and fly straight to you
(Forever, and ever, and ever, oh)
I'm gon' fly like an angel to you
(Together, together, together)
Won't be writing you no letters
Love's gon' bring our souls together
Fly like an angel to you (Fly, ooh baby)
I'll spread my wings like an eagle and fly straight to you
I'm gon' fly like an angel to you
Won't be writing you no letters
