Everything you do right can't be wrong
Seems that for some reason I can't explain
I lose my composure when I hear your name
Feeling like I wanna know you better
Maybe you and me could get together
There's so many things that we could do
Baby, won't you trust in me and you
Ooh, I think I love you
Think that is the real thing
I think I'm in love
Pulling on my heartstring, baby
Ooh, I think I love you
I think I'm in love
Could you feel the same way too?
Think I'd like to get you to take me home
You could meet my family or we could be alone
Doesn't really matter
I don't care
I could stay forever as long as you are there
Baby, say you'll be mine
Don't say no
I've got all these feelings I'd like to show
Tell me that you love me forevermore
I'll be there for you, baby
That's what I'm going to
You might also likeI think I love you
Think that is the real thing
I think I'm in love
Pulling on my heartstring, baby
Ooh, I think I love you
I think I'm in love
Could you feel the same way?
I think I love you
I think that is the real thing
I think I'm in love
Pulling on my heartstring, baby
Ooh, I think I love you
I think I'm in love
Could you feel the same way?
Life is such a party when you're around
But when I really want you
You can't be found
If you want somebody I truly feel
That I'm the love for you and you know it's real
I think I love you
Think that is the real thing
I think I'm in love
Pulling on my heartstring, baby
Ooh, I think I love you
I think I'm in love
