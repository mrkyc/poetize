I don't need a lover, boy
Baby, I need a man
I told you that
Time and time again
So past
Don't even make me laugh (giggle)
You don't stop
I'm gonna kick your (beep)
See I'm not dependent
On 1-lil'-2 nor-3
Lil indian dreams
You gonna make me scream

Stop cheatin' on me
Stop cheatin' on me
Stop cheatin' on me
Stop cheatin' on me
Cheatin' on me

I thought you were better
But boy, I was wrong
Oh, so wrong
You thought you were so clever
Until you got caught
You might also like
Boy, ain't it a shame
How you've been untrue
Baby, I'm not your fool
I know all about those games
I said it's nothin' new
I'm not gonna be used


Hey, my mama told me
'Bout boys like you
The things you do
You like running so carefree
Doing what you choose

Don't you know I've tried
To believe in you
But you were up to no good
I'm not gonna fuss and fight
What's the use?
I either get it right
Or get it cut loose

Don't come to my house, baby
If you're gonna be a dawg
Just cheatin' on me
Don't come to my house baby
If you're gonna be a dawg
Just cheatin' on me
I don't know who he thinks he is
Dawg

You're playing the roll
Lover boy like ya
High post
With girls in the street
Seems when you try most to
Be all that you can be
But see
I ain't the one to be played
Shanice is picking the pace up
Shoestrings laced up
You know what I'm saying
Stop whining
Keep ya face up
Baby
Gotta believe
It's driving me crazy



Hey, my daddy told me
About the things you do
If you wanna be with me
Here's what you gotta do
Get your act together
Don't play me for no fool
Either get it right
Or get your butt cut loose
