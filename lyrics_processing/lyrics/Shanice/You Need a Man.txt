He's sitting right across from me
You're looking over casually
So I'm pretending not to see
You're tryin' to get his attention
So I decided to keep my cool
Don't wanna cause a scene
But you're out here on a mission to be in my position

Girl, I know you need a man
I could never understand
Why would you play yourself
Making it easier for any man to wanna take you home
Make him wanna do me wrong
But he's not leaving me
You need to forget it go and find yourself a man

Tell me you why'd you wanna be the one
He'd have to creep to see
You know that he's here with me
So tell me what's your intention
I've never been the jealous type
And I won't be the fool tonight
I don't wanna have to act unladylike, oh
You might also like
Girl, I know you need a man
I could never understand
Why would you play yourself
Making it easier for any man to wanna take you home
Make him wanna do me wrong
But he's not leaving me
You need to forget it go and find yourself a man

I know  you to see
Any man you take can be taken from you
Is that the place you wanna be?
Any hearts you break
Your heart can be broken too
Now tell me how would you feel?
If you were in my shoes
And I got to do that to you

Girl, I know you need a man
I could never understand
Why would you play yourself
Making it easier for any man to wanna take you home
Make him wanna do me wrong
But he's not leaving me
You need to forget it go and find yourself a man
Girl, I know you need a man
I could never understand
Why would you play yourself
Making it easier for any man to wanna take you home
Make him wanna do me wrong
But he's not leaving me
You need to forget it go and find yourself a man
