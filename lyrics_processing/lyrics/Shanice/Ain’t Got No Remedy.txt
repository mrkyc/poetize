Tonight, I'm lying here without you
It feels like hell, baby, without your love, your love
And I'm no good less I'm around you
Like you can't tell, baby, you're all I want, I want

I get up and I pick up the phone and
Then I dial your number praying that you ain't gone
Every day I seem to lose a little bit of my mind
I wanna let you go, boy, but I

Ain't got no remedies, baby (No remedies)
It's all 'bout you and me, baby
I feel up, I feel down
I feel altogether emotional
Ain't got no remedies, baby (Got no remedies)
I got it bad, you see, baby
I go in, I go out
I get altogether emotional

My heart can barely beat without you
What is this spell, baby
You've got me on, me on, me on
Can't make no sense of things without you
It never fails, baby
Your love's so strong
(Your love's so strong)
You might also like
Well, I can't eat (I can't see)
I can't sleep (I can't eat)
I can't think (I can't think)
I can't even speak
Every day I seem to lose a little bit of my mind
I wanna let you go, boy, but I

Ain't got no remedies, baby (No remedies)
It's all 'bout you and me, baby
I feel up, I feel down
I feel altogether emotional (No no no no no no)
Ain't got no remedies, baby (No remedies for love)
I got it bad, you see, baby
I go in, I go out
I get altogether emotional

(I can't stop) I can't stop
(I can't go) I can't go
This I can't control (No no no no no no no)
It's taking over me, it's getting under me
But I can't let go 'cause I love you so
I can't eat, I can't sleep, I can't hear, I can't see
I can't think, I can't dream, I can't even speak
I swear I'm 'bout to lose my mind
I wanna let you go, boy, but I
Ain't got no remedies, baby (No remedies)
It's all 'bout you and me, baby
(It's all about you and me)
I feel up, I feel down
I feel altogether emotional
Ain't got no remedies, baby (No remedies)
I got it bad, you see, baby
(I got it bad, you see)
I go in, I go out
I get altogether emotional (Emotional)

Ain't got no remedies, baby
It's all 'bout you and me, baby
(It's all about you and me, oh)
I feel up, I feel down
I feel altogether emotional
Ain't got no remedies, baby (No remedies)
I got it bad, you see, baby
(I got it bad, you see)
I go in, I go out
I get altogether emotional
Ain't got no remedies, baby
It's all 'bout you and me, baby
I feel up, I feel down
I feel altogether emotional (Emotional, oh, oh, ooh)
Ain't got no remedies, baby (No remedies)
I got it bad, you see, baby (For love, no, no)
I go in, I go out
