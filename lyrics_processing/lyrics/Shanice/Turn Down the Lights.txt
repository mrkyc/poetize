I was feeling kinda lonely
And I wanted you to hold me tight
So you better come quickly
Come on over to my house tonight
I'm gonna look real sexy
Gonna be your fantasy
I'll be your lady
'Cause you're so good to me

But first
We'll let the music play
Dancing nice and slow
I'll kiss you and say
How much I want you, baby
Boy, you know you're driving me crazy
I love the way you dance
Baby, it's time for romance

So turn down the lights
Come close to me
I'll give you all that you need
Turn down the lights, baby
And I'll be your fantasy
You might also like
Ooh, I like it when you hold me
When you hold me in your arms like this
And you rock me gently, baby
I feel the passion burning when we kiss
You make me feel so sexy
Oh, so good inside
I'll be your lady
I'll be yours tonight

But first
We'll let the music play
Dancing nice and slow
I'll kiss you and say
How much I want you, baby
Boy, you know you're driving me crazy
I love the way you dance
Baby, it's time for romance, baby

So turn down the lights
Come close to me
I'll give you all that you need
(I'll give you all you need)
Turn down the lights, baby
And I'll be your fantasy
When I'm with you, I'm on top of the world
Knowing you're my man and I'm your girl
Something about the way you love me, baby
Wouldn't change if I could
I've got to have you right now 'cause you feel so good

Turn down the lights
Come close to me (Come close)
I'll give you all that you need
(I'll give you all you need)
Turn down the lights, baby
And I'll be your fantasy
(I'll be, I'll be your fantasy, yeah, oh)
Turn down the lights
(Turn down, turn down)
Come close to me
(You gotta come a little closer)
I'll give you all that you need
Turn down the lights, baby
And I'll be your fantasy
(I love you, baby; love you, baby; love you, baby)
Turn down the lights
Come close to me
I'll give you all that you need
(All you need)
Turn down the lights, baby
And I'll be your fantasy
Turn down the lights
Come close to me
I'll give you all that you need
Turn down the lights, baby
And I'll be your fantasy
Turn down the lights
