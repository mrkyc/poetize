Once again, the sun is shining in this loving heart of mine
I feel nothing but joy, heaven's blessed me with child
Life is full of happiness, little things don't get me down
I learned more about myself since you came around

You mean the world to me, my baby
You've given me a new air to breathe, you make my life complete
You're everything I dream, oh baby (Oh yeah)
I'm so thankful to you
I can't imagine

I can't imagine my life without you
I can't imagine, I can't imagine it
I can't imagine my life without you (Can't imagine)
I can't imagine my life without you
I can't imagine, can't even fathom it
I can't imagine my life without you

Every time I look at you, I see a reflection of myself
I'm amazed that I could give life to somebody else
You're a precious gift, an angel with no disguise
Love has different meaning with you in my life
You might also like
You mean the world to me, my baby
You've given me a new air to breathe, said you make my life complete
You're everything I dreamed, oh baby
And I'm so thankful to you
Can't imagine, yeah

I can't imagine my life without you
I can't imagine, I can't imagine it
I can't imagine my life without you
(No-no-no, no-no-no, no, no, no, no, no)
I can't imagine my life without you
I can't imagine, can't even fathom it
I can't imagine my life without you

Your love makes my world go 'round
Because of you, I have found
No more time, it's only light
Brighter days are now in sight
And I'm glad you are my destiny
This love is pure, not make-believe
You are my everything
Without you, I can't imagine
No, no, no-no-no, no, no, no
Can't imagine, can't imagine
I can't imagine my life without you
I can't imagine, I can't imagine it (Can't imagine it)
I can't imagine my life without you
(No-no-no, no-no-no, no, no, no, no, no)
I can't imagine my life without you
I can't imagine, can't even fathom it (My precious little baby)
I can't imagine my life without you (Oh, oh)
I can't imagine my life without you
I can't imagine, I can't imagine it (You're my baby)
I can't imagine my life without you (You're my destiny)
I can't imagine my life without you
I can't imagine (My life), can't even fathom it (My life)
I can't imagine my life without you (I can't imagine my life without you, baby)

I can't imagine my life without you
I can't imagine, I can't imagine it
I can't imagine my life without you (Can't imagine)
I can't imagine my life without you
I can't imagine, can't even fathom it
I can't imagine my life without you
I can't imagine my life without you
