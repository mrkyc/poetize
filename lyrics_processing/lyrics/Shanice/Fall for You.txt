There's a right or wrong to know for everything
And the truth is somewhere written in between
But there's always something missing in the dark
There you'll find the true condition of the heart
Well, I can visualize the pieces of a dream
And it's not as far away as it may seem
But if truth be told, it's you that holds the key
To the question that defines my destiny

I've been in love, a time or two
I've seen the world, but not with you
I wanna fly, and spread my wings
Don't wanna cry, I wanna sing
I wanna live, and take a chance
I'm not afraid, to love again
I wanna fall, fall for you
And I want you to fall for me, too
Me too, me too

I've had plenty conversations with my heart
'Cause I want this thing to work, not fall apart
So I ask my heart how it can be so sure
And it answers me because your heart is pure
You might also like
I have every expectation that it's true
'Cause my heart won't lie to me, much less to you
But if truth be told, it is you that holds the key
To the future that becomes our destiny, whoa, no, no, no

I've been in love (Been in love), a time or two (Time or two)
I've seen the world (Seen the world), but not with you (Not with you)
I wanna fly (Fly), and spread my wings
Don't wanna cry (Cry), I wanna sing (Wanna sing)
I wanna live, and take a chance
I'm not afraid, to love again (Love again)
I wanna fall, fall for you (Fall for you)
And I want you to fall for me, too

To the mountain snow that melts into the stream
My heart flows like the river to the sea
To the heavens up above
I pray to God our destiny is love

I've been in love (Been in love), a time or two (Time or two)
I've seen the world (Seen the world), but not with you (Not with you)
I wanna fly (Fly), and spread my wings
Don't wanna cry (Cry), I wanna sing (Wanna sing)
I wanna live, and take a chance
I'm not afraid, to love again (Love again)
I wanna fall, fall for you (Fall for you)
And I want you to fall for me, too
And I want you to fall for me, too
Me too, me too, me too
