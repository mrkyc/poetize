You don't have to worry 'bout a damn thang, ladies
You deserve a man that'll bend over backwards
And buy you all those things that every woman dreams
Like Gucci bags, Cartier, a Escalade and diamond rings

Ladies, I got a little story to tell you
'Bout the things that I've gone through
I said, ladies (Ladies)
I've been through some mess in my life
And I wanna break it down for you
I had a man who would take my Mercedes
To go visit other ladies, but y'all don't hear me now
And then I had a man
Who gave me a diamond ring and took it back
But y'all didn't know all that, no, no
And now I have a man
Who loves me no matter what, his love is unconditional
Ladies, you deserve the best (You deserve the best)
So don't you settle for less, no, no

You don't have to worry 'bout a damn thang, ladies
You deserve a man that'll bend over backwards
And buy you all those things that every woman dreams
Like Gucci bags, Cartier, a Escalade and diamond rings

Ain't nothing wrong with having the finer things in life
Now I got a man who asked me to be his wife
And when I had his babies, I gained a little weight
But my man told me that I still look like a figure eight, yeah
Love comes from within, remember that, my friend
I would never tell you wrong, if your man acts up, he gone
You deserve the best (You deserve the best)
Oh-oh, and don't you settle for less, you don't have to worry

You don't have to worry 'bout a damn thang, ladies
You deserve a man that'll bend over backwards
And buy you all those things that every woman dreams
Like Gucci bags, Cartier, a Escalade and diamond rings
You don't have to worry 'bout a damn thang, ladies
You deserve a man that'll bend over backwards
And buy you all those things that every woman dreams
Like Gucci bags, Cartier, a Escalade and diamond rings

Girls, let me talk to you for a minute (You don't have to worry, no)
The guys that I was with in the past had me feeling like I was less than a woman
I thought I didn't deserve the best
But the man that I got now, huh
He makes me feel like a Nubian queen
You don't have to settle for less, oh, no
Oh-ooh-oh
You don't have to worry
You don't have to worry 'bout a damn thang, ladies
You deserve a man that'll bend over backwards
And buy you all those things that every woman dreams
Like Gucci bags, Cartier, a Escalade and diamond rings
You don't have to worry 'bout a damn thang, ladies
You deserve a man that'll bend over backwards
And buy you all those things that every woman dreams
Like Gucci bags, Cartier, a Escalade and diamond rings

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
No-no, no-no, no-no, no-no-no-no
