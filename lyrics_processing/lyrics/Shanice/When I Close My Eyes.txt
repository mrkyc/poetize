Yeah, yeah, yeah

Darling, here we are again
Right about now
There is a need to tell you what I'm feeling
I'm so grateful
To have a man like you
Who knows what to do
And makes me feel like a woman should
Oh, yeah

When I close my eyes
I break down and cry
It's something 'bout the way you love me
The thought of your kiss
My heart can't resist
It's all about the way you love me

Never thought that I would find
So much peace of mind
In every moment that I share with you
Sometimes, I don't know why
We fell so deep in love
But then it all comes back to me, because
You might also like
When I close my eyes
I break down and cry
It's something 'bout the way you love me (Yeah-yeah)
The thought of your kiss
My heart can't resist
It's all about the way you love me

When I'm with you (I'm with you)
I feel so good (So good)
No one loves me like you do (Yeah)

(When I close my eyes)
When I close my eyes (My eyes)
I break down and cry (I break down and cry)
It's something 'bout the way you love me
The thought of your kiss (Your kiss)
My heart can't resist
It's all about the way you love me (Yeah)
When I close my eyes (When I close my eyes)
I break down and cry (I break down and cry)
It's something 'bout the way you love me (It's something 'bout the way, yeah)
The thought of your kiss (Your kiss)
My heart can't resist (Resist)
It's all about the way you love me (It's all about the way you love me, yeah)
When I close my eyes (My)
I break down and cry
It's something 'bout the way you love me ('Bout the way you love me)
The thought of your kiss (Your kiss)
My heart can't resist (Resist)
