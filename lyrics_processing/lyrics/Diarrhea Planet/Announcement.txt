Try and tell me how I should live my life
I just want to cruise and if I lose control
I'll find a better way to make it right
What's so wrong about picking and choosing the parts
That fall in line with my moods
Isn't that what everybody does most days
Is there actually anything
Rude truth
Which you can hear ringing
Good excuse
Shouting from someone who knows something
It's bigger and better than just being 
And keep it up all day long
So what makes a man spend his dollars 
Why do the words fall to their knees
What gives him strength

Who don't the wolves just stay asleep
You can tune into the station
To feel a different vibration but the frequency remains

Try to keep it up high so it'll go down low
Stay awake til

You can waste an entire lifetime
Searching for a fool's gold
Or you can look inside yourself and find what's in you all along
But you are the one with the strength to break down walls put up in the faces of fear
To overcome 
To hold on to 
And I feel so washed up when I'm hitting God up for a favor again
And I feel beat down when im throwing one out to the Holy Ghost with my friends
Cause most of these prayers I treat like a child wishing on a fallen star
And I'm always asking for just a little bit more
I go to sleep 
Since 
Spending all this time 
When it's time 
While we just tell the whole world who we are
What's so wrong about saying I have no idea
Who's to say if I can't win I lose
Sometimes 
So what
