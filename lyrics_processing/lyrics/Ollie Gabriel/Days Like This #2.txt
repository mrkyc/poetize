Now will the real world please stand up
I know some of y'all out there still givin' a fuck
Teacher's pay is still taking the cut, while these rappers throwing money they still living it up
Am I the only one who really see whats goin' on?
Or is it the conspiracy that keep us going wrong?
Either way it's still getting harder
For me to see a brighter future for my son and daughter
Media dumbing us down, gotta get smarter
The world needs change and I don't mean quarters
And in a way I guess I'm droppin' dimes
But shit we running out of time, read between the lines(problem is)
That most people won't even look so if you wanna hide Something, put it in a book
'Cus if it ain't no CNN then people gon' probably doubt it
Know I'm preaching to the choir but I just gotta speak about it

I turn on the news and I could just cry
'Cus all of my people got just enough to get by
(Yeeaah) Seen a whole lot of things I'll never forget
But ohh I,  I never seen days like this, no never seen days like this, ohh
I never seen days like this, no never seen days like this(x2)

Uh, another day same situation
50 mill, still searching for an occupation
And everybody else 'cross the nation
Just tryna keep gas in they transportation
Young soldier go to war, its manipulation
While his grandma can't afford an operation
Damn, we got a problem in the land
And I ain't saying I got the plan, but I'm just tryna understand
How a country losin' jobs and money in every way
To turn around and spend a billion dollars a day
Yeah, we at war with the terrorists, but the terrorists at home is the scariest
Look around, terror right outside your backdoor
We so dumb, we elect him for another four
Kickin' down your door, belly of the beast still hungry and they want more
More poverty, more world pollution
More power, no constitution
Seems like the only solution, is revolution
