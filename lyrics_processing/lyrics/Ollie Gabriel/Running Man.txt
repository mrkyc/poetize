See, I was born without no shoes
I told a hospital doc to cut me lose
And just as soon as my legs can move
I told my momma that was all I had to do

C'mon I hope my feet don't fail me
Feet don't fail me
Feet don't fail me now
I hope my feet don't fail me
Feet don't fail me now
Feet don't fail me now

Cause I'm a running running running running running man
I'm a running man
Running running running running running man
Cause I'm a running man
Cause I'm a running running running running running man
Running man
Running running running running running man

See I was running it up hero
I had a lot of friends I had to let go
Cause they were trying to keep me back
But I was move away to fast (to fast)
