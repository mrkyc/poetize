Tell me what's it gonna be if dis ain't what you want
I call it how I see it, so dis ain't what you want
I'm on the road, I'm doin' shows, so wealthy, dis ain't what you want
Hit the road, you can go, I know, dis ain't what you want
I hear them niggas after me, but dis ain't what you want (Dis ain't what you want)
And I guarantee dis ain't what you want
I'm from the land where ain't no lackin' at, dis ain't what you want
I wrap 'em up, we get 'em done 'cause dis ain't what you want, Ls

Niggas claim that they after me, but dis ain't what they want
'Cause I hopped into this industry, dis ain't what they want
See, this rap shit ain't shit to me, dis ain't what they want
I got the police all into me, dis ain't what they want
In my own city, they hate on me, put weight on me
Fuck TMZ, fuck breaking news and ABC
I can't do no shows 'cause I terrify my city
They say I terrify my city
Niggas get slumped, we the first to get blamed
A nigga try us, he the first one to get changed
They say he snitched, tryna put dirt on my name
They ride on me, ask is Lil Durk my name, Ls

Daddy doin' life, snitches doin' months
I'm screamin' free the real 'cause dis ain't what you want
A nigga claim 300, add a K, you done
I'm really in the field 'cause this what I want (This what I want)
I'ma turn the streets up, this is a anthem
Niggas hate on my squad, I tell 'em step the shit up (L, Ls)
Same since day one and I can't change up
After all of the gossip, I'll still'll change some
Fuck niggas don't want none (Niggas don't want it)
They don't want it
Same nigga since day one
Nigga, I'm 3Hunna, L, Ls
