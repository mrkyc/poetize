(Chopsquad)

You want me to lose
No, I'm not perfect and I deserve it, take it personal
You scream my name in the middle of Spain like Durkio
I got a story, got a movie, but nobody know
Believe me, I'm real, believe me, I'm trill for real, you should know
Nobody know, nobody know, nobody know
Nobody know, nobody know, nobody know
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Nobody know
Ooh, ooh, ooh

Young nigga, I had a curfew
What you don't know won't hurt you
You told police I hurt you
Like fuck that bitch who birthed you
Y'all had me at my lowest
I love my brothers who snaked me but I don't wanna show it
Can't fuck with you, I'm honest
Locked in that cell, my first son, I ain't get to see him potty
I'm off them drugs when I get mad, I say I'm goin' Scottie
Take off them Guccis in the trenches, I wear Foamposites
Lawyer fees and bond money, I drop big deposits
I drop big deposits, I like my ho exotic
My gun get molestic, they bound to catch a body
My homie got bodied, I keep they mamas happy
My kids, they goin' to college, I sold dope at Giuseppe's (Chopsquad)
Allah, come help me, mhm, I'm healthy
Mhm, I'm wealthy, mhm, drink filthy
Niggas don't get it, niggas ain't with it
Bitches want attention, I told 'em they can't get it

You scream my name in the middle of Spain like Durkio

Believe me, I'm real, believe me, I'm trill for real, you should know
Nobody know, nobody know, nobody know
Nobody know, nobody know, nobody know
Ooh, ooh, ooh

Ooh, ooh, ooh

They ain't love you like I love you
You told me you ain't trust 'em
And you only believe in me, told you they say fuck you
Look what they did to the muscle, best believe these niggas gon' touch you
Give the pussy up for free, shawty know I'ma tussle
You my brother for life
Man, that shit don't sit right with me
Niggas say they gon' ride with me
When you died, I was on your side
Mama, I need you
Your son, he needs you
Your son is evil, they think they equal
These niggas don't get it
Gotta ride around in my city
Can't let them get me, ridin' 'round with my .50 (Chopsquad)
Thirty Percs got me dizzy
Got my gun, got one on top
Keep niggas in my business, ain't no rules to the trenches
I just don't need annoyin' folk
If you can't be, ayy, if you can't be yourself, folk, make your own decisions, I be like I'm cool

You want me to lose
No, I'm not perfect and I deserve it, take it personal
You scream my name in the middle of Spain like Durkio
I got a story, got a movie, but nobody know
Believe me, I'm real, believe me, I'm trill for real, you should know
Nobody know, nobody know, nobody know
Nobody know, nobody know, nobody know
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Nobody know
