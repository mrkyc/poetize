But if I call you my brother, that mean you my brother, you know what I'm sayin'?
Nothin' more, nothin' less, family
I've been hearin' too many rumors in these streets, niggas sayin' they gon' kill us, rob us, all that
But it be the niggas that been around us, you know what I'm sayin'? Or be around us
We ain't gon' slip up, we ten toes (Remy)
You know what I'm sayin'? You know we gotta make it out
That's how they go get it (Will-Will-Will-William), yeah

I get so high, I put these drugs into my system
I love you with all my heart, ain't no probably
You choose your life over your son, that shit killed him
I never asked you for anything, just your honesty
How you trade on me like that? I'm your family
And she tryna chase a bag, foe, I had to leave
But two wrongs don't make it right
Get with your dog and make it right

We do pop-ups, had my back when I was locked up
I was Glocked up, niggas hate 'cause they can't stop us, no, no
We was turnt up, gang war, can't knock us
Slidin' in no DMs, tryna slide up on the oppers, yeah
I'm so nauseous off them drugs, too high off them Percocets
Tryna follow behind my cousin, I wasn't focused yet
We'll rob the robbers, kill the killers, label us a threat
Extort your big homie like we from LAX
I was so high, I wish I replied to L'A text
But we had jumped into them streets and made a mess
I was dressin' my homies up for they funerals
Holdin' on they OGs tight, they did the most
Duckin' from investigation, tryna keep my reputation
Give 'em my expiration, lookin' for inspiration
Pray for my generation, fuck 12, them bitches racist
Bought 'Raris just to race it, yeah, yeah

Joke and laugh all day to stop from cryin'
Keep my gun on me to stop from dyin'
Can't listen to no rumors 'cause it block my mind
Can't feed into that bullshit, I ain't got the time
I know what I did, boy, this life I enjoy
Why you pretend, boy? This shit, I live for it, uh-huh
You was hooked on drugs, I was hooked on phonics
Signed to the streets, I ain't never go to college
Asked you for cash, you ain't never say you got it damn
But I gave you my last, yeah
And I'm the same nigga since last year
I told my mama I can't go down for this case
Got the same lawyer beat R. Kelly piss case
State's attorney want me so bad
At the time I need you bad
Told myself I ain't goin' back
Told myself can't go like that
I get so high, I put these drugs into my system
I love you with all my heart, ain't no probably
You choose your life over your son, that shit killed him
I never asked you for anything, just your honesty
How you trade on me like that? I'm your family
And she tryna chase a bag, foe, I had to leave
But two wrongs don't make it right
