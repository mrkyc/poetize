Oh (Malik on the beat)
(Ayo Bleu)
No, no, no, no
Yeah (Aura)
No, no, no, no (Turn Me Up Josh)
Woah, oh, oh

Them niggas act like they don't need us
They do everything we do, they wanna be us
Foenem takin' ecstasy, they tryna T up
He rather go and blow a bag instead of re-up
You wasn't on that block when that shit was goin' on
I wasn't worried about the other side when that shit was goin' on
And we don't hang with different niggas, don't ask us what we on
The only time we'll beat the case, we pull out camera phones
I used to draw Lil Moe name on the Styrofoam
I had to teach the grown niggas right from wrong
What the state had told the jury? They tryna indict us all
The lawyers got them affidavits, they better sign them all, hmm
I had a bad bitch off the 'Gram, she let her titties hang
She told Bandz I bought her a Birkin, I told her anything
I was ridin' 'round with guns in that Bentley thing
We puttin' stickers on our drums, that's a city thing
I hate the niggas who be tryna switch the block up
I be with the killers who'll change a nigga roster
I'm from the part of the city, watch your partner
You ain't did shit to the same nigga who shot ya
'Fore you leave that door, you gotta pick your Glock up
Can't nut in no more whores, I got that from my mama
I'm shuttin' down the stores, you do that with these commas
They had me at my lowest, I'm ridin' 'round with choppers

Close that backdoor, I can't get snaked out by my homie (No, no, no, no, no, yeah, yeah)
Close that backdoor 'cause I know that shit's phony (No, no, no, no, no, woah)
Close that backdoor, can't get snaked by my homie (Oh)

That's a bet
I'm The Voice, that mean Dede, he The Threat
Don't get stretched 'cause foenem tweakin' off the X
I know what happened to your homie, don't be next
He got that get back for his block, I tip my hat
Feel like I'm drownin', got this water 'round my neck
Cocky nigga, throwin' ashes on Pateks
Went to the trenches, threw up the treys on the Met (Yeah)
They be callin' me, you hangin' where it's dangerous
I'm just slidin' to out west just for Uncle Remus
All my sibling's kids know your uncle famous
I know this shit sound dumb and the strangest
In the trenches, I feel the safest
On the radio, shoutout Nehpets
Did it off the love, but I gave 'em faces

(Oh)
Close that backdoor, I can't get snaked out by my homie (No, no, no, no, no, yeah, yeah)
Close that backdoor 'cause I know that shit's phony (No, no, no, no, no, woah)
Close that backdoor, can't get snaked by my homie (Oh)
Close that backdoor 'cause I know this love phony (Oh)
Close that backdoor, I can't get snaked out by my homie (No, no, no, no, no, yeah, yeah)
