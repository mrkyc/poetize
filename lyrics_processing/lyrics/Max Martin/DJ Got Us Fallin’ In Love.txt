So we back in the club
With our bodies rockin' from
Side to side, side-side to side, uh
Thank God the week is done
I feel like a zombie
Gone back to life, back-back to life

Hands up, uh
Yeah, suddenly, we all got our hands up, uh
No control of my body
Ain't I seen you before?
I think I remember those eyes, eyes, eyes
Eyes, eye-eyes

'Cause baby, tonight
The DJ got us falling in love again
Yeah, baby, tonight
The DJ got us falling in love again
So dance, dance like it's the last, last night
Of your life, life, gon' get you right
'Cause baby, tonight
The DJ got us falling in love again
Keep downin' drinks like there's no tomorrow
There's just right, now, now, now
Now, now, now, now
Gon' set the roof on fire
Gonna burn this motherf***** down, down, down
Down, down, down, down (Come on)

Hands up, uh

Put your hands on my body
Swear I've seen you before

Eyes, eye-eyes

The DJ got us falling in love again
Yeah, baby, tonight
The DJ got us falling in love again
So dance, dance like it's the last, last night
Of your life, life, gon' get you right
'Cause baby, tonight
The DJ got us falling in love again

'Cause baby, tonight
The DJ got us falling in love again
Yeah, baby, tonight
The DJ got us falling in love, falling in love, o-oh
So dance, dance like it's the last, last night
Of your life, life, gon' get you right
