All of the people in the same boat, they know that something don't feel right
And she's been creepin' up on my mind, and she dreams of America, America
I heard you been to California, pretty boys well they been doin' nothin' for ya
Oh, and we've been sleeping in the same nest
You give me something that I never had
Chorus I:
If it makes me feel right well, if it takes me all night, oh
I'm gonna take her from another lover, I'm gonna take her from another lover
She dreams of America, America. Sweet dreams of America, America
Verse II:
If there was ever any doubt left, then it was conquered by the street light
And if he lays another hand on your, I'm gonna make him wish he never did
Bridge I:
And now I'm losing control, I've gotta let her know
It's getting bigger, and it's bigger than us, bigger than what I have been
Chorus II:
If it makes me feel right well, if it takes me all night, oh
I'm gonna take her from another lover, I'm gonna take her from another lover
She dreams of America, America. Sweet dreams of America, America
She dreams of America, America. Sweet dreams of America, America
