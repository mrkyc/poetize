With your motor running high or low
With a high rise view of the city below
And a jag on the basement floor
Oh lord, oh lord
With the evening coming and a bag on the go
I've got your number in my mobile phone
I've got a driver coming at a quarter to eight
With a bottle on the patio
Oh lord, oh lord
Even the way that I comb my hair was once adapted to screen
They said the way I held myself from afar, well that just hadn't been seen
So excuse me if I feel apathetic
And show you something you once thought that you had
Bet you never seen this before
Bet you never seen this before
Bet you never seen this before
Bet you never seen this before
I wanna feel you getting close
When you need me most I'm gone
Lost in the moment drop out a sign
To your place, you're just alone
Oh lord, oh lord
You might also likeWell you can say what you want but it's plain to see
That what I am, you will never be
No, I'm not just a pretty face on the scene
Within every page I'm an enemy
Oh lord, oh lord
Even the way that I comb my hair was once adapted to screen
They said the way I held myself from afar, well that just hadn't been seen
So excuse me if I feel apathetic
And show you something you once thought that you had
Bet you never seen this before
Bet you never seen this before
Bet you never seen this before
No, you never seen this before
Give me some sugar, yeah
Bet you never seen this before
Bet you never seen this before
Bet you never seen this before
Bet you never seen this before
Even the way that I comb my hair was once adapted to screen
They said the way I held myself from afar, well that just hadn't been seen
So excuse me if I feel apathetic
And show you something you once thought that you had
Bet you never seen this before
Bet you never seen this before
Bet you never seen this before
Bet you never seen this before
Bet you never seen this before
Bet you never seen this before
