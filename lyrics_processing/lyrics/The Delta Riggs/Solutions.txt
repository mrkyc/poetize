Marching down the streets. confusion in this town
I got blisters on my feet
I have a wall that won't come down
I got nothing in my pockets
I got love still in my heart
And if you said that you can save me
I couldn't tell you where to start

And it's all right, peace out
Where do you go when the chips are going?
To an all-night get down
Pay it on forward 'til my friends come
And if this ever gets old
I heard that up on Mars, they're building homes

Well, I was chatting to a vagrant
Who was drifting in the dark
He pulled a knife on my friend Fletcher
And robbed a beggar in the park
He said, "You're not here to judge me
You know it hurts me when you stare"
I said, "I'm here to offer shelter
I'm only here because I care"

And it's all right, peace out
Where do you go when the chips are going?
To an all-night get down
Pay it on forward till my friends come
And if this ever gets old
I heard that up on Mars, they're building homes

And it's all right (Oh, oh, oh)
Pay it on forward, it's all right (Oh, oh, oh, yeah)
And it's all right (Oh, oh, oh)
Pay it on forward, it's all right (Oh, oh, oh, yeah)
Yeah, yeah

And it's all right, peace out
Where do you go when the chips are going?
To an all-night get down
Pay it on forward till my friends come
And if this ever gets old
I heard that up on Mars, they're building homes

Yeah, come on, come on
And it's all right, woo
Yeah, it's all right
Pay it on forward, it's all right
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
And it's all right, all right
Uh, uh, oh
It's all right (Oh, oh, oh)
Pay it on forward, it's all right (Oh, oh, oh, yeah)
Yeah
Pay it on forward, it's all right (Oh, oh, oh, yeah)
You and me, it's cool
