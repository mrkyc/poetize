Girl, it's your sole occupation
To be treatin' me right
I'm not the one for stipulation
And I'm a flash in the night, yeah
I see you coming 'round in a casual way
I wanna bring you closer without reading the play
You're looking kinda scared, boy you're told to survive
You're frontin' like you're tough, but you're wanting to hide

Alright, okay, I see it in your eyes
You wanna be my babe
And all your friends are gonna be like
"Hey girl, that's fresh, I see him on your arm and he must be the best"
The baddest motherfucker in the beehive

Girls (Can I take you home, boy, can I take you home)
Girls (Can I take you home, boy, can I take you home)

Well baby, I'm on time and I'm feeling my best
You caught me kinda early, I'm not ready for bed
I came to raise the bar, I feel bad for who's next
So give me a few hours and I'll send you a text
You might also like
