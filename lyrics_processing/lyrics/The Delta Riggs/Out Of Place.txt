Our town, okay
Our town, okay

Grab an inch, and take a mile
A mile that'll last all day
I got it from a friend of mine
A friend that'll never stay
So, I take your picture
We haven't met yet
But it's sure nice to meet ya'
We can hang out and get high
Behind the bleachers
And if it's rainin' we'll just stay inside the house instead
[Chorus}
I'm feeling like you're so far out of place
Why don't you come over?
I'd sure like to see ya'
I'm feeling like you're so far out of place
Why don't you come over?
I'm dying to see ya'
You might also like
I got time on my hands
That's pretty much all I have
And I, I wake up every d-day
To waste my time away
So, we steal Bacardi
And on the weekend take it to a house party, yup
'Cos we're so lucky
When I'm talking to you, girl
My hands are sweaty
And I don't know what to say
[Chorus}
I'm feeling like you're so far out of place
Why don't you come over?
I'd sure like to see ya'
I'm feeling like you're so far out of place
We could take a boat to Santa Maria
Feeling like you're so far out of place
Why don't you come over?
I'd sure like to see ya'
I'm feeling like you're so far out of place
We could take a boat to Santa Maria
We'd be sailin' away
Why don't you come over?
I'd sure like to see ya'
Okay, our town
Why don't you come over?
I'm dying to see ya'
[Chorus}
I'm feeling like you're so far out of place
Why don't you come over?
I'd sure like to see ya'
I'm feeling like you're so far out of place
Why don't you come over?
I'm dying to see ya'
I'm feeling like you're so far out of place
Why don't you come over?
I'd sure like to see ya'
I'm feeling like you're so far out of place
We could take a boat to Santa Maria
We'd be sailin'
