You're gettin' in the way of what I'm feelin'

Sister girl, I know you don't understand
But you're gonna have to understand he's my man now
What you had is gone, our thing is sweet
Our thing is stronger than any lie you can tell on me
He knows my heart and that's the part
Your roots are dug up, so you might as well give up
I see your intentions, you can't handle the truth
He let you go a long time ago, now it's time to turn him loose

You're gettin' in the way of what I'm feelin'
(You're gettin' in my way)
You're gettin' in the way of what I'm feelin'
You're gettin' in the way of what I'm feelin'
(My feelings, you're)
You're gettin' in the way of what I'm feelin'
(You're gettin' in the way of what I'm feelin')

Sugar honey girl, fly, fly away
I've been a lady up to now, don't know how much more I can take
Queens shouldn't swing, if you know what I mean
But I'm 'bout to take my earrings off, get me some Vaseline

(I'm 'bout to go off in your face, girl, you better chill)
Chill and I mean it
(You better back down before you get smacked down, you better chill)
You better relax yourself
(I'm 'bout to go off in your face, girl, you better chill)
He's my man, girl, nobody else's
(You better back down before you get smacked down, you better chill)
You better back down

You're gettin' in the way of what I'm feelin'
(You're gettin' in my way of what I'm feelin')
You're gettin' in the way of what I'm feelin'
(You're gettin' in my way, you better back down)
You're gettin' in the way of what I'm feelin'
(You're gettin' in my the way)
You're gettin' in the way of what I'm feelin'

Everything was beautiful between me and him (You're gettin' in my way of what I'm feelin')
And here come you and your big mouth talkin' about me
(You better back down before you get smacked down, you better chill)
Telling him that you've seen me up twenty-forth street (You're gettin' in my way of what I'm feelin')
(You better back down before you get smacked down, you better chill)
With them other cats, but you know that's a lie
You keep lyin' to my man, girlfriend (You're gettin' in my way of what I'm feelin')
(You better back down before you get smacked down, you better chill)
I'm gon' take you out in the middle of the street and whoop your tail (You're gettin' in my way of what I'm feelin')
(You better back down before you get smacked down, you better chill)
For it's worth $5.99 or somethin' like that
(You better back down before you get smacked down, you better chill)
(You better back down before you get smacked down, you better chill) You're gettin' in my way of what I'm feelin'
