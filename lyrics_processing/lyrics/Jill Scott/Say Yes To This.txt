Here I stand
A woman
Talking to her man
I know you're my man

In the deepest, sweetest parts of me
Where I can't pretend
I want you for always
Ain't no reason
To try and navigate around
A dream coming to fruition
I need your decision now

Cause I'm standing here with my soul in my hand
Oh, everybody 'round here wants me
I think you can, and you should
We could be so happy, baby
I'll be your ever-lovin' woman
You'll be my ever-lovin' man
I'll be your angel and your best friend
(What?)
Wait a minute, what did you say?
(What?)
How, how you gonna say no (What?)
How you gonna say no to me?

Ooh (Say no to this)
I can't believe it (Say no to this)
I can't conceive of this (Go, go, go)
Oooh, how (Oh no, say no to this)
How (Oh no, say no to this)
How you gonna say no (Oh no, say no to this)
Oh (Oh no, say no to this)
Oh baby, say yes

Ooh, I'm so wide open, and so is my dress

Um, hey, baby
There's no such thing as perfection
But I'm offering my love and a genuine connection
You can have my loyalty and all of my affection
You're looking everywhere, but every road will lead to my direction
Don't play play, ain't no cause for you to ever say nay
I'm a freak with technique, but the epitome of a lady
I'm the element of surprise, you can call me Eureka!
I'll make you buzz when I put this bass on your tweeter

Ooooh, I'm standing here with my heart in my hands
Oh baby, baby, don't you understand
We could be so happy
I'll be your ever-lovin' woman
You'll be me ever-lovin' man
I'll be your angel and your best friend
How, how, how (Say no to this)
How you gonna say no to this? (Say no to this)
Ow, I'm standing here, baby
Oh (Say no to this)
Don't say no (Say no to this)
Don't say no (Go, go, go)
I love you so, I love you, baby (No!)
Oh (Say no to this)
How (No! Say no to this)
How (No!)
Don't say no to this (Say no to this. No!)
(Say no to this)

Here I stand
A woman (go, go, go)
Talking to her man

It appears to me that you're on some bullshit
You better get a grip and you better get it quick
