We at the family reunion
Tellin' jokes and playin' spades
Uncle Dave is on the barbeque grill
Grandma braggin' bout the blanket she made
For the new baby on her way
Even though the daddy ain't really ready
This child is coming anyway yeah
Neicy made her famous potato salad
Somehow it turns out green
Maybe it's all the scallions
Could be the celery
But oh Uncle Jerome loves it (Hmm)
Hey baby baby, here comes my favorite, my favorite cousin
He says he doing fine, taking it one step a day
But in my heart I know it ain't that way

Whoa whoa-o-whoa whoa-o-whoa whoa-o-whoa
What can you say? It's family
And whoa whoa-o-whoa whoa-o-whoa whoa-o-whoa
What can you say? It's family

Aunt Juicy been drinkin' again (wooh)
Its only 1:30 in the afternoon
Everybody tip-toeing round her
We all know she gonna be tore up soon
Saying all the things we like to say
Hope she gets around to cousin Lonnie
'Cause we all know he got a little extra
Somebody on the side (But)

Whoa whoa-o-whoa whoa-o-whoa whoa-o-whoa

And whoa whoa-o-whoa whoa-o-whoa whoa-o-whoa

Oh shit, damn Mickey and Steven are fightin' again
Move out the way, somebody might get hurt
Aw look at that what happened is worse
They knocked over Eleanora's lemon cake (mmm)
You know the one she barely ever makes
I'm gettin' riled up, I want them to go
But somebody turn Frankie Beverly on the stereo
Cousin Ruby starts rockin', shakin' her good hip and bottom
So we all fall into place smiling and laughing

Whoa whoa-o-whoa whoa-o-whoa whoa-o-whoa
What can you say? It's family
And whoa whoa-o-whoa whoa-o-whoa whoa-o-whoa
What can you say? It's family (my family)
