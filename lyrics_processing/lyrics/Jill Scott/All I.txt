You like
Don't be scared, come closer
You never saw me like this before huh?

I been a goody daddy
But I don't have to be
If you don't want me to
I'll be your nasty baby
No time for games, no rules just play
Hope you been thinking about the same thing

I'm just sayin' what's on my mind
It's been good, but now it's time
To show love what we made of
No time for games, no rules just play
I hope you want me in the same way

Every time I close my eyes
All I dream about is making love
I can't even sleep at night
All I dream about is making love
It's just all the things I see
When you're inside of me
That keeps my mind going crazy
I can't even think at night
All I dream about is making love
... to you

Hope you been thinking about the same thing

I'm just sayin 'what's on my mind
