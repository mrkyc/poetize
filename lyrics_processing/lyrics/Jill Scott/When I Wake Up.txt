Too much on my mind
Too much on my mind
Too much on my mind
Too much on my...

Here I am thinking again
All lost in my brain
But I know I should get up and get out of bed
I gotta keep moving
But here I am lost all up inside my brain
Can't stop thinking, reminiscing
Can't stop, can't let go

But when I wake up
And one day I will do it, yea yea yea
I have let you go
And everything I went through was beautiful
I have let you go
And everything I went through was beautiful

Maybe I, right now, can't see the forest for the trees
So lost behind hurt
But I'm trying everyday exponentially to move forward
Ooh do you know how it feels to be lost?
You might also like
But when I wake up
Everything I went through would be beautiful
When I wake up
And I will wake up
It's gonna be beautiful

Down to to my left side (last cry)
Feeling I could fly
All day, up high
Sweeter than the sugar on a cinnamon treat
Or an ice cream
That was me
But I'm feeling like I'm in a nightmare
Fear of loving somebody everywhere
Oh Lord I need this confirmation
This affirmation

That when I wake up
When I wake up
Everything I went through will be beautiful
When I wake up
Everything I went through will be beautiful
Gotta wake up
Gotta wake up
Gotta wake up
Gotta wake up
Gotta wake up
Everything I went through will be beautiful
Gotta wake up
Gotta wake up
Gotta wake up
Gotta wake up
Gotta wake up
Gotta wake up
Gotta wake up
Gotta wake up
Gotta wake up
Gotta wake up
Gotta wake up
Gotta wake up
Gotta wake up
Gotta wake up
