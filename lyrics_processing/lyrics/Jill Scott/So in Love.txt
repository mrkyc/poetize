I'm glad this week is over
I need to get away
Go home and throw my clothes on
Come get you right away
Can't wait to see you looking lovely
I hope you're thinking of me
'Cause all I want is time with you
And don't need nothing more
So in love

So in love with you, so in love with you
So in love with you, so in love with you
So in love with you, so in love with you
So in love with you, so in love with you
So in love with you, so in love with you
So in love with you, so in love with you
So in love with you, so in love with you
So in love with you, so in love with you

I see you cross the room
Talking to some men
I love your mannerisms, babe
The way you handle them
Oh, I'm so proud to be with you
So attracted to you too
You're so damn good to me
In everything you do
'Cause I am so in love
You might also like
So in love with you, so in love with you
So in love with you, so in love with you
So in love with you, so in love with you
So in love with you, so in love with you
So in love with you, so in love with you
So in love with you, so in love with you
So in love with you, so in love with you
So in love with you, so in love with you

Listen, I'm so in love with you
That I can't help myself (can't help it)
As long as it's me and you
We don't need nothing else
I've got you
Got you
Hey, hey, hey, yeah, yeah
Oh, make it last forever
I'm so in love...

First thing in the morning
When I open my eyes and see you
I feel like a breath of fresh air
I feel like I can fly
And I can get by
Any obstacle that comes my way
So in love with you, so in love with you
So in love with you, so in love with you
So in love with you, so in love with you
So in love with you, so in love with you
So in love with you, so in love with you
So in love with you, so in love with you
So in love with you, so in love with you
So in love with you, so in love with you
So in love with you, so in love with you
So in love with you, so in love with you
So in love with you, so in love with you
So in love with you, so in love with you
So in love with you, so in love with you
So in love with you, so in love with you
So in love with you, so in love with you
So in love with you, so in love with you

Do anything for you
Anytime is all right, if you want me, baby I'm there
Anything you want me to, I'll do it for you
Anytime is all right, if you want me, I'm there
You're so good to me, oh
Anytime is all right, if you want me, baby I'm there
I'll do anything for you
Anytime is all right, if you want me, I'm there
Anything you want me to do
Oh, it'd be a blessing for me too
Oh baby, oh baby
Sugar is sweet but not like you
Rain drops fall, sun shine
When I look in your eyes
