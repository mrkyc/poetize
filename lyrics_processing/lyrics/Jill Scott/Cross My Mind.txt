I was just thinking about you
Wondering if you wear the same cologne
Smelled good on you
Had the next boyfriend of mine try the same kind
But it stunk on him though
You know what they say, everything ain't for everybody
But I tried it anyway
You sure did smell good
Eh yeah

You just running cross my mind
You just running cross my mind
You just running cross my mind
You just running cross my mind

You had that masculine thing down
Shoulders, back straight
Never slumping, never round
It would turn me on just to see you walk into a room
Across the room, out of the room
You really impressed me
Eh yeah
You might also like
You just running cross my mind
You just running cross my mind
You just running cross my mind
You just running cross my mind

I know if I pick up this phone, write this letter send this two way
I know I'm gonna say some things, I know you gonna say some things
That we both don't mean to say
Like, how amazing, how amazing
When you would spread my limbs cross continents
Bump our bed way over mountains
Kiss this and this and this and this
And this and this and this and this
And this and this and this and that
Show each other where the climax is at

You just running across my mind
Across my mind
You just running across my mind
You just running across my mind

I was just thinking about you
Wondering what you doing I mean what you've been up to
I know it's wrong feeling so strong
Let me take a second minute hour think this thing through
I was just thinking about you
Wondering what you doing I mean what you've been up to
I know it's wrong feeling so strong
Let me take a second minute hour think this thing through
Remember all the moments for two?
How we used to
Oh yeah
But the reality honestly
You were never good for me and I was never good for you
