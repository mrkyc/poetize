I know, oh, I know
That look on your face
Says you're goin' through some things
And for sure, maybe, for sure
I'm here, mhm
Here for you, baby, yes

Whatever it is, trouble is deep
I can see by your eyes
They're heavy to me
Talk to me, baby

I am your shelter
You're safe from harm
Tornado, lightning, hurricane
Can't get by me
Come under my love
Feel the energy, let go
Lay your burdens down (Let go)
I am your shelter
You're safe from harm (Let go)
Tornado, lightning, hurricane
Can't get by me
Come under my love (Let go)
Feel the energy, let go
Lay your burdens down (Lay your burdens down)
You might also like
Lay 'em down, lay 'em down
Lay your burdens down (Lay 'em down)
Lay 'em down, lay 'em down
Lay your burdens down (Lay 'em down)
Can't get by me
Come under my love
Feel the energy, let go
Lay your burdens down

Look here, hol' up
You got a lot goin' on
I can see by the way you walk
And how you got your shoulders on
Baby, everybody get wet
When the rain is pourin'
Can't stop now
'Cause the wind is foreign
It's a fact
Of the universe, that sometimes
Life is pain, and it can hurt
But I know
That it'll get better
Because you've gone through worse, huh? Hey
Whatever it is, trouble is deep
I can tell by your eyes
They're heavy to me
Oh, my baby, I am

I am your shelter
You're safe from harm (I am)
Tornado, lightning, hurricane
Can't get by me
Come under my love (Whatever trouble)
Feel the energy, let go
Lay your burdens down (Lay your burdens down)
I am your shelter
You're safe from harm (I am your shelter)
Tornado, lightning, hurricane (Whatever, babe)
Can't get by me
Come under my love (Ever, baby)
Feel the energy, let go
Lay your burdens down (Lay your burdens down)

Lay 'em down, lay 'em down
Lay your burdens down (Inner peace)
Lay 'em down, lay 'em down
Lay your burdens down (Inner peace)
Can't get by me
Come under my love
Feel the energy, let go
Lay your burdens down (Let go)
Down, lay your burdens down (Inner peace)
Lay 'em down, lay 'em down
Lay your burdens down (Inner peace)
Can't get by me
Come under my love
Feel the energy, let go
Lay your burdens down
Sitting here, contemplating
If we should even be
See, I'm in love with a man
Who loves me, for me
He'd do anything, easily
Oh, his heart knows no boundaries
But, he needs
Sometimes, to write
With a different pen on different paper
He needs
Oh, he needs
He needs, mhm
So I'm sitting here, contemplating
If we should even be
Like him, I, too, have needs
Like, like my thought on a beat
Hypnotic and sweet
Like part of the dreamin'
And I need you
On the other side of the speaker
To look up a little more
And think a little deeper
And live in your truth
I need that, too
I need to do that, too
I need
