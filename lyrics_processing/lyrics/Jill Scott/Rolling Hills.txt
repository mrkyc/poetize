Well well well well well well well

Maybe you don't recognize
What you got between ya thighs, come on (well)
So I'm gonna set you right
And I'm starting here tonight, well (well)
Shine like the moon
And strong like the sea (well)
More expensive than money
More valuable than anything (well)
Juicy mango summer peach (well)
Make a lame man walk and a full man hungry
Well well well well

And if you don't know what I'm saying then, baby I'm telling you
There's power in them rolling hills, come on
You're a prize possession, not everybody's worthy
Only reason I know is cause I headed down that road
And it'd be a shame for you not to have your own glow
Come on (well)
Well, well
Well, well
Well

Maybe you don't recognize what you got between your eyes (well)
So I'm gonna set you correct so you can get what you should get (well)
Intuition's something sweet (well)
Let you know what you know
Let you find before you seek (well)
Spirit of discernment
Pray for it every day (well)
Let you know who should go and who you should let stay (well)

And if you don't know what I'm saying then, baby I'm telling you
There's power in them rolling hills, come on
You're a prize possession, not everybody's worthy
Only reason I know is cause I headed down that road
And it'd be a shame for you not to have your own glow

Glow, I wanna see you shine
