Hey, oh, hey, yeah, Oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I'm taking my freedom
Pulling it off the shelf
Putting it on my chain
Wear it around my neck
I'm taking my freedom
Putting it in my car
Wherever I choose to go
It will take me far

I'm livin' my life like it's golden
Livin' my life like it's golden

I'm taking my own freedom
Putting it in my song
Singing loud and strong
Grooving all day long
I'm taking my freedom
Putting it in my stroll
I'll be high-steppin', y'all
Letting the joy unfold

Can't take it from me
I was born into it
It comes naturally
I'm strumming my own freedom
Playing the God in me
Representing His glory
Hope He's proud of me
