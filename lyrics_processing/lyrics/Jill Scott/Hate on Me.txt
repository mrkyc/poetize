If I could give you the world on a silver platter
Would it even matter? You'd still be mad at me
If I can find in all this a dozen roses which I would give to you
You'd still be miserable
In reality, I'm gon' be who I be
And I don't feel no fault for all the lies that you bought
You can try as you may bring me down when I say
That it ain't up to you, go on do what you do

Hate on me, hater, now or later
'Cause I'm gonna do me
You'll be mad, baby
(Go ahead and hate)
Go ahead and hate on me, hater
I'm not afraid of
What I got, I paid for
You can hate on me

Ooh if I gave you peaches out of my on garden
And I made you a peach cobbler, would you slap me?
I wonder if I gave you diamonds out of my own womb
Would you feel the love in that or ask "Why not the moon?"
If I gave you sanity for the whole of humanity
Had all the solutions for the pain and pollution
No matter where I live, despite the things I give
You'll always be this way, so go ahead and
You might also like
Hate on me, hater, now or later
'Cause I'm gonna do me
You'll be mad, baby
(Go ahead and hate)
Go ahead and hate on me, hater
I'm not afraid of
What I got, I paid for
You can hate on me

Hate on me, hater, now or later
'Cause I'm gonna do me
You'll be mad, baby
(Go ahead and hate)
Go ahead and hate on me, hater
I'm not afraid of
What I got, I paid for
You can hate on me

You cannot hate on me
'Cause my mind is free
Feel my destiny
So shall it be
You cannot hate on me
'Cause my mind is free
Feel my destiny
So shall it be
You cannot hate on me
'Cause my mind is free
Feel my destiny
So shall it be
You cannot hate on me
'Cause my mind is free
Feel my destiny
So shall it be
Hate on me, hater, now or later
'Cause I'm gonna do me
You'll be mad, baby
(Go ahead and hate)
Go ahead and hate on me, hater
I'm not afraid of
What I got, I paid for
