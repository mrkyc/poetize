Some of them wanna break you down
Steal your crown
Use and abuse you
Some of them smile in your face
'Cause they've heard it some place
You got more than they're used to
Some of them want to steal your love
Oh, 'cause they're jealous of how you're living
And giving

(I keep)
Moving forward, pressing onward, striving further
(I keep)
Keep on laughing, keep on living, keep on loving, yeah
(I keep)
Keep on dreaming, keep on achieving, keep on believing
(I keep)
I keep smiling when I come through
And I cry when I need to

Some of them, oh, they stab you in your back
'Cause it's love they lack
Some of them won't even try
To see the good side
You might also like
(I keep)
Moving forward, pressing onward, striving further
(I keep)
Keep on laughing, keep on living, keep on loving, yeah
(I keep)
Keep on dreaming, keep on achieving, keep on believing
(I keep)
Ah, hey, oh, ooh, ooh
(I keep)
Keep on, keep on living, keep on learning, keep on smiling, oh yeah
(I keep)
Keep on laughing, keep on living, keep on loving, yeah
(I keep)
Keep on dreaming, keep on believing, keep on achieving
(I keep)
I keep smiling when I come through
And I cry when I need to

Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah
I keep on, keep on keeping on
Hey-yeah, hey, I keep, keep on
Keep keeping on, keep keep keep, keep keeping on
Part II: Still Here
I am a boisterous river
I am a mountain story
I am a quiet feeling
I am a fragrant flower
I am a moonlit evening
I am a peaceful night
I am a writer's thinking
I am a wealth unfathomed
And if you don't recognize my presence, I am here
And if you don't recognize me, I am here
I am a source of power
I am excited journey
I am the rock of patience
I am a whisper singing
I am unbridled freedom
I am the thought from thinking
I am a love unshattered
I am the great orgasm
And if you don't recognize my presence, I am here
And if you don't recognize my presence, I am here
And even if you don't recognize me, I'm still here
And even if you don't recognize me
And even if you don't recognize me, I'm still here
And even if you don't recognize me, I am, oh, I'm still here
