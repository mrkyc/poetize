Yo, I'm tripping right
I heard you got married
You got married?
No I mean, make any
It don't really make any sense
I mean, it's not like I
I didn't think you were seeing other people or whatever
I mean I was seeing other people but
You know what this is
You know what it was, you, tsch
I can't say I really understand though

You chose her cause she's sweet as pie
Take what you give, even your lies
But baby, are happy without me?
She scrubs your back, washes your clothes
Gives you everything that you ask for
But don't you ever want more?
'Cause my love

My love is deeper, tighter
Sweeter, higher, flyer
Didn't you know this?
Or didn't you notice?
(My love, my love)
My love is deeper, tighter
Sweeter, higher, flyer
Didn't you know this
Or didn't you notice?
You might also like
Mmmm, what we had don't need no words
Deeper than anything you ever heard
I ain't reaching baby
I know I should be your lady
You say you're happy, you say you're great
But you know and I know you really ain't
You need to come be with me
That's the way it's supposed to be

My love is deeper, tighter
Sweeter, higher, flyer
Didn't you know this?
Or didn't you notice?
(My love, my love)
My love is deeper, tighter
Sweeter, higher, flyer
Didn't you know this
Or didn't you notice?

Cause oh
All I ever do is think about you baby
I hold you in my arms inside my dreams
And I know what I know and what I know is
That no matter where you go
You will always think of me
My love is deeper, tighter
Sweeter, higher, flyer
Didn't you know this?
Or didn't you notice?
(My love, my love)
My love is deeper, tighter
Sweeter, higher, flyer
Didn't you know this
