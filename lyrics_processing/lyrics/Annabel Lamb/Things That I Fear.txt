Don't close the door, I can't stand it
Leave the lights on in the hallway
There's someone hiding in the wardrobe
Leave the lights on, leave them on
There's a woman sitting under the stairs
Can't you see her? See her laughing?
Something's going to grab your legs
It's under your bed, it's under my bed

The things that I fear are always with me now
The things that I fear are right here
The things that I fear, they never leave me now
The things that I fear are right here

Something's knocking at the window
One, two, three, one, two, three
Someone's waltzing in the kitchen
One, two, three, one, two, three
Something heavy's lying on me
It's pressing hard, I can't breathe
The laughing woman's in here now
Hold your breath and listen for her
You might also like
The things that I fear are always with me now
The things that I fear are right here
The things that I fear, they never leave me now
The things that I fear are right here

I'm yelling at you down the phone
Can't you hear me? You can't hear me
Your voice is slow and underwater
Is it you? It isn't you
Someone knows I'm here alone
They are watching, watching, always watching
Turn round and round, and round and round
Don't turn your back on anything
(On anything, on anything, on anything)

The things that I fear are always with me now
The things that I fear are right here
The things that I fear, they never leave me now
The things that I fear are right here
The things that I fear are always with me now
The things that I fear are right here
The things that I fear, they never leave me now
The things that I fear are right here
