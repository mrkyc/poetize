You hold the answers deep within your own mind
Consciously, you've forgotten it
That's the way the human mind works
Whenever something is too unpleasant, too shameful for us to entertain, we reject it
We erase it from our memories
But the imprint is always there

The pain that grips you
The fear that binds you
Releases life in me
In our mutual
Shame we hide our eyes
To blind them from the truth
That finds a way from who we are
Please don't be afraid
When the darkness fades away
The dawn will break the silence
Screaming in our hearts

My love for you still grows
This I do for you
Before I try to fight the truth my final time

We're supposed to try and be real
And when you feel alone, you are not together
And that is real

Can't wash it all away
Can't wish it all away
Can't cry it all away
Can't scratch it all away

Lying beside you
Listening to you breathe
The life that flows inside of you
Burns inside of me
Hold and speak to me
Of love without a sound
Tell me you will live through this
And I will die for you

Cast me not away
Say you'll be with me
For I know I cannot
Bear it all alone
You're not alone, honey
Never, never

Can't fight it all away
Can't hope it all away
Can't scream it all away
It just won't fade away, no

Can't wash it all away
Can't wish it all away
Can't cry it all away
Can't scratch it all away

(Can't fight it all away)
(Can't hope it all away)
Can't scream it all away
Ooh, it all away
Ooh, it all away

But the imprint is always there
Nothing is ever really forgotten
(God, please don't hate me
Because I'll die if you do
Because I'll die if you do
Because I'll die if you do
