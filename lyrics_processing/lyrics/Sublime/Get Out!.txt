"It's 8:05. This is Phyllis in the office. The cat is out on the patio. If it jumps one more time, your butts are in the street. I am sick and tired of your activities, your cat, and your untruths with me. I'm gonna call you tomorrow when you're home, and you can explain a lot of things to me because I'm sick and tired of your bullshit. Goodnight."

My place is not a home
It don't make no difference, but I have found
That I need a place to stay
I never listen what the landlord man say

You should have seen all the flops in my house
We was jumping on walls and kicking ceilings
Nowadays, people listen to me
When I say, "Get out!"

Hold me and don't let go
It don't make no difference that you're a ho
'Cause I need a place to stay
A new disease was just the price I paid

In days of old, that's how it used to be
Oh yes, indeed
That girl is dead to me now
And I sing, "Get out!"

Elk, and bison, a gnu or two
Giraffes and elephants, quite a few)

(Fuck you, mang!)
(I got a bone to pick)
Don't sit, don't trip
I'm cutting hits like Bert Susanka's got the shrimp dip
I get it, get it, get it, get it all the time
People wants to know the meaning of the word sublime
It's anarchist, man, it's the shit you missed
We get the Minuteman loops and add a Peni twist
'Cause we know you love the pit, but this is the shit
That you put in the box and say "Damn, it's a hit, boy!"
Why ain't it on the radios and the T.V. shows?
'Cause we don't kiss no ass or kick down free shows
What you get is the kind, no gang, no cess
When Yellow Lover's on the D-R-U-M-S

Let the lovin' take a hold over me
Let the lovin' take a hold over me, follow me Long Beach posse
'Cause all I see is your fussin' and fightin'
1992, so let's all start uniting
Put your hands together, be the best you can be
Let this jam take us to 1993
