Headed out for Austin, now we're half way down the road
Hollering, "Budda-by, budda-by, budda-by, budda-by!"
Steady staring out the window
It feels good, it feels tight, it feels like you need it
And back out on the road is where we like to be seated
We got Half-Pint style, we got a U-Roy style
A Half-Pint style, we got a U-Roy style
We got to put that shit together in a creative style
To put that shit together in a creative style

Outside on the pavement, I won't feel afraid
There's a little piece of paper saying how we won't get paid

Back out on the highway, Phoenix looks the same
Don't look at me, 'cause I got no one to blame

I can't make you overstand, rising up in a hip-hop dance
Smile if you got the loot
That's all you need

Headed out to Houston, now we're halfway out the door
Hollering, "Budda-by, budda-by, budda-by, budda-by!"
Staring out the window
It feels good, it feels nice, it feels like you need it
I know how females like to be treated
The lights in front of me, and the stars up above
Out on the interstate, it's all about love, love, love
And if I never realize, then that's how it has to be
And all the DJ doubters got to give me money
You might also like
Back out on the freeway, I won't feel the same
Little yellow headlights look like snails smashed in the rain

Back out on the highway, Phoenix looks the same
Don't ask me 'cause I've got no one to blame

I can't make you overstand, I'm rising up in a hip-hop dance
Smile if you got the keys
That's all you need, yeah, yeah

Highway is your way, but I won't say
Because no one can tell you you've got to be afraid
We got to roll back on the highway, living it on the real
But the real's so hard
You gotta, gotta, you gotta be real!
I wanna be real!
