All that I need
Look at all the love we found, oh-oh
I won't run and pull no one jack move
They love us for the Kingston sound, oh-oh

Flava Flav and I.C.E
Once said somethin' that made me
Want to burn my liquor store down to the ground
But I just can't leave the pad
'Cause I'll surely wind up dead
'Cause I know they're out there waiting and watching for me
Still, I got my yellow cat
And my wooden baseball bat
And my shiny silver gat, and if my homie got my back
Then I've got

All that I need
Look at all the love we've found, oh-oh
I won't run and pull a one jack move
They love us for the Kingston sound, oh-oh

Oh, oh-oh
I won't slip and I won't trip
Send Matt Vargas to regrip
While I'm wrenchin' on my ride
In that secret pad where we hide
There's always lots of fun stuff to do
Like relax and design a brand new tattoo
Playin' with my crossword puzzle book
I'm even learnin' how to cook

Have you seen that little whore, Betty?
Someone said that she stole my freddie
And if she made off with my last clean rig
I'm going to kill that fuckin' ditch pig, so what?
Outta my, outta my, outta my, outta my secret pad
'Cause I know you're talkin' about me, makin' it hard to live
'Cause I don't want no money fee, don't want no money down
My secret tweaker pad is now the hottest dope spot in town
I just take it nice and easy
Don't want no sheriff breakin' down the door to raid me

'Cause all that I need
Look at all the love we've found, oh-oh
I won't run and pull the one jack move
They love her for the Kingston sound, oh-oh

Baby, you wanna give me kisses sweet
Only for a night, with no repeat
Baby, you wanna leave and never call
