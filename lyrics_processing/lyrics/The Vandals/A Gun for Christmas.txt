Families lock their doors in fear
That criminals might get them
But this Christmas rest assured
That I will have my own protection

I'll get a gun for Christmas to protect my other gifts
If bad guys touch my property, they won't leave here without a limp
Packing heat on Christmas and I'll shoot it off on New Year's Eve
Bullets go into outer space when pointed up, I believe

A bullet sends a Christmas message that is clear and loud
It says I will not take all of this bullshit lying down
I'll get a gun for Christmas to protect my other gifts
I'll only tell you once, stay the fuck away from my shit!

I will use my new weapon in self-defense and sport
And to keep the carolers off of my goddamn porch
Preventing Yuletide homicide this year

I won't be a victim this year, thanks to Santa Claus
Sleeping with no fear of danger, and it's all because
I'll get a gun for Christmas to protect my other gifts
I'll only tell you once, stay the fuck away from my shit!

Christmas needs security, security is weapons
Vigilante action teaching criminals a lesson
It's the greatest gift we have for taking out our rivals
Thank you Santa, thank you God, for guaranteeing my survival

A bullet sends a Christmas message that is clear and loud
It says I will not take all of this bullshit lying down
I'll get a gun for Christmas to protect my other gifts
I'll only tell you once, stay the fuck away from my shit!

I won't be a victim this year thanks to Santa Claus
Sleeping with no fear of danger, and it's all because
I'll get a gun for Christmas to protect my other gifts
I'll only tell you once, stay the fuck away from my crap
