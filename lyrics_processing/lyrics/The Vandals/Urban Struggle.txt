I want to be a Cowboy
I'm going to be a Cowboy
I'm born to be a Cowboy
I want to be a Cowboy
A Cowboy! (Uh-huh)

Tonight we're taking my fast car
Were gonna go down to the Cowboy bar
I'm gonna wait till the club is full
And I'm gonna ride the mechanical bull

Cowboy look is the one I sought
Can't change now cause the clothes are bought
To be a true Cowboy was my fate
I can't help it if I was born late

All the Cowgirls in their Stetson hats
And their tight-fitting jeans so they don't look fat
We'll all be listening to the Cowboy tunes
And stomp around like a bunch of goons

Cowboy look is the one I sought
Can't change now cause the clothes are bought
To be a true cowboy was my fate
I can't help it if I was born late
You might also like
We're all OD'd on the Olden West
Seein' who's Cowboy clothes look the best
I can ride that phony bull so damn good
Sometimes I think I'm Clint Eastwood

Cowboy look is the one I sought
Can't change now cause the clothes are bought
To be a true cowboy was my fate
I can't help it if I was born late

I know I'm a Cowboy deep inside
My hat band's made out of synthetic rattle snake hide
After a couple shit kickin' Cowboy movies
I'll check out the Cowboy scene down at Zubie's

Cowboy look is the one I sought
Can't change now cause the clothes are bought
To be a true cowboy was my fate
I can't help it if I was born late

Find out who all fights the best
We start fights with them punks at the Cuckoo's Nest
Those damn punks are crazy though
And meaner than a bull at a rodeo
Cowboy look is the one I sought
Can't change now cause the clothes are bought
To be a true cowboy was my fate
I can't help it if I was born late

You call me an Urban clone of course
A big deal if I'm afraid to ride a horse
With a broken nose and a fucked up knee
Maybe this Cowboy scene just ain't for me

Cowboy look is the one I sought
Can't change now cause the clothes are bought
To be a true cowboy was my fate
I can't help it if I was born late

Yee Haw, woo-woo, Yee Haw
Woo-woo, Yee Haw

Cowboy look is the one I sought
Can't change now cause the clothes are bought
To be a true cowboy was my fate
I can't help it if I was born late
