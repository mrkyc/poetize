Hot step moms and surrogate dads
It breaks my heart to see him so sad
Lying alone in his room with a frown on
Reruns showing him what he's missing out on

If life could be like he sees it on TV
He wouldn't have to hurt so bad
Hurt so bad `cause

It's too much drama, it's too much drama, dad and mama
Trading back and forth until he turns eighteen
It's too much drama, the kid don't need no goosestep grandma
So he joins a family on the screen
Can't you see, too many parents leave
Too many sets of parents leave a kid who can't believe
How they can think that he can take it
It's all he can do to fake it

Off for a weekend with real dad
But the only thing real is how real bad
He just wants his life to be black and white
Those people never fight
You might also like
If he could Xerox a home from the talking picture box
He wouldn't have to hurt so bad
Hurt so bad 'cause

It's too much drama, it's too much drama, dad and mama
Trading back and forth until he turns eighteen
It's too much drama, the kid don't need no goosestep grandma
So he joins a family on the screen
Can't you see, too many parents leave
Too many sets of parents leave a kid who can't believe
How they can think that he can take it
It's all he can do to fake it

So he turns to TV for help and for guidance
A lot of his virtues he picked up from Linus
Fonzie taught him what it means to be cool
From Doogie he learned that he must go to school
Three's Company taught him that just acting gay
Could lower the actual rent he would pay
Cops showed beating your wife and your neighbor
Could immortalize you and your double-wide trailer

It's too much drama, it's too much drama, dad and mama
Trading back and forth until he turns eighteen
It's too much drama, the kid don't need no goosestep grandma
So he joins a family on the screen
Can't you see, too many parents leave
Too many sets of parents leave a kid who can't believe
How they can think that he can take it
