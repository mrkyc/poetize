If God came down on Christmas day
What would he think?
What would he say?
Would he notice all we've done, or just about a seldom one?
I think I know what God would say if He came down on Christmas day
He'd say to every boy and girl
"Where's the oi I gave to the world?"

Haji was a punk just like any other boy
And he never had no trouble 'til he started up his Oi band
Safe in the garage or singin' in the tub
'Til Haji went too far and he plugged in at the pub

'Twas a cold Christmas eve when Trevor and the skins
Popped in for a pint and to nick a bag of crisps
Trevor liked the music but not the unity
He unwound Haji's turban and he knocked him to his knees

If God came down on Christmas Day
I know exactly what he'd say
He'd say "Oi!" to the punks and "Oi!" to the skins
But "Oi!" to the world and everybody wins

Haji was a bloody mess, he ran out through the crowd
He said "we'll meet again, we are bloody yet unbowed"
Trevor called his bluff and told him where to meet
Christmas Day on the roof down at 20 Oxford Street

If God came down on Christmas Day
I know exactly what he'd say
He'd say "Oi!" to the punks and "Oi!" to the skins
But "Oi!" to the world and everybody wins

On the roof with the num-chuks, Trevor broke a lot of bones
But Haji had a sword like that guy on Indiana Jones

Police sirens wailing, a bloody dying man
Haji was alone and abandoned by his band
Trevor was still fading and still so full of hate
When the skins left him there and went down the fire escape (Oi! Oi!)

But then Haji saw the north star shining more than ever
So he made a tourniquet from his turban, saving Trevor
They repelled down the roof with the rest of the turban
And went down to the pub where they bought each other bourbon
If God came down on Christmas Day
I know exactly what he'd say
He'd say "Oi!" to the punks and "Oi!" to the skins
But "Oi!" to the world and everybody wins

If God came down on Christmas Day
I know exactly what he'd say
He'd say "Oi!" to the punks and "Oi!" to the skins
But "Oi!" to the world and everybody wins
