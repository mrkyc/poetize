Screaming and, ugh, covered in blood
Who was there to wipe you off
And give you your first hug?
And it took a couple years to figure out
How to not shit in your pants
But someone was there to clean you up
And powder off your rash
It's been them from the start
The ones you tortured and broke their hearts
The two that you hate, the two that you blame
The very same ones that
Gave you your name
Remember the time you were five
And you lied about who broke your lamp?
Who were the ones that sat you down
And gave you a second chance?
It's been them from the start
The ones you tortured and broke their hearts
The two that you hate, the two that you blame
The very same ones that
Gave you your name

Go home to Mom and Dad and say you're sorry
It's the least that you can do
After all you've put them through
Oh, come on
Beg Mom and Dad's forgiveness, they deserve it
Even if you don't mean it
Make them believe you that it's true
And when they offered you up all that great advise
You just screamed "Fuck you both
And let me live my life!
I'm gonna go out drinking with my friends
Have unprotected sex
Pierce my nose
And get a tattoo of a dragon on my neck!"

Cuz now your 35 and working in a warehouse
Cuz you spent your college money on cocaine
And the shame of your existence
Is ever so persistent cuz you know your parents tried
And you're to blame, you're to blame
'Cuz It's been them from the start
The ones you tortured and broke their hearts
The two that you hate
The two that you blame
The very same ones that
Gave you your name
