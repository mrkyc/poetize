Hey buddy, how you doin' today?
Thanks a lot buddy, man, I'm doin' okay
How 'bout you, you doin' all right?
Well, I got into a fight, my girl left last night

That's rough, guy, what was it about?
I lost my job and she just ran out
Your honey got runny when the money got funny?
My honey got runny when the money got funny, buddy

Are you ready for a brand new day? OK!
I'm gonna do things my own way! OK!
Leave the past behind you
And join me when I say OK

So guy, what do you do now?
Everywhere I go, people telling me how
To live my life, like they really know me
Sometimes past your nose, it's hard to see

So guy, what you trying to say?
I say it's time to do things your own way
So tell me what you want, what you really, really want
I'll tell you what I want, what I really, really want

When you're living through shit and you're living in shit
And shit is all you smell
Then you submit and get to used to it
And you live in your shit-filled hell
