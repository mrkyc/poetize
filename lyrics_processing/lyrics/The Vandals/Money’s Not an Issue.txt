Well I know you've been working most nights
And I think you deserve something nice for once, you do
And the twins, they've been driving you nuts
But tonight you're in luck, guess what, here's what

Hey babe, we're going out tonight, we're gonna do it right
No more pinching pennies with a broke-ass loser
I've had a change of luck, I found the twenty bucks
I thought I lost under the sofa
I'm feeling like a hundredaire, and baby, I just don't care
Where we go or what we spend
So grab your friends, 'cause money's not a issue
Tonight, tonight, tonight

Hey baby, we're going out tonight, just bring your appetite
For luxury and fun 'cause money's not an issue
Go on, baby, now make a wish, I'm feeling Irish rich
I found me a pot o' gold and living large, it fits you
Feel free to super size, 'cause tonight dreams are realized

Well I know you've been working most nights
And I think you deserve something nice
And the twins, they've been driving you nuts
But tonight you're in luck, guess what, here's what
You might also like
I know that's it's been rough, and you don't get the stuff
That such a pretty lady is so deserving of
But now that's not the case, I'll shower your sweet face
With champagne dreams and moustache kisses
I'm well aware that I've been kind of cheap and tight
But all that's changed and were going to do it right
So tell your friends that money's not an issue
Tonight, tonight, tonight

Hey baby, we're going out tonight, just bring your appetite
For luxury and fun 'cause money's not an issue
Go on, baby, now make a wish, I'm feeling Irish rich
I found me a pot o' gold and living large, it fits you
Feel free to super size, 'cause tonight dreams are realized

Well I know you've been working most nights
And I think you deserve something nice, for once, you do
And the twins, they've been driving you nuts
But tonight you're in luck, guess what, here's what

Hey baby, we're going out tonight, just bring your appetite
For luxury and fun 'cause money's not an issue
Go on, baby, now make a wish, I'm feeling Irish rich

Feel free to super size, 'cause tonight dreams are realized
Well, I know you been working most nights
