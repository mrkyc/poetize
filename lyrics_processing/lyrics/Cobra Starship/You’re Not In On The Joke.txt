Don't take them faces at their value
In a cynical town
Can't you smell the stale air?
I had no skill but I had heart
So then I turned it around
So just remember
I'm no cynic
You know I'm just getting bored
I'm no cynic
You know I got a heart of gold

They say I'm
Cold, cold, cold
Oh baby why so cold?
I'm super sweet
Sealed with a kiss
Don't get offended if there's something you missed

I only show you what I want you to see
I got my t-t-t-tongue in my cheek
If you see them laughing
Don't follow in
'Cause they're the butt of my joke
I'll always be just who you want me to be
And keep my t-t-t-tongue in my cheek
A hopeless romantic
You'll never see
'Cause you're not in on the joke

I got my picture in the paper
And my parents were proud
"Hey kid, that's not a bad job yeah"
Next thing you know
Peculiar faces start hanging around
Dear lord, can you spare me?
I've got just one side to show you all
My ass is awesome
So smile when you're kissing it

They say I'm
Cold, cold, cold
Oh baby why so cold?
I'm super sweet
Sealed with a kiss
Call your professor if there's something you missed

I only show you what I want you to see
I got my t-t-t-tongue in my cheek
If you see them laughing
Don't follow in
'Cause they're the butt of my joke
I'll always be just who you want me to be
And keep my t-t-t-tongue in my cheek
A hopeless romantic
You'll never see
'Cause you're not in on the joke
No, you don't know
You don't know me
No, you don't know
You don't know me
No, you don't know me
No, oh, no, oh

I only show you what I want you to see
I got my tongue, tongue in my cheek
If you see them laughing
Don't follow in
'Cause they're the butt of my joke
I'll always be just who you want me to be
And keep my t-t-t-tongue in my cheek
A hopeless romantic
You'll never see
