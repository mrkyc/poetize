The city is at a war, playtime for the young and rich
Ignore me if you see me 'cause I just don't give a shit
The city is at war, bless the young and rich
With designer drugs and designer friends

Here's how it goes, it's about who you know
If you got money, you get in for free
Get on your knees if you want to reach the top
The party never stops (Never stops), don't stop now (Don't stop now)

Come on, stick around and see how it ends
Get the money and run
And meet me at the parking lot
Bang bang, shoot 'em up, yeah

Ignore me if you see me 'cause I just don't give a shit
The city is at war, bless the young and rich

'Til she found a way to get a fix for free
Oh, pretty please, it breaks my heart to see
Another tragedy, she finally got her picture on TV

Come on, live it up while you can
We all lose in the end
No, you don't get another shot
Bang bang, shoot 'em up, yeah

The city is at war, war, uh oh
Bang bang, shoot 'em up, shoot 'em up, yeah
Bang bang, shoot 'em up, shoot 'em up, yeah
