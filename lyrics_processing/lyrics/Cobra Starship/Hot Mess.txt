You were a problem child
Been grounded your whole life
So now you running wild
Playing with them good girls
Naw, that ain't your style
You think you're hot shit
And ooh, I love it, I love it, yeah, yeah

Stumbling but yeah, you're still looking hella fine
Keep doing what you're doing, I'ma make you mine

Well, you're a hot mess and I'm falling for you
And I'm like hot damn! Let me make you my boo
'Cause you can shake it, shake it, shake it
Yeah, you know what to do
You're a hot mess
I'm loving it, hell yes!

I've been hypnotized
The city's your playground
I watch you take a bite
At 5am roaming in the streets
Drunk all night
You think you're hot shit
And ooh, I love it, I love it, yeah, yeah

Stumbling but yeah, you're still looking hella fine
Keep doing what you're doing, I'ma make you mine
