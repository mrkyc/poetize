I've seen the future
So I already know
Baby, you've been let down
You can't take anymore
You hear that I'm untrue
But you've been around too
I don't hide it from you
I know that you're needy
Baby, take it easy
And we can make all our dreams come true
If you

I'm down if you don't expect any more from me
I ain't got much for you
It's all right
If you want to get down
Keep it simple, now
I'm down if you don't expect any more from me
I ain't got much for you
It's all right
If you want to get down
Keep it simple, now

Time keeps slipping us by
When we're alone
Music makes me get high
We're getting down on the floor
Let this groove just take you
Make your booty shake too
Just show me what you can do
I know that you're needy
Baby, take it easy
We can make all our dreams come true
If you
You might also like
I'm down if you don't expect any more from me

It's all right
If you want to get down
Keep it simple, now
I'm down if you don't expect any more from me
I ain't got much for you
It's all right
If you want to get down
Keep it simple, now

How do you feel?
Do you feel alright, alright?
How do you feel?
Do you feel alright, alright?
How do you feel?
Do you feel alright, alright?
How do you feel?
Do you feel alright, alright?

I'm down if you don't expect any more from me

It's all right
If you want to get down

I ain't got much for you
It's all right
