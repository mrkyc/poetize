Just let me ask you
Hey, have you heard of my religion?
It's called the Church of Hot Addiction
And we believe that God has lust for everything
Because now
The time has come for your devotion
And you already got a notion
Of what I need
So give it, just give it
Just give it to me

You're willing
I'm waiting
Turn out the lights

Tonight I am the drug you can't deny
Tonight G-A-B-E going to get you high
My light is electric, hey hey hey
My light is electric, yeah, hey hey hey
My light is electric, hey hey hey
My light is electric, yeah, hey hey hey
My light it electric

Of what I need
So give it, just give it
Just give it to me

You're willing
I'm waiting
Turn out the lights
