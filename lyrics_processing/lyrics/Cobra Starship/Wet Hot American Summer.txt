I made a few mistakes
I don't worry anymore
Well, you never could relate
But I don't hate you anymore, oh no

'Cause summer's in the air now
I gotta get my game down tight
It's all right
Yo, go and get the word out
We're going to rock this party tonight
It's all right

I never meant to hurt you, girl, you know
You never felt the winter quite so cold
But when the sun comes up
I'll still be around
'Cause it's summer time
Get down
Get up, get up to get down, get down 

We're blasting Warren G
Regulators cruising slow
Roll down the windows, man
We got to  let them suckers know
You might also like
That summer's in the air now
We gotta get our moves down tight
It's all right
You got to  feel the beat now
The heart is what I see
But you know how to rock all night

I never meant to hurt you, girl, you know
You never felt the winter quite so cold
But when the sun comes up
I'll still be around
'Cause it's summer time
Get down
Get up, get up to get down, get down 
You got to get up, get up to get down, down
'Cause it's summer time
Get down

All my friends are in the city
Going to be the best summer
We'll catch a ride out of the city
If you catch a case of summer time blues
Telephone all the pretty girls you know
We don't need nowhere to go
We can drive around
All night long
I never meant to hurt you, girl, you know
You never felt the winter quite so cold
But when the sun comes up
I'll still be around
'Cause it's summer time
Get down

Get up, get up to get down, get down
Get up, get up to get down, down
You gotta get up, get up
