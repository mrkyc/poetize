And I, I know, even if your hope is gone
You belong, you belong to me, to me
I'm coming home and I know it won't be long
Before you belong, you belong to me

I'm building a castle
On the beaches where the ocean's
Turtles come to rest under the sun
You bury your head in the sand
Waiting for your boy to understand
How to be a man 'cause love is not enough
I've combed the ocean floors
For the dreams that we lost
The fears that we buried
The world just feels so small
I leave it all behind because

And I, I know, even if your hope is gone
You belong, you belong to me, to me
I'm coming home and I know it won't be long
Before you belong, you belong to me

I don't even know how I let you run so far
But I'll run after you until your legs give up
And I'll carry you all the way home
Back where we belong
You've given up but I've still got enough hope for us
In the desert glow
I saw a man without any clothes and his heart in his hands
He said "all you need to know is never let go"
Never let go
You might also like
And I, I know, even if your hope is gone
You belong, you belong to me, to me
I'm coming home and I know it won't be long
Before you belong, you belong to me

Don't turn away just show me your face again
'Cause I'm starting to forget
I can't live with this regret
The time will come when we will find our place again
Into my arms back where you belong
Into my arms back where you belong again

And I, I know, even if your hope is gone
You belong, you belong to me, to me
I'm coming home and I know it won't be long
