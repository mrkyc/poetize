I came here to make you dance tonight
I don't care if I'm a guilty pleasure for you

And I don't even know
What kind of fool you're taking me for
So you've got some brand new clothes
You never could afford before
Oh, brother, spare us all, we don't care anymore
We just want to get down on the floor
You sell yourself to make it
You can dish it but can you really take it?
You're never gonna to get it with nothing
'Cause nothing's what you got in your head
So stop pretending

I came here to make you dance tonight
I don't care if I'm a guilty pleasure for you
Shut up 'cause we won't stop
And we're getting down 'til the sun's coming up
I came here to make you dance tonight
I don't care if I'm a guilty pleasure for you
Shut up 'cause we won't stop
We're getting down 'til the sun's coming up
You might also like
And I don't even read
What the papers' got to say about me
Oh no, I can't believe
They take it so serious, seriously
I'm so bored, oh please, don't talk anymore
Shut your mouth and get down on the floor
So cynical
Poor baby, I can dish it
'Cause I know how to take it
You're never going to win them all
So fuck them if they can't take a joke
I'm just playing

I came here to make you dance tonight
I don't care if I'm a guilty pleasure for you
Shut up 'cause we won't stop
And we're getting down 'til the sun's coming up
I came here to make you dance tonight
I don't care if I'm a guilty pleasure for you
Shut up 'cause we won't stop
We're getting down 'til the sun's coming up

And maybe someday I'll believe
(Maybe someday I'll believe)
That we are all a part of some bigger plan
Tonight I just don't give a damn
(So shut your mouth, it's time to dance)
If the world is ending, I'm throwing the party
I came here to make you dance tonight
I don't care if I'm a guilty pleasure for you
Shut up 'cause we won't stop
And we're getting down 'til the sun's coming up
I came here to make you dance tonight
I don't care if I'm a guilty pleasure for you
Shut up 'cause we won't stop
We're getting down 'til the sun's coming up
I came here to make you dance tonight
I don't care if I'm a guilty pleasure for you
Shut up 'cause we won't stop
