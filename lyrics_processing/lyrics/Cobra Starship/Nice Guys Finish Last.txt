I was just a kid workin' for the man for the first time
He said "Listen, kid, you'd better hear my advice
Treat 'em like dirt, they'll stick forever to the bottom of your shoe"
Woo-ooh
I said "Mr. Man, that ain't nice, you gotta treat a girl right
Take her out, wine and dine her, always be polite"
"Kid, all good, just do you
But soon you'll see she don't want no goody two shoes"

Boy, you're just a goody two, goody two shoes
You're just a goody two, two shoes

You got style (You got style), you got grace (Got grace)
But, kid, you try so hard, she just laughs in your face
Yeah, you're a nice guy with the wrong attitude
She want a bad boy (Bad boys, bad boys, all we want is bad boys)
I treat her bad (So bad), she loves me good (So good)
And I just hate to have to tell you
'Cause you're a nice guy, but that just won't do
She want a bad boy (Bad boys, bad boys, all we want is bad boys)

Listen, kid, you hear them sirens comin' for me?
But when I get downtown she will already be
Postin' bail in her favorite dress
Smilin' at me because I'm no good
You can buy her everything she likes and I'm sure she'll be obliged
To let you steal a kiss, maybe even spend the night
Kid, all good, just know that
She'll be thinking of me even when she's with you

You got style (You got style), you got grace (Got grace)
But, kid, you try so hard, she just laughs in your face
Yeah, you're a nice guy with the wrong attitude
She want a bad boy (Bad boys, bad boys, all we want is bad boys)
I treat her bad (So bad), she loves me good (So good)
And I just hate to have to tell you
'Cause you're a nice guy, but that just won't do
She want a bad boy (Bad boys, bad boys, all we want is bad boys)

Well, alright now, single ladies (Yeah)
I'm gonna need your help now
(Tell us what you want us to do now)
(Tell us what you want us to do now)
I need help, girls (You're a bad boy)
I still I need help now (Help now)
So bad (So bad), so good (So good)
So bad (Bad), good (Good), oh

Goddamn, you got style (You got style), you got grace (Got grace)
You try so hard, she just laughs in your face
You're a nice guy, wrong attitude
She want a bad boy (Bad boys, bad boys, all we want is bad boys)
I treat her bad (So bad), she love me good (So good)
And I just hate to have to tell you
'Cause you're a nice guy, but that just won't do
