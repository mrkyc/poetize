Her heart is racin'
And the room is heatin' up
And her eyes are glazin'
But she still can't get enough

The beat is bumpin', now she's blowin' up (Blowin' up)
The last thing on her mind is growin' up (Growin' up)
She'll kiss the sky before she's givin' up (Givin' up)
And, oh, here she comes

She's dancin' with the stars
Livin' in the sky with diamonds
She's dancin' with the stars
And, oh, how the lights are shinin'
She holds the key in her hand
Reflection in the mirror's her best friend
Oh, she's dancin' with the stars
And the stars keep dancin'

You can't change her
'Cause you know you think it's hot
And that girl loves danger
But she don't know when to stop
You might also like
The beat is bumpin', now she's blowin' up (Blowin' up)
The last thing on her mind is growin' up (Growin' up)
She'll kiss the sky before she's givin' up (Givin' up)
And, oh, here she comes

She's dancin' with the stars
Livin' in the sky with diamonds
She's dancin' with the stars
And, oh, how the lights are shinin'
She holds the key in her hand
Reflection in the mirror's her best friend
Oh, she's dancin' with the stars
And the stars keep dancin'

Gonna get you somehow
Yeah, you're the talk of the town
Losing control now
And I hope you come back down
I hope you come down

She's dancin' with the stars
Livin' in the sky with diamonds
She's dancin' with the stars
And, oh, how the lights are shinin'
She holds the key in her hand
Reflection in the mirror's her only friend
Oh, she's dancin' with the stars
And the stars
She's dancin' with the stars
Livin' in the sky with diamonds
She's dancin' with the stars
And, oh, how the lights are shinin'
She holds the key in her hand
Reflection in the mirror's her best friend
Oh, she's dancin' with the stars
