Yeah
And I feel like
Put your middle fingers up like (Uh)

Got my middle finger up and it's pointed to the clouds (Clouds)
Rollin' in with my whole entourage, too many of us to count (Count)
Tell baby girl I'm on that, danger, bring your hard hat
Might not get that call back, so where those stories start at?

I step into the club, the haters turn around
My middle finger's up, man, I'm just gettin' down
To get me in the mood, to get me good
I need an aphrodisiac, yeah, aphrodisiac, yeah
And then she pulled me close and told me now
Let's rock the night away
And move your body to the beat like this, like this, like this

Throw your cups in the air, we so fly
Middle finger up to the sky
(Throw it up) In the sky-y-y, in the sky-y-y
(Throw it up) In the sky-y-y-y-y-y
Do it all the time (Hey), do it all night (Hey)
Middle finger up to the sky
(Throw it up) In the sky-y-y, in the sky-y-y
(Throw it up) In the sky-y-y-y-y-y
You might also like
Keep it movin', yeah, I gotta let you know
That you're the only girl who can drive me wild
Yeah, you feel good, better than I thought
You got me so, girl, you got me outta my mind
Now if you want me like I know I want you
Let's rock the night away
Move your body to the beat like this, like this, like this

Throw your cups in the air, we so fly
Middle finger up to the sky
(Throw it up) In the sky-y-y, in the sky-y-y
(Throw it up) In the sky-y-y-y-y-y (Uh, uh, uh, uh)
Do it all the time (Hey), do it all night (Hey)
Middle finger up to the sky

We got our middle fingers up
'Cause we don't give a fuck
Little bit of gin mixed in my cup
This is us, so drink that up
Girl, I might need a ride home
You can take me back to your spot
Sure shot, got your heart on lock, call that Fort Knox
Or not, could be a swing and miss
I bet you tryna prove what the meaning of single is
What you got to lose? I'm drunk as hell tryna talk you
No other girl here that's hot as you
It's all slowin' down 
Throw your cups in the air, we so fly
Middle finger up to the sky
(Throw it up) In the sky-y-y, in the sky-y-y
(Throw it up) In the sky-y-y-y-y-y
(And it goes like this)
Do it all the time (Hey), do it all night (Hey)
Middle finger up to the sky
(Throw it up) In the sky-y-y (Uh-huh), in the sky-y-y
(Throw it up; uh) In the sky-y-y-y-y-y
(Like, like, like, like this, like this, like this, like this)
Throw your cups in the air, we so fly
Middle finger up to the sky
(Throw it up) In the sky-y-y, in the sky-y-y
