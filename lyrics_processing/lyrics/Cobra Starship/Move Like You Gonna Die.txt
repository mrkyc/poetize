You want to run your mouth?
You better find something new to say
'Cause, kid, I heard it all before
You're such a rock star
What's with the attitude?
Man, I have attitude
Before I ever did good

Gotta get on your feet now
Shut your mouth
Get on your feet now, baby
We've got to move past the beef now
And just move, just move
'Cause at night, you can't see me
Smoke this dance floor
One, two, three, four

I have the best taste in this whole damn place
But I've had it up to here with this crowd
I'm leaving now
Let's go right now
And you've got the most grace in this whole damn place
If you want to disappear
Let's make a clear break right now
Let's go right now
So just move, just move
Just move like you're gonna die soon
Just move, just move
Just move like you're gonna die soon

I am misunderstood
But I ain't always good
I won't apologize
Fuck Hollywood
But yo, I'm kind of soft
I was the underdogs
Yeah, before tomorrow
I still don't know where I came from

Gotta get on your feet now
Shut your mouth
Get on your feet now, baby
We've got to move past the beef now
And just move, just move
'Cause at night, you can't see me
At AK-47
Four, five, six, seven

I have the best taste in this whole damn place
But I've had it up to here with this crowd
I'm leaving now
Let's go right now
And you've got the most grace in this whole damn place
If you want to disappear
Let's make a clear break right now
Let's go right now
So just move, just move
Just move like you're gonna die soon
Just move, just move
Just move like you're gonna die soon
'Cause at night, you can't see me
(Even if you don't know me)
Tonight, you can't see me
(Yeah, I know you want to hate me)
I got no time if you don't know how to move
Just want to dance with you
Don't want to talk to you
Tonight, you can't see me
Smoke this dance floor
One, two, three, four

I have the best taste in this whole damn place
But I've had it up to here with this crowd
I'm leaving now
Let's go right now
And you've got the most grace in this whole damn place
If you want to disappear
Let's make a clear break right now
Let's go right now
So just move, just move
Just move like you're gonna die soon
Just move, just move
