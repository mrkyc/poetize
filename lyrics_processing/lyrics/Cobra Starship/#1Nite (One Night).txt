We're in the spot right now
Ch-checking it out
Packed from wall to wall it's going down no doubt
Got girls to my left, drinks to my right
I can tell that this is gonna be one of them nights
Whatever you need is on the dance floor
Can't wait anymore because it don't last forever
So turn up that spotlight
Going to tear it up like we got one night

Cause tomorrow morning we'll be leaving
So right now you better jump right in
Tomorrow morning we'll be leaving
So let's keep it rocking 'til daylight

Got to live like we got one night, one night, one night
Got to live like we got one night, one night, one night
Cause you know we just got one life, one life, one life
So got to live like we got one night, one night, one night

Got me in a spell yeah girl the way you move

Going to have you screaming out gotta make you say ooh, ooh, ooh
