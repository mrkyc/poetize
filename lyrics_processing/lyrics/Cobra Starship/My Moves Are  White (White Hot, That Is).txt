Take my time
Take it easier
Don't need no lines
'Cause my moves are hot
And I never stop, girl

Hey, I know
You heard it all before
And you've seen it all
Hey, I know
It's the same old song
Same old song

I'm the kind of guy
That you ain't ever seen before
If you want to hit the floor
Are you ready for more?
I'm the kind of guy
That it ain't easy to forget
Girl, I'm going to make you sweat
Are you ready, are you ready for more?

I may not be nice

The things you understand
They could never comprehend
No need to explain it

I'm the kind of guy
That it ain't easy to forget
Girl, I'm going to make you sweat
Are you ready, are you ready for more?

Boy, I know what you're going to say
Did you think I was born yesterday?
I know you must think
That I got something to prove
But, girl, I really only want to
Hit the floor with you
I'm the kind of guy
That you ain't ever seen before
If you want to hit the floor
Are you ready for more?
I'm the kind of guy
That it ain't easy to forget
Girl, I'm going to make you sweat
Are you ready, are you ready for more?
I'm the kind of guy
That you ain't ever seen before
If you want to hit the floor
Are you ready for more?
I'm the kind of guy
That it ain't easy to forget
Girl, I'm going to make you sweat
