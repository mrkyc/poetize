Your daddy always said you should stay away from
A fool like me, a fool like me
And when your momma sees me callin' on your telephone
The bitch hangs up on me
Huh!?

Remember that time I blew your mailbox up
I was just kidding about that (kidding about that)
I'm sorry that I hit your dog with my bike
But he's still got three legs he's gonna be just fine
And baby, baby I ain't too sure that
I know how to change anymore
But
This I know for sure
I just got eyes for you
Even though your friends say
"Oh my God, how can she be with him, oh my God leave his ass"

Your daddy always said you should stay away from
A fool like me, a fool like me
And when your momma sees me callin' on your telephone, she hangs up on me
That bitch hangs up on me
Yeah I know
That I'm a grown ass man
Who still acts like an idiot
But Lord he must have been in a good mood the day
He let a girl like you
Choose to take a fool like me
You might also like
I never meant to drive your car into that tree
I'm still real sorry about that (sorry about that)
And I know I can't get it right
But I would do anything, anything
For my
Baby, baby you ain't too sure that
I know how to change anymore
But
This you know for sure
I just got eyes for you
Even though your friends say
"Oh my God, how can she be with him, oh my God leave his ass"


Oh my God
How can she be with him
Oh my God
How can she be with him
Oh my God
Leave his ass
