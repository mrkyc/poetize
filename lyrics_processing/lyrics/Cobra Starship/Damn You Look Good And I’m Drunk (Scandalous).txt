Sorry!

S-C-A-N-D to the A to the L-O-U-S
I can't handle it, can't handle it
Damn, that girl she's scandalous
S-C-A-N-D to the A to the L-O-U-S
Can't handle it, can't handle it
Damn, that girl she's scandalous

Time to get a tan
It's half-off if you bring a friend
With them crazy press-on nails
(Uh oh, uh oh)
Here's the truth: you're kind of hot
But when you open up to talk
I can feel I'm going soft
(Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh)

Don't ask me to sign your skin
Can't you see these little kids?
And you're the kind of girl I'd take home to mom
If my momma was dead
You might also like
No good
You're up to no good
But damn you look good and I'm drunk
Now you got me kind of
Thinking like maybe I would
So hard to be good
It's so hard to be good

S-C-A-N-D to the A to the L-O-U-S
I can't handle it, can't handle it
Damn, that girl she's scandalous
S-C-A-N-D to the A to the L-O-U-S
Can't handle it, can't handle it
Damn, that girl she's scandalous

Girl, I dig your fanny pack
Riding low behind your back
Give them boys a heart attack
(Uh oh, uh oh)
But don't come at me with them lips
Saying you just want a kiss
Because Lord only knows where you've been
(Uh oh, uh oh)
Don't ask me to sign your skin
I'm honestly not interested
And you're the kind of girl I'd take home to mom
If my momma was dead

No good
You're up to no good
But damn you look good and I'm drunk
Now you got me kind of
Thinking like maybe I would
So hard to be good
It's so hard to be good
No good
You're up to no good
But damn you look good and I'm drunk
Now you got me kind of
Thinking like maybe I would
So hard to be good
It's so hard to be good

This is V.I.P party boys
And we got a few things to say to you nasty, trashy hoes
Girl, where'd you get your outfit? Pick-and-pay?
Your momma pick but she sure didn't pay (Slut hole!)
I didn't pay money for my body (What?)
What are you supposed to be?
Some sort of Long Island Lolita, honey? (Lolita?!)
Are you sure you're even a woman? (Hahaha, whoa!)
Is that a house arrest bracelet in your pocket or do you got a dick like me?
You're the kind of  girl I'd take home to mom
If my momma was dead
No good
You're up to no good
But damn you look good and I'm drunk
Now you got me kind of
Thinking like maybe I would
So hard to be good
It's so hard to be good
No good
You're up to no good
But damn you look good and I'm drunk
Now you got me kind of
Thinking like maybe I would
So hard to be good
It's so hard to be good
