But he turned around and ran
I'll kill him with karate that I learned in Japan
He wouldn't see my face, I wouldn't leave a trace
I wouldn't use a bullet cause a bullet's a disgrace
Aw, mom, I never though that I was a murdering man
But tonight I'm on my way
Tonight I'm on my way
There's this drawer that I know in a house up the road
That's full of things that are easily sold
When they go out of town I could go and snoop around
And make myself rich off the things that I found
Aw, mom I never thought that I was a stealing man
But tonight I'm on my way
Tonight I'm on my way
I was sitting on the bleacher staring at the speaker
Reading his lips but I could not understand
So I opened up my ears and clearly I could hear
This detailed story all about a grain of sand
Aw, mom I always dreamt of being a good listener
So tonight I'm on my way
Tonight I'm on my way

He's got spirit and heart. We're 10 years apart
He is up for anything. He can hang with anyone
He still likes the things we used to think were fun
Aw, mom I never thought that I could have a friend
But tonight I'm on my way
Tonight I'm on my way
Oh, tonight
I'm on my way
I'm in love with someone who's as pretty as a flower
Her life gives me power so i'm buying her a ring
She makes hats with her hands
She is such an artist
I'm her biggest fan and I'm teaching her to sing
Aw, mom I never thought that I could love no one
But tonight I'm on my way
Tonight I'm on my way
Oh, tonight
