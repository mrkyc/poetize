Maybe we should switch careers
'Cause, baby, you know no one beats our poker faces
And when the night ends up in tears
Wake up and we blame it all on being wasted
Oh, this love is fadin'
So much we're not sayin'

But if these walls could talk
(They'd say) "Enough"
(They'd say) "Give up"
If these walls could talk
(They'd say) "You know"
(They'd say) "You're fucked"
It's not supposed to hurt this much
Oh, if these walls could talk
They'd tell us to break up

(These walls, these walls)
(These walls) They'd tell us to break up
(These walls, these walls)
(These walls, these walls)

It's getting worse the longer that we stay together
We call it love, but hate it here
Did we really mean it when we said forever?
Oh, this love is fadin'
So much we're not sayin'

But if these walls could talk
(They'd say) "Enough"
(They'd say) "Give up"
(I know) If these walls could talk
(They'd say) "You know"
(They'd say) "You're fucked"
