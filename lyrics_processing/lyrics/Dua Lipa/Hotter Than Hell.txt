(Ah yeah)
(Ah yeah)

He calls me the devil
I make him wanna sin
Every time I knock
He can't help but let me in
Must be homesick for the real
I'm the realest it gets
You'd probably still adore me
With my hands around your neck

Can you feel the warmth? Yeah
As my kiss goes down you like some sweet alcohol
Where I'm coming from, yeah
It's the darker side of me that makes you feel so numb

'Cause we're hot like hell
Does it burn when I'm not there?
And you're by yourself
Am I the answer to your prayers?
I'm giving you that pleasure heaven
And I'll give it to you
Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell

You're my manna from heaven
We all gotta get fed
Can't let me know I'm wanted
Can't let me in your head
I'm not here to make you kneel
But it's praise that I get
You ain't gonna walk free, boy
Not finished with you yet, no

Can you feel the warmth? Yeah
As my kiss goes down you like some sweet alcohol
Where I'm coming from, yeah
It's the darker side of me that makes you feel so numb

'Cause we're hot like hell
Does it burn when I'm not there?
And you're by yourself
Am I the answer to your prayers?
I'm giving you that pleasure heaven
And I'll give it to you
Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell
When we go down right there
You make me feel right there
When you lay me down right there
We just make it right there
'Cause you're looking so right there
Baby, you should touch me right there
If you take me right there
We could make it

'Cause we're hot like hell
Does it burn when I'm not there?
And you're by yourself
Am I the answer to your prayers? (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
I'm giving you that pleasure heaven
And I'll give it to you
Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell (Hey)
Hotter than hell (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
