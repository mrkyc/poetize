Ooh, na-na-na
Ooh, na-na-na-na

After midnight
Me and my thoughts alone
There's a part of me that wants to steal your heart
And a part that tells me, "Don't"
'Cause I'm no good at givin' up control
Are you worried that I might find somethin' wrong?
'Cause I'm worried that I won't

But if control is my religion
Then I'm headin' for collision
Lost my 20/20 vision
Please

Whatcha doin' to me, baby?
I'm scared to death that you might be the one to change me
You're in my head and now you're cloudin' my decisions
Got me headin' for collision
Whatcha doin' to me, baby?
Oh, whatcha doin'?

In the future
I see you next to me
But I can't shake the feelin' that there's more to learn
In the time between

But if control is my religion
Then I'm headin' for collision
Lost my 20/20 vision
Please

Whatcha doin' to me, baby?
I'm scared to death that you might be the one to change me
You're in my head and now you're cloudin' my decisions
Got me headin' for collision
Whatcha doin' to me, baby?
Oh, whatcha doin' to me?

Ooh, na-na-na
Tell me what you're doin' to me
Ooh, na-na-na-na
Tell me what you're doin' to me
Ooh, na-na-na
Tell me what you're doin' to me
Ooh, na-na-na-na
If control is my religion
Then I'm headin' for collision
Lost my 20/20 vision
Please (Tell me what you're doin' to me)
If control is my religion
Then I'm headin' for collision
Lost my 20/20 vision
Please

Whatcha doin' to me, baby?
I'm scared to death that you might be the one to change me
You're in my head and now you're cloudin' my decisions
Got me headin' for collision
Whatcha doin' to me, baby?
Oh, whatcha doin' to me?

Ooh, na-na-na
Tell me what you're doin' to me
Ooh, na-na-na-na
Tell me what you're doin' to me
Ooh, na-na-na
Tell me what you're doin' to me
Ooh, na-na-na-na
