Get your drink on
You can get over me
You can hang with your girls
But I'll be right home
And I would get over you
Empty drink
Trying to think of his new
Far away
So i can see all the things that you meant to me
Its like I kind enjoy this pain
But you always know how to find a way
Didn't think that last would be the last
Feel with comfit you don't care
I guess
You right
Many times
Even thougt
I never seem to understand
So I deserve for you to you hurt me
For all the times I pretend to be a man so
You can go to the club
Get your drink on
You can get over me
You can hang with your girls
But I'll be right home
And I would get over you
You can go to the club
Get your drink on
You can get over me
You can hang with your girls
But I'll be right home
And I would get over you
You might also likeI sleep awake
I always wonder where you are
Ring phone
For you to see my name
So you can hang up on me
Its like I kind enjoy this pain
But you always know how to find a way
Didn't think that last would be the last
Feel with comfit you don't care
I guess
You right
Many times
Even thougt
I never seem to understand
So I deserve for you to you hurt me
For all the times I pretend to be a man so
You can go to the club
Get your drink on
You can get over me
You can hang with your girls
But I'll be right home
And I would get over you
You can go to the club
Get your drink on
You can get over me
You can hang with your girls
But I'll be right home
