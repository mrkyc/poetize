Rain, rain, rain
Rain, rain, rain, rain
Well, didn't it rain, children
God's gonna send the waters from Zion
He's good raise his Heaven up higher
It's gonna rain. (Well, it's gonna rain.)
Well stop! Great God, stop still and listen
My God walked down by the briny sea
Beheld the evil of the sinful man;
Declared that he would destroy the land
He spoke to Noah; Noah stopped
He said: "Noah, I want you to build an ark
I want you to build it big and strong
Build it three hundred cubits along
Thirty high and fifty wide
'Cause it's got to stand that rain and tide."
Well, rain, children
God's gonna send the waters from Zion
He's good raise his Heaven up higher
It's gonna rain. (Well, it's gonna rain.)
Well, after God told him what to do
Noah began to cut and hew
The ringing of the saw cried "Judgement."
The ringing of the hammer cried "Sinner repent."
A hundred years, he hammered and sawed
Building the Ark by the Grace of God
After the foundation was laid
He hewed the timber and the Ark was made
"Lord, let it rain."
Behold the Ark was made
You might also likeOh, Noah
(Well, he called in the animals two by two.)
(The ox, and the camel, and the kangaroo.)
Oh, Noah
(Well, they called in Japeth, Ham and Shem.)
(And God began to flood the land.)
Oh, Noah
(He raised his hands to heaven on high.)
(He knocked the sun, the moon from the sky.)
Oh, Noah
(Shook the mountains and wobbled the sea.)
(And He hitched his reins to the chariot wheels.)
Oh, Noah
(Stepped on the land and stood on the shore.)
(And declared that time would be no more.)
Rain, rain, rain
Rain, rain, rain
Oh, Noah: Noah, didn't it rain
Rain, rain, rain
Rain, rain, rain
Rain, rain, rain, rain
My Lord, then the wind did blow and the Ark did rock
And Noah couldn't find nowhere to dock
My God spoke and he whispered low
Showed old Noah where he wanted him to go
He said: "Look a-here, Noah, the rain's done stopped
And I want you to land on the mountaintop."
Showed old Noah a rainbow sign
Said: "It won't be a rain but fire next time."
Rain, rain, rain
Rain, rain, rain
Oh, Noah: Noah, didn't it rain
Rain, rain, rain
Rain, rain, rain
