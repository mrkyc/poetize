That's why they call me the rock of Gibraltar
That's why they say my heart is made of stone
So don't you try to lead me to the altar
Because Gibraltar is standing alone
(Gibraltar is standing alone)
I've travelled all over from city light to clover
I'm selling brushes door to door
The ladies know me well they're buying what I sell
But I never let 'em ask for any more
And I never put my toes in a door that might be closin'
I try to use my winning ways
But when I know for certain the lady is a-flirtin'
I tell her I'll be back in thirty days
(That's why they call me the rock of Gibraltar
That's why they say my heart is made of stone)
So don't you try to lead me to the altar
Because Gibraltar is standing alone
(Yes, Gibraltar is standing alone)
Now when a lady rushes I sell her two more brushes
And then I leaver her at the door
I'm always thinking of the freedom that I love
'Cos I'm a man of freedom to the core
So it's not that I am choosy with Isabel or Susie
I just like to lead a happy life
Give me women, wine and song, then I know I can't go wrong
Until I take a woman for a wife

(Yes, Gibraltar is standing alone)
So it happened one morning without any warning
I knew that I had met my doom
She was pretty, she was sweet, she swept me off my feet
She didn't even have to buy a broom
They used to call me the rock of Gibraltar
And now they say my heart is made of clay
But after she had led me to the altar
Then old Gibraltar crumbled away
