I got off the riverboat in New Orleans
In the spring of '82
I walked into a gambling house
As gamblers often do

I had myself a drink and I joined in a poker game
The dealer was a woman, so I asked her for her name
She smiled at me so pretty, but a hush fell over the place
As a big man crossed the table, stood up and slapped my face

Bowie knife, bowie knife
Long, glitterin' steel
If my gun don't take your evil life
You can bet, my bowie knife will

I had my choice of weapons on which would depend my life
I chose a set of pistols and a long old bowie knife
I met him by the river by the light of the rising sun
Was I prepared to fight him? I feared my time had come

Bowie knife, bowie knife
Long, glitterin' steel
If my gun don't take your evil life
You can bet, my bowie knife will

As we stood back to back there on the duelin' green
I cursed the fate that had brought me to the town of New Orleans
The referee started counting the paces one by one
When I heard him say twenty, I turned and fired my gun

I knew at once I'd missed and I waited there in fear
As the stranger aimed and fired, but the bullet went by my ear
He threw away his pistol and drew his bowie knife
I knew that razor edge would soon snap off my life
But somehow luck was with me and my weapon found his side
He lay there on the duelin' ground and he cursed me as he died

Bowie knife, bowie knife
Long, glitterin' steel
If my gun don't take your evil life
