Stompin' in my gator boots

You think Im sexy cool
Just watch I'll see ya drool
Stop lookin' up and down
There's more of you to go around
Don't say I'm just a ditz
A tease, or just a flirt
'Cause I will promise this

Low rider jeans
Hug a little tighter
Oh yeah
Low rider jeans
Hug a little lower
Oh no
You think I'm sexy cool
Just watch I'll see ya drool
Stop lookin' up and down
There's more of you to go around
Don't say I'm just a ditz
A tease
Or just a flit
Cause I will promise this
I will play you just like this
Don't say I'm just a ditz
A tease
Or just a flit
Cause I will promise this
I will play you just like this
