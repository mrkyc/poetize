You know what today is?
(Of course I know what today is, it's your birthday, I bought you a gift)
What?
(Me, look what I got you)
Oh my God, can I have it

My shawty called me like you know it's 'bout to come
(Come come come)
I said, "Your friend shit, let me come get some (Some some some)"
She said, "You're stupid, boy, I'm talkin' bout my birthday
(Day, day, day)
I need some good dick in the worst way (Way, way, way)
It's going down, no hesitation
It's time to eat, pussy reservations
Them chocolate lips got me wanting Hershey kisses
Come blow my candle, girl, then make your birthday wishes

It's my birthday, so you know you want to hide out
Wanna stay inside with you even if it's at my house
Sip that Southern, boy, don't spill it on my couch
I feel good, but I want you to make me cry out
You know I want action, so boy, get ready
I want pleasure and passion, we building steady
You're so in to giving and so profounded
I'll tell you where to put your gift, boy
Boy, you know I-I-I, boy, you know I-I-I
I've been screaming, caught up in the late night
I'm dreaming about you in me
Boy, you know I-I-I, boy, you know I-I-I
I don't need candles and cake
Just need your frosting on me
Birthday sex

Feel the tension, pull my shirt over my head
Get on me and now we begin
Boy, I won't give up, I love the state I'm in
You almost lose it when I back begins to bend
We grinding with passion 'cause it's my birthday
I want satisfaction, so please, don't hurt me
You love me so sweetly, so please, don't hurt me
I'll tell you how I want my gift, boy

Boy, you know I-I-I, boy, you know I-I-I
I've been screaming, caught up in the late night

Boy, you know I-I-I, boy, you know I-I-I

Just need your frosting on me
