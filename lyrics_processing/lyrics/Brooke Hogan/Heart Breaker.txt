So I'm sittin' here
Guess I'm just another
I won't cry a tear, it won't make it better
Can't keep holdin' on
She'll forget about you
But now that you're gone, have to live without you

I was just another girl to you
You had me believing I was your baby
And I was so lucky
But I can't be mad at you
'Cause I should've known better to give my heart away
Yeah, yeah
To a heart, heart breaker

No more cryin' here, you just left me broken
You say you don't care, so the door is closing
And I'll tell you off, but my heart won't even
'Cause I want your love, but I have to leave it

I was just another girl to you
You had me believing I was your baby
And I was so lucky
But I can't be mad at you
'Cause I should've known better to give my heart away
Yeah yeah
To a heart, heart breaker

Won't bring me down no more
Gotta show ya I'm alright
Lose these strings and cut you off

Maybe this is just better that we're gone
You stabbed me in the back
Ive been lonely
I don't wanna deal with this anymore
Yea
You go on without me
I was just another girl to you
You had me believing I was your baby
And I was so lucky
But I can't be mad at you
'Cause I should've known better to give my heart away
Yeah yeah
To a heart, heart breaker

You had me believing I was your baby
And I was so lucky
But I can't be mad at you
