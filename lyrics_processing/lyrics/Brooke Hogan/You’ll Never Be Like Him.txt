I wish you smiled like him
You walked like him and talked like him
And love me as good as he did
I try to imagine him livin' in your skin, but you're not like him
So why do I even compare?

I think 'bout now and how it was then
And how it was with him and I try to see
All those qualities livin' in you, but

You're nothin' like the man I used to love
And you'll never do what he does
I'm reluctant to find that the more I try
To make you fit in, you'll never be like him
You'll never be like him
Never be, never be like him

I wish you kissed like him
You felt like him and held like him
And touched me the way that he did
I try to see his face in your place
'Cause I can't erase the way I felt when he was mine
I think 'bout now and how it was then
And how it was with him and I try to see
All those qualities livin' in you but
You might also like
You're nothin' like the man I used to love
And you'll never do what he does
I'm reluctant to find that the more I try
To make you fit in, you'll never be like him

There's no chance for romance (For romance)
There's no way I would stay (No, no, no)
I won't always get what I want
But I'm not gonna settle for less
I'm gonna go my own way

You're nothin' like the man I used to love
And you'll never do what he does
I'm reluctant to find that the more I try
To make you fit in, you'll never be like him
You're nothin' like the man I used to love
And you'll never do what he does
I'm reluctant to find that the more I try
To make you fit in, you'll never be like him
