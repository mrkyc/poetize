Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Some say love and friends, they don't mix
But I can't help the way that I feel (Hey yo!)
Seeing you makes my day (Hey yo!)
Seeing you makes my day (Oh)
I know you and me, it seems weird
But I think we should consider it (Hey, yo!)
Seeing you makes my day (Hey, yo!)
Seeing you makes my day

Your smile's like candy
So sweet and sincere
Your style is so sexy
I love when you're near
Our vibe is like Heaven
You and I are like wind
So cool, it's refreshing
Where do I begin?

Me and you would be like Christmas Day (Christmas day)
'Cause when you smile
You shine like the month of May (Month of May)
But there's no rush, we'll take our time, ok? (Time, ok?)
But I had to let you know
Just in case it didn't show (Oh)
You might also like
Some say love and friends, they don't mix
But I can't help the way that I feel (Hey yo!)
Seeing you makes my day (Hey yo!)
Seeing you makes my day (Oh)

But I think we should consider it (Hey, yo!)
Seeing you makes my day (Hey, yo!)
Seeing you makes my day

I ain't felt this way in a minute
Hey, you and me, are you with it?
Yes, 'cause I only got eyes for you (Hey)
'Cause you know that I'd ride for you
I know you won't suffer
With me as your man
I promise to show ya
A love that can win

Me and you would be like Christmas Day
