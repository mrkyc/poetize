Yeah
It's such a shame
When someone you were born to love
Isn't that person anymore
This one's for you
I love you
But you gotta change

When you said that you would never change
Was it true?
Do it to save all we had
Would you?
How could you give up?
How could you do that?
Why did you leave me?
And when you come back
Spending all your time with him, you can't even see me
Selfish with your words, how you mistreated your own kids
How could you do that?
I know we don't talk now
How could you turn your back on me?
Now I'm walkin' out

'Cause I didn't do anything to hurt you
I gave you the best that I can and it's true, baby
I try and I just can't help you
I still love you, but
I gotta move on without you
I should've moved on from the pain that I felt
But I chose to love you, the shit that you had, baby
I've learned to live without you
That's something, that is the truth
It's better to live then love you
(You, you, you, you, you, you)
Yeah
(You, you, you, you, you, you)
It's better to live than love you
(You, you, you, you, you, you)
I love you
(You, you, you, you, you, you)
You might also like
But if you're leavin', is that what you can do to your baby?
'Cause I'm gonna love you no matter what you were sayin'
How could you turn away
And forget those sunny days?
But were they the sunny days
Or was it the game you played?
Perfect little doll that you can toy with that messed up
How can you be criticizing me when you fucked up?
I never made you cry
I never told you lies
That's all you do to me
So what is your alibi?

'Cause I didn't do anything to hurt you
I gave you the best that I can and it's true, baby
I try and I just can't help you
I still love you, but
I gotta move on without you
I should've moved on from the pain that I felt
But I chose to love you, the shit that you had, baby
I've learned to live without you
That's something, that is the truth
It's better to live then love you
(You, you, you, you, you, you)
Yeah
(You, you, you, you, you, you)
It's better to live than love you
(You, you, you, you, you, you)
I love you
(You, you, you, you, you, you)
How was I the screw up and you were the best mom?
I wasn't that perfect and you took the long road
The road is reversing, the tables are turning
I didn't deserve it, but thank god I'm learnin'
I can just imagine what you're doing with your days
Smokin' all your cares away and having a playdate
Too bad I found out what you were really about
I know it won't screw your day, but momma, I gotta say

That I didn't do anything to hurt you
I gave you the best that I can and it's true, baby
I try and just can't help you
I still love you, but
I gotta move on without you
I should've moved on from the pain that I felt
But I chose to love you, the shit that you had, baby
I've learned to live without you
That's something, that is the truth
It's better to live then love you

You know what, stop coming to me for help
Mom, you sound like you're crazy
I don't know what you're talking about
What?
I'm not helping
Get your little ass right out of this house
What do you want me to do? Don't come back
What?
Get outta my way
Stressing me out
Momma, get outta my way
You and your man can go live at your place (It's your life)
It's all this shit I can't take
(No, oh, oh, yeah, yeah)

'Cause I didn't do anything to hurt you
I gave you the best that I can and it's true, baby
I try and I just can't help you
I still love you, but
I gotta move on without you (I gotta move on without you)
I should've moved on from the pain that I felt
(But I chose to love you, the shit that you had, baby)
I've learned to live without you
That's something, that is the truth
