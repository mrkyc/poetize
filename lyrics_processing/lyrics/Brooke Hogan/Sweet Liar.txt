So sweet, sweet, liar, liar, liar, liar, oh, oh

Sweet, sweet liar
You are my one desire
Just caught your pants on fire baby
You feel like turing it up
Keep, keep hiding your secrets little liar
You got me so on fire baby
It feels like, it feels like

I'm gonna tell you something
That I think you already know
I'm something special
And I don't believe in your circular house
I'm maybe nice but that doesn't mean
I don't know how to fight
Fuckin' around lonely makes the consequences say

If you take the quite
I might just start a riot
You're good at playing nice
But your heart is made of ice
Yeah

My intuition tells me
Something about yours kinda hot
Cause when we're freakin'
It's 10 minutes or 2 minutes sounds
I know I rock my shit so now
We know it's not my fault
So what's your big excuse
You're taking too many girls
If you take the quite
I might just start a riot
You're good at playing nice
But your heart is made of ice
