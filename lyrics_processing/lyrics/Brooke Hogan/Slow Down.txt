Baby boy, why you walking away?
Don't act like you can't talk to me
Pump the breaks, it's a red light
Wanna know what you're doing tonight
Don't let the sweet talk through you off
Don't get it wrong, yeah, I'm the boss
I don't know what you've heard
I'm better than the rest, boy, that's my word

Baby, you're so beautiful
All I wanna know is, can I talk to you tonight?
Slow down, boy, and talk to me
Sexy, you're so beautiful
Baby, come on over here, I'll make you feel alright
Slow down, boy

Tell me boy, how you do this to me
One look at you, I can't breathe now
Hypnotized by your style
I can't believe how quickly I fell
And by the way that you're slowing down
I bet you like the way that sounds
Come on, baby, let's go
Can't let you leave without me, no, no
