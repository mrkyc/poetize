What I gotta do to get it through to you
That I'm the only one who can love you like I do
Seems like I try to get away
Trying almost every day
To find a way to you
But you walk away
You turn your face
It's like when I'm there
You don't know my name
And I'm kind of scared
'Cause if I try again
I'm afraid that if I do
I'll never get a chance

If I come too close, would you pull away?
Will you dance too far?
Would you turn away?
If I choose to stay, if I want to go
Would it break your heart?
Would you even know?
Cause it's, it's just too much
Too much for me to even take
It's not enough
Enough for my heart anyway
It's just as tough
It's just as tough for me tonight
And I'll be the one that got away
And I'll be the one that got away
You might also like
I want to satisfy both of your sides
Show you the truth
When you're living a lie
Before you were hurt
I put my life on the line
That's how much you mean to me
I may be crazy, a little confused
But all that really means is I'm crazy for you
Baby, you want me, you need me
You really gotta have me
You know I'm waiting here
I'ma always make you happy

If I come too close, would you pull away?
Will you dance too far?
Would you turn away?
If I choose to stay if I want to go
Would it break your heart?
Would you even know?
Cause it's, it's just too much
Too much for me to even take
It's not enough
Enough for my heart anyway
It's just as tough
It's just as tough for me tonight
And I'll be the one that got away
And I'll be the one that got away
It's just as tough, we all don't see the same thing
We try to talk, but you don't understand it, babe
I gotta work, 'cause my money is a major thing
So when you see me, you're never feeling outta space
I bought my house, cars, jewels, and my lifestyle
I think of you and me, that picture isn't right now
Forget the fights now, everything we went through
Mighta been a lot of shh but it led me on to you
What could I do, sittin' there all by myself, girl?
Too many nights we spent, wonderin' bout life and
If somebody near to me would be harmed
Would you be there in the morning tellin' me to hold on?
Gotta go on, there's reasons that I keep to myself
Damn right, from beginnin', never charm on my wealth
Put me under no shelf, I show you how we can be
Put us up against the odds, we can stand on our feet

Cause it's, it's just too much
Too much for me to even take
It's not enough
Enough for my heart anyway
It's just as tough
It's just as tough for me tonight
