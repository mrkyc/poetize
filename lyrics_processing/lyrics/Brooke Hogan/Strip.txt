I just
I just wanna see you strip
Yeah, just strip for me
Uh-huh

Welcome to the freakshow
Thanks for coming, joinin' me
I'll just show you what I want
Then just repeat after me
If you're feeling kinda kinky, I can really turn you on
All I need is your cooperation, come and play along

You know that I love you, babe
Come on, let's take our clothes off
We can be together, baby
Then we can doze off
If you get freaky with me
There's nothing wrong with that
It's beautiful naturally
But first, I gotta say

I wanna see you strip for me
Take it all off, honey
Wanna see your body
'Cause it's only for me
I wanna see you rock it off your body
Put a show on for me
Come and put it on me
I wanna see you strip
I wanna see you strip
Baby, would you strip?
I wanna see you strip
Yeah

Gettin' down to nothing, I can see it coming
I have waited for you
So know that I'm turnin' blue
Spiritual, our connection
Deeper than the ocean
I'm 20,000 leagues in Heaven under the sea

You know that I love you, babe
Come on, let's take our clothes off
We can be together, baby
Then we can doze off
If you get freaky with me
There's nothing wrong with that
It's beautiful naturally
But first, we gotta strip

I wanna see you strip for me
Take it all off, honey
Wanna see your body
'Cause it's only for me
I wanna see you rock it off your body
Put a show on for me
Come and put it on me
I wanna see you strip
I wanna see you strip
Oh baby, please let me (Strip)
Like it when you strip, baby
I can barely handle that (Strip)
Connected by the second
I want more of it
Show me just a little and babe
I'll show you more
Stripper is my alter-name
And strippin' is the goal
Strip

I wanna see you strip for me
Take it all off, honey
Wanna see your body
'Cause it's only for me
I wanna see you rock it off your body
Put a show on for me
Come and put it on me

I wanna see you strip
