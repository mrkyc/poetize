Yo, baby, what's up?

I've been around him, and I know what he's about
Shining those fancy things, but it's not what he's made out of
He takes good care of me and loves me when I'm down
He's my best friend to me, and damn, he makes me proud

So now I'm feeling like I'm choked up
Wrote you a text
Yeah, we broke up
I tried to settle some things
But now that game's done
I see your face red
You're gettin wasted
You play with fire
It'll get you like you're K-Fed
We on the record, baby
You got a second maybe
And ya'll know who I am
Sorry, Chelsea Lately
Let's teach it as a lesson
Man, you fall from Heaven
This redemption is the only thing my mind's stressing
You might also like
And I'm falling for him
I'm falling in love
I never thought I'd fall in love
I never thought I'd fall in (Yeah)
And I'm falling for him
I'm falling in love
I never thought I'd fall in love
I never thought I'd fall in

When life is hard on him, he wants me by his side
When I lie next to him, he holds me through the night
I'll build a life for him, I'll keep him safe and warm
When he comes home to me, I'll be right at the door

And now I'm knocking at your door, miss
Open up, looking gorgeous
Fly from head to toe
She smiles, a metamorphis
Sunshine shines
The clouds can run their course
When we set sail, everything is in orbit
Fight, but never forefit
Who knows you best?
Let's take an overseas trip on my private jet
And like that, we reconnect
Eyes and spirit
I'm falling deep for your love
And I don't care who hear it
And I'm falling for him
I'm falling in love
I never thought I'd fall in love
I never thought I'd fall in
And I'm falling for him
I'm falling in love
I never thought I'd fall in love
I never thought I'd fall in

Baby, you don't know how much I need you (Need you)
You know I would give up everything to be with you
Got me crazy, wanna break you off (Sometimes)
And, baby, I love you
And I don't deserve you

And I'm falling for him (I'm falling for him)
I'm falling in love
I never thought I'd fall in love
I never thought I'd fall in
And I'm falling for him
I'm falling in love
I never thought I'd fall in love
I never thought I'd fall in
Yeah
