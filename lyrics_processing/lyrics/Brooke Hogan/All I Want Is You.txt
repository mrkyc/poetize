You make my mind completely crazy
You turn my world into a storm
And if I had it my way, baby
You would be right here
And I wish you were near
All I wanna think of lately
Is you and me and nothing else, oh no
So come on, baby, won't ya take me?
I know you see right through, there's nothing I can do

'Cause all I want is you and all I want is
All I need is you, and all I need is
All I want is you, yeah, all I want is you
Yeah, you, yeah, you, all I want is you, yeah

And when I need someone to save me
You're always right there by my side, oh yeah
You make it hard to hate you, baby
There's nothing I can do 'cause I'm so in love with you
And baby, all I need is you

'Cause all I want is you, and all I want is
All I need is you (All I want is you), and all I need is
All I want is you, yeah, all I want is you
Yeah, you, yeah, you, all I want is you, want is you
All I want is you, yeah, you
You might also like
No matter where I seem to go
You're in my heart, you're in my soul
You're inside me, appear in all my dreams
When I need you to come through
There's nothing I can't do
As long as I have you (You)
As long as I have you
A-a-all I need

'Cause all I want is you, and all I want is
All I need is you, and all I need is (All I need is you)
All I want is you, yeah, all I want is you
Yeah, you, yeah, you, all I want is you (All I want is you)
All I need is you, all I want is you
All I need is you, all I want is you
