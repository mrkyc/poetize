You're gonna miss that crazy love (You're gonna miss that)
You're gonna miss my sexy body (Crazy lovin', baby)

I tried to love you
I backed up off you
Didn't crowd your space
I should have known better
For you I do whatever it takes
But you had to get greedy
And you made it look easy
Lie to my face
Lately its been a lie
A helpless case

One of these mornings
You're gonna wake up to an empty bed
You can say what you want but you know
You'll never get me outta your head

You're gonna miss that crazy lovin', baby
Right after we fight
You're gonna miss my sexy body
Underneath the covers at night
You're gonna miss me coming out my clothes
The way I used to take it slow
And make you go, oh
You're gonna miss my love
You might also like
Left me a message, I really messed up
Baby pick up
Can't live without you
All of a sudden you claim your ready for love
Am I supposed to believe you
Never want to believe, you'll say anything
Truth is that you're incapable of change

One of these mornings
You're gonna wake up to an empty bed
You can say what you want
But you know you'll never get (My love) out of your head, yeah

You're gonna miss that crazy lovin', baby
Right after we fight
You're gonna miss my sexy body
Underneath the covers at night
You're gonna miss me coming out my clothes
The way I used to take it slow
And make you go, oh
You're gonna miss my love

Who's gonna give you all the crazy lovin' that I gave you?
Shook you, know can curl your toes
Waking up the neighbors (Like me)
Can't nobody do it, baby
Who you think you're foolin', baby
What were you thinking of
You're gonna miss my love, yeah yeah
You're gonna miss that crazy lovin', baby
Right after we fight
You're gonna miss my sexy body
Underneath the covers at night
You're gonna miss me coming out my clothes
The way I used to take it slow
And make you go, oh
You're gonna miss my love
You're gonna miss that crazy lovin', baby
Right after we fight
You're gonna miss my sexy body
Underneath the covers at night
You're gonna miss me coming out my clothes
The way I used to take it slow
And make you go, oh
You're gonna miss my love
You're gonna miss that crazy love
You're gonna miss my sexy body
You're gonna miss that crazy love
You're gonna miss my sexy body
Underneath the covers at night
