Lately, I've been thinkin' about the ups and downs
We've been through together
And how we almost lost our ground
But we held on, long enough to see
All the good outweighed the bad
And I'm thankful, so grateful
For everything we have

But for a moment
I thought I lost everything
For a moment
I forgot about our memories
Then I woke up and I realized
How much you mean to me
For a moment
I thought I lost you and me

My first love, my first kiss
I shared both of them with you
From the first time we locked eyes
I knew you and I would be the truth
(And since then)
You've lied to me, I've lied to you
When we made up
And I'm thankful, so grateful
For everything we have
You might also like
So beautiful (So beautiful)
It's what we own (It's what we own)
I'm your sky (I'm your sky)
And you're my star (You, my star)
All the trials (Yeah)
That we've been through (That we've been through)
Only made us who we are today

But for a moment
I (I) thought lost everything (I thought I lost everything)
For a moment
I (Ooh, yeah) forgot about our memories (Memories)
Then I woke up and I realized (Then I woke up and I realized)
How much you mean to me (Ooh, but for a moment)
For a moment
I (I) thought lost you and me
I thought I lost you and me

You're connected to everything (Everything)
And everybody that matters to me (To me)
You're the center of all my joy (My joy)
Without you, what would I be?
I thought I lost my best friend
My perfect world came to an end
But it was just a dream
(Ooh, it felt like reality)
For a moment, I thought I lost everything
For a moment, I forgot about the memories
And then I opened my heart

Then I woke up and I realized (Then I woke up and I realized)
How much you mean to me (Ooh, but for a moment)
For a moment
I (I) thought I lost you and me
I thought I lost you and me
