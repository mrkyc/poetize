"Umm, hey Brooke, what's up, this is Heidi Montag
I just wanna let you know, that I'm making a record
And your record better watch it's back
And if you think this Stack$ is awesome
Wait for Spencer, bye"

Twinkle twinkle little star
Grant this wish tonight
Please just tell me who you are
Cocky, full of spite
Coast guards friends, family nad foe
They are like the same
But I just wanna call you out
And make you say my name (Bitch!)
Be cocky if you wanna but we takin' all ya dollars
While you sit, just watching me
Poppin' on your TV screen
Morales couldn't get it
Got your hit, we just writ it
Soak it up, here to stay
TV shows from here to Spain

And there's nothing I can do
I just wanna rock it out
And we from the South
We about to pump it out
And there's nothing I can say
And I'm gonna go my way
So just watch me rock
Wishin' you could get that hot
Wishin' you could get that hot
Wishin' you could get that hot

Sometimes, Brooke, this shit just seems
That everybody wants to discuss me
Chelsea Lately's, got a thing for me
And I don't know why that bitch hates me
Maybe it's the dreams that she has in bed
And she thinks of you and your massive head
I'll admit, my head got its own address
But you're not gonna mind and I'll bust yours in
Jit Jit, tell me where you at
Sittin' in the back, bad bitch on my lap
Hallways got your back in fact
I've done six shots in a Spencer Pratt
Bitch how's that?
What'cha gonna do
I'm an icon and I don't like you
This is Sobe's world is where we live, fuck you
Its Judgement Day and never been cool like that

And there's nothing I can do
I just wanna rock it out
And we from the South
We about to pump it out
And there's nothing I can say
And I'm gonna go my way
So just watch me rock
Wishin' you could get that hot
Wishin' you could get that hot
Wishin' you could get that hot
Uh ha uh ha
DJ Irie, baby
This is Judgment Day
The mixtape to end all mixtapes
Brooke Hogan
Aww man, before the redemption comes the Judgment Day
Yo Brookie, put it down all the way down, baby
Come on

And there's nothing I can do
I just wanna rock it out
And we from the south
We've got to pump it out
And there's nothing I can say
And I'm gonna go my way
So just watch me rock
Wishin' you could get that hot
Wishin' you could get that hot
Wishin' you could get that hot
Wishin' you could get that hot
Wishin' you could get that hot

It's the second time coming
And my homegirl ain't playin'
Straight smashes
Straight hits
It's crazy
It's the redemption, in stores, July 21st
We need that
