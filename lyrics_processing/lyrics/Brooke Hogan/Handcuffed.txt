Oh baby, tie me up
'Cause I'm in love with you
Hancuffed, cuffed, cuffed
Tie me up
'Cause I'm in love with you

You got me handcuffed
Locked up, cardiac arrest, baby
'Cause I'm in love with you
You got me handcuffed
Don't stop, tie me up right now, baby
That's all I wanna do

I've been around just a couple of times
But not enough to know whats really right
And I've been hurt just a couple or more
Yes, it's happened to me more than twice
And so I lost all my hope and I finally figured I
Would have to be left on my own
But then you came around and you showed me what it's like
To be enforced by love (Oh)

You got me handcuffed
Locked up, cardiac arrest, baby
'Cause I'm in love with you
You got me handcuffed
Don't stop, tie me up right now, baby
That's all I wanna do
You might also like
I'm so relieved that I'm finally caught
And boy, you're free to force me, just so you know
Just tie me up and secure the lock
And please don't ever think of letting me go
So just swallow the key
Never lettin' go of me
And I'll never let go of you
I'm your prisoner now
So don't ever let me out
And keep an extra eye on me too (Ohh)

You got me handcuffed
Locked up, cardiac arrest, baby
'Cause I'm in love with you
You got me handcuffed
Don't stop, tie me up right now, baby
That's all I wanna do

Baby, got your handcuffs
Go 'head and tie me up
Get out your handcuffs
Go head and tie me up
Handcuffed
Handcuffed
You got me handcuffed
Locked up, cardiac arrest, baby
'Cause I'm in love with you
You got me handcuffed
Don't stop, tie me up right now, baby
That's all I wanna do

Get out your handcuffs
Go 'head and tie me up
You got your handcuffs
Go 'head and tie me up
Get out your handcuffs
'Cause I'm in love with you
