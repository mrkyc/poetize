Boys talkin' down
On the sidelines, watchin'
Wishin' they was playin' the game we playin'
But it's all good though, Paul Wall
Brooke, what up, baby?
What's it to you, Paul Wall?

I see your lips movin', but I don't hear nothin' (Naw)
Everybody talkin' like they really know somethin' 'bout us
(They don't know, baby) But they don't know nothin' 'bout us
(They don't know, baby, they don't know about it)
I see your lips movin', but I don't hear nothin' (Naw)
Everybody's talkin' like they really wanna know about us
(They don't know, baby) But they don't know nothin' 'bout us
(They don't know about it, baby, talk to 'em, Brooke)

I'm just tryin' to live, but you're all up in my grill
How's a girl to breathe with the media
Starin' down my mouth, with a fo' inch lens?
I just wanna hit the mall with some of my friends
And I need to clear my mind
'Cause they're driving me insane
I be switchin' lanes down 95
Swervin' in my E-class, sunroof popped
With my stunner shades on
'Cause the haters won't stop, no!
You might also like
I see your lips movin', but I don't hear nothin' (Naw)
Everybody talkin' like they really know somethin' 'bout us
(They don't know, baby) But they don't know nothin' 'bout us
(They don't know, baby, they don't know about it)
I see your lips movin', but I don't hear nothin' (Naw)
Everybody's talkin' like they really wanna know about us
(They don't know, baby) But they don't know nothin' 'bout us
(They don't know about you, baby, talk to 'em, Brooke)

What it do?
I hear the commentators on the side chatterboxin'
Paul Wall and Brooke got all the paparazzi watchin'
I hear 'em jaw-jappin, bumpin' gums, chasin' crumbs
We ain't concerned with the bums, we accumulatin' funds
Flash the wrist, got the Johnny Dane watch froze
Five karat with the yellow stone in my earlobe
I'm squashin' chatter when the light hit the pinky ring
Starched and clean, white cup full of lean
See me in the new Benz cause I'm also ballin'
Or a old school slab with the fifth wheels fallin'
We got 'em talkin', but really, they ain't sayin' too much
Just speculatin' with they gossip
Truth is, they don't know about us
I see your lips movin', but I don't hear nothin' (No)
Everybody talkin' like they really know somethin 'bout us
They don't know about us, they don't know nothin' 'bout us
They don't know about us
I see your lips movin', but I don't hear nothin' (Naw)
Everybody's talkin' like they really wanna know about us
(They don't know, baby) But they don't know nothin' 'bout us
(They don't know, baby) But they don't know nothin' 'bout us

Stop, stop, stop
I'm not listening, you can save your breath
I don't wanna hear the rumors people are spreading
Why (Why), why do people go, out of their way
To try to bring us down? They don't know nothin' 'bout us

I see your lips movin', but I don't hear nothin' (Naw)
Everybody talkin' like they really know somethin' 'bout us
(They don't know baby) But they don't know nothin' 'bout us
(They don't know, baby, they don't know about us)
I see your lips movin', but I don't hear nothin' (Naw)
Everybody's talkin' like they really wanna know about us
(They don't know about you, baby) But they don't know nothin' 'bout us
(They don't know about you, baby)
