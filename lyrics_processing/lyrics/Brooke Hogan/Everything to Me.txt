You wanna go
And as you open up the door, you change your mind
I'm not something to leave behind
You'll never know
All these things I feel inside, I wanna show you
There's nothing out there to find

Oh baby, I
I wanna make you see
There's nothing more to fear
'Cause everything's right here

I'm everything you want
I'm everything you need
And every little part of you is a part a me
I'm everything you know
I'm everywhere you go
And I hope that you see
That you're everything to me

Oh yeah
Everything to me
Yeah
You might also like
Whisper to me
I hang on every word you say
Don't tell me no, as you turn and walk
Don't shut me out
I'm much stronger than you know
But you're on your way
You'll be back with me someday

Oh, baby, I
I wanna make you see (I wanna make you see)
There's nothing more to fear
'Cause everything's right here

I'm everything you want
I'm everything you need
And every little part of you is a part a me
(Wish you could be, yeah)
I'm everything you know
I'm everywhere you go
And I hope that you see
That you're everything to me
Oh yeah
I understand your confusion
In denial, disillusioned
But I won't wait too long
And I just might move on
I'm buried by your indecision
Digging for the life I'm missing
Just look inside and see
I hope there's room for me

Oh baby, I
I wanna make you see, yeah
There's nothing more to fear
'Cause everything's right here

I'm everything you want
I'm everything you need (Everything you need)
And every little part of you is a part a me (Yeah, that you could be, yeah)
I'm everything you know
I'm everywhere you go (Go)
And I hope that you see (And I hope that you see)
That you're everything to me
I'm everything you want
I'm everything you need (Everything you need)
And every little part of you is a part a me (Yeah, that you could be, ooh, yeah)
I'm everything you know
I'm everywhere you go (Go)
And I hope that you see (And I hope that you see)
That you're everything to me
I'm everything you want (Everything, everything)
I'm everything you need (Everything to me)
And every little part of you is a part a me (Yeah, that you could be, yeah)
I'm everything you know
I'm everywhere you go (Go)
