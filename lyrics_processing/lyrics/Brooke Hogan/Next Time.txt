Ah, here we go

Oh, I'm just lookin' for a guy
That's got some of every little thing I want
Not trying to play with my mind
I hope you do better next time
I'm just lookin' for a guy
That's got some of every little thing I want
Not trying to play with my mind (Oh, yeah)
I hope you do better next time

You thought I didn't hear about it
You thought that I wouldn't care
Why was I the last to know it?
So now you're not playin' fair
She told me every time you call her
How you give her your photograph
So now I'm just laughin' at ya
'Cause one chick's gone, can't have it back

Everybody knows the truth, the joke's on you
I'm lettin' go of everything we used to do
I don't even wanna think about it
Sittin' home all alone, I doubt it
Gotta go, pick up my phone
And I'm not callin' you
So please don't act surprised (No, no)
Because I told you for the last time
You might also like
So I'm lookin' for a guy
Who can hang with me all night
Gotta know just what I like
Speeding off in a jag and I'm gettin' butterflies
So I hope you do better next time
So why would I sit out on the side?
'Cause I'm movin' on with my life
Gotta find me a guy who can give me butterflies
So I hope you do better next time

It's funny how now you want me
I like how the tables turn
I used to be cryin' for ya but I'm no longer concerned
So now we can both be honest and I can finally be me
According to what I'm feelin'
I'm better off bein' free

Everybody knows the truth, the joke's on you
I'm lettin' go of everything we used to do
I don't even wanna think about it (Yeah)
Sittin' home all alone, I doubt it
Gotta go, pick up my phone
And I'm not callin' you
So, please, don't act surprised
Because I told you for the last time
So I'm lookin' for a guy
Who can hang with me all night
Gotta know just what I like
Speeding off in a jag and I'm gettin' butterflies
So I hope you do better next time
So why would I sit out on the side?
'Cause I'm movin' on with my life
Gotta find me a guy who can give me butterflies
So I hope you do better next time
Oh, I'm just lookin' for a guy
That's got some of every little thing I want
Not trying to play with my mind
I hope you do better next time
I'm just lookin' for a guy
That's got some of every little thing I want (I want)
Not trying to play with my mind (My mind)
I hope you do better next time

Everybody knows the truth, the joke's on you (The truth)
I'm lettin' go of everything we used to do
I don't even wanna think about it (Talk about it)
Sittin' home all alone, I doubt it
Gotta go, pick up my phone
And I'm not callin' you
So, please, don't act surprised
Because I told you for the last time
Here we go, what I like
What I like, can you, right?
