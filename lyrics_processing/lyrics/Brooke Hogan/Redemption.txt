This is my redemption
Nothing left but to forgive you
After all the shit thats happened
My heart is broken my head is confused
But I will, I will keep marchin on
A phoenix rising up to heaven
So I guess I'll see you around
Its the begging a redemption
So God, can you hear me?
All my people can you hear me
All my haters can you hear me
You can't stop me oh no no no no
Nothing can stop me
So don't let it stop you
Negativity and hate have tried to take me down
But I rise above
You might also likeLike a phoenix rising
I will rise above
Like a poor man crying
I'm gonna change my luck
No one No one can tell you how to live your life
Baby and no one no one could ever phantom all the strife
Yea oh
So God, can you hear me?
Mom and daddy can you hear me
All my lovers can you hear me
They couldn't stop me oh no no no no
Oh no no no no

There's a light at the end of that tunnel
With good vibrations
The happiness, success
Thats whats headed for you
