Thinking 'bout my niggas that ain't make it this far
Damn, why you had to take it that far?
Damn, stiff body, layin' by the car
Damn, I know his daughter finna take it hard
Still got a bond that I'll never break apart
Birthday's comin' up, we a day apart
I know the love real, 'cause you said it with your heart
And the nigga that was with you when you died, he a mark
In the comfort of my home, gettin' high in the dark
Hard to carry on and live life when you scarred, yeah
I remember nights we was starved
The struggle that you go through defines who you are
Margiela cleats when it's time to go to war
Showin' up for a fat k-da with a sword
It ain't hard to tell that my gang outdoors
On the hunt, scorin' up on anything you adore

I sat on this bunk and I prayed for this life
I used to pray for this life
Day in, day out, I would beg for this life
A lot of misfortune that came with this life
I sat on this bunk and I prayed for this life
I used to pray for this life
Day in, day out, I would beg for this life
A lot of misfortune that came with this life

Pull up on 4th, make sure auntie alright
I went to court and said, "Yankee ain't mine"
Pull up my priors, don't play with them nines
We hold it up high when we bangin' them signs
Devoted with pride, pole on my side
Thank God for the day when I opened my eyes
Your partners is snakes, nigga, open your eyes
Learn to recline when they showin' you signs
Never kept score of that dough, I divided
Though you my brother, I know you connivin'
Moment of silence, this for the rivals
I pray that you die, on the Bible
Them choppers don't spin in a spiral
They hit somethin' vital and that was for Diamond
Poverty stricken, my trenches, it's slimy
They bring up my demons, why must you remind me?
