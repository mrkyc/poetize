Bangin' the same gang her son died for
So we pay for the funeral then we slide for him
The good die young, shit I can only vouch
Conversatin' with the clouds like, "I'ma hold you down"
Ya momma hardly smile since she lost her child
She couldn't even view ya body without fallin' out
And every time I hit her line we just talk about you
She be tellin' me funny shit I didn't know about you
She can only hear ya voice is what she once said
We took them field trips for you, killa, we ain't done yet
You my circle within a circle, a subset
You livin' through me, it's unconditional, nothin' less

I hugged my nigga momma when he died
She just started cryin', she cried and she cried
If you could only see the pain in her eyes
'Cause he ain't comin' back, you gotta take it up with God
I hugged my nigga momma when he died
She just started cryin', she cried and she cried
If you could only see the pain in her eyes
'Cause he ain't comin' back, you gotta take it up with God

I dropped a few tears and I couldn't help it
Niggas died behind the steel, feelin' helpless
I don't feel no better, slidin' with his facials on my sweater
Represent this Mays block shit forever
That's on my Uncle Trevor
My lil brother passed, I held his momma
Put that on my dead son bruh, I got her, it's forever
With ya brother, stomped the same puddles in the gutter
Wish I had the chance to tell bruh I love him
I ain't switchin', not at all
The hood lightweight fallin' off
Since you passed, I ain't had no one to call
They ain't fuckin' wit ya nigga
They say I'm fuckin' wit some other niggas
They ain't fuckin' wit, so I ain't fuckin' wit 'em
I ain't trippin', fuck it nigga

Bang in peace Deezy, that's my brother for real
Momma Tony know I love her for real
She like my momma for real
Had to sit and watch her suffer for real
That's a hell of a woman for real
Shit come with the field
Shed tears for Lil Diamond in jail
Momma Red sick, that shit took her through hell
Deray laid bleedin', I remember the smell
Somebody gotta feel what I feel
You done been there before
Can't even count how many niggas is gone
Wish y'all was here now that niggas is on
You don't hear me though
You could never understand the way my youngin' raised
Try to sympathize, but never understand a mother's pain
I hugged my nigga momma when he died
