You the type that'll suck a dick to get a nigga on the song, period
If you ain't never split a backend, how you put me on? No, seriously
Niggas be killin' me, they want me gone, it's hard to get rid of me

Remember when they made the bitch turn her purse inside out immediately
You was callin' 'round, lookin' for a lil' sympathy, nigga, you shittin' me?
