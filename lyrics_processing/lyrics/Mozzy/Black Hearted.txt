Still feel it
I just deal with it
Can't even place a call to Zo
He would've been on all the tours, that's my real nigga
He would've been on all the tours, that's my real nigga
He would've been on all the tours, that's my real nigga

Painkillers for the pain but I still feel it
Still suffer as a man, I just deal with it
Can't even place a call to Zo, it feel different
He would've been on all the tours, that's my real nigga
I got a couple quarter rims in the gravel chillin'
I want to see my brothers eat, we ain't in competition
Fuck a label, I was turnin' down they proposition
They wasn't talkin' 'bout no chicken, lot of faulty business
Roaches crawlin' through the dishes that we finna use
And Payless where my mama had me pickin' tennis shoes
After all that I been through, I ain't finna lose
The streets feel like if I did it, they can do it too
Ayy it's beyond bulletproof when it come to mines
Drop a hundred, take a hundred trips a hundred times
They yellin' death before dishonor, that's a fuckin' lie
It ain't no death before dishonor, motherfuckin' lie

It's like the slums got a hold of me
I'm black-hearted, kind of like my heart froze on me
I lost the ones closest to me, now I'm soul-searching
Born cursed but I deserve worse, Hell Gang worship
The slums got a hold of me
I'm black-hearted, kind of like my heart froze on me
I lost the ones closest to me, now I'm soul-searching
Born cursed but I deserve worse, Hell Gang worship

Mama nigga kicked her out in the rain
Apologizing to me like she to blame
Should see the look on her face
Damn, now we gotta look for a place
Pops locked, he got booked for the yay
Caught him cookin' the cake
Four nicky in the hoodie, I'm straight
You gon' need it, it ain't up for debate
A lot of snakes out here, homicide a common case out here
They exterminating our race out here, know you bang out of fear
For many years, sheddin' tears in this life
Conversating with the Lord for the spirit enlightening
Conversating with the Lawyer, tryna clear the indictment
They offer coffee and he told on the driver
Told on the shooter, he said he got a lil' excited
Broke the code like he ain't know a lot of honor in silence
We used to go on assignments, that ain't righteous
I ain't know you was like this, that ain't righteous
I ain't know you was like this, yeah it be slimy like
It's like the slums got a hold of me
I'm black-hearted, kind of like my heart froze on me
I lost the ones closest to me, now I'm soul-searching
Born cursed but I deserve worse, Hell Gang worship
The slums got a hold of me
I'm black-hearted, kind of like my heart froze on me
I lost the ones closest to me, now I'm soul-searching
