Yeah, whole lotta dope, whole lotta slime nigga
Whole lotta shit, whole lotta lotta
Whole lotta shells from the 45 nigga

Whole lotta money, she might think that I'm broke though
Cause I be in them trenches you don't go
Handkerchief rose gold
Niggas bleed the pebbles for real
Before we bang, we was scheduled to kill
Finna roll up this kill
The wood still blood dipped in the slime
Know your life ain't much different from mines
I'm just a regular nigga
Always smoking this irregular nigga
Yeah, I got a fetish for chicken, I'm tryna get it
Granny used to bathe me with the soap for the dishes
15, tootin blow off the dishes, this shit wicked
Had to kick a door just to feed the addiction
Black people going broke tryna beat a conviction, yeah
Prostitution and pimping, you know she gotta stay
And her Puma flip flops getting it out today
Northern Cal on my shoulders, this shit a lot of weight
The blemishes in my eyes show a lot of pain
One up top, (?) catch a body gang
How could you fault me for my wrongs? This was how I was raised
I traveled this funky road tryna find a way
Is you gone slither for your illa if he die today
I'm loyal to what I love till my dying age
Buck 40 soaking wet, inside the lion cage
Disappointment in granny every time they raid
When niggas be tryna kill you, it be hard to change
Pocket pitch try (?) finna call 'em gang
Another messy murder scene if I call the gang
Channels 8, 408, that's a call away
Youngstown, Ohio, fuck with the fellows all the way
Free the twins, bet you them niggas call today
I'm the only one above em when you talking rank
Southern Cal got the oil when you talking drank
Butterflying all you bitches while I'm counting cake
You might also like
Lil dirty black kid from around the way
Going sack for sack, moving a quarter pound a day
You know I'm straight when I strafe through the city
Had to get it out the mud so the paper is dingy
And your nigga doing time, they can say that I'm stingy
The money came between us now they playing against me
Fuck it, it's real niggas, we don't fold it for nothing
I ain't walk a thin line and keep it cold for nothing
I ain't take a field trip to the throat for nothing
Promise I ain't going broke for nothing, we here now

Slap the dog shit if you bitches play with the count
You ain't activated you better stay in the house hah
Better stay in the house, nigga
You ain't activated you better stay in the house hah

They want a dollar an ounce for that throwback red
Jumpsuit a different color so you know that's fair
Bought jewelry with the 30k that's on my head

Trap booming, youngin' runnin' through grams, yeah
Keep it on him, he in love with the blam, yeah
Cock it back till that bitch unjam, yeah
Mah-mah-mah, that bitch gon' cram, yeah
Now feed the fam with transactions, that should be hand to hand
Get it by any means, niggas understand
Never let another man raise your young wife
That means I love you if I fuck you and I cum twice
They'll never find the yeeky if it's tucked right
Probably get away with murder if it's done right
Cubicles doing numbers off the sunlight
Circle smaller than the dot and I run mine
One time for the one time, fuck 'em all
These pink 50's be crispy, I'm finna fuck 'em all
She got a couple sheets of paper, tell her run 'em off
Real niggas is rare niggas, to come across
Before I take another loss you gon' lose something
Charity in the trenches, nigga shoot something
How you remember when the (?) at the (?) rubbing
Pimping, knocked me for the hooker, I regroup from it
Smooth thugging, (?) in the Chase account
Back doing for the bag, I make it count
We gone line his ass up and we play him out
Political warfare is being straightened out
We done finally made it out, you should follow me
I put us in a position where we can all eat
If I ain't out here in the field then why you call me?
I had that chop stick sounding like it's off beat
Talk cheap, we them niggas that they mad at
Girl they just in it for the fame, y'all can have that
I filled up with trash bags, finna bag that

Can't nobody save me, I'm from hell gang
