You don't wanna live like this, let it sink in
Another premature body drop before the weekend
I used to bag up pieces beyond decent (beyond decent)
They say the customer's, right never mistreat 'em (never mistreat 'em)
And he searchin' for a vein with that needle (G-O-D)
When you carry the monkeys, you gotta feed 'em (gotta feed 'em)
I suffer from similar inner demons
Yeah, I be sippin' for insignificant reasons
When you told me you loved me, I ain't believe it
But when you show me you love me, you'll receive it
Do it for the killas sittin' down for them seasons
It be hard to say no, so they convertin' the leaches
Long as you a earner, you're peaches
Classification, it's top rank, never heard of impeachment
Long as you a earner, you're peaches
Classification, it's top rank, never heard of impeachment

Livin' in the field (field), this is how it is (how it is)
Gotta live wit shit I did (I did), when I die I hope I'm missed
I ain't have no choice, I ain't have no choice
I ain't have no choice, I ain't have no choice

They label us killas and all mine
'Cause I kill anybody that come to moms
The driver like, 'How I get all this time?'
You had a active role in the commission of a crime
Yeah it's brazy, you niggas don't see the signs
Bruh told on blood 'cause he ain't wanna do life
I send my condolences in a kite
You know them people gon hang him and that ain't right
Stare at my daughters to see the light
Went and got him a M, I promise to see it twice
Ya'll remember when Mozzy was on the hype
Mozzy was dead broke, he was drippin' shit on sight
My brother died, they told me it'd be aight
That was back in '05 on dooterz them niggas lied
Got me relapsin' and gettin' high
This shit got me relapsin' and gettin' high
