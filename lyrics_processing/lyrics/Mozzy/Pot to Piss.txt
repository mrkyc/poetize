This is Jay P Bangz

Remember I ain't have a pot to piss
Scrambled eggs with a pot of grits
I done seen the worst, I been through a whole lot of shit
You got the right to be quiet, you ain't gotta snitch
Bad foreign vibe, ass pokin' out her Prada 'fit
Now we hit the mall and we ball, nigga, we coppin' shit
Niggas ain't really your dawg, watch who you rockin' with
People who be claimin' they real but be the opposite
He don't want no smoke for real 'cause we on top of it

Ayy, I heard they put some paper on me
I heard some niggas down the street from mama's waitin' on me, yeah
That kayda on me, ain't no sense in y'all prayin' for me
G-O-D, I ain't playin' with him, for real
Die about it, on my mama, I'ma stand on it
Wrist mainy, bitch, I throw a hundred bands on it
Wade Block, pullin' nighters, we was camped on it
Off the dribble, nigga ballin', finna cram on it
550 European with the yams on it
Mozzy chains everywhere, niggas stamped, homie
Fake flexin', that nigga rockin' his man's Rollie
When it was smokey, niggas ran from me

I'm alive, I can't complain no more
The sun out, baby, I don't see the rain no more
The watch flooded, I can't rock the plain jane no more
Save money, don't be out here tryna save them hoes
I took this bitch up out my chest and put my heart on the shelf
Life a gamble, I'm just thankful for the cards that I dealt
You can't walk inside my shoes and feel the pain that I felt
I'm a real one, never broke a fuckin' promise I kept
I'm good, love, no handouts, I ain't askin' for help
I'm good, call, fuck the world, I can handle myself
I'm ten toes 'bout mine, best believe I'ma step
Can't cheat the grind, I'ma go until it ain't nothin' left

I got niggas on the yard with the GD's
If you don't show up to the yard, that's a DP
I try and cover up the scars with these VV's
She hate them Oak Park niggas just like a BD
I made like five hundred thousand just off an EP
They told him punt out supplies, he did the ET
Ayy, I got niggas in Oakland that's from the Deep East
Big up to NY killers, I fuck with D-East
Salute my LA niggas, that's just on GP
We in Tacoma with forty poppers and DE
They bang a corner and caught a case with the new yeek
I was doin' lully, maneuvering, moving too weak

Remember I ain't have a pot to piss
Scrambled eggs with a pot of grits
I done seen the worst, I been through a whole lot of shit

Nigga, life without the team ain't really livin', dawg
Me, I'm on they shit, every chance I get, I'm killin' y'all
Just ridin' 'round with rodents, nigga
I heard it's documents on the ahki bitch you niggas slidin' with
