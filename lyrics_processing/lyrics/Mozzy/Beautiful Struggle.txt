Struggle with me man
Check out my lifestyle money

It's a beautiful struggle
I had to watch my momma suffer
They just popped my little brother
It's a beautiful struggle
My little sister on duffle
Cause her baby daddy a hustler
It's a beautiful struggle
I promise to come from nothin'
But they made sure I ain't walk for nothin'
It's a beautiful struggle
I said beautiful cause I love it
After this we ain't doin' no more strugglin', move you out of the struggle

And that's a promise I'ma keep
I ain't slept or seen dooterz in a week, threw little cousin the keys
I told her handle her business
Cause she told me how her baby daddy trippin'
I've been at it for a minute
Finally got on ain't even did it
Your nephew the motherfuckin' nigga, had to struggle on my line
Now a nigga thumbin' through figures
You ain't family, what you want from a nigga, huh?

Fuck what another nigga heard
I'm doin' this for my daughter
She don't ever get to see her momma
Cause me and her got our little problems
Shit it is what it is
I thank God I ain't used a condom
Cause this little girl the reason why I'm poppin'
She's the reason why I get it
Poppy gotta upgrade your livin'
So I'm outchea, lifetime committed
Told my momma quit trippin'
We just a signature away from millions
And recognize your baby is the illest
Calm down on the drillin'
I'm tryna buy that buildin' you own
The people love you till the feelin' is gone
Yeah I'm still on the road
Killers back home fillin' the post
Pray to God that a nigga get on
So I can put niggas on
We was kids goin' in on a zone
Now I'm finna buy my momma a home
