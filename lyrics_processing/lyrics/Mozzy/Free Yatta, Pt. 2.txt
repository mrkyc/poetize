Yeah, man
Don dada, you heard, man?
Niggas know how I'm rockin', nigga
Niggas know how I'm comin', nigga
You heard me?
Apply pressure on these suckers, nigga
All day, every day
Shit was fucking up my focus, you feel me?
Haha, yeah
CorkolandKrazy, nigga

I said I bang the same gang, I ain't switching up
Fuck the suckers, I ain't cliquing up
Paramedics could've saved your homie life but they weren't quick enough
Now the stretchers gotta pick him up
I show no mercy for the opposites, I did a lot for this
I ain't squashin' shit, niggas die behind these politics
And free my brother Sleep, we hit a lot of licks
When Cork got popped, me and K took a lot of trips
Pulled my first skit like, "Fuck it, bro, I'm all in"
Check the scoreboard, we slid more than y'all did
Sucker popped at me, I dropped somethin' the same night
Had to trade for Wally, popped two niggas with the same nine
They said I'd be dead or in the penitentiary
I just wanna know if you can be there for me mentally
When they killed my nigga, shit fucked with me spiritually
Literally drop something every time I shed a tear for him
Dope dick, give her dope dick, baby so thick
Rode this and she throat this, I'm like, "Oh, shit"
Hold this, baby, roll this, let's get focused
Let me stroke this
Touch your toes, let me poke this
I need pros, bitch
Bankrolls that can't fold, bitch
Broke bitch, can you be my ho? Hell no, bitch
Real nigga, I ain't told shit, my name golden
Lil' nigga, you ain't blow shit, you ain't smoke shit
Your homie told on the case and y'all bool with it
One of mines, we smoke him, then act like we had nothin' to do with it
Fool with it, ayy, really a fool with it
Die with his gun, young nigga bought it just to boost with it
Gunshots, bloodshed, ain't no truce, nigga
Thought it was a game until they found out that we shoot niggas
Bounce up out your cut, peekaboo, nigga, boo, nigga
New niggas? What? Hell nah, we don't recruit niggas
Drop who, nigga? Hell nah, we don't lose, nigga
You a fool, nigga, we been givin' y'all the blues, nigga
Ayy, I need blues, baby
Lot to lose, baby, fuck your dude, come in twos, baby, hey

Yeah, you ain't rockin' VVS's, them is S and I's
Sweet talk a broke bitch out her SSI every time
Fork over the fetti, I need every dime
Every time we slidin', niggas dyin', I ain't never lied
Fingerprints, wipe that thang down, make sure it's sanitized
100K, I used to sit in the trap and just fantasize
Real though, forty with a boulder, that's a dildo
Bobby on the federal papers, that nigga still a go
Broke nigga, fuck you stealing for? I would've put you on
Boogers on the Rollie and we clarifying any stone
Bury blood, you helped carry blood, then you carried on
You ain't double back and set trip, you niggas dead wrong
Headstone, piss all on that bitch ass nigga headstone
We don't do no woofing, suckers hidin', know we cooked 'em
La fa-illa ties, I'll die behind my hoodlums
Bitch, we don't fuck with pork, you know my mama 'nem is Muslim
Got her lookin'
Pay me what you weigh and we can run it
I just pulled it off the lot, I'm through the hood doin' a hundred
Bitches buggin'
She just wanna fuck me on the leather
I was bool but she cool so if she suck it, I'ma let her
Fuck a letter, I just wanted Biggie back, blood
We was in the bounty politicking, bickin' back, blood
Still thuggin', million dollar nigga in the trenches
I'ma take the ride 'cause payin' for it is expensive
Niggas trippin', trippin' trippin', nigga, on my mama
Swap the nickel out and switch the plates on the Honda
Usalama, ain't nothin' I wouldn't do for all my partners
