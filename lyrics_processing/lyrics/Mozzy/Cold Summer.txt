June, another cold summer, shooter gang doin' numbers

Cold gunner, another cold summer
Carry the thing lookin' like it hold a whole hundred
A whole hundred, whole hundred
Carry the thing lookin' like it hold a whole hundred
Cold gunner, another cold summer
Carry the thing lookin' like it hold a whole hundred
A whole hundred, whole hundred
Carry the thing lookin' like it hold a whole hundred

Another cold summer, Shooter Gang doing numbers
Smoking cherry pot, chewin' raspberry mambas
Gold foil candles, gonna fuck the homie bitch bruh
Real nigga, that's the only thing I told the bitch
Used to swerve stolen whips
Now we in the only whips
Pink slip, ownership
Lately I've been on my shit
How we 'posed to call you big bruh and you ain't showed the shit
Hit for 20 P's and you ain't throw the little homie shit
Self incrimination for you statement, shouldn't of told 'em shit
Sleepin' in that pissy ass home, tank cold as shit
Food hella cold and shit
Ain't no hangin' on the fence
Niggas really die behind this politics you up against
Food hella cold and shit
Ain't no bangin' on the fence
Niggas really die behind this gangsta shit you up against
Polluted oxygen, lookin' for the opposite
Slidin' to the esophagus, knockin' at your occupants

Cold gunner, another cold summer
Carry the thing lookin' like it hold a whole hundred
A whole hundred, whole hundred
Carry the thing lookin' like it hold a whole hundred
Cold gunner, another cold summer
Carry the thing lookin' like it hold a whole hundred
A whole hundred, whole hundred
Carry the thing lookin' like it hold a whole hundred

You can't love me, can't yank nothin' from me
Revenue recovered, tryna take some from me
Hit the nigga Skeme like "where you at?"
Them niggas in Oklahoma got pure Act'
On top of that
I got a couple of them drillin' with me
Pray for Killer City, that's the iller city
I fuck with boo bang when I'm in the city
GPS on my ankle in a different city
MCM bookbag, it's all 50 in me
Tear this bitch up if they don't let and my niggas in it
Nigga fuck your baby momma, I ain't want the bitch
Thought I locked her in but double pump faked on the bitch
Hell Gang ain't the gang you should go against
Double check the door, he just making sure it's appropriate
Lately I've been going heavy on these opiates
Nowadays God watchin' niggas you be smokin' with
Cold gunner, another cold summer
Carry the thing lookin' like it hold a whole hundred
A whole hundred, whole hundred
Carry the thing lookin' like it hold a whole hundred
Cold gunner, another cold summer
Carry the thing lookin' like it hold a whole hundred
A whole hundred, whole hundred
