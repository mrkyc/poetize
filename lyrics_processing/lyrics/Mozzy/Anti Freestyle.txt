Child of the trenches, I'm a gang member
VVS, frostbites on the chain, nigga
Walk up on him, introduce the K, nigga
Like where blood and 'em from? What he say, nigga?
I sold onions at the market with my Tre niggas
And respect the dope fiends, I used to stay with 'em
You know the usalama on him, gotta stay with him
Knock your stupid ass down, try to play with him
My niggas in the streets, really out the trenches
We up and poppin' niggas, fuck the opposition
We up and poppin' niggas, fuck the opposition
Leave your facials half full, very optimistic
I'm not listening, every single rock glisten
Ask your bitch about the Mozzy, we them top niggas
We poppin' up at all these shows just to pop niggas
I don't adopt niggas, you are not squad, nigga

And that's why I gotta keep a ratchet
Bad bitch, work two jobs and get taxes
Bought a new GLOCK, hold thirty like a plasma
All she want is two things, backshots and a backrub
And oh, I, oh, I, I'm that nigga that'll do that
And oh, I can't lie, love the way that you move that
You know, know I get that check and run through that
Got one clip, two clips, niggas know I keep two straps
You might also like
MCM backpack, lil nigga, back, back
Fuck where that ass at, bitch, where that cash at?
Loud when we smoking, lil dope, we don't mash that
Any sucker nigga sliding through getting clapped out
House lick, we running through that bitch like it's FasTrak
Remember all them days I was broke, but I'm past that
Get the job done when I'm busting, I don't backtrack
Hit his block with them chops out like it's Baghdad
Shooter like Mad Max, leave a nigga stretched out
All headshots, dumb nigga, put that vest down
Beat the pussy up like a young nigga fresh out
Thugging with them TEC's out, I'll bring the jets out
Niggas ups on the kid, I'll bust a nigga head
These .762s knockin' off a nigga dreads
Money on my mind, all I think about is bread
And tell your bitch get off my dick, she keeps tryna give me head
A bunch of young niggas sick with it like 40
350 Yeezy Boost, nigga, these ain't Roshes
On my bag flow, I'm tryna bust down a Rollie
My son mom everything, I treat her like a trophy
Pour two fours in that yellow, no Kobe
Got OG's that'll still shoot like Ginobili
A band for my coat like I live where the snow be
And, bitch, I'm from the Crest where shit get funky, nigga
And that's why I gotta keep a ratchet
Bad bitch, work two jobs and get taxes
Bought a new GLOCK, hold thirty like a plasma
All she want is two things, backshots and a backrub
And oh, I, oh, I, I'm that nigga that'll do that
And oh, I can't lie, love the way that you move that
You know, know I get that check and run through that
Got one clip, two clips, niggas know I keep two straps

And that's why I'm so anti, anti
Can't trust these bitches, no can I, can I, oh
And I, and I
Always keep some shooters on standby, standby, no
You fuckin' with a savage
Still remember days I ain't have shit
Everything designer, I don't match shit
A band and ten cents for these shoes if you tax it
You ain't fuckin' with a boss nigga
Don't touch, don't ask how much these cost, nigga
Just know I, know I
Got tints so dark can't see no eyes, both eyes
And that's why, I'm so anti, anti
Can't trust these bitches, no can I, can I, oh
And I, and I
