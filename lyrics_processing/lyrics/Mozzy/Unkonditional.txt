Congratulations on your marriage
I was in jail due to living careless
You're beautiful evidently that's apparent
Taking care of my daughter
It's crazy cause you ain't even a parent
She fell apart and you was there to repair it
My motherfuckin' partner
We got different poppas same mother
It's unconditional with your baby brother
Can't nothing separate us
When we was younger we was separated
Vividly remember the devastation
And backed up by your statements
I was in county and couldn't take it
You kept it lit bitches was pump faking
I promise when I make it
I'm clearing your mortgage and all your payments
A small token of my appreciation
Sincerely appreciated
She was about as solid as it gets
Family first over all that other shit

CPS got involved with my daughter life
They took away her momma and her father's rights
Sis went and got her out immediately
While I was down that's exactly what she need to be
Smoking on this chopstick, I'm just reminiscing
She go the distance for her brother, that's my realist nigga
Behind her and her alone I'll kill a nigga
And ever since she had J that be my lil nigga
Word to my momma that we both share
The love is unconditional she should know it's there
Used to sell dope in the younger years
Got a good job but on god she nothing square
Breathing on her always helped reduce the pain
If she got it then I got it and I move the same
Every once a while groan 'bout my foolish ways
Cause her baby brother involved with the shooter gang
Cause her baby brother involved with the shooter gang
Every once a while groan 'bout my foolish ways

You know I knocked your song out that motherfucker go crazy
