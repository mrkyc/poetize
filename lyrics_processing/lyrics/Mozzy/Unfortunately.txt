I apologize for my ignorance
It is what it is
I'm all in and I ain't tripping though
I know my little girly face love me to death
These the sacrifices a nigga gotta make though on behalf of this gangland

Motor mouthin', snitchin' should be against the law
40 with dick and balls, but he ain't get it off
Oppositions zero'd in, and started gettin' off
The loss was significant when they picked 'em off
I gave dooters the , time to risk it all
I'm buyin' all the hand cannons, broom sticks and all
You gone feel where I'm comin' from when you get the call
My partner would probably talk before he 
That's why the game is like it is, it ain't like it was
I was tryna find myself when they signed me up
Skeletons in my closet, I be hidin' from
Blood was supposed to be my brother but I lined 'em up
Help me count all this guala that I done finally touched
We come from nothin', so it feel like it's more than enough
Bank statements goin' brazy, it's more in the cuts
Since I'm up, I gotta show the unfortunate love
If he ain't talkin' care of home, it's unfortunate, love
You raise the children on your own, it's unfortunate, love
If he ain't talkin' care of home, it's unfortunate, love

Unfortunately
I was just tryna get my feet wet then that water rose knee deep
I done fell in love with the streets, but the streets really don't love me
But it's gone be alright though, it's gone be alright though
I'm visualizin' a better life with my eyes closed
Wakin' up and I'm still up in the struggle

The struggle really real, I'm realistically in it
Lost people that I love, realistically trippin'
Auntie lookin' for a vein, told me to mind my business
I look the other way because it's too horrific to vision
They tamper with your freedom once niggas is in the system
Contaminated liquid, this shit been eatin' my system
They know it's 1 Up Top, his partner real apprehensive
Snitchin' is prohibited, nor is it reccomended
The lawyer that represent me charge an arm and a leg
He understand the circumstances, so he partially paid
They put my hood in bold letters, every article made
Thank me later, I'm apart of the blame, yeah, I'm apart of the blame
Who really sane with all this pain we endurin'
Why socialize if you ain't paying me for it
Gotta pay on this foreign, on top of that, a nigga late on his rent
That's why you supposed to stack more than you spend
Unfortunately
I was just tryna get my feet wet then that water rose knee deep
I done fell in love with the streets, but the streets really don't love me
But it's gone be alright though, it's gone be alright though
I'm visualizin' a better life with my eyes closed
