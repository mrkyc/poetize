Suicidal thoughts my nigga
(June onna beat, June onna beat)
Lifestyle maney...

Mozzy ain't a gang til' I'm dead and gone
Bruh was a real nigga- he ain't neva told!
Bruh was a real drilla with them
Mini poles
That's what the streets saying bout me far as I suppose

When it was time to slide, niggas catted on me
Shit I wouldn't be surprised, niggas ratted on me
If you loafin' that's the same thing as lackin homie
Broccoli in the Stogie, pockets full of macaroni
'nuff said til I'm dead got it tatted on me
Baby gave me 30K and started faggin' on me
Sucka thought he caught me leakin', but I had it on me
They might indict me, I tell ya why I was blappin' on em
Sneak dissing get you smoked like a pack of 'Ports
Body after body, gang war back and forth
They be picking up dubs when them faggots scored
I could never forgive you for it, betta ask the lord!
Hard to find, they don't come outside at the 4th
Why you lying act like y'all be posted at the store?
Bring it to ya momma door if niggas keep playin
"Them Mozzy niggas with the shits" that's what the streets saying

Street dreams, buy a kick board a flight
Nowadays, nigga dream about a normal life
My lifestyle a gamble when I throw the dice
Looking over my shoulder with this .40 pipe
Momma tried to tell me that there's more to life
Snitchin ass niggas known for giving up important rights
According to the kite, bruh tired of living
What you 'posed to tell a nigga doing life in prision?!
Kicked moms out the courtroom for crying in it
When you committed to the team, ain't no lying in it!
Ain't a day that go by I ain't riding with it
I'm from the slums, having visions of me dying in it
Drug heal everything that time didn't
Ion't listen to yo music, you be lying in it
Fuck Rap, ion't care if they don't sign a nigga
Cus I'm content with having Hell Gang behind a nigga...

Mozzy ain't a gang til' I'm dead and gone
Bruh was a real nigga- he ain't neva told!
Bruh was a real drilla with them
