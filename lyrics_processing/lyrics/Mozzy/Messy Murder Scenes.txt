Lil nigga heavy metal messy murder scene
He ain't a factor beef with him don't concern the team
Currently chasing currency with urgency
Mozzy stamp tatted in the flesh this shit permanently
Run tell them them diss records ain't disturbing me
I just did back to back shows and hit for 33
The blood money burgundy killa count the murder fee
Probably gotta pay you in 20's if that's preferably
A sucka died I love the nigga that murdered him
Another sucka died I love the nigga that murdered him
Tip toed through the crowd started squirting him
Should've seen how fast they got that boy to the emergency
Noodle your own noggin you ain't heard of me
Brother say there more big hits after the surgery
Even when a crash dummy die we take it personally
Imma keep purchasing bodies until they murder me
Homicide, picking up the shells from the murder scene
Word to the shooter gang you'll never get a word from me
Learned to buss down the bag spitters before I learned to read
Went to class smelling like gas and I ain't learned a thing
It was me Germa Skeme, June, Ru and Kill Bill
Killa plan point scoring points that's a real drill
Really in the field for real
Talking about for real for real
Free the gang bang them niggas looking for a better deal
Never fold never will never told never will
I swear the homies will get ya just like your family will
Fuck the crackers, what the fuck is 100 years?
Brodie just wrote me they tryna break him but never will
It's hard to chill, I've been chasing this chili yo
Killas on that transfer slither up with the give and go
Dope smoke cookie crumbles tickle your nose
Ye ain't hold it down while I was down you niggas is hoes
It be like fake the new real I suppose
Talking like he Gotti and he ain't bodied a soul
Nigga talking like he balling on god and he really broke
This that middle of the Arden Mall gold niggas know
Gang behind the gates got niggas switching them flows
Squeezing ham and cheese got niggas switching they low
30 pack and the pole know I'm back on the road
Dripping in the latest fashion on these faggot ass hoes
Frustrated in granny house like I gotta get on
Still yelling this zilla zoe shit gotta live on
Top of the morn the hooker made the drop on her own
Adding up the guap smoking on this chop that I rolled
Frustrated in granny house like gotta get on
Still yelling this zilla zoe shit you gotta live on
Top of the morn the hooker made the drop on her own
Adding up this guap chiefing on this chop that I rolled
There's pots on the stove long line of knocks at the door
They purchase 20 or better when they knock at the door
My momma and them know they had the same problem before
Deposit is 4 for every show I'm popping lil woe
Stay out them trenches is vicious they'll lock on your throat
Lock all them doors it's slimy had to stock up on poles
Minding my own and saw all kinda commas and o's
Diamonds and gold I promise these the finest of clothes
Them niggas will suck your dick if that's the price to get on
Mozzy king of the city title rightfully owned
Beathy the only real shooter came from the zone
He was gutta gas stars they don't tell me I'm wrong
And inhaling this dope vow not to tell on a soul
Blood stupid they can tell us his load
Another easy score to each his own
They gotta keep it it ain't a secret
The last nigga died leaking that's on Jesus
Dress his body up in something decent
We really putting life before the cement
Tighten up your defence
Real motivation on some street shit
Reevaluate who you eat with
We don't do the sneak diss
Killers sweep through and have the streets lit
Guala gang you know the whole team lit
Slouching in the beam lit
Google the shooters I usually be with
Records indicate niggas cheese shit
Easy shit
