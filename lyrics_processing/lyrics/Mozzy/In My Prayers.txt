Damn fourf I just hate it was you, we from a place they don't play by the rules
You gotta stay by a tool, much rather spend my day in the shoe
Verse the whole gangland and the Su, we missin' you fool
Hollared at God, niggas ain't gettin' goo
I ain't answerin' neither, ya nigga ain't in the mood
Wishin' I finish school, future prolly be brighter
Mama prolly be proud, this rappin' shit don't excite her
Talkin'  on the Y, he comin' home in a while
That's your iller like you say then hold him down while he down
Conversate with the clouds, I just pray that you hear me
I just pray I get to see you suckas ever come get me
You know I fake weight tipsy, pour out the Remy for ya'll
Care less about a tour unless it's killers involved
Hit for a million, I'm finna spread it thin wit my dawgs
Remember them garbage bags, spreadin' big wit my dawgs
Be a dork, you don't walk around with stick in the mall
Politician get you hit off a call, the problem solved
We do the Gucci, Gabbana down to the draws
Google the goon, bodies they poppin' up on the blogs
Murder be justifiable, when it's probable cause
But that don't make up for the losses, not at all
I'm still waitin' on Deezy and them to call
This shit been killin' me softly on top of these new draws, yeah
Lot of shit on my mind, I can't take it
Cry a little bit but I'm a gangster
Ten toes down on the pavement, I been faithful doin' hits and hittin' licks, thankful I finally made it
Judge finna bang it, he told me that they don't care
They don't believe in God, but I got him in my prayers
Judge finna bang it, he told me that he don't care
He don't believe in God, but I got him in my prayers
Amen
But I got him in my prayers
