All I know is paper chase
Got no time to waste
All that's on my mind is cake
Gotta make a way
All we do is chase dat money, chase dat money
I said all we do is chase dat money, chase dat money

It's a whole lotta paper chasin going on
I ain't gotta tell you bout it bitch you know I'm on
I be conducting business on they homie phone
Transaction go through put the homie on
You know to chain snatch bitch's when the rollie don't
Bitch you think we love you, hoe you know we don't
Real nigga name always spoken on
You will never see the bags that I'm focused on
Whole lotta money whole lotta lotta
She said how much that is, hold on momma
That's on my momma kids, we ain't going broke momma
That's on my momma kids we ain't going broke momma

All I know is paper chase
Got no time to waste
All that's on my mind is cake
Gotta make a way
All we do is chase dat money, chase dat money
I said all we do is chase dat money, chase dat money

Chase dat mula
Stack that cheese that gouda
Name ring bells like Rooma
Disturbing the piece like Luda
Cause I'm chasing it
Money, money, money, I'm making it
Green or the blue big-facing it
Got my haters extra pissed
But what you gonna do without it
I cannot go without it
Fuck being broke I doubt it
No I can't allow it
No, No

All I know is paper chase
Got no time to waste
All that's on my mind is cake
Gotta make a way
All we do is chase dat money, chase dat money
I said all we do is chase dat money, chase dat money

I'ma run a marathon on you bag a bones
I own a couple stallions, out in Vacaville I'm on
Trynna teach my baby boy to be a man before I'm gone
All for that paper chase I ran a nigga off the road
Never sell my soul, my nigga God put me on
My angels in the outfield keep me safe when I'm home
In a day I built Rome, gotta K and split dome
More bang for the bread, money gang y'all know
Me and my cousin pook go piece up on Big Macs
I still walk in Mickey D's smellin' like loud pack
I am found where the crowd at
Benjamin's Ima pile that
Ima humble ass nigga still giving the fans that
All I know is paper chase
Got no time to waste
All that's on my mind is cake
Gotta make a way
All we do is chase dat money, chase dat money
