I blacked out, passed out, first time we met
It wasn't drugs, could be love, but it's probably sex
I'm thinkin' 'bout you
(Na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na-na)
Cool stare, greased hair curled around your eye
I wanna take a dirty picture, send it to your mind
I'm not just thinkin' 'bout you
(Na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na-na)

I'll treat you better than the girls you're hangin' out with
Take you to Heaven and I'll show you all around it
I'll never ever let you down
Ooh

Harry
I'm gonna make you love me
You're gonna make me breakfast
It's a secret just between us
We can keep it low-key
I ain't bein' funny
You should be so lucky
To put your, put your velvet arms around me
Ooh, ooh
I'm g-g-g-g-gonna make you love me
Ooh, ooh
So put your, put your, put your arms around me
You might also like
Yeah, I'm starin' at you in the magazines every day
Feel like I'm seventeen, never been touched this way
I'm thinkin' 'bout you
(Na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na-na)

I'll treat you better than the boys you're hangin' out with
Take you to Heaven and I'll show you all around it
I'll never ever let you down
Ooh

Harry
I'm gonna make you love me
You're gonna make me breakfast
It's a secret just between us
We can keep it low-key
I ain't bein' funny
You should be so lucky
To put your, put your velvet arms around me
Ooh, ooh
I'm g-g-g-g-gonna make you love me
Ooh, ooh

Oh, Harry, Harry
Mmm, Harry
Oh, baby, I'm gonna make you love me
Yeah
So put your, put your, put your arms around me
I'm gonna make you love me
You're gonna make me breakfast
It's a secret just between us
We can keep it low-key
I ain't bein' funny
You should feel so lucky
I'm gonna, I'm gonna
Gonna, gonna make you love me
