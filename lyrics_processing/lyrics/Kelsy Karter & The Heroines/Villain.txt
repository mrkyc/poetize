I'm playin' the villain, baby, just like you want

Do you remember where we started, love?
The ride was up ahead of us, was steady
But now it's heavy
We looked forward to the twists and turns
But now those twists and turns, they burn so deadly
And, oh, you let me

You let me take the fall for us
And, by the way, go fuck yourself

Do I have your attention now?
Baby, now that I'm not around
I'm the bad guy in your story
But we knew that, don't be boring, oh
Do you need my forgiveness now?
So you can write about someone else
You'll be the hero in the ending
And carry on pretending, oh
And, baby, just for you
I'll be the villain if you want me to
You might also like
You said I went and broke an oath
But don't you think that's just a bit dramatic?
Don't be tragic
You always liked me better sad
I bet it kills you now that I am happy
Are you happy?

And don't forget, go fuck yourself

Do I have your attention now?
Baby, now that I'm not around
I'm the bad guy in your story
But we knew that, don't be boring, oh
Do you need my forgiveness now?
So you can write about someone else
You'll be the hero in the ending
And carry on pretending, oh
And, baby, just for you
I'll be the villain if you want me to

Villain, yeah
Villain if you want me to
Villain if you want me to
Yeah
I'll go and take the fall for us
I hope someday you find yourself

Do I have your attention now?
Baby, now that I'm not around
I'm the bad guy in your story
But we knew that, don't be boring, oh
Do you need my forgiveness now?
So you can write about someone else
You'll be the hero in the ending
And carry on pretending, oh
But still, I speak the truth
