I was a sucker, love was a thief
It sure made a fool out of me
I took the lesson, love took her leave
I know how cruel she can be

Oh, sometimes we risk it all to feel the fire
And it all goes up in flames
You and I never get the final say, ay!, ay!

You can cripple a heart till it feels like it breaks
But, baby, love goes on
You can tear it apart, try to throw it away, oh yeah
But if it hurts like hell don't lose yourself
Don't be afraid either way, ooh
You can cripple a heart but it won't ever break
Oh, baby, love goes on

I wasn't looking, I needed time
It had something different in mind
Thought I could stop it, put up the fight
Didn't matter how hard that I tried
You might also like
Now I know I'd risk it all to feel the fire
And it all goes up in flames
You and I never get the final say, ay!, ay!

You can cripple a heart till it feels like it breaks
But, baby, love goes on
You can tear it apart, try to throw it away, oh yeah
But if it hurts like hell don't lose yourself
Don't be afraid either way, ooh
You can cripple a heart but it won't ever break
Oh baby, love goes on and on, and on, and on, and on
Oh baby, love goes on and on, and on, and on, and on


You can cripple a heart till it feels like it breaks
But, baby, love goes on
You can tear it apart, try to throw it away, oh yeah
But if it hurts like hell don't lose yourself
Don't be afraid either way, ooh
You can cripple a heart but it won't ever break (It won't ever break)
Oh, baby, love goes on
(Come on, baby!) Love goes on
