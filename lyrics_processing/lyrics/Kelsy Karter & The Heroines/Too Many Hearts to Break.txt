Dandelions in the breeze
As far as I can see, planted just for me
They remind me of the hearts I squeeze
I kiss them on the nose and with the wind, they go
And they go

Baby, oh, you know I love you so
You don't even know me though
Baby, I could even love you so
Maybe even take you home

But there's too many hearts I have to break, I have to break
So baby, won't you come my way?
Just come my way
I know you're dying just to be my baby
But there's too many hearts to, too many hearts

So I pin them on the wall sometimes
All neatly in a row, now who's the next to go?
Oh, I fell for one a couple times
He left me all alone, now I'm a rolling stone
And they go
You might also like
Baby, oh, you know I love you so
You don't even know me though
Baby, I could even love you so
Maybe even take you home

But there's too many hearts I have to break, I have to break
So baby, won't you come my way?
Just come my way
I know you're dying just to be my baby
But there's too many hearts to, too many hearts to break

Oh, it's easy to see how all these boys keep on falling for me
But no, get your hand off my jeans
Ain't nobody holding me
'Cause there's too many hearts I have to break
Ooh, baby

There's too many hearts I have to break, I have to break
So baby, won't you come my way?
Just come my way
I know you're dying just to be my baby
But there's too many hearts to, too many hearts to break
Dandelions in the breeze
As far as I can see, planted just for me
I kiss them on the nose and with the wind, they go
