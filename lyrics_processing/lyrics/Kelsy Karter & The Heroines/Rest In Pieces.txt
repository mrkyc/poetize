Here we go again, just another day
Living with the ghost of you
T.V. in my brain keeping me awake
I'm a prisoner inside this room

So much chaos on my mind
Wasting all my time
Forget you, yeah, I tried
Nothing ever works because
Think I might be cursed

You'll be the death of me
So if it's my destiny
Then lay me down to sleep and
I guess I'll rest in pieces
Tear me down again, I
I can't go on pretending
Throw me in the deep end
I guess I'll rest in pieces

Here we go again, welcome to the pain
The end of me began with you
Playing all these games, but I can't complain
We both know it's nothing new
You might also like
So much chaos in my mind
Wasting all my time
Forget you, I flatline
Nothing ever works
Think I might be cursed

You'll be the death of me
So if it's my destiny
Then lay me down to sleep and
I guess I'll rest in pieces
Tear me down again, I
I can't go on pretending
Throw me in the deep end
I guess I'll rest in pieces

Rest in pieces
I think I might be cursed
Rest in pieces
I think I might be cursed

You'll be the death of me
So if it's my destiny
Then lay me down to sleep and
I guess I'll rest in pieces
Tear me down again, I
I can't go on pretending
Throw me in the deep end
I guess I'll rest in, Guess I'll rest in
Rest in pieces
I think I might be cursed
Rest in pieces
I think I might be cursed
Rest in pieces (So much chaos on my mind)
I think I might be cursed (Wasting all my time)
Rest in pieces (Forget you, yeah, I tried)
Nothing ever works
