I ran away with only ten bucks in my pocket
And a twenty-thousand ransom for my head, hey
My baby said I didn't take it like he wanted
So I kissed him on the neck and shot him dead
He's such an artist, how he'd paint a broken promise
Now he's laying on the floor covered in red, hey
And if I'm honest, killed a man to keep him modest
Yeah, he broke me, so I had to get revenge

When they come for me, oh, I'll be gone for miles, baby
And I'll think of you and sway to your favourite song
When they find me, I'll be riding high in style, baby
And I'll look down and I'll say

(Hey)
Catch me if you can
Ooh, ah, mmm
Catch me if you can

Oh, he had a face so pretty
Type of smile that makes you dizzy
Uh, it almost took me down, hey
And when it hit me, yeah, he started acting fishy
Bet he wishes he was nicer to me now, uh
Such a composer, how he wrote the story for us
Bet you didn't see this coming, did you now?
And I'd be lying if I said I wasn't crying
But he broke me, so I had to take him out

When they come for me, oh, I'll be gone for miles, baby
And I'll think of you and sway to your favourite song
When they find me, I'll be riding high in style, baby
And I'll look down and I'll say

(Hey)
Catch me if you can
Ooh, ah, mmm
Catch me if you can
Ooh, ah, mmm
Catch me if you can

It's over now
But I'll see you in another life
Can't catch me now
It's over now
But I'll wait for you up in the sky
It's over now

When they come to me, oh, I'll be gone for miles, baby
And I'll think of you and sway
Hey
When they find me, I'll be riding high in style, baby
And I'll look down and I'll say
(And I'll tell you, baby)
Catch me if you can
Ooh, ah, mmm
Catch me if you can
Ooh, ah, mmm
