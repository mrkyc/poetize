Two, three, four

You and me
Trouble dipped in honey tea
I can't take the taste of it, you see
You're far too Mr. Way Too Good for Me, uh
Oh, you and me
Maybe we're not meant to be
Easy, tiger, let's just let it breathe
And we'll let the whiskey do its thing

So listen, here's a simple way to say
Not tryna fuck with your brain
So you know, ooh

Take it easy, baby
Take it easy, baby
'Cause I'm hot and cold-blooded, but ain't ready for lovin'
No, I ain't ready for love, so easy, baby

You and me
I'm the knife and you're the tree
If I carve my name, I'd cut too deep
Just to see the sap run down your cheeks
You might also like
So listen, here's a simple way to say
Not tryna fuck with your brain
So you know, ooh

Take it easy, baby
Take it easy, baby
'Cause I'm hot and cold-blooded, but ain't ready for lovin'
No, I ain't ready for love, so easy, baby
It's not no, it's maybe
Uh, so take it easy, baby
'Cause I'm hot and cold-blooded, but ain't ready for lovin'
No, I ain't ready for lovin', so easy, baby

See, I don't understand, baby (What don't you understand?)
No, no, every time I see you, I just wanna touch your face
Why don't you let me love you, maybe?
Whatever did I do to make you run away?
And I will put in the time (Put in the time)
I will earn my stripes (Go ahead and earn 'em, baby)
I know it ain't gonna be, gonna be easy, baby

Ooh, take it easy, baby (I don't wanna take it easy, no)
Take it easy, baby (Mmm)
'Cause I'm hot and cold-blooded, but ain't ready for lovin'
('Cause you're hot and cold-blooded, but ain't ready for lovin')
No, I ain't ready for love, so easy, baby, oh
(No, you ain't ready for lovin', so easy, baby, oh)
It's not no, it's maybe (Oh no, no, no)
So take it easy, baby
'Cause I'm hot and cold-blooded, but ain't ready for lovin'
('Cause you're hot and cold-blooded, but ain't ready for lovin')
No, I ain't ready for lovin', so easy, baby
(No, you ain't ready for lovin', so easy, baby)
Baby, I wanna love you (No, no, no, no)
But I don't know how
'Cause you're hot and cold-blooded, but ain't ready for lovin'
No, you ain't ready for love, so easy, baby, yeah
Ooh, you know I wanna try and love you, baby
But I just can't, I just can't do it
