You know she's never gonna tell you...
If she likes it this way
You know she's never gonna ask you
If you feel the same
A fever, oh, an addiction, ooh...
Was it worth it? Did you give you life away?
A fever a desperate religion...
And all that she can say... is

...Give me just a little bit... ooh...
Gimme just a little bit...
...Give me just a little bit... ooh...
Gimme just a little bit...

A train that never stops rolling
It's getting into your blood
A need that never stops growing
She's a poisonous one
A hope for better days, but nothing, ooh...
Seems to fix it... ooh... now
You're wasting away
Indeed, a desperate religion
And all that she will say... is
You might also like

...Give me just a little bit... ooh...
Gimme just a little bit...

A desperate addiction
A familiar affliction
Denying won't fix it
This desperate religion
