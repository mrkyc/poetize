Take care 'cause I'm coming in
I see my shadow and I don't know when
I'm alive with you
And it feels so true
We don't need shelter, only sky
Bring back the storms that made us high
I'm alive with you

Baby, I'm a renegade like you
Baby, I'm searching, too
Been around the world
Now I'm running back to you
Baby, I'm a renegade like you
Baby, I'm hurting, too
Been around the world
Now I'm running back to you
Baby, I'm a renegade like you
Baby, I'm hurting, too
Been around the world
Now I'm running back to you

Sweetheart, this world, it makes no sense
No pot of gold, no innocence
I'm alive with you
We don't need shelter, only sky
Bring back the storms that made us high
We're alive

Baby, I'm a renegade like you

Now I'm running back to you

Run with me, we'll take it on together
Run with me, 'cause you're the one I need
Run with me, 'cause we won't live forever
Run with me...
