Body to body the city surrounding this high rise
It's midnight
There ain't not stopping, nobody to stop this
And my mind's, on fire right now

This might hurt but I don't care
Runnin' my hands through your hair
I'm powerless
We don't work but I forget
We decided to sleep on it
In the same bed

Body to body as soon as you got me alone with
Alone with you
Body to body with no one to stop me alone with
Alone with you
With you, with you, I can't help myself, with you
Body to body as soon as you got me alone with
Alone with you

My friends went home and I knew I should go
But I didn't, I miss it
We're all alone and the tension in your hands
Is different, I need it now
You might also like
If this might hurt but I don't care
Runnin' my hands through your hair
I'm powerless
If we don't work but I forget
We decided to sleep on it
In the same bed

Body to body as soon as you got me alone with
Alone with you
Body to body with no one to stop me alone with
Alone with you
With you, with you, I can't help myself, with you
Body to body as soon as you got me alone with
Alone with you

This might hurt but I don't care
Runnin' my hands through your hair
I'm powerless
We don't work but I forget
We decided to sleep on it
In the same bed

With you, with you
I can't help myself
With you, with you (body to body)
With you
I can't help myself
Alone with you
Body to body as soon as you got me alone with
Alone with you
Body to body with no one to stop me alone with
Alone with you
With you, with you, I can't help myself, with you
Body to body as soon as you got me alone with
