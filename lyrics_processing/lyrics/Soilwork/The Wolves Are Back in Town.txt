Was it just a subliminal death threat
When you said that the ending was near?
Was it part of your criminal mindset
To appease the celestial sphere?
Was it death as an everyday phenomenon
That all is passing like the clouds?
Would you meet me
At the Gates of Parthenon
To relinquish every doubt?

And if you were on my side
Would you leave me to decide?
Will it change this time around
When the wolves are back in town?
Though the times I spent with you
Took me further from the truth
I still hoped you'd be around
When the wolves are back in town

And so you say
There's an end to the carnage
But no end to the fear
Now your sympathies are clear
There's a cloud of death around you
And a halo of despair
And the plague you brought is dying
To infect the midnight air
There's a cloud of death around you
And a halo of despair
Though it took so long to find you
You could have me anywhere
You might also like
And if you were on my side
Would you leave me to decide?
Will it change this time around
When the wolves are back in town?
Though the times I spent with you
Took me further from the truth
I still hoped you'd be around
When the wolves are back in

There's a cloud of death around you
And a halo of despair
And the plague you brought is dying
To infect the midnight air
There's a cloud of death around you
And a halo of despair
Though it took so long to find you
You could have me anywhere

And if you were on my side
Would you leave me to decide?
Will it change this time around
When the wolves are back in town?
Though the times I spent with you
Took me further from the truth
I still hoped you'd be around
