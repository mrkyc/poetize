All that comfort lost in seconds
Into burning fields of the unknown
I saw the fear, I felt a rumble
Our eyes exploding, Our memories lost forevermore

We're going down
I thought we never could be wiped out
Lost and dragged in shame
To be one with what's been made up
It all ends here, but where do we go?
Do we ever get to find out
Where our hearts will lie?
Transcending filled with pain
Our soul's without a name

Into the night as our hands are entwined
(Never let me go)
We owned our time but here we drown
(In tears we've collected)
Slowly we rose for a glance at the sky
(Never let go)
Father and son, watching the world go down
You might also like
Our reality lost in motion
Never coming back
Your lips are moving but there's no sound
Watching the last light die
Sensing our last sigh
Together as we have lost
Lost our last fight

I thought we never could be wiped out
Lost and dragged in shame
To be one with what's been made up
It all ends here, but where do we go?
Do we ever get to find out
Where our hearts will lie?
We knew it all the way
The growing shadow that brought this day
Brought this day

Let it come
There's no fear
All at once
We're already numb
Into the night as our hands are entwined
(Never let me go)
We owned our time but here we drown
(In tears we've collected)
Slowly we rose for a glance at the sky
(Never let go)
Father and son, watching the world go down
Go down
Go down

Riding a wave of nothingness
Our ambitions slowly ripped apart
But we still stand


Into the night as our hands are entwined
(Never let me go)
We owned our time but here we drown
(In tears we've collected)
Slowly we rose for a glance at the sky
(Never let go)
Father and son, watching the world go down
