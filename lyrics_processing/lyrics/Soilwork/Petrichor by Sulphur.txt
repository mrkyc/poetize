I saw the end, the fall, the weight of it all
Trapped inside life's invisible walls
I wait for her to make me believe
If she can't, then there's nothing I need
I tried so hard to make my amends
To behave as if nothing would end
The things we love, the things we destroy
As we claw our way out of the void

I need that umbilical silence
To cut through this veil of doubt
It enters me tender and violent now
Is this the end of dreams
Or just the truth I need?

Now the light is bleeding into my head
She's alive and needing me somewhere else
What will remain the day she goes where I can't follow her?
There is no promise to dim our sight
Not as we enter this bleeding light

I saw it breach the sky, a gateway of fire
And the vapor of each tear we cried
Dissolved in air, she's taking me there
Cause this night is ours to conquer and share
You might also like
I need that umbilical silence
To cut through this veil of doubt
It enters me tender and violent now
Is this the end of dreams
Or just the truth I need?

Now the light is bleeding into my head
She's alive and needing me somewhere else
What will remain the day she goes where I can't follow her?
There is no promise to dim our sight
Not as we enter this bleeding light

Now the light is seeping in through cracks of wasted time
A last reminder of those moments when the world was mine
Like sulphur rains
And morning-afters
Like growing pains
They fade away
Like every time
They made you suffer
I will return (return)

Now the light is bleeding into my head
She's alive and needing me somewhere else
What will remain the day she goes where I can't follow (follow)
There is no promise to dim our sight
No turning back cause tonight we ride
There is no way we can close our eyes
