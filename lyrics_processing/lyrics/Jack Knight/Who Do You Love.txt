Reminisce another throwback queen
From love with a lily white dream
Everybody thought time would tell
But she didn't get off too late at 3
Never waited till methadone
She wind up in the danger zone
I swear to god, Miss 
Needed to get T cells couldn't get wrong
Now everybody's wearin' these ribbons
But that don't mean a thing to me
(It don't mean a thing baby)
I spend my life in his arms
(I spend my life)
So maybe your God could see
(So maybe your God could see baby)
Who do you love?
(Who do you love?)
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Is it me or the drugs?
(Is it me baby?
Or the drugs baby?)
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Is it me or the drugs?
(Is it me or the drugs babe?
Drugs babe)
Yeah
 fast
She had to make that cold hard cash
Mailman was half an hour late
She almost beat your ass
No one could see the signs
Thought every little thing was fine
But these loves from the back was puttin'
These curses on your mind
Now everybody is steady livin'
But that don't mean shit to me
(Don't mean shit to me baby)
Spend my life goin' crazy
(I spend my life, I spend my life)
So maybe your God could see
(So maybe your God could see)
Who do you love?
(God could see, baby)
(Ooh baby)
(Who do you love?)
Is it me or the drugs baby?
(Is it me or the drugs babe?
Drugs babe, yeah)
Who do you love?
(Who do you love?
Who do you love?)
Is it me or the drugs?
(Is it me?

Sometimes I wish I could shine like a star
(Shine like a star)
Maybe dream in your heavens forever
So I could know who you are
(So I could know who you are, baby
Ooh)
And this time
(This time)
I know you can't be back far
(Know you can't be back far)
Cause I was dreamin' about the 
Showed me where you are
(Showed me where you are baby, yeah)
Who do you love?
Is it me or the drugs?
Who do you love?
