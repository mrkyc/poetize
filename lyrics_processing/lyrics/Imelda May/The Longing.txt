My heart is thumpin' inside of my chest
My temple is burnin' and drippin' with sweat
My mind is spinnin' yeah swimmin' around
My tongues dried up like I've been lickin' the ground

It's the longing
The longing for you
It's the longing

The hole in my chest it twists like a knife
Takin' over my body, takin' over my life
I can't think of nothin', no one else gonna do
I'm haunted by the living, yeah, wantin' you
