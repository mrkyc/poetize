From pub to pound shop, through Kentish Town?
Only a fiver to our name
The drunk on the doorstep had more to our shame
Living over the offie had its trials
The fights all night out there and inside
And those stews that lasted three days into four
And the dreaded baliffs returned to our door
But we stook with each other with all our might
We pulled it together and held on tight
And I'm glad for us, yeah, I'm glad, Machree
But it's nothing to anyone 'cept you and me
There were wrongs for every right
There's ups and there's downs
But you're the one for all my life
My true love I have found, yeah you, my love I found
I watched the moon cover the might of the sun
The weird eerie light at a quarter past one
And I knew in my head as I lay in my bed
That you'd stay in my heart 'til the day I was dead
We killed each other and loved in time
And laughed 'til we almost cried
Yeah, we cried as well when it all went to hell
And my heart, it broke 'til I swear it died
You might also likeBut we stook with each other with all our might
We pulled it together and held on tight
And I'm glad for us, yeah, I'm glad, Machree
But it's nothing to anyone 'cept you and me
There were wrongs for every right
There's ups and there's downs
But you're the one for all my life
My true love I have found, yeah you, my love I found
Oh, you're good at the things that I'm hopeless at
And I notice what you ignore
But it's when I see you're not prefect for me
It's then I love you more and more
And we stook with each other with all our might
We pulled it together and held real tight
And I'm glad for us, I'm glad, Machree
But it's nothing to anyone 'cept you and me
There were wrongs for every right
There's ups and there's downs
But you're the one for all my life
My true love, I have found, yeah you, my love I found, ooh
There were wrongs for every right
There's ups and there's downs
But you're the one for all my life
