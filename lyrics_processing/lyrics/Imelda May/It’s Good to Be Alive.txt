I'm not crying out loud
Don't know what am I asking for
If an answer can be found
The loneliness is killing
Though there's someone in my bed
There's only so much living
That I fear I could be dead
But then standing at my window when
The night seems like it's won
And everything seems brighter
With the sign of the sun
And I said
Oh my God, it's good to be alive
Oh my God, it's good to be alive
I know one thing for sure is that I'll die
But today, yeah, it's good to be alive
Lying in my bedroom
My eyes are wide awake
My body's tired and given up
Oh, for heaven's sake
You might also likeWon't you please send me a little sleep
To ease my worried mind?
I'm losing rationality
That I won't know how to find
But then standing at my window when
The night seems like it's won
And everything seems brighter
With the sign of the sun
And I said
Oh my God, it's good to be alive
Oh my God, it's good to be alive
I know one thing for sure is that I'll die
But today, yeah, it's good to be alive
Things are looking up for me
When the clock keeps ticking on
Holding on to time gone by
Clinging to a song
To pull me through with every word
Or rock me with a tune
And to hold my hand when the shadow man
Is hiding in my room
But then standing at my window when
The night seems like it's won
And everything seems brighter
With the sign of the sun
And I said
Oh my God, it's good to be alive
Oh my God, it's good to be alive
I know one thing for sure is that I'll die
But today, yeah, it's good to be alive
Oh my God, it's good to be alive
Oh my God, it's good to be alive
I know one thing for sure is that I'll die
But today, yeah, it's good to be alive
