I'm a fallen angel, don't wanna be somebody's saint
I've tarnished my halo and my specialty is to take
But I want you to think of me as better than the rest
I've chased away my demons but i'm human at my best

So come adore me, but know I'm gonna fall
Off of this pedestal that I hope you've put me on
And as God's above me, I swear I'll try to be
All that you ever want and I'll be the best of me
I wanna be your human

If you could just believe in me the way I believe in you
Your world would be just heavenly
With our words, we'd speak the truth
So lie down here beside me and we'll gaze up at the stars
Even they can fall sometimes, but they're perfect as they are

So come adore me, but know I'm gonna fall
Off of this pedestal that I hope you've put me on
And as God's above me, I swear I'll try to be
All that you ever want and I'll be the best of me
I wanna be your human
(I wanna be your human)
I wanna be your human
(I wanna be your human)
I wanna be your human
(I wanna be your human)
I wanna be your human

Satellites of love flying skies above
Bring me back to earth, whisper holy words
Planets all alive, Major Tom survived
All is justified when it's you and I

So come adore me, but know I'm gonna fall
Off of this pedestal that I hope you've put me on
And as God's above me, I swear I'll try to be
All that you ever want and I'll be the best of me
I wanna be your human
(I wanna be your human)
I wanna be your human
(I wanna be your human)
I wanna be your human
(I wanna be your human)
