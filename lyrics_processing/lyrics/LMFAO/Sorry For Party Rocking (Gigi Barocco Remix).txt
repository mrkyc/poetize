I'll be up in party
Looking for a hottie to bone
I got a drink in my hand and just a buffalo
Poppin bottles in the house with models in the V.I.P
All the girls make out for the whole damn club to see
Let's go
People always say that my musics loud
Sorry for party rocking
Nighbours complain saying turn it down!
Sorry for party rocking
Haters don't like we got the spotlight
Sorry for party rocking
When they talk shit, we just pick a line
Sorry for party rocking
Baby, baby, baby I'm awfully crazy
I'm so rocked of patrone shit what ever is tasty
We don't got no manners hanging of the rafters
Let's go drink for drink a hundred bucks she on the lasters
Check my style take a good look I'm fresh bitch
In my way with music so loud I'm deaf bitch
Getting drinks at a redlight with people watching
Sorry for party rocking
