Tell me right now
Do you really want to spend your whole life alone?
A little time out might do you good
Might do us good, before we be done for good
Cause I can make it good, I can make it hood
I can make you come, I can make you go
I can make you high, I can make it fly
Make it touch the sky, Hey maybe so
All of the time you be up in my checkin' through my cellphone, baby no
You wanna kill the vibe on another night, here's another fight
Oh, here we go
Oh, here we go
Oh, here we go
Oh, here we go
Oh, here we go
Oh, here we go
Oh, here we go
Oh, here we go
