I be, I be, on it (That ass), I be on it
I be on it (That ass), I be on it
I be, I be, on it (That ass), I be on it
I be on it (That ass), I be on it

One, two, three, to the four
I'm dancin' with as many super freaks as possible
You can't change the spots on a leopard
In the club, the homies call me Redfoo Hefner
We like them girls that party
Them girls that shake they body
Them girls that ain't afraid to jump on stage and be some-body
And that's what I'm talkin' about (Yeah)
Two girls on the couch, mouth to mouth
You might also like
What happens at the party, stays at the party
What happens at the club, stays at the club
Put yo glasses to the sky, damn, I'm so high
And she's so fine, I be on it all night long
What happens at the party, stays at the party
What happens at the club, stays at the club
Put yo glasses to the sky, damn, I'm so high
And she's so fine, I be on it all night long

I be, on it, (that ass) I be on it
(Shake that ass) I be on it (That ass), I be on it
(Shake that ass) I be on it (That ass), I be on it
(Shake that ass) I be on it (That ass), I be on it
(All night long)

Girls, girls, girls and goose
I got a girlfriend, but what's the use?
When ya, some how some way
Keep messin' with fine ass women like every single day
They wanna play, I say okay
Make the booty clap, they obey
I freak girls to death
Got them girls outta breath
Got 'em screamin', you would think I'm OJ
L-M-F-A-O came to make you lose control
Bring ya fine ass on the floor and drop it low
Girl, we a secret society, all we ask is trust
We recruit pretty ladies and that ass is a must
What happens at the party, stays at the party
What happens at the club, stays at the club
Put yo glasses to the sky, damn, I'm so high
And she's so fine, I be on it all night long
What happens at the party, stays at the party
What happens at the club, stays at the club
Put yo glasses to the sky, damn, I'm so high
And she's so fine, I be on it all night long

I be, on it (That ass), I be on it
(Shake that ass) I be on it (That ass), I be on it
(Shake that ass) I be on it (That ass), I be on it
(Shake that ass) I be on it (That ass), I be on it
(All night long)

Party Rock just don't stop
Grab a freak to the beat
And let ya body rock
Party Rock just don't stop
Grab a freak to the beat
And let ya body rock

See, I'mma have a blast when I'm up in the place
I like titties and ass all up in ma face
Haters I can't see em Im just doin my thizzle
Life is too short whens she blowin' ya whistle
I like them girls that's freaky
Them girls that wanna please me
Them girls that get buck and run up and speak to me
But if you see me tomorrow and I'm rollin legit
And I got a girl on my arm, don't say shit
What happens at the party, stays at the party
What happens at the club, stays at the club
Put yo glasses to the sky, damn, I'm so high
And she's so fine, I be on it all night long
What happens at the party, stays at the party
What happens at the club, stays at the club
Put yo glasses to the sky, damn, I'm so high
And she's so fine, I be on it all night long
