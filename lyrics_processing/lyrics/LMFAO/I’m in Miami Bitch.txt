When I step on the scene (Scene)
Y'all know me (Me)
'Cause I walk with a limp
Like a old school pimp, a real OG

I'm in the sand (Sand)
I've got a Red Bull and vodka up in my hand

Hey, you lookin' kinda cute (Ayy)
In that polka dot bikini, girl
Hey, this what I wanna to do (What?)
Take off that polka dot bikini, girl

Drink all day
Play all night
Let's get it poppin'
I'm in Miami, bitch
Drink all day
Play all night
Let's get it poppin'

Everybody on smash (Smash)
Hands in the air (Air)
I'm feelin' on the ass (Ass)
Like a nigga don't care (Like a nigga don't care)
I've got a plan, what's your cell?
We playing naked Twister back at my hotel
