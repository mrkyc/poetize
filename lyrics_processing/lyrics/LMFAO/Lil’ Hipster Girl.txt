Rock shit, grab my dick
Walk up in, banana split
Yes shirt, yellow, purple
Bodies rocking in the circle
I gots to show some love at the AM ladies in the place
I say what up he said (Aw yeah) and then I seen her face

She was cutest thing I've ever seen in my life, my life (Aw yeah)
The way she clicked her heels and put her fist in the sky, two times (Aw-Aw-Aw-Aw-Aw Aw yeah)
(Ahh, ahh, check this out, check-check this out)

Drink mode, freak mode
Takin' a seat is obsolete-lete-lete-lete
Freak a nice booty to the beat, beat, beat
Two step, bump 'n' grind, fancy footwork all the time
I break dancing in the place
Back spin, oh...
That's when I see her face

He is DJ Run
And I am DMC
Funky fresh from 1983
DJ Jam Master Jay
Inside the place with all the bass
He leaves without a trace
And he came here tonight to get on your case
And we are, the crush grooving, the body-moving
The record making, and the record breaking
