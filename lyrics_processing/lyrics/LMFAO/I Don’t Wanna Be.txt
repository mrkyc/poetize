When I walk in the club
The people show me love
They say, "What's up?"
I say, "What's up?"
We say, "What's up, what's up?"
I get looks from the ladies
Daps from the dudes
I'm dressed like it's the 80's
No lenses, checkered shoes
I got a drink in my hand
You know my favorite one
It's Red Bull and vodka
And nigga, I'm faded, son
And then I get those call
From my favorite hizzo
She screaming "Where the fuck you at?"
Baby girl, I'm at the disco
You might also like
I don't wanna be
What you want me to be
I don't wanna do
What you want me to do
Unless it's you, baby
'Cause that's all I want
So come back, stop messing with my head

She was my summer love
Then it got serious
She moved back to her momma's
And got delirious
She went back with her ex
Kept me a secret
Then gets mad at me
When I go to the club and freak it
Aw, naw, baby girl
What you talkin' 'bout
I'm dancing with her bud
You got his dick in your mouth
I ain't no side dish
I'm the main course
I ain't your side bitch
Better decide bitch
Before I find another
I'm a say this one more time
Before good-bye my lover
I don't wanna be
What you want me to be
And I don't wanna do
What you want me to do
Unless it's you, baby
'Cause that's all I want
So come back, stop messing with my head
I don't wanna be
What you want me to be
And I don't wanna do
What you want me to do
Unless it's you, baby
'Cause that's all I want
So come back, stop messing with my head

Eh, uh oh, put your hands up
Put your hands up
Put your hands up
Put your hands up
Sky Blu

I got this girl (Girl)
She be my baby (Baby)
She is my world (World)
And drives me crazy (Hey!)
This ain't how it's supposed to be
I feel like you're trying to take control of me
I'm a man, but I can't glance at these
I can't grow my trees, I can't smoke my weed
Hey
That's how I roll
To the show then off to the club I go
You act like I'm trying to wedding band the hoe
Girl, I'm trying to superman the ho
I do like I do baby, that's how I do, baby
Me and my nigga RedFoo, baby
She said, "You crazy"
'Cause I don't wanna be
What you want me to be
I don't wanna do
What you want me to do
Unless it's you, baby
'Cause that's all want
So come back, stop messing with my head
'Cause I don't wanna be
What you want me to be
I don't wanna do
What you want me to do
Unless it's you, baby
'Cause that's all want
So come back stop messing with my head
'Cause I don't wanna be

What you want me to do
Unless it's you, baby
