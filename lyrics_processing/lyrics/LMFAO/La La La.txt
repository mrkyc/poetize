I feel like, I just seen the sun for the first time
You make my life bright cause you shine
It's me and you baby, it's our time
I'm livin' my dream girl, cause you mine
You got me skippin' down the street and singing love songs all out of key
I didn't smoke nothing, but I feel so high, and I know why:
It's a love thing, it's got to be, your heart's all locked and I got the key
It feels like I just won the lottery, cause I got my girl, and she got me

You my new obsession, all I want to do
You my new obsession, girl
I feel on top of the world with you, baby
I want to dance and party tonight
I feel on top of the world with my lady
I'm gonna rock your body all night

She makes me wanna sing
La, la la la
La, la la la
La, la la la
La, la la la
La, la la la
La, la la la
La, la la la
La, la la la

I can't get you out of my mind
Everything you do is feeling right
Remember that way you caught my eye?
I remember that way you was walking by
Ooh, girl, watch out now
You looked at me, turned around and smiled
Gave me eyes, my heart went wild
Hypnotized, this love starts now
And how do I know you're real?
It really doesn't matter, it's the way I feel
You make me feel super like the Man of Steel
You got me going stupid picking daffodils

You my new obsession, all I want to do
You my new obsession, girl
I feel on top of the world with you, baby
I want to dance and party tonight
I feel on top of the world with my lady
I'm gonna rock your body all night

She makes me wanna sing
La, la la la
La, la la la
La, la la la
La, la la la
La, la la la
La, la la la
La, la la la
La, la la la
La, la la la
La, la la la
La, la la la

You my new obsession
You my new obsession
You my new obsession
You my new obsession
You my new obsession, all I want to do
You my new obsession, girl
I feel on top of the world with you, baby
