Y'all know me (me)
Cause I walk with a limp
Like an old school pimp
A real OG
I'm rockin' Vans (Vans)
I'm in the sand (sand)
I got a Red Bull and Vodka up in my hand
Hey! You look kinda cute (ey)
In that polka dot bikini girl
Hey! This what I wanna do (What?)
Take off that polka dot bikini girl
Drink all day
Play all night
Let's get it poppin'
I'm in LA trick!
Drink all day
Play all night
Let's get it poppin'
I'm in LA trick!
Everybody on smash (smash)
Hands in the air (air)
I'm feeling on the ass
Like a nigga don't care (Like a nigga don't care!)
I got a plan
What's your cell?
We're playing Naked Twister back at my hotel
Hey! You look kinda cute (ey)
In that polka dot bikini girl
Here's what I wanna do (What?)
Take off that polka dot bikini
Drink all day
Play all night
Let's get it poppin'
I'm in LA trick
Drink all day
Play all night
Let's get it poppin'
I'm in LA trick!
Get your hands up (Hollywood)
Whip that ass up (Hollywood)
Get your hands up (I'm in LA trick)
Whi-whip that ass up (Hollywood)
Getcha Getcha Get Getcha hands up
Whip that whip that whip whip that ass up
Getcha Getcha Get Getcha hands up
Whi-whi-whip whip whip that ass up
Getcha Getcha hands up
Whi-whi-whi-whip that ass up

Damn... I'm mothaf*ckin thirsty or somethin'
Yeahh
It's morning time (shh)
And the girls' still there
They're lying naked with some **** in the air
(That's what I'm talkin' bout)
And I won't sit back
She's got some big cojones
But I say I be back
Time to get some Bossanovas
Hey! You look kinda cute (ey)
In that polka dot bikini girl
Hey! This what I wanna do (What?)
Take off that polka dot bikini girl
Drink all day
Play all night
Let's get it poppin'
I'm in LA trick
Drink all day
Play all night
Let's get it poppin'
