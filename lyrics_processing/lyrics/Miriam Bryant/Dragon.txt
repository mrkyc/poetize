I will be your dragon indoors
Take you outside these four walls
You can be my heaven and sky

Apple of the corner of my eye
Your night was light and you told me to fly
I don't know how we are close to the sky
Wondering why I am light in the dark
Like you said

I'll be your dragon tonight
You will never see me on the street
Tears are records on repeat
You will never see me on the street
Tears are records on repeat
I'll be your dragon tonight
You will never see me on the street
Tears are records on repeat
You will never see me on the street
Tears are records on repeat

Take a look at what we could have here
All the things we dream and fear
Could you be my shoulder a while
You might also like
Apple of the corner of my eye
Your night was light and you told me to fly
I don't know how we are close to the sky
Wondering why I am light in the dark
Like you said

I'll be your dragon tonight
You will never see me on the street
Tears are records on repeat
You will never see me on the street
Tears are records on repeat
I'll be your dragon tonight
You will never see me on the street
Tears are records on repeat
You will never see me on the street
Tears are records on repeat

I'll be your dragon tonight
You will never see me on the street
Tears are records on repeat
You will never see me on the street
Tears are records on repeat
I'll be your dragon tonight
You will never see me on the street
Tears are records on repeat
You will never see me on the street
