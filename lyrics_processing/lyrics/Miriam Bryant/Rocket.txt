I know I never had, had you in my grasp
And I held your hand, like it was broken glass
And now isn't the time for people
Come around and remind me of you
Just because it shines, it doesn't make it gold
You are just a troll and you dug yourself a hole
Now isn't the time for people
Come around and think they know the truth
No it isn't the time for the likes of you
I check the clock and tic and toc it through

And my eyes won't sleep
And my heart won't beat
It's over baby, 'cause I can't breathe

So I rocket, rocket, rocket away
I rocket, rocket, rocket away
I rocket, rocket, rocket
I'm rocketin' away, I rocket 'cause I need space
I rocket 'cause I need space

I see cracks in my window, the secret that we told
That we were lovable, wrote everything in bone
Now isn't the time for people
Come around and think they know the truth
No it isn't the time for the likes of you
I check the clock and tic and toc it through
You might also like
And my eyes won't sleep
And my heart won't beat
It's over baby, 'cause I can't breathe

So I rocket, rocket, rocket away
I rocket, rocket, rocket away
I rocket, rocket, rocket
I'm rocketin' away, I rocket 'cause I need space
Oh my love, oh my love
How we love but I let go
Oh my love, oh I'm rocketin' away
I rocket 'cause I need space

Mouth won't speak
And my lungs won't breathe
We're over baby, you and me

So I rocket, rocket, rocket away
I rocket, rocket, rocket away
I rocket, rocket, rocket
I'm rocketin' away, I rocket 'cause I need space
Oh my love, oh my love
How we love but I let go
Oh my love, oh I'm rocketin' away
