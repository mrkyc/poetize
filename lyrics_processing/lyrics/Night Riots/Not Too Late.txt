You would sing us simple songs
I think about, how you kept us safe from harm
I remember when you lost your mom
I was young, but the feels were strong
First time I'd ever seen you cry before
Locked the door with headphones on
I turned sixteen and your song was gone
Sorry for the things I did
Looking back now I was just a kid
I know that one day you'll be gone
I will keep singing your song
God knows life moves on
It's not too late
To say, to say
The words we need to say
A way, a way home
It's not too late
To say, to say
Who knows what's on the way
A way, a way home
Yesterday seems so far gone
Another birthday I forgot to call
I'm so sorry that we're worlds apart
I gotta pour out what's in my heart
I'm the same age now you were then
How'd you get by you were just kid
I don't wanna wake up to a call
Can we sit down can I spill it all
You might also likeHow did we let it get this far?
The moments pass like speeding cars
So sorry for the things I did
Looking back now you were just a kid
I know that one day you'll be gone
But I will keep singing your song
God knows life moves on
It's not too late
To say, to say
The words we need to say
A way, a way home
It's not too late
To say, to say
Who knows what's on the way
A way, a way home
It's not too late
To say, to say
The words we need to say
A way, a way home
It's not too late
To say, to say
Who knows what's on the way
A way, a way home
Yesterday so far away
Close my eyes just to hear it play
I think about when I was young
You would sing that simple song
How did we let it get this far?
Moments pass like speeding cars
I know one day I'll be gone
I hope my kids will sing your song
It's not too late
To say, to say
The words we need to say
A way, a way home
It's not too late
To say, to say
Who knows what's on the way
A way, a way home
It's not too late
To say, to say
The words we need to say
A way, a way home
It's not too late
To say, to say
Who knows what's on the way
