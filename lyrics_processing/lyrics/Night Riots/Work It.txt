It was something that she picked up
A little necklace from a thrift shop
Said she wore it for good luck
She's not just fool's gold
I said we got a lot of night left
You and me and your red dress
I gotta feeling you would like that
So come on now, let's go
I know, I know, I know, I know

I've known it all night long
You and I belong
Your love keeps me working
Don't leave me hurting
Come on and play along
I got the moves, so try me on
Your love keeps me working
Now work it baby

You've got me
Your love keeps me working
You've got me crazy
You've got me
Your love keeps me working
Just do it baby
You might also like
With you it's automatic
We don't need practice
We just go at it
I don't wanna let go
Living true romance
Feeling like the first act
You know where we got to take it
Too much to control

I've known it all night long
You and I belong
Your love keeps me working
Don't leave me hurting
Come on and play along
I got the moves, so try me on
Your love keeps me working
Now work it baby

You've got me
Your love keeps me working
You've got me crazy
You've got me
Your love keeps me working
Just do it baby
Your love keeps me working
You've got me crazy
Love me, touch me
I need you now
Use me, take me
I feel you move
Love to touch you
Need me now
Hold me, touch me
I can't wait forever
I can't wait forever
I wanna be like this
I wanna be like this forever

I've known it all night long
You and I belong
Your love keeps me working
Don't leave me hurting
Come on and play along
I got the moves, so try me on
Your love keeps me working
