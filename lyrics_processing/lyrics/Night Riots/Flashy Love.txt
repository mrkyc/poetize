I was trying to keep it casual
I just can't keep my cool
Play, rewind the intro
Now I'm scrolling through your photos
Are you searching me too?
Congratulations, you made it
You're stuck in my head and I hate it, yeah
You flashy love
Kick back, replay this till it's faded
I'm stuck in my head like a first kiss, yeah
You flashy love
You flashy love (you flashy love)
You flashy love (you flashy love)
You flashy love (you flashy love)
You flashy love
And now you're wearing my shirt, long as a dress
You come barefoot out the screen door
And we sit on the steps
We talk quiet in a world full of noise
Is this the start of something different?
All I hear is your voice
You might also likeI'm falling, I'm falling
I'm falling in over my head
Congratulations, you made it
You're stuck in my head and I hate it, yeah
You flashy love
Kick back, replay this till it's faded
I'm stuck in my head like a first kiss, yeah
You flashy love
You flashy love (you flashy love)
You flashy love (you flashy love)
You flashy love (you flashy love)
You flashy love
You flashy love
Leave, you go your own way
I wish I could tell you, you're the dawning of a new kind of me
Now, I'm just wind in your trees
When all I wanted was to climb up and get lost in your leaves
You flashy love (you flashy love)
You flashy love (you flashy love)
You flashy love (you flashy love)
You flashy love
You flashy love (you flashy love)
You flashy love (you flashy love)
You flashy love (you flashy love)
You flashy love
Congratulations, you made it
You're stuck in my head and I hate it, yeah
You flashy love
Kick back, replay this till it's faded
I'm stuck in my head like a first kiss, yeah
