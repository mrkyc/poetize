Put it all on the line
Do or die
I say hey, I say hey, hey-yuh
Put it all on the line
Out of time
I say hey, I say hey, hey-yuh
Digging dreams out of the fire
Feeling the doubt getting tighter
No backing down, take me higher
Hey, hey-yuh
Put it all on the line
Do or die
I say hey, I say hey, hey-yuh

Rolling up our golden dreams
Stare me down and I just lean back
Never fit in, got that feeling
Follow that sound, no time to sleep

Sick with the stress
I must confess, I am a mess at my best
I count on myself and I don't count on time
I play the fool, I roll the dice
Stomach and head in a vice
Now I look at the clock, I never think twice

I say hey, I say hey, hey-yuh
Put it all on the line
Out of time
I say hey, I say hey, hey-yuh
Digging dreams out of the fire
Feeling the doubt getting tighter
No backing down, take me higher
Hey, hey-yuh
Put it all on the line
Do or die
I say hey, I say hey, hey-yuh

Dipped in gold, our wicked love
Making out we don't need reasons
They don't catch on to what we mean, ooh
Follow the sound, no time to sleep, yeah

Sick with the stress
I must confess, I am a mess at my best
I count on myself and I don't count on time
I play the fool, I roll the dice
Stomach and head in a vice
Now I look at the clock, I never think twice
Put it all on the line
Do or die
I say hey, I say hey, hey-yuh
Put it all on the line
Out of time
I say hey, I say hey, hey-yuh
Digging dreams out of the fire
Feeling the doubt getting tighter
No backing down, take me higher
Hey, hey-yuh
Put it all on the line
Do or die
I say hey, I say hey, hey-yuh
Put it all on the line
Do or die
I say hey, I say hey, hey-yuh
