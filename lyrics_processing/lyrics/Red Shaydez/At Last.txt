I'm into you
But little did I know that you was into me
Back then
I was tryna get to you
And I didn't even know that you were tryna get to me
When I was gone
Damn, I be missin' you
But I never thought that you would be missin' me
Yea, I did things for you
And all along you were still doing things for me
2x

Damn you got me weak
I'm in a daze
I ain't ever seen this part of me
I usually play, but you
Got me rethinkin' all of my ways
And that has really been so hard for me
Cuz when I kick witcha
At the end never want to leave
With other ppl never last a week
But you're a masterpiece
N' I'm amazed more than one can say
I met somebody who can match my freak
I found out
But much more beyond the sheets, we wile out
We cruise or we walk the beach, to my house
Was I never formed a we, out my mouth
Now It's you that I always seem to smile 'bout
That's love
No if ands or butts
Cuz see this here is just for certain baby
I'm never fallin' off cuz I'ma put the work in baby
Make you say that I'm only one that does deserve it baby
That's crazy (crazy crazy crazy)
5 years ago
Who would ever think I'd be ya lady
Walking on a lonely path to nowhere
But you saved me
N I didn't even really wanna go there
But you made me
The way we
Handle business but also we play
Thinkin of you every moment
Each thought of the day
I'm in love
Three words never thought I would say
N' my goal is on an island just walkin away
Due time
Coulda been with any girl in the world
But I'm glad that you chose me
Could it be the libra charm?
I'm an OG
Always tell me when I'm wrong
Plus you know me
N' when ya hold me
N' console me
All of our vibrations tend to resonate
Far away but especially when we face to face
I really hope it's you who's with me up to heaven's gates
That's fate baby
You might also like
I'm into you
But little did I know that you was into me
Back then
I was tryna get to you
And I didn't even know that you were tryna get to me
When I was gone
Damn, I be missin' you
But I never thought that you would be missin' me
Yea, I did things for you
And all along you were still doing things for me
2x

Off the market now
I'm gonna show you all the things that I can offer now
I got another shot at love
Do it proper, I got ya
Our souls going farther n farther now
I'm talking up to sky
Cross the waters now
What you worried bout them guys
I don't bother now
N you know I'll never lie
Plus my guard is down
I'ma show you just exactly where my heart is now
Imma eat with ya
Go to sleep with ya
When we home
In the jeep with ya
In streets with ya
We can go
Rub ya feet feet for ya
Put on on heat for ya, if ya cold
Ya bestie, hitta, homie, sister, or your bro
Pay ya tab yes that's
Even if you say no
When we laugh
As the sun n breeze hit us in the rove
If your mad then I tell you breathe
Baby then I hold-- ya
For keeps baby yes--she's-- never letting go (uh!)
I need your presence and there's nothing I could do without it
You so good you make me tell the crew about it
I'm keeping quiet
All I really wanna do is shout it
But I'll never kiss and tell cuz
What we do is private
But you're surely not a secret
That would mean I'm lyin'
N' you're the greatest thing to me
Although my view is biased
Make sure you never ever let another soul divide us
On my mind, day to day
Head to head, toe to toe
Face to face, on the phone
Wake me up, mind is blown
Is it real damn I hope
Let me know, it's not a joke
I can feel, it in my soul
That's love baby!

I'm into you
