Wit a queen like me
Ain't no need to beat around the bush
See ppl make excuses now instead of makin money
Alotta people feel entitled just because of looks
Alotta people like to follow never be a leader
Except me tho I could never follow by the book
They say ppl gain impressions less than ten seconds
If thats the case then I already got some  ppl shook
100 hunnid
I can tell you have no substance never prove me wrong
All you think about is all the beds that you can screw me on
The hood mentality is probably the tip that you be on
Doing good because you getting money and the roof is gone
Predictable
Heard it all before need to find some different shit to do
And no I will not judge you for the music that you listen to
It ain't even about that, really it's about the principle
Make sure you get to know me before feelin on my physical
Anything I want, I go and grab
Everybody talkin bout what they gon do, but sittin' back
Then they tell me that I do too much and that I'm  movin fast
Little do they know I spoke with God
From there I saw my path
Then they see the moves I make
And want to fix their mouth to ask
Tell me how you're doing this
And Shaydez how you doing that
I'll tell em I worked hard for every single thing I ever had
And I work smart for those sayin that Red Shaydez'll never last
Man it's nothing to me
Looking for a man that wants to build
But they be fronting on me
Dining on me and I tell em chill
But they be stuntin on me
Find it funny you can find them creepin
Never find them bummy
Staying out the light I'm in the shade
So I don't have to worry
If it ever reaches that extent
I got my riders for me
In your drafts are text you never sent
Cuz you be hiding from me
Keep it real and also staying true
But you be lying to me
Meanwhile I'm tryna see how my stars aligning for me
Why the hell is this one not a single?
And why the hell is this one called Serena Williams?
Although there is no violence got a gangsta feelin
How long before you signed cuz you could make a killin?
Well thanks I'm doing fine my crew is in the buildin'
They call us 369 and don't you dare forget it
Next year around this time you'll ask me how I did it
But I only post results so you see how I'm livin
