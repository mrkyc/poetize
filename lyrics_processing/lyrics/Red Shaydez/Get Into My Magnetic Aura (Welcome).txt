It's time to get some things in order (some things in order)
Come and take this ride with me
I know you wanna (I know you wanna)
Prolly think you know me
Maybe kinda sorta (kinda sorta)
Relax and just
Get lost in my magnetic aura (my magnetic aura)

So is it the way
How I sway
Like no one exists
Or maybe it's
How my words fall coming from my lips
Show me anybody
I can prolly have them pleading fifths
Got the type of game that make a player want to call it quits
Burning incense
In my room, on my Badu tip
Red light, sets the mood right
Maybe wine to sip
In the shade, staying to myself
I don't ever trip
No time, for them closed minds
Don't acknowledge it
Ok (ok ok ok ok ok)
I'm wavy up in this bitch
Like the way I look in my jeans
Turn to the side to see if they fit
Plus my shoes is looking real clean
My tongue out, I do a lil dip
If nothing else, I know I love me
Don't need likes or comments on pics
All about what's here inside
My exteriors a bonus
As a voice for these young girls
I just want them all to know this
On a road to the riches
There's troubles and wrenches
Thrown at you intended
To stop your intentions
Maintain your persistence
Don't change in an instant
Remember that it is okay to be different
