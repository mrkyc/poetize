Where you been girl ?
Damn since you left I ain't really heard nobody as nice
What you do?
Did you graduate from school?
There's some rumors now that you take flights
You lookin' good, see you back on the market
When you pass, everybody looks twice
It's all love, and I know you grown up
But damn, when you pick up that mic
Aight! (uh)
I did now, so thanks for asking
Was in a dark place and I lost my passion
Embarked on a journey where the music didn't concern me
I didn't care about nothing
I dont know what happened
Feeling under pressure
Confidence was lacking
N' it's prolly cuz my ex lost all attraction
And damn
That's a tough pill to swallow
Only thing I could do was drown in my sorrow
Naw, fuck that shit
I could never trust that shit
Ya'll be on that ol' dumb ass shit
Middle finger up
I be twerkin' in the club wit my day 1's
And you know they love that shit
Yea we look good
Never answer to bad bitch
People wanna see you fail
Wanna see you get ratchet
People makin' their assumptions
Think I'm livin' the lavish
I ain't did nothing yet
I'm just getting established
But luckily, if I grind
Then in due time, I can live a life a luxury
Light one for me
I 'ont even smoke n' don't know how to roll
But they show a lot of love to me
I'm gettin' looks from ya main
Know this pimpin' ain't a thang
Don't be mad cuz they give a lotta hugs to me
Can't get enough of me (huh)
N' I dont know what it really is
But I look out for my people
And they feel the kid
You might also like
You know what
I been doing' a lot of things since I've been gone
I graduated school
Was lookin' for a job
You know, now I'm a flight attendant
So I'm always takin' flights
You know what I'm saying
You know, that's not to be cocky
I thank God every single day
But I have some things I had to take care of
But you know what, it's time to get back to business
Aight!

N' it sucks cuz I see you mad
I'm versatile with a dose of the libra swag
N I ain't perfect but I'm worth it
More than what is on the surface
Personality is jazz, like Aaliyah had
But some days couldn't (speak)
Barely on my (feet)
I was on my own
Couldn't (reach)
Now I'm on a (streak)
They hit up my phone
Wanna peak
But I be a tease
I stay all alone
But I smile on 'em
Then I wild on 'em
Then I'm out on 'em (uh)
I'm just a young'n tryna live her life
N' I can't promise you tomorrow
Cuz I fly tonight
So just be happy in this moment
N' do what I like
N' I'll reciprocate it too
As long as you're my type (uh)
But shout out to the Bean though
N Mac-Town to the 813 yo
But listen
JA holds me down, I'ma rep til the end
Without them, no me yo
Can't forget blog talk in '09
All them grown folk showin' me love
Computer Lady, Goofy Bone, Ceddy J, Smell So Good
Damn we had so much fun
Fast Forward, years later
Prolly in 011'
Button Pusha and Andrew Woods
Heavy hitters
And they always goin' hard for a sista so
Thank you man, it's all good
