It's a night on the town, in the hood wit it
Find a outfit and make sure I look good in it (good in it)
Tell them haters good riddance
Prolly mad cuz the whole team good lookin
Now the music getting louder n' it's way too hard to hear ya
Shawty prolly never ready, takin selfies in the mirror
Hit up bestie cuz she text me
Tell her buy up all the liquor
In the other room twerkin'
She didn't even put her hair up
Watch she tell me that she ain't even see the message
She don't hurry then we all gon miss the free before 11
Bump it
We gon miss the free before 11
We should all just take a Uber
I ain't even gon stress it
Women
We ain't ever gonna learn but
Funny how pregame is always litter than the turn up
Aux cord queen
Illest one you ever heard of
Anybody tell you different
We can fix it
That's for certain but
