It was that very moment
He would become my weakness
And soon our eyes connected
You probably won't believe this
He complimented on my mind
Instead of all my features
And didn't point out my behind although I know he seen it
Leaning
On the stairwell and then he proceeded
I'm thinking let me tone it down
'Cause words can be deceiving
But it was something 'bout his vibe and now he got me feenin'
I wanted him to get inside my thoughts and change the meaning
On how I looked at love
Which leaves you hooked like drugs
Man is this infatuation or could this be leading?
See I'ma let it flow
Decompress and let it go
Next thing you know I'm in his car and now we down the freeway speeding
Continued conversations
Told me 'bout the books he's reading
And his vibrations sending signals to me, I'm receiving
I send them back
Now we attract
This happened for a reason
'Cause we have bonded on a level most do not believe in
Is this for a lifetime or is this for a season?
And here I go again assuming and that over thinking
He assured me that our rhythms were in tact so surely
The stars aligning as the universe creates out glory
And he told me I go off, I'm the effin bomb
I agreed
Said my time is now, so don't be alarmed
And I guess he was impressed by this libra charm
No news to me
'Cause through our eyes we speak
No need to respond

Sway me with your words
We be on a wave
Stimulate my mind
And then proceed to penetrate
Got me feenin' baby
Please don't make me wait
Lost all in your thoughts
And I just want to get a taste
Touch me with your words
Want you all in my brain
Nostalgia in your conversation
I feel no pain
Got me feenin' for that intellect
Don't make me wait
Go deeper for me, deeper
Let me feel that brain wave
Love dis here feelin'

Keep it coming for me
Almost there
You're getting closer
Tell me more about your plans for life
As you get older
My hands between my thighs
I'm mesmerized
You touch my shoulder
You keep this up then I'ma warn you now
It's gon' be over
I swear we be on a wave, we forever laugh
Up and down
We go round and round
Sure to make it splash
Comatose, from that overdose
Can't even be mad
You just rock the boat
Moving coast to coast
And complete the task
Hit the stroke
Hold that body close
We can make it make it last
Hold on though
We have never touched
Though I wish we had
Only 'cause I think I fell in love with your gift of gab
Only hope
Murder what she's wrote
On her pen and pad
Damn
