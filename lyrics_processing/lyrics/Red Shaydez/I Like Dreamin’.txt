Now let me bring my listeners up to date
Cuz what's a better way than music to escape
I'll take you through a journey
Life's full of ups and downs
But right now I'm tryna find some ways to elevate
Find a couple risks to take
A few goals
Go achieve 'em
My back's against the wall
Almost every season
And nothing is intact
Tryna break even
And then I try to stack
But it ain't easy
These are things they said that would happen
Soon as I grow up
My early moments startin this rappin
Nobody showed up
But I dont even give a reaction
I said you know what
It's in my soul
I feel like J. Cole and I'm bout to blow up
And don't nobody gotta believe me
Try to be greasy
I'm two steps ahead, so nobody sees me
I be misleading
I conduct my plays but you call it dreamin'
I really see them
Short fuse if you give me a reason
Usually breezin'
On my one two
Very selective of who I run to
Cuz there are those that try to expose
That there'll haunt you
But onto more positive thinking
Ship never sinkin'
My cup half full n' no one is drinkin'
Had to distinguish
This is not another story of a damsel in distress
High standards
Lot to handle
And will hand you nothing less, than face value
I'm simple, what you see is what you get
Plus a witty demeanor
Cleaner than ones you ever met
That's a bet

New day same story
I need new order
It's bores me (it bores me)
So (I like dreamin')
And certain ppl mad at me
They say live in reality
But that ain't me cuz (I like dreamin')
We all got our different ways
I'm my strongest in a daze
That's where I stay cuz (I like dreamin')
N' Thats what I will continue to
So I'll do me n you do you
N' keep it true

I remember sittin'
Dreamin' up on calumet
Thinkin', wishing if I'll ever make it
Also how you get
Dreams to fruition time is tickin'
N' I better guess it
Picture these were thoughts of an adult
Just from an adolescent
Mama checkin --on me just to see if her child was okay
Cuz I was in my zone, I'm all alone
I see it clear as day
With daddy hustling making sure his seed don't make the same mistakes
Because the only thing he wish for me-- indeed-- was to be great
Now I take --the torch in hand
Success is not a question cuz of course I can
When I was having doubts
Words out my mouth would be
I sorta can
Undergoing changes
My mindset expanding
Didn't think I'd do it then but in hindsight I planned it
Understanding
Life is more than strict rules that you abide by
Cuz even if you cherish each moment
Still it'll fly by
That's why I --stay riding my wave
Just like a high tide
Around but I chill in the shade
Givin' the side eye
And mind my
New day same story
I need new order
It's bores me (it bores me)
So (I like dreamin')
Certain ppl mad at me
They say live in reality
But that ain't me cuz (I like dreamin')
We all got our diff ways
I'm my strongest in a daze
That's where I stay cuz (I like dreamin')
N' Thats what I will continue to
So I'll do me n you do you
