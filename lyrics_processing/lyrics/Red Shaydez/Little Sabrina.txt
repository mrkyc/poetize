Hand on her hip
Tongue out for the pose
N' she pokin' out her chest
So her breast make it look like she 20 years  old (geez)
Make up on fleek
Wit her skin tight jeans, everything's exposed
Doesn't have a mother figure to consider that her child acts way too grown
Preach
Walking down the street to the bus stop
N' she givin dudes a peak, so they must stop
Knowin if she keeps this up, trouble sure will find her
Hoping that her bad grades are a small reminder
A purse in her hand, no books or binder
Clearly getting knowledge isn't on her mind but
She wanted by the boys think she moving forward
Ironically they only care bout what's behind her
N' she shouldn't rock with those
But these are things that somebody should of taught her though
She steady tryna be a dime
It'll cost her though
Nobody keeps loose change, if the dollars rolled
She need to worry bout her place on the honor roll
Instead of thinking bout her taste in designer clothes
We hardly see imagery in the feed
Filled with positive energy
I guess they got a lock on those
N' of course she believes it cuz these lies are told
She ain't woke and the reason is, her eyes are closed
Plus reading doesn't work
She ain't buying those
Only time she's alert, when she's on her phone
Baby girl it ain't love, he just tryna bone
Leave 'em all to the curb, as you find your zone
Cuz you need to find drive baby, not the pole
And that's not what one does
When she finds her own
You might also like
Tryna find her way
Ain't no where to go
She hides behind her smile
Inside she's feeling cold
Tryna find her place
But she don't have a home
N' all her friends are fake
So she is on her own
That's little Sabrina (that's little Sabrina)
That's little Sabrina (that's little Sabrina)
That's little Sabrina (that's little Sabrina)
That's little Sabrina

I sat her down, had to talk to her (I had to talk to her)
She said everything I said made sense
N' that it meant a lot to her (it meant a lot to her)
N' she asked where I been
Would of changed her ways then a lot sooner (a lot sooner)
I explained that not everybody see her the same as that I view her (that I view her)
And that's true cuz
I been down that path before
N' I was a small size, so I wanted more
I could see why she's lost, I do understand
No woman or a man that could guide her or
At least make her understand what shes fighting for
That don't mean she's gonna listen
Cuz her pride is soar
As a result think she went back to lyin more
No I'm not gonna leave, I'll be trying more but
No change happens overnight (overnight)
(no change happens overnight)
N' you can't see the progress with no oversight (oversight)
(you can't see the progress with no oversight)
Every minute getting caught up in the moment but you saw the light (saw the light)
N' there's so many children who are like Sabrina
So I had to write
Let's Go
Tryna find her way
Ain't no where to go
She hides behind her smile
Inside she's feeling cold
Tryna find her place
But she don't have a home
N' all her friends are fake
So she is on her own
That's little Sabrina (that's little Sabrina)
That's little Sabrina (that's little Sabrina)
That's little Sabrina (that's little Sabrina)
That's little Sabrina

You know
The girls today are lost
And instead of talking about them and saying how bad they are
We need to step back and help them
We gotta talk to 'em
Cuz there's other girls out here
Just like little Sabrina
And I wanna be the one to help

Tryna find her way
Ain't no where to go
She hides behind her smile
Inside she's feeling cold
Tryna find her place
But she don't have a home
N' all her friends are fake
So she is on her own
That's little Sabrina (that's little Sabrina)
That's little Sabrina (that's little Sabrina)
That's little Sabrina (that's little Sabrina)
That's little Sabrina
Tryna find her way
Ain't no where to go
She hides behind her smile
Inside she's feeling cold
Tryna find her place
But she don't have a home
N' all her friends are fake
So she is on her own
That's little Sabrina (that's little Sabrina)
That's little Sabrina (that's little Sabrina)
That's little Sabrina (that's little Sabrina)
