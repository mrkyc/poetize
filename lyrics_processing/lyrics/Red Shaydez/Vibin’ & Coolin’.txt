I just wanna ride
I just wanna ride girl
'Nuff wit all that drama
You can leave that all outside
You can leave that all outside (yea)
You can leave that all outside (yea)
Just got off from work
Wanna kick my shoes off
Did a 10-9 n' I just wanna cool off
I just wanna ride
I just wanna ride (I said)

I just wanna ride

And this one for them people
Who don't really want no problems
Who stay cool but mindin' they business
Cuz they don't be all for that drama
And they don't be losin' they tempers
'Less you wanna see cuz they'll find 'em
Yes, I'm cool, calm and collected
But I will show you a reminder
Cuz, ya'll know I don't play that
Please don't get your face smacked
But I'd rather be nice to you
Took a lot for me to say that
Don't get it twisted, I know you will
Say what's on my mind, cuz that's how I feel
I know you're used to just acting wild
But not wit me, cuz I keep it chill
Do we be tripping off these peeps? (no)
And do they get the best of me? (no)
And do you think I lose my sleep? (no)
They just be moving' when I say (go)
I said ok (ok)
I know I am the shizzit
People wonder how I do my thing cuz I be livin'
I say I be fluent and really ain't specific
I do it by my lonely and I make my own decision
