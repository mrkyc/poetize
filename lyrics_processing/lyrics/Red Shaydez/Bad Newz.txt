Your love wasn't true (hey hey hey)
It wasn't true
So sorry to break the bad news baby but
I don't need no love from you
Cuz I found somebody new

I'm here to bring the soul back
Here, playa hold that
Once in a lifetime
Take a picture, kodak
Old style, new flow
Legends call me throwback
Tear ya'll to shreds
Not a threat, it's a known fact
What I hear is so whack
Ya'll dudes piss me off
People claim to go hard
Nah dawg, you getting' soft
That's why it's so lost
Need to find it's way back
In the game too long
'Bout to get yo place snatched
Betta find a new plan
Right now, ASAP
Tryna talk slick
You should know, we don't play that
Ya'll dudes are history
Me, yo, I make that
Might need a second
Here you go, you can take that
Oh no, who's that?
Chillin' in the shade, yo
R-E-D
You already know my name tho
Point blank, case closed
I ain't even finished yet
Save the small talk
Right now, playa cut the check (cut the check)
You might also like
Before we sign that dotted line
Ya'll gotta see my manager
Ya'll do the paper work
Make sure everything's right
And he'll get back to you
Play wit fire, you will get burned
Let's go

They see that I'm on
Now they want a piece of me
Two years ago, the same people wouldn't speak to me
Ok, I'm fine, I don't need your sympathy
Pass up a good thing, now you live in misery
Every other day, getting calls on the regular
Tryna make deals, had to get another cellular
Wanna talk biz, well maybe I'm not ready ta
You was actin' funny, so I don't wanna mess witcha
You's a bandwagonna
A lame who just happen ta
Get a little fame, in the game, out of character
I would neva do that
Yes, it's a true fact
Know where I'm going, but tell me where are you at?
Me, you could neva be
No longevity
Gone with the wind, now your just a lost memory
See, I'm too clever G
Spit flows heavily
Stay on they minds, so they always will remember me (yea yea)
Missy Elliot, Queen Latifah, Lil Kim, Foxy Brown, MC Lyte
That's my category, put me in that era

I laugh, you mad
Wake up, news flash
We don't need you
Get ta steppin' witcha whack ass
Walk from afar, get a glance at the new breed
This time around, new class of the femcees
So lost now, but in due time you'll see
You can go adapt, if you don't, you will be
Rolled ova, cold shoulda
Lights off, show's ova
Was warned, I told ya
Things change, get older
God's gift, heaven sent
To achieve eminence
Headstrong, make mistakes
Conquer all, that's a bet
Haters mad, get upset
I don't care, I won't let
Them discourage me
Come to me, nor disrespect
One that you neva met
Style and intellect
Think I'm hot now
There's some things I ain't mentioned yet
Now you get the picture
Nothing but a winner
Pay close attention, be careful might miss her
