Everybody thinks that if they don't sleep
That's gonna make then rich
Nah
You gotta have what you need
To make it
Aight
You gotta work
You gotta pay your dues
So I grind all day

Bounce x8

Who you know coast to coast, round the globe
That can, put it down like me
You ain't seen nan
And I look good on the cam (but I)
But I stay low key
Sumn' like a boss
Yea you know me, I like to floss
In the front seat and take charge
They be like chill (chill)
Chick!
And you know I never will (cuz I)
Cuz I only want it all
Blowin' up my phone
Mad cuz he in the friend zone (tryna)
Tryna get a romance (romance)
He doin' the most
He be tryna kiss n' hold hands
Please come and get yo man
Not throwin' no shade
But he's immature for his age (and I)
Need somebody who is grown
Like that cutie over there
The other one can get lost
Cuz he didn't stand a chance (uh)
See the plan is to move your han-hands (If you with it)
You a fan, turn you to a stan-stan (when I'm finished)
Fingers up, you can even dan-dance (cuz it's hittin')
Do it all never say can-can't (cuz you livin')
Cross the water in the atlan-lantic (pacific)
In the desert running' through the san-sand (I be in it)
I'd be lying if I said that I ain't loving' every minute
Not even trying but I know that I am something you should witness

24 hours I bang
Don't sleep
Work all day, I don't eat
Please, never let my dough freeze
Take a peak
Imagine what you don't see

Do you go hard?
Up all night on yo' job?
Grind out, don't stall
Stack a couple g's, that's no prob

You know what I hate?
When you see a familiar face
N' they claim they went to college witcha
Yea I know you girl
But I don't wan be bothered witcha
You seem fake n' you prolly got some drama witcha
Where was you when I was on campus dead broke?
You wasn't wit me 8 hours straight up in the lab
You never tried to help me study when I stayed up late
Just to write another essay for another class
Chick please, just leave
I'm feelin' myself right now
Not street, but I'll get it dealt wit right now
What's love, cuz I'm being selfish right now
Chill homie, have several seats, please pipe down
To get rich
Gotta take some risks (never play it safe)
You invest, start spendin' less (on the clothes n' chains)
Then you read
To you know what you need (so they know your name)
Not tryna preach
Maybe put you on (maybe you can hang)

Well rounded, head strong
Takes time, it takes long
I may be right, I may be wrong
I want real estate, stocks, bonds
I'm educated, but like to dance
Why ya'll act like you can't do both
In a few years, I'll get another degree
N' I'll party too
So take notes
Ya'll can do it all, ya'll one dimensional
But we break rules, we unconvetional
These are basic steps, my moves not mentioned though
Always networking n' always flexible
N' that's it, thats all you getting' tho
You ain't heard this, I'm all original
Damn, who's this?
It's me, thats spittin' tho

Yea you heard few, but I'm different though
