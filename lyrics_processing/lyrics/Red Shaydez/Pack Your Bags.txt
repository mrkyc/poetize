Me and my boyfriend ain't speaking
I cussed him out, now he hate me
I'm 'bout to go off the deep end
He can

Pack his bags, get his shit
Pack his bags, get his shit
Pack his bags, get his shit
Get his shit
Get his shit

I caught him up in a lie
I ask about it last weekend
Could it be one of his floozies?
Is it a chick that he freakin'?
Prolly some of them phonies
Each time I see her, she peekin'
I'm thinking', bitch can I help you?
I know it's something' she seekin'
Of course he tells me I'm bugging'
Cuz all us females be tweakin'
But this ain't the first time
This is an action repeated
Now

Pack your bags, get your shit
Pack your bags, get your shit
Pack your bags, get your shit
Get your shit
Get your shit

It wasn't always this bad
There was some times that were beautiful
He would tell me he loves me
And getting' spoiled was usual
Takin' trips to the island
Or simply being' spontaneous
Having fun in the passenger
While he switching' the lanes n' shit
Here comes the change n shit
Now I'm seein' how strange he is
Time is passing' by
And he ain't doing' some things he did
Before

Pack your bags, get your shit
Pack your bags, get your shit
Pack your bags, get your shit
Get your shit
Get your shit
But let me get on women too
Cuz we know just how women do
We can tell the difference from when she is and ain't into you
Tell her

Pack her bags, get her shit
Pack her bags, get her shit
Pack her bags, get her shit
Get her shit
Get her shit

She's a different person
No longer wants to get intimate
Now she's starting' them arguments
And you notice it's silly shit
Staying out how longer
Saying she with her girls
She coming in late n' textin'
Somebody's rockin' her world
But don't accuse her
You know she'll air out your laundry
Last time she caught you on your shit
And you said baby I'm sorry
Tell her
Pack her bags, get her shit
Pack her bags, get her shit
Pack her bags, get her shit
Get her shit
Get her shit

All over the same story
Divorce, then alimony
Custody of the kids
I'm wishin' somebody warned me
Still optimistic
Some of us are conflicted
Some of us make it work
And others pack up and dippin'
That single living'
Now we go out n' mingle
Tryna find a partner
And turns out nobody single (damn)
Cuz we
Packed our bags, got our shit
Packed our bags, got our shit
Packed our bags, got our shit
Get our shit
Get our shit
Packin' n dippin'
Cuz people start actin' different
And now's the time that we had it
We searching for higher livin'
Pack your bags, get your shit
Pack your bags, get your shit
Pack your bags, get your shit
Get your shit
Get your shit

I'm tired of all the liars
Come on
Dude be real with me
I've always kept it real with you
Always knew what the deal would be
I was naive
It's something I had to learn
And what we give out to others
We'll never get in return
Maybe at times
But surely it wasn't this
Tired of back and forth
My brother you are dismissed (uh)

Pack your bags, get your shit
Pack your bags, get your shit
Pack your bags, get your shit
Get your shit
Get your shit
Now get to packin', dippin'
Cuz you was actin', different
And I don't want you, no more
So you can have these, women
Now get to packin', dippin'
Cuz you was actin' different
And I don't want you no more
So you can have these women
Have 'em (huh)
