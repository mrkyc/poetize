You make me skin swell
The world me tell
Though I've tried before to tell her
Of the feelings I have for her in my heart
Everytime that I come near her
I just lose my nerve as I've done from the start
Every little thing she does is magic
Everything she do just turns me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for her goes on
What me say
Girl I want to fill your sexual appetite
Want to take you on a magic carpet ride
Want to make you a proposal to be my wife
Give you love comfort for the rest of your life
I'll never make you sad I will treat you right
If there's a dark cloud me a go change it to bright
Girl I want to fill your sexual appetite
Want to take you on a magic, on a magic, on a magic ride
Every little thing she does is magic
Everything she do just turns me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for her goes on
Do I have to tell the story
Of a thousand rainy days since we first met
It's a big enough umbrella
But it's always me who ends up getting wet
Every little thing she does is magic
Everything she do just turns me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for her goes on
I resolved to call her up
A thousand times a day
And ask her if she would marry me
In some old fashioned way
But my silent fears have gripped me
Long before I reach the phone
Long before my tongue has tripped me
Must I always be alone
Every little thing she does is magic
Everything she do just turns me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for her goes on
If I told you that I love you girl what would you say?
I need you in my life every step of the way oh ho yeah
Just believe every word I say
Surrender your love you will make my day
Woman me are your love injection
Woman me want for stick you in your love section
Nah go make you be no substitution
To me you are every solution
Woman you for know me nah go dis de program
I told you that I need you
