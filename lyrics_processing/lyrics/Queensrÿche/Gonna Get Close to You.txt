I like to look at shadows sweating on the wall
I get excited when I hear your footsteps in the hall
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Ooh, outside your balcony, I have a room with a view
And I'm watching you
I dial your telephone each and every afternoon

I await by your door till you're asleep at night
And when you're alone I know when you turn out the light
(Turn out the light)

I'm gonna get close to you
Oh oh, so close to you
I'm gonna get close to you
I'm gonna get close

You fumble for your keys, I'm six or seven steps behind you
I'm so close to you
Are you terrified of me? What do I know about you?
How did I find out?

You think I'm a fool or maybe some kind of lunatic
You say I'm wasting my time but I know what to do with it
It's as plain as black and white
You might also like
I'm gonna get close to you
Oh oh, so close to you
I'm gonna get close to you
Oh, so close

If you knew my infinite charm
Oh oh, there'd be no reason to be so alarmed

Maybe I'm wrong, maybe I'm right, maybe I'm some kind of lunatic
You say I'm wasting all my time but I know what to do with it
It is plain as black and white

I'm gonna get close to you
Oh oh, so close to you
I'm gonna get close to you
Gonna get so


I'm gonna get close to you
Oh oh, so close to you
I'm like a hungry criminal
And your protection is minimal, so minimal
I'm gonna
I'm gonna get close to you
Oh oh, so close to you
I'm gonna get close to you
Oh oh, so close to you
I'm gonna, I'm gonna be so close
I'm gonna get close to you
Oh oh, so close to you
I'm gonna get close to you
