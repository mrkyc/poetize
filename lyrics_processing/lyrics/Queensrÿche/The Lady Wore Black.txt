On a lonely walk this morning
A light mist in the air
Dark clouds laughing at me in silence
Casting shadows through my hair
In the distance I saw a woman
Dressed in black with eyes of grey
She wore her pain like a shackled spirit
Eternal life was her debt to pay

The lady wore black
It's the sign of a prisoner's lives
The lady wore black
See the years through the tears in her eyes
The lady wore black
Her mystic power calls to me
The lady wore black
Her love could set me free
Woah-oh
Oh no

The wind song whispered a warning
Telling me to beware
Of the quiet shadowed woman
And of the sadness I would share
We sat for sometime together in silence
Never speaking in words
Of all her thoughts she spoke with her eyes
And I listened remembering all I heard
You might also like
The lady wore black
It's the sign of a prisoner's lives
The lady wore black
See the years through the tears in her eyes
The lady wore black
Her mystic power calls to me
The lady wore black
Her love can set me free
Yeah, oh no


The words she spoke were of forgotten lives
And of all knowledge gained
Memories I had but didn't know why
With a smile she explained
I should've listened to the wind's cold warning
And walked the other way
I touched her soul and now I bear her sentence
But for her love, I'll gladly pay

The lady wore black
It's the sign of a prisoner's lives
The lady wore black
See the years through the tears in her eyes
The lady wore black
Her mystic power calls to me
The lady wore black
Her love can set me free
The lady wore black
It's the sign of a prisoner's lives
The lady wore black
See the years through the tears in her eyes
The lady wore black
Her mystic power calls to me, oh
The lady wore black
Her love can set me free
The lady wore black
The lady wore black
