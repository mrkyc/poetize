Most of this is memory now
I've gone too far to turn back now
I'm not quite what I thought I was but
Then again I'm maybe more
The blood-words promised, I've spoken
Releasing the names from the circle
Maybe I can leave here now and
Oh, transcend the boundaries

For now I'm standing here
I'm awaiting this grand transition
The future is but past forgotten
When you're on the road to madness

Times measure rusts as it crawls
I see it's face in the looking glass stop
This screaming laughter hides the pain of it's reality
Black, the door was, was locked, I opened
Oh, now I've paid that price tenfold over
Knowledge, was it worth such torment
Oh, to see the far side of shadow?

And still I'm standing here
I'm awaiting this grand transition
I'm a fool in search of wisdom
And I'm on the road to madness
Yes, I'm on the road to madness
You might also like
I'm awaiting endlessly
Pounding rhythms echo me
Won't you take me somewhere far beyond the void?


And still I'm standing here
I'm awaiting this grand transition
Well maybe one day, oh, I'll meet you and we'll
We'll walk the roads to madness
Yes, we're on the road to madness

Oh, I think they've come to take me
I hear the voice but there's no-one to see
I can't scream, too late, it's time

Shhh, believe me

Stay on the course to pass, you'll never find the answer
To a place where darkened angels seemed lost but never found
Scream to see the light of forming figures fast behind you
Lay the past in the wind to spin and your fate will sail beyond the open plains, yeah

Sail with angels onward, live or die for the chosen one said
Saber sights cast a spell behind you, they lock in all around
Free the scene insider, you're never looking back to find why
Ride a horse 'till the end of time and you'll stand atop the gate

Laying waste in the path recited
Fighting force won't avenge the guided black wing
Oh, electric might poses fright inside me
Seeing light at the end of sight reminds me
