"Kill her, that's all you have to do"
"Kill Mary?"
"She's a risk
And get the priest, as well"

10 PM, I feel the rain coming down
My face feels wet, my mind a storm
Flashing lights as people race to find shelter from the pour
Moving silent through the streets, they're mine, they're mine

Midnight, she sings praises in the hall
To saintly faces, hallowed be their names she can't recall
Sister Mary, virgin Mary, silent with her sin
"What are you doing out in the rain?"
She feels me, I can taste her breath when she speaks
"I've been waiting for you, come in"

Mary, Mary, just a whore for the underground
They made you pay in guilt for your salvation
Thought you had them fooled? Now they've sent me for you
You know too much for your own good
Don't offer me faith, I've got all I need here
My faith is growing, growing tight against the seam
What we need is trust to keep us both alive
Help us make it through the night
You might also like
I've no more want of any faith
Binds my arm and feed my mind
The only peace I've ever known
I'll close my eyes, and you shoot

No Mary, listen, you've got to pull your strength
From my lips, I pray I feed you well
Your precious cross is gone, it made me wait so long
For what you gave to everyone
The priest is cold and dead, on his knees he fell
From my barrel of death, he turned
The holy water red, as he died he said, "Thank you"
I just watched him bleed

I feel the flow, the blessed stain
Sweating hands like fire and flames
Burn my thighs, spread in sacrificial rite
The hallowed altar burns my flesh once more tonight

Mary, my lady of pain, always alone
Blind you search for the truth
I see myself in you, parallel lives
Winding at light-speed through time


No time to rest yet, we've got to stop his game
Before madness has the final laugh
Too much bloodshed, we're being used and fed
Like rats in experiments
No final outcome here, only pain and fear
It's followed us both all our lives
There's one thing left to see
Will it be him or me?
There's one more candle left to light

Don't turn your back on my disgrace
The blood of Christ can't heal my wounds, so deep
The sins of man are all I taste
Can't spit the memory from my mind
I can't cry anymore

Mary, my lady of pain, always alone
Blind you search for the truth
I see myself in you, parallel lives
Winding at light-speed through time
