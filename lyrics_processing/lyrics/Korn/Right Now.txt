I'm feeling mean today
Not lost, not blown away
Just irritated and quite hated
Self-control breaks down
Why's everything so tame?
I like my life insane
I'm fabricating and debating
Who I'm gonna kick around

Right now! (Can't find a way to get across the hate when I see you)
Right now! (I feel it scratch inside, I wanna slash and beat you)
Right now! (I rip apart the things inside that excite you)
Right now! (I can't control myself, I fucking hate you)

I'm feeling cold today
Not hurt, just fucked away
I'm devastated and frustrated
God, I feel so bound
So why do I feel the need?
I think it's time to bleed
I'm gonna cut myself
And watch the blood hit the ground

You open your mouth again
I swear I'm gonna break it
You open your mouth again
My God, I cannot take it
