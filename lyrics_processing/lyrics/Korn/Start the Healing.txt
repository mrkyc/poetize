Do you really wanna come with me?
It's hard to see from the eyes of a stranger
Are you ready for the fear to leave
So that you can breathe and not live with the danger?

But there's always something fighting its way back in
But there's always something pushing me to give in
Do you really wanna make believe
And try to achieve a little break from the anger?

I should've been good, I should've been down
I couldn't let go, what could I do?
(I can take it all away, the feelings)
(Break apart the pain and start the healing)
I should've withstood, I shouldn't bow down
I couldn't get through, what could I do?
(I can take it all away, the feelings)
(Break apart the pain and start the healing)

Do you really wanna prowl with me?
This travesty, it cuts sharp like a razor
Are you ready for your scars to bleed?
You will succeed pulling out the invaders

Everything I'm feeling burst into flames
Looking at a soul that's broken and strained
Every night the wish is always the same
Keep on hoping that I don't go insane

The more you fall for it, the more it starts to stick
The more you fall for it, the more it starts to stick
The more you fall for it, the more it starts to stick
The more you fall for it, it's never gonna quit
I should've been good, I should've been down
I couldn't let go, what could I do?
(I can take it all away, the feelings)
(Break apart the pain and start the healing)
I should've withstood, I shouldn't bow down
I couldn't get through, what could I do?
(I can take it all away, the feelings)
