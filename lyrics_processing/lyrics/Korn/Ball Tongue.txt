There you are alone
With no hope of ever having something to be proud of
Something earned without begging
Yes, I know you're a person, a person close to me
Who do you think you are
And what more do you want from me?

Why are you at home, buried in your self-pity?
Why do you insist on living the life clean out of me?
Yes, I know you're the person, the person that took time with me
Does it give you the right to expect your life revolves around me?
