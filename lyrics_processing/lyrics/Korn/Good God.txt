You came into my life without a single thing
I gave into your ways, which left me with nothing
I've given into smiles, I fell for all your games
I wish so bad right now I hadn't let you in

Won't you get the fuck out of my face, now?
Won't you get the fuck out of my face, now?

The sea of life, you're just a minnow
Live your life insecure
Feel the pain of your needles
As they shit into my brain

I scream without a sound, how could you take away
Everything that I was? Made me a fucking slave
Your face that I despise, your heart inside that's gray
I came today to say you're fucked in every way

Won't you get the fuck out of my face, now?
Won't you get the fuck out of my face, now?

You suck me dry

Won't you get the fuck out of my face, now?
Won't you get the fuck out of my face, now?
