HIV!

Here I am different in this normal world
Why'd you tease me, made me feel upset?
Fucking stereotypes feeding their heads
I am ugly, please just go away

(HIV!) I can see it's hard to find
This blessing in disguise
(HIV!) Why you treat me this way?
Made the hate stay

As I walk I can never seem to escape
All the laughing, all the pain
If you were me, what would you do?
Nothing, probably, you'd just throw me away

(HIV!) I can see it's hard to find
This blessing in disguise
Why you treat me this way?
(HIV!) Made the hate stay

You'll see

I'm just a pretty boy, whatever you call it
You wouldn't know a real man if you saw it
It keeps going on day after day, son
Hey you, faget! Get away, we don't want none
I'm sick and tired of people treating me this way every day
Who gives a fuck, right now I got something to say
To all the people that think that I'm strange
And I should be out here locked up in a cage
You don't know what the hell is up now anyway
You got this pretty boy feeling like I'm enslaved
To a world that never appreciated shit
You can suck my dick and fucking like it!

I'm just a pretty boy, I'm not supposed to fuck a girl
I'm just a pretty boy, living in this fucked up world
I'm just a pretty boy, I'm not supposed to fuck a girl
I'm just a pretty boy, living in this fucked up world
All my life, who am I?
All my life, who am I?
All my life, who am I?
All my life, who am I?
All my life, who am I?
All my life, who am I?
All my life, who am I?
All my life, who am I?
All my life, who am I?
All my life, who am I?
All my life, who am I?
All my life!

I'm just a faget! (Faget!)
I'm just a faget! (Faget!)
I'm just a faget! (Faget!)
I'm a faget! (Faget!)
I'm not a faget! (Or am I?) (Faget!)
I'm not a faget! (Or am I?) (Faget!)
I'm not a faget! (Or am I?) (Faget!)
