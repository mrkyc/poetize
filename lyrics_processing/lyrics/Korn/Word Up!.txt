Yo, pretty ladies around the world
Got a weird thing to show ya, so tell all the boys and girls
Tell your brother, your sister and your mama too
We're about to go down, and you know just what to do
Wave your hands in the air like you don't care
Glide by the people as they start to look and stare
Do your dance, do your dance, do your dance quick, mama
Come on, baby, tell me what's the word

Oh, word up, everybody say
When you hear the call, you've got to get it on the way
Word up, it's the code word
No matter where you say it, you know that you'll be heard

Now all you sucker DJs who think you're fly
There's got to be a reason, and we know the reason why
You try to put on those airs and act real cool
But you got to realize that you're acting like fools
If there's music, we can use it, be free to dance
We don't have the time for psychological romance
No romance, no romance, no romance for me, mama
Come on, baby, tell me what's the word

Oh, word up, everybody say
When you hear the call, you've got to get it on the way
Word up, it's the code word
No matter where you say it, you know that you'll be heard

Word up, everybody say
When you hear the call, you've got to get it on the way
Word up, it's the code word
No matter where you say it, you know that you'll be heard
Word up, everybody say
When you hear the call, you've got to get it on the way
Word up, it's the code word
