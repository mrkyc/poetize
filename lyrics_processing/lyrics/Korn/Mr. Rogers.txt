The time has come to realize
What you are, what you've done inside
The time has come
All have something to talk about, I will too

Looking back (dumb)
And now I realize (old man)
How much you really liked him (dumb)
This child's mind you terrorized (old man)
You came to him (dumb)
He really didn't know your lies (old man)
Now his innocence's gone (dumb)
He's that child you terrorized (old man)

This fucking thing that I feel
It came to me from you
This fucking thing that I
Because of you
My childhood is gone
Because I loved you
My childhood is gone
Because I loved you
Be my neighbor!
