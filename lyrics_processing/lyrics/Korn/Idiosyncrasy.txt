And the dark seems to light my way
And the path is deceiving
And the end is so far away
It might just defeat me
But I gotta take my time
And I won't let it take me away
And it never got the best of me

Don't do it
Don't give in
Won't you ever get it?
Won't you ever get it?

You've chose to walk a thin line
Replaced the hurt without healing mine
You hold disgust in your heart
You just fucked with me, idiosyncrasy

In my heart lies a blackened rage
Sometimes it overtakes me
Why the fuck did I run away?
My shadow is waiting
But I gotta face the facts
Of a twisted reality
And it never got a hold of me

Don't do it
Don't give in
Won't you ever get it?
Won't you ever get it?

You've chose to walk a thin line
Replaced the hurt without healing mine
You hold disgust in your heart
You just fucked with me, idiosyncrasy
You've chose to walk a thin line
Replaced the hurt without healing mine
You hold disgust in your heart
You just fucked with me, idiosyncrasy

Crawling down the path, I'm helpless, reaching for the light I see
Every time I get too close, the light proceeds ahead of me
Taking deep, I take a step, standing up, I take a breath
Running towards the light, I feel the fingers wrapped around my neck
God is making fun of me
He's laughing up there, I can see
God is making fun of me
He's laughing up there, I can see
God is making fun of me
God is making fun of me
God is making fun of me
He's laughing up there, I can see
God is making fun of me
He's laughing up there, I can see
God is making fun of me
He's laughing up there, I can see
You've chose to walk a thin line
Replaced the hurt without healing mine
You hold disgust in your heart
You just fucked with me, idiosyncrasy
You've chose to walk a thin line
Replaced the hurt without healing mine
You hold disgust in your heart
