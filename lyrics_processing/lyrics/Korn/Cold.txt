(Go away)
They come for me, discomforting
They make me feel like I'm one step away
(Go away)
From doing it, I'm through with it
I can't do it, suffer, can't get to it
(Go away)
They come for me, discomforting
They make me feel like I'm one step away
(Go away)
From doing it, I'm through with it
I can't do it, suffer, can't get to it

Set the bait and I'm waiting
In a state of concentrating
I'm gonna knock this motherfucker down, down, down, down, down
And there's a catch with this waiting
All of my thoughts are overtaking
Do I got the strength to take this fucker down? (Down, down, down)

Deep in me, insulting
Talking shit, pushing me
Cold
Cold

Inside lying deep, the father of hate
The endless nightmare I can never escape
The broken in flames, they call out my name
They dance in my dreams while I scream out in pain

I'm on my way, this is the day
This is the time to break it down
Get out my way, nothing can stay
This is the time to break it down

Alone, awake with the craving
I watch my step, I'm calculating
On how I'm taking this motherfucker down, down, down, down, down
I don't know what I am thinking
Sometimes I feel like I am sinking
Into the ground I'll call my grave

Cold
Inside lying deep, the father of hate
The endless nightmare I can never escape

I'm on my way, this is the day
This is the time to break it down
Get out my way, nothing can stay
This is the time to break it down
Break it down
Deep in me, insulting
Talking shit, pushing me

I'm on my way, this is the day
This is the time to break it down
Get out my way, nothing can stay
This is the time to break it down
I'm on my way, this is the day
This is the time to break it down
Get out my way, nothing can stay
This is the time to break it down

(Go away)
They come for me, discomforting
They make me feel like I'm one step away
(Go away)
From doing it, I'm through with it
