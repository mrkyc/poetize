As it all falls down
Do I walk away?
Or do l stand my ground
And accept my fate?

And there's the faceless cries
That twist my every dream
And almost every night
I hear the demon sing

Why are we going on this way?
Why do we play these games in vain?
Nothing's gonna break it down
And build us back again
So why did the path have to lead this way?
Black is the soul that's led astray
You're leading me to places I can never follow

Happiness is found
In the darkest ways
And as I search around
I knew nothing but mistakes

That twist my every dream
And almost every night

Why are we going on this way?
Why do we play these games in vain?
Nothing's gonna break it down
And build us back again
So why did the path have to lead this way?
Black is the soul that's led astray
You're leading me to places I can never follow

And when you scream
You push me so much further ahead
And when I leave
I always walk right back again
And when you cry
The tears are cleansing bitterness
I'm out of time
I'm slowly dying, give me back my life!
Just give me back my life!
Just give me back my life!
Just give me back my lies!
Why are we going on this way?
Why do we play these games?
Nothing's gonna break it down
And build us back again
So why did the path have to lead this way?
Black is the soul that's led astray
You're leading me to places I can never follow

As it all falls down
Do I walk away?
Or do I stand my ground
