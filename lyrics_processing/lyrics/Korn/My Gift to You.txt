There you are, my precious
Not long ago
Hiding behind the shadows
Of your broken soul
Why is it always, you want something you can never have?
Why'd you try to tempt me?
How could you be this way?

Your throat, I take grasp (Can't you feel the pain?)
Then your eyes roll back (Can you feel the pain?)
Love racing through my veins (Can you feel the pain?)
(Can't you feel the pain?)
Your heart stops beating (Can't you feel the pain?)
Black orgasms (Can't you feel the pain?)
I kiss your lifeless skin (Can't you feel the pain?)

There you are, my precious
With your broken soul
Rubbing my crotch, elated
Taking control
Why is it always, you fuck up something you have always had?
Why'd you try to tempt me?
How could you be so cold?
Your throat, I take grasp (Can't you feel the pain?)
Then your eyes roll back (Can't you feel the pain?)
Love racing through my veins (Can't you feel the pain?)
(Yes, I need the pain)
Your heart stops beating (Can't you feel the pain?)
Black orgasms (Can't you feel the pain?)
I kiss your lifeless skin (Can't you feel the pain?)

Here I am, just a man
Feeling pain, gives me life
Relieving us is my plan
I'd do anything just to see through your eyes
Just to see through your eyes
Just to see through your eyes
Just to see through your eyes
Just to see through your eyes
Just to see through your eyes
Just to see through your eyes
Just to see through your eyes
Just to see through your

I hate you
Can't you feel the pain?
I hate you

I hate you
Can't you feel the pain?
I hate you
Can you feel the pain?
I hate you
Can you feel the pain?
I hate you
Can you feel the pain?
I hate you
Can you feel the pain?
I hate you
