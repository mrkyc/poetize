Living life, don't you cry
My life, pain is God
Many nights, painful thoughts occur
Yell at me again, I'm numb
In denial, I tried to be your friend
I tried to be a good boy
All I see, a hate deep inside
Startle me, someone save me
Now, these memories fill my heart!
They bury me!

All I wanna do! (You are not my real mother)
Is kill you! (I'll beat and stab and fuck her)
All I wanna do! (You are not my real mother)
Is kill you! (I'll beat and stab and fuck her)
All I wanna do! (You are not my real mother)
Is kill you! (I'll beat and stab and fuck her)
All I wanna do! (You are not my real mother)
Is kill you! (I'll beat and stab and fuck her)

Looking back, I was never ever right
You were my step-mom
Who always wanted me out of your sight
I would come walking in, and I'd say hello
But you slap me
And you make some fucked up comment about my clothes
Then I tried to let it pass
But the visions in my head
Were with you
With a knife up your ass, laying dead
So I pop some more caps in your ass
Now your son is not so fun
Motherfucking bitch!
Never try to play me!
You made my life not so good

All I wanna do (You are not my real mother)
Is kill you! (I'll beat and stab and fuck her)
All I wanna do (You are not my real mother)
Is kill you! (I'll beat and stab and fuck her)

Wish you were dead/Now!
Ahaha!

How can I cry over someone I never loved?
