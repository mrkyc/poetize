(OVO, OVO Sound Radio)

Smoke so much pack that I just might go colorblind
Dick so long, you can land a plane on it, I'm just being honest
Picking your bitch like a guitar for later (Yeah, what's up?)
She ringing me 'cause she know I'ma only pick up for the pay up
Get that pussy wet, my lifestyle aquatic
My bad bitch exotic
She is a Native, Egyptian, American
She's every woman, she's swearing it
I told her, I need my reefer
Fuck me, suck me and rub my tummy
Can't believe that she keep our little secret for so long

She said, "All I'm ever good for is sex and money"
Dick and money
I said, "All I wanna give to you, girl, is this dick and money
This dick and money" (This dick and money)
No feelings, no feelings, no feelings (Eh, yeah, yeah)

Drank so much codeine, nigga, 'til I'm colorblind
She gon' do the coke until she can't see the line (Sound)
I re-ed up on my reefer
Xanax got me sleeper
Leanin' by the litre (6ix!)
I drown in my bitch, she aquarius (Aquarius)
All this codeine got me nodding off (Nodding off)
Yo' bitch at the crib, nodding off (Nodding off)
All these pills got me nodding off (Nodding off)
I'ma get turnt 'til my knob is off
Give her my love, nigga, not at all, nigga, not at all, you know
