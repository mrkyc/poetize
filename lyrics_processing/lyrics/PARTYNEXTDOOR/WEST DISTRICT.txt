Tell me, should a real nigga feel this way?
'Cause I've been already gone, baby
Smoking and I'm drinking strong, baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah (Yeah)
I try to play numb to shit like this
But I'm cool, 'cause this isn't love (Yeah)
We all have obsessions
Sh, sometimes, sometimes (Yeah)

'Cause when I'm on the road, I be on the road (Check it)
I mean you can hold me down, but I'm not to hold (We flexin')
Ridin' with my niggas we the ones they chose
Runnin' through the city like, "I know you know!"
Yeah, my name is PARTY and the trigger finger function (yeah)
Silly nigga might lose his life on assumption (Yeah)
Young nigga from the city
Ain't shit pretty, but my bitch and my mama
Anyone can get the drama (The Dalai Lama)
Strippers in the club and my cup's half empty (I know you wanna)
Ridin' with my niggas, 'cause my niggas understand me
Still on plan A, pussy niggas on plan B
Just a young rich nigga, you don't have to understand me forever
'Cause when I'm on the road, I be on the road (Check it)
