You like, you fuck with mimosas?
Yeah, yo I love champagne, I love champagne

She call me Private Party SLS
She fuck with Khaled just 'cause we the best
IPhone go silent like I ain't need the stress
Fuck that shit, you know I need the sex

I'm with a stripper and we in the church
Don't tell my dear mama where you work
Hit the corner, girl we leave at ten
Told my nigga that you'd bring a friend
Yeah, you still fire, I ain't need a BIC
I got money, I don't need a bitch
He yo' snitch, she yo' snitch now
Niggas telling on me to my bitch now

A lot of niggas in the game but I can not vouch for 'em
Niggas ball, but is he ballin' for you?
He your ex, I'm your ex too
Shawty I never could talk shit you know I got it for you
