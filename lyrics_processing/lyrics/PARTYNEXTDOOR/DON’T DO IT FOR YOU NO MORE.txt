One little step too far
I think I'm on the edge of losing it
I think I apologized enough
I'm sorry, I'm sorry
Two shots for me and a bottle for her lies
'Cause if I told the truth, still wouldn't make it all right (All right)
Hard to find the words when they've all been said
I'm sorry, I'm sorry

Say I don't make you smile
Say I don't make you laugh
Say things don't cross your mind and make you forget 'bout the past
Say I, say I don't
Say I don't do it for you no more, baby (Don't do it for you no more, baby)
Ye-eh, yeah-yeah (No more, baby)
Ye-eh, yeah-yeah (No more, baby)
Ye-eh, yeah-yeah (No more, baby)
Say I don't do it for you no more, baby

Two little steps too far
I think I'm on the edge of losing us
I think I apologized enough
I mean, how many times can I say sorry?
I'ma need two shots for me and a bottle for her lies
'Cause if I told the truth, still wouldn't it make it all right (All right)
Still a hundred thousand words, one day all will be said
I'm sorry, I'm sorry
