They jealous so they lurking on me, I don't mind
My new girl's not too thirsty to ride, she's riding for me
Ride or dying for me, oh
Girl, you're the reason you're lonely tonight
But this the season to get back your life

This is your chance

Come take a chance

Every bitch wanna be you
Every nigga wanna meet you

I see niggas looking in my city, oh
And I know what you been up to
But that is no good, it's no good even though I do it
Baby, I'm outchea, baby, I'm outchea, you know what I'm pursuing
Yeah, you know, girl, you're the reason you're lonely tonight
But this the season to get back your life
You might also like
This is your chance
