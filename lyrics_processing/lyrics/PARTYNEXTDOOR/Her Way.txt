Yeah, I see her, PX

Swear I'm gone, gettin' gone with my niggas (Yeah)
We hit the club, niggas cups full of jealous (Yeah)
We in the back and we muggin' to T.I. (You know it)
And I'm with a bad bitch and I got an idea (Oh, yeah)

(I'll still say) This bitch looks like Lindsay Lohan
She gets down just like Lindsay Lohan
Round the block, she's not showin' nothin'
That bitch bad, watch her blow a whole band

She gets her way (Way, way, way)
It's like every time
Like any time of day
In every single way
Girl when she gets her way (Way, way, way)
That's just how she ball
That's just how she hustles
No clue how she does it
She gets her way, way
