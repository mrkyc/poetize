Now, that we won
I'll never ever be the same again
This is perfection (This is perfection)
You're making it all so (aaaah)
You know we'll make it through the night
Right, from the start
You knew just how to fill this lonely heart
A pure confection (A pure confection)
Sweetness of your (hmmm hmm)
I've never felt like this before

Made for each other (Made for each other)
You and I (You and I)
Made for each other (Made for each other)
We're flying high (We're flying high)

I'm not afraid to show
I want the world to know i'm by your side
By your side

And, so you'll see
We, two, have got the perfect harmony
A true reflection
Of all you gave to me
You know i'll always be with you
You might also like
