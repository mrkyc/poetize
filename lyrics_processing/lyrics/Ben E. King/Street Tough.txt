Living on the city street tough
When you're street tough
You came down the ups and downs of life turnin' you round
You got to keep on moving on
Places you know, people you see thats where you find
The answers to survive, learning things as you go
And now you're traveling down the path
Of life where only fools dare to go
And even though you're losing
You know you just can't let it show
When you're street tough
You got to learn to be strong

You got to take care of your own

Win or lose live or die
Street tough
When you're street tough
And through the years you hold your tears
You have to face, you got to to survive
Doing the things you got to do, you know you're better
If you want to stay alive (stay alive)
