Tonight stars
Tonight I'm seeing stars
Tonight stars
Tonight I'm seeing stars
Tonight stars
Tonight I'm seeing stars
Once again, I find myself with my friends
Dancing the night away, it's like the party never ends
Then again we don't want it to stop
'Cause tonight's the night it goes sweatbox
Laser beams, flashing lights, wild cards
Men from Mars, dressed in stars and stripes
Eclectic electric, ladies of the evening
Drinking booze and mingling
Moshing to the music, I can do anything
Freaky deeky star speckles and pink butterflies
And life is nice, so nice
I walk into a club and I've found paradise
I'm seeing stars, I can't believe my eyes
I'm seeing stars
Oh my starry eyed surprise, sundown to sunrise
Dance all night, we gonna dance all night
Dance all night to this DJ
Sugar, dance all night to this DJ
Oh my starry eyed surprise, sundown to sunrise
Dance all night, we gonna dance all night
Dance all night to this DJ
Sugar, dance all night to this DJ
Dance all night to this DJ
Lover dance all night to this DJ, uh, huh
Now the record always spins on the trails we blaze
The walls are closing in but that's okay
'Cause I've been waiting all week to feel this way
And it feels so good, so good
I'm on top of the world, the coolest kid in the neighborhood
So let me be a star for one night, that's right
Sweatbox, laser beams, flashing lights
You've got to feel the rush, feel the spice of life
Love-life, Shifty rolls the dice snake eyes surprise
Icing, memorizing, the minds are sick ones
'Cause what we are, is victims of fun
Come on, come on, the fun is just begun
Come on the fun is just begun, ha ha
Oh my starry eyed surprise, sundown to sunrise
Dance all night, we gonna dance all night
Dance all night to this DJ
Sugar, dance all night to this DJ
Oh my starry eyed surprise, sundown to sunrise
Dance all night, we gonna dance all night
Dance all night to this DJ
Sugar, dance all night to this DJ
Dance all night to this DJ
Lover dance all night to this DJ, uh, huh
It goes, cla, I see stars
I'm seeing stars, I'm seeing stars
Seeing stars, I'm seeing stars
Seeing stars, I'm seeing stars
Oh my starry eyed surprise, sundown to sunrise
Dance all night, we gonna dance all night
Dance all night to this DJ
Sugar, dance all night to this DJ
Oh my starry eyed surprise, sundown to sunrise
Dance all night, we gonna dance all night
Dance all night to this DJ
Sugar, dance all night to this DJ
Dance all night to this DJ
