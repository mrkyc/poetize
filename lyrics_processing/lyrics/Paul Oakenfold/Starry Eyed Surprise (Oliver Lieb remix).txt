Tonight, to the stars
Tonight, I'm seein' stars
Tonight, to the stars
Tonight, I'm seein' stars
Tonight, to the stars
Tonight
Once again, I find myself with my friends
Dancin' the night away it's like the party never ends
Then again we don't want it to stop
'Cuz tonight's the night it goes
Sweatbox, laser beams, flashin' lights
Wild cards, men from Mars, dressed in stars and stripes
(Eclectic electric, ladies of the evenin', drinkin' booze and minglin')
Mashin' to the music, I can do anything
Freaky dicky star speckles and pink butterflies
And life is nice, so nice
I walk into a club and I've found paradise
I'm seein' stars, I can't believe my eyes
(I'm seein' stars)
Oh my starry eyed surprise, sundown to sunrise

Dance all night, we gonna dance all night, dance all night to this DJ

And it feels so good, so good I'm on top of the world
The coolest kid in the neighborhood
So let me be your star for one night that's right
Sweatbox, laser beams, flashin' lights
You've got to feel the rush, feel the spice of life
Love-life, Shifty rolls the dice snake eyes surprise
Icein' mesmerizin' the minds are sick ones
