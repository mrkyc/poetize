I know you're gonna through a lot of things
I can see it in your eyes but I can't explain it
Situation looking so strange
Like a picture on the wall without the frame and
When the tears fall I wanna be there to catch 'em
(Just let me, babe)
And if you get lost, let me change your direction
(It's this way)
'Cause he's not treatin' you like a (queen)
And I hate when he cause a (scene)
I wouldn't do it in my wildest dream, no
Don't let it happen 'cause baby you are so beautiful
I don't wanna step on his toes but I think he should know

You never had someone (that's all about your needs)
You never had someone (that always do you properly, yeah)
You never had someone (that give you what you're waiting for)
You never had someone
But now, baby, you got someone
You ain't had, never had no one to lay you down (Oh no)
Start up on the bed
When we're finished we'll be on the ground
But you hadn't been working
Girl, I know you've been hurting
But baby, don't you worry
'Cause now you got someone, you got someone
You might also like
At home with your head down
Don't wanna show your face from the confrontation
Can't even go to work now
Gotta call out saying you that you need a vacation
I don't know why you let him do it
(Why you let him do it, girl?)
But it seems you getting used to it (Yeah)
You don't have to make an excuse
For the crazy things he do
You ain't gotta take the abuse, no
Even though it's none of my business
(I'm right there when your sky turns gray)
Girl, believe in me, I'll never treat you that way

You never had someone (that's all about your needs)
You never had someone (that always do you properly, yeah)
You never had someone (to give you what you've been waiting for)
You never had someone
But now, baby you got someone (You got someone)
You ain't had, never had no one to lay you down (To touch your body)
Start up on the bed
When we're finished we'll be on the ground
(Right on the ground, baby)
But you hadn't been working (Working)
Girl, I know you've been hurting (Know that you've been hurting)
But baby don't you worry (Oh)
'Cause now you got someone, got someone
Let me hear you say
You gon' pack your bags and walk away
Let me hear you say
That you ain't gon' take it another day
Let me hear you say
That baby you're not gon' be afraid
You gon' be okay (Say it baby, say it)
Let me hear you say
You gon' pack your bags and walk away
Let me hear you say
That you ain't gon' take it another day
Let me hear you say
That baby you won't be afraid
You gon' be okay (Say it baby, say it)

You never had someone (You never had no one like me)
You never had someone (Now you do, baby, oh)
You never had someone (You never)
You never had someone
Baby, you got someone
You ain't had, never had no one to lay you down
(Make love to you)
Start up on the bed
When we're finished we'll be on the ground
(That's what I'm gonna do)
But you hadn't been working (Yeah)
Girl, I know you've been hurting (Hurting)
But baby don't you worry (Don't worry baby, baby)
But now, you got someone
You never had someone (Now you do)
You never had someone (Now you do)
You never had someone (Now you do)
You never had someone (Now you do)
