I'm back again, in this town, to find a girl that I used to know
I bumped into a friend of mine and she told me where to go
She said "go right down to 56th street
Make a left at the corner store
There will be a house on the alley way"
I hope she didn't move away
I pray she's still around
But somebody came to the door that I didn't know
And I knew I had to let her go
Is it over? All over?
I let a good girl get away

How could I ever let her get away
Today is not a happy day
So many words that I had to say
Baby I miss you and I need your love
How could I ever let her get away
Today is not a happy day
It could have been our anniversary
I'll do anything to have you right here in my arms

Remember when we talked about
All the things that we planned to do
Our wedding day, a house in the valley
And maybe a kid two
We could have had it all, but somehow it all fell apart
I agree to take the blame, see I'm feeling so ashamed
I never should have lied
I'll give anything to see your pretty face again
To hold you, to be with you, heaven give me one more chance
You might also like
How could I ever let her get away
Today is not a happy day
So many words that I had to say
Baby I miss you and I need your love
How could I ever let her get away
Today is not a happy day
It could have been our anniversary
I'll do anything to have you right here in my arms

If only it were possible for me to turn back the hands of time
I'd do anything, I'll give anything just to make her mine
I can't live without your lovin' baby, I can't go on another day
Where did she go? I gotta know
I let a good girl get away, get away, get away

How could I ever let her get away
Today is not a happy day
So many words that I had to say
Baby I miss you and I need your love
How could I ever let her get away
Today is not a happy day
It could have been our anniversary
