The party's over and you're still here
And I wonder why, baby, can you make it clear?
'Cause you're acting like you wanna spent the night
And the way I'm feeling, girl, I just might
(Let you stay with me)
And if you act right, I might (Let you lay with me)
'Cause I, 'cause I
I've been watching you watching me half of the night
If you're thinking what I'm thinking, then you know it's time, yeah

I can't wait 'til we all alone
I can't wait 'til we get it on
I can't wait 'cause it's been too long
Can't wait
Girl, it's getting late, 'cause I've had enough
Oh baby
I know that I just can't wait no more
'Cause girl, I'm goin' crazy
Baby, I can't wait no more
I wanna give your body what it's waiting for
I know I got to have you right now
Not now but right now
Baby, 'cause I just can't wait
You might also like
I got a throwback and some boxers you can wear
Or you can do like me and sleep in nothing, I don't care
I'll do whatever it takes to make you comfortable
The way you look is so incredible
I need to (Let you stay with me)
And if you act right I might (Let you lay with me)
'Cause I, 'cause I
I've been watching you watching me half of the night
If you're thinking what I'm thinking, then you know it's time, baby

I can't wait 'til we all alone
I can't wait 'til we get it on
I can't wait 'cause it's been too long
Can't wait (Whoa)
Girl, it's getting late, 'cause I've had enough
Oh baby
I know that I just can't wait no more
'Cause girl, I'm goin' crazy
Baby, I can't wait no more (Can't wait no more)
I wanna give your body what it's waiting for
(What it's been waiting for)
I know I got to have you right now
Not now but right now (Right now)
Baby, 'cause I just can't wait (Wait, baby)
Girl, you got me breaking plans that I need to keep (I do)
Got an early day tomorrow so I need to be sleep (Be sleep)
But I don't mind (Oh)
'Cause being with you is like I'm in a dream, ooh

I can't wait 'til we all alone
I can't wait 'til we get it on (I can't wait)
I can't wait 'cause it's been too long
Can't wait (Oh)
Girl, it's getting late, 'cause I've had enough
(I've had enough)
Oh baby
I know that I just can't wait no more
(And I know I can't wait, no, no)
'Cause girl, I'm goin' crazy
Baby, I can't wait no more (Wait no more)
I wanna give your body what it's waiting for
(Wanna give you exactly what you're waiting for, baby)
I know I got to have you right now (Right now, right now)
Not now but right now (Right now, right now)
Baby, 'cause I just can't wait

Oh, oh (Baby, 'cause I just can't wait)
Oh, oh (Baby, 'cause I just can't wait)
