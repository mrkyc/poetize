Wooh
Ladies and gentlemen
And all the lovers around the world
I wanna talk about the one I love
I know a lot of times we forget
How they take good care of you
But tonight I just wanna express the way I feel

Oh, baby
Funny how things have
Changed in my life now
Whether near or far
I wanna be where you are
And you're like a rose
That blooms in my garden
Innocent and sweet
My love, you are
But one thing I know, girl

Loving, loving
Ohh

For me to do baby
And, I will feel this way
Till the end of time (owhh)

But when it comes to you

Heaven's my destiny
When I'm with you
The only place to be just you and me
Ohhh

My life is so incomplete without you baby (oohh, owhhh)
