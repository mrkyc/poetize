If I didn't have a dime
Tell me, would you spend the time?
All I hear is, "Buy me things"
Baby girl, what's on your mind?
You said money ain't a thing to you
But all that shoppin' you do
I can't keep a dime in the safe
I'm not tryna pull your weight
Let's make a deal

Baby, let's make a deal
If you hear what I say
When you get what you want
We can have everything
As long as you learn how to give and take
Baby, let's make a deal
If you hear what I say
When you get what you want
We can have everything
As long as you learn how to give and take, girl

Tell me why the house ain't clean?
Why my son ain't in school?
Why the phone bill so high?
Girl, you must think I'm a fool
All you do is run around all day
I come home, you got somethin' to say
Talkin' 'bout what a man don't do
That's why I wrote this song 'bout you

So baby, tell me can you cook a meal? (I'm gettin' hungry)
Can you wash a load? (Wash the clothes)
Baby, take this house (Take this house)
Turn it and make it home (Home)

Baby, let's make a deal
If you hear what I say
When you get what you want
We can have everything
As long as you learn how to give and take
Baby, let's make a deal
If you hear what I say
When you get what you want
We can have everything
As long as you learn how to give and take, girl
Fellas, if you're in your Jeep (One time)
Or if you're in your Bentley
Won't you turn it up for me (One time), hah
Turn it up for me

Ladies, hope you're feelin' the song
Layin' home all alone
It's time for me to set it straight
Sit back and let it marinate

Baby, let's make a deal (Let's make a deal)
If you hear what I say
When you get what you want (Anything you want)
We can have everything (Keep it real)
As long as you learn how to give and take
Baby, let's make a deal (Ohhh)
If you hear what I say
When you get what you want
We can have everything (Everything)
As long as you learn how to give and take, girl

Oh, why?

You can have everything
Oh, why?
It's on you
Oh, why?
Let's make a deal
Oh, why?
Want you to know, me and you, babe
Oh, why?
Oh, why?
As long as you learn how to give and take, girl
Fellas, if you're in your Jeep (One time)
Or if you're in your Bentley (Two times)
Won't you turn it up for me (Three times), hah
Turn it up for me (Three times)
Ladies, hope you're feelin' the song
Layin' home all alone
It's time for me to set it straight
Sit back and let it marinate
Fellas, if you're in your Jeep (One time)
Or if you're in your Bentley (Two times)
Won't you turn it up for me (Yeah), woo
