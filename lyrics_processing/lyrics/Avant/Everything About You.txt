If I can get inside your mind and let my light shine like no other man would
If I can physically, mentally and emotionally make you feel like no other man could
If I can take you to my house and lay you on the couch and do my thing
If I express to you the way I feel in this song 'bout the joy you bring, yeah
(Chorus)
Is it your hair, No!
Your eyes, No!
Your face, No!
Its everything about you
Its your neck, No!
Your breasts, No!
Your navel
Its everything about you
Its your ears, No!
Your thighs, No! (My Girl)
Your beautiful toes
Its everything about you. I don't have one thing that I don't love about you girl
Its everything about you
If I...
Can smell the morning dew and your body scent too laying next to me
If I...
Can give you protection, love, and affection so baby, you don't have to worry
If I ...
Can be your teddy bear, or the one that truly cares when it hurts so much
If I...
Can be the one that fits in your life, like a Mit or a hand in glove...(i'll be)
I'll be your sunshine, when your in the rain, (And I will)
I'll give you my happiness and I'll take your pain...yeah!
