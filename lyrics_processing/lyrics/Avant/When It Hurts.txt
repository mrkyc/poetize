Can you take me telling you the truth
When I know the situation look shadiest?
But my girl, will you...
Believe when I say I knew that you be trippin'
So I slept out in my ride in the driveway

So before we get into the things that we shouldn't do
I'ma need your undivided attention
'Cause it's fantasies and reality
Baby, which one are we living in? Oh

When it hurts, will we still be
The same two lovers all over each other? Oh
When it hurts, will we still see
Why we got together? Promise that we'll never (Ever be)
Temporary (Not another)
Ordinary (Uh-uh)
We should change people's definition of love
So forget what you heard
The only way that this will work
Is if you love me when it hurts
(Can you love when it hurts?)
You might also like
I don't wanna blend in
With every other relationship that be falling in and out, girl (Not us)
I knew that I trip
'Cause every time we argue
I think about having someone on the side, girl

So before we get into the things that we shouldn't do
I'ma need your undivided attention
'Cause it's fantasies and reality
Baby, which one are we living in? Oh

When it hurts, will we still be
The same two lovers all over each other, will we?
When it hurts, will we still see
Why we got together, promise that we'll never (Ever be)
Temporary (Not another)
Ordinary (Uh-uh)
We should change people's definition of love
So forget what you heard
The only way that this will work
You gotta love me when it hurts

Baby girl, we gotta face it
There'll be times that we let each other down
And on them days that you ain't feeling me
Will you be able to stick around?
'Cause anything worth having's worth fighting for
If we really want this thing to work, we gotta go to war
Girl, I'm in this thing, I mean really in this thing
But through the tears, will you still be here?
When it hurts, will we still be
Same two lovers all over each other?
When it hurts, will we still see
What we got together? Promise that we'll never (Ever be)
Temporary (Not Another)
Ordinary (Uh-uh)
I wanna change people's definition of love
So forget what you heard (So forget what you've heard, oh)
'Cause the only way that this will work
Is if you love me when it hurts (When it hurts)

When it hurts (When it hurts)
Will you love me when it hurts?
Girl, when it hurts (When it hurts)
When it hurts (When it hurts)
Will you love me when it hurts?
When it hurts (When it hurts)
When it hurts (When it hurts)
Will you love me when it hurts?
When it hurts (When it hurts)
When it hurts (When it hurts)
