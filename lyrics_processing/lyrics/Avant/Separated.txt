Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Mmmm, hmmm, mmmm, mmmm
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah
Mmmm, hmmm, mmmm, mmmm
Listen, babe

Every time I see you, girl, I get a bad vibe
(Mmmm, hmmm, mmmm, mmmm)
Just thinking of someone else in between your thighs
(Mmmm, hmmm, mmmm, mmmm, mmmm, mmmm)
And you thought you were slick, had tricks up your sleeve
(Mmmm, hmmm, mmmm, mmmm)
But I'm sick of your stupid ass and I know you're tired of me
(Mmmm, hmmm, mmmm, mmmm, mmmm, mmmm.)
That's why I say...

When we were together
We never turned our backs on each other
Oh, but now
But now that we're separated
We can't stand one another

I don't wanna be with you
Put that on everything I own
(Mmmm, hmmm, mmmm, mmmm)
I can't believe I stayed around that damn long
(Mmmm, hmmm, mmmm, mmmm, mmmm, mmmm)
If I never see you again, I won't be mad at all
(Mmmm, hmmm, mmmm, mmmm.) No, no
'Cause I believe that you're my downfall
(Mmmm, hmmm, mmmm, mmmm, mmmm, mmmm.)
You did me wrong
You might also like
You did me wrong
I thought you were true.  (Yeah.)
You ran out of my life and now I'm so through with you
I wanted you to be there, right here with me
Oh, oh, oh, oh

And when we were together
We never turned our backs on each other
Oh, but now
But now that we're separated
We can't stand one another
Baby, tell me why
Why, why, why, why?
And when we were together
We never turned our backs on each other
Oh, oooh, oh, oh, oh, oh
But now that we're separated
We can't stand one another
It's really over, baby, 'cause you did me wrong

You did me wrong
I thought you were true.  (Oh, oh, oh.)
You ran out of my life and now I'm so through with you
I remember when you used to sit there
I would hold you in my arms and you would say to me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, (Yeah, yeah.)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I used to rub your body and you would say to me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, (Yeah, yeah.)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Mmmm, hmmm, mmmm, mmmm, mmmm, mmmm.)
When we were together, you'd say
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, (Yeah, yeah.)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Mmmm, hmmm, mmmm, mmmm.) I can hear your body say
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...) Sounds so good to me
(Mmmm, hmmm, mmmm, mmmm, mmmm, mmmm.)
Oooh, yeah.  Oooh, yeah, yeah

And when we were together
When we're together, baby
We never turned our backs on each other
We never turned our backs around
But now that we're separated
Oh yeah
We can't stand one another
Oh, oooh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
And when we were together
Oh baby, baby
We never turned our backs on each other
But now
But now that we're separated
We can't stand one another
Say it again
And when we were together
We never turned our backs on each other
Oh, but now
