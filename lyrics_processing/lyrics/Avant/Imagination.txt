Yo
The sun is going down
I can see the dark forming
The waters rolling in
I can feel the wind blowing
And you got me
Like putty in your hand
It's your fantasy
So I'll answer to your command

I'm part of your dreams
We can do anything anywhere you like
You're fast asleep
And I promise you girl I'm not gonna fight it
We can stay right here forever
Or we can travel the world together (Yeah)
I wanna relieve all your stress
Just don't wake up yet

Your imagination's running wild, running wild
(Yes, it is)
And I love the way it's going down, going down (Down, baby)
Hope you shut off the TV before you went to sleep (Oh)
'Cause I don't need nothing interrupting me
Your imagination's running wild, running wild
(Let me take my time)
And I love the way it's going down (Tonight you unwind)
Did you lock the bedroom door 'fore you went to sleep?
'Cause I don't want nobody interrupting me
You might also like
Our bodies intertwine
Tonight's a full moon
You got me flying high
In this hot air balloon
And you're taking me
To places I've never been
It's your fantasy
And I don't want this to end, no

I'm part of your dreams
We can do anything anywhere you like
You're fast asleep
And I promise you girl I'm not gonna fight it
Never been in this situation (No)
But I'm loving the sensation (Yeah)
I'll give you more than enough
Baby, please don't wake up

Your imagination's running wild, running wild
(It's running wild)
And I love the way it's going down, going down
(I do like it, baby)
Hope you shut off the TV before you went to sleep
(Hope you did)
'Cause I don't need nothing interrupting me
(Hope you did, ooh-oh)
Your imagination's running wild, running wild
(Let me take over, baby)
And I love the way it's going down, going down
(Gots things I wanna do to you)
Did you lock the bedroom door 'fore you went to sleep? (Let me)
'Cause I don't want nobody interrupting me (Please let me)
I can feel someone coming to knock on the door (Yes)
It won't be long before the alarm goes off
And wake you up, cut me off while I'm still in it (Whoa-oh)
You reached your peak and all I need is just one minute
But I don't wanna rush you, girl
I wanna make sure you're satisfied
Been going for hours baby and now I feel it's time
Don't wake up (No)
Wake up (Don't wake up, baby)
Don't wake up
