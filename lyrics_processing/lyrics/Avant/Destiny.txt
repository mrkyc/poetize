I like the way you talk to me
Your words are as sweet as gold
And if you were ever to leave my world
My life would seem so cold
And i know you have someone
And I'll be patient
'Cause one day you will be mine
Take your time

I like the thoughts you given me
Cause your my destiny

And you will you give it to me

Cause i know there's somethings going on
But you don't have to hold on
Cause i want to be with you
Do you want me to
