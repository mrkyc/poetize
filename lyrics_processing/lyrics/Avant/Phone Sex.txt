Yo, let me get that, um, that number, man
Let me call this girl, man
Uhh, what's-what's her name? Um
Uh, A.V. baby, is that you?
Yo
What's up, baby?

Wanna take you with me on a late night creep, girl
That's what's up, that's what's up
And while you're here', erase all your fears
That's what's up, that's what's up
Wanna take you to the shower and spend about an hour
That's what's up, that's what's up
And hold and embrace and girl, I wanna taste, yes, oh, yes
That's what's up, that's what's up

Over the phone is takin' to long (Too damn long)
I can't wait to see you so we can get it on
It doesn't matter about the place
It's goin' down when I see your pretty face
Over the phone is takin' to long
I can't wait to see you so we can get it on
It doesn't matter about the place
'Cuz it's goin' down when I see your pretty face
You might also like
It's goin' down, it's goin' down, it's goin' down
It's goin' down, it's goin' down, it's goin' down
It's goin' down, it's goin' down, it's goin' down
It's goin' down, it's goin' down, it's goin' down

After the first one ends the fun will begin, yeah
That's what's up, that's what's up
I'm gonna give you somethin' to run and tell your friends
That's what's up, that's what's up
Like gettin' freaky at the movies, I don't care if it's PG
That's what's up, that's what's up
In the elevator goin' down, shut it off so we can clown
That's what's up, that's what's up

Oh, baby, oh, in the limo, listenin' to my demo
Girl, close that middle window
Do you want me to stop? N-O or the airplane?
Where turbulence ain't no thang
I got the tool to make you scream my name
It's goin' down, but

Over the phone is takin' to long
I can't wait to see you so we can get it on
It doesn't matter about the place
It's goin' down when I see your pretty face
Over the phone is takin' to long
I can't wait to see you so we can get it on
It doesn't matter about the place
'Cuz it's goin' down when I see your pretty face
It's goin' down, it's goin' down, it's goin' down
It's goin' down, it's goin' down, it's goin' down
It's goin' down, it's goin' down, it's goin' down
It's goin' down, it's goin' down, it's goin' down

In my H2 where the seat fold down like clothes
I'm about to jump in the back row
Girl, you make me curl my toes
At your job, when everybody goes on break
Let's steal the security tape 'cuz baby, I can't wait

Over the phone is takin' to long
I can't wait to see you so we can get it on
It doesn't matter about the place
It's goin' down when I see your pretty face
Over the phone is takin' to long
I can't wait to see you so we can get it on
It doesn't matter about the place
'Cuz it's goin' down when I see your pretty face

It's goin' down, it's goin' down, it's goin' down
It's goin' down, it's goin' down, it's goin' down
It's goin' down, it's goin' down, it's goin' down
It's goin' down, it's goin' down, it's goin' down
I promise, I promise you
I'm gonna take care of you, yes I will
Ooh, you just don't know, girl
I promise, I promise, promise
Oh, oh, this special thing I wanna do you
Baby, just give me a chance, yeah, yeah
Ooh, you got my body just hangin'
And I don't know how to start
And I wanna shoot this thing to start
Do you feel me? Yeah, baby, baby, baby
These things that I'm gonna do
