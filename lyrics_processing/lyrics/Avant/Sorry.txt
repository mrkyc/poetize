I know I was wrong and that's not fair
Playing games with your mind cause I new you cared
Walking out of the door every other night
And I knew two wrongs wouldn't make a right
Now things have changed
And what your feel is not the same
I thought we couldn't make ends meet
But you can't stand no more pain
And now I know pain and it is me
I'm lonely and here is where I want you to be
A woman like you is too precious to lose and I am confused
What will I do baby I love you and I'm
(Chorus)
I'm sorry (I'm so sorry)
I'm sorry (ooh yeah yeah)
I'm sorry (I I I I I I'm)
I'm so sorry
I'm sorry (I want you right here with me)
I'm sorry (ooh baby)
I'm sorry (sorry, ooh yeah)
I'm so sorry
I never knew what true love was till you left me
And now the thought of you with someone else hurts me deeply
I tried to keep those thoughts out of my mind
But I'm thinking about you all the time
Where is our love, I must be out of my mind
What else can I do to prove my love to you
I'm going crazy baby and your love will make me
I never should have done you wrong
And now I'm sitting here all alone
You should feel my pain and for you I'll change
Can I have a second try cause with out you what am I
And I know you don't want to see a grown man cry I'm sorry
You might also like(Chorus)
I'm sorry (im sorry baby sorry baby)
I'm sorry (I don't want you to leave me)
I'm sorry (baby please yeah)
I'm so sorry (I want you to love me all the time)
I'm sorry (I need you to love me all the time)
I'm sorry (whoa whoa whoa)
I'm sorry (whoa yeah)
I'm so sorry (Listen babe)
(Bridge)
Sorry I done you wrong and I never ever, ever wanna be alone (that's why)
I got my self together now
So you don't have to worry bout me running around (running around)
Sorry I done you wrong and I never ever, ever wanna be alone (that's why)
I got my self together now
So you don't have to worry bout me running around (you don't have to worry no more babe)
