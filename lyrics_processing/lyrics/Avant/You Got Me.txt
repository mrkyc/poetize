Hmm...its hard to imagine
I gotta try and work my way up out of this one
The clock is ticking
Tick tock tick tock tick tock
Yeah, this can't be happening to me
Ya know?
Whoa
Just like Eve done to Adam(you got me)
Temptation so strong I don't want to even fathom(you got me)
I'm in quicksand with cement shoes(you got me)
And like Lucille I'm singing the blues(you got me)
(Girl you are)You're my water
Like my money
You're my sugar
(You got me) You got me
Say it, say it, say it yeah
Girl your love flow through me
And I can't keep my hands off you
Girl you taste so damn sweet
You got me
See you are the reason I haven't turned my TV on(you got me)
And you are the reason that I don't listen to love songs(you got me)
And you are the reason I haven't ate in days(you got me)
And you will be the reason that this man will fade away(you got me)

I'm sitting around like a bump on a log
Dragging my feet waiting for your call
Mama called me about a quarter to nine
Didn't answer her call
Don't want to block my line
You're my water
Like my money
You're my sugar
(You're my sweet yeah) You got me
Whoa oh
Girl your love flow through me
And I can't keep my hands off you
Girl you taste so damn sweet
You got me
Listen..Theres a reason why I'm feeling this way about you girl
You got me going crazy, you just don't understand
????, your rollers and your hair things
Your flowers and your ??
Your lotion and your perfume
The way we used to celebrate
The time you would make me wait
The joy you brought to my heart
And now everything is gone
You're my water
Girl your love flow through me
Like my money
And I can't keep my hands off you
You're my sugar
Girl you taste so damn sweet
You got me
Whoa oh oh....
You got me
You're my water
Girl your love flow through me
Like my money
And I can't keep my hands off you
You're my sugar
Girl you taste so damn sweet
You got me
Whoa oh oh....
