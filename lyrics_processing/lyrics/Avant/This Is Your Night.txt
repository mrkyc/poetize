This is your night

Let me take this time and tell you how special you are
Caught everything under the sun but a shining star
We forgot how to love you (But you do too much, boo)
And ain't no amount of apologies gon' ever make up for it
And I know you're tired of (I'm on my way)
And uh (She's just a friend) and them damn video games
But tonight, I'm gon' do it like my daddy did it
Cater to you, that's all I wanna do

This is your night
So baby let me change the game
I want you to make me call your name
'Cause I'm willing to spoil you (Yeah)
This is your night (Your night, baby)
You can tell me all your fantasies
'Cause I'm here to fulfill you're dreams
('Cause tonight is meant just for you)

Now, when your plane get in, go straight down to baggage claim
There'll be a man in a suit holding up your name
Let him take your bags and he gon' walk you to the car
And don't be surprised by the roses 'cause that's not all
Turn on the radio and listen to the music play
(A little Al Green, a little Luther, and a little bit of Marvin Gaye)
But it ain't over
I can't tell you everything that I'm gon' do for ya
I got things for you that you can't get 'til you get here
'Cause I never had a woman like you
Someone who love me the way that you do
And baby, it's official
Tonight was made for especially for you
You might also like
This is your night (Oh, oh, oh, your night)
So baby let me change the game (Let me change it)
I want you to make me call your name
'Cause I'm willing to spoil you (I'm willing)
This is your night (Your night, it's all yours)
You can tell me all your fantasies (Your fantasies, baby)
'Cause I'm here to fulfill you're dreams
(Just break it down, break it down for me)

See, I never met a woman like you
That make me feel this way
That's why I wanna give it up to you
And make today your holiday
'Cause to me you're the reason
That this boy became a man
And the things I'm gonna do to you
I can't wait until your plane lands

This is your night (Tonight is your night, baby, ooh)
So baby let me change the game
(That's what I wanna do is make love to you)
I want you to make me call your name
(Let you control me)
'Cause I'm willing to spoil you
(Let you do anything you wanna do to me)
This is your night
(Just take your time, 'cause I'll be here all night)
You can tell me all your fantasies
(I'm getting so excited)
'Cause I'm here to fulfill you're dreams
(I can almost feel my arms wrapped you
And your legs wrapped around me, oh yeah)
This is your night
