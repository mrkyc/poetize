Oooo I wanna be girl let me be
I wanna be everything your man's not
And I'm gonna give you
Every little thing I've got
Cause you are more than a man needs
That's why I say you're truly my destiny
I'm gonna get cha
If it takes me until forever
No you don't feel me
If forever turns into never
I'll let you know my love
Is just that strong
And for you never just ain't that long (ohhh)

I wanna be the smile
You put on your face
I wanna be your hands
When you say your grace
I wanna be whatever
Is your favorite place, oh
I just wanna be close
I wanna be the hat you put on your head
I wanna be the sheets
You put on your bed
I wanna be the skirt
Wrapped around your legs
Oh, I just wanna be close
You might also like
And even if the day turns into night
I will love you by candlelight
And even if the water starts to run over
I'll be there to put you on my shoulder
And if it's hard for you to get to sleep
I will sing you a melody
I wanna feel this way
Till the end of time, cause I pray one day
That you will be mine

I wanna be the smile
You put on your face
I wanna be your hands
When you say your grace
I wanna be whatever
Is your favorite place, oh
I just wanna be close
I wanna be the hat you put on your head
I wanna be the sheets
You put on your bed
I wanna be the skirt
Wrapped around your legs
Oh, I just wanna be close
See my life's filled with up and downs
I'm ok when you're around
And when I'm in a storm
And my nights are cold
Reach out your hands for me to hold
See you're my queen on a throne
And you're the reason
For a song and I can't wait
To fill you up with love
Fill you with love

I wanna be the sun
Your stars, your moon
I wanna be a hot summer day in June
I wanna be the smell
Of your sweet perfume
I just wanna be close
I wanna be the seed
That bare your life brand new
I wanna be the one
That's so faithful and true
I wanna be the man down that aisle
In that suit, yes
