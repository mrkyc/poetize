I'm your director, it's getting deep
We don't need to rent nothing, we'll make our own movies
I'm your director, it's getting deep
We don't need a videotape or a camera
To make this ghetto love scene
Woo
I wanna welcome everybody here tonight (Uh)
It's such a beautiful occasion (Yes)
I wanna tell you the way I feel, you know
This is for the ladies
I wanna take you to a place you've never been before
(Take you there, take you there)
Sit back and enjoy this ride, woo

Our love exploding in the air
Like the works on the Fourth of July
Or like the sun how it sits upon the earth
Shine through clouds in the sky
I might never get as much airtime
As a pilot would get, but I
But I'd sure like to do things
That we both haven't tried yet
Take a trip to the moon, just me and you, baby
Then we'll shine on the earth
I'll show the world what you're worth
Would you like that?
Tell me, would you like that?
You might also like
I just, I just wanna, I just wanna show
So many ways I wanna show you more
Take our love to another level
So many ways I wanna go to a new paradise
Just one blink of an eye
Ooh, so many ways I can
And I'll never let you go, baby

'Cause this
This message of love is what I'm sending to you
I love you so much, there's nothing I wouldn't do
(For you) For you, for you, girl
Let me be the reason your cup overflows with nothing but joy
Like an orphan at Christmas who gets a million toys
Theres no words to explain how it felt when we met
But I, I'll try with this song and see how far I can get
It feels like Heaven
When you're wrapped in my arms, that's what comes over me
It feels like Heaven

I, I just, I just wanna, I just wanna
In so many ways I (Show you), wanna show you more
(Feel what I'm saying?)
Take our love to another level (Can you hear me?)
So many ways I
(Do you ever wonder where the birds fly?)
Wanna go to a new paradise, just one blink of an eye
(I wanna go, baby)
So many ways I can (Where do you wanna go?)
And I'll never let you go, baby
(Come on, I'm ready to go)
Take you to a place far away from here
Go somewhere to erase your fears
And feel free about life
No worries, in your life
Take you to a place far away from here
Go somewhere to erase your fears
Grass is greener on the other side
Just sit back and enjoy this ride

(So many ways) So many ways I (Let's go)
Wanna show you more (Far away from here)
Take our love to another level (Far away)
So many ways I (Take a car ride)
Wanna go to a new paradise (Allow me to drive)
Just one blink of an eye (Just me and you)
So many ways I can (So many ways)
And I'll never let you go, baby

Ain't nothing stopping us, no (Nothing stopping us)
But space and opportunity, oh yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh yeah, yeah, yeah
