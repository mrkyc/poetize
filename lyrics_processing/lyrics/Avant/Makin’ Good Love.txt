I'm doin' this for all my ladies
I know what ya thinkin', like
"Yo, it sounds like a lullaby", right?
This is for you
Get into it

I got your legs spread all over the bed
Hands clenched in the sheets
Hair wild as hell
I know the only thing on your mind is sexin' me
Girl, I can feel your temperature rising
You should feel my nature too
Come on you should it's gonna be a bumpy ride
Girl, let's do what we came to do

Girl, when we make love all night
When we make good love all night
When we make love all night
We really make love
Girl, when we make love all night
When we make good love all night
When we make love all night
We really make love (Come to daddy baby)
You might also like
On the balcony ripping the rails
Slowly I'm pulling you near
Sayin', "Shhhh, babe, don't make too much noise
There's a lot of people who live around here"
Emotions running high
My hands planted on your thighs
You feel me going up and down
And round and round and round

Girl, when we make love all night
When we make good love all night
When we make love all night
We really make love
Girl, when we make love all night
When we make good love all night
When we make love all night
We really make love (Come to daddy baby)

Girl, your drive wait in the back seat
Windows tinted, it's getting deep
Fog all over the glass
I don't know how long I can last
With you moaning crazy
Girl, keep on calling me
I'll take you to ecstasy
And when I'm done, you'll be fast asleep
Girl, when we make love all night
When we make good love all night
When we make love all night
We really make love
Girl, when we make love all night
When we make good love all night
When we make love all night
We really make love (Come to daddy baby)

The house, the boat, and the jeep, babe
In the tub, in the pool, or the beach, babe
Get your grove on (Get your grove on), get your grove on
The house, the boat, and the jeep, babe
In the tub, in the pool, or the beach, babe
Get your grove on (Get your grove on), get your grove on

Girl, when we make love all night
When we make good love all night
When we make love all night
We really make love
Girl, when we make love all night
When we make good love all night
When we make love all night
