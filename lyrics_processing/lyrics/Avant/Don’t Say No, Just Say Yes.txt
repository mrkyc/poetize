Inside of you, baby (Inside of you)
You make me feel like livin' and breathin' again
I wanna touch you (I wanna touch you)

Don't say no, (Don't say no), just say yes
(Just say yes to me, my baby)
Your body's what I need (It's what I need)
Don't say no (Don't say no), just say yes
(Just say yes, mhm)
I can hear you callin' me

You're my diamond that shines all of the time
Oh mercy me, yeah, yeah
You made me reach my peak
That day you told me that you wanted me
Don't be afraid, baby

You are my season (Season)
And you are the reason
I feel the way I do
As our bodies become as one (Become as one)
You're my star (My star)
That's what you are (You, you are)

Don't say no (Don't say), just say yes
(Baby, please say, say yes, baby)
Your body's what I need (That's all I wanna hear)
Don't say no (Your body on me), just say yes
