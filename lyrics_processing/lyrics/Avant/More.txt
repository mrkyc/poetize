You make me want more
Got me anticipating you more
Girl, I really, really
Want your body, body
The way you put it on me
Got me thinking 'bout
The very first time
You make me want more
When I'm goin strong
I want more
Girl, I really, really
Want your body, body
The way you put it on me
Got me thinking 'bout
The very first time

You were at the peak
Your knees was weak
And the sweat was dripping all over me
And I changed the pace
You might also likeWe took water breaks
We was at it
Should've seen your face

And you knew exactly what to do
To keep me excited, girl
You're so inviting
Know I know where
I need to go
When it gets serious, girl


Got your legs in a V
Then switch to an N
And it feels so good
We gotta go again, girl
When it happens
Go to sleep
Wake up in the morning
Like it's make believe


It is unbelievable
How you make me feel, girl
I'm loving your touch, girl
It seems unreal
Oh, whoa, girl
Unbelievable how you make me feel, girl
Won't let go
Can't let go
Baby girl, I really want you to know

You make me want more
Got me anticipating you more
Girl, I really, really
Want your body, body
The way you put it on me
Got me thinking 'bout
The very first time
More
When I'm going strong
More
Girl, I really, really
Want your body, body
The way you put it on me
Girl, you got me thinking 'bout
The very first time
You make me want more
Got me on it on it
On it, baby
More
Girl, I want it, want it
Want it, baby
I want your body, body
The way you put it on me
Girl you got me thinking 'bout
The very first time
More
When I'm going strong
More
Girl, I really, really
Want your body, body
The way you put it on me
It reminds me of the very first time
