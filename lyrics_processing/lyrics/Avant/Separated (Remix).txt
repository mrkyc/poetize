I don't care what my mama say
I don't care what my daddy say
I don't care 'bout what the preacher said for us to do
I don't care about it
I don't care what you brother saw
I don't care, it was all your fault
How could you do what you did to me?
You wait 'til I was sleepin', call the damn police

Separate (Yeah), what we gotta do
Separate, talkin' 'bout me and you (Talkin' 'bout me and you)
Separate, how it's gotta be
Separate, no more you and me
Separate, what we got to do
Separate (Separate), talkin' 'bout me and you
Separate (Mmm), how it's gotta be
Separate (Mmm), no more you and me

I don't know what you callin' for
So don't you come tryna kick down my door
Everything is mine to keep
Money, car, crib, my kid
Everything
Everything but my boy you can have
And I don't care as long as you don't cross my path
And now I know you never cared at all
For two years you've been my downfall

Separate, what we gotta do
Separate, talkin' 'bout me and you (Know who I'm talkin' to)
Separate (You talkin' to me?), how it's gotta be (I'm talkin' to you)
Separate, no more you and me
Separate, what we got to do (Pack your bags and get outta here)
Separate, talkin' 'bout me and you (I gotta go)
Separate (Mmm), how it's gotta be (How it's gotta be)
Separate (Mmm), no more you and me

Listen girl
Never did explain when I saw you in his Benz (Tell me why)
So what about the movie and you said it was your friend?
But listen
In the bathroom, talkin' low on the phone
Well what do you expect when you ain't never at home?
You see I'm workin' all day and hustlin' all night
I'm cookin' and I'm cleanin', all you wanna do is fight
Why me?
Why me?
I think it's bout' time that we both move on
Be gone
Separate (Separate), what we gotta do (Oh yeah)
Separate, talkin' 'bout me and you
Separate (Separate), how it's gotta be (How it's gotta be)
Separate, no more you and me (Gotta go)
Separate (Gotta go), what we got to do
Separate, talkin' 'bout me and you
Separate (Separate, mmm), how it's gotta be (I'm gone)
Separate (Mmm), no more you and me (No more you and me)

Mm, mm, mmm
Mm-mm-mmm
