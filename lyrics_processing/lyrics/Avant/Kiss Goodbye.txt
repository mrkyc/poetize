Then a number on a piece of paper
She feelin' unappreciated
So she files it away for later
See you done got you a lot of passes
Sick of waiting on you to change
'Cause you done gave her motivation
She's contemplating 'bout changing lanes
You won't know it
It's a perfect disguise
She won't show it
But lips don't lie
It's okay if she show up with a couple Louis bags
That you know you didn't buy
It's okay if you in the bed and her phone rings
In the middle of the night
It's okay if she said she was out with her girls
And you know it's a lie
But if she kissed him
That's your kiss goodbye
I don't want to be the one
Be the one who to say I told you
She ain't trying to stick around
She gon' find another shoulder
You might also likeTake care of her heart
Don't be surprised if she walk away
'Cause somebody else is waiting for you to slip
So they can take your place
You won't know it
It's a perfect disguise
She won't show it
But lips don't lie
It's okay if she show up with a couple Louis bags
That you know you didn't buy
It's okay if you in the bed and her phone rings
In the middle of the night
It's okay if she said she was out with her girls
And you know it's a lie
But if she kissed him
That's your kiss goodbye
Don't let her get away
Don't make her pay for your mistakes
You'll be lying to yourself
If you think she won't be with someone else
If you really want to make it right
Be the only one on her mind
What goes around comes back around
And you don't want to be so
It's okay if she show up with a couple Louis bags
That you know you didn't buy
It's okay if you in the bed and her phone starts a-ringin'
In the middle of the night
It's okay if she said she was out with her girls
And you know it's a lie
But if she kissed him
