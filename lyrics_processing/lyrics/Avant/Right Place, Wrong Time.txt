Every time I see your face
Every time I look in your eyes
(Makes me remember, I still remember)
Taking that flight out west
Touched down in LAX
(It was December, the end of winter)
Stopped at the shopping malls
Just for you I had to ball
Giving you everything
You showed me things that I never knew
And I thank you

Okay, okay, let me clear my mind
(Lotta things going on in my head)
You know the truth, you can never be mine
(Still trip off of all the things that you said)
That you love me (You love me) and you need me (Yes, you do)
I still believe it (but) I must be crazy
God knows that I don't know what I should do
But all that I can say

Right place, wrong time
I'm sitting here stuck in the middle of a masquerade with you
You can't be mine
I'll have to chalk it up but it'll hurt me so much
Whoa, whoa, whoa (Whoa)
Whoa, whoa, whoa (I really want you)
Hey
God knows that I don't know what I should do
(Tell me what should I do)
'Cause I'm still in love with you
You might also like
Traveling from here to there, only so much I can bear
(I wanna see you, but I can't see you)
Knowing this from the start
Didn't really wanna break no hearts
(But my emotions are still taking me over)
Knowing you used to call, constantly my phone was off
And I knew this day would come
You would go and find somebody new
But I'm still in love with you

Right place, wrong time
I'm sitting here stuck in the middle of a masquerade with you
(Stuck right here in the middle)
You can't be mine
I'll have to chalk it up but it'll hurt me so much
Whoa, whoa, whoa (Whoa, whoa, whoa)
Whoa, whoa, whoa (Can somebody help me?)
Hey
God knows that I don't know what I should do
(What should I do?)
'Cause I'm still in love with you

I loved the things that we did together (Hey)
Places we went together
(All of the places that we went together, baby)
Girl, I was down, whatever
When I had time off, we could get that off
But you know I've been working for certain
And I know that hurt you
Someone else is filling my shoes but I'm not mad at you
'Cause I wasn't there, now he's
Taking my place, filling my space
Leaving me with nothing else to say
Right place, wrong time
I'm sitting here stuck in the middle of a masquerade with you
You can't be mine
I'll have to chalk it up but it'll hurt me so much (Ooh)
Whoa, whoa, whoa (Whoa, whoa)
Whoa, whoa, whoa (Whoa, whoa, whoa), hey

You know I can't live without you, girl
Please don't leave me right now, I need you in my life
Oh, oh
Say, say, oh, oh
