I'm the type of guy that needs someone that's all about me
Maybe, baby, you could be that somebody
Don't wanna come across selfish, hah, I can't help it
If I don't tell you, how can I expect you to know my heart?
Do your part, show me what you see exactly what I mean

(Y) Yearn for
(O) Overtaken by
(U) Understand that I'm talkin' 'bout you (You)

All I see (You)
Next to me (You)
Only thing that I need is (You)
I'm at my best when I'm with (You)
Top of my list is (You)
Baby, it's you

That's enough about me, I'm not the only one with needs
Tell me, baby, what it is you desire
So I can fill that position, give you everything that you missin'
If you don't tell me, how can you expect me to know your heart?
Do my part, so don't leave out nothin' if you want my lovin'
You might also like
(Y) You're so givin'
(O) Over and over
(U) Understand that I'm talkin' 'bout (You)

All I see (You)

Only thing that I need is (You)
I'm at my best when I'm with (You)
Top of my list is (You)
Baby, it's you

'Cause there's nothin' out there for me
Trust me, I know, I've looked high, I've looked low
Girl, I swear
Like a symphony, you play all the parts that make me complete
I've found my reason to love unconditionally
I've know for a while it would be, ohh (You)

All I see (You)
Next to me (You)
Only thing that I need is (You)
I'm at my best when I'm with (You)
The top of my list is (You)
Baby, it's you
(You) Ohh
(You) Got me goin' crazy
(You) Oh, baby, you, you, you, ohh
(You) Can't sleep without (You)
I'm gettin' weak without (You)
My baby, life ain't complete without
