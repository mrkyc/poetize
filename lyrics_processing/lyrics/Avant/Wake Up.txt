With my girl beside me feeling naughty
Just watching her lay there
Such a sexy atmosphere
She.. hand on the pillow
Got me feeling to myself
Here we go

I know I should go back to sleep
But I can't help it you have taken it girl
I'm not a.. but I can be if you let me
Touch it, harder..
So many things that I wanna do that involves you
But first I need you
To make love
I know that you feel that
Wake up
I can tell by the way your arching your back and look me like that
Wake up it's early in the morning
But that ain't mean I don't wanna a piece of you
Wake up
When I came with the fellows at 12
.. all day got me tired as hell
But it don't matter cause I wanna get at you
I'm right there behind you thinking my..
I can't believe it
So I'm gonna take this to another level
You might also like
I know you're gonna get up in a minute
But I can't make it girl
I'm not a.. but I can be if you let me
Touch it, harder..
So many things that I wanna do that involves you
But first I need you
To make love
I know that you feel that
Wake up
I can tell by the way your arching your back and look me like that
Wake up it's early in the morning
But that ain't mean I don't wanna a piece of you
Wake up
I got to be on you really on you
Baby touch me
Wake up baby
You don't have to move it girl
I'll make you wanna get into it
Once I'll do it
You will be wide awake

I know you're gonna get up in a minute
But I can't make it girl
I'm not a.. but I can be if you let me
Touch it, harder..
So many things that I wanna do that involves you
But first I need you
To make love
I know that you feel that
Wake up
I can tell by the way your arching your back and look me like that
Wake up it's early in the morning
But that ain't mean I don't wanna a piece of you
