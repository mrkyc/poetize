Wake up, it's morning time! (Time, time, time)

Wake up, singing
In the morning time
I wake up, singing, hallelujah
In the morning time (In the morning time!)
I wake up, singing, hallelujah
In the morning time

I close my eyes, to another trying day
But I thank the Lord, that He made a way
Can't go to sleep, before I kneel and pray
That He clears my soul, take my sins away
So far should I, put my mind away?
It will be with Him, in another place

One more day, sweet breath of life
Joy found down inside!

Wake up, singing, hallelujah
In the morning time (In the morning time!) In the morning time!
I wake up, singing, hallelujah
In the morning time (In the morning time!)
You might also like
Open my eyes, the first thing that I say
"Hallelujah Lord, for another day!"
Sunshine and rain, no matter come with me
Won't you take my hand, so I understand?
A table to feast, plenty of food to eat
For some hungry child, in the world of need

One more day, sweet breath of life
Joy down deep insi-i-ide!
