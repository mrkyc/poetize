If you think there's something wrong
Holes appearing on your lawn
Don't you blame the man next door
It's not him

Flowers walk from place to place
Dark spot moves around your face
Objects vanish without trace
It's not you

I'm the mole from the ministry
And you'll all bow down to me
I'm the mole in your potting shed
I'm the bad thoughts inside your head
And you won't catch me
(Fish and visitors smell in three days)
(Silently rowed to the Charlestown shore
Just as the moon rose over the bay)

If you think there's something strange
Garden starts to rearrange
From perfect lawn to mountain range
It's not you

I'm the mole from the ministry
And you'll all bow down to me
I'm the mole in your potting shed
I'm the bad thoughts inside your head
And you won't catch me

(Ah-ah-ah-ah)
("Creditors have better memories than debtors")
(Ah-ah-ah-ah)
("He who falls in love with himself have no rivals")
(Ah-ah-ah-ah)
("Makes a man healthy wealthy and wise")
(Ah-ah-ah)
I'm the mole from the ministry
And you'll all bow down to me
I'm the mole in your potting shed
I'm the bad thoughts inside your head
And you won't catch me
I'm the mole from the ministry
(We're working underground)
And you'll all bow down to me
(Moving facts and figures all around)
I'm the mole in your potting shed
(Undermine your world)
I'm the bad thoughts inside your head
And you shouldn't think me, no!
And you shouldn't think me
