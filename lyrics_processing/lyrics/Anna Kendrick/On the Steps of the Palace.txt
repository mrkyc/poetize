He's a very smart Prince
He's a Prince who prepares
Knowing this time I'd run from him
He spread pitch on the stairs
And I'm caught unawares
Well, it means that he cares
This is more than just malice
Better stop and take stock
While you're standing here stuck
On the steps of the palace
All right, what do you want?
Have to make a decision
Why not stay and be caught?
Should I give that a thought
What could be his response?
But then what if he knew
Who I am when I know
That I'm not what he thinks
That he wants?
Or, then, what if I am
What a Prince would envision?
But then how can you know
Who you are till you know
What you want, which I don't?
So then which do you pick?
You might also likeWhere you're safe, out of sight
And yourself, but where everything's wrong?
Or where everything's right
But you know that you'll never belong?
And whichever you pick, do it quick
'Cause you're starting to stick
To the steps of the palace
It's my first big decision
The choice isn't easy to make
To arrive at a ball is exciting and all
Once you're there, though, it's scary
And it's fun to deceive
When you know you can leave
But you have to be wary
There's a lot that's at stake
But I've stalled long enough
'Cause I'm still standing stuck
In the stuff on these steps
Better run along home
And avoid the collision
Though at home they don't care
I'll be better off there
Where there's nothing to choose
So there's nothing to lose
So I'll pry up my shoes
Wait, though, thinking it through
Things don't have to collide
I know what my decision is
Which is not to decide
I'll just leave him a clue
For example, a shoe
And then see what he'll do
Now it's he and not you
Who'll be stuck with a shoe
In a stew, in the goo
And I've learned something, too
Something I never knew
