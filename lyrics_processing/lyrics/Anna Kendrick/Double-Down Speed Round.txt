In the speed round
Got a holiday you're gonna
Like better stick around
Well my favorite's a "Big Hug Ball Day"
That's a big ball of hugs
Or "Shock A Friend Day"
Rub your feet on the rug
And touch everyone you love
Well, there's a very special day
We call an "equinox"
It's a great opportunity
To celebrate socks
Socks socks socks so-so-Socks!
Come on!
Tear Away Pants Day
Feel the breeze on your hips
Hear the sound a Velcro
Going rip rip rip
Good Luck Troll Day
Put a gem on your stomach
And you spit a little charm
Let a friend belly rub it
Rub rub rub rub rub rub...
Everyone will be so jelly
When they see you on the telly
With their shiny big jewels
Sticking right out your belly
Body round
Music loud
Swarming with the top down
Body round
Music loud
Swarming with the top down
Come on!
Come on!
On Express Yourself Day
Give your opinion a shout
Keep It To Yourself Day
Where you shut your mouth
There's a rockin' holiday
Filled up with lots of drama
Get you jumpin' all around
Lemme call it "Mosh-sha-sha-na"
Shoot a flare in the air
Like you just don't care
'Cause it's "Fireworks Day"
In the village square
There's "Bleeping Sound Day"
Where you only speak in bleeps
You could say anything like:
If you want a tattoo
But you're having doubts
There's "Random Tattoo Day"
Which is not thought out
Smacksgiving Day is a day we embrace
Especially when someone
Gets slapped in the face
A big holiday that's a bundle of fun
It's Fuzzy Wuzzy Day so go put one on
It's so wuzzy and it's fuzzy
And it's cute and ugly fugly
And we know you're gonna love it
When you're feeling super snuggly
Body round
Music loud
Swarming with the top down
Body round
Music loud
Swarming with the top down
Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
Let a friend belly rub
Come on!
Body round
Music loud
Swarming with the top down
Body round
Music loud
Swarming with the top down
Come on!
