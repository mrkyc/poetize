Here's a story, started on the first day
On the first day, there was darkness all around
Till the boss man shout 'let there be sunshine'
Yes the big man said let that light shine down

Is there more? (Good God a woman) Almost done!
Is there more? (Good God a woman) Almost done!
Is there more? (Good God a woman) Almost done!

On the next day, he built the endless skyway
And on the same day, he made the oceans blue
Then the big man decided he'd make dry ground
And on the third day, the trees and flowers he grew

Is there more? (Good God a woman) Almost done!
Is there more? (Good God a woman) Almost done!
Is there more? (Good God a woman) Almost done!

It took two days to make the stars and moon shine
Bright wing birds and all the fishes too
It was hard work to fill the skies and the oceans
By the sixth day, I figured he was through

Is there more? (Good God a woman) Almost done!
Is there more? (Good God a woman) Almost done!

That's when the big man made the little man
And all the animals, but he'd save the best for the last
'Cause the boss man knew the little man would be lonesome
So he robbed one rib bone and he worked while the little man asked

Is there more? (Good God a woman) Almost done!
Is there more? (Good God a woman) Almost done!
Is there more? (Good God a woman) Almost done!

And on the last day, the boss was mighty tired
As he looked around up and down the line
But a big smile spread across his broad face
When he saw a woman and he saw that it was fine

Is there more? (Good God a woman) Almost done!
Is there more? (Good God a woman) Almost done!
