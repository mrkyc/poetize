Sometimes is it better to let go?

This shit's getting crazy, tired of your playing
Am I better off alone?
These lies are heavy, someone's gon' regret it
But I'm still waiting, backed against the wall

Every battle has a widow
The mourner won't be me
Even though I know I'm dumb
But my heart still loves a fight
I ain't going nowhere

Tell me, are you ready for me yet?
You got me in the palm of your hands
Tell me, are you ready yet?
You decide with your heart not your head
Tell me, are you ready for me yet?
I know you can make her understand
Tell me, are you ever gonna be a one woman man?

Foolish and accepted, no doubt unintended
Even though I know you're wrong
Two women committed, stupidly admitted
It's time you end it and just let her know
You might also like
Every battle has a widow
The mourner won't be me
Even though I know I'm dumb
But my heart still loves a fight
I ain't going nowhere

Tell me, are you ready for me yet?
You got me in the palm of your hands
Tell me, are you ready yet?
You decide with your heart not your head
Tell me, are you ready for me yet?
I know you can make her understand
Tell me, are you ever gonna be a one woman man?

Soaked with rotten beliefs
Floating in loveless seas
Hitting like crashing waves
Tell her that it's too late
'Cause I'm never walking away
My love is here to stay, ah ah ah
Didn't she hear me say
I ain't going nowhere
Tell me, are you ready for me yet?
You got me in the palm of your hands
Tell me, are you ready yet?
You decide with your heart not your head
Tell me, are you ready for me yet?
I know you can make her understand
Tell me, are you ever gonna be a one woman man?
Tell me, are you ready for me yet?
You got me in the palm of your hands
Tell me, are you ready yet?
You decide with your heart not your head
Tell me, are you ready for me yet?
I know you can make her understand
Tell me, are you ever gonna be a one woman man?
