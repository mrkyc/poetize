My broken mistakes unfold ungraciously
My senses they soak
I know it'll lead you to my soul

Daylight breeze against the warmth of summer
Got me back to my morning lover
These feelings are like no other
Take me back we could last forever

Yeah, I'm on my knees, I pray
Our hearts won't be forsaken
Each footprint I will trace it
As I protect our love
I'll love you through all seasons
I'll love you all my lifetime
I'll cherish you with meaning
And I keep you warm in the night

So if you want it, you got it
I will be ready for ya
Yeah, if you want it, you got it
I will be right here for ya
So if you want it, you got it
I will be ready for ya
Yeah, if you want it, you got it
I will be right here for ya

Bad choices, they stain
And open a change in me
They fall and they break
I know you're waiting for my call
