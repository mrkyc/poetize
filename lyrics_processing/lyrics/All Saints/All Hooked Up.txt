Come on, come on
(Say what, say what)
Yo yo, there she go
Go girl with your fine ass

You keep askin' for my time
You keep tellin' me that I'm fine
Give me your number, I won't call
Give me your pager too
Not at all will I call, not at all

I know that you want a piece of my ass
Don't you know that a guy like you wouldn't last?

Not a player, don't get paid (Don't get played)
I'll leave you hangin' for days  (I'll leave you hangin' for days)
Don't send me flowers, they won't do (Won't, won't)
Don't give me diamond rings
'Cause I'll take them and call you a fool

Come on, why you do me like that? (Call you a fool)
Can't you see that I wanna feel that? (Call you a fool)
Come on, why you do me like that?
Can't you see that a brother all that?
