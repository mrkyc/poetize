Later on you'll be tellin' me stories
Can you really tell me where you're coming from?
I've seen your phone bill, who you been callin'?
Don't try to fool me baby when I ask what's up
Cause boy you know me I'm too good, I know you're being phoney
Don't say another word before I mess you up
Oh now
Tell me who's that bitch I see climbing out your window
Oh, hell, no

Oh, hell, no
Say it to my face, why hesitate, wanna know
Oh, oh, oh

New clothes you were never this trendy
Could never get you shopping now you shop to drop

Try'na tell me lies but you be trippin' up you see ya
