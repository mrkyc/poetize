Never stop giving good love
'Cause that's what I call you for (Yeah, what's up, baby?)
Never stop, baby, give it up
'Cause I know where it came from, you got more (That's right)
I like playing games and if it's all the same
You can bring it on with the rough stuff
Then give me your love, I don't wanna be tamed

I need a man to be a real man
In order of what I got in store
Always finish what you start, baby
And always havin' me beg for more
You know I wanna be diggy-down, boy
But I don't get around
Jimmy has to ride in your pocket or lock him in your wallet
It's just a booty call

I'm keen on new ideas, baby
And names are always good to have
You never let me down
I'm always happy when you make me laugh
But don't try to find this heart of mine
Emotions don't come into my head, so don't be mislead
My heart doesn't need to be fed

Only tryin' to be smart, baby
Don't need the roller-coaster ride
I've been and seen and done it all, yeah, yeah
Don't want you messing with my mind
So don't be a fool
Keep this as your number one rule
(Good loving's not always from the heart)
(You gotta be smart, haha)
Stay just the way you are

It's a booty, it's a booty call
It's a booty call, it's a booty call
It's a booty, it's a booty call
