Got me lying awake
I haven't eaten all week
Got me obsessing all day
Oh, what you done to me
Can't stop calling your name
Check me, I'm acting all weird
All my girls say, boy, I'm totally gone
Acting crazy I don't know what I'm on
It's not easy tryin'a put on a front
Baby, I'm speechless, I don't know what you've done
Boy, whenever you call, my stomach's in bits
I can't focus at all, you got me twisted
I live for that talk when you call me your chick
Just so all the girls know I gotcha for keeps
My coolness is blown I need my fix
In a matter of days I'm not myself
I'm all over the place, I get a chick fit
When I hear your name, I totally flip
Boy, you're too hot for me
Can't stop melting away
When I see you I can't speak
Switching when I see your face
Acting like I'm a teen
Waiting outside your place
Boy, this is really not me

Completely lost my mind
Something's taken over me
Boy, you're one of a kind
Just how a man's s'posed to be
Acting like I'm a teen
Calling you every day
