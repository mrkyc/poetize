You weren't holy, that face
Written in the bad books, trouble all the way
Just like a fighter
Me, same story, same page
I was a ladder searching for fame
Together we burned brighter

Looking for a battle ready for the pain
Knew it was a challenge, everything's a game
Seemed easy, seemed so easy

If I gotta fight for the right
To be loved and to love
Then this is a war
If we can't be free, you and me
To be loved and to love
Then what is this for
<
If this is a war

You wasn't perfect thought that it was cool
You were my bad boy straight out of the hood
Yeah, it was all good
You a little tragic, me a little bold
Dangerous, ecstatic, we couldn't be told
Together we weren't alone
You might also like
Looking for a battle ready for the pain
Knew it was a challenge, everything's a game
Seemed easy, seemed so easy

If I gotta fight for the right
To be loved and to love
Then this is a war
If we can't be free, you and me
To be loved and to love
Then what is this for
If this is a war

Will the words ever make a change
We've come too far to turn back now
Stronger together, we are one
One world a million miles away
Two hearts, one life, one you and I

If I gotta fight for the right
To be loved and to love
Then this is a war
(Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me)
If we can't be free, you and me
To be loved and to love
Then what is this for
If this is a war
War
If this is a war
(Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me)
If this is a war

You weren't holy, that face
Written in the bad books, trouble all the way
Just like a fighter
Me, same story, same page
I was a ladder searching for fame
