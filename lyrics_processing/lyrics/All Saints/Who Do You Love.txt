My Mother once said to me
There are two kinds of men you'll meet
The first will give you the life you want
And the second will give you the love you desire
If one of the lucky few you will find both in the one person
But if you ever find having to choose between the two
Then always choose love

Say it in a whisper
Shout it loud
There won't be a winner
Press and linger
Sweet to my mouth
It'll soon taste bitter

I won't speak
I won't breathe
I just choose me when we go down

Who do you love?
Why can't I be all you need?
Will I be the one you leave?
Who do you love?
Why can't I just make you see?
I wanna know if it's gonna be me
Who do you love?
You might also like
Tilt that halo
Cross the line
To meet in the middle
Break an arrow
Shoot me down
I'm hurt just a little

I won't speak
I won't breath
I just choose me when we go down

Who do you love?
Why can't I be all you need?
Tell me if the ship goes down
Will I be the one you leave?
Who do you love?
Why can't I just make you see?
Tell me if the ship goes down
I wanna know if it's gonna be me
Who do you love?

I won't speak
I won't breathe
I just choose me when we go down
Who do you love?
Why can't I be all you need?
Tell me if the ship goes down
Will I be the one you leave?
Who do you love?
Why can't I just make you see?
Tell me if the ship goes down
I wanna know if it's gonna be me
Who do you love?
I won't speak
I won't breathe
I just choose me when we go down
Will I be the one you leave?
I won't speak
I won't breath
I just choose me when we go down

I wanna know if it's gonna be me
I wanna know if it's gonna be me
Who do you love?
I wanna know if it's gonna be me
Who do you love?
