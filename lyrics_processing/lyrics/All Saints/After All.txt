We had that first love
Heartbreak, romance, way back
When our hearts ruled, we knew it all
Forever's now in the past

I remember just you and me
When each other was all we needed
I remember what could have been
We were just too young to see it

There was something 'bout the way
There was something 'bout the way
You used to love
You used to love
There was something 'bout the way
There was something 'bout the way
You used to love
You used to love

Questions with answers
Who knows if we missed our chance (Our chances, our chances)
If we had waited
Would it change our circumstance? (In the right place, at the right time, would it be right?)
