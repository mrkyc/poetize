Ratchet behaviour

When I catch you smiling away you were making a fool of me
You had that knife in that back of the wife of the man that was cool and gave you a squeeze
Took a woman's kindness misunderstood and thought that it made me weak
I'm gon' break it down to you girl, female to female, right now take it to the streets

You don't really really wanna catch a bad one
'Cause I'm just here with my girls trying to have fun
It's random
Why you come at me on a mad one
So now I got flipped like a Samsung

That ratchet behaviour
Make you think it was cool messing with my love

Don't you realize I smell your lies every time that you walk my way
I'm a woman I know when a girl shows up and she wants to play
I can see in your eyes what you want and no need to deny, don't speak

'Cause up against me none of that gon' save ya (blah)
Scannin' me like a barcode

Couple girls want and I ain't heard of dem
Foxy Brown on the Glock, murda dem
