I just want it
Get a little sip on it
Fine dine on it
I will do whatever you say
Can't go a minute
It's good 'cause I've been here
Oh, don't let me down
Why? 'Cause I'm here for ya

What's it gonna be?
What's it gonna be?

Hey!
Tell me what I gotta do for ya, babe
Hey!
Tell me what I gotta do for ya, babe
You could fool me 'bout a hundred times but I'm still here for ya
You can break me down, turn me up, yet I'm still here for ya

Get a little deep on it
Right down on it
I just wanna make your day
All up in it
Taste good, don't it?
I won't let you down
Why? 'Cause I'm here for ya

What's it gonna be?

When you're all alone
That's when you want my love
When you're all alone

That's when you want my love
