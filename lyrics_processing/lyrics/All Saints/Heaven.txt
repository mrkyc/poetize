Lift me up, take me high
Take me higher than I've been before
I need time, time to find
The road to my destiny
Heaven, help me
On a cloud to happiness is where I wanna be
Stealin' my mind, I'm runnin' outta time
So, Heaven, lift me up

Scared to laugh, scared to cry
For fear of my own contradiction
Maybe I should try and cover my real reasons
For God sakes, Heaven, lift me up

Wasn't supposed to be this way
Got too much of my own say
Never thought that I'd be standin'

At the gates of Heaven
At the gates of Heaven
Heaven, lift me up
You might also like
Come on and lift me
Lift me up
Ooh, woah, yeah

Take me high, above the clouds where the birds fly
I'm feeling free, let Heaven do the work for me
Lookin' over this crazy city where we're livin'
I've seen it, done it, it's just the way I've been

Wasn't supposed to be this way
Got too much of my own say
Never thought that I'd be standin'

At the gates of Heaven
At the gates of Heaven
Heaven, lift me up

Come on and lift me
Lift me up
Ooh, woah, yeah
Take it, move it, feel like it's yours
Hoping you'll find what you're looking for
Baby, baby
What you lookin' for?
Take it, move it, feel like it's yours
Hoping you'll find what you're looking for
Baby, baby
What you lookin' for?

I won't fail (I won't fail)
I won't break (I won't break)
No way (No way), no

At the gates of Heaven (Never thought that I'd be standing)
At the gates of Heaven (At the gates of Heaven)
At the gates of Heaven
At the gates of Heaven (At the gates of Heaven)
At the gates of Heaven (Never thought that I'd be standing)
At the gates of Heaven (Heaven, lift me up)
Heaven, lift me up

Take it, move it, feel like it's yours
Hoping you'll find what you're looking for
Baby, baby (At the gates of Heaven)
What you lookin' for?
Take it, move it, feel like it's yours
Hoping you'll find what you're looking for
Baby, baby (Heaven, lift me up)
What you lookin' for?
Take it, move it, feel like it's yours (Never thought that I'd be standing)
Hoping you'll find what you're looking for
Baby, baby
