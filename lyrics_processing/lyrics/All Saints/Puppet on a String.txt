Like a puppet on a string, I return
My elastic keeps retracting, I just won't learn

I just can't let go
I just can't let go
I just can't let go
I just can't let, let, let

Every time I say I'm gonna let go
I keep runnin' on back, baby runnin' on back to you
Even when I'm headin' out the back door
I keep runnin' on back, baby runnin' on back to you
I keep runnin' on back, baby runnin' on back to you

Warning signs flash in my head, won't hold me back
You're a hazard on a good day, but I still want that

I just can't let go
I just can't let go
I just can't let go
I just can't let, let, let

Every time I say I'm gonna let go
I keep runnin' on back, baby runnin' on back to you
Even when I'm headin' out the back door
I keep runnin' on back, baby runnin' on back to you
I keep runnin' on back, baby runnin' on back to you

You call and I come running
Like the wind in a storm I'll blow right into you
Come back like I'm a boomerang
Let me go and I'll retract
You call and I come running
Like the wind in a storm I'll blow right into you
Come back like I'm a boomerang
Let me go and I'll retract (to you)

Every time I say I'm gonna let go
I keep runnin' on back, baby runnin' on back to you
Even when I'm headin' out the back door
I keep runnin' on back, baby runnin' on back to you
I keep runnin' on back, baby runnin' on back to you

Runnin', runnin'
I keep runnin', runnin'
I keep runnin' on back, baby runnin' on back to you
