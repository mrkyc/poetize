Love Is love
Love is love

Something just crept upon me
As you lay next to me this morning
As you looked up into my eyes
Suddenly I realised
What I've been searching for
I no longer have to look no more
A chance to find my soulmate of man
Has released the woman I am

It's a feeling no-one can describe (No-one can describe)
But I know the feeling's here tonight (Is here tonight)
Desire tingles me to my very soul (My, my very soul)
All my demons, all my fears, I'm letting go (I'm letting go)

Love is love, you can't buy love
It's a gift, not an obligation
It cannot lead you to temptation
Love is love, not a game
And should always remain so
Love is love, you can't buy love
It's a gift, not an obligation
It cannot lead you to temptation
Love is love, not a game
And should always remain so

Love is not hurting or pains
Love is never hurt or afraid
It's the little things we do
And at times they come from you
Laughter, anger, tears or joy
It's still love when we annoy
Me and you, we fit just like a glove
Ah, love is love

It's a feeling I can't comprehend (No I, no I)
But I know to keep it I intend (to keep it I intend)
Desire tingles me to my very soul (my, my very soul)
All my demons, all my fears, I'm letting go (my demons, all my fears, I'm letting go)

Love is love, you can't buy love
It's a gift, not an obligation
It cannot lead you to temptation
Love is love, not a game
And should always remain so
Love is love, you can't buy love
It's a gift, not an obligation
It cannot lead you to temptation
Love is love, not a game
And should always remain so
Love is Love (Love is, love is, love is love)
Love is Love (Is love, is love)
Love is Love (Love is, love is love)
Love (Love is love)

Love is love, you can't buy love
It's a gift, not an obligation
It cannot lead you to temptation
Love is love, not a game
And should always remain so
Love is love, you can't buy love
It's a gift, not an obligation
It cannot lead you to temptation
Love is love, not a game
And should always remain so

Love is Love (Love is love)
Love is Love

Love is love, you can't buy love
It's a gift, not an obligation

It cannot lead you to temptation
Love is love, not a game
And should always remain so
