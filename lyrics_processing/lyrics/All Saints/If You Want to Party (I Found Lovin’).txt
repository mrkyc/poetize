Still kickin' it live with the main man John
Saints in the house, yeah we doin' it right
A cool rockin' jam, and party all night
So let's get started baby, you and I
Go on with your bad self, dance all night
So can you feel it, I can feel it hey
Can you feel the beat, feel the bass drum
Doing in your feet, hear the snare drum
Tappin' in your ear, yeah, you gotta get up
Gotta move your rear

That's the way this heart is a-feelin' for you
'Cause no one does it better
Boy, there ain't no doubt just what I wanna do
So won't you let me sweat, yeah

Check it, check it, check it out to the break of, break of dawn
As the bass drums stick it to your ear
Can you hear, move your rear
Wind your body to the beautiful snare
Guys grab a girl and take it from the back
And give it up, give it up 'cause we like it like that
Or girls grab a guy, chillin' that you ain't feelin' shy
Keep it goin' as the bridge comes back in time
