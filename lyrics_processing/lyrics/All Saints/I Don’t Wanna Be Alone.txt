('Cause I don't wanna be alone, no)
I don't wanna be alone

I don't wanna be alone, wanna be alone
Call my number when you get home
Don't wanna be alone, no, no, no
Talking to myself from dusk til dawn
In my fantasies, you and me
I can just imagine how it's gotta be
But getting hot alone ain't no fun
So I don't wanna be alone

I'll do Voodoo, kinda spook you
Withdrawal symptoms in the afternoon
I get head pains, got swelled veins
Every night with you is never the same
Every minute I intend to pretend that you love me
And I miss you more more
We'll hang out, get your clothes
Leave the phone and come over
('Cause I don't wanna be alone, no)
(I don't wanna be alone)
You might also like
I don't wanna be alone, wanna be alone
Call my number when you get home
Don't wanna be alone, no, no, no
Talking to myself from dusk til dawn
In my fantasies, you and me
I can just imagine how it's gotta be
But getting hot alone ain't no fun
So I don't wanna be alone

At night do you think that I'm haunting you
When you sleep do you think of the things I do
Do you think that you can commit to my constant demands
(Constant demands for it)
Tell your friend that it ain't no sin
If he feels to join in
You and me, me and you and him
Or hang out get your clothes
Leave the phone and come over
Come over
Come over

(Midnight)
It's midnight, midnight
(Call you)
Calling, calling you
For your love
Your love, your love
(Midnight)
It's midnight, midnight
(Call you)
Calling, calling you
Cause I'm hungry for your love
('Cause I don't wanna be alone, no)
I don't wanna be alone
I don't wanna be alone, wanna be alone
Call my number when you get home
Don't wanna be alone, no, no, no
Talking to myself from dusk til dawn
In my fantasies, you and me
I can just imagine how it's gotta be
But getting hot alone ain't no fun
So I don't wanna be alone

I'll do Voodoo, kinda spooks you
(I don't wanna be alone)
I get head pains, got swelled veins
(I don't wanna be alone)
Every night I intend to pretend that you love me
(I don't wanna be alone)
We'll hang out, get your clothes
Leave the phone and come over
'Cause I don't wanna be alone, no

I don't wanna be alone, wanna be alone
Call my number when you get home
Don't wanna be alone, no, no, no
Talking to myself from dusk til dawn
In my fantasies, you and me
I can just imagine how it's gotta be
But getting hot alone ain't no fun
So I don't wanna be alone
(Midnight)
(Call you)
(Hungry)
('Cause I don't wanna be alone, no)
I don't wanna be alone
