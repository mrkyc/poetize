You say we're really gone
And let's wait for the night to come
Just stay until the dawn
'Cause I don't wanna be alone

Nowhere to go yet so we can survive it
No need to pretend 'cause we both need somebody
Nowhere to go yet so we can survive it
No need to pretend 'cause we both need somebody

Yeah, so we can be honest
We don't play by the rules
There's no need to be lonely
Baby, we got no issues
Me and you, we ain't going nowhere
Me and you, we ain't going nowhere
We got no issues
Me and you, we ain't going nowhere
Me and you, we ain't going nowhere
We got no issues

Let's drink until the sun
Act like we're the only ones
Don't leave until the morning
'Cause I don't wanna be alone
