Home, oh
Ooh, ah

Sitting on my own
A long way from home
It's a distance from you
And I'm thinking about you too
Sitting on my own
A long way from home
It's a distance from you
And I'm thinking about you too

On the other side of the world
Alone without my girls
If time was on my side
I'd take a plane and fly
Spoke to you on the phone
I hope you're all alone
If I had things my way
But I can't so let me say

Sitting on my own (own)
A long way from home (home)
It's a distance from you
And I'm thinking about you too
Sitting on my own (own)
A long way from home (home)
It's a distance from you
And I'm thinking about you too
You might also like
Seems like it's been so long
Can't remember where I'm from
My mission never ends
I've even made new friends (Friends)
I know you're missing me
That's the way it's got to be
If I could come home for one more day
But I can't so let me say

At this time I cannot feel you, I cannot see
They don't know I'm taken
I'm mistaken as being free
And I'll never know if your heart is with another boo
It's a distance from you
It's a distance from you, you

Sitting on my own (own)
A long way from home (home)
It's a distance from you
And I'm thinking about you too
Sitting on my own (own)
A long way from home (home)
It's a distance from you
And I'm thinking about you too
It's a dis- it's a distance
It's a distance from you

At this time I cannot feel you, I cannot see
They don't know I'm taken
I'm mistaken as being free
And I'll never know if your heart is with another boo
It's a distance from you
It's a distance from you, you

Sitting on my own (own)
A long way from home (home)
It's a distance from you (I'm all alone)
And I'm thinking about you too (you)
Sitting on my own (own)
A long way from home (home)
It's a distance from you
And I'm thinking about you too
Sitting on my own (own)
A long way from home (home)
It's a distance from you
And I'm thinking about you too (you)
Sitting on my own (own)
A long way from home (home)
It's a distance from you
And I'm thinking about you too
I'm thinking about you
It's a distance from you
It's a distance from you
It's a distance from you
And I'm thinking about you too
It's a distance from you
It's a distance from you
It's a distance from you
It's a distance from you
It's a distance from you
It's a distance from you (From you)
It's a dis - ahh
And I'm thinking about you too
