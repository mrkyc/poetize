Through the rain to a new dawn, a new day
Tears have gone out to sea and washed away
Through it all I am standin' mighty tall
Clear to see as I watch you fade to grey

Meet me down by the water, baby
I'll be layin' by the apple tree
I take a bite but I won't falter
The road to redemption is long and lonely
You were strong but I'm a fighter
My strength won't let me down
I roll on down the river to the ocean
A testament in motion

I'll get up, I'll get up, I'll get up now
I'll get up, I'll get up, I'll get up, baby
I'll get up, I'll get up, I'll get up now
I'm gettin' up, gettin' up, up, up

Through the rain to a new dawn, a new day
Tears have gone out to sea and washed away
Through it all I am standin' mighty tall
Clear to see as I watch you fade to grey
You might also like
I'll be gone by the morning, baby
You keep talkin' as you watch me leave
I give a smile as you crumble
The space in your bed will be cold and lonely
Did me wrong, so I'll retire
You can't keep me down
I rolled on down the river to the ocean
A testament in motion

I'll get up, I'll get up, I'll get up now
I'll get up, I'll get up, I'll get up, baby
I'll get up, I'll get up, I'll get up now
I'm gettin' up, gettin' up, up, up

Through the rain to a new dawn, a new day
Tears have gone out to sea and washed away
Through it all I am standin' mighty tall
Clear to see as I watch you fade to grey

You thought that I wouldn't survive
Down on my knees, I'll be cryin'
No, boy, not me, not I
I was born to be brave, I was born to recover
You thought I couldn't be revived
Down on my knees, I'd be dyin'
No, boy, not me, not I
I was born to be brave, I was born to recover
Through the rain to a new dawn, a new day
Tears have gone out to sea and washed away
Through it all I am standin' mighty tall
Clear to see as I watch you fade to grey
(I watch you fade to grey)
Through the rain to a new dawn, a new day
Tears have gone out to sea and washed away
(Out to sea, washed away)
Through it all I am standin' mighty tall
Clear to see as I watch you fade to grey
(I watch you fade to grey)
Through the rain to a new dawn, a new day
Tears have gone out to sea and washed away
Through it all I am standin' mighty tall
