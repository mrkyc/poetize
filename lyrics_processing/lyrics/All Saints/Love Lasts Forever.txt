I won't doubt, I won't break
Pass this by or fade away
Take your time, seize the day
I don't mind, I can wait

So when you're ready you just gotta let me know
And when the time is right I'm gonna show you
When we find it we will never let go
'Cause love lasts forever
So when you're ready you just gotta let me know
And when the time is right I'm gonna show you
When we find it we will never let go
'Cause love lasts forever

I'm behind to catch your fall
Take this time to get things wrong
We'll be fine, you'll be great
I don't mind, I can wait

So when you're ready you just gotta let me know
And when the time is right I'm gonna show you
When we find it we will never let go
'Cause love lasts forever
So when you're ready you just gotta let me know
And when the time is right I'm gonna show you
When we find it we will never let go
'Cause love lasts forever
