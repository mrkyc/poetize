Years on the run, boy, I know I can take it
And now that I'm here I know you can't stand the waiting, boy
Let's say, "No more games, no messing with the mind"
Always room for change, let's give it one more try (Come on, let's give it a try)

I got my bags packed, baby, and I'm ready to go
Look at my eyes rock steady and I promise you more
I got my heart back, baby, and it's skipping a beat
I got my ass in check, checkin' out, I'm ready to be

If you're good to go, I'm right here for the taking (Ooh take it, take it, take it)
Don't cross the line, I'll promise you no fakin', boy (No, no, no, no)
It's all understood (Stood), no messing with the rules (The rules, the rules)
If I let you go, boy I will be a fool (What kind of girl wants to be a fool?)

I got my bags packed, baby, and I'm ready to go
Look at my eyes rock steady and I promise you more
I got my heart back, baby, and it's skipping a beat
I got my ass in check, checkin' out, I'm ready to be

Tell me why we act so stupid with games we're playing? (Woo)
Life is so cool when we're heading towards the same thing
You and I work best with love instead of the fighting (Woo)
Let's get together, forever with no more hiding
