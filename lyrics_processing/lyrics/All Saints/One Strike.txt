Stone cold
You wake me when the phone vibrates
Your voice sounds dulled, but loud enough to hear you
Distant, echoes of my heart unbreak

Silently now, I'm waiting for this storm to come
I'm waiting for this storm to come
Listen to you load that gun
I'm waiting for this storm to come

And with one strike
My world lights up in a fire
Call it a sign
Don't need hindsight
I'll make my emotions clear
And then disappear
With one strike
Mmm, one strike

Shattered, pieces of your words take aim
Your poisoned tongue
But I don't want to believe you
Torn up, stitches of my own heart ache
You might also like
Violently numb, I'm ready for  this storm to come
I'm ready for the storm to come
Listen to you load that gun
I'm ready for the storm come

And with one strike
My world lights up in a fire
Call it a sign
Don't need hindsight
I'll make my emotions clear
And then disappear
And with one strike
My world lights up a fire
Call it a sign
And with one strike
Mmm, one strike

With one strike
With one strike
One strike
With one strike
With one strike
I don't want to stay, time to go
I don't want to be in this home
Broken promises, time to leave
I had everything that you needed
I don't want to stay, time to go (Oh-oh)
Why'd you go lie?
Oh-oh
I don't want to be in this home (Oh-oh)
Why'd you go lie?
Oh-oh
Broken promises, time to leave (Oh-oh)
Why'd you go lie?
Oh-oh
I had everything that you needed (Oh-oh)
Why'd you go lie?
Oh-oh

And with one strike
My world lights up in a fire
Call it a sign
Don't need hindsight
I'll make my emotions clear
And then disappear
And with one strike
Mmm, one strike
Oh-oh
Why'd you go lie?
Oh-oh
Why, oh, why?
Oh-oh
Watch you go by
Oh-oh
