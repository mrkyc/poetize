Ha ha, ha ha
Laugh out loud
Ha ha, ha ha ha
Laugh out loud

The day I left my mother and my father and my sister
Looking for a job to pay the rent and buy my dinner
Found it so boring
You see my life revolved around a long-term lover
Music was his name, had no time for any other interests
This was my whole life

You can't sing
If you want to make a living
Stop dreaming
As a little girl
I would listen to them say
I just kept smiling, oh, help me sing it now

1-2, what's a girl to do, I said
3-4, I'm gonna laugh some more, come on
5-6, I'm getting a stitch
You never know you'll never ever break me, baby
1-2, what's a girl to do, I said
3-4, I'm gonna laugh some more, come on
5-6, I'm a getting a stitch
You never know you'll never ever break me, baby

Now times have changed, I find myself involved with another
Stroker tryna beat the game without going under
Slowly
Yet I'm still going
I can't believe the way some people want to stop lovers
Trying to take away your sense of pride must be fulfilling
If you got no feelings

You can't sing
(I thought I already told your ass)
Stop dreaming
(Now get yourself back into class)
Can't you see whatever you are trying to achieve
It won't change nothing

1-2, what's a girl to do, I said
3-4, I'm gonna laugh some more, come on
5-6, I'm getting a stitch
You never know you'll never ever break me, baby
1-2, what's a girl to do, I said
3-4, I'm gonna laugh some more, come on
5-6, I'm getting a stitch
You never know you'll never ever break me, baby
As I laugh, ha ha, you can kiss my ass
You guys thought I live a none existent life (That's right)
You thought I might not make it on my own
Got my own car go-car own my own home
Gotta get it back to living my dreams
Roles and ambitions I have to achieve
Try to do me you can't pull me down
So prove you wrong (Wrong)
Sing my song (Song)
When you pass I'll do a laugh

Try bring me down (Just got to laugh a little louder, baby)
I just laugh out loud (Just got to laugh a little harder, honey)
You're still on the ground (You're still underground)
As I laugh out loud (Can you hear me)

1-2, what's a girl to do, I said
3-4, I'm gonna laugh some more, come on
5-6, I'm getting a stitch
You never know you never ever break me, baby
1-2, what's a girl to do, I said
3-4, I'm gonna laugh some more, come on
5-6, I'm getting a stitch
You never know you'll never ever break me baby
Ooh-ooh-ooh (Ha ha, as I laugh, ha ha)
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Oh, it's so funny laughing now (Ha ha, as I laugh, ha ha)
Laughing now
Ooh-ooh-ooh (Ha ha, as I laugh, ha ha)
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Can you hear me laughing now
Laugh fools now (Ha ha, as I laugh, ha ha)
