Here I go again, got a broken heart
This time I'll get stronger
No grieving 'til the break of dawn
Ain't falling easily no longer

Dreams I dream will at last come true
Skies will clear, leaving me bright and blue
I will raise my glass to my heart and say
Here's to tomorrow, not yesterday

Here's not to dreams that don't come true
Here's not to what was me and you
Here's not to all the days gone by
And to the truth that lived a lie

Dreams I dream will at last come true
Skies will clear, leaving me bright and blue
I will raise my glass to my heart and say
Here's to tomorrow, not yesterday
Dreams I dream will at last come true
Skies will clear, leaving me bright and blue
I will raise my glass to my heart and say
Here's to tomorrow, not yesterday

Dreams I dream will at last come true
Skies will clear, leaving me bright and blue
I will raise my glass to my heart and say
Here's to tomorrow

My words are a whisper, in silence I shout
No Hallmark card can spell it out
Deep down inside you know I care
There's nothing to say 'bout the love we shared

Dreams I dream will at last come true
Skies will clear, leaving me bright and blue
I will raise my glass to my heart and say
Here's to tomorrow, not yesterday
Dreams I dream will at last come true
Skies will clear, leaving me bright and blue
I will raise my glass to my heart and say
Here's to tomorrow, not yesterday
Dreams I dream will at last come true
Skies will clear, leaving me bright and blue
I will raise my glass to my heart and say
