Sometimes, I feel like I don't have a partner
Sometimes, I feel like my only friend
Is the city I live in, the city of cities
As lonely as I am, together we cry, we cry, we cry

I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day
Take me to the place I love, take me all the way
I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day
Take me to the place I love, take me all the way

I drive on the streets 'cause he's my companion
I walk through his fields 'cause he knows who I am
He sees my good deeds and he kisses me windy
I never worry, now that is a lie

I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day
Take me to the place I love, take me all the way
I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day
Take me to the place I love, take me all the way

It's hard to believe there's nobody out there
It's hard to believe that I'm all alone
At least I have his love, the city, he loves me
Lonely as I am, together we cry
You might also like
I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day
Take me to the place I love, take me all the way
I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day
Take me to the place I love, take me all the way
I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day
Take me to the place I love, take me all the way
I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day
Take me to the place I love, take me all the way

All the way
All the way
All the way
All the way
All the way
