They say true love can't be broken
Nothing's too strong for this girl
Sometimes I feel like a woman
Ready to take on the world
If only we both could see it
Vision that comes with a plan
We could be great if we're willin'
One day we'll both understand

If I could give you some faith
If I could give you my love
If I could give you the world
I would
If I could give you some faith
If I could give you my love
If I could give you the world
I would

I'd trade a wish for your freedom
Release all your treats from my hand
Whatever it takes I can be it
Won't draw a line in the sand
Open your eyes and you'll see it
The vision that comes with a plan
We will be great when we're willin'
That's when we'll both understand
You might also like
If I could give you some faith
If I could give you my love
If I could give you the world
I would
If I could give you some faith
If I could give you my love
If I could give you the world
I would

Face to face, give you space, rectify it
Keep the faith, baby there's no denying
Speak the truth, scared to lose or justify this
How am I gonna prove it?
If I can't show what I should feel
Like you need me, we can't be real
I won't be fake, we should be love
Is it too hard? Is it not enough?
I can testify, we multiply
And keep the peace or just divide
So how am I gonna prove it?

If I could give you some faith
If I could give you my love
If I could give you the world
I would
If I could give you some faith
If I could give you my love
If I could give you the world
