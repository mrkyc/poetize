Beg
Ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha, beg
(Ladies and gentlemen, put your hands together)
Beg, beg
Gotta, you gotta
Gotta, you gotta
Gotta, you gotta (Ladies and gentlemen, put your hands together)
Beg, beg
Gotta

Used to tell me you were my best friend
Used to tell me your loyalty would never end
Said you'd always have my back
As soon as I hit rock bottom
You were nowhere to be had, no, no

Gonna give it to me
On the floor where I can see
On your knees and beg
If you're searchin' forgiveness
Gonna give it to me
On the floor where I can see
On your knees and beg
If you're searchin' forgiveness
You might also like
Gotta, you gotta (Today's letter was B)
Gotta, you gotta (And the word was beg)
Gotta, you gotta
Beg, beg

Won't let nobody bring me down
Tellin' you what goes around comes around
Life's just full of mysteries
That's exactly what you are
Exactly what you are to me

I'm gonna hear you beg (Hear you beg)
Make you see friendship ain't on the mend (Ain't on the mend)
Can't forgive you if I could
Wanna come into my world
Now you see I'm doing good

Gonna give it to me
Gotta give it, you gotta give it to me
On your knees and beg
Ooh, on your knees
Gonna give it to me
On the floor where I can see
On your knees and beg
If you're searchin' forgiveness
Gotta, you gotta (You gotta, you gotta give it to)
Gotta, you gotta (You gotta, you gotta give it to)
Gotta, you gotta (You got it you gotta give it to, ooh-ah, ooh-ah)

Get down on your knees (Beg)
Gonna give it to me (Gotta give it, gotta give it to)
Get down on your knees (Beg, baby)
Gonna give it to me (Beg, baby)

I wanna hear you beg (Hear you beg)
Make you see friendship ain't on the mend
Can't forgive you if I could
Wanna come into my world
Now you see I'm doing good

Gonna give it to me
On the floor where I can see
On your knees and beg
If you're searching forgiveness
Gonna give it to me
On the floor where I can see
On your knees and beg
If you're searchin' forgiveness
Gonna give it to me (Get down on your knees, beg, baby)
On your knees and beg (Gonna give it to me, mmm, B-E-G, beg)
Gonna give it to me (Get down on your knees, ha-ha-ha ha, ha-ha-ha-ha, beg)
On your knees and beg (Gonna give it to me)
Gotta, you gotta (You gotta, you gotta give it to)
