Something in the wine
That accentuates my mood
I'm like a child at school
You're the blackboard I concentrate on you
You close the curtains
I am certain this is more than fun
Your fingers remove my clothes
As you let go
Beneath the floor one by one

I feel so sweet
As you kiss my feet
And you undress me as I
I feel so sweet
As you kiss my feet (Kiss my feet)
And you undress me as I surrender my...
Surrender my body to you

Surrender, surrender
Surrender, surrender
Surrender, surrender
Surrender, surrender my...
You might also like
Like a flower, you unfold
Leading the dance all on your own
And like a dead man I don't move
This is my moment
This is my moment
This is my moment
A magical moment
This is my moment
This is my moment
This is my moment
A magical moment

Surrender, surrender
Surrender, surrender
Surrender, surrender
Surrender, surrender my...

See like, I believe that when two people meet
And express themselves, it's truly sweet
It's a great form of communication
But it has to be the right combination
(Oh I know you're so right)
With these feelings we could be spreading love throughout the nation
But you have to search, not just anyone will do
Thats why, your mission is to find that someone who surrendered to you
I feel so sweet
As you kiss my feet
And you undress me as I surrender my...
I feel so sweet
As you kiss my feet (Kiss my feet)
And you undress me as I surrender my...

To you, ooh
To you, ooh

I feel so sweet
As you kiss my feet (Kiss my feet)
And you undress me as I surrender my...
I feel so sweet
As you kiss my feet (Kiss my feet)
And you undress me as I surrender my...

Surrender, surrender
Surrender, surrender my, surrender
Surrender, surrender
Surrender, surrender my, surrender
Surrender, surrender
Surrender, surrender my, surrender
Surrender, surrender
