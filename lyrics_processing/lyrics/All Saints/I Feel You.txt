Fortunately I've been blessed
Blessed with love and happiness (Happiness)
Who'd have known a soul so
Pure could reach and save my loneliness (Loneliness)
When I think that

Day to day I live a life so full of complications
Sobered by the thought of lies (Thought of lies)
But I just smile (But I just smile)
At the thought of you (At the thought of you)
By my side

And everyday my hopes evolve
When I see you
Now all around, my world is whole
I've no need to
Be insecure, I'm self-assured
Everytime I feel you
I feel you

People fall and lose their way
Because of you I'll know, I'll stay (Know I'll stay, I know I'll stay)
Guided by our love
I'll always have a reason to pave our way (Love is leading the way)

You're the one that keeps my heart growing, growning
