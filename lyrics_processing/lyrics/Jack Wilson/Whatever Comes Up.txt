If you don't bring some snot with you, then we got issues
There's just a certain type of slang people misuse
You've gotta talk like you're in a "gang" to get through
It's like the language has languished with no variety
Feel like I'm living in a Dead Poets' Society
Stoned at my age? in Queens, rockin' Josh Homme
A broke Zune with dope tunes is all I got on me
A word murder/observer with fervor deserving
A semi-permanant turn in the nerves of your current server
"think while you drink, dude" sink deep, or float hopeful
I go for broke so those who quote vocals can vote local
Smoke potent, go loco, point focal
One breath closer to death's eventual choke hold
I feel this music is immortal when I press record
Even if it isn't what the current bored are checkin' for
Been to the end of the checkerboard and back
Run Javascript flash, u got jumped by Jack
Metaphorically - I save flavor for my future queen
Peas porridge in a pot of freshly steamed greens
The beat don't stop until it break your neck
I'm working for the cash but I'll take a check
To the true school heads, I'm givin nuff respect
And to the rest, yo you ain't seen nothin' yet
You might also likeWho do fresh grooves smoother than car maneuvers?
Drives harder than computers, moves kama sutra
He lives his life right, you can disregard rumors
But been a goon since a womb held the odd future
The minute you dimish music to its simple youth
You're getting honesty, but you ain't always getting truth
It's beaming straight into your brain, who needs a living room?
Just acting paranoid, us old heads are permitted to
It ain't a bitter feud, it's big enough for different views
This is simple, Living Proof that hippie dudes can rip it, too
Peace to Aru time to bring it back to wisdom
Bet the human condition will always learn to hack the system
Stay one step ahead of it or save it for the next life
He had the vision, but he couldn't get the specs right
He kept creating cuz he thought it was the way to be
To shake the tree, shuffle A-Z, and spray brain seed
Whatever comes up, comes out kinda primal
Always been a rhyme sayer, maybe they should sign him
Maybe the respect level's climbing with the work ethic
