(oh father I married my girl at the school on mooi river)
Kwashunqa uthuli kwandlovu madoda silwela lobuhle
(the dust was rising with all the preparations at ndlovu's home)
Usipho wakipha izinkomo ezamalobolo ezinamasondo
(sipho paid the bride price with a motor car)
Wadlala umukwa wami, wadlala engalindile
(and my father-in-law performed an unexpected war dance
On the spur of the moment)
Wadlala umukwa wami engalindile kwakhikhiza abafazi
(my father-in-law performed an unexpected war dance
And the women encouraged him with shrill cries)
Ngisho izulu eliphezulu lalihleka kancane
(even the heaven above - i.e. the zulu king - gave a small laugh)
'zulu eliphezulu lalikhona lalihleka kancane
(the heaven above was present and he gave a small laugh)
Emoliva, emoliva
(at mooi river)
Chorus:
Yamnandi lendaba ngaze ngashada emoliva ngiyabonga webanguni
(it was a wonderful event, for I eventually got married at mooi river
And I thank you people of the chunu clan)
Ngaze ngashada ngaze ngathola nowami
(I eventually got married, I eventually even got my own wife)

For you brought together all the nations)
Nahlanganisa zonke izizwe ubesehlulekile ubotha

Botha long having failed to do this)

Botha having long failed)

Important in my life, most of whom were present at my marriage)
