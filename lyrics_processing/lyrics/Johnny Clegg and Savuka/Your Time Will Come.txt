I saw the Berlin Wall fall
I saw Mandela walk free
I saw a dream whose time has come
Change my history -- so keep on dreaming
Deam on dreamer, dreamer
In the best of times and in the worst of times
Gotta keep looking at the skyline
Not at a hole in the road
Your time will come, sister, your time will come
Nobody's gonna rush history, we have to ease it along
