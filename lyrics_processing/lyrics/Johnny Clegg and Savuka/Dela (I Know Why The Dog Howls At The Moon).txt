Like a simple question looking for an answer
Now I am a whale listening to some inner call
Swimming blindly to throw myself upon your shores
But what if I don't find you when I have landed
Would you leave me here to die on your shores stranded?
I think I know why the dog howls at the moon
I think I know why the dog howls at the moon
I say:
"Dela! Dela! Ngiyadela!
(Content, content I am content)
When I am with you!
Dela! Sondela Mama Sondela!
(Closer, closer, come closer mama)
I burn for you!
I've been waiting for you all my life -- hoping for a miracle
I've been waiting day and night -- day and night
I've been waiting for you all my life -- waiting for redemption
I've been waiting day and night -- I burn for you
A blind bird sings inside the cage that is my heart
The image of your face comes to me when I'm a-lone in the dark
If I could give a shape to this ache that I have for you
If I could find the voice that says the words that capture you
I think I know, I think I know
I think I know, I think I know
I think I know why the dog howls at the moon
I think I know why the dog howls at the moon
