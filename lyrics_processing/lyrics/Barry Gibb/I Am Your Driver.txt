No stranger to the strange
It's the dream of your choice
That fate could not change
It's a mystery that is the universe
Ten times the speed of sound
Don't be concerned, I will take care of you
Take you from mercury to mars
Just state what you need
And Jane will be there for you
We're on a journey to the stars
We never stop short of our destination
Eyeballing the constellation
I am your driver and I'm proud to say
In a word, your flight will be smooth
I am your driver, it's your lucky day
We be gone
Together we move, together we move
Apart from black holes, body rolls
Ready for the danger
I'll get you home again
We got a green light, hang on tight
You can rearrange your bags in the aisle
The airline with a smile

Eyeballing the constellation
I am your driver and my speed is great
I'm a stone, born to be smooth
I am your driver, I take you away
We be gone
Together we move (how can we lose)
All aboard the "merry widow" I have found
Our ship can race the wind
Chase it and win for she was a pioneer
Like others before, she lead the line
And there's been good times, some were bad
Some were just appalling
It's all in the scheme of things, I suppose
It all comes down to what is real or what your dream is
One show of shows
Just follow your nose
You'll never stop short of your destination
Eyeballing the constellation
I am your driver and I'm proud to say
In a word, your flight will be smooth
I am your driver, it's your lucky day
We be gone
