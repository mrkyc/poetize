Don't let her she'll destroy you
The moment that she finds
She can't get no solid muscle
Takes all she wants
Empty future for you
And you won't get the best of
What you dream of - she's bad
And it's wrong
So don't wait on me if you believe
She's up there waiting for you
Then you ain't grown at all
And if you need love
Let me see her for you
I can help you make some noise

Eyes that watch her shimmer
They're crying out for more
It's the power
And the pull is too strong
And that love will take you under
She ain't up there waiting for you
She'll kick you when you fall
And anyone would walk away from her
But I love her
And she makes me suffer

D _ when your love is shatterproof
Before she was
There was water in the wine
But now I'm alright
Since I saw her
There
Now we don't ever sleep at night
And if you look
You may see marks on me
But that's love, so be aware
