Just about midnight on the way
To the bright side when she calls
She turned out the light
I'm just a beginner when it comes
From a number on the wall
All god's children need someone to love
And you know I found mine
I've been waiting for the one
After her you will see me gone
I got a question answered anyway
She turned out to be a lesson in love
A lesson in love
Bad girls cross the line
Get it for nothing anytime
I am a victim of the blues
She don't know the truth
Nobody told her how to cry
She got a back against the wall
All god's children need someone to love
And you know , baby , you know I found mine
She can show me I'm the one
After me she'll be on the run
And lightning strikes in my bedroom
The satisfaction was to me a lesson in love
If you give your love for the first time
You might also likeA lesson in love
You could learn from me
It's gonna be
All god's children need someone to love
And you know , baby , you know I found mine
She can show me I'm the one
After me she'll be on the run
And lightning strikes in my bedroom
The satisfaction was to me a lesson in love
If you give your love for the first time
A lesson in love
You could learn from me
It's gonna be
A lesson in love
There are ways and means for your pleasure
A lesson in love
Now just you wait and see
It's gonna be
A lesson in love
If you give your love for the first time
A lesson in love
You could learn from me
A lesson in love
