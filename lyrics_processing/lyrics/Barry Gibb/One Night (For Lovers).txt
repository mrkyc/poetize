On a dream that I can hold you near
Will the message in your eyes
Take shape and crystalize
Or will you disappear
That feeling when you sigh
I could not want you more
Ah , so close and yet so far
And you know it's where we are
And the moment I have waited for
The rhythm of the turning tide
And every star that shines in harmony
Like the fairy tale you read
Like the only heart you need
Is here inside of me
And we are held in time
Your love lost in mine
There is no yesterday
Just the music on the bay
We can lie together
Make forever
One night for lovers
Kiss your lover tonight
On a night like this you lie awake
And no one can tell you why
You fall in love , and love takes over
With no goodbye
I'm dancing in your arms

If you were
Mia no te voy hacer llorar
Dime lo que quieras me amor
It's the way it has to be
If I get you close to me
I will not let you go
Say you'll be in my arms
Don't make me wait so long
Ah , love me with your lips
Touch me with your touch
Fill me up with one anticipation
One night for lovers
Kiss your lover tonight
On a night like this you lie awake
And no one can tell you why
You fall in love and love takes over
And there is no goodbye
I'm dancing in your arms
And I'm close enough to know
You make me yours
And you
You're mine
You're mine
And the wonder of it all
When tomorrow comes , I call you mine
I'm the promise you fulfill
