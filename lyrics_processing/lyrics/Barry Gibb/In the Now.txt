You're only my destination
And all I think about is yesterday
I need you here in the now
In my heart
In my soul
In the now
In my heart
In my soul
In the now
I said it baby all my life is so wrapped up in you
And I can only wish
That you could feel the way I do
I found a love
And I can't get enough
To have you suddenly
Standing right in front of me
I may be lonely but I'm not alone
And we don't need conversation
I'm only happy when I hear you move
You speak the pleasure within
In my heart
In my soul
In the now
In my heart
In my soul
In the now

You began to slowly bend my will
Love is the game
We go not shame
And time is standing still
All my life
I never felt this way before
Learning what I never knew
You are what I'm searching for
In my heart (In my heart)
In my soul (In my soul)
In the now
In my heart (In my heart)
In my soul (In my soul)
In the now
This is the story of what it might have been
It's just my imagination
I made it up
Instead of giving in
(In the now)
I may be crazy but I'm not alone
(In the now)
I call it intoxication
They say tomorrow is another day
(In the now)
I'm only here in the now
In my heart (In my heart)
In my soul (In my soul)
In the now
In my heart (In my heart)
In my soul (In my soul)
In the now
I may be lonely but I'm not alone
(In the now)
And we don't need conversation
I'm only happy when I hear you move
(In the now)
You speak the pleasure within
You're the epitome of innocence
(In the now)
You're only my destination
And all I think about is yesterday
(In the now)
I need you here in the now
I may be lonely but I'm not alone
(In the now)
And we don't need conversation
I'm only happy when I hear you move
(In the now)
You speak the pleasure within
You're the epitome of innocence
(In the now)
You're only my destination
And all I think about is yesterday
(In the now)
