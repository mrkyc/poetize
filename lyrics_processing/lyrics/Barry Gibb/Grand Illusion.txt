Sail an ocean
Go around the world a million times
Here in the valley of the blind the one-eyed man is king
Be a hero
Lead or follow
What you choose to believe is a state-of-mind
But here in the valley of the blind the one-eyed man is king
When it comes down to you
The star you follow
May be gone
When it comes down to you
All the power and the glory
All the fire and the fury
Will not take you far (will not take you long)
It's got to be your own life
Show no night or day
Your face may turn in sorrow
While the others watch
The grand illusion
You may lose your mind
And someone standing with you
While you endure the slings and arrows
And she will be your grand illusion
Your grand illusion
In the moonlight
You might also likeBe an angel
Fly to heaven
All we need is a little bit of peace of mind
Here in the valley of the blind the one-eyed man is king
But when it comes down to you
The star you follow may be gone
When it comes down to you
All the power and the glory
All the fire and the fury
Will not take you far (will not take you long)
It's got to be your own life
Show no night or day
Your face may turn in sorrow
While the others watch
The grand illusion
You may lose your mind
And someone standing with you
While you endure the slings and arrows
And she will be your grand illusion
Your grand illusion
In the moonlight
When it comes down to you
The star you follow may be gone
When it comes down to you
All the power and the glory
All the fire and the fury
Will not take you far (will not take you long)
It's got to be your own life
Show no night or day
Your face may turn in sorrow
While the others watch
The grand illusion
You may lose your mind
And someone standing with you
While you endure the slings and arrows
And she will be your grand illusion
Your grand illusion
