This apparition of living your lie
I had the power but you stole control my love
I need you close to me I can't deny
It's your night world
Places I've never known
All of the wonders lay before me
I pray this heaven never stops
It's your night world
Things are revealed to me
And all the arms cannot hold you
I will see your face in the morning sunrise
Hear your crying every lonely winter long
I need your body and sould to get me through
Holding me over you
So don't tell me that I came one love too late
No other women would I place so high above
I'll that the little that I get in return for
My eternal love
When you're lonely do you cry baby cry
What do they give you when the dream is not enough
This is the hour and the candles are burning
My eternal love, my eternal love
You might also likeI get to watch you when the moon is full
Time to love you when the others are gone
Though what I follow may be fictional
I need to be with you or I may die
In your night world
Doors that are open wide
Then can make my promise to you
You will hear my voice in the mountain thunder
Feel me loving you across the universe
And when the pieces are whole
There's me and you, you and me eternally
I may be broken but I try baby try
Whatever gets you are the things that I must do
I'd like to hit you with a little of my
Eternal love for you
I will be with you when my sweet baby cries
You let me give you what the dream is worthy of
This is the hour and the candles are burning
My eternal love, my eternal love
My eternal love
I'll take the little that I get in return for
My eternal love
I may be lonely but I'll try baby try
You let me give you what the dream is worthy of
This is the hour and the candles are burning
My eternal love
I will be with you when you cry baby cry
You let me give you what the dream is worthy of
I'll take the little that I get in return for
