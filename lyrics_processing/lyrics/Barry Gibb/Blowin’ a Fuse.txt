All the verbal abuse, got me running around
I got nothing to lose, so I'll never be found
All the mowing pictures they supply and we demand
Someone tells you what to think and how to understand
Always on the wall or in the corner of the room
Careful what you say to it, the box is full of doom
Maybe we believe, maybe we belong
So I'm blowing the fuse, and I'm taking it down
And I'm singing the blues, in a home on the side
So whatever you choose, there's a way to be found
And they always say good evening and good morning too
And the weather out there is clearly everyone's concern
And for others it's fun to watch who we kill and who we burn
They tell you nothing here but everybody knows
How to walk and what to wear and how to strike a pose
Style and smile and health and wealth
The kingdom of the wise
Drugging all the masses but you do it in disguise
Everybody lies, the enemy knows
So I'm blowing a fuse, and I'm shaking the ground
And I'm just a recluse, but I'm all over town
And I'm taking the pills, and I'm drinking them down
You might also likeThere is no escape, there will be no early warning
Will there be a second coming
Or will he just be passing through
And we like to send out our message to the universe
Everybody's sober but I'll have another line
Always taking limos but you can't afford the ride
Why you chasing women when there's someone on the side
You can go and party but I'd rather be alone
Even when you're here, the enemy knows
So I'm blowing a fuse, and I'm taking the town
And I'm watching the news, but I can't hear a sound
I got nothing but skills, but I'd rather lay down...
