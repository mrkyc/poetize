I see what I have to do
I can make it through the storm
You got me to keep you warm
And baby I got you
One dark night and a long road ahead of you
Never been so cold
And that future ghost is ahead of you
And he don't lie
I see a shape of a house in the wilderness
Not even one brave man
Is gonna walk that mile from the curse to the legacy
But I must try
I see the sign is saying not that way
It's gonna break you down
It's gonna make you pay
You only listen when there's no more room to grow
Somewhere is right in front of me
No time to lose my memory
This life there's always gonna be sorrow
But it won't happen tomorrow
Stand up and find that inner strength
This time you go to any length
I know we ain't never been higher
We ain't never been higher
We ain't never been higher

If tears were diamonds I'd be a rich man now
Cover myself in silver and gold
Eyes of a child that will never grow old
If tears were diamonds I'd be a rich man now
In the light of the moon there's a silhouette
Not even one brave man
Is gonna walk that mile from the hearse to the funeral
But I don't cry
I see the mirror saying not that fool
He's gonna take you out
He's gonna be that cruel
You only listen when there's no more room to grow
Somewhere is right in front of me
No time to lose my memory
This life there's always gonna be sorrow
But it won't happen tomorrow
Stand up and find that inner strength
This time you go to any length
I know we ain't never been higher
We ain't never been higher
We ain't never been higher
We ain't never been higher
If tears were diamonds I'd be a rich man now
If tears were diamonds I'd be a rich man now
Cover myself in silver and gold
Eyes of a child that will never grow old
If tears were diamonds I'd be a rich man now
A rich man now
A rich man now
A rich man now
In my narrow point of view
I see what I have to do
I can make it through the storm
You got me to keep you warm
