No longer living on the pain
Oh baby
Though I learned my lesson well
You got me with your magic spell
I'm back in love again
I let you go for what you are
Should never be restrained
I simply set you free
You found me lost without you girl
And the love you say was missing
A love that brightens up the night
You'll never be short of the reasons
You can rely on all you need
Never be lost inside each other
And you know by the second time you fall
You were not in love at all
Not in love at all
Like the precious love that grows
You made my life on earth like I was
Never born before you
I got the wings of love
To rise above the storm
But we were not in love
Sad to say we're not in love
Not in love at all
You might also likeHow did you get to be a mine of information
I'll be the one that puts you wise
You know it's not just that I want to dry
Any little tear you cry
I'm in love with you baby
We'll never see all of the seasons
You can be my eternity
Never be lost
To cry myself to sleep in sorrow
We're not in love at all
Like the precious love that grows
And you and I will be
A story with no happy ending
Oh baby this I vow
The greatest love you will recall
That we were not in love
Sad to say we're not in love
Not in love at all
Then why do I cry
Not in love at all
We are not in love at all
I just don't sleep at night
Not in love at all
Oh baby
