You won't ever chain me down
I've been to heaven and I've been to hell
And I've been livin' underground
You want me to be the man
You know I never wanna be
Everybody changes with the wind
Set my spirit free
Let me tell me where I should not go
Off together in a one-man show
I need somebody to hold me when the night is long
I am the man who does it all or nothing
I am the one who will not fade away
I am the man who puts his hand in the fire
Bein' forever young
Back where I belong
Singing a home truth song
Singing a home truth song
With the weight of the world on my shoulders
Always been that way
This runaway train keeps on rollin'
Someone gotta pay
I take what my God has given me
I can't tell you why
There must be a reason for livin'
Sometimes I'd rather die
You might also likeWith a storm on the ocean at the river's end
I won't be lonely, it's my only friend
I need somebody to hold me when it all goes wrong
I am the one who does it all or nothin'
I am the one who will not fade away
I will be standin' with my hand in the fire
Bein' forever young
Back where I belong
Singin' a home truth song
Singin' a home truth song
I ain't the poster boy you made me
You won't ever chain me down
I've been to heaven and I've been to hell
And I've been livin' underground
You want me to be the man
You know I never wanna be
Everybody changes with the wind
Set my spirit free
I am the man who does it all or nothing
I am the one who will not fade away
I will be standin' with my hand in the fire
Bein' forever young
Back where I belong
Singin' a home truth song
