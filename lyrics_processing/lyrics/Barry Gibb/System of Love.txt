You made me what I thought I could never be
Out of the flames with my hands untied
No time to grieve for the loss
Hearts that come together for the first time
Sparks that fly around the room
Lets face it i'm
Dealing with something I don't understand
But I'll kill you if you stop too soon
To tight to fight the system of love
You get to try what others only dream of
Right to the body you get what you want
Just once over my love I make your knees bend
It's the fire of faith
It's the heart of the soul
I can be your system if you lose control
I'l plug into you
I know how to love you girl let me try
Come together we electrify
System of love, system of love
Give a little
Now you don't know what it is since you touched me
My world has changed
You're the one that I live and breathe for
You and me baby gone insane
Loving arms that gotta hold on to someone
I can see you watching me
Is that what you want
State to state, a matter of time
That you may be slipping but your too,too, too
You might also likeToo tight to fight the system of love
You get to try what others only dream of
Right to the body you get what you want
Just once over my love I'll make your nose bleed
And it's all for the love
Heart of the light
I can be your system give me just one night
I'l climb up to you
I know how to love just let me try
We come together we electrify
And it's all for the love
Heart of the light
I can be your system give me just one night
I'll climb up to you
I know how to love you just let me try
