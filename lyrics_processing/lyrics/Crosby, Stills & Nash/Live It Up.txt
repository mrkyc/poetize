Live it up
Don't need the look of a millionaire
Takes more than money just to live it up
Don't need designer on the things I wear
Takes more than fashion just to live it up
Don't need my home sitting in Bel Air
Forty room apartment just to live it up
Don't need Jacuzzis or midnight affairs
Neighbors in the nude just to live it up
But I need to live it up, oh, oh, oh
I need to live it up, oh, oh, oh
I want to live it up, live it up
Don't need connections for a ringside seat
Takes more than power just to live it up
Don't need the keys to the governor's suite
Takes more than politics to live it up
Don't like the tricks they play on Easy Street
So don't do me favors just to live it up
Don't need to mingle with the stars I meet
Backstage passes just to live it up
