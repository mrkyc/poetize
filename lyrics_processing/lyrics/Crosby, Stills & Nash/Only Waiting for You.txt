It must have been back in my teens
I was such a basket case when I was young
It's obviously something that I dreamed
I have always been a most reclusive kind of guy
When love's around I usually run and hide
Don't you go believin' I was ever that confused
I was really only waiting for you
Really only waiting for you
And what do you suppose that we can do
Anything whatever that you want to last forever
Really only waiting for you
And I cannot escape the over-whelming feeling
Destiny has taken us in hand
And nothing that we do is gonna change
The way this love affair is never gonna end
And I know it's hard getting used to the idea
That your lover wants to be your best friend
With a showing of affection and a measure of romance
This is really only waiting for you
Really only waiting for you
And what do you suppose that we can do
Anything whatever that you want to last forever
Really only waiting for you
You might also likeWaiting, waiting, only waiting for you
Waiting, waiting, only waiting for you
I've been living by myself I do not want for someone else
At least that's what I like to say
And it was working till the other day I met you
And I fell in love from twenty yards away
I've got one last truly great love left in my life
And my heart is tellin' me it might be you
So forget your disappointments I'll forget about my past
I was really only waiting for you
Really only waiting for you
And what do you suppose that we can do
Anything whatever that you want to last forever
Really only waiting for you
Really only waiting for you
And what do you suppose that we can do
