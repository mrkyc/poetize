Making funeral plans for
The us that was not meant to be
All trussed up
Have your minions throw me on the heat
I'm down
And Lucifer never fell so deep
Clouds once lined with silver
Now darkly assemble
Obscuring skies shaded blue
Do they regret aquiring a taste for your lofty altitude?
I'm down
And Lucifer never fell so true
Lucifer was the fella
Who had the nerve to tell em
This party needs a little zing
If I remain silent I might still enjoy a diet
Of your heaven baked something something
Yet another reminder of days passing kinder
Our belt loops joined like Siamese pals
You kept the coin
And tossed me in the wishing well
You might also likeI'm down
And Lucifer never fell so proud
I've been pleasantly shaken, stirred, and awakened
To the fact that you're already took
I've been vanquished
St Peter's crossed me off the hook
I'm down
And Lucifer never fell so good
Lucifer was the joker
Who encouraged the hostess
To serve up a midnight snack
Old pouty passed an evict
And since that garden picnic
We've never been invited back
No one can resist it
The urge to enlist in
Your crusade to keep the slate wiped clean
So put me down
And give Lucifer about a week
Before he crawls back up
Ungratefully
Proposing to you on cloven hoof and knee
An unholy joining of opposite attractees
A delicious together
Apart and forever
Comprised of just you and me
I'm charmed
And Lucifer never fell so fire
I'm catched
And Lucifer never fell so bad
You're my complete
And luficer never fell at your feet
He don't know know know know know
Know know know know know
He don't know know know know
Know know know know know
