Hovering by my suitcase, tryin' to find
A warm place to spend the night
Heavy raindrops falling
Seems I hear your voice callin' It's all right

It's a rainy night in Georgia, a rainy night in Georgia
Lord, I believe it's raining all over the world
I feel like it's raining all over the world

Neon signs a flashing, taxicabs and buses
Passing through the night
A distant moan of a train, seems to play a sad refrain
To the night

A rainy night in Georgia, a rainy night in Georgia
Lord, I believe it's raining all over the world
I feel like it's raining all over the world

How many times I've wonder
And it still comes out the same
No matter how you look at it or think of it
You see it's life and we just got to play the game
You might also like
Find me a place in the boxcar
I take my guitar to pass some time
Late at night when it's hard to rest
I hold your little picture to my chest
And you know what I feel fine

It's a rainy night in Georgia
A rainy night in Georgia
Lord, I believe it's raining all over the world
I feel like it's raining all over the world

Aw Sam, I think it's still raining out there
Raining all over all over the world, Conway Twitty
You know I kinda like it when it rains like that
Yeah, like that
Brings back some memories from a long time ago
Remember how the rain used to sound?
It just makes you wanna
You know some times just sit back
And go la da la da da da da
Yeah, it makes me want to but I can't, Sam
Oh, come on you can do it try, try, try
But I can tell you this I remember how
That rain used to sound on that tin roof back home
Yeah, do that deep thing I like to hear you do
Awwww, that's it, that's the one right there
Ah, huh
Oh, Brook Benton, where are you son?
It's rainin', rainin', rainin'
Sam, I think I'm getting wet
