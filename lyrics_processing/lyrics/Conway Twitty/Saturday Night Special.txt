She was there to hauck her ring
The broker in the pawnshop
Deals in almost anything
He'll pay you for your misery
Or he'll sell you someone's pain
And that twinkle in his greedy eye
Says your loss will be his gain
She stood back in the shadows
As the broker dealt with me
Her eyes were dark and desperate
From some private misery
His words were so prophetic
When he said you got a steal
I said throw in one bullet
And you got yourself a deal
Oh, a Saturday night special
Is an easy thing to buy
All you got to be is twenty-one
Or fifteen if you lie
Just hand the man money
And if some ones gotta die
The broker in the pawnshop
Won't even blink an eye

And I was almost to the door
When I heard him tell the lady
Seven dollars nothing more
The lady started crying
As he took her wedding band
Well, my hand was in my pocket
And the gun was in my hand
I was gonna use that bullet
To end my life
I was once somebody's husband
She was once somebody's wife
Well, I usually mind my business
But I could not walk away
His dollars just weren't making sense
And I knew I had to stay
Well, the broker's face turned pasty
When he caught my icy stare
It would never leave my pocket
But he knew the gun was there
I asked him what his life was worth
And he opened up that drawer
For a simple golden wedding band
He paid $2000 more
That Saturday night was special
Even though it wasn't planned
As we walked down the sidewalk
She reached and took my hand
We crossed the bridge and I took that gun
And sailed it through the air
I said, "Ever been to Texas?"
She said, "I think I'd love it there."
Oh, a Saturday night special
Is an easy thing to buy
All you got to be is twenty-one
Or fifteen if you lie
But there's a pawnshop in the city
That used to deal in everything
Ha, but you can't buy a pistol there
