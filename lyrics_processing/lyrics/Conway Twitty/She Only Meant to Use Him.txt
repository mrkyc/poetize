And she met him in the city
And somehow he fit right into her plan
She knew she hit it lucky
He owned half of Kentucky and best of all
He was a sixty year old man
She let him think he'd caught her
She led him to the alter
Totin' seven carats on her hand
All dressed up in satin
Aw' the good Lord wasted that one
But she knew she'd be the winner in the end
'Cause she only meant to use him
She only meant to use him
And she didn't care if what she did was wrong
She only meant to use him
And she knew what she was doing
In a few years she'd be rich and he'd be gone
--- Instrumental ---
In their million dollar palace
The man grew old and jealous
And he never let her leave the house alone
She was in her prime and holding
But she knew that he was old
And chances were he wouldn't be around that long
You might also likeAs the days and nights grew longer
The greed in her grewstronger
And it even crossed her mind to take his life
But he found out he'd been taken
And his pride was badly shakened
And he knew she never meant to be a wife
She only meant to use him
She only meant to use him
But she knew what she wanted in the end
She only meant to use him
But he knew what she was doing
And he swore she'd never have a dime to spend
Tormented by frustration
She watched her beauty wasting
As the lines upon her face began to show
She turned to heavy drinkin'
'Cause her ship was slowly sinking
And the bottle was the only place to go
Now 20 odd years later
The headlines in the paper
Said they laid her soul to rest at 53
And when they wheeled him to her coffin
He took her diamond off
And he just smiled and finally died at 93
She only meant to use him
Lord knows she meant to use him
But she died with seven carats on her hand
All dressed in satin
Aw' the good Lord wasted that one
But her husband died a satisfied old man
She was young and she was pretty
And she met him in the city
And somehow he fit right into her plan
She knew she hit it lucky
He owned half of Kentucky and best of all
