Y'all about to meet the real deal
Bitch ain't cute
Bitch if you ain't got my motherfucking money
You about to get served (Served, served, served)
Click clack of the gavel but we'll need a judge
You been fucking with my cheddar so it's time to grudge
Was you hoping I was sleeping when I counted my stacks
But I keeps my receipts like my DJ throws back
Yo, pardon my french as you approach the bench
Good people of the court, do you smell that stench?
Tryin' to make off with my assets and my hard-earned loot
But I'm laced up in briefs and the look is quite cute
Cease and desist, and you'll wake up the sis
I'll break your neck like a ho breaks her wrist
Better call legals in before you meet with my team
Yeah I'm repped by the firm two bitches and a queen
I'll be getting vindication while you stuck in litigation
While I'm hitting you with stations bitch won't be no deviation
Bitch won't be no deviation
Bitch won't be no deviation
Why you acting funny, honey?
Why you acting funny, honey?
Why you acting funny, honey?
Why you acting funny, honey?
Why you acting funny, honey?
Why you acting funny, honey?
Why you acting funny when you fucking with my money, honey?

Good god, you're a fraud, and your case is flawed
Now the jury has no mercy, they're a firing squad
Don't prepare your rebuttal, trick, you out of time
Yeah, statement's overruled cause they falsified
Preponderance of evidence has made it clear
Time to pay the court costs, bitch, meet the cashier
Should have settled real quick with no frustration
Now I'm teaching you the art of liquidation
Cease and desist, and you'll wake up the sis
I'll break your neck like a ho breaks her wrist
