And he was like 5'4, curly hair, big brown beady eyes and soooo Jewish he was so cute
So he like, invited me over for Christmas dinner
But it wasn't Christmas dinner he said it was like "khaaa"
I don't know, I thought he sneezed
And like, when his mom opened the door I said: "Merry Christmas"
And she looked at me and she was like: "Shalom"
And I was like, oh
Where's your Christmas tree?
What's up with this candelabra?
Why are you guys eating Chinese food?
And she just looked at me and said:
"Uh, this is how we Jew it!"
This is how we Jew it
This is how we Jew it
This is how we Jew it
So we sat down for dinner and there were like all these dill pickles on the table
And this weird jellyfish in a jar
And Stan offered me these things called potato latkes and brisket and cholla bread and kugel
And I was like: "Ew, I don't eat starch, I'm a gluten-free vegan. Ugh!"
The kids all play with these things called dreidels
And I'm like: "Oh my god, I love Dr. Dre!" and they just looked at me kinda weird
And then their parents gave them these gold coins
And I'm like: "Oh my god, I love money, I love Hanukkah!"
Then his yaya gave me a glass of Manischewitz wine
And I was like: "Oh my god I love it!"
This is how we Jew it!

After dinner all the guys were like: "This shiska is cool"
I totally felt like Barbra Streisand
I was like: "Let's watch Yentl, let's break the glass, where's Mel Brooks?
This wine's got me schvitzing, oy gevalt, I'm getting verklempt
I'm on this Hasidic shit"
This is how we Jew it!
