Hey hey, hey hey, hey hey, hey hey

I've been workin' like a dog all day
Sweatin' bullets, just stackin' that hay
I got a 12-pack sittin' on ice
It's a cold beer kinda night (Hey hey)
That old sun's finally sinkin' down
Them fireflies are all dancin' around
I hear the crickets singin' back in the pines
It's a cold beer kinda night (Hey hey)

Whatcha say we go crank up the radio?
Old Alabama singin' feels so right
Pop a top or two; baby, rock with you
'Til the moon runs out of light
It's every kiss and reminiscin'
All of the conditions are right
For a cold beer kinda night
(Hey hey, hey hey)

We ain't gotta shoot no whiskey down
We ain't gotta go and paint the town
Just catch a buzz and get lost in your eyes
It's a cold beer kinda night (Hey hey)

Old Alabama singin' feels so right (Feels so right)
Pop a top or two; baby, rock with you
'Til the moon runs out of light
It's every kiss and reminiscin'
All of the conditions are right
For a cold beer kinda night

Well, can't you feel it, baby, in the air?
We need a little middle of nowhere
It's lookin' like the stars have all aligned
For a cold beer kinda night (Hey hey)

Whatcha say we go crank up the radio?

Pop a top or two; baby, rock with you

For a cold beer kinda night
Oh baby, don't it feel just like
For a cold beer kinda night (Cold beer kinda night)
Yeah, baby, don't it feel so right?
A cold beer kinda night
Hey hey, hey hey
