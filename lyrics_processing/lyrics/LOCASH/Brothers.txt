Couple boys in the seventh grade
Hangin' out at the roller rink
Wasn't hard to twist my arm
And take me over where the girls hang
Double dare me to get her name
That turned into a couple skates
Brothers

16 in a Bronco
Tire blown from a pothole
Go figure, in the middle of the night, you're
The only one that picked up the phone
Picked me up on the side of the road
We jammed out the whole ride home
Damn, where did time go, brother?

You call me out when I'm trippin'
Pour 'em strong when I'm sippin'
If I holler at my boy, you'll be there in a minute
Yeah, you know I got your back
Yeah, we've been down like that
Since we were bad boys in some fast toys
On the back roads, we ride (We ride)
It's the way it is, couple crazy kids
Until the day we die
I'm like lightning, you're like thunder
You got one, you get the other
Brothers
You might also like
Overseas, on the front lines
Bunch of whole different bloodlines
All fightin' on the same side
For the same flag and the same rights
These guys wouldn't blink an eye
To lose theirs to save a life
So brother...

You call me out when I'm trippin'
Pour 'em strong when I'm sippin'
If I holler at my boy, you'll be there in a minute
Yeah, you know I got your back
Yeah, we've been down like that
Since we were bad boys in some fast toys
On the back roads, we ride (We ride)
It's the way it is, couple crazy kids
Until the day we die
I'm like lightning, you're like thunder
You got one, you get the other
Brothers


You call me out when I'm trippin'
Pour 'em strong when I'm sippin'
If I holler at my boy, you'll be there in a minute
Yeah, you know I got your back
Yeah, we've been down like that
Ever since we were bad boys in some fast toys
On the back roads, we ride (We ride)
It's the way it is, couple crazy kids
Until the day we die ('Til the day we die)
I'm like lightning, you're like thunder
You got one, you get the other
Brothers
And when we strip away the colors
Thank God we got each other
