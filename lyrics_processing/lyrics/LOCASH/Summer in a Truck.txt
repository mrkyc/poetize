Got a floorboard full of sand
And empty cans, rollin' around
Got a hell of a left arm tan
And my right one's wrapped around
My baby with her Ray-Bans on
Rock it to a reggae song
Hair blowin' in the wind
Yeah, baby, we gon' spend all...

Summer in a truck with the seat laid back
Hands raised up to the sky
A little 7-Up, Seagram's in the sack
Park it by the riverside
Playlist through the bluetooth (Hey)
Slide back that moon roof (Hey)
Couple months with no shoes
And nothin' to do
All summer in a truck with you

Ridin' 'round killin' time
And knockin' the shine, off of my rims
Hittin' them drive-through lines for curly fries
At 2 a.m.
Keepin' that tank on E
Baby, keep on kissin' on me
I'll try to keep between the lines (Woah)
Girl, I want you by my side, all...

You pick the songs, I'll pick the spot
I'll be the cool, you be the hot
All I know is we got
Yeah, girl, we got, all...
