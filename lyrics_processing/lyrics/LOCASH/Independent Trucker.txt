Well my daddy' was a world class trucker
He met my momma on a four day trip
And she swears to me I was conceived at a big rig dealership
Well the story goes the day I
Was born he hit the road and never looked back
My daddy went and named me a big mistake but my momma always called me Mack
Hauling chug-a-lugging threw the rain and snow
Ya I'm a hauling I put the hammer down and let her roll son
My babies calling' saying baby when you gonna come home
Yeah I'm an Independent trucker
A mother lovin' overloading owner operator, just a tearing up a two lane road
I got the chrome girls on my mud flaps, I got a cup of coffee on my dashboard
I gotta a custom airbrush desert scene, LoCash painted on the door, I got a cross of jesus on the grill
Lights it up like a Christmas tree
Any highway anytime of day
That's where I want to be, I'm a hauling only 700 miles to go, I'm a hauling I put the hammer down and let it roll
My babies calling saying baby won't you come on home, I'm an independent trucker
A mother lovin' overloading owner operator just a tearing up a two lane road
Tear it up son
Aaahaw
I'm a Hauling chug-a-lugging threw the rain and snow
Hauling I put the hammer down and let her roll son
My babies calling' saying baby when you gonna come home, I'm an Independent trucker
A mother lovin' overloading owner operator just a tearing up a two lane road
Yeah I'm an Independent trucker
A mother lovin' overloading owner operator just a tearing up a two lane road
