Got a little wheel in my left hand
Got a left hand in my right hand
Got a little highway, no plans
I can do this all day
Coast down that coastline
Hide from the world in the Georgia pines
Sneak a little kiss at that stop sign
I can do this all day

Little more of that can't stop
Lookin' at you in that tank top
Burnin' it up in that shotgun, so hot
Blowin' me away
Little bit of that cool breeze
Leave a little lipstick on me
Ain't no worry, don't worry about me
Cause I can do this all day

Radio got a little groove on
Baby gon' got a little move on
Every song on is a love song
I can do this all day
Gettin' on home past midnight
Lookin' like another sunrise
Go and take your sweet time
Cause I can do this all day
You might also like
Little more of that can't stop
Lookin' at you in that tank top
Burnin' it up in that shotgun, so hot
Blowin' me away
Little bit of that cool breeze
Leave a little lipstick on me
Ain't no worry, don't worry about me
Cause I can do this all day
All day, all night
All day
All day, all night
All night
Got a little wheel in my left hand
Got a left hand in my right hand
Got a little highway, no plans

Little more of that can't stop
Lookin' at you in that tank top
Burnin' it up in that shot gun, so hot
Blowin' me away
Little bit of that cool breeze
Leave a little lipstick on me
Ain't no worry, don't worry about me
Cause I could do this all day
Little more of that can't stop
Lookin' at you in that tank top
Burnin' it up in that shotgun, so hot
Blowin' me away
Little bit of that cool breeze
Leave a little lipstick on me
Ain't no worry, don't worry about me
Cause I can do this all day
Little more of that can't stop
Lookin' at you in that tank top
Burnin' it up in that shotgun, so hot
Blowin' me away
Little bit of that cool breeze
Leave a little lipstick on me
Ain't no worry, don't worry about me
Cause I can do this all day
All day, all night
All day, all night
