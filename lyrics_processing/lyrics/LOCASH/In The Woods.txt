Ooh-ooh-ooh

Sittin' in a traffic jam
Man, that ain't my jam
Hit me with a beer on a porch
Turnin' off the nightly news
All they do is sing the blues
What I wanna hear that for?
We could trade it all in
For a whippoorwill wind
Lay back and just listen to it blowin'
Just me and you, girl
Here hidin' from the world
It could end and we wouldn't even know it

It's all good in the woods
It's all breeze in the trees
The whole world gone crazy
But it ain't here, baby
Just us and the birds and the bees (Woah-ooh)
It's all fine in the pines
Where the moon shines like it should
It's all gravy with ya, baby
Yeah, every single day
It's all good in the woods
You might also like
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
It's all good, all good in the woods
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
It's all good in the woods

Girl, we got it made, ain't nobody showin' up
Sittin' in the shade, ain't nobody throwin' none
Doin' what we wanna, we can do it anywhere, girl
The crickets and the deer don't care

It's all good in the woods
It's all breeze in the trees
The whole world gone crazy
But it ain't here, baby
Just us and the birds and the bees (Woah-ooh)
It's all fine in the pines
Where the moon shines like it should
It's all gravy with ya, baby
Yeah, every single day
It's all good in the woods

(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
It's all good, all good in the woods
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
It's all good in the woods
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
It's all good, all good in the woods
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
It's all good in the woods
Yeah, when ya leave, ya can't wait to get back
'Cause it's all that and a six pack

It's all good in the woods
It's all breeze in the trees
The whole world gone crazy
But it ain't here, baby
Just us and the birds and the bees (Woah-ooh)
It's all fine in the pines
Where the moon shines like it should
It's all gravy with ya, baby
Yeah, every single day
It's all good in the woods

(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
It's all good, all good in the woods
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
It's all good in the woods
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
It's all good, all good in the woods
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
It's all good in the woods
