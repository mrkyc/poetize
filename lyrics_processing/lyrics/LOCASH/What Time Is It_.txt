I got the truck warmed up, all gassed up
Rollin' down rural route three
Got on a sock cap, a saw in the back
Yeah, we're fixin' to cut down a tree
Hey, timber
You can smell the pine, every single mile
Get it on back to the house
Shake off the snow, make it all glow
Mama break the eggnog out

What time is it (Christmas time)
And you know 'cause it's gettin' (cold outside)
When the snow starts hittin' (four wheel drive)
Rockin' out Christmas time
What time is it (Christmas time)
And you know 'cause it's gettin' (cold outside)
When the snow starts hittin' (four wheel drive)
Rockin' out Christmas time

Front yard's blinkin', whole town's singin'
Rudolf and Jingle Bell Rock
Nana wants a Snuggie, Papi wants some money
I just wanna drink a lot
December
Got cookies in the oven, everybody's comin'
Party starts Christmas Eve
Better hit the hay (Santa's on his way)
'Cause uncle cousin Johnny still believes
You might also like
What time is it (Christmas time)
And you know 'cause it's gettin' (cold outside)
When the snow starts hittin' (four wheel drive)
Rockin' out Christmas time
What time is it (Christmas time)
And you know 'cause it's gettin' (cold outside)
When the snow starts hittin' (four wheel drive)
Rockin' out Christmas time

Hey
Timber
December

What time is it (Christmas time)
And you know 'cause it's gettin' (cold outside)
When the snow starts hittin' (four wheel drive)
Rockin' out Christmas time
What time is it (Christmas time)
And you know 'cause it's gettin' (cold outside)
When the snow starts hittin' (four wheel drive)
Rockin' out Christmas time
What time is it (Christmas time)
And you know 'cause it's gettin' (cold outside)
When the snow starts hittin' (four wheel drive)
Rockin' out Christmas time
What time is it (Christmas time)
And you know 'cause it's gettin' (cold outside)
When the snow starts hittin' (four wheel drive)
