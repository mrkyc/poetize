We could try the coast of Carolina
Catch the Outer Banks sunrise every day of our lives
Find a little spot in Arizona
Decorate the kitchen with a Tex-Mex vibe
From the Sunshine State to the Golden Gate
Anywhere you wanna roll, I'll love
But I got another idea, we could kick it right here
Ain't even gotta load that truck

We could make this hometown home
Keep our roots where they've always grown
Find a fixer-upper down that road
From the Church of Christ where you got baptized
We could raise a couple kids up good
In the same red dirt little neck of the woods, yeah
Girl, I'm down to go anywhere you wanna go
But if you wanna stay, I was thinking we could make
This hometown home (We could make hometown home)

We can go to your grandma's every Sunday
You know I love her and her five-star suppers
Take it back to the field we had our first date
Find a star we ain't wished on yet
Girl, we just won't find our names spray painted
Under any other Main Street bridge
If we hit that road in a Winnebago
Imagine all the things we'd miss
You might also like
We could make this hometown home
Keep our roots where they've always grown
Find a fixer-upper down that road
From the Church of Christ where you got baptized
We could raise a couple kids up good
In the same red dirt little neck of the woods, yeah
Girl, I'm down to go anywhere you wanna go
But if you wanna stay, I was thinking we could make
This hometown home
We could make this hometown home

From the Sunshine State to the Golden Gate
Anywhere you wanna roll, I'll love
But I got another idea, we can kick it right here
Ain't even gotta load that truck

We could make this hometown home
Keep our roots where they've always grown
Find a fixer-upper down that road

In the same red dirt little neck of the woods, yeah
Girl, I'm down to go anywhere you wanna go
But if you wanna stay, I was thinking we could make
This hometown home (We could make this hometown home)
Ooh, hometown home (We could make this hometown home)
