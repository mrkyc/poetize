It feels like a party
It feels like a party

Everybody's showing up
It's gotta be the whole town
Got a parking lot full of trucks
Oh, so I know I'm in a party crowd
It's only eight and the speakers are banging
Yeah, this place is already lit
Good thing I decided to roll up tonight
This is one that I don't wanna miss

It feels like a party
It feels like a damn good time to me
A bunch of country girls and back road boys
All here to drink and sing
So go on, pour me something cold
'Cause we ain't 'bout to leave
It feels like a party
It feels like a party to me

Make you wanna get your hands up
Side to side, get your hands up side to side
Make you wanna get your hands up
Side to side, get your hands up side to side

Every time a beat drops
Something gon' be goin' down (Goin' down)
Already know we ain't about to stop
We'll rock 'til the sun come back around (Back around)
Right now there's no where else I'd rather be
Than with y'all, if you ask me

It feels like a party
It feels like a damn good time to me
A bunch of country girls and back road boys
All here to drink and sing
So go on, pour me something cold
'Cause we ain't 'bout to leave
It feels like a party
It feels like a party to me

If it looks like a party, it sounds like a party
It's gon' be a party to me
If it tastes like a party, shakes like a party
It's gon' be a party to me

It feels like a party
It feels like a damn good time to me
A bunch of country girls and back road boys
All here to drink and sing
So go on, pour me something cold
'Cause we ain't 'bout to leave
It feels like a party
It feels like a party to me
Make you wanna get your hands up
Side to side, get your hands up side to side
Make you wanna get your hands up
