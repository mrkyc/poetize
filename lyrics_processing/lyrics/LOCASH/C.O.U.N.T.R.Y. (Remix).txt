That's what I signed for C-O-U-N-T-R-Y
My daddy died for C-O-U-N-T-R-Y
My music sings C-O-U-N-T-R-Y
My girlfriend lives out in the C-O-U-N-T-R-Y

Can I get a yes sir, yes ma'am, sweet home Alabam, hot damn
Gonna bring a little yee-haw, hee-haw, giddy up, hey y'all
Wanna hear aw shucks, pickup trucks, camo, ammo, 12 point buck
Bang, bang, that's how we live

I'm living in a country world
I'm loving on a country girl
Got a hound dog named him Earl
I'm living in a country world
