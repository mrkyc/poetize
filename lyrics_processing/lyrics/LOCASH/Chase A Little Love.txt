I got a Saturday night, girl, that I've been saving
You've got a sweet kiss, I've been dying to taste it, taste it
Baby, take off them shades and let me see them blue eyes
Wanna look real deep and get lost in them one time, one time
Baby, all night

Whoa oh oh
Got an empty seat
Whoa oh oh
So hop in with me

And take a ride, moonlight
Do whatever feels right
Your lips on mine, runnin' all the stop signs
Radio so slow, creep down an old road
Ain't nobody gotta know where we are, let's go!
Catch a feeling, park up on the hill and turn out the light
Chase a little love tonight

Baby this old truck ain't no Range Rover
It's got a custom leather bench seat so you can slide over
And get closer, 'til you're right up on my shoulder
You might also like
Whoa oh oh
Let's roll 'em down
Whoa oh oh
And rock the speakers out

Let's take a ride, moonlight
Do whatever feels right
Your lips on mine, runnin' all the stop signs
Radio so slow, creep down an old road
Ain't nobody gotta know where we are, let's go!
Catch a feeling, park up on the hill and turn out the light
Chase a little love tonight

Shine them wheels, wash that truck
I'm gonna pick you up
There you go looking fine
Sure enough, gonna make you mine
Whoa oh oh
Yeah, let's roll 'em down
Whoa oh oh
Rock the speakers out

Let's take a ride, moonlight
Do whatever feels right
Your lips on mine, runnin' all the stop signs
Radio so slow, creep down an old road
Ain't nobody gotta know
Where we are, let's go!
Catch a feeling, park up on the hill and turn out the light
Chase a little love tonight
Let's chase a little love tonight
Chase a little love, chase a little love tonight
Chase a little love tonight
