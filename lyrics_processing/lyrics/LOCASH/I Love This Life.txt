I love my boots broke in, I love my camo hat
Don't mind a little paint on my jeans, yeah, I roll like that
I love drivin' my truck across the railroad track
If you hit it too quick, it'll hit you right back
I love a fresh cut field with a first frost on
How it shines like gold when the sun turns on
I love the sound of them wheels, my baby singin' along
When "Boys of Summer" comes on

I love my small-town world
I love a country girl
I love a Friday night
Man, I love this life
The sound of an ol' dirt road road
Rollin' through my mind
Man, I love, man, I love
Man, I love this life

I love that county-line bar where they all know my drink
The way she throws her hands up when that cover band plays
I love that taste of her lips when she's been sippin' that wine
I still get drunk on her every time

Man, I love this life

Man, I love this life (I love this life)

I love that ragged old barn that my grandpa made
It was my whole world back in my innocent days
I love that little white church out on 109
It's where I hit my knees and I thanked the Lord for this life of mine

I love my small-town world
I love a country girl
I love a Friday night
Man, I love this life
The sound of an ol' dirt road road
Rollin' through my mind
Man, I love, man, I love
Man, I love this life
