I only had one speed at 17
It was 95 in a 70
Like I had somewhere to be, stupid me
Wrapped that truck right around a tree
Walked away without a scratch on me
Must've had an angel in the shotgun seat
Holdin' me, watchin' over me
Man...

I just bow my head and pray, pray, pray, pray, pray
Look around and give Him thanks, thanks, thanks, thanks, thanks
For the good, for the bad, for the life that we have
I can't explain, I guess it's just a God thing, God thing, yeah

It was later on, 'round 25
Still wild as hell, still startin' fires
'Til Heaven sent me a pair of eyes
Locked onto mine and changed my life
Now she's the angel in my shotgun seat
And every day still savin' me
Thankfully, sometimes I gotta stop...

I just bow my head and pray, pray, pray, pray, pray
Look around and give Him thanks, thanks, thanks, thanks, thanks
For the good, for the bad, for the life that we have
I can't explain, I guess it's just a God thing, God thing, yeah
You might also like
It's just a God thing, God thing, yeah
It's just a God thing, God thing, yeah

We just found out we got another angel on the way
A perfect little miracle, no other way to say
It's just a God thing
Oh, you know it's just a God thing, yeah

I just bow my head and pray, pray, pray, pray, pray
Look around and give Him thanks, thanks, thanks, thanks, thanks
For the good, for the bad, for the life that we have
I can't explain, I guess it's just a God thing, God thing, yeah
I just bow my head and pray, pray, pray, pray, pray (I just bow my head)
Look around and give Him thanks, thanks, thanks, thanks, thanks (Look around and give Him thanks)
For the good, for the bad, for the life that we have (Oh yeah)
I can't explain, I guess it's just a God thing, God thing, yeah (It's just a God thing, yeah)
