(Hill-hill-hillbilly with a guitar)

Down in Georgiana southern Alabama
Lilly Belle had her a baby boy
Named him Hiram King when they heard him sing
The whole world called him Hank
Yeah couple years later, couple cotton pickers
Made a little singer out in Arkansas
Named Johnny Cash drove a Cadillac
And they called him the man in black

Country boy gone rock star

Phone is always ringin' love ya for your singin'
