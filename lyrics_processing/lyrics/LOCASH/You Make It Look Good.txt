That old t-shirt I used to wear sure fittin' you like it should
You make it look good, yeah, you make it look good
No makeup, wake up Saturday morning like no other girl could
You make it look good, yeah, you make it look good

You make it look fine like a diamond shinin' in the rough, I can't get enough
You make it look good, yeah, you make it look good
Take something plain, make it look great, even a ball and chain
And make it look good, yeah, you make it look good
I wouldn't change a thing even if I could
Girl, you make it look good

Ballcap, fishin' pole, bobber in a honey hole, way back in the woods
You make it look good, yeah, you make it look good
Even when my truck's got mud on the tires and all up on the hood
You make it look good, yeah, you make it look good

Fine like a diamond shinin' in the rough, I can't get enough
You make it look good, yeah, you make it look good
Take something plain, make it look great, even a ball and chain
And make it look good, yeah, you make it look good
I wouldn't change a thing even if I could
Girl, you make it look good
You might also like
Everywhere you go, everything you do
Everything you wear looks good on you
It's true

You make it look fine like a diamond shinin' in the rough, I can't get enough
You make it look good, yeah, you make it look good
Take something plain, make it look great, even a ball and chain
And make it look good, yeah, you make it look good
I wouldn't change a thing even if I could
