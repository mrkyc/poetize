Don't forget to take your coat, TV's sayin' snow
Keep in mind that old car of yours ain't no good on slippery roads
And I won't sleep a wink with you out there all alone
I know those dreams you're trying to chase
You want 'em now but they won't wait
Last thing you're thinking about is slowing it down
And the ones you left behind
But I'm always thinking of you
'Cause when somebody loves you
That's what they do
All of the time
So keep in mind
I'll be waitin' on your call
In this little house you grew up in
When your world was safe and small
Ease my mind
With the sound of your voice
Let me know no matter where you are
However far, your home is still your home
I know those dreams you're trying to chase
You want 'em now but they won't wait
Last thing you're thinking about is slowing it down
And the ones you left behind
But I'm always thinking of you
'Cause when somebody loves you
That's what they do
All of the time
So keep in mind
The family and the friends you break
Who cried and watched you drive away
Asking God to please keep you in mind
I know those dreams you're trying to chase
You want 'em now but they won't wait
Last thing you're thinking about is slowing it down
And the ones you left behind
But I'm always thinking of you
'Cause when somebody loves you
That's what they do
All of the time
So keep in mind, there's angels all around you
Keep in mind, we're always thinking about you
Keep in mind, we know you're going to make it
But before you leave and spread your wings
I hope you take these things to keep in mind
