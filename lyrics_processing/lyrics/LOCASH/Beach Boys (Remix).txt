I get around, 'round, get around, I get around (Yeah)
Get around, 'round, 'round, I get around (Ooh-woo)
Ooh-woo

Let's leave the John Deere here, take the CJ
Let's roll this backroad into a freeway
Gonna drive until the map turns blue
Where they say we talk a little funny

Let's take the country to the beach, boys
Trade that red dirt in for sand
Show 'em how we Tennessee, boys
Catch a Jon Boat buzz on a Catamaran
And get a little bit of red on a redneck
Drop a lime in the bottom of a longneck
Find a boat that floats and get shipwrecked
With some local honey, mm
Let's take the country to the beach, boys

I get around, 'round, get around, I get around
We'll drink 'em down, down, drink 'em down, we'll drink 'em down
Give me the beach, boys
You get a round, round, get a round, you get a round
We'll drink 'em down, down, drink 'em down

I'm talkin' way down south where the sun hits
All them girls lookin' good, gettin' sun kissed
Tryin' hard to catch a peek of where the sun missed
And turn 'em on to Brooks & Dunn

We oughta take the country to the beach, boys
Trade that red dirt in for sand
Show 'em how we Tennessee, boys
Catch a Jon Boat buzz on a Catamaran
And get a little bit of red on a redneck
Drop a lime in the bottom of a longneck
Find a boat that floats and get shipwrecked
With some local honey, mm
Let's take the country to the beach, boys

I get around, 'round, get around, I get around
We'll drink 'em down, down, drink 'em down, we'll drink 'em down
Give me the beach, boys
You get a round, round, get a round, you get a round
We'll drink 'em down, down, drink 'em down

Let's trade our ball caps in for sombreros
Instead of Jack D, shoot some Cuervo
Mix up some rum with some Kokomo
Blow all our money
Let's take the country to the beach, boys
Trade that red dirt in for sand
Show 'em how we Tennessee, boys
Catch a Jon Boat buzz on a Catamaran
And get a little bit of red on a redneck
Drop a lime in the bottom of a longneck
Find a boat that floats and get shipwrecked
With some local honey, mm
