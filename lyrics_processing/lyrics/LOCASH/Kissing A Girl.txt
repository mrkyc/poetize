16, set of keys
Pick her up in your hand-me-down Chevy
Hold the door, be polite
Keep talkin' 'bout how she looks pretty

Spend your money like you got some
Even though you ain't got none
'Cause if you play your cards just right

You'll be kissing a girl goodnight
Time will slow down, heart'll beat faster
In that moment, nothing else matters
You'll see forever when you close your eyes
And you're kissing a girl goodnight
Holding your breath, holding her closer
Don't want it to end and then it's over
And you're countin' down the hours 'til the next time
You're kissing a girl goodnight
Kissing a girl goodnight

23, set of keys
One bed, one bath, but it's a mansion
Couple kids, playing grown-ups
Drinking cheap wine, dancing in the kitchen
You might also like
And you can't wait to turn the lights out
'Cause you know when you lay your head down
There's a dream with a ring layin' by your side
And you're thanking God you get to be the guy

Kissing a girl goodnight
Time will slow down, heart'll beat faster
In that moment, nothing else matters
You'll see forever when you close your eyes
And you're kissing a girl goodnight
Holding your breath, holding her closer
Don't want it to end and then it's over
And you're counting down the hours 'til the next time
You're kissing a girl goodnight
Kissing a girl goodnight

She's only three, looking up at me
Say amen, took her in
Then she wraps her tiny arms around my neck so tight
And I'm thanking God I get to be the guy

Kissing a girl goodnight
Time will slow down, heart'll beat faster
In that moment, nothing else matters
You'll see forever when you close your eyes
And you're kissing a girl goodnight
Holding your breath, holding her closer
Don't want it to end and then it's over
And you're counting down the hours 'til the next time
You're kissing a girl goodnight
Kissing a girl goodnight
Kissing a girl goodnight
