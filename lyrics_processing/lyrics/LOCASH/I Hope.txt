And you find roads if it don't
And you won't pass up a second chance
No matter how bad your heart's broken
I hope you always stand up
For all that you believe
Cause that's what makes you who you are
In this world and not who they want you to be
And I hope you know
I'm thinkin of you
Wherever you are
Whatever you do
So go and chase all your dreams, all you want, everything, you believe in I hope
You'll find the one that you need that you can't live without, you, love and I hope
You reach for the sky, try your wings if you like, fly high and I hope
Like every time I've ever had to let you go, I hope
You'll find your way around
When you run into walls
And if you need someone to talk to
I hope you know that I'll be waiting when you call
And every day is one day closer
To all your dreams come true
And those lucky breaks
See your smiling face and follow you
You might also likeAnd I hope you know
I'm thinkin of you
Wherever you are
Whatever you do
So go and chase all your dreams, all you want, everything, you believe in I hope
You'll find the one that you need that you can't live without, you, love and I hope
You reach for the sky, try your wings if you like, fly high and I hope
Like every time I've ever had to let you go
Like I always have
Like I always will
All I want for you
Is the best
Go and chase all your dreams, all you want, everything, you believe
Find the one that you need that you can't live without, you, love
Reach for the sky, fly high and I hope
Like every time I've ever had to let you go
So go and chase all your dreams, all you want, everything, you believe in I hope
You'll find the one that you need that you can't live without, you, love and I hope
You reach for the sky, try your wings if you like, fly high and I hope
