Wanna know why I love you, wanna know what it is?
What keeps me hooked, and lookin' at you like this
Once I get goin', I won't wanna stop
But if you gotta know it, how much time you got?

I could list the reasons why, oh, but I can't count that high
Baby, it could take all night, talkin' 'bout them eyes
Don't get me started on your smile and the way it drives me wild
Oh, 'cause it could take a while, but if you don't mind
Forever ain't enough to tell you what I love
It's a lot, so baby, how much time you got?
How much time you got?

Wanna know how far I'd go just to see you?
When you ain't around, how bad that I need you
Wanna know the ways I'm better off with you than without you
And why I'm all about you, well, how much time you got?

I could list the reasons why, oh, but I can't count that high
Baby, it could take all night, talkin' 'bout them eyes
Don't get me started on your smile and the way it drives me wild
Oh, 'cause it could take a while, but if you don't mind
Forever ain't enough to tell you what I love
It's a lot, so baby, how much time you got?
How much time we got?

Girl, it ain't a couple sentences, don't think I could finish it
If I had the rest of my life

I could list the reasons why, but I can't count that high, nah
Baby, it could take all night, talkin' 'bout them eyes
Don't get me started on your smile and the way it drives me wild
'Cause that could take a while, but if you don't mind
Forever ain't enough to tell you what I love
It's a lot, so baby, how much time you got?
(I could list the reasons why)
How much time we got?
(Oh, but I can't count that high)
(Don't get me started on your smile)
