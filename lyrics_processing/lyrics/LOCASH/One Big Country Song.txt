Yeah, life is like a jukebox, just push play
Not everybody's first word sounds the same
But we all get born and we all get raised
Whether it's some boondocks or Marina Del Rey
Everybody turns wild when you're sixteen
Slow roll, big timin' on Main Street
Everybody's got holes in their blue jeans
If you bought 'em that way or not

Turn it up and sing along
We all work 'til the daylight's gone
We all knock off the edge around five
Fall in love from a kiss on Friday night
And we've all had a broken heart
We've all closed down a few good bars
Take a look around, y'all, tell me I'm wrong
Ain't the whole wide world just one big country song?

Just one big country song

Yeah, well who don't try to find some water when it's hot? (When it's hot)
Whether it's a pontoon, tube, or a yacht (Yeah)
And who ain't got a dog that they love like a brother? (I do)
And who ain't ever tasted better cookin' than their mother?
And who ain't got a story to tell?
And who ain't made it through some hell?
Who don't love somebody, don't miss somebody?
If you're down, sing it with somebody
You might also like
Turn it up and sing along
We all work 'til the daylight's gone
We all knock off the edge around five
Fall in love from a kiss on Friday night
And we've all had a broken heart
We've all closed down a few good bars
Take a look around, y'all, tell me I'm wrong
Ain't the whole wide world just one big country song?

Yeah, it's just one big country song

Not everybody knows the words to "Mama Tried"
A city boy, country boy, yeah, we all just tryna survive
So raise 'em high

Turn it up and sing along
We all work 'til the daylight's gone
We all knock off the edge around five
Fall in love from a kiss on Friday night
And we've all had a broken heart
We've all closed down a few good bars
Take a look around, y'all, tell me I'm wrong
Ain't the whole wide world just one big country song?
It's just one big country song
Yeah, we all live in one big country song
