If I look a little more confident
Like everything's going my way
Like the world, I'm sitting on top of it
Yeah, like I got it made
Well, I got a trick up my sleeve
You ain't gotta look hard to see
That I'm better than I was before
And it's all because, baby

You're my secret weapon, no question
The reason I'm hitting all 7s
Those pretty eyes sitting right next to me
On my first class ticket into Heaven
Girl, your loving got me crushing the game
My Wonder Woman, but he went and I came
No, I can't take no credit, confession
'Cause you're my secret weapon
Yeah, you're my secret weapon

Girl, you put a little good in this bad boy
And all the swag in my step
This road that I'm on, it all points to you
Bringing out my best
I got a trick up my sleeve
I ain't the mess I used to be
I ain't living like that no more
And it's all because, baby
You might also like
You're my secret weapon, no question
The reason I'm hitting all 7s
Those pretty eyes sitting right next to me
On my first class ticket into Heaven
Girl, your loving got me crushing the game
My Wonder Woman, but he went and I came
No, I can't take no credit, confession
'Cause you're my secret weapon
Yeah, you're my secret weapon

Well, I got a trick up my sleeve
Yeah, girl, look what you done to me
So much better than I was before
And it's all because, baby

You're my secret weapon, no question
The reason I'm hitting all 7s
Those pretty eyes sitting right next to me
On my first class ticket into Heaven
Girl, your loving got me crushing the game
My Wonder Woman, but he went and I came
No, I can't take no credit, confession
'Cause you're my secret weapon
Yeah, you're my secret weapon
'Cause you're my secret weapon
No, I can't take no credit, confession
