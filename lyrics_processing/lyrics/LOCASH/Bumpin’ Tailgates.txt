Yeah this for the ball caps turned to the back
This is for the bikers take no slack
This for the dudes with the jacked up trucks
With my home boy who needs a little luck
This is for the chicks out in the sticks
Here's a little somethin' for the city slicks
Howling at the moon, singin' the same tune

Bumpin' tailgates, crankin' up suds
Guys and girls fall in love
Strike a match, light it up
Dancin' in the bed of a pickup truck
Rockin' Eminem y'all, please stand up
Hand me a cup, fill it up
Nobody's gonna shut this down
When it gets late, we're bumpin' tailgates

For the country boys camoed out
Suits and ties, business crowd
Hippies with the long hair
Outlaws that don't care
The skaters, the haters
Don't hate the player, hate the game

Bumpin' tailgates, crankin' up suds
Guys and girls fall in love
Strike a match, light it up
Dancin' in the bed of a pickup truck
Snoop Dog, drop it like it's hot
Hand me a cup, fill it up
Nobody's gonna shut this down
When it gets late, we're bumpin' tailgates

Yeah get your trucks, back them up
Close enough that they can touch

We're bumpin' tailgates, crankin' up suds
Guys and girls fall in love
Strike a match, light it up
Dancin in the bed of a pickup truck
Garth Brooks, friends in low
Hand me a cup, watch me go
Nobody's gonna shut this down
When it gets late, hey hey

We're bumpin' tailgates, crankin' up suds
Guys and girls fall in love
Strike a match, light it up
Dancin' in the bed of a pickup truck
Rockin' Eminem y'all,  please stand up
Hand me a cup, fill it up
Nobody's gonna shut this down
When it gets late, we're bumpin' tailgates
