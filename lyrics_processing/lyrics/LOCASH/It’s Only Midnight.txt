Girl, I could take you home, but I don't want to
'Cause I wanna soak up every second that I got you
Sittin' over there, girl, lookin' so pretty
Ain't no way I'm gettin' in a hurry
I think we should make this last all night long

It's only midnight and that moonlight's got plenty of shine left on it
Got a slow kiss on my lips and it's yours, girl, if you want it
A little afterparty, my hands on your body
And yours all over mine, we've got nothin' but time
It's only midnight
It's only midnight

Girl, let's go get lost in the middle of nowhere
Sing every song on the radio on the way out there
Catch a little buzz, brews for sippin'
Lovin' every minute, girl, I don't wanna miss it
I just wanna see the sunrise in your eyes

It's only midnight and that moonlight's got plenty of shine left on it
Got a slow kiss on my lips and it's yours, girl, if you want it
A little afterparty, my hands on your body
And yours all over mine, we've got nothin' but time
It's only midnight
Oh, it's only midnight
You might also like
Well, it ain't even close to bein' over
So, baby, won't you come a little closer?

It's only midnight and that moonlight's got plenty of shine left on it
Got a slow kiss on my lips and it's yours, girl, if you want it
A little afterparty, my hands on your body
And yours all over mine, we've got nothin' but time
It's only midnight and that moonlight's got plenty of shine left on it
Got a slow kiss on my lips and it's yours, girl, if you want it
A little afterparty, my hands on your body
And yours all over mine, we've got nothin' but time
It's only midnight
