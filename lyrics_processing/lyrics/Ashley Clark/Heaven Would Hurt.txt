I talked to Jesus tonight
Said it was all gonna be alright
But I know temptations calling both our names
You could have any guy in the world
I could find me another girl
But why should we? We're together all the way

I know it's hard to give all your heart to
Only just one man
You know I can't leave you, I really need you
And we both understand

Heaven would hurt if we lost our love
Every angel there would bleed
Baby, you love so loud I can hear you in my sleep
Want you to carry my baby in your belly
When you whisper softly to me
Heaven would hurt if we lost our love so love never leave

When a girl comes onto me
I can feel your jealousy
I ain't gonna lie, I love when you get mad
You might also like
Know it's hard to give all your heart to
Only just one man
But I couldn't leave you cause I need you
I know you understand

Heaven would hurt if we lost our love
Every angel there would bleed
Baby, you love so loud I can hear you in my sleep
Want you to carry my baby in your belly
When you whisper softly to me
Heaven would hurt if we lost our love so love never leave

You love me more than a child in a mother's arms
There is no love that deep
You opened the door I never had in me
You opened me, baby

Heaven would hurt if we lost our love
Every angel there would bleed
Baby, you love so loud I can hear you in my sleep
Want you to carry my baby in your belly
When you whisper softly to me
Heaven would hurt if we lost our love so love never leave
