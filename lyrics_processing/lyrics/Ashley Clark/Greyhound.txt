You must be the reason why I'm feeling this way
Cause since the day you been gone, honey
Nothing's been the same
I'm sitting here drinking just thinking about you
I don't know what went wrong
But I know what I need to do

I need to get on an airplane, fast train
Greyhound, leave town, quit work right now
Somehow get to you, that's what I need to do
I really need to hold you close, let you know
This is real, what I feel, I don't want no one else
After all we've been through
I wanna tell you I love you
That's what I need to do

Yeah, it won't be easy telling you the truth
Cause sometimes it scares me
Knowing how much I need you
I must have been crazy, out of my mind
Cause now I know I can't let you go
And I'm running out of time

I'm just hoping that I'm not too late
