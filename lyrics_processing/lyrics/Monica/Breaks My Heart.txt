Yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
Oh-oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh

When I think of what I've done, all the pain that I've brung
Baby, you should've walked out on me
And when I turned away from you
Whenever there were hard times
How could you still be with me?
And it was no mistake when I hurt you that day
And went out with somebody new
But still, you forgave me like it was so easy
I should've been better to you

Baby, it breaks my heart
To think that lovin' me is not easy to do
And I don't mean to make it hard
Sorry for all the changes I put you through
And it's hard to believe after everything
That you're still here right beside me
Wouldn't trade you for this whole world
I'm thankful just bein' your girl

Never gave you my heart 'cause I never thought
You deserved any of me
I never told you how I felt
When deep inside I knew that
You're really what I need
And I always gave you up whenever I thought
(Always gave you up whenever I thought)
Something better come along
And right when I come back, you're waiting for me
And you welcome me home

Baby, it breaks my heart
To think that lovin' me is not easy to do
And I don't mean to make it hard
Sorry for all the changes I put you through
And it's hard to believe after everything (To believe everything)
That you're still here right beside me
Wouldn't trade you for this whole world
I'm thankful just bein' your girl

And if it takes my whole life
I'll make it up to you
'Cause I've been so cruel
And you've given your love to me
In spite of everything I, I don't deserve you
From this day forward, I'm truly yours
It took me a while to see
That we were meant for one another
Thank you for loving me
Baby, it breaks my heart
To think that lovin' me is not easy to do (Lovin me, loving me)
And I don't mean to make it hard (Don't mean to make it hard)
Sorry for all the changes I put you through
And it's hard to believe after everything (Oh baby)
That you're still here right beside me (Oh, ooh-ooh)
Wouldn't trade you for this whole world
I'm thankful just bein' your girl
Baby, it breaks my heart (It breaks my heart, oh-oh)
To think that loving me is not easy to do (Yeah, yeah)
And I don't mean to make it hard (Makes it so hard, so hard, baby)
Sorry for all the changes I put you through (Put you trough)
And it's hard to believe after everything (Everything, everything)
You're still here right beside me
Wouldn't trade you for this whole world
(I wouldn't change it, it, baby)
Thankful just being your girl
