Yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, listen

Boy, it's been a long time
Since the last time I saw you
Feels like nothin' changed
Since we've been together
I must admit that I go crazy 'bout you
And I can see it in your eyes
That there's somethin' you wanna say to me
'Cause usually right now, you'd be holdin' on to me
But instead, you're tellin' me

That things have changed, they're not the same
And recently you found someone that you
Decided to dedicate your whole life to
And what we had has got to be through

And baby, what hurts the most is letting go
I just want you to know that I love you so
I know things are different now
You've gone and settled down
I thought for sure you'd always wait for me
I'll tell you what hurts the most is I should have took the chance
Boy, when you came to me and offered me your hand
(And offered me)
Silly of me, I thought I'd always have your heart
I had the chance to have all the love
Oh, how I'm missing you now

I hate that there is someone new
Comin' in and takin' my place
Doin' the things that we used to do
And makin' love to you
And oh, what am I supposed to do?
It's killin' me 'cause I want you
And you should have known my love was true
And there's no one else in this world for me but you

But things have changed, they're not the same
And recently you found someone that you
Decided to dedicate your whole life to
And what we had has got to be through

And baby, what hurts the most is letting go (It hurts, oh)
I just want you to know that I love you so (I love you so)
I know things are different now
You've gone and settled down (You've settled down)
I thought for sure you'd always wait for me
I'll tell you what hurts the most is I should have took the chance
Boy, when you came to me and offered me your hand
(You came to me)
Silly of me, I thought I'd always have your heart (I'd always have)
I had the chance to have all the love
Oh, how I'm missing you now
I know that I'm the one to blame for losing you, oh, yeah
I really, really wish that I could be happy for you
There's just one thing I need you to do
Don't you touch her like you used to touch me?
Don't you love her like you really need me?
Don't you love her like you used to love me?

And baby, what hurts the most is letting go (What hurts the most)
I just want you to know that I love you so (Is letting go)
I know things are different now (I love you)
You've gone and settled down (Oh, whoa)
And I thought for sure you'd always wait for me
I'll tell you what hurts the most (I can't go on)
Is I should have took the chance (No)
Boy, when you came to me and offered me your hand (No)
Silly of me, I thought I'd always have your heart
(I had the chance to have all your love)
Oh, how I'm missing you now
What hurts the most is letting go, it makes me feel so tired
Just to let you know, I love you so (I love you so)
What hurts the most is letting go, I'm tryin' to let you go
(What hurts the most, I'm tryna let you go)
Just to let you know I love you so, I love you so
(Oh, but I gotta let you go)
