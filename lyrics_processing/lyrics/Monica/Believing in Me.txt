I apologize for what I've done
I admit that I was losin' control
Didn't know that I was selling my soul
To someone who didn't care at all
Couldn't see that you were bad for me
Gave so much 'til it was making me weak
Now I can't believe the way that it feels to finally be free

I've moved on (Moved on) and I'm strong (I'm strong)
I'm going back to the place where I know I belong
And I'm glad (I'm glad) that you're gone (You're gone)
'Cause you're not what I need, I'm believing in me
I moved on (Moved on) and I'm strong (I'm strong)
I'm going back to the place where I know I belong
'Cause I'm right (I'm right) and you're wrong (You're wrong)
'Cause you're not what I need, this time I'm believing in me

The love I had for you was so deep
I didn't notice there was somethin' wrong with me
When someone asked me was there anything I need
I would cry and tell them, pray for me
But now I know exactly what it is
So I'm changing up the way that I live
And I'm never letting go of my dreams
And baby, you'll see

I've moved on (Moved on) and I'm strong (I'm strong)
I'm going back to the place where I know I belong
And I'm glad (I'm glad) that you're gone (You're gone)
'Cause you're not what I need, I'm believing in me
I moved on (Moved on) and I'm strong (I'm strong)
Going back to the place where I know I belong
'Cause I'm right (I'm right) and you're wrong (You're wrong)
You're not what I need, I'm finally believing in me (In me)

So, I hope you can forgive me
I'm not gonna be the way that I used to be
Starting over can be so scary
But I'm gonna believe
Promise, I'm not gonna let me down
And my transformation's starting right now
But I'm really glad you stuck around
'Cause you believed in me

So, I've moved on (Moved on) and I'm strong (I'm strong)
I'm going back to the place where I know I belong
And I'm glad (I'm glad) that you're gone (You're gone)
'Cause you're not what I need, I'm believing in me
I moved on (Moved on) and I'm strong (I'm strong)
Going back to the place where I know I belong
'Cause I'm right (I'm right) and you're wrong (You're wrong)
You are not what I needed, I'm finally believing in me (In me)
