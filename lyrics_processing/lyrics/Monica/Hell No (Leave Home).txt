You already know
Another one

It's the 17th
A week before the day you were born (Day you were born)
I've been making big plans just for over a month (Over a month)
Tryna make this the best birthday
You ever had, show you that you're my baby (Baby)
Damn, all this rain got me feelin' something's wrong (Something's wrong)
Pullin' up to my gate, they keep saying he's gone (He's gone)
An envelope's in-between my door
Biggest day, got me panickin'
What the hell's this letter gonna read?

Hell, no! (Hell, no!) You say you don't want it no more
Hell, no! (Hell, no!) You say you can't gimme what I want
Hell, no! (Hell, no!) How you just gonna leave
When I stayed with you through hard times and you cheated?
Hell, no! (Hell, no!) I hate to say it, but I need it
Hell, no! (Hell, no!) Oh God, please talk to me
Hell, no! (Hell, no!) Your so-called love was so deep
When it told you you should run far
And not give a damn about me

How could you leave me
When you see me desperately in need of what we were before?
How could you leave home?
I cried so many times
But never did it cross my mind to ever let it go
How could you leave home?
Didn't even see if we ever meant this shit before
But we been down this road
How could you leave home?
How could you leave me, baby?
Please my heart is beating for the beat we had before
How could you leave home?

Damn, I need you, wanna laugh, wanna stand
Wanna get just one more chance to see you
All my friends, all my kin say, "Mo, just let that end"
But I breathe you in the driveway
I found pictures on the ground of our first date
I never in a million years thought this would be me
I'm trapped in love with somebody
That no longer thinks I'm somebody special, look at me

Hell, no! (Hell, no!) You say you don't want it no more
Hell, no! (Hell, no!) You say you can't gimme what I want
Hell, no! (Hell, no!) How you just gonna leave
When I stayed with you through hard times and you cheated?
Hell, no! (Hell, no!) I hate to say it, but I need it
Hell, no! (Hell, no!) Oh God, please talk to me
Hell, no! (Hell, no!) Your so-called love was so deep
When it told you you should run far
And not give a damn about me
How could you leave me, when you see me
Desperately in need of what we were before?
(How could you, you, you?)
How could you leave home? (I cried)
I cried so many times
But never did it cross my mind to ever let it go
(Didn't think to let it go, how could you?)
How could you leave home?
Didn't even see if we ever meant this shit before
But we been down this road
How could you leave home?
How could you leave me, baby?
(How could you, how could you, you?)
Please, my heart is beating for the beat we had before
How could you leave home?

Monica and Twista y'all! (Twista, y'all!)
I remember when you said I couldn't get none of that
Then I remember when you let me hit it from the back
I remember we was young and sprung and steady talkin' on the phone
And we both kept runnin' back to each other
We was lovers together, forever 'til the end
I don't really know why I froze up
Plannin' for a wedding, but getting married is scary
Now I got you crying 'cause a nigga didn't show up
I can't really tell you why, but I'm Twista from the CHI
And I'm dyin' inside 'cause I know I really want you
So for leaving one day, I'ma have to give you the answer, girl
But right now I can't tell you why I left, girl
Sweet personality and good sex, girl
Fear will take a man's life
You supposed to be my wife
Goodbye; hope to see you in the next world
You was all up under me
Actin' like you was so in love
Always talkin' 'bout you a thug
Nigga, what you running for?
Copped you a new Benz
You the first one seen on the block with it
Took you to the club
Showed you how to lean with it, rock with it
You was bold when you wanna get some of that
When you wanna hit the hole like runnin' back
Now you actin like you wanna come runnin' back
Hell, no! Nigga, I don't wanna hear none of that
I know you quick, but I spit that shit too
So all I really wanna say to you is
How could you leave me, baby?
How could you leave me, baby?

How could you leave me (How could you?)
When you see me desperately in need of what we were before?
How could you leave home?
I cried so many times
But never did it cross my mind to ever let it go
(Didn't mean to let you go)
How could you leave home?
Didn't even see if we ever meant this shit before (This before, no)
But we been down this road
How could you leave home?
How could you leave me, baby?
Please, my heart is beating for the beat we had before (Why?)
How could you leave home?

All the women, I caught you with
Still I didn't leave, but I didn't forget
All those women I caught you with
Maybe I didn't leave, but I didn't forget
All those women I caught you with
Boy, I didn't leave, but I didn't forget
All those women, women I caught you with
