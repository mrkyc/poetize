Ooh, whoa, oh

I ain't never had nothing quite like this
And can't believe a girl done made a come up like this
Ain't never been in love like this before
I ain't never seen a ring shine like this
I ain't never had nobody fit me like this

You, you got that lovin' that I would die for
Boy, I've been waitin' all this time
And livin' with nothing, but now I got

Now I got everything, I got a good man

The one I took home to mom and dad
He stole my heart (Stole my heart)
Now I got everything
Someone who don't cheat
Somebody who won't leave me lonely
Even though it took a lifetime to get here
Now I finally, I got everything, it's you
