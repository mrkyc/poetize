There's something that I wanna say
I feel a little out of place
But I need you to make that change
You promised, to keep me out of the rain
I love the cars and everything
The diamond rings
But I love you much more, baby

You said that you were gonna stop when you had enough
You'd do what you had to do
Now you like the profession, you've made it for yourself
You said, you cared about me and you
Now all you wanna do is hustle
You gotta choose, what you gon' do?
When am I worth it to you, baby?

Never thought I'd be afraid to trust (To trust)
Somebody that I love so much
If I can get him out of the streets
Then he can come back to me
Now I see that it ain't no us
Baby, to me, that's a definite plus
If I can't get you out of the streets
Then you don't need to be with me

Do you love me like you say?
Then maybe you could get away
From the life of doin' the wrong things, you promised
Don't make me read about it, babe
Think of me before I'm gone
'Cause when I'm gone, it will be too late
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah

You said that you were gonna stop when you had enough
You'd do what you had to do

You said, you cared about me and you
Now all you wanna do is hustle
You gotta choose, what you gon' do?
When am I worth it to you, baby, yeah?
