Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Da, da, da, da

Oh, I didn't ask to go with you to Mexico
I really didn't need the shopping spree in LA or Melrose
Boy, if you didn't know it, well, now you know
I didn't need the furs or the jewelry
Because material things, it don't mean much to me
And ever since you've been gone
I've been holdin' us down, on my own and no

I never ever cheated, I never ever lied
So you can stop askin', askin' me why
Why I never left you and why I kept it real
And why I'm still with you

You should've known better than to think I would leave
You should've known better than to doubt me (Me)
It don't matter if you're up, matter if you're down
Either way, I'm gonna be around
You should've known that I would stay by your side (Side)
Should've known your girl was gonna ride or die
And it just don't matter
If you're rich or poor, out or in, doin' five to ten
You should've known better

What makes you think that I would forget about ya?
Think about it, who comes to see ya?
Every Saturday and Monday, I was on that receiver
It's me (Me) your girl (Girl), your life (Life), your world (World)
My family and friends, they just don't understand
They say I should leave you alone
But I say, that they all should just leave us alone
Don't you get it?

I never ever cheated, I never ever lied
So you can stop askin', askin' me why
Why I never left you and why I kept it real
And why I'm still with you

You should've known better than to think I would leave (Oh-oh)
You should've known better Than to doubt me
(Don't you doubt me)
It don't matter if you're up, matter if you're down
Either way, I'm gonna be around (Be)
You should've known that I would stay by your side
(By your side, baby)
Should've known your girl was gonna ride or die (Ride or die)
And it just don't matter (Don't matter to me, baby)
If you're rich or poor, out or in, doin' five to ten
You should've known better (Better)

You should've known better than to think I would leave
(You shoulda known)
You should've known better than to doubt me
(You shoulda known)
It don't matter if you're up, matter if you're down
Either way, I'm gonna be around
You should've known that I would stay by your side
(No matter what they think about you)
Should've known your girl was gonna ride or die
(There's nothing I can do without you)
And it just don't matter if you're rich or poor (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Out or in, doin' five to ten (Oh, ooh)
