I can't believe he's gone
Why'd you leave?
Sometimes it hurts so bad

He's the kind of guy that runs the street
But he treats me good
And he makes his dough illegally
That's how he's taking care of me
And I respect the fact that he's chosen that life
But it keeps me up late at night
And I just can't spend my time
Wondering where he's at, is he okay?
Wanna be by his side
But I commit a crime, Bonnie to his Clyde
And I don't wanna live that way

I love my baby so
But he's not here no more (No more)
Hard for me to understand (Understand)
So I wrote him this song (Wrote him this song)
When I look him in his eyes
Knew I couldn't change his mind
So I wrote this melody
And I'm saying sweet goodbye

Though he promised that
He could never put me in harm's way
That it is something that he can't control
'Cause the game remains the same
And now he says he wants out of it
But he's in too deep
And the only way that he would go
Is killing him or leaving me
So this is where I'm at and it hurts so bad
That I had to choose
If I wanna live or die with you (Oh, baby)

I love my baby so
But he's not here no more (Not here, babe)
Hard for me to understand
So I wrote him this song (I wrote you this song)
When I look him in his eyes
Knew I couldn't change his mind
So I wrote this melody
And I'm saying sweet goodbye (Yeah, yeah)
I love my baby so
But he's not here no more (Why did you go?)
Hard for me to understand
So I wrote him this song (Wrote him this song)
When I look him in his eyes
Knew I couldn't change his mind
So I wrote this melody
And I'm saying sweet goodbye
I tried to give him hope
And promised him my life
But I don't know
What made him want to leave this life
And as he went away
A tear fell from my eye
And there's no turning back
There's only goodbye

I love my baby so (Oh, baby)
But he's not here no more
Hard for me to understand (Oh, whoa)
So I wrote him this song (I wrote you this song)
When I look him in his eyes
Knew I couldn't change his mind (Oh, he cried)
So I wrote this melody (I need you)
And I'm saying sweet goodbye
I love my baby so (Sweet goodbye)
But he's not here no more (he's not here)
Hard for me to understand
So I wrote him this song (I wrote this song)
When I look him in his eyes
Knew I couldn't change his mind
So I wrote this melody (Oh)
And I'm saying sweet goodbye
I love you so (I love you)
I need you so
It's hard to imagine my life here without you
(I love you) I love you so
(It hurts so bad) I need you so, baby
