Oh, why her, why her?
Why her, her?
Uh-huh

Last tear just fell from my eyes
Told myself that I wasn't gonna cry no more
You did what you did, it is what it is
And that's why I walked out the door
Moved on with my life, but not really
Spent too much time wonderin', "How could you?"
You do this to us, thought we were in love
Guess I was thinkin' too much

Always thinkin' that the sex had you locked
You never could get enough 'cause you know I kept it hot
I listened to you tell me your dreams
And your fears, I wiped your tears
I was there and that's why this is hurtin' me

Why her? Why her?
Did I get on your nerves?
Did I give you too much
That you couldn't handle my love?
Why her? Why her?
Tell me what she was worth
To make you put her first?
I'm listening

You wanna come back, but I gotta know, why her?
Thought she was all that, then why you at my door?
Look at you, look at us, what's all this for?
Hope you got the answer to my question: Why her?

This gon' be the last time we say goodbye
Ain't gonna be no re-runs of this episode
You did what you did (Yeah), it is what it is
Maybe if you would've told me
You weren't happy, you weren't satisfied
We could've worked it out
Baby, we could've tried
But you didn't say nothing
All along fakin' and frontin', and why?

Always thinkin' that the sex had you locked
You never could get enough 'cause you know I kept it hot
I listened to you tell me your dreams
And your fears, I wiped your tears
I was there and it hurts me

Why her? Why her?
Did I get on your nerves?
Did I give you too much
That you couldn't handle my love? (Oh, why?)
Why her? Why her?
Tell me what she was worth
To make you put her first?
I'm listening (You put her first and)
You wanna come back, but I gotta know, why her?
Thought she was all that, then why you at my door?
Now look at you, look at us, what's all this for? (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Hope you got the answer to my question: Why her?

Now ladies, y'all know I speak from experience, right?
(Ohh, why her?)
I used to just look at him and wonder why, why her?
You know what I'm sayin'? (Why her?)
But ladies, I learned not to worry about them
Living the happily ever after
'Cause see, that shit was built on a lie (Why her?)
So it's sure to fall, that's why I stand tall
Baby, baby, baby, can you tell me?
I just looked at him and said this right here

Why her? Why her?
Did I get on your nerves?
Did I give you too much
That you couldn't handle my love? (Oh, why?)
Why her? Why her?
Tell me what she was worth
To make you put her first
I'm listening (Why her?)
The grass looks greener on the other side (Why her?)
But I promise, you'll be back tonight
Now look at you, look at us, what's all this for?
Hope you got the answer to my question: Why her?
Ooh, ooh (Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)
Ooh, why her?
Ooh, oh, why her?
