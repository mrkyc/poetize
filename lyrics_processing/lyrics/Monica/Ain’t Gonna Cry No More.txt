Mmm
Da da da da dum
Mmm, mmm
Yeah, yeah
Oh-oh-oh, oh
Oh, whoa
Oh, can I talk to you for a minute?

Inseparable, that's how we were
Through anything, you were my world
I gave to you, you shared with me
For the love of you, I'd give anything
I would chill with you
You and your crew
Never complained 'bout the things you do
But it see it now, how it all went down
Can't take no more
Don't want you around

Never told me the whole truth (Never)
Now I'm wishing that I knew
The real you (How could you do this to me?)
Never hurt so much, I see
Plans I made for you and me
They can't be
These are the last tears that you'll see from me

'Cause I ain't gonna cry no more
'Cause I'm sick of you hurting me
I ain't gonna cry no more
'Cause you don't deserve me
I ain't gonna cry no more
Pack your stuff up and leave
I ain't gonna cry no more
'Cause I'm tired of you, me and she

And now I can't believe all the things you did
All your secret trips, just to see your kids
What about the crib that I've never been?
Is that the one that she lives in?
But soon you'll see, that the man he's not
The "un-love" affair will soon be forgot
And you will miss me, but I won't miss you
You can pull the key, 'cause now we're through

Never told me the whole truth
Never wishing that I knew the real you
(You didn't have to do what you did to me)
Never hurt so much, I see
Plans we made for you and me
They can't be
These are the last tears that you see from me
I ain't gonna cry no more
'Cause I'm sick of you hurting me
I ain't gonna cry no more
'Cause you don't deserve me
I ain't gonna cry no more (I ain't even gonna talk about it)
Pack your stuff up and leave (Just pack and leave)
I ain't gonna cry no more (And don't forget to leave me keys)
'Cause I'm tired of you, me and she (Oh)

Used to think that you and me were in love for sure
But I was wrong 'cause you led me on
But now I found I can do without you around
You gotta bounce
I'm tired

I ain't gonna cry no more (I ain't gonna cry)
'Cause I'm sick of you hurting me (I ain't gonna cry)
I ain't gonna cry no more (It's not the fact that it's your baby)
'Cause you don't deserve me (But it's the fact that you lied)
I ain't gonna cry no more (And it hurt me, yeah)
Pack your stuff up and leave (Pack your stuff and leave)
I ain't gonna cry no more ('Cause you don't mean me no good)
'Cause I'm tired of you, me and she (Oh Lordy)
I ain't gonna cry no more (So when you meet another guy)
'Cause I'm sick of you hurting me (And he's loving your lies)
I ain't gonna cry no more (Make sure that he right)
'Cause you don't deserve me (And he don't have a wife)
I ain't gonna cry no more (Oh no)
Pack your stuff up and leave (I, hey, hey, oh, whoa)
'Cause I'm tired of you, me and she (No no no no, no)
I ain't gonna cry no more
I'm sick of you
I'm through with you
I'm done with you
I'm tired of you (I ain't gonna cry no more)
I know what you do
I've tried (I ain't gonna cry no more)
I'm tired of your lies (I ain't gonna cry no more)
