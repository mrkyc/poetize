Monica, baby, I'm sorry
I know I was wrong, but I think we can work it out
Just try to hear me out
Nah, you hear me out

I gave you so much love, but you had to play with my affections
My heart was in your hands, but you had to play with all my feelings
You got your mack on, but now I'm gone
'Cause I'd rather be all alone
Away from all these silly games

Because I gave you no reason why
But you said to do your thing on the side
But now I'm gone
'Cause it will never be the same
You were busy kickin' it with your boys
Instead of taking care of your girl
But now I'm gone
Gone away from you (Ahh)

I thought I knew you well
But you ran away, didn't care about me
You told so many lies
Thought you could run away from this thing called reality
But I'm long gone, I gotta go on
There's someone waiting for me
To love me honestly
