Can't believe you would leave me this way
Feelin' kinda bad from the last things we said today
Can't believe you would turn and walk away
I know we would do this again and again

You say you love me, I'll come back with, "I hate you"
Only takes me a day to realize I'm in love with you
You say, "Oh, see ya", I'll come back with, "Just stay, boy"
If you don't want my love, then I have no choice this time
Yeah, yeah

Tell me, baby, what to do
I ain't trippin' over you
Any, any other time
Remember, I'm gone be fine
I, I remain the same
I don't know what's with you
Any, any other time
Remember, I'm gone be fine
