As we proceed to give you what you need
Likes sweet morning dew
I took one look at you
And it was plain to see
You were my destiny

We the big bank boys on the boulevard
Putting all the pretty girls into pretty cars
They shall not fuck with Rozay pockets
Feel the honey shots when I pop it
I feel for you, Vacheron on my arm
Twenty million Teflon Don, God bless
All the D boys on the rise
With my baby girl by my side, baby, baby

I've been looking for someone special for a long, long time
Someone that I can share my dream, someone I can call mine
And every night I'm wishing, hoping, that he's only getting closer
'Cause I'm, oh, I'm gonna find you, wanna know you

And I just wanna know if someone's out there
Somebody to hold, somebody who cares
And I'll do anything to find you (And when I do)
I won't let you go, no, no
I'll do anything to find you (And when I do)
I won't let you go, no, no, no (Let's go)

I've been there so many times from the guys in my past
And when I find somebody new, it don't never lasts
And every night I'm wishing, hoping, that he's only getting closer
'Cause I'm, oh, I'm gonna find you, wanna know you

When I just wanna know if someone's out there (I just wanna know)
Somebody to hold, somebody who cares (To hold)
And I'll do anything to find you (And when I do)
I won't let you go, no, no
I'll do anything to find you (And when I do)
I won't let you go, no, no, no

And I'm tired of being by myself
I need someone there, to give all of this love that I got
I'm open, won't you come inside?
Man, I promise that I will treat you better than right

Gotta know
Is he out there somewhere?
Is he out there waiting for me, for me?
Is he out there somewhere?
Is he out there waiting for me?
I just wanna know if someone's out there (Someone)
Somebody to hold, somebody who cares
And I'll do anything to find you (And when I do)
I won't let you go, no, no
I'll do anything to find you (And when I do)
I won't let you go, no, no, no
I just wanna know if someone's out there
Somebody to hold, somebody who cares (Who cares)
And I'll do anything to find you (And when I do)
I won't let you go, no, no
I'll do anything to find you (And when I do)
I won't let you go, no, no, no
