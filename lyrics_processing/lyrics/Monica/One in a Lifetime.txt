They say when you find the one
There'll be no second guessing
You'd feel it deep in your heart
You'll know that it was destined
The feelin' inside will let you know
Something that you can't deny, just let it grow
They say it's better to love then never love at all
To appreciate all the good, sometimes you gotta fall

But I was foolish, I shouldn't let you go
But now I miss you, I gotta let you know

I need you back, back in my life
I need your kiss, kiss in my life
And it's been so long since you've been gone
Baby, won't you come back home?
You only get one
One love, one in a lifetime
You only get one
One love, one in a lifetime

And I can't believe that I almost missed the signs
Right in front of my eyes
And now I know the love is real, it's hard to say why
You only get one, one love
One in a lifetime
And that one is you

They say that pleasure
Comes with pain
And I'm so used to being whole
It's hard to be half again
And you gotta feel the same way
My tears are steady fallin' like a pourin' rain
Tell me, will the forecast change?

If you love somebody, gotta let 'em know
Tomorrow's never promised, you gotta let it show
If you love somebody, you gotta let 'em know
Tomorrow's never promised, you gotta let it show

I need you back, back in my life
I need your kiss, kiss in my life
And it's been so long since you've been gone
Baby, won't you come back home?
You only get one
One love, one in a lifetime
You only get one
One love, one in a lifetime
Can't believe that I almost missed the signs
Right in front of my eyes
And now I know the love is real, it's hard to say why
You only get one
One love, one in a lifetime
And that one is you (That one)
And that one is you (That one)
And that one is you (That one)
And that one is you, is you

I will climb the highest mountain
Swim the deepest oceans for you, you, you
I would walk across the desert
Just to get that message to you, you, you ('Cause you're the one)
There ain't a thing in this world that I wouldn't do
Right hand to the man, boy, I'm tellin' the truth
So all my ladies, if you feel me, then put your hands up
For that one, for that one

You only get one
One love, one in a lifetime
You only get one
One love, one in a lifetime
And I can't believe that I almost missed the signs
Right in front of my eyes
And now I know the love is real, it's hard to say why
You only get one, one love
One in a lifetime
One in a lifetime

That one
That one
That one
That one

You only get one
One love, one in a lifetime
You only get one
One love, one in a lifetime

And I can't believe that I almost missed the signs
Right in front of my eyes
And now I know the love is real, it's hard to say why
You only get one
One love
One in a lifetime
One in a lifetime
