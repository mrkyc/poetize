Ooh, ooh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh

If he keeps changing for no shoes, I need two
Come right back at me alone again
Maybe I didn't need the use, out of him
Didn't come with no type of warranty

There's no one that I adore
More than your love
It hurts me more
To let you down
And again
There's no one
Who could ever
Show me the way to never
Try someone better than you, you

Should I take him back, after what he did?
Hurt me in ways that I can't begin to replace
How I feel, so I'll just go away (Ooh, ooh)
Should I take him back
After what he did?
Hurt me in ways that I can't begin to replace
How I feel, so I'll just go away (Yeah)

Does it every time he returns, there's no use
I'll just be the one left in the end

There's no one that I adore
More than your love
It hurts me more
To let you down
And again
There's no one
Who could ever
Show me the way to never
Try someone better than you, you

You ain't never treat me right
