It's sunny outside and I need somewhere to go
The day is just right and I wanna be with you for sure
So jump in your car, baby, and come over here
We can go wherever, sugar, I just want you near

So play me a melody, no matter what you find
Something to roll to, something to ease my mind, yeah
Just play me a melody, no matter what you find
Something to roll to when we're chilling in your ride

'Cause I love (I love) kickin' it with you
Me and you getting it on
So, baby, slide a tape in, boy
You know to play our song
Chillin', ridin' to the music
Laid back low
When I'm with you, oh-oh
When I'm with you

Dressed real fly, feeling just right for the weather
Drop top back, where we're gonna go? Don't know, wherever, woo
Maybe to the park, or we'll just roll down the highway
Just you and me, running to the beat makes me wanna say, baby
