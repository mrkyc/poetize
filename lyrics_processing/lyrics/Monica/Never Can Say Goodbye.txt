Oh, yes
Ooh, oh
I wanna do it
Oh, oh yeah

Baby, understand everything
There's no one else in my life
Maybe I can make you happy, baby
If I spend some time with you
Tell me, baby, baby, nothing's changed
I'm still in love with you
Don't be afraid, let me hold your heart
Control everything you do, oh

Baby, you know that I wouldn't do
Couldn't do anything to hurt you
But if you feel weak, don't you worry
'Cause I never can say goodbye, oh
Baby, you know that I couldn't do
Wouldn't live my life without you
But if you feel weak, don't you worry
'Cause I never can say goodbye
