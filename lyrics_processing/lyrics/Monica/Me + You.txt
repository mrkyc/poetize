Take a dollar, leave the change
I can hustle anything, call me Superman
Never lost anything, that means anything that I can't get back
Wake and bake, take a little break, then when we lay
You're the weight that brings me down
Late nights, early mornings, I got work but I ain't goin'
I'm callin' up

'Cause when I'm with you
The whole world stops (The whole world stops)
When I'm with you (I forget about)
I forget about
Everything (Everything), everything that's wrong
Everything (Everything), everything that I own
Everything, everything to the left
'Cause you're everything, everything that I am

Ooh, ooh, all I need is me plus you (You)
Ooh, ooh, all I need is me plus you

If I lost it all today, that's okay, if you stay, I'll take the minimum (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, yeah-yeah)
We get lit, start talkin' slick, start makin' flicks, that's cinema (Oh-oh)
Break up just to make up
We make up, there's no better love (Yeah)
And I don't see nobody else, yeah
We the only ones with us

The whole world stops (The whole world stops)
When I'm with you (When I'm, I forget about)

Everything (Everything), everything that's wrong
Everything (Everything), everything that I own
Everything, everything to the left

Ooh, ooh, all I need is me plus you (You)
Ooh, ooh, all I need is me plus you

Rockin' and rollin', twistin' and turnin' on ya (Ah)
Snatchin' your soul, puttin' this conjure on ya (Ah)
Baby, it's rainin' down on us (Ah)
I'm your Apollonia

'Cause when I'm with you (When I'm with you)
The whole world stops (The whole world stops right here)
When I'm with you
I forget about (I forget about, I forget about it)
Everything (Everything), everything that's wrong (Everything)
