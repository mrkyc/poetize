It's 'posed to be land of the free
I don't see how
Count me in, uh
America
Oh, America, yeah, ha-ha, ha-ha
America (America)
Sweet land of liberty, y'all

I'm doing this one for the struggle and every bad-doin' brother
Sister, daddy and mother who livin' in the gutter
Who want better cars and a better heart, another start
Your own yard and a place to park
You wanna trustin' wife and a better life
A bigger crib and a home-cooked meal every single night
Hell, I feel what you goin' through, but I coulda warned you
When it's time to be a man, do all you can, see other lands
And don't be livin' for the other man, take time out and settle in
Be the better man and closely watch your friends
And then you'll understand a lil' better then
But on the other hand, you so god damn stubborn
And you be startin' shit, and ever since you made president
We ain't even seen you since, you need to (You need to)
Fill our schools, rebuild our church and homes
And stop killin' my own kind, and leave my Earth alone
And stop tappin' my phone and searchin' my bro
And keep your personal feelings home when you bandin' my chrome
Do it for the weak and the strong, and to each his own
We do it for the main goals when all the heat is gone

This game wasn't told to me (Told to me), it was sold to me (Sold to me)
And we are never free (No), no way
Not in America (Not America)
Not America (Not in America, uh-uh)
Our country 'tis of thee ('Tis of thee), land of Liberty (Liberty)
But that'll never be (Never be, no), no way
Not in America (Uh-uh, not in this America)
Not in America (No)

You only got two bucks and give less than a fuck, then you a nigga
Got a nice home and a Lexus truck, you a nigga
World champions and you M.V.P., you a nigga
Four degrees and Ph. D., you still a nigga
To use your platinum card you need four IDs, then you's a nigga
If your skin is brown just like me, then you a nigga
Got a promotion and a fat-ass raise, you still a nigga
You from the islands and your peoples wasn't slaves, you a nigga
No matter how much your ass get paid, you still a nigga
Shot by the cops at a traffic stop 'cause you a nigga
That's why I hold toast too, I sell bi-coastal
International, they inter-catching you with satellites
In deep space, now, who invented niggas in the first place?
And said America's the original birthplace?
Who gettin' ten, twenty, life on they first case? My niggas
This game wasn't told to me (Told to me), it was sold to me (Sold to me)
And we are never free (No), no way
Not in America (Not America)
Not America (Not in America, uh-uh)
Our country 'tis of thee ('Tis of thee), land of Liberty (Liberty)
But that'll never be (Never be, no), no way
Not in America (Uh-uh, not in this America)
Not in America (No)

I'm doin' this one for the kids in the streets who ain't missed a beat
Do it for the deaf and the blind and those who don't eat meat
Do it for all the children of the corn and the unborn
Do it for the speedy trials and all the lies you done sworn
How you gon' keep the man? Old Mr. Crooked-ass Preacher Man
When your whole congregation drivin' a brand new Benz
And writing brand new sins, lyin' on many men
And all my brothers, sisters, them daddys and them doin' time in the pen

This game wasn't told to me (Told to me), it was sold to me (Sold to me)
And we are never free (No), no way
Not in America (Not America)
Not America (Not in America, uh-uh)
Our country 'tis of thee ('Tis of thee), land of Liberty (Liberty)
But that'll never be (Never be, no), no way
Not in America (Uh-uh, not in this America)
Not in America (No)
This game wasn't told to me (Told to me), it was sold to me (Sold to me)
And we are never free (No), no way
Not in America (Not America)
Not America (Not in America, uh-uh)
Our country 'tis of thee ('Tis of thee), land of Liberty (Liberty)
But that'll never be (Never be, no), no way
Not in America (Uh-uh, not in this America)
