You see the problem is them busta ass niggas you been fuckin' with
Always bought ya shit, but never taught ya shit
Did he ever tell you some things that a player do
And made you aware that life is more than a hairdoo
Boy, I tell ya: "Best to deal with them real niggas"
And stay far away from fuck niggas
Don't be a sucker, hell at least not from nothin'
All this suckin' and fuckin' a bitch better have somethin'
I need something that is compatible
Not nothin' young and dumb and full of cum, but one that's edible
I bet a, nigga like T Double
Get it wetter, suck and fuck 'em better than the average nigga
I need a girl that's into tryin' things
So I can put it in her mouth, fo' real ain't into mind games
I know she's a mama girl and I'm a street nigga
Once we get together, I'll bet you she'll sleep better

I'm like girl you better work it better
Like the full moon in June but pretty soon I'll be hurting it
Now turn around, let me calm you down
We go up and down, real niggas puts it down
I'm getting aquainted with the clitoris
I keep my hands to my sides, while I slowly spread the lips
I eats it up, 'fore I beats it up
The first quarter slow motion, second half, speed it up
Plus she already owe me one, she like

Being that I'm missing you, been having fantasies of kissing you

Or could it be that I'm falling in love
Or a possibility I'm way too far for a thug
I'll never tease you, I'm here to please you
And baby girl believe it, girl I'll never leave you
I'll be your freaky-deaky lover man
Making love forever, trying all the god damn numbers
When we, rubbing and touching each other
