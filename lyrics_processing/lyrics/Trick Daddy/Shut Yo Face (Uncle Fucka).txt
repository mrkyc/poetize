Big things on the big mane
Motherfuckers done lost they brain
This shit ain't fun

Gonna have to get the gun now
Gotta learn how to run now
Cuz you the one now

When they hanging out
Trying to play ya how to drain you out
Two shots rang you out
Tried to slide in the game, you out
Think it's the game about, shit
Ask or repeat anybody you know used to be big back in the day
They probably been in the grave or swore? from the heat of the cage
Them niggas is dead
