They sayin' I'm a Juggalo
Well, hell yeah I'm a motherfuckin' Juggalo, motherfucker!
I'm a motherfuckin' Jugga-lugga-lugga-lugga-luggalo, motherfucker!
A dead motherfucker!
Motherfucker, and we worldwide!

Zip codes, time zones
Every other day, a different state
But the Juggalo love remains the same

Every other day, a different state

Everywhere I go I get love, with occasional mean mugs
But like me some of them killers ain't nothin' but straight up street thugs and bustin' caps
As a product I was raised like this short tick of a clock
So I dance with a 12 gauge and blaze up like the song say
Do you feel like they come at you the wrong way?
Commence to let the bullets spray
I killed them haters so only love will exist
This is all I have and on my time is invested in this

Every day I wake up, I take the risk of being killed
Every time I sleep though, I may suffocate up in my pillow!
But there's haters in the woodwork, jealous of my success
Mad, 'cause I helped make scrubness kinda fresh
And the love we get is so much stronger than the hatred for us
It's strictly family love waitin' at them backstage doors
Our people are like underground mafia network of ninjas (Whoo!)
From cactus juice cocktails at campfires in the Carolinas
To the wet streets of London or behind a titty bar
Gettin' high with some Juggalos and their fuckin' funny-ass looking car
This shit cannot be removed, these times are forever stored
You hate me, it's cause you're moppin' floors while I'm rockin' tours
Quit cryin', bitch!

I was runnin' with my hatchet, down at beach in Orlando
See some Juggalos cookin' scrimp in they sandals
I was runnin' with the hatchet on the shores of Seattle
Juggalos bumpin' DL, making the floor rattle
I was deep in the smoky mountains and ran out of gas
Some juggalos came through, even gave me two blunts out his stash
I was hanging out in Worchester, chillin' at the bar
Had too much to drink, a 'lette drove me to the car
The road is my home, sometimes it feels that way
Rollin' on a tour bus for months and weeks, I can't complain
They show me love in every state like one of the greats, it's my time
Been on the scene puttin' it down since '99 (Eastside!)
I hope you understand I do this for you and your mans
To ride, to bump, to smoke, come through
Drink your fill and pick you up or  if you want to
It's all love

Ridin' through A-Z, stop in Tempe
Met a Juggalo in Compton, now I'm in southern Cali
Passin' through the town of Chicago, I hit the dark streets
Listen at the darkest hour, hear 'em bumpin' our beats
Out in New York City, they be runnin' with a hatchet
Seen a Juggalo rollin' blunts, you know I had to match it
High up in the Colorado mountains, up the river
With 5 'lettes naked, all fuckin' and cookin' dinners
