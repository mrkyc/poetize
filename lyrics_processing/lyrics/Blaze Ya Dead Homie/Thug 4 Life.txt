I was a G in life, I'm still a G in death
And if you think I'm not a thug, don't hold your breath
My name is Blaze, and I roll with Anybody Killa
Drive-By on this bitch, you bitch nigga!
All you scary bitches, shut up and go inside
All my thug motherfuckers, come on, we bout to ride
Real G's in my hood don't be fuckin' around
You gotta be a clique thick before the sun goes down
You could get yo' life took smart mouth, dirty looks
By the product of the streets, hood G's and crooks
With a double-barrel shotgun pressed to your eye
I want what's mine and I'mma say it one more time
I want what's mine and I'mma leave with nothing less
For the three fuckin' slugs that I took in the chest
No rest for the killers equipped with mean mugs
Who know what it's like to be a motherfuckin' thug?

Niggas and hoes, bitches ain't shit
All you haters, you can suck this dick
Who know what it's like to be a thug for life
Be a thug for life, be a thug for life
Niggas and hoes, bitches ain't shit
All you haters, you can suck this dick
Who know what it's like to be a thug for life
Be a thug for life, be a thug for life

Late night, gettin' high
Thinkin' in my mind, hopin' everything's gonna be alright
Situations drive me insane, now who's to blame?
Need someone who's down for me and not the fame
Is there anyone that I can trust in this fucked up world?
Reminiscin' of the bitchin' that you gave me girl
I'm all alone, just me and my microphone
With the urge to do a drive-by
Ever since the day homie came back alive
Throw ya hands up in the sky, if you can feel me
Roll it up and let's get high!, if you can hear me
Anybody Killa's comin' for real and it's the raw deal
Keep ya hands low or watch ya cap get peeled
Where ya gonna be when the phantom's floating after ya (In the zone muthafucka!)
People running, dead men gunning
Ya better watch your back, the juggalo with the hatchet is coming

Niggas and hoes, bitches ain't shit
All you haters, you can suck this dick
Who know what it's like to be a thug for life
Be a thug for life, be a thug for life
Niggas and hoes, bitches ain't shit
All you haters, you can suck this dick
Who know what it's like to be a thug for life
Be a thug for life, be a thug for life
Who the hardest, runnin' in a gang of two?
Down a 40 of formeldahyde and wax ya whole crew
Cuz ain't nobody seein' me on any fuckin' street
True thug, keep it real with the heat
Hittin' licks on the low cuz I'm lowdown
Dirty dog from the casket and underground
But I never sleep, and we still got beef
When suckas recognize Drive-By, we murder muthafuckas!

Man, where ya gonna be 10 years from now?
Swimming in the gates of hell sayin' that you was down
Misunderstood and outta control
The microphone relieve's stress
So I'mma do my best to impress
Every single human being that's involved with me
Time for Drive-By to take em' where their eyes can see
Juggalos, wave yo' hands from side to side
Juggalettes, show them titties if ya fuckin' tonight

Niggas and hoes, bitches ain't shit
All you haters, you can suck this dick
Who know what it's like to be a thug for life
Be a thug for life, be a thug for life
Niggas and hoes, bitches ain't shit
All you haters, you can suck this dick
Who know what it's like to be a thug for life
Be a thug for life, be a thug for life
Niggas and hoes, bitches ain't shit
All you haters, you can suck this dick
Who know what it's like to be a thug for life
Be a thug for life, be a thug for life
Niggas and hoes, bitches ain't shit
All you haters, you can suck this dick
Who know what it's like to be a thug for life
Be a thug for life, be a thug for life
