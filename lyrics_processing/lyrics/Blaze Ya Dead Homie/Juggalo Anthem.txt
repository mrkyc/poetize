Killas kick the anthem like this
Juggalos up in this bitch, up in this bitch
Killas kick the anthem like this
Juggalos up in this bitch, Blaze...

G's up, ridin' from the cradle to the casket
And beyond, recognize thug shit
Poundin' out the trunk bitch (Yeah...)
Runnin' wit' a mother fuckin' hatchet
You haters, you suck dick
Was a thug, became a G
B to the L to the A, Z, E, still dead
Still don't give a fuck (Give a fuck!)
Sportin' all black khakis with the motherfuckin' cuffs up
Smokin' hella trees, tryin' to make a couple G's
So a thug can get back on his feet
Mean muggin', steady thuggin'
And I'm tryin' to find the hood rats all about fuckin'
Still loked out
All my dawgs from the past, dead or smoked out
Still tryin' to come up on a lick for a phat-ass ride
So I can drop the top, and parlay through the east side

You might also like
Bitches freeze (Freeze!), you ain't a thug or a G or a banga' (No!)
You's a studio gangsta
You ain't about shit, scared to pull the trigga
That's what we call, a real bitch nigga (Bitch nigga!)
Sneakin' through the hood, throwin' up a set
Hangin' out the window, yellin' idle threats (What?)
Check this out, I'm a check your chin
Close your mouth, 'fore I put the barrel in
Dumpin' clips in your ass is what I'm all about
Straight G from the clique on a paper route (Paper route!)
Still slappin' off fake bitches with the Louisville
Beat a nigga to the pavement, another bitch killed

This is the battle for the planets (Boo-yah!)
We bring the thunder, given half the advantage (Uh-huh!)fuck a style and a status
Half of y'all hummin' off a half ass deal
And got the nerve to tell a mother fucker "keep it real"
We see through y'all fools, like cellophane on the square pack
You bite our shit, you can keep it, we don't want it back
We don't give a fuck, eastside for life
And if you ain't got heart, don't expect to have your shit tight (Eastside!)
There ain't no room for the ho-hearted
We give a fuck where you at, or who you with, or how you got started
Fuck you and everybody in your clique
If you don't run with a hatchet or claim the Psychopathic
I ain't got time to say no names
It's only 8 rhymes, know how long we been in the game
Besides fuck even speakin' your name, you're just a bitch in the game (Bitch!)
And y'all niggas gone' always be the same!
