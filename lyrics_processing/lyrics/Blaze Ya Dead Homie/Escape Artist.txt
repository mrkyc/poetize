I try to feel the sunshine while standing in the rain (In the rain)
You try to hold me down with all your restraints (I'll escape)
I try to feel the sunshine while standing in the rain (In the rain)
You try to hold me down with all your restraints (I'll escape)
I try to feel the sunshine while standing in the rain (In the rain)
You try to hold me down with all your restraints (I'll escape)

I'm the greatest escape artist, the hardest situation is getting free
From the terror that keeps confining me, I gotta be
Better than Houdini and David Blaine with no magician
No illusions, no subliminal hypnosis to your brain, I'm untrained
Children shouldn't try this at home at all
I'm a free lance professional, and this is all my fault
I staged the whole bit, I drink and talk a little shit
And see who got the balls to pull a strap and really use it
That's where the fun comes in 'cause after they pop me
They gotta hide my body so no one's suspicious about who shot me
It's interesting to see the means and the tactics they take
To make sure that my death is tucked away nice and safe

I try to feel the sunshine while standing in the rain (In the rain)
You try to hold me down with all your restraints (I'll escape)

Sunshine's for suckers and squares
That's what they told me as they rolled me in the carpet
And threw me over the bridge just like I was some garbage
Of course I was unconscious not dead in the sense they thought I was
But a slug in your dome will get you caught up 'cause
I'm not invincible, I could die a million times
Each time more painful than the first, still I survive
Both hands are tied behind my back
As I'm breathing dirty water, my legs are been mauled to death by the sewer rats
I move erratically to make them work for their meal
By dislocating my shoulders I slip out just like banana peel
I'm close to drowning again, ten minutes and counting each of them
Is my record so I'm feeling like I'm ahead
In points, lost a few from the rats, but it's all good
Best believe that your boy will be back to walk the neighborhood
In no time water logged and bullet ridden
They be like, "I can't believe that he did it, he really escaped?"

 I done fucked with some gangstas, not no bitch-ass wankstas
But some real gangstas fed my legs into a woodchipper
But the blades got caught on my bones 'cause I woke up screamin'
And noticed that my right foot and leg was gone
My eye popped out the socket and dangling on the cheek
They must have strangled me to sleep 'cause I'm unable to speak
I must have screamed just inside of my head, 'cause they still think that I'm dead
They using a shovel to scrape away clumps of the red
From out the chipper, then pop my legs out
So they can chop me up manually bag me up and throw me out
No sweat, give me a week and a roll of some duct tape
And a shovel to dig the rest of my body up and I'm straight
I try to feel the sunshine while standing in the rain (In the rain)
You try to hold me down with all your restraints (I'll escape)

I must make it to the wishing well
The well to make a wish
And once I am there, a penny I spare
In hopes of these sins you forgive
With vultures all calling, in wait of my falling
Victim to this horrible wind
I arrive just in time, it must be a sign
