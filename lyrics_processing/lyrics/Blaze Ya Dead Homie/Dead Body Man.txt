Dead bodies, dead homies all over the streets
Fifty-five or sixty-five of us at least
I hang with the dead 'til the break of dawn
And fantasize of dead bitches when I'm hittin' the bong
I'd grab 'em by they ass and hump 'em 'til I'm cummin'
Dead homie loving that dead bitch fuckin'
Her neden tastes like chicken, deep fried
I pumped her fifty timesand then I busted in her eye
I just ate my first dead bitch last week
Still got a pussy hair caught up in my teeth
Before you start yelling and cursing my name
Remember somethings wrong with my brain, insane
Second I was born, doctor held me in his hands
Looked over to the nurse and motioned for the garbage can
Was cold and shaking like a bowl of Jell-O
And my moms was like, "Oh my God! Hello?"
He said I was born from a cemetery place
Chillin' with a hatchet and a Juggalo face
I know I'm not alive, I don't think you understand
I'm just a dead body man

You can call me the, call me the dead body man
Body man, body man, I'm the dead body man

Dead bodies, dead homies in the back of the hearse
With bumps so loud that ya ear drums burst
I ride through ya neighborhood bumpin' my shit
Great Milenko, Mostasteless, and my first EP, bitch
Some line up on the corners of blocks
Where they slang dime bags of heron and crack rocks
It's all good, everybody gotta eat
But a keep ya bitch ass outta my streets
I mash through the east side knockin' the bass
Chillin' with my freaks and I'm pickin' her face
Maggots and bugs like to crawl on her head
'Cause my bitch is dead, I'd rather that instead
Of a ho you can't trust with a dick in they butt
A dead body bitch learn to keep her mouth shut
Chillin' in the back are my dead homies too
Which means they don't got nothing on the trees and brew
If you think i'm sick, take a look at yourself
Ya got dead deer heads up on ya shelf
On ya key chain is a little baby rabbit's hand
And I'm still the dead body man

You can call me the, call me the dead body man
