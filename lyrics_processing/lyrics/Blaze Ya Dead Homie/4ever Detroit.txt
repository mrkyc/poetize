DJ Clay, what up doe
This your man Awesome Dre
Reppin' that Let 'Em Bleed, Volume 2
You know how we do, yeah, all day
Got Blaze Ya Dead Homie
My man Violent J
Yo, check this shit yo, we forever Detroit, yo

E-e-east side, W-w-west side
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
E-e-east side, W-w-west side
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I rep the city like a giant, I'm defiant 'til the very end
Offense plus statistics and defense breeds champions
I'm a Bad Boy from the 80s, chillin' with Chuck Daly
Sippin' Mai Tais, watching Carmen Harlan speak on crack babies
Left in garbage cans like every Lions season
The stadium stays packed tight when we all know they losin'
The beat of the heart ain't it cautious in the music
From Motown to the Label Beneath the Streets, and we prove it
We the renaissance, the rebirth, the product's back for more to hurt
We sellin' out of joints in the 'hood, we never out of work
Forever Detroit, born and bred like Better Made
From the East to the Southwest side with DJ Clay
It's all day, the CDs stay on play
Bend curbs on Woodward on the way to see the Wings game
It's ya homie Blaze, Awesome Dre, and Violent J
Forever Detroit blood pumpin' through our veins

My veins trek through my body like the map of Detroit
I'm everything in between Dearborn and Eastpointe
I'm the old train station and the new Ford Field
I'm everything they demolished and all that they built
Detroit forever everyday from DJ Los to Clay
I'm immune to the poisonous skies of Delray
See me cruisin' down Seven Mile or drunk at Harpos
Queuin' on Belle Isle, fuckin' hoes when the park close
I'm the Hip Hop Explosion with Reggie Hotmix
The Merciless Ameer and AWOL, you don't want none of this
Forever Southwest where bitches asses got bottom
Cutlass' on 24s, on every corner we got 'em
My mother was a housekeeper out in Beverly Hills
And she did it for me to feed my belly the meals
Now I'm strong like Detroit City, fall I will never
With Blaze and Awesome Dre, we be Detroit forever

Detroit, Awesome Dre, 12th Street and the Boulevard
Forever hard, four blocks quick to pull ya card
Also Fenkell, Wyoming still holdin' down
Puritan, 6 Mile, 7 Mile, still holdin' ground
We got people all across the city
From Lahser to Gratiot, motherfucker we gets gritty
Forever Detroit like The Wizard and Mojo
The Auto Show, snow blizzard at Cobo
The festivals on the river, Hart Plaza
Belle Isle, Rouge Park, and Chandler
I stay forever Detroit like patent leather Timbs
Max Juliens, Gandalfs, and sheepskins
Errol Flynns, Eminems, BKs, and Best Friends

Rhyme pays, it's Blaze, Violent J, and Clay
It's forever Detroit, this Awesome Dre
