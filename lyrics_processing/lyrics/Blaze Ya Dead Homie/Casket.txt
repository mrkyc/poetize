Do you wanna know about the box, a casket with padlocks
Broken off the hinge, bitch, eat a cock
Buried in the earth then forgotten about
Feelin' good like a motherfucker first day out
Took air in my lungs, been awhile since I did so
Smoked me a blunt, fucked a hood rat ho
Killed a couple niggas, smacked a couple bitches
Runnin' motherfuckers for they whips and they riches
Ain't shit changed but the month and year
Broke motherfuckers scrounging for squares and beer
Pigs scatter on the street when the dead man arise
Real motherfuckin' killas never gon' die

(Help me!) In the casket, in the casket (Buried six feet deep)

Sleepin' in the casket, awoke by a strange sound
Painful screams arise up from the cold ground
I could be dreamin', what the fuck is with my head?
Six feet deep, and I'm surrounded by the dead
I hear a noise, someone's cryin' my name (Blaze! Blaze!)
How should I react? Am I just goin' insane?
All my thug niggas hold it down on the streets
And watch these motherfuckers on they grave robbin' spree
Froze in a box, hearin' people chatter up above (Help me)
Can't say a damn thing (Kick the do' up?) I'm still stuck
I'm dead, that's it, I know where I'm at now
Chillin' with the dead, run with the underground
So why these niggas out fuckin' with my grave?
I got a maggot face and my skin's decayed
Break through the door to unlock the mystery
That my grave plot holds in for my eternity

The door swings open, pulled upon by a force
Lay my body on the ground, slam the casket door
Crowded by robed figures and the grave digger
And the shadow of the demon, gettin' bigger
Comin' for my soul, surrounded me with candles
Came to release me to his handles
First sacrifice offer to the demons
That's why I'm a killa any season
They watched me close when I was alive
And was happy with a motherfucker 'til the day I died
Now they callin' me back to walk with the dead
Anyone disagree catch a slug to the head
A motherfucker come equipped with a shotgun
And maggots on my face, so run bitch run
Dead man hauntin', no time for escape
When you hear the gun cock, bitch, it's too late
