(I'm just tryna fit up in the new game
Miss me with the bullshit you're all the same
I'm just gonna try to be me
Keep it triple o, triple o, triple og)
I'm just tryna fit in with the new game
Miss me with the bullshit you all the same
I'm just gonna try to be me
Keep it juggalo triple o, triple og

Blaze and I'm back with the hot shit
For your ear holes or the shit that is not it
Make it clear bro I am not with the new kids
I'm focused stay up on me
Not concerned with what you did
I'm a deadite with a dead face
I'ma raise hell I'ma dark cloud
In the bright skys from the old spell
The king is back crown em up an bow down
That's a fact eternity I've been around
Ain't nothing different they say I'm extra
Explicit and focusing on my business
An backhanding all these bitches um
You bitches kill me 2 phony 2 ever feel me
2 lonely 2 ever really be down with family
Silly psycho bullet holes for enemies an hoes
I'ma remain a juggalo triple o, triple o
I done seen people come into fame overnight
An the loosest of the loose telling people
That they tight
