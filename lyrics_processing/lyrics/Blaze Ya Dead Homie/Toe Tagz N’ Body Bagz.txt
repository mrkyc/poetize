Toe tags, body bags
Toe tags, body bags
Toe tags, body bags

Toe tags, body bags, dead body, cold slab
Embalm the body after the autopsy
No blood, just formaldehyde
The outcome of homicide or suicide
Pine box, dressed in your Sunday best
Got a single white rose layin' off on your chest
Close the open casket, ain't no comin' back
Like a one-way ticket, be it coach or first class
Like a trip to the otherside, soaked in all black
Time to face facts, lay you flat, I'ma get back
I flip that, call it all a mishap
Then bag up your body with tags so they don't mismatch

Toe tags, body bags, I'ma put you on a slab
Toe tags, body bags, zip your ass up in a bag
Toe tags, body bags, I'ma put you on a slab
Toe tags, body bags, zip your ass up in a bag

Tag 'em and bag 'em and drag' em into the underground
Collect, preserve, use discretion, and never make a sound
Floorboards squeak, but the dead don't speak
They marinate in the fruit cellar for up to 3 weeks
Till they're ripe for pickin' and they get plucked and tucked
'Tween the walls like insulation where they remain stuck
Forced to listen to other victims gettin' the same
'Cause the art is consistent, so it's performed in the same way

Hefty cinch sack, 50 gallon or more
Available in any home improvement or grocery store
I buy 'em by the palette and fill my trunk with bodies
Three fat, two skinny old men and stacked hotties
I tag 'em on the toe so only I will know
How I killed 'em and the reason that they came here for
Got so many, got a library, A through Z
All buried beneath the lights of my H-O-M-E

Toe tags, body bags, I'ma put you on a slab
Toe tags, body bags, zip your ass up in a bag
Toe tags, body bags, I'ma put you on a slab
Toe tags, body bags, zip your ass up in a bag

Linda and Larry and Laura, we got most of the L's
Twenty or thirty or more as we dig into hell
Tunnels and caverns underneath the abode
Deeper in the ground, so the body remains cold
With copies of toe tags, man I treat it like a receipt
There's a copy for you, copy for me; customer policy
I run a business and this hobby's not a game
It's a passion for the art normal people would call insane
This , duct tape, toe tags, dead weight
Two on the porch, one more in the crawlspace with no face
Looking at me but I hear' em at night
Crawlin' through the walls trying to rob me of my own life
Toe tags, body bags, I'ma put you on a slab
Toe tags, body bags, zip your ass up in a bag
Toe tags, body bags, I'ma put you on a slab
Toe tags, body bags, zip your ass up in a bag
Toe tags, body bags, I'ma put you on a slab
Toe tags, body bags, zip your ass up in a bag
Toe tags, body bags, I'ma put you on a slab
Toe tags, body bags, zip your ass up in a bag
