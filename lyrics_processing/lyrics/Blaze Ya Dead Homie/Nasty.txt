Yo Blaze you so nasty
You know you nasty
Man, you so nasty
You know you nasty
Yo Blaze you nasty

Scabs and bubble gum, peanut butter on the toe nail
Flickin' boogers in your ginger ale
Itch my taint, bust it in your face
Didn't wipe my butt, so now it's kinda itchay
Drink douche bags like wine coolers
And throw gang signs for all the old schoolers
I stuck an AK in a hood rat booty
'Cause I found out she was a groupie
If I blow ass, you gonna know fast
All y'all gon' need a fuckin' gas mask
I'm the yellow shit underneath your armpit
And when I talk, snacks fly, 'cause I spit
I'm like clay, wet, smelly and gray
I wore the same clothes forever and a day
Now you can hate me and try to say I'm trashy
And if you go and ask somebody, they'll tell ya that I'm nasty

You nasty Blaze, you nasty (That I'm nasty)
You nasty Blaze, you nasty
You nasty Blaze, you nasty
You nasty, nasty, you nasty, nasty
You nasty Blaze, you nasty
You nasty Blaze, you nasty
You nasty Blaze, you nasty
You nasty, nasty, you nasty, nasty

I'll use Anybody Killa rubber, after him (Here)
I ain't payin' shit and condoms costin'
Mo' money, and not enough feel
Word to ya neden, I'm just tellin' the deal
I suck the pus out my own pimples
And spit it on yo ass and fill up the dimples
I'm the lint in ya belly button
Fuzzy like Moe, ain't that somethin'?
I like to fuck chickens, then 'cue 'em
Barbecue sauce on my balls just for screwin' 'em
I go swimmin' in a port-a-potty
And have shit and piss on my face and body
I like to party with my pants off
When my dick gets hard, smack it, it'll go soft
I'll suck the blood, out a tampon
I'm nasty as the mother fuckin' ground that I stand on
"Only if you standin' in a pile of shit!"

You nasty Blaze, you nasty (You nasty) (Motherfucker!)
You nasty Blaze, you nasty (You know you nasty)
You nasty Blaze, you nasty (Man, you so nasty) (Yeah)
You nasty, nasty, you nasty, nasty (You know you nasty)
You nasty Blaze, you nasty (Yo Blaze you nasty)
You nasty Blaze, you nasty (You know you nasty)
You nasty Blaze, you nasty (Man, you so nasty)
You nasty, nasty, you nasty, nasty (You know you nasty)
I stay funky like a doo chip, I wipe
Snot on your best friend little sister pussy lip
I got mice sleepin' in the holes in my back
I tried to evict 'em, they said fuck that!
Dirt under fingernails, wounds don't heal
Scrape on my double burger, value meal
Dick suck some hookers, with no teeth
They still got lips and loopy-ass cheeks
I'm the melted ice cream covered in ants
Got dried blood and guts on my favorite black pants
This one freaky bitch tried to piss on me
So I shit on her, so that she can see
That killas don't swing like that
So I opened the neden real wide, and I stuffed in a rat
Why you think all the hood rats ask me
"Blaze why the fuck is you so damn nasty?"

You nasty Blaze, you nasty (You nasty) ('Cause I'm nasty)
You nasty Blaze, you nasty (You know you nasty) (Flat the fuck out, I'm nasty)
You nasty Blaze, you nasty (Man, you so nasty)
You nasty, nasty, you nasty, nasty (You know you nasty)
You nasty Blaze, you nasty (Yo Blaze you nasty)
You nasty Blaze, you nasty (You know you nasty)
You nasty Blaze, you nasty (Man, you so nasty)
You nasty, nasty, you nasty, nasty (You know you nasty)
