Look out, bustin' and runnin'
Look out, raid, raid

I hear a siren, you know what that means, the boys in blue is on their way
And people duckin' in and out to find a safe place to hideout
But not me, I'm standin' in full view of the street
Steady waitin' on the police
They can never capture me, their attempts to trap me are useless
And the army of dead I command are far more ruthless
When your SWAT team with snipers on every roof top scopin'
And the team leader barkin' out orders to throw the smoke in
You know you gon' forfeit, like Aaliyah said, I'm one in a million
And sometimes you can't comprehend the shit I'm feelin'
But thats okay, I'm reloadin'
And fully prepared to bust your skull open
Got you stripped down like a bitch at the bar searchin' for tips
 got the shakes 'cause he can't afford a hit
I'm a G in every sense of the word, my game is 
So I mash a motherfuckin' pig like a jelly donut

Look out! The police is comin'
Got me runnin' through the crack house bustin' and runnin'
(Get in!) Look out, 'cause I don't wanna get sprayed
Y'all better lay it down 'fore your ass catch a stray
I got a blunt in my right hand, a gun in my left
Takin' shots at the cops, either jail or death
I'm already dead, you can't kill me
And I ain't goin to the pen, bitch, it's Colton Grundy

I jumped in the caddy on the way to the dope house
I see the red and blue, hold up, time out
Who they fuckin' with? I'm a G
With a trunk full of dope and heavy artillery
Pull your vehicle to the side of the road!
Oh y'all think I'm playing? Well, ya'll just don know
You better run the plate, check who you fuckin' with
Or get found on the side of the road in a ditch
East side, bitch boy, what the fuck you thought
Stop fuckin wit these killers, we'll blow ya head off
We some hustlas, tryna get rich quick
Get money wit the boss and cop our own shit
Motherfucker for real I'm just lettin' you know
Fuck wit a dead man, that's your funeral
So when you pull up on a G wit a hatchet in the window
Take yo ass to the coffin shop, bitch ass po po

Look out! The police is comin'
Got me runnin' through the crack house bustin' and runnin'
(Get in!) Look out, 'cause I don't wanna get sprayed
Y'all better lay it down 'fore your ass catch a stray
I got a blunt in my right hand, a gun in my left
Takin' shots at the cops, either jail or death
I'm already dead, you can't kill me
And I ain't goin to the pen, bitch, it's Colton Grundy
Why you still followin' me? I get W-2 to pay my taxes
You gonna make a motherfucker have some relapses
The red, white, and blues have been known to set me off
And you about to fall victim to the Molotov (Cocktail)
The smell is foul and overwhelming
While you burninin' and you cruisin', your lights is meltin'
Why can't I be dead, have a bitch, and enjoy dinner
Without one a y'all motherfuckers botherin' me callin' me a sinner
But I'm not, (Nope) I'm a dead body from the block
And ain't nobody young ain't pushin' rocks
I'm a grown up, not in the sense that you accustom
I graduate from 22's to the 9's that I'm bustin'
At you, I empty the clip on the cops who testin'
And leave 'em lyin 'dead in the intersection
You want beef? You got it, homeboy, it's what I'm servin'
Take the safety off your gun 'cause I know that your nervous
