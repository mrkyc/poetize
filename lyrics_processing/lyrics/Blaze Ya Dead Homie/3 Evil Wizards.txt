They call me Martin Broad Cloak right hand to the good man
The sorcerer supreme for the king Randall Flagg understand
I ain't no Stephen Strange punk, save the suckas like a chump
Got to light my second sight, my vision's bright of in the night
Speak in tongues like lord Voldemort
Hit you with a cruciatus spell just for sport
Done my puppet in every action
Bending your body in a ways you never thought could happen
And I'm laughing, that's for pure satisfaction
I shape shift to a snake like tossing doom
And hypnotize a party while I slither around the room
Scope you with my third eye, on a first try
Cross paths with the three evil wizards and you'll die

(We blow your mind) Three evil wizards
Coming at you like sorcerers, wicked sorcerers
(Kabada kabuda kaba, let fire raze the sky)
(We blow your mind) Three evil wizards
Coming at you like sorcerers, wicked sorcerers
(Kabada kabuda kaboom, you face impeding doom)

My powers passed to unknown, my magic from the freak zone
I keep it underground and practice hexes with the rat bones
Some people say that I'm half possessed
'Cause I'm ninja like and have no regrets
I'm the sorcerer with the wand that chops
I can move real quick 'cause I will not stop
Even can try your best, but you won't achieve
When it comes to the mind tricks of us three
My wisdom's tough, the orbs affair
My energy from the passed on is here
I got the moon and the stars
Lined with the Earth so your journey far
So ease yourself, take it slow
And let the voodoo take control
We'll keep you in a body tramp, eternity's what it will last
Once I blow some killa dust in your face you ain't comin' back
I told you that I'm crazy, with a soul of a warrior knight
I'm a hundred and ten but I can end the world with just one fucking strike

My beard long, white as snow
Shave every week, back it grow
Spells I know 'em, hex I throw 'em
I wear a lucha mask from a Mexico, um
I used to pump gas at Texico
I'm big like Biggie but I'm sexy though
I drink Faygo, fuck PepsiCo
Me and you thumpin' I'll stretch your throat
I got a magic wand and two crystal balls
For every princess within the walls
Of every castle on every land
My sorcery skills are in demand
I hex, hoax, my joker jokes
With spells and curses, hokus pokus
Potions, voodoo, blow the smoke in
Pull the ropes, don't hold it, folks
Mirror of trapping, green slime
I'm an evil wizard with a mean rhyme
With skill to walk in between time
He said "well everything seem fine"
And poof, now you know the truth
There's the proof, don't lose a tooth
Three evil wizards, sorcerers
You don't like black magic? More for us
