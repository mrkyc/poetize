Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ayy, ha
Thugger Thugger, my brother, brother
These niggas in trouble, trouble
Yeah, yeah

Hey, boy, you green as a soldier
I cashed out, it ain't stolen
Hey, got that gold Rollie poly
On my wrist, I can tote it
With my wrist I can roll it, hey
That pistol stay fully loaded
I take your necklace then sport it
I got your bitch, she all on me, hey
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, hey
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, hey, yeah (Hey)

I walked in with a forty
I talk nothin' but money
YSL the rich homies
I put that old school on buttons
Don't come if you ain't fuckin'
Fuck nigga, no, I can't trust him
Lil Scrappy, yo' head, I bust it
I was trappin', I couldn't get busted
Had packages on them buses
I'm rappin', I came from nothin'
I got 'em like, "What, what? Ayy"
Money on your head, nigga, so don't play (With who?)
With me, I stay with a Glock forty G every day
Thugger still ridin' with the chop
Red on the beam, won't stop me from shootin' you

At the concert, show 'em you clap it like Magnolia
Ooh, you need to show 'em you the best at what you do (Turn up, turn up)
I just took off, I'm on a mountain, girl, no Dew (Turn up, turn up)
Ooh, she said she wanna party (What?)
Young Quan voice, I leave these bitches with no choice
I don't eat pork, I drink Smartwater like a dork (Woo)
I'm not blowin' my money, lil' nigga, I'm not Scott Storch (Woo)
