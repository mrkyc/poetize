She don't like Atlanta, so I flew her to the coast

Shawty got a bad attitude, but I ain't mad at her
Fat ass, lookin' like she knew I took a grab at it
Scream ass, runnin' through the school, took a stab at 'em
Molly fool dabbin', college school classin'
All this Louis V, I feel like "Coming to America"
With being 'bout we ain't even rich, frosted like we cereal
Talk loud, I ain't hearin' ya, these niggas delirious
This a Lamborghini, no Ford, but I know George and I'm curious
Curiosity killed the cat, I heard that
A couple of bags, a couple of packs, I served that
And If I said it, I can't take my word back
From East Atlanta all the way to Old Nat

She don't like Atlanta, so I flew her to the coast
She ain't like that Bentley, so I bought that ho a ghost
She ain't like the rest, boy, I swear that ho on go
She don't do the less, boy, I swear she do the most
I swear she do the most, she do the most, she do the most
I swear she do the most, she do the most, she do the most, she do the most
I said now she ain't like that Bentley, so I bought that ho a ghost
She ain't from Atlanta, so I flew her to the coast
Boy, I swear she do the most, the most, the most, the most, the most
She do the most, she do the most

How does it feel to make a mil
When you ain't even signed yet?
I'm sittin' here like fuck a deal
Cause it ain't even crossed my mind yet
I know that I gotta feed my family
No matter the circumstances you gotta keep them happy, yeah
When the money gone, who there? Aye
When the money gone, who cares? Aye, nobody
Keith Sweat voice, that check get her moist
