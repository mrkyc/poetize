Izze the Producer

They throwin' rocks and hide their hands, I ain't surprised
I don't stand in traps I no longer supervise
I thank God every night before I close my eyes
Beefin' with them niggas, shot at them like three times (Three times)
If I'm wrong then I don't wanna be right (No way)
Got my phone in the back of my Levi's
And I still don't trust no bitch 'cause at the end, she lied
I got these hundred in the safe, stacked up knee high
Fuckin' hoes gettin' old, gettin' money ain't new
Shawty thinkin' I'ma business man 'cause she seen Homie in a suit, huh
Top drop at anytime, need a GPS for the roof
And I don't really like no nigga who talk a lot, rather show me what you gon' do, huh
Parallel in the parking lot, I'm rollin' smoked out in the coupe
Got these hundred dollar bills in rubber bands 'cause I don't like to carry money loose
Got a couple bands on these niggas' head, if I say the word, they gon' shoot
And I ain't beefin' with no nigga 'bout no bitch, to me, that ain't cool
It's too much money to be made out here, yeah
Gotta keep my gun, it ain't safe out here
Been stayin' down, can't show my face 'round here
And I ain't trippin' cut the lights out
Got this cross on my chest and you know it's iced out

Talk hard, pipe down
Shootin' shit, head target
Dead friend, red carpet
I can't hear you nigga money anyway, say it louder
Talk loud, nah, nigga
Money in the wall with a tracker on the phone just in case you wanna call a nigga
I'm paranoid, geeked up
I see dead people
I see you before you comin', I'm lookin' through the peephole

The G code, yeah, you know I'm stickin' to it
Turn the volume up on these headphones, I wanna listen to it
Keep the chopper, yeah, in the back, man, and let the pistol do it
Can't close my eyes, gotta face my fear just grip and do it
Stick and move, you know I'm stickin' to what we planned
He sick of losin', I heard he spent all of his advance
Feel like a movie, I walked in feelin' just like the man
On every move I hit, I make sure I had my mask
Right hand truth, I swear I will never take the stand
I swear I shoot, just look at the blisters on my hand
Shine bright, headlight
I gotta make the transaction if you got the bread right
This cross make me feel like
