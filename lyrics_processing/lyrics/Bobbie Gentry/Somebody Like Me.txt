Why? How could you fall this time
Fall for that same old line
A line I know you've heard from me
At least a hundred times?
But here I am again
You'll take me back and then
It won't be long 'til I'll be gone
Up on my way again

What's somebody like you lovin' somebody like me for, baby? (Baby)
What's somebody like you lovin' somebody like me for, child? (Child)
What's somebody like you lovin' somebody like me for, baby? (Baby)
What's somebody like you lovin' somebody like me for, child? (Child)

Baby, sorry, it's only me
Don't want nobody stayin' up late at night
Waitin' on me
Waitin' on me
Waitin' on me

I can't seem to settle down
Maybe I'll just hang around
But every time you pick me up
I guess I take you down
But though I wonder why
You want me somehow I
Just know if you stopped lovin' me
I'd crawl on off and die
