Benjamin rode out of Montana
On a Palomino pony
Told me he was all alone
He lost his family in '49

Benjamin took me to San Diego
Guess we caused quite a commotion
Sellin' Pacific Ocean water
And callin' it seaweed wine

Oh, I never had as good a friend as Benjamin
He loved to travel
He'd been ever' place I'd been and back again
That boy could unravel
Stories that would make your eyes
Big as blackberry pies, I'm tellin' you
Life could be fun for anyone
Who had a good friend like Benjamin
Had a good friend like Benjamin

Well, me and Ben thumbed a ride to Alabama
Spent the summer pickin' cotton
Now, it was so doggone hot
We bought us a three-speed electric fan
You might also like
Then at night we'd drink a Coca-Cola
Listen to the rain a-fallin'
Hearin' the bob white callin'
As though he'd know we'd understand

Oh, I never had as good a friend as Benjamin
He loved to travel
He'd been ever' place I'd been and back again
That boy could unravel
Stories that would make your eyes
Big as blackberry pies, I'm tellin' you
Life could be fun for anyone
Who had a good friend like Benjamin
Had a good friend like Benjamin

Well, Ben and me spent some time in Oklahoma
Livin' on a reservation
Workin' at a service station
Pumpin' gas and passin' time

We caught a train down to Harlan County
Thinkin' we were awful lucky
Just to walk along a Kentucky backroad
Without no reason nor rhyme
Oh, I never had as good a friend as Benjamin
He loved to travel
He'd been ever' place I'd been and back again
That boy could unravel
Stories that would make your eyes
Big as blackberry pies, I'm tellin' you
Life could be fun for anyone
Who had a good friend like Benjamin
Had a good friend like Benjamin
