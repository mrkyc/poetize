Can't seem to settle down
Maybe I'll just hang around
But every time you pick me up
I guess I take you down

But here I am again
You'll take me back and then
It won't be long 'til I'll be gone
Up on my way again

So I spend my days thinkin' up new ways
To do the same old thing
Seasons come and go without a name
And I spend my nights in the bright spotlights
Wishin' I could let the people know
You can't win or lose unless you play the game

Sittin' in the airport, awaitin' on my plane
Nothin' to do for an hour or two
So I try to find a message in a picture I drew
In the corner of a letter from a boy I knew
You might also like
Off the plane and through the rain into a limousine
The traffic's slow so I miss my show
But lookin' out the window somehow I know
That they're about to play my record on the radio

So, I write another song as I go along
To let you know just where I'd been
Don't want to meet myself at the masquerade
You can tell in my verse if I get worse
By the chorus I may be fine
A line, my friend, can end the kind charade

Layin' in my hotel room, wantin' to be alone
Needin' the time to rest my mind
But they bring in another stack of papers to sign
And L.A.'s waitin' on the other line

So, I'm packin' up, and I'm checkin' out, I'm on the road again
Feelin' like I'm in a pantomime
But the words will come to me in their own good time
Tumblin' and stumblin' over in rhyme
And the ugliest word that I ever heard
My friends, is sacrifice
It's an easy out for all you should have been
And if there's one thing that I just can't bring
Myself to compromise
It's blamin' somebody else for the state I'm in

Oh, but then again
Daddy never loved his baby girl, no how
