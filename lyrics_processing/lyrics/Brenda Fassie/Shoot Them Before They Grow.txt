Two white men fighting one another
They're fighting for a black man
The other one says the black man must be free
The other one says the black man must be in handcuffs
Who's gonna win now?
'Cause they both have power
Who's gonna save the black man?
'Cause he ain't got no power
16-year-old kids protesting they want freedom
Black children crying saying give us better education
Good white man say give them good education
The bad white man say shoot them before they grown

Shoot them before they're grown
Shoot them before they're grown
Shoot them before they're grown
Shoot them before they're grown

Who's gonna save them?
Cause they've got no rights
Where can they run to?
Cause they don't know who to trust
All the boys and the girls are running
Running for their lives
'Cause the man with the gun is coming
Coming to shoot them before they grow
'Cause the man with the gun is coming
'Coming to shoot them before they grow
Before they're grown
