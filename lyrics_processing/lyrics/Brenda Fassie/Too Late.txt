Started raining on the way to fetch some water
Poor woman had a baby on her back
Was struck by lightning on her way
To fetch some water...
She tried hiding under a tree to save her child
Poor woman had no place to go
Lightning caught her with her baby on her back
Friends relatives ran for her
It was too late
It was too late
Too late for mama
Oh no
Husband came running to the scene yeah
Poor man held his dead wife in his arms
Eyes full of tears not believing the nightmare
Knelt down and prayed for this, was a painful loss
It was too late... too late for mama
Oh mama mama, oh poor mama
It was too late... too late
Too late for mama... oh mama
Mama with a little baby
She's gone... she's gone... oh she's gone, oh poor mama
Too late (x4)
It was too late
