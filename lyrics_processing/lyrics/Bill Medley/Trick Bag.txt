You told me baby, you were going to the drug store
Well, in my mind, I knew you were lying
The drug store closed at a quarter to nine
I saw you kissing Jimmy across the fence
I heard you telling Jimmy I ain't got no sense
The way you've been acting is such a drag
You done put me in a trick bag
When I come home, start an argument
Just to keep you from asking where my voodoo went
Peep out the front door, well, I heard the back door slam
I peek out of the window, look at here
Somebody's taking it on the lam
I say I saw you kissing Jimmy across the fence
And I heard you telling Jimmy I ain't got no sense
The way you've been acting is such a drag
You done put me in a trick bag
You put me in a, ooh baby
You put me in a trick bag
We had a fight, then you got mad
Got on the telephone and called your mom and dad
And daddy said, "She's my daughter and I'm her pa"
He said that you ain't nothing but a son-in-law

I heard you telling Jimmy I ain't got no sense
The way you've been acting is such a drag
You done put me in a trick bag
Put me in a trick bag, a trick bag
You put me in a trick bag, yes, you did
Put me in a trick bag
Saw you walk out the door
Where were you going at 12 in the midnight, baby?
I saw you kissing Jimmy
Oh, across that fence
I heard you tell Jimmy
Oh, Billy ain't got no damn sense

You walked out the door
