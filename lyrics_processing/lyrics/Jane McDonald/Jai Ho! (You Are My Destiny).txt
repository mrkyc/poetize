Jai Ho! Jai Ho!

I got shivers
When you touch my face
I'll make you hot, get all you got
I'll make you wanna say
(Jai Ho!)
(Jai Ho!)
I got fever
Running like a fire
For you, I will go all the way
I'm gonna take you higher
(Jai Ho!)
I keep it steady
'Cause steady is how I feel it
(Jai Ho!)
This beat is heavy, so heavy
You gon' feel it

You are the reason that I breathe
(Jai Ho!)
You are the reason that I still believe
(Jai Ho!)
You are my destiny (my destiny)
Jai Ho, o-o-o-oh!

No, there is nothing that can stop us
(Jai Ho!)
Nothing can ever come between us
(Jai Ho!)
So come and dance with me
Jai Ho!
