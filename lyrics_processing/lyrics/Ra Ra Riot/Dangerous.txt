You're dangerous
Yeah, you know that I know
You're dangerous

Where did you go
'Cause I don't believe that I saw you there
It's a shame
I don't know what makes us that way
Yet you're dangerous, it's true
Isn't it strange, I've lost my mind
Couldn't tell ya, I didn't know why

I just can't help myself
But that ain't that the game

I know, you said it so, love is blind
But I know you're dangerous
I've found every time my blood runs cold
'Cause I know you're dangerous
It takes so much work, but it's worth all of the hurt
For the couple of times I feel good
You're dangerous
Yeah, you know that I know
You're dangerous
Yeah, you know that I know
You might also like
Tell me the truth
'Cause I can't rely on secondhand news
Was it careless gettin' myself worked up that way?
There's nothing left for me to think
Is this how you planned it all along?
Paranoia will destroy us

It's disastrous
But isn't that the game

I know, you said it so, love is blind
But I know you're dangerous
I've found every time my blood runs cold
'Cause I know you're dangerous
It takes so much work, but it's worth all of the hurt
For the couple of times I feel good
You're dangerous
Yeah, you know that I know
You're dangerous
Yeah, you know that I know

You might think that you're in control
No better off on my own
But I could be just as cold as you
You're dangerous
Yeah, you know that I know
You're dangerous
Yeah, you know that I know
Yeah, it takes so much work, but it's worth all of the hurt
For the couple of times I feel good
You're dangerous
Yeah, you know that I know
You're dangerous
