We had it good for two years in the truck
Until we realized our luck had dried up
So I went to the dealership, tore out the seats
I know it's just a sign, but I can't let it free

Do I wonder sometimes in Southern California
When the sun shines, if it don't shine for ya
Now I'm making bread again, still living in a rental
You're in our old house and it makes me sentimental

Do I wonder if I should have stayed?
Every night, every day
So don't bring flowers to my grave
Say goodbye from far away

We were broke up but still sharing a bed
Spent all our cash driving out west
Kicking up hope like dust on a track
You told me don't pick so I don't call you back

Do I wonder sometimes in Southern California
When the sun shines, if it don't shine for ya
Now I'm making bread again, still living in a rental
You're in our old house and it makes me sentimental
You might also like
Do I wonder if I should have stayed?
Every night, every day
So don't bring flowers to my grave
Say goodbye from far away

Been a long time I've been thinking about
I've been thinking, I've been dreaming, I've been thinking about
Been a long time I've been thinking about
I've been thinking, I've been dreaming, I've been thinking about
Been a long time I've been thinking about
Been a long time I've been thinking about
Been a long time I've been thinking about
I've been thinking, I've been dreaming, I've been thinking about

Do I wonder sometimes in Southern California
When the sun shines, if it don't shine for ya
Now I'm making bread again, still living in a rental
You're in our old house and it makes me sentimental
I could get you on the line, but I know it ain't productive
I know it ain't good, but I'm feeling self-destructive
You're on the check out and I'm working construction
My only medicine is letting go again
Do I wonder if I should have stayed?
Every night, every day
So don't bring flowers to my grave
