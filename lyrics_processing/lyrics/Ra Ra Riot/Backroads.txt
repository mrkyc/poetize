Never get tired of silence on long roads
Maybe another life I will
Maybe I'll never know
We got all we need right here together
No one to hold us back again
No one to turn us in

Pulled my car up to that ballroom
Top down, shotgun
You came runnin' outside
Tossed your heels into my backseat
Said, "we ain't comin' back this time"

All night, drivin' low-lit back roads
Just keepin' out of sight
I'm prayin' we make that state line
And to the other side
We got only two gallons left
And there's a feelin' in my chest
I don't know if you're seein' what I'm seein'
But there's a light on up ahead

Runnin' out of time if we stay here
Maybe another day we could
I guess we'll never know
You might also like
Pulled my car up to that ballroom
Top down, shotgun
And you jumped inside
Checked yourself in my rear view
'Cause we're leaving it all behind

All night, drivin' low-lit back roads
Just keepin' out of sight
I'm prayin' we make that state line
And to the other side
We got only two gallons left
And there's a feelin' in my chest
I don't know if you're seein' what I'm seein'
But there's a light on up ahead

Now all this pain when it's over
But I can't deny it was fun
It's all the same when it's over
All we can do now is run

All night, drivin' low-lit back roads
Just keepin' out of sight
I'm prayin' we make that state line
And to the other side
We got only one gallon left now
And there's a bullet in my chest
I don't know if you're seein' what I'm seein'
But there's a light on up ahead
I don't know if you're seein' what I'm seein'
But there's a light on up ahead
