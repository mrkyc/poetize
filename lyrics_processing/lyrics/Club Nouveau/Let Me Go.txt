Let me tell you how I really feel
And what's on my mind
Boy, it's you, I just don't understand
Why you keep wasting my time
You said your love was true
I opened up my heart
And gave all I had to you
A love like mine is very hard to find
I'm tired of the games
I want the truth and nothing else
So tell me what you want
Are we one or should I walk away?
I just wanna know
If this is the end or should I just
Let it go
I can't take this pain another day

If you want my love (If you want my love)
Tell me so (Tell me so)
Let me go, let me go
Let me go, let me go (Or let me go)
Let me go
If you want my love (If you want my love)
Tell me so (You gotta tell me so)
Let me go, let me go
Let me go, let me go
Let me go (Or let me go, yeah, ooh hoo)
You might also like
So many sleepless nights
You're always on my mind
I wish we could talk, not fight
Can we sit and talk civilly?
You know it's overdue
We've got a lot of things
We need to just straighten out
You know we can't outrun reality
I've gave you all my love
Gave you all my heart
Gave you all my time, boy
I have nothing else to give
I just wanna know if this is the end
Or should I just
Let it go
Give me back my life so I can live

If you want my love
Tell me so (Yeah, you gotta tell me so)
Let me go, let me go
Let me go, let me go (Let me go)
Let me go
If you want my love (My love)
Tell me so
Let me go, let me go
Let me go, let me go (Yeah)
Let me go (Yeah)
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah

If you want my love (If you want my love)
Tell me so
Let me go, let me go (You gotta tell me so)
Let me go, let me go (Or let me go)
Let me go
If you want my love (If you want my love)
Tell me so
Let me go, let me go (Yeah, you gotta tell me so)
Let me go, let me go (Or let me go)
Let me go
If you want my love
Tell me so
