But it seems to keep following me
I get up and move on the double
Look at my face and what you see?
You might say that I'm a little crazy
But I'm just being me
You know that I ain't got no worries
This is my life and I'm finally free
And I'm taking it
Step by step, step by step
Step by step, step by step
You gotta take it, step by step
Step by step, step by step
Take my life by the hand and grab it
Gonna do what I wanna do
I ain't taking me no stuff from nothing
You'll be alone 'cause I'm being cool
You may say that I'm a little bossy
But I'm just being me
You know that I ain't got no worries
This is my life and I'm finally free
