You play with my heart like my heart is just a game
Baby, can't you see, what you do to me?
First you want me back then you want to set me free
I don't understand all the things you do
'Cause I love you, girl, and I know you love me too
You keep playing games with my heart and mind
Baby, can't you see we just keep wasting time?
No matter what you say, no matter what you do
No matter how you act, I'm still in love with you
No matter what you say, no matter what you do
No matter how you act, I'm still in love with you
I'm still in love with you
Now I'm all alone and I beg you so
'Cause I need your love, I could never let you go
But you hurt my heart with the pain you give
Never thought that I would have to live without
All the love you have and the love you give
Baby, don't you know I could never let you go?
But you're hurting me with the pain inside
Baby, don't you know we just keep wasting time?
No matter what you say, no matter what you do
No matter how you act, I'm still in love with you
No matter what you say, no matter what you do
No matter how you act, I'm still in love with you
