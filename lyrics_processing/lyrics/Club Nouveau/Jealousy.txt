I can't tell you why these things
Continue to happen to me
But some people get so jealous
Of the smallest of all things
I tried to help some friends to help themselves
To get their lives intact
They came out spreading rumors
Now I have to come out spreading facts
Let me tell how this started
And where it all began
I guess I was a fool to try and help
My broken social friends
They told me if I'd help them
They'd be in debt for life
But when I turned my back to get support
They stabbed me with a knife, oh no

I don't need jealousy (no)
I don't want the bad talk around me
I don't need jealousy (oh)
I don't want the bad talk around me

You came out spreading rumors
Because you were so jealous
You didn't understand that we were on your side
Tell me why not, fellas?
You let some people guide you in the wrong direction
From the truth, you cannot hide
So don't go look for no protection
You might also likeI didn't understand it then
And you know I just can't now
You know I tried to help you out
And now it's me you're trying to clown
But let me tell you, partner
You won't come out ahead
All this jealousy will do is make you lose it all instead, oh no

I don't need jealousy
I don't want the bad talk around me
I don't need jealousy
I don't want the bad talk around me

Jealous folks cause trouble, yapping all the time
You know they're listening for rumors
So that they can drop a dime
They run from place to place
Just telling half the story
Because they're always trying to down someone
And take their fame and glory
If it hasn't happened to you
Just give yourself some time
I think you know the symptoms
When a jealous person drops a line
I think I'll write a letter that sums it up the best
I'll have to write it in big letters
With my business, please don't mess, oh no
I don't need jealousy (I don't need no jealousy)
I don't want the bad talk around me
I don't need jealousy (ooh-ooh-ooh)
I don't want the bad talk around me
I don't need jealousy
I don't want the bad talk around me
I don't need jealousy
I don't want the bad talk around me

I don't need, you don't need
We don't need no jealousy
I don't need, you don't need
We don't need no jealousy
I don't need, you don't need
We don't need no jealousy
I don't need, you don't need
We don't need no jealousy

I don't need jealousy
I don't want the bad talk around me
I don't need jealousy
