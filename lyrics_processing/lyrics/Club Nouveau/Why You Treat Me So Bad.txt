Why you treat me so bad? (yeah)
Why you treat me so bad? (so bad)
Why you treat me so bad?
Why you treat me so bad, baby?
Oh girl, I loved you, but you turned and you walked away
I would love you more tomorrow yet I know I do today
You told me that you'd never hurt me
Girl, you just tore my life apart
Tell me, baby, why'd you do it?
Won't you bring me back my heart?
I tried to understand it, baby
I searched my heart inside my mind
I searched the depths of my whole soul, baby
There was nothing there to find
You told me that you'd never leave me
Girl, you just went and you told a lie
Tell me, baby, why'd you do it?
Why'd you make a-me wanna cry?
Why you treat me so bad?
I don't know why, baby
Why you treat me so bad?
Why you do me the way you do?
Why you treat me so bad?
I don't know why, baby
Why you treat me so bad?
Why you treat me so bad, baby?
You might also likeBoy, let me tell you just how I really and truly feel
You know that I have doubts and issues
But now I'm gonna give you the deal
You tell me that I always hurt you
I don't know what you're talking about
Tried to love you, tried to hold you
But you always seemed to doubt
You have told me that you didn't trust me
And you didn't want me around
You showed somebody else your interest
Now you walk around with a frown
I'm sorry that you say hurt you
But you know you hurt me too
I'm begging you, baby, I need you back
Because I'm still in love with you
Why you treat me so bad?
I don't know why, baby
Why you treat me so bad?
Why you do me the way you do?

I don't know why, baby
Why you treat me so bad?

I sit here all alone just thinking how our love could be
But every time I call you up
You won't talk on the phone with me
I just don't know if I can take it
Girl, you made me cop a plea
You got me begging for your loving
Can't you see it's killing me?
I just don't understand it, baby, after all I've done for you
You know we've both gone through some changes
And now you say your love is true
Boy, you know how much I loved you
But now I guess my heart has changed
Don't beg me, baby, can't take you back
I found myself another man
Why you treat me so bad?
I don't know why, baby
