When I am here so far from you and
I just can't seem to stop thinking of you
And I think thoughts oh so special
'Bout the time that we spend together
Boy, I long for you one thousand times
You've ruled my heart, my soul, and my mind
No other man can make me feel the way you do
Boy, I'm so in love with you

You're so heavy on my mind, all the time
So heavy on my mind all the time
You're so heavy on my mind, all the time
So heavy on my mind all the time

Sometimes I try not to think of you
But I can't seem to ever see it through now
I know for sure missing you is true
When I close my eyes to sleep I see nothing but you
Understand your heart and what you're feeling inside
I've tried to run, boy, and I've tried to hide
But you are my life, boy, and I just can't lie
You've won my heart and my mind
You might also like
You're so heavy on my mind, all the time
So heavy on my mind all the time
You're so heavy on my mind, all the time
So heavy on my mind all the time
You're so heavy on my mind, all the time
So heavy on my mind all the time
You're so heavy on my mind, all the time
So heavy on my mind all the time

I just can't stop thinking about you
I just can't thinking about you
I just can't stop thinking about your love

You're so heavy on my mind, all the time
So heavy on my mind all the time
You're so heavy on my mind, all the time
So heavy on my mind all the time

Now that we are here together
And you know how I feel deep inside about you, girl
Boy, I know the feeling 'cause I feel it, too
I guess what I'm saying is that I'm so in love with you
You're so heavy on my mind, all the time
So heavy on my mind all the time
You're so heavy on my mind, all the time
So heavy on my mind all the time
You're so heavy on my mind, all the time
So heavy on my mind all the time
You're so heavy on my mind, all the time
