Sometime in our life we all have pain
We all have sorrow
But if we are wise, we know that there's
Always tomorrow (Lean on me)

When you're not strong, I'll be your friend (I'll be your friend)
I'll help you carry on (Lean on me)
For it won't be long 'til I'm gonna need
Somebody to lean on

Please swallow your pride if I have things
You need to borrow
For no one can fill those of your needs
That you won't let show (Lean on me)

When you're not strong, I'll be your friend (I'll be your friend)
I'll help you carry on (Lean on me)
For it won't be long 'til I'm gonna need
Somebody to lean on

You just call on me, brother, when you need a hand
We all need somebody to lean on
I just might have a problem that you'd understand
We all need somebody to lean on (Lean on me)
You might also like
When you're not strong, I'll be your friend (I'll be your friend)
I'll help you carry on (Lean on me)
For it won't be long 'til I'm gonna need
Somebody to lean on

If there is a load you have to bear
That you can't carry
I'm right up the road, I'll share your load
If you'll just call me (Lean on me)

When you're not strong, I'll be your friend (I'll be your friend)
I'll help you carry on (Lean on me)
For it won't be long 'til I'm gonna need
Somebody to lean on

You just call on me, brother, when you need a hand
We all need somebody to lean on
I just might have a problem that you'd understand
We all need somebody to lean on (Lean on me)

When you're not strong, I'll be your friend
I'll help you carry on (Lean on me)
For, I said, it won't be long 'til I'm gonna need
Somebody to lean on
We be jammin', we be jammin', man, hey
We be jammin'
We be jammin', we be jammin', man, hey
We be jammin'
