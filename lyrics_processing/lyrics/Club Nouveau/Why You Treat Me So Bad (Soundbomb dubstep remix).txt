Why you treat me so bad
Why you treat me so bad
Why you treat me so bad
Why you treat me so bad baby
Oh girl I loved you but you turned and you walked away
I would love you for tomorrow
Though I know I do today
Told me that you'd never hurt me, girl you just tore my life apart
Tell me baby, why'd you do it, won't you bring me back my heart
I tried to understand it baby, I searched my heart inside my mind
I searched the depths of my soul baby
There was nothing there to find
You told me that you'd never leave me
Girl you just went and told a lie
Tell me baby, why'd you do it, why'd you make me wanna cry
Why you treat me so bad, I don't know why baby
Why you treat me so bad, why you do me the way you do
Why you treat me so bad, I don't know why baby
Why you treat me so bad
Why you treat me so bad baby
You might also likeBoy just let me tell you how I really and truly feel
You know that I have doubts and issues
But now i'm gonna tell you the deal
You tell me that I always hurt ya, I don't know what ya talkin' 'bout
Tried to love you, tried to hold you, but you always seemed to doubt
You have told me that you didn't trust me
And you didn't want me around
Show somebody else your interest, now you walk around with a frown
Sorry that you say I hurt you, but you know you hurt me too
I'm begging you baby, I need you back, cuz I'm still in love with you
Why you treat me so bad, I don't know why baby
Why you treat me so bad, why you do me the way you do
Why you treat me so bad, I don't know why baby
Why you treat me so bad
Why you treat me so bad baby
I sit here all alone just thinkin'
How our love could be
But everytime I call you up
You won't get on the phone with me
I just don't know if I can take it
You make me cop a plea
You got me begging for your lovin'
Can't you see it's killing me
I just don't understand you baby
After all I've done for you
You know we've both done through some changes
Now you say your love is true
Boy, you know how much I loved you
Now I guess my heart has changed
Don't beg me baby, can't take you back
I've found myself another man
Why you treat me so bad, I don't know why baby
Why you treat me so bad, why you do me the way you do
Why you treat me so bad, I don't know why baby
Why you treat me so bad
Why you treat me so bad baby
Oh girl
I don't know
Why you treat me so bad
Do what's right
Why you treat me so bad, I don't know
Why you treat me so bad, so bad
