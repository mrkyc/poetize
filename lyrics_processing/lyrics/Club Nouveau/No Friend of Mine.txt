Yep, yep, heh, heh!
Smiling, you're always smiling
Always smiling in my face
Spreading all that hate
Thinking, I'm always thinking
Thinking of my second move
You think I'm gonna lose
People, they always wanna talk about you
Things they say can hurt real bad
They don't care about your feelings
Don't care about the lies they're spilling
And it's cold the way they're dealing
But now I understand
You ain't no friend of mine
So don't think that I'm blind
When you do the things you do
Don't think I can't see through
You ain't no friend of mine
So don't think that I'm blind
When you say the things you say
The silly games you play
You might also likeWatching, I'm always watching
Watching eyes that burn my back
It's cold how they attack
Hoping, I know you're hoping
Hoping that I don't succeed
I'm smiling 'cause I see
People, they always wanna bring you down
They hate to see you get ahead
'Cause they're always talking about you
And they're always smiling with you
Always trying to know your business
But now I understand
You ain't no friend of mine
So don't think that I'm blind
When you do the things you do
Don't think I can't see through
You ain't no friend of mine
So don't think that I'm blind
When you say the things you say
The silly games you play
(Friends don't turn on friends)
Friends don't turn on friends, oh, no
(Friends don't turn on friends)
While you're talking behind my back
You're smiling in my face
Just 'cause I'm strong
Friends like to hang out, kick it in the mall
Pick up a brother whenever he falls
In time of need, a friend is there
Supposedly showing that love and care
I got your back and you got mine
Together forever 'til the end of time
Supposed to be my friend, in time of need
You ain't no friend to me!
You ain't no friend of mine
So don't think that I'm blind
When you do the things you do
Don't think I can't see through
You ain't no friend of mine
So don't think that I'm blind
When you say the things you say
The silly games you play
You ain't no friend of mine
So don't think that I'm blind
When you do the things you do
Don't think I can't see through
You ain't no friend of mine
So don't think that I'm blind
When you say the things you say
The silly games you play
(You ain't no friend of mine)
(You ain't no friend of mine)
Oh...
(You ain't no friend of mine)
I can't believe the things you do to me
(You ain't no friend of mine)
You ain't no friend, you ain't no friend, oh-oh...
(You ain't no friend of mine)
You never sacrifice, take a look at your life
(You ain't no friend of mine)
You ain't no friend, you ain't no friend, oh, no
(You ain't no friend of mine)
It's never too late to look in the mirror
Maybe you might see things a little clearer
(You ain't no friend of mine)
You ain't no friend, you ain't no friend
(You ain't no friend of mine)
Tired of things you say
And the silly games you play
(You ain't no friend of mine)
You ain't no friend, you ain't no friend
Why don't you stop, you've got to stop
You ain't no friend, oh, no
And they're always smiling with you
Always trying to know your business
