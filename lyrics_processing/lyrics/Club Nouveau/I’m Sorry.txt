Say I tried to hurt you
Why would I just want to
Go and do you wrong?
Change your own emotion
Say that you don't want this
Back and forth with your love
Still I'm hanging on
You know you really done me wrong
(But I didn't mean to)
You know you really done me bad
(So what should I do)
Apologize for what you've done
(But you've hurt my heart too)
You don't understand my pain
So I have to leave you
I'm sorry for the tears
I'm sorry for the pain
I'm sorry if you think
I've done you wrong
I'm sorry for the lies
I'm sorry that you cried
I'm sorry that I am not coming home
You might also likeFound yourself another
Said you need a lover
One that's gonna love you
Never do you wrong
Tell me you don't want me
Never gonna need me
Every time I see you
You're standing all alone
You know we've played this game too long
(You've played it with me)
You know you've really done me wrong
(It's one side you see)
It's time I finally get away
(Then walk on by me)
I hate to see that games you play
So I have to be free
I'm sorry for the tears
(Free, free, yeah)
I'm sorry for the pain
I'm sorry if you think
I've done you wrong
Oh, I'm sorry for the lies
I'm sorry that you cried
I'm sorry that I am not coming home
I'm not coming home
I'm sorry for the tears
I'm sorry for the pain
I'm sorry if you think
I've done you wrong
I'm sorry for the lies
I'm sorry that you cried
I'm sorry that I am not coming home
Lies and everything you do
And everything you say
And all the games you play
Telling everybody you let me down
How you let me go
How you set me free
Sorry didn't tell you to lie to me
And sorry didn't tell you to walk on me
And sorry didn't do what you've do to me
I'm sorry but I'm glad I'm free
Girl, I'm sorry for the tears
I'm sorry for the pain
I'm sorry if you think
I'm sorry, I'm sorry
(Say you're sorry, say you're sorry)
I'm sorry
(Say you're sorry, why you treat me so bad)
I'm not coming home
I just have to say
I'm sorry for the tears
I'm sorry for the pain
I'm sorry if you think
I've done you wrong
I'm sorry for the lies
I'm sorry that you cried
I'm sorry that I am not coming home
I'm not coming home
I'm sorry for the tears
I'm sorry for the pain
I'm sorry if you think
I've done you wrong
Girl, I'm sorry for the lies
I'm sorry that you cried
I'm sorry that I am not coming home
I'm not coming home
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry
