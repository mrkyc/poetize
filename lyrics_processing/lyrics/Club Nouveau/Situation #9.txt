Situation
Number nine
Number nine

Here I am, stuck in this rut again
Ooh, I don't know what to do
And I haven't got a friend in the world
No, no, no, baby, not even you (oh)

But situation number two ain't bad
But number nine ain't good (it ain't good)
But I thought I was riding really high
'Cause I'm here hanging in Hollywood

Boy, I hate to tell you
But you really need to check yourself
The life that you're living is gonna catch up to you
Boy, I think you need some help, oh yeah

Situation number nine blowing my mind (number nine)
Situation number nine blowing my mind (number nine)
You might also like
Rumors circulating 'round about me
And my lavish lifestyle
But situation number nine sets me free
From the talk for awhile (well, well, well, well)

I hear somebody knocking at my door
Ooh, I wonder, who could it be? (I wonder who it is)
Some people say that I'm paranoid
But they don't really know me, nah

Boy, I hate to tell you
But you really need to check yourself
(You really need to check yourself now)
The life that you're living is gonna catch up to you
(Is gonna catch up to you)
Boy, I think you need some help, hey, yeah

Situation number nine blowing my mind (number nine)
Situation number nine blowing my mind (number nine)
Situation number nine blowing my mind (number nine)
Situation number nine blowing my mind
Ooh, I don't know what to do
I can't take it no more
Somebody's knocking at my door
Who could it be that's coming here for me?
I wish that you'd just go away, hey, yeah
I tried so hard to do what's right
But it seems it's just not enough
Situation number nine is just blowing my mind

Situation number nine blowing my mind
Situation number nine blowing my mind
Situation number nine blowing my mind
Situation number nine blowing my mind
