I do love you, I love when we're together
But I'm not 'in' love with you, I love the moment
But what about all the time we spent together?
Didn't that mean anything to you?
Oh, yeah, of course it meant something to me
It meant a lot, it's just that
Well, I can't really be tied down right now
Is there someone else?
They always think there's someone else
No, it's not another man, it's just me, I'm not...
Well, then what is it?
Don't you love me?
Yes, I don't love you, for now
Not forever?
I love you for the moment...
You might also likeI finally realized that you won't be with me
It's taken time for me to understand
That I must set you free
Oh, yes, it's hard for me to let it go
I've had you for sometime
Your love is heavy on my heart
Your thoughts are heavy on my mind
Remember that you said you'd be with me
You told me that you'd stay
And you would never want to be set free
But now you run away
So tell me where now are you running to
Do you have another man?
Is it something that I've done to you?
Please help me understand
Did I ever say that I was your woman?
Surely you understand we're just friends
I know that what you feel is real
But for me it was just for that minute
Just a momentary lover
You said you'd be right by my side
(Momentary love)
Just a momentary love
Baby, you left me for another guy
(I love you, just for that minute)
Just a momentary lover
Oh, girl, you're always on my mind
(Momentary love)
Just a momentary love
But, baby, when I call you up
You ain't got no time
(I fell in love in you, just for that minute)
How can a love once true in a moment pass you by?
And tell me if you love the way you do
Why don't you want to try?
You said, "I've never ever done you wrong
I've been real good to you"
So tell me you will stay right here with me
If what you feel is true
I know that what you give is really good loving
What every woman wants sometime in life
I do enjoy your company
But for you I'm just not that woman
Just a momentary lover
You said you'd be right by my side
(Oh, momentary love)
Just a momentary love
Baby, you left me for another guy
(I love you, I love you for the minute)
Just a momentary lover
Girl, you're always on my mind
(Momentary love)
Just a momentary love
Can't we spend a little time
Just a momentary lover
Just a little bit, just a little
(Oh-oh-oh...)
Just a momentary love
Just a little time, please spend a little time
(Oh-oh-oh...)
Just a momentary lover
For the moment, for the moment, baby
(Girl, I'll beat your game)
Just a momentary love
For the moment
Baby, you'll never change
Baby, I thought you'd never leave
(But I had to leave)
I thought you'd never go away
(I had to go)
You told me you'd be right here
I love you
Afraid you'd never stay
I thought you'd always love me
Why must you leave
(Just for the moment)
Why must you go
Just a momentary lover
Said you'd be right be my side
Just a momentary love
Then you left me for another guy
Just a momentary lover
You're just a moment
Just a momentary love
You're just a minute
Just a momentary lover
Baby, let's make sweet love
Just a momentary love
Your heart's not, your heart's not
Your heart's not in it, oh, no
Just a momentary lover
A momentary love
Just a momentary love
A momentary love
Just a momentary lover
Just for the minute, see you're not in it
All of my money, you always spend it
Just a momentary love
Baby, you could never be true
All of the things I've done for you
Just a momentary lover
I get so lonely, I love you only
Just a momentary love
Said you'd be right by my side
Left me for another guy
Just a momentary lover
Just a momentary love
Yeah
A momentary love, that's what you are to me
And a full time lover you could never be
Never down for my love, just out for my money
But I'm upping your game, let me tell you, honey
One of these days, you'll be jocking me
And in my arms, sweet baby, is where you'll long to be
You're not so clever, you're not so fly
You're just a momentary love, and I'm not that guy!
Just a momentary lover
You said you'd be right by my side
Just a momentary love
Baby, you left me for another guy
Just a momentary lover
Just a little bit, just a little
Just a momentary love
Just a little time
