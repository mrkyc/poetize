Money can't buy you love
It can't buy you love
Money can't buy you love
It can't buy you love
Money can't buy you love
Oh, money
Money can't buy you love
Talking 'bout money, yeah
I gave you everything you'd ever want
I gave you everything you'd ever need
And, baby, I even gave me
(Is that so?)
I told you everything you'd want to hear
I whispered sweet nothings all in your ear
Tell me why you want to hurt me?
Yeah, you've been real good this time
But what about the last four times
When all you did was hurt me?
I stayed because you gave good love
Not material things that you're speaking of
You can't buy my heart from me, no, no, boy

No, you can't buy love
Money can't buy you love
Everything but love
Money can't buy you love
Oh, yeah
Money can't buy you love
Oh, money
I sent you flowers just the other day
It's such a funny game in this love we play
Tell me what you want from me
(Just your love)
How can you say that I don't understand?
I've been better to you that any other man
With all the love that I gave
You measure love on the things you give
You never look at the way you live
You ain't living right for me, no, baby
You buy a gift to take way the pain
Don't you know the hurt still remains
It's time to set me free, 'cause, boy
Money can't buy you love
Money, money

Even in the dark of nights
Money can't buy you love
It can't buy you no love
Money can't buy you love
Money can't buy you love
Oh, money can't buy you love
Money, it can buy almost anything
From limousines, fancy cars to diamond rings
Buy your lover the home of her dreams
But you can't buy the heart, you know what I mean
You're hurt by love because you didn't understand
It wasn't money, she wanted the man
You broke her heart, but you bought her the world
Found out too late you were in love with the girl
Money can't buy you love
It can't buy you
Money can't buy you love
No love
Money can't buy you love
Not even the smallest amount of it
Money can't buy you love
Not even the slightest hint of it
No love
Money can't buy you love
No love, no love
Money can't buy you love
No money
Money can't buy you love
Money can't buy you no love
Money can't buy you love
