Continue to happen to me
But some people get so jealous
Of the smallest of all things
I tried to help some friends
To help themselves
To get their lives intact
They came out spreading rumours
Now I have to come out spreading facts
Let me tell how this started
And where it all began
I guess I was a fool to try and help
My broken social friends
They told me if I'd help them
They'd be in debt for life
But when I turned my back to get support
They stabbed me with a knife
I don't need jealousy (no)
I don't want the bad talk around me
I don't need jealousy (no)
I don't want the bad talk around me
You might also likeYou came out spreading rumours
Because you were so jealous
You didn't understand that
We were on your side
Tell my why not, fellas
You let some people guide you
In the wrong direction
From the truth, you cannot hide
So don't go look for no protection
I didn't understand it then
And you know I just can't now
You know I tried to help you out
And now it's me you're trying to clown
But let me tell you, partner
You won't come out ahead
All this jealousy will do
Is make you lose it all instead
I don't need jealousy
I don't want the bad talk around me
I don't need jealousy
I don't want the bad talk around me
Jealous thoughts cause trouble
Yapping all the time
You know they're listening for rumours
So that they can drop a dime
They run from place to place
Just telling half the story
Because they're always
Trying to down someone
And take their fame and glory
If it hasn't happened to you
Just give yourself some time
I think you know the symptoms
When a jealous person drops a line
I think I'll write a letter
That sums it up the best
I'll have to write it in big letters
With my business, please don't mess, oh, no
I don't need jealousy
(I don't need no jealousy)
I don't want the bad talk around me
I don't need jealousy
I don't want the bad talk around me
I don't need jealousy
I don't want the bad talk around me
I don't need jealousy
I don't want the bad talk around me
I don't need, you don't need
We don't need no jealousy
I don't need, you don't need
We don't need no jealousy
I don't need, you don't need
We don't need no jealousy
I don't need, you don't need
We don't need no jealousy
I don't need jealousy
I don't want the bad talk around me
I don't need jealousy
