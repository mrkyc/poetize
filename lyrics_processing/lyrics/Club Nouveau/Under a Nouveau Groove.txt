In the beginning, there was Captain Nouveau
He had a friend called MC Wak
The only think MC Wak could do was rap
One day, he turned against his friend, Captain Nouveau
And destroyed all my forms of music
As we know it today
Only Captain Nouveau was strong enough
To overcome this vicious power
That will destroy music as we know it
And the only thing that lives is the groove!
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh...
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh...
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh...
Under a Nouveau Groove
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh...
Under a Nouveau Groove
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh...
I've got a groove that can make you move
But you're standing on the wall
Like you're going insane
Stand up at attention
Let the groove release your mind
It's time to drop the bomb
Everybody unwind

Out of our constrictions
Gonna be groovin' up and down
It seems the only way
(Under a Nouveau Groove)
Here's a chance to dance your way
Out of my constrictions
(Under a Nouveau Groove)
She's the freak of my desire
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh...)
Yeah
(Under a Nouveau Groove)
(Do you know what I'm talkin' about?)
Under a Nouveau Groove
All the colors of the world live under one sun
Life is just a party no matter where you are
So shine the light of love like the star you are!
Here's our chance to dance our way
Out of our constrictions
We're gonna be groovin' up and down
It seems the only way
When the groove's the only guide
We should all be movin'
Under a Nouveau Groove
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh...)
Under a Nouveau Groove
The dog is in the yard playing with the cat
He's kickin' it under a Nouveau Groove!
Bring the noise!
What kind of party is this?!
A Nouveau party!
What kind of party is this?!
A Nouveau party!
This is MC Wak coming to you live
For the top of your tweeters
To the bottom of your sub-woofers, baby!
Even though I can't deliver under 10K
When I get paid, I'm gonna buy this record
I like this record, hmpf!
This is MC Wak
You know I can rap like on this!
(Oh, shut up!)
You wanna hear me rap?!
Well, I can do the Twist
I can do the Jerk
I can do the Camel Walk
The Worm, the Sperm, the Spank
The Na-Na Hunk, the Slide, the Penguin
And the Pee-Wee
Under a Nouveau Groove!
Say what?!
Am I out there?!
Well, I can do the Monkey, Mashed Potatoes
James Brown, The Bump, The Butt, The Rock
The G.Q. and the Boogaloo
Under a Nouveau Groove!
I can do the Funky Chicken, the Breakdown
The Popcorn and my allegiance
To bowties and platform shoes, ha!
Under a Nouveau Groove!
You don't hear me?! Ha!
I've got too many polyester 3-piece suits
And a double wide tie
And you know my hair?
I just got it fried on Friday, ha!
And me and the girl in the hotpants
You know that we can dance
