Ain't it a shame for two
Sitting all alone waiting
For each other to say, I do
I do love you?
And ain't it a shame for two
Missing out on love
'Cause they never gave enough of love
Respect and things to hold on to?
Hold on to love and never give up
I'm down on my knees
I'm begging you please
Won't you come back to me?
Come, baby, come on
Come share your love with me
Share your love, you've got to
Share your love
Share your love with me
Come, baby, come on
Come share your love with me
Share your love, you've got to
Share your love
Share your love with me

Running from the pain
Never giving all the love
They have inside their hearts
Instead they run away?
And ain't it a shame for two
