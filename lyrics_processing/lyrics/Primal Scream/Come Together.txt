This is a beautiful day, it is a new day
We are together
We are unified, and all for the cause
Because together, we got power
Apart, we got pow-wow
Today on this program, you will hear gospel
And rhythm and blues and jazz
All those are just labels
We know that music is music
Today on this program, you will hear gospel
And rhythm and blues and jazz
All those are just labels
We know that music is music
Gospel

I've got somethin' that's always true

Come together as one
Come together as one
Come together as one
Come together as one
Come together as one
