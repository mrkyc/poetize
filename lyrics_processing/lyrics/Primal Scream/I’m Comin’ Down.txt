Drifting, drifting
Drifting, drifting

I've been so high, I never wanted to come down
Drifting, drifting
I've been so lost, I never wanted to be found
I'm all hung over with bad dreams
I stumble in to messy scenes

I'm coming down
I can't face the dawn
I'm coming down
I feel too far gone

I've been drifting
I've been strung out, I've been burned
Drifting, drifting
I've been lonely to the point of no return
I drank myself to sleep last night
I see the world through bloodshot eyes

I'm coming down
I can't face the dawn
I'm coming down
I feel too far gone

Highs and pills won't heal my ills but
They make me feel better for a little while

I'm coming down
I can't face the dawn
I'm coming down
I feel too far gone

I'm coming down
