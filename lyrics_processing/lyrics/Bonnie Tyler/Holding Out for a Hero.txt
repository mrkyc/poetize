Do-do, do-do
Do-do, do-do
Do-do, do-do
Ah, ah

Where have all the good men gone and where are all the gods?
Where's the streetwise Hercules to fight the risin' odds?
Isn't there a white knight upon a fiery steed?
Late at night, I toss and I turn and I dream of what I need

I need a hero
I'm holding out for a hero till the end of the night
He's gotta be strong and he's gotta be fast
And he's gotta be fresh from the fight
I need a hero (Hero)
I'm holding out for a hero till the morning light (Hero till the morning light)
He's gotta be sure and it's gotta be soon
And he's gotta be larger than life, larger than life

Do-do, do-do
Do-do, do-do
Do-do, do-do
Ah, ah

Somewhere just beyond my reach, there's someone reaching back for me
Racing on the thunder and rising with the heat
It's gonna take a Superman to sweep me off my feet, yeah

Up where the mountains meet the heavens above
Out where the lightning splits the sea
I could swear there is someone somewhere watching me
Through the wind and the chill and the rain
And the storm and the flood
I can feel his approach like a fire in my blood
(Like a fire in my blood, like a fire in my blood)
(Like a fire in my blood, like a fire in my blood, blood)
I need a hero (Hero)
I'm holding out for a hero till the end of the night
