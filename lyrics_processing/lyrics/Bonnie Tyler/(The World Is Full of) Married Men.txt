With wives who never understand
Their looking for someone to share
The excitement of a love affair
Just as soon as they find you
The wine you and dine you
You fly on the wings of romance
But in the eyes of the world
You're just another crazy girl
Who loves a married man
Ooh your love is a secret
And you've got to keep it as long as you can
No don't cry for your lover
There's always another married man
The world is full of them
Oh yeah you make him feel so young
But his wife is still the number one
He promises to marry you
Just as soon as his divorce comes through
And it's not just a fling
He swears it's the real thing
A love that could last till the end
As he'd driving away
You know it's true what they say
About married men
