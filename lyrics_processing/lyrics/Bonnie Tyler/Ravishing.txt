When the sun is burning out
And the night is pouring in
Now is the time to run, run boy
Now is the time to hide
There's nobody out on the beach
There's nobody down in the woods
We're gonna do it alone
Were gonna do it outside
And I can feel the air, it's sticking to our skin so tight
And I can feel there's something in this air tonight
I really got it bad
(I really got it bad)
Tonight I really got it bad
(I really got it bad)
Tonight I really got it bad
But it's still so good, so good
That I got it at all and it was

Ravishing
(Ravishing!)
And I love to see the moonlight
See it shimmer down my dress
It's so ravishing
(Ravishing!)
And the wind is like a finger
Tracing patterns on your chest
You're so ravishing
(Ravishing!)

This is the season that we make our move
(We make our move)
This is the season we've got something to prove
(This is the season!)
And this is the season I've got something to lose
Oh, it's now or it's never
So now and forever, we're

Ravishing, ravishing
Oh-wo-wo
Ravishing, ravishing
Oh-wo-wo
Ravishing, ravishing
Oh-wo-wo, it's all right
Well be ravishing each other till the end of this endless night
It's all right, so right, it's all right, so right

And if an angel broke his wings
Would he come to you for parts?
I need a couple of wings boy, boy
I need a reason to soar
And if the devil lost his fire
(There's nobody out on the beach)
Could he count on you for sparks?
(There's nobody out in the woods!)
There's something we ought to try now
We ought to try it some more

Than anything I ever wanted was to see the light
And there's a chance that we'll be glowing in the dark tonight
I really got it bad
(I really got it bad)
Tonight I really got it bad
(I really got it bad)
Tonight I really got it bad
But it still felt good, so good
Just to get it at all, and it's so

Ravishing
(Ravishing!)
And I can't believe the way the stars are shooting through your hair
You're so ravishing
(Ravishing!)
And it's just my luck tonight I don't have anything to wear
We're so ravishing
(Ravishing!)
(And I know)
This is the season that we make our move
(We make our move)
This is the season we've got something to prove
(This is the season!)
And this is the season I've got something to lose
And all we ever really needed was

Ravishing, ravishing
Oh-wo-wo
Ravishing, ravishing
Oh-wo-wo
Ravishing, ravishing
Oh-wo-wo, it's all right
We'll be ravishing each other till the end of this endless
Ravishing each other till the end of this endless night
It's all right, so right, it's all right, so right
All right!
