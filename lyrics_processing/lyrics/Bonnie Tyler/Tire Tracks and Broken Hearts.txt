I want peroxide hair, I want some neon light
I got a new life waiting, I can't wait to begin it
The thing that gets me down, being young in this town
Is there's no future in it
I want a fine perfume, how 'bout a blue corvette?
If there's a slower death than living here and now
They haven't found it yet
I need a man who knows what I'm really worth
And I don't give a damn about life after death
But I gotta get some proof that there's a life after birth
Tire tracks and broken hearts, that's all we're leaving behind
It doesn't matter what we lose, it only matters what we're going to find
Tire tracks and broken hearts, let's get away from the past
So many ways to stay hungry baby, so many ways to go fast
I want a push-up bra, I want some satin sheets
Give me some real rich food, I want some succulent sweets
I want you by my side, you'll be all my own
I don't know what I want half the time, but I know know
That I don't want to spend another minute alone
Tire tracks and broken hearts, that's all we're leaving behind
It doesn't matter what we lose, it only matters what we're going to find
Tire tracks and broken hearts, let's get away from the past
So many ways to stay hungry baby, so many ways to go fast

Those good girls never know what they're missing
But us bad girls almost always do
And what we're missing most are the real good times
I want them bad and I want them now
I was born going faster than the limits allow
I want it bad and I want it now
We were born going faster than the limits allow
Faster than the limits allow
Right here, right now!
Tire tracks and broken hearts, that's all we're leaving behind
It doesn't matter what we lose, it only matters what we're going to find
Tire tracks and broken hearts, let's get away from the past
So many ways to stay hungry baby, so many ways to go fast
I wanna show you what I want you to do
Where and when and how
I want it bad and I want it now
We were born going faster than the limits allow
I wanna show you what I want you to do
Where and when and how
I want it bad and I want it now
We were born going faster than the limits allow
Tire tracks and broken hearts, that's all we're leaving behind
It doesn't matter what we lose, it only matters what we're going to find
Tire tracks and broken hearts, let's get away from the past
