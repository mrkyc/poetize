When the sky is falling
And you're looking 'round for somewhere to hide
Did you ever call out to someone?
Did you ever call out to me?
I've never been gone, I've been right here by your side
There ain't nothin' but clouds
There ain't nothin' but clouds in your eyes

Why don't you believe it when you finally found the truth?
You've been drinking poison water from the fountain of youth
Why don't you stop tearing up everyone you need the most?
You're so busy trying to get even, you never even try to get close

I can't explain it away, it doesn't make any sense
To know what it's like
I guess you gotta go through it
I guess you gotta go through it
I guess you gotta go through it
It doesn't matter baby
Loving you's a dirty job
But somebody's gotta do it

There were times when we'd never fake it
There were times when we'd always make it
There were times when we'd take it to the limit
And we'd never, never, ever leave each other alone
We were flesh and blood and bone
There were times we had it all
There were times we had it all

There were times when we took our chances
There were times we were damn good dancers
There were times when we heard all the answers
In the beating of the drummer and the riches of the rock and the roll
I can see right through your soul
There were times we had it all
There were times we had it all

If your fears could only be forgotten
We could pull all of the barriers down
Would you follow your dreams' desire?
Would you follow your secret dreams and forbidden fire?
Let's just peel out of this town
It's been nothing but dreams
It's been nothing but dreams until now
You're never gonna see it
You got your head stuck in the sand
It's the land of the free and easy Street
It's the home of the damned
You're never gonna see it
You better open up your eyes
You're the only one who's left
Who's gonna believe all your lies
I can't explain it away, it doesn't make any sense
To know what it's like
I guess you gotta go through it
I guess you gotta go through it
I guess you gotta go through it
It doesn't matter baby
Loving you's a dirty job
But somebody's gotta do it

There were times when our bodies glistened
There were times that we can't stop missing
There were times that we'd lay in bed and listen
To the pounding, pounding chorus of our desperate hearts
Nothing could have torn us apart
There were times we had it all
There were times we had it all
There were times when we fought like tigers
There were times we were damn good liars
There were times we extinguished every fire
That was burning, burning, burning up each other alive
From the heavens on down to the dives
There were times we lost it all we lost it all
There were times we lost it all we lost it all

There were times when we fought like tigers
There were times we were damn good liars!

There were times when our bodies glistened
There were times that we can't stop missing
There were times that we'd lay in bed and listen
To the pounding, pounding chorus of our desperate hearts
Nothing could have torn us apart
There were times we had it all
