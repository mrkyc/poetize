To pick you up when you were falling down
Now baby - when you were crying the blues
Wasn't I the one that you came crying to?
In all the years gone by
You've never seen me cry
I never let you see the other side of me
Where were you
When I needed somebody to lean on?
Yeah where were you
When I needed a shoulder to cry on?
I always held you close when you were feeling weak
Guess I was walking down a one-way street
I was a fool to think that you'd be there for me
Where were you?
Oh baby - when you needed a friend
I stuck beside you girl through thick and thin
Now Baby - when no-one cared at all
Wasn't I the one that you would always call
I gave away my heart, I knew just where I stood
Till I reached out for you 'cause I thought I could
Where were you
When I needed somebody to lean on?
Yeah where were you
When I needed a shoulder to cry on?
I always held you close when you were feeling weak
Guess I was walking down a one-way street
I was a fool to think that you'd be there for me
Where were you?

The cut that hurts the most is your attitude
You're pretty good at taking what you need
You've got a lot to learn about loyalty...
Believe me baby...there were times
You drove me crazy...I was so blind
Where were you?
I never let you down when you were full of fear
Saved you from drowning in a sea of tears
Why baby why then weren't you ever
There for me?
Where were you
When I needed somebody to lean on?
Yeah where were you
When I needed a shoulder to cry on?
I always held you close when you were feeling weak
Guess I was walking down a one-way street
I was a fool to think that you'd be there for me
