Recorded in 1986 for the soundtrack to the film 'the wraith', starring charlie sheen. Lyrics taken from careful listening
If it was a matter of money
You'd be in by now
She'd be lying by your side
You'd be thinking
Love's door is open wide
You feel defeated
But you're acting proud
Would you try to hide it?
She doesn't care how you come at all
You know all that matters
Is that your love is strong
It's a matter of the heart
It's a matter of the soul
You know a good love only starts
When you start to lose control
And she's calling out your name
And she needs you in the night
You gotta run into the flame
'til you're blinded by the light
You've got to take her in your arms
And let her know
She'll always be your spark
It defines a mans' heart
It's just a matter of the heart

All the tales you told
Ready to believe
You're so together
There's nothing you can't do, no
But first impressions only leave her cold
It isn't what she needs
She doesn't care about the world you planned
She'll run to you, if you understand
It's a matter of the heart
It's a matter of the soul
You know a good love only starts
When you start to lose control
And she's calling out your name
And she needs you in the night
You gotta dive into the flame
'til you're blinded by the light
Oh... Instrumental
It's a matter of the heart
It's a matter of the soul
You know a good love only starts
When you start to lose control
And she's calling out your name
And she needs you in the night
You gotta run into the flame
'til you're blinded by the light
It's a matter of the heart
