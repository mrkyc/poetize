Oh there ain't no bugs on me
There ain't no bugs on me
There may be bugs on some of you mugs
But there ain't no bugs on me
Well, the Juney bug comes in the month of June
The lightning bug comes in May
Bed bug comes just any old time
But, they're not going to stay
Chorus 2
Oh there ain't no bugs on me
There ain't no bugs on me
There may be bugs on the rest of you mugs
But there ain't no bugs on me
Well, a bull frog sittin' on a lily pad
Looking up at the sky
The lily pad broke and the frog fell in
He got water all in his eye...ball

Mosquito he fly high
Mosquito he fly low
If old mosquito lands on me
He ain't a gonna fly no mo'
You might also like
A peanut sittin' on a railroad track
His heart was all a flutter
Along come a choo-choo on the track
Toot! Toot! Peanut butter!

Well little bugs have littler bugs
Up on their backs to bite 'em
And the littler bugs have still littler bugs
And so ad infinitum

As I went walking through the woods
Humming a tune so gaily
The wind come whistling through the trees
And froze my ukelele

Oh there ain't no flies on me
There ain't no flies on me
There may be flies on some of you guys
But there ain't no flies on me
Oh there ain't no lobsters on me
There, ain't no lobsters on me
There may be lobsters on some of you mobsters
But there ain't no lobsters on me
Oh it ain't gonna rain no more no more
It ain't gonna rain no more
How in the heck can I wash my neck
When it ain't gonna rain no more?
Oh it ain't gonna rain no more, no more
It ain't gonna rain no more
How in the hell can the old folks tell
If it ain't gonna rain no more?
