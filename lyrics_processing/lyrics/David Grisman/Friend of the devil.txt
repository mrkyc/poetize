I was trailed by twenty hounds
Didn't get to sleep last night
Till the morning came around
And I set out running but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
I just might get some sleep, tonight
I ran into the devil
And he loaned me twenty bills
I spent the night in Utah
In a cave up in the hills
And I set out running but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
I just might get some sleep, tonight
I got two reasons why I cry away each lonely night
The first one's named sweet Anne Marie and she's my heart's delight
Second one is prison baby, the sheriff's on my trail
And if he catches up with me I'll spend my life in jail
Got a wife in Chino babe
And one in Cherokee
First one says she's got my child
But it don't look like me
I set out running but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
I just might get some sleep, tonight
I got two reasons why I cry away each lonely night
The first one's named sweet Anne Marie and she's my heart's delight
Second one is prison baby, the sheriff's on my trail
And if he catches up with me I'll spend my life in jail
I ran down to the levee
But the devil caught me there
He took my twenty dollar bill
And vanished in the air
I set out running but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
I just might get some sleep, tonight
Yeah, I set out running but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
