Yeah

The sunlight sneakin' through the window
Slidin' down your pillow, shinin' like a halo, baby
I like wakin' up before you
Just so I can watch you sleepin' like an angel, baby
Five minute sweet spot
Before the alarm clock goes off and ruins everything

I got two hands and all they wanna do is hold ya
I got two eyes that are dyin' to watch you wakin' up
I got a kiss that'll get you thinkin' it's Saturday
I'll give you a reason, I'll give you a reason to stay

Coffee, you ain't gonna need it
It only gets you leavin' sooner than I want you to
Let's just stay under the covers, tangled in each other
Straight on through the afternoon

You always say that I can't make you late
But I bet I can make that a lie, huh

I got two eyes that are dyin' to watch you wakin' up
I got a kiss that'll get you thinkin' it's Saturday
I'll give you a reason, I'll give you a reason to stay
I really like the way your head fits on my shoulder
I hate the way the morning's always tryna mess this up
I know you've got a thousand things to do today
But I'll give you a reason, I'll give you a reason to stay
A reason to stay

Whoa, you always say that I can't make you late
But I bet I can make that a lie

I got two hands and all they wanna do is hold ya
I got two eyes that are dyin' to watch you wakin' up
I got a kiss that'll get you thinkin' it's Saturday
I'll give you a reason, I'll give you a reason to stay
I really like the way your head fits on my shoulder
I hate the way the morning's always trying to mess this up
I know you've got a thousand things to do today
But I'll give you a reason, I'll give you a reason to stay

Oh, a reason to stay
Oh, oh, to stay
