Hey, girl
Yeah

The picture ain't in the picture frame where it used to hang
I had to take that down, hm
And the funny thing is the phone will ring and I'll think it's you
But it ain't you now, no
I don't always think about you, girl, but when I do
I can't keep myself from crazy missin' you

We used to stay up all night kissin'
Dancin' barefoot in the kitchen
Tippin' glasses of red wine, splashin'
We used to hold each other 'til the mornin'
Before you know it, then you're in over your head
Then it's over too soon
No matter what I do, it just ain't no use
I just can't get used to missin' you, no
Oh, no, no

In the bottom drawer is the old t-shirt that you always wore
I couldn't throw that out, oh no
'Cause a broken heart's still a broken heart
Even when you start breakin' memories down, whoa
I'm gettin' pretty good at actin' like I'm movin' on
Then a song you used to sing comes on
And I start wishin' you weren't gone

Well, I don't always think about you, girl, but when I do
