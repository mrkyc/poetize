You're getting on with life and
Making sure that i can't
Get inside your mind
Cause nothing can be gained
By living in yesterday... Yeah
But i'm falling apart
I'm lying in the dark
And wondering how to start
To mend a broken heard
Cause everything was lost
The day you went away... yeah
Now there's nothing left that's real
And i've forgotten how to feel
When I'm outside of your arms
Because you're all I've ever known
But you've been moving on
And remaining strong
It's like you're happy on your own
I guess I'll be in love alone
There's nobody to blame
If love is just a game
And you refuse to play
I guess I'll be okay
Cause life will still go on
Even with you gone

You change the way I breathe
You're all that I can see
And if it's meant to be
This love that I still keep
Will bring you back to me... Yeah .yeah
Now there's nothing left that's real
And i've forgotten how to feel
When I'm outside of your arms
Because you're all I've ever known
But you've been moving on
And remaining strong
It's like you're happy on your own
I guess I'll be in love alone
I'm sorry if I have to much
Cause you told me from the start
That you didn't plan
To fall in love... Woah
Now there's nothing left that's real
And i've forgotten how to feel
When I'm outside of your arms
Because you're all I've ever known
But you've been moving on
And remaining strong
It's like you're happy on your own
Now there's nothing left that's real
And i've forgotten how to feel
When I'm outside of your arms
Because you're all I've ever known
But you've been moving on
And remaining strong
It's like you're happy on your own
I guess I'll be in love alone... Yeah
