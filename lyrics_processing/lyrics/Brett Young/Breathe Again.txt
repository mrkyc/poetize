And what was on my chest
Out of love, out of line
Nearly out of my mind
I'm tired of waiting
Giving all my best
In a maze, in a haze
I was wasting my time
I was broken, I was scared
But now I'm coming up for air
You came around
Turn me inside out and upside down
I had no plans to try again
Or let somebody in
Without a sound
You stole my heart and knocked me to the ground
Gave freedom to the wind
And teaching me to breathe again
Lungs are burning
My walls were closing in
On the floor needing more
Than a door or window

I couldn't win
You were there in a prayer
With a glimmer of hope
I was shaken, I was sure
That I would never find the cure
You came around
Turn me inside out and upside down
I had no plans to try again
Or let somebody in
Without a sound
You stole my heart and knocked me to the ground
Gave freedom to the wind
Teaching me to breathe again
Teaching me to open up
Teaching me to care
Teaching me to take a chance
Feels like I'm almost there
You came around
Turn me inside out and upside down
I had no plans to try again
Or let somebody in
Without a sound
You stole my heart and knocked me to the ground
Gave freedom to the wind
You came around
Turn me inside out and upside down
I had no plans to try again
Or let somebody in
Without a sound
You stole my heart and knocked me to the ground
Gave freedom to the wind
Teaching me to breathe again
