Yeah
I put you out like a cigarette
Poured you down the drain with no regrets
Went through 11 of those 12 steps
But 11 ain't enough I guess
One phone call on a lonely night
And we're both back at the startin' line
Now there's ashes in the ashtray
Lipstick on the bottle
Back on the same road, goin' full throttle
And just like that

We go fallin' off the wagon
Got ourselves a real bad habit
Girl, you got me actin' like an addict
All messed up, no matter what
You know I just gotta have it
Even though it winds up tragic
Tonight, whatever happens, happens
And tomorrow, we'll get back on the wagon
Yeah
We'll get back on the wagon, whoa

So let's let both ends of the candle burn
Love like the mornin' light won't hurt
Wake up lyin' 'bout lessons learned
'Cause that's just what we do
Again and again
