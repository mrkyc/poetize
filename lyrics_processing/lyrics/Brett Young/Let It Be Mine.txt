The look that haunts you, the eyes that caught you
The voice that stops you on a dime, let it be mine
The hands that fit you, the song that gets you
The drink that makes you spill your mind, let it be mine

If you need someone to call tonight
A place to crash and let your body fall tonight
If you're lookin' for a kiss to make it all alright
If you're gonna to cross the line
If you're gonna take somebody's time
Let it be mine, let it be mine

The dream that steals you, the touch that heals you
The kind of wild that drives you wild, even if it's just a little while
(Just a little while)
A home that needs you, secret that keeps you
A book that reads between your lines, let it be mine

If you need someone to call tonight
A place to crash and let your body fall tonight
If you're lookin' for a kiss to make it all alright
If you're gonna to cross the line
If you're gonna take somebody's time
Let it be mine, girl, let it be mine
Ooh, let it be mine

But let it be mine, let it be mine
And I don't know what road you're gonna take this time
But let it be mine, ooh let it be mine

If you need someone to call tonight
A place to crash and let your body fall tonight
If you're lookin' for a kiss to make it all alright
If you're gonna to cross the line
If you're gonna take somebody's time
Ooh, let it be mine
Oh, let it be mine
Girl, let it be mine, let it be mine
