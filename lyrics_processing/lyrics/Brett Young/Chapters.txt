In chapter one, I was raised on the Dodgers
Every boy wants to be like his father
In Little League, when he was coachin' me
I was hangin' on every word
Sundays, he was the one who would lead us
Taught me everything I know about Jesus
Front row, he's on a roll, and I'm hangin' on every word
It sounds nice, doesn't it?
I wish that I knew back then

There's no perfect life, you can't hold back time
But you hold on tight, hopin' you might find
Every page you turn is a lesson learned
Ain't we all, ain't we all just tryna get it right?
These are the chapters of my life, mmm

Phase two, overwhelmed by attention
Everybody expectin' perfection
Throw a ball, then you'll have it all
Best thing I ever heard
Things change in the blink of an eyelid
Guess my body knew way more than I did
Doc said you'll never play again
Worst thing I ever heard
It's sounds rough, doesn't it?
I wish I knew back then

There's no perfect life, you can't hold back time
But you hold on tight, hopin' you might find
Every page you turn is a lesson learned
Ain't we all, ain't we all just tryna get it right?
These are the chapters of my life
The chapters of my life

Truth is that we all got stories
Gotta fail on your way to glory
Takes time tryna get it right
But every future has a past
And right now I can hear God laughin'
Guess he must have heard my plans
And my odes, thought it was a joke
Gave me more than I could ask
And I wish I knew back then, oh

There's no perfect life, you can't hold back time
(Can't hold back time)
But you hold on tight (And you hold on tight)
Hopin' you might find
Every page you turn (Page you turn)
Is a lesson learned
Ain't we all, ain't we all just tryna get it right?
These are the chapters of my life
Chapters of my, chapters of my life
Chapters of my life
Chapters of my, yeah
The chapters of my life
Ooh, my life
The chapters of my life, oh
