Gate 22, two hour delay
She was waiting on a plane to L.A.
I didn't see the harm in sittin' down
At the wrong gate
She said "Hello, where you headed to?"
I didn't lie, but I bent the truth
Said "I'd go anywhere with you"
And before long

It was midnight in the middle of JFK
Tryna take her mind off the fallin' rain
I was saying anythin' to make her laugh
Never wanted anything so bad
She got me wishing that she could stay
Doesn't even know that I missed my plane
Now there ain't a single thing I wouldn't trade
For a ticket to L.A., yeah, yeah
A ticket to L.A., yeah, yeah, yeah

She opened up after a drink
Said she's starting law school in the spring
And by the time that she had three
I knew almost everything
Lightnin' flashed across the sky
I said it probably wasn't safe to fly
Secretly, I hoped that she'd be stuck with me all night

She got me wishin' that she could stay
Doesn't even know that I missed my plane
Now there ain't a single thing I wouldn't trade
For a ticket to L.A.

Now gate 22 is calling out her name
She wrote her number on my hand and walked away

Alone here in the middle of JFK
Sitting at a bar at an empty gate
I'd do anythin' to bring her back
Never wanted anything so bad
She got me wishin' that she could stay
Doesn't even know that I missed my plane
Now there ain't a single thing I wouldn't trade
For a ticket to L.A., yeah, yeah
A ticket to L.A., yeah, yeah
A ticket to L.A.
A ticket to L.A.
A ticket to L.A.
Woo-hoo-hoo, woo-hoo-hoo
