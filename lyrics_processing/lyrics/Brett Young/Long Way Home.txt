Everybody's got a story
Everybody's been hurt
Everybody got scars and broken hearts, they don't deserve
Everybody is a dreamer
Until they wake up
Everybody's made of stone
Until their bones return to dust

You're never really lost if you never stop looking
You gotta keep moving if your heart's on fire
Love is gonna find a way to find you wherever you go, oh-oh, oh
When the clouds get dark and you can't see nothing
Sun still shines on the other side
Everybody gets to Heaven on a broken road, oh-oh, oh
Some of us gotta take the long way home

Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

I remember all the lonely
Sleepless nights
And I remember that moment that you walked into my life
