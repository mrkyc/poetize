When you see somebody
Who erases everybody in the room
I don't know what to say, I don't know what to do
That's what you did to me when I saw you
Under strung-up white lights, dancin' all alone
I wanna know you like I know every road back home
From that first tell-all, I knew that I'd never, I'd never let you go

Oh, I
I don't wanna change who you are
I don't wanna mess with your dreams
Or get in the way of who you wanna be
No, I
I won't stop your runaway heart
I just wanna be why you stay
Only thing about you that I'd change is
I'd change your name

I can't see 20 years from now
Hell, I can barely see today
Can't promise you your sky won't drop a little rain
When that smile in the mirror disappears
I promise you I'll be right here

No, I
I won't stop your runaway heart
I just wanna be why you stay
Only thing about you that I'd change is
I'd change your name

I'd change the face you see
When you open up your eyes
I'd change the lips you kiss
When you say goodnight
For the rest of your life

Oh, I
I don't wanna change who you are
I don't wanna mess with your dreams
Or get in the way of who you wanna be
No, I
I won't stop your runaway heart
I just wanna be why you stay
Only thing about you that I'd change is
I'd change your name
Change your name
