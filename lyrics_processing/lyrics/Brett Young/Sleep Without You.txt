Oh, babe

Never thought I would be like this
Wide awake waitin' on a goodnight kiss
Sippin' ninety proof, talkin' to the moon
Countin' down the hours till its two AM
Never thought I would be like this

But as long as the night ends with you in a yellow cab Shootin' me a text sayin'
Comin' home soon
As long as I can bet on you crawlin' into bed after slippin' out ya high heel shoes
I ain't lyin' sayin' have a good time
Out with your girls, girl do what you do
No matter how late, baby I'll be stayin' up
I can't sleep without you

I'd be tossin' and turnin' all night babe
From the smell of your hair on the pillow case
Even if I tried without you by my side
I'd be dreamin with my eyes open
I'd be tossin' and turnin' all night babe
