Ooh-ooh

Do you ever think about me and miss the way I looked at you?
And do you ever reach across the sheets for me like you used to?
And do you ever wake up lonely, and you just can't leave the room?
Do you ever wonder the way I wonder if we let go? Did we let go?

I've been going out with friends, I've been drinkin' too much whiskey
Burnin' candles at both ends, but nothin' seems to fix me
'Cause no matter what I do, I still wake up missin' you
Do you do that too? Did we let go, did we let go, did we let go too soon?

And do you live in New York City or did you move to Newport Beach?
Do you compare every guy that you meet to me?
And do you ever feel broken? Do you ever feel lost?
Baby, is this really over, or did we just let it stop?

'Cause I've been goin' out with friends, I've been drinkin' too much whiskey
Burnin' candles at both ends, but nothin' seems to fix me
'Cause no matter what I do, I still wake up missin' you
Do you do that too? Did we let go, did we let go, did we let go too soon?

Yeah, yeah

All that I can think about is what would happen if you stayed
And all I need to know right now is do you ever feel the same?

'Cause I've been goin' out with friends, I've been drinkin' too much whiskey
Burnin' candles at both ends, but nothin' seems to fix me
'Cause no matter what I do, I still wake up missin' you
Do you do that too? Did we let go, did we let go, did we let go too soon?

Did we let go too soon? Oh-oh
