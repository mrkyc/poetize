Only now it's gone, I can see the year
See it for what it was and start another day
All the liberty you took, the love that you abused
The friends that you turned against me if you could
And you're twisting what I say, all that saying you were scared
It doesn't matter anymore 'cause I'm not there
You were careless when the beat kicked in and careless when it left
And careless all the way, I didn't see it till the end

I feel nothing when you cry
I hear nothing, see no need to reply
I can smile now and turn away
Come over here, so you can see me walk away and celebrate
The end of night (The end of night)
The end of night (The end of night)
The end of night (The end of night)
The end of night (The end of night)

It only takes one lie to bring this house down
Behind closed doors, no one tells the first time 'round
Pain is worse when you bring it on yourself
The sweetest bully building, a love that couldn't last
You were ugly when the beat kicked in and ugly when it left
And ugly all the way, I didn't see it till the end
You might also like
I feel nothing when you cry
I hear nothing, see no need to reply
I can smile now and turn away
Come over here, so you can see me walk away and celebrate
The end of night (The end of night)
The end of night (The end of night)
The end of night (The end of night)
The end of night (The end of night)
The end of night (The end of night)
The end of night (The end of night)
The end of night (The end of night)
The end of night (The end of night)

After the fall comes love
I hate to hate and love to love
After the fall comes love
I hate to hate and love to love

I feel nothing when you cry
I hear nothing, see no need to reply
I can smile now and turn away
Come over here, so you can see me walk away and celebrate
The end of night (The end of night)
The end of night (The end of night)
The end of night (The end of night)
The end of night (The end of night)
The end of night (The end of night)
The end of night (The end of night)
The end of night (The end of night)
The end of night (The end of night)
The end of night (The end of night)
The end of night (The end of night)
The end of night (The end of night)
