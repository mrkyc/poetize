Has a colorful world
Held a colorful girl like you
You gotta fly
Never ever have I
Been just black or just white
All this freedom and flight has got me feeling high
Never have I ever felt like this before
I've never been the one to knock but now I'm at your door
Well listen very closely you can hear the sound
Of a love that makes my heart beat and my head spin 'round
Head spin 'round, spin 'round, spin 'round, spin 'round, 'round, 'round
I spin 'round, I spin 'round, I spin 'round
(Let's all just turn into pure light)
A rush runs from my heart
The room is spinning to red
The blood is leaving my head
You're such a chemical
It feels like fire and ice
You bring my body to life
Melting into the night just like a butterfly

Well listen very closely you can hear the sound
Of a love that makes my heart beat and my head spin 'round
Head spin 'round, spin 'round, spin 'round, spin 'round, 'round, 'round
I spin 'round, I spin 'round, I spin 'round
