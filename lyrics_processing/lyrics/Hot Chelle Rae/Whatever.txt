I woke up late, again
Gonna get fired for sure this time
So I'll hit the snooze
And sleep 'til it's 4 in the afternoon
The state, I'm in
Is bound to land me in the loony bin
And I don't care at all
(What, whatever)

When the girl you like thinks you're gay
What, whatever
You got a bunch of bills you can't pay
What, whatever
When nothing's ever going your way (your way)
Whatever
When you're shit out of luck
And you're feeling stuck, just say
So what, whatever
You might also like
Hey, hey, life ain't fair
Three in the air if you just don't care
Hey, hey, life ain't fair
Three in the air if you don't care

I was talking on the phone
Ran into the back of a Cadillac
Then I hit the gas
So the six-foot chick wouldn't kick my ass
But I'm not alone
My friends were all there when I got home
And we don't care at all
(What, whatever)

We're going out, on the town again
You better find a hot tub, 'cause we're jumping in
'Cause you know (I know)
That today straight sucked
And if you don't give a what, I don't give a what
We're going out, on the town again
You better find a hot tub, 'cause we're jumping in
'Cause you know (I know)
That today straight sucked
And if you don't give a what
I don't give a what (what-what-what)
