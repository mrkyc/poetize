Uno, dos, tres

It's been a really, really messed up week
Seven days of torture, seven days of bitter
And my girlfriend went and cheated on me
She's a California dime, but it's time for me to quit her

La, la, la, whatever
La, la, la, it doesn't matter
La, la, la, oh, well
La, la, la

We're going at it tonight, tonight
There's a party on the rooftop top of the world
Tonight, tonight, and we're dancing on the edge of the Hollywood sign
I don't know if I'll make it, but watch how good I'll fake it
It's alright, alright, tonight, tonight

Woke up with a strange tattoo
Not sure how I got it
Not a dollar in my pocket
And it kinda looks just like you
Mixed with Zach Galifianakis, huh
You might also like
La, la, la, whatever
La, la, la, it doesn't matter
La, la, la, oh, well
La, la, la

We're going at it tonight, tonight
There's a party on the rooftop top of the world
Tonight, tonight, and we're dancing on the edge of the Hollywood sign
I don't know if I'll make it, but watch how good I'll fake it
It's alright, alright, tonight, tonight

You got me singing like, woah
C'mon! Oh, it doesn't matter, woah
Everybody now, oh!

Just don't stop, let's keep the beat pumpin'
Keep the beat up, let's drop the beat down
It's my party, dance if I want to
We can get crazy, let it all out!
Just don't stop, let's keep the beat pumpin'
Keep the beat up, let's drop the beat down
It's my party, dance if I want to
We can get crazy, let it all out!
It's you and me, and we're runnin' this town
And it's me and you, and we're shakin' the ground
And ain't nobody going to tell us to go
'Cause this is our show!
Everybody! Woah! C'mon!
Oh, all you animals!
Woah! Let me hear you now (Oh!)

Tonight, tonight
There's a party on the rooftop-top of the world
Tonight, tonight, and we're dancing on the edge of the Hollywood sign!
I don't know if I'll make it, but watch how good I'll fake it
It's alright, alright, tonight, tonight
It's alright, alright, tonight, tonight
Yeah, It's alright, alright, tonight, tonight

Just singing like woah-oh-oh, c'mon
Oh-oh-oh, all you party people
Woah-oh-oh, all you singletons
Oh-oh-oh, even the white kids!

Just don't stop, let's keep the beat pumpin' (Woah-oh-oh)
Keep the beat up, let's drop the beat down (Oh-oh-oh)
It's my party, dance if I want to (Woah-oh-oh)
We can get crazy, let it all out! (Oh-oh-oh)
Just don't stop, let's keep the beat pumpin' (Woah-oh-oh)
Keep the beat up, let's drop the beat down (Oh-oh-oh)
It's my party, dance if I want to (Woah-oh-oh)
We can get crazy, let it all out! (Oh-oh-oh)
