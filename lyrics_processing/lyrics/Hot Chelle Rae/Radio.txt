(If you miss me, like I miss you)

I stayed up 'til 5 last night
Just to say I missed you
Thank God for free wifi
And the key to the mini bar
We fell asleep on Skype
I almost missed my flight
You know that I need ya
I'm out the door
Hasta la vista
A one, two, three, four!

No matter where I'm at
No matter where I go
I'll be singing for you on the radio
Like oh-oh-oh, radi-oh-oh-oh
You could be in Nashville, I could be in France
Here's a little somethin' just to make you dance
Like oh-oh-oh, radi-oh-oh-oh

Turn me up all the way
Pretend I'm right beside you
Like we're on holiday
And pounding two-buck chuck
Yeah, I've been everywhere
I've turned the Mona Lisa
And nothing I'm seeing
Compares to you
'Cause nobody does it
The way you do
You might also like
No matter where I'm at
No matter where I go
I'll be singing for you on the radio
Like oh-oh-oh, radi-oh-oh-oh
You could be in Nashville, I could be in France
Here's a little somethin' just to make you dance
Like ohh-ohh-oh, radi-ohh-ohh-oh

If you miss me, like I miss you
Through the airwaves, I'mma kiss you
Let's g-oh-oh-oh, radi-oh-oh-oh

Everywhere I go, I need ya
Comin' for ya through the speakers
Right there on the radio
Even when we feel the static
Know my love is automatic
Right there on the radio

Hey turn me up, turn me up, ah, ah, can you hear me?
Singing to you clearly, even when you ain't near me
Yeah, love through the airwaves
I hope this song in your head like hairspray
I heard your friends say I changed, so that's hearsay
They only say that when they drunk
So that's beer-say, anyway
I wrote you this little song because I wish you were with me
I'm callin' up to the station, requesting it in your city, girl
No matter where I'm at, no matter where I go
I'll be singing for you on the radio
Like oh-oh-oh, radi-oh-oh-oh
You could be in Nashville, I could be in France
And here's a little somethin' just to make you dance
Like oh-oh-oh, radi-oh-oh-oh

If you miss me, like I miss you
Through the airwaves, I'mma kiss you
Let's go-oh-oh-oh, radi-oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh

Radi-oh-oh-oh, radi-oh-oh-oh
Let's go-oh-oh, radi-oh-oh-oh
