Forever unstoppable
Forever, forever, forever unstoppable

Falling stars don't crash through your window
If you want it, go get it
It's meant to be chased
All your scars won't heal 'til you let go
You're perfectly worth it
Forget your mistakes
If you wanna fly
Leave this world with me
We'll touch the sky, let's defy this gravity
Hold on to me tight
When it all falls down

You can take my heart, if yours won't beat
We're forever unstoppable
If you're torn apart, I'll make you see
That nothing's impossible
When you're broken, and you're shattered
Love will save you, from disaster
You can take my heart, if yours won't beat
We're forever, forever, forever unstoppable

Yeah, we've both been touched by the same flame
Don't worry, I got ya
I won't let you burn
You and I got played by the same game
We're in it, together
For better or worse
If you wanna fly
Leave this world with me
We'll touch the sky, let's defy this gravity
Hold on to me tight
When it all falls down

You can take my heart, if yours won't beat
We're forever unstoppable
If you're torn apart, I'll make you see
That nothing's impossible
When you're broken, and you're shattered
Love will save you, from disaster
You can take my heart, if yours won't beat
We're forever, forever, forever unstoppable

There's a feeling inside you
Just dying to break through
Open up and set it free
We're on a horizon
Just look in my eyes, and you will see
When you're broken, and you're shattered
Love will save you from disaster
You can take my heart, if yours won't beat
We're forever unstoppable
If you're torn apart, I'll make you see
That nothing's impossible
When you're broken (when you're broken)
And you're shattered (and you're shattered)
Love will save you (love will save you)
From disaster (from disaster)
You can take my heart, if yours won't beat
(When you're broken, and you're shattered)
We're forever, forever, forever unstoppable
We're forever, forever, forever unstoppable
We're forever, forever, forever unstoppable

Forever unstoppable
Forever unstoppable
Forever unstoppable
