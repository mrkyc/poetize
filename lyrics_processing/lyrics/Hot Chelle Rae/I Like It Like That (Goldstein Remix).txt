Let's get it on, yeah, y'all can come along
Everybody drinks on me, buy out the bar
Just to feel like I'm a star, now I'm thanking the academy
Missed my ride home, lost my iPhone
I wouldn't have it any other way
If you're with me let me hear you say
I like it like that!
Hey windows down, chillin' with the radio on
I like it like that!
Damn, sun's so hot, make the girls take it all off
I like it like that!
Yeah, one more time, I can never get enough of everybody
Sing it right back, I like it like that!
(I like it like that, I like it like that)
Till the break of the dawn, yeah, party on my lawn
Whistle as the girls walk by if the cops roll up (so what?)
Pour the cops a cup cause everybody's here tonight
Call a taxi, pack the back seat
I wouldn't have it any other way
If you're with me let me hear you say
I like it like that!
Hey windows down, chillin' with the radio on

We havin' fun partying till the break of dawn
Go grab a cup I dunno what people waitin' on
And I'm gonna want a girl that I know I can take home
In the zone, where I think that I lost my phone
You can tell by looking in, the party's plain crack
