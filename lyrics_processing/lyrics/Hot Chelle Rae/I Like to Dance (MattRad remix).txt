Everybody's in a line now
Dressed up to the nines now, baby
Silver, shiny, sexy, it's love
And the music's playing so loud
Disco balls and big crowds, baby
Her eyes, they tell me what I need to know
Your touch, it tells me where I need to go
My lead will make you wanna get so close
Well I like to dance
So if you do just get on the floor
Forget the romance
This is what music was created for
So find someone hot
And if you're not it doesn't matter
Baby, take what you got
And just go dancing you'll feel better
I like to dance
I like to dance, dance, dance, dance
Lovesick electric sex thoughts
Are flying all around me
He said she said "Let's leave," baby
You might also likeFashion lives alive in her dress
And her eyes, I'll never leave her
The song creates a fever, baby
Her eyes, they tell me what I need to know
Your touch, it tells me where I need to go
My lead will make you wanna get so close
Well I like to dance
So if you do just get on the floor
Forget the romance
This is what music was created for
So find someone hot
And if you're not it doesn't matter
Baby, take what you got
And just go dancing you'll feel better
Lovesick, lovesick electric
Lovesick, lovesick electric
Lovesick, lovesick electric
Lovesick, lovesick electric!
I like to dance
I like to dance
I like to dance
I like to dance
Well I like to dance
So if you do just get on the floor
Forget the romance
This is what music was created for
So find someone hot
And if you're not it doesn't matter
Baby, take what you got
And just go dancing you'll feel better
Well I like to dance
So if you do just get on the floor
Forget the romance
This is what music was created for
So find someone hot
And if you're not it doesn't matter
Baby, take what you got
And just go dancing you'll feel better
