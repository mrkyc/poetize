I'm not usually the type of guy to call twice
And leave a message every time (It's me again)
That's quite alright
And most days
I just dust them off like that
Girls text me, "You're the only one"
I text back
"'Cause you know where the party's at"

And I'm like, yeah
Everything you heard is true
Everybody knows I'm hung
Up on you (Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
And I'm like, yeah
Tell them other girls I'm through
Everybody knows I'm hung
Up on you (Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)

So big, this thing that we got goin' on
Ridin' 'round downtown when you take the top off, yeah
It turns me on (Ha!)
And I'm like, whoa
Girl, how'd you get me hooked like this?
One look, one touch, one kiss, one chick
And then I can't resist
You might also like
And I'm like, yeah
Everything you heard is true
Everybody knows I'm hung
Up on you (Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
And I'm like, yeah
Tell them other girls I'm through
Everybody knows I'm hung (Hung)
Up on you (Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-oh)
Hung up on you (Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-oh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-oh)

You got the style, you got the flavor
I want you now, I want you later
I'm hung up, so let's get down tonight
Floating around, a couple of gypsies
Shaking it up, we're getting tipsy
You show me yours
'Cause I'mma show you mine

And I'm like, yeah
Everything you heard is true
Everybody knows I'm hung up on you
Yeah, tell them other girls I'm through
Everybody knows I'm hung up on you
And I'm like, yeah
Everything you heard is true
Everybody knows I'm hung (Hung)
Up on you (Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
And I'm like, yeah (Yeah)
Tell them other girls I'm through (through)
Everybody knows I'm hung (Hung)
Up on you (Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-oh)
Hung up on you (Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-oh)

You got the style, you got the flavor
I want you now, I want you later
