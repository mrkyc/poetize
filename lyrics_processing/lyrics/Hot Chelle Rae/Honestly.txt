Honestly, why are my clothes out on the street?
Honestly, I think you've lost your mind
I can't believe I came home to find my car keyed
Honestly, I'm way too tired to fight
Round and round, drama every time

I'mma go 'cause I got no
Problem with saying goodbye
Is it wrong that I'm gonna be
Having the time of my life?
'Cause deep down I know
I should cry, I should scream
And get down on my knees
I should say that I need you here
But I'm gonna party tonight
'Cause honestly, I just don't care
Na-a-a, na-a-a
Honestly, I just don't care
Na-a-a, na-a-a, na-a-a-a

Honestly, everybody's stoked I'm finally free
Honestly, my phone's blowing up tonight
I'll go out, get drunk again
Make out with all your dumb friends
Tag your face
Just to rub it in

I'mma go 'cause I got no
Problem with saying goodbye
Is it wrong that I'm gonna be
Having the time of my life?
'Cause deep down I know
I should cry, I should scream
And get down on my knees
I should say that I need you here
But I'm gonna party tonight
'Cause honestly, I just don't care
Na-a-a, na-a-a
Honestly, I just don't care
Na-a-a, na-a-a, na-a-a-a

So don't roll up when they're playing my song
Don't act right when you know you're dead wrong
You're out of line, out of line, good night
I'm under cover, so you can drop that bomb
It's a little too late
'Cause I'm already gone
I'm already gone
Honestly, you did it to yourself
So don't blame me
I'mma go 'cause I got no
Problem with saying goodbye
Is it wrong that I'm gonna be
Having the time of my life?
'Cause deep down I know
I should cry, I should scream
And get down on my knees
I should say that I need you here
But I'm gonna party tonight

I'mma go 'cause I got no
Problem with saying goodbye
Is it wrong that I'm gonna be
Having the time of my life?
'Cause deep down I know
I should cry, I should scream
And get down on my knees
I should say that I need you here
But I'm gonna party tonight
'Cause honestly, I just don't care
Na-a-a, na-a-a
Honestly, I just don't care
Na-a-a, na-a-a
'Cause honestly, I just don't care
Na-a-a, na-a-a
Honestly, I just don't care
