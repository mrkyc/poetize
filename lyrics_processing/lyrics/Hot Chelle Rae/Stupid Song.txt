I gave her the world, she said goodbye
I gave her the stars, they didn't shine
I wish she was here, she's already gone
And all that I got was this stupid song
This stupid song

I've tried a thousand times
To read between the lines
I couldn't find the words
To get through to her
It blew up in my face
She said that I could be replaced
Who am I supposed to be?

What does she want from me?
What does she want from me?
Yeah

I gave her the world, she said goodbye
I gave her the stars, they didn't shine
I wish she was here, she's already gone
And all that I got was this stupid song
This stupid song
You might also like
I showed up at your door at the time we said before
You weren't even there to act like you care
Did everything I could, but never understood
How she couldn't see

What does she want from me?
What does she want from me?
Yeah

I gave her the world, she said goodbye
I gave her the stars, they didn't shine
I wish she was here, she's already gone
And all that I got was this stupid song
This stupid song

I've tried a thousand times
To read between the lines
I couldn't find the words
To get through to her
Did everything I could, but never understood
What does she want from me?
I still wanna hear those stupid lies
I'll always be that stupid guy
That wished you were here, still singing along
These stupid words to this stupid song

I gave her the world she said goodbye
I gave her the stars they didn't shine
I wish she was here, she's already gone
And all that I got was this stupid song
This stupid song
This stupid song
This stupid song

Oh, oh, oh, oh
