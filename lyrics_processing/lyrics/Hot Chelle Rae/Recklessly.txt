I'm so obsessed
Don't care how dumb I look
You must be bad cause you make me feel good
The more I'm with you the more I'm hooked
Oh, yeah

Tonight I gotta confess
The way you look in this light
I can't catch my breath
Feels like my world is on fire
It burns in my chest
Tell me you feel it too
We got nothing to lose

Just touch me, the way that I touch you
Love me, the way that I love you
Recklessly
And give me everything
And baby
Touch me, the way that I touch you
Love me, the way that I love you
Recklessly
And give me everything
You might also like
I'm trying to wake up and be beside you
Been acting crazy so what if that's true
You got me doing things I don't do
Oh yeah

Tonight I gotta confess
The way you look in this light
I can't catch my breath
Feels like my world is on fire
It burns in my chest
Tell me you feel it too
We got nothing to lose

Just touch me, the way that I touch you
Love me, the way that I love you
Recklessly
And give me everything
And baby
Touch me, the way that I touch you
Love me, the way that I love you
Recklessly
And give me everything
All I want is you and me
I want you recklessly
I need you next to me
Tonight
All I want is you and me
I want you recklessly
I need you next to me
Tonight

Need me, the way that I need you
Kiss me, the way that I kiss you
Recklessly, and give me everything
And baby

Touch me, the way that I touch you
Love me, the way that I love you
Recklessly
And give me everything

All I want is you and me
I want you recklessly
I need you next to me
Tonight
All I want is you and me
I want you recklessly
I need you next to me
