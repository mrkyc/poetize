You're riding in my car
I turn on the radio
I'm pulling you closer
But you keep telling me no
You say you don't like it
But I know that you're a liar

'Cause when we kiss
Ooh, fire
Fire, la la la la, fire

Late at night (Mmm-mmm-mmm)
You're taking me home
You say you wanna stay
But I want you to go
I say I don't love you
But you know I'm a liar

'Cause when we kiss
Ooh, fire (Woo)
Fire (La, la la la, la la, la la)
Fire (Woo)
You might also like
You had a hold on me
Right from the start
A grip so tight
I couldn't tear it apart
My nerves all jumpin'
Actin' like a fool
Your kisses might burn
But my heart...
Stays (Stays)
Cool (Cool)

Well, Romeo and Juliet
Samson and Delilah
Baby, you can bet
They were burnin' with desire
If I say split
If you say split
Then you know that I'd be lyin'
I know that you'd be lyin'

'Cause when we kiss
Ooh, fire (Ooh yeah)
Fire (Woo, woo, woo)
Fire (Mmm-mmm-mmm)
Fire (Oh, everybody sing)
When we kiss
I'm on fire
Your tenderness (Tenderness)
Gives me desire
I can't resist (I can't resist)
Your tender lips (Your tender lips)
When we kiss
Ooh (Oh oh yeah)
Fire (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Fire (Ooh, ooh) (Tenderness, tender lips)
Fire (Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah)
Fire (Oh, now)
When we kiss
I'm on fire
Your tenderness (Your tenderness)
Gives me desire (Gives me desire)
I can't resist (I can't resist)
Your tender lips (Your tender lips)
When we kiss (When we kiss, oh baby)
Ooh (Oh)
Fire (Oh oh oh oh oh)
Fire (Can't resist your tender lips)
Fire (La la la la la)
Fire (Oh, I'm on fire)
Fire (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Fire (Sing it all, sing)
Fire (Sing it, sing it, sing it)
Fire (Woo, sing it all)
