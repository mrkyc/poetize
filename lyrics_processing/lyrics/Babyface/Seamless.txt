Always givin' me hell every time that you drink
Two tequila shots in, now you wanna read me
Tryna have a good time, now you wanna make a scene
You deserve an Emmy, girl, go and get your Emmy, girl
See you be tryna do the most, you be tryna rock the boat
I was tryna make it work, tryna make this house a home
Act like I'm anybody, girl, I ain't everybody, girl
You don't know my body, how come I'm a body?

We 'posed to be seamless
But you love showin' off weakness
Gettin' all mad for no reason
Turnin' up on me for breathin' (Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh)
'Posed to be seamless
Arguin' every weekend
Switchin' up on me like seasons
Wanna fight? Never mind, keep it (Oh, oh)

I be tryna make plays for us
I be tryna start the wave for us
You too busy on stage, stuck in your ways
Settin' us back minutes and days, weeks and months (Yeah)
Swear I'm in it for love (Love), are you in it for the fun?
When we pop out, you act up
How I'ma roll with a shawty who can't handle liquor and cause a disruption? (No)
Girl, I'm out here tryna function (Ayy), take you to dinners and lunches (No)
Think it's okay to just lace up the clubs and I'm 'posed to roll with the punches
I cut it off like it's nothin (Oh, oh-oh, oh)

We 'posed to be seamless
But you love showin' off weakness (Oh, showin' off)
Gettin' all mad for no reason
Turnin' up on me for breathin' (Breathin', breathin', yeah, yeah)
'Posed to be seamless
Arguin' every weekend (Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)
Switchin' up on me like seasons
Wanna fight? Never mind, keep it (Nah, oh)

(Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
Don't be showin' out
(Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
Girl, why you showin' out?
(Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
We 'posed to be seamless (Seamless)

She got somethin' that she want to say (What you talkin' 'bout?)
If you listen, you can her pain (Man, she be showin' out)
And there's a reason why she acts that way
We supposed to be seamless, seamless
You need to tell her that your heart won't stray (What you talkin' 'bout?)
You need to show her that you're here to stay (Man, she be showin' out)
And if you ever wanna see things change
We're supposed to be seamless, seamless (Seamless)
We 'posed to be seamless (Seamless)
We 'posed to be seamless (Seamless)
