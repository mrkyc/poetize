We don't even have to talk about it
Just relax and let it flow
Let it flow, baby
Ooh, they don't know, they don't know
They don't know what they're talkin' 'bout
They don't know what goes on in our lives, baby
Ooh, all I know, all I know, all I know is when you touch me
Touch me, touch me, you give good, good, good, good...woo
That's right, let's do it, baby
Do it again...right there, right there

Somebody told me
There'd be trouble at home
'Cause we never talk a lot
When we spend time alone, ay
So how are we supposed to know
Know when something is wrong
Well, we've got a way to communicate
It keeps a happy home

And no one does it like me
And no one but you
Has that kind of whip appeal on me, yeah
You might also like
Keep on whippin' on me
Work it on me
Whip all your sweet sweet lovin' on me
Look-a here, baby

When we go to work
How the day seems so long
The only thing I think about
Can't wait 'til we get home
'Cause we got a way of talking
And it's better than words
It's the strangest kind of relationship
Oh, but with us it always works

And no one does it like me
And no one but you
Has that kind of whip appeal on me, oh

Whatever you want
(Whatever you want, baby)
It's alright with me
(Hey, it's alright with me)
'Cause you've got that whip appeal
(You, you, you)
So work it on me (yes)
It's better than love
Sweet as can be
You've got that whip appeal
So whip it on me
Oh, whatever you want (woo)
It's alright with me
(Alright with me)
'Cause you've got that whip appeal
(You've got that whip appeal)
So work it on me (Come on and work it on me)
It's better than love (Better than love)
Sweet as can be (Sweet as can be)
You've got that whip appeal
(Oh, you've got that whip appeal)
So whip it on me
(Come on and work it now, baby)
Oh, whatever you want
(Oh, ain't we good, we got a real good thing)
It's alright with me
(Just you and me, baby)
'Cause you've got that whip appeal
(We've got a good way of talking, baby)
So work it on me (It's better than words)
It's better than love
(Oh, wouldn't give it up for the world)
Sweet as can be
(Oh, don't wanna take it from me)
You've got that whip appeal
(No way...no way...)
So whip it on me
(No, oh, no way)
Whatever you want ('ever you want)
It's alright with me
(It's alright with me)
'Cause you've got that whip appeal
(You've got that whip appeal)
So work it on me (Come on and work it on me)
It's better than love (Better than love)
Sweet as can be (Sweet as can be)
You've got that whip appeal
(Oh, you've got it, oh, you've got it)
So whip it on me
(Oh, you've got it, baby)

Keep on whippin' on me
Oh-ho, work it on me
Hey, whip all your sweet sweet lovin' on me
Keep on whippin' on me
Ooh, work it on me
Whip all your sweet sweet lovin' on me
