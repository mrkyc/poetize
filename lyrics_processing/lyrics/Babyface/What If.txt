I ran into a friend of yours the other day
And I asked her how you've been
She said 'My girl is fine, just bought a house, got a job, a real good man.'
I told her I was glad for you, that's wonderful
But does she ever ask 'bout me?
'She says she's happy with her life right now, let her go, let her be.'

And I told myself I would
But something in my heart just would not let you go
I just wanna know...

What if we were wrong about each other?
What if you were really made for me?
What if we were supposed to be together?
Would that not mean anything?
What if that was supposed to be my house that you go home to every day?
How can you be sure that things are better
If you can't be sure your heart ain't still here with me?
Still wanting me

Your friend asked me if there was someone special
In my life that I was seeing
I told her there was no one in particular
There's just I, myself, and me
I told her that I dream of you quite often
She just cut her eyes at me
She said, 'You got a home, you're very happy
So just stop your meddling'
You might also like
I told her that I won't
I said things are cool, but I guess I was wrong
I still can't move on

What if we were wrong about each other?
What if you were really made for me? (Yeah, yeah)
What if we were supposed to be together?
Would that not mean anything?
What if that was supposed to be my house that you go home to every day?
How can you be sure that things are better
If you can't be sure your heart ain't still here with me?
Still wanting me

Now that could be my car
That could be my house
That could be my baby boy that you're nursing
That could be the trash which I always take out
That could be the chair that I love to chill in
That could be my food on the table at the end of the day
Hugs and the kisses, all the love we make
What the hell do you expect me to say?
What if it's really supposed to be this way? (Oh)
What if you're really supposed to be with me? (Oh)
What if we were wrong about each other?
What if you were really made for me?
What if we were supposed to be together? (Oh)
Would that not mean anything? (Yeah, yeah, baby)
What if that was supposed to be my house that you go home to every day?
How can you be sure that things are better
If you can't be sure your heart ain't still here with me? (Still with me, baby)
Still wanting me (Still wanting me, baby)

What if we were wrong about each other?
(What if we were wrong? What if we were wrong?)
What if you were really made for me? (Oh baby)
What if we were supposed to be together?
Would that not mean anything? (Anything, baby)
What if that was supposed to be my house that you go home to every day?
How can you be sure that things are better
If you can't be sure your heart ain't still here with me?
