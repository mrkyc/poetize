There was a girl I used to know
She was oh so beautiful
But she's not here anymore
She had a college degree
Smart as anyone could be
Had so much to live for

But she fell in love
With the wrong kind of man
He abused her love and treated her so bad
There was not enough education in her world
That could save the life of this little girl

How come, how long?
It's not right, it's so wrong
Do we let it just go on?
Turn our backs and carry on?
Wake up, it's too late
Right now, we can't wait
She won't have a second try
Open up your hearts
As well as your eyes
You might also like
She tried to give a cry for help
She even blamed things on herself
But no one came to her aid
"Nothing was wrong as far as we could tell"
That's what we'd like to tell ourselves
But no, it wasn't that way

So she fell in love
With the wrong kind of man
And she paid with her life
For loving that man
So we cannot ignore
We must look for the signs
And maybe next time we might save somebody's life

How come, how long?
It's not right, it's so wrong
Do we let it just go on?
Turn our backs and carry on?
Wake up, it's too late
Right now, we can't wait
She won't have a second try
Open up your hearts
As well as your eyes

Oh, I on occasion met that guy
He stirred a feeling deep inside
Something about him wasn't right
Oh, the way he proves himself a man
By beating his woman with his hands
I wish that she had seen the light
How can someone like this call themselves a man?
(He's not a man)
'Cause in reality he's far more less than
And we cannot ignore whenever we see the signs
'Cause any kind of abuse God knows is a crime

How come, how long?
It's not right, it's so wrong
Do we let it just go on?
Turn our backs and carry on?
Wake up, it's too late
Right now, we can't wait
She won't have a second try
Open up your hearts
As well as your eyes
