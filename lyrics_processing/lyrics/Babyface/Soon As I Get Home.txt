Hey, come here for a second
I don't like the way he treats you
He doesn't deserve you
He really don't

What kind of man
Would leave you standing in the cold?
Must've been a silly one
To sacrifice a pot of gold
You're the kind of woman
That needs a man that's always there
It's not that you require a lot
Just need some tender love and care, care

I give good love
I'll buy your clothes
I'll cook your dinner too (Yes)
Soon as I get home from work
I'll pay your rent
Your faithful lover (Ooh baby)
Soon as I get home, soon as I get home from work
Girl, I'll treat you right
And I'll never lie
For all that it's worth
I give good love (Good love, good love, good love, good love)
You might also like
It doesn't make sense
That you should have a broken heart
If I were the only one
I'd never let you fall apart
You're the kind of woman
Who needs a man with lots of cash
With a stack of major credit cards
And with me you don't have to ask, ask

Ooh, I give good love
I'll buy your clothes, baby
I'll cook your dinner too (Ooh baby)
Soon as I get home from work
I'll pay your rent, baby
Your faithful lover (Ooh baby, soon as...)
Soon as I get home, soon as I get home from work
Girl, I'll treat you right
And I'll never lie or flirt
(Girl, I'll never never never mess around, no)
Soon as I get home, soon as I get home from work
(I'm coming straight home to you, baby, yeah yeah)
Girl, I'll be around, never let you down
For all that it's worth
I give good love (Good love, good love, good love, good love)
Oh, I give good love (Good love, good love, good love, good love)
Oh baby, good love, oh, oh, oh-ho, ooh...
I give good love (Yeah, yes)
I'll buy your clothes

Soon as I get home, soon as I get home from work
