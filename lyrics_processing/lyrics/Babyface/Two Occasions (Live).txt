And no matter what the season nears, I still love you
With all my heart, I wanna be with you, ever
Wherever you are
A summer love is beautiful but it's not enough
To satisfy emotions that are shared between us
A winter love is cozy but I need so much more
It just intensifies my wants to have a love that endures
'Cause every time I close my eyes, I think of you
And no matter what the season nears, I still love you
With all my heart and I wanna be with you
Wherever you are
I only think of you on two occasions
That's day and night
I'd go for broke if I could be with you
Only you can make it right
An autumn love is special at this time of the year
But when the leaves are gone, does that love disappear?
I never underestimate the new love of spring
But I'm glad to say in my heart, I know my love's lasting
'Cause every time I close my eyes, I think of you
And no matter what the season nears, I still love you
With all my heart and I wanna be with you
Wherever you are
You might also likeI only think of you on two occasions
That's day and night
I'd go for broke if I could be with you
Only you can make it right, yeah
I only think of you on two occasions
That's day and night
I'd go for broke if I could be with you
Only you can make it right, yeah, yeah
'Cause every time I close my eyes, I think of you
And no matter what the season is, I still love you
With all my heart and I wanna be with you wherever
Wherever you are
I only think of you on two occasions
That's day and night
I'd go for broke if I could be with you
Only you can make it right
I only think of you on two occasions
That's day and night
I'd go for broke if I could be with you
Only you can make it right
'Cause it brings my life away to love
