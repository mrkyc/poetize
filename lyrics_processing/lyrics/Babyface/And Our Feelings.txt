We fell in love
And who could blame us?
The word was we were just beside ourselves
And everybody said it wouldn't last
Now they wonder why we didn't last
We fell in love
It seemed so righteous
Couldn't compare our love to no one else
And everybody thought we could not win
It's no wonder love came to an end

And our feelings just aren't feelings anymore
They're just words that come from whispers
From people we don't know
And our feelings, yeah, just aren't feelings anymore
They're just words without emotion
From people who don't know
Who don't know

We fell apart
The bond was broken
Should've kept our thoughts between ourselves
And though they say they cared, they didn't help
Makes me wonder, should we blame ourselves?
So here we are brokenhearted
What in the world have we done to ourselves?
When everybody says to let it end, baby
Well, it makes me wonder, we can't let them win

And our feelings, just aren't feelings anymore
They're just words that come from whispers
From people we don't know
Don't you know that our feelings just aren't feelings anymore
They're just words without emotion
From people who don't know

If we'd only just try, we could make it by
And maybe in time, we could make it right
If we only had done what we should've done
We'd both be here still making love
I wanna know that, that we can go back
Back to a time when the loving was all that
When no one could come between our love

And our feelings just aren't feelings anymore
They're just words that come from whispers from people we don't know
And our feelings, just aren't feelings anymore
They're just words without emotion
From people who don't know (No, no, no, no, no, no)
And our feelings (Feelings) just aren't feelings anymore (No more)
They're just words that come from whispers from people we don't know
(We don't know, baby)
And our feelings (Oh, oh) just aren't feelings anymore
(No, baby)
They're just words without emotion (They're just words, baby)
