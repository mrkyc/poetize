Oh, uh
Feels good
Everybody
(Oh, oh, oh; oh, oh, oh, tender lover, tender love)

Eleanor Rigby spends half her life all alone
No fault of her own
Made a decision
Love has no place in her home
Love, it has a right to go

Love has no limit
If you believe in love it'll open up, so
Don't ever give in
'Cause if it starts to give just hold on
We didn't make it
But love'll get you by if you only try
Just don't give up on love
'Cause it didn't work out this time

Tender lover
Girl, I'm so sorry
Well, I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to break your heart
Tender love, so brokenhearted
Well, I never meant to break your
Break your little tender heart
You might also like
Don't ever give up in spite of our love
Love is much too precious
It's greater than both of us
There's more than enough
Keep looking for love
Just be a believer
It'll give you what you want

Sky is the limit
If you believe in love it'll open up, so
Don't ever give in
'Cause if it starts to give just hold on
We didn't make it
But love'll get you by if you only try
Just don't give up on love
'Cause it didn't work out this time

My tender lover
Girl, I'm so sorry
Well, I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to break your heart
Tender love, so brokenhearted
Well, I never meant to break your
Break your little tender heart
My tender lover, ooh
Oh
(Oh, oh, oh; oh, oh, oh, tender lover, tender love)
Bla-blee-dibby-doo
(Oh, oh, oh) Woo (Oh, oh, oh)
Tender, tender lover (Tender lover)
Tender lover (Tender love)
Ah yeah

Love has no limit
If you believe in love it'll open up, so
Don't ever give in
'Cause if it starts to give just hold on
We didn't make it
But love'll get you by if you only try
Just don't give up on love
'Cause it didn't work out this time

My tender lover
Girl, I'm so sorry (So sorry, baby)
Well, I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to break your heart (Never meant to break you)
Tender love, so brokenhearted (Oh-oh)
Well, I never meant to break your
Break your little tender heart
Oh (Oh, oh, oh; oh, oh, oh, tender lover)
Tender lover (Tender love)
Oh (Oh, oh, oh; oh, oh, oh, tender lover, tender love)
Tender love
