I'm sitting here
Thinkin' 'bout
How I'm gonna do without
You around
In my life
And how am I, I gon' get by
Ain't got no days
Just lonely nights
If you want the truth
Well, girl, I'm not alright
Feel out of place
And out of time
I think I'm gonna lose my mind

So tell me how you feel (I'm lonely)
Are you for real? (So lonely)
Do you still think of me? (I think of you)
Baby still? (You only)
Do you dream of me at night? (It's like I dream you all the time)
So lo-o-o-o-o-one
Oh let me tell you how it feels (It's like every day I die)
Wish I was dreamin' but it's real (When I open up my eyes)
Oh let me tell you how it feels (And don't see your pretty face)
I think that I will never love agai-i-i-in
You might also like
I miss your face
I miss your kiss
I even miss, the arguments
That we would have
From time to time
I miss you standing by my side (By my side)
I'm dying here
It's clear to see
There ain't no you, God knows there ain't no me
Don't wanna live
I wanna die
If I can't have you in my life

So tell me how you feel (Oh)
Are you for real? (For real)
Do you still think of me? (I think of you)
Baby still? (You only)
Do you dream of me at night? (It's like I dream you all the time)
So lo-o-o-o-o-one
Oh let me tell you how it feels (It's like every day I die)
Wish I was dreaming but it's real (When I open up my eyes)
Oh, let me tell you how it feels (And don't see your pretty face)
I think that I will never love agai-i-i-in (Will never, I will never love again)
So tell me how you feel (Tell me how you feel, baby)
Are you for real?
Do you still think of me?
Baby still?
Do you dream of me at night? (It's like I dream you all the time)
So lo-o-o-o-o-one (So lonely, so lonely, so...)
Oh, let me tell you how it feels (It's like every day I die)
Wish I was dreamin' but it's real (When I open up my eyes)
Oh, let me tell you how it feels (And I don't see your pretty face)
I think that I will never love agai-i-i-in (I'll never ever ever love again, baby)
So tell me how you feel
Are you for real? (Are you for real?)
Do you still think of me? (Do you think of me?)
Baby still? (Baby, do you think of me?)
Do you dream of me at night? (It's like I dream you all the time)
So lo-o-o-o-o-one (So lonely, so lonely, so lonely)
Oh, let me tell you how it feels (It's like every day I die)
Wish I was dreaming but it's real (When I open up my, open up my eyes, baby)
Oh, let me tell you how it feels (And I don't see your pretty face)
I think that I will never love agai-i-i-in
(I think that I will never ever ever love again, baby)

So tell me how you feel
Are you for real?
Do you still think of me?
Baby still?
Do you dream of me at night? (It's like I dream you all the time)
