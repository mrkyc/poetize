I said I love you, baby
And I said I care
So when I tell you that I love you, darling
Don't you should understand that it means
I'm always gonna be there
I'm not gonna leave you
I ain't goin' nowhere
When I tell you I love you, baby
Cross my heart, I'll be there

Baby, come to me
I will chase your tears away
Put your trust in me
Girl, I swear I'll never change
Darling, you will see
That my love is here to stay
And I promise you, I will be true
From here and now, forever, girl, I...

When I tell you that I love you
It means I always will be there, yes, ooh
I'll never leave you
I ain't goin' nowhere
When I tell you I love you
Cross my heart, I'll be there
