He be playing you like you was a drive-thru
Looking for that quick love to go
I wonder when was the last time he held you
I bet you don't even know
He barely talks to you
Bet he don't even know your number
Got you on auto-dial
Still he ain't called in awhile
It's all about the clubs, right?
His clothes, it's all about himself, that's how he rolls
Ain't like you need a reason to believe him
Well, I got ten for you, girl

One, because I'm grown and sexy
Two, because I know much more
Three, you know I got what you're missin'
Unless you give me credit for my number four
Five, cause I don't need your money
Six, I got a real good job
Seven, I got cash
Eight, I got a crib
Even got a diamond if you're down for it
Nine, is 'cause I know you better than you know yourself
Ten is 'cause I'm grown and sexy like nobody else
You might also like
How you affordably get in that apartment
When he don't even want a job
The player don't amount to nothing
He still living with his moms
He only comes to you whenever he be needing something
You know he's running game on you
It's all that player do
It's all about his world, it's all that he knows
It's not about you girl, that's how he rolls
Ain't like you need a reason to believe him
Well, I got ten for you, girl

One, because I'm grown and sexy
Two, because I know much more
Three, you know I got what you're missin'
Unless you give me credit for my number four
Five, 'cause I don't need your money
Six, I got a real good job
Seven, I got cash
Eight, I got a crib
Even got a diamond if you're down for it
Nine, is cause I know you better than you know yourself
Ten is 'cause I'm grown and sexy like nobody else
Baby, come and go with me
Come and share my world
Share my world
He can't give you half the things I can give you, girl
Things like love, because I'm grown and sexy
Or understanding, I do it all for you
You don't need reason to believe him
Girl, I got ten for you

One, because I'm grown and sexy
Two, because I know much more
Three, you know I got what you're missin'
