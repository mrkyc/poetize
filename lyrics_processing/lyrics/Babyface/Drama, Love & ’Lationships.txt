It's not about who's right, or who's wrong
It's not about who's weaker, or who's strong
It's not about who's innocent, or whose fault
It ain't really 'bout that kind of thing at all
It's not about who does it, who done it, or did it to who
Don't matter if the both of you lose
It's really not 'bout nothing, except for me and you, girl

It's all about drama, and love, and 'lationships
And when the going gets tough, you deal with it
And you don't ever, you never walk away from it
You hold on (hold on), and be strong (be strong)
It's all about drama and trust, and making it
If you're somebody, mess up, you take it in
Don't let nobody come between you, you just stay with it
You hold on (hold on) and be strong (be strong)
And hold on (hold on, yes you do)

It's not about the stupid things that we say
We're always saying stupid things, anyway
It's not about the secrecy or the lies
Girl, everybody's got a secret to hide
It's not about who was it, or was she, who's creeping on who
Won't matter if the both of us lose
It's really not 'bout nothing, except for me and you

Hold on

Ain't 'bout your pride, ain't 'bout yourself
It's 'bout the two of you, and no one else
Ain't bout the hurt, ain't 'bout the lies
Ain't 'bout the crazy things that's running through your mind
It's 'bout the love that's supposed to last and never die

It's all about drama, and love, and 'lationships
And when the going gets tough, you deal with it
And you don't ever, you never walk away from it
You hold on (you hold on), and be strong (you be strong, baby)
It's all about drama and trust, and making it
If you're somebody, mess up, then you take it in, baby
Don't let nobody come between you, you just stay with it
You hold on (you hold on, baby) and be strong (you be strong, baby)
It's all about drama, and love, and 'lationships
And when the going gets tough, you deal with it
And you don't ever, you never walk away from it
