We started out as simple friends
That kind of friendship never ends, no baby
But we were fortunate to care enough
We knew just where we stood
But soon as love appeared
You turned away
And you were so unsure and so afraid
Of feeling what I was feeling
You were scared that love
Would blow your heart away
And you were certain that
In time my love would stray
So...

Where, where will you go?
And who, who's gonna love you like I do?
Where, where will you go?
And who's gonna love you like I do?

What kind of friends could we have been, yeah
If we had kept the feelings in?
When we had made a vow to be the friends
We were since we began
But soon as love appeared
You turned away
And you were so unsure and so afraid
Of feeling what I was feeling
You were scared that love
Would blow your heart away
And you were certain that
In time our love
You were thinking that our love was gonna stray
Oh, tell me where...
You might also like
Where will you go?
And tell me who
Who's gonna love you, baby, the way that I do?
Now, baby, where, where where, where where
Where will you go, where will you go?
And tell me who is gonna love, I wanna know who is gonna love
I need to know who's gonna love, who's gonna love who
Oh, help me, ooh...
Where, where will you go, baby?
Who's gonna love you, baby? Tell me
Who's gonna care for you, baby?
Who's gonna be there for you, baby?
Who's gonna love you like you need to be loved?
Where will you go, baby?
And who's gonna love you like I do?
Ooh baby, yes, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh...
I wanna know, I wanna know, I wanna know, I wanna know, baby...
