Sometimes we wish for the better
When we have it good as it gets
Sometimes the grass isn't greener
Soon as we find out, we forget

Sometimes a fool doesn't know he's a fool
Sometimes a dog, he don't know he's a dog
Sometimes I do stupid things to you
When I really don't mean it at all

Sometimes a man is gon' be a man
It's not an excuse, it's just how it is
Sometimes a wrong, don't know that they wrong
Sometimes the strong, ain't always so strong
Sometimes a girl is gon' be a girl
She don't want to deal with all the drama in your world
God knows I don't mean to give it to you
So girl, I'm sorry for the stupid things
I wish I didn't do but I do
Oh (So sorry, so sorry)
Oh no
Oh (So sorry, so sorry)
You might also like
Sometimes I wish I was smarter
Wish I was a bit more like you
Not making stupid decisions made at the last minute
You live to regret when it's through

Well, sometimes a fool, doesn't know he's a fool
And sometimes a dog, he don't know he's a dog
But sometimes I do stupid things to you
When I really didn't mean it at all

Sometimes a man is gon' be a man
It's not an excuse, it's just how it is
Sometimes a wrong, don't know that they wrong
Sometimes the strong, can't always be strong
Sometimes a girl, is gon' be a girl
She don't want to deal with all the drama in your world
God knows I don't mean to give it to you
So girl, I'm sorry for the stupid things
I wish I didn't do but I do

Sometimes a fool doesn't know he's a fool
And sometimes a dog, he don't know he's a dog
But sometimes I do stupid things to you
When I really didn't mean it at all
At all...
Sometimes a man is gon' be a man
It's not an excuse, it's just how it is
Sometimes a wrong, don't know that they wrong
Sometimes the strong, ain't always so strong
Sometimes a girl, is gon' be a girl
She don't want to deal with all the drama in your world
God knows I don't mean to give it to you, girl
So girl I'm sorry for the stupid things
I wish I didn't do but I do
Sometimes a man is gon' be a man
It's not an excuse, it's just how it is
Sometimes a wrong, don't know that they wrong
