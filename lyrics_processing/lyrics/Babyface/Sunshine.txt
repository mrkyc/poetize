Last night I laid with you
'Twas like a dream come true
I've never felt so right, no
Want you for the rest of my life

Maybe we should settle down and raise a family
A girl for you, and maybe me a boy for me
'Cause that is how much...that is how much
How much I love...you, girl...no, no, no, no

Sunshine
You brighten my life
Sunshine
You make me feel alright
Sunshine
You turned my darkness to light
And you, brighten up the colors of my life
My...life
(You really do, girl...woo)

Last night I prayed for you
That you will forever be cool
'Cause you've brought that love in my life, yes
And I gotta tell you, baby, the feeling so nice
You might also like
So maybe we should settle down and raise a family
A girl for you, and maybe me a boy for me
'Cause that's how much...that is how much
How much I love...you, girl...no, no, no, no-no-no

Sunshine
You brighten my life
Sunshine
You make me feel alright
Sunshine
You've turned my darkness to light
And you, brighten up the colors of my life
My, my, my, my life

Ay yeah
Maybe we should settle down and raise a family
A girl for you, and maybe me a boy for me
That is how much, yeah, that is how much
Hey, how much I love, I love, I love, I love
Love-luh-luh-luh-luh-love, love, I love you, girl

Sunshine, yeah
You brighten my life
(You know, you know, you know, you know you do, girl)
Sunshine
You make me feel alright
(You make me feel alright, baby)
Sunshine
You've turned my darkness to light
Brighten up the colors of my life
The corners of my mind
You do it, yes
And I promise I love everything about you, baby
I do, I do, I do, I do, baby
