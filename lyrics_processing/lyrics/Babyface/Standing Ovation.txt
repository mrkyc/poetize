I can't imagine how you be getting through the day
It must be hard when you be carrying all the weight
But even with that I see you rarely do complain
You give your heart and soul and still they don't appreciate you
Man or woman I got nothing but respect for you
Just knowing you got to deal with all the things we put you through
So I give a standing O to you
I raise my glass to you

I won't pretend to know
I can't begin to know
I'm fascinated on the daily how you do the things you do
Man or woman I ain't got a clue
Oh no
Girl I'm so mesmerized
I'm even mystified
Your affection shows in everything and anything you do
Man or woman I ain't got a clue no
It's amazing how you do all that you do
Suffice to say my hat goes off to you
A standing ovation
Ovation
And I just want to give a standing O to you
A standing ovation
You might also like
I can't imagine myself walking in your shoes
It's not even worth the challenge, I know I would lose
You're just extraordinary, way above the ordinary
There ain't no conversation, been that way since God's creation
Man or woman I can't help but be in awe of you
No matter what the deal somehow you always make it through
So
I give a standing O to you
I raise my glass to you


Man to woman I got nothing but respect for you
Just knowing you got to deal with all the things we put you through
So I give a standing O to you
I raise my glass to you


An ovation
I just wanna give a standing O to you
An ovation
A standing ovation
Ovation
A standing ovation
Ovation
