Baby, oh yeah
Baby, oh yeah

You don't ever bring no drama to the game
And my drama don't be scaring you away
You dont ever talk too much
(Exactly just enough)
You know how and when and where and what to say
It ain't like I gotta tell you you're so fine (you're so fine)
You been gettin' complements since you was nine
It's like your perfect (you're flawless)
A diamond in the rough
I knows you give me nothin' else but love (love)

You are such a mad sexy cool girl
How does someone turn into you, girl
How do you explain
What you do
What you say
How you be
How you play
How you love
Every day
How you're constantly the same
How you give
Never hate
And you don't ever change
Be consistently that way
You're a mad sexy cool girl, and I love you that way
Baby, ooh...
You might also like
You be ruling with a certain shade of cool (shade of cool)
I don't know nobody half as fresh as you
I be checkin' your behavior
Oh baby, you got so much flavor
Sometimes I wanna call you juicy fruit (juicy)
It ain't like I gotta tell you you're a star (you're a star)
You be shining and be sparkling in the dark
Girl, you're so perfect (you're flawless)
You my diamond in the rough
I know you give me nothin' else but love (love)

You are such a mad sexy cool girl
How does someone turn into you, girl
