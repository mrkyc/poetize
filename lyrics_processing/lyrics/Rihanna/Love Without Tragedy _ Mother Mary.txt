Red lipstick, rose petals, heartbreak
I was his Marilyn Monroe
Brown eyes, tuxedo, fast cars
A James Dean on the low
Dean on the low

I ask you, "What's the matter?"
You say "Oh, it's nothing at all."
Heart's racing outta control
And you knew that I couldn't let it go
You used to be this boy I loved
And I used to be this girl of your dreams
Who knew the course of this one drive injured us fatally?
You took the best years of my life
I took the best years of your life
Felt like love struck me in the night
I prayed that love don't strike twice

Red lipstick, rose petals, heartbreak
I was his Marilyn Monroe
Brown eyes, tuxedo, fast cars
A James Dean on the low

Mother Mary, I swear I wanna change
Mister Jesus, I'd love to be a queen
But I'm from the left side of an island
Never thought this many people would even know my name
As time flies way above me
For you, I've cried, tears ceding
Oh glory, the prayers carry me
I'll be a star, you keep directing me
Let's make the best scene they've ever seen

Let's capture the moment
'Cause even forever ain't forever
I swear by the moment
'Cause together ain't promise forever
Let's live in the moment
As long as we got each other
Die in the moment
I'm prepared to die in the moment
'Cause even forever ain't forever
I swear by the moment
'Cause together ain't promise forever
Let's live by the moment
As long as we got each other
Die in the moment
I'm prepared to die in the moment
To die in the moment
Mother Mary, I swear I wanna change
Mister Jesus, I'd love to be a queen
But I'm from the left side of an island
Never thought this many people would even know my name
As time flies way above me
For you, I've cried, tears ceding
Oh glory, the prayers carry me
I'll be a star, you keep directing me
Let's make the best scene they've ever seen

Let's capture the moment
'Cause even forever ain't forever
I swear by the moment
'Cause together ain't promise forever
Let's live in the moment
As long as we got each other
Die in the moment
I'm prepared to die in the moment
'Cause even forever ain't forever
I swear by the moment
'Cause together ain't promise forever
Let's live by the moment
As long as we got each other
Die in the moment
I'm prepared to die in the moment
To die in the moment
Die the moment
I'm prepared to die in the moment
I'm prepared to die in the moment
I'm prepared to die in the moment
'Cause even forever ain't forever
I swear by the moment
'Cause together ain't promise forever
