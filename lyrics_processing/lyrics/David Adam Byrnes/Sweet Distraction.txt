Sit there listenin' to the dial tone
Wonderin' if you're lonely and fightin' off the urge to call
So before I do somethin' I need to forget
I head to town in my old Chevrolet
Muster me up some courage with a little bit of alcohol
Oh I need to get you off my mind
So I'ma headin' out to find
A long legged red head
Skimpy little sun dress
Four lips sun kissed
Wants a little piece of this
Out to have a ball says hot damn hey y'all
Fine enough to stop me in my tracks
It's high time I put my plan into action
Lord I need a sweet distraction
I'm so sick and tired of these same old games
Nobody wins nothin' gets changed
Fed up with makin' up and breakin' up and makin' up again
(Yes I am)
I've done everything to keep me occupied
Workin' double shifts, fishin' with the guys
Watchin' NASCAR in smoky bars and buyin' rounds for all my friends
Oh, but none of that stuff does the trick
To get over you I'm gonna need a quick fix
