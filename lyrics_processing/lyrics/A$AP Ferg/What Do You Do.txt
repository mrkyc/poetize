She lickin' the tip, she put it on her tongue
She smokin' my dick, she coughin' up her lung
Please don't run, please don't run
She open her leg, I eat that thing for lunch
I get in her zone, I give her the bone, I tell her, "Let's have fun"
A couple of rounds, a five to four to three to two to one
They come to my house, they booty bounces like it's three to one
Feelin' my touch, fuckin' that bitch and she's lickin' my nuts
It's no love, ridin' that coupe 'cause she's fillin' my life
Baby, it's my life, snakes in that grass and I tell you no lie-ie-ie
You ride or die tonight
Don't tell me no lie, look in my eye
