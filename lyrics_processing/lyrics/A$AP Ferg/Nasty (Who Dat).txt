Your bitch been a fan while she hittin' my jack
Another deal with Adidas 'cause I'm feelin' like that
Now, now I just blow the money, got 'em swimmin' in cash
I don't even throw the money, sit the brick on her ass

All these bricks and money I been stackin'
All these dollars bustin' through the plastic

I'ma keep the money comin', keep dancin'
Tonight I fell in love with a stripper
Ferguson can be her last name
Who dat, who dat, who dat on your Insta?
Invite her to my crib, we gettin' nasty
