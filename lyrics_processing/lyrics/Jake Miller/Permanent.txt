Permanent

I think your friends know more about us than I do
I don't know what to say when my mom asks about you
I guess I'm confused, tell me the truth
Do we have a chance or are we through?
I think your friends know more about us than I do
I just need to know

Is permanent what we meant
When we said that we needed space?
How could you forget the time we spent?
How do you know when it's time to throw it all away?

I still drive by your house on my way home
I keep my eyes on the road, I don't wanna know
If there's somebody new there with you
Making you laugh just like I used to
I still drive by your house on my way home

Thought you were the one, baby
I was thinking wedding ring
But you won't even pick the damn phone up
I just think that we deserve closure
You're with your new man, I'm on my new girl
Drinkin' every night, tryin' not to think of you, girl
Can't tell if we helpin' it or hurtin' it
I just need to know if this is permanent
