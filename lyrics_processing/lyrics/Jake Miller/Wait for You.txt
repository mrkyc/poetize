Wait for you
Wait for you

You say your heart is too fragile
Maybe we should keep it casual, that's fine, that's fine (Wait)
He broke your heart into pieces
I know that you are still healing, that's fine, it's alright

I think you could use someone like me
But you ain't ready yet, you're scared to love again
I think you could use someone like me
It's killing me inside, but you can take your time

'Cause I'll wait for you
No matter how long I have to
Oh, I'll wait for you
And every night, I'm hurtin'
But I know you'll be worth it
So I'll wait

I will wait for you (I will wait for you)
I will wait for you (I will, I will)
I will wait for you (I will wait for you)
I will wait for you (I will, I will)
You might also like
I start to run out of patience
When I start picturing you naked, no lie, no lie
You're sleeping alone but I'm jealous
'Cause I got a space in my bed that's your size, your size

I think you could use someone like me
But you ain't ready yet, you're scared to love again
I think you could use someone like me
It's killing me inside, but you can take your time

'Cause I'll wait for you
No matter how long I have to
Oh, I'll wait for you
And every night, I'm hurtin'
But I know you'll be worth it
So I'll wait

I will wait for you (I will wait for you)
Yeah, I'll wait
I will wait for you (I will, I will)
As long as it takes
I will wait for you (I will wait for you)
I will wait for you (I will, I will)
Watch the seasons change, but you still can't make
Up your mind, how much time do I have to waste?
Always get that rush when my phone lights up
It's never you, I should just give you up, but

I'll wait for you
No matter how long I have to
Yeah, I'll wait for you
And every night, I'm hurtin'
But I know you'll be worth it
