Watch the way I come alive
When you are by my side
It happens every time
Got me wondering every night
How the fuck you're mine
I can't believe you're mine

I love the feeling when I'm kissing you in public
In a crowded room
I'm so proud of you, eh
I love the way my friends are jealous 'cause you're perfect
Want the world to see
You belong to me

I love showing you off, showing you off, showing you off
I love showing you off, showing you off, showing you off
'Cause you got what I want, got what I want, got what I want
So I love showing you off, showing you off, showing you off

Confident and beautiful
But you never try too hard
And that's my favorite part (That's why I love you)
Maybe I'm delusional
A perfect work of art
You shine just like the stars
You might also like
I love the feeling when I'm kissing you in public
In a crowded room
I'm so proud of you, eh
I love the way my friends are jealous 'cause you're perfect
Want the world to see
You belong to me

I love showing you off, showing you off, showing you off
I love showing you off, showing you off, showing you off
'Cause you got what I want, got what I want, got what I want
So I love showing you off, showing you off, showing you off

I don't need diamonds and gold
Just want your body to hold
I'll be right by your side
I'm here to help you shine
I don't need diamonds and gold
Just need your body to hold
I'll be right by your side
I'm here to help you shine

I love showing you off, showing you off, showing you off
I love showing you off, showing you off, showing you off
(Showing you off)
'Cause you got what I want, got what I want, got what I want
So I love showing you off, showing you off, showing you off, yeah
I don't need diamonds and gold
Just want your body to hold
I'll be right by your side (Your side)
I'm here to help you shine
I don't need diamonds and gold
Just need your body to hold
I'll be right by your side
