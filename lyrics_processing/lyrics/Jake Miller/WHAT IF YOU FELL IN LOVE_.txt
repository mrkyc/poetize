I had a dream, I had a dream you got engaged
Fell to my knees, I couldn't breathe, I was stuck in place
And I don't know what it means now, means now
But I'm scared to go to sleep now, sleep now
'Cause I had a dream, I had a dream you got engaged

And now I'm thinking, what if you fell in love?
What if it was too late to call you up?
'Cause I know you're happy you're with someone
What if you fell in, what if you fell in
Too deep with someone else?
Don't think I would ever forgive myself
'Cause I know that you'll always be the one
But what if you fell in, what if you fell in love?

Fell in love
Fell in love
Fell in love
What if you fell in, what if you fell in love?
Please don't fall in love
Please don't fall in
Please don't fall in love
What if you fell in, what if you fell in love?

I had a dream, was in the seats on your wedding day, yeah
I sat in the back wearing black, you never noticed me, oh no
I tried to scream and nothing came out
Just standing there with tears running down
'Cause I had a dream, was in the seats on your wedding day

And now I'm thinking, what if you fell in love? (In love)
What if it was too late to call you up? (You up)
'Cause I know you're happy you're with someone
What if you fell in, what if you fell in
Too deep with someone else? (Someone else)
Don't think I would ever forgive myself (Forgive myself)
'Cause I know that you'll always be the one
But what if you fell in, what if you fell in love?

Fell in love

What if you fell in, what if you fell in love?
