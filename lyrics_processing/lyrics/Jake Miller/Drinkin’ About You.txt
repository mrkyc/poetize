Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah
Drinkin' about you
Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah
Drinkin' about you

How you been, can we talk?
Yeah, I know that it's been awhile
And I said that I wouldn't call
But I keep layin' here in my bed
Thinkin' 'bout the times
We were up every night too long

So many words that I wish I had said
Is it too late for them now?
I've tried to move on, but I can't forget
I still see your face in the crowd

I've been drinkin' about you
I still can't let you go (Oh)
Can we talk like we used to?
Are you sleeping alone?
We had our reasons for calling it off
I can't remember them now
I can't see me without you
Maybe that's why I keep drinkin' about you

Drinkin' about you

Know you still got my shirt that I gave you to wear in bed
Do you smile when you put it on?
The more that I fight it, the more you get in my head
I don't know where we went so wrong

So many chances that we must have missed
Moments that we won't get back
It's not too late to forgive and forget
Don't let that night be our last

I've been drinkin' about you
I still can't let you go (Oh)
Can we talk like we used to?
Are you sleeping alone?
We had our reasons for calling it off
I can't remember them now
I can't see me without you
Maybe that's why I keep drinkin' about you
