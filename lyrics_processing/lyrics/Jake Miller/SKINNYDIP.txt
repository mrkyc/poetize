Life is complicated, everything is changing
We keep geting older, world is getting colder
I wish I could tell the younger us
That growing up is hard, so what's the rush?
'Cause everything was working, everything was perfect

When we were
Skinny dipping all night
Underneath the moonlight
Smoking in your mom's backyard
While everyone was sleeping
We were in the deep end
Feeling like the world was ours
And now, looking back, looking back
We never knew what we had, what we had
When we were
Skinny dipping all night
Underneath the moonlight
Smoking in your mom's backyard

Now we out in LA, everything just seems fake, yeah
It's nothing like the old days, all I feel is heartbreak
Yeah, I just wanna turn back time with you
Maybe we should pack our bags and move
'Cause, baby, this is tragic, we used to be magic
You might also like
When we were
Skinny dipping all night
Underneath the moonlight
Smoking in your mom's backyard
While everyone was sleeping
We were in the deep end
Feeling like the world was ours
And now, looking back, looking back
We never knew what we had, what we had
When we were
Skinny dipping all night
Underneath the moonlight
Smoking in your mom's backyard

Baby, this is tragic, we used to be magic
Baby, this is tragic, we used to be magic

Lay with me and let's make believe
That it's 2009 (2009)
And all we have is time (All we have is time)
Won't you lay with me and let's make believe
That it's 2009 (2009)
And everything is fine like back when we were
Skinny dipping all night
Underneath the moonlight
Smoking in your mom's backyard
While everyone was sleeping
We were in the deep end
Feeling like the world was ours
And now, looking back, looking back
We never knew what we had, what we had
When we were
Skinny dipping all night
Underneath the moonlight
Smoking in your mom's backyard

Baby, this is tragic, we used to be magic
