Started out as friends, only friends
But I knew from that moment (I knew from that moment)
That I was falling fast, falling fast
But you never noticed (You never noticed)

I lived right down the hall
Like a fly, on the wall
Knew you better than you knew yourself (Yourself)
Couldn't get you alone, so I'd sit by the phone
I, put myself through Hell
Could you even tell?

Thank God I waited
Thank God that I waited
'Cause my love never faded
I, just needed patience
It was always you
Yeah, it was always you
Oh yeah, yeah-yeah
Thank God I waited
Thank God that I waited
'Cause my love never faded
I, just needed patience
It was always you
Yeah, it was always you
Oh yeah, yeah-yeah

Remember when you slept at my place
We were kissin' and touchin' (Kissin' and touchin')
I thought you mind had changed
But you woke up and said it was nothin'
We're nothin'
