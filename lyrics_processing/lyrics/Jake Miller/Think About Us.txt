Don't know what to say
I keep calling her your name
Oh I, oh I...
Just saw all your friends
Now I'm missing you again
Oh I, oh I...
Yeah

Can't help but call you up when I'm wasted
I can recall what you look like naked
Gave me your love, it's hard to replace it now

'Cause even though I'm doing my best at moving on
I think about us sometimes
I think about us sometimes
I feel you're getting closer even though you're gone
I think about us sometimes
Do you think about us sometimes?
I think about us sometimes
I think about us

You might be surprised
Just how much I fantasize
Oh I, oh I...
You might be my ex
But you just might be my next
Oh I, oh I...
Yeah
You might also like

Everywhere I go, I swear
I keep seeing your face
And my heart still breaks a little
Every time I hear your name
Everywhere I go, I swear
I keep seeing your face
And my heart still breaks a little
Every time I hear your name

Even though you're gone (Even though you're gone)

Everywhere I go, I swear
I keep seeing your face
