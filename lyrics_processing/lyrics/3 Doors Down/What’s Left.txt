A few pictures, two tickets, from a trip we took last year
A handful of memories, some still seem clear
A few regrets, a couple of melodies, that remind me of you
I could say that I won't miss this, but that wouldn't be the truth
There's no one here to blame, and this is the only way
There's nothing left for us, to say

It's time to let you go, it's what we have to do
It's time to give this up, I think that we both knew
There's nothing left to say, there's nothing left to prove
And now it's time to turn and walk away from
What's left of me and you
What's left of me and you

Box of letters, that old t-shirt, still brings me back to you
A few more hours in the day, not sure what I should do
There's no one here to blame, and this is the only way
There's nothing left for us to say

It's time to let you go, it's what we have to do
It's time to give this up, I think that we both knew
There's nothing left to say, there's nothing left to prove
And now it's time to turn and walk away from
What's left of me and you
What's left of me and you
You might also like
You were the best thing I'll ever give up
And it's hard to see the truth
When you think you're still in love
The only way to get on with my life
Is to say goodbye, so goodbye

It's time to let you go, it's what we have to do
It's time to give this up, I think that we both knew
There's nothing left to say, there's nothing left to prove
And now it's time to turn and walk away from
What's left of me and you
What's left of me and you
