Said you wanted to feel beautiful
And did I ever tell you differently?
I tried to give you all that you deserved
And never mind the things you said to me
Along the way I didn't say all the things I felt inside myself
You took away all that I thought was mine
And then you gave it all to someone else

You said you only wanted love
But love wasn't enough
So soon enough you said goodbye
But goodbye only reminded me
Of all that I can see
And I can see your love was a lie

Everybody told me I was crazy
But you told me to believe your lies
Guess I was hoping that your love might save me
But I think I died a thousand times
I never knew this side of you
The side that I wish I had never seen
Soon enough I guess I would discover I had a lover that could be so mean

You said you only wanted love
But love wasn't enough
So soon enough you said goodbye
But goodbye only reminded me
Of all that I can see
And I can see your love was a lie
You said you only wanted love
But love wasn't enough
So soon enough you said goodbye
But goodbye only reminded me
Of all that I can see
And I can see your love was a lie

Said you wanted to feel beautiful
And did I ever tell you differently?
I tried to give you all that you deserved
Never mind the things you said

You said you only wanted love
But love wasn't enough
So soon enough you said goodbye
But goodbye only reminded me
Of all that I can see
And I can see your love was a lie
You said you only wanted love
But love wasn't enough
So soon enough you said goodbye
But goodbye only reminded me
Of all that I can see
