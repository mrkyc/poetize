There's a difference in spending time with me
And killing time while I'm there
On too many people and too many things
And it makes me feel like hell
You have gone as I can see
And all of this she says to me

There's too many questions
And too many strings
And they won't keep their self tied
On a roller coaster ride
It feels like I'm lying next to a ghost at night
I don't know why I gave you my heart
Cause sometimes it feels so wrong
But despite of all this weather
I know why we are together
And I swear right now
I'm right where I belong

I know I get a little bit crazy
But I never done you no wrong
Well I get distracted and carried away
And it's been this way too long
But I don't know what you need from me
Cause all I know is what I can see
You might also like
There's too many questions
And too many strings
And they won't keep their self tied
On a roller coaster ride
It feels like I'm lying next to a ghost at night
I don't know why I gave you my heart
Cause sometimes it feels so wrong
But despite of all this weather
I know why we are together
And I swear right now
I'm right where I belong

I'm right where I belong
Go on, Play it for me Son


There's too many questions
And too many strings
And they won't keep their self tied
On a roller coaster ride
It feels like I'm lying next to a ghost at night
I don't know why I gave you my heart
Cause sometimes it feels so wrong
But despite of all this weather
I know why we are together
And I swear right now
