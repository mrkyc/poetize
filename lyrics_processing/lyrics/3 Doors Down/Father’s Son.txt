In the glare of a neon sign
She laid her body down
The damned walked in beside her
And he laid his money down
He said don't try to scream now
But I want this one to hurt
And tonight, my pretty one
I'm gonna get my money's worth
He said they never listen
She said they'd never understand
That I don't this for pleasure
I just do it cause I can
I swear I didn't want to
And I swear I didn't know
That things like this could happen
To a 17-year old

And I've bundled up all of these fears inside
And I've bottled up all of this pain
And no one or nothing can take this away
But I won't let it happen again
Never again

In the haze of a smoky room
He chokes that bottle down
It's been a month since her saw her face
Underneath the blood stained gown
He thinks about that little girl
And the one he has at home
And wonders, "What if that was my little girl
Walking down that road alone?"
You might also like
And I've bundled up all of these fears inside
And I've bottled up all of this pain
And no one or nothing can take this away
But I won't let it happen again
Never again

Maybe I'm just crazy or the devil got inside
But either way my soul is gone, And I'll end this all tonight
The one hand throws the whiskey, and the other throws the gun
As he cries out to the heavens, "I am not my father's son"

And I've bundled up all of these fears inside
And I've bottled up all of this pain
And no one or nothing can take this away
But I won't let it happen again
