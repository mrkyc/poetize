Straw hats out in the sticks

It's a little bit of country with a hip hop twist
I'm not John and Kenny but I'm Big & Rich
So if ya really feel like I I feel
In your belly shirt and your high heels
You can treat it like a stack of hay
You can bail with me
We can take it to the crib or the hotel with me
Girls go crazy when they play my song
So where them Tequlia shots and them Jager bombs
And a cold Coors Light is what I'm drinkin on
And taking her home is what I'm bankin on
Might even drink Patrone till I sing off key
Matter fact tell the party next rounds on me

Everybody's in the spot gettin drunk tonight
And we just came here to party we ain't startin no fights
I like them stelletos and how she fit in them jeans
The only thing that'd make it better would be me in between
She hollerin YEE HAW
Body rockin like a see saw
Let me see ya two step drop it like a free fall
Watch as she leans ya'll
Tell her back that ass up
Shawty bring the party from the club to the mack truck
Finally got my money now finally got my cash up
Country girls stay fit face down ass up
That's what's up
You see this cowboy hat with these Evezoo jeans
You know we rock it like that
It's a little bit of country with a hip hop twist

I said I think it's about time to bring the chickens to the floor
The chickens to the floor

Cause all the bad girls make the rooster crow
The rooster crow
