I came from a gangster from the Westside
The real Westside
He said to watch your back lil' man
Cause its killers and dealers and cut throats outside
I said i know thats right
In the city where i from
In the city where i came up
In Mary's kitchen
I swear them ramen noodles made us, and them belts couldn't break us, and them cold city nights couldn't shake us
Man them police chased us, man them OG's shaped us,
And them pretty hoes hated us
...i wonder why
You talkin' too much
AYE BITCH DONT KILL MY VIBE
I swear it feel like it get colder as i get older
My grandmama worry
So i told her "even though im always out all night
Dont you worry. im gon' be alright"

Just a little just a little bit
Just a little bit closer to you
Just a little bit closer to you
Just a little just a little bit
Just a little just a little bit
Just a little bit closer to you
Can you bring me just a little bit closer to you
You might also like
I came from the Southside
Where we're raised to kill for our pride
And the children are animals
And a Lamborghini is the only mercy we understand
With a bird in they hand
MURDER in they hand
Do you understand how a boy can kill a man
How Cain killed Abel
And thank GOD for the bread on the table
Watching basic cable
The 6 o'clock news
The 6 o'clock blues
Monotone murder reports
And it ain't no tears cause we done heard it before
Police at the door
They took my best friend's brother
Now he all alone with his mother
ELEVEN YEARS OLD and he the man of the house
We used to wanna be grown
I can't stand it now

Just a little just a little bit
Just a little bit closer to you
Can you bring me just a little bit closer to you
Just a little just a little bit
Just a little bit closer to you
Can you bring me just a little bit closer to you
I come from the North East
From a good household
Boy you know we gon' eat
They say Columbus do it best
Im exhibit A
I put that rhythm to the test
You know i gets that grade A
BTE
That's what i spit for
I'll run over, around, and through you like some parkour
Quadruple up like its part four of this world tour
All this weight im pulling
It would make a bear sore
Fuck all them wolf tickets
Hear my roar
I bring that lightning and thunder
Forget Thor
Come fuck with me
I give you swag galore
Here go the entrance of a reign
That will last forevermore

Just a little just a little bit
Just a little bit closer to you
Just a little bit closer to you
Just a little just a little bit
Just a little just a little bit
Just a little bit closer to you
