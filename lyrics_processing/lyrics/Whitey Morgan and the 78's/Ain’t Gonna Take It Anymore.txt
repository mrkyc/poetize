She walked in mean and drunk about a quarter to four
Yeah, she threw down that ring
As she stumbled in through the door
I said, "Girl what is it you're trying to do to me?
I've been workin' like a dog every damn day this week"
Well she said,
"I'm gettin' a lil' tired of you and your runnin' aroun'
I've been diggin' through your phone, boy
And there's a few things I found"
Well, I didn't wait to hear a single word she read, no
I just ran out of that house
Grabbed a bottle of wine, and I said

"If I'm goin' down tonight, I'm goin' down drinkin'
You spend too much time in this ol' house sittin' and thinkin'
You've been a thorn in my side
Since I walked through the door
And this ol' boy ain't gonna take any more
If I'm goin' down tonight, I'm goin' down drinkin'"
That's right


Well I pulled up a stool at the nearest bar I could find
When in walked this chick, damn near struck me blind
And I said, "Girl what is it you're trying to do to me?"
That's when I noticed her husband
Lookin' drunk, crazy and mean
Well he said, "I'm gettin' a lil' tired of you
Starin' my girl up and down
While your suckin' down beers on that stool
Like some drunkin' clown"
Well, I started drinkin' and thinkin'
I should'a stayed home instead, yeah
I grabbed a six-pack to go, ran out of that bar, and I said

Well you've been a thorn in my side
Since I walked through this door
And this Ol' boy ain't gonna take any more
If I'm goin' down tonight, I'm goin' down drinkin'
Well If I'm goin' down tonight
You know I'm goin' down drinkin'
