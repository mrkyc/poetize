Another town, another show and another empty bottle in this motel room
One more promise has been broken to one more lonely woman
Lord I'm ready to go
When morning comes I'm leaving again
Like a tumbleweed I'm gone with the wind
There ain't no use to try and explain
Girl I ain't ever gonna change

Baby I was born a sinner
I was born a ramblin man
Mama tried but she didn't try hard enough
My old man never did give a damn
Turn me loose, watch me go
Just one night and I'm back on the road
Baby there ain't no cure for my disease
C'mon girl you gotta set me free

This old life I've been living
It ain't the life for everyone
But it's the life for me
So bolt the door, turn down the lights
Honey everything's gonna be alright
Why don't ya stick around and see
When morning comes I'm leaving again
Like a tumbleweed I'm gone with the wind
There ain't no use to try and explain
Girl I ain't ever gonna change
