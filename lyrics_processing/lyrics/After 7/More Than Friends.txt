It was about 11:30
You hit up my phone
You sounded all worried
Wondering if I was home, home, home
I knew there was something
Ooh, I know it is something wrong
He had you all messed up
He didn't even call call call
Said you need a little space
Girl, you need to clear
Girl, you need to clear your mind
Girl, you're headed to my place
And I met you right outside

Soon as I opened up the door
I knew I'd seen that look before
'Cause, girl, you know that I've been reading your mind

So if you really really wanna go there tonight
We can cross that line
We're 'bout to be more than friends
We're 'bout to be more than friends
You and I can kiss that friend zone goodbye
We can cross that line
We're 'bout to be more than friends
We're 'bout to be more than friends
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout
You know how it's going down
More than friends
We got to be more than friends

So now you're framed on my body
Is it just for tonight?
I don't share with nobody
You gonna have to be mine, mine, mine
Said you need a little space
Girl, you need to clear
Girl, you need to clear your mind
Tell me why you at my place?
'Cause it's gonna be your last time

Soon as I opened up the door
I knew I'd seen that look before
And you know that I've been reading your mind

So if you really really wanna go there tonight
We can cross that line
Said we're 'bout to be more than friends
We're 'bout to be more than friends
You and I can kiss that friend zone goodbye
We can cross that line
Said we're 'bout to be more than friends
We're 'bout to be more than friends
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout
You know how it's going down
More than friends
We got to be more than friends
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout
You know how it's going down
More than friends
We're 'bout to be more than friends
Never before have I wanted more
And I hope you know
Tonight, I'm gonna get it
I told you before don't you play with my mind
If you wanna stay, then we're crossing the line
We gotta be more (More than friends)
We gotta be more (More than friends)
I told you before don't you play with my mind
If you wanna stay, then we're crossing the line
We gotta be more (More than friends)
We gotta be more (More than friends)

So if you really really wanna go there tonight
We can cross that line

More than friends
We got to be more than friends
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout
