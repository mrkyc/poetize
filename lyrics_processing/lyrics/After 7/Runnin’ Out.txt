(The day I fell in)
The day I fell in love with you
(Was a day that I knew my)
The day I knew my life began
(The day that I break up)
And the day that I break up with you
(Will be the day that I know my)
Will be the day I know my life will end

You and I belong together
It gets hard, but yes it gets better
I'm not gon' give up on you
So don't you dare give up on me
Girl, please tell me how

I know that this ain't how our story ends
(This ain't how it ends, no)
I know that we ain't runnin' out of love
(We're not runnin' out of love)
And if you think it girl, you gotta think again
(You gotta, you gotta think again, baby)
'Cause baby we ain't even close to done
We're not out of love

They say that we ain't got no chance
(They say that you need to)
They say you need to leave your man

Well, ain't no way that's happening

Ooh girl, you and I belong together
It gets hard, but yes it gets better
I'm not gon' give up on you
So don't you dare give up on me
Girl, please tell me how

I know that this ain't how our story ends
(How...how it ends)
I know that we ain't runnin' out of love

And if you think it girl, you gotta think again
(You gotta, you gotta think again, baby)
