There was a time when
You would've died if
I told you the truth but I couldn't find the words to say

I tried to lessen your hurt
And that's the lesson I've learned
And I'm so afraid that it's too late, too late

And now I think it's too late to rewind
Too late to worry
Now I think it's too late to rewind
Too late for "I'm sorry"
And now I think it's too late to rewind
Too late to worry
Now I think it's too late to rewind
Too late for "I'm sorry"

So if you do happen to love me still
I promise I'll keep it real
With you from this point on, and on and on
I know I've wasted too much time
Trying to find if the sun shines
Brighter, on the other side
So tired, but I can't hide no more, no more
You might also like
And that's the lesson I've learned
And I'm so afraid that it's too late, too late, baby

And now I think it's too late to rewind
Too late to worry
Now I think it's too late to rewind
Too late for "I'm sorry"
And now I think it's too late to rewind
Too late to worry
Now I think it's too late to rewind
Too late for "I'm sorry"

Sometimes I wanted to cry (Cry), and I wanted to die (Die)
In the end I could see that you only wanted me to tell the truth
But I failed, and I know, I can't tell if you'll go
Or if you'll stay with me
We'll be okay, my sweet lady

And now I think it's too late to rewind
Too late to worry
Now I think it's too late to rewind
Too late for "I'm sorry"
And now I think it's too late to rewind
Too late to worry
Now I think it's too late to rewind
Too late for "I'm sorry"
And now I think it's too late to rewind
Too late to worry
Now I think it's too late to rewind
Too late for "I'm sorry"
And now I think it's too late to rewind
Too late to worry
Now I think it's too late to rewind
Too late for "I'm sorry"
Too late, too late
Too late, too late
Too late, it's too late
Too late, it's too late
Too late, it's too late
Too late, it's too late
Too late, it's too late
