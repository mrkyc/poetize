I've got so much I want to say
I've got so much I wanna do
There never seems to be enough
Time to be with you
So if in the moments in your arms
And when the moment's here and gone
I'll be missing you
It's not fair when the morning comes
And the night must to fade
Ooh, I can't wait to hold you again
Cause there's just

Not enough hours in the night to hold you
Not enough hours in your arms
To show you the love I feel inside
There's just not enough time to love you
Not enough
Not enough

I wanna hold you in my arms
I wanna look into your eyes
I want to spend the rest of time
Making love to you
You might also likeOh baby
I loved you so much
No time would ever be enough
To be close to you
It's not right when the moonlight fade
And the kisses end
Oh, I can't wait to kiss you again
Yeah

Not enough hours in the night to hold you
Not enough hours in your arms
To show you the love I feel inside
There's just not enough time
Not enough minutes in the day
Not enough to tell you that I love you
Not enough time
To do the things
Things I wanna do, yeah
Not enough hours in the night to love

If I can stop the clock
Every kiss would last forever
If I can spend forever here by your side
Still wouldn't be enough time
For you and I
No
Not enough hours
In the night to hold you
Not enough hours in your arms
I wanna show you, baby
The way I feel inside
There's just not enough time
Not enough minutes in the day
Not enough time
To do the things
Things I do
Yeah
Not enough hours in the night
Not enough
Kisses in the moon light
Not enough hours in the night
Not enough
Not enough
Feel with me, baby
Not enough
Not enough
Oh, I'll be running through the time
Hey, you know you're mine
You're mine, you're mine
