I'm having fun, but all that I've done
It hasn't always been right
They say I misuse, that I break the rules
But that won't get me uptight
Now they're telling me what I could never be
Always tryin' to bring me down (Bring me down)
But I'm so strong, I'll prove them wrong
No matter what they say, I'm telling you right now

Don't you think it bothers me
If you think it bothers me
It will never bother me, oh no
So don't you think it bothers me
'Cause if you think it bothers me
It will never bother me, oh no

Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, no

I've been around, been up and down
This roller coaster of life
Now people see what all I've achieved
But there are some who still try
To criticize, I don't know why
But I think that it's jealousy (Jealous, so jealous)
But I was strong and proved them wrong
'Cause nothing in the world will ever bother me
You might also like
Don't you think it bothers me
If you think it bothers me
It will never bother me, oh no (No, no, no, no)
So don't you think it bothers me
'Cause if you think it bothers me
It will never bother me, oh no (Woo)

Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, no
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, no

Don't you think it bothers me
If you think it bothers me
It will never bother me
Don't you think it bothers me
If you think it bothers me
It will never bother me (It won't bother me)

Times are hard but I've gotta make it
Tried to bring me down but I had to take it
The road is rough and I'm here to tell ya
I've had enough, not givin' up
I never believe the things they say about me
Nothing in life is ever gonna stop me
Jealousy, envy, don't wanna make an enemy
Keep on keepin' on to the top
No, no, no, no-no-no, no, no, (No, no), no, no (No, no)
No, no, no, no-no-no, no, no, (No, no), no, no (No, no)
It won't bother
Don't you think it bothers me (Just won't bother)
If you think it bothers me
It will never bother me, oh no
(It will never, never, never bother, never bother me, no, never will)
Don't you think it bothers me (It never will)
If you think it bothers me (It never bothers)
It will never bother me
(Bother, never, never, never, never bother me)
Oh-oh (It never will)
Oh-oh (It never will)
Oh-oh (But baby)
