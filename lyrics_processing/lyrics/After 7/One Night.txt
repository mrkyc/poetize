You've got that look in your eyes
And I've got plans for two
Though you're the kinda girl
Who likes to take her time with love
I'd gladly wait forever for you
But in the middle of the night
I know something ain't right
We've got something special, girl
Let's give it a try

One night of touchin', one night, one night, girl
Two nights of trust
Three nights of huggin'
Makes one night of love, ooh, ooh, ooh
One night of touchin', one night, one night, girl
Two nights of trust
Three nights of huggin', I'm going to wait, if that's what it takes
Makes one night of love, for one night

You've got that love in your heart
And I've got love for you
But I'm the kinda guy, who likes to get right to the point
I wanna give my lovin' to you
So in the middle of the night
When I'm holdin' you tight
I'll show you how precious lovers love thru the night
