I have been on every type of aeroplane that's touched the sky
I've seen the world a million times before
I've taken trips on a whim, went to paradise and back again
Had everything a man could ask for

I've been to Italy, drinking wine alone
I've even seen the views from the Great China Wall
But these experiences, they all seem dull
'Cause there's something missing in every place that I go

How the hell was I supposed to know
That when they said there ain't no place like home
They meant you, babe
And when I'm in my own bed
If you ain't there, it still feels wrong
Found out the hard way
Even if we're in a hotel room, I know the truth
They say ain't no place like home
But really, there's no place like you

Built a house brick by brick
Put all of the nicest furniture inside of it, oh-ho
Walk on marble floors (Floors)
Walk through custom doors (Doors)
Feng shui like a sensei, I must admit
You might also like
The kind of design you would only find in Rome
With a welcome mat at the front door
You would think it's the house of my dreams
But what good is building a castle if you have no queen?

How the hell was I supposed to know
That when they said there ain't no place like home
They meant you, babe
And when I'm in my own bed
If you ain't there, it still feels wrong
Found out the hard way
Even if we're in a hotel room
I know the truth
They say ain't no place like home
But really, there's no place like you

You don't know how important you are to me, babe
A million-dollar mansion (Mansion)
Two grand per square (Oh)
Still raggedy (Still raggedy) if you are not there

How the hell was I supposed to know
That when they said there ain't no place like home
They meant you, babe
And when I'm in my own bed
If you ain't there, it still feels wrong
Found out the hard way
Even if we're in a hotel room, I know the truth
They say ain't no place like home
