All was right, we were one
You were my everything, so in love
Now I've learned that you weren't there
How could I be so blind for you

Well, I've seen it in your face, that you were on a date
Girl, I should've known, you started comin' in so late
Someone else had said that I've been misled
'Til the day our kid found you in someone else's bed

Sayonara
I won't be bothered
And I never want to see your face no more
Sayonara (So long)
I won't be bothered (Bye-bye)
And I never want to see your face no more
(No, no, no, oh no, no, no, no)

All I know is you were wrong
But still I could forgive, I stayed strong
'Til one day, he came by
And said our family was all a lie
You might also like
Well, I couldn't believe my ears
What he was tellin' me
So I went to call my doctor
'Cause I just had to see
Well, he really rocked my world
You know good and well he did
'Cause you knew all the time
That you had someone else's kid

Sayonara
I won't be bothered (Oh no)
And I never want to see your face no more
Sayonara (Oh)
I won't be bothered (Oh, oh)
And I never want to see your face no more
(I never, I never, I never, ever, I never wanna see your face)
Sayonara (So long)
I won't be bothered (Bye-bye)
And I never want to see your face no more
(Never, ever, ever, never)
Sayonara (So long)
I won't be bothered (I won't be bothered, girl)
And I never want to see your face no more
(No, no, no, oh no, no, no, no)
Oh, oh, oh, girl; girl, I've had it
You could have had the decency
To tell the child and not just me
Oh, oh, oh, girl; girl, forget it
Girl, I'm walking out that door
And you can't come this way no more, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Yeah, no-no-no-no, no-no-no-no, no-no-no-no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Yeah

Sayonara (Oh)
I won't be bothered (Oh-oh)
And I never want to see your face no more
Sayonara (Oh)
I won't be bothered (Oh-oh)
And I never want to see your face no more
Sayonara (Oh) (So long)
I won't be bothered (Oh-oh) (Bye-bye)
And I never want to see your face no more
Sayonara (Oh) (So long)
I won't be bothered (Oh-oh) (Bye-bye)
And I never want to see your face no more
Sayonara (Oh) (So long)
I won't be bothered (Oh-oh) (Bye-bye)
And I never want to see your face no more
Sayonara (Oh) (So long)
I won't be bothered (Oh-oh) (Bye-bye)
And I never want to see your face no more
Sayonara (Oh) (So long)
I won't be bothered (Oh-oh) (Bye-bye)
