I didn't even know, that I was in love
I didn't ever trust it was written in the stars above
Baby, I adore you, and I couldn't love you any more
You were everything I didn't even know that I was waiting for

'Cause I can feel you in my heart
And I can feel you in my soul
Got a feeling from the very start
I'm never gonna let you go, girl
'Cause I've been

I've been loving you all my life
I've been loving you all my life
And I wanna know if you could ever feel this way
Do you feel that way about me? (Yeah)
'Cause I know you, and you know me
And we know love, it is our destiny
I've been loving you all my life
Do you feel that way about me? (Yeah, yeah)
(Oh baby)

We didn't even know that we was love
We didn't have a voice
But you can hear it in the skies above
But baby I won't, and I couldn't want you any more
You were everything I didn't even know that I was wanting for
You might also like
'Cause I can feel you in my heart
And I can feel you deep in my soul
Got a feeling from the very start
I'm never gonna let you go, girl
'Cause I've been

I've been loving you all my life
I've been loving you all my life
And I wanna know if you could ever feel this way
Do you feel that way about me?
(Yeah)
'Cause I know you, and you know me
And we know love, it is our destiny
I've been loving you all my life
Do you feel that way about me? (Yeah, yeah, oh)

All my, all my (All my life), all my, all my
All my, all my (All my life), all my, all my life
Baby, baby, baby, baby girl
