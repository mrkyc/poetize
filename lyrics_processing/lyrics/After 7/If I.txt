When I was in love with you
You were so good to me
But I wasn't loving you
The way I knew I should be
And now that you're gone
Ain't nothing been the same
Not since you've been away
Now that you're gone
I just can't get it together
Life with you is so much better
And I'm missing you, like, every day
Oh

Baby, if I could turn back the hands of time
To the days when you were mine
If I just had the chance
I would so be a better man
Baby, if I woulda treated you more right
You would still be by my side
If I just had the chance
To go back in time, and take what is mine
And get back my life again
Yeah, get back my life
You might also like
When I was in love with you
I never gave all my heart
And you said that loving you
Means you give every part
And now that you're gone
And I feel so ashamed that I let you walk away
Now that you're gone
I just can't get it together
Life with you is so much better
And I'm missing you, like, every day
Oh

Baby, if I could turn back the hands of time
To the days when you were mine
If I just had the chance
I would so be a better man
Baby, if I woulda treated you more right
You would still be by my side
If I just had the chance
To go back in time, and take what is mine
And get back my life again
Yeah, get back my life

Oh, baby
It's not complicated (No)
Ain't nothing new (Nothing new, girl)
I just can't see me, girl, ever getting over you
(Now that you're gone) Now that you're gone, girl
(I'm here all alone) Here all alone
And it ain't get no better, 'til we get together
I need for you to come back home
Baby, if I could turn back the hands of time
(If I could turn back the hands of time)
To the days when you were mine
(To the days when you were mine)
If I just had the chance
(If I just had the chance)
I would so be a better man (Oh)
Baby, if I woulda treated you more right
You would still be right by my side
If I just had the chance (Had the chance to)
To go back in time, and take what is mine

If I could be with you (If I could be with you)
Ain't nothing I wouldn't do
(Ain't nothing I wouldn't do)
If I only had the chance (If I just had the chance)
I'd be such a better man (I would so be a better man)
(Baby, if I...) If I could be your man
(If I could be your man) I'd do anything
Anything for a chance, baby
(If I just had the chance, had the chance to)
To go back in time, and take what is mine
And get back my life again
