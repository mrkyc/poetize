And I can't stop
Can't stop
How I feel
I'm digging on you
You digging on me
We digging on we girl
And I can't stop
Can't stop
How I feel
I'm digging on you
You digging on me
We digging on we
(Verse 1)
Last night, I had the time of my life
It's true
Oh, last night, I made love for the very first time
With you
I never knew love could be so sweet
It never made a difference to me, well well
But ever since the day that you appeared
I'm telling you, you've made the difference now love is so clear
(Chorus)
And I can't stop
Can't stop
How I feel
I'm digging on you
You digging on me
We digging on we girl
You might also likeAnd oh, I can't stop
Can't stop
How I feel
I'm digging on you
You digging on me
(Verse 2)
Last night, you bought something special
Out of me, ooh wee
And for the first time, girl
You made my dream a reality, indeed
I never thought love was meant for me
I was blind and could not see, well well
You bought about a love that's so sincere
And I'm telling you, you've made the difference now love is so sincere
And I can't stop
Can't stop
How I feel
I'm digging on you
You digging on me
We digging on we girl
And I can't stop
Can't stop
How I feel
I'm digging on you
You digging on me
(Verse 3)
You've got me thinking that I need protection
Because your love is so strong, I don't want to do wrong
Girl, your love seems like it's true perfection
You just give me a call and I'll give you my all

I'm digging on you
You digging on me
We're digging on we, girl

(Chorus)
I Can't stop
How I feel
I Can't stop
How I feel can't stop the way that I feel
I'm digging on you
You digging on me I can't stop it baby
You know I can't stop
Can't stop
How I feel
I'm digging on you
You digging on me
