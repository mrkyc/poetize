It's true
Oh, last night, I made love for the very first time
With you
I never knew love could be so sweet
It never made a difference to me, well well
But ever since the day that you appeared
I'm telling you, you've made the difference now love is so clear
And I can't stop
(Can't stop)
How I feel
I'm diggin' on you
You diggin' on me
We diggin' on we
And oh, I can't stop
(Can't stop)
How I feel
I'm diggin' on you
You diggin' on me
Last night, you bought something special
Out of me, ooh wee
And for the first time, girl
You made my dream a reality, indeed
I never thought love was meant for me
I was blind and could not see, well well
You bought about a love that's so sincere
And I'm telling you, you've made the difference now love is so sincere
And I can't stop
(Can't stop)
How I feel
I'm diggin' on you
You diggin' on me
We diggin' on we
And I can't stop
(Can't stop)
How I feel
I'm diggin' on you
You diggin' on me, ooh girl
I can't stop
I'm diggin' on you
You diggin' on me
We diggin' on we, girl
I can't stop
I'm diggin' on you
You diggin' on me
You've got me thinking that I need protection
'Cause your love is so strong, I don't wanna do wrong
Girl, your love seems like it's true protection
You just give me a call and I'll give you my all
Can't stop
(Can't stop)
How I feel
I'm diggin' on you
You diggin' on me
We diggin' on we, girl
Can't stop
(Can't stop)
How I feel
I'm diggin' on you
You diggin' on me
You know I can't stop
(Can't stop)
How I feel
I'm diggin' on you
You diggin' on me
We diggin' on we, girl
Oh, I can't stop
(Can't stop)
How I feel
I'm diggin' on you
You diggin' on me
Can't stop
(Can't stop)
I'm diggin' on you
You diggin' on me
We diggin' on we, girl
Can't stop
(Can't stop)
I'm diggin' on you
