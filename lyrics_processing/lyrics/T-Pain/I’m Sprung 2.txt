Ooh
She got you doin, what you won't do
Now you're sprung and I told you
S-P-R-U-N-G
Now you see (Now you see)

I'm sprung
Dog she got me!
Got me doin things I'll never do
If you ain't been, I'm tellin you
You do

It's somethin bout'cha
That's got me doin things I said I'd never do (never do)
And I can say I'm amazed
The way you put it on me, how you got me chasin you (chasin you)
And I could care less, I could give a damn
Cause see you my ride or die
You're a down ass bitch who don't take no shit
Keep it real though and still look fly

Real talk I'ma tell you out the whip
It ain't yo' face and it ain't yo' hips
It's how you roll my weed and lick dem lips
And, when I dip shawty you don't even trip
You give me rubberbands for my grip
You the fly bitch steppin up out my whip
I'm your nigga girl we like "This done"
And when the hook say you got me like dat dere I'm sprung
See T-Pain LiveGet tickets as low as $59You might also like
Oooh she got me doin the dishes
Anything she want for some kisses
I'm cookin for her when she gets hungry
All she do is actin like she want me
She cuttin off all my homies
Even all my other 'ronies
She ain't even my main lady
See I been thinkin 'bout it lately
Man! She really don't deserve me
All she wanna do is hurt me
So I gotta get away from her...
But now I'm leavin quickly
Before she come and try to get me
And I'm takin everythang with me
When it all come down to her

I'm sprung
Dog she got me!
Got me doin things I'll never do
If you ain't been, I'm tellin you
I'm sprung.. (I'm sprung)
Dog she got me!
Got me doin things I'll never do
If you ain't been, I'm tellin you
I ain't never been a sucker for love
Never even had a girlfriend 'til I started fuckin with her
Ain't never even knocked her down
And she hooked on awards tryin to lock me down
With one flick of the tongue I was sprung
And we didn't get done 'til fo' or five in the mornin
She had me deep in the zone (Deep in the zone)
You get a brand new wardrobe but baby you ain't goin home
The new Jag and all the Louis bags
Chanel and Excata straight from Belle Harbor
I told my homeboys I'll holla
I got plans for a date, my girl want steaks
And she prefer Benihana's (Benihana's)
We can go from Monday to Sunday, don't even matter 'bout the money
I'm stuck on her, never shoulda let her suck on it
Shoulda hit her up and sent her home the next mornin

I'm sprung
Dog she got me!
Got me doin things I'll never do
If you ain't been, I'm tellin you
I'm sprung.. (I'm sprung)
Dog she got me!
Got me doin things I'll never do
If you ain't been, I'm tellin you
You do (You do)
You do (You do)
You do (You do)
You do (You do)
You do (Do do do)
You do (Do do do do do)
You do (Do do do do do do do do)

So we went our separate ways
It's been a couple of days
But now I'm doin' what I want to
With nobody tellin' me what I'm gon' do
And I'm feelin' so free
With nobody but me
Now I can handle all my business
All of my fellas, can I get a witness?
But I'm feelin' kinda lonely
On top of that I'm kinda horny
And I gotta get back to her
Now I'm leavin' quickly
Before she come and try to get me
And I'm takin' everything with me
Well it all come down to her

I'm sprung
Dog she got me!
Got me doin things I'll never do
If you ain't been, I'm tellin you
I'm sprung.. (I'm sprung)
Dog she got me!
Got me doin things I'll never do
If you ain't been, I'm tellin you

You do (Do do do)
You do (do do do do do)
