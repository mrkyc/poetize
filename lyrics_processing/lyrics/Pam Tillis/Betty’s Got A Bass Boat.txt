Never wanted very much out of this world
Just an occasional dinner and twirl
From a regular guy
So Betty sat up one lonely night
Trying to figure out what a man might like
Then like a bolt right out of the blue
She got herself a plan
Betty's got a bass boat
Betty's got a truck
All of a sudden things are looking up
She's the most popular girl in town
Since she got a new camper and a huntin' hound
Might be coincidental
Oh you just might never know
Oh, but things sure got a lot better since Betty got a bass boat
Now lately getting a date isn't all that hard
There's a half a dozen bubba's fightin' in the yard
She won 'em over with her southern charm
And a satellite dish
Now Betty can't believe her popularity
She's thinkin 'bout marketing her recipe
So ironic and the funny thing is
She never even liked to fish

Oh you just might never know
Oh, but things sure got a lot better since Betty got a bass boat
She's got bowling shoes
She can't lose
She's got those boys just blowin' their fuse
She's got a big screen
She's in the in scene
They're even gonna make her strawberry queen
Betty's got a bass boat
Betty's got a truck
All of a sudden things are looking up
She's the most popular girl in town

Ooooh
Things sure got a lot better since Betty got a bass boat
Hey look at Betty
Look at her go
Bye bye
