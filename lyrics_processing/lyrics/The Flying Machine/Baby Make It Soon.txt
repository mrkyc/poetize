And the place you're staying now, ain't too far away
Can you write tonight, just to let me know
'Cause since you've been away girl, I've missed you so
You won't let me down
'Cause I'm sure you're homeward bound
And you'll be back safe and sound
'Cause I just know
Baby make it soon, make it soon
I can't wait another day
(Baby make it soon, make it soon)
Lord I know I need you, come on
Baby make it soon, make it soon
Can't you make it right away
(Baby make it soon, make it soon)
Lord I know I need you
Right back here, here in my arms
If you're comin' home, like you promised to
Can you write tonight and tell me, what you're gonna do
'Cause I'm lonely now, and I'm gonna stay that way
Until I hold you, in my arms again
