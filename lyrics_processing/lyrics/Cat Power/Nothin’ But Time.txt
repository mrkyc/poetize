I see you, kid, alone in your room
You got the weight on your mind
And you're just trying to get by
Your world is just beginning
And I know this life seems never-ending
But you got nothing but time
And it ain't got nothing on you
You know what you got to do
You ain't got nothing but time
And it ain't got nothing on you

Let 'em in one by one
Keep 'em safe from all the harm
Let 'em in one by one
Keep 'em safe
And give them a hand

They wanna live, you wanna be somebody
They want to give and be wanted
And want to forgive and not be forgotten
They want to reach the end
You want to live
Their way of living
Their way of living

It's up to you, it's up to you, you know?

To live your way of living
And it ain't got nothing on you
