It's my way
It's my way
It's my way
It's my way, it's my way down
It's my way down
It's my way down

I never knew love like this
The wind, the moon, the earth, the sky (Sky so high)
I never knew pain like this
When everything dies ('Thing dies)
I never knew love like this
The sun, the sea, you and I (You and I)
I never knew pain, I never knew shame
And now I know why

Bury me, marry me to the sky
Bury me, marry me to the sky
Bury me, marry me to the sky
Bury me, marry me to the sky

If I die before my time
Bury me upside down
Cherokee kissame
When I'm on my way down
If I die before my time
Bury me upside down
Cherokee kissame
When I, I'm going down
