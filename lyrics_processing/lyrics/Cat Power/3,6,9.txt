I feel, I feel tired, awake all night
Head so heavy like a wastebasket
I feel choke, emotionally broke
In the gutter and I'm still looking down
I feel alone

I want out, I want on my own
I want everything I own
I find letters, pictures
Memories of what you can't seem to let go
In your bedside table, in your pocket
In your wallet, you know

Abusive, a stranger in bed
Elusive, forget everything you said
You gotta right to have that hand you own
But the moment you hit it you're on your own
You're ready to go
You're wanting out, you're wanting to hit the road
Your love is like a steamboat running, I need to float
I don't need five times a day
To tell me to go
