Let me tell you a story 'bout Black
The one memory, and the one who threw it right back
He was down so I took a ride
He moved the best way outta there so I took his advice

Oh, two seconds flat
If I'd've know he would've treated me like that
Whoa, two seconds flat
How was I to know he would done me like that?

He had an empty gaze
And his eyes like a bed
Took me thoroughly
I threw the coat away and just like a fox he said

Oh, who's lookin' at ya?
Who was a good kid when God was lookin' after ya?
Whoa, who'll make it through?
How was I to know it would've done this to you?

He made his move then I was down on loan
I kept askin' to come up for luck
I would take it and he would turn it in
Wait, let me catch my breath
That's black if you can catch him with it
I was someone who believed in sin, he said
I think I know just who that is

Oh, who's lookin' at ya?
Who was a good kid when God was lookin' after ya?
Whoa, who'll make it through?
How was I to know it would've done this to you?

Dead man now, once was a friend
Ran all the way upstairs just to make my defense (saved me)
Threw me in the bath with ice and a slap
Can of coke down my throat, almost his whole hand fittin' in (I was dying)
First I was amused, close to death ever been
When the bright light went away I knew death was settin' in
If I knew I would tell ya
To keep trouble off, I tell ya
You're the next one to get
Left with the story, that's when you go mad, that's Black

Oh, who's not lookin' at ya? (angel of death)
Who'll be a good kid now that I'm lookin' after ya?
Whoa, who'll make it through?
How was I to know Black would've turned from me to you?
