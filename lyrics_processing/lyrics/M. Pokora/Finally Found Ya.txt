Look around, look around and I'ma tell you what I've found
In a world so cold and, oh, so lonely
I try to find, find a reason why I'm in denial
In denial about falling again
Don't know if I can bring myself to do it, no

And just when I
Just when I had turned my back on love
Is when I laid my eyes on you
You are the answer to everything, everything

She's incredible, the way her body speaks to me
It's unbelievable that this could ever happen to me
I finally found ya, found ya, found ya
Finally found the one made for me
I finally found ya, found ya, found ya
Finally found the one meant for me

Girl, you don't know how close I came to giving up on everything
I wanted to let it go and to be spared of memories of the pain
I tried in vain, I tried in vain to bring myself around
I really tried to not let it get me down
And I was starting to accept some closure, yeah

Just when I had turned my back on love
Is when I laid my eyes on you
You are the answer to everything, everything

She's incredible, the way her body speaks to me
It's unbelievable that this could ever happen to me
I finally found ya, found ya, found ya
Finally found the one made for me
I finally found ya, found ya, found ya
Finally found the one meant for me

Everything that I've been through was all worth it just for you
'Cause every time I looked in the mirror
I would wish that I was another
But everything changed because of you, because of you

And just when I
Just when I had turned my back on love
Is when I laid my eyes on you
You are the answer to everything, everything
She's incredible, the way her body speaks to me
It's unbelievable that this could ever happen to me
I finally found ya, found ya, found ya
Finally found the one made for me
