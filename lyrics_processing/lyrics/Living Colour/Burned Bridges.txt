Burned up my phonebook now I have to make a real friend
Threw away my watch and wallet now I got no time to spend
Gave up my vices to stop the voices
And now they're back again
Gonna strip it all away
Gonna strip it all away
Gonna strip it all away
Gonna strip it all away
Close my eyes so I don't see things as they are
Stumbling in the darkness here my life seems less bizarre
Can't shut my ears off to the sound of my own screams
No matter how I try I can't escape my dreams
Gonna throw it all away
Gonna throw it all away
Gonna throw it all away
Gonna throw it all away
If I burn every bridge I crossed then
Would that mean that I was lost yeah?
If I burn every bridge I crossed then
Would that mean that I was lost yeah?
If I burn every bridge I crossed then
Would that mean that I was lost yeah?
If I burn every bridge I crossed then
Would that mean that I was lost yeah?

I've given up everything just so I can live
I've searched the whole world over for the thing I cannot find
No one cares about my thoughts so I'll guess I lose my mind
I gave it all away
I gave it all away
I gave it all away
I gave it all away
I burned every bridge I crossed then
Now I know I, know I'm lost yeah
I burned every bridge I crossed then
Now I know I, know I'm lost yeah
I burned every bridge I crossed then
Now I know I, know I'm lost yeah
I burned every bridge I crossed then
Now I know I, know I'm lost yeah
I know I'm lost
I know I'm lost yeah!
