I'm often tempted as I go
To focus my attention on the worry
When I should be looking
At the One who's in control
That's when I open up the Bible
And see where the men of God
Turned their eyes
When they were overcome by tribulation
They just kept looking toward the prize
Daniel did not look at the lions
Stephen did not look at the stones
David did not look at Goliath
Though Goliath looked so big and strong
Moses did not look at the Red Sea
Noah did not look at the flood
Daniel did not look at the lions
When he put his trust in God
So, when a roaring lion comes against you
Don't let it distract you as you run
Keep your eyes upon the Savior
He will guide you safely
'Til your work on earth is done
Remember all the heroes of the Bible
Were just common folks
Who took the time to pray
When our eyes are fixed upon the Father
We'll never have a need to turn away

Stephen did not look at the stones
David did not look at Goliath
Though Goliath looked so big and strong
Moses did not look at the Red Sea
Noah did not look at the flood
Daniel did not look at the lions
When he put his trust in God
So, I won't look at the lions
No, I won't look at the stones
And I won't look at Goliath
Though Goliath looks so big and strong
I will never look down at the Red Sea
And I won't look at the flood
No, I won't look at the lions
For I've put my trust in God
No, I won't look at the lions
