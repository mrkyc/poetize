Sunrise to sunset
Surprise and regret
Sometimes I get
Inside of your head

I got the aches and the pains and the poison in the veins, so come on
I got the hurries and the worries and the good times won't last long
I got the shakes and the quakes and the world in my wake
So I think, I sweat, I pretend to sleep
And I'm waiting to break like
A teenage heart in America

Daybreak to nightfall
I wake when you call
One day we all
Will watch the curtain fall

I got the aches and the pains and the poison in the veins, so come on
I got the hurries and the worries and the good times won't last long
I got the shakes and the quakes and the world in my wake
So I think, I sweat, I pretend to sleep
And I'm waiting to break like
A teenage heart

All I want for Christmas is an AR-15
My stocking stuffed with fentanyl
Drop like a fly at the ripe age of sixteen
Wishing I had a friend to call

Walk straight to shameful
These lines are painful
More black to hold in these eyes
Undone like neckties

I got the aches and the pains and the poison in the veins, come on
I got the ills and the chills and my appetite ain't gonna last long
I got the shakes and the quakes and the world in my wake
So I think, I sweat and I pretend to sleep
And I'm waiting to break like
Like a teenage heart

All I want for Christmas is an AR-15
My stocking stuffed with fentanyl
Drop like a fly at the ripe age of sixteen
Wishing I had a friend to call
I got the aches and the pains and the poison in the veins, come on
I got the ills and the chills and my good times won't last long
I got the shakes and the quakes and the world in my wake
So I think, I sweat, I pretend to sleep
