My, my, what a mess we've made
Of our pretty little heads these days
It appears a heavy wind's blown through here recently
Best wishes have been made for you
You never had no say, it's true
You have to be the cutest gravedigger I've ever seen

And all your lonely nights
In the city of lights are much like
All these crowded bars I so often
Find my stupid self stumbling through

My, my, what a mess was made of my head
When I heard what you'd been through that day
It appears a violent storm's passed through you recently
Letters meant to be sent have been torn
The phone lies off the hook on the floor
All these "I'm sorry"s and "I miss you"s are useless
I fucked this one up long ago

And all your lonely nights
In the city of lights are much like
All these crowded bars I so often
Find my stupid self stumbling through

Fuck you, Aurora
You took my only friend
And although it's all my fault
The blaming myself had to come to an end
So I say fuck you, Aurora
You took my only friend
You won't catch me behind the wheel
Of a Chrysler ever again

My, my, what a mess we've made
Of our precious little lives these days
It appears a big fucking tornado has twisted us up recently
Best wishes have been made for you
You never had no say, it's true
You have to be the cutest gravedigger I've ever seen

And all your lonely nights
In the city of lights are much like
All these crowded bars I so often
Find my stupid self stumbling through

Fuck you, Aurora
You took my only friend
And although it's all my fault
The blaming myself had to come to an end
So I say fuck you, Aurora
You took my only friend
You won't catch me behind the wheel
