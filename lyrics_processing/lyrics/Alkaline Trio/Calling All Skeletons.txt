Here it is again, yet it stings like the first time
Seems it never ends, double nickels on your dime
I thought we were friends, I guess it just depends who you ask
These feelings tend to leave me with a hole in my chest
A hole in my chest

Now the time has come, I just wish I could erase
All the damage done to your name and your keepsakes
Only just begun, it's been fun, we were blind, deaf and dumb
There's a party in my closet, calling all skeletons
Calling all skeletons

Where did you go once the lights went black?
Look what's become of me
I've grown to love your disappearing acts
Do one more, pretty please

Now the time has come, I just wish I could erase
All the damage done, all this pain all this heartache
Only just begun, it's been fun, we were fucked up and numb
There's a killer on the corner and he's looking for love
Yeah, he's looking for you, my love

Where did you go once the lights went black?
Look what's become of me
I've grown to love your disappearing acts
Do one more, pretty please

And to tell you the truth I lost my faith in you
You've gotta stop sneaking off on me
And these unspoken lies appear at the worst times
You've gotta stop sneaking off on me
They're hiding just behind your eyes

Where did you go once the lights went black?
Look what's become of me
I've grown to love your disappearing acts
Do one more, pretty please

Where did you go once the lights went black?
You nearly gave us a heart attack
We thought you might have swam out to sea
