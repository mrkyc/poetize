Flakes! Flakes!
Flakes! Flakes!

Don't do no good
They never be workin' when they oughta should
They waste your time
They're wastin' mine
California's got the most of them
Boy, they got a host of them
Swear to God they got the most (Yeah)
At every business on the coast (Yeah)
Swear to God they got the most (Yeah)
At every business on the coast
They got the Flakes

Flakes! Flakes!

They can't fix your brakes
You ask 'em, "Where's my motor?"
"Well it was eaten by snakes"
You can stab 'n' shoot 'n' spit
But they won't be fixin' it
They're lyin' and lazy
They can be drivin' you crazy
Swear to God they got the most (Yeah)
At every business on the coast (Yeah)
Swear to God they got the most (Yeah)
At every business on the coast

I asked as nice as I could
If my job would
Somehow be finished by Friday
Well, the whole damn weekend
Came and went, Frankie
(Wanna buy some mandies, Bob?)
You know what?
They didn't do nothin'
But they charged me double for Sunday
Now you know no matter what you do
They gonna cheat and rob you
Then they'll give you a bill
That'll get your senses reelin'
And if you do not pay
They got computer collectors
That'll get you so crazy
'Til your head'll go through the ceilin'
Yes it will!

I'm a moron and this is my wife
She's frosting a cake with a paper knife
All what we got here's American made
It's a little bit cheesey
But it's nicely displayed
Well we don't get excited when it
Crumbles and breaks
We just get on the phone
And call up some Flakes
They rush on over
And wreck it some more
And we are so dumb
They're linin' up at our door
Well, the toilet went crazy yesterday afternoon
The plumber he says
"Never flush a tampoon!"
This great information
Cost me half a week's pay
And the toilet blew up
Later on the next day-yay-yay
Yay-yay-yay, yay-yay-yay
Yay-yay-yay, blew up the next day
Woo-ooh
One two three four!
Flakes! Flakes!
Flakes! Flakes!
Flakes! Flakes!
One two three four!
Flakes!
No, no, no-no-no
No, no, no-no-no
No, no, no-no-no

We are millions and millions
We're comin' to get you
We're protected by unions
So don't let it upset you
Can't escape the conclusion
It's probably God's Will
That civilization
Will grind to a standstill
And we are the people
Who will make it all happen
While your children is sleepin'
Your puppy is crappin'
You might call us Flakes
Or something else you might coin us
We know you're so greedy
That you'll probably join us
We're comin' to get ya, we're comin' to get ya
We're comin' to get ya, we're comin' to get ya
We're comin' to get ya, we're comin' to get ya
