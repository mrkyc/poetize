Some of these devices have been known to leave irreparable scars on the minds of foolish young consumers
One such case is seated before you, live on stage. Yes
Terry Bozzio
That cute little drummer!
Terry recently fell in love
With a publicity-photo of a boy named Punky Meadows..., lead guitar player from a group called Angel
In the photo
Punky was seen with a beautiful shiny hairdo
In a semi-profile which emphasized the pootched out succulence
Of his insolent pouting rictus
(Oh Punky!) The sight of which drove the helpless young drummer mad with desire!
BOZZIO:
I can't stand the way he pouts
Cause he might not be pouting for me!
(Ha! Punky Meadows, pouting for you?)
He's not pouting for me?
His hair's so shiny and it's done real nice
'Til I squirm with ecstasy
Punky, Punky, give me your lips to die on!
Oh Punky, isn't it romantic?
Punky, Punky, give me your lips
To die on...I promise not to come in your mouth
Punky, Punky, your album's the shits!
It's all wrong!
You might also likeListen this is no laughing matter!
I ain't really queer
But if he ever got near
Steven Tyler would PAY to see!
PAY to see!
Punky's lips, Punky's lips
His hair's so shiny
I love his hips!
I love his teeth and his gums and such!
Punky
You're an Angel!
You're too much
He's been havin' a rash
(No shit!)
That keeps the girls away
Skin doom
(Skin doom)
Is what the doctors say
I wonder what Punky is rehearsing today
I'll just go over, and hear him play
His hair is so pretty...I'd like to bite his neck
I've heard a rumor he's more fluid than Jeff Beck
BUT I AIN'T QUEER
I AIN'T GAY
(He's a little fond of chiffon in a wrist array-ee-ay-ee-ay)
A wrist array-ee-ay
Punky's lips, Punky's lips!
Oh! I love his hair while eatin' dunk-y chips
Yeah! I love his blink and his blank-blank-blank
Why, maybe he'd like to yank my crank?
YANK IT PUNKY!
YANK IT FASTER!
YANK IT HARDER!
YANK IT ALL NITE LONG!
COME ON PUNKY!
GET FUNKY!
I AIN'T QUEER
(NO NO NO NO)
I AIN'T GAY
(NO NO NO NO)
(He's a little fond of chiffon in a wrist array-he-he-he-hey)
A wrist array-hey
(One more time for the world!)
And then he said:
I AIN'T QUEER
I AIN'T GAY
(He's a little fond of chiffon in a wrist array-ay-hay)
I-I
Lord, I-I'm fo-fo-o-o-nd
Of chiffo-on
In a wrist array-ee-ay-hey
I said
I-I-I-I-I-I-I
I'm a little fo-o-nd
Of chiffo-on
In a wrist array-hey-ay-ay-hey
