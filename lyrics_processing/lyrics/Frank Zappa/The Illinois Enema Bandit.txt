And now folks it's time for Don Pardo To deliver our special Illinois Enema Bandit-type announcement. Take it away, Don!
"This is a true story about a famous criminal from right around Chicago. This is the story of Michael Kenyon, a man who's serving time at this very moment for the crime of armed robbery. It so happens that, at the time of these robberies, Michael decided to give his female victims a little enema. Apparently, there was no law against that; but his name lives on: Michael Kenyon, THE ILLINOIS ENEMA BANDIT!"

Bloomington Illinois...he has caused some alarm
Just sneakin' around there
From farm to farm
Got a rubberized bag
And a hose on his arm
Lookin' for some rustic co-ed rump
That he just might wanna pump
Lookin' for some rustic co-ed rump
That he just might wanna pump

One day he'll have to pay
One day he'll have to pay
The police will say, "You're under arrest!"
And the judge would have him for a special guest
The D.A. will order a secret test
And stuff his pudgy little thumbs in the side of his vest
Then they'll put out a call for the jury folks (That's you over there!)
And the judge would say, "No poo-poo jokes!"
Then they'll drag in the bandit for all to see
Sayin' "Don't nobody have no sympathy...
HOT SOAPY WATER in the FIRST DEGREE!"
And then the bandit might say, "Why is everybody looking' at me?"
WELL DID YOU CAUSE THIS MISERY?
WELL DID YOU CAUSE THIS KINDA MISERY?
