I don't know much about dancin'
That's why I got this song
One of my legs is shorter than the other
And both my feets too long
Course now right along with 'em
I got no natural rhythm
But I go dancin' every night
Hoping one day I might get it right

I'm a dancin' fool (Dancin' fool)
Dancin' fool
I'm a dancin' fool (Dancin' fool)
Dancin' fool
I hear that beat I jump outta my seat
But I can't compete 'cause I'm a
Dancin' fool (Dancin' fool)
Dancin' fool

The disco folks all dressed up
Like they's fit to kill
I walk on in, see 'em there
I'm gonna give them all a thrill
When they see me comin'
They all steps aside
They has a fit while I commit
My social suicide
You might also like
I'm a dancin' fool (Dancin' fool)
Dancin' fool
I'm a dancin' fool (Dancin' fool)
Dancin' fool

The beat goes on and I'm so wrong
Beat goes on and I'm so wrong
Beat goes on and I'm so wrong
The beat goes on and I'm so wrong
The beat goes on and I'm so wrong
The beat goes on and I'm so wrong
The beat goes on and I'm so wrong

I may be totally wrong but I'm a
Dancin' fool
I may be totally wrong but I'm a
Dancin' fool

(Yowza, yowza, yowza)
I got it all together now
With my very own disco clothes, hey
My shirt's half open to show you my chains
And the spoon fer up my nose
I am really something
That's what you'd probably say
So smoke your little smoke, drink your little drink
While I dance the night away
I'm a dancin' fool
I'm a dancin' fool
I'm a dancin' fool
I'm a dancin' fool
He's a dancin' fool
I may be totally wrong but I'm a...
I may be totally wrong but I'm a...
I may be totally wrong but I'm a...
I may be totally wrong but I'm a fool!
