It was an April morning when they told us we should go
And as I turned to you, you smiled at me How could we say no?
With all the fun to have to live the dreams we always had
Oh, the songs to sing when we at last return again

Sending off a glancing kiss to those who claim they know
Below the streets that steam and hiss, the devil's in his hole
Oh, to sail away to sandy lands and other days
Oh, to touch the dream, hides inside and never seen, yeah

Into the sun, the south, the north, at last the birds have flown
Shackles of commitments fell in pieces on the ground
Oh, to ride the wind, to tread the air above the din
Oh, to laugh aloud, dancing as we fought the crowd, yeah

To seek the man whose pointing hand, the giant step unfolds
To guide us from the curving path that turns our feet to stone
If one bell should ring in celebration for a king
So fast the heart should beat as proud the head with heavy feet
Yeah

Oooooh, yeah

Days went by when you and I bathed in eternal summer's glow
As far away and distant, our mutual child did grow
Oh, the sweet refrain soothes the soul and calms the pain
Oh, Albion remains sleeping now to rise again

Wandering and wandering what place to rest the search
The mighty arms of Atlas hold the heavens from the earth
For the mighty arms of Atlas hold the heavens from the earth
From the earth, oh, oh, oh, oh
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
I know the way, know the way, know the way, know the way
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
I know the way, know the way, know the way, know the way

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Ah ah ah ah
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, the mighty arms of Atlas hold the heavens from the earth
(Ohhhhh, ohhh, ohhh, ohhhhh, ohhhhhh)
