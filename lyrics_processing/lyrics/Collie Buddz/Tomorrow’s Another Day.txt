Girl I know you've got some issues, yeah I
And I'd never try to dis you, nuh, nuh, no
Cause no-one knows the life you've been through, oh lord
So I'm just here to wish you the very best inna life

The way you moving nah go get you nowhere but
Tomorrows another day
Tomorrows another day
Where you going nah go take you nowhere
So I just want you to be prepared
Cause judgment a come

No tell me it's a money thing
"whe yuh talk bout?"
Pretty woman like you could a get anything
How you supposed to search for your king
When you're addicted, fi see da money fling girl child
Angel me waan yu spread yuh wings
You nah listen Lauryn Hill when she a talk bout say dis thing
You nah frightened fi see what this carry go bring
Come my dear, mi nah want ya feel da sting cause

The way you moving nah go get you nowhere but
Tomorrows another day
Tomorrows another day
Where you going nah go take you nowhere
So I just want you to be prepared
Cause judgment a come
