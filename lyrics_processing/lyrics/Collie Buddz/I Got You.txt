My girl, you're cool like the other side of the pillow
One in a million girl, you're a killer
Man all a travel the world only fi see you
And every man have something they waan give you
Gyal, mi say, a you
You own the car and the villa
Dem other gyal only beg people dinner
And you no follow-follow trend 'cause you inna your own
And top down inna the Beemer

Gyal, man a run you down 'cause you a lead and a watch too
Girl, you top of the chart
But you know say it's me that a take your heart
Tell dem fi try, but dem can't ever see we part
Gyal, when me hold you pon a rainy night and me a tear down the wall
When you buss, me a just a start
Whine up pon me like we a carnival a Trinidad
Move your body's waistline, girl, you know you're bad
And you got me mad too

'Cause every man a road waan have you
Dem ready fi do anything dem have to
That's why a to the world me a brag to
'Cause I got you, I got you
Dem other gyal deh alright, but no, dem not you
No pay dem no mind when dem a chat you
No matter what, dem still can't stop you
'Cause I got you, I got you
