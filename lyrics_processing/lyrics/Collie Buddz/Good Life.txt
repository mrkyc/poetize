Next shot for the week weh mi had
Three shots make me bun out mi job when me look pon mi check mi feel like me get Robbed
Fourth shot fi bring in party season
Fifth shot mi take just for no reason
Sixth shot make mi almost forget bout the whole damn week mi get a beatin'
Ayyy
Some time inna mi life I just wanna
Hold a vibes and burn the marijuana
Ayyy
Right cha now
Me ready fi go turn it up, gimme de rum wid de chaser
Ay I got some, trees
Me waan fi roll it up but mi forget fi buy paper
This night's going down in history
Nobody can't come talk shit to me
Cause all me need is some girls and weed and a lil bit a liquor and mi dogs weh close to me
It's the good life
Ohhh ohh, Ayy ayy
