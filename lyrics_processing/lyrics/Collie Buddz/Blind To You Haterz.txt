Wha me say... Fukin Haterz you know

I'm blind to you haterz
C'yant touch me war instigators
Me say me where is the love, lately
Ask you how the world ah run so
Said I'm blind to you haterz
C'yant touch me rumor creators
Me say me where is the love, lately
Ask you how the world ah run so

When tings dey pop off
Dem a smile and dey laugh
Dem would ah love to see you fall by the waste side
Dem holla "big up" when pass, PRAY for you down fall fast
And trigger both bomb blasts, like dem nah no pride
Let's give love to the yout dem
When dem brother murder , fe nothing no way
Send out me seeds to the yout dem
Praise the all mighty don't go astray

Unu dem dey a talk, that's true me white like chalk

Dem holla aye p'wan me yard, that's true me modda work hard
Hundred foot dock cause she wan swim in ah the tide
Let's give love to the yout dem
Who Jah bless no man curse no way
Send out message to the yout dem
Only faith cause tomorrow's another day


Unu cya tell me nothing Mr. Envy
Use the talent and the voice whe God a send me
Nuff people out a road, dem chat and all a friend me
But behind my back dem wan end me
But me nah give a damn, buy house and a piece a land
Me walk in ah me timberland, no take me for no simpleton
Just true unna see me calm, only God a feed me and
You nah wan see me cross the line, unu betta know

Im blind to you , unu better now (KNOW)
