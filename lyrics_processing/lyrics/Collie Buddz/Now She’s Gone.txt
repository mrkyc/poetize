Yeah... (Don't you leave... me this way)
Now she gone... (this way)
Gone, gone, gone (Don't you leave... me this way)
Now she gone...
Now she gone...
Boom, ey, yeah yeah
Weh mi seh?

Now she gone
No words could explain the pain
That my feeling
You're forever on my brain
She got me bleedin'
And the whole world to blame
Not she rid the things could not remain the same
I hope you find a lot of nice things out there
Now the memory is all we share
I tell you again girl you know I care
You just let me know and I'll be there

Now it seems like only yesterday
Since you gone away
But then another day goes by
I never meant to make you sad
Or ever treat you bad
I never wanted to see you cry
I should have been there for you
To see this through
The regrets always on my mind
Now it's too late for you
To turn around, oh girl
And see what you've left behind

If I could turn back the hands of time
I would say all the right things
Just to make sure you're mine
I'm blinded by the light
I couldn't see the sign
I took your love for granted
Thought we was fine
But now my mine is on you only
Oh it's so lonely
And now dat it's been so long
With no one to hold me
No one told me
Dat dis reality would hit so strong
Now she gone
