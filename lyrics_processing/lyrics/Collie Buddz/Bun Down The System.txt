Bun down di system, keep dem 'fore yuh burning

Bun down di government, keep di fiya blazing, whole world gone crazy

Take a little look in a di daily newspaper
Every weekend di crime rate a inflate'ah
Why them get choke and di girl dem get rape'ah
Cah, Dem only love di green paper
Dats why dem no have no heart and no conscience
Dem a deal with badness, and a pure nonsense
Killing one another, like it is a contest
Why dem - cyaan let Jah Jah bless?

Why dem a go terrorize

Robbing and yuh stealing, and yuh chopping on yuh dealing
When yuh out your roll you disrespect the ghetto youths feeling
Weapons and yuh drugs overflowing through de ceiling
Working fi de devil, heathen you is a demon
