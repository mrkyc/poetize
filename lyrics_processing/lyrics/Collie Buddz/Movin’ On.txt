Yo just hold firm ya kno

Ay, yo

Wake up in di morning
Say a lickle thing to God
Im bless me there's food inna mi go-bag
Remembering di days when time went hard
Mi belly hungry and mi couldn't find no regular job
Feel like mi can't move, mi trap in a cage
Still searching for di words to put pon di page
Still dreaming bout di day where mi step on di stage
But nutten nuh come, that's when mi bredda seh

You haffi keep movin
Sing on, sing on, yeah aigh
Nuh matter what's goin' on
You know seh you haffi chant on yeah aigh
You haffi keep movin
Sing on, sing on, sing on yeah aigh

It's just another broken-hearted tune fi all di lonely world
When mi seh
Emily she could a tell nuf sad story
Har man abuse har and go beat her up badly
Just a hold the rod stick rudely
Har hope fadin quick of startin a family
One day she decide she can't take it no more
She ball out, cry, go dung on di floor
That's when she take the razor
Till her phone a ring
Somebody on the other line a tell har seh
You haffi keep movin
Sing on, be strong, be strong yeah aigh
So no matter what's goin' on
You know seh you haffi chant on yeah aigh
