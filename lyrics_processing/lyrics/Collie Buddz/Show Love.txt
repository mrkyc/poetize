How them gon' show everything but them never show love?
(A lesson you wan' know)
You can't cash in likes if you run out of love
(A lesson you wan' know)
Just don't believe everything what you seen there
(And you know)
If you want show everything, show a little more love
(The world could use it, I know)

I think we all just a little bit desensitized to reality
From the  other peoples life and not your own, it breeds jealousy
When ya wake up in the morning, what ya scrolling for?
Or you not like somebody comment, what you trolling for?
And when you check it not true in some ad sponsorship and push vanity
Yeah, you can't go nowhere without somebody press record
Feel like we missing out on some of life's real rewards
Well if you want show everybody you some big sale yard
Do your ting dawg, me not business, all I'm saying is

If you gon' post everything, post a little more love
(A lesson you wan' know)
What your followers gon' do when you run out of luck?
(A lesson you wan' know)
Just don't believe everything what you seen there
(And you know)
If you want show everything, show a little more love
(The world could use it, I know)
