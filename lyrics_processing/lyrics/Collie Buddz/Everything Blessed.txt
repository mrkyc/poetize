Bloodclat Amex, ya girl will

When you sleep, she a creep, nobody go-go
Burning the Cali weed, bring me to Cali
I don't want to bush, give me straight gas
Cable to policy, I do a show and set-up you know me it's straight cash
Fuck a check, real friend, a real friend
Ya haffi check, morn time, them sell-out for the bread
Mi weed mean, big on green, it called Shrek
Mi soon reach, I got the plug on deck
