Life short and time flies
Just hold on, enjoy the ride
One minute you're sneaking out your mums, have fi go a party
The next minute, singing lullabies
Like old anthem
Long days and fast nights
Wrong turns and stop lights
Life is a journey
Remember me tell you you're blessed, you're alive
You only get one life

So don't waste it
Don't be basic
If you have a dream, ya better chase it
If something wrong, replace it
In life you learn when you find out you're always strong enough to face it

I know life rough when nobody really knows what ya been through
Just hold on firm, when nobodies there, ya always got to
And I know you've heard this all before 
Me tell you now
What I know now, back in the day I really wish I do

Qualities, policies, your soul
You obviously just gotta be your own person

Yeah
Mixing Hennessy with the apple juice
Reflecting on my journey and how I never had a back up route
Everything was absolute
I did what I had to do
Lot of people losing to themselves and that's the tragic truth
Shit, I was 17 just a blink ago
I was 21 just a drink ago
Think and grow
Rich on my dresser
The journey's my professor
Buried in your mind is the treasure
Yes sir
Life short and time flies
Just hold on, enjoy the ride
One minute you're sneaking out your mums, have fi go a party
The next minute, singing lullabies
Like old anthem
Long days and fast nights
Wrong turns and stop lights
Life is a journey
Remember me tell you you're blessed, you're alive
'Cause you only get one life

So don't waste it
Don't be basic
If you have a dream, ya better chase it
If something wrong, replace it
In life you learn when you find out you're always strong enough to face it
