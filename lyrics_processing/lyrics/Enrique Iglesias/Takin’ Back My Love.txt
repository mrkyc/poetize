Go ahead, just leave, can't hold you, you're free
You take all these things, that they mean so much to you
I gave you your dreams, 'cause you meant the world
So did I deserve to be left to hurt?
You think I don't know (Uh-huh), you're out of control (Uh-huh)
I ended up finding all of this from my boys
Girl, you're stone cold (Uh-huh), you say it ain't so (Uh-huh)
You already know I'm not attached to material

I'd give it all up, but I'm takin' back my love
I'm takin' back my love, I'm takin' back my love
I've given you too much, but I'm takin' back my love
I'm takin' back my love, my love, my love, my love
My love
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh) Oh, oh
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

Yeah, what did I do? But gave love to you
I'm just confused as I stand here and look at you
From head to feet, all that's not me
Go ahead, keep the keys, that's not what I need from you
You think that you know (I do)
You've made yourself cold (Oh, yeah)
How could you believe them over me? I'm your girl
You're out of control (So what?)
How could you let go? (Oh, yeah)
Don't you know I'm not attached to material?

I'd give it all up, but I'm takin' back my love
I'm takin' back my love, I'm takin' back my love
I've given you too much, but I'm takin' back my love
I'm takin' back my love, my love, my love, my love
I'd give it all up, but I'm takin' back my love
I'm takin' back my love, I'm takin' back my love
I've given you too much, but I'm takin' back my love
I'm takin' back my love, my love, my love, my love, my love

So all this love I gave, you take it away? (Uh, uh huh)
You think material's the reason I came? (Uh, uh huh)
If I had nothing would you want me the same? (Uh, uh huh)
You keep your money, take it all away
I'd give it all up, but I'm takin' back my love
I'm takin' back my love, I'm takin' back my love
I've given you too much, but I'm takin' back my love
I'm takin' back my love, my love, my love
I'd give it all up, but I'm takin' back my love
I'm takin' back my love, I'm takin' back my love
I've given you too much, but I'm takin' back my love
I'm takin' back my love (My love) my love (My love) my love (My love, my love) (Say what?)
I'd give it all up, but I'm takin' back my love (I've taken back my love)
I'm takin' back my love, I'm takin' back my love (Oh yeah, Red One!)
I've given you too much, but I'm takin' back my love (Uh-uh, oh oh, uh-uh, oh oh, oh oh)
I'm takin' back my love, my love, my love, my love
