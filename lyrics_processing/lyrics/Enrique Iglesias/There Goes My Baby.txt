There's only one Flo and one Rida
One love, one love!
Enrique, eh, eh

She came from nowhere and she stole my soul
Her love was criminal
I finally found what I was looking for
Now I can't let it go

We break up to make up, yeah
You got me spinning like a yo-yo-yo
But I know that you know, yeah
That girl, you will always be mine, hey!

There goes my baby, whoa
Hey, hey, baby, come back to me, hey
There goes my baby, whoa
Hey, hey, baby, come back to me
Back, back to me

I get so high when she go down down low
She work it nice and slow
We going round and round and back and forth
Can't take it anymore
You might also like
We break up to make up, yeah
You got me spinning like a yo-yo-yo
But I know that you know, yeah
That girl, you will always be mine, hey!

There goes my baby, whoa
Hey, hey, baby, come back to me, hey
There goes my baby, whoa
Hey, hey, baby, come back to me
Back, back to me, hey

Hey, there goes my baby, my wholesome lady
Hold me down if my whole world went crazy
That's what she spoke, just what she said
Now that's a joke, that talk is dead
Know I gotta get over the love I had
The door, I keep it open just in case she come back
Can't deal with the emotions to the point I'm sad
And I know my heart's broken but we got so attached
Baby, come back, I won't get no sleep
She more than I want and all that I need
Locked up my heart and threw away the key so, so
And when my baby come back, I'm crossing my T's
Dotting my I's and now I can't eat
Out of my mind and that's how it's gon' be, so, so (Hey!)
There goes my baby, whoa (There goes my baby)
Hey, hey, baby, come back to me (Oh-oh-oh; hey!)
There goes my baby, whoa (There goes my baby)
Hey, hey, baby, come back to me
Back, back to me (All that she does)
There goes my baby, whoa
Hey, hey, baby, come back to me, hey (Yeah, yeah)
There goes my baby, whoa
Hey, hey, baby, come back to me
