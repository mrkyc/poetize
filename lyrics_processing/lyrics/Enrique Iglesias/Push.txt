Fly boy, yeah right, hehe
Hey mamma, they call me Weezy
And you should be with me, I got a pocket full of reasons
Baby, I could bless you when you ain't even sneezing
I'll be at your rescue when you don't even need me
I could have you dreaming when you ain't even sleeping
Mamma, I could help you get off, like the weekend
She said she wanna do it to the new Enrique
I pop the disc in and put the song on replay
And then she backed it up like replay
Hehehe

When you're near me
Girl, I try to hide it, but I can't escape it
Oh baby
Please forgive me
When I think of you, my thoughts are so X-rated
(Gotta forgive me, baby)
Oh baby

Baby, I don't give a damn
I know that your man's nowhere in sight, whoa-whoa
And your eyes don't tell a lie
I know you wanna come with me, tonight
And I say alright, but first you gotta
