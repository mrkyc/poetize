It's my time, it's my life
I can do what I like for the price of a smile
I got a ticket to ride

So I keep living, 'cause it feels right
And it's so nice
And I'd do it all again
This time, it's forever
It gets better, and I, I, I like how it feels

I like how it feels, I like how it feels
I like how it feels, I like how it feels
I like how it feels
So just turn it up, let me go
I'm alive, yes, you know, never stop
Give me more, more, more
'Cause I like how it feels
Ooh yeah, I like how it feels
You know I like how it feels
Oh yeah, I like how it feels

Show me love, make us one
Let's make a beautiful world
Take my hand, it's alright
'Cause tonight we can fly
You might also like
So we keep living, 'cause it feels right
And it's so nice, and I'd do it all again
This time, it's forever
It gets better, and I, I, I like how it feels

I like how it feels, I like how it feels
I like how it feels, I like how it feels
I like how it feels
So just turn it up, let me go
I'm alive, yes, you know, never stop
Give me more, more, more
'Cause I like how it feels
Ooh yeah, I like how it feels
You know I like how it feels
Oh yeah, I like how it feels

What you all consider the best (Haha)
I consider mediocre (Yeah)
I want my bank accounts like Carlos Slims
Or at least  amini-Oprah (Woo)
Baby, just close your eyes
And imagine any part in the world
I've been there (I've been there)
I'm like global warming
Anything I just start to heat the things up
But I've been here (Haha)
Time traveler, through time zones
Give me some of my vodka any zone
Enrique Iglesias, and translation
Enrique Churches, confessional
Dale mamita, dimelo todo
Alante tu hombre, yo me hago el bobo
No te preocupes, baby, for real
Because you gonna like how it feels
'Cause I like how it feels
Ooh yeah, I like how it feels
You know I like how it feels
Oh yeah, I like how it feels

I like how it feels (You know you want it, you know I like how it feels)
(You know you want it, you know you need it) I like how it feels
(You know you want it) 'Cause I like how it feels
