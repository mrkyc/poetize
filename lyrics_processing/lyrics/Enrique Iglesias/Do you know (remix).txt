Do you know?

Do you know what it feels like
Loving someone that's in a rush to throw you away?
Do you know, do you know, do you know, do ya?
Do you know what it feels like
To be the last one to know the lock on the door has changed
Do you know, do you know, do you know, do ya?

If birds flying south is a sign of changes
At least you can predict this every year
Love, you never know the minute it ends suddenly
I can't get it to speak
Maybe finding all the things it took to save us
I could fix the pain that bleeds inside of me
Look in your eyes to see something about me
I'm standing on the edge and I don't know what else to give

Do you know what it feels like
Loving someone that's in a rush to throw you away?
Do you know, do you know, do you know, do ya?
Do you know what it feels like
To be the last one to know the lock on the door has changed
Do you know, do you know, do you know, do ya?

How can I love you? How can I love you?
How can I love you? How can I love you?
If you just don't talk to me, babe

Flowin' through my head
Is the question, "Is she needing
Another side of a man I cannot be?"
Looking at the last three years like I did
I can never see us ending like this
Do you know
Seeing your face no more on my pillow
Is a scene that's never happened to me
Do you know
But after this episode I don't see
You could never tell how the next day life could be

Do you know what it feels like
Loving someone that's in a rush to throw you away?
Do you know, do you know, do you know, do ya?
Do you know what it feels like
To be the last one to know the lock on the door has changed
Do you know, do you know, do you know, do ya?
Do you know what it feels like
Loving someone that's in a rush to throw you away?
Do you know, do you know, do you know, do ya?
Do you know what it feels like
To be the last one to know the lock on the door has changed
Do you know, do you know, do you know, do ya?

Do you know what it feels like
Loving someone that's in a rush to throw you away?

Do you know what it feels like
To be the last one to know the lock on the door has changed
Do you know, do you know, do you know, do ya?
Do you know what it feels like (you don't know it feels)
Loving someone that's in a rush to throw you away? (you don't know it feels)
Do you know, do you know, do you know, do ya?
Do you know what it feels like (you don't know it feels)
