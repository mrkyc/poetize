Loving you was easy, thought you'd never leave me, yeah, yeah
Wrapped around my finger, see you when I see you, yeah, yeah

Now I'm hearing around that you've been running around
I didn't think I'd miss you, now I'm feeling like a fool
Ooh, ooh-ooh

It hit me like a heart attack
When you finally left me, girl
I thought I'd never want you back
But I don't wanna live in a world without you

I don't wanna live in a world without you
I don't wanna live in a world without you

Never really noticed all the little things you did, you did
Never bought you roses, always was around my friends, my friends

And now I'm hearing around that you've been running around
I didn't think I'd miss you, now I'm feeling like a fool
Ooh, ooh-ooh
You might also like
It hit me like a heart attack
When you finally left me, girl
I thought I'd never want you back
But I don't wanna live in a world without you

I don't wanna live in a world without you
I don't wanna live in a world without you

Never should've let you slip away
Living in a world that's turned to gray
Little did I know it'd hurt so bad (So bad), oh, ooh-ooh

'Cause it hit me like a heart attack
When you finally left me, girl
I thought I'd never want you back
But I don't wanna live in a world without you

I don't wanna live in a world without you
I don't wanna live in a world without you
You
No, oh
I don't wanna live in a world without you
You
No, oh
I don't wanna live in a world without you
Now I'm hearing around that you've been running around
I didn't think I'd miss you, now I'm feeling like a fool
