I don't have to tell you
What this is all about
'Cause, baby, half the fun
Is in us figuring it all out
So why you gotta ask me
What I'm doing now?
'Cause I don't like to question
What I still haven't found (Ooh, yeah)

So don't turn off the lights
I don't wanna be in the dark tonight
'Cause I can't read your mind
I need to know if what I'm doing is right
So don't turn off the lights
So don't turn off the lights

So tell me how we're gonna get there
It's so hard to even try
But if we move together (Ooh, yeah, yeah)
We'll end up on the same side (Ooh, yeah, yeah)

So don't turn off the lights
I don't wanna be in the dark tonight
'Cause I can't read your mind
I need to know if what I'm doing is right
So don't turn off the lights
So don't turn off the lights
You might also like
If you could know what I'm feeling
Would you run, and where would you go?
If you want to know what I'm thinking
Just turn on the lights and you'll know

(So don't) So don't turn off the lights (Don't turn off the lights)
I don't wanna be in the dark tonight
'Cause I can't read your mind (Don't turn out the light)
I need to know if what I'm doing is right
So don't turn off the lights
So don't turn off the lights (Don't turn off the light)
I don't wanna be in the dark tonight
'Cause I can't read your mind (Don't turn off the light)
I need to know if what I'm doing is right
So don't turn off the lights

So don't turn off the lights
So don't turn off the lights
Don't turn off the lights
