Have I told you how good, it feels to be me
When I'm in you?
I can only stay clean when you are around
Don't let me fall, oh no
If I close my eyes forever
Would it ease the pain? Could I breathe again?

Maybe I'm addicted, I'm out of control
But you're the drug that keeps me from dying
Maybe I'm a liar, but all I really know
Is you're the only reason I'm tryin'

I'm wasted away, I've made a million mistakes
Am I too late? Ooh yea
There's a storm in my head, and it rains on my bed
When you're not here
I'm not afraid of dyin'
But I'm afraid of losing you

Maybe I'm addicted, I'm out of control
But you're the drug that keeps me from dying
Maybe I'm a liar, but all I really know
Is you're the only reason I'm tryin'
You might also like
When you're lyin' next to me, love is flowin' through to me
Oh, it's beautiful, Ooh yeah
Everything is clear to me, 'til I hit reality
And I lose it all, I lose it all
I lose it all (I lose it all)

Na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na
(Na, na, na, na, na, na)
Baby, I'm addicted, oh, I'm tryin', tryin', tryin'
Maybe I'm addicted, don't wanna lose it all
(Na, na, na, na, na, na)
Maybe I'm a liar, but all I really know
(Na, na, na, na, na, na)
Is you're the only reason I'm tryin'
(I'm tryin', I'm tryin')

(Na, na, na, na, na, na)
Yeah, you know I'm addicted
Yeah, you know I'm addicted
(Na, na, na, na, na, na)
Yeah, you know I'm addicted
(Na, na, na, na, na, na)
(Na, na, na, na, na, na)
