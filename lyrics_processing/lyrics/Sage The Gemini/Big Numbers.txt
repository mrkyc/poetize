Big numbers, big numbers
100M in the bag, that's a big number
Big numbers, big numbers
Whole team count it, that's a big number

Foreign seats with the foreign leather
Foreign number I put the card in the ATM and it said error

Bad bitches eatin presto

If you throw it, I'ma catch those

Numbers saying no name though

We need more, tell 'em we need more
Putting numbers on the board like I'm keep the score
Sixteen cars in my front yard
30 on my wrist when I point to God
