If I said I was in love, with you?
You say I'm a player, not true
Only one on my roster is you
You need it, I got it, come get it, get it, baby
You need it, I got it, come get it, get it, baby
You need it, I got it, come get it, get it, baby
You need it, I got it, come get it, get it, baby

Six months too long
Come home while you gone
I'ma get it, watch me put it down on you
You like it how I go four rounds on you
Rack it up, rack up, lift that up, back that up
And if I put it in your life you might not get that back up
I promise, you know I do it better than the rest, though
Other girls want it, all they get is "Hell no"

They say a nigga soft 'cause I care for you
I admit I'm actin' real for you, fuck it I'm there for you (There for you)
Yeah, fuck it, I'm there for you (There for you)
If you need, I'ma send it over there for you

Nigga, I do it in the parking lot
Yeah, girl, you like that, I ain't gotta do a lot
Plus I got a coupe, so you know that we can moan a lot
You gonna make a drop, I don't stop, I lick up every drop
