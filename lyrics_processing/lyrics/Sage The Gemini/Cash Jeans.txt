Moon-walking on my haters like I'm Billy Jeans (Woah)

Eyy, I pull up and Lucci got the other rock
How you got a attitude and you are just a 5
My girl a apple , you a dell
That's why I'm only sayin hello from the other side
You know me, I'm the motherfuking shit
Shoot your tongue out your mouth, watch me hit a fucking lick
Next up, zero in my muhfucking wrist
Only your girl 'round me, how much I'm ramming this bitch
Pull like I'm postal yeah, Confused where we throw 'em at
Thing where the rover at, my niggas gon cock it back
I never taught them that and we cannot hold 'em back
Blam, to the back of the bus where they want Rosa parks at

Got rid of the Bentley 'cus I wasn't really feeling it
I'ma buy a Ghost or a BMW for Halloween
I ain't seen my backyard ever since I bought the place
I wanna shop, it's closed, I just contact the place
Got paid for 30k, I don't care 'bout the check
I just want the front cleared, that's my damn parking space
I'm driving on the road like a ass-hole
I'm from here, I don't need no map hoe
My car all black on black tho
So black it should have a name and a Afro
Holla at your muhfucking boy when you see him
Black white, ying yang , Twins BM BM
And she know, when I call, it's for the check
Collect caller, when I call, it's to collect, yeah
