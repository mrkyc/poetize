Nigga, where you from? Rep that shit (What)
Heart Break, that's that clique (What)
I be riding, sliding, slipping and dipping
I'm about money, clothes, cars and women
And that's that
Chuck a deuce when you see me in the street, nigga
Holla at me when you see me in the street, nigga

Ride around my city like the only one
Niggas hating on me, I don't understand
I'm from Fairfield, rep it like the only one
Wouldn't waste a bullet on niggas 'cause this my only gun
Pull up fifty cars  in the radio
Punch a nigga for speaking retarded, now he his radio
Trigger boy, that's a flash like a camera, gave you a cameo
Your bitch screaming, she like the way, I should be sammy, uh
S-A-G-E, Mr. Two-Hit-Wonder
I hit your bitch two times, leave that bitch to wonder
A few party songs got a young thunder
I got hella cheese waking bitches out they slumber
And I can really rap, man, I swear I could
I ain't gotta explain shit, I just thought I should
And all my niggas carry gym and honor wood
Never been scared but I like the fact you thought I should, bitch

10k for a verse
If there is money in my rear view I put it in reverse, uh
Life, ain't that a bitch?
I'ma marry that girl, bring her back to the Rich
Said it's Heart Break Gang, just me and my homies
Pressing you squares, no Sony
PlayStation haters need a vacations fast
Check so big that they can't pay in cash
You talk business, I talk math
'Cause nigga, all I do is multiply and add
Joint so big it look like half
My arm, all I smoke is gas
91 dressing like it's '91
Ain't a rapper better than me but I'ma find me one and sign him
Only wear designer
Nigga, I be balling out the gym, I be LeBron'ing
Nigga, where you from? Rep that shit (What)
Heart Break, that's that clique (What)

Most of these niggas be hating on a G
And they mad as fuck, they ain't on like me
Yeah, it's HBK, ho, stack that cheese
I be photo shooting fresh, step back, say cheese
More money blew so I don't stack green
Don't fuck with police but we both say "Freeze"
You would think your girlfriend on a rock band spree
How she L-I-C-K-I-N-G, oh
Put me on a beat and 
All a hater see, no snow autotune
Married to the game, we are bride and groom
Took your girl, made a movie, I was coming soon
Thank the Lord for the nice things
Me and my wrist went to the hood, they think I'm ice cream
Money sky scrape, big site seeing
Too many Jordans, think I should join the flight team
Nigga, where you from? Rep that shit (What)
Heart Break, that's that clique (What)
I be riding, sliding, slipping and dipping
I'm about money, clothes, cars and women
And that's that
Chuck a deuce when you see me in the street, nigga
