She came through stunting, red-hair ruckus
And she don't do the black, I thank her Uncle Ruckus
She got hella back and she don't get her friend
She love attention, thirsty niggas always in the sun
She hold up that sign to let a nigga know
She don't do broke rich niggas, new coach
She just make a phone call and get some new dough
(Brr-brr, bitch nigga, that's new clothes)
Sneak in a girl dorm, hide in her clothes
She from the step team, you know I'm into those
Workout booty, yeah, there ain't nothing silicone
Give her the vitamins, but she don't get minerals
All my niggas stepping, repping fraternities
All my girls stepping, repping sororities
Tell that girl you don't rep more than me
Tell that nigga you don't rep more than me!
