I've been waiting on my own
For a lifetime and it shows
Got the way I seem to
Keep my distance from you
Baby there's no need to go
Prove you love me when it shows
And the ones before you
Make it hard to love at all

Every time I try
To make myself seem small
In the arms of others
Who never loved me better
All the ways I tried
To make myself less selfish
It never made them stay
And I can't love me like this
I can't love me like this

So can you call all your friends, baby?
Tell them to find other plans
'Cause I need you tonight, baby
I need to know that everything's alright, baby
I need to know that everything's alright

I've been waiting for someone
Who will cure what I've become
Got the way I seem to
Need nobody but you
Maybe there's another way
I can never make you stay
And the ones before you
Never loved me like you do

Every time I try
To make myself seem small
In the arms of others
They never love you better
Every time I tried
To make myself seem empty
It never made them stay
It only made them hurt me
Only made them hurt me

So can you call all your friends, baby?
Tell them to find other plans
'Cause I need you tonight, baby
I need to know that everything's alright, baby
So can you call all your friends, baby?
Tell them to find other plans
'Cause I need you tonight, baby
I need to know that everything's alright, baby
So can you call all your friends?
Tell them to find other plans
'Cause I need you tonight
I need to know that everything's alright
