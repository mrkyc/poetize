You show me 50 stars I'll give you 50 kisses from my soul, my soul
Oh, and every day I pledge alligence to my girl
Cause you're the reason
My sun rises in the west
I know its strange but thats where you are
Yeah, right in my heart
Red hair, white skin, blue eyed girl
Wait for us while we change the world
My tired bones still fight for her
My red hair, white skin, blue eyed girl
Oh yeah the bombs are falling
Lighting up my sky like the 4th of July
You're the apple of my eye
My sweet American pie
I'm less than 30 days away from seeing your pretty angel face once more, once more
If all is fair in love and war you'll find my purple heart at your front door
Red hair, white skin, blue eyed girl
Wait for us while we change the world
My tired bones still fight for her
My red hair, white skin, blue eyed girl
