As he came into the window
Was a sound of a crescendo
He came into her apartment
He left the bloodstains on the carpet
She was sitting at the table
He could see she was unable
So she ran into the bedroom
She was struck down
It was her doom

Annie, are you okay, you okay, you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay, you okay, you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay, you okay, you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay, you okay, you okay, Annie?

Annie, are you okay
Will you tell us that you're okay
There's a sign at the window
That he struck you
A crescendo, Annie
He came into your apartment
Left the bloodstains on the carpet
And then you ran into the bedroom
You were struck down
It was your doom

So they came into the outway
It was Sunday, but a black day
I could make a salutation
Sounding heartbeats, intimidation
Annie, are you okay, you okay, you okay, Annie?
