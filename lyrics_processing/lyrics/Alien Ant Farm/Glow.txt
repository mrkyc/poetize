I never thought that you'd find out I did it
I was so scared that you would leave so I hid it
I know we said that we'd always be honest
So now I went out and messed up, our nest
It finally seems like we've turned into strangers
Its gotten so bad there's just no more anger
So now it seems like we can't get no further
I can't believe I'll be bright for another

I'll be the switch she turns on
She'll be mine too, I get off
I'll be the fuse that she blows
And even with the lights out we'll glow
Oh-oh, oh-woah-oh

So where's the sun it shines no love on your face
Under the moon and with the girl that's in your place
And even Edison has no idea
Of all the blackouts I've caused you and me

I'll be the switch she turns on
She'll be mine too, I get off
I'll be the fuse that she blows
And even with the lights out we'll glow
I'll be the switch she turns on
She'll be mine too, I get off
I'll be the fuse that she blows
And even with the lights down real low

I'll be the switch she turns on
She'll be mine too, I get off
I'll be the, I'll be the fuse that she blows
And even with the lights out we'll glow
I'll be the switch she turns on
She'll be mine too, I get off
I'll be the fuse that she blows
And even with the lights out we'll glow
I'll be the switch she turns on
She'll be mine too, I get off
I'll be the fuse that she blows
And even with the lights out we'll glow

(I'll be the, I'll be the fuse)
