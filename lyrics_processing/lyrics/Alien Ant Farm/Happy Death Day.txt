I slowly shoot these words like weapons
And go insane
I watch you drive your stupid car
You go away
You never were one to use caution
And you don't obey
You know I'd love to see it happen

I always tried to keep you near me
Without the pain
I love to tie us into knots
We slipped away
I tried to captivate you, on that evening
He was leaving, with the girl I'd love to kill

Happy death day to you, baby
I know you're flying in the blue now
We'll be together real soon now baby, don't you worry
Papa's got a brand new body bag for you

Cable cars run through my mind
Reminiscent Bay
I think I'd love a valentine
I wish you'd stay
You never were one to use caution
It slipped away
I somehow knew this would happen

And I got a fresh new kind of attitude


I slowly shoot these words like weapons
And go insane

You go away
You never were, you never were
You know I'd love to see it happen, yeah
