This is an anthem for the choked up
A girl walks by with her nose up
You can get her with a little bit of focus
Now I know you like to sit back
While all the guys spit the game try to hit that
Boy you know its time to man up
Don't need an invite you just show up
Whens the last time you felt some skin?
I bet you can't remember when
Nobody scores from the sidelines
Everyone's in the game now its your time
Quit running and come out of your shell
And when you do you're gonna raise all hell
Nobody scores from the sidelines
Take your time find a place to begin
I know that sounds like a lot to take in
Now I'm not saying you should live in sin
Its just more fun to be had than a has-been
So here we go your gonna come through
You owe it to yourself I know you really want to
Now I'm gonna' tell you how to win
Just listen close to my choked up anthem
Whens the last time you felt some skin?
I bet you can't remember when

Everyone's in the game now its your time
Quit running and come out of your shell (come out of your shell)
And when you do you're gonna raise all hell. (raise all hell)
Nobody scores from the sidelines
What makes you shy away?
Never have a single thing to say
Whose stepping on your self-esteem?
If you don't get that girl
You know that someone will
You've gotta make some noise if you wanna be seen
Nobody scores from the sidelines
Everyone's in the game now its your time
Quit running and come out of your shell
And when you do you're gonna raise all hell
(N.O.B.O.D.Y scores from the sidelines)
