It was the sound of
A crescendo
He came into her apartment
He left the bloodstains on
The carpet
She was sitting at the table
He could see she was unable
So she ran into the bedroom
She was struck down, it was
Her doom

Annie are you okay
Will you tell us that you're okay
There's a sign in the window
That he struck you - a crescendo Annie
He came into your apartment
He left the bloodstains on the carpet
Then you ran into the bedroom
You were struck down
It was your doom
