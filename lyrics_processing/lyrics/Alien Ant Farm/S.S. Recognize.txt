I'm back to your game
Inpacting for rain
And to the flow when
I think the vessel bent
Now time is precious
Rocky waves we're nauseous
Knocking... Everything is wet!
From us the ocean will be fed
What made us try
To have done what we do
Let's dream of dry
To not tremble in the
Night sky fuel shy

Don't you recognize, I'll rock the boat again
I'm getting scurvy, bad
Don't you recognize, I'll rock the boat again
I'm getting scurvy, bad

Now it's been days
And the sun won't show a face
To blame mistakes on me
Now the cold becomes obscene

Think I'm saving my life again
This ship has made me cry
I think the next we should fly
Night sky fuel shy

Don't you recognize? I'll rock the boat again
I'm getting scurvy, bad!
Don't you recognize? I'll rock the boat again
I'm getting scurvy, bad!

Will bring up all the sharks
'Cause all the whales have got my suit
You failed to recognize all the things we do
Check yourself, the boat's just 'bout to sink
Your gonna choke on the salt if you try to drink
Will bring up all the sharks
'Cause all the whales have got my suit
You failed to recognize all the things we do
Check yourself, the boat's just 'bout to sink
'Cause we don't need you, bitch
You think you are the missed link
All the prison in the world couldn't make you
All the rescue that I seem to bring you
Stand up or sit back and walk the plank
Kiss the deck and recall
All the prison in the world couldn't make you
All the rescue that I seem to bring you
Stand up or sit back and walk the plank
Kiss the deck and recall
All the prison in the world couldn't make you
All the prison in the world couldn't make you
All the prison in the world couldn't make you
Jump, Jump, Jump
Sit back and walk the plank
Kiss the deck and recall all you used to take
All the things that don't work
Hit the deck and recall

Don't you recognize? I'll rock the boat again
I'm getting scurvy, bad!
Don't you recognize? I'll rock the boat again
I'm getting scurvy, bad!

Don't you?
Don't you?
Don't you?
