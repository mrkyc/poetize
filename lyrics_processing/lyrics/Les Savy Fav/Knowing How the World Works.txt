And record what you learn
You're graphing the data
And tagging up our ears
Complex simulations
With graph paper gears

Knowing how the world works
Is not knowing how to work the world
Knowing how the world works
Is not knowing how to work the world
Knowing how the world works
Is not knowing how to work the world
Knowing how the world works
Is not knowing how to work the world
