When the earth lets you down?
What holds you up
When gravity's corrupted?
I hope atoms are enough
'Cause Eve sure ain't coming
The temperature's up in the afternoon sun
The hand threw the breaker
But the circuit's still humming
The man tried to break her
But Miss Switch kept on running
She ran from the papist
She ran from the crown
She ran to her study
And wrote all this down:
"I want to keep the perfect flowers from the florist
They grow in private, deep inside the thickest forest
And when you snip them down
You almost hear them sigh
There they're drying asking
'Why do we have to die?'"
What holds you up
When you're ready to go?
What holds you up
While the seconds hand is ticking?
Can you feel them slip away?
80,000 every day

Fuck the boulders on the hill
I see pictures in the clouds
We've got little yellow pills
We've got great, big, black shrouds
We've got
Arms in the armory
Facts in the factory
Cents in the century
This century of centipedes
This century is killing me
This century lied
I hope that we do better next time
I would like to see the tyrant's daughter
So upset by what her father taught her
I would like to see the tyrant's son
So outraged by what his father's done
I would like to see the tyrant's mother
So regretful she did not smother
I would like to see the tyrant's dad
I'll bet he's glad
Hide me from next February
I've grown fat
And I've grown tired;
Kiss my ass
Now I was once admired
I've grown tired
And I've grown fat
But there's one more thing so much better than that:
