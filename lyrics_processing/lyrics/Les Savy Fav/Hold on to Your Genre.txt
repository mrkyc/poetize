Your genre's got a hold on you
Hold on to your hairdo
It's the only thing to hold onto
Hold on to your genre
Your genre's got a hold on you
Get up on the vapor
'Cause the solid's tough to hold on to
There's a promise in the back room
Read it written in the bathroom
You tell a little lie and then you
Try to get us in your bedroom
We live our little lives and then you
Try to drag us to your death tomb
I've been checking the seams
Of your red velvet blazer
Now I'm haunted by dreams
Of the things I've found hid there:
All the rabbits you've vanished
All the cards that you've killed
All the dawns that you've banished
With too many pills, pills, pills
You might also likeTogether, forever
The pity, the pleasure
The privilege, the pressure
The arteries we sever
The stillness, it chills us
It's chills that we crave
The stillness will fill us when we fill in our graves
I never wanted something
Like nothing half this much
I'd gladly trade my state
For nullity and such
For once, to stop this buzzing
The lights inside my head
Can I please have truly nothing
Once before I'm dead?
There's a promise in the back room
Read it written in the bathroom
You tell a little lie and then you
Try to get us in your bedroom
We live our little lives and then you
Try to drag us to your death tomb
I've been checking the seams
Of your red velvet blazer
And I'm seeing the lines
Of your will and your wish list:
And you wish you were nothing
And you wish you were cold
And you wish days meant something
So you'd stop getting old
Back in the day, you loved the night
And you would feast with great delight
A walnut coffin lined in silk
And daughter's blood was mother's milk
And now, with fangs rust red as dusk
A wet mouth in a dried up husk
You try to make me "one of us"
You try to make me "one of us"
Are you sick of being pretty?
Are you sick of being cool?
Are you alive beneath that makeup?
Or just an undead ghoul?
Are you sick of being pretty?
Are you sick of being cool?
Are you alive beneath the makeup?
Or just an undead ghoul?
Are you sick of being pretty?
Are you sick of being cool?
Are you alive beneath that makeup?
Or just an undead ghoul?
Are you sick of being pretty?
Are you sick of being cool?
Are you alive beneath the makeup?
