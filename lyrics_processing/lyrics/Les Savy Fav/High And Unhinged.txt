In that black cavernous hole?
Why did you leave me to die?
I know why
I know why
I know why
I know why
I know why
I know why
I know why
Because you're sick of yourself
I'm pretty sick of you too
You think that cutting me out
Can fix the things that you do
And you've done to outdo
And become so approved
And beloved
By the crowd
That you covet and I hope
That you know
That it's you, you, you
Who's all alone
Out on the fringe
We get high and unhinged
And the outcasts are in
Pressing skin onto skin
Onto skin
Onto skin
You might also likeHow many hands
Have you bit
To get to rings you can kiss?
How many souls you dismissed
So you get on a list
So elite for effect
So effete
That you let them mistreat you
You know dress just right
And you speak so fine
They've turned you so uptight
And they've been so unkind
And they're wasting your time
And they're robbing you blind
And they'll leave you behind
And you know
That I know
That it's you, you, you
Who's all alone
Out in the fringe
We get high and unhinged
Then the outcasts are in
Pressing skin onto skin
Onto skin
Out in the fringe
We get high and unhinged
And the outcasts are in
Pressing skin onto skin
Onto skin
Onto skin
Onto skin
Onto skin
Onto skin
'Cause you buried your foes
And buried your friends
And you're keeping a list
And the list never ends
'Cause you buried your foes
And you buried your friends
And you're keeping a list
And the list never ends
Well we're waltzing away
To the bottom of the barrel
Yeah we're waltzing to the bottom of the barrel
And we're waltzing away to the bottom of the barrel tonight
Well we're waltzing away
To the bottom of the barrel
Yeah we're waltzing to the bottom of the barrel
And we're waltzing away to the bottom of a barrel tonight
Well we're waltzing away
To the bottom of the barrel
Yeah we're waltzing to the bottom of the barrel
