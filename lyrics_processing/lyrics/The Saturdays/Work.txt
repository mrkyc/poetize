Oh, ooh
Ooh

Baby, the harder you work
The further you get with me, with me
I think you can, I think you can
Turn up prepared and be sure
That you can keep up with me, with me
I think you can, I think you can

But be aware, I always get what I deserve
Keep your focus, keep your nerve
Ready, set, go

Pick up the pace and step on it
Rip up the place if you want it
Work, work
You know you gotta work, work (Aah, aah, ah)
I got the goods and I want you
Put your boots on, baby, get to
Work, work
You know you gotta work, work
You might also like
I tend to get what I want
So are you starting to see, to see? Ah
I think you do, I think you do
It's time for you to step up
If you wanna be with me, with me (With me)
I think you do, I think you do

But don't go slow, that is not the way we play
Slowly ain't my kind of game
Ready, set, go

Pick up the pace and step on it
Rip up the place if you want it
Work, work
You know you gotta work, work (Oh oh oh) (Aah, aah, ah)
I got the goods and I want you
Put your boots on, baby, get to (I got the goods, baby, get to)
Work, work
You know you gotta work, work

And it's up to you how far we take this
Yes, it's up to you so take the lead
And it's up to you so tell me
What I've gotta sign waiting at the finish line
Baby, ready, set, go
Pick up the pace and step on it (Ooh, ooh)
Rip up the place if you want it
Work, work
You know you gotta work, work (Ooh) (Aah, aah, ah)
I got the goods and I want you (I got the goods, yeah)
Put your boots on, baby, get to (Put your boots on, baby)
Work, work
