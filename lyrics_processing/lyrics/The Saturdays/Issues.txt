Oh, yeah

Sometimes I feel like I'm going out of my mind
Boy, the way you do me, it's a damn crime
But then you smile at me and it's all right
With you there ain't no in between

Every time that I walk out the door
Tell myself I won't take it no more
There's a part of me won't let you go
I keep saying yes, but my mind's sayin' no

Me and my heart, we got issues (Issues)
Don't know if I should hate you or miss you
Damn, I wish that I could resist you
Can't decide if I should slap you or kiss you
Me and my heart, we got issues, issues, issues
We got issues, issues, issues

It's all wrong, boy, you leave me hangin' for so long
You empty out my love until it's all gone
You change the words, but still, it's the same song
I'm tired of that melody
You might also like
Change my number and throw out your clothes
But my feeling for you, it still shows
I keep building a wall 'round my heart
But then I see you and it all falls apart

Me and my heart, we got issues (Issues)
Don't know if I should hate you or miss you (Damn, I wish)
Damn, I wish that I could resist you (Can't decide if I should)
Can't decide if I should slap you or kiss you (Me and my heart)
Me and my heart, we got issues, issues, issues (Ooh, ooh)
We got issues, issues, issues

Why fight it? Can't hide it
Truth is I think I like it
Confusion, illusion
Still, I don't know which way to go

Me and my heart, we got issues
Don't know if I should hate you or miss you
Damn, I wish that I could resist you
Can't decide if I should slap you or kiss you (Me and my heart)
Me and my heart, we got issues (We gotta work this thing out)
Don't know if I should hate you or miss you (I don't know)
Damn, I wish that I could resist you
Can't decide if I should slap you or kiss you
Me and my heart, we got issues, issues, issues
We got issues, issues, issues
We got issues, issues, issues (Me and my heart)
We got issues, issues, issues
Me and my heart, we got issues (Can't decide which way to go)
