I'm doing nothing
'Cause then at least I'm doing nothing wrong
And I'm gon' stay in on my own
Then turn off my telephone
If nothing's gained, then nothing's won

And you can tell 'em
Yeah, you can say whatever, I don't care, yeah
And if you wanna play it cool
Then I got news for you
It's getting hotter, hotter in here

So when I speak, listen, this is my decision
And you keep on messing up the words
So when I speak, listen, 'cause you keep on pushing
Like I need permission to be heard
I'm gonna lift it, lift it higher
I'm gonna lift it, lift it higher
So when I speak, listen, this is my decision
And you keep on messing up the words

I'm getting closer
I'm moving in and, yeah, I think you know
'Cause I am sick of playing games
And I'm not gon' say no names
But you and I know who to blame
You might also like
So you can tell 'em
Yeah, you can go ahead and put it straight
'Cause I am finishing myself
And I do not need your help
I'm gonna do this, do it right

So when I speak, listen, this is my decision
And you keep on messing up the words
So when I speak, listen, 'cause you keep on pushing
Like I need permission to be heard
I'm gonna lift it, lift it higher
I'm gonna lift it, lift it higher
So when I speak, listen, this is my decision
And you keep on messing up the words

I'm gonna lift it, lift it
When you go higher, I go higher
I'm gonna lift it, lift it
Yeah, you can try but I'll go higher
I'm gonna lift it, lift it
The only thing, boy, all that you can do is listen, so listen!

So when I speak, listen, this is my decision
And you keep on messing up the words
So when I speak, listen, 'cause you keep on pushing
Like I need permission to be heard
I'm gonna lift it, lift it higher
I'm gonna lift it, lift it higher
So when I speak, listen, this is my decision
