I turn around to feel the sun in my face
Barefoot in the grass, standing next to you I feel so right
All these flashes of old memories, my past, you and I
All that we've been through, I feel so alive

I was afraid, I was scared to fall
I can't believe that I almost lost it all

So I am standing here locked to you
I realize that I need you now to make my heart beat fast
You're the only one
And I'm so sorry I'm such a fool
Baby I know that I need you now
You are the only one

Who makes my heart beat faster, faster, faster, faster
You make my heart beat faster, faster, faster, faster
Baby you make my heart beat faster, faster, faster, faster
You make my heart beat faster, faster, faster, faster

I used to think about destiny, my way
Left or right? But boy I was running in circles
And now you're standing in front of me, hands down, you and I
This time I promise I won't let you go
You might also like
I was afraid, I was scared to fall
Running from love and I almost lost it all

So I am standing here locked to you
I realize that I need you now to make my heart beat fast
You're the only one
And I'm so sorry I'm such a fool
Baby I know that I need you now
You are the only one

Who makes my heart beat faster, faster, faster, faster
Baby, you make my heart beat faster, faster, faster, faster
Baby you make my heart beat faster, faster, faster, faster
You make my heart beat faster, faster, faster, faster

So baby, let's hold on 'cause baby the time goes
You were the only one and I almost lost it all

So I am standing here locked to you
I realize that I need you now to make my heart beat fast
You're the only one
And I'm so sorry I'm such a fool (I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I am)
Baby I know that I need you now
You are the only one
Oh, you make my heart beat faster, faster, faster, faster
You make my heart beat faster, faster, faster, faster
Baby, you make my heart beat faster, faster, faster, faster
You make my heart beat faster, faster, faster, faster
Oh, you make my heart beat faster, faster, faster, faster
You make my heart beat faster, faster, faster, faster
Baby you make my heart beat faster, faster, faster, faster
