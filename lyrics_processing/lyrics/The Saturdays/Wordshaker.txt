Oh, boy, yeah, yeah, yeah

Baby, I got you on my answering machine on replay
This is getting difficult in my say
Stutter's on my mind when you approach me
With soft untrusting words

Velvet linings on your language
Boy, you got me hanging but it's so hard to hold on

You're such a wordshaker
Talk and you take it back, twisting, turning
You're such a wordshaker
I gotta shut you up, your lips are burning
Then you say yes, then no
When you are ready then baby let me know
You're such a wordshaker
Talk and you take it back-back, shaking me off my track

Leaving?
I tell you that's impossible when you are speaking
This is so unfair and I'm so deep in
Head above the water, still I'm sinking
So please make up your mind
