What's it gonna be?
Are you willingly walking away from this?
What's it gonna take?
Can you really break this love?
Where you gonna go?
Tell me, do you know?
And is your heart in it?
'Cause if you leave, baby then leave
Make up your mind before you shut the door

'Cause if there's a chance we might've missed
And if there's a ray of light in this
Baby you should know that
This is where my heart takes over, over, over

Going back in time
You know we have tried too hard to let this fade
Almost disappeared
Still we've made it here, baby
And look me in the eye
Promise I won't cry, this is your choice to make
'Cause if you go, baby then go
You change your mind, I won't be here no more
You might also like
'Cause if there's a chance we might've missed
And if there's a ray of light in this
Baby you should know that
This is where my heart takes over, over
And if there's a small piece left of us
Somewhere in the battles we have lost
Baby look at me 'cause
This is where my heart takes over, over, over

This is where my heart takes over, over
This is where my heart takes over, over
This is where my heart takes over, over
This is where my heart takes over, over

What's it gonna be?
Are you willingly walking away from this?

'Cause if there's a chance we might've missed
And if there's a ray of light in this
Baby you should know that
This is where my heart takes over, over
And if there's a small piece left of us
Somewhere in the battles we have lost
Baby look at me 'cause
This is where my heart takes over, over, over
This is where my heart takes over, over
This is where my heart
This is where my heart takes over, over
This is where my heart
This is where my heart takes over, over
This is where my heart
