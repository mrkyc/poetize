Oh, yeah-yeah, mm

Letting you go is pretty damn difficult
'Cause there was a time I would be for you
What you need from me ( I would do what)
Whatever to be rolling with you
And you know I took it as far as I can go
So I'm gonna lay it out right for you
You're not good to me (I know I've been)
Blind but I can open my eyes

And I see just what you are
Not for me, I don't know why
I wanted you, I don't want you
I deny, oh

All that you did and all that you didn't
All that you said and all that you wouldn't
Deny, I deny it, defy everything, oh
All that we were and all that we called love
All that you were and all that you made up
Defy, I defy it, I deny everything you are
You might also like
And everything we were
And everything you are
And everything we were, and

You took your time, well baby you should took up all of mine
So when I say "you should leave", you don't question me
When I'm telling you (I don't want you)
Hiding on my mind anymore

I don't want you, you can go
Leave my keys and close the door
I don't need somebody like you
I deny, oh, I deny

All that you did and all that you didn't
All that you said and all that you wouldn't
Deny, I deny it, defy everything, oh
All that we were and all that we called love
All that you were and all that you made up
Defy, I defy it, I deny everything you are

And everything we were
And everything you are
And everything we were, and (Ooh)
Don't tell me
You never thought that we would come to this
Standing here, giving up all that we have been
Woah, and
Don't blame me
This is not about what I have done
I've done all I could do, still we fought
Still you try, but baby, I deny

All that you did and all that you didn't (Oh, oh)
All that you said and all that you wouldn't (Ooh)
Deny, I deny it, defy everything (I deny it)
All that we were and all that we called love (Oh)
All that you were and all that you made up
Defy, I defy it, I deny everything, oh (Ooh)
All that you did and all that we made up
All that you said and all that you wouldn't (Oh woah woah)
Deny, I deny it, defy everything, oh (Ooh)
All that we were and all that we called love
All that you were and all that you made up
Defy, I defy it, I deny everything you are (I deny)

And everything we were
And everything you are
And everything we were, and
