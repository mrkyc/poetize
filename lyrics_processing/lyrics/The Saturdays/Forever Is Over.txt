I was caught in a place
Far away from the light
What I saw, I couldn't face
So I closed my eyes

Wish I could turn back the page
Rewrite my point of view
Save all the time you waste
(Got to get gone, gone)
Don't let it escalate
Don't fight, it's just no use
There's nothing left to say
Got to get gone, gone, gone

Forever is over and my heart's not gonna break
Forever is over and I'm no longer afraid
'Cause if I don't get out now, I may never escape
Your power is fading away
And I'm getting closer to the place I belong
Forever is over (Over, over, over, over)

I don't want you to tell me you've found someone
'Cause I've got no distance left to run
You might also like
Wish I could turn back the page
Rewrite my point of view
Save all the time you waste
(Got to get gone, gone)
Don't let it escalate
Don't fight, it's just no use
There's nothing left to say
Got to get gone, gone, gone

Forever is over and my heart's not gonna break
Forever is over (Forever is over) and I'm no longer afraid
'Cause if I don't get out now, I may never escape
Your power is fading away
And I'm getting closer to the place I belong
Forever is over (Over, over, over, over)

I'm on the other side
And now I've realized
I'm in paradise
'Cause you're out my life, life, life

Forever is over and my heart's not gonna break
Forever is over (Forever is over) and I'm no longer afraid
'Cause if I don't get out now, I may never escape (Never escape)
Your power is fading away (Ooh)
And I'm getting closer to the place I belong
Forever is over (Over, over, over, over)
