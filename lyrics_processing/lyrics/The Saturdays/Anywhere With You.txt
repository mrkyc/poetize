Saturday, should be lying with you on the couch
Watching movies, then some dinner, then we're going out
But instead I'm sitting in this hotel room alone, alone, alone

I wonder, do you see the stars the same way I see them?
Breathe right now the same way I'm breathing?
My heart is with you, can you feel it from across the world
The world, the world? You know that

This day feels like it's never gonna end
So sick of these dreams that I've been walking in
All I wanna do is be anywhere with you right now
Woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh
Take me sky high, we're jumping on a plane
Don't care where we land, to me, it's all the same
All I wanna do is be anywhere with you right now
Woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh

4 o'clock in the morning, damn, I can't sleep
You're running through my mind
Can you feel it on your feet?
My wake-up call is coming in a few more hours
I wish it was your voice
You might also like
I wonder, does the sun still shine the same way when I'm gone?
And when the rain falls, just know that it won't be long
Until I'm with you, but I wish that I could kiss you right now
Right now, right now, you know that

This day feels like it's never gonna end
So sick of these dreams that I've been walking in
All I wanna do is be anywhere with you right now
Woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh (Yeah)
Take me sky high, we're jumping on a plane
Don't care where we land, to me, it's all the same
All I wanna do is be anywhere with you right now
Woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh (You right now, babe)
All I wanna do is be anywhere with you right now
Yeah, okay, I'm listening (Babe, yeah)

Take that road, they can't stop me
From getting to my girl even if they shot me
Even if the world came crashing down
You'd be the only one that I'd have around
I need those lips, I can't forget you
Never gotta worry, I will protect you
That's my word and I won't break that
And you just can't fake that, you know
This day feels like it's never gonna end
So sick of these dreams that I've been walking in
All I wanna do is be anywhere with you right now
Woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh
Take me sky high, we're jumping on a plane
Don't care where we land, to me, it's all the same
All I wanna do is be anywhere with you right now
Woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh
All I wanna do is be anywhere with you right now
Woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh
