I, I, just died in your eyes, eyes
Just died in your eyes, eyes
Just died in your eyes

There's a silence in the air tonight
There's a secret we can't hide behind no more
There's a distance we don't dare to go
And a million things that I don't wanna know, oh

Your hands start undressing me
Your lips won't stop kissing me
I hear you say you love me

But baby, you're lying, lying
I see the truth your hiding, hiding
I look at you and I, I, just died in your eyes, eyes
Before I start crying, crying
Give a reason for trying, trying
The one thing that keeps me alive, I, just died in your eyes, eyes
Just died in your eyes, eyes

From the window I've been looking through
I have seen the end of me and you, oh-oh
And it's not about who's right or wrong
When you wake up in the morning, I'll be gone
You might also like
Your hands start undressing me
Your lips won't stop kissing me
I hear you say you love me

But baby, you're lying, lying
I see the truth your hiding, hiding
I look at you and I, I, just died in your eyes, eyes
Before I start crying, crying
Give a reason for trying, trying
The one thing that keeps me alive, I, just died in your eyes, eyes

My hopes, my dreams
All I believed
Just died-died, just died in your eyes, eyes
Baby, and all I know is what matters most
Just died-died, just died in your eyes, eyes
Just died in your eyes-eyes

There's a silence in the air tonight
There's a secret we can't hide behind no more

But baby, you're lying, lying
I see the truth your hiding, hiding
I look at you and I, I, just died in your eyes, eyes
Before I start crying, crying
Give a reason for trying, trying
The one thing that keeps me alive, I, just died in your eyes, eyes
Just died in your eyes, eyes
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Just died in your eyes, eyes
Just died in your eyes, eyes
Just died in your eyes, eyes
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Just died in your eyes, eyes
Just died in your eyes, eyes
Just died in your eyes, eyes
Just died in your eyes, eyes
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Just died in your eyes, eyes
Just died in your eyes, eyes
Just died in your eyes, eyes
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Just died in your eyes, eyes
Just died in your eyes, eyes
