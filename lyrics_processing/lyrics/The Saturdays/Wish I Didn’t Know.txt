Wish I didn't know, wish I didn't know
I wish I didn't know, wish I didn't know
I wish I didn't know, I didn't know
Didn't know, know, know, know

I've never, ever had someone I could call the one
Nobody's ever moved me quite the way you've done
Why would I ever think of you not by my side?
Impossible to picture you not in my life

So why am I sat here wiping away these tears?
And why, am I lying, trying to unfeel this fear?

Seeing the laughter in your eyes
Seeing the smile I thought was mine
Watching you kiss her lips goodbye
Things I wish I didn't know
If I could wipe this memory
Go back to when that girl was me
The day that I should have stayed at home
And I wish I didn't know
You might also like
Wish I didn't know, wish I didn't know
I wish I didn't know, wish I didn't know
I wish I didn't know, I didn't know
(Didn't know, know, know, know)

I'm lying here beside you, trying to block it out my mind
Just knowing that she touched you kills a little more inside, oh
I don't wanna confront you 'cause you're only gonna lie, "who?"
But what's a girl to do, just sit around and watch love die?

So why am I sat here wiping away these tears?
And why, am I lying, trying to unfeel this fear?

Seeing the laughter in your eyes
Seeing the smile I thought was mine
Watching you kiss her lips goodbye
Things I wish I didn't know
If I could wipe this memory
Go back to when that girl was me
The day that I should have stayed at home
And I wish I didn't know
Wish I didn't know, wish I didn't know
I wish I didn't know, wish I didn't know
I wish I didn't know, I didn't know
Didn't know, know, know, know

I've been busy denying
But my heart still needs to know, oh!

Seeing the laughter in your eyes
Seeing the smile I thought was mine
Watching you kiss her lips goodbye
Things I wish I didn't know
If I could wipe this memory
Go back to when that girl was me
The day that I should have stayed at home (Stayed at home)
And I wish I didn't know

Wish I didn't know, wish I didn't know (Wish I didn't know, woah oh oh)
I wish I didn't know, wish I didn't know
I wish I didn't know, I didn't know
(Didn't know, know, know, know)
Wish I didn't know, wish I didn't know (Wish I didn't know)
I wish I didn't know, wish I didn't know (Wish I didn't know, oh woah)
I wish I didn't know, I didn't know
Didn't know, know, know, know
