I didn't put this dress on for you to take it off

It took me thirty minutes just to pick out this dress
Another half an hour to clean up the mess
Another twenty minutes just to do my make-up
And you won't wake up and dance with me
What's really going on?

Oh, why you so afraid?
When I'm pretty sure you can take it
Enjoy what you see
'Cause you won't be seeing me naked
I didn't put this dress on for you to take it off
But since you're with me right now

Only got one night, only live one life
So don't let this moment slip away
There's a million lights and they shine so bright
I would die if you walked away

Don't let me dance alone
I wanna dance with somebody
Don't let me dance alone
I wanna dance with somebody
Don't let me dance alone
I wanna dance with somebody
Don't let me dance alone
I wanna dance with somebody
Don't let me dance alone

It took you twenty minutes just to come and say hi
How can you get a yes if, if you don't give it a try?
I came here with my girls, I'm not leaving without them
So you got me for one more song
Let's get it on

No money for a drink
'Cause I spent it all on my dress
These bloody heels are killing me
But they're the best
I didn't put this dress on for you to take it off
But since you're with me right now

Only got one night, only live one life
So don't let this moment slip away
There's a million lights and they shine so bright
I would die if you walked away

Don't let me dance alone
I wanna dance with somebody
Don't let me dance alone
I wanna dance with somebody
Don't let me dance alone
I wanna dance with somebody
Don't let me dance alone
I wanna dance with somebody
Don't let me dance alone
Something 'bout the music got me feeling like I'm ready to blow
Don't leave me alone (Don't let me dance alone)
Something 'bout the music got me feeling like I'm ready to blow
Don't leave me alone (Don't let me dance alone)
Don't let me dance alone, don't let me dance alone
Don't let me dance alone, oh

I didn't put this dress on for you to take it off
But since you're with me right now

Only got one night, only live one life
So don't let this moment slip away
There's a million lights and they shine so bright
I would die if you walked away

Don't let me dance alone
I wanna dance with somebody
Don't let me dance alone
I wanna dance with somebody
Don't let me dance alone
I wanna dance with somebody
Don't let me dance alone
I wanna dance with somebody, oh
Don't let me dance alone
I wanna dance with somebody
Don't let me dance alone
I wanna dance with somebody, yeah yeah yeah
Don't let me dance alone
I wanna dance with somebody
Don't let me dance alone
I wanna dance with somebody
