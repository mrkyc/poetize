You tell me you're missing me
And that you can't wait to see me again
You tell me you don't know why
You and I can't go on being friends
You say you still think of the two of us
And that you still wanna stay in touch
But I still remember

All the hell you put me through
All the tears cried over you
You can't keep coming back
It's not fair

You don't have the right to call me
Acting just like nothing's really changed
And that everything's the same
And that you can come around
And just come walking back in my life again
And you can't break my heart
And then expect that we'll still be friends
Oh baby, you don't understand
You don't have the right to do that
You might also like
I don't wanna hear from you
Or hear what's been going on in your life
I don't want you coming round
Coming here messing with my mind
I've finally got my heart to start to heal
Why can't you just stay away from me?
'Cause I still remember

All the hell you put me through
Now what am I supposed to do?
Just say that it's okay?
It's not fair

You don't have the right to call me
Acting just like nothing's really changed
And that everything's the same
And that you can come around
And just come walking back in my life again
And you can't break my heart
And then expect that we'll still be friends
Oh baby you don't understand
You don't have the right to do that
What makes you think that you could just erase the past?
Put the broken pieces back and come back into my life?
You don't have the right, no you don't

Yeah, you don't have the right to call me (Call me)
Acting just like nothing's really changed
And that everything's the same
And that you can come around (You can come around)
And just come walking back in my life again (Back into my life)
And you can't break my heart (No, you can't break my heart)
And then expect that we'll still be friends, oh baby
You don't understand
You don't have the right to do that

And you don't have the right to call me
(You don't have the right, to call me)
Like nothing's changed, everything's the same
You don't have the right
You don't have the right
