Well in come that ting they call Sean da Paul
Alongside da Saturdays
Badum badum badum
Oh why are we are waiting so long, I'm suffocating
Oh why are we are waiting so long, I'm suffocating

Boy it's now or never, time we got together
Been a long time coming, now I need that loving
I like the way you tease me but let's just make this easy
Put me in control, we could switch roles

And I'll take the lead
You're so far behind me
You know what I need
I'm not gonna stop

Whatever the weather, we're gon' be better together
So what's up baby? What about us?
Cause I've been watching and waiting
Why don't you give in and take it?
So what's up baby? What about us?
