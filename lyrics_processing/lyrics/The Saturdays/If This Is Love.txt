(Yeah)

Tell me, baby, in the night, do you think of me?
When you open up your eyes, am I there?
Are you standing by my window when I'm asleep?
Why you quiet when you know that I'm near?

You know I love you
You thought I would leave you
But baby, I've got you still
You think you want to be by yourself, don't you?
But baby, you never will

If this is love
Then I don't wanna know what is
I won't say another word
If this is love
Then I'm about to hit and miss
We're both going to get hurt if this is love
If this is love

Are you picturing me lying across your bed?
Are you thinking you were wrong to hurt me?
I forgive you, I'll forget everything you said
You will love, and you will not desert me

You think I'm crazy
I'm not, I'm your baby
I promise I'll always be
You think eventually this too will pass
But I promise I'll never leave

If this is love
Then I don't wanna know what is
I won't say another word
If this is love
Then I'm about to hit and miss
We're both going to get hurt if this is love
If this is love (If this is love)

Baby, baby if this is love
I don't know what I'm gonna do
(Don't know what I'm gonna do)
Baby, baby, if this is love
I will not accept it and we'll know that this is love
If this is love
Then I don't wanna know what is
I won't say another word (No other word)
If this is love (Ooh)
Then I'm about to hit and miss
We're both going to get hurt if this is love
Then I don't wanna know what is (Oh, yeah)

If this is love
Then I'm about to hit and miss
We're both going to get hurt if this is love

If this is love (If this is love)
