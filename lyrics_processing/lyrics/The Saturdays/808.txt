Drop like an 808 (Drop like an 808)
Drop like an 808, come drop that 808
Drop like an 808 (Drop like an 808)
Drop like an 808 (808)

Heard you got a lot of records
Lot of records that I wanna hear
So you better play my song
Play my song or I'm outta here

Won't wait for nothing, you should see me now
I started something, threw the old beat out
It ain't a problem if I like it loud
So turn it up to amazing (To amazing)

I'll make it drop like an 808, hit like a heavy weight
Said you can handle it, come drop that 808
Fight like an animal, bang like a cannonball
Come drop that 808 (808)

So tonight it's time
To do it, do it, do it so loud all night
So do it, do it, do it right now cause I
Am waiting for your love, so make it
Drop like an 808 (808)

Get an amplifier, take it outside
Parked out front cause you got a sick ride
Only one night, it's you and I
Yeah, you can run but you'd better not hide
Numb in your face, give me that bass
Speakers so hot, blowing out of space
So what's it gonna take?
Tonight won't wait, wait

Won't wait for nothing, you should see me now
I started something, threw the old beat out
It ain't a problem if I like it loud
So turn it up to amazing (To amazing)

I'll make it drop like an 808, hit like a heavy weight
Said you can handle it, come drop that 808
Fight like an animal, bang like a cannonball
Come drop that 808 (808)

So tonight it's time
To do it, do it, do it so loud all night
So do it, do it, do it right now 'cause I
Am waiting for your love, so make it
Drop like an 808
Drop!
Oh oh oh
Like an 808

So tonight it's time
To do it, do it, do it so loud all night
So do it, do it, do it right now 'cause I
Am waiting for your love, so make it
Drop like an 808 (Ooh yeah yeah)
So tonight it's time
To do it, do it, do it so loud all night
So do it, do it, do it right now cause I
Am waiting for your love, so make it
