Not good enough
Just not good enough for me

You talk about the gifts you buy for me
Talk about the beautiful things you say
The car you drive, the things you do, the way we ride
And you always seem to know what I'm about
Telling me you know without a doubt
That I'm the one, that I'm for real
Well let me ask you

Did you notice I don't like this?
I'm no trophy
What you front is not for me now

My hand doesn't wanna hold yours
My plans really don't involve yours
So enough, it's not good enough
Just not good enough, no
My eyes, they don't wanna look at you
My mind, doesn't wanna deal with who you've become
It's not good enough
Just not good enough for me
You might also like
I never understood your reasons for
Coming off as if you're good for more
Than what you have, than what you are
I'm sick of that
And I know I come across as a girl who cares
Cares about my bags and the shoes I wear
But I'm for real, I never pose
I say what I feel

Obviously you don't know me
You won't like this
But I'm gonna say it anyway

My hand doesn't wanna hold yours
My plans really don't involve yours
So enough, it's not good enough
Just not good enough, no
My eyes, they don't wanna look at you
My mind, doesn't wanna deal with who you've become
It's not good enough
Just not good enough

Your ride, I don't care about that
Your pride, I don't care about that
Where are you? Where did you go?
Please tell me who lies next to me at night?
And I, really thought that we could go so high
And it's killing me to see you try the way you do
I wanted you but you were nowhere around
My hand doesn't wanna hold yours
My plans really don't involve yours
So enough, it's not good enough
Just not good enough, no
My eyes, they don't wanna look at you
My mind, doesn't wanna deal with who you've become
It's not good enough
Just not good enough for me
My hand doesn't wanna hold yours
My plans really don't involve yours
So enough, it's not good enough
Just not good enough, no
My eyes, they don't wanna look at you
My mind, doesn't wanna deal with who you've become
It's not good enough
