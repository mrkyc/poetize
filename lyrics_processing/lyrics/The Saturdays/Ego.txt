We used to go together
Looking after each other
I thought that you were better
Look at you (Look at you, look at you, look at you)

You used to be so laid-back
You always kept it so cool
I loved you 'cause of all that
That's the truth (That's the truth, that's the truth, that's the truth)

I don't think you know where your head is
I was always there to help you break the fall

And now you wanna pretend that you a superstar
And now you want us to end
What's taken you this far?
Don't tell me that you're done as far as we go
You need to have a sit down with your ego (Ego)
When everyone's gone and you're all by yourself
You know that you're gonna come to me for help
Don't tell me that it's time for going solo
You need to knock some sense into your ego (Ego, ego)
You might also like
You act like you're on fire
Live in your delusion
You just need you to take you higher
Off you go (Off you go, off you go, off you go)
Yeah

You can't make the call when you're ready
I will not be there to help you break the fall

And now you wanna pretend that you a superstar
And now you want us to end
What's taken you this far?
Don't tell me that you're done as far as we go
You need to have a sit down with your ego (Ego)
When everyone's gone and you're all by yourself
You know that you're gonna come to me for help
Don't tell me that it's time for going solo
You need to knock some sense into your ego (Ego, ego)

And when it's time for you to come back down
To where you started, where we parted
I think you'll find that it is very hard to face
Reality's a simple place
And now you wanna pretend that you a superstar
And now you want us to end
What's taken you this far?
Don't tell me that you're done as far as we go
You need to have a sit down with your ego (Ego)
When everyone's gone and you're all by yourself
You know that you're gonna come to me for help
Don't tell me that it's time for going solo
