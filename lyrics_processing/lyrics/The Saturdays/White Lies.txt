(These lies, these lies)
(These lies, these lies)
(These lies, these lies)

Early in the morning
I sit up in my bedroom, oh
Baby, in the perfect silence
I can't hide it, it's about enough now
Baby, we've been stalling
And I've been telling fairytales
This is taking all my focus, I can't do this
There's so much you don't know

And I been fighting dark demons
Trying to make way for light
But I just dig myself deeper down
I gotta make it right

Ooh, it's time to talk about truth now
It's time I, it's time that
You know what you're getting into now
These white lies, these white lies
Turning into shades of grey, go darker everyday
They just won't go away, away, oh
Ooh, it's time to talk about truth now
These white lies, these white lies

(These lies, these lies)
(These lies, these lies)

You've been kinda perfect
And we would be a perfect match
If I only had it in me, I'm so sorry
Never meant to hurt you

And I been fighting dark demons
Trying to make way for light, yeah
But I just dig myself deeper down
I gotta make it right, oh woah

Ooh, it's time to talk about truth now
It's time I, it's time that
You know what you're getting into now
These white lies, these white lies
Turning into shades of grey, go darker everyday
They just won't go away, away, oh
Ooh, it's time to talk about truth now
These white lies, these white lies
Bad excuses, baby, it's true
And I can't excuse this
'Cause white lies turns to black lies and I lose
Oh, woah, oh

Ooh, it's time to talk about truth now
It's time I, it's time that
You know what you're getting into now
These white lies, these white lies
Turning into shades of grey, go darker everyday
They just won't go away, away, oh (Oh, no)
Ooh, it's time to talk about truth now
These white lies, these white lies
Ooh, it's time to talk about truth now
It's time I, it's time that
You know what you're getting into now (Getting into now)
These white lies, these white lies
Turning into shades of grey, go darker everyday
They just won't go away, away, oh
Ooh, it's time to talk about truth now
These white lies, these white lies
