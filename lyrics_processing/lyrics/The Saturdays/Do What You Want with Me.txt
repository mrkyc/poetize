Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
My love tonight, I can't control my love tonight
I think I found my pure delight, you got me at the speed of light
It feels so right
I think this love, it feels so right
When I close my eyes
I can't help but wonder what it would be like

If you fall for me, then let it be
Oh, you can do what you want with me
Do what you want with me
I'll hold you close, won't let you go
Oh, you can do what you want with me
Do what you want with me

You stoked a fire and fanned a live desire
I blinked an eye, who enters in my life?
Then you transpire, I can't believe my eyes
Two hearts
Two lives
Wrapped up and intertwined

If you fall for me, then let it be
Oh, you can do what you want with me
Do what you want with me
I'll hold you close, won't let you go
Oh, you can do what you want with me
Do what you want with me
You might also like
Oh oh oh oh oh (Oh oh woah, oh oh)
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh (Oh Oh)
Oh oh oh

My love tonight
I can't control my love tonight

If you fall for me, then let it be
Oh, you can do what you want with me
Do what you want with me
I'll hold you close, won't let you go (I'll hold)
Oh, you can do what you want with me
Do what you want with me

I think you are lovely, got that kind of smile
That makes me happy that you love me, love me, love me, love me
I wish you would hold me, got that kinda body
