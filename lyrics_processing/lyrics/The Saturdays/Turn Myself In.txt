I was standing by the bar on a table
I could hardly breathe
Didn't fight you, no, I couldn't say no
'Cause you were on to me

You don't know what it's like
I need you bad, I feel alone
You don't know how it feels
Just like a criminal

Turn myself in tonight
This is me coming clean with my hands up
Turn myself in tonight
'Cause I know that alone I'm in danger
Turn myself, need you here
Want you bad, you should have me in handcuffs
Turn myself in tonight
This is me coming clean with my hands up

You hear the sirens going
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
You hear the sirens going
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
You might also like
No escape as our bodies grow closer
I find it hard to leave
It's intense, your touch, and it lingers
Like a crime that's been put onto me

You don't know what it's like
I need you bad, I feel alone
You don't know how it feels
Just like a criminal

Turn myself in tonight
This is me coming clean with my hands up
Turn myself in tonight
'Cause I know that alone I'm in danger
Turn myself, need you here
Want you bad, you should have me in handcuffs
Turn myself in tonight
This is me coming clean with my hands up

You hear the sirens going
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
You hear the sirens going
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
I can feel the blue lights coming for me
(Take me, take me)
You can lock me up but I'll still be free!

Turn myself in tonight
This is me coming clean with my hands up (You don't know what it's like)
Turn myself in tonight (You don't know)
'Cause I know that alone I'm in danger (You don't know what it's like)
Turn myself, need you here (need you here)
Want you bad you should have me in handcuffs (want you bad, you should have me in)
Turn myself in tonight (oh)
This is me coming clean with my hands up

You hear the sirens going
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
