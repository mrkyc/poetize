Go on, go on, go on
Go on, go on, go on
Go on, go on, go on
Go on, go on, go on

I've been doing this my way, your way, our way
I can't make it work when all I have is not enough
I've been doing all I can, my plan, your plan
And all I get is hurt, this game we're playing has to stop
I've got you stuck in my head
And all you do is breaking me
I can't continue taking this
I've tried my best to understand
But I cannot make sense of you
I've got to take a stand and baby

I don't wanna waste another day
I don't wanna live my life this way
I'm tired, I just wanna lie back down
And I don't wanna waste another night
I don't wanna keep on chasing lights
So go on, go on, go on
Go on, go on, go on, bye, bye

I remember I met you, let you get your way in everything
You took complete control of me
I remember you lying, crying, trying to get away with it
But now I know 'cause now I see
I believed all that you said
I never questioned any lies
I never opened up my eyes
I know your words got me misled
But I am standing, I'm alive, I never had you on my side, and

I don't wanna waste another day
I don't wanna live my life this way
I'm tired, I just wanna lie back down
And I don't wanna waste another night
I don't wanna keep on chasing lights
So go on, go on, go on
Go on, go on, go on, bye, bye
Bye, bye, ooh

I've been doing this my way, your way, our way
It doesn't work

I don't wanna waste another day
I don't wanna live my life this way
I'm tired, I just wanna lie back down
And I don't wanna waste another night
I don't wanna keep on chasing lights
So go on, go on, go on
Go on, go on, go on, bye, bye
I don't wanna waste another day
I don't wanna live my life this way (Bye, bye)
I'm tired, I just wanna lie back down
And I don't wanna waste another night (Bye, bye)
I don't wanna keep on chasing lights
So go on, go on, go on
Go on, go on, go on, bye, bye
Mmm
Bye, bye
Go on, go on, go on
Go on, go on, go on
Go on, go on, go on
Go on, go on, go on
