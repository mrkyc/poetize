You took my heart from the dark
I'm falling hard
With you it's light, you killed the shade
My burning pain

I feel like something starting, starting
Playing in my head and it's beating loud
I feel like something starting, starting
Walking on the edge till we're crashing down

Hit me so hard, outta nowhere
Starstruck, up in the air
Got me, got me with my eyes wide open
Hit me so hard, outta nowhere
Starstruck, up in the air
Got me, got me with my eyes wide open

If you tell me no, I'm not giving up, no
If you tell me no, I'm not giving up, no
I'm never giving up, not giving up on love
Oh oh oh oh oh
If you tell me no, I'm not giving up, no
If you tell me no, I'm not giving up, no
I'm never giving up, not giving up on love
Oh oh oh oh oh
You might also like
You're under my skin, just stay right there
I want you there
Let the rest fade away, it's just you and me
What was meant to be

I feel like something starting, starting
Playing in my head and it's beating loud
I feel like something starting, starting
Walking on the edge till we're crashing down

Hit me so hard, outta nowhere
Starstruck, up in the air
Got me, got me with my eyes wide open
Hit me so hard, outta nowhere
Starstruck, up in the air
Got me, got me with my eyes wide open

If you tell me no, I'm not giving up, no
If you tell me no, I'm not giving up, no
I'm never giving up, not giving up on love
Oh oh oh oh oh
If you tell me no, I'm not giving up, no
If you tell me no, I'm not giving up, no
I'm never giving up, not giving up on love
Oh oh oh oh oh
Got me on overload
I'll be your rock of gold
Can we get overdosed on love?
Got me on overload
I'll be your rock of gold
Can we get overdosed on love?

Oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Hit me so hard, outta nowhere
Starstruck, up in the air
Got me, got me with my eyes wide open
Hit me so hard, outta nowhere
Starstruck, up in the air
Got me, got me with my eyes wide open

If you tell me no, I'm not giving up, no
If you tell me no, I'm not giving up, no
I'm never giving up, not giving up on love
Oh oh oh oh oh
If you tell me no, I'm not giving up, no
If you tell me no, I'm not giving up, no
I'm never giving up, not giving up on love
