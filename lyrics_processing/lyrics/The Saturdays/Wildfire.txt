Hey, hey, I've been waiting
Waiting for the day, for the day to end
When I feel the night moving in
One thing on my mind, here I go again, oh

Push up on my body
Put it on me, DJ get me high
Work me over slowly, baby
Show me feel the flame ignite
This club is heavy, now I'm ready
You're the guy to do it right
Yeah, so do it right

Get up in my face, we're burning the ground
There's no way, no way of stopping it now
Your heat is turning me on, I bet that all night long
We go like wildfire, wildfire
Get all up on me, they're playing it loud
We started a blaze, there's no putting out
Your heat is turning me on, I bet that all night long
We go like wildfire, wildfire

Getting closer, I like this feeling
Oh, you got the-
And it's set me off, oh

Push up on my body
Put it on me, DJ get me high
Work me over slowly, baby
Show me feel the flame ignite
This club is heavy, now I'm ready
You're the guy to do it right
Yeah, so do it right

Get up in my face, we're burning the ground
There's no way, no way of stopping it now
Your heat is turning me on, I bet that all night long
We go like wildfire, wildfire
Get all up on me, they're playing it loud
We started a blaze, there's no putting out (Oh oh oh)
Your heat is turning me on, I bet that all night long
We go like wildfire, wildfire
