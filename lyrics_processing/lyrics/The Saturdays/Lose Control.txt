Ooh, ooh, ooh

I always used to be the shy girl
Not a hot girl, 'I'm not your type' girl
I never cared about the cool clothes
About the right shoes, making the right moves

(But who's that boy?) Who's that boy?
When he looks at me, I'm beautiful
(Who's that boy?) Who's that boy?
I should be the face of every fashion magazine, oh!

Ooh ooh, I'm gonna feel that feeling, gonna lose control
Ooh ooh, there's a fire going on in my heart and soul
Never before I met you baby, never before tonight
But you're making me believe it's right
Ooh ooh, I'm gonna feel that feeling, gonna lose control tonight

I'm not used to being the first pick
Not the cool chick from the in-clique
I have always gone my own way
Been my own girl in my own world
You might also like
(But who's that boy?) Who's that boy?
When he looks at me, I'm beautiful

Ooh ooh, I'm gonna feel that feeling, gonna lose control
Ooh ooh, there's a fire going on in my heart and soul
Never before I met you baby, never before tonight
But you're making me believe it's right
Ooh ooh, I'm gonna feel that feeling, gonna lose control tonight

Tonight (Ah ah)
Is the night ( Ah ah)
When I leave ( Ah ah)
The past behind me
Tonight (Ah ah)
Is the night  (Ah ah)
When I'm here, (Ah ah)
You're out to find me
Yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Never, never, never

Ooh ooh, I'm gonna feel that feeling, gonna lose control
Ooh ooh, there's a fire going on in my heart and soul
Never before I met you baby, never before tonight
But you're making me believe it's right
Ooh ooh, I'm gonna feel that feeling, gonna lose control tonight
I'm gonna feel that feeling, gonna lose control
(I'm gonna feel that feeling, gonna lose control tonight)
I'm gonna feel that feeling, gonna lose control
