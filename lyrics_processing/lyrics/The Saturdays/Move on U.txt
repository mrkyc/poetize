Some girls won't make no play
Happy to sit and wait
I won't be waiting all night
Some girls, they bite their tongue
I'll tell you straight up front
Got my attention tonight

Beats are flowing, looks you're throwing
Get the fire up inside of me
Ain't no stopping when I lock in
Boy it's on if you can stand the heat

'Cause you turn me, turn me right here, right now
I'm gon' move on you when the lights go down
I can work you baby, I'll show you how
I'm gon' move on you when the lights go down
Woah-oh, woah-oh-oh-oh
I'm gon' move on you when the lights go down
Woah-oh, woah-oh-oh-oh
I'm gon' move on you when the lights go down

I'm working up a sweat
Dripping down my neck
I got you right in my sight
Come, baby, be my sin
Don't worry 'bout a thing
Just satisfy me tonight

Beats are flowing, when I lock

Woah-oh, woah-oh-oh-oh
I'm gonna move on you, move on you
Woah-oh, woah-oh-oh-oh
