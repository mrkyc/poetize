2AM, wide awake, lying on my bed
Tuning on the radio, oh
Trying to make the emptiness go, yeah yeah

I've been up, I've been reading and crying
Trying to love you a little less
But I, I, I struggle with my heart and my mind, ooh yeah

There's a tug of war and I keep losing
'Cause my heart has got a really good excuse
She's so, so sad lying in her bed
So, so mad at me, yeah

She says "I want my love, bring him back to me
I won't go anywhere, I need my baby, baby
Don't say it's over, baby, baby, oh no no no"
She says "I want my love, just to keep beating
We can't go anywhere without my baby, baby
Don't say the love is gone (Baby, baby)
My heart will not agree to beat alone"

I was so young and unfocused
Let you go even when I knew that I
I, I put you in the way of my pride, oh oh yeah
You might also like
And there's a tug of war and I keep losing
'Cause my heart has got a really good excuse
She's so, so sad lying in her bed
So, so mad at me, yeah

She says "I want my love, bring him back to me
I won't go anywhere, I need my baby, baby
Don't say it's over, baby, baby, oh no no no"
She says "I want my love, just to keep beating
We can't go anywhere without my baby, baby
Don't say the love is gone (Baby, baby)
My heart will not agree to beat alone"

Now my heart is having seizures every day
I don't know what else to do but send him free
She's crying over you and blaming me
You've gotta go home now

She says "I want my love, bring him back to me (Ooh)
I won't go anywhere, I need my baby, baby, baby, baby (Ooh, yeah yeah)
She says "I want my love, bring it back to me
I won't go anywhere, I need my baby, baby
Don't say it's over, woah woah oh yeah (Baby, baby)
She says "I want my love, just to keep beating
We can't go anywhere, without my baby, baby
Don't say the love is gone (Baby, baby)
