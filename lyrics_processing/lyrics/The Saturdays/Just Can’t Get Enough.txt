Ooh, oh

When I'm with you, baby, I go out of my head
I just can't get enough, I just can't get enough
All the things you do to me and everything you said
I just can't get enough, I just can't get enough

We slip and slide as we fall in love
And I just can't seem to get enough of

We walk together, we're walking down the street
I just can't get enough, I just can't get enough
Every time I think of you I know we have to meet
I just can't get enough, I just can't get enough

It's getting hotter, it's our burning love
And I just can't seem to get enough of
Yeah, I just can't get enough
Just can't get enough, I just can't enough

I just can't get enough, I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough, I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough, I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough, I just can't get enough
You might also like
And when it rains, you're shining down for me
I just can't get enough, I just can't get enough
Just like a rainbow, you know you set me free
I just can't get enough, I just can't get enough

You're like an angel and you give me your love
And I just can't seem to get enough of
Oh, oh, just can't get enough
I just can't enough
Oh, oh, I just can't get enough
I can't get enough

I just can't get enough, I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough, I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough, I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough, I just can't get enough
(Ooh) I just can't get enough, (Yeah) I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough, I just can't get enough (Ooh)
I just can't get enough, I just can't get enough
