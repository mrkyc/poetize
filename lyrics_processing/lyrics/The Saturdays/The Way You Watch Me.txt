Yeah, Lucas I see you
It's your boy Travie McCoy and The Saturdays
Let's go!

One thing I love is acting like
I don't know, don't know, when boy I really know
That you want me, your eyes are hungry
And it shows, but no go unless I'm in control

I'm not the kind of girl that you, you choose
I'm choosing you, no exception to the rule
But the way that you

The way, the way, the way you watch me
The way you watch me walk in through the door
I know what you're ready for
The way you watch me
The way you watch me glide across the floor
I know what you're ready for

I wanna do more than watch, just a little bit more than watch
I've gotta be honest though, I've just gotta be honest though
I wanna do more than watch, oh, so much more than watch
I already chose you long ago, so go, go grab your coat
You might also like
Soon as I stepped in the place, your eyes had me dazed
And we both know, and we both know I'm not alone here
I give your body a trace from your feet to your face
I was so so, I was so so, no, throw a dog a bone, dear

I've gotta say you made your mark
And now I know you won't, won't be lonely after dark
But the way that you

The way, the way, the way you watch me
The way you watch me walk in through the door
I know what you're ready for
The way you watch me
The way you watch me glide across the floor
I know what you're ready for

I wanna do more than watch, just a little bit more than watch
I've gotta be honest though, I've just gotta be honest though
I wanna do more than watch, oh, so much more than watch
I already chose you long ago, so go, go grab your coat

(I) I've gotta say you made your mark (Gotta say you made your mark)
And now I know you won't
Won't be alone, won't be lonely after dark
But the way that you
The way, the way, the way you watch me
You got me feeling like Rockwell
I shot a glance at from you across the room
How could you not tell?
The way, the way, the way you watch me
Feels like CIA surveillance
Every move I make you calculate
To even out the balance
The way, the way, the way you watch me
Makes me want to watch you back
And undress you with my pupils
Girl, you look so good in black
The way, the way, the way you watch me
Makes me feel some kind of wonderful
The feeling you is drowning in
I'm caught up in the undertow

The way, the way, the way you watch me
The way you watch me walk in through the door
I know what you're ready for
The way you watch me
The way you watch me glide across the floor
I know what you're ready for

I wanna do more than watch, just a little bit more than watch
I've gotta be honest though, I've just gotta be honest though
I wanna do more than watch, oh, so much more than watch
