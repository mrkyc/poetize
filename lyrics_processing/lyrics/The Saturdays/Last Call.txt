The sun goes down and that's the time that it hurts so bad
I feel the weight of the love we had
I can't move on without you and I've lost myself
You're like a habit that I can't help

No, I can't hide from this feeling
Don't you know?

I would wait for you, I would wait all night
Just the thought of you before I close my eyes
It's too late, I can't take anymore (I can't take anymore)
And I can't let it go and I can't forget
All that I'm left holding is my regret
And it feels like we could have had it all
(We could've had it all)
You're still my last call

We don't change, we still talk every single day
Even though there's nothing much left to say
Ooh, and I have tried all that I can but I can't break free
There's no denying you're a part of me that I can't throw away, oh
You might also like
I would wait for you, I would wait all night
Just the thought of you before I close my eyes
It's too late, I can't take anymore (I can't take anymore, oh)
And I can't let it go and I can't forget
All that I'm left holding is my regret
And it feels like we could have had it all
(We could've had it all)
And you're still my last call, oh woah
You're still my last call, oh woah

The last thing I do, the last thing I say, the last thing I do
The last thing I do, the last thing I say, the last thing I do
Is hear your voice say "I love you"

I would wait for you, I would wait all night
Just the thought of you before I close my eyes
It's too late, I can't take anymore (I can't take anymore, anymore)
And I can't let it go  and I can't forget
All that I'm left holding is my regret
And it feels like we could have had it all
(We could've had it all)

You're still my last call
