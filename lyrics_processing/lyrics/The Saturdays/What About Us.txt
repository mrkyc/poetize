Oh why are we are waiting so long, I'm suffocating
Oh why are we are waiting so long, I'm suffocating

Boy it's now or never, time we got together
Been a long time coming, now I need that loving
I like the way you tease me, but let's just make this easy
Put me in control, we could switch roles

And I'll take the lead
You're so far behind me
You know what I need
I'm not gonna stop

Whatever the weather, we're gon' be better together
So what's up baby? What about us?
'Cause I've been watching and waiting
Why don't you give in and take it?
So what's up baby? What about us?

What you doing to my head? Na na na na na
Should be here with me instead, na na na na na
What about those words you said? Na na na na na
What about us? (What about u-u-u-u-us-s)

I love to hear you whisper, take it, take it lower
Don't be afraid to show her what your freak can do
'Cause we can do it nightly, you get me excited
Now it's my turn, turn, tu-, yes it's my turn

So give it to me
Why are we waiting?
I know what you need
And I'm not gonna stop

Whatever the weather, we're gon' be better together
So what's up baby? What about us?
'Cause I've been watching and waiting
Why don't you give in and take it?
So what's up baby? What about us?

What you doing to my head? Na na na na na
Should be here with me instead, na na na na na
What about those words you said? Na na na na na
What about us?

Whatever the weather, we're gon' be better together

'Cause I've been watching and waiting (Yeah)
Why don't you give in and take it? (Oh)
So what's up baby? What about us?

What you doing to my head? Na na na na na

Let me take the lead, na na na na na
You know what I need, na na na na na
Put my mind at ease (Oh-ooh)
And tell me what about us?
