You can't lease my love, you can't lease my love
You can't lease my love, you can't lease my love
You can't lease my love, you can't lease my love
(Darkchild)
You can't lease my love (The Saturdays), you can't lease my love
(Let's go, let's go)
You can't lease my love

Oh, this was just an empty space
Before we tried to live
Clean windows and a can of paint
And we began to build in spite of them
Tried to build it up, yeah, tried to build it up
In spite of them
Had to build it up, yeah, had to build it up

I have felt such an imbalance
Loved my way around it
And everyone around believed
That one of us was in it for the profit
For the profit, for the profit
Just for the profit
For the profit, for the profit
You might also like
And now we're months behind on rent
Every dollar gone, I spent
Getting closer to the end, it all depends
If you will break from me, break from me
Break away from me

You tried to lease my love, lease my love, lease my love
But you can't cheat my love
Go on and lease my love, lease my love, lease my love
You can't cheat my love

I knew this day would come
It came so very quick
I knew that once we fell apart
No glue would ever stick
And we would fall
For the profit, for the profit
Oh-oh, we would fall
For the profit, for the profit

And now we're months behind on rent
Every dollar gone, I spent
Getting closer to the end, it all depends
If you will break from me, break from me
Break away from me
You tried to lease my love, lease my love, lease my love
But you can't cheat my love
Go on and lease my love, lease my love, lease my love
You can't cheat my love

I had been
Hoping you'd fall for me soon
You had been
Planning a move
And a part of me
(Knew that I was naive)
But I never believed
(You would actually leave)

You tried to lease my love, lease my love, lease my love
But you can't cheat my love
Go on and lease my love, lease my love, lease my love
You can't cheat my love
You tried to lease my love
(We had ups and downs and drowned in stormy weather)
Lease my love, lease my love
(You can't lease my love 'cause my loving is forever)
But you can't cheat my love
Go on and lease my love
(You go ahead and leave me, perfect girls not like me)
Lease my love, lease my love
You can't cheat my love
(And I will get breezy, and my love will never be for lease, oh woah)
You can't lease my love, you can't lease my love
You can't lease my love, you can't lease my love
You can't lease my love, you can't lease my love
