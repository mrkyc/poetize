I know the nights are lonely babe
There's so much rain, so far away, yeah
Know I'd rather be with you
But I gotta do what I gotta do

Every minute of the day gets longer
When you're not around, baby I'm going insane
All the distance makes us stronger

So baby leave a light on for me when I'm gone
Leave a light on for me all night long
Leave a light on for me 'cause I'm coming home
So baby leave a light on for me, I'll be back
Leave a light on for me, you know that
Leave a light on for me 'cause I'm coming home

Baby, without you by my side
It's hard to sleep at night, just isn't right at all
But no matter where we are
It's the same stars shining in the dark, oh woah

Every minute of the day gets longer
When you're not around, baby I'm going insane
All the distance makes us stronger
And no matter what, nothing's ever gonna change
We just gotta keep on
Doing what we do like nobody else does it
With you is where I belong
You might also like
So baby leave a light on for me when I'm gone
Leave a light on for me all night long
Leave a light on for me 'cause I'm coming home
So baby leave a light on for me, I'll be back
Leave a light on for me, you know that
Leave a light on for me 'cause I'm coming home

'Cause I'm coming home
Leave a light on for me, coming home
'Cause I'm coming home
I said baby won't you wait for me? I'm coming
'Cause I'm coming home
Won't you leave that light in the window
'Cause no matter where the wind blows, oh
'Cause I'm coming home

'Cause the picture don't do it any justice
And no matter where I am, you can trust this
You ain't gotta worry 'cause you know you're all I need
To hear your voice on the phone isn't near enough
When I hear it, I wanna be near your touch
In your arms, soon that's where I'll be
So baby leave a light on for me when I'm gone
Leave a light on for me all night long
Leave a light on for me 'cause I'm coming home
So baby leave a light on for me, I'll be back
Leave a light on for me, you know that
Leave a light on for me 'cause I'm coming home

'Cause I'm coming home
'Cause I'm coming home
So baby leave a light on for me
'Cause I'm coming home
