Go, go, go
It's time to make a move and we both know
It's time to step it up a notch
I'm ready to lose touch
Baby boy, go, go, go

This is the crossing at the main intersection
Up is where we go from here, finest selection
This could take us anywhere, I don't want protection
Life is better off the line, I, I

I'm ready for the lift up, keep steady beat
'Cause I'm ready for the big jump, keep up with me
If you lose me, then you know
You're just a bit too slow, I only go up, up
I'm ready to be in control
And the ground isn't good enough for me
I know where to find what I want
And I'ma keep on, keep on, up, up

No turns now
We're going straight, you'd better hold on tight
'Cause if you fall, you're on your own
'Cause I'm gonna go on
No, no, no turns now
