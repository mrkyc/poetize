Tryna get my money up but I don't want my cash back
Piano guy's potato's channel's just wack
I got a ps4 for decoration, your setup is scrap
Splash and cash, lyrics are what you lack
On the lego game, you have bad stats
Spell stats backwards and thats whats bad
You get that bar? I'm just cuddling with my cats
They want to say that I need more
But I'm here in my 4-4 in a four door
Skengs on man, hoping that I dont crash
I just want to relax and work is what I mash
I just pull up in the driveway
Ash tray by the fire place
Make videos but I don't got a workrate
Got 2-2 kway
When they see me they're like no way
Gang ting, not what I live for
But you know war leaves a fair share of corpse
When I spit my shit they just ask for an encore
Because my music gets you hooked like a fresh jawn
Kids want to come at me if your channels dying
You don't want to make a diss track towards me if you're lying
Your content leaves me sighing
And ending your career is so satisfying
I just spend 2 minutes on a disstrack and leave kids crying
Face to the floor, feds will have a problem identifying
I made this shit without trying
You might also likeFeds on my tail, I'm just firing off dots like braille
I don't have a problem paying the bail
Imagine this, a chopper loaded with 45s and 50s
Kind of makes you trip
I just want to make music to reminisce
I'm like tyson with my left hooks but I dont have a lisp
And my bullets will fly fast, you will wish I miss
I don't have to make a disstrack over 2 minutes
But face it your channel is finished
My bank account has too many digits
And don't make anymore lyrics
I'm not on a gang ting but I'll pull up to a rave
The snakes don't leave me space to escape
I'm like schofield in prison break
Ohio brothers are a piss take
Logan and jake
You're too busy dreaming
You need to awake
That ting over there showing me cake
