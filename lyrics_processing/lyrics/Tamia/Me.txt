Love was the former owner
But quiet is renting our house
It ceases my lips from speaking
But forms a sarcastic smile
Suspense now raised one of your eyebrows
You asked me if there's someone else
I replied yes hell yes

You asked if it's another man I said NO
You laughed and say is it a woman I say YES
Surprisingly you ask me for honey's name

And her name is me
And she loves me more than you'll ever know
And I finally see that
Loving you and loving me just don't seem to work at all
So patiently
She's waiting on me to tell you that she needs love
And to choose between you two
Boy you know if I have to choose I choose me

And she told me to tell you to never to hurt me again
Cause if you haven't heard she's a bad chick
Even though I haven't been no
Yet and still you try and test me by raising an angry hand
Put it down put it down
You might also like
I'm leaving don't try and stop me NO
I'm late and she is waiting YES
My love for me is too much so I can't stay

And her name is me
And she loves me more than you'll ever know
And I finally see that
Loving you and loving me just don't seem to work at all
So patiently
She's waiting on me to tell you that she needs love
And to choose between you two
Boy you know if I have to choose I choose me

Cause she's actually forming a threesome
And I'm happy that I can join them
Their names are me myself and I

And her name is me
She loves me more than you'll ever know
I finally see that
Loving you and loving me just don't seem to work at all
So patiently
She's waiting on me to tell you that she needs love
And to choose between you two
Boy you know if I have to choose I choose me
She's waiting on me to tell you that she needs love
Gotta to choose between you two
And you know if I have to choose I choose me
