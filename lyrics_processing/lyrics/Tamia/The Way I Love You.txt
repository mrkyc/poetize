She can't do what I do to you
I know she can't love you the way I love you

Right here looking in your eyes
Thinking about what we did last night
And how you felt me, it blew my mind
Your touch to your tender kiss
Couldn't take you breathing in my ear
Just being with you made me realize

And every time I see you, baby, I fall in love over again
So proud that you were my man
And I still can't, can't get you outta my head
You're all I've ever wanted and you just gotta know that

She can't do the things I do to you
No one is loving you the way, the way I love you
She can't be everything you need
And what you need is me 'cause it's the way I love you
The way that I love you
Love you the way I do
The way, the way, the way I love you
You might also like
When you smile, my mind goes bare
Can't imagine life without you here
Someway somehow you've completed me
Thankful you came my way
What we have can't be replaced
You make it easy to be in love

And every time I see you, baby, and I fall in love over again
So proud that you were my man
And I still can't, can't get you outta my head
You're all I've ever wanted and you just gotta know that

She can't do the things I do to you (She can't)
No one is loving you the way, the way I love you
She can't be everything you need (Every little thing, baby)
And what you need is me 'cause it's the way I love you
The way that I love you
Love you the way I do
The way, the way, the way I love you

Don't waste your time, baby
And you know that you're mine, baby
She can't satisfy the way that I do
'Cause she can't love you like I do
She can't do the things I do to you
No one is loving you the way, the way I love you
She can't be everything you need
(She could never be me, babe, 'cause she knows that you needed me)
And what you need is me 'cause it's the way I love you
She can't do the things I do to you (Please listen to me, baby)
No one is loving you the way, the way I love you (The way I love you)
She can't be everything you need
And what you need is me 'cause it's the way I love you
The way that I love you
Love you the way I do
The way, the way, the way I love you
The way that I love you
Love you the way I do
